RESUMO 
 

Os ciprinídeos (Cyprinidae) constituem a família mais numerosa de peixes de água 

doce, tendo uma distribuição a nível global e ocupando uma grande diversidade de 

nichos ecológicos. Na Península Ibérica, encontram-se representados por um grande 

número de espécies endémicas, a maioria das quais com estatutos de conservação 

elevados. Para além das ameaças inerentes aos ecossistemas fluviais (e.g. poluição, 

proliferação de espécies exóticas e destruição de habitats) e do carácter intermitente de 

grande parte dos rios da região, os ciprinídeos ibéricos apresentam, na sua grande 

maioria, populações fragmentadas e com reduzida diversidade genética, o que potencia 

o seu risco de extinção. 

 O ruivaco-do-Oeste Achondrostoma occidentale é uma das espécies endémicas 

de Portugal que se encontra fortemente ameaçada. Este pequeno ciprinídeo apresenta 

uma distribuição muito restrita, limitada às ribeiras do Alcabrichel, Sizandro e Safarujo, 

onde as populações já com baixa diversidade genética enfrentam ainda graves 

problemas de poluição das águas e destruição de habitats. 

Face à situação de risco do ruivaco-do-Oeste e ao contexto de seca ocorrido em 

Portugal em 2006, iniciou-se em 2007 um programa de conservação ex situ desta 

espécie. Este programa permitiu até à data, a realização de sete acções de repovoamento 

das populações de ruivaco-do-Oeste do Alcabrichel, Sizandro e Safarujo, com a 

libertação de um total de 6577 indivíduos. Apesar do sucesso da reprodução do ruivaco-

do-Oeste em cativeiro, a sua ecologia permanece pouco conhecida, sendo evidente a 

falta de informação de base sobre a distribuição e abundância das populações naturais e 

parâmetros de história de vida, nomeadamente no que se refere aos padrões de 

crescimento (tanto das populações selvagens como das criadas em cativeiro) e ao 

comportamento reprodutor. O esclarecimento destes vários aspectos reveste-se de 

extrema relevância para definir directrizes para futuras acções de repovoamento de 

populações selvagens desta espécie. 

Neste contexto, e através de três abordagens distintas, pretende-se com esta tese: (1) 

avaliar o uso do habitat e o estado actual das populações selvagens, através de estimativas 

de abundância relativa e determinação do comprimento e condição física; (2) estudar o 

crescimento das populações em cativeiro e compará-lo com o das populações selvagens; (3) 

descrever o comportamento reprodutor da espécie, usando uma população mantida em 

cativeiro em condições que recriam o mais fielmente possível o ambiente natural. Com base 



5 

 

na análise integrada dos resultados obtidos com esta abordagem multidisciplinar, 

pretendem-se indicar formas de melhorar a eficácia das futuras acções de repovoamento a 

realizar no âmbito do programa de conservação ex situ de que esta espécie é alvo. 

 A monitorização das populações selvagens foi realizada entre Setembro e Outubro 

de 2014, no final da estação seca, quando a conectividade das ribeiras Alcabrichel, Sizandro 

e Safarujo estava ainda interrompida e os peixes se encontravam confinados em pêgos 

isolados, que funcionam como refúgios estivais e fontes de colonizadores para o sistema na 

estação húmida.  

As zonas montante das três ribeiras foram percorridas de carro e mapearam-se os 

pêgos persistentes. Em cada um dos 14 pegos inventariados quantificaram-se, 15 variáveis 

de habitat, descritoras da morfologia do pêgo (i.e. comprimento, largura e profundidade 

máximas, área e volume), ensombramento das galerias ripícolas, abundância de macrófitas 

e de detritos, substrato dominante, heterogeneidade do substrato, temperatura da água, pH e 

concentração de amónia, nitritos e nitratos na água. A abundância relativa de A. occidentale 

foi estimada através de pesca eléctrica, sendo o tempo de amostragem proporcional ao 

volume do pêgo. Foram medidos o comprimento à furca e o peso de todos os indivíduos 

capturados, com vista à obtenção de distribuições de comprimento e determinação do factor 

de condição, respectivamente. Para os peixes com mais de 40 mm, foram ainda retiradas 

três escamas da terceira fiada de escamas abaixo da barbatana dorsal, para posterior 

determinação da idade e taxas de crescimento. Foi também verificada a presença, na 

barbatana dorsal, da cicatriz do corte efectuado aos indivíduos libertados nas acções de 

repovoamento, para reconhecimento da sua proveniência. 

 Por forma a comparar o crescimento das populações selvagens com o das 

populações cativas, foram recolhidas escamas em indivíduos das populações mantidas em 

cativeiro no Aquário Vasco da Gama e na Estação Aquícola de Campelo. 

A idade de cada indivíduo foi determinada através da contagem, à lupa, das marcas 

anuais de crescimento. O comprimento à furca em cada idade foi estimado por retrocálculo, 

a partir das relações entre o raio total da escama e o comprimento à furca, e foram 

posteriormente determinados os incrementos anuais de comprimento. 

 A componente deste trabalho relativa ao estudo do comportamento reprodutor do 

ruivaco-do-Oeste foi realizada no Aquário Vasco da Gama, com uma população do Rio 

Safarujo fundada em 2011. Após um período de observação informal iniciado em 

Novembro de 2014, os primeiros indícios de início de actividade reprodutora no tanque 

experimental foram observados no princípio de Abril de 2015, tendo-se então iniciado a 

descrição dos comportamentos reprodutores e a construção do respectivo etograma. 



6 

 

Posteriormente, no início de Maio de 2015, procedeu-se à quantificação dos 

comportamentos reprodutores em função do substrato (plantas, meadas de lã e areão) e do 

período do dia (8h30-11h30, 11h30-14h30 e 15h00-18h00). Os valores de temperatura e a 

quantidade de luz incidente no tanque experimental a cada quatro horas foram registados 

automaticamente com um data logger. 

 A monitorização dos refúgios estivais revelou que os pêgos com maior área se 

encontravam no Rio Sizandro, enquanto que os do Rio Alcabrichel apresentavam um 

maior volume. O número de indivíduos capturados por pêgo foi superior no Rio 

Sizandro e inferior no Rio Safarujo. A abundância relativa do ruivaco-do-Oeste em cada 

pêgo apresentou uma associação positiva com a temperatura da água e a abundância de 

macrófitas e negativa com a profundidade. Os maiores valores de abundância relativa 

foram observados em dois pêgos que foram alvo de acções de repovoamento, um no Rio 

Alcabrichel e outro no Rio Sizandro, que foram alvo de acções de repovoamento em 

2011 e 2013. Nestes pêgos, os indivíduos capturados apresentaram também valores 

relativamente altos de condição física.  

 As distribuições de comprimento à furca obtidas para as populações do 

Alcabrichel e do Sizandro revelaram um padrão bimodal, reflectindo muito 

provavelmente o efeito das acções de repovoamento no aumento das classes de idade 

mais jovens (0+ e 1+). Na população do Safarujo, a única que não tinha sido alvo de 

qualquer acção de repovoamento à data das amostragens, a distribuição de comprimento 

apresentou um carácter unimodal e uma maior variabilidade. 

 A maior longevidade foi registada em indivíduos criados em cativeiro (5+). 

Estes indivíduos tendem a apresentar crescimentos superiores aos indivíduos selvagens, 

nas populações do Alcabrichel e do Safarujo. Pelo contrário, nas populações do 

Sizandro, os indivíduos selvagens apresentaram maior crescimento, podendo esta 

diferença dever-se às menores temperaturas a que está sujeita a população do Sizandro 

mantida em cativeiro em Campelo. 

 Relativamente ao comportamento reprodutor do ruivaco-do-Oeste, foi possível 

observar comportamentos de pré-postura que envolvem, maioritariamente, a 

perseguição de fêmeas em pré-postura por parte dos machos. Verificou-se uma maior 

prevalência dos comportamentos reprodutores junto a plantas aquáticas, em comparação 

com a actividade observada junto aos outros substratos disponíveis (areão e meadas de 

lã), o que sugere que as plantas podem constituir o substrato preferencial para a desova 

nesta espécie. 



7 

 

 Globalmente, os dados recolhidos através da abordagem multidisciplinar 

desenvolvida para o estudo do ruivaco-do-Oeste revelaram que (1) as acções de 

repovoamento podem efectivamente contribuir para o reforço das classes de idade mais 

jovens e para um possível aumento de tamanho e condição física individual; (2) pêgos 

com maior volume e abundância de macrófitas são locais potenciais para futuras acções 

de repovoamento; (3) a presença de plantas aquáticas é, muito provavelmente, essencial 

para o sucesso reprodutor desta espécie e consequentemente para o recrutamento de 

colonizadores em cada ano, sendo este um dos critérios que deve ser tido em conta na 

escolha de locais para futuras acções de repovoamento; (4) independentemente das boas 

indicações obtidas através das monitorizações de populações selvagens, o programa de 

conservação ex situ desta espécie, para ser plenamente conseguido, deverá ser 

acompanhado por uma melhoria significativa de troços de cada uma das ribeiras 

habitadas pelo ruivaco-do-Oeste.

ABSTRACT 

 

Iberian cyprinids include a high number of endemic and highly threatened species. One 

of such species is the Portuguese western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale which is 

currently under threat mainly due to habitat degradation and water scarcity, risks that 

are further potentiated by its low geographic range and reduced genetic diversity. 

Although A. occidentale has been the target of an ex situ conservation program since 

2007, there is still a considerable lack of baseline information on this species.  

This study aimed to gather data on habitat use, population abundance and 

condition, growth and reproductive behaviour that could provide valuable guidelines to 

future restocking actions. Fish and habitat surveys were conducted in persistent pools 

that could act as summer refugia. Growth rates were determined for wild and captive 

populations and reproductive behaviour was studied in specimens bred in captivity.  

Results showed that (1) macrophytes’ coverage was positively associated and 

pool depth was negatively associated with fish relative abundance; (2) restocking 

actions led to a reinforcement of lower age classes in A. occidentale wild populations; 

(3) captive populations of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo rivers have higher growth rates 

than the corresponding wild ones; and (4) aquatic vegetation is the preferred substrate 

for spawning in this species.  

Taken together, these results suggest that future restocking actions should be 

accompanied by habitat recovery, focusing on river bank vegetation, and conducted in 

persistent pools with high water volumes and abundant aquatic vegetation. It is also 

recommended that these actions are followed by annual surveys in order to assess the 

recovery of wild populations of A. occidentale.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1. Current status and threats to Iberian cyprinids 

Freshwater fishes are amongst the most threatened organisms in the world 

(Duncan and Lockwood 2001, Maceda-Veiga 2012, Carrizo et al. 2013). Cyprinids are 

the most diverse family, show a worldwide distribution (Nelson 2006) and include some 

of the world’s most threatened species (Duncan and Lockwood 2001). However, due 

to their lack of economic and fishing value (Doadrio 2001), there is few funding to the 

conservation of these species, namely through captive breeding (Sousa-Santos 2014a). 

In the Iberian Peninsula, the cyprinid fauna includes a large proportion of 

endemic species (Doadrio et al. 2001, Cabral et al. 2005), which is mainly a 

consequence of the persistence of geographic barriers that strongly reduce the 

possibilities of colonization of this region by freshwater fishes (Robalo et al. 2006). 

Indeed, the complete elevation of the Pyrenees and the refill of the Mediterranean after 

the Messinian salinity crisis seem to have played a major role in preventing further 

contacts between Iberian and, respectively, Central European and African river systems 

(Levy et al. 2009). 

Most Iberian cyprinids are highly threatened (Smith et al. 2006, Hermoso and 

Clavero 2011). Indeed, the proportion of threatened species in this region is amongst the 

highest recorded in the IUCN assessment of the conservation status of freshwater 

fishes in Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011). This situation is mainly due to several 

human-caused threats, including pollution, damming, water abstraction, and the spread 

of exotic species (Cabral et al. 2005). Additionally, Iberian cyprinids generally display 

low genetic diversity (Sousa-Santos et al. 2013) and small geographic distribution 

ranges (Cabral et al. 2005, Doadrio et al. 2001), which enhance their risk of 

imperilment. Currently, 26 out of the 38 species of Iberian cyprinids raise some level of 

conservation concern (Cabral et al. 2005, Doadrio et al. 2001). 

1.2. The western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale 

In Portugal, cyprinids and other freshwater and migrating fishes form the second most 

threatened group of vertebrates, with 67% of the ciprinid species classified as 

Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered, in the Portuguese Red Book of 



10 

 

Vertebrates (Cabral et al. 2005). Of the 21 native cyprinid species currently found in 

Portugal, 6 are “Critically Endangered” and 6 are “Endangered” (Cabral et al. 2005, 

Freyhof and Kottelat 2008, IUCN 2015). 

The western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale (Robalo, Almada, Sousa-

Santos, Moreira and Doadrio 2005) is one of the cyprinids endemic to Portugal listed as 

“Endangered” by the IUCN (Freyhof and Kottelat 2008).This small species reaches a 

mean adult size of 100 mm fork-length (Robalo et al. 2008) and shows a reduced 

distribution range, occurring only in three small independent basins in the western slope 

of Portugal: Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo (Figure 1.1) which face severe 

pollution, water abstraction, and habitat destruction (Robalo et al. 2008). The 

reproductive season extends from late April to early May (Robalo et al. 2008) and 

spawning seems to occur in aquatic plants, according to studies in captivity (Pereira 

2007). 

 

Figure 1.1. Location and general characteristics of the river basins inhabited by the western ruivaco A. 

occidentale [Illustration by Clara Almada]. 

Morphologically, A. occidentale resembles to the other two species of the 

Achondrostoma genus occurring in Portugal (Achondrostoma arcasii and 

Achondrostoma oligolepis), with orange coloration in the insertion of the pectoral, 

pelvic and anal fins (Robalo et al. 2005) - see Figure 1.2. Phylogenetically, A. 

occidentale is close to A. arcasii from the northwestern Iberian river basins (Robalo et 



11 

 

al. 2006). A recent genetic survey revealed that A. occidentale populations are currently 

genetically depleted (Sousa-Santos et al. 2013) - see Appendix I.

1.3. Captive breeding as a species conservation measure 

After the description of A. occidentale, surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 in 

the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers revealed that populations were small and 

fragmented (C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). Moreover, a severe drought was still in 

course at the end of 2005 (García-Herrera et al. 2007), and long river stretches were 

already dry, increasing the risk of loss of individuals and local extinctions. In these 

circumstances, a stock of adult individuals from the Alcabrichel River was captured and 

maintained in a tank at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium as an extreme safeguard measure 

(Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Sizandro wild specimens were also captured, but they were 

first used for a study on reproductive behaviour (Pereira 2007) and only afterwards 

stocked for captive breeding, at the Campelo Station (Table 1.1). 

The spontaneous reproduction of this species in captivity (Gil et al. 2010) 

prompted the launching of an ex situ conservation program targeting A. occidentale and 

other five highly threatened cyprinids (see details in Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). 

Similarly to other captive breeding programs (e.g. Bice et al. 2013, Hammer et al. 

2013), the final goal of this program was to release captive bred populations in the 

streams where their founders were collected, after the requalification of at least some 

river stretches (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Indeed, captive breeding has been shown to 

be essential in preventing the extinction of several threatened species (e.g. Adamski et 

al. 2007, Rakes et al. 2013), by providing a high number of offspring per generation 

which can be used to restock wild populations with low effective population sizes 

(Champagnon et al. 2012). 



12 

 

Because avoiding artificial selection and domestication is crucial in ex situ 

conservation programs aiming to restock wild populations (Saura et al. 2008), a 

‘‘naturalistic approach’’ of the reproduction was adopted for A. occidentale, aiming to 

breed and rear fish in conditions that would preserve the natural behavioural patterns of 

the species (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). This approach relied on: (1) naturally occurring 

spawning, without artificial stimulation or hormonal induction, (2) availability of refuge 

areas for fry and juveniles; (3) natural conditions of light and temperature, essential for 

gonadal maturation; and (4) minimal human intervention (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). 

To account for the eventual genetic diversity loss due to inbreeding and lineage sorting, 

captive breeding from the same initial stock was, in general, limited to three consecutive 

generations (one per year), and after the release of all the fish produced, new captive 

populations were founded from newly captured wild individuals (Sousa-Santos et al. 

2014). Further details on the methods used and full descriptions of the ex situ 

conservation facilities can be found in Sousa-Santos et al. (2014a). 

Since 2006, under the scope of the ex situ Conservation Program, seven captive 

stocks of A. occidentale were founded at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium and at the 

Campelo Station, and their offspring were used to restock their respective wild 

populations (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a and unpublished data) - see Table 1.1. 

Table 1.1. Year of foundation of the captive breeding populations of A. occidentale at the Vasco da Gama 

Aquarium (AVG) and at the Campelo Station (CS), and of the restocking actions in wild populations. 

Note: Restocking of the Safarujo population in 2015 occurred after the collection of the data presented in 

this thesis. 

 

Overall, between March 2011 and April 2015, seven restocking actions of the 

wild populations were conducted, comprising the release of 6577 fish reared in captivity 

(Table 1.1): five restocking actions at the Alcabrichel River (N=4918 individuals), one

at the Sizandro River (N=1309 individuals) and one at the Safarujo River (N=350) 

(Sousa-Santos et al. 2014 and unpublished data). In all cases, fish were released in 

upstream stretches, in areas with preserved habitats and good water quality (see Figure 

3.1 in Material and Methods for site locations), after being marked by cutting off the 

dorsal fin, for easy identification of recaptured individuals in future surveys. Fin cut off 

has been shown to have minor effects on fish, with scars persisting quite visible over 

time (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). Nevertheless, to avoid injuring small fish, individuals 

smaller than 50 mm fork-length were not marked. As it is essential that ex situ 

conservation programs are supported by habitat restoration actions, some efforts were 

also made concerning water quality improvement and habitat rehabilitation, especially 

at the Alcabrichel River, where natural engineering techniques were used to recover 

spawning habitats and prevent river bank erosion (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). 
 

1.4. Integrating ecological and ethological data into restocking programs 

Besides captive breeding and habitat restoration, the adoption of effective measures 

towards the conservation of endangered species generally benefits from 

multidisciplinary data on the target species, namely on habitat influence (Granado-

Lorencio 1992), population prioritization, dynamics and distribution (Magalhães et al. 

2002a, Magalhães et al. 2003, Clarkson et al. 2012), genetics and evolutionary history 

(Robalo et al. 2007, Karaiskou et al. 2011, Kitanishi et al. 2013), behaviour (Sutherland 

1998, Robalo et al. 2007, Ozer and Ashley 2013) and habitat use (Santos and Ferreira 

2008, Martelo et al. 2014). Given the characteristics of the rivers inhabited by A. 

occidentale, with a high level of pollution and flow intermittence (ARHTejo 2011), and 

the fragmentation revealed in these species populations (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a), the 

later approaches towards the conservation of endangered species can assume a vital role 

in this specific case. 

 Rivers in southern Iberian Peninsula are generally intermittent, showing seasonal 

floods and droughts of variable intensity, in association with fluctuations in rainfall 

(Granado-Lorencio 1992, Clavero et al. 2004). Drying is likely to be particularly 

significant for fish, as it results in major habitat contraction and loss of connectivity 

throughout the stream network (Magalhães et al. 2002b). This particular context makes 

it essential to understand which habitats may act as refugia and favour the persistence of 

A. occidentale along the river courses during the dry season, as those should be 



14 

 

considered priority areas for protection and restoration and may configure potential 

locations for restocking actions. 

Ethological studies can also have an essential contribute to the conservation of 

A. occidentale, as it has already been demonstrated that data on the spawning behaviour 

should be taken into account in the context of fish conservation, and particularly of 

captive breeding and restocking (Rakes et al. 1999, Carvalho 2003, Carvalho et al. 

2003, Pereira 2007, Goren 2009, Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Although all cyprinids are 

oviparous with external fertilization, there is high variability in their behavioural 

patterns (Pereira 2007). Until now, studies on the spawning behaviour of Portuguese 

native cyprinids were only conducted for A. oligolepis and A. occidentale (Pereira 

2007), Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum (Carvalho et al. 2003), Pseudochondrostoma 

polylepis (Robalo et al. 2003), Squalius pyrenaicus (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b) and 

Squalius alburnoides (Sousa-Santos et al. 2006).  

One example of how these studies may have implications for species 

conservation is the captive breeding of S.  pyrenaicus at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium: 

after two years without spawning, this species finally reproduced when the tank was 

supplemented with coarse substratum (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b). The existence of 

preferred substrates is common among cyprinids (e.g. Johnston 1999) and, thus, 

preserving those spawning grounds may be crucial for species recruitment and 

ultimately for species survival. Regarding A. occidentale, Pereira (2007) found some 

evidence of preference for egg laying on plants when studying a group of breeding fish 

in a small aquarium. However, it is important to test this preference at a larger scale and 

with a higher number of individuals, so that captive breeding may be optimized and 

substrate preference for spawning may be taken into account when choosing sites for 

restocking of wild populations of A. occidentale. 

Life history patterns should also be taken into account for effective conservation 

measures to protect threatened species (Aparicio and Sostoa 1998). In particular, 

knowledge of variation in traits such as age and sex composition, growth in length and 

weight, length-weight relationships, somatic condition, spawning time and age of 

maturity and fecundity is particularly important. (Andreu-Soler et al. 2006, Miranda et 

al. 2006, Sarkar et al. 2013).  For instance, analyses of growth and condition of A. 

occidentale along habitat gradients will provide significant insights on which sites are 

more favourable to the growth of juveniles and, consequently, potentially configure 

releasing sites during restocking actions.

1.5. Objectives 

This work follows a multidisciplinary approach to gather some baseline but essential 

information on habitat use, growth and reproductive behaviour of wild and captive 

populations of A. occidentale, which may contribute to improve the efficiency of future 

restocking of their natural populations. Specific aims were to (i) quantify relative 

abundances, age and condition of fish in persistent pools that can act as summer refugia 

for this species, and habitat factors that may influence these; (ii) analyze the growth 

patterns of captive populations and compare them with those of wild populations; and 

(iii) describe the reproductive behaviour of A. occidentale in captivity and assess 

substrate preferences for spawning. 

Concealing all the data gathered, this work will contribute with key aspects on 

the ecology of A. occidentale and on the differences in population traits between wild 

and captive populations, which might be useful to achieve more efficient reinforcements 

under the scope of the ongoing ex situ conservation program and, consequently, to the 

conservation of the species.

2. STUDY AREA 
 

The Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers, ranging from 18 to 37 km in length 

(Figure 1.1), are shaped by highly seasonal flows, showing reduced or no flow in the 

summer and large floods in the winter. During the summer, the streams are often 

reduced to a series of disconnected pools, which represent the only chance of fish to 

persist by acting as refugia and as sources of recruits or colonists for the entire system, 

after flow resumption at the end of the dry season (Magalhães et al. 2002, Pires et al. 

2014). 

Moreover, these rivers face strong habitat destruction and pollution, especially 

due to sewage from pig farms, distilleries, and agricultural and urban discharges 

(Robalo et al. 2005, Robalo et al. 2008). Indeed, the Alcabrichel River has been 

classified as highly degraded, based on the results obtained for the biotic index based on 

macroinvertebrates IBMWP (Teixeira et al. 2008) and the Safarujo River is known to 

dry out almost completely in years of severe droughts. Indeed, the population of A. 

occidentale of the Safarujo River was thought to be extinct until 2011 (Sousa-Santos 

personal communication). 

There is also a high abundance of Arundo donax along the margins of these 

streams, preventing native vegetation from growing and stabilizing the river banks 

(Figure 2.1). Riparian vegetation is sparse and constantly under removal (ARHTejo 

2011), and includes the narrow-leaved ash Fraxinus angustifolia, the white poplar 

Populus alba and the willow Salix salvifolia. 

Besides A. occidentale, fish assemblages include the European Eel Anguilla 

anguilla and the loach Cobitis paludica. The presence of exotic fish species was not 

reported so far. The invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is also abundant 

in the studied rivers.

3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 

3.1. Survey of wild populations in summer refugia 

Surveys of wild populations of A. occidentale were conducted at the end of the dry 

season, immediately before the rains, when fish remain gathered in persistent pools, 

which act as summer refugia and sources of colonization for the entire rivers after flow 

resumption. Specifically, surveys for fish and habitat conditions in persistent pools, 

were conducted between 11
th

 September and 8
th

 October 2014 in the Alcabrichel, 

Sizandro and Safarujo rivers. 

The upper and medium courses of the each river were prospected by car in order 

to map (WGS84 datum coordinate system) all the pools persisting in the channel. Lower 

courses of the rivers were not surveyed because they show high habitat degradation and 

poor water quality, and thus are not suitable for future restocking actions. The 

prospected stretches in the upper and medium courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and 

Sarafujo Rivers were approximately 13.75, 15.60 and 11.24 km long, respectivelly. 

Overall, 14 pools persisted in the Alcabrichel (6), Sizandro (3) and Safarujo (5) rivers - 

Figure 3.1.

Fish sampling was performed with a SAMUS725G electrofishing portable 

device. Each pool was slowly prospected in a zigzag manner from the downriver to the 

upriver edge. In order to get an estimate of the fish relative abundance, time of fishing 

was roughly proportional to pool size (Appendix II). All captured fish were maintained 

in permanently aerated buckets, measured (fork length, nearest millimetre) and 

weighted (total body weight, nearest gram), and three scales were taken from 

individuals with over 40 mm length, from the third scale row below the dorsal fin 

(Appendix III). The scales were stored in field sheets with scotch tape for 

transportation and posterior age and growth analyses (see section 3.3). The dorsal fin of 

each fish was inspected for the presence of a horizontal scar (mark used to identify 

individuals bred in captivity - see section 1.3). Finally, all individuals were returned to 

the river.  

The habitat at each pool was described using 15 variables: maximum length (in 

meters), maximum width (in centimetres), maximum depth (in centimetres), area (in 

m
2
), volume (in m

3
), macrophytes’ coverage, instream coverage and detritus abundance 

(0: 0%, 1:&amp;lt;30%, 2: 30-60%, 3: &gt;60%), dominant substrate [(1: silt (4-64) µm, 2: sand 

(64 µm-2 mm), 3: gravel (2-64 mm), 4: cobbles (64-256 mm), 5: boulders (&gt;256 mm)], 

substrate heterogeneity (number of substrate categories), water temperature (in ºC), 

ammonia (in mg/L), nitrites (in mg/L), nitrates (in mg/L) and pH (Table 3.1). Photos of 

some of the procedures used to determine habitat variables can be found in Appendix 

IV.

The area and volume of the pools were calculated by approximation to an 

ellipsoid, as follows: 

        
              

 
 

   

 

       
 

 
      

where a, b and c represent, respectively, the maximum length, width and depth of each 

pool, and p (relative error=1.61) the maximum relative error associated with the 

approximation to an ellipsoid (Xu et al. 2009). 

3.2. Survey of captive populations 

Captive populations of A. occidentale maintained at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium 

(AVG) and at the Campelo Station (CS) were surveyed between March and April 2015. 

In order to minimize the disturbance of these populations, only a small number of 

individuals were sampled for fork-length and scale analyses (Table 3.2).  

After lowering the water level, the tanks were prospected with hand nets and the 

captured fish were maintained in permanently aerated buckets. All fish with at least 40 

mm were measured (fork-length, nearest millimetre) and three scales from the third 

scale row below the dorsal fin were collected.

3.3. Age and growth 

Age was determined through scale reading, by counting the number of annuli, 

corresponding to the number of years (Chilton and Beamish 1982). Scales were 

mounted on microscope slides with a water drop and the annuli were interpreted. Scale 

and annuli radiuses were measured in the right side of the anterior field of the scale, 

which generally showed low pigmentation and clear evidence of annuli (Figure 3.2). 



20 

 

Measurements were performed using Motic Images Plus software (Motic China Group, 

version 2.0). 

Fork-length at age i was back-calculated from linear regression equations, 

following the body-proportional hypothesis described by Rasmussen et al. (1996).  

Equations used in calculations are presented in Appendix V.

plus blue line) radiuses in a scale taken from a 1+ specimen caught during the summer refugia survey. 

Radiuses were measured to the right anterior edge of the scale. The centre and right anterior edge of each 

scale were determined by establishing a 75º angle between two auxiliary lines (in grey). 

3.4. Reproductive behaviour 

Observations of the spawning behaviour of A. occidentale were conducted with a 

captive population from the Safarujo River, founded with 12 wild adults in 2013, at the 

Vasco da Gama Aquarium. In 2015, this captive population consisted of 369 

individuals, 44 of which were adults (&gt;70 mm fork-length) and 325 were juveniles (&lt;70 

mm fork-length). As reproductive behaviour is not performed by juveniles, only adults 

were considered for this study. Mature females were identified by their swollen 

abdomen, whereas mature males were recognized by their fusiform body, presence of 

nuptial tubercles in the head and conspicuous behaviours performed towards females. 

The experimental tank (designated as T9 in Figure 3.3) had a capacity of 3120 L 

(500x195x32 cm), continuous water supply and regulation, and two permanent air 



21 

 

sources to maintain regular levels of dissolved O2. Because the captive breeding of this 

species followed a naturalistic approach (described in detail in Sousa-Santos et al. 

2014a), bricks and a cage with a small mesh diameter were placed in the tank in order to 

provide shelter for juveniles and larvae, respectively. A wood pier was also present to 

provide shading to about one third of the tank, resembling the instream coverage 

provided by the riparian gallery in wild habitats. The tank was also supplied with pots 

containing aquatic plants with abundant submerged roots (Cyperus alternifolius, 

Echinodorus sp., Egeria densa, Elodea sp. and Typha latifolia) - see Figure 3.4. 

 

Figure 3.3. Schematic sketch of the ex situ conservation facility at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium, The 

observations on the spawning behaviour of A. occidentale were conducted in tank T9. 

Fish behaviour was recorded with an underwater camera (Nikon Coolpix 

AW100) placed in fixed positions to minimize disturbance and stress. The quantitative 

analysis of the reproductive behaviour data was preceded by a period of informal 

observations (from 11
th

 December 2014 to 25
th

 March 2015), aiming at defining the 

typical behaviour of the species off the reproductive season, and by a period of 

preliminary observations (from April 2
nd

 to April 30
th

), aiming at defining the 

behavioural patterns associated with reproductive behaviour and determining the 

ethogram of the species, as advised by Martin and Bateson (1986). The period of 

preliminary observations began when males started performing typical reproductive 

behaviours, namely long runs and female chasing (described in detail by Pereira 2007). 



22 

 

After the description of the ethogram of the species, observations of the 

reproductive behaviour were carried out (from 5
th

 May 2015 to 24
th

 May 2015) during 

three periods of the day to account for eventual variations of fish activity throughout the 

day: i) 8h30 to 11h30, ii) 11h30 to 14h30, and iii) 15h00 to 18h00. As feeding took 

place between 14h30 and 15h00 thrice a week, no records were taken during that time 

period to avoid bias in behaviour due to feeding.  

Substrate preferences for spawning were assessed using an experimental design 

similar to that described by Pereira (2007). Within each of the time periods described 

above, recording sessions with 20 minutes of duration were conducted at three distinct 

substrate sites (each site was sampled once or twice): plants, wool spawning mops (see 

Appendix VI) and gravel. The aquatic camera used to record observations was placed 

at 27 cm depth when sampling the sites with plants and wool mops, and at 22 cm depth 

when sampling the gravel site. In each recording session, the absolute frequency of the 

behaviours described in the ethogram was quantified.

of A. occidentale from Sajarujo, at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium. Left: sampling sites occupied by plants 

(PZ), wool spawning mops (WZ) and gravel (GZ); Right: location of the camera to record reproductive 

behaviours occurring in wool spawning mops (WR), gravel (GR) and plants (PR). Arrows indicate the

To assess the eventual effect of temperature and light in the onset of 

reproductive behaviours of A. occidentale, one data logger (Hobo
®
 Pendant UA-002) 

was installed in the experimental tank on 9
th

 April 2015. Data concerning water 

temperature (in ºC) and light quantity (in lux) were automatically recorded every four 

hours (7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00) until the end of the study (24
th

 May 

2015).

3.5. Data analyses 

Data analyses focused on quantifying variation in population traits between wild and 

captive populations and on assessing patterns on the reproductive behaviour of A. 

occidentale.  Prior to analyses, data were assessed for normality and homogeneity, and 

non-parametric statistics were used when these assumptions were not met. Significance 

of statistical testing was assessed at p&lt;0.05 and analyses were conducted using the R 

software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 3.0.3) and STATISTICA 

software (Dell Inc., version 12). Statistical procedures are detailed in sections 3.5.1 and 

3.5.2. 

 

3.5.1.  Relative abundance of fish in summer refugia 

The number of fish caught in each pool was used to index its relative abundance, and 

further related to habitat gradients prevailing in the study area. Principal Components 

Analysis (PCA) was used to describe the main gradients of variation in habitat 

conditions. To avoid bias in the ordination, all habitat variables that were not measured 

in all persistent pools (n=14, see Table 3.1), i.e. ammonia and pH, were excluded from 

the analyses. Likewise, maximum length and width were also excluded, because they 

were considered for both pool area and volume calculations, To minimize collinearity 

problems, whenever pairs of habitat variables were strongly correlated (Pearson’s r, |r| ? 

0.80; Appendix VII), only the variable most correlated with relative abundance from 

each pair was retained for analyses. Principal components (PC) axes were then used as 

explanatory variables in linear regression analyses relating fish relative abundance to 

habitat gradients. 

 

3.5.2.  Fork-length distributions and condition factor in wild populations 

Fork-length distributions were built for each population by pooling data from persistent 

pools. Size class amplitude used in histograms was of 2 mm.  

Condition factor for each individual was determined using the scaled mass index 

(SMI), following the procedure described by Peig and Green (2009). Specifically, the 

SMI was calculated using the following formula adapted from Peig and Green (2009), 

       
   
   

 
    

 



24 

 

where W is the measured weight, FL0 the observed mean fork-length in each river, FLi 

the fork-length measured for each individual and bSMI the slope of the linear regression 

equation of weight and fork-length log-transformed data. 

The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for variation in fork-length and in the 

SMI among populations, and the post hoc Dunn test was performed whenever 

significant differences were found. Fish length at each pool (mean, minimum and 

maximum) was related to habitat gradients extracted from PC axes using linear 

regression analyses. 

 

3.5.3.  Age and growth 

The back-calculated lengths at age i were compared among wild and captive 

populations  by using the one-way ANOVA test, followed by the Tukey post hoc test 

whenever significant differences were found. Comparisons between wild and captive 

populations were also conducted using either the t-test (for the Alcabrichel and Safarujo 

populations) or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (for the Sizandro population). 

 

3.5.4.  Factors shaping reproductive behaviour 

To test whether the frequency of behaviours across substrates was independent of the 

time period during which the observations were recorded, a chi-square of independence 

was performed. A chi-square test of homogeneity was also used to test for variation of 

the frequency of behaviours amongst substrates. In both cases, behaviours with 

frequencies below 5 were excluded from analysis to avoid lowering inference reliability 

(Roscoe and Byars 1971). 

The pooled absolute frequencies of each behaviour per day, taken as an indicator 

of the fish reproductive activity, were plotted against the average daily temperature and 

light incidence to assess eventual associations between fish activity and 

temperature/light incidence.

 (in Sizandro) in 

area and between 4.83 m
3
 (in Safarujo) and 63.38 m

3
 (in Alcabrichel) in volume (Table 

4.1). In average, pools in the Alcabrichel River showed the highest water volume and 

were the longest and deepest, while pools in the Sizandro River were the largest in area 

and width, the shallowest and the ones with the highest instream and macrophytes’ 

coverages. The pools in the Safarujo River were, in average, the smallest in area, 

volume, length and width and the ones with the lowest macrophytes’ coverage. 

Substrate was dominated by silt  in Alcabrichel and by sand in the Sizandro and 

Safarujo rivers. The average amount of nitrites and nitrates was higher in the 

Alcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, whilst ammonia was higher in the Sarafujo 

(0.12±0.16); average pH ranged between 7.36 in Alcabrichel and 8.00 in Sizandro.

Correlation analyses showed that volume and nitrites were strongly correlated 

with area and nitrates (r&gt;0.80), respectively, but less correlated with fish relative 

abundance than their respective pair (see Appendix VII). In these circunstamces, 

volume and area were not further considered in the ordination. 

The first three componens of the PCA explained 65.5% of the variation in the 

habitat data (Table 4.2). The first component (PC1, 25.2% of total variance) reflected a 

gradient of increasing water temperature, macrophytes’ coverage and nitrates, and 

decreasing depth. PC2 explained 21.3% of total variance and was associated with 

increasing detritus abundance and decreasing substrate size. Finally, PC3 explained 

19.0% of total variance and was positively associated with pool area and substrate 

heterogeneity.

The PC1 contrasted persistent pools SIZ3 and ALC2 having lower depths and 

higher water temperatures, macrophytes’ coverage and nitrates with pools SAF1, SAF4 

and ALC 4 e ALC5 (Figure 4.2). These later two pools showed the highest abundance 

of detritus and smaller substrates, contrasting with SAF1 and SIZ2 along PC2 (Figure 

4.2). ALC5 and SIZ3 showed larger areas and higher substrate heterogeneity, in 

opposition to SAF2 and SAF3 along PC3 (Figure 4.2).

4.2. Fish relative abundance in summer refugia 

A total of 1005 individuals were caught in the 14 persistent pools found in the 

Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers (Figure 4.3). The number of fish per pool 

ranged from 9 individuals at SAF3 to 271 at SIZ3), with the average number of 

individuals per pool ranging between 27.0 in Safarujo and 164.7 in Sizandro (Table 

4.3). The highest fish relative abundance values were detected at one of the restocking 

sites of the Alcabrichel River and dowstream from the restocking site for the Sizandro 

River (Figure 4.3). 

Only 4 individuals had a clear horizontal scar in the dorsal fin, indicative of 

being from a captive facility: three at SIZ2 (fork-length ranging from 78 mm to 106 

mm) and one at ALC6 (102 mm fork-length).

4.3. Length of fish in wild populations 

Individuals caught in persistent pools ranged in fork length from 18 mm at Alcabrichel 

(ALC2) to 130 mm at Sizandro (SIZ1), with an average size per population ranging 

between 45.5 mm in Alcabrichel and 55.5 mm in Safarujo (Table 4.3). SAF2 showed 

the lowest variability in fork-length (SD=3.4), ranging from 30 to 41 mm, while ALC1 

and ALC4 had the highest ranges (SD=22.8). The highest mean was attained at ALC1 

(63.3 mm), followed by SAF3 (59.8 mm), ALC5 (55.7 mm) and ALC6 (55.0 mm) - see 

Table 4.4.

The mean and minimum fork-length of fish were not associated with any of the 

PC axes (0.00&lt;R

, 0.543&lt;F&lt;2.495, 0.475&lt;p&lt;0.140), but maximum fork-length 

showed a negative association with PC2 (R
2
=0.31, F=5.366, p&lt;0.039). 

Mean fork-length obtained for the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations showed 

the highest values in two persistent pools that were targets of restocking actions: ALC1 

(restocked twice, in 2011 and 2013, SMI=63.3 ± 22.8) and SIZ1 (restocked once, in 

2013, SMI=54.1 ± 19.6), respectively.

Overall, the populations from Alcabrichel and Sizandro presented bimodal 

length distributions, with modes in the 20-40 and 60-80 mm in the Alcabrichel and in 

the 40-60 and 60-80 mm in the Sizandro (Figure 4.4). Contrastingly, the distribution 

obtained for the Safarujo population was approximately normal, with the mode in the 

40-60 mm class (Figure 4.4).

Sizandro and Safarujo rivers. Size class amplitude is 2 mm. Note of caution: the scale in the ordinate 

differs among populations. 

There were significant variations in fork-length among rivers (H=70.209, 

p&lt;0.000) with fish from the Sizandro and Safarujo populations being larger than those 

from the Alcabrichel population (Dunn post hoc test, p&lt;0.000) - see Figure 4.5.

4.4. Fish condition in wild populations 

Fish condition, estimated by the scaled mass index, also showed significant variations 

among rivers (H=63.178, p&lt;0.000), with fish from the Sizandro (SMI = 9.90 ± 3.15) 

and Safarujo (SMI=11.73 ± 3.43) populations having a significantly higher condition 

than those from the Alcabrichel (SMI = 7.88 ± 2.81) - Dunn test, p&lt;0.05. 

Two of the highest mean SMI values were obtained for pools where restocking 

actions took place: ALC1 and SIZ1, respectively, with SMI = 4.91 and SMI = 4.75 

(Table 4.5). The third location where fishes bred in captivity were released (ALC2), 

however, showed the lowest mean SMI value among all the pools sampled (SMI = 0.74, 

see Figure 4.6).

4.5. Age and growth of fish in wild and captive populations 

In wild populations, fish were aged from 0+ (born in 2014) to 4+ (born in 2009) and, in 

all persistent pools, 0+ individuals were the most abundant, except in ALC 6 (1+). Fish 

aged 5+ were only found in the captive populations of Alcabrichel and Safarujo kept, 

respectively, at the Campelo Station and Vasco da Gama Aquarium (see Table 4.6). 

The highest annual increment in fork-length was attained on the first year of life 

in all populations (Table 4.6). Back-calculated length at age 1 varied significantly 

among rivers in wild with all populations (F=143.75, p&lt;0.000), with all populations 

differing from each other (Tukey post hoc test, p&lt;0.05). Among captive populations, 

there were also significant differences (F=13.99, p&lt;0.000), but only the Sizandro 

population was significantly different from the Alcabrichel and Safarujo specimens 

(Tukey post hoc test, p&lt;0.05). Fish from the Sizandro population showed the highest 

mean fork-length at age 1 (FL = 72 ± 2 mm) and those from the Alcabrichel the lowest 

value at the same age (FL = 56 ± 1 mm) - see Table 4.6. 

When comparing wild and captive populations of the same river, significant 

differences were found for all rivers. Individuals were significantly smaller in wild 

populations of the Alcabrichel (T=-6.273, p&lt;0.000) and Safarujo (T=-4.262, p&lt;0.000) 

than in their respective captive populations, whereas for the Sizandro individuals of the 

captive population were smaller than the wild ones (Z=-4.805, p&lt;0.000).

4.6. Ethogram of reproductive behaviours 

Four out of the five behaviours described in Pereira (2007) were also found during the 

period of preliminary observations: 

? Follow - a male follows a female with his snout close to her tail fin or parallel to 

its body, without touching her and with no alterations on the movement of both 

individuals; 

? Chase - a male pursues an evading female; 

? Touch - a male follows a female with his snout close to her tail fin or parallel to 

its body, touching her in the ventral zone; 

? Pressure - one or more males try to push a female to the bottom of the tank. 

During this period, egg release was visualized only once, on 2
nd

 April 2015, near 

a plant pot. After being pressed against the ground of the tank by several males, the 

spawning female started shaking its body and released several eggs. It was not 

perceptible if the eggs adhered to the plants, as the angle caught by the camera was 

insufficient. Moreover, the fixed placement of the underwater camera prevented the 

video recording of other egg laying events and of complete pre-spawning and spawning 

ethological sequences. Fish larvae were first detected on 9
th

 May 2015. 

4.7. Quantification of reproductive behaviours 

A total of 77 events of the described reproductive behaviours were observed in 

35 of the 90 recording sessions. In the remaining 55 sessions, no reproductive 

behaviours were recorded. Most of the behaviours occurred in the proximity of plants 

(53 out of 77) and during the 11h30-14h30 sampling period (38 out of 77) - see Table 

4.7. 

Table 4.7. Absolute frequencies of the reproductive behaviours per substrate and sampling period. Only 

frequencies marked in bold were considered for the chi-square test of independence (?5).

The most frequent behaviour was “Chase” in plants and gravel substrates, and 

“Chase” and “Follow” in wool spawning mops (Table 4.8).

When performing the chi-square test of independence, the 8h30-11h30 time 

period was excluded from the analysis due to frequencies lower than 5 (see Table 4.7). 

The absolute frequency of the observed behaviours was found to be substrate-dependent 

(?
2
=7.904, p&lt;0.005), but independent from the sampling period (?

2
=0.055, p&lt;0.815). 

The peak of fish activity was on 8
th

 May, with 35 behaviours recorded. The data 

logger records show that, considering the period of spawning behaviour quantification 

(5
th

 May to 24
th

 May 2015), the second highest temperature (23.13ºC) and the third 

highest light quantity (34157 lux) were registered on 8
th

 May - see Figure 4.7). 

However, no significant association was detected between the frequency of behaviours 

and temperature and light (Table 4.9).

5. DISCUSSION 
 

The combination of deterministic and stochastic factors that negatively affect species 

survival may result in their extinction (Frankham 2005). Often the impact of these 

factors is evidenced by considerable reductions of the effective population size and low 

levels of genetic diversity (e.g. Hedrick 2001, Blomqvist et al. 2010, McCusker and 

Bentzen 2013). To overcome this problem and, consequently, minimize the risk of 

extinction, threatened populations should be reinforced since demographic, rather than 

genetic factors, may be of more immediate importance in the short term (Caro and 

Laurenson 1994, Caughley 1994, Brook et al. 2002). Indeed, it is argued that 

populations that are declining rapidly or that are already small sized are more prone to 

destabilization due to interacting stochastic processes, such as unbalanced sex ratios, 

unstable age class distributions or habitat loss, than larger populations (Lacy 2000, 

Brook et al. 2002). The reduction of the individual fitness due to small population size 

or low density (Allee effect) is frequently a problem for endangered species and, thus, 

restocking can be used to provide higher long-term chances of survival (Griffith et al. 

1989, Champagnon et al. 2012).  

These theoretical expectations supported the enhancement of endangered 

populations of A. occidentale with captive bred individuals, in order to minimize their 

current risk of extinction in the wild. The data gathered in this thesis add to this view, 

and generally highlight that restocking already had some positive effects on wild 

populations of this species.  

The severe drought that occurred nearly after the description of A. occidentale, 

in 2005-2006 (García-Herrera et al. 2007), and precipitated the implementation of its ex 

situ conservation as a safeguard measure (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a), prevented the 

establishment of strong baseline data on the abundance of this species throughout its 

distribution range. Nevertheless, pilot surveys conducted in 2006 indicated that 

populations were small and fragmented, with the number of fish per summer pool in the 

Alcabrichel and Sizandro rivers never exceeding 40 individuals and no fish being found 

across the main course of the Safarujo River (C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). 

Contrastingly, during this study, much higher numbers of individuals per pool were 

found in the Alcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, likely reflecting the restocking actions 

conducted in 2011 and 2013 for population reinforcement purposes. A. occidentale was 



38 

 

also found in the Safarujo river, though in lower abundances, a positive sign considering 

it had been considered to be extinct after the 2005-2006 severe drought (Freyhof and 

Kottelat 2008, C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). 

These signs of population increment and recovery must, however, be taken with 

caution, since the desirable positive effect of restocking actions, habitat enhancement 

and water quality management must be evaluated in the medium and long term to 

account for the natural oscillations of abundance associated, for instance, with annual 

hydrological conditions as found for other cyprinids endemic to Iberian streams (e.g. 

Magalhães et al. 2007). 

 

5.1. Use of summer refugia 

Despite 2014 was a wet year with a “normal” hydrological summer (IPMA 2014, IPMA 

2015), summer refugia in the middle and upper courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and 

Safarujo rivers were restricted to a few persistent pools, generally with less than 70 m
3
. 

There was considerable variability in the number of fish congregated in each pool, 

suggesting that some pools may act as the main sources for river recolonization after the 

drought and should therefore be considered as potential locations for further restocking 

actions. This seemed to be particularly the case for pools ALC2 and SIZ3 in the 

Alcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, respectively, where more than 170 individuals were 

found, and generally in good condition.  

Overall, associations between fish and habitat conditions found in this thesis 

suggest that during normal hydrological years, A. occidentale wild populations may 

concentrate on shallower pools with high macrophytes’ coverage, similarly to what was 

assessed in other fish species (Dibble et al. 1997, Oscoz 2006). The obtained positive 

association with water temperature is most likely circumstantial, since values for this 

variable were collected in distinct periods of the day, in different dates. Contrastingly, 

the positive association of fish relative abundance with nitrates highlights that refugia 

more prone to harbour fish may also be heavily polluted. As such, during extreme 

droughts, these pools might configure precarious and unstable refugia for fish, as 

reduction in water persistence or slight deterioration of water quality through increased 

nitrates and/or decreased dissolved oxygen will likely imply massive fish loss. 

 

 



39 

 

5.2. Length and age structure of wild populations 

Besides its direct effect on increasing the size of wild populations, indirect effects of the 

restocking actions may include (i) the increment of population recruitment (released 

mature fish will contribute with their offspring to forthcoming generations); and (ii) a 

shift on the previous distribution of age classes. Regarding the first indirect effect, the 

absence of previous baseline data on the number of juveniles of A. occidentale produced 

per reproductive season prevents its assessment. Contrastingly, data collected during 

this study provide highlights regarding the effect of restocking actions on the 

distribution of age classes in wild populations. 

As the restocking of wild populations consisted in the release of hundreds of 

individuals 1+, 2+ and 3+ (as a result of three consecutive generations in captivity), it 

was expected that, after one year, the restocked populations will not only show higher 

than expected frequencies 2+, 3+ and 4+ individuals, but also of 0+ and 1+ individuals, 

as a result of the reproduction of the released mature fish. The bimodal length 

distributions obtained for the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations seemed to 

corroborate this hypothesis. Indeed, the combination of the obtained length frequency 

distributions and the back-calculated fork-length at ages 1 to 5 showed that 0+, 1+ and 

2+ fish dominate the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations. As the last and more 

expressive (in terms of the number of fish released) restocking actions were conducted 

in the Spring of 2013, mostly with F1 and F2 fish born in 2011 and 2012, it was 

expected that in the Fall of 2014 these fish (belonging to the age classes 1+, 2+ and 

eventually 3+ if the third annuli had already been deposited) and their offspring (0+ and 

eventually 1+) contributed to a high frequency of age classes 0+ to 2+ in wild 

populations, as seemed to be the case. 

Although only a low number of individuals bred in captivity were identified in 

the wild, this may at least be partially associated with difficulties in identifying post-cut 

regenerated fin rays in small cyprinids (Gosline 1978) resulting in underestimation of  

previously marked fish. The number of recaptures may also have been underestimated 

due to the fact that released individuals smaller than 50 mm fork-length were not 

marked. In these circumstances, it seems plausible to admit that the largest mean fork-

lengths and the highest condition values (SMI values) obtained for the restocking sites 

at the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations are at least partially related to the release of 

hundreds of captive bred fish at those sites. Future restocking actions should involve 



40 

 

more efficient individual marking (e.g. visible implant elastomer tags) to improve the 

estimation of recapture rates. 

 Regarding the summer refugia of the Safarujo River, the relative abundances of 

A. occidentale were lower than that of the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations, 

although showing a high representativeness of small fish. This suggests that the 

population of the Safarujo may be naturally, slowly recovering and that recruitment may 

be at place (see below). As the Safarujo River was only restocked in 2015, after the field 

work conducted during this study, future surveys are needed to clarify if this population 

reinforcement can also contribute to an increase in frequency of young, small fish. 

 

5.2. Age and growth patterns 

Scale reading analysis provided baseline data on age and growth of wild and captive 

populations of A. occidentale, which was unknown until the time of this work. The 

annuli counts revealed that the more aged specimens from wild populations were 4+ and 

that the oldest specimens were found in captive populations (5+). Mean back-calculated 

lengths and annual increments at age i were also higher in captive than in wild 

populations of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo rivers. Contrastingly, wild specimens from 

the Sizandro population showed the highest mean back-calculated lengths and annual 

increments at age i among all studied populations. 

Fish maintained in captivity are most likely under much less stressful conditions 

than those in their degraded natural habitats (e.g. Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). This seems 

to justify the higher growth of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo specimens in captivity and 

the higher fish condition values registered in two of the three persistent pools that were 

target of restocking actions. However, it does not explain why wild individuals from the 

Sizandro grew more than the captive ones from the same population. One possible 

reason relies on the lower temperatures found in the Campelo Station, where those 

captive individuals were maintained, as it is known that fish growth is generally 

strongly associated with temperature (e.g. Handeland et al. 2008). The results obtained 

for the Sizandro wild and captive populations must, however, be analysed with caution 

since the sample sizes were small. 

5.3. Reproductive behaviour 

The observed four reproductive behaviours were already described by Pereira 

(2007) as pre-spawning behaviours, which provided support to the observational data 



41 

 

presented herein and allowed further quantitative analyses. A fifth behaviour described 

by Pereira (2007) as “female plays dead” was not observed during this study, which 

may be explained by its low frequency of occurrence (reported by the author).  

As Pereira (2007) conducted her observations with a captive group of 14 

individuals from the Sizandro population, kept in a 90 L aquarium, the identification of 

the same reproductive behaviours also show that (i) A. occidentale shows a fixed pre-

spawning ethological repertoire; (ii) this repertoire is independent of the scale used, as it 

is similar whether the focal group of mature adults is reduced and kept in a small 

aquarium (as in Pereira 2007) or if the group is composed of hundreds of individuals 

kept in a large tank (as in this thesis); and (iii) visual cues will likely be important as 

female chasing and following by males are the most common components of the pre-

spawning sequence. 

The highest frequencies of the observed reproductive behaviours, in all sampling 

periods, were attained in plants, confirming that these may act as the preferred substrate 

for spawning, as suggested by Pereira (2007). This information highlights the 

importance of accounting for aquatic vegetation when selecting future restocking sites, 

with persistent pools with abundant aquatic vegetation likely displaying higher 

availability of proper substrate for spawning. 

Temperature and light quantity effects were also evaluated, because both can 

influence reproductive activity (King 1998 et al. 1998, Boeuf and Le Bail 1999), 

namely by being important for gonad maturation (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b). Although 

no significant associations were found between these two factors and the total frequency 

of reproductive behaviours per day, it was evident that the peak of reproductive activity 

was attained after a significant increase of temperature and light, from 7
th

 to 8

2015. Whether other external factors may also influence the onset of the reproductive 

activity is still to be evaluated. 

Although important behavioural data towards the conservation of A. occidentale 

were collected, there were two constraints in this study that should be circumvented in 

further studies. Specifically, the large volume of the tank (3120 L) did not allow the 

video recording of the whole study area by the underwater camera. Also, the option for 

placing the camera at fixed sites, although necessary to avoid disturbance and minimize 

fish stress, prevented the recording of complete reproductive sequences and spawning 

events which would have been possible to capture if the camera was displaced to follow 

the focal group of fish. Indeed, spawning was only visualized once, during the trial 



42 

 

observations, and although it was clear that the female abdomen was pressured against 

the ground (a behaviour herein described as “Pressure”) immediately before the 

spawning took place, A. occidentale females are also expected to spawn without being 

previously pressured to a rigid surface (Pereira 2007). The presence of a significantly 

high number of juveniles in the tank may also have led to an underestimation of 

reproductive behaviours, which were only quantified as such when performed by clearly 

recognized mature males and females.  

Future studies should be conducted in a tank with observation windows that 

would allow for the displacement of the camera by a hidden observer, to follow up the 

focal group of fish. This experimental setup will most likely provide additional data on 

the complete reproductive sequences that culminate in spawning and, more important, 

on male-female interactions during the courting, pre-spawning, spawning and post-

spawning periods. 

 

5.4. Final remarks and considerations for the future 

The specific objectives that were put forward for this thesis were accomplished and the 

obtained results may be summarized as follows: 

i) Summer refugia for A. occidentale consisted in a few small persistent pools in the 

middle and upper courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers. The 

macrophytes’ coverage was positively associated with fish relative abundance in 

summer refugia; as summer droughts increase the risk of fish loss, the identification 

and characterization of summer refugia used by this species provided fundamental 

baseline data to support future decisions and priorities regarding the 

implementation of habitat restoration measures and restocking actions. 

ii) Along with a population increment, restocking actions conducted at the Alcabrichel 

and Sizandro rivers also seem to be responsible for a high representativeness of 

younger age classes in the wild populations. 

iii) Fish raised in captivity seem to attain older ages, higher condition, larger mean 

back-calculated lengths and higher annual increments at age i than in the wild. 

iv) The reproductive behaviour of A. occidentale involves female chasing by males, 

highlighting the eventual importance of visual cues, and pre-spawning activity 

occurs preferably on aquatic plants, independently of the period of the day. 

 



43 

 

It is crucial that the supportive breeding of endangered species for restocking 

purposes is complemented with in situ conservation of the natural habitats, so that the 

released fish may found favourable conditions to disperse, find food and shelter, spawn 

and grow to maturity. As the main goal of this thesis was to provide recommendations 

and guidelines for the preservation of A. occidentale in its natural habitats, the gathered 

data allowed for the establishment of some considerations that should be taken into 

account in future restocking and restoration actions:  

(i) Since the water quality in the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers is still far 

from being good, some important habitat restoration and water management 

measures still need to be conducted in order to preserve summer refugia and, 

consequently, maximize the chances of recovery of A. occidentale populations. To 

improve habitat quality in the pools during the summer, it will be important to 

dredge sediments to increase depth; decrease the water temperature and evaporation 

rate by increasing instream coverage; limit water abstraction; prevent the discharge 

of pollutants; and set up surmountable transversal barriers to naturally improve 

oxygenation. Also, the eradication of Arundo donax, followed by the restoration of 

the native riparian gallery, would help stabilize the river bank, allowing the 

maintenance of a minimum flow level and providing shelters (e.g. roots of Populus 

alba) for juveniles. As dense and uninterrupted longitudinal corridors of A. donax 

prevented the access to the water course, especially in the case of the Sizandro 

River, their removal would also allow for the survey of other persistent pools that 

can act as summer refugia for A. occidentale. These recommendations should be 

taken into account in the delineation of future habitat restoration projects to avoid 

the uncontrolled removal of river bank vegetation, which often results in the 

degradation of summer refugia, including of pools that were already target of 

restocking actions, as was the case of ALC2 (see Appendix VIII); 

(ii) In future restocking actions, the fish to be released should be distributed by all the 

identified refugia, according to the water volume and abundance of aquatic 

vegetation available at the time in each pool. Precautions must also be taken 

regarding fish density in each pool, to avoid overloading pools that do not have the 

capacity to endure a high number of fish; 

 



44 

 

(iii) As the aquatic vegetation seems to be crucial for A. occidentale reproduction and 

population recruitment, its preservation should be promoted by environmental 

education actions and by providing technical assistance to the city councils in 

order to implement carefully designed river cleanup actions. The minimization of 

the erosion by the stabilization of the river banks and the preservation of aquatic 

vegetation will contribute to lower levels of water turbidity, which may be crucial 

if this species relies on visual cues for female courting by males, as suggested by 

the results obtained in this study. 

(iv) Finally, to assess the complete recovery of the three A. occidentale wild 

populations, it is important to survey fish abundance on an annual basis, in order 

to evaluate how the species is coping with the stochastic and deterministic 

stressors that may eventually compromise its survival.
