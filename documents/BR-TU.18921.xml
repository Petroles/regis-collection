Um método simples de eletroforese capilar de zona (CZE) foi desenvolvido e validado para 
análise de carbonato de lodenafila em comprimidos. A metodologia de superfície de resposta foi 
utilizada para a otimização do pH, concentração do tampão, voltagem e temperatura. O método 
utilizou como eletrólito, tampão borato 50 mmol L-1, pH 10, voltagem de 15 kV. A separação foi 
efetuada em capilar de sílica fundida mantida a 32,5 oC e o comprimento de onda de detecção foi 
de 214 nm. O método foi validado, demonstrando especificidade, linearidade (r = 0,9995), precisão 
(desvio padrão relativo inferior a 2%) e exatidão (99,95%). O método demonstrou ser robusto, 
através de avaliação por planejamento fatorial fracionário. O método CZE proposto foi aplicado 
com sucesso para a análise quantitativa de carbonato de lodenafila em comprimidos e os resultados, 
comparados com os métodos por cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência e espectrofotometria no 
ultravioleta, não apresentaram diferença significativa.

A simple capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method was developed and validated for the 
analysis of lodenafil carbonate in tablets. Response surface methodology was used for optimization 
of the pH and concentration of the buffer, applied voltage and temperature. The method employed 
50 mmol L-1 borate buffer at pH 10 as background electrolyte with an applied voltage of 15 kV. 
The separation was carried out in a fused-silica capillary maintained at 32.5 oC and the detection 
wavelength was 214 nm. The method was validated showing specificity, linearity (r = 0.9995), 
precision (relative standard deviation less than 2%) and accuracy (99.95%). The method proved to 
be robust by a fractional factorial design evaluation. The proposed CZE method was successfully 
applied for the quantitative analysis of lodenafil carbonate in tablets and the results compared to 
the high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods, showed 
non-significant differences.

Introduction 

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has become one 
of the most advanced separation techniques for 
pharmaceutical analysis, although quality control analysis 
of pharmaceuticals currently is performed predominantly 
with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).1,2 
It has been proven that CE is a useful and reliable 
alternative and a complementary technique to HPLC in 
many areas, including the determination of the active 
pharmaceutical ingredients, drug related impurities, 
enantiomeric separations, identity confirmation and 

stoichiometry determination.3-6 CE has many advantages 
such as high efficiency, high resolution, rapid analysis and 
low consumption of sample and reagents.7,8

The optimization of separation with CE is complex 
and difficult, because a high number of parameters, such 
as temperature, pH, voltage and buffer composition affect 
the separation. Rather than following the conventional 
monovariate approach used to adjust the parameters, thus 
involving a large number of independent analyses, one 
could advantageously replace the procedure by statistically 
designed experimental protocols, in which several factors 
are simultaneously varied. The use of an experimental 
design can be extremely beneficial in developing capillary 
electrophoretic methods.9

Response surface methodology is a collection of 
statistical and mathematical techniques useful for 
developing, improving and optimizing processes, 
interpreting the relationships between the responses and 
factor effects and simultaneously optimizing the levels of 
variables to achieve the best system performance.10,11

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined by the National 
Institutes of Health as the inability to achieve and maintain 
an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse.12 
ED is not a life-threatening disorder, but it influences the 
patient’s daily routine, social interactions, well-being and 
quality of life.13 It may often be the first manifestation of 
important systemic (in advancing age) or relational (in 
younger age) pathologies and it is considered a possible 
marker of clinically undiagnosed disease, thus representing 
the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of a systemic vascular disorder.14,15 

In 1998, a new class of drugs, the phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors) was introduced. The 
PDE5 inhibitors have revolutionized the way in which 
men with ED can be treated.16,17 The advent of these highly 
efficacious and relatively safe compounds had a profound 
impact on the diagnosis and treatment of ED.18

Lodenafil (bis-(2-{4-[4-ethoxy-3-(1-methyl-7-oxo-3-
propyl-6,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo [4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-
benzenesulfonyl]piperazin-1-yl}-ethyl) carbonate (Figure 1)  
is a PDE5 inhibitor developed in Brazil, which is a dimer 
formed by two lodenafil molecules linked by a carbonate 
bridge. Lodenafil carbonate (LOC) is a product that after 
ingestion delivers the active compound lodenafil.19,20

Little has been published until now concerning the 
detection of LOC in pharmaceutical preparations21,22 
and biological samples.19 These studies involve UV 
spectrophotometric and HPLC method for the determination 
of LOC.

This work proposes the development, optimization 
and validation of a capillary zone electrophoresis 

(CZE) method for the determination of LOC in tablets, 
establishing a comparison with the validated HPLC and 
UV spectrophotometric methods. 

Experimental 

Chemicals and reagents

LOC (lodenafil carbonate) used as reference substance 
was kin dly supplied by Cristália Produtos Químicos 
Farmacêuticos LTDA (São Paulo, Brazil) and nimesulide 
reference standard, used as internal standard (IS), was 
purchased from United States Pharmacopeia (USP, 
Rockville, USA). The tablets of Helleva® (Cristália 
Produtos Químicos Farmacêuticos LTDA, São Paulo, 
Brazil) containing LOC (80 mg per tablet, excipients: 
calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, povidone, lactose, 
colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium croscarmellose, 
microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate) 
were obtained commercially. All chemicals used were of 
pharmaceutical or special analytical grade. Throughout 
the study, water was obtained from a Milli-Q system from 
Millipore (Bedford, USA). Before analysis, all the solutions 
were filtered through 0.22 mm Millex filter (Millipore).

Apparatus and electrophoretic conditions

CZE (capillary zone electrophoresis) experiments 
were performed on an Agilent 3DCE apparatus (Agilent 
Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with an 
autosampler, a photodiode array (PDA) detector, and 
power supply able to deliver up to 30 kV. CE ChemStation 
software was used for instrument control, data acquisition 
and analysis. 

Electrophoretic separations were carried out with a 
fused-silica capillary with 50 ?m i.d. and 48.5 cm of total 
length (effective length 40 cm), thermostatized at 32.5 oC, 
and with detection set at 214 nm using a PDA detector. 
Hydrodynamic injection of sample was performed at 
50 mbar for 5 s and a constant voltage of 15 kV was applied 
during the analysis. At the beginning of each working 
day, the capillary was rinsed sequentially with 0.1 mol L-1 
sodium hydroxide for 15 min, followed by water for 15 min, 
and then with running electrolyte solution for 15 min. 
To achieve high migration time reproducibility between 
injections, the capillary was conditioned with 0.1 mol L-1 
sodium hydroxide (2 min), water (1 min), and a running 
BGE solution (2 min). Because electrolysis can change the 
electroosmotic flow (EOF) and affect the migration time, 
efficiency, and selectivity, the running electrolyte solution 
was replaced by a fresh solution after every three injections.

Background electrolyte solution preparation 

The optimized background electrolyte (BGE) solution 
used in this analysis was 50 mmol L-1 boric acid at pH 10. 
To prepare this solution 0.154 g of boric acid was diluted 
with 40 mL of water. The pH was adjusted to 10 by adding 
0.1 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide and the volume completed 
to 50 mL with ultrapure water. The solution was daily 
prepared and filtered.

Preparation of reference substance solutions

Standard stock solution of LOC was prepared by 
accurately weighing 10 mg of LOC transferred to a 100 mL 
volumetric flask with 0.1 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide 
(100 ?g mL-1). A standard stock solution of nimesulide 
(1 mg mL-1) was prepared in methanol. All solutions were 
stored at 2-8 oC, protected from light and diluted daily to 
an appropriate concentration with background electrolyte 
solution. 

Sample preparation

Twenty tablets of Helleva® were finely powdered. A 
weighed portion of the powder, equivalent to 10 mg of 
LOC was transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask. With 
the addition of 50 mL of sodium hydroxide, the mixture 
was sonicated for 10 min, and filtered. The sample 
stock solution prepared with the final concentration of 
100 ?g mL-1 of LOC was stored at 2-8 oC, protected from 
light and diluted daily to an appropriate concentration 
with BGE. 

Statistical software and design of experiment for method 
optimization

All the experimental designs, graphical and statistical 
analysis of the data were performed by Minitab 14 (Minitab 
Inc, State College, PA, USA) data analysis software system.

Factorial designs are the most useful schemes for 
the optimization of variables with a limited number of 
experiments. A variety of factorial designs are available 
to accomplish this task. The most successful and best 
among them is the central composite design, which is 
accomplished by adding two experimental points along 
each coordinate axis at opposite sides of the origin and at a 
distance equal to the semi-diagonal of the hyper cube of the 
factorial design and new extreme values (?; low and high) 
for each factor added in this design. This first experimental 
design was carried out to optimize the electrophoretic 
conditions with high sensitivity, efficiency and short run 

time. A second order polynomial was used to fit the data. 
Treatment allocation with their respective experimental 
values is shown in Table 1.

Validation

To demonstrate the suitability of this method for 
pharmaceutical quality control, it was validated with 
respect to specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and 
robustness, according to the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) recommendations, at the optimized 
operating conditions.23

Specificity
The specificity of the method was investigated by 

analyzing a placebo solution containing all the tablet 
components except LOC. In addition, the specificity was 
assessed by observing potential interferences between 
LOC and degradation products obtained, when standard 
solutions of LOC were stressed by acidic, basic, oxidative 
and UV light conditions. Solutions of LOC in 1.0 mol L-1 
hydrochloric acid and 1.0 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide 
were exposed at 60 ºC for 5 h. Oxidative degradation 
was induced by storing the solutions in 0.1% potassium 
permanganate at room temperature for 15 min, protected 
from light. Photolytic studies were done by exposing 
the sample solution to a 254 nm UV lamp for 15 min, 
in a photostability chamber. The samples were analyzed 
against a freshly prepared control sample (with no 
degradation treatment). 

Linearity 
Linearity was tested on three different days at 7 

concentration levels of LOC (20-80 mg mL-1) and spiked 
with a constant concentration of nimesulide (50 ?g mL-1) 
used as internal standard. Each concentration level was 
injected in triplicate. The peak area ratio of LOC reference 
substance to the IS, against the respective reference 
concentrations, was used for plotting the graph, and the 
linearity was evaluated by the least square regression 
analysis.

Precision
The precision expressed as the relative standard 

deviation of peak area measurements was evaluated under 
repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. For 
repeatability studies, six replicate experiments were 
carried out on the same day. The intermediate precision 
was performed by comparing the results of the assay on 
3 different days.

Accuracy
The accuracy of the developed method was evaluated 

by a recovery test. The sample solutions were fortified 
with three known concentrations of reference standard 
corresponding to 75, 100 and 125% of the sample 
concentration (50 mg mL-1).

Robustness
In order to study the simultaneous variation of 

the factors in the considered responses, a multivariate 
approach using design of experiments is recommended in 
robustness testing. The procedure selected was a 2-level 24-1 
fractional factorial design performed by the selection of 
four factors, studied at two levels (high and low): borate 
buffer concentration (48; 52 mmol L-1), pH borate buffer 
(9.8; 10.2), capillary temperature (31; 34 ºC), and voltage 
(13; 17 kV). The ranges examined were small deviations 
from the method settings. A center point with the optimized 
conditions was also added to the factorial design (nine 
experiments). The response is the percentage of LOC in 
the tablets (relative to their label claimed concentration) 
obtained by the comparison with the reference solution 
in each experiment. All experiments were performed in 
randomized order to minimize the effects of uncontrolled 
factors that may introduce a bias into the response. The 
statistical analyses of the data were performed by the 
MINITAB 14 (Minitab Inc, State College, PA, USA) data 
analysis software.

Results and Discussion 

The optimization of a CZE separation condition is a 
critical step, since the wide array of variables, such as applied 
voltage, buffer composition and temperature, can influence 
the separation efficiency, migration time and resolution.24 
Central composite designs are by far the most widely used 
methods for the optimization of CZE separations since they 
offer the possibility of evaluating the curvature of the data 
and fitting the experimental points to response surfaces.25 

The CZE method parameters for determination of the 
LOC were optimized to obtain the best efficiency, symmetry 
and resolution within the minimum analysis time. The 

optimization procedure was comprised of two steps: initial 
experiments and experimental design.

The aim of the initial experiments was to establish 
the basic analytical requirements (pH range, type of 
buffer) of the method. Some buffer systems containing 
sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, 
sodium tetraborate, ammonium acetate or boric acid 
were investigated in the pH range from 5-10 at different 
concentrations (10-50 mmol L-1). The use of borate buffer 
at a concentration of 50 mmol L-1 with pH value around 
10 (at a temperature of 32.5 ºC, 12.5 kV) resulted in high 
sensitivity and good peak symmetry of LOC. 

After a small number of runs and the selection of basic 
electrophoretic conditions, a central composite design was 
applied to optimize the main variables that could influence 
the LOC analyses by CZE: pH borate buffer, borate 
buffer concentration, capillary temperature and voltage. 
A response surface methodology was carried out to obtain 
more information and to investigate the behavior of the 
response around the nominal values of the factors. Response 
surface methodology has the following advantages: (i) to 
allow a complete study where all interaction effects are 
estimated, and (ii) to give an accurate description of an 
experimental region around a center of interest with validity 
of interpolation.26,27 The criterion to select the optimum 
values for the studied variables was based on obtaining 
a maximum for a multiple response function established, 
since LOC were easily separated from degradation products 
showing adequate efficiency (number of theoretical plates), 
tailing factor and short analysis time. Experiments were 
performed according to the experimental plan determined 
by Minitab software. Significant changes in migration time 
and tailing factor were observed for all the combinations, 
implying that these variables significantly affected the 
electrophoretic pattern.

From the optimization procedure, pH, buffer 
concentration and separation voltage were found significant 
on efficiency with optimum values of 50 mmol L-1 borate 
buffer at pH 10 with an applied voltage of 15 kV and 
capillary temperature of 32.5 ºC. Under these conditions, 
efficiencies higher than 80000, good symmetry (around 
1.0) and lower migration time (approximately 4 min) were 
achieved. Some of the estimated response surfaces from 
which the above mentioned optimum values have been 
obtained are shown in Figure 2.

potentially interfering sample components or degradation 
products. The specificity was evaluated by stressing the 
analyte under acidic, basic, oxidative and photolytic 
conditions. Chromatographic runs of a placebo solution 
were also performed. Figure 3 shows that the acidic, basic 
and oxidative conditions resulted in a decreased area 
without any additional peak, indicating that the degradation 
products (DP) were not detected by UV or the degradation 
products did not migrate in the CZE method. The photolytic 
condition exhibited a significant decrease of the area, and 
two additional peaks were detected at 5.8 and 6.3 min 
(Figure 3). In all cases the purity of LOC was assessed with 
the PDA detector, demonstrating that the proposed method 
is specific for the analysis. The chromatographic run of a 
placebo solution showed no interference of the excipients 
with the elution of LOC.

Linearity
Linearity was investigated in the concentration range of 

20-80 mg mL-1 for LOC, and 50 mg mL-1 of nimesulide was 
added as IS in all cases. The linearity curve was defined 
by the equation of y = 0.019x + 0.038, where y is the peak 
area ratio of LOC to IS, and x is the concentration of LOC 
expressed in mg mL-1. The correlation coefficient was 
0.9995. The validity of the assay was verified by means 
of analysis of variance (ANOVA), which demonstrated 
significant linear regression (p &amp;lt;0.05) and no significant 
linearity deviation (p &gt; 0.05). The limit of detection (LOD) 
was based on the standard deviation of the response and the 
slope of the constructed calibration curve, as described in 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.23 
The LOD achieved was 1.36 mg mL-1.

Precision
The precision of the method for LOC determination was 

evaluated using the results obtained over 1 day of operation 
under the same conditions (intra-assay) and for 3 days 
(inter-assay). The results expressed as the relative standard 
deviation (RSD %) are given in Table 2, and indicate that 
the method has repeatability and intermediate precision.

Accuracy
A LOC sample solution was fortified with three 

solutions at known concentrations and at three different 
levels. The recovery of added standard was determined 
in triplicate analysis and the results are shown in Table 3.

Robustness
The susceptibility to change of the analytical method 

developed was tested in order to evaluate the robustness. 
For this purpose a 2-level 24-1 fractional factorial design was 
employed. The experimental plan and the corresponding 
responses are summarized in Table 4.

The significance of the effects was evaluated by a Pareto 
chart of the standardized effects and normal probability 
plot of the residuals. The Pareto graph (Figure 4a) consists 
of bars with a length proportional to the absolute value of 
the estimated effect, divided by the pseudo standard error 
defined by Lenth (Lenth’s PSE).28 Codes A, B, C, and D 
correspond to the borate buffer concentration, pH borate 
buffer, capillary temperature and voltage, respectively. The 
combination of two codes indicates the interaction effect 
between the two variables. The bars were displayed based 
on the size of the effect, with the largest effect at the top. 
The chart includes a vertical line at the critical t-value for

? equal 0.05. Effects in which the bars are smaller than the 
critical t-value were not considered significant and did not 
affect the response variables. Figure 4b presents the normal 
probability plot of residuals for LOC. At the studied ranges, 
the effects of the factors were not statistically significant 
(? = 0.05) for the response studied, assay (%). Therefore, 
there were no significant changes in the assay regarding 
the percentage of LOC contents in the modifications made 
under the experimental conditions showing the robustness 
of the developed method.

no evidence of significant difference was observed. The 
calculated F-value (Fcalculated = 1.73987) was found to 
be less than the critical F-value (Fcritical = 3.35413) at 
5% of significance level. Thus, the proposed method is 
appropriate for the determination of LOC in tablets and 
can be used in routine quality control.

Conclusions

In this study, a capillary zone electrophoresis method 
for quality control of LOC was developed. The method was 
optimized by using response surface methodology, which 
made it possible to achieve good efficiency, high sensitivity 

and short analysis time. The method was validated 
following ICH guidelines and showed sufficient linearity, 
accuracy, precision, specificity and robustness. Compared 
with the validated HPLC and UV spectrophotometric 
methods, the CZE method has some advantages including 
the use of smaller amounts of sample and reagents and 
the employment of an aqueous system rather than the 
potentially toxic organic solvents. Thus, this method is a 
suitable alternative for routine quality control of LOC in 
pharmaceutical formulations.
