ABSTRACT: This report reviews and incorporates new elemental and 
isotope chemostratigraphic data for correlation of Neoproterozoic carbo-
nate-dominated successions in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, 
Paraguay and Uruguay). These thick mixed carbonate/siliciclastic succes-
sions were largely deposited in epicontinental basins or accumulated on 
passive margins on the edges of cratons (e.g. São Francisco, Amazonia, 
Rio Apa Block, Pampia and Río de la Plata paleocontinents) during ex-
tensional events related to the rifting of the Rodinia Supercontinent. From 
the stratigraphic point of view, these successions occur as three mega-se-
quences: glaciogenic, marine carbonate platform (above glaciomarine dia-
mictites or rift successions), and dominantly continental to transitional 
siliciclastics. In the orogenic belts surrounding cratons, carbonate-domi-
nated successions with important volcanoclastic/siliciclastic contribution 
have been, in most cases, strongly deformed. The precise ages of these 
successions remain a matter of debate, but recently new paleontological 
and geochronological data have considerably constrained depositional 
intervals. Here, we report high-resolution C, O, Sr, and S isotope trends 
measured in well-preserved sample sets and mainly use Sr and C isotopes 

RESUMO: Esta revisão incorpora novos dados isotópicos e quími-

Paraguai e Uruguai). Estas sucessões, depositadas durante eventos 
de extensão, aparecem como espessos estratos carbonáticos/siliciclásti-

passivas em bordos de cratons (ex.: São Francisco, Amazonas, Blo-

glacio-marinhos) e predominantemente continental siliciclástica. 
Em cinturões circunjacentes a cratons, sucessões carbonáticas con-

casos, fortemente deformados. A idade precisa de sedimentação destas 
sucessões permanece em debate, mas recentes dados paleontológicos 
e geocronológicos têm consideravelmente restringidos os intervalos 
de deposição. Neste trabalho, reportamos trends isotópicos de alta

INTRODUCTION

The pioneer C-isotope investigation on Paleoproterozoic 
carbonate rocks of the Lomagundi province in Africa has 
evidenced much larger variation of ?13C values (Schidlowski 
et al. 1983) than previously known from Phanerozoic carbon-
ate successions (Veizer et al. 1980). This finding has raised 
the possibility that the stratigraphic variation of ?13C val-
ues could potentially be a tool in stratigraphic correlation. 
Despite widespread effects of late diagenesis on the isotope 
record, important isotope events could be demonstrated 
on a global scale by means of isotope chemostratigraphy 
(e.g. Knoll et al. 1986; Magaritz et al. 1986; Holser 1997, 
to mention a few) as it became evident that contemporane-
ous, geographically distant marine strata, registered similar 
isotopic compositions. Chemostratigraphy serves as one of 
the principal means of intra- and inter-basinal stratigraphic 
correlation to assemble the Precambrian stratigraphic record 
from fragments preserved in scattered successions (Karhu 
et al. 2010). Definitely, chemostratigraphy became an import-
ant tool for providing a timeline that compensates for the 
poor biostratigraphic resolution of Precambrian fossils (e.g. 
Veizer et al.1980; Knoll et al. 1986; Magaritz et al. 1986; 
Knoll &amp;amp; Walter 1992; Kaufman et al. 1997, 2007; Corsetti 
&amp;amp; Kaufman 2003; Halverson et al. 2005; Sial et al. 2015b). 
Correlations established through chemostratigraphy can be 
used to comment on climate and biogeochemical changes 
through time, although the paucity of radiometric constraints 
on the absolute age of most of extreme isotope excursions 
leads, sometimes, to debates on their temporal equivalence 
(e.g. Kaufman et al. 1997; Kennedy et al. 1998; Calver et al. 
2004; Allen &amp;amp; Etienne 2008). In the last three decades, the 
number of studies relying on isotope chemostratigraphy 
has grown substantially and, in the case of C-isotope stra-
tigraphy, has been applied to metamorphic rocks up to the 
high grade (Melezhik et al. 2005; Nascimento et al. 2007; 
Chiglino et al. 2010; Sial et al. 2015a) and may retain dep-
ositional ?13C values in even diagenetically altered carbon-
ates (Kaufman et al. 2007).

The first stable isotope laboratory in Brazil was founded 
in the Center of Nuclear Energy in Agriculture (CENA, 
University of São Paulo) in 1966. In 1973, the Federal 
University of Bahia installed a stable isotope laboratory at 
the Nuclear Geophysics Laboratory of the Research Program 

on Geophysics and Geology (PPPG/UFBA) and Petrobras 
founded another in 1977, at the Center of Research and 
Development Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (CENPES) 
in Rio de Janeiro. The widespread use of isotope chemo-
stratigraphy in South America became possible, however, 
only after the installation of a stable isotope laboratory at 
the Federal University of Perrnambuco (LABISE) in Recife 
in 1990 and, later on, in three other Brazilian universities 
(Brasília, São Paulo, and Pará).

C- and O-isotope study of Precambrian succes-
sions in Brazil was first performed by Torquato &amp;amp; Misi 
(1977), who also reported a first cap carbonate charac-
terization (Kaufman et  al. 2007). Other pioneer che-
mostratigraphic investigations in Brazil were performed 
by Torquato (1980), Zaine (1991), Sial et  al. (1992), 
Chang et  al. (1994), Misi &amp;amp; Kyle (1994), Kawashita 
(1996), Boggiani et  al. (1996), Chang (1997), Santos 
et al. (2000, 2004), and Sial et al. (2000). Zaine (1991) 
has measured C and O isotope ratios in carbonates of 
the Tamengo Formation, Corumbá Group, and Boggiani 
et al. (1996) have identified an upper Ediacaran positive 
?13C excursion, associated to the occurrence of Cloudina, 
which was correlated with the Arroyo del Soldado Group 
in Uruguay (Gaucher 1999). These studies were followed 
by systematic chemostratigraphic investigations on the 
Bambui, Una and Araras groups (Misi &amp;amp; Veizer 1998; 
Sial et al. 2000; Santos et al. 2000; Nogueira et al. 2003; 
Alvarenga et al. 2004; Misi et al., 2007). Sial et al. (2000), 
Bekker et al. (2003), and Maheshwari et al. (2010) con-
firmed the record of the Lomagundi C isotope excursion 
in South America (Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais and 
Paso Severino Formation in Uruguay). Sial et al. (2008) 
reported, for the first time in South America, the positive 
carbon isotope excursion (SPICE) from the Steptoean at 
the Argentine Precordillera and recognized a Sunwaptan 
negative carbon isotope excursion (SNICE).

An overview on chemostratigraphic correlations of 
Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated successions in the 
South America continent is present here, mainly based on 
C- and O-isotope chemostratigraphy, updating a prelimi-
nary synthesis published by Misi et al. (2007) and expand-
ing it to encompass some other Neoproterozoic basins in 
this continent (Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and 
northeastern Brazil) (Fig. 1).

in concert with lithostratigraphic/biostratigraphic observations to provide 
detailed correlations of these successions. The establishing of a high-level 
and definite chemostratigraphic correlation between Neoproterozoic ba-
sins in South America is the main goal of this work.

ANALYTICAL METHODS AND 
SAMPLE EVALUATION

The majority of the C- and O-isotope analyses plot-
ted here in chemostratigraphic profiles were performed 
at the Stable Isotope Laboratory (LABISE) of the Federal 
University of Pernambuco at Recife, although some were 
also performed at the Universities of Brasília and São Paulo. 
At the LABISE, CO2 extraction from carbonates was accom-
plished by the conventional method of sample reaction 
with orthophosphoric acid, for 12 hours at 25°C (3 days 
allowed when dolomite was present), followed by cryogenic 
cleaning and then by spectrometric analyses in a SIRA II 
or Delta V Advantage mass spectrometers. Analyses at the 
University of Brasília or University of São Paulo were per-
formed using the Gas Bench on line with Thermofinnigan 
Delta V Advantage mass spectrometer. For some stratigraphic 
sections, strontium isotope ratios were analyzed after con-
centration by ion exchange chromatography and 87Sr/86Sr 
values determined in static mode using a Finnigan MAT 
262 seven-collector mass spectrometer at the University of 
Brasília, or University of São Paulo, as well as other labora-
tories outside South America.

In evaluation of sample quality, it seems that the most 
effective parameter is the Mn/Sr ratio, because Sr is preferen-
tially removed during recrystallization of metastable carbon-
ate phases, while Mn becomes enriched during formation of 
late-stage ferroan calcite cement (Ripperdan et al. 1992; Derry 
et al. 1992; Kaufman et al. 1993; Knoll et al. 1995; Jacobsen 
&amp;amp; Kaufman 1999). Although Kaufman &amp;amp; Knoll (1995) stated 
that limestones or dolostones with Mn/Sr&amp;lt; 10 commonly 
retain near primary ?13C abundances, limestones were here 
considered to be unaltered only when Mn/Sr&amp;lt; 1.5 and ?18O 
&gt; -10‰ (VPDB) according to Fölling &amp;amp; Frimmel (2002) cri-
teria. However, each succession should be evaluated separately 
to assess the nature of isotopic signals, especially for Sr isotopes.

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



d’Oeste Formation), a dark gray laminated lime-mudstone 
and shale (Guia Formation), and a shallow-water dolos-
tone succession (Nobres Formations) bounded by flooding 
surface related to an abrupt sea-level rise characterized by a 
coarsening-upward succession from deep-shale to shallow 
limestone stromatolites (Pacu Formation).

The basal Mirassol d’Oeste Formation is characterized by 
laminated dolostone, exhibiting microbialite, wave ripple, and 
fan-like crystals (Nogueira et al. 2003; Nogueira &amp;amp; Riccomini 
2006; Alvarenga et al. 2008). This 25-m-thick cap dolostone 
yielded negative ?13C values from -10.5‰ to -3.0‰ and ?18O 
values from -8.2 to -1.3‰ VPDB (Nogueira et al. 2003, 2007; 
Alvarenga et al. 2004, 2008; Font et al. 2006), with high and 
variable 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Sr content &amp;lt;100 ppm) and high Mn/Sr 
ratios (&gt; 18), interpreted as indication of post-depositional 
diagenetic alteration (Alvarenga et al. 2008). The ?13C che-
mostratigraphic pathway for the basal Ediacaran cap-carbon-
ate (Marinoan) is comparable with ?13C stratigraphic profiles 
worldwide. Marinoan cap-carbonates are described in the 
São Francisco paleocontinent (Caxito et al. 2012; Alvarenga 
et al. 2014), southern Paraguay (Boggiani et al. 2003), and 
Sergipano belts (Sial et al. 2010), and in different paleocon-
tinents (Amazonia, Arabia, Arctic, Alaska, Australia, Baltic, 
Congo, Kalahari, India, Laurentia, Siberia, South China, 
Mongolia, and West Africa; see Hoffman 2011).

The cap dolostone of the Mirassol d’Oeste Formation 
is succeeded by transgressive, deep-platformal deposits of 
dark gray laminated lime-mudstone and shale of the Guia 
Formation, reaching up to 250 m thick in the middle 
shelf domain (Nogueira et al. 2007; Riccomini et al. 2007; 
Alvarenga et al. 2004, 2008, 2011). These trangressive 
deposits are exposed along more than 200 km from West 
to East (Alvarenga et al. 2008, 2009). Carbon isotope data 
for rocks of the Guia Formation revealed predominantly 
negative ?13C values, from -3.5 to +0.1‰, and ?18O val-
ues from -13.5‰ to -6.3‰ (Alvarenga et al. 2004, 2008; 
Figueiredo 2006; Nogueira et al. 2003, 2007). 87Sr/86Sr 
ratios for limestones with higher Sr content (&gt; 750 ppm) 
and low Mn/Sr ratios (&amp;lt;0.2) range from 0.7076 to 0.7078 
(Alvarenga et al. 2008, 2011).

The Nobres Formation consists of a light gray dolos-
tone in a shallow-water succession (900 – 1100 m), show-
ing increasing ?13C values from base to top, ranging from 
-2.2‰ to +2.7‰ in the first hundred meters, while in the 
upper dolostone ?13C values reach +9.6‰ (Fig. 3). ?18O val-
ues range from -4.7 to -0.1‰ (Pinho et al. 2003; Alvarenga 
et al. 2004; Figueiredo et al. 2006; Nogueira et al. 2007).

A package of about 300-m-thick shale and limestone was 
recently described as the upper unit of the Araras Group 
(Souza et al. 2012). C-isotope analyses for the uppermost 
70 m of stromatolitic limestones include ?13C values from 

+6.6‰ to +8.9‰, while 87Sr/86Sr ratios are nearly constant, 
between 0.7087 and 0.7088 (Souza 2015). The record of 
the Gaskiers glaciation (Serra Azul Formation) is observed 
above an erosional surface atop the upper Araras Group, with 
the Pacu Formation preserved only near the Serra Azul in 
the eastern part of the North Paraguay Belt (Souza 2015).

Facies distribution, stratigraphy and the ?13C stratigraphic 
profile for the Araras Group match those for the middle 
Tsumeb Subgroup in Namibia, supporting an Ediacaran 
age for the Araras Group (Fig. 3). The upper portion of 
this group shows high ?13C values and high87Sr/86Sr ratios, 
suggesting deposition in the late Ediacaran.

Toward the deeper parts of the basin, carbonate deposi-
tion was replaced by fine-grained deposits with low sedimen-
tation rates. Facies and stratigraphic data coupled with C 
and O isotopes are an evidence of lateral equivalence of the 
lower units of the Araras Group wherein the Guia syncline, 
over 250 m thick at the edge of the basin, can be regarded 
as the break of the carbonate shelf (Alvarenga et al. 2004, 
2008, 2011). The studied succession in the Guia syncline 
consists of 150-m-thick black-to-gray lime mudstone and 
shale with ?13C values from -2.5 to -1‰. The ?13C strati-
graphic profile in this syncline shows a clear correlation 
with the Guia Formation at the Cáceres region, 250 km 
away to southwest. At the Cáceres and Nobres region, a 
thick succession of shallow-water dolostones over 1000 m 
thick (Nobres Formation) overlies the Guia Formation. 
The sedimentary rocks of the Guia syncline were deposited 
in a deeper basin, outside the carbonate shelf, where pelitic 
sediments are found in its inner portion.

Ca isotopic compositions of post-glacial carbonate suc-
cessions in central Brazil (Mirassol D’Oeste-Cáceres and 
Tangará) have been reported by Silva-Tamayo et al. (2010). 
The basal dolostones display 44/40Ca values between 1 and 
0.7‰, while the overlying limestones show a negative 
Ca-isotope excursion to values around 0.1‰, followed by a 
positive shift to 2.0 ‰ values and, then, stabilize upsection 
to values between 0.6 and 0.9‰. This Ca-isotope secular 
variation trend is similar to those of Marinoan post-glacial 
carbonate successions in Namibia, suggesting that the per-
turbation of the marine Ca cycle was, perhaps, global.

shale intercalations and rhythmite (black limestone/
organic shale), interpreted as deposited in a shelf con-
text (Fig. 4). The metazoan fossils have been observed 
only in outcrops around Corumbá and Ladário towns, 
where shallow water conditions prevailed during depo-
sition, attested by hummocky and other cross-bedding 
structures in grainstones. The Tamengo Formation 
is the best studied among the units of the Corumbá 
Group due to its fossil content, C-isotope behav-
ior and the possibility that it may have recorded the 
Precambrian-Cambrian boundary.

The base of the Corumbá Group is characterized by 
conglomerate and arkose of the Cadieus and Cerradinho 
formations, which are restricted to the western border of 
the Serra da Bodoquena (Almeida 1965; Fig. 4). The depo-
sition of these terrigenous sediments is associated to the 
development of a rift basin (Boggiani, 1998; Gaucher et al. 
2003), probably part of a rift system developed in the base-
ment, the Rio Apa Block. The deposition of the Puga dia-
micite and the manganese/iron formation of the Jacadigo 
Group are likely associated to the development of this rift 
system (Urucum Massif; Trompette et al. 1998; Walde &amp;amp;

Hagemann 2007; Freitas et al. 2011). It is worth noting 
that the Puga Formation was originally described from the 
southern Paraguay Belt (Maciel, 1959), and is not necessarily 
time-correlative to the homonymous unit in the northern 
Paraguay Belt (Alvarenga et al. 2011).

The Bocaina Formation is related to thermal subsidence 
of the Corumbá Basin which promoted shallow deposition 
under warm water and high-evaporation conditions, respon-
sible of stromatolite proliferation and primary (?) dolomite 
precipitation. The top of this unit is marked by the occur-
rence of phosphorite, related to upwelling that testifies the 
communication with the open ocean (Boggiani et al. 1993).

A strong sea-level drop marked the end of deposition 
of the Bocaina Formation, may be with its exposure, and 
was responsible for the deposition of an expressive carbon-
ate breccia that defines the base of the Tamengo Formation 
(Boggiani 1998). This carbonate breccia contains clasts 
from the Bocaina Formation and from the granite-gneissic 
basement. The Tamengo Formation records an expressive 
transgression event contemporaneous to the appearance of 
metazoan fossils. This formation is overlain by siltstone and 
shale of the Guaicurus Formation that represents the end 
of carbonate sedimentation conditions and that probably 
straddles the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary.

The dolostones of the Bocaina Formation yielded ?13C 
values from zero to ~ +3‰ and ?18O VPDB values ~ -3‰ 
(Boggiani 1998; Fontaneta 2012). Stronger fluctuation of 
C-isotope values is observed in the Tamengo Formation in 
which values of ~ -1‰ are common above basal breccias 
and at about 20 m toward the top, reaching nadir values 
of -3.6‰ (Boggiani et al. 2010; Spangenberg et al. 2014). 
A positive excursion to +5‰ follows, which is associated with 
the first occurrence of Cloudina (Fig. 5). Above the positive 
C-isotope excursion, the Tamengo Formation is character-
ized by a plateau of positive values, around +3 ‰ (Boggiani 
et al. 2010), where some 10 µm-pyrite framboids yielded 
high positive ?34S values, between +35.9 and +43.5‰ CDT. 
Values of 87Sr/86Sr in the 0.7085 – 0.7086 range characterize 
limestones of the upper portion of the Tamengo Formation 
(typical of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary).

Carbonate rocks of the top of the Puga Formation diam-
ictite at the Puga Hill in the Paraguay River are interpreted 
as a cap carbonate. This cap carbonate exhibits rhythmicity 
of lamination in a deep-red limestone with homogeneous 
?13C values around -5‰ (Boggiani et al. 2003). The depo-
sition of the Puga Formation has been assigned to the early 
Cryogenian, with youngest detrital zircons yielding ages of 
706 ± 9 Ma and 706 ± 12 Ma (Babinski et al. 2013).

After about three decades of global chemostratigraphic 
studies of Neoproterozoic carbonate successions, there is a 
consensus that negative ?13C excursions follow the main 

glacial events, identified in Cryogenian cap carbonates, and 
two Ediacaran negative ?13C excursions, one below the first 
occurrence of skeletal organism (Shuram-Wonoka excursion) 
and a second one in the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. 
One cannot assure that the negative ?13C excursion at the 
base of the Tamengo Formation is a primary feature, since 
it has not been observed in different sections of this forma-
tion, as happens elsewhere (e.g. Oman and Death Valley; 
Boggiani et al. 2010). It is possible that this negative ?13C 
excursion in the Tamengo Formation, associated with black, 
organic limestone, has resulted from oxidation during deep 
burial of organic matter. However, positive ?13C values in 
organic limestone in the same stratigraphic position were 
observed in this formation. This negative ?13C excursion is 
located just below a positive ?13C excursion, contemporary 
with the first occurrence of Cloudina. It is of paramount 
importance in unraveling whether the Shuram-Wonoka 
C-isotope anomaly is a primary feature orjust a diagenetic 
artifact. If proved to be a primary one, this C-isotope anom-
aly will encourage further investigation on its relationship 
with early animal life evolution.

Itapucumí Group, 
Southern Paraguay Belt

The study of South American Neoproterozoic succes-
sions has improved the comprehension of the bioevolution-
ary, climatic, and geotectonic phenomena coeval with the 
Rodinia supercontinent rifting. During this time interval, 
important subsidence cycles took place at the margins of the 
Amazonian, Pampia, and Rio de la Plata cratons, leading to 
the deposition of carbonatic and siliciclastic sequences in 
newly formed basins. These units, as the Corumbá (Brazil), 
Puncoviscana (Argentina), and Arroyo del Soldado (Uruguay) 
groups contain important Ediacaran fossils represented by 
microfossils and skeletal organisms as Cloudina sp. and 
Corumbella sp. In this context, the Itapucumí Group is one 
of the least known Neoproterozoic units (Fig. 6). This group, 
composed of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks, including ooid 
grainstones, marls, shales, and sandstones, occurs in north-
eastern Paraguay as a marginal belt that shows strong defor-
mational pattern at its western edge and forms an almost 
undeformed sedimentary cover on the Rio Apa cratonic 
Block, a promontory of the Amazonian Craton (Campanha 
et al. 2010). The Rio Apa Block is delimited at its eastern 
portion by the Paraguay Belt, a W-vergent thrust-and-fold 
belt, which is composed of the Ediacaran successions of the 
Corumbá Group.

The Itapucumí Group is about 400 m thick and com-
prises siliciclastic rocks of the Vallemí Formation at the base 
(Fig. 7). These basal layers are composed of immature sand-
stones interbedded with basalts, covered by an expressive

cratonic cover comprised by lagoonal facies deposited in 
inter- to supratidal context, associated with laminated 
microbialites and thrombolites containing Cloudina sp., 
Corumbella werneri, and simple ichnofossils (Boggiani &amp;amp; 
Gaucher, 2004; Warren et al. 2011, 2012). Covering these 
successions there are pelites, marls, and grainstones of the 
Cerro Curuzú Formation representing deep-shelf deposi-
tional systems with siliciclastic contribution (Warren et al. 
2010; Warren 2011).

The stratigraphic architecture of the Itapucumí Group suc-
cessions is similar to that described for the Corumbá Group 
which is formed by siliciclastic deposits of the Cerradinho, 
Cadieus, and Puga formations at the base, overlain by car-
bonate rocks of the Bocaina and Tamengo formations, and 
pelitic sediments of the Guaicurus Formation at the top. 
The carbonate units of the Corumbá Group are represen-
tative of shallow-water shelf deposits grading into deep-wa-
ter successions in a transgressive environment, in the same 
way that lagoon depositional systems grade toward the top 
to oolitic shoals and coastal bars in the Itapucumí Group. 
Toward the top of both units, deeper deposits with silici-
clastic contribution are representative of retrogradational 
conditions, which characterizes regional (probably eustatic) 
sea-level rise. Cloudina sp. and Corumbella werneri fossils 
found in the lower portion of the Tagatiyá Guazú Formation 
attest to a terminal Ediacaran age and the paleoecologic and 
chronostratigraphic correlation with the Tamengo Formation 
(Warren et al. 2011, 2012).

C-isotope ratios do not show large fluctuations across the 
Itapucumí Group as commonly observed in Neoproterozoic 
?13C records (Fig. 8). The Itapucumí carbonate succession 
yielded positive ?13C values, ranging from +0.2 to +3.8‰ 
(Warren et al. 2010; Warren 2011). Levels of microbialites 
that contain Cloudina and Corumbella (Tagatiyá Guazú 
Formation) present average ?13C value of +2.45‰ (Warren 
2011), supporting the stratigraphic correlation between this 
unit and the Tamengo Formation in the Corumbá Group. 
Preliminary 87Sr/86Sr data of the Camba Jhopo/Tagatiyá 
Guazú and Cerro Curuzú formations, exhibit mean value 
of 0.7086, further reinforce this correlation.

Therefore, paleontological, stratigraphical, and isotopic 
data support the correspondence between the Itapucumí 
and Corumbá groups, confirming their coeval evolu-
tion (Fig. 9). The divergent patterns of tectonic vergence 
between these two belts could be, perhaps, explained by 
having the Rio Apa Block acting as a rigid barrier during 
a Cambrian orogenic event related with the final closure 
of the Clymene Ocean (Warren 2011; Campanha et al. 
2010). Alternatively, it could represent a different unit 
altogether (Poiré, 2014).

Murciélago Group, 
Tucavaca Belt, Bolivia

Neoproterozoic rocks in Bolivia are found in the Tucavaca 
Belt, near the town of Santa Cruz de La Sierra, in the 
southern portion of this country. Litherland &amp;amp; Bloomfield 
(1981) have summarized a general picture of the geology 
of the country, McNamee (2001) a model for onset of the 
Tucavaca Basin, and Pinto-Vasquez (2001), some further 
details of its geological evolution.

Rocks in the northeastern boundary of the Tucavaca Belt 
(Fig. 2) are in contact with the Mesoproterozoic basement 
(Litherland et al. 1986) and in its southwestern boundary, 
are covered by Quaternary sedimentary rocks of the Chaco-
Benian Plains regarded as a foreland basin of the Andean 
Belt. Rocks of the Tucavaca Belt are observed along the 
railway between the towns of Santa Cruz, in Bolivia, and 
Corumbá, in Brazil (Hess 1959). Their outcrops can be 
divided into two groups:
1. one observed near the Bolivia–Brazil boundary, at the 

Brazilian side, in continuity with the Paraguay Belt that 
encompasses a thick pack of rocks of the Boquí Group 
overlain by carbonate rocks of the Murciélago Group, 
equivalent to the Jacadigo and Corumbá groups of the 
Paraguay Belt (Chamot 1963); and

2. a second group that corresponds to the Tucavaca Belt, 
named by Hess (1959), and that extends for over 500 km. 
These rocks exhibit a NW-SE regional trend, differently 
from rocks in the Paraguay Belt which are aligned in the 
N-S direction.

The stratigraphy of the Tucavaca Belt encompasses the 
Boquí and Tucavaca groups. The Boquí Group is represented 
by rocks deposited unconformably in a rift basin parallel 
to the Sunsas Belt, the basement. This group is formed by 
rocks deposited in three environments:
1. fan-conglomerates of the San Francisco Formation 

(~2000 m thick);
2. intertidal and lagoonal sediments of the Colmena 

Formation (~900 m thick); and
3. submarine mudflows of the Cahama Formation (~1,500 m 

thick).

In the region of Porto Suarez and Mutún, one observes a 
volcanogenic basal unit below the sequence of rocks included 
in the Jacadigo Group equivalent to the Cuarrí Formation of 
the Boquí Group. This volcanic unit has been called Pimienta 
Formation and the overlying rocks are regarded as tillites. 
They include other glacial/periglacial deposits as iron and 
manganese formations (IF) of the Urucum Formation, in 
the Brazilian side of the Paraguay Belt.

The Tucavaca Group has a total thickness of 2,500 m 
and overlaps the Cahama Formation (youngest unit of the 
Boquí Group), encompassing a sequence of conglomerates 
(Pacobilo Formation), finely laminated, gray to pinkish 
limestones (Pororó Formation), coarse, sometimes micace-
ous sandstones with rare dropstones (Bocamina Formation). 
On top of the last one, one observes shales, claystones, and 
siltites (Pesenema Formation) with intercalations of clastic 
material (Tarumá Member), metamorphosed at low grade. 
The Bocamina Formation is stratigraphically correlated to 
the Motacú (shale and sandstone) and Piococa (arkose) for-
mations that occur in the Tucavaca syncline between the 
localities of Taperas and Quimoné.

Sandstones and limestones have been identified next to 
the locality of Murciélago in the region of Porto Suárez, lead-
ing to the definition of the homonymous group. The hori-
zontal sedimentary rocks of the Murciélago Group are over 
500 m thick and overlap rocks of the Boquí Group. These 
rocks have been correlated with the Pororó Formation of 
the Tucavaca Group.

The Tucavaca aulacogen represents a failed rift arm accord-
ing to Trompette et al. (1998) which may mark the boundary 
between the Río de la Plata and Amazonian cratons (Gaucher 
et al. 2009b). The sedimentary infill of this aulacogen, rep-
resented by the Boquí, Murciélago, and Tucavaca groups, 
correlates with the Jacadigo and Corumbá groups of the 
southern Paraguay Belt (Avila Salinas 1992), showing that the 
opening of the Tucavaca Basin took place at approximately 
600 Ma (Gaucher et al. 2009b). A rhyolite associated with 

the Boquí Group in Bolivia (nearby Puerto Suárez) yielded 
K-Ar age of 623 to 715 Ma (Avila Salinas 1992; Trompette 
et al. 1998). The emplacement of this rhyolite is probably 
related to continental rifting and, thus, drifting and open-
ing of the Brazilides Ocean in that area is unlikely to have 
commenced prior to about 600 Ma (Gaucher et al. 2009).

Fernández-Ramírez et al. (2009) collected stratigraph-
ically seventeen samples of massive limestone and dolos-
tone of the Murciélago Group with horizontal stratifica-
tion in a continuous profile at a 30-m-high quarry, located 
between the Roboré town and Santo Corazón village, 4 km 
from Murciélago. Poorly sorted sandstones and diamictites, 
stratigraphically below the carbonates of the Murciélago 
Group were collected at about 1 km to the northeast from 
the site of collection of the carbonates, following the same 
road. ?13C values for these carbonates are all negative, vary-
ing from -0.9 to -1.8‰, and ?18O from -4.1‰ to -6.3‰ 
VPDB (Fig. 10).

in passive-margin basins present in the Brasília, Araçuaí, 
Sergipano, Riacho do Pontal and Rio Preto belts, and Rio 
Pardo Basin (Fig. 11). These belts are marked by intense 
folding and overthrusting. The intracratonic sedimentary 
cover is only deformed in the peri-cratonic areas, near the 
foldbelts. They are preserved in isolated basins and sub-ba-
sins in Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Bahia. They include basal 
assemblages of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic ages 
but here we will restrict the discussion to the Neoproterozoic 
sedimentary assemblages comprising the São Francisco 
Supergroup (Alkmim &amp;amp; Martins-Neto 2001; Martins-Neto 
&amp;amp; Alkmim 2001), which is characterized by a glaciogenic 
mega-sequence at the base, a carbonate-platform mega-se-
quence (marine) and a molasse mega-sequence above, sep-
arated by first-order unconformities (Misi et al., 2007; Misi 
et al. 2011 and references therein).

Correlations between the stratigraphic successions using 
parasequence boundaries observed in the different basins and 
sub-basins, petrographic investigation, and high-resolution 
chemostratigraphic profiles (mainly 87Sr/86Sr, ?13C, ?18O and 

?34S), have been suggested by several authors during the last 
20 years (Sial et al. 2010 and references therein). In the fol-
lowing sections, we will discuss the progress of these stud-
ies in the epicontinental (intracratonic) and passive-margin 
basins (foldbelts).

Neoproterozoic intracratonic basins
The intracratonic successions include the Bambuí Group 

in the São Francisco Basin (states of Minas Gerais, Goiás 
and Bahia) and the Una Group in the Irecê, Campinas, 
Una-Utinga, and Ituaçu sub-basins (Bahia), covering more 
than 60% of the cratonic area. Despite the proliferation of 
different names, it is possible to demonstrate the correlation 
of stratigraphic successions along thousands of kilometers.

A common tectonic evolution is postulated for these 
basins, during the Neoproterozoic times. Although some 
authors consider that the sediments have accumulated in 
foreland basins during compressive tectonic events (e.g. 
Dardenne 2001, Martins-Neto 2001, among others), others

glacial diamictites in the basal section (D’el Rey Silva 1999; 
Misi et al. 2011). According to Misi et al. (2007), an exten-
sional stage related to the break-up of the Rodinia supercon-
tinent (900 – 600 Ma), responsible for the glaciogenic and 
marine carbonate mega-sequences, is partially co-incident 
with the Brasiliano-Pan African orogeny (650 – 500 Ma), 

which is responsible for the molasse mega-sequence sedi-
mentation at the upper section. In addition, this collisional 
stage is determinant of the present structural configuration 
of the basins, with thrust faults, detachment faults, and 
verging flexural folds in the peri-cratonic area, including the 
fold belts (Misi &amp;amp; Veizer 1998). Extensive faults, aligned

may represent basement structures reactivated during sedi-
mentation (Misi &amp;amp; Veizer; 1998; Misi et al. 2014) (Fig. 11).

Sequence stratigraphy
The Bambuí and Una groups (São Francisco Supergroup) 

are formed by carbonate and siliciclastic successions distrib-
uted in the following megasequences (Fig. 11):

Glaciogenic
Glaciogenic diamictites are known to occur at least in 

two stratigraphic positions within Neoproterozoic succes-
sions of South America (see Misi et al. 2007 and references 
therein), but in the intratcratonic basins of the São Francisco 
Craton, they are clearly observed only below the carbonate 
(marine) platform megasequence, represented by the Jequitaí 
Formation (Bambuí Group: São Francisco Basin) and the 
Bebedouro Formation (Una Group: Irecê, Una-Utinga and 
Campinas sub-basins). However, Kaufman et al. (2008) have 

recognized diamictites in association with cap carbonates 
in Inhaúma district, 25 km from Sete Lagoas, to the East 
(Sambra Quarry). Although no diamictite has been observed 
in the area near this quarry, the possibility of correlation with 
the Inhaúma outcrop is considered in view of the negative 
?13C shifts measured in the Sambra Quarry (-5‰) as well 
as in the Inhaúma cap carbonate (-2‰), among others. 
In the Irecê sub-basin (Una Group), the presence of dolos-
tones in the uppermost section (Unit B1) of the first mega-
sequence showing negative ?13C shifts (-4‰, Torquato &amp;amp; 
Misi 1977), may suggest a discrete glacial event (Fig. 12). 
No diamictite has been observed.

Carbonate-dominated marine succession
The facies here represented are formed by dolostone, 

marls, shale, and siltstone. Dardenne (1978, 1979 and 2000) 
subdivided the Bambui Group into the following units:

 ? Serra de Santa Helena Formation – Marl, siltstones, fine 
sandstones, and intercalated limestones;

 ? Lagoa do Jacaré Formation – Black, organic-rich inter-
calated limestone;

 ? Serra da Saudade Formation – Siltstone, pelite, and inter-
calated limestone;

 ? The Salitre Formation of the Una Group has been sub-
divided into five units that correlate with those of the 
Bambui Group (Misi et al. 2011; Fig. 13).

Siliciclastic continental 
(molasse) succession

Arkose, siltstone, phyllite, and conglomerate form the 
Três Marias Formation of the Bambuí Group. These facies 
are related to foreland sedimentation at the end of the 
Brasiliano orogenesis. According to Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 
(1991), the contact between the Três Marias Formation and 
the Bambuí Group is erosional. These facies are not repre-
sented in the eastern side of the SFC (Irecê, Una-Utinga 
and Campinas sub-basins).

Depositional ages: geochronology 
and isotopic records

Lack of absolute gechronological ages is still a problem. In 
the absence of datable volcanic rocks, U-Pb ages on detrital 
zircons have been used during the last 15 years, resulting in 
controversial data when compared with other methods applied 
to the same stratigraphic intervals. For example, Pb-Pb model 

age of 740 ± 22 Ma (MSWD = 0.66) from well-preserved 
sea-floor cements in the Sete Lagoas Formation (Babinski 
et al. 2007), considered the most consistent geochronolog-
ical data until recently, is now contested by recent U-Pb 
ages of detrital zircon 610 Ma from the same stratigraphic 
interval, that is, possibly representing the maximum age of 
the Sete Lagoas Formation (Pimentel et al. 2011). On the 
other hand, U-Pb SHRIMP ages on detrital zircons from 
diamictites at the base of the Araçuaí Belt give a maximum 
age of 950 Ma (Pedrosa Soares et al. 2000) and from clasts 
of diamictite from the Bebedouro Formation, central-eastern 
Bahia, reveal Archean and Paleoproterozoic populations, but 
the youngest detrital zircon dated 874 ± 9 Ma (Figueiredo 
et al. 2009). The discovery of the Neoproterozoic index 
fossil Cloudina sp. associated with other trace fossils in the 
Sete Lagoas Formation (lower Bambuí Group) has been 
reported by Warren et al. (2014) who propose, at least for 
exposures in central eastern Brazil, terminal Ediacaran age 
(550 – 542 Ma). Archean to Paleoproterozoic U-Pb SHRIMP 
ages of detrital zircons from carbonate platform of the basal 
and mid-sections of the Salitre Formation (Unit B, accord-
ing to Misi &amp;amp; Souto 1975, correlated to the mid-section of 
the Sete Lagoas Formation) have been reported by Santana 
et al. (submitted). Besides, they reported detrital zircon from 
a tuffite layer associated with deep-water mud-lithofacies, 
and possibly related to active volcanism in the passive mar-
ginal basins during mud sedimentation, with a concordia 
age of 669 ± 14 Ma.

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



Despite these controversial ages, the isotopic record 
for 87Sr/86Sr in well-preserved carbonates from the intra-
cratonic basins of the Bambui and Una groups (0.7074 to 
0.7078), associated with remarkable negative and positive 
?13C shifts, indicate possible sedimentation age between early 
Cryogenian and early Ediacaran (720 – 600 Ma) (Fig. 14; 
data plotted on Fig. 4 of Halverson et al. 2010). In this fig-
ure, data obtained in Otavi and Lufilian sequences in Africa 
are considered for correlations, in view of the reliable abso-
lute geochronological data (from associated volcanic rocks) 
available (see Kaufman et al. 2009 and references therein). 
Lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios observed in cap carbonates of the Otavi 
Group and Lufilian Arc (0.7066) is probably due to differ-
ences in the tectonic and diagenetic evolution of Brazilian 
and African basins (Kaufman et al. 2009).

Kuchenbecker et al. (2016) stated that local inputs may 
control marine 87Sr/86Sr and not global processes, something 
which goes against the present knowledge of the Sr system. 
The high residence time of Sr in the ocean (2.7 Ma) and the 
relatively high Sr concentration in seawater (7.5 ppm) make 
a local control highly unlikely (see Jacobsen &amp;amp; Kaufman 

1999 and Veizer et al. 1999). In fact, the discrepancies that 
these authors correctly identified arise from a lack of reliable 
data for much of the Neoproterozoic, and thus a still poorly 
known global curve for that era. Furthermore, the different 
preparation methods for Sr isotopes may also contribute to 
this problem (see Melezhik et al. 2001).

Kuchenbecker et al. (2016) have mentioned that the 
Bambuí Basin may have been restricted, but did not men-
tion occurrence of evaporite or extensive black shale deposits 
as further evidence. The occurrence of cosmopolitan fossils, 
such as Cloudina, militates against this restricted scenario.

Most of the orogen is formed by sedimentary/metased-
imentary units, with different tectonic significances and 
ages. For example, the Paranoá and Canastra groups most 
likely represent passive margin sequences, the Araxá Group 
is a fore-arc sequence, and the Bambuí Group which occu-
pies the eastern part of the belt and also covers large areas 
of the craton, may represent a foreland sequence (Pimentel 
et al. 2011; Fig. 15). The Bambuí Group is represented by 

carbonate and siliciclastic sequence overlying glacial diam-
ictes of the Jequitaí Formation of unknow age.

The depositional ages of these sequences are still contro-
versial, mostly due to the apparent lack of volcanic layers, as 
well as the scarce content of diagnostic fossil associations. 
Pb-Pb whole-rock data for basal carbonates of the Sete Lagoas 
Formation (base of the Bambuí Group) indicate the deposi-
tional age of ca. 740 Ma (Babinski et al. 2007), suggesting

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



an early Cryogenian or late Tonian age (Shield-Zhou et al., 
2016) for the Jequitaí diamictites which is compatible with 
C and Sr isotopic data for the cap carbonate. However, 
metapelites of the upper Sete Lagoas Formation, as well as 
the rest of the overlying formations of the Bambuí Group, 
contain zircon grains with important populations with ages 
of ca. 600 Ma, and even some of these metasediments have a 
few zircon grains as young as 550 Ma (Pimentel et al. 2011, 
Paula Santos et al. 2014) suggesting an Ediacaran age for the 
unit. Recent paleontogical discoveries of Ediacaran fauna in 
the Sete Lagoas Formation indicate depositional age of ca. 
550 Ma (Warren et al. 2014), which agrees with the pres-
ence of the younger detrital zircon population. This recent 
data suggest, therefore, that part of the Sete Lagoas Group 
and the remaining overlying units have depositional ages 
close to the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary.

Carbonate rocks of the Paranoá and the Bambuí groups 
have been investigated for their C, O, and Sr isotopic com-
positions (Santos et al. 2000; Alvarenga et al. 2007, 2014). 
Santos et al. (2000, 2004) demonstrated that the isoto-
pic patterns vary in the studied profiles, although a gereral 
positive excursion is oberved toward the upper parts of the 
Bambuí Group. These authors have shown in the investi-
gated profiles (São Domingos area) a sharp increase in the 
?13C values at the very top of the Sete Lagoas Formation (+9 
to +12‰), a signal which is common to all profiles investi-
gated, representing a regional stratigraphic marker (Santos 
et al. 2000). Carbonates of the underlying Paranoá Group 
have consistently lower ?13C values (normally close to 0‰).

Similarly, carbonates of the Paranoá and Bambuí groups 
are very different in terms of their 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Values 
between 0.7056 and 0.7068 are observed in upper carbon-
ates of the Paranoá Group and higher values are recorded 
in Bambuí carbonates (0.7074 – 0.7080; Alvarenga et al. 
2014). The C and Sr isotope stratigraphic data indicate very 
distinct characteristics for these two carbonate sequences. 
The data for the Paranoá carbonates are consistent with a 
Tonian sedimentation age, before the first Cryogenian gla-
ciation. On the other hand, carbonate facies and isotope 
data for the Bambuí carbonates suggest deposition after the 
second Cryogenian glaciation.

As pointed out by Santos et al. (2000), the clear isoto-
pic differences between the Paranoá and Bambuí groups 
indicate deposition in different paleoenvironments and 
different kinds of basin. According to these authors, based 
on the ?13C values, it may be postulated that the Paranoá 
Group sediments deposited on an open-marine platform 
(passive margin sequence?) whereas the Bambuí sequence 
formed in a restricted epicontinental sea affected by tectonic 
events of the Brasília Belt.This is compatible with the tec-
tonic evolution suggested by Pimentel et al. (2011) based on 

provenance studies of the Brasília Belt. The common pres-
ence of Neoproterozoic zircon grains in the Bambuí Group 
is compatible with the erosion of adjacent Neoproterozoic 
mountanis, in a foreland setting.

Rio Pardo Basin and Rio Preto Belt
The Rio Pardo Basin is located in the southeastern border 

of the São Francisco craton, between São João do Panelinha 
and Itapebi villages in Bahia, eastern Brazil (Fig. 16). This basin 
is divided into two sub-basins, separated by a reverse fault: 
the southwestern sub-basin was involved in the folding of 
the Araçuaí Belt; sedimentary rocks of the northeastern 
sub-basin have been deposited on the foreland of this belt 
on the São Francisco Craton.

The Rio Pardo Group comprehends, from base to top, 
the following litho-stratigraphic units (Pedreira 1999; Sial 
et al. 2009):
1. Panelinha Formation underlies the other formations of 

this Group and consists of conglomerate, breccia, greywa-
cke, and arkose. Diamictites with clasts of granulite and 
volcanics are, perhaps, glacial in origin;

2. Itaimbé sub-group that encompasses the intermediate 
formations of the Rio Pardo Group, from north to south:
1. Camacan Formation (pelite, siltite and carbonate rocks);
2. Água Preta Formation (phylite, sandstone, siltite, 

slate and carbonate rocks;
3. Serra do Paraíso Formation (carbonate rocks locally 

with stromatolites, and quartzite);
4. Santa Maria Eterna Formation (quartzite, conglomerate 

and carbonatic intercalations with tepee structures;
5. finally, turbidites of the Salobro Formation overly dis-

cordantly the Camacan Formation and are in tectonic 
contact with the Água Preta Formation (greywacke, 
siltite, sandstone, and conglomerate); and

3. Salobro Formation (polymitic conglomerate, greywacke 
and sandstone). Sedimentary rocks of the Rio Pardo Group 
have been metamorphosed in the greenschist facies.

Carbonate rocks of the Serra do Paraíso Formation 
(Rio Pardo Basin) are seen in sharp contact with diamic-
tite/arkose of the São João do Panelinha Formation and 
same situation with respect to carbonate rocks of the São 
Desidério Formation (Rio Preto Belt) in relation to the 
Canabravinha diamictite. It is possible that cap carbon-
ates are present in both cases.

Carbon-isotope stratigraphy of the Serra do Paraíso and 
São Desidério formations could be useful tool to demon-
strate this hypothesis. Only a preliminary C-isotope survey 
was done on carbonates of the Rio Pardo Basin but the 
lack of clear stratigraphic control on the analyzed sam-
ples preclude further stratigraphic interpretation (Costa 

459

Alcides Nobrega Sial et al.



Pinto 1977). C and O isotopes have been analyzed in a 
total of 173 carbonate samples from the Paraíso and São 
Desidério formations (Cezario et al. 2011) aiming at a 
high-resolution isotope stratigraphy and elucidating the 
paleoclimatic issue. At the eastern portion of the Água 
Branca Range, a section (17 m) on buff dolostone, they 
found ?13C values around -2‰. At the western side of 
the Agua Branca Range, a section (12 m) of gray lime-
stones in a folded sequence of rhythmites exhibit ?13C 
values from +3.5 to +6‰ and a section to the north of 
Pau Brasil village (12 m) shows values from +7 to +9‰. 
A composite C-isotope section is found in Figure 17 and 
the ?13C pathway resembles that observed in successions 
with basal cap carbonates.

The Rio Preto Belt is located at the northwestern border 
of the São Francisco Craton (Fig. 18) as an example of an 
intracontinental belt (Egydio-Silva 1987; Egydio-Silva et al. 
1989; Andrade Filho et al. 1994; Trompette 1994; Sial et al.

sion, to the west, of the Riacho do Pontal and Sergipano 
belts. These sedimentary successions are an equivalent to 
those of the São Francisco Supergroup in Bahia. From south 
to north, the Rio Preto Belt can be subdivided into three 
structural units:
1. southern unit, region of São Desidério, the sequence 

begins with limestone with argillaceous intercalations 
(50 m thick, horizontal layers) and shows no sign of meta-
morphism or deformation (cratonic domain). This unit 
was called São Desidério Formation (Egydio-Silva et al. 
1989) probably equivalent to the Sete Lagoas Formation 
of the Bambuí Group, Minas Gerais;

2. to the north, inwards the belt, limestones are overlain 
by clastic rocks that show intercalations of marls and 
limestones (Serra da Mamona Formation), a sequence 
probably correlated with the Santa Helena Formation 
(Egydio-Silva et al. 1989);

3. north of Barreiras village, limestones are overlain by 
arkoses, quartzites (locally feldspathic), graywackes, 
and rare carbonate intercalations (Riachão das Neves 
Formation). This sequence is considered partially equi-
valent to the Três Marias Formation of the Bambuí 
Group (Trompette 1994).

In the central portion of the belt, the Canabravinha 
Formation is represented by diamictites with pebbles, cob-
bles, and boulders of gneiss, quartzite, siltstone, marble, 
and schist. This unit has been correlated to the Jequitaí/
Bebedouro Formation, probably deposited in a glacial 
marine environment.

In the Rio Preto Belt, continuous chemostratigraphic 
sections of representative successions of the São Desidério 
Formation (Cezario et al. 2011) were made at:
1. Derocal locality about 20 km from São Desidério;
2. the Mineração do Oeste Quarry at São Desidério village;
3. Sítio Rio Grande about 50 km from São Desidério; and
4. Penedo Quarry.

At the Derocal locality, reddish dolomitic argillites display 
?13C values from +2.5 to +5‰, whereas at the Mineração 
do Oeste Quarry, limestones yielded ?13C values from +1.2 
to +2.2‰ in the first 16 m (base to top) changing abruptly 
up section to values in the +10 to +12‰ range in dark, 
organic matter-rich limestone. At the Sítio Rio Grande 
locality, 45 m of limestones were sampled and ?13C values 
vary from +13.5 to +15‰ in the first 30 m (base to top) 
and from +14 to +16‰ in the upper 15 m, organic mat-
ter-rich dark limestone. No negative ?13C value has been 
recorded in these ?13C profiles and a composite ?13C pathway 

is shown in Fig. 17. The C-isotope stratigraphy of the São 
Desidério Formation approaches that of the top of the Sete 
Lagoas and Lagoa do Jacaré formations described elsewhere 
by Santos et al. (2000).

Sergipano Belt
The Sergipano Belt is a fold-and-thrust belt located in the 

northeastern margin of the São Francisco Craton (Fig. 19) 
that was formed by the continental collision between the 
Congo-São Francisco Craton and the Pernambuco-Alagoas 
Massif during the Brasiliano/Pan-African orogeny (Brito 
Neves et al. 1977). It has been interpreted as a geosyncline 
(Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard, 1968; Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1979) 
and later as a collage of lithostratigraphic domains (Davison 
&amp;amp; Santos 1989; Silva Filho 1998) or as a Neoproterozoic 
belt produced by inversion of a passive margin basin located 
at the northeastern margin of the São Francisco plate (Del-
Rey Silva 1999).

This belt consists, from north to south, of six lithostrati-
graphic domains separated from each other by major shear 
zones: Canindé, Poço Redondo, Marancó, Macururé, Vaza 
Barris, and Estância (Santos &amp;amp; Souza 1988; Davison &amp;amp; 
Santos 1989; Silva Filho 1998). The Macururé, Vaza Barris, 
and Estância domains are composed mostly of metasedi-
mentary rocks with metamorphic grade from incipient (or 
non-metamorphic in the Estância Domain) through green-
schist grade, in the Vaza Barris, to amphibolite facies, in the 
Macururé Domain. Silva Filho &amp;amp; Torres (2002) and Silva 
Filho et al. (2003) have proposed three additional domains: 
Rio Coruripe, Viçosa, and Pernambuco-Alagoas. Further 
geological details on all domains of the Sergipano Belt are 
found in Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) and Santos et al. (1998).

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



The Juetê-Acauã, Ribeirópolis-Jacoca, and Palestina 
Olhos D’Água Formation diamictite-carbonate couplets in 
the Vaza Barris and Estância domains have been regarded 
as Neoproterozoic cap carbonates (Sial et al. 2000, 2006, 
2010). Their relative chronology and correlation with 
similar cap carbonates in southwestern Gondwana was 
constrained using carbon- and strontium-isotope chemo-
stratigraphy (Sial et al. 2010). Additionaly, a preliminary 
discussion on the use of Hg chemostratigraphy as a poten-
tial proxy for volcanism in the study of post-glacial cap 
carbonates was presented.

Stratigraphic studies on the Vaza Barris and Estancia 
domains of the Sergipano Belt were pioneered by Humphrey 
&amp;amp; Allard (1968, 1969) who divided the supracrustal sequences 
into two groups, Miaba and Vaza Barris, a stratigraphic 
scheme that was later modified by Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves 
(1979) and D’el-Rey Silva (1995, 1999). Among the most 
relevant modifications, D’el-Rey Silva (1995, 1999) pro-
posed that the Ribeiropolis Formation is older than for-
merly believed, placing it below the Jacoca Formation. It is 
assumed here that the Frei Paulo Formation sits on top of 
the Olhos D’Água Formation as accepted by most authors 
(Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 1969; Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1979; 
Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989).

The Estancia Group, northern Bahia, comprises the 
Juetê, Acauã, and Lagarto formations (Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito 
Neves 1979). These authors hypothesized that the Juetê and 
Ribeiropolis formations could be chrono-correlate as well as 
the Acauã and Jacoca formations, a contention that needs 
further confirmation.

Two depositional cycles both being represented by a basal 
continental to shallow-marine siliciclastic megasequence, 
overlain by a carbonate sequence have been recognized by 
D’el Rey-Silva (1995, 1999). These two cycles, with slight 
modifications, are:
1. Cycle I (Estância?Miaba Group) with a siliciclasticmega-

sequence including the Itabaiana (conglomerate, quartzite, 
metasiltite), Juetê (sandstone, diamictite), Ribeirópolis 
(silty phyllite, metagreywacke, pebbly phyllite, diamic-
tite) formations, and a carbonate sequence, represented 
by the Jacoca Formation, stratigraphically equivalent to 
the Acauã Formation;

2. Cycle II with an upper siliciclastic megasequence (Lagarto?
Palmares and Jacaré formations of the Simão Dias Group) 
overlain by the Vaza Barris Group that comprises dia-
mictites of the Palestina Formation, an upper carbonate 
megasequence (Olhos D’Água Formation) and the Frei 
Paulo Formation (pelite and siltstone with rare carbo-
nate rocks). These two megasequences underwent sub-
greenschistfacies metamorphism which has preserved 
original sedimentary structures.

The Estância-Miaba Group is well exposed around 
the Itabaiana and Simão Dias basement domes in Sergipe. 
The Ribeiropolis Formation is 0 ? 300 m thick around 
this dome and locally reaches thicknesses of about 500 m 
within the belt. It consists of diamictite, metagreywacke, 
and quartz-sericite phyllite transitionally overlying quartz-
ite of the Itabaiana Formation. The occurrence of volcanic 
rocks in this formation, in the west side of the Simão Dias 
dome, has been reported by D’el-Rey Silva (1995, 1999). 
Carbonates of the Jacoca Formation are seen in sharp con-
tact on top of the Ribeiropolis diamictite at the Capitão 
Farm along the Salgado River (western side of the Itabaiana 
dome). A typical section of the Jacoca Formation starts with 
a thick layer of laminated gray-to-pink dolostone contain-
ing pyrite and chalcopyrite. This is followed upsection by 
a 3- to 15-m-thick layer of laminated dolostone, and dark 
gray to black phyllites and about 10-m-thick bed of massive 
dolostone. This unit is overlain by a 40-m-thick heterolithic 
sequence of gray limestone and dark-to-dark phyllite and 
finally by gray dolostone.

At the Capitão Farm, the cap dolostone shows wavy 
lower contact. Clasts at the top of the diamictite of the 
Ribeiropolis Formation are concentrated and salient as a 
result, perhaps, of lithification and erosion prior to cap dolo-
stone deposition. Features suggesting soft sediment defor-
mation were observed in the diamictites and cap carbonates, 
which may be interpreted as the result of a rapid icehouse 
to greenhouse transition (e.g. Puga cap carbonate, Amazon 
Craton; Nogueira et al. 2003). Well-developed tubestone 
stromatolites occur at the dolostone cap carbonate in the 
Capitão Farm (Sial et al. 2010b).

Carbonate rocks of the Acauã Formation overlie either 
the Juetê diamictite or rest unconformably on basement 
gneiss. Well-preserved exposures of this contact occur in the 
western Vaza Barris Domain, between Euclides da Cunha 
and Bendegó villages, at Patamuté village and at the Serra da 
Borracha and at Serra da Canabrava (northeastern Bahia). 
The type locality of the Juetê Formation is at the Juetê River, 
about 6 km south of Bendegó, where it shows total thickness 
of about 30 m and is composed of buff sandstone, diamic-
tite (about 15 m thick), and reddish feldspathic sandstone 
and reddish claystone (Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1979).

The Acauã Formation consists of cap dolostone, lime-
stone (with dolostone dropstones) in proximal sections as 
seen at the Borracha Range, 20 km west of Patamuté, Bahia, 
and limestone/dolostone and limestone-shale rhythmites. 
Continuous sections of the Acauã Formation are exposed 
at Serra da Borracha and at Serra da Canabrava, as well as 
Patamuté Creek at Patamuté village and São Gonçalo Farm, 
about 25 km to the north of Euclides da Cunha village, 
Bahia (Sial et al. 2010b).

Dolostones of the Acauã Formation conformably over-
lie diamictites of the Juetê Formation, the former showing 
hummocky and, locally, pseudo-tepee structures. Up section, 
they pass into a fining and thinning-upward carbonate suc-
cession. Diamictites of the Juetê Formation contain clasts of 
granite, orthogneiss, phyllite, or quartz composition up to 
0.5 m in diameter, and locally display Fe-rich claystone beds.

The Olhos D’Agua Formation (200 – 1300 m) is com-
posed of interbedded limestones (organic-rich toward the 
top) and green, calcareous chlorite-schists, and siltyphyl-
lites. It overlies diamictites and pebbly metagreywackes of 
the Palestina Formation. Marble beds are interbedded with 
blue to black, fine-grained metalimestone and gray metado-
lostone. The thick carbonates around the Simão Dias dome 
pass upward into supratidal-intertidal facies with oolites and 
wave-reworked sedimentary structures indicating a near-shore 
environment (D’el-Rey Silva 1995). At the Capitão Range, 
about 25 km northwest of Paripiranga, Bahia, a 10-m-thick 
dolostone layer of the Olhos D’Agua Formation is in sharp 
contact with diamictite of the Palestina Formation (meta-
greywacke with clasts up to 30 cm in diameter) and followed 
up section by about 50 m of limestone–pelite intercalations. 
They are in turn overlain by laminated limestone (40 m thick) 
culminating with a 30-m-thick layer of organic-rich black.

The current geochronological data indicate that the 
deposition of Jacoca Formation carbonates is younger than 
780 Ma and the deposition of the Olhos D’Agua Formation 
carbonates took place took place after 653 Ma and before 
628 Ma (Sial et al. 2010).

Detrital zircons from the diamictite of the Juetê Formation, 
to the north of Euclides da Cunha, are older than 2073 Ma 
(Oliveira et al. 2008) and detrital zircons from sandstones of 
the Lagarto (on top of the Acauã Formation) and Palmares 
Formations display ages that cluster around 565 Ma, 582, 
633 Ma, 956 Ma, 977 Ma, and 1855 Ma.

The sections chemostratigraphically investigated in the 
Sergipano Belt by Sial et al. (2010) show well-preserved cap 
carbonates in knife-sharp contact with basal diamictites as 
known for Neoproterozoic cap carbonates worldwide (e.g. 
Kennedy 1996; Hoffman &amp;amp; Schrag 2002). Several localities 
in the eastern and western Vaza Barris Domain fulfill this 
requirement. Among them, Sial et al. (2010) have strati-
graphically sampled carbonates of the Jacoca Formation in 
sharp contact with diamictites of the Ribeiropolis Formation 
at Capitão Farm. The Acauã Formation overlies with sharp 
contact diamictites of the Juetê Formation at the Borracha 
Range, at the Patamuté Creek in the Patamuté village as well 
as at São Gonçalo Farm in the state of Bahia. Besides, car-
bonates of the Olhos D’Agua Formation in sharp contact 
with diamictites of the Palestina Formation at the Capitão 
Range were also sampled.

Several other localities in Sergipe and Bahia offer exposures 
of carbonate rocks of the Jacoca, Acauã, and Olhos D’Água. 
Among them, well-preserved carbonate exposures of the Acauã 
Formation at the Serra da Canabrava and at the Almeida Farm 
near the Serra da Borracha, and along the road between Euclides 
da Cunha and Bendengó (Bahia) have been sampled by Sial 
et al. (2010). Besides, continuous outcrops of the Olhos D’Agua 
Formation in the road Rosario-Cocorobó, Bahia, and south of 
Pinhão village, Sergipe, have been also sampled.

In the eastern Vaza Barris Domain, carbonates of the 
Jacoca Formation at the Capitão Farm show negative ?13C 
values, mostly between -5 and -4‰ while ?18O values are 
mostly around -8‰ VPDB (Fig. 20). Shallow-marine dolo-
stones of this formation display increasing ?13C values, from 
-6.2 to -4.3‰, interrupted by a sudden decrease to values 
of -6.7‰ at the base of the overlying deep shelf limestone 
succession. Such values shift back to values as high as -1.5‰ 
VPDB in its uppermost portion. The cap dolostones of this 
formation show relatively limited thickness (a couple of 
meters or less, especially in more distal sections).

In the western Vaza Barris Domain, detailed C and O 
isotope chemostratigraphy for the Acauã Formation (São 
Gonçalo Farm, Borracha and Canabrava Ranges, Patamuté 
and road Euclides da Cunha–Bendengó) revealed that ?13C 
values tend to group mostly between -5 and -4‰, within 
the range for mantle values (Hoffman &amp;amp; Schrag 2002). 
This highlights the role of mantle-derived CO2 in carbonate 
deposition in the aftermath of the glacial event represented 
by diamictites of the Juetê Formation.

At Serra da Borracha hill, ?13C values are kept very 
homogeneous (~ -5‰) for about 165 m. Only about 1 m 
of shallow marine dolostone is present in the base of the 
profile (part of the cap dolostones has been eroded away) 
being followed up section by 30 m of gray fine-grained lime-
stones with dolostones dropstones and limestone-dolostone 
rhythmites. ?18O values for this interval vary gradually from 
about -12 to about -5‰VPDB. Such enormous fraction-
ation, if primary, likely resulted from a gradual temperature 
decrease by the time dolostone-dropstones were deposited. 
Up section, an interval characterized by boudinaged dolo-
stone-limestone intercalations with plane-parallel lamina-
tion is observed indicating below wave-base deposition.

Carbonates at Serra da Canabrava Range show ?13C values 
from -6 to -0.2‰ and a package of light gray fine-grained 
limestones near the Almeida locality, nearby Canabrava 
Range, exhibits values from -0.5 to +0.3‰ and seem to be 
stratigraphically above the carbonate succession at Serra da 
Borracha. The nearly identical behavior of ?13C in the Acauã 
and Jacoca carbonates opens the possibility that they could 
have been simultaneously deposited, a contention that finds 
no support in the Sr isotope behavior as discussed later on.

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



Marly and dolomitic carbonates of the Olhos D’Agua 
Formation overlying diamictites of the Palestina Formation, 
near the road Simão Dias-Pinhão (Sergipe), display ?13C 
values as low as -4.7‰, increasing upsection to a plateau 
between 0 and 1‰ and finally to another plateau around 
+8 to +10‰. This pattern is observed in the sections at 
the Capitão Range, at the section in the Rosario-Cocorobó 
road (Bahia) and between Simão Dias and Pinhão villages 
(Sergipe). The ?18O values in these sections vary from -7 to 
-11‰ VPDB and ?13C, from -5 to +9 ‰ and seem to be 

primary regarding the low Mn/Sr and lack of co-variance 
between ?13C and Mn/Sr values (Fig. 20).

A section of the Olhos D’Água Formation near Rosário 
village, Bahia, shows an intercalation of limestones and silt-
stones, where the carbonate lenses show variable thickness. 
These carbonates have been deposited on top of diamictites 
of the Palestina Formation, the latter comprising pebbles, 
boulders, and blocks of granite, gneiss, black phyllite, black 
silexite, greenish quartz, and gray limestones. The ?13C val-
ues start with slightly negative values (~ -2‰) and about 
10 m from the base, values change dramatically and form 
a well-defined plateau around +9‰, while the ?18O values 
vary from -10 to -12‰ VPDB.

Strontium isotope ratios have been analyzed in forty car-
bonate samples from the Sergipano Belt including samples 
from the Acauã Formation (Borracha, Patamuté, São Gonçalo, 
Euclides da Cunha) and Olhos D’Agua Formation (Rosario 
and Capitão Hill) in the western Vaza Barris Domain and 
Jacoca Formation (Capitão Farm) and OlhosD’Agua Formation 
(road Simão Dias-Pinhão) in the eastern Vaza Barris Domain. 
Typically, carbonate samples with high Sr (&gt; 600 ppm), low 
Rb (&amp;lt;10 ppm), low Mn/Sr (&amp;lt;10), and low Mg/Ca (&amp;lt;0.2) 
ratios have been considered for Sr isotope-ratio analysis since 
usually samples which meet these requirements yield con-
sistent 87Sr/86Sr Sr ratios. However, when dolomite was the 
only carbonate present (Mg/Ca around 0.6), consistency of 
the 87Sr/86Sr ratios was the only selection criterion.

Carbonates of the Jacoca Formation have 87Sr/86Sr ratio 
values of 0.7077, 0.7081, and 0.7081 at Capitão Farm. Four 
analyses of carbonates of the Acauã Formation yielded con-
sistent results at the Borracha Range (two values of 0.7072 
and two, 0.7073) but very variable and higher values at the 
three other localities examined in the western Vaza Barris 
Domain (all dolostones). Three 87Sr/86Sr ratios for high-Sr 
carbonates of the Olhos D’Agua Formation in the section 
near Pinhão village yielded values of 0.7078, 0.7080, and 
0.7080. At Capitão Range, carbonates of this Formation 
have values of 0.7077–0.7081 and from 0.7077 to 0.7082 
at the section near Rosario Village. All these 87Sr/86Sr ratios 
are within the typical range for late Neoproterozoic seawa-
ter (Kaufman et al. 1993, 2009).

Therefore, carbonates of the Olhos D’Agua Formation 
from the three localities examined (eastern and western Vaza 
Barris domains) show nearly the same range of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, 
indistinguishable from that of the Jacoca Formation at the 
Capitão Farm. However, 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the Borracha Range 
are consistently lower than those for the Jacoca Formation, 
in contrast with ?13C values (all negative) that tend to fall 
in the same range for these two Formations.

87Sr/86Sr ratios (best preserved samples), are summarized 
in Table 1. Kaufman et al. (2009) have compiled 87Sr/86Sr 
ratios for limestones in cap carbonates across southwestern 
Gondwana and they seem to fall consistently within three 
modes with values near 0.7066, 0.7073, and 0.7081 repre-
sented, respectively, by the Rasthof, Maieberg, and Bildah 
cap carbonates in Namibia and their temporal equivalents. 
In this scheme of Kaufman et al. (2009), 87Sr/86Sr ratios 

for the Acauã Formation carbonates at the Borracha Range 
(0.7073) approach 87Sr/86Sr ratios for Sturtian II cap car-
bonates deposited between 740 and 635 Ma. In addition, 
similarly to the Maiberg cap carbonate, ?13C values at the 
Borracha Range are all negative. However, 87Sr/86Sr ratios as 
low as 0.7073 have been reported from Ediacaran, Cloudina-
bearing limestones in Uruguay (Gaucher et al. 2004, 2009) 
and are also similar to 87Sr/86Sr values of post-Marinoan

carbonates in NW Canada, NW Namibia, and SW Brazil 
(Halverson et al. 2007).

The ranges of 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the Jacoca and Olhos 
D’Agua formations are similar to each other (0.7077 
to 0.7081), in consonance with values reported for the 
Marinoan Bildah, Tsabisis, and Bloeddriff cap carbonates, 
Kalahari Craton. However, ?13C values for carbonates of 
Jacoca Formation at the Capitão Farm are all negative, in 
contrast with positive values observed in middle and upper 
sections of the Olhos D’Agua Formation in the eastern and 
western Vaza Barris domains. On structural grounds, it is 
known that Jacoca Formation must be slightly older than the 

Olhos D’Agua Formation (D’el Rey Silva 1995, 1999) and 
both have been weakly deformed during the Brasiliano cycle 
(650 – 600 Ma). Smilarities of 87Sr/86Sr ratios of post-Sturtian 
and post-Marinoan carbonates led Babinski et al. (2007) to 
question the use of Sr-isotope stratigraphy to differentiate 
and correlate postglacial carbonate successions.

The calcium-isotope record seems to be a true archive 
of changes in the oceanic Ca isotopic compositions and 
early Cryogenian ?44/40Ca patterns seem to be very differ-
ent from the Ediacaran ones (Silva-Tamayo et al. 2010a, 
2010b). Therefore, Ca-isotope stratigraphy appears to be a 
promising tool to discriminate and correlate Neoproterozoic

postglacial carbonate successions (Kasemann et al. 2005; 
Silva-Tamayo et al. 2010a, 2010b).

Stratigraphic changes of ?44/40Ca values of the weakly deformed 
carbonates of the Jacoca Formation, the deformed Cryogenian 
Sete Lagoas Formation, Minas Gerais, Brazil (740 ± 22 Ma; 
Babinski et al. 2007, but see also discussion above) and Twitya 
Formation (NW, Canada) are similar, according to Silva-Tamayo 
et al. (2010b), in support of a Cryogenian age. The basal dolostone 
of the Jacoca Formation displays increasing ?44/40Ca (NIST-SRM 915a) 
values from 0.3‰ to 2.0‰, followed by a decrease to values aver-
aging 0.8‰ at the top. The overlying limestones display ?44/40Ca 

(NIST-SRM 915a) values averaging 1.0‰ (Silva-Tamayo et al. 2010a).
The basal shallow-marine cap dolostone of the Acauã 

Formation displays ?44/40Ca(NIST-SRM 915a) values averaging 
0.7‰ according to Silva-Tamayo et al. (2010a) with a 
stepwise decrease to values around 0.2‰ at the base of the 
overlying limestone succession, followed by a rapid increase 
to 1.0‰ upsection. The Ca-isotope stratigraphic pathway 
displayed by this cap carbonate, according to these authors, 
is indistinguishable from those displayed by cap carbon-
ates overlying ca. 635 Ma glacial deposits in NW Namibia.

Seridó Belt: Jucurutu 
and Seridó formations

The Seridó Belt in northeastern Brazil encompasses 
a metavolcano-sedimentary sequence that was deposited 

discordantly on a Paleoproterozoic basement, and has 
been intensely studied in the last fifty years (Fig. 21). 
This belt was affected by a strong transpressional defor-
mation, intrusion of voluminous granitic magmas, and 
reworking by transcurrent structures that imparted an 
N-NE trend to this belt. The original stratigraphic rela-
tionships have been obscured by intense deformation and 
this led to divergent interpretations of the sedimentation 
age, stratigraphy, and evolution of the supracrustal rocks, 
in spite of several geochronological, geochemical, and 
structural studies (Jardim de Sá et al. 1988, 1994; Caby 
et al. 1995; Archanjo et al. 2013; Van Schmus et al. 2003; 
Hollanda et al. 2015).

Among several stratigraphic schemes proposed for the 
Seridó Belt, the most commonly used (Jardim de Sá &amp;amp; 
Salim 1980) includes all metasedimentary rocks of this 
belt in the Seridó Group. This group is subdivided from 
base to top into:
1. Jucurutu Formation, composed of a basal conglomerate, 

iron-formation, marble layers intercalated in gneisses, 
mica-schist, quartzite, calc-silicate rocks and metavol-
canic rocks;

2. Equador Formation, predominantly composed of quart-
zite with metaconglomerate lenses, which become more 
abundant toward the top, calc-silicate rocks and parag-
neisses; and

3. the Seridó Formation, which is made up of metacon-
glomerate, feldspathic, or aluminous mica-schist with 
subordinate marble, calc-silicate rocks, paragneiss, basic 
metavolcanic rocks, and quartzite.

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



The Equador Formation exhibits variable thickness and 
can be absent in certain portions of the belt (Jardim de Sá 
1994 and references therein). In this scheme, the whole 
package in the Seridó Belt resulted from a megacycle of 
sedimentation lacking regional unconformities. The asso-
ciation of iron formation, marble and calc-silicate parag-
neisses of the Jucurutu Formation could be of shallow-ma-
rine environment, although the banded iron formation 
(BIF) depositional environment could be slope or basinal. 
The Equador Formation is the siliciclastic component of 
this shallow-marine association, while mica-schists of the 
Seridó Formation correspond to a thick package of turbid-
itic, flyschoid deposits marking the inversion of the basin, 
according to Jardim de Sá (1994).

A different stratigraphic column was proposed by 
Caby et al. (1995) in which supracrustal rocks were sub-
divided into the Jucurutu Group and the overlying Seridó 
Group with a hiatus (regional unconformity) of deposi-
tion between them. Recently reported U-Pb ages of detri-
tal zircons and Nd isotope compositions from the Seridó 
Group indicate a significant change of sediment prove-
nance during the deposition of sands and conglomerates 
and the overlying greywacke-pelite sequences (Hollanda 
et  al. 2015). According to these authors, this shift in 
provenance defines an unconformity in the Seridó Group 
characterized by a metadiamictite horizon with pebbles 
and cobbles from the Paleoproterozoic to Archean base-
ment and recycled quartzites of the underlying Equador 
Formation. The change in provenance is defined by a 
cryptic internal disconformity that is characterized by a 
time gap of about 1.0 Ga in the age of the detrital zircons. 
Nd compositions across this unconformity indicate that 
the pelites are very radiogenic (?Ndpresent-day = -4 to -11) 
compared with the sandy deposits (?Ndpresent-day = -22 to 
-31). The provenance of the metapelites at the top of the 
metasedimentary succession includes a prominent popu-
lation of Cryogenian zircons whose youngest grains dated 
to between 0.64 and 0.62 Ga. According to Hollanda et al. 
(2015), these zircons were deposited in a basin developed 
on continental basement that preserves remnants of near-
shore to terrestrial deposits with no detrital zircons younger 
than 1.8 Ga. More importantly, Hollanda et al. (2015) 
have raised the possibility that the Equador Formation 
lies stratigraphically below the Jucurutu Formation and 
that the Seridó and Jucurutu formations could actually 
be equivalent stratigraphically.

In the Jucurutu Formation, metric to decametric-scale 
marble layers, sometimes compositionally banded, are 
abundant and occur at three stratigraphic levels, one of 
which is near the base of the succession (Jardim de Sá 1994; 
Nascimento et al. 2007). In the Seridó Formation, marble 

layers are less abundant and are only found near the base of 
this formation (extensional tectonic stage). The lack of car-
bonates in the latter is due to the tectonic inversion (early 
compressional stage) in the evolution of the basin (Jardim 
de Sá 1994). Marble layers intercalated in the Jucurutu 
Formation are found in the northern, central, southern, 
and western portions of the Seridó Belt.

Investigation on TDM model ages of metasedimen-
tary rocks (Van Schmus et al. 1996) suggests maximum 
ages between 1.6 and 1.2 Ga for the Jucurutu and Seridó 
formations. Van Schmus et al. (2003) determined U-Pb 
SHRIMP ages of detrital zircons from a paragneiss 
 (EC-61) of the Jucurutu Formation from its type area, 
finding a youngest age of 634 ± 13 Ma. These authors 
also reported an U-Pb SHRIMP age of 628 ± 16 Ma for 
detrital zircons from the younger Seridó Formation using 
a mica-schist sample collected near Pedra Preta, state 
of Rio Grande do Norte. These data suggested that the 
maximum depositional age for the Jucurutu and Seridó 
formations is ca. 630 Ma, preceding the peak of meta-
morphism in the Brasiliano (= Pan-African) orogeny in 
this region (ca. 600 – 585 Ma; Hollanda et  al. 2010). 
However, newly reported U-Pb zircon ages for the Acari 
granite (577 – 572 Ma) and Santa Luzia migmatite con-
strain the HT/LP metamorphism of the Seridó to 575 Ma 
(Archanjo et al. 2013).

Depending on the nature of the supracrustal rocks, as 
well as on the tectonic and metamorphic history of the 
region, it is difficult to date rocks by radiogenic methods, 
and C and Sr chemostratigraphy may assist resolve issues 
such as stratigraphy and sedimentation age (Melezhik et al. 
2001). In highly metamorphosed regions (e.g. amphibolite 
facies), as is the case throughout most of the Seridó Belt, 
the interpretation of depositional patterns of sedimenta-
tion, as well as C- and Sr-isotope variations, can be severely 
compromised. In a preliminary attempt to estimate the 
age of deposition of carbonate rocks of the Seridó Group 
(Jucurutu and Seridó formations) using C- and Sr-isotope 
chemostratigraphy, Nascimento et al. (2004, 2007) have 
examined nine marble layers and proposed a depositional 
age around 600 Ma.

As part of the meta-volcanosedimentary Seridó Belt, 
BIFs abound and the couplet formed by BIFs in sharp 
contact with overlying carbonate rocks of the Jucurutu 
Formation may represent a record of deposition in the 
aftermath of one of the Neoproterozoic glaciations. To help 
addressing this issue, Sial et al. (2015a) have examined field 
relationships, behavior of C and Sr isotopes in carbonates 
of the Jucurutu Formation, Cr isotopes in BIF and car-
bonates, and rare-earth elements in both carbonates and 
BIFs. Six sections were sampled across marble layers of the

Jucurutu Formation, and two drill cores from the Bonito 
iron Mine have been studied. One of these sections is 
located at the western flank of the Bonito iron Mine anti-
form, about 20 km north of the town of Jucurutu. At this 
locality, drill cores from boreholes BTO-34 (240 m) and 
BTO-78 (16 m) of the MHAG Mining Company have 
been micro-drilled. The ?13C shows large variation and in 
the BTO-34 drill hole, displays values from -12 to -5‰ 
at the base followed up section by a shift to positive val-
ues (+4 to +10‰, Fig. 22). A similar trend is observed for 
drill core 78, but carbonates at the contact with underly-
ing BIF show a more vigorous ?13C fluctuation, with val-
ues as low as -12‰ in their lowest portion. No clear cor-
relation exists between ?13C and ?18O for these samples, 
except for ?13C values below -5‰, which also exhibit the 
most negative ?18O values. Apart from these few samples, 
?13C values probably represent near-primary isotope sig-
nals. Nascimento et al. (2004, 2007) found no co-varia-
tion between ?13C and Mn/Sr ratios or between ?13C and 
?18O for carbonates of the Jucurutu Formation, support-
ing the primary nature of isotopic signals.

Two sections across marble layers (surface samples) were 
studied near the town of Ouro Branco (Sial et al. 2015a). 
One of these sections is only 300 m from diamictite outcrops 
and the other section at about 1 km northwest from this 
locality. There is no clear stratigraphic relationship between 

the Ouro Branco diamictite and these marble layers, which 
show little variation of ?13C and ?18O, ?13C ranging between 
+8.9 and +9.7‰. As a whole (the two sections), ?18O varies 
from -13.0 to to -7.2‰ VPDB.

Sial et al. (2015a) studied three sections of marble layers 
at Serra da Formiga. All show positive ?13C values ranging 
from +2.9 to +8.3‰ VPDB while ?18O values vary from 
-11 to -6.2‰ VPDB. Marble layers associated with BIF at 
the Riacho Fundo locality display positive ?13C values within 
the 7 – 9‰ interval, a range similar to that observed in a 
marble layer of the the Jucurutu Formation, at the town of 
Jucurutu, reported by Nascimento et al. (2007).

Marbles of the Jucurutu Formation were metamor-
phosed up to amphibolites facies, precluding the use of 
?18O as an indicator of seawater composition. An ample 
fluctuation of ?18O values, from -16 to -3 to‰ VPDB 
is observed, probably in response to metamorphism or 
weathering imprint. At the Cruzeiro da Maniçoba local-
ity, near Currais Novos town, basal pink dolostones from 
the younger Seridó Formation show ?13C values around 
-4‰ and ?18O from -16.5 to -12‰ VPDB. Positive ?13C 
values around +9‰ in marbles of the Seridó Formation 
(e.g. São Mamede) have been reported by Nascimento 
et al. (2007). It became clear to Sial et al. (2015a) that the 
Jucurutu and Seridó Formations exhibit negative ?13C val-
ues at their base followed upsection by high positive values,

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



something which was not depicted from the sections stud-
ied by Nascimento et al. (2007).

Nascimento et al. (2007) determined 87Sr/86Sr ratios 
for Jucurutu carbonates between 0.7074 and 0.7075 and 
between 0.7078 and 0.7083 for the Seridó Formation. Sial 
et al. (2015a) analyzed 87Sr/86Sr ratios in marbles from the 
Jucurutu Formation at the Bonito iron Mine (10), Ouro 
Branco (10), Serra da Formiga (3), and Riacho Fundo (2) 
sections. Samples from the Bonito iron Mine yielded con-
sistent results, between 0.7074 and 0.7075, the same as 
reported by Nascimento et al. (2007) from samples from 
Jucurutu town (type area). Samples from the Ouro Branco and 
Serra da Formiga sections yielded values between 0.7074 
and 0.7076. Most of the analyzed samples are pure lime-
stones with high Sr contents (up to 3000 ppm) and very 
low Rb (&amp;lt;10 ppm), thus the measured isotopic composi-
tions likely represent primary signals. 87Sr/86Sr values for 
dolomitic carbonates of the Seridó Formation at Cruzeiro 
da Maniçoba section obtained in this study are consider-
ably higher (0.7077 ? 0.7139) and are less consistent, as 
expected for dolostones.

Usually, highly metamorphosed carbonates have C 
and Sr-isotope patterns severely complicated by iso-
topic re-equillibration due to metamorphic reactions. 
However, marbles of the Seridó Belt seem to preserve 
near primary C- and Sr-isotope ratios, as known from 
other successions up to the high metamorphic grade 
(Melezhik et  al. 2008; Chiglino et  al. 2010). This is 
probably due to their pure calcitic composition, which 
determined only very limited metamorphic reactions 
between different mineral phases. In the particular case of 
the Jucurutu Formation, Nascimento et al. (2007) show 
that near-primary, unaltered 87Sr/86Sr values are encoun-
tered in samples with ?18O &gt; -15‰ VPDB, Sr concen-
trations &gt; 2000 ppm Sr and Mn/Sr &amp;lt;0.05. All samples 
of the Jucurutu Formation that yielded 87Sr/86Sr values 
in the range 0.7074 ? 0.7076 fulfill these criteria and 
are interpreted as near-primary.

The 87Sr/86Sr ratios range observed in the Jucurutu 
Formation is compatible with values reported for the late 
Cryogenian (Halverson et al. 2005, 2010), although sim-
ilar 87Sr/86Sr values also occur in the Ediacaran (to which 
ferruginous deep-waters were also associated) as registered 
in Cloudina-bearing limestones in Uruguay (Gaucher et al. 
2009; Frei et al. 2011) and Argentina (Gómez Peral et al. 
2007). One cannot discard, however, that seawater has likely 
undergone important changes of its 87Sr/86Sr ratios after 
major Neoproterozoic glacial events due to input of con-
tinental waters from ice melting and strong weathering in 
continents, blurring the true seawater 87Sr/86Sr values during 
deposition of carbonates (Zhao et al. 2009).

Recently, chromium stable isotopes in BIFs and iron-
rich cherts have been shown to reflect the redox sensitivity 
of the Cr(III) – Cr(VI) pair in geological and oceanographic 
processes (Frei et al. 2009). Chromium is highly sensitive 
to the redox state of the surface environment, oxidative 
weathering processes producing the oxidized hexavalent 
Cr. Oxidation of the reduced Cr on land is accompanied 
by isotopic fractionation (Frei et al. 2009 and references 
therein). The isotopic systematic of the chromium cycle 
including incorporation into BIF has been discussed into 
details by Lyons &amp;amp; Reinhard (2009). Stable Cr isotopes from 
BIFs and Fe-chert can track the presence of hexavalent Cr 
in Precambrian oceans providing a picture of the oxygen-
ation history of the Earth’s atmosphere-hydrosphere system 
as demonstrated by Frei et al. (2009). Chromium stable iso-
topes in Fe-rich chemical sediments deposited during glacial 
events are suitable for tracing oxygenation of surface envi-
ronments through Earth’s history. Besides, Cr isotopes in 
carbonates may be useful as a tracer for climate change and 
for reconstructing the redox state of ancient seawater (Frei 
et al. 2011; Bonnand et al. 2013).

Cr-isotope data for late Neoproterozoic BIFs reported 
by Frei et al. (2009) include 755 – 730-Myr-old Rapitan 
BIF, deposited during the early Cryogenian (‘Sturtian’) 
glaciation, the Marinoan-aged Chuos BIF, Namibia, and 
BIF- and Fe-bearing cherts of the 570 – 550-Ma Yerbal and 
Cerro Espuelitas formations, Uruguay, deposited well after 
the Gaskiers glaciation (Frei et al. 2009, 2013). BIFs depos-
ited during the late Neoproterozoic record strongly positive 
?53Cr values ranging from 0.5‰ to 4.9‰. This supports 
the occurrence of a Neoproterozoic oxygenation Event 
(NOE) which was accompanied by tectonic upheaval, cli-
matic extremes, and biological innovations (Shields-Zhou 
&amp;amp; Och, 2011; Och &amp;amp; Shields-Zhou 2012). However, Cr 
isotope data available for the late Neoproterozoic are limited 
to a few units, and suggestions for widespread ocean anoxia 
during the NOE (Shields-Zhou &amp;amp; Och 2011) request fur-
ther information from the Cr-isotope tracer system.

In an attempt to provide information on the redox 
state of oceans in the early Ediacaran, Døssing et al. (2010) 
applied Cr isotope systematics to the Jacadigo Group, a 
glacio-marine succession in central Brazil deposited after 
700 Ma (Babinski et al. 2013). This group is composed 
of the Urucum Formation (sandstones) at the base and 
the Santa Cruz Formation (BIF) at the top. Cr stable iso-
tope measurements on various BIF horizons of the Santa 
Cruz Formation yielded mostly positive ?53Cr values up 
to +0.9‰, while the Fe-rich glaciogenic diamictites and 
associated BIF of the likely correlative Puga Formation 
yielded ?53Cr values from to +0.1 to+0.4‰. According 
to Døssing et al. (2010) and Gaucher et al. (2015), these

positively fractionated values speak for the occurrence of 
atmospheric oxygenation pulses during deglaciation stages, 
which enabled the oxidative weathering and mobilization 
of trivalent Cr into the oceans.

Sial et al. (2015a) have analyzed Cr isotopes in BIFs 
and overlying carbonates of the Jucurutu Formation. 
The Cr concentrations of these BIFs are remarkably high 
compared to other iron formations (e.g. Frei et al. 2009), 
with values between 85 and 400 ppm. The Jucurutu BIFs 
are also characterized by high-temperature magmatic ?53Cr 
values (?53Cr = -0.123 ± 0.102 ‰; Schoenberg et al. 2008; 
Crowe et al. 2013), unlike the other late Neoproterozoic 
BIFs so far analyzed (Frei et  al. 2009, 2013; Døssing 
et  al. 2010) which all yielded strongly positively frac-
tionated ?53Cr signatures. Whereas ?53Cr values for BIF 
from the Bonito iron Mine vary from -0.23 to -0.12‰ 
(Cr concentration: 85 to 200 ppm), BIF from the Serra 
da Formiga and Saco Redondo yielded ?53Cr values from 
-0.31 to -0.14‰ (Cr concentration: 110 to 300 ppm). 
BIFs from the Riacho Fundo locality display the lowest 
?53Cr values in the interval of -0.42 to -0.14‰ (Cr con-
centration: 220 to 400 ppm).

At two sections (Saco Redondo and Riacho Fundo), the 
more negative ?53Cr values occur in the top 5 m of section 
and could be related to the effect of surface weathering, 
which mobilizes positively fractionated Cr(VI) and leaves 
negatively fractionated soils behind (Berger &amp;amp; Frei 2013; 
Frei &amp;amp; Polat 2013; Crowe et al. 2013). However, unweath-
ered drill core samples from the Bonito Mine also show 
negative ?53Cr values throughout a 30-m-thick section, 
between 115 and 146 m depth. It is unrealistic to assume 
significant weathering for samples at &gt; 100 m depth in a 
semi-arid area such as the Seridó Belt. Furthermore, other 
lines of evidence indicate that negative ?53Cr values are not 
the product of weathering, but represent primary features 
of the Jucurutu BIF, namely:
1. Surface samples yielded essentially the same ?53Cr values 

as those from &gt;100 m deep boreholes, showing that 
weathering is not the cause of the observed negative Cr 
isotope ratios;

2. Cr concentrations of the Jucurutu BIF are so high (avg. 
220 ppm) that it would necessitate an unrealistic fluid-
-rock interaction during weathering to change the iso-
topic composition;

3. If weathering is responsible for the observed negative 
?53Cr values, overlying carbonates must have suffered 
similar or even worse alteration. With much lower 
Cr concentrations in the carbonates (avg. 6 ppm), 
their isotopic composition should have been altered 
even more than BIFs. However, they yielded similar 
or even higher ?53Cr values than BIFs, which cannot 

be explained if weathering played a significant role in 
their isotopic composition.

To assess the degree of detrital contamination, Sial et al. 
(2015a) have plotted Sc concentrations for the studied BIFs 
and marbles samples against ?53Cr. All samples consistently 
plot outside the detrital Cr-dominated field for ?53Cr (Frei 
et al. 2013), suggesting that the basin was characterized by 
minimal terrigenous input from the continent. The nega-
tive ?53Cr values reported by Sial et al. (2015a) probably is 
a record of primary signals, related to hydrothermal vents 
(see below).Marble samples in the Bonito iron Mine have 
“normal” Cr concentrations (1 – 3 ppm) and marbles from 
the Riacho Fundo and Serra da Formiga localities display 
slightly higher Cr values (4 – 10 ppm). Apart from a few 
carbonate samples from the Bonito iron Mine which are 
slightly positively fractionated (?53Cr around -0.05‰), 
the other samples have unfractionated ?53Cr values within the 
high-temperature magmatic field.

Ubajara Group: Frecheirinha Formation
The Frecheirinha Formation is a carbonate unit about 

500 m in thickness whose type area is located near the 
Frecheirinha town, state of Ceará (Fig. 23), and the best 
exposures are observed at the quarry of the Companhia 
Cearense de Cimento Portland, north of the Aprazível vil-
lage (Chiglino et al. 2015 and references therein). The strata 
exhibit intense ductile deformation recorded by folds with axes 
with a NE-SW trend and, locally, low-grade metamorphism.

Carbonate rocks are represented by limestones and marly 
rythmites in the lower part of the formation, passing into 
dark gray to gray, fine, laminated, stromatolitic limestones 
at the top. In the Araticum area, carbonates are composed 
of fine-grained, calcitic mudstones (grain size: 10 mm) 
intercalated with organic-rich marls in which microfossils 
are preserved. On the other hand, in the Angustura Farm 
region recrystallization of carbonates is evident, and the 
occurrence of tremolite in these limestones indicates low-
grade metamorphic conditions. This metamorphism was 
probably caused by the intrusion of the nearby Mucambo 
granite and is not regional in nature.

Chiglino et al. (2015) selected the Araticum profile, 
located between the Frecheirinha and Ubajara villages, for 
palynological study because of the lower thermal overprint. 
There, limestone–marl rhythmites occur at the base, which 
pass into dark gray to black, finely laminated, organic-rich 
limestones, at the top.

Barroso et al. (2014) reported the occurrence of probable 
soft-bodied Ediacaran fossils in the overlying Jaibaras Group, 
similar to the White Sea assemblage, which could assure an 
Ediacaran age to this unit (560 – 542 Ma, Narbonne 2005;

Fedonkin et al. 2007). These biostratigraphic relationships can 
provide a minimum late Ediacaran age for the Frecheirinha 
Formation, but it needs more detailed study to prove the 
paleontological affinity of the fossils. The certification of a 
real relationship with the fossils of the Ediacara fauna needs 
more investigation.

The age of the Ubajara Group is still uncertain due to 
the lack of reliable radiometric ages. The minimum age is 
constrained by the following ages:
1. a Rb-Sr age of 562 ± 19 Ma determined for the Coreaú 

dike swarm, which crosscuts the sequence (Sial &amp;amp; 
Long 1987);

473

Alcides Nobrega Sial et al.



2. the Mucambo granite intrudes the Ubajara Group and 
yielded a U–Pb crystallization age of 532 ± 7 Ma (Santos 
et al. 2008); and

3. a Rb-Sr age of 540 ± 24 Ma (Sial 1989), a U-Pb age of 
532 ± 24 Ma (Fetter et al. 2003), and a U-Pb SHRIMP 
age of 541 ± 5 Ma (Santos et al. 2013) for the Meruoca 
granite, which intrudes the group and develops an impor-
tant contact aureole. The U-Pb SHRIMP age of 541 Ma 
is considered the best age estimate for the crystallization 
of the pluton.

Chemostratigraphic data presented by Chiglino (2013) 
show negative ?13C values of -3.5 ‰ at the base, passing 
up section into a positive excursion with maximum values 
of +3.7‰ (Fig. 24). Corresponding 87Sr/86Sr values range 
between 0.7075 and 0.7080 (Sial et al. 2003). Especially 
the Sr isotope ratios, which were obtained from high-Sr 
limestones (Sr concentration up to 3500 ppm; Chiglino 
2013), favor a latest Cryogenian to Ediacaran depositional 

age (e.g. Halverson et al. 2007). However, latest Cryogenian 
successions are often characterized by elevated ?13C val-
ues of up to +8‰ which drop to negative values before 
the end-Cryogenian glaciation (Halverson et al. 2005). 
This pattern is not observed in the Frecheirinha Formation. 
Instead, a plateau around +3‰ characterizes most of the 
unit and postdates a negative excursion, similar to that 
observed for the late Ediacaran Nama and Corumbá groups 
(Grotzinger et al. 1995; Boggiani et al. 2010), which also 
yielded similar acritarchs as the Frecheirinha Formation 
(Chiglino et al. 2015). Likewise, a negative excursion fol-
lowed by moderately positive values is also observed in the 
late Ediacaran upper Polanco Formation (Arroyo del Soldado 
Group, Uruguay), which is also associated to 87Sr/86Sr val-
ues between 0.7070 and 0.7082 (Gaucher et al. 2009; Frei 
et al. 2011). Thus, the chemostratigraphic data suggest an 
Ediacaran age as the most probable depositional age of the 
Frecheirinha Formation, but so far do not allow a more 
refined geochronology.

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



RIO DE LA PLATA CRATON 
(URUGUAY AND ARGENTINA)

Neoproterozoic carbonate deposits occur both at the east-
ern and western sides of the Río de la Plata Craton (RPC). 
Whereas successions deposited at the eastern side are well 
preserved and largely unmetamorphosed (e.g. Gaucher et al. 
2008a; Poiré &amp;amp; Gaucher, 2009), carbonates occurring at the 
western side were strongly deformed and metamorphosed 
during the Early Cambrian Pampean Orogeny. Due to this 
fact there is a paucity of chemostratigraphic studies at the 
western boundary of the RPC; of interest are those of the 
Puncoviscana Formation (Toselli et al. 2012) and carbon-
ates of the Difunta Correa Sequence (Galindo et al. 2004). 
The latter unit may be unrelated to the RPC and only later 
tectonically accreted (e.g. Ramacciotti et al. 2015).

At the eastern side of the RPC, Neoproterozoic sedi-
mentary units crop out in two different tectonostratigraphic 
terranes (Fig. 25), namely:
1. Nico Pérez Terrane, which crops out mainly in Uruguay, 

but also in southernmost Brazil. Neoproterozoic succes-
sions include the Las Ventanas and Playa Hermosa for-
mations, the Arroyo del Soldado Group and the Marco 
de los Reyes Formation, and only the two latter units 
contain carbonates. As will be shown below, all these 
units are Ediacaran to lowermost Cambrian in age;

2.  Tandilia Terrane, in the sense of Bossi and Cingolani 
(2009) and Abre et al. (2014), crops out both in the 
Tandilia area in Argentina (Buenos Aires Province) and 
in southern Uruguay. The Neoproterozoic units occur-
ring in the Tandilia Terrane include the Sierras Bayas 
Group in Argentina, and its likely correlative Piedras

de Afilar Formation in Uruguay (Pamoukaghlián et al. 
2014). These units are also largely Ediacaran in age.

Arroyo del Soldado Group (Uruguay)
The opening of the Arroyo del Soldado basin is recorded 

in the underlying rift deposits of the Las Ventanas and 
Playa Hermosa formations. The Las Ventanas Formation 
represents a deepening-upward sequence with conglom-
erates at the base and middle, passing into sandstones and 
finally shales with marine acritarchs at the top (Masquelin 
&amp;amp; Sánchez Bettucci 1993; Blanco &amp;amp; Gaucher 2005, 2014; 
Gaucher et al. 2008b). Basalts occur at the base of the unit 
and acid volcanics and pyroclastics at the top, representing 
synsedimentary, bimodal volcanism (Gaucher et al. 2008b).

The ages of volcanic rocks allow constraining the depo-
sition of the Las Ventanas Formation between 590 ± 2 Ma 
and 573 ± 11 Ma (Mallmann et al. 2007; Oyhantçabal et al. 
2009). Glaciogenic diamictites occurring in the lower third 
have been correlated with the Gaskiers Glaciation (Blanco 
&amp;amp; Gaucher 2005; Gaucher et al. 2008b) which took place 
at ca. 583 Ma (Bowring et al. 2003).

The Playa Hermosa Formation is a deep-water correlate 
of the Las Ventanas Formation (Pazos et al. 2003; Rapalini 
et al. 2015). Its age is constrained between 594 ± 16 Ma 
(youngest detrital zircon U-Pb age) and 578 ± 4 Ma for 
intruding magmatic rocks (Rapalini et al. 2015), confirm-
ing its coeval deposition with respect to the Las Ventanas 
Formation. Glacially influenced deposits were also described 
from this unit (Pazos et al. 2003).

The Arroyo del Soldado Group (ASG) represents the 
drift stage after deposition of the rift deposits, compris-
ing a marine platform succession exceeding 5,000 m in 
thickness. It rests unconformably on top of Archaean to 
Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Nico Pérez Terrane (Gaucher 
2000, 2014). In ascending stratigraphic order, the ASG 
is made up of the following formations (Gaucher 2000, 
2014): Barriga Negra (conglomerates and sandstones), 
Yerbal (sandstones, shale, BIF, and minor dolostones), 
Polanco (carbonates), Cerro Espuelitas (shales, BIF, and 
chert), Cerros San Francisco (quartz-arenites), and Cerro 
Victoria (dolostones).

Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the lower Barriga Negra 
Formation provide a maximum age constraint of 566 ± 8 Ma 
(Blanco et al. 2009). Cloudina riemkeae, index fossil of the 
late Ediacaran (Grant 1990; Gaucher &amp;amp; Germs 2009), occurs 
in the upper Yerbal Formation and in the lower-middle 
Polanco Formation (Gaucher &amp;amp; Poiré 2009a). Trace fossils 
assigned to Thalassinoidesisp were described from the Cerro 
Victoria Formation, showing that this unit is already Early 
Cambrian in age (Sprechmann et al. 2004). Thus, except 
for the Cerro Victoria Formation and possibly also the 

Cerros San Francisco quartz-arenites, the age of the ASG 
is late Ediacaran.

Several chemostratigraphic studies were carried out in 
the ASG, including C, O, Sr, Cr, and Nd isotopes, iron spe-
ciation and REE analyses. We summarize in the following 
main findings of these studies.

Only scarce chemostratigraphic data are available for 
marls of the upper Barriga Negra Formation, ?13C varying 
between -5.5 and -1.4‰ (Gaucher et al. 2004, this work). 
In the Yerbal Formation, ?13C values for interbedded dolo-
stones are positive, increasing from 1.2 to 2.2‰ toward the 
top (Gaucher et al. 2004). These values may be interpreted 
as postdating those of the Barriga Negra Formation, which 
are all negative. ?53Cr values of ferruginous cherts and BIF 
yielded strongly positive values of up to 5‰ SRM 979 (Frei 
et al. 2013), which are interpreted as reflecting oxygenic 
weathering in the source area. It is worth noting that these 
?53Cr values are the highest so far obtained for iron forma-
tions (Frei et al. 2009).

Due to the pure and uninterrupted carbonates that 
compose the unit, the Polanco Formation represents a for-
midable chemostratigraphic archive (Fig. 26). Three pos-
itive ?13C excursions occur at the base (P1), middle (P2), 
and upper parts of the unit (P3), reaching 5.5‰, 2.1‰, 
and 4.1‰, respectively (Gaucher et al. 2004, 2009; Frei 
et al. 2011; Fig. B). The intervening negative excursions 
coincide with regressions, the most prominent being N1, 
which encompasses 200 m of section and drops to nadir 
?13C values of -4.5‰ (Gaucher et  al. 2004, 2009b). 
This  negative excursion has been correlated with the 
Shuram-Wonoka anomaly (Gaucher et al. 2009b; Boggiani 
et al. 2010; Frei et al. 2011; Gaucher 2014), which ended 
just before 551 ± 1 Ma (Condon et al. 2005). The upper 
N2 negative excursion (-2 ‰ VPDB) marks the top of 
the Polanco Formation (Gaucher et al. 2004, 2009; Frei 
et al. 2011; Fig. 26).

Secular variations can be recognized in the 87Sr/86Sr 
curve of the Polanco Formation (Gaucher et al. 2009b; Frei 
et al. 2011; Gaucher 2014), which are relevant to deter-
mine the precise shape of the global Ediacaran 87Sr/86Sr 
curve. Limestones contain in average 1025 ppm Sr, reach-
ing more than 3000 ppm (Gaucher et al. 2009; Gaucher 
2014). 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.7087 at the base of the Polanco 
Formation decrease steadily up section, reaching a plateau 
around 0.7070 in the middle part of the unit (Gaucher et al. 
2009; Frei et al. 2011; Fig. 26). 87Sr/86Sr analyses are more 
erratic in the upper part of the unit, but it seems clear that 
there is a return to higher ratios of 0.7080 ? 0.7085 (Gaucher 
et al. 2009; Frei et al. 2011). The more than 300 m of sec-
tion characterized by low 87Sr/86Sr values encompasses the 
N1 negative ?

13C excursion. On the basis of elevated ?Nd(t)

values in the same carbonates (Fig. 26), Frei et al. (2011) 
proposed that the fall of 87Sr/86Sr values may represent a 
distal hydrothermal signature caused by widespread rifting 

elsewhere. A similar pattern is observed between the late 
Triassic and Late Jurassic, when 87Sr/86Sr fell between more

than 0.7080 and 0.7068 (e.g. Veizer et al. 1999), related to 
the breakup of Pangaea.

Only minor carbonate interbeds occur in the overlying 
Cerro Espuelitas Formation, which yielded negative ?13C val-
ues, interpreted as a continuation of the N2 negative excursion 
of the upper Polanco Formation (Gaucher et al. 2004, 2009). 
Magnetite BIF of the same unit yielded positive ?53Cr values 
of up to 1.3‰ SRM 979 (Frei et al. 2013), thus lower than 
hematite-bearing BIF of the Yerbal Formation. At the top of 
the ASG, the Cerro Victoria Formation yielded a low-am-
plitude ?13C curve consistent with an earliest Cambrian age 
(Gaucher et al. 2007; Sprechmann et al. 2004).

Combined bio- and chemostratigraphic data enabled the 
correlation at the formational level between the Corumbá 
and Arroyo del Soldado Groups, and between the latter 
unit and the Sierras Bayas Group in Argentina (see below). 
These correlations (Fig. 27) suggest that an extensive carbon-
ate platform covered the eastern RPC in the late Ediacaran 
and likely continued northwards into the Rio Apa Block 
(Gaucher et al. 2003, 2008a).

Marco de los Reyes 
Formation (Uruguay)

This unit was erected by Chiglino et al. (2010) to include 
a sedimentary succession occurring in the Nico Pérez Terrane 
and metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies. The unit com-
prises dark limestone, BIF, chert, and mica-schist. Limestones 
yielded ?13C values between 4.4 and -3.2‰. Corresponding 
87Sr/86Sr values consistently fall between 0.7070 and 0.7080 
for high-Sr limestones (average: 1882 ppm; Chiglino et al. 
2010). Given that both ?13C and 87Sr/86Sr fall within the 
range reported for the ASG, a correlation between both units 
seems probable (Chiglino et al. 2010; Bossi et al. 2014).

Sierras Bayas Group (Argentina)
The Sierras Bayas Group (SBG) occurs in the Tandilia 

range in Argentina (Fig. 25). It is an unmetamorphosed, 
flat-lying, marine sedimentary succession representing a cra-
tonic cover (Poiré 1987; Poiré &amp;amp; Gaucher 2009; Cingolani 
2011, and references therein). From base to top the follow-
ing stratigraphic units are recognized (Fig. 27):

Correlations of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated



1. Villa Mónica Formation: stromatolitic dolostones, minor 
phosphorite (Gómez-Peral et al. 2014).

2. Cerro Largo Formation: cross-bedded quartz-arenite 
and subordinated shale, with a distinct diamictite unit 
(Colombo Member) at the base (Poiré &amp;amp; Gaucher 2009).

3. Olavarría Formation: shales, bearing low-diversity acri-
tarchs (Gaucher et al. 2005).

4. Loma Negra Formation: Cloudina-bearing, fine-
grained limestones (Gaucher et  al. 2005; Gaucher 
&amp;amp; Poiré 2009a).

The Cerro Negro Formation (shales, sandstones, marls, and 
minor phosphorite) overlies the SBG with erosional uncon-
formity (Gómez Peral et al. 2014, and references therein).

The Colombo diamictite may represent glacially influ-
enced, rift-related deposits (Poiré &amp;amp; Gaucher 2009; Gaucher 
&amp;amp; Poiré 2009b) which can be correlated to diamictites of the 
Las Ventanas and Playa Hermosa formations in Uruguay. 
Rapalini et al. (2013) obtained similar paleopoles for both 
units, supporting this correlation.

Several chemostratigraphic studies were carried out in 
the SBG and Cerro Negro Formation. The Villa Mónica 
dolostones are characterized by rising ?13C values (-2.2 to 
2.2‰) and 87Sr/86Sr between 0.7069 and 0.7071 (Fig. 27), 
although the primary nature of the latter remains to be proved 
(Gómez Peral et al. 2007, 2014). The age of the Villa Mónica 
Formation can so far be regarded as Neoproterozoic, but 
more analyses are needed to further constrain it.

The Loma Negra Formation is characterized by positive 
?13C ratios, decreasing up-section from 4.5‰ to near zero 
(Gómez Peral et al. 2007; Bagnoud-Velásquez et al. 2013). 
87Sr/86Sr analyses in the same unit yielded ratios between 
0.7069 and 0.7087 (Kawashita et al. 1999). Taken together, 
both C and Sr isotope values match those obtained for the 
lower Polanco Formation of the ASG (Fig. 27).

?13Corg in the Loma Negra Formation varies between 
-23 and -28‰, with corresponding D?13Ccar-org ranging 
between 25 and 32‰ (Gómez Peral et al. 2007; Bagnoud-
Velásquez et al. 2013). This is interpreted as reflecting 
the original fractionation by oxygenic photoautotrophs 
(Bagnoud-Velásquez et al. 2013), which agrees with the 
reported eukaryotic microbiota dominated by Leiosphaeridia 
(Gaucher et al. 2005).

Reported ?34S pyrite values (24 – 32.5 ‰ CDT) in 
the Loma Negra Formation are heavier than ?34SCAS for the 
same unit (24 – 29 ‰, Bagnoud-Velásquez et al. 2013). 
This “superheavy pyrites” have been interpreted for the coeval 
Nama Group (southern Africa) as the result of enhanced 
bacterial sulphate-reduction activity in a low sulphate envi-
ronment, hinting at low atmospheric O2 contents in the lat-
est Ediacaran (Ries et al. 2009).

As for the Cerro Negro Formation, basal phosphorites 
yielded negative ?13C values around -1‰ VPDB, steadily 
increasing in overlying marls to a maximum of 4.3‰. 
This latter positive excursion may match the P3 excursion 
of the upper Polanco Formation (4.1 ‰). As a condensed 
succession deposited in a shallow-water setting, it is not sur-
prising that in the SBG erosional unconformities mark the 
regressions recorded in the deeper-water ASG, most nota-
bly carbonates deposited during N1. Acritarchs of the Cerro 
Negro Formation suggest a late Ediacaran age for the unit 
(Cingolani et al. 1991; Gaucher et al. 2005).

CHEMOSTRATIGRAPHIC 
CORRELATIONS: DISCUSSION AND 

CONCLUSIONS

It is well known that fossils and U-Pb ages are the most 
reliable tools in stratigraphic correlation of sedimentary suc-
cessions. In this way, it is possible that the upper Itapucumí 
Group, Tamengo, upper Sete Lagoas, Loma Negra, and 
Polanco formations are all correlative because they host 
Cloudina and, therefore, could be of late Ediacaran age 
(ca. 560 – 541 Ma). The Frecheirinha Formation hosts an 
impoverished acritarch biota which points also to a late 
Ediacaran age.

Limited knowledge of absolute ages among some of the 
successions discussed in this study represents an obstacle in 
precise their stratigraphic correlation. U-Pb ages from detri-
tal zircons have been used in cases when datable volcanic 
rocks are absent. This has led occassionaly to controversial 
interpretations when ages obtained this way are contrasted 
with those from other methods applied to same stratigraphic 
intervals. For example, Pb-Pb model age for the Sete Lagoas 
Formation (740 ± 22 Ma) regarded as acceptable geochro-
nological data until recently (Babinski et al. 2007) has 
been contested by U-Pb age of detrital zircon (610 Ma) 
from the same stratigraphic interval (Pimentel et al. 2011). 
Furthermore, the presence of Cloudina sp. in the the Sete 
Lagoas Formation suggests a late Ediacaran age, at least for 
exposures in central-eastern Brazil.

In the absence of fossils and/or radiometric age dating, 
elemental and isotope chemostratigraphy (e.g. Sr, C, S, Ca, 
Cr, Mo, N isotopes), in spite of limitations, may represent 
an important tool in stratigraphic correlation. Strontium 
isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) have been used with this purpose 
after its suggested monotone rise from Tonian through 
Cambrian has been proposed (e.g. Halverson et al. 2010). 
One cannot ignore, however, that large 87Sr/86Sr secular 
variations, within one same late Ediacaran succession, has 
been sometimes observed (e.g. from 0.7070 to 0.7087 in

a 900-m-thick, high-Sr limestone section of the Polanco 
Formation, Uruguay) implying a severe limitation on its 
use as a stand-alone proxy. If one compares with the more 
detailed 87Sr/86Sr Phanerozoic record, characterized by strong 
87Sr/86Sr oscillations (Veizer et al., 1999) the proposed mono-
tone 87Sr/86Sr rise in the Neoproterozoic is likely an artifact 
of low sampling resolution.

A tentative correlation of the carbonate-dominated suc-
cessions in this study, based on available 87Sr/86Sr and ?13C 
values, is shown in Table 1. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios for pure car-
bonates of the Jucurutu Formation (0.7074 – 0.7075) are 
equivalent to those found for the early Ediacaran Mirassol 
D’Oeste Formation in the Paraguay Belt, and Maieberg 
Formation, Otavi Group (Namibia). According to detrital 
zircons and intrusions the depositional age of the Jucurutu 
Formation should be between 634 Ma (youngest zircon) 
and 591 Ma (Totoró Granite). The Seridó Fm. is younger 
than 611 ± 7 Ma.

From the 87Sr/86Sr ratios and ?13C compilation shown 
in Table 1, apparently the Cryogenian (circa 720 ? 635 
Ma; Shields-Zhou et  al. 2016) is poorly represented 
among the examined carbonate-dominated successions, 
except for the Jacoca and Acauã formations, and the 
end-Cryogenian Palestina, Jequitaí, Bebedouro, and Puga 
glaciogenic diamictites. There is a possibility that the 
deposition of the Panelinhas and Cabravinha formations 
happened at the end-Cryogenian glaciation, but so far 
there is no radiometric constraint. Despite of the effort 

to precise the depositional age of rocks of the Bambuí 
and Una groups (U–Pb dating, 87Sr/86Sr ratios and ?13C 
and paleontological data), this is still a matter of strong 
debate, far from being settled. It cannot be totally dis-
carded the possibility that the sedimentation of part of 
this group happened in the early-to-middle Cryogenian 
as shown in Table 1.
