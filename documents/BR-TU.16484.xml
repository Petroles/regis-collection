resumo 
 

 

Compreender a biologia das espécies de mar aberto é dificultado pela 
amostragem em ambiente de mar profundo. Além disso, condicionado pela 
vasta extensão do oceano aberto, o conhecimento da fase inicial de vida das 
larvas pelágicas é ainda relativamente limitado. Em espécies de decápodes 
bento-pelágicos, a transição da vida no fundo do mar para a coluna de água 
não só está associada a uma metamorfose drástica na morfologia, mas 
também a uma mudança de comportamento e de ecologia alimentar. O 
presente trabalho teve como objectivo principal investigar as adaptações 
fisiológicas, bioquímicas e comportamentais que ocorrem durante o 
desenvolvimento inicial em espécies de decápodes bento-pelágicos. Como 
organismos modelos foram usados o lagostim, Nephrops norvegicus, e o 
caranguejo Monodaeus couchi, pelo facto de ambas as espécies poderem ser 
capturadas ao largo da plataforma do NE Atlântico e a mais de 300 m de 
profundidade.  

O Capítulo 1 apresenta os desafios enfrentados pelos adultos e larvas de 
decápodes que vivem nestes ambientes remotos, incluindo o efeito da 
disponibilidade de alimento no desenvolvimento, e dos processos 
oceanográficos na dispersão e recrutamento. Em particular, este trabalho 
pretende seguir a história de vida inicial, a começar com a variabilidade na 
composição dos ácidos gordos (AG) de embriões da mesma ninhada de N. 
norvegicus em desenvolvimento. Na maioria das fêmeas, não foram 
encontradas diferenças na composição dos AG de embriões alojados em 
ambos os lados da câmara de desenvolvimento embrionária. No entanto, todas 
as fêmeas apresentaram diferenças significativas nos perfis de AG de 
embriões situados em diferentes pleópodes. Possíveis causas para as 
variações registadas podem ser devidas ao investimento diferencial da fêmea 
durante a produção de ovócitos ou a mudanças no catabolismo dos AG 
durante o período de incubação promovido pela localização do embrião dentro 
da câmara de desenvolvimento embrionária. Em seguida foram investigadas 
em N. norvegicus as taxas de alimentação e a actividade de enzimas 
digestivas dos primeiros dois estádios larvares. Ambos os estádios foram 
capazes de maximizar a ingestão de alimento em situação de escassez de 
presas, e mostraram um aumento na taxa de alimentação depois de períodos 
de inanição. A actividade da amilase indicou que os hidratos de carbono não 
são a principal reserva de energia e que a alimentação pode ser obrigatória 

logo após a eclosão para iniciar a actividade da amilase. A actividade da 
protease indicou que as reservas de proteínas são metabolizadas em inanição. 
Estes resultados indicam que na presença de maiores concentrações de 
plâncton as larvas podem maximizar a ingestão de presas e minimizar os 
efeitos prejudiciais provocados por intermitentes períodos prévios de fome, 
baixa densidade de presas, ou presas impróprias. Além disso, a mudança na 
actividade enzimática pode permitir às larvas recém-nascidas de N. norvegicus 
metabolizar as reservas de proteínas para sobreviver a curtos períodos de 
inanição. 

De seguida foi estudado a influência das propriedades oceanográficas sobre a 
migração vertical das larvas. Em M. couchi, todos os estádios larvares 
apresentaram migração vertical nocturna inversa. A abundância dos dois 
primeiros estádios mostrou estar positivamente correlacionada com os níveis 
de clorofila a. A ocorrência de mudança ontogénica na distribuição vertical 
explicou os resultados; os primeiros estádios de zoeae permanecem na parte 
superior da coluna de água, uma zona rica em alimentos, ao contrário dos 
estádios posteriores que migraram para o fundo de forma a assentarem. O 
comportamento migratório vertical é susceptível de afectar a distribuição 
horizontal das larvas. Os padrões globais de circulação irão causar pequenas 
variações inter-anuais no recrutamento de larvas de decápodes, mas 
pequenas variações espacio-temporais, como eventos de afloramento, irão 
provocar alterações no padrão geral de dispersão.

resumo (cont.) 
 

 

Ao longo do desenvolvimento, desde o embrião até a metamorfose para juvenil 
bentónico, os decápodes de mar aberto enfrentam muitos desafios. A 
sobrevivência do indivíduo em desenvolvimento depende significativamente da 
disponibilidade de alimento assim como das reservas fornecidas pela mãe. 
Apesar do comportamento de migração vertical permitir às larvas aproveitarem 
as variações de corrente para transporte, a influência dos padrões de 
circulação geral irá sobrepor-se às correntes locais e influenciar as condições 
de alimentação, a dispersão e o recrutamento.

abstract 

 
Understanding the biology of offshore species is hardened by the difficulties of 
sampling in the deep-sea environment. Additionally, due to the vastness of the 
open ocean, knowledge of early life histories of pelagic larvae is still relatively 
scarce. In decapod species with bentho-pelagic lifestyle, the transition from life 
in the seafloor to the water column not only is associated with drastic 
morphological metamorphosis, but also with changes in behavior and feeding 
ecology. The purpose of the present thesis was to investigate physiological, 
biochemical and behavioral adaptation occurring during early development of 
such species. The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and the crab 
Monodaeus couchi were used as a model as these two species are 
encountered off the NE Atlantic shelf at depth greater than 300 m.  

Chapter 1 introduces the challenges faced by both adult and larvae inhabiting 
such remote habitats, including the effect of food availability on development 
and oceanographic processes on dispersal and recruitment. The thesis follows 
early life histories, starting with within-brood variability in the fatty acid (FA) 
profile displayed by developing N. norvegicus embryos. There were no 
differences in the FA composition of embryos sampled from both sides of the 
brooding chamber in most females. However, all females exhibited significant 
differences in the FA profiles of embryos sampled from different pleopods. 
Potential causes for the variations recorded may be differential female 
investment during oocyte production or shifts in FA catabolism during the 
incubation period promoted by embryo’s location within the brooding chamber. 
Next, feeding rates and digestive enzymes activity of the early stage larvae was 
investigated in N. norvegicus. Both stages were able to maximize food intake 
when larvae were scarce and showed increased feeding rate following periods 
of starvation. Amylase activity indicated that carbohydrates are not the primary 
energy reserve and that feeding may be required soon after hatching to trigger 
amylase activity. Protease activity indicated that protein reserves are 
catabolized under starvation. These results indicate that larvae may maximize 
prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher food abundance 
and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of intermittent 
starvation or unsuitable prey densities/types.  

Additionally, changes in enzymatic activity may allow newly hatched N. 
norvegicus larvae to metabolize protein reserves to overcome short-term 
starvation. Vertical migration behavior and the influence of oceanographic 
properties were studied next. All zoeal stages of M. couchi displayed reverse 
diel vertical migration. Abundance of early stages was correlated with 
chlorophyll a levels. An ontogenic shift in vertical distribution explained the 
results; earlier zoeal stages remain in the food-rich upper water column while 
later stages migrate to the bottom for settlement. This vertical migration 
behavior is likely to affect horizontal distribution of larvae. Indeed, global 
current patterns will result in low inter-annual variations in decapod larvae 
recruitment, but short term variations such as upwelling events will cause 
deviation from the expected dispersal pattern.  

Throughout development, from the embryo to metamorphosis into benthic 
juvenile, offshore decapods face many challenges. For the developing 
individual survivorship will depend heavily on food availability but also on the 
reserves passed on by the mother. Even though vertical migration behavior can 
allow the larvae to take advantage of depth varying currents for transport, the 
effect of general circulation pattern will superimpose local current and influence 
feeding conditions and affect dispersal and recruitment.

Embryonic and larval stages are important phases of decapod crustaceans life cycle. It 

is widely accepted that pre-settlement processes have an important impact on 

metamorphosis and survival of post-larvae and juveniles (Giménez 2010). Until 

recently, most studies focused separately either larval or post settlement processes. 

However, as stressed by Pechenik (2006), metamorphosis should not be considered as 

a new beginning. A carry-over effect from earlier larval history will affect post-

settlement performance of newly settled juvenile (Giménez 2006). Similarly, the 

quality of maternal investment into the embryo or variations in environmental 

conditions during embryonic development will ultimately affect larval development 

and survival (Giménez and Anger 2003). Many studies have documented the existence 

of inter-population differences in embryonic and larval development (e.g.: Bas et al. 

2007; Kunisch and Anger 1984; Ouellet and Plante 2004; Rotllant et al. 2004). For 

instance, in species with a wide distribution, geographic differences in environmental 

conditions strongly influences early life history processes (Brante et al. 2003; Rotllant 

et al. 2004).  Similarly, species displaying extended reproductive seasons and/or 

occupying habitats exposed to strong environmental gradients may experience 

variations in food availability, temperature and/or salinity, which may result in intra- 

and inter-population variability in the energetic content of embryos and newly hatched 

larvae (e.g.: Brante et al. 2003; Giménez and Anger 2003; Kunisch and Anger 1984; 

Tuck et al. 2000; Verísimo et al. 2011). On smaller spatial scales, local environmental 

conditions might not be identical for all developing siblings and as a result, within-

brood variability will be observed. In this sense, an increased within-clutch variability 

can reduce the variation in reproductive success among generations, by ensuring that 

at least some offspring are likely to have the suitable phenotype for the local 

environment (Crean and Marshall 2009).  

The extent to which latent effects of embryonic and/or larval development regulate 

the populations of coastal invertebrates is still largely unknown (Pechenik 2006). 

Nevertheless, as stated above, within-brood variability resulting from differential 

maternal investment into embryonic reserves or larval experience will affect larval 

processes and/or metamorphosis. Because of the critical role played by the larval 

phase in dispersal, factors affecting larval traits will impact recruitment and therefore

affect population dynamics (Giménez 2006, 2010). The purpose of this thesis was to 

investigate early life history processes of offshore benthic decapods: 1) document 

inter-individual and within-brood variability in embryonic reserves, 2) investigate early 

larval behavioral and physiological responses to changes in food quality and quantities, 

and 3) describe larval migratory behaviors and dispersal. Two species were used in this 

thesis to serve as models for offshore benthic Pleocyemata decapods, the Norway 

lobster Nephrops norvegicus and the xanthid crab Monodaeus couchi. 

In this chapter it will be identified where, in the life cycle of benthic decapod, 

differences in environmental conditions might result in within-brood variability in early 

life development and survival. A summary of current knowledge about the 

reproductive and early life history of offshore benthic decapod species is given. 

Challenges faced by females will be briefly overviewed, focusing on phases playing a 

crucial role in the reproduction process, mainly ovogenesis. Essential factors for 

successful larval development to juvenile, such as embryonic reserves, environmental 

conditions and food quality and quantity, as well as, recruitment and settlement 

processes, will also be assessed. Finally, the biology and ecology of the two model 

species will be briefly reviewed. 

 

1.1 Ovarian and embryonic development in benthic offshore 

Pleocyemata decapods  

Due to the difficulties existing in sampling the benthic offshore environment, the 

current knowledge on the biology of species from this habitat is far from complete. 

Except for chemoautotrophic processes taking place at hydrothermal vents and cold 

seeps (Gage and Tyler 1991), owing to the lack of sunlight on the sea floor of the open 

ocean and, therefore photosynthesis, food is provided to the benthic community 

through sedimentation from upper layers. As a result, the availability of food resources 

for the deep benthos largely depends on the flux of particulate organic carbon from 

the epipelagic zone, although there are time lags involved (Company et al. 2003; 

Fanelli and Cartes 2004; Johnson et al. 2007). Consequently, the majority of the 

offshore benthic species are deposit feeders, or complete their predator diet through 



Chapter 1 

11 

scavenging. Chitinous exoskeleton shed by planktonic organisms represent a reliable, 

constant food sources (Johnson et al. 2007), while carcasses of larger organism such as 

squids or whales constitute a large but sporadic supply of lipids and proteins (Kemp et 

al. 2006).  Nevertheless, on the way down, sinking particles, mostly originating from 

plant or animal (e.g.: feces, dead individual, molt, etc…), are grazed upon by pelagic 

scavengers and therefore lose much of their nutritive qualities before reaching the 

benthos, a loss that increases proportionally with increasing depth (Gage and Tyler 

1991). Food is therefore the most limiting factor for secondary production in this 

environment (Stockton and DeLaca 1982).  

Many adult decapods have a benthic existence. Those that live further offshore will 

therefore live deeper and face many challenges related to the deep sea environment. 

As discussed above, food is the most limiting factor for organisms inhabiting offshore 

benthic habitats (Gage and Tyler 1991; Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). Unlike 

decapod species from shallow waters, offshore species cannot rely solely on predation 

for survival and most are expected to display primarily a scavenging lifestyle (Fanelli 

and Cartes 2004). Nevertheless, dietary habits are fairly unknown due to the 

difficulties of sampling, either through direct observations or stomach content 

analysis, as the gastric mill of decapod generally grinds preys beyond identification 

(Gage and Tyler 1991). Additionally, food availability is bound to influence the biology 

of offshore benthic species, especially during the critical periods of their life history 

(e.g. molt, gamete production, egg incubation…). Indeed, the synchrony between the 

reproductive cycle and seasonal phytoplankton blooms in surface waters has already 

been documented in deep-sea decapods (Copley and Young 2006; Hilario et al. 2009; 

Perovich et al. 2003). Additionally, shifts in food resources influencing growth have 

been shown to affect ovarian composition as well (Tuck et al. 1997b).  

Plasticity in maternal investment is often illustrated by the variability observed in inter-

individual and/or within-brood egg size (e.g.: Bas et al. 2007; Briones-Fourzan et al. 

2009), which, despite some small limitations, can ultimately be used to assess 

embryonic energetic input by the female (Moran and McAlister 2009). In the 

Pleocyemata, egg production is as follows: vitellogenesis is divided into two phases; 

first yolk is deposited slowly into the oocytes which gradually increase in size; second, 



Introduction 

12 

large amount of yolk is deposited in the oocytes over a short period of time. The 

quality of nutrients deposited into the developing oocyte during this second phase is 

more likely to be affected by the feeding status of the female. Besides the ovaries, 

nutrients used during vitellogenesis in decapod can originate from various sources, 

including the hepatopancreas, hemocytes and subepidermal adipose tissue (Talbot and 

Helluy 1995). After ovulation, the mature oocytes are spawned and fertilized either 

internally or externally depending on the species. After fertilization, embryos become 

attached to the ovigerous setae of female’s pleopods until their development is 

complete and hatching occurs. During that period, the female cares for the embryos by 

fanning the pleopods, bringing water and thus fresh oxygen to the egg mass. Parasites, 

as well as unhealthy and dead eggs, are also periodically removed through grooming.  

In marine invertebrates, maternal investment is a major factor in shaping population 

structure and dynamics (Hammerschmidt et al. 2011; Marshall and Keough 2008). 

Because embryonic development in decapods is completely lecithotrophic (Anger 

2001), the quality and quantity of embryonic reserves provided by females are critical 

and impact development, hatching and early larval survival (Giménez 2006). The 

resources available to the embryo are those that have been provided by the female, 

which are influenced by the maternal diet prior to ovogenesis (Racotta et al. 2003). As 

a result,  gonadal maturation in decapods has large associated energy costs (Rosa and 

Nunes 2002). By understanding the biochemical shifts occurring during embryonic 

development, it is possible to identify the nutritional requirements exhibited by 

developing embryos. Additionally, changes in nutrient allocation may help understand 

how within-brood variability will ultimately affect larval survival. Proteins are known to 

be the main components of marine invertebrate eggs (Holland 1978). However, lipids 

play a central role in the embryonic metabolism, since they represent the most 

important energy source and form at least 60% of the total energy expenditure of 

developing crustacean embryos (Wehrtmann and Graeve 1998). Nevertheless, for 

planktotrophic larvae in the open ocean, food may not be available right after hatching 

and, when facing starvation, the only energetic reserves allowing survival are of 

embryonic origin (Anger 2001; Rotllant et al. 2001). In this sense, the quantity and 



Chapter 1 

13 

quality of nutrients remaining from embryonic development will highly influence larval 

development and survival, and ultimately affect population dynamics.  

Alternatively, differences in environmental conditions within the brooding chamber 

may promote a shift in nutrient consumption during the incubation period. Variable 

oxygen concentration within the dense embryo mass has already been described for 

brachyuran crabs (Fernandez et al. 2003). Embryonic metabolic rates commonly 

increase in reduced oxygen environment and yolk reserves provided by the female are 

depleted at a faster rate (Brante et al. 2003). This scenario will cause a differential 

catabolism of embryonic reserves and eventually lead to asynchronous larval hatching 

(Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). Indeed, decapods have been recorded to 

hatch their larvae over several consecutive nights (Pandian 1970). These episodes were 

often considered as a “laboratorial artifact”. Nevertheless, regardless of the proximate 

cause, within-brood variation in embryonic nutrients may result in asynchronous 

embryonic development, and may ultimately result in asynchronous hatching of larvae 

with variable nutritional reserves (Wickins et al. 1995). This variability at birth will, in 

turn, affect larval success in recruitment to suitable juvenile habitat.  

1.2 Life history processes of Pleocyemata decapod larvae in offshore 

environments 

Due to its harsh environmental conditions and patchy food distribution, the open 

ocean habitat is not optimal for larval development (Giménez and Anger 2005). In 

offshore benthic decapods, the depth where larval hatching takes place may also play 

a role in food availability. In larvae hatching below the photic zone, prey items may not 

be sufficient to fulfill the nutritional needs of the first larvae stage. In fact, it is possible 

that suitable prey may only be available once these larvae reach the upper regions of 

the water column (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). After hatching, decapod larvae are 

known to migrate vertically to the photic zone (Queiroga and Blanton 2005). This 

aspect of decapod’s early life cycle may translate into a potential period of suboptimal 

feeding, or even post-hatching starvation. Following the first vertical migration, natural 

patchiness of the pelagic environment will result in variable food conditions (Andersen 

and Nielsen 2002; Folt and Burns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995) and feeding larvae have 



Introduction 

14 

evolved mechanisms allowing them to cope with those trophic mismatches which will 

be discussed below.  

After a period of lecithotrophic embryonic development, the eggs of decapods will 

hatch into free-swimming larvae. Species of deep sea habitats tend to invest more 

energy into each individual embryo, and therefore tend to produce a smaller number 

of larger eggs (Anger 2001; Gage and Tyler 1991). The number of molts necessary to 

reach post larval stage greatly varies intra-specifically but again the number of larval 

stage and larval duration have the tendency to decrease with increasing depth of adult 

habitat (Anger 2001). Additionally, the dependence on food will also decrease with 

depth. These strategies will translate into reduced mortality and increased recruitment 

and settlement success (Gage and Tyler 1991). 

 

1.2.1 Feeding 

Regardless of larval geographical range or hatching period, it is widely accepted that 

planktonic larvae are naturally subjected to intermittent periods of starvation and/or 

suboptimal prey availability due to the natural patchiness of plankton distribution in 

the oceanic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; Folt and Burns 1999; Pinel-

Alloul 1995). Studies have highlighted how, in decapods, early larval feeding greatly 

affects their development, since these organisms may not recover from extended 

period of nutritional stress even after feeding resumes (e.g.: Anger et al. 1985; Calado 

et al. 2010; Giménez and Anger 2005; Pechenik 2006; Rotllant et al. 2001). The larvae 

of species hatching  in regions of low food availability have developed morphological 

(Fenaux et al. 1994; Strathmann et al. 1993) or behavioral (McConaugha 2002) 

adaptations to enhance their overall feeding efficiency. Planktotrophic larvae of many 

benthic species appear to have evolved a certain feeding plasticity, in order to be able 

to feed over a broad range of prey sizes, types and abundances (Hinz et al. 2001; 

McConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin 2005; Strathmann and Bone 1997). By feeding on 

smaller and/or suboptimal food items, developing larvae may minimize the negative 

effects of low food density and avoid starvation. In fact, this feeding plasticity had 

already been previously documented in decapods, such as homarid lobsters and 



Chapter 1 

15 

brachyuran crabs that were recorded to successfully perform suspension feeding (in 

contrast with the most commonly recorded raptorial feeding behavior) when 

subjected to suboptimal food conditions(Barshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; McConaugha 

2002).  

 

1.2.1.1 Larval nutrition and digestion 

A prey item captured by a feeding decapod larva will be first masticated by the 

mandibles. While food is processed through the esophagus and cardiac stomach some 

mechanical digestion takes place. Upon reaching the gastric mill food is broken down 

further through mechanical grinding and internal mastication. In the pyloric stomach, 

the gastric juices will then be filtered and transferred to the hepatopancreas, where 

intracellular digestion will be catabolized by digestive enzymes. Fecal pellets will finally 

be expelled through the anus (Anger 2001). During this process, nutrients important 

for larval survival and development are assimilated and transformed.  

In decapods, essential nutrients include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Lipids are 

probably the most important energy source (Anger 2001) and are catabolized when 

larvae are deprived of food (Ritar et al. 2003a). During starvation, proteins, along with 

lipids, play an important role as energy sources to the developing larva (Anger 2001; 

Johnston et al. 2004). Despite the fact that marine decapods are not able to efficiently 

store carbohydrates reserves and that lipids and proteins may be more relevant to fuel 

larval energetics, carbohydrates are expected to be important, even though its role is 

not yet fully understood (Sánchez-Paz et al. 2006).  

Despite ample evidences that larvae of most species of decapods are omnivorous (e.g.: 

Barshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; Hinz et al. 2001; McConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin 

2005), larvae are not necessarily adapted to digest the various nutrients ingested with 

the same efficiency. The effectiveness of food assimilation primarily depends on two 

factors: 1) gut evacuation time (GET, the interval between first consumption of an item 

and its first appearance in fecal material) and 2) activity of digestive enzymes. In many 

species there is a negative relationship between the two factors, enzymatic activity 



Introduction 

16 

increasing with decreasing GET. Indeed, increased residence time of food within the 

gut implies higher assimilation efficiency  and as a result high enzymatic activity is not 

necessary (Kurmaly et al. 1990).  

During digestion, the activation of specific enzymes, primarily synthesized in the 

hepatopancreas, will result in the degradation of different dietary macromolecules. 

The analysis of their dynamics during periods of starvation (or suboptimal feeding) may 

be an excellent indicator of which nutrients act as energy reserves and which are 

preferentially catabolized under these scenarios (Johnston 2003; Johnston et al. 2004; 

Jones et al. 1997; Kamarudin et al. 1994; Lovett and Felder 1990a; Rotllant et al. 2010). 

For instance, high protease activity is indicative of protein catabolism, while amylase 

activity indicates the consumption of carbohydrates (Johnston 2003; Kamarudin et al. 

1994). Additionally, it has been suggested that amylase may play other role than just 

catabolizing carbohydrates, even though its role has not yet been fully understood 

(Jones et al. 1997). Studying amylase activity in omnivorous species may help 

understand why this enzyme is active in spite of the scarcity of its substrate.  

 

1.2.1.2 Feeding strategies 

Most decapod larvae require food to successfully develop and are thus classified as 

planktotrophic. On the other end of the continuum, there are species which larvae can 

accomplish their complete (or partial) larval development, without feeding. These 

lecithotrophic larvae rely entirely on internal nutritional reserves that have been 

provided from the female to the embryo. This mode of development is often 

associated with environments where food availability is highly unpredictable, such as 

the deep sea (e.g.: Pond et al. 1997). However, even in areas that commonly display 

high food production, larvae can be subjected to variable periods of food limitation 

due to the natural patchiness of the pelagic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; 

Folt and Burns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995; Strathmann 1985).  

Larval dependence on food may vary intra-specifically depending on developmental 

stage. The ability of newly hatched larvae to successfully molt through one or more 



Chapter 1 

17 

larval stages without feeding is called primary lecithotrophy. The amount of time a 

larva will be able to survive starvation and still be capable of normal development once 

suitable food conditions are encountered will depend upon the energetic reserves 

provided by the female into the embryos. During the planktonic larval phase, some 

species will be able to start feeding when food becomes available (facultative 

lecithotrophy) while others are unable to ingest food even if preys are encountered 

(obligate lecithotrophy) (Anger 2001).  

As in many species the yolk reserves are highly depleted at hatching, newly hatched 

larvae of many species are not able to successfully reach the second larval stage 

relying solely on the nutrients provided by the female. These larvae will therefore be 

dependent on exogenous food, whose quality and quantity will influence larval 

development. However, energetic reserves stored from exogenous feeding may allow 

later stages to develop without food through metamorphosis (e.g.: Abrunhosa et al. 

2008; Anger and Schubart 2005; Thessalou-Legaki et al. 1999). This case of endotrophic 

development is called secondary lecithotrophy and can be explained in post-larval 

stage as an adaptation to food limitation as the individual is searching for a suitable 

habitat to metamorphose and settle as a benthic juvenile (Calado et al. 2007b; Calado 

et al. 2010).  

These different feeding strategies have evolved in response to different food quantity 

and quality available to both adults and larvae in the various habitats occupied by 

decapods, and maximize larval survival and development. However, regardless of the 

strategy, unpredictable food shortage may occur at any point of the life cycle and 

different mechanisms exist to allow the planktotrophic larvae to cope with periods of 

starvation. These responses include changes in feeding rate and reduced prey 

selectivity as the larvae become increasingly opportunistic under reduced food 

conditions (Barshaw and Bryant-Rich 1988; McConaugha 2002). In addition, gut 

evacuation time and/or enzymes activity can increase under such unfavorable 

conditions to optimize the assimilation of the limited amounts of nutrients ingested 

when the larvae encounters areas of unsuitable prey quantity and quality (Lovett and 

Felder 1990a). 



Introduction

1.2.2 Migrations 

Vertical migration is a behavior commonly observed in marine organisms which can 

enhance feeding, predator avoidance or transport. Since most decapod larvae have 

limited swimming abilities, vertical swimming generally represents the only form of 

actively influencing horizontal dispersal (Sulkin 1984). Vertical position of offshore 

decapod larvae is known to vary according to the phase of the day, as well as to 

ontogenic development. However, regardless of the type, vertical migration ultimately 

affects horizontal transport by subjecting larvae to depth varying current intensities 

and directions (dos Santos et al. 2008; Queiroga and Blanton 2005). 

 

1.2.2.1 Diel vertical migrations 

The most commonly known and described pattern of zooplanktonic migration takes 

place on a daily cycle. Diel vertical migration (DVM) behavior displayed by decapod 

larvae conform to the three main patterns described for general zooplanktonic forms 

(Forward 1988). In nocturnal migration, which is the most common form, larvae rise to 

surface water during the night to feed and sink below the photic zone during the day, 

probably to reduce predation pressure (Forward 1988; Pearre 2003). In the second 

form, known as reverse diel vertical migration, larvae rise to the surface during the day 

and sink to deeper water at night (Forward 1988). Finally, in twilight migration, larvae 

reach minimum depths near sunset, descend to intermediate depths during the night 

and rise again to surface near sunrise before sinking to remain in deeper water during 

the day (Forward 1988). Nevertheless, even within the same species, DVM behavior is 

not always the same and might vary with area (e.g. distance from coast) or 

environmental conditions such as fluctuations in predator or prey abundances or 

vertical stratification (Han and Straskraba 2001). Reverse DVM has been suggested as a 

defense against predator undergoing nocturnal vertical migration. As observed in 

various copepod species, when predators exhibit nocturnal DVM their prey may 

undergo reverse DVM (Irigoien et al. 2004; Osgood and Frost 1994). This behavior has 

been associated to areas where the predators present rely more on tactile stimuli than 

sight, like it is the case for many invertebrate predators (e.g.: chaetognaths and 



Chapter 1 

19 

gelatinous zooplankton) which themselves are undergoing nocturnal DVM as a way to 

escape fish predators (Tester et al. 2004). Additionally, reverse DVM has also been 

observed in areas with lower abundances of predatory fish (Lagergren et al. 2008). 

Since shifts in predator populations occur, the prey must be able to adjust their 

behavior accordingly, and larvae of some species might be able to exhibit plasticity in 

their DVM behavior with changing environmental conditions.  

Knowledge of DVM behavior of larvae of species that accomplish their entire lifecycle 

offshore is limited to a few species. Nocturnal diel vertical migration has been 

observed in Cancer spp. and Randalia ornata zoeae, but megalopae did not display 

clear vertical migration, suggesting that these species undergo an ontogenetic shift in 

vertical migration behavior off the coast of California (Shanks 1986). 

 

1.2.2.2 Ontogenic migration 

On a longer time scale, vertical position in the water column will vary with 

development stage. Newly hatched larvae feeing in surface waters will be encountered 

at lower depth than the megalopae searching for suitable settlement site near benthic 

adult habitats (Queiroga and Blanton 2005; Queiroga et al. 2007). This shift results in 

changing behavioral responses during ontogenetic development (Queiroga and 

Blanton 2005; Queiroga et al. 2007). This behavior has been observed in many 

decapods accomplishing their entire life cycle offshore, including prawns, such as 

Aristeus antennatus (Carbonell et al. 2010), and brachyuran crabs such as Geryon 

quinquedens (Kelly et al. 1982). In early stages the combination of high barokinesis and 

negative geotaxis acts to position the larvae in a food-rich environment close to the 

surface, hence favoring growth (Sulkin 1984). In contrast, the megalopa is the stage 

that needs to encounter a suitable environment for settlement and subsequent 

metamorphosis. Therefore, it will move towards the bottom, which is usually achieved 

by positive geotaxis. In general terms, the response of larvae to a number of 

environmental factors involved in depth regulation, such as light, gravity or pressure, 

changes through ontogeny, resulting in deeper distributions in later stages (Sulkin 

1984). Additionally, changes in morphological and biochemical adaptations of larvae 



Introduction 

20 

throughout ontogeny also affect their buoyancy, further influencing their vertical 

distribution (Sulkin 1984). 

 

1.2.3 Dispersal and recruitment 

While DVM behavior can be related to predator-avoidance mechanisms (Han and 

Straskraba 2001), it ultimately affects horizontal transport by subjecting larvae to 

variable current intensities and directions (dos Santos et al. 2008; Queiroga and 

Blanton 2005). It is less clear, however, how vertical migrations in the open ocean 

result in retention in, or transport to, areas more favorable for successful development 

and settlement.  

It is however widely documented that biotic and abiotic cues influence larval position 

in the water column. Examples of such factors include: physical properties of the water 

(i.e. temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic pressure), light levels, predator and prey 

concentration, state of feeding, and endogenous rhythms (Epifanio and Garvine 2001; 

Folt and Burns 1999; Forward 1988). Larvae not only respond to exogenous cues to be 

transported to suitable settling habitat, but also need to be retained in water masses 

with tolerable conditions for development (Hobbs et al. 1992). For instance, there is a 

negative relationship between temperature and larval development time (O'Connor et 

al. 2007), which will affect mortality because an extended larval development period at 

low temperatures translates into a larger time period of exposure to mortality factors 

such as predation (Morgan 1995). Additionally, extreme conditions of temperature will 

increase mortality (Anger 1987) and many decapod species show enhanced 

development under typical oceanic salinity (approximately 35) (Anger et al. 2000; 

Anger et al. 1998; Baylon and Suzuki 2007). Decapod larvae therefore detect and 

respond to changes in those physical parameters so that they are retained in a specific 

water mass favorable to development and thus greatly affecting transport, survival and 

settlement (Forward and Tankersley 2001; Shanks 1986).

1.3 Model Species 

Both Nephrops norvegicus and Monodaeus couchi may provide a good model for the 

understanding of larval ecology of deep-sea decapod crustaceans. The observations of 

the larvae of these species may help expand our understanding on the general factors 

that control the spatial and temporal distribution of offshore benthic decapod 

crustacean larvae in general.  

 

1.3.1 Nephrops norvegicus 

The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially 

important benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in Northeastern Atlantic 

waters, from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco, and in the Mediterranean Sea 

(d’Udekem d’Acoz 1999). The adult depth range varies from 15 to 800 m, although 

they are typically found on the NE Atlantic shelf between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck 

et al. 1997a) and 200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sardà 1997). Off 

the coast of Portugal, the adults are thus encountered at a depth (between 400 to 

800 m) where food availability is reduced. Since lipid requirements of developing ovary 

seem to be more dependent on the recent ingestion of dietary lipids than on 

hepatopancreas reserves (Rosa and Nunes 2002), the state of feeding during 

ovogenesis will play an important role in energy allocation into the oocytes. Indeed, 

variations in nutrient content of the ovaries has been observed to vary between 

populations (Tuck et al. 1997b). Rosa el al. (2003) also extensively described fatty acid 

consumption through embryonic development. Lipid catabolism plays a crucial role 

during development, and up to 70% of the initial total lipid content can be depleted 

before hatching (Rosa et al. 2005; Rosa et al. 2003). In this way, it is possible that 

female’s feeding status shortly at vitellogenesis may play a decisive role in hatching 

success and larval quality.  

The reproduction period of this species varies with location, as average embryo 

incubation period lasts up to 10 months in the Northeastern Atlantic and only 6 

months in the Mediterranean Sea (Sardà 1995). These latitudinal differences affect the 



Introduction 

22 

timing of larval hatching in N. norvegicus , with larval release occurring by early spring 

in the Northeastern Atlantic and at the end of winter in the Mediterranean (Rotllant et 

al. 2004). During such an extended period of incubation, variation in environmental 

conditions can greatly affect embryonic metabolism and therefore the use of yolk 

reserves. Potential deleterious effects resulting from suboptimal environmental 

conditions are commonly reduced through adaptations in the brooding behavior of 

ovigerous females (Eriksson et al. 2006).  However, despite maternal care, differences 

in nutritional state have already been recorded in newly hatched N. norvegicus larvae. 

In the Mediterranean, larvae are larger in size and richer in lipids and proteins than 

those from the Irish sea, which emphasizes the major role that these features may play 

for larval survival in oligotrophic environments (Rotllant et al. 2004). 

Among the early works on N. norvegicus, many were made with females from 

Portuguese waters such as the studies by Figueiredo who described population 

structure of this species off the coast of Portugal (Figueiredo and Thomas 1967) and 

provided a general microscopical description of the ovaries (Figueiredo 1972) and 

established a color based scale to visualize ovarian development (Figueiredo and 

Barraca 1963). Figueiredo and Nunes (1965) also estimated that egg loss during 

incubation off the coast of Portugal was of about 75% regardless of the size of the 

female. Additionally, in the first steps on culturing Norway lobster larvae in the 

laboratory, Figueiredo and Vilela (1972) who found that the best temperature level for 

incubation and survival were between 11 and 14ºC.   

Off the Coast of Portugal, adult Norway lobsters occur at depths ranging from 400 to 

800 m and larval hatching period is known to take place from December to April (dos 

Santos and Peliz 2005). After incubation on the female abdomen, larvae hatch as 

planktonic larvae, develop through 3 larval stages and then migrate back near the 

bottom during the decapodite stage before settling on the benthos as a juvenile (Sardà 

1995). Dos Santos and Peliz (2005) established that newly hatched larvae escape 

oligotrophic environment in the aphotic zone by undergoing a migration towards the 

food rich photic zone near surface to forage for suitable prey.

1.3.2 Monodaeus couchi 

Monodaeus couchi is a xanthid crab that inhabits muddy substrates (Ingle 1983b) from 

England to Angola and in the Mediterranean over a bathymetric range extending from 

60 to 1300 m (Gonzalez-Gurriarán and Méndez G. 1985; Zariquiey Alvarez 1968). It is 

commonly associated with mud volcanoes, carbonate chimneys and cold seeps in the 

Gulf of Cadiz region (Cunha, M. R., University of Aveiro, unpublished observations). In 

slope habitats of Southern Iberian Peninsula and of the Mediterranean Sea the species 

co-occurs with the commercially important Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus 

(Gonzalez-Gurriarán and Méndez G. 1985; Maynou and Sardà 1997; Mori et al. 1995; 

Tuck et al. 1997a). After hatching the larvae undergoes 4 zoeal stage and one 

megalopal stage (Ingle 1983a). So far, the biology of this species has not been studied.  

 

1.4 General objectives and thesis outline 

In order to better understand the early life biology of offshore species with a 

benthopelagic lifecycle in offshore habitats, a series of studies were performed using 

decapod species as a model. Individual variability of maternal input into embryos, early 

larval behavior, feeding and digestion, as well as general decapod larval distribution of 

the Southwestern coast of Portugal, were investigated. More specifically, the 

objectives of this thesis were to: 

? Investigate inter-individual variability and document the existence of within-

brood variation in the fatty acid profiles of Nephrops norvegicus embryos,  

? Clarify the behavioral and digestive enzyme response of early-stage Nephrops 

norvegicus larvae under various feeding scenarios, 

? Describe both diel and ontogenic vertical migration behavior of Monodaeus 

couchi throughout larval development, 

? Obtain data on the composition, abundance and distribution of decapod 

crustacean larvae off the south Portuguese coast during winter.

The following provides the content of each chapter. Each one, except the introduction 

and concluding remarks, represents different units with specific and well defined 

objectives, organized in individual sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion 

and References). 

The quality and quantity of maternal nutrient investment to the embryos will highly 

affect larval success. In Chapter 2, the existence of within-brood variability in the 

embryonic fatty acid (FA) profile was investigated across the brooding chamber to 

determine if attachment site affected FA profiles of developing N. norvegicus embryos. 

In general, FA composition of embryos sampled from both sides of the brooding 

chamber did not differ according to that factor. In contrast, all females exhibited 

significant differences in the FA profiles of embryos sampled from different pleopods. 

Overall, saturated FA (SFA) profiles were more variable across the brooding chamber 

than highly unsaturated FA (HUFA). Potential causes for intra-individual variations 

recorded in FA profile may be differential female investment during oocyte production 

and/or shifts in FA catabolism during the incubation period promoted by embryo’s 

location within the brooding chamber.

After hatching, and independently from maternal investment, planktotrophic larvae 

might face intermittent periods of starvation due to the natural patchiness of the 

ocean. Chapter 3 investigated the feeding response of the first two zoeal stages of N. 

norvegicus under variable prey densities, prey types, feeding histories and 

photoperiods. Both zoeae (Z) I and II increased the number of consumed prey with 

increasing food levels. Both stages displayed preference in prey size, as ZI preferred 

smaller preys and ZII displayed higher ingestion rates of larger preys at higher food 

concentrations. Feeding history also affected prey ingestion which indicated that 

larvae may maximize prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher

food abundance and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of 

intermittent starvation or unsuitable prey densities/types.

Early Zoeal Stages of the Norway Lobster Nephrops norvegicus (L.). Biological 

Bulletin. 216: 335–343.  

In addition to feeding plasticity, adaptations in digestive mechanisms can further 

enhance the ability of larvae to cope with intermittent starvation and/or variations in 

prey quality. In Chapter 4, protease and amylase activity of N. norvegicus was 

investigated in early stage larvae under different feeding scenarios. Amylase activity 

was generally low, indicating that carbohydrates are not used as the primary energy 

reserve and that feeding is required soon after hatching to trigger amylase activity. In 

contrast, protease activity increased in starved larvae after more than 12h of 

starvation, indicating that protein reserves are being catabolized. These highlight the 

role of early feeding plasticity in enzymatic activity of N. norvegicus larvae to overcome 

short-term starvation.

Knowledge of larval distribution and abundance is of major importance to predict the 

location and size of a breeding population. Chapter 5 describes vertical distribution of 

the larvae of a brachyuran crab, Monodaeus couchi. Abundance and distribution of ZI 

and II were correlated. For all stages, abundance decreased with depth during the light 

phase while it increased with depth at night, thus displaying reverse DVM. 

Additionally, this species undergo an ontogenic shift in vertical distribution as earlier 

zoeal stages remain in the upper layers while later stages were encountered deeper.

More generally, Chapter 6 assessed spatial distribution and abundance of the decapod 

larvae in the Southwestern Iberian coast for two consecutive years. Coastal species 

that dominate in the first campaign were almost completely absent the following year 

and annual differences in overall abundances were observed. Additionally, distribution 

and abundance varied between sampling area, which is likely to be the result of 

general circulation patterns. An upwelling event that occurred off the southwest coast 

of Portugal at the time of sampling explained the differences in decapod larvae 

abundances and diversity observed between the Southwestern and Northeastern part 

of the sampling area. In the NE, the most abundant species were retained onshore 

while offshore transport occurred in zooplankton and to a lesser extent in some shelf 

species.

Coast of Portugal. In review, Journal of Sea Research. 

Chapter 7 recapitulates the main finding of the separate data chapters and the 

significance of these results for understanding reproduction, development and survival 

of benthic offshore decapods. The different challenges faced and how each stage has 

evolved to cope and/or overcome them is discussed. Finally, this chapter includes 

suggestions of future directions for offshore decapod research that will allow a better 

understanding of how suboptimal conditions during early life history affect later 

stages. Important characteristics that should be considered when choosing suitable 

model species are also discussed.

Variability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus 

40 

2.1 Abstract 

The present study investigated the existence of inter-individual and within-brood 

variability in the fatty acid (FA) profile of developing embryos of Nephrops norvegicus. 

In all surveyed females (n=5), the quantitatively most important FA were: 22:6n-3 

(20.8±3.9% average of total FA ± standard error), 18:1n-9 (19.5±2.0%), 16:0 

(15.2±3.4%), 20:5n-3 (10.2±1.4%), 16:1n-7 (8.9±1.6%), and 18:1n-7 (5.7±1.3%). 

Differences in FA profiles of embryos in the same clutch were assessed using brooding 

chamber side (left and right) and pleopod (1

&amp;amp; 2

 and 4

 &amp;amp; 5

) as predictive 

factors. There were no significant differences in the FA composition of embryos 

sampled from both sides of the brooding chamber in 4 of the 5 surveyed females. 

However, all females exhibited significant differences in the FA profiles of embryos 

sampled from different pleopods. Similarly, for both saturated FA (SFA) and highly 

unsaturated FA (HUFA), FA profiles were not similar across the breeding chamber. 

Overall, FA reserves appeared to vary significantly within broods, which can ultimately 

be reflected on early larval survival. A potential cause for the within brood variation 

recorded in the FA profile of developing embryos include: 1) differential female 

investment during ovarian maturation, mainly due to variation in food 

quality/availability; 2) differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period of 

developing embryos, as a consequence of embryos position within the female’s 

brooding chamber; or 3) differential female investment during ovarian maturation 

amplified by differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period.

2.2 Introduction 

The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially 

important benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in the Northeastern (NE) 

Atlantic, from the coast of Iceland to Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea 

(d’Udekem d’Acoz 1999). Its depth range extends from 15 to 800 m, although they are 

typically found on the NE Atlantic coast between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. 

1997a). Several studies have already focused on different aspects of the biology and 

fisheries of N. norvegicus, but biochemical data related with the species reproductive 

cycle and embryonic development are still fairly recent and scarce (Rosa et al. 2003; 

Rosa and Nunes 2002; Rotllant et al. 2004; Tuck et al. 1997b). Mating occurs just after 

molting, shortly following the hatching from the previous year. Between 2 to 3 months 

later, an increase in ovary size is observed and during the following 4-5 months, 

vitellogenesis occurs (Rotllant et al. 2005). Spawned embryos are attached to the 

pleopods on the abdomen and incubated over an extensive period (up to 10 month in 

the NE Atlantic, Sardà 1995). In several decapods, and specifically in nephropid 

lobsters, ovarian  maturation has been shown to have high energetic costs, embryonic 

development is lecithotrophic, i.e.: is entirely supported by egg yolk (Rosa and Nunes 

2002).  

In N. norvegicus, lipid profiles of developing ovaries seem to be more dependent on 

the ingestion of dietary lipids than on hepatopancreas reserves (Rosa and Nunes 

2002). In this way, it is possible that female’s feeding status during the extensive 

period over which vitellogenesis occurs can play a decisive role on hatching success 

and larval quality. Off the coast of mainland Portugal, N. norvegicus inhabits muddy 

substrate areas located between 400-800 m depth (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita 

2001). These deep-water habitats are characterized by a relative scarcity of available 

food resources (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999), which may affect the nutritional state 

of females exhibiting developing ovaries and, consequently, potential energetic 

reserves available to fuel embryonic development. It is already known that lipids play a 

central role in embryonic metabolism, as they represent the most important energy 

source and form at least 60% of the total energy expenditure of developing crustacean 

embryos (Wehrtmann and Graeve 1998). In nephropid lobsters (e.g. N. norvegicus and 



Variability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus 

42 

Homarus gammarus), lipid catabolism plays a crucial role during embryonic 

development, with up to70% of initial total lipids being depleted before hatching (Rosa 

et al. 2005; Rosa et al. 2003). 

Among lipids, fatty acids (FA) are critical in embryonic development. Highly 

unsaturated FA (HUFA) with more than 20 C atoms are essential and therefore must be 

ingested from food as crustacean cannot, or only insufficiently, synthesized them de 

novo (Anger 2001).  Long chain HUFA, such as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play important roles in neuronal development, ion 

transport and temperature regulation. Because embryonic development is 

lecithotrophic and essential FA (EFA) cannot be synthesised de novo, these nutrients 

must be supplied by the female into the yolk reserves to ensure successful 

development. In contrast, saturated FA (SFA) can be synthesised from other FA and are 

oxidized to produce energy. 

FA dynamics through embryonic development have been studied in detail for several 

decapod groups, namely caridean shrimp (e.g.: Graeve and Wehrtmann 2003), 

brachyuran crabs (e.g.: Torres et al. 2008) and nephropid lobsters, such as Homarus 

gammarus (Rosa et al. 2005) and N. norvegicus (Rosa et al. 2003). These studies allow 

us to understand the nutritional requirements exhibited by developing embryos along 

the incubation period. However, due to laboratorial constraints associated with the 

analytical techniques employed to perform FA analysis, egg samples of several females 

are commonly pooled together and inter-individual differences are not generally 

assessed. Additionally, to our knowledge, variability of FA profiles in the same egg 

mass has never been determined in any decapod crustacean. Lower oxygen availability 

has already been observed at the center of the condensed egg mass of brachyuran 

crabs (Fernandez et al. 2003). Potential deleterious effects resulting from this decrease 

in oxygen availability are commonly reduced through adaptations in the brooding 

behavior of ovigerous females (Baeza and Fernández 2002). Such brooding behaviors 

(e.g. abdominal flapping) have already been documented in ovigerous N. norvegicus 

(Eriksson et al. 2006). Embryonic metabolic rates commonly increase in reduced 

oxygen environment and yolk reserves provided by the female can be depleted at a 

faster rate (Brante et al. 2003). Although oxygen levels have so far never been 



Chapter 2 

43 

documented in N. norvegicus, hypoxia has already been shown to cause premature 

hatching, reduced embryonic survival and increased embryonic heart beat frequency 

in this species (Eriksson et al. 2006). 

The objective of the present study was to investigate how homogeneous is the fatty 

acid profile of embryos in a single egg mass and test if embryos position along the 

female’s brooding chamber (chamber side and pleopod to which embryos are 

attached) has any effect on their FA composition. Additionally, inter-individual 

variability in the FA profiles of N. norvegicus embryos was also assessed. 

 

2.3 Material and Methods 

2.3.1 Sampling 

Five ovigerous N. norvegicus females (CL: 5.08 ± 0.38 cm), collected in January 2008 by 

a commercial fishing vessel using baited traps off the coast of Sagres (Southwestern 

Coast of mainland Portugal), at an approximate depth of 400 m, were selected for the 

present study. Across the brooding chamber, the embryos carried by each female 

displayed clearly visible eyes with 1/2 yolk consumed and were considered to be in 

development stage II (according to the scale proposed by Rosa et al. 2007). Embryos 

attached to each pleopod were carefully removed with a pair of forceps and stored in 

separate Eppendorfs. A preliminary analysis of eggs randomly sampled from each 

pleopod, indicated that there was no difference in egg size (1.27 ± 0.19 mm
-3

). 

Additionally, a visual inspection revealed that, within a single female, eggs from 

different pleopods were at the same point in development.  

Like most lobster, N. norvegicus ovaries are shaped like an elongated H and posses a 

right and left lobe connected by a small cross lobe (Rotllant et al. 2005). Because of the 

bilateral nature of the ovaries, left and right side pleopods were processed separately 

(not pooled). Due to the reduced number of embryos present in the 1st and 5th pair of 

pleopods, pooled samples of embryos were collected from the 1st and 2nd, as well as 

from the 4th and 5th, pair of pleopods, (see Fig. 1). In this way the following number of 

samples were collected: 2 sides of the brooding chamber (right and left) X 3 groups of

) X 6 replicates X 5 females = 180 samples. Embryos 

were freeze-dried and stored at -32ºC for later biochemical analysis.  

 

2.3.2 Fatty acid analysis 

FA extraction and preparation of methyl esters were carried out according to Lepage 

and Roy (1986) modified by Cohen et al. (1988). Freeze-dried samples (100 mg) were 

transmethylated with 5 ml of methanol/acetyl chloride (95:5 v/v). The mixture was 

sealed in a light-protected Teflon-lined vial under nitrogen atmosphere and heated at 

80°C for 1 h. The vial contents were then cooled, diluted with 1 ml water, and 

extracted with 2 ml of n-heptane. The heptane layer was dried over Na2SO4, 

evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen atmosphere and redissolved in heptane, which 

contained the methyl esters. The methyl esters were then analyzed by gas-liquid 

chromatography, on a VARIAN (Palo Alto, USA) 3800 gas-liquid chromatograph (USA), 

equipped with a flame ionization detector. Separation was carried out on a 0.32 mm × 

30 m fused silica capillary column (film 0.32 µm) Supelcowax 10 (SUPELCO, Bellafonte 

PA, USA) with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.3 ml min
–1

. The column 

temperature was programmed at an initial temperature of 200°C for 10 min, then 

increased at 4°C min
–1 

to 240°C and held there for 16 min. Injector and detector 

temperatures were 250 and 280°C, respectively, and split ratio was 1:100. Peak 

identification was carried out using known standards (GC 462, Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, 

USA). Peak areas were determined using the Varian software and the FA 21:0 was used 

as an internal standard. The detection limit for the FAs analyzed was 0.01 ?g mg
-1

 dry 

weight. 

2.3.3 Statistical analysis 

In order to visualize inter-individual differences in FA profiles, a Principal Coordinate 

Analysis (PCO) was performed, representing differences between all replicate for each 

female along the first two axes. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to 

detect intra-individual differences in: 1) FA composition of N. norvegicus embryos, but 

only considering those representing more than 5% of total FA; 2) SFA composition; and 

3) HUFA composition. We decided to specifically test the differences in SFA and HUFA 



Chapter 2 

45 

composition due to the role that SFA catabolism plays to fuel the energetic demands of 

embryonic development and because several HUFAs are already known to be essential 

FAs for decapods (e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA, docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) 

(Anger 2001). Prior to statistical analysis, all data were square root transformed, in 

order to reduce the contribution of highly and less abundant FA. A resemblance matrix 

was computed using Bray-Curtis similarity.

Variability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus 

46 

Factor pleopod to which embryos are attached was tested based on the 

anteroposterior “migration” taking place during egg spawning in N. norvegicus (the 

first embryos spawned migrate towards the posterior end of the brooding chamber) 

(unpublished data). Factor brooding chamber side was tested due to the elongated H 

like shape displayed by N. norvegicus ovaries, with their right and left lobes connected 

by a small cross-lobe at the level of the heart (Rotllant et al. 2005). The effect of factor 

pleopod (3 levels: 1

&amp;amp; 2

, 3
rd

 and 4
th

 &amp;amp; 5
th

) and factor brooding chamber side (2 

levels: left and right) on FA composition were determined separately for each female 

using an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM).  

ANOSIM calculates a global R statistic that assesses the differences in variability 

between groups, as compared to within groups, and checks for the significance of R 

using permutation tests (Clarke and Gorley 2006). Differences in FA profiles recorded 

for pleopod and side were explored using the similarity percentages routine (SIMPER). 

SIMPER decomposes average Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between all pairs of samples, 

into percentage contributions from each FA, listing FAs in decreasing order of their 

contribution for the dissimilarity (Clarke and Gorley 2006). All statistical tests were 

performed with Primer 6.1 with PERMANOVA add-on (Primer-E Ltd, Plymouth, UK). All 

tests used 9999 permutations. 

 

2.4 Results 

The result of the PCO analysis indicated that, despite high within-brood variability, 

there were difference in FA profiles, especially between female 2, 3 and 5 (Figure 2). 

Within each brooding chamber, a comparison of the size of the embryo, eye and the 

yolk sack that embryos of different pleopods were of similar and therefore at the same 

point in development. The average FA composition of Nephrops norvegicus embryos of 

each sampled female is shown in Table 1. In all analyzed females (n=5), the 

quantitatively most abundant FAs were 22:6n-3 (DHA, representing 20.8 ± 3.9% 

(average ± standard error) of total FA), 18:1n-9 (oleic acid, 19.5 ± 2.0%), 16:0 (palmitic 

acid, 15.2 ± 3.4%), 20:5n-3 (EPA, 10.2 ± 1.4%), 16:1n-7 (palmitoleic acid, 8.9 ± 1.6%), 

and 18:1n-7 (cis-vaccenic acid, 5.7 ±1.3%).

Pleopod and side affected embryonic FA profiles differently, according to female or the 

group of FA tested (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2). When only the FA representing at least 5% of 

total FA composition were considered in the analysis, there was a significant effect of 

factor pleopod in all females (ANOSIM: R &gt; 0.171 ; p &amp;lt;0.008). Considering factor side, 

there was no significant effect on females 1 to 4 (ANOSIM: R &amp;lt;0.074 ; p &gt; 0.098) and 

only on female 5 was recorded a significant effect of brooding chamber side on the FA 

profiles of developing embryos (ANOSIM: R = 0.171 ; p = 0.018). With the exception of 

female 2, the embryos located in 1

Considering the SFA profile alone, there was a significant difference in the FA

along the whole brooding chamber (ANOSIM: R &amp;lt;0.067; p &gt; 0.094). In general, the 

SFAs responsible for the differences detected among samples were, in decreasing 

order, 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0 (with the contribution of each one for those differences 

being &gt; 10%; SIMPER).  

The analysis of embryonic HUFA indicated that there was a significant effect of factor

composition of embryos located in different pleopods (ANOSIM: R = 0.16; p = 0.013), 

but not on different sides of the brooding chamber (ANOSIM: R = 0.102; p = 0.063). 

Finally, female 1 displayed a uniform HUFA composition in embryos located along the 

brooding chamber (ANOSIM: R &amp;lt;0.06; p &gt; 0.163). In general, the HUFAs responsible for 

the differences detected among samples were, in decreasing order, 20:4n-6

2.5 Discussion 

 A strong inter-individual and within brood variability was recorded in the FA profiles 

displayed by developing embryos of N. norvegicus. The FA profile of developing 

embryos is known to change significantly over time and stage II of embryonic 

development may last a couple of months (Rosa et al. 2003). In this way, as egg 

extrusion may have not occurred simultaneously in all sampled specimens, different 

females may have carried early or late developing stage II embryos at sampling. This 

aspect alone may explain the inter-individual variability recorded in embryonic FA 

profiles.  

Overall embryonic FA composition was somewhat different from that previously 

recorded for N. norvegicus off the coast of Portugal (Rosa et al. 2003). The order of the 

5 most abundant FA in stage II of embryonic development was different between the 

two studies.  Additionally, the average content of individual FA (per mg of dry weight) 

was around half the value reported by Rosa et al. (2003). This difference in the 

absolute level of FA is also not surprising, as studies on recently hatched N. norvegicus 

larvae have shown that their biochemical composition may vary significantly among 

locations (Álvarez-Fernández et al. 2009; Rotllant et al. 2004). However, the sampling 

sites of this study and that by Rosa et al. (2003) are only separated by about 200 km. 

Shifts in food resources influencing growth have been shown to affect ovarian lipid 

composition (Tuck et al. 1997b). Therefore, it is possible that the difference recorded 

in the FA composition of developing embryos may rather be explained by inter-annual 

differences in female dietary regimes, than by spatial variability. 

Only two HUFA, EPA and DHA, were recorded in comparable levels as in the previous 

study by Rosa et al. (2003). Both FA are known to play an important developmental 

and structural role (Bell and Dick 1990; Fox et al. 1994; Stanley-Samuelson 1987). Since 

embryonic development in N. norvegicus is lecithotrophic, and HUFA cannot be 

synthesized de novo, these essential FAs must be derived from the diet during 

gametogenesis (Rosa et al. 2007). Some mechanisms may exist to maintain the levels 

of these FA relatively stable both at oviposition, and later through embryonic 

development, even if the FA profile of the food ingested by the female is variable. 



Variability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus 

54 

Indeed, in the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii, lipid, and more specifically HUFA 

composition of both ovaries and newly hatched larvae was not affected by the lipid 

content of the diet (Smith et al. 2004). Within brood variability recorded for the SFA 

profiles of developing embryos between this study and previous ones (Rosa et al. 

2007) may ultimately explain variability recorded in early larval survival. In fact, early 

larval performance was found to be associated with high levels of SFA, as energy is 

released more efficiently through the oxidation of these FA (Turner et al. 2003). 

Nevertheless, during embryonic development, SFA should be depleted first as they are 

catabolized as an energy source while essential fatty acid should be retained for 

growth and development. Off the coast of mainland Portugal, N. norvegicus larvae 

hatch between 400 and 800 m (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita 2001), and therefore in 

an oligotrophic environment. Newly hatched larvae then undergo a migration towards 

the food rich photic zone near surface to forage for suitable prey (dos Santos and Peliz 

2005). In the presence of food, zoea I will readily ingest prey immediately after 

hatching (Pochelon et al. 2009). However, laboratorial studies have also indicated that 

newly hatched N. norvegicus larvae can endure periods of complete food deprivation 

(&gt; 24 h ) by catabolizing embryonic reserves to fulfill their energetic needs 

(unpublished data). Given that N. norvegicus larvae are planktotrophic, qualitative and 

quantitative differences in embryonic reserves, including lipid, will condition their 

ability to cope with periods of starvation following hatching. This has already been 

documented for many decapod species, such as the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii 

(Johnston et al. 2004; Ritar et al. 2003a), the anomuran crabs Lithodes santolla and 

Paralomis granulosa (Kattner et al. 2003) and several penaeid shrimp (D'Abramo 

1989). 

As the embryos analyzed were at stage II of embryonic development, the within brood 

variability recorded for their FA profiles can either result from: 1) differential female 

investment during ovarian maturation, mainly due to variation in food 

quality/availability; 2) differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period of 

developing embryos, as a consequence of embryos position within the female’s 

brooding chamber; or 3) differential female investment during ovarian maturation 

amplified by differential lipid catabolism during the incubation period. As stated above, 



Chapter 2 

55 

lipid reserves available for embryonic development can only be provided by the female 

prior to oviposition. The availability of FA during ovarian maturation will therefore be 

dependent on the quantity and/or quality of dietary items ingested by the female. 

Previous studies in lobsters (Smith et al. 2004), and shrimp (Cahu et al. 1995; Calado et 

al. 2010a; Racotta et al. 2003) indicated that food supplied to females significantly 

affect the FA profiles displayed by produced embryos. Nonetheless, as ovarian 

maturation is a continuous process in N. norvegicus (Rotllant et al. 2005), it’s not likely 

that the differences recorded in the FA profiles of embryos may result from uneven 

nutrient allocation during vitellogenesis.  

Alternatively, differences in environmental conditions within the brooding chamber 

may promote a shift in the FA consumption dynamics during the incubation period. It 

has already been described for brachyuran crabs that within the dense embryo mass 

oxygen concentration can be variable (Fernandez et al. 2003). Contrasting oxygen 

levels can cause variations in embryonic metabolic rates (Brante et al. 2003), which will 

therefore increase energy demand and SFA oxidation. This scenario will cause a 

differential catabolism of embryonic reserves and eventually lead to asynchronous 

larval hatching (Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). Indeed, N. norvegicus 

(personal observation) and Homarus americanus (Pandian 1970), have been recorded 

to hatch their larvae over several consecutive nights. These episodes were often 

considered as a “laboratorial artifact”, but the present data evidencing within brood 

variation in embryonic FA profiles supports the potential occurrence of asynchronous 

embryonic development in the wild, which may ultimately promote asynchronous 

larval hatching. Ultimately, early larval survival will also be affected.  Since embryonic 

development is lecithotrophic and food might not be readily available immediately 

following birth, it can be assumed that the only energy available to the larvae come 

from the yolk reserves. The larvae that had lower energetic embryonic input may not 

be able to successfully reach the following larval stage, even though short term 

survival to suboptimal food conditions can still be possible (e.g.: Calado et al. 2010b; 

Gebauer et al. 1999; Giménez and Anger 2003, 2005; Ritar et al. 2003b; Smith et al. 

2004). 



Variability in embryonic fatty acid profiles in N. norvegicus 

56 

As the present work was performed on stage II embryos, it is impossible to determine 

whether it is maternal investment or embryonic catabolism that is responsible for the 

variability recorded in embryos FA profiles. A continuous monitoring of lipid catabolism 

displayed by developing embryos located in different regions within the same brooding 

chamber, from oviposition to hatching, will certainly help researchers to clarify the 

biochemical variability recorded for N. norvegicus embryos (e.g. by monitoring the FA 

profile of embryos along the brooding chamber immediately after spawning, it will be 

possible to determine if maternal investment in yolk reserves is indeed uniform). 

Additionally, by monitoring oxygen concentration along the brooding chamber through 

embryonic development, researchers can better understand the potential sources of 

variable egg yolk catabolism within the same egg mass. After performing such studies 

it will be possible to determine if and how pre-hatching latent effects are responsible 

for the differences recorded in nephropid larvae hatching synchronism and survival.

3.1 Abstract 

The wide geographical distribution of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, results 

in a delay, with latitudinal decrease, in the larval season from spring to winter. Newly 

hatched larvae of the species may therefore be exposed to suboptimal levels/types of 

prey availability and face intermittent periods of starvation at low latitudes. This work 

investigated the feeding response of the first two zoeal stages of N. norvegicus under 

variable prey densities, prey types, feeding histories and photoperiods. Both zoeae (Z) I 

and II increased the number of consumed prey with increasing food levels. ZI preferred 

Artemia sp. nauplii over larger metanauplii, while in ZII, higher ingestion was only 

observed for metanauplii at higher food concentrations. The number of prey ingested 

by larvae previously starved or under low food conditions was always higher than that 

of larvae exposed to high food levels. These findings seem to indicate that larvae may 

maximize prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher food 

abundance and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of 

intermittent starvation or unsuitable prey densities/types. Extreme photoperiods (24 

and 0h of light) did not improve larval feeding ability and are not a suitable option for 

larviculture. 

 

3.2 Introduction 

The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially 

important benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in the Northeastern Atlantic 

waters from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea (d’Udekem 

d’Acoz 1999). Its depth range extends from 15 to 800 m, although they are typically 

found on the NE Atlantic shelf between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. 1997a) and 

200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sardà 1997). In addition to 

differences in the depth range, the reproduction period of this species also varies 

latitudinally, with average embryo incubation being 10 months in the Northeastern 

Atlantic but only 6 months in the Mediterranean (Sardà 1995). These differences in 

embryo incubation duration are known to affect the hatching period of N. norvegicus 



Chapter 3 

67 

larvae, with hatching occurring by early spring in the Northeastern Atlantic and at the 

end of winter in the Mediterranean (Rotlland et al. 2004). Off the Coast of Portugal, 

adults are encountered at depth ranging from 400 to 800 m and the hatching period 

extends from December until April with however some regional differences, larval 

release peaking earlier in the south than the north. Under these scenarios, early larval 

development at the end of winter will occur in a nutritionally poor environment, since 

chlorophyll a peak only occurs during spring (Moita 2001; Santos et al. 2007). Late 

larval release will overlap with the beginning of thermal stratification and spring bloom 

(Santos et al. 2007). 

Regardless of geographical and seasonal differences in nutritional conditions, it is 

widely accepted that planktonic larvae are naturally subjected to intermittent periods 

of starvation and/or suboptimal prey availability due to the natural patchiness of 

plankton distribution in the oceanic environment (Andersen and Nielsen 2002; Folt and 

Burns 1999; Pinel-Alloul 1995). Studies addressing larval feeding in clawed lobsters 

have highlighted how early larval feeding greatly affects their development, since 

these organisms may not recover from nutritional stress if suitable food is not available 

shortly after hatching (Anger et al. 1985; Rotlland et al. 2001). Newly hatched N. 

norvegicus larvae from the Mediterranean are larger in size and richer in lipids and 

proteins than those from the Irish sea, which emphasize the major role that these 

features may play for larval survival in oligotrophic environments (Rotlland et al. 2004).  

Larvae submitted to low food conditions use several feeding strategies, and may either 

morphologically (Fenaux et al. 1994; Strathmann et al. 1993) or behaviorally 

(McConaugha 2002) enhance their overall feeding efficiency. Planktonic larvae of many 

benthic species appear to have evolved a certain feeding plasticity, in order to be able 

to feed over a broad range of prey sizes, types and abundances (Hinz et al. 2001; 

McConaugha 2002; Perez and Sulkin 2005; Strathmann and Bone 1997). By feeding on 

smaller and/or suboptimal food items, developing larvae may minimize the negative 

effects of low food density and avoid starvation. In fact, this feeding plasticity had 

already been previously documented in homarid lobsters, with the last zoeal stage of 

Homarus americanus being recorded to successfully perform suspension feeding (in 



Larval feeding of N.norvegicus  

68 

contrast to the most commonly recorded raptorial feeding behavior) (Barshaw and 

Bryant-Rich 1988). 

Despite the number of studies addressing N. norvegicus larval biology (Briggs et al. 

2002; Dickey-Collas et al. 2000a; dos Santos and Peliz 2005; Rotlland et al. 2004) and 

aquaculture potential (Anger and Puschel 1986; Figueiredo and Vilela 1972; Morais et 

al. 2001; Rosa et al. 2003; Rotlland et al. 2001), little is still known about the feeding 

ability of early zoeal stages.  

Our objective was to assess the feeding ability of N. norvegicus zoea (Z) I and II under 

variable feeding scenarios and to identify the existence of feeding plasticity in these 

early zoeal stages. In this way, the feeding response of N. norvegicus ZI and ZII under 

variable prey densities, prey types and experiencing previous feeding histories was 

investigated. Additionally, due to the current interest in the larviculture of 

N. norvegicus, mainly for restocking purposes, the effect of extreme photoperiods (24 

and 0 hours of light) on prey consumption for both zoeal stages was also evaluated. 

 

3.3 Material and Methods  

3.3.1 Larval production and selection 

Five N. norvegicus ovigerous females were collected between February and April 2008 

using baited traps near Peniche (West Coast of Portugal), at an approximate depth of 

400 m, and kept in the laboratory until their larvae hatched. Newly hatched larvae 

were either selected for the experiments described bellow or reared to the second 

zoeal stage using a recirculating larviculture system employing 20 l cylindrico-spherical 

culture tanks (see Calado 2008 for further details). Larvae were fed daily with newly 

hatched Artemia sp. nauplii (San Francisco Bay Brand Inc., Newark, CA, USA) supplied 

at a density of 5 nauplii ml
-1

, with Artemia sp. cysts being incubated according to the 

procedures described by Sorgeloos et al. (1998). During the culture period, 

N. norvegicus larvae were maintained in constant darkness at 15±1ºC in a 

temperature-controlled culture room. Natural seawater at a salinity of 35 was 1 µm 

filtered, passed through activated carbon and UV irradiated before being used in the 



Chapter 3 

69 

larviculture system. Larvae were only used in the experimental trials 24 h after 

hatching or molting to the second zoeal stage, in order to guarantee that tested 

specimens already displayed larval appendages involved in prey capture, manipulation 

and ingestion that were fully functional. Additionally, only those specimens displaying 

strong phototactic responses were selected for the experimental trials, since this 

behavior is commonly employed in crustacean aquaculture to evaluate larval quality 

(see Treece and Fox 1993). In all experimental trials, larvae at both zoeal stages were 

placed individually in 40 ml plastic beakers with filtered seawater at a salinity of 35 in a 

climatized chamber at 15±1ºC. Larvae recorded as dead or moribund (laying 

motionless in the bottom of the plastic beaker for prolonged periods but still beating 

the exopods of their pereiopods) at the end of experimental trials were discarded and 

those replicates repeated. To ensure a homogenized distribution of prey in the water 

column during the experimental trials, minimizing the positive phototactic behavior of 

larvae and dietary prey, each plastic beaker was gently aerated at a rate of ca. one air 

bubble per second. 

3.3.2 Effect of prey densities and photoperiods 

The feeding ability of N. norvegicus larvae was evaluated by providing to both ZI and ZII 

four different prey densities (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 Artemia sp.  nauplii ml
-1

) under three 

distinct photoperiods (24, 12 and 0 h of light). After 24 h, the number of live prey 

remaining in the plastic beaker was counted under a binocular stereomicroscope, with 

damaged Artemia sp. nauplii (e.g. missing one or both antenna or their abdomen) 

being considered as ingested. Five replicates were used for each treatment for a total 

of 60 specimens (4 densities × 3 photoperiods × 5 replicates = 60) per each larval stage. 

The variable used to assess the feeding ability of both ZI and ZII was the total number 

of larval prey ingested after 24 h.

sp. metanauplii enriched with the commercial product Algamac™ 2000 produced by 

Aquafauna, Biomarine Inc., Hawthorne, CA, USA (MetaAlga, average size 592 ±7 ?m)

and enriched with the spray dried microalgae Spirulina (MetaSpi, average size 

591 ± 6 ?m)) and four prey densities (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 prey ml
-1

) on the feeding ability of 

the first and second zoeal stages of N. norvegicus was evaluated. The enrichments 

were conducted according to the protocols described by Morais et al. (2001) during 

16h in 1 l beakers, with strong aeration and a maximum density of 50 nauplii.ml-1; 0.1g 

of product was used in 1 l of seawater. All trials were performed under a 12 h light :12 

h dark photoperiod. After 24 h the number of live dietary prey in each beaker was 

counted using the methods and criteria described above. Five replicates were used for 

each treatment for a total of 80 specimens (4 prey types × 4 densities × 5 

replicates = 80) per each larval stage. The variable used to assess the feeding ability of 

both ZI and ZII under the experimental conditions was the total number of larval prey 

ingested after 24 h. 

3.3.4 Effect of previous feeding histories 

In order to investigate the feeding ability of N. norvegicus ZI and II previously exposed 

to different feeding histories, larvae were acclimated for 12 h to three different 

feeding scenarios: starvation, low prey density (0.5 dietary prey ml-1), and high prey 

density (5 dietary prey ml-1). After the 12 h acclimation period, larvae from each 

feeding scenario were placed either under low or high prey densities (0.5 and 5 dietary 

prey ml-1, respectively) for an additional 12 h. The dietary prey provided to ZI and ZII 

were newly hatched Artemia sp. nauplii and Artemia sp. metanauplii enriched with 

Algamac™ 2000, respectively. The two stages were not fed with the same prey item 

since each stage displayed a different preference in the experiment “effect of prey 

types and prey densities”. ZI ate more nauplii and ZII more MetaAlga. All trials were 

performed under a 12 h light :12 h dark photoperiod. At the end of the experimental 

period, the number of live dietary prey was counted according to the criteria 

previously described. Five replicates were used for each treatment for a total of 30 

specimens (6 feeding histories × 5 replicates = 30) per each larval stage. The variable 

used to assess the feeding ability of both zoeal stages was the total number of larval 

prey ingested in the 12 hours following the end of the acclimation period.

3.3.5 Statistical analysis 

The feeding ability of the two first zoeal stages of N. norvegicus under the first two 

experimental conditions was compared using multi-way factorial analysis of variance 

ANOVA. The factors tested for each ANOVA were: prey densities (4 levels), 

photoperiods (3 levels), and zoeal stage (2 levels) for the experiment “Effect of prey 

densities and photoperiods”; prey types (4 levels), prey densities (4 levels), and zoeal 

stage (2 levels) for the experiment “Effect of prey types and prey densities”. Finally, for 

the experiment “Effect of feeding histories” a one-way ANOVA (6 levels) was used 

separately for each zoeal stage. Statistical analyses were performed using the software 

STATISTICA 6.0 (manufactured by StatSoft Inc., USA). Prior to analysis, assumptions 

were verified and data transformed whenever necessary. Whenever significance was 

accepted, at P &amp;lt;0.05, the Tukey multiple comparison test was used (Zar 1999). 

Subsequently, average prey consumption will always be reported with its standard 

deviation (mean ± SD). 

 

3.4 Results 

3.4.1 Effect of prey densities and photoperiods 

There was a significant interaction between larval stage*light regime*prey density 

(ANOVA; df = 6, F = 7.77; P &amp;lt;0.001). Feeding responses under either 0 h or 24 h of light 

differed according to prey density (Figure 1). Zoeae I average prey consumption was 

higher under the lowest and highest prey densities when exposed to 24 h of light 

(19.0 ± 0.7 and 112.0 ± 18.6 prey consumed, respectively) than in complete darkness 

(14.4 ± 0.3 and 96.0 ± 7.4 prey consumed, respectively). Under the three highest prey 

density, zoeae I prey consumption was highest under 12 h of light. Concerning zoeae II, 

average prey consumption under 24 h of light was the same as in complete darkness 

under all three lowest prey density but was lower (83.6 ± 8.6 and 120.8 ± 13.1) at the 

highest prey concentration. Under all tested feeding densities, prey consumption of 

larvae at the second zoeal stage was significantly higher under 12 h illumination 

(17.2 ± 2.7, 34.2 ± 2.8, 99.0 ± 4.3 and 142.8 ± 4.1 prey consumed for larvae fed at 0.5,

, respectively; Figure 1). Other general trends can also be observed, 

such as a significant overall increase of consumed prey with increasing food levels 

(from 15.6 ± 3.2 to 112.9 ± 21.7, df = 3, F = 1750.34; P &amp;lt;0.001), for both larval stages 

and light regime experienced combined (Figure 1). Additionally, prey ingestion for both 

zoeal stages varied significantly with light conditions (df = 2, F = 35.38; P &amp;lt;0.001), but 

was identical for both stages under the same light regime (df = 1, F = 2.92; P = 0.91).

3.4.2 Effect of prey types and prey densities 

A significant interaction between larval stage*prey type*prey density was observed 

(ANOVA; df = 9, F = 22.2; P &amp;lt;0.001). Regarding the first zoea, at low prey density, the 

number of prey ingested did not differ across prey types (17.6 ± 2.2, 15.0 ± 0.7, 

13.4 ± 1.3, and 12.8 ± 0.8 for Naup, Meta, MetaAlga and MetaSpi, respectively; Figure 

2). However, as prey density increased, prey consumption of metanauplii was reduced. 



Chapter 3 

73 

For a prey concentration of 1 prey ml
-1

, consumption of Naup and Meta were identical 

but were higher than consumption of MetaAlga and MetaSpi. Finally, for the two 

highest prey densities, significantly more Naup were consumed than Meta which was, 

in turn, consumed in higher quantities than MetaAlga and MetaSpi (P &amp;lt;0.001). There 

was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.972) in the number of ingested enriched 

metanauplii at all tested prey densities (Figure 2). Concerning Zoea II, number of prey 

ingested did not also differ among prey types when these were provided at the lowest 

concentration  (17.2 ± 2.7, 19.4 ± 0.9, 19.2 ± 0.8, and 19.2 ± 0.8 Naup, Meta, MetaAlga 

and MetaSpi, respectively; Figure 2). However, under the two highest prey densities 

consumption of Naup was always significantly lower (P &amp;lt;0.001) than that of all 

metanauplii. Under all tested prey densities, consumption of Meta, MetaAlga and 

MetaSpi was always similar (P &gt; 0.999) (Figure 2). Finally, larval feeding ability was 

significantly different between both zoeal stages, with first zoeae consuming less prey 

than second zoeae (stage; df = 1, F = 3802.3; P &amp;lt;0.001).

3.4.3 Effect of previous feeding histories 

A significant effect of feeding history was recorded for both stages (ANOVA, Z1:df = 5, 

F = 1116.13; P &amp;lt;0.001; Z2: df = 5, F =  1873.40; P &amp;lt;0.001).  Larvae of either stage 

previously starved for 12 h always consumed more prey than those allowed to feed 

under higher or lower prey densities during the acclimation period (Figure 3). 

However, exposing larvae to a higher (5 prey ml
-1

) or lower (0.5 prey ml
-1

) prey 

concentration during the acclimation period promoted different feeding responses by 

larvae subsequently placed under high or low food conditions (Figure 3). Zoeae 

acclimated to low and high food concentrations did not show differences in the 

number of prey consumed (P &gt; 0.999) when subsequently placed under low food 

concentrations (8.8 ± 0.4, and 9.2 ± 0.8 Naup consumed by ZI and 8.8 ± 1.3 and 

9.0 ± 1.0 MetaAlga consumed by ZII, respectively). In contrast, larvae acclimated to low 

food conditions consumed significantly more prey (P &amp;lt;0.001) than those acclimated to 

high food densities, when subsequently placed in high food conditions (69.4 ± 2.4 and 

56.6 ± 4.7 Naup consumed by ZI, and 97.2s ± 4.1 and 84.4 ± 3.8 MetaAlga consumed by 

ZII, respectively; Figure 3).  

 

3.5 Discussion 

In this study, larval prey consumption increased with prey density (from 0.5 to 5 

prey ml
-1

). The number of prey ingested did not reach a plateau suggesting that 

maximum prey consumption was not reached and would probably only be attained at 

higher prey densities. Successful culture of N. norvegicus larvae to the juvenile stage is 

possible using a diet of enriched Artemia sp. metanauplii, although survival to 

metamorphosis is always low (Anger and Puschel 1986; Dickey-Collas et al. 2000b; 

Figueiredo and Vilela 1972). In the present study it is possible that larval energetic 

requirements were not fulfilled. A lack of satiation is consistent with the observed 

linear increase in the number of ingested prey and supports the general belief that 

Artemia sp. is an inferior diet when compared to natural plankton (e.g. copepods), 

(Helland et al.  2003; Shields et al.  1999;  Sorgeloos et  al. 1998).  As a result,  energetic

needs were not met. In this way, if the present study had been performed using 

natural food items the tested prey densities may have promoted different results and 

food intake at higher densities would have stabilize at a saturation prey density. 

However, further experiment is needed to support this hypothesis.  

Although consumption under low prey density was not affected by prey type or larval 

stage, larval ingestion under higher prey densities was influenced by these two factors. 

Concerning ZI, the smaller size and inferior swimming speed of Artemia sp. nauplii can 

explain the higher consumption recorded for this type of prey, when compared to 

metanauplii. The lower consumption of enriched metanauplii, in comparison to 

unenriched ones, was probably due to their higher nutritional value, since unenriched 

and enriched metanauplii displayed similar sizes and swimming speeds. Feeding on 

enriched metanauplii may have caused ZI to reach satiation faster than when ingesting 



Larval feeding of N.norvegicus  

76 

a similar number of less nutritive unenriched metanauplii. Therefore, the present 

results suggest that the nutritional value of food items in a plankton patch will directly 

influence the number of prey ingested by ZI of N. norvegicus. The quality of a prey item 

is likely to vary with its nutritional state and this in turn affects larval feeding on that 

item (Dalsgaard et al. 2003). Therefore, larvae at the same development stage (thus 

with identical predatory ability) will capture and ingest different numbers of the same 

dietary item dwelling in a plankton patch, as a function of its nutritional value.  

Regarding ZII, these larvae clearly displayed a preference for larger prey, eating 

significantly more metanauplii than nauplii. The small sized Artemia sp. nauplii did not 

trigger a proper predatory response and promoted lower prey consumption. In larval 

decapods it is not unusual to record a shift in larval prey’s preference during 

development, with early stages preferring smaller food items, while later stages switch 

towards larger prey (McConaugha et al. 1991). Nonetheless, larger stages continue to 

ingest smaller prey if these are available (Harvey and Epifanio 1997), although larvae 

become increasingly selective at higher prey densities (Yúfera et al. 1984). In 

opposition to ZI, larvae in the second zoeal stage ingested similar numbers of enriched 

and unenriched Artemia sp. metanauplii. This similar feeding response to metanauplii 

may have been promoted by the fact that with neither prey types the larvae were able 

to reach satiation. Apparently, N. norvegicus ZII require larger and/or more nutritious 

dietary prey. In the wild this feeding response will result in a lower energetic intake if 

larvae dwell in a plankton patch dominated by prey with “low nutritional quality”. It is 

possible that numerous dietary prey types can be available in a plankton patch but that 

the one available at the highest concentration is not nutritionally balanced to support 

optimal zooplankton growth. Ultimately, these prey may occur at high concentration 

because they are avoided by predating larvae (Mitra and Flynn 2006b). At least under 

culture conditions, the nutritional inadequacy of prey items can result in partial 

starvation and promote lower growth and survival (Harvey and Epifanio 1997). If 

developing N. norvegicus larvae are regularly exposed to suboptimal dietary prey, 

which they will ingest to avoid starvation, the resulting nutritional stress may still 

induce larval mortality. Therefore, in order to develop successfully, larvae must 



Chapter 3 

77 

regularly have at their disposal not only suitable numbers of dietary items, but also 

nutritionally balanced prey. 

Zoeal stages of decapods are not capable of long periods of sustained horizontal 

swimming and may not be able to remain in food patches (Harden Jones 1980). This 

constraint will probably impair larvae to feed continuously throughout their ontogenic 

development (Pitchford et al. 2003). In the present research, early stage N. norvegicus 

larvae increased the number of prey consumed after previously experiencing food 

deprivation or low prey abundance. These feeding behaviors may allow N. norvegicus 

larvae to overcome intermittent periods of starvation, or suboptimal feeding levels, 

caused by the natural patchiness of plankton and abundance of suitable prey. A similar 

reaction would be expected in response to changes in food conditions due to variable 

prey composition caused by diel vertical migration of zooplankton (Forward 1988).  

Although both zoeal stages displayed distinct prey preferences, larvae readily ingested 

all types of tested prey, even if these were “suboptimal” (e.g. the consumption of 

Artemia sp. nauplii by ZII). Adjacent plankton patches are not always similar in their 

species composition, and these may vary in terms of prey shape, size, quantity and 

quality (Petrone et al. 2005). The plasticity displayed by N. norvegicus larvae, in terms 

of prey types ingested, may therefore be an important adaptation to pelagic life. Even 

though N. norvegicus larvae yolk reserves may differ spatially and seasonally (Rotlland 

et al. 2004), they do not exhibit primary lecithotrophy, being unable to advance to 

Zoea II in the absence of food (personal observation). In that sense, and as suggested 

by modeling studies (Gentleman et al. 2003; Mitra and Flynn 2006a), the capability to 

maximize food intake when prey are available, regardless of their type or quality, can 

temporarily reduce the effects of starvation in oligotrophic winter conditions until 

suitable prey are available. In contrast, when the hatching of N. norvegicus occurs at 

the time of the spring bloom, and prey items are more abundant and varied (dos 

Santos et al. 2007), adequate prey are more likely to be available for newly hatched 

and developing larvae. In that sense, optimal foraging theory would predict that a 

predator adopts the feeding behavior that generates the highest intake rate of energy, 

with the consumption of suboptimal prey being highly reduced (Kiørboe et al. 1996). 

However, no study has ever addressed the existence of potential morphological and 



Larval feeding of N.norvegicus  

78 

behavioral constraints in N. norvegicus larvae that may mask and/or preclude optimal 

foraging. In this way, the present results and those from previous laboratorial studies 

addressing the feeding of Norway lobster larvae should be extrapolated with caution 

to a pelagic environment with complex plankton patches dynamics. 

Larval feeding ability was affected by photoperiod duration, with the number of 

ingested prey being consistently superior when 12 h of light were employed, 

regardless of prey density or larval stage. However, responses to light may vary 

significantly during larval development of decapods (Bermudes and Ritar 2008). 

Several studies on crustacean larvae (Calado et al. 2008; Gardner and Maguire 1998; 

Starkweather 1976; Teschke et al. 2007), and especially spiny lobsters (Bermudes and 

Ritar 2008; Bermudes et al. 2008; Mikami and Greenwood 1997), have demonstrated 

that food intake, survival and molt stage duration are positively impacted by the 

presence of any kind of periodic light regime. Although decapod larvae are good 

swimmers, true hunting behaviors (e.g. prey chasing) are not displayed and these 

organisms solely rely on chance encounters with dietary prey (Epelbaum and Borisov 

2006; Gonor and Gonor 1973). This feeding behavior has been termed by Berkes 

(1975) as “encounter feeding”. Since swimming activity of many decapods increases in 

the presence of light (Forward et al. 1984; Sulkin 1984), larvae will have increased 

chances of encountering dietary prey. However, constant illumination will increase 

energy expenditure and therefore reduce survivorship since larvae remain 

permanently active in the laboratory (Calado et al. 2008; Dawirs 1982). Although under 

constant darkness feeding remained possible, despite a lower consumption rate, 24 h 

of light did not promote higher prey ingestion than 12  h of light. These results seem to 

indicate that N. norvegicus larvae may also feed during the dark:light interface, as 

already suggested for spiny lobsters larvae (Bermudes and Ritar 2008). Apparently, the 

occurrence of a light:dark phase optimizes larval growth and feeding performances, 

regardless of the duration of the light phase, suggesting that the transition between 

day and night plays a greater role rather than the duration of the photoperiod itself 

(Bermudes and Ritar 2008; Bermudes et al. 2008; Starkweather 1976).  

In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that unsatiated N. norvegicus 

larvae are able to increase prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with 



Chapter 3 

79 

higher food abundance. The feeding plasticity indicates that early stage larvae may be 

able to withstand and recover from periods of suboptimal food conditions by switching 

prey preference and increasing consumption once optimal foraging conditions are 

encountered. Both prey availability and prey size play a crucial role in the 

trophodynamics of developing N. norvegicus larvae. Extreme photoperiods resulted in 

lower prey consumption for both larval stages and their use in N. norvegicus 

larviculture is not recommended.

Enzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea

4.1 Abstract 

In Portuguese waters, Nephrops norvegicus larvae hatch at 400-800 m depth and need 

to perform a vertical migration to food-rich shallower waters to find suitable prey. The 

effect of suboptimal feeding on digestive enzymes activity of N. norvegicus larvae 

during this early period of their larval life remains unknown. Protease and amylase 

activity was investigated ex situ using flurometry in laboratory hatched larvae exposed 

to different feeding and/or starving scenarios in the 24 h following hatching, the 

period during which they typically accomplish their upward vertical migration. 

Amylase activity was very low in comparison to protease activity, indicating that 

carbohydrates are not a primary energy reserve. Larvae starved for 12h and 

subsequently fed displayed no increase in amylase activity, which suggests that 

feeding may be required before 12h post-hatch to trigger amylase activity. Protease 

activity was high under all feeding conditions and the increase of protease activity 

under sustained starvation indicated the catabolism of protein reserves. The ability of 

first stage N. norvegicus larvae to metabolize protein reserves may play a decisive role 

for their survival during their first vertical migration, as it enables them to overcome 

the deleterious effects of short-term starvation and/or suboptimal feeding. 

 

4.2 Introduction 

The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially 

important benthic decapod crustacean commonly found in Northeastern Atlantic 

waters, from the Coast of Iceland to Morocco, and in the Mediterranean Sea 

(d’Udekem d’Acoz 1999). After embryonic incubation on the female abdomen, larvae 

are released from the eggs, which then develop through three zoeal planktonic stages, 

each intermolt period lasting about 10 days at 10ºC (Figueiredo and Vilela 1972), and 

then migrate back to the bottom as a post-larva before settling on the benthos as a 

juvenile. The adult depth range varies from 15 to 800 m, although they are typically 

found on the NE Atlantic coast between 300 and 600 m depth (Tuck et al. 1997a) and 



Chapter 4 

91 

200 and 800 m in the Mediterranean (Maynou and Sardà 1997). In addition to 

differences in the depth range, the reproduction period of this species also varies with 

latitude, as average embryo incubation period lasts up to 10 months in the 

Northeastern Atlantic and only 6 months in the Mediterranean Sea (Sardà 1995). 

These latitudinal differences affect the timing of larval hatching in N. norvegicus , with 

larval release occurring by early spring in the Northeastern Atlantic and at the end of 

winter in the Mediterranean (Rotllant et al. 2004). Off the Coast of Portugal, adult 

Norway lobsters occur at depths ranging from 400 to 800 m and larval hatching period 

is known to take place from December to April (dos Santos and Peliz 2005). In this 

way, while larvae hatching at the end of winter will face a nutritionally poor 

environment, larvae hatching a few months later will overlap with the beginning of 

thermal stratification and the spring bloom [chlorophyll a peaks, and therefore 

zooplankton blooms (dos Santos et al. 2007; Moita 2001)].  

Apart from seasonal variations, the depth where larval hatching takes place may also 

play a role in food availability. N. norvegicus larvae hatch below 300 m depth off the 

Portuguese coast (dos Santos and Peliz 2005) and at these depths larval prey may not 

be available to fulfill the nutritional needs of first stage N. norvegicus larvae. In fact, it 

is possible that suitable prey may only be available once these larvae reach the upper 

regions of the water column (Labropoulou and Kostikas 1999). After hatching, N. 

norvegicus larvae are known to migrate vertically to the photic zone, as stage I larvae 

have already been recorded in Portuguese waters at depths as low as 60-70 m (dos 

Santos and Peliz 2005). This aspect of N. norvegicus early life cycle may translate into 

a potential period of suboptimal feeding, or even post-hatching starvation.  

Larvae of N. norvegicus are capable of maximizing food intake when prey are 

available, regardless of their type or quality, and therefore can temporarily attenuate 

the deleterious effects of starvation (Pochelon et al. 2009a). Although the analysis of 

late stage embryos of homarid lobsters has revealed that newly hatched larvae still 

contain considerable energetic reserves (Pandian 1970a, b; Rosa et al. 2005; Rosa et 



Enzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea 

92 

al. 2003), these organisms may not recover from nutritional stress if suitable prey are 

not available soon after hatching (Anger et al. 1985; Rotllant et al. 2001). 

In this way, the study of digestive enzymes can help clarify how first stage larvae of N. 

norvegicus cope with the potential absence of suitable prey at great depths, as well as 

during their ontogenetic migration towards food-richer environments in ocean upper 

layers. Digestive enzymes dynamics during periods of starvation (or suboptimal 

feeding) indicate which nutrients act as energy reserves and which are preferentially 

catabolized (Johnston 2003; Johnston et al. 2004; Jones et al. 1997; Kamarudin et al. 

1994; Lovett and Felder 1990b; Rotllant et al. 2010). For instance, high protease 

activity is indicative of protein catabolism, while amylase activity indicates the 

consumption of carbohydrates (Johnston 2003; Kamarudin et al. 1994). It is not 

consensual whether proteins play the major role as energy sources to fuel decapod 

larvae during starvation (Anger 2001; Johnston et al. 2004), since lipids also appear to 

be catabolized when larvae are deprived of food (Ritar et al. 2003a). However, lipase 

activity has been shown not to be significantly affected during either feeding or 

starvation of the first larval stage of nephropid lobsters (Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990a, 

b). The nutritional relevance of carbohydrates for decapods crustaceans is still not 

fully understood, as marine decapods are not able to efficiently store carbohydrates 

reserves (Sánchez-Paz et al. 2006). Nonetheless, it has been suggested that amylase 

may play other metabolic roles, which still need further investigation, than simply 

catabolizing carbohydrates (Jones et al. 1997). By studying amylase activity in 

carnivorous larvae, it may be possible to understand why this enzyme is commonly 

active in these organisms in spite of the scarcity of its substrate.  

So far, no study has ever investigated the shifts in digestive enzyme activity of N. 

norvegicus larvae exposed to various periods of starvation and/or feeding during their 

first hours of life, during which they perform their first vertical migration. In this way, 

the objective of the present research was to determine through laboratory 

experiment the protease and amylase activity in first stage N. norvegicus in response 

to extended and intermittent periods of starvation and feeding (lipase activity was not

considered in the present study, as it is known not to be significantly affected by food 

intake in the first larval stage of other nephropid lobsters; Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990a; 

Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990b). The experimental feeding regimes selected in the present 

work aim to simulate different feeding scenarios that N. norvegicus larvae may 

experience during their vertical migration from deeper to shallower waters. 

 

4.3 Materials and Methods 

4.3.1 Larval production 

Ovigerous N. norvegicus were collected between February and April 2008 using 

commercial baited traps off Peniche (West Coast of Portugal), at an approximate 

depth of 400 m, and stocked in the laboratory. Ovigerous females were held in 

individual aquaria (0.4 m x 0.2 m x 0.3 m ? 24 L) placed in a temperature controlled 

room (15±1ºC), until their larvae hatched. Larval release always occurred within a 

week from capture and females were therefore not fed prior to hatching. Natural 

seawater was used, at a salinity of 35. Seawater was 1 µm filtered, passed through 

activated carbon and UV irradiated before being used. About one third of the volume 

of each broodstock aquarium was replaced by new filtered seawater every other day. 

4.3.2 Larval feeding trials 

Within one hour of hatching, N. norvegicus larvae were removed from the aquaria 

using a plastic cup and randomly distributed across the eight experimental trials and a 

control. Only those specimens displaying strong phototactic responses were selected 

for the experimental trials, since this behavior is commonly employed in crustacean 

aquaculture to evaluate larval quality (see Treece and Fox 1993). Larvae were sampled 

for later enzyme analysis at the end of a set period under predefined conditions. 

Those included, a control group of newly hatched (NH) larvae sampled immediately 

after hatching, larvae collected 6, 12 and 24 h after hatching in either continuous 

starvation or feeding (S6, S12, S24, F6, F12 and F24, respectively), and two “mixed” 

treatments where larvae were sampled 24 h after being initially starved for 12 h and 



Enzymatic activity of N. norvegicus zoea 

94 

fed on the following 12 h; or being initially fed for the first 12 h and subsequently 

starved in the next 12 h (S12F12 and F12S12, respectively). For each of the nine 

groups, 15 larvae were placed individually in 40 mL plastic beakers with filtered 

seawater at a salinity of 35 in a climatized chamber at 15±1ºC under constant 

darkness (to prevent larval prey from grouping at the surface of the beaker due to 

their positive phototaxis). Larvae in the feeding treatments were provided with newly 

hatched Artemia sp. nauplii (San Francisco Bay Brand Inc., Newark, CA, USA) at a 

density of 5 nauplii mL-1, with Artemia sp. cysts being incubated according to the 

procedures described by Sorgeloos et al. (1998). To ensure a homogenized 

distribution of prey in the water column during the experimental trials, each plastic 

beaker was gently aerated at a rate of ca. one air bubble per second.  

At the end of each experimental trial, larvae were stored for later enzyme analyses, as 

described by Rotllant et al. (2008). In brief, larvae were gently dried on filter paper 

and individually placed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf before being freeze-dried and stored at -

32ºC for later analysis. Prior to enzymes analysis, each larva was homogenized in 100 

µL of distilled water and sonicated in an ice bath with three short pulses of 2 s (Vibra-

cell., Sonics, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4ºC. 

The supernatant was kept on ice and used for the analysis of amylase and protease 

activity, as well as larval protein content. 

4.3.3 Amylase activity 

The homogenate to quantify amylase activity was diluted to 1:50 in the case of larvae 

fed for 6, 12 and 24 h, and 1:10 for all other treatments. From this diluted sample 50 

e along with in 50 ?l of a working substrate (prepared 

following the manufacturer’s protocol “EnzCheck
®
 Ultra Amylase Assey Kit” *E33651; 

Molecular Probes
®
]) was used for the analysis. Fluorescence was measured at 485 nm 

(excitation) and 535 nm (emission) for 10 min at 30ºC. Samples were assayed in 

duplicates. 

 



Chapter 4 

95 

4.3.4 Protease analysis 

To quantify protease activity 100 µL of Tris-HCl 0.1 M pH 8.0 and 10 µL of fluorescent 

casein (C-2990_25mg; Molecular Probes
®
) were added to 10 µL of the homogenate 

and incubated for 1 h at 37ºC. The reaction was then stopped by adding 30 µL of TCA 

20%. The reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 12500 rpm at 4ºC and 50µL of the 

supernatant was added to a microplate along with 200 µL of Tris-HCl 0.5M pH 8.5. 

Fluorescence was measured at 485 nm (excitation) and 538 nm (emission) for 20 ms 

at 30ºC. Samples were assayed in duplicates. Additionally, a blank was conducted for 

each sample where the homogenate was added to the substrate and buffer after the 

reaction has been stopped. The measured value of the blank was then subtracted to 

correct the value of the samples (Rotllant et al. 2010).  

4.3.5 Protein analysis 

In order to standardize enzymatic activity data, the latter was expressed as specific 

activity (RFU/min/?g prt). Protein content was measured in the homogenates as 

described by Bradford (1976) using Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent (BioRad 500- 

0205) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7906) as the standard. Samples were 

assayed placing 15 µL of the homogenate in a 48 flat bottom transparent microplates 

with 985 µL Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent (BioRad 500- 0205) and read at 595 nm 

4.3.6 Statistical analysis 

Differences between each treatment in both per individual and specific enzymes 

activity were compared. Given that all larvae survived through the experimental 

period, the number of larvae employed on enzymatic analysis was identical to the 

ones used on each feeding trial (n=15). Due to the non-normality of the data a 

Kruskal-Wallis test was used (Zar 1999) followed by a non-parametric post-hoc tests 

comparing mean rank of all pairs of groups (Siegel and Castellan 1988). All tests were 

performed using STATISTICA 8.0 (manufactured by StatSoft Inc., USA).

4.4 Results 

Total amylase activity of first stage N. norvegicus larvae varied significantly with the 

feeding regime (Kruskal-Wallis test, H138 =85.1, P&lt;0.001). Total amylase activity was 

not significantly different (post-hoc tests, P&gt;0.24) between newly hatched (NH) and 

permanently starved larvae (S6, S12 and S24), nor from that displayed by larvae under 

fed/starved treatments (S12F12 and F12S12) (Figure 1a). A significant increase in total 

amylase activity was however observed in constantly fed larvae (post-hoc tests, 

P&lt;0.009). After 6 h of feeding, amylase total activity was similar to that recorded for 

larvae in the F12S12 treatment (post-hoc tests, P&gt;0.9). Highest total amylase activity 

was found after 12 h or more of continuous feeding, with both F12 and F24 larvae 

displaying significantly higher activity than all other groups (post-hoc tests, P&lt;0.03), 

with the exception of F6 larvae (post-hoc test, P&gt;0.9). Finally, larvae in the S12F12 

treatment displayed levels of total amylase activity similar to those of starved larvae 

(post-hoc tests, P&lt;0.48) and significantly lower than that of F12 larvae (post-hoc test, 

P&gt;0.03).  

Total protease activity displayed by larvae exposed to different feeding regimes was 

more variable (Figure 2a), although significant differences were still recorded (Kruskal-

Wallis test, H143=39.37, P&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference between NH, 

starved larvae (S6, S12 and S24), F6 and both fed/starved treatments (S12F12 and 

F12S12; post-hoc tests, P&gt;0.39). Additionally, total protease activity was similar for 

larvae in the S24, F6, F12, F24, S12F12 and F12S12 feeding treatments (post-hoc tests, 

P &gt;0.9). With time, a slight, however not statistically significant increase in total 

protease activity was observed either in constantly fed (F6, F12 and F24) or constantly 

starved (S6, S12 and S24) larvae.  

Results of statistical analysis of the specific protease and amylase activity was almost 

identical to per individual activity, indicating that soluble protein content was constant 

among most experimental treatments (Figure 1b and 2b).

4.5 Discussion 

In the present study, digestive enzyme activity was significantly affected by the 

feeding regime experienced by first stage N. norvegicus larvae. Amylase activity was 

significantly lower in first stage larvae experiencing food deprivation, either

continuously or semi-continuously (“mixed” treatments S12F12 and F12S12) than in 

the continuously fed treatments. As expected, these results confirm that 

carbohydrates are not the main energetic reserve fueling larval metabolism during 

periods of starvation. Additionally, the results of the S12F12 treatment indicated that 

larvae initially exposed to starvation do not recover amylase activity even after 

feeding, as those larvae exhibited significantly lower amylase activity than conspecifics 

continuously fed for 12 h. In this way, it is possible that the ingestion of carbohydrates 

by N. norvegicus immediately after hatching may be required to trigger “normal” 

amylase activity. If first stage larvae are exposed to a period of food deprivation, and 

consequently fail to trigger amylase activity, it is possible that those specimens will no 

longer be able to digest carbohydrates efficiently, at least on a short term basis. Since 

the present study only focused the first 24 h post-hatching, during which the first 

vertical larval migration is performed, further studies are needed to assess the long 

term effects of reduced amylase activity in developing larvae. Two outcomes are 

possible: 1) amylase activity will recover with long term sustained feeding or; 2) larvae 

will not be able to overcome the deleterious effects of early starvation and their 

survival will be negatively affected [as it is speculated that amylase may play other 

metabolic roles than simply catabolizing carbohydrates (Jones et al. 1997)]. The 

assumption of deleterious effects resulting from early larval starvation is supported by 

several works addressing other decapod species, on which first stage larvae are 

unable to successfully molt to the next larval stage if optimal feeding does not occur 

during the first 24-48 h (Calado et al. 2007a; Giménez 2002; Rotllant et al. 2010). 

Additionally, free carbohydrates, in the form of glucose, are known to play a critical 

role in energy metabolism, and carbohydrates are needed for the formation of the 

larval exoskeleton (Anger 2001). When larvae were continuously fed, there was a 

gradual increase over time in amylase activity. Results of the F12S12 treatment 

suggest that the carbohydrates are rapidly digested, as already recorded for the early 

larval stages of the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii (Ritar et al. 2003a). Indeed, at the 

end of that treatment, amylase activity dropped back to levels similar to those of 

starved larvae.  



Chapter 4 

99 

All fed larvae, including the ones in the mixed treatments (S12F12 and F12S12), had 

higher levels of protease activity than NH, S6 and S12. However, larvae starved for 24 

h exhibited levels of protease activity comparable to those observed for fed larvae. As 

larvae hatching at great depths are unlikely that to be able to feed abundantly before 

reaching the upper part of the water column (Yamaguchi et al. 2005), first stage N. 

norvegicus probably display some type of mechanisms that able them to cope with 

post-hatching short-term food deprivation. The present work revealed that protease is 

active immediately after hatching and that starved larvae display an increasing 

protease activity over time. High protease activity may enable N. norvegicus larvae to 

rapidly extract protein from food once it becomes available. This strategy is commonly 

exhibited by decapod larvae, as it allows them to maximize the energetic intake under 

scenarios of intermittent starvation caused by prey patchiness (Le Vay et al. 2001). In 

an oligotrophic environment, such as the deep sea, the ability of first stage decapods 

to rapidly and efficiently digest any available prey prior to their arrival to shallower 

waters would certainly be an advantageous trait. 

Specific enzyme activity recorded for larvae exposed to different feeding regimes was 

similar to total enzyme activity. In the S24 treatment, specific protease activity was 

lower than in the S12 treatment which might indicate that protein reserves start being 

used to endure food deprivation. Nevertheless, the lack of difference between specific 

and absolute activity results, indicate that protein reserves are not significantly 

depleted after 24 h of starvation and suggest that N. norvegicus larvae can survive 

over 24 h without any exogenous protein supply. In a previous study, the soluble 

protein content recorded for first stage N. norvegicus larvae from Mediterranean and 

Irish Sea populations (Rotllant et al. 2004) were between 2 to 3 times higher than that 

measured in the present study for Portuguese larvae. This is not surprising, as regional 

differences have already been observed in embryonic lipid and protein content in 

various decapods (Bas et al. 2007; Rosa et al. 2007a; Silva et al. 2009). Additionally, 

brood variability in yolk reserves may also play a decisive role in the ability of first 

stage larvae to endure starvation. Brood variability has already been documented for 

other nephropid lobsters, such as H. americanus (Anger et al. 1985; Pandian 1970b)

and H. gammarus (Moland et al. 2010; Wickins et al. 1995). A preliminary study 

addressing N. norvegicus also revealed significant within brood variability on the fatty 

acid profiles of developing embryos (Pochelon et al. 2009b). This finding, coupled with 

laboratorial observations of larvae from a single brood hatching over several 

consecutive days [as already reported for Homarus spp. (Pandian 1970b; Wickins et al. 

1995)], indicate that N. norvegicus larvae will probably also display variable energetic 

reserves at hatching. This aspect has not been investigated so far in N. norvegicus 

larvae and may be of paramount importance for the survival of first stage larvae 

during their first vertical migration from deep to shallower waters.  

In summary, first stage N. norvegicus larvae off the Coast of Portugal, hatching 

between 400 and 800 m deep, need to perform a vertical migration through the water 

column towards food rich upper layers. The urgency of this behavioral response to 

avoid the negative effects of starvation is emphasized by the relatively lower protein 

reserves present in studied larvae, when compared to Mediterranean and Irish Sea 

conspecifics. The present results indicated that, even though there seems to be a 

deleterious effect of starvation on amylase activity, at least on a short timescale, post-

hatching starvation does not seem to affect the onset of protease activity. If suitable 

preys are not ingested in 12-24 h post-hatching, larval protein reserves will start to be 

catabolized to fulfill energetic demands. Although lipase activity does not seem to be 

affected by post-hatching starvation in H. americanus (a shallow water nephropid 

lobster related to N. norvegicus) (Biesiot and Capuzzo 1990b), it has already been 

shown that several decapod larvae catabolize lipids during periods of food shortage 

[e.g.: the lobster Jasus edwardsii (Johnston et al. 2004; Ritar et al. 2003a), the 

anomuran crabs Lithodes santolla and Paralomis granulosa (Kattner et al. 2003) and 

penaeid shrimp (D'Abramo 1989)]. In this way, future studies should investigate if 

lipase activity during post hatching starvation in N. norvegicus follows the pattern 

identified for shallow water nephropid lobsters (no significant changes in lipase 

activity) or the one displayed by other decapod crustaceans (significant changes in 

lipase activity).

The long term consequences of suboptimal feeding immediately after hatching were 

not tested in the present study. Therefore, additional work is required to clarify if 

metamorphosis and post-settlement performance of N. norvegicus can be negatively 

affected by suboptimal feeding during the first vertical migration of larvae.

Vertical distribution of M.couchi larvae 

112 

5.1 Abstract 

Knowledge of larval distribution and abundance is of major value in predicting the 

location and size of a breeding population. In this study, vertical distribution of the 

larvae of a brachyuran crab, Monodaeus couchi, was assessed during two week-long 

campaigns conducted at the end of January 2006 and 2007 off the South Coast of 

Portugal. Larvae were collected by oblique plankton hauls with a Longhurst-Hardy 

Plankton Recorder (LHPR) from the surface to 300 m. Abundance and distribution of 

zoea I and II were correlated during both years. For all stages, abundance decreased 

with depth during the day while it increased with depth at night; the larvae thus 

displayed reverse diel vertical migration. Abundance of zoea I and II was correlated 

with chlorophyll a levels, whereas those of later stages where correlated with neither 

physical parameters (chlorophyll a, temperature or salinity), nor with each other. An 

ontogenic shift in vertical distribution explained the results; earlier zoeal stages 

remain in the food-rich upper water column while later stages migrate to the bottom 

for settlement. 

 

5.2 Introduction 

Describing the distribution, abundance and dispersal of larvae of deep-sea animals is a 

daunting task. The small sizes of the larvae and the very large volumes of ocean into 

which they may potentially disperse present difficult logistical and technical 

constraints (Tyler and Young 1999). In one of the most successful field studies of deep-

sea larval distribution, Mullineaux et al. (1995)used a MOCNESS system to sample a 

neutrally buoyant plume over the Juan de Fuca Ridge  Larvae of vent gastropods and 

bivalves attenuated very rapidly outside the plume, illustrating the difficulty of 

sampling highly dilute larvae in the deep sea.   

During two oceanographic cruises conducted off the south coast of Portugal in the 

winters of 2006 and 2007, we collected numerous larvae of the crab Monodaeus 

couchi. This brachyuran crab inhabits muddy substrata (Ingle 1983b) from England to 



Chapter 5 

113 

Angola and in the Mediterranean, over a bathymetric range extending from 60 to 

1300 m (Gonzalez-Gurriarán and Méndez G. 1985). It is commonly associated with 

mud volcanoes, carbonate chimneys and cold seeps in the Gulf of Cadiz region (Cunha, 

M. R., University of Aveiro, unpublished observations). In slope habitats of the 

southern Iberian Peninsula and of the Mediterranean Sea, the species co-occurs with 

the commercially important Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus (Gonzalez-Gurriarán 

and Méndez G. 1985; Maynou and Sardà 1997). Although not strictly a deep-sea 

species, it may provide a good model for the understanding some aspects of the larval 

ecology of deep-sea decapod crustaceans.  

So far, field evidence on the factors that regulate dispersal of decapod larvae have 

been mostly based on studies of estuarine and coastal species (DeVries et al. 1994; 

DiBacco et al. 2001; Epifanio and Garvine 2001; Rothlisberg et al. 1995) and much less 

on offshore sampling programs (e.g. dos Santos and Peliz 2005; Lindley 1986). These 

studies, which include laboratory studies, demonstrate a commonality of behaviors 

with respect to feeding, predator avoidance, swimming and vertical migration 

(reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005). Many life-cycle traits are phylogenetically 

conserved in deep-sea species (Eckelbarger and Watling 1995; Tyler and Young 1999; 

Tyler and Young 2003; Young 2003). Therefore, we would expect that at least some of 

the selective pressures and adaptations exhibited by larvae of shallow water decapods 

will also apply in general to deep-water species. Most decapod larvae are herbivores 

and/or carnivores (Anger 2001) and, therefore, must feed in surface layers. For deep-

sea crab larvae a migration towards the surface would necessitate considerable 

energetic investment because crab larvae are negatively buoyant (Queiroga and 

Blanton 2005). However, crab larvae are relatively strong swimmers capable of 

sustaining velocities on the order of 0.5 to 2.0 cm s
-1

 ((Chia et al. 1984; Mileikovsky 

1973), and could move over a vertical distance of 1000 m in a relatively short time.  

However, feeding in surface waters would expose them to a higher predation pressure 

than in the relatively protected environment of the deep-sea, and would require a 

return migration to deep waters at the end of planktonic life. Moreover, a distribution

in surface waters may also have considerable consequences for horizontal dispersal 

and for recruitment into appropriate habitats. 

Information on larval distributions is rare for deep-sea crabs. In this short note we 

describe the distribution, abundance and vertical migration of Monodaeus couchi 

larvae in the Gulf of Cadiz. We show that the whole larval series is found in surface 

waters around the high chlorophyll a layer, which is a level commonly associated with 

high food availability (Verity et al. 2002) and that later stages are found at increasingly 

greater depths. Finally, we describe evidence for a reverse diel migration that may be 

related to predator avoidance (Han and Straskraba 2001).  

 

5.3 Methods 

5.3.1 Field collection 

Plankton samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises conducted off the 

south coast of Portugal (Fig. 1a), one from January 29
th

 to February 5
th

 of 2006 (17 

locations; day: n=7, night: n=10; Fig. 1b) and the other from January 24
th

 to 31
st 

of 

2007 (9 locations; day: n=4, night: n=5; Fig. 1c). The sampling areas were located over 

the slope off the coast of Algarve, between Cape St. Maria and the Spanish border, 

over depths of 100 to 800 m (Fig. 1b, c). Samples were collected in oblique hauls with 

a Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) equipped with a 42 cm cone, 280 ?m 

mesh net and a flow meter. The water column was resolved into approximately 25 m 

depth strata, from the surface to 10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of 

300 m and 200 m in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2007, vertical profiles of 

temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a concentration and light intensity were measured 

with a Seabird SBE 9 plus CTD fitted with a Seapoint fluorometer and a Chelsea 

Instruments PAR sensor, which was deployed at each location immediately after 

collection of the plankton samples. Technical problems prevented the measurement 

of hydrological parameters in 2006. During both oceanographic cruises, the organisms 

sampled were fixed immediately in 4% buffered formaldehyde and brought to the 



Chapter 5 

115 

laboratory for taxonomic identification (Ingle 1983a). The larval series of M. couchi 

comprises 4 zoeae and 1 megalopae (Ingle 1983a). Since the number of megalopae 

was very low (only 1 larva caught in both years combined) this larval stage was not 

considered in the analysis. Abundances are reported as number of larvae per 100 m

.

5.3.2 Vertical distribution  

In order to examine diel variation in catch of M. couchi abundance were pooled into 

50 m intervals from the surface to 300 m or 200 m for 2006 and 2007, respectively. 

Due to the very low abundances of larvae caught in 2007 when compared to 2006, 

statistical tests were performed for each year separately. Zoea IV abundances were 

excluded from the analysis in 2007 because only one larva was caught that year. 

Abundances were classified according to time of the day (2 levels, day and night), 

larval stage (4 and 3 levels for 2006 and 2007, respectively) and depth (6 and 4 levels 

for 2006 and 2007, respectively) and differences were assessed using a 3-way 



Vertical distribution of M.couchi larvae 

116 

orthogonal PERMANOVA. All statistical tests were performed with Primer 6.1 with 

PERMANOVA add-on (Primer-E Ltd, Plymouth, UK). All PERMANOVAs used a type III 

sum of squares, 9999 permutations and permutation of residuals under a reduced 

model. Data were transformed [log(a+0.5)] before computation of the resemblance 

matrix using Euclidian distances. Whenever results were significant (P&lt;0.05) a post-

hoc comparison test was used. In order to further describe differences in depth 

distribution with respect to ontogenetic development, the mean depth of each stage 

was computed for each year using a weighted average accounting for differential 

larval abundances at each depth. 

5.3.3 Correlation between larval stage and environmental parameters 

To assess if there was a relationship among the distribution and abundance of larval 

stages in each year, we performed correlation analyses among abundances of the 

different stages. For these analyses, sampling sites with neither larval stage (double 

zeros) were excluded.  Because multiple comparisons were performed, the 

significance levels were adjusted using a sequential Bonferroni correction. 

Additionally, the correlation between larval abundance and environmental 

parameters (temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration) was assessed for 

2007. Due to the non-normality of the data, a non-parametric Spearman correlation 

test was performed in all cases.

5.4 Results 

5.4.1 Vertical distribution 

Overall the abundance of M. couchi was much higher in 2006 than in 2007. In 

addition, patches of larvae composed of different development stages were observed 

in 2006 (Fig. 2 marked * and #). As expected, larvae abundance decreased as stage 

increased. In 2006, a significant interaction among larval stage, phase of day and 

depth was detected (Pseudo F= 2.16, df= 15, p&lt;0.005; Figure 3). The abundance of 

zoea I during the day decreased with increasing depth, with higher catches at 0-50m 

and at 50-100 m (post-hoc tests, p&lt;0.048 in all comparisons). At these depths, 

abundances were higher during the day than at night (post-hoc tests, p&lt;0.004 in all 

comparisons). By contrast, zoea I abundance at night tended to increase with depth, 

but the differences were not statistically significant. In zoea II, abundances displayed a 

similar patterns as zoea I,  but the differences between day and night catches were 

significant only at 0-50m depth interval (post-hoc test, p&lt;0.028). Finally, zoea III and IV 

abundances also appeared to be higher during the day at the surface while at night 

abundances were higher below 100m. These results were however not significant, 

probably due to the very low numbers of zoea III and IV (overall abundances ± SE of 

0.0638 ± 0.0600 ind.?100m

and 0.0012 ± 0.00007 ind.?100m

for zoeae I, II, III and IV, respectively). In 

2007, abundances were significantly higher during the day than at night for all stages 

and depths (Pseudo F= 3.91, df= 1, p&lt;0.03; Figure 4). Those results must however be 

interpreted with caution since larval abundances were extremely low (overall 

abundances of 0.0327 ± 0.0151 ind.?100m

respectively) and most larvae of the later stages (93% abundance of ZIII and IV) were 

encountered during the day at a single sampling site. 

Finally, mean depth of larvae varied between years but overall the first stage was 

encountered at lower depth than later stages, with zoea IV average depth being the

deepest (average average depth of distribution for both years combined were 85.7, 

119.6, 109.7 and 129.5 m for zoeae I to IV).

Spearman correlation (rs) values between the concentrations of the different zoeal 

stages indicated that the abundance of zoeae I and II (rs=0.37), zoeae I and IV (rs= 

0.30), and zoeae II and IV (rs= 0.45) were correlated in 2006. In 2007 only the 

concentrations of zoeae I and II were correlated (rs= 0.75; all values significant at 

???????probability level after Bonferroni correction, in 2006 and 2007). The difference 

in the results between years might be explained by the scarcity of zoeae III and IV.

In 2007 chlorophyll a levels had subsurface maxima between 30 and 70 m, decreased 

rapidly to about 180 m to become constant below that depth (Fig. 5). Temperature 

also decreased with depth and there was a sharp drop in temperature between 120 

and 130 m indicative of a thermocline. The same pattern was observed for salinity, 

with a halocline located at the same depth range. Spearman correlations between 

environmental factors and the concentrations of larvae indicated that zoea I 

concentrations were positively correlated with chlorophyll a (rs= 0.27), salinity (rs=0.23) 

and temperature (rs= 0.24; all values significant at ???????probability level after 

Bonferroni correction). In contrast, concentrations of zoea II were only positively 

correlated with levels of chlorophyll a (rs= 0,24). Zoeae III and IV were not correlated 

with any measured parameter. Catches of zoea I and II were maximal when 

chlorophyll a was above 0.3 mg m

5.5 Discussion 

In this study, the coast off southern Portugal was sampled for two consecutive years. 

Overall, larval abundance of Monodaeus couchi in 2006 was higher than in 2007, all 

larval stages were found at depths above 300 m with the early stages concentrated in 

chlorophyll-rich layers, and the differences in abundance according to phase of day 

and depth indicate the occurrence of reverse diel vertical migration.  

The occurrence of Monodaeus couchi larvae in the surface layer indicates that larvae 

hatching from benthic females from the slope and mud volcanoes populations are

able to rapidly ascend to the surface, crossing the thermocline around 120 m, to feed 

in surface waters, as shown by the positive correlation between first stages and 

chlorophyll a. This migration to the surface is widespread among first stage crab zoeae 

and results from negative geotaxis and high barokinesis (Ott and Forward 1976; 

Schembri 1982; Sulkin 1973). Crab larvae are able to cross sharp picnoclynes during 

migration towards surface waters, and this has also been demonstrated in early zoeal 

stages of Geryon quinquedens (Kelly et al. 1982), another deep-water brachyuran. 

Average larval depth increased with larval stage, also in line with numerous reports 

showing a preponderance of positive geotaxis in older larvae (Sulkin 1973), especially 

at the transition to the megalopa stage that must settle to appropriate benthic 

habitats. In the case of M. couchi, megalopae will have to settle several hundred 

meters deeper on the seabed, which, together with the attrition of densities with age, 

would explain the absence of megalopae in our samples. 

In zooplankton, diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviors vary interspecifically (Han and 

Straskraba 2001). Species can undergo any of the three described types of migration 

or not migrate at all (Forward 1988): 1) nocturnal diel migration, the most common 

form where larvae rise to surface water during the night to feed and sink below the 

photic zone during the day, 2) reverse diel vertical migration where larvae rise to the 

surface during the day and sink to deeper water at night and 3) twilight migration 

where larvae undergo two upward migrations near sunset and sunrise. Even 

intraspecifically, DVM behavior might vary with time, location  (e.g. distance from 

coast) or environmental conditions such as fluctuations in predator or prey 

abundances or vertical stratification (Irigoien et al. 2004; Osgood and Frost 2004). In 

the present study, M. couchi was most abundant during the day in the top hundred 

meter of the water column, while at night abundance increased with depth. In the 

Algarve area M. couchi thus underwent reverse diel vertical migration which was most 

defined in the 2006 sampling period, probably due to the overall higher larval 

abundances observed.  



Chapter 5 

123 

In several studies, reverse DVM has been suggested as a defense against predators 

that also migrate vertically. As observed in various copepod species, when predators 

exhibit nocturnal DVM, their prey may undergo reverse DVM (Irigoien et al. 2004; 

Osgood and Frost 2004). This behavior has been associated with areas where the 

predators rely more on tactile stimuli than sight to capture prey, as is  the case for 

many invertebrate predators (e. g. chaetognaths and gelatinous zooplankton) which 

themselves are undergoing regular DVM as a way to escape fish predators (Tester et 

al. 2004).  Reverse DVM has also been observed in areas with lower abundances of 

predatory fish (Lagergren et al. 2008). Since shifts in composition and abundance of 

predator populations occur, the prey must be able to adjust their behavior accordingly 

and, therefore, temporal and geographical plasticity in DVM behavior of M. couchi 

larvae could exist in response to changing environmental conditions.  

The abundance of zoea I and II was found to be positively correlated with chlorophyll 

a levels. There are two mechanisms which might explain the correlation between the 

two factors. First, M. couchi larvae, their prey and phytoplankton might be passively 

aggregated together due to hydrodynamic processes.  Second,  larvae responding to 

physical or biological factors might actively swim to avoid unsuitable environments 

(Folt and Burns 1999). In contrast, zoeae III and IV abundances were not correlated 

with chlorophyll a, which is explained by the highly variable depth distribution as well 

as very low abundances of these stages. Those larger larvae might shift their diet to 

different, larger prey items that might be distributed more evenly in the water column 

resulting in the observed pattern.  

Our results indicate that newly hatched larvae of Monodaeus couchi, and probably of 

other open ocean benthic decapods, can migrate hundreds, if not thousands, of 

meters to the photic layers of the water column where food is more abundant. Late-

stage larvae were encountered deeper, initiating the return migration to the sea bed. 

Following the first ontogenetic migration to surface layers, diel vertical migration 

behavior of such species is relatively unknown. M. couchi was found to perform a

reverse migration within the top 300 m of the ocean, but variability might exist in 

DVM behavior depending on the species, location and environmental conditions.

Decapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal 

132 

6.1 Abstract 

Larval stage is critical in the crustacean life cycle as they often represent the only 

dispersal phase. Because of their reduced swimming ability, circulation pattern is the 

primary factor influencing dispersal. Knowing larval distribution and abundance is 

necessary to predict location and size of the breeding population. In this study, spatial 

distribution and abundance of the decapod larvae were assessed. Two week-long 

campaigns were conducted at the end of January in 2006 and 2007, respectively 

sampling 28 and 47 sites in three different regions off the South Coast of Portugal; the 

coast of Algarve, Sagres and Alentejo. Larvae were collected by oblique plankton hauls 

from the surface to 200-300 m. In addition to in situ measurements of environmental 

parameters, an oceanographic model was used to better understand the processes 

affecting larval dispersal. Both years, Monodaeus couchi was the most abundant 

species, followed by Goneplax rhomboides. However, coastal species such as 

Atelecyclus rotundatus, Pilumnus sp., Processa spp. and Philocheras spp. that 

dominate in the 2006 campaign, were almost completely absent in the 2007, more 

offshore, campaign. Offshore decapod composition off the Algarve coast was similar 

between years even though overall decapod catch in 2007 was much lower than in 

2006. Larval distribution and abundance varied between sampling area which is likely 

to be the result of differences in hydrographic conditions and adult distribution. 

Indeed, an upwelling event was occurring off the southwest coast of Portugal at the 

time of sampling, which separated the Northeastern part of Alentejo from the 

Southwestern part which had lower decapod abundances and diversity than it 

Northeastern counterpart. Additionally, the Northeastern part of the Alentejo area 

was dominated by the crabs Cancer spp., Carcinus maenas and Atelecyclus rotundatus 

which were completely absent from the Southwest. In the NE, the most abundant 

species were retained onshore while offshore transport occurred in zooplankton and 

to a lesser extent in some shelf species.

6.2 Introduction 

Larval dispersal and supply are recognized as fundamental mechanisms regulating the 

dynamics of marine populations (Caley and Carr 1996; Kritzer and Sale 2006) and 

therefore they are key to the management of fisheries resources, the understanding 

of the spread of invasive species, the design of marine protected areas and the 

assessment of climate-change effects (Levin 2006; Paulay and Meyer 2006). In benthic 

decapod crustaceans the larval phase is a critical stage as it often represents the 

principal agent of connectivity among local populations and the only period available 

for dispersal. Decapod larvae generally lack strong horizontal swimming abilities but 

are capable of regulating their position in the water column through vertical 

swimming. A large body of evidence (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005) shows 

that decapod larvae respond to environmental and internal stimuli to trigger or inhibit 

vertical swimming. Changes in depth distribution related to those cues will influence 

directly or indirectly growth, feeding, and mortality, settlement to benthic habitats 

and, ultimately, dispersal and transport. 

During the period from hatching to settlement, mortality is high and only larvae that 

remain in suitable environments will be able to thrive. General circulation pattern is 

the main primary factor influencing larval transport on a large spatial scale (&gt;1000 

km). Eddies, estuarine plumes or even upwelling event, affect larval distribution on 

smaller scales (e.g. Queiroga et al. 2007). Finally, on a short scale (&lt;100 m) larvae can 

regulate their position and respond to changes in the water properties such as light, 

temperature, salinity, hydrostatic pressure (Epifanio and Garvine 2001; Folt and Burns 

1999; Forward 1988), and biotic factors (e.g. phytoplankton abundance, predator and 

prey concentration), thus actively influencing their horizontal or vertical position. 

Concerning biotic factors, state of feeding influence vertical distribution and predation 

is one of the largest cause of mortality (McConaugha 1992). Presence of appropriate 

food items, not only in terms of size, catchability and energetic value, but also of good 

biochemical composition, will further promote or hinder successful development 

(Fuchs and Franks 2010). Additionally, variations in physical factors such as 



Decapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal 

134 

temperature and salinity will affect duration of the larval phase which could impact 

survival and successful settlement (Anger 2001).  

Because of the high diversity of habitats colonized by decapods, larval developmental 

strategies vary greatly. Benthic species inhabiting coastal and estuarine areas as 

adults, but which develop in the open ocean during the larval phase, possess 

mechanisms that allow them to concentrate inshore before settlement to appropriate 

adult habitat takes place (dos Santos et al. 2007; Morgan et al. 2009; Queiroga and 

Blanton 2005). In contrast, adults of offshore decapods can be either pelagic (e.g. 

Sergestids shrimps), benthopelagic (many Caridean shrimps) or benthic (many 

brachyuran and anomuran crabs, as well as lobsters). Post-larvae of offshore benthic 

decapods will often require settling in substrate suitable for juvenile and adult 

development and survival. In contrast, since in pelagic species the larval stage is not 

the only stage available for dispersal, it can be assumed that metamorphosis is 

independent of substrate conditions, being controlled only by physical factors and 

physiological state.  

In either case, circulation patterns will have a large impact on larval dispersal. Large 

scale circulation pattern generally have a marked seasonal pattern; however 

variations can be observed over the period of day to weeks. A good understanding of 

the hydrography of the sampling area is therefore critical to better understand larval 

distribution. Off the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, our area of study, ocean 

circulation has a marked seasonal pattern, related to atmospheric forcing and 

subjected to the influence of the large scale circulation (Azores Current Branch; 

reviewed by Peliz et al. 2005; Relvas et al. 2007). During summer, circulation along the 

South-West coast of Portugal (Alentejo coast, see Fig. 1) is characterized by upwelling 

and its associated southward flow that brings up colder water near the coast and 

transports surface waters offshore. Poleward flow is typically observed during winter, 

although upwelling events are frequently reported during this season (Relvas et al. 

2007). The waters that feed this poleward flow during winter have hydrographic 

characteristics (salty and warm) similar to those found in the Northern branches of the 



Chapter 6 

135 

Azores current. Southerly winds along the West coast further reinforce the poleward 

flow thus promoting coastward transport (Frouin et al. 1990). 

Surface circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz is cyclonic, with westward circulation in the 

Algarve region (Fig. 1) along the deeper slope (600 m to 1300 m depth) related to the 

Mediterranean Underflow (MU). The presence of a flow in the eastward direction 

(called Gulf of Cadiz Slope Current), centered above isobaths 200m and feeding the 

Mediterranean basin with Atlantic surface waters through the strait of Gibraltar (Fig. 

1), is also observed along the upper slope of the Algarve coast.  The mean circulation 

of the Gulf of Cadiz is studied in detail in Peliz et al. (2007). 

Despite the high number of studies investigating decapod larvae abundances in 

coastal areas (DiBacco et al. 2001; Queiroga et al. 2006; Storm and Pedersen 2003), 

such studies remain scarce in offshore areas and, more specifically, very little is known 

about decapod larvae abundances in offshore waters of the Iberian Peninsula (dos 

Santos and Peliz 2005)since most studies have focused on coastal areas, i.e. areas over 

the continental shelf with a bottom depth lower than 200 m (deCastro et al. 2003; dos 

Santos et al. 2008; Gonzalez-Gordillo and Rodriguez 2003; Paula 1987; Queiroga 

1996).  

The main objective of the present study was to obtain data on the composition, 

abundance and distribution of decapod crustacean larvae off the south Portuguese 

coast during winter of the years 2006 and 2007. Attention was focused on annual and 

regional differences and onshore-offshore contrasts. Due to the occurrence of an 

upwelling event off the SW coast of Portugal during the 2007 sampling period, we 

used an oceanographic numerical model to explain the formation of the upwelling 

front and provide an interpretation of the physical transport mechanisms that 

underlie larval distribution and drift in this area. The outputs of the model helped 

elucidate the mechanism generating the segregation of the assemblages in the 

Alentejo region in 2007 found on either side of the front. Stronger knowledge of 

variations in larval dispersal and the processes causing them will ultimately help us 

understand better how global changes might impact the lifecycle of decapod species.

In 2006, a total of 25 locations were sampled off the south coast of Algarve, between 

Cape St. Maria and the Spanish border (Fig. 1b). All locations in this region were 

sampled by oblique hauls using a Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) equipped 

with a 42 cm diameter cone, 280 ?m mesh net and a flow meter to sample 21 

locations (9 day, 12 night). The water column was resolved into approximately 25 m 

depth strata, from the surface to 10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of 

300 m at the deeper locations.  Due to technical problems with the LHPR, 4 additional 

locations (2 day, 2 night) were sampled with a Bongo net equipped with a 335 ?m 

mesh net and a flow meter from the surface to 200 m. Technical problems precluded 

the collection of hydrographic measurements during the 2006 cruise. 

Samples in 2007 were taken in 3 different regions (Fig. 1c). Again, due to technical 

problems, the sampling was partially made with a Bongo net in replacement of the 

LHPR. A total of 17 locations were sampled off the south coast of Algarve between 

Cape of St. Maria and the Spanish border, between January 24
th

 and 27
th

. From these, 

9 locations were sampled twice, at approximately 24 h intervals. The remaining 8 

were only sampled once. Overall, 14 samples were taken during the day and 10 at 

night. In this area, all locations were sampled with LHPR from the surface to 200 m. 

Sampling in this region differed from that conducted in 2006 because all locations 

sampled were off the shelf (bottom depth &gt;200m). In the second area, located off 

Cape of Sagres at the western tip of the Algarve coast, 9 locations were sampled 

twice, with 6 samples collected during the day and 12 at night, between January 27
th

 

and 29
th

. The 5 most coastal locations were on the continental shelf and will hereafter 

be referred to as “coastal” (bottom depth &amp;lt;200m). Finally 22 locations were sampled 

off the coast of Alentejo, 9 during the day and 13 at night, between January 29
th

 and 

31
st

. From those sampling sites, 4 were located on the continental shelf. Again due to 

technical problems affecting the LHPR, the Sagres and the Alentejo regions, (except 

for one location off of Sagres) were sampled with the Bongo net from the surface to 

10 m above the bottom, or to a maximum depth of 200 m. Overall, 29 samples were 

taken during the day and 35 during the night. For both oceanographic cruises, the 

organisms sampled were immediately fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and brought

to the laboratory for taxonomic identification. Decapod larvae were identified to the 

lowest taxonomic level possible and staged, according to dos Santos and Gonzalez-

Gordillo (2004) and dos Santos and Lindley (2001). Additionally, the zooplankton 

biovolume at each station was measured and used as a proxy for zooplankton 

biomass.  

In 2007, measurements of vertical distribution of temperature and salinity were made 

with a Seabird SBE 9 plus CTD, which was deployed at each location immediately after 

collection of the plankton samples. Concerning atmospheric forcing, the wind field for 

the Alentejo region was extracted from QuikSCAT for the month of January 2007 

(average between 9.5-9.0W and 37.25-37.75N). Data were extracted from CERSAT 

reanalysis data (IFREMER, France; cersat.ifremer.fr). 

6.3.2 Statistical analysis 

Bongo and LHPR nets have different efficiencies. Stehle et al (2007) demonstrated 

that estimates of concentrations produced from depth-integrated oblique hauls by 

the LHPR were up to 7 times higher, depending on taxa, than those obtained by the 

Bongo net. This effect seems to be related to escape from the slow-towed Bongo net. 

Therefore, in order to compare the abundance of Decapod larvae caught with the 

LHPR and the Bongo nets, the catch values of the latter were divided by a ratio 

estimator of 0.45, as was obtained for Decapod zoeae from both day and night 

samples of the coast of Portugal. This conversion factor was found to produce a 

maximum error of 37% within a 95% confidence level. Similarly, zooplankton 

biovolumes were adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.12, as obtained for total 

biomass. This conversion factor was found to produce a maximum error of 4% within a 

95% confidence level (Stehle et al. 2007).  This is a sub-optimal design because the 

correction factor may not account for taxa-specific differences in efficiency between 

the two nets. However, on average the actual error will be much less than 37% and, as 

the most abundant taxa have similar sizes, we might expect small differences in net 

efficiencies across taxa. Additionally, most of the decapod species sampled in the 

study by Stehle et al. (2007) were the same as collected in the present study. We 



Chapter 6 

139 

therefore believe that the use of this correcting factor to compare results obtained by 

the two nets is justified. In all samples, the number of individuals caught was 

expressed in number of larvae per 100 m
3
. 

In order to test for differences in decapod larvae species composition and abundance 

between years and sampling locations, three distinct analyses were performed with 

PRIMER (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research) 6.1 software 

equipped with PERMANOVA + 1.0. First, the differences between coastal and offshore 

location were evaluated for the 2006 samples in the Algarve. The separation between 

the coastal and offshore region was made following the 200 m isobath. Then, 

geographical differences were assessed using the 2007 data. In the case of the 

Alentejo sampling, between January 29
th

 and 31
st

 2007, direct inspection of 

hydrographic fields (salinity and temperature), indicated that two different water 

masses were present, separated by a front, visible in the salinity and temperature 

distribution (Fig. 4), and also inferred from the corresponding modeled fields 

described below (Fig. 6). As a result, this region was divided into two sub-regions, 

Northeast and Southwest that were separated by the front, and sampling sites were 

therefore classified into four groups in 2007, Algarve, Sagres, Alentejo Southwest and 

Alentejo Northeast (Fig. 1). Finally, inter-annual differences were assessed between 

the 2006 offshore sampling sites and the Algarve region of 2007. Additionally, the 

effect of the day/night cycle on decapod abundance was factored in each analysis. In 

all cases, data were square root transformed prior to analysis and a resemblance 

matrix was created using Bray-Curtis similarities. Significant differences were tested 

using PERMANOVA. In order to visualize similarities and dissimilarities of the data, a 

Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) was performed. The contribution of the main two 

axes was plotted and a vector overlay was added to indicate the strength of the 

relationship between each species and the PCO axes using Pearson correlation. Only 

species with a vector length greater than 0.5 were plotted.

6.3.3 Oceanographic model 

Inspection of the temperature and salinity fields obtained in the 2007 cruise indicated 

the occurrence of a pronounced frontal structure off the Alentejo coast (see Results). 

In order to elucidate the process originating the frontal structure, which takes place 

over an area much larger that the region sampled, as well as its influence on the 

observed larval distribution during the 2007 cruise, numerical model simulations of 

the ocean circulation were conducted using the primitive equation hydrostatic 

Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS; Shchepetkin and McWilliams 2003). The 

present configuration, represents an improvement and extension of those used by 

Peliz et al. (2007) and Oliveira et al (2009). In the scope of the present work, a 

summarized description is given for the present configuration. For full details about 

the model configuration the reader is referred to the above works. The main domain 

of the model includes the Western Iberian margin, from the Gulf of Cadiz (34.5 ºN) to 

the Bay of Biscay 45.5 ºN, and from 12.5 ºW to the Strait of Gibraltar 5.5 ºW. 

Boundary conditions were taken from a larger domain in such a way that it allowed 

solving the influence of the large-scale circulation (Azores current) on the main 

domain, as well as the influence of the Mediterranean outflow through Strait of 

Gibraltar. The model was run for the period 2001-2008 and was forced by the NCEP2 

air-sea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov), QuikScat reanalyzed satellite winds extracted 

from CERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr) and river input. 

 

6.4 Results 

6.4.1 Decapod larval composition and abundance in 2006 and 2007 

The list of decapod species or genera for which larvae were collected is given in Table 

1. From the 49 taxa sampled, 30 were encountered in both years, 7 in 2006 only and 

12 in 2007 only. Most taxa were present at low densities (&lt;0.05 ind 100m

). Overall, 

larval  abundance was much  higher  in  2006  than  in  2007  (Fig. 2a).  Abundance was

highest close to the coast. In 2007 high larval abundance was also encountered off the 

coast of Alentejo in the coastal side of the front (Fig. 1). In both years, brachyuran 

crabs were the most common group, representing 70% and 77% of total Decapoda 

abundance for 2006 and 2007, respectively. They were mainly Monodaeus couchi, 

Goneplax rhomboides, Pilumnus spp., Atelecyclus rotundatus and Liocarcinus spp. 

Consequently, brachyuran larvae were also highly abundant in 2006 close to the 

Guadiana and Mira rivers (Fig. 2b). The second most abundant group was the 

dendrobranchiata shrimps (13% and 18% total abundance, respectively) in which the 

most common species were Solenocera membranacea and Sergestes spp.. Their 

abundance was very low close to the coast and predominated in the Algarve as 

opposed to the Sagres and Alentejo regions (Fig. 2c). Hermit crabs represented 9% 

and 3% of total abundance in 2006 and 2007 respectively (Fig. 2d). The most common 

were Anapagurus spp. and Pagurus spp. (both years) and the squat lobster Munida 

spp. (in 2007). Finally, caridean shrimps made up 8% and 2% of total abundance in 

2006 and 2007 respectively (Fig. 2e), with Alpheus glaber, Processa spp. and 

Philocheras spp. being very abundant in 2006. In comparison, caridean shrimps 

abundance was very low in 2007. Their abundance was high only in the Northeast of 

the Algarve sampling area, which is influenced by the river Guadiana. Numbers were 

very low in the offshore sampling sites. The other groups (Gebiidea, Astacidea and 

Achelata) represented together less than 1% of the larvae collected in both years. In 

2007, biovolumes, representative of overall zooplankton abundance, were much 

higher offshore than onshore in the Alentejo area (Fig 2f).

6.4.2 Patterns of decapod larval distribution in the Algarve region in 2006 

Abundance of larvae in the Algarve region in 2006 was much higher in the coastal side 

of the front than offshore, mainly due to the high number of crabs and Caridean 

shrimp larvae encountered in coastal areas (Fig. 2a, b and e). A total of 9 taxa were 

found only over the shelf, 6 only offshore, and 20 both on the shelf and offshore 

(Table 1). Results of the PERMANOVA indicated that distribution and abundance 

varied between the coastal and offshore sampling sites in 2006 (p&lt;0.0001) but there 

was no statistically significant difference in larval distribution between day and night 

samples (p&gt;0.064). Coastal sites were dominated by larvae of the crabs Goneplax 

rhomboides, Pilumnus spp., Atelecyclus rotundatus, and Liocarcinus spp. and of the 

caridean shrimps Plesionika, spp., and Philocheras spp. In contrast, the most common 

species encountered offshore were Monodaeus couchi and Sergestes spp. (Fig. 3).

6.4.3 Regional patterns of decapod larval distribution in 2007 

Throughout the sampling area temperature and salinity were vertically homogeneous 

from the surface to about 130 m, where the start of a thermocline was found. 

Therefore, a reference depth of 50 m was chosen as representative of the 

temperature and salinity fields between the surface and 130 m (Fig. 4). The Algarve 

region, located in the Gulf of Cadiz, showed higher temperature (Fig. 4a) and salinity 

(Fig. 4b) values than the other zones in this surface layer. The Sagres region and the 

southwest part of the Alentejo region had similar temperature (Fig. 4a) and salinity 

(Fig. 4b) values. Colder and fresher waters were found in the northeast part of the 

Alentejo region (Fig. 4). 

 

Figure 6.4: Physical data: (a) Temperature (ºC), (b) salinity, pattern at 50 m depth in the three areas 
of sampling off the south coast of Portugal during the 2007 cruise. 

The temperature and salinity fields off Alentejo indicated the presence of two 

different water masses separated by a well defined frontal region aligned in the NW-

SE direction (Fig. 4). The presence of this front in the surface layer can also be 



Decapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal 

146 

recognized in satellite images extracted for the region (not shown) and by the 

clustering of the vertical profiles in two groups on the basis of the location of the 

sampling stations relative to the front above 150 m (Fig. 5), despite of a less clear 

segregation of profiles from stations within, and adjacent to, the front. A further 

distinction of the vertical profiles is that they showed a more clearly defined and 

stronger thermocline in the SW side of the front than in the NE (Fig. 5).  

 

Figure 6.5: Physical data: Vertical profiles for in situ measurement (top) and model predictions 
(bottom) for temperature (ºC), and salinity fields in the Alentejo sampling area during the 2007 
cruise. 

Northerly upwelling favorable winds were predominant during most of January 2007, 

reaching higher intensity during the period of 21th to 27th of January, preceding the 

sampling in the Alentejo coast that took place between January 29
th

 and 31
st

 (Fig. 6b). 

Therefore, the front separating the offshore warmer and saltier waters from the 

colder and fresher waters closer to the coast can be interpreted as resulting from this 

upwelling event. This interpretation is supported by the model results, which 

reproduce many of the observed hydrological features. The vertical profiles generated 



Chapter 6 

147 

by the model for each station also show a segregation of the water masses at the 

surface and a decrease in salinity and temperature closer to the coast caused by the 

upwelled water (Fig. 5), as well as a frontal structure clearly developed by the 28
th

 of 

January (Fig. 6a), although the predicted salinity values at the surface are lower than 

the ones recorded. The model also predicts some recirculation in the area with a 

northward flow offshore and a southward flow of coastal region (Fig. 6a, blue color in 

the temperature, salinity and velocity fields). This upwelling event may also be the 

cause for the clear difference observed in the zooplankton distribution between the 

two sides of the front, with much lower abundances observed inshore of the front 

(Fig. 2f). 

The presence of this front and of the different water masses motivated the separation 

of the Alentejo region into two sub-regions, the Northeast Alentejo and the Southwest 

Alentejo, when analyzing the regional patterns of larval abundance in 2007. In this 

year peak abundance occurred off the coast of Alentejo and in the Algarve region. The 

species present also differed between the zones. A total of 24 taxa were identified in 

the Algarve, 27 in Sagres, 22 in the Southwest Alentejo and 30 in the Northeast 

Alentejo (Table 1). Abundance and diversity of Dendrobranchiata were highest in the 

Algarve region but very low in all sampling sites of the three other areas, from where 

they were sometimes absent (Fig. 2c).  Results of the PERMANOVA indicated that 

there were no differences in the distribution and abundance in relation of the phase 

of the day (p=0.93). Larval composition differed between the regions sampled 

p=0.0014; Fig. 7). The Sagres and the southwest of Alentejo had similar species 

abundance and distribution (p=0.57), grouping together in the PCO plot, but the other 

areas were all different from each other (p&lt;0.04 in all pairwise comparisons). The 

(differences in species composition resided mainly in the composition of crabs as 

Monodaeus couchi and Goneplax rhomboides (Figure 8 and 9) that were most 

abundant in the Algarve, whereas Cancer spp., Carcinus maenas and Atelecyclus 

rotundatus (Figure 10, 11 and 12) distinguished the Northeast Alentejo from the other 

areas (Fig. 7). Moreover, the last three species were absent from the southeast 

Alentejo.

6.4.4 Inter-annual differences in decapod larval distribution in the Algarve 

region 

Results of PERMANOVA indicated that there was a significant difference in the species 

composition and abundance in the offshore area of the Algarve between the two 

years of sampling (p=0.0039; Fig. 14) but there was no difference in larval distribution 

between day and night samples (p=0.37). A total of 18 taxa were encountered both

156 

years, 9 were only found in 2006 and 8 only in 2007. The difference between the two 

years was explained by the high abundances of the crabs, Monodaeus couchi and 

Goneplax rhomboides, the Anomuran squat lobster Munida  spp. and the shrimp 

Solenocera membranacea in 2006 whereas in 2007 abundances of Sergia robusta was 

much higher than in 2006. Additionally, Pilumnus spp., which was encountered in high 

abundance in 2006, was completely absent the following year (Fig. 14).

6.5 Discussion 

Decapod distribution varied between years, distances from the coast and geographical 

area. Sampling sites located in coastal areas were dominated by estuarine species 

(e.g., Carcinus maenas, Nepinnotheres pinnotheres, Diogenes pugilator). Regardless of 



Chapter 6 

157 

areas or year of sampling, the composition and abundance of decapod larvae was 

independent from the phase of the day. Since samples were taken between the 

surface and a maximum of 300 m and integrate the entire water column, it can only 

be deduced that the larvae are remaining between these depths and that, even if 

vertical migration takes place, they do not migrate below that point. These results are 

not surprising, as the diel vertical migration performed by most species is 

encompassed within this depth range (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005, Table 

4) and suggest that the nocturnal vertical migration behavior that is generally depicted 

by decapods larvae in the ocean was restricted to this depth level.  

All taxa identified to species level can be categorized into two groups regarding the 

geographical distribution of adults (d’Udekem d’Acoz 1999; Manning and Holthuis 

1981; Zariquiey Alvarez 1968): i) species with known geographical limits located 

somewhere between Norway and Mauritania (e. g. Cancer spp., Nephrops norvegicus, 

Crangon crangon, Carcinus maenas and Polybius henslowii; ii) species with known 

geographical limits located somewhere between Norway and South Africa (e. g. 

Monodaeus couchii, Diogenes pugilator, Parapenaeus longirostris and Athanas 

nitescens). Some of the species in the second group have populations in the tropical 

West African coast, while others reached an anti-tropical distribution presumably by 

latitudinal submergence (Briggs 1974; Hedgepeth 1957).  All these species except C. 

maenas also occur in the Mediterranean. Taxa identified to genus level include 

species belonging to these two categories as well as tropical species. In neither case 

these genuses include only tropical species. Therefore, the larval assemblage found in 

the south and southwest coasts of Portugal during the two winters sampled can be 

considered as typical of the Lusitanian Province, Mediterranean-Atlantic Region, with 

some influence from more boreal species (Briggs 1974). 

For both years, the abundance of larvae was relatively low. Two factors may 

contribute to the relative paucity of the larvae. The first is a seasonal effect. Indeed, in 

a spring campaign over the Portuguese western shelf, larval abundances was one to 

two orders of magnitude higher that what was recorded in the present study (Table 2, 



Decapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal 

158 

dos Santos et al. 2008). Most species in the area reproduce primarily during the spring 

and summer months, and higher overall abundances are expected during this period. 

However, a previous study by dos Santos (1999) found that larvae of Carcinus maenas, 

Ebalia spp., and species from the sub-family Polybiinae (e.g. Liocarcinus spp., 

Macropipus spp., and Polybius henslowii) were primarily found during the winter, and 

occurrence of Gennadas elegans, Nephrops norvegicus and Palinurus elephas larvae 

was limited to winter months.  In this sense, decapod larvae composition in the 

winters of 2006 and 2007 was similar to that observed by dos Santos (1999). The 

second factor is that most sampling stations were located over the outer shelf and the 

slope. Therefore, sampling may have missed the large abundances of coastal and 

estuarine species that several studies have recorded over the inner shelf in eastern 

margins of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (dos Santos et al. 2008; Morgan et 

al. 2009; Queiroga 1996).  

During the 2006 campaign in the Algarve, differences in species composition were 

observed between coastal and offshore areas. The former was dominated by coastal 

caridean shrimps, while the latter was dominated by open ocean and deep sea species 

such as the shrimps Sergestes spp. and Solenocera membranacea and the brachyuran 

crab Monodaeus couchi. Species composition, both coastal and offshore, was similar 

to what has been previously observed in the Algarve under winter conditions (dos 

Santos 1999). Another important factor contrasting onshore with offshore waters was 

the presence of estuarine species associated with the river outflow. Abundance and 

diversity of the eastern part of the Algarve sampling region was highly influenced by 

the discharge from the Guadiana river. The most coastal sampling sites in that area 

was dominated by estuarine species which undergo part of the larval cycle offshore 

(e.g. Pilumnus spp., some Liocarcinus spp.).  

In 2007, decapod larvae composition was similar between the SW Alentejo and the 

Sagres regions, which differed from the Algarve and NE Alentejo regions. While the 

most abundant species in the Algarve were Monodaeus couchi and Goneplax 

rhomboides, the NE Alentejo was dominated by brachyuran crabs, namely Carcinus 



Chapter 6 

159 

maenas, Cancer spp. and Atelecyclus rotundatus and by the anomuran Anapagurus 

spp.. The latter four taxa, encountered in most sampling locations in the NE Alentejo, 

were completely absent offshore of the front. In addition, higher larval abundances 

were observed over the continental shelf (100-200m depth) indicating that larvae are 

probably being retained in this area in spite of the prolonged upwelling event that was 

observed. Indeed, the wind and hydrographic data of 2007, as well as the model 

interpretation, indicate that upwelling favorable winds originated the frontal structure 

off the Alentejo coast, separating the upwelled waters with northern origin from the 

offshore warmer and saltier waters with subtropical origin.  

The presence of coastal species in the NE Alentejo (Carcinus maenas, and Anapagurus 

spp.) greatly contributed to differentiate the assemblages across the front. Higher 

larval abundances observed in the most coastal sampling location over the shelf 

indicated that coastal species were retained onshore (Figure 12 and 13). Such 

retention during upwelling events has largely been documented (e.g.: dos Santos et al. 

2008; Morgan et al. 2009; Queiroga et al. 2007) and has been linked to different kinds 

of depth-regulation behavior. Nevertheless these are coastal species and our sampling 

design therefore does not permit a full comprehension of larval dispersal as higher 

abundances are expected onshore and not on the external part of the continental 

shelf where our sampling was performed. This is however not the case for species 

which adults commonly inhabit the external area of the continental shelf such as 

Cancer spp. and Atelecyclus spp.. The presence of adult populations over the shelf 

most likely resulted in supply of larvae to this general area. Offshore larval abundance 

of C. spp. and Atelecyclus spp. in the NE Alentejo region increased with stage (Figure 

10 and 11) indicating that a small portion of the larvae were not retained over the 

shelf but were carried beyond the shelf break by the upwelled waters.  

Because of coastal topography, recirculation occurs in the Lisbon and Setúbal bays, in 

the north of the Alentejo region, especially in response to upwelling-favorable winds 

(Moita et al. 2003). At a larger scale, the ocean of the southwest Iberian region is 

characterized by the presence of two water masses separated by a W-E frontal zone 



Decapod larvae distribution off the coast of Portugal

located between 38-39ºN (Peliz et al 2005). This frontal zone separates the colder and 

fresher waters of the subpolar branch of the Eastern North Atlantic Central Waters 

(ENACW) form warmer and saltier waters usually associated to the subtropical branch 

of the ENACW, which originates in the Azores region, and connects with the Gulf of 

Cadiz and the southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula through the northern 

branches of the Azores system of currents (Peliz et al 2007). Intrusions of these waters 

across the W-E front are frequently observed, and it has been hypothesized that these 

intrusions are associated with the northward deflections of branches of the Azores 

current in the vicinity of the Cape St. Vincent, in the Sagres region (Peliz et al. 2005). 

The model results reproduce to some extent these patterns, showing a coastal 

southward flow and a northward flow offshore over the sampling area, as well warm 

eddies derived from the Azores current further south and offshore (see Fig. 6). The 

northward flow of warm water west of the Alentejo predicted by the model between 

37.5 and 39.0
o 

N, which was deflected offshore by the upwelling event, may be a 

reflection of this. This interpretation is also supported by the observed hydrological 

fields that were very similar in the Sagres and the southwestern Alentejo areas. These 

mechanisms could underlie the similarity of the decapod larval assemblages of the SW 

Alentejo and of the Sagres regions (about 2/3 of the species were common to both 

areas), suggesting that the larvae present in the Sagres region were probably brought 

northward toward the southwestern part of Alentejo. Moreover, some input of larvae 

from northern areas such as the Lisbon bay might have impacted the decapod larval 

composition of the NE Alentejo. 

Zooplankton abundance (Fig. 2f) was higher in the SW Alentejo and in the Algarve 

than in the NE Alentejo, where very low levels were found in some stations. The low 

abundance of zooplankton in the NE Alentejo contrasts with the high abundance of 

decapod larvae in this region, especially in the more coastal sampling sites. This 

distribution of the zooplankton can be explained by the upwelling event assuming a 

supply of recently upwelled water with low biomass of phyto- and zooplankton. While 

distribution of holoplanktonic organisms depends exclusively on circulation patterns 

and water productivity, decapod larvae abundances depend on production from 



Chapter 6 

161 

benthic dwelling females, which may decouple the abundances of both planktonic 

groups. 

As currents highly influence larval distribution, time evolution of the circulation 

patterns might explain the differences observed in species composition of offshore 

species in the Algarve area between the two years of sampling. The main difference 

observed is the lower abundance of shrimp larvae caught in 2007. Indeed, excluding 

Sergia robusta, all other species caught in 2006 were only found at very low densities 

the following year (Table 1). Similarly, benthic species abundant in coastal waters in 

2006 were almost not encountered in 2007 such as the crabs Monodaeus couchi, 

Goneplax rhomboides and Pilumnus spp.. Those inter-annual differences may be due 

to various factors, including variations in current patterns, like presence of meddies, 

variations in adult reproduction time and larval duration.

7.1 Concluding Remarks 

Decapod crustaceans have evolved numerous mechanisms that optimize survival and 

growth throughout embryonic and larval development. During the early phases of the 

life cycle, the energetic demands are very high. Indeed, essential nutrients are 

required for proper organ development or successful metamorphosis. For this reasons, 

the period of suboptimal food conditions at any point of the life cycle can significantly 

affect the subsequent stages such as larvae and post-settled individuals. Since 

embryonic development is lecithotrophic and food might not be readily available 

immediately following birth, it can be assumed that the feeding status of females 

during vitellogenesis will influence offspring survival (Giménez 2006, 2010; Pechenik 

2006). As inter-specific variability in fatty acid (FA) profiles are the results of different 

ecological niche and feeding regimes (Rosa et al. 2007a), it is likely that differences in 

habitat or inter-annual variations in food conditions can result in within-brood 

variations in embryonic biochemistry. The results of chapter 2 further indicate that 

there is also, at least in Nephrops norvegicus, a high variability in FA composition 

between embryos of a single clutch. This differential female investment into the 

embryos and/or differential catabolism of yolk reserves by the embryo can explain why 

in the laboratory there is great within-clutch variability in larval survival. Suboptimal 

post hatching environmental conditions will further affect developing larvae (reviewed 

by Giménez 2006) and those that had lower energetic embryonic input may not be 

able to successfully reach the following larval stage, even though short term survival to 

suboptimal food conditions can still be possible (e.g.: Calado et al. 2010; Gebauer et al. 

1999; Giménez and Anger 2003, 2005; Ritar et al. 2003b; Smith et al. 2004).  

Regardless of the quality of maternal investment, and because of the unpredictable 

nature of the open ocean, larvae demonstrate significant plasticity in prey preference, 

feeding on lower size and nutritional quality prey when adequate ones are absent 

(chapter 3). This shift in diet will also be accompanied by physiological adaptations, 

such as an increase in digestive enzymes activity (like protease activity increase in 

starved first-stage N. norvegicus larvae; chapter 4). Additionally, an increase in gut 

evacuation time (GET) can also be expected as it has been observed in many decapod 

species (Jones et al. 1997). Both an increase of enzyme activity and GET will allow 



Concluding remarks 

170 

larvae to maximize nutrient assimilation in suboptimal food conditions (Kumlu 1999). 

Once food conditions recover, prey quality and quantity being adequate again, feeding 

rate will increase in order to recover from a starvation period, such as it is observed in 

stage I and II of N. norvegicus in chapter 3. However, if starvation occurs over an 

extended period of time, and the larvae will not be able to recover and successful 

development will not occur (Anger and Dawirs 1981). Indeed, extended period of 

starvation leads to damages to the hepatopancreatic cells and prevents the 

accumulation of lipids regardless of the quantity and quality of available food (Anger 

2001). The larvae will not be able to metamorphose to the next stage and death will 

eventually occur (Anger 2001). As observed with amylase activity in starved newly 

hatched N. norvegicus, sustained starvation can result in a failure to trigger specific 

digestive enzymes, which could translate into a deficiency in nutrients essential to 

successful development and molting to the next larval stage. Since carbohydrates play 

an important role in the molting process (Luo et al. 2008), a failure to activate amylase 

activity before reaching the end of larval stages, would probably negatively impact 

metamorphosis (chapter 3). 

In addition to food condition, predation pressure will also affect larval survival 

throughout development. In order to avoid predation, one possible strategy is to 

perform a different type of DVM than their predators (Han and Straskraba 2001; 

Pearre 2003). Monodaeus couchi represents a good example of such species, as they 

were observed to perform reverse diel vertical migration off the coast of Portugal in 

2006 and 2007 (chapter 5). Such behavior however will also translate into lower prey 

availability to the organism performing that uncommon type of migration (Irigoien et 

al. 2004). Nevertheless, depending on the feeding strategy, if female nutrient input 

into the yolk reserves is sufficient, the resistance to starvation will increase and the 

larvae can develop successfully in an environment with lower predation pressure. 

Nevertheless, unless the species is fully lecithotrophic, larvae will have to feed 

eventually, and as larval size increases, prey preference will tend to shift towards 

larger prey (as observed in N. norvegicus in chapter 3) and possibly to more energetic 

food items.  



Chapter 7 

171 

Regardless of the vertical migration strategy, the positioning in the water column as 

well as survival will eventually influence dispersal and recruitment as larvae will be 

transported by depth varying currents (reviewed by Queiroga and Blanton 2005). 

Global circulation patterns will dictate general trends in larval transport but short term 

variations in environmental conditions, such as changes in atmospheric conditions, will 

result in temporal difference in local larval composition and abundance. The low 

numbers in larval abundances observed in chapter 5 and 6 can be explained by the 

time of sampling (winter) combined, in the case of the Alentejo region, with the small 

size of the shelf in that area. Indeed, dos Santos and Peliz (2005) indicated that very 

few N. norvegicus larvae were encountered in the region despite the large adult 

population and similar results were observed for M. couchi. Modeling studies indicated 

that only a small proportion of larvae hatching in the Algarve are likely to reach the 

Alentejo region. Marta-Almeida et al. (2008) modeled the potential dispersal of N. 

norvegicus larvae off the coast of Algarve during the winter based on the estimated 

area of the adult populations and different vertical migration behavior scenarios of the 

larvae. Since no difference in decapod abundance is observed between day and night 

samples (chapter 5) and M. couchi exhibited reverse DVM between the surface and 

200 m (chapter 6), it can be assumed that DVM behavior of decapods larvae of the 

Portuguese coast during the winter are comparable to either the DVM200 (diel vertical 

migration up to 200 m) or U200 (uniformly distributed in the top 200m) simulations of 

the model (Marta-Almeida et al. 2008). For both type of behaviors, the results 

indicated that most of the larvae hatching in the Algarve were retained in that area, 

close to the coast, in the area where decapod abundance was highest in our samples. 

Indeed, according to the model, very few larvae are transported towards the coast of 

Alentejo. This could explain the lower decapod larvae abundance encountered in that 

area in chapter 5, especially if the adult populations are reduced in this area due to the 

small width of the shelf. Those results are consistent with dos Santos and Peliz (2005) 

where N. norvegicus larvae were not observed in the Alentejo region despite the 

presence of an important population on the slope. Similarly, in our study, N. 

norvegicus larvae were only collected in the Algarve. 



Concluding remarks 

172 

Unpredictable events can either transport larval to a new habitat to colonize, or export 

it to an environment where settlement and therefore survival will not be possible. 

Such a case is illustrated by the upwelling event that was occurring off the coast of 

Alentejo in the winter of 2007, causing the area to be divided by a front. Larval 

composition on each side of the front is clearly different, with a retention occurring for 

coastal species in the NE area (chapter 6). The presence of adult populations over the 

shelf most likely resulted in constant supply of larvae in the area, explaining the higher 

larval abundances in the most coastal locations of our sampling plan. Interestingly, the 

NE part of the Alentejo, influenced by upwelled chlorophyll poor waters, show lower 

zooplankton abundance. Indeed, the higher offshore abundance of zooplankton in the 

SW Alentejo, is not consistent with the higher decapod larvae abundances observed in 

the NE Alentejo.  Differences in life cycle, in the benthic and localized origin of the 

larvae contrasting with the largely unbounded production processes of holopkantonic 

organisms, as well as in behavior, most likely explain the observed differences.  

 

7.2 Future works 

The two species used in the present work are good models to better understand the 

early life biology of deep-sea species and the evolution of adaptations to deep-sea 

habitats. Both species occupy a range of depths from shallow shelf habitats to 

hundreds of meters (more than 1000 m in the case of M. couchi). M. couchi is a fairly 

widespread species and its larvae are encountered at high densities at some places, 

but the remoteness of the deeper adult habitats and the lack of commercial interest 

have translated into little knowledge of its biology. In contrast, N. norvegicus is a much 

better studied species, especially in northern latitudes where adults inhabit shallower 

waters. Its high commercial value facilitates the acquisition of benthic juveniles and 

adults from the fisheries. On the other hand, the decrease in population size as a result 

of overfishing, combined with low reproductive output and a wide offshore 

distribution, result in low number of larvae present in the plankton off the Portuguese 

coast and therefore hindered the study of its planktonic phase. In fact, during both 

oceanographic campaigns of 2006 and 2007 only 4 larvae of N. norvegicus were

encountered each year (see Table 6.1). These abundances are much lower than those 

encountered previously by dos Santos and Peliz (2005). In their study, reporting data 

collected between 1987 and 2001, annual variations in larval abundance were 

observed, with a slight overall decrease over time. This reduction in larval abundance 

is however negligible when compared with abundances recorded in our study, which 

were about two orders of magnitude lower than those recorded by dos Santos and 

Peliz (2005). Despite the variety of sampling techniques used in both this study and 

Santos and Peliz (2005) it is evident that the reproductive output of this population has 

decreased as net differences alone cannot account for the observed decrease.  

For this reasons, and as performed in the present thesis, further works intending to 

increase the knowledge of offshore benthic decapods should therefore focus a variety 

of species. Different species could therefore be used to serve as models to answer 

specific questions. For instance, a better understanding of oocyte production and 

maternal investment could be obtained from commercially harvested larger species, 

while laboratorial studies could focus on smaller species with shorter embryonic 

development and higher reproductive output. Studying ovigerous females maturating 

in the field and in the laboratory may help us to better understand vitellogenesis and 

how the feeding status of the female influences nutrient allocation into produced 

embryos. In addition to maternal investment, variations in environmental conditions 

within the brooding chamber (e.g.: oxygen concentration, temperature, salinity, etc.) 

will cause variations in embryonic metabolism, resulting in differential use of yolk 

reserves (Brante et al. 2003), and eventually leading to asynchronous larval hatching 

(Eriksson et al. 2006; Fernandez et al. 2003). The exact cause of inter-individual and 

within-brood variability in embryonic biochemistry, as well as the resulting effect on 

larval development and survival, still requires further investigation.  

Most larval behaviors, either endo- or exogenously cued, are extremely difficult to 

study in situ. In the present thesis, laboratorial hatching of N. norvegicus proved to be 

difficult and culture of this species to juvenile stage was unsuccessful. Most works on 

this subject date back in the 70’s and 80’s (e.g.: Anger and Puschel 1986; Figueiredo 

and Vilela 1972) and to date larviculture of this species is still in its experimental phase. 

Hatching and culturing healthy larvae in the laboratory is therefore needed. Potential 



Concluding remarks

reasons for this failure include 1) the stress induced to females during capture and 

transport, 2) unsuitable nutritional quality of the prey provided (Artemia sp. nauplii) or 

3) the morphology of the larvae itself, which possess large spinous processes along 

their body that are prone to injury upon contact with the walls of the culture chamber, 

causing potential infections. While optimizing the culture of N. norvegicus, an 

economically important species, is critical, more suitable candidates species, with 

higher reproductive output, should be selected to get a better global understanding of 

larval behavior of offshore benthic decapods. Laboratorial studies should investigate 

the responses of different larval stages to changing environmental conditions, mainly 

temperature, pressure and light, but also food availability. Long term effect of food 

deprivation or ingestion of suboptimal prey, as well as inter-individual variability, still 

requires further studies. In that sense, the use of biochemical tools allowing the 

evaluation of the physiological mechanisms and energetic state of reproducing 

females, embryos or larva (in some cases even at the individual level) holds many 

promises. Nevertheless, a full understanding of the processes regulating inter-

individual and within-brood variability in biochemical profiles of embryos and larvae is 

needed, especially considering the ever-growing importance of the use of biomarkers 

in the study of populations (Dalsgaard et al. 2003).  

A full understanding of the early life traits of offshore benthic decapods will therefore 

only be achieved through a multi-disciplinary approach including: 1) field sampling and 

oceanographic modeling to understand general larval behavior and dispersal, 2) small 

scale laboratory experiments to test individual larval responses, development and 

survival to changing environmental conditions; and 3) biochemical analyses to 

understand physiological adaptations of both embryos and larvae. Because of the 

carry-over effect in response to suboptimal environmental conditions that was 

observed in many decapod larvae, a holistic approach in the study of early life biology 

(starting at the embryo and finishing with juveniles) is advocated. Indeed, like it is the 

case in this thesis, until recently, many studies focus on a single life phase, if not a 

single stage, when repercussions of suboptimal conditions often significantly affect the 

individual later in life.
