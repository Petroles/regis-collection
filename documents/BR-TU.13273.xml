Os últimos quatro anos foram, sem dúvida, os mais desafiantes que já 
vivi. No entanto, não vivi esta aventura sozinha. Na verdade, só consegui 
finalizar este projecto porque pude contar com a ajuda, o 
companheirismo e a boa-vontade de muita gente, alguns dos quais 
passarei a nomear a seguir. Começando pelo início da história, tenho de 
agradecer em primeiro lugar à pessoa que me deu esta oportunidade, o 
Professor Amadeu Soares, que se viria a tornar meu orientador, 
acompanhando e amparando-me durante estes loucos 4 anos. Gostaria 
igualmente de agradecer ao meu co-orientador, o Professor Guarino Colli 
que, depois de tantas dificuldades foi um dos poucos que permaneceu ao 
meu lado neste projecto.  

Os dois anos que passei no Brasil foram recheados de descobertas 
entusiasmantes e momentos inesquecíveis, mas também de inúmeras 
frustrações. Em cada momento, dos melhores aos piores, tive a bênção 
de nunca me encontrar só, apesar dos 5000km que me separavam da 
família e dos amigos. Isto porque no Brasil encontrei uma outra família, 
formada por pessoas que sempre me acarinharam e ampararam para 
que conseguisse terminar o meu trabalho de campo. Devo um 
agradecimento francamente especial ao Rafael Batista de Mendonça, e a 
toda a sua família, que prontamente me acolheram como sua, tornando 
tudo suportável. Sem o vosso apoio não teria com certeza resistido a 
tanto, e este projecto seguramente não se teria concretizado. Um 
“obrigado” nunca traduzirá o sentimento de gratidão que tenho para com 
vocês. Devo um agradecimento particularmente ternurento ao Sr. Emídio, 
que rapidamente se tornou um pai para mim e que, desde então, nunca 
deixou de estar presente nos meus pensamentos. Um obrigada cheio de 
saudade também para o pessoal da Ecológica, ao Divaldo Rezende e à 
sua mãe, à Marly e, em especial ao Yuri, o meu menino! Devo também 
um agradecimento às minhas companheiras na fase inicial desta 
aventura: um muito obrigada às outras doutoretes, Carolina Lima e Paula 
Matos! Outro agradecimento aos outros companheiros iniciais de 
aventura, ao pessoal do Croque, e em especial à Haiany, à Milene e ao 
Avanilson! Um obrigada também ao Enzo e à Elisete, que me acolheram 
como muito mais do que apenas uma inquilina. E, por fim, a toda a gente 
da Fazenda Praia Alta, em especial ao Sr. Elói e à Nitty, que me 
ajudaram e sem os quais não teria conseguido fazer o meu trabalho de 
campo.  

 
 
 
	
 



 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

agradecimentos (continuação) Não posso deixar de agradecer aos meus companheiros de 4 patas que 
tantas horas de alegria, ócio e também desespero passaram ao meu 
lado; ao Logan, que tantas vezes esgotou a minha paciência, para por 
fim deixar em mim uma saudade quase tão grande quanto o próprio 
Brasil; à Bogotá, que será sempre a minha menina felina, e ao Defi, por 
representar de uma forma tão graciosa que nem tudo neste planeta tem 
de ter um propósito!  

Não seria quem sou, e com certeza nunca teria terminado este projeto 
sem o apoio da minha família e amigos. Obrigada especialmente à 
minha mãe e à minha avó, por carregarem no peito todas as esperanças 
e preocupações do mundo. Ao meu avô que, apesar de “já ter partido”, 
continua tão presente como sempre, em mim. Ao meu pai, pelo carinho 
expresso ao procurar sempre “aligeirar” mesmo as situações mais 
dramáticas! Àqueles que, com a sua “loucura”, me permitiram manter a 
sanidade durante as piores tormentas: à Sílvia Rocha, ao David Gato, ao 
Ricardo Rocha, à Sara Silva, ao Rashid, ao Daniel Gomes, ao Nuno 
Tavares, ao Adérito Vieira, ao Luís Santos, à Patrícia, ao Tó e até à 
Cecília, que nasceu entretanto!  

Por fim, o mais profundo agradecimento ao meu companheiro de vida - a 
ti, Pedro Alves, que apareceste ao fim de 30 anos, obrigada por dares 
sentido a tudo, por fazeres com que tudo valha a pena, e por me 
ensinares o que é o amor.

Anfíbios, agricultura, características biológicas, diversidade funcional, 
diversidade filogenética.  
 
 
 
 
Atividades antrópicas como a agricultura e a pecuária são as principais 
causas da perda de biodiversidade. A expansão agrícola é especialmente 
nociva nos trópicos, onde o investimento agrícola responde a importantes 
demandas sociais e económicas, e a biodiversidade é especialmente alta 
e única. O arroz é a cultura alimentar mais importante do mundo. Dada a 
sua natureza, localização e extensão a nível global, os campos de arroz 
irrigado são invariavelmente utilizado pela fauna nativas. Determinar 
como as comunidades que vivem nesses agroecossistemas são 
afectadas é, portanto, de extrema importância. O Cerrado, a maior e mais 
diversa savana do planeta, encontra-se sob extrema pressão 
antropogénica, com 50% do bioma atualmente sob uso humano direto. 
Os anfíbios estão entre os vertebrados mais ameaçados do planeta, 
desempenhando papéis de destaque no funcionamento dos 
ecossistemas. Como o seu ciclo de vida é particularmente complexo, 
investigar a forma como as populações de anfíbios são afectadas por 
atividades antropogénicas requer uma abordagem integrada e 
multidimensional, a várias escalas. ? Com este projecto pretendeu-se 
avaliar a forma como a comunidade de anuros do Cerrado está a ser 
afetada pela pressão agrícola, avaliando o risco de extinção, analisando 
os traits selecionados, e a variação na diversidade taxonómica, 
filogenética e funcional em diferentes escalas, bem como a conectividade 
funcional dos anuros em culturas de arroz. Determinou-se que o risco de 
extinção de risco oficial dos anfíbios do Cerrado se encontra 
subestimado. O local de reprodução, habitat e tamanho da postura são 
preditores de elevado risco de extinção em anuros. O sudoeste e região 
central do bioma são as principais regiões de espécies de alto risco de 
extinção, e devem ser priorizados para a conservação. Concluiu-se 
também que a conversão do habitat e a gestão agrícola causaram 
profundas alterações na comunidade de anuros, com o aumento da 
divergência funcional e dramática perda de diversidade funcional e 
filogenética em ambientes agrícolas. Anuros com distribuição restrita, 
especialização de habitat, posturas pequenas e grande tamanho corporal 
foram excluídos dos ambientes agrícolas. Adicionalmente, anuros 
provenientes de culturas apresentaram menor condição corporal. Assim, 
a conversão de vegetação natural em plantações de arroz irrigado resulta 
na extinção local de muitas espécies, independentemente da sua 
especialização, e no decréscimo dos índices de condição corporal nas 
espécies mais resistentes. ?A presença de abundantes fragmentos 
florestais e de corpos de água é determinante para a manutenção de 
níveis elevados de diversidade funcional e filogenética, e ainda para 
assegurar a conectividade funcional para as populações de anuros em 
paisagens agrícolas.

Amphibians, agriculture, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, traits.  
 

 

Anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and cattle farming are the 
main causes of biodiversity loss. Agricultural expansion is especially 
detrimental in the tropics, where agricultural investment meets important 
social and economic demands, and biodiversity is especially high and 
unique. Rice is the world’s most important food crop. Given its nature, 
location and extension worldwide, irrigated rice fields are invariably used 
by the native fauna. Determining how communities living in these 
agroecosystems are shaped is therefore of the utmost concern. The 
Cerrado, the world’s largest and most diverse savanna is experiencing 
extreme anthropogenic pressure, with 50% of the biome currently under 
direct human use. ?Amphibians are among the world’s most threatened 
vertebrates, playing keystone roles in ecosystem functioning. Given the 
inherent complexity of their life cycle, approaching how amphibian 
populations are affected by anthropogenic activities requires an 
integrated, multidimensional approach, at multiple scales. This project 
sought to assess how the anuran community of the Cerrado is being 
affected by agricultural pressure, assessing the extinction risk, analyzing 
the selected traits, and variation in taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional 
diversity at different scales, as well as the functional connectivity of frogs 
in rice crops. The official extinction risk is underestimated for the anurans 
of the Cerrado. Breeding site, habitat specialization, and clutch size are 
predictors of increased extinction risk. The southwest and central regions 
of the biome are the main hotspots of increased extinction risk, and 
should be prioritized for conservation. Habitat conversion and crop 
management caused profound changes to the anuran community, 
causing increased functional divergence and dramatic loss of functional 
and phylogenetic diversity in agricultural environments. Anurans with 
restricted range, habitat specialization, small clutches and large body size 
were excluded from agricultural environments. Additionally, frogs from 
agricultural environments had lower body condition. Thus, the conversion 
of natural vegetation to rice crops results in such environmental stress, 
that large subsets of species are driven to local extinction irrespective of 
their specialization, and even the more resilient species exhibit lower 
body condition. The presence of abundant forest fragments and water 
bodies is crucial for the maintenance of high levels of functional and 
phylogenetic diversity, and also to ensure functional connectivity for 
anuran populations in agricultural landscapes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Worldwide biodiversity crisis 
 Biodiversity is currently facing a worldwide decline under increasing anthropogenic 
pressure (Barnosky et al., 2011). According to Ceballos et al., (2015) the average rate of 

vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate, 

revealing an impending sixth mass extinction.  

 Biodiversity loss, caused by disturbances such as species overexploitation, habitat loss, 

climate change, or invasive species (Brook et al., 2008; Dunn et al., 2009), compromises the 

sustainability of ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services (Cardinale et al., 

2012).  

 Agriculture represents the largest landuse, occupiyng ca. 38 % of the world’s terrestrial 

surface (Foley et al., 2011). The impacts agriculture has on biodiversity are varied and 

complex, occurring at both habitat and landscape level (Weyland et al., 2012)  

 Global pressure to further increase food production in coming decades will be 

enormous, as the world population is projected to approach 11 billion by the end of this 

century, with the population of Africa nearly quadrupling (United Nations, 2013). In fact, the 

global extent of cropland is currently expanding faster than at any time in the past 50 years 

(Grassini et al., 2008). Future expansion of agriculture will be especially detrimental for 

tropical ecosystems (Dobrovolski et al., 2011; Laurance et al., 2014). The greatest agricultural 

expansion will occur in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa (Bruinsma, 2009; World 

Bank, 2009), which have large areas with unexplored agricultural potential. These include 

rainforests, such as the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as vast semi-arid biomes, such as 

the Cerrado South America or the Miombo and Guinea savanna-woodlands of Africa. Beyond 

feeding the growing populace and eliminating hunger, rising incomes in many developing 

nations will result in increased demand for meat and dairy products, bioenergy production and 

bio-feedstocks for industry (Fargione et al., 2012; Scharlemann and Laurance, 2008). These 

needs will inevitably be met by expanding agricultural systems stressed by climate change 

(Nelson et al., 2009).

Tropical ecosystems sustain much of the Earth’s biological diversity (Myers et al., 

2000), provide countless natural products and services to human communities (Grimes et al., 

1994) and play key roles in the global carbon and hydrological cycles (Avissar and Werth, 

2005; Fearnside, 2000). Unfortunately, many tropical ecosystems are being disrupted by large-

scale land-use change and other environmental alterations (Laurance et al., 2014), facilitated 

by by improved crop and soil management practices that support higher yields. Furthermore, 

road construction and improving medical technologies are allowing humans to colonize areas 

once plagued by diseases (Hotez et al., 2009). 

 Expanding agriculture could be particularly detrimental for biodiversity hotspots, 

terrestrial biogeographic regions that sustain exceptional species richness and endemism and 

have suffered severe loss of their original vegetation (Mittermeier et al., 2004; Myers et al., 

2000). Tropical and subtropical ecosystems predominate in over half of the hotspots 

(Mittermeier et al., 2004). In addition to their many known species, hotspots are believed to 

contain most of the Earth’s undescribed species, many predicted to be restricted endemics 

(Joppa et al., 2011; Scheffers et al., 2012) and unlikely to survive in disturbed environments 

(Giam et al., 2012). Unfortunatelly, hotspots have highly dense and rapidly growing human 

populations (Cincotta et al., 2000), often struck by extreme poverty (Fisher and Christopher, 

2007) and with low development scores (Jha and Bawa, 2006). Hotspot countries with the 

highest population growth rates and lowest human development had the greatest deforestation 

rates (Jha and Bawa, 2006). Demands to increase food production, promote economic growth, 

and exploit natural resources could inflict high environmental costs on hotspot nations.  

 Many tropical landscapes are nowadays composed of crops, plantations, and 

secondary, logged, and fragmented forests. Relative to intact forest, biodiversity is reduced in 

all modified tropical forests (Gibson et al., 2011), although to the smallest degree in 

selectively logged forests (Edwards et al., 2011; Putz et al., 2012). Biodiversity can be 

moderate in some mixed-cropping and agroforestry systems (Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010), 

but is typically much reduced in plantation monocultures (Barlow et al., 2007; Fitzherbert et 

al., 2008; Ziegler et al., 2009). Mosaics of disturbed and secondary habitats can provide 

important habitat and foraging sites for forest species, as well as stepping stones and corridors 

for biotic dispersal and animal migration (Barlow et al., 2007; Chazdon et al., 2009; Pereira 



General Introduction 

	

17	

and Daily, 2006; Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010). Such mosaics can also be managed in some 

cases to benefit agriculture by promoting natural ecosystem services such as pest control and 

pollination (Boreux et al., 2013). The natural values of intensively managed farmlands and 

pastures are typically much lower than those of structurally more complex environments, such 

as logged and secondary forests, mixed plantings, and well-managed agroforestry systems 

(Edwards et al., 2011; Perfecto and Vandermeer, 2010). 

 Given the massive anthropogenic pressure on tropical biomes, protected areas are the 

core of conservation efforts in these regions. Approximately 6.6% of all tropical and 

subtropical forests are now in strictly protected areas (Jenkins and Joppa, 2009). However, 

protection of drier tropical habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, is lower, 

with 5.9% in strictly protected areas and 12.5% in all reserve categories (Jenkins and Joppa, 

2009). Although the network of tropical protected-areas has dramatically improved in the last 

25 years, it is still inadequate because many threatened and locally endemic species fall 

entirely outside of protected areas (Rodrigues et al., 2004). In addition, many reserves are 

imperiled by illegal encroachment, logging, hunting (Curran et al., 2004; DeFries et al., 2005; 

Harrison, 2011; Laurance et al., 2012). Reserves are thus becoming geographicly isolated and, 

as their surrounding habitats become increasingly modified, reserves and their biodiversity 

will become increasingly imperiled. 

Understanding the factors behind biodiversity loss is among the main issues in 

ecology, and absolutely pivotal for decelerating the current species extinction rate. However, 

the complexity and importance of this issue has not been met by the metrics used, e.g. species 

richness. An important component of biodiversity loss that succedes or even precedes species 

extinctions is the elimination of ecological interactions in which those species are engaged 

(Aizen et al., 2012; Tylianakis et al., 2008). As many key functional aspects of ecosystems 

depend on biotic interactions, their loss may have pervasive effects, accelerating species local 

extinction, impairing ecosystem functions, and ultimately collapsing the derived services 

provided to humans (Díaz et al., 2013).  

The collapse of biological interactions and their associated ecological functions may 

frequently precede the complete disappearance of species, i.e., when a species’ abundance is 

so reduced as to represent its functional extinction (Säterberg et al., 2013; Wilkie et al., 2011). 



Chapter 1 

	

18	

Biotic interactions are thus a major but often neglected component of biodiversity that needs 

to be considered in order to assess the ‘health’ of ecosystems and define critical indicators 

providing early diagnosis of environmental problems (Aizen et al., 2012; Dirzo et al., 2014; 

Tylianakis et al., 2008). 

 However pessimistic most predictions may appear, recent estimates of extinction risk 

from a wide range of ecosystems indicate that real empirical data often exceed predicted 

extinctions (Maclean and Wilson, 2011). Hence, we are still far from having adequate tools to 

predict species loss attributable to major anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss (He 

and Hubbell, 2011). In a research field still dominated by species richness as the diversity 

metric (Cardinale et al., 2012), adequate assessment of biodiversity loss and consequent 

effects on ecosystem functions and services may be impaired, ultimately compromising the 

effectiveness of every resultant management and conservation plan. Thus, there is an urgent 

need to quantify and predict the effects of disturbance on biodiversity patterns to guide 

conservation efforts and the management of ecological resources. 

 

1.2. The value of ecophysiological traits in ecology 
Analyses of past and projected extinctions have revealed highly non-random patterns 

in extinction risk (Anderson et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2011b; Olden et al., 2007; Thuiller et 

al., 2011; Tingley et al., 2013). Thus, not all species are equally at risk of extinction. A 

species’ vulnerability to extinction depends on extrinsic threats such as habitat loss or invasive 

species, and on its intrinsic ability to respond to such threats (Cardillo et al., 2005; Collen et 

al., 2011; Murray et al., 2014). A species’ response to threats is largely mediated by its traits, 

specific characteristics, related to physiological, morphological, and life-history features 

inherent to the organism and measurable at the individual level (Violle et al., 2007).  

According to the habitat template theory of Southwood, (1977), the habitat provides 

the template on which evolution shapes characteristic life-history strategies through natural 

selection. Consequently, major environmental drivers influence the fitness of the species in a 

consistent manner, depending on the traits they possess, resulting in species sorting (McGill et 

al., 2006; Southwood, 1977; Webb et al., 2010). The interaction between traits and 



General Introduction 

	

19	

environmental conditions is known as environmental filtering (e.g., Webb et al., 2010) a 

concept describing how traits are filtered in the regional species pool to yield the final trait 

composition, species composition and relative abundance in the community (Fig. 1.1). 

However, natural selection and species sorting do not operate at the level of single traits, but 

on whole organisms carrying multiple traits. Consequently, species performance will be a 

function of combinations of traits that synergistically present an adaptive response to the 

environment (Verberk et al., 2013, 2008). 

Given the determinant role traits have on community composition, the ability to predict 

which species are more prone to go extinct - a major goal of conservation biology - can be 

achieved through trait-based approaches. While classic taxon-based approaches compare 

species assemblages (e.g., taxonomic composition, species richness, abundance measures) and 

relate them to differences in environmental conditions (Hawkins et al., 2010; Lancaster et al., 

2009), trait-based approaches focus on the species’ attributes that determine its ability to deal 

with environmental changes. Compared to taxon-based, trait-based approaches have i) 

improved mechanistic understanding of species–environment relationships (Kearney and 

Porter, 2009) and, consequently, ii) greater generality of such relationships because of 

applicability across regions.  

The use of species traits in ecology is rapidly expanding (Doledec and Statzner, 2010; 

Menezes et al., 2010; Vandewalle et al., 2010), showing great potential for transforming 

descriptive field studies into a predictive science of community ecology. However, trait-based 

approaches are yet to deliver on this promise.

1.2.1. Predicting extinction risk 
The IUCN Red List is arguably the most useful list of species extinction risk and has 

been used to raise awareness about threatened species, guide conservation efforts and funding 

and set priorities for protection (Baillie et al., 2008; Mace et al., 2008; Martín-López et al., 

2011; Rodrigues et al., 2006). The Red List classifies species into different risk categories 

according to a set of quantitative criteria assumed to translate extinction risk, such as 

population range, population size, decline and/or spatial fragmentation (IUCN, 2001). Species

understanding the differences in species assemblages resulting from abiotic and biotic 
conditions. Trait-based approaches are based on the notion that the habitat acts as a templet that 
mechanistically explains how major environmental drivers influence the fitness of the species, 
depending on the combination of traits they possess.

are classified as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) and Vulnerable (VU) or, if 

threat criteria are not met, as Least Concern (LC). If available data are insuficient to determine 

conservation status, species are categorized as Data Deficient (DD). Hence, a species 

categorized as threatened can have stable populations and be listed because of other factors 

assumed to raise the extinction risk, such as a limited number of subpopulations.  

Despite the unquestionable value of this system for conservation, there is an increasing 

awareness that many extinctions go unnoticed because they occur within small, strongly 

neglected organisms (e.g., Cardoso et al., 2010; Dunn et al., 2009; Régnier et al., 2009; 

Triantis et al., 2010). Worldwide conservation efforts have mostly relied on a few emblematic 

groups, because monitoring populations of rare, inconspicuous or unpopular species living in 

unaccesible or largely unsampled areas is a challenging process and would hardly be funded. 

Although Red List criteria are meant to be applicable to the majority of described species, 

several logistic constraints and intrinsic human preferences have produced a deep bias 

(Domínguez Lozano et al., 2007). While almost all of the mammalian and avian species have 

been evaluated, ca. 24% of amphibians remain DD and only 0.5% of the described arthropod 

species worldwide have been evaluated (IUCN, 2015). This portraits the Red List as heavily 

biased towards large species with wide distribution ranges and high dispersal abilities (i.e., 

those that are easily sampled), disregarding small species with narrow distribution ranges and 

low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet’s biota, particularly 

local endemics. Hence, the most threatened species may be systematically excluded.  

The Red List criteria are difficult to apply using the information available for many 

species (Kozlowski, 2008) because of four main shortfalls (Cardoso et al., 2011): (1) many 

species are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (2) the distributions of described species are 

largely unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (3) species’ abundances and their changes in space 

and time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); and (4) species’ ecology and sensitivity to 

habitat changes are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall). These four shortfalls stem 

from the fact that basic taxonomy and natural history research is scarce and underfunded. Poor 

basic knowledge impairs reliable extinction risk attribution. However, even if the required 

information could be gathered, the current criteria may not be appropriate for many species. 

Thus, further frameworks should be used complementary to the Red List in order to

thorouhgly assess extinction risk and guide conservation practice. 

Some life-history traits are related to colonization ability and extinction risk, which 

means that traits may be used as surrogates for extinction risk when population data are scarce 

(Fagan et al., 2001; Henle et al., 2004). Fagan et al., (2001) were able to predict the general 

extinction vulnerability of 60 out of 72 mammals simply by knowing body size, age at first 

reproduction, and average number of offspring. Worldwide, the extinction vulnerability of bat 

species was correlated with small geographic ranges and low wing aspect ratios (Jones et al., 

2003). Declining amphibian species in Central America had large body sizes, restricted 

elevational ranges and aquatic habitats (Lips et al., 2003). Other factors, including clutch size, 

body size and ecological niche, have also been identified as potentially important (Hero et al., 

2005; Lips et al., 2003; Stuart et al., 2004; Williams and Hero, 1998). In fact, small 

geographical range size has been consistently identified as the most important predisposing 

factor to decline (Cooper et al., 2008; Gaston and Fuller, 2009; Murray and Hose, 2005). 

Despite particular traits predisposing species or groups of species to decline, external 

factors must be considered (Cardillo et al., 2008; Davies et al., 2006). The effects of a threat 

can be expected to vary spatially and across species because unique suites of traits respond 

differently to a disturbance (e.g. habitat specialists are particularly vulnerable to habitat 

destruction (Norris and Harper, 2004)). This results in complex, context-dependent and/or 

indirect pathways to decline (Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2009). Murray et 

al., (2011a) for example, show that the spatial distribution of chytridiomycosis is a better 

correlate of decline than range size in Australian frogs, while Bielby et al., (2008) showed that 

the intrinsic traits of infected species correlate with whether they have suffered rapid declines 

or not as a result of infection. Given the diversity of known threats and the array of ecological 

and life-history traits that predispose species to decline, untangling the complex interactions 

that result in specific pathways to decline or extinction is a challenging task (Bielby et al., 

2009, 2008; Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002; Davidson et al., 2009) but one that is important 

for predicting further declines and, more importantly, improving our ability to do something 

about them (Wilson et al., 2007). For these reasons, it has been recently stressed that 

considering both intrinsic traits and extrinsic threats together is pivotal for thoroughly 

assessing extinction risk (Cardillo et al., 2008). 



General Introduction

1.2.2. Community response to disturbances 
 Data on species composition only provides context and bioregion-specific information, 

and metrics such as richness or diversity do not translate ecological functions (Vandewalle et 

al. 2010). Furthermore, our limited knowledge of population dynamics, physiological 

tolerances, ecological constraints, or long-term and indirect effects can impair our ability to 

investigate ecological ramifications of biodiversity loss.  

 Ecophysiological and behavioral traits are consistent among populations of the same 

species, are easily access than demography data, and are associated with various 

environmental variables of interest (Cane et al., 2006; Devictor et al., 2008). For example, 

traits such as body size, determine the spatial scale at which the organisms perceive their 

environment and control access to resources of various kinds (mineral nutrients, prey items, 

nest sites, pollinators, e.g.,(Larsen et al., 2005; Petchey and Gaston, 2006a)  affecting species 

turnover among habitats, along environmental gradients or between regions (Mason et al., 

2007). Hence, incorporating widely-available information about species traits and looking for 

consistent responses within groups that share traits would allow predictions of general patterns 

that could be applied to a range of related taxa and provide a mechanistic link between 

disturbances and patterns of response within communities (Mouillot et al., 2013a; Williams et 

al., 2010).  

 This approach would also be fruitful for devising management plans when land 

managers and stakeholders face decisions associated with landscape or global changes and 

how these might impact communities or particular species of conservation concern. 

Furthermore, if the traits that determine species response to environmental change or 

disturbance are positively correlated to those that determine functional importance, then 

functional trait composition and overall ecosystem function may also change dramatically 

(Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). In fact, measures of the functional traits within a community 

have been shown to be better predictors of ecosystem processes than species diversity metrics 

(Flynn et al., 2011; Naeem et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2015). Quantifying and predicting 

functional community structure within a context of increasing disturbance is thus required to 



Chapter 1

anticipate the potential loss of ecosystem services that is indisputably associated with 

biodiversity erosion (Cardinale et al., 2012). 

 Specifically, in anthropogenic habitats, assemblages may be filtered by species 

dispersal ability, with dispersal being one of the most important traits for assemblage recovery 

after disturbance in both vertebrates and plants (Kyle and Leishman, 2009; Moretti and Legg, 

2009). However, disturbed ecosystems have also been found to select for smaller and more 

fecund species, while larger slow-growing species are better suited to stable habitats (Chiu and 

Kuo, 2012; Statzner and Bêche, 2010). Disturbance and eventual recovery also affect 

vegetation structure, microclimate, environmental stressors such as aridity, and resource 

spectra such as soil fauna or plant seeds, with implications for other functional traits (Entling 

et al., 2007; Schirmel and Buchholz, 2011). Therefore, trait responses to disturbance are 

complex and may be mediated by multiple environmental effects in addition to filters of 

dispersal ability. 

 In recent years, trait analyses have been used for evaluating ecosystem health, 

especially for certain organisms, such as macroinvertebrates, which have been viewed as a 

promising biomonitoring tool to assess human impacts on freshwater habitats (e.g. Doledec 

and Statzner, 2010; Culp et al., 2011). 

 

1.2.3. Ecosystem services and resilience 
 The loss of biodiversity due to anthropogenic activity can have profound impacts on 

the functional properties of ecosystems and the services they provide (Naeem et al., 2012). 

Recent emphasis on ecosystem services for attributing value to ecosystems and promote their 

sustainable use (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) has drawn attention to the ways in 

which different organisms contribute to the delivery of ecosystem services (Díaz et al., 2007; 

Luck et al., 2012; Suding et al., 2008). However, our ability to assess how ecosystem services 

are affected by anthropogenic activities is still incipient. 

  

Disentangling how ecosystems provide multiple services consists first in allocating 

relevant ecosystem properties to each service, and identifying which organisms, or groups of 

organisms, control these properties (Kremen, 2005). Afterwards, it is necessary to discern the 



General Introduction 

	

25	

key characteristics and mechanisms by which these organisms affect ecosystem properties 

(Hooper et al., 2005; Luck et al., 2012). Species functional traits influence ecosystem 

functioning directly by mediating changes in biotic controls (e.g., predation or competition) 

and indirectly through responses to changes in local environment (e.g., microclimates or 

disturbance regimes) (Chapin et al., 2000). This is being approached in an increasing number 

of studies, such as those identifying the functional roles of pollinators (Kremen et al., 2007), 

particular plant groups as nitrogen fixers (Spehn et al., 2002), soil or sediment engineers 

(Boyero et al., 2007) and different faunal groups (Heemsbergen et al., 2004). Such studies 

have identified functional traits as the key factors by which species (Díaz et al., 2007; Hooper 

et al., 2005; Luck et al., 2012) influence ecosystem properties, mostly structural plant traits 

(e.g. plant growth form, tissue chemistry, leaf morphology, canopy size and architecture), 

microbial ecophysiological traits and behavioural animal traits (feeding habit, substrate type, 

nesting activity, mobility, environmental and temporal niche). Hence, quantificatying the kind, 

range, and relative abundance of functional traits in biotic communities can greatly contribute 

to ecosystem service assessment and management (Díaz et al., 2007; Petchey and Gaston, 

2006b).  

 Functional trait diversity, rather than the diversity of species per se, is the dimension of 

biodiversity most directly related to ecosystem functioning (Cadotte, 2013). Variation in 

functional trait diversity and composition due to land management can be a strong driver of 

ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services (Fig. 1.1).  

 Understanding the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem services is especially 

crucial for predicting how changes in environment and management practices will impact the 

multiple ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems (Kremen and Miles, 2012; Power, 

2010). Wood et al., (2015) state that a trait-based approach to agriculture that is analogous to 

that applied in broader ecology (e.g., Cadotte et al., 2011; de Bello et al., 2010; Violle et al., 

2007) could help better identify the mechanisms underlying the role of agrobiodiversity in 

providing agroecosystem services. Biodiversity loss is known to affect not only ecosystem 

functioning but also crop yield (Daily, 1997). For example, landscape intensification may

et al., 2002), crop pollination (Kremen et al., 2007; Ricketts et al., 2004) and resistance to 

plant invasion (Levine et al., 2004; Zavaleta and Hulvey, 2004).  

 As species differ in their potential contribution to ecosystem services, increasing 

biodiversity enhances the probability that a species that strongly enhances ecosystem 

functioning is present. Hence, the functional identity of one or few species dominating 

ecosystem processes becomes important. Sampling effects have been shown to be important in 

experiments with sown grasslands where the random inclusion of particularly productive 

species contributed to overall productivity (in addition to complementarity effects, Loreau and 

Hector, 2001). The chance of including a particularly effective species in a given environment 

appears to increase with the number of species in the available pool. Species redundancy 

means that a positive relation between diversity and functioning holds only for few species 

and additional species do not increase function, but plateau at higher diversity levels. 

However, redundancy is important because only high-diversity systems with redundancy in 

functional groups can be expected to provide the capacity for reorganization after disturbance. 

High diversity of functional groups may allow reorganizations after disturbances (Bengtsson 

et al., 2005), due to a high number of insurance species (the insurance hypothesis of 

biodiversity, Loreau et al., 2003). Surplus or redundant species may become even more 

important in an ever-changing environment, as formulated by the hypothesis of spatiotemporal 

insurance by biodiversity. In unpredictable human-dominated landscapes, diverse 

communities support species that may become important as soon as others disappear. 

Economically, this is an option value for the future. For example, Perfecto et al. (2004) found 

that high tree richness in coffee agroforestry supports a diverse bird community that turned out 

to increase predation on lepidopterans. Hence, these diverse coffee landscapes appeared to 

provide an important function with the prevention of potential pest outbreaks. The many 

solitary bee species on highland coffee are more effective pollinators than the few, but 

abundant, social species, thereby contributing to the positive relation of fruit set to bee 

diversity (Klein et al., 2003). This mechanism is similar to that of the collective role of rare 

plant species providing resistance to a grassland invader (Lyons and Schwartz, 2001). 

Removal of many rare plant species, but not removal of the same biomass of common species, 

enhanced invasion success of Lolium multiflorum (see also Levine et al., 2004). In such cases

many rare species may turn out to be more important for ecosystem functioning than few 

abundant species. 

 

1.3. Functional &amp;amp; Phylogenetic diversity 
Preventing dramatic and global loss of biodiversity, along with its consequences for 

ecosystem services is still possible through intensified and integrated conservation efforts. 

Thorough and effective magament and conservation plans are therefore urgent and can only be 

achieved if reliable ways to monitor biodiversity and accurately assess how land use 

intensification might affect ecosystem services have been developed (Mace and Baillie, 2007).  

Classical biodiversity measurements such as species richness have relied on three main 

assumptions: (i) all species are equal (only relative abundances establish the relative 

importance of species), (ii) all individuals are equal (whatever their size) and (iii) species 

abundances have been correctly assessed with appropriate tools and in similar units 

(Magurran, 2004). However, species not only offer a wide range attributes, they are also likely 

to support many goods and services through ecosystem processes (e.g. Díaz et al., 2007). 

Hence, the first assumption of biodiversity measurement is not valid: some species carry more 

evolutionary history or functional traits essential to ecosystem processes than others (Cadotte 

and Davies, 2010; Mouillot et al., 2013b). This consensus has resulted in a growing focus on 

the diversity and values of functional traits that influence ecosystem functioning, as a tool for 

explaining the role of organisms in ecosystems and the ecological impacts of their loss 

(Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). Nonetheless, most studies addressing community assembly in 

human-modified landscapes rely on simplistic taxonomic metrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich, 2010) 

and leave important ecosystem-level  

 

consequences unaddressed. Because the complex effects of environmental variation induced 

by human activities on species is ultimately mediated by specific characteristics (e.g. 

physiological constraints, habitat requirements, dispersal abilities), considering only 

taxonomic metrics may fail to provide accurate conclusions on the real consequences of 

anthropization on biodiversity. To attain more representative conclusions on the effects human 

activities have on communities, we must go beyond species number and account for different 



Chapter 1

components of biodiversity.  

Functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) are estimates of biodiversity based on 

ecological functions and evolutionary histories of species, respectively. FD describes the 

variability in ecological attributes among species and expresses ecosystem resistance, 

resilience and functioning (Petchey and Gaston, 2006a). Use of the term “functional diversity” 

has grown exponentially over the last decades (Petchey and Gaston, 2006a) and the concept of 

functional diversity is gaining a place of general importance in ecological research (Naeem, 

2002). Measuring functional diversity is equivalent to measuring functional trait diversity, 

where functional traits are components of an organism’s phenotype that influence ecosystem 

processes. There is an increasing body of literature demonstrating that functional diversity, 

rather than species diversity, enhances ecosystem functions such as productivity (Hooper and 

Dukes, 2004; Hooper et al., 2005; Petchey et al., 2004; Tilman et al., 1997), resilience to 

perturbations or invasion (Bellwood et al., 2004), and regulation in the flux of matter 

(Waldbusser et al., 2004). As functional diversity consists of the range and values of key 

morphological and physiological traits, communities with high numbers of species but low 

functional diversity can be said to have high functional redundancy (Petchey et al., 2007). This 

is because high functional redundancy occurs when species overlap in their traits, which may 

reflect niche overlap if traits are defined in a biologically appropriate way (D??az and Cabido, 

2001). Conversely, when each species present in a community represents a unique 

combination of traits, there is low functional redundancy. The most critical assumption in this 

formulation of functional redundancy is that the traits under consideration are those 

determining ecosystem functioning (Walker et al., 1999). High functional redundancy may 

result in limited loss of ecosystem functioning with species loss, while in communities with 

low functional redundancy, the loss of even a few species could have dramatic consequences 

for ecosystem functioning. According to Villéger et al., (2008), FD can be divided into three 

primary components – functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv) and functional 

evenness (FEve). FRic represents the amount of functional space occupied by a species 

assemblage. FEve corresponds to how regularly species abundances are distributed in the 

functional space. Finally, FDiv defines how far high species abundances are from the center of 

the functional space. These facets are complementary and jointly describe the distribution of 



General Introduction 

	

29	

species and their abundances within the functional space.  

An important consideration for such a trait-based approach is to identify which 

functional traits and which species are relevant (Suding et al., 2008). Response traits are 

important because they indicate how species respond to environmental change, whereas effect 

traits are important because they indicate how species affect ecosystem processes (Lavorel and 

Garnier, 2002). Not all species are of equal importance for ecosystem processes; as dominant 

species make up the bulk of the community biomass, they will also be responsible for most of 

the ecosystem fluxes in energy and resources (Garnier et al., 2004). 

PD measures the evolutionary differences among species based on times since 

divergence from a common ancestor (Faith, 1992), representing an estimate of 

phylogenetically conserved ecological and phenotypic differences among species (Cavender-

Bares et al. 2009). This dimension may characterize the long-term evolutionary potential of 

specific clades to respond or adapt to current and future environments. Few studies have 

explored the influences of anthropic landscapes on FD or PD (Tscharntke et al., 2012), and 

most of which have focused on plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodríguez et 

al. 2012; Aviron et al. 2005; Laliberte et al. 2010). 

 FD and PD were both advocated as two important facets of diversity respectively for 

ensuring the provision of goods and services (Díaz et al., 2007) and for representing an 

evolutionary history of conservation interest (Knapp et al., 2008; Mace et al., 2003). Metrics 

other than traditional diversity indices may thus be necessary to picture the actual trends. For 

example, a net increase in regional species richness may be accompanied by a decrease in 

functional diversity (Villéger et al., 2010), or two communities of equal TD may be composed 

of species with either highly similar or different phylogenetic histories (Forest et al., 2007). 

Similarly, any estimated measure of FD can also be decoupled from PD if some functional 

traits are under strong stabilizing selection or owing to competitive interactions within 

lineages (Prinzing et al., 2008). Taken together, the use of a multifaceted approach to describe 

the spatial distribution of biodiversity has recently proved to be useful for describing how 

biodiversity covaries in space, unravelling assembly mechanisms (Cadotte, 2013) and 

understanding the drivers explaining community composition (e.g. Bernard-Verdier et al., 

2013; Graham et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Pavoine et al., 2009). Measuring each of these 



Chapter 1

complementary biodiversity components is thus necessary for understanding the complete 

structure, composition and dynamics of natural communities (Maherali and Klironomos, 

2007). Adopting an integrated view of biodiversity is also a great challenge for conservation 

planning.  

Functional indicators can also greatly improve predicting the functions or services 

provided by an ecosystem as they are proxies for the rate, or relative importance, of particular 

processes (Vandewalle et al., 2010). If the traits that determine species response to 

environmental change or disturbance positively correlate with those that determine functional 

importance, then functional trait composition and overall ecosystem function may also change 

dramatically (Petchey and Gaston, 2006b). However, this concept is yet a neglected 

component in biodiversity monitoring programmes in most ecosystems (Feld et al., 2009).  

 

1.4. The Cerrado 
 Brazil harbors outstanding biodiversity, sharing with Indonesia the top two positions of 

the world’s “Megadiverse” countries (Mittermeier et al., 2000). However, not all Brazilian 

biomes have merited equal attention. While the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest have merited 

global recognition, the Cerrado has remained forgotten by scientists, environmentalists and 

general public, facing an increasingly threatening anthropic pressure. 

The Cerrado is located in the center of Brazil, bordered by the Amazon forest to the 

north, the Atlantic forest to the south and southeast, and the caatinga to the northeast (Fig. 

1.2). The 2nd largest biome of South America, this tropical savanna stretches for about 1, 

500,000 km2. Because of its wide latitudinal and altitudinal ranges, has great climatic and 

environmental diversity, encompassing considerable habitat heterogeneity. Ecological factors 

have acted in synergy to shape the native vegetation into several physiognomies. The typical 

vegetation consists of a mosaic of savanna, forest and grassland formations. The savanna 

formations are generally located on well-drained interfluves, whereas gallery forests follow 

the watercourses. As a consequence of this heterogeneity, the Cerrado presents high species 

richness and endemism of plants and vertebrates (Colli et al., 2002; Klink and Machado, 

2005). 

The Cerrado includes much of central Brazil and parts of northeastern Paraguay and 



General Introduction

eastern Bolivia (Ab’Saber, 1977), occupiyng a central position in relation to other large South 

American biomes, with extensive borders with the two largest forest biomes (Amazonia and 

Atlantic Forest) as well as with the two largest dry regions (Caatinga and Chaco).  

The Cerrado has a tropical wet and dry climate with intermediate rainfall between the 

wetter regions to the northwest and southeast and the drier areas to the northeast. Average 

annual rainfall varies between 125 and 200 cm and average annual temperature between 20° 

and 26° C (Ab’Saber 1977). The dry period lasts from 3 to 5 consecutive months (generally 

between May and September or October), during the winter of the Southern Hemisphere 

(Sarmiento 1983).

Most of the Cerrado is on plateaus of crystalline or sedimentary blocks, whose 

continuity is broken by an extensive network of peripheral or interplateau depressions (Brasil 

and Alvarenga 1989). This geomorphological variation explains much of the distribution of 

plants in the Cerrado (Cole 1986). Savannas are the dominant phytophysiognomy, covering 

around 72% of the region, but patches of dry forests and complex belts composed of both dry 

forests and savannas give the region a mosaic-like aspect (Fig. 1.3) (Cardoso Da Silva and 

Bates, 2002). About 24% of the region represents this mosaic of savanna–forest transition, 

with a remaining 4% being dry forest. The tops of the plateaus are flat, gently rolling surfaces 

at elevations ranging from 500 to 1700 m. They are covered primarily by cerrado, a 

semideciduous to evergreen savanna-like vegetation growing on the deep, well-drained, and 

nutrient-poor soils (Eiten 1990). Five main structural types of cerrado are recognized by 
botanists (Eiten 1972): i) cerradão, a dense forest type (8–15 m tall) that often has a 

completely closed canopy; ii) cerrado sensu stricto, a woodland (5–8 m tall) with closed scrub 

and more scattered trees than in cerradão; iii) campo cerrado, an open scrubland (3–6 m tall) 

with few trees; iv) campo sujo, grassland (2–3 m tall) with scattered shrubs; v) campo limpo, 

grassland with few or no shrubs or taller woody plants.  

 Besides cerrado, other types of distinct savanna vegetation, called campos 

rupestres, and miscellaneous lithosolic campos occur on rocky outcrops. These habitats are 

limited to small patches on the plateaus and have a highly endemic flora (Eiten 1990). Narrow 

fringes of gallery forest often border small rivers and streams of the region. Gallery forests on 

the plateaus grow on narrow belts of soils rich in organic matter (Eiten 1990). They are 

evergreen, have trees that are on average 20–30 m tall, and possess a dense understory of low 

stature (Ribeiro and Walter, 2008). Commonly associated with gallery forests are stands of a 

species of palm, Mauritia flexuosa, locally known as veredas. The peripheral depressions are 

generally flat surfaces of little relief (100–500 m in elevation) that are ocasionally inter- rupted 

by the presence of steep-sided hills.  

 The percentage of species endemic to the Cerrado varies across different groups of 

organisms: vascular plants (44%), amphibians (30%), reptiles (20%), mammals (11.8%), and 

birds (1.4%) (Myers et al., 2000). However, because large areas of the Cerrado remain 

unexplored (Silva, 1995), these numbers will likely change when additional biological

inventories are conducted. At present, we still know little about how these endemic species are 

distributed across the Cerrado or how they evolved. 

   

 

1.4.1. The anthropization of the Brazillian savana 
Up to the mid-twentieth century, the Cerrado had no economic value and was 

unattractive due to the scrubby nature of the vegetation, apparent low faunal densities,

pronounced dry season and frequent fires. By the 1950’s, the Brazilian government was 

determined to develop the “empty” center of the country, building the new capital city, 

Brasília, in the core of the Cerrado and stimulating agricultural development through 

subsidies, tax incentives, loans and guaranteed prices. These incentives, along with the 

development of appropriate technologies enabled farmers to deal with nutrient-poor and acidic 

soils, investing in large-scale fertilization, high yield/drought-resistant crop varieties and the 

heavy use of herbicides, pesticides and modern machinery. After all these agronomic 

investments, the Cerrado’s wide grasslands and dry soil offered much less resistance to land 

clearing and mechanical mobilization than rainforests. 

Over the past six decades the Cerrado became Brazil’s largest source of soybeans and 

pastureland, a significant producer of rice, corn, and cotton (Klink et al., 1999). From a 

revenue generation perspective, the benefits of commercial agriculture in the Cerrado are clear 

as soy is one of the main brazilian export commodities and the Cerrado supports the largest 

cattle herd in the country (Klink et al., 1999). Consequently, much of the biome’s landscape 

became a mosaic of “islands” of native vegetation surrounded by vast areas of homogeneous 

agricultural lands. Nearly 50% of the Cerrado is currently under direct human use, and about 

35% of its total natural cover has been converted into planted pastures and crops (Allan, 

2003).  

 The frantic conversion of the Cerrado into a massive agricultural land may be a side 

effect of the international pressure to halt deforestation in the Amazon. In the search for 

alternatives, the Cerrado has often been targeted (Ab’Saber et al. 1977). In fact, the Cerrado 

bovine herd as always been larger than the Amazon’s and the percentage of area used for 

crops has been superior in the Cerrado since 2005 (Fig. 1.4). The Brazilian government’s 

appreciation for the uniqueness of the Cerrado’s biodiversity has developed slowly. The first 

major conservation initiative occurred in 1997, when the Brazilian Ministry of Environment 

promoted a workshop, with over 200 scientific experts on the region, to define priority areas 

for conservation in the biome. It followed the same methodology applied earlier for the 

Atlantic Forest and Amazonia (Cavalcanti 1999). Several criteria for assessing biodiversity 

value were used, such as number of endemic species, species richness, presence of rare or 

endangered species or both, and sites of unique communities or key areas for migratory

species. The group identified a total of 87 priority areas that formed the basis for seting the 

current protected areas in the biome (Fig. 1.5). The urgency for conservation action in a 

priority area was determined by cross-referencing biodiversity data with the human-pressure 

and land cover change data (Cavalcanti 1999).

1.4.2. Scientific knowledge and Biases 
Unlike forests, grassy biomes have long been viewed as anthropogenic artifacts, 

degraded lands or secondary successional stages, often neglected by scientists and seen as 

uninteresting for conservationists (see for example Banerjee, 1995).  

In the year 2000, the Cerrado was classified as a global biodiversity hotspot due to 

high endemism rate and accelerated habitat loss and fragmentation (Klink and Machado, 2005; 

Myers et al., 2000). Although the extent of the environmental modification is less well 

documented than the economic transformation, the conversion of the Cerrado landscape is

potentially dangerous for its biodiversity, as 2 amphibians, 24 bird species and 21 mammals 

are now threatened with extinction in the Cerrado.  

Data on the herpetofauna of the Cerrado is still scarce when compared to the herpetofauna of 

other important biomes and even to other Cerrado taxa (Fig. 1.6). Large areas of this biome 

were never surveyed (Colli et al., 2002), suggesting that the known species richness is 

underestimated (Diniz-Filho et al., 2005). Although scientific projects on the Cerrado include 

studies on natural history (e.g. Alcantara et al., 2007; Durante et al., 2003) and community 

structure (e.g. Diniz-Filho et al., 2004; Giaretta et al., 2008),  information on diversity 

patterns, habitat use and species distribution is still limited (Colli et al., 2002). Furthermore, 

data on the influence of the widespread and intensive agricultural practices on the fauna of the 

Cerrado is rare and often too basic. We searched the literature for original papers published 

from 1994 to 2014. Searches were carried out in the Web of Knowledge database 

(apps.webofknowledge.com) in July 2015, using as search terms “Cerrado”, ‘‘Amazon’’, 

‘‘Atlantic Forest’’, “Caatinga”, ‘‘Pampa” and Pantanal. Afterwards we searched each biome 

along with ‘‘biodiversity’’, “conservation”, “agriculture”, “amphibians”, “mammals” and 

“birds”.

 The Amazon is, by far, the most studied biome regarding every term and all taxa, 

followed by the Atlantic Forest. The Cerrado is the least studied biome and, among the 

considered taxa, amphibians are the least studied vertebrates. This trend is especially worrying 

because of the accelerated degradation of the Cerrado and the global decline of amphibian 

populations. Research focusing on the biodiversity of the Cerrado has been increasing for the 

last 20 years, but research focusing on the amphibians of the Cerrado is still incipient (Fig. 

1.7), especially considering the anthropogenic pressure on the biome. Furthermore, scientific 

research on the biodiversity of the Cerrado is extremely concentrated in the southern and 

central region of the biome (Fig. 1.8), whereas most of the biome has been disregarded 

probably due to low funding and logistic impairments related to difficulty in sampling highly 

unaccessible areas. However, according to Valdujo et al., (2012), 19 amphibian species with 

restricted distributions and/or endemic to the Cerrado are completely unprotected. Therefore, 

the development of more scientific ecological studies on the anurofauna of this biome is 

urgent and paramount for the unbiased establishment of conservation policies.

1.5. Amphibians as surrogate species on ecological assessments 
 Scientists first became concerned about widespread amphibian population declines at the 
First World Congress of Herpetology, in 1989. Currently many amphibian species are on the 

brink of extinction, with 427 species (7.4%) listed as Critically Endangered (CR - the IUCN 

Category of highest threat), compared with 179 birds (1.8%) and 184 mammals (3.8%) (Stuart 

et al., 2004). The level of threat to amphibians is undoubtedly underestimated because 1294 

species (22.5%) are too poorly known to assess (Data Deficient - DD), compared with only 78 

birds (0.8%) (Birdlife International, 2008) and 256 mammals (5.3%) (Stuart et al., 2004). A 

significant proportion of DD amphibians is likely to be globally threatened (Howard and 

Bickford, 2014). Analysis of trends in population and habitat availability indicates a 

deterioration in the status of amphibians since 1980 (Stuart et al., 2004), when 1772 species 

(31%) would have been globally threatened, including 231 species (4%) in the CR category. 

Thus, in 1980, the percentage of CR amphibians would have been similar to that of mammals 

today, but the number of CR amphibians has almost doubled since then. Only 34 species of 

amphibian are reported to have become extinct since 1500, compared with 129 birds (Birdlife 

International, 2008)) and 74 mammals (IUCN, 2015). There is strong evidence that this 

situation is worsening because nine of these extinctions took place since 1980 (compared with 

five birds (Birdlife International, 2008) and no mammals (IUCN, 2015). Various threats to 

amphibians, such as global warming, habitat loss, disease vulnerability to chytrid fungus, and 

pollution) have been identified (Bielby et al., 2006; Kiesecker et al., 2001; Lips et al., 2003; 

Pounds, 2001; Pounds et al., 2006).  
Amphibians have several characteristics that make them useful as indicator species 

(Heyer et al., 1994). They are often locally abundant (Rocha et al. 2001, Watanabe et al. 2005) 

and may be sampled with low-cost standard methods (Heyer et al. 1994, Pierce and Gutzwiller 

2004). It is likely that amphibians will be good indicators of changes to the whole ecosystem 

because they are sensitive to changes in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Aquatic 

environment is required for reproduction in most species (Duellman and Trueb 1986) and the 

permeable skin of amphibians makes them sensitive  

 



General Introduction

to water quality and UV radiation in the egg and larval as well as adult life stages (Gerlanc and 

Kaufman 2005, Taylor et al. 2005). Many amphibian species spend much of their adult life in 

terrestrial environments, also responding to changes in these environments, especially those 

affecting water relations through their integument with behavioral responses (e.g., shifting 

activity periods or moving to different microhabitats) or less frequently with phenotypic 

responses (e.g., facultative lipid barrier adjustment; Lillywhite 2006). 

Some studies use amphibians as indicators of environmental contamination or pollution 

(e.g. Boone et al., 2007; Egea-Serrano et al., 2009). Others attempt to use the species 

assemblage (Sheridan and Olson 2003) or relative abundance (Campbell et al. 2005) as 

indicators of ecosystem health or habitat quality. Amphibians are among the most diverse and 

abundant vertebrates, play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators 

and prey, and enabling nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems. They are 

often critical to aquatic and terrestrial food webs, often reaching high densities and biomass 

(Schiesari et al. 2009). Regarding human societies, amphibians have key roles in disease 

control, control of agricultural pests (Lajmanovich et al. 2003; Attademo et al. 2005; Peltzer et 

al. 2005; Attademo et al. 2007; Peltzer et al. 2010), as food source, in pet trade, and medicinal 

resources (Valencia-Aguilar et al., 2013).  

 Given their ecological and economic importance, the extent to which threats to 

amphibians could affect the provision of services should be assessed, especially in the highly 

diverse and endangered Neotropics. However, the services provided by amphibians have 

rarely been considered among motivations for acting on their conservation status (Gratwicke 

et al. 2010). The development of conservation plans for such species and their inclusion in 

endangered species categories could help protect the ecosystem services provided by these 

organisms. 

 

1.6. Amphibian dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes 
Habitat fragmentation leads to reduced patch size, increased patch isolation, and 

increased risk of demographic, stochastic and genetic events (Cushman, 2005). This increases 

extinction risk by reducing demographic and genetic input from immigrants and reducing the 

chance of recolonization after extinction (Gulve, 1994; Lande, 1988). Spatial and temporal

patterns of animal movement influence population regulation, metapopulation dynamics, and 

long-term persistence of species (Semlitsch, 2008). Hence, understanding what facilitates and 

impairs animal movement is pivotal for habitat management and conservation.  

 Given their biphasic life cycle, amphibians migrate to and from breeding sites, making 

movement a crucial aspect of population persistence. However, amphibians have lower rates 

of movement per generation than invertebrates, mammals or reptiles (Bowne and Bowers, 

2004). Habitat connectivity has been regarded as key to regional viability of amphibian 

populations (Cushman, 2005; Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002; Todd and Rothermel, 2006). 

Breeding sites lacking connectivity to suitable terrestrial habitat may be population sinks due 

to high mortality of juveniles during emigration (Rothermel, 2004). Populations may decline if 

immigration is impaired and may not be recolonized following a local extinction (Semlitsch 

and Bodie, 1998). Connectivity seems to be of particular importance even in pristine 

landscapes, as amphibian populations experience relatively frequent local extinction and 

turnover (Trenham et al., 2003).  

 In anthropogenic landscapes, the effects of habitat fragmentation on juvenile dispersal 

are perceived as crucial for conserving pond breeding amphibians (Cushman, 2005). Low 

recruitment of dispersing individuals probably plays a major role in decline and extinction of 

amphibian populations in fragmented landscapes (Bulger et al., 2003). There are several 

important implications of habitat fragmentation on species persistence. High levels of post-

metamorphic survival are often required to maintain local populations, but substantial 

reductions in dispersal success and juvenile survival have been recorded in fragmented 

landscapes (Cushman, 2005). Hence, habitat fragmentation per se can substantially reduce 

post-metamorphic survival and population connectivity, threatening population viability.  

Recently, a number of studies have investigated the relationships between landscape 

structure and amphibian dispersal. Both spotted salamanders and wood frogs avoid crossing 

fields, pastures, clear-cuts, lawns, and roads (deMaynadier and Hunter, 1999; Marsh et al., 

2004; Regosin et al., 2003; Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002). Furthermore, orientation of both 

spotted salamander and wood frog is biased toward forest (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002). 

Lower recapture rates in fields reflected high mortality rates due to desiccation and predation, 

suggesting that fields are substantially resistant to amphibian dispersal, and thus forest

fragmentation reduces dispersal rates for those species (Marsh et al., 2004; Rothermel and 

Semlitsch, 2002; Rothermel, 2004). 

In order to understand the population-level implications of fragmentation, it is 

necessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how multiple factors interact 

across larger spatial extents to influence population connectivity (Bowne and Bowers, 2004; 

McGarigal and Cushman, 2002). Non-spatial studies conducted at local scales do not provide 

a basis for inferences at the landscape or regional level (McGarigal and Cushman, 2002). 

Landscape-level studies that represent the spatial patterns of the environment, addressing 

species-specific dispersal are essential to extend fine-scale species environment relationships 

to the population-level (McGarigal and Cushman, 2002). 

 Understanding amphibian movement is critical for effective management and 

conservation of amphibians (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002), especially in higly fragmented 

and unstable anthropogenic landscapes. Advances in technology such as radiotelemetry, stable 

isotope analysis, and use of microsatellite geneticmarkers have yielded greater resolution of 

the movement ecology of amphibians. However, low funding often impairs the wide use of 

these approaches. Hence, other techniques have been adopted to study how landscapes shape 

amphibian meta-population dynamics, such as graph-theoretic approaches.  Graph-theoretic 

approaches may possess the greatest benefit-to-effort ratio for conservation problems that 

require characterization of large- scale connectivity, due to their ability to provide a detailed 

picture of connectivity with modest data requirements (Calabrese and Fagan, 2004).  

1.7. Objectives and thesis framework 
Amphibian ecology is complex, characterized by an inherent duality of dependencies 

and vulnerabilities, a larval stage associated to waterbodies, an adult stage associated to 

terrestrial environments and a necessity to migrate to and from waterbodies as recently 

metamorphosed individuals and as breeding adults. Because of that complex life cycle, 

approaching how amphibian populations are affected by human-mediated activities demands 

an integrated, thorough, landscape-scale perspective to reliantly evaluate how populations are 

shaped by anthropogenic activities.

Although studies spanning many taxa are important for uncovering general and robust 

relationships between traits and extinction risk (Cardillo et al., 2008), they may conceal 

important taxon-specific associations. Many species’ traits show relationships to extinction 

risk to be inconciliable across species groups (Purvis et al., 2000), making more narrowly 

focused studies important (Fisher &amp;amp; Owens, 2004; Isaac &amp;amp; Cowlishaw, 2004; Cardillo &amp;amp; 

Meijaard, 2012), even though the results may be challenging to generalize.  

I attempted to make a multidimensional and integrated evaluation of the effects 

anthropogenic activities have on the anurofauna of the Cerrado.  

In Chapter 2 I revised the literature to summarize the current knowledge on the effects 

of the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado on the biome’s anurofauna. I found this 

important because there is still the misconception that fauna from arid biomes is composed of 

generalist and resilient species and, therefore, probably not affected by human activities. I also 

found this review provided me with the ideal position to start assessing how the anurofauna of 

the Cerrado was, is and will be affected by the anthropization of the biome. 

In Chapter 3 I analyzed how anuran species traits related to current official extinction 

risk and, based on those high extinction risk traits, I predicted the extinction risk for the whole 

anurofauna of the biome, including species DD. Based on species trait importance, I evaluated 

conservation targets for every species and propose an integrative framework for assessing 

species extinction risk and high priority areas for biomes with low funding and high 

antrohpogenic pressure.  

In Chapter 4 I performed and integrative evaluating of the effects of converting natural 

Cerrado-Amazon ecotone habitats to a vast irrigated rice crop. I assessed taxonomic, 

functional and phylogenetic diversity and body condition as a metric of population fitness. I 

also identified which traits are selected and eliminated in Neotropical rice crops. 

In Chapter 5 I analyzed how local and landscape features affect overall functional 

diversity, trait diversity and phylogenetic diversity. I also determined which landscape features 

are most important for maintaining the most diverse anuran communities in Neotropical 

agroecosystems. 

Finally, in Chapter 6 I approached the connectivity aspect of amphibian populations in 

anthropogenic landscapes. Using anuran diversity metrics as proxies for amphibian functional

connectivity I evaluated waterbody importance for connectivity in the sampled waterbody 

network embedded in rice crops. I determined which landscape features are more important 

for increasing amphibian functional connectivity in Neotropical rice crops.  

In Chapter 7 I summarize the main findings from the previous chapters, making 

management recommendations and presenting priorities for future research projects.

 The Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and has been vastly transformed 

into a highly mechanized and intensive agricultural area, with very little public opposition. 

The native anurofauna is rich in species number and endemism, but has long been regarded 

as a generalist community originated from neighboring biomes. The accelerated 

degradation of Cerrado habitats and consequent landscape fragmentation caused by 

agricultural activities are invariably bound to affect local anuran communities. However, 

the effects of these activities on native amphibians are seldom studied, despite the 

acknowledged adverse effects of these disturbances on the anurofauna elsewhere and the 

fact that amphibian populations worldwide are declining. This review aims to finally 

gather the most important findings on the effects of anthropogenic activities on local 

amphibians. We synthesize the main existing Portuguese and English written literature on 

the effects of the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado anurofauna, generally not 

easily accessible to the international scientific community. We found a clear paucity of 

studies on ecology, demography and distribution of the Cerrado amphibians, especially 

when compared to other biomes and taxa. Yet, the few existing studies indicate that, while 

this community may be more resilient to some anthropogenic activities (e.g. fire) than their 

forest counterparts, agricultural environments are strongly dominated by generalist species. 

Natural forest fragments are important features for maintaining a diverse anuran 

community in agroecosystems. Intense agrochemical use has been acknowledged to cause

histopathologic alterations and potential decreased fitness. Chytridiomycosis has been 

recorded in thirteen species extant in the biome, including endemics. The Cerrado 

anurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to hydroelectric dams, as even previously 

common, widespread and generalist species declined or disappeared after flooding. Latest 

predictions indicate that the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed northward, 

dramatically reducing the proportion of remaining natural habitats due to climate change, 

leading to a great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will 

remain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. Most 

species will undergo more contraction than expansion of suitable areas in 2050, with high 

extinction risk. Future climate changes will be especially detrimental for endemic anurans, 

with small potential current distribution. We conclude that, contrary to widespread beliefs, 

the biodiversity of the Amazon is not the only one experiencing aggressive threats in 

Brazil. The anurofauna of the Cerrado is under an unacknowledged extremely high 

extinction risk and in urgent need of more scientific studies and conservation and 

management projects.

2.2  Introduction	

Up to the mid-twentieth century the Cerrado had no economic value and was 

occupied by a few large extensive cattle farms, as the soil’s low nutrient content and 

acidity, low faunal densities and lack of railroad access restricted agriculture. However, in 

the 1950’s various forms of government incentives stimulated the agricultural development 

of the biome and transformed it into Brazil’s new agricultural frontier. The biome became 

the country’s main source of soybeans and host to the largest cattle herd nationwide (Klink 

and Moreira, 2002). It is estimated that ca. 40% of the Cerrado has already been converted 

into crops and pastures (Sano et al, 2009), with a cumulative conversion of 43,6% in 2002 

and 47,8% in 2008 (MMA/IBAMA/PNUD, 2010) and the highest annual conversion rate 

(0,7%) of the six Brazilian biomes from 2002 to 2008 (MMA/IBAMA/PNUD, 2011).  

 Although the bovine herd of the Cerrado was always larger than that of the 

Amazon, and the percentage of crop area is superior in the Cerrado since 2005 (Fig. 2), the 

accelerated anthropogenic conversion of the Brazilian savanna has proceeded with little 

opposition. In fact, this frantic conversion into vast agricultural areas may be a result of 

international pressure to halt deforestation in the Amazon (Ab’Saber et al. 1990).  

 Global climate change and a growing human population are expected to increase 

the frequency and severity of anthropogenic disturbances, which will pose broad effects on 

biological diversity (McKenzie et al. 2004; Scholze et al. 2006; IPCC 2007). Species 

response to disturbance depends on the type and magnitude of disturbance, the amount and 

configuration of remaining habitat, and their life-history characteristics (Prugh et al. 2008; 

Kuussaari et al. 2009). We aim to summarize the recorded effects of the main 

anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado amphibians. We will further elaborate on the 

current decline risk for the biome’s anurofauna based on what has been recorded and on 

the ecophysiological traits characteristic of the biome’s amphibians. 

 

2.3  The Cerrado anurofauna 

South-American amphibians are concentrated in the Atlantic and Amazon 

rainforests (Buckley &amp;amp; Jetz 2007). Although savannas are commonly assumed to harbor an 

impoverished anurofauna (e.g., Duellman 1993), recent studies have uncovered a 



Chapter 2 

	

74	

surprisingly rich Cerrado, with high anuran species richness (at least 204 species), 

including endemic, widespread, and marginal species (Valdujo et al. 2012). 

 The Cerrado is linked to forest biomes and open domains through wide ecotones 

that favor biological interchange. Communities are thus structured as a mosaic, assembled 

from multiple adjoining regional species pools (Valdujo et al. 2012). Of the 204 anuran 

species, 145 are considered typical as they consistently occur in the Cerrado and 59 as 

marginal, known only from ecotones (Colli et al. 2002). Furthermore, 102 species are 

endemic or near endemic. Hence, most occurring species are restricted or strongly 

associated to the Cerrado, while only a smaller proportion is widespread  (Valdujo et al. 

2012). 

 Amphibians are ectothermic, have permeable skin and low dispersal ability, 

resulting in higher ecophysiological constraints (Hillman et al. 2009). As rainfall and 

temperature determine tropical anuran phenology, the marked seasonality and high spatial 

heterogeneity of the Cerrado have profound effects on anuran ecology. Accordingly, 

Cerrado anurans have developed numerous behavioral adaptations to resist desiccation and 

maximize survival in adverse conditions. Diurnal species of anurans, common in the 

humid Amazon and Atlantic Forests, are relatively rare in the Cerrado (Heyer et al. 1990). 

Fossorial behaviors are very common among Cerrado anurans, hiding underground, in 

holes or under the leaf litter in order to avoid high temperatures and/or low humidity. 

Breeding strategies are also adapted to the environmental restrictions of the biome as most 

anurans breed only during the rainy season (October to April) in temporary waterbodies 

located in open vegetation areas (Brandão and Araujo 1998, Vasconcellos &amp;amp; Colli 2009). 

Leptodactylus sp. commonly dig burrows and build foam nests for their clutch, protecting 

against predators and facilitating physiological processes such as respiration, excretion and 

water regulation (Prado et al. 2002, Giaretta and Kokubum 2003, Prado et al. 2005, 

Kokubum &amp;amp; Giaretta 2005). Foam nests also minimize the increase of temperature and  

decrease of air/soil moisture in unfavorable conditions such as drought or intense heat, 

both frequent in the biome. 

Although empirically seen as more resilient to anthropogenic practices than their 

forest counterparts, it is almost certain that, given the magnitude of the ongoing 

anthropogenic activities, the Cerrado’s biodiversity is being affected at ecosystem, 

community and population levels (see Brooks et al., 2002).

2.4 Effects of the main anthropogenic activities on the Cerrado anurans 

 The main economic activities in the Cerrado are agriculture and cattle farming. 

Agriculture has important and complex effects on biodiversity, causing both habitat loss 

and pesticide contamination, regarded as the main causes for amphibian declines 

worldwide (Beebee and Griffiths 2005). Agriculture causes spatial and temporal habitat 

homogenization and decreased suitability of anuran breeding areas (Piha 2006). Crop and 

pasture setting requires previous land clearing, often with prescribed fires, altering habitat 

structure, removing the canopy, exposing the floor to sunlight and wind, which leads to a 

warmer, drier surface microclimate, reducing leaf litter and food resources (Ash 1997, 

Zheng et al. 2000). These conditions may expose amphibians to warmer and drier 

microclimate conditions, leading to lower survival or higher evacuation of habitats (Todd 

and Rothermel 2006, Semlitsch  2008).  

 Other economic activities, such as hydroelectric exploration, are also prominent in 

the biome, and cause extensive damage to landscape and biodiversity.  

 The next section of this review will summarize the main anthropogenic activities 

occurring in the Cerrado and the studies on their effects on amphibians.  

 

2.4.1 Fire 

Fire is an important feature of the Cerrado and its flora and fauna are naturally 

resistant to it (Coutinho, 1982). However, fire regimes have been tremendously affected by 

rural activities in the last 20 years. Natural fires occur during the wet season, usually 

caused by lightning, typically briefer, shallower and colder than prescribed fires. The 

current main cause of fire in the Cerrado is agricultural and its purpose to transform the 

native vegetation into crops or pastures (Coutinho 1990). Prescribed fires are hotter and 

cause increased soil temperature, affecting deeper soil layers. Even in a fire-prone biome, 

anthropogenic fires may alter soil moisture and temperature, vegetation structure, litter 

thickness and erosion rates (Schurbon and Fauth 2003). 

 Drummond (2009) studied the effect of fire on anurans from campos rupestres, a 

fire-prone Cerrado physiognomy (Moreira, 1996), and recorded an increase in species 



Chapter 2 

	

76	

richness after the fire and an increase in the abundance of the two endemic species of 

campos rupestres, Physalaemus erythros and Scinax curicica. Although many species 

were recorded after the fire, every species was represented by only a few individuals. 

Furthermore, all species found after the fire are known to be resilient to environmental 

changes such as Dendropsophus minutus, Scinax squalirostris, Scinax fuscovarius, 

Leptodactylus latrans, L. fuscus and Rhinella pombali (IUCN 2013). The author also found 

a higher frequency of terrestrial species, often considered more resistant to fire than 

arboreal species (Friend, 1993), as they remain buried during the dry season.  

 The burying habit has been recorded for several Cerrado anurans such as 

Physalaemus sp. (Santos et al., 2003) and Leptodactylus sp. (Oliveira Filho et al., 2005). 

These species also build foam nests, known to prevent clutch desiccation and provide 

thermal stability (Dobkin &amp;amp; Gettinger, 1985). These fire-resistance features, common in 

savanna amphibians, may explain the increased abundance of terrestrial species after fires, 

especially when compared to forest communities.  

 Despite also being considered resistant to anthropogenic disturbances, Ischnocnema 

juipoca was abundant throughout the area before the fire, but rarely found afterwards. 

Species of Brachicephalidae, such as I. juipoca, are completely terrestrial, have direct 

development and find shelter at the base of grass clumps (Eterovick and Sazima, 2004). 

Consequently, once the vegetation of the area was swept by fire, mortality of I. juipoca 

was likely substantial. Furthermore, this species may lays its eggs at the base of grass 

clumps, due to the higher water availability (Eterovick and Sazima, 2004), but in a soil 

devoid of grasses and exposed to desiccation, reproductive success may be low in 

environments recently burned. Hence, I. juipoca may be especially susceptible to fire 

despite its association to a fire prone phytophysiognomy.  

 The author also detected an increase in microhabitat use and inter-specific 

competition in arboreal anurans after the fire. This can be associated with the destruction 

of preferred microhabitats available in marginal and aquatic vegetation, suggesting the use 

of sub-optimal microhabitats by this group after the fire. Arboreal species showed a large 

proportion of empty stomachs, smaller prey and lower total volume of prey compared to 

terrestrial species. These results confirm those by Rocha et al. (2008), who found a 

negative effect of fire on the diet of Scinax sp.. 



The Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado 

77	

	

 Amphibians are carnivores with a diet composed mostly of arthropods (Araújo et 

al., 2007; Almeida-Gomes, 2007). Fire may have negatively affected the arthropod 

community, reducing prey availability for amphibians. While treefrogs were negativelly 

affected, terrestrial species seemed unaffected because arthopods such as termites and ants 

build underground nests and resist fires (Vasconcelos et al. 2008), being available as prey 

to terrestrial frogs. However, arboreal anurans are unlikely to forage on terrestrial preys. 

 These results were corroborated by Brasileiro (2004), who found anuran species 

richness and abundance to be unaffected by fire and higher interspecific competition for 

calling and egg-laying sites following the elimination of emergent vegetation by fire. 

Morais, Côrtes and Bastos (2011) studied the influence of fire on co-occurrence patterns of 

anurans in veredas, linear environments associated to watercourses (Oliveira &amp;amp; Ratter, 

2002), composed of hydrophilic vegetation and characterized by a dense herbaceous layer 

and dominance of the arboreal palmtree Mauritia flexuosa (Ribeiro &amp;amp; Walter, 2008). The 

authors observed that co-occurrence patterns, anuran species composition and richness 

were not significantly influenced by fire.  

 Fire-induced vegetation changes can increase water temperature, alter water 

holding capacity of plants and soil and lead to changes in the timing of peak and low-water 

events (Rieman and Clayton, 1997). Thermal stress and rapid changes in water chemistry 

may cause mortality of some species in ponds or streams (Spencer and Hauer, 1991). 

However, tadpoles of some Cerrado anurans are known to be resilient to several 

environmental changes. Larvae of Scinax fuscovarius and Leptodactylus fuscus tolerate 

high water temperature (Schinia and Neto, 1990), and low oxygen levels, which may be 

common in waterbodies with sparse vegetation. Eterovick &amp;amp; Sazima (2000) argue that the 

same can happen for tadpoles of Leptodactylus cunicularius, Leptodactylus furnarius and 

Physalaemus cuvieri. In fact, intense fire in watersheds can result in increased 

concentrations of nutrients such as phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite in 

waterbodies, which may increase the productivity of aquatic ecosystems, providing more 

food and, therefore result in faster growth of resilient herbivorous anuran larvae (Kiffney 

and Richardson, 2001). 

Despite their ecophysiological constraints, the main effects of fire on amphibians are 

most likely indirect, as fire often creates an inhospitable environment associated with 

profound alterations to the leaf litter, ground cover, and soil. Loss of cover can result in 



Chapter 2 

	

78	

exposure to extreme temperatures, desiccation, high predation risk, physiological stress 

and reduced dispersal and foraging abilities. Several studies (e.g. Cano &amp;amp; Leynaud, 2010, 

Matthews et al., 2010) found negative effects of fire on anuran assemblages and suggested 

that fire may reduce species richness and abundance. However, and despite the paucity of 

studies, it appears that species native from grassy biomes exhibit some remarkable 

resilience to burning due to behavioral traits and reproductive strategies. Nonetheless, 

some species may be especially threatened. 

 Vulnerability to fire varies as forest communities may be especially sensitive 

(Gardner, Barlow and Peres, 2007), while savanna communities such as the Cerrado may 

be more resilient. Nevertheless, long-term studies must be developed to clarify the effects 

of fire on the diverse Cerrado anurofauna, especially regarding anthropogenic fires 

(Morais, Côrtes and Bastos, 2011) and the effects of altering fire regimes from superficial, 

lighting-caused, rainy season fires to more aggressive, anthropogenic fires set during the 

dry season. 

 

2.4.2 Crops 

 The influence of agriculture on amphibian populations has been reported for many 

regions (e.g. Beja and Alcazar 2003). Agricultural activities are varied in nature, timing 

and gravity for biodiversity. Overall, effects are complex and dependent on characteristics 

such as timing, vegetation structure and cover, species cultivated, plant density and row-

spacing. Habitat loss, decreased connectivity and water contamination are the most 

conspicuous effects of agriculture on amphibians worldwide (Liner et al. 2008).  However, 

the potential an activity has to be detrimental to amphibians depends on the nature of the 

activity, how directly the amphibians are exposed to it and on the ability amphibians have 

to resist or escape the threat. Naturally, activities that occur during the time period 

amphibians are more active have higher probability of affecting amphibians than activities 

occurring on a period during which amphibians are not vulnerable (Fig. 2.1). Hence, when 

analyzing how anthropogenic activities may affect biodiversity, it is pivotal to consider 

species characteristics.

Despite the ecological value of the world’s most diverse savanna, and the 

omnipresence of human-mediated activities on the Cerrado, few studies have addressed the 

influence of agriculture on the biome’s anuran communities. 

 Among the main crops of the Cerrado, soybean and rice originate different 

microclimatic conditions, distinct resource and refuge availability, posing different 

survival risks for local anurans (Fig. 2.2). The conversion of native Cerrado habitats into 

soybean crops and rice fields causes a significant reduction in evapotranspiration and an 

increase in water flow (Nosetto et al. 2011). In denser crops, with smaller row spacing, soil 

temperature may be lower than in soils covered by native vegetation and leaf litter less 

abundant and more homogeneous in crops. Furthermore, in the Cerrado, crop plantation 

often occurs when anurans are most active (beginning of the rainy season), which may be 

especially detrimental to individuals migrating from hibernation shelters to breeding sites.

2.4.2.1. Soy crops 

Silva et al. (2009) assessed the anuran community in agro-systems and found only 

terrestrial species in soy crops (Leptodactylus mystacinus, Physalaemus cuvieri and 

Physalaemus nattereri). Physalaemus nattereri, a burrowing frog (Freitas et al., 2001), was 

the only species found in all crops, perhaps because it can remain burrowed until the 

following reproductive season, escaping many of the disturbances. According to Gray et al. 

(2004), agricultural disturbance around wetlands may positively influence the abundance 

of some amphibian species. Less vagile amphibians that aestivate and breed explosively 

are competitively dominant in the absence of predators and may benefit from landscape 

cultivation (Gray et al. 2004). Agricultural landscapes may therefore have a negative 

influence on anuran communities, causing decreases in species richness or favoring the 

occurrence of generalist species as a result of changes to the vegetation. 

 Vaz-Silva (2009) found that areas distant from monocultures showed higher 

tadpole heterogeneity, species richness and abundance of treefrogs. Furthermore, 

microhabitat availability was higher in waterbodies distant from crops, providing more 

calling sites and refuges for adults and larvae. Overall, S. fuscovarius, Dendropsophus 

minutus and E. nattereri were the most abundant species but, while E. nattereri was 

common in smaller, colder, shallower waterbodies located close to crops, tadpoles from D. 

minutus were associated with larger, warmer, deeper, with low pH waterbodies, distant 

from soy crops and closer to forest fragments. Microhabitat use was higher in agricultural 

environments and most species found in both pristine and agricultural waterbodies had 

smaller niches in agricultural waterbodies. In areas distanced from the crops, D. minutus 

and S. fuscovarius displayed wider niches, suggesting great environmental plasticity 

regarding microhabitat use. In areas near crops, E. nattereri and L. fuscus behaved as 

generalist species, with broad niches. 

 Morais et. al. (2011) found species richness in waterbodies located near soybean 

crops to be high and similar to that of protected areas in the biome (Eterovick and Sazima 

2004, Uetanabaro et al. 2007). However, most of the recorded species were widespread 

(Frost 2010), open area breeders and habitat generalists (Brasileiro et al. 2005). 

  

 



Chapter 2 

	

82	

 

 Campos et al. (2013) found higher species richness and abundance in temporary 

lentic waterbodies on an agricultural matrix, corroborating previous studies (e.g. Prado et 

al. 2005, Santos et al. 2007, Vasconcelos et al. 2008). Structural habitat heterogeneity and 

larval development plasticity account for the increased species richness and relative 

abundance in temporary ponds compared to lotic waterbodies and permanent lagoons. 

Diverse vertical strata favors a wider array of species, including hylids, leptodactylids and 

leiuperids, whereas lotic waterbodies typically have less diversified marginal vegetation 

and favor a smaller array of species commonly with strong breeding specializations. 

However, lentic temporary waterbodies harbored many generalist species associated to 

anthropogenic environments. 

 

2.4.2.2. Rice crops 

Despite the modifications ensuing the replacement of native vegetation by rice 

crops and the alterations to the hydrological cycle resulting from irrigation techniques, rice 

fields often harbor many species (Elphick 2004; Doody et al. 2006) and have been 

considered “functional equivalents” to natural wetlands (Elphick 2000). 

 Given the actual expansion of rice crops in the Neotropics, and particularly in the 

Cerrado, it is important to determine if agricultural wetlands can maintain high levels of 

biodiversity. Several studies have analyzed biodiversity patterns in fragmented wetlands in 

Brazil (Stenert and Maltchik, 2007; Rolon et al., 2008; Stenert et al., 2008), but the 

importance of rice fields to the conservation of Neotropical amphibians has been 

overlooked. Since wetlands serve as important breeding sites for most amphibians, 

alterations to these systems can compromise several anuran species (Silvano and Segalla, 

2005). 

 Irrigated rice fields in Brazil present a dynamic hydrologic regime, with variation 

between aquatic and terrestrial phases, remaining without surface water during the fallow 

phase, when the crop is drained and rice sowed. Despite rice being one of the main cash 

crops of the Cerrado, there are no studies on the effects of rice crops on anuran 

communities.  

 



The Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado 

83	

	

Duré (2008) studied the anuran community of irrigated rice fields in the 

Argentinian savannah and found a diverse anurofauna similar to that found in undisturbed 

wetlands, as was previously recognized by Bambaradeniya et al. (2004).  However, they 

also found that natural vegetation supported the highest species richness. This underscores 

the importance of retaining patches of natural vegetation in rice paddies to maintain 

diverse anuran communities. Earthen irrigation ditches also assure conditions for diverse 

anuran microhabitats, especially useful for dispersal from natural vegetation into flooded 

rice fields. Bambaradeniya et al. (2004) found that aquatic organisms were able to use dry 

rice field soil cracks and crevices for aestivation when the fields were drained. This finding 

is corroborated by Duré (2008), who found adults and foam nests in cracks after field 

drying. Perennial pools with aquatic vegetation may explain the presence of frogs in rice 

fields and indicate the importance of such features for anuran populations. The existence of 

aquatic species, such as Lysapsus limellum, in an environment subjected to drastic water 

levels variations was also of interest. The existence of pools that contain aquatic vegetation 

throughout the terrestrial dry phase, would explain the presence of these frogs.  

Machado and Maltchik (2010) investigated the potential role of rice fields as 

refugia for amphibians and how different management practices could influence the 

amphibian community. Twelve anuran species were found in the rice fields, representing 

75% of the area’s species richness (Loebmann, 2005). However, species composition in 

pristine wetlands differed from that found in rice fields, mainly regarding the dominance of 

hylids and leptodactylids. Furthermore, anuran richness and abundance changed over the 

rice cultivating cycle, peaking in the growing phases, during the warmer summer, with 

abundant surface water. This study showed that even though management practices in rice 

fields produced similar anuran richness and abundance, species composition is different 

from pristine areas. Lack of surface water in dry rice fields during most of the cultivating 

cycle favored the development of terrestrial species, such as Bufonidae, Cycloramphidae, 

and Leptodactylidae whereas in rice fields that remained flooded, hylids were more 

abundant. Hence, the mosaic created by rice wetlands and drained lands can harbor high 

anuran diversity but rice fields must not be viewed as surrogate systems for natural 

wetlands, given that the more complex natural systems harbor more diverse communities, 

influence aquifer recharge, climatic stability and water storage. 



Chapter 2 

	

84	

Moreira et al. (2014) recorded 60% of region’s total species richness in rice fields, 

with dominance of open areas species. Indeed, it has been argued that only generalist 

species are able to remain in areas converted to rice fields (Doody et al. 2006; Piatti et al. 

2010). Amphibians that depend on ponds in agricultural fields may be exposed to high 

levels of agrochemicals, which could affect biota directly or indirectly (Peltzer et al. 2008; 

Attademo et al. 2011). Agricultural intensification also affects the structure of habitat in 

which amphibians forage and reproduce (Peltzer et al. 2006; Piatti et al. 2010). Non-

specialized reproductive modes (e.g. mode 1 sensu Haddad and Prado 2005) or those that 

confer some protection against desiccation (e.g., modes 11 and 30) are more favored in 

open areas or environments with seasonal availability of water, such as rice fields. 

Temporary environments are more likely to dry up and be occupied by species with rapid 

development and those that build foam nests, which allow the larvae to survive until the 

next rain/flood (Zina and Haddad 2006). Indeed, the authors found a higher number of 

tadpoles of species that deposit eggs in foam nests inside subterranean constructed 

chambers (mode 30). Despite rice fields being often perceived as potential surrogate 

habitats for many wetland species (Machado and Maltchik 2010), tadpole abundance was 

low. Although the presence of tadpoles might be a good indicator that rice crops are 

effectively used for breeding activity, this must be heeded cautiously, as tadpoles might 

have originally occurred in other flooded areas and then ended up in the rice fields via 

irrigation water. Fish that generally prey upon tadpoles were observed inside rice quadrats 

and irrigation channels, which, in addition to the predation effect on tadpoles and adults, 

influences breeding site selection by amphibians (Werner et al. 2007).  Additive or 

synergistic effects of pesticide use and habitat homogenization on tadpole predation have 

been demonstrated in amphibians (Mann et al. 2009). Thus, fish predation associated with 

low tadpole abundance could explain species absence during the late growing period. The 

authors also found hylid tadpoles in organic rice fields, which may be associated with the 

presence of a strip of vegetation close to these rice plots. During the off-season, organic 

crops retain water in the irrigation and drainage canals, ephemeral pools are common in the 

rice plots. Conventional fields are drained and sometimes used for cattle grazing. It has 

been suggested that hydroperiod predicts tadpole guild composition in grasslands (Santos 

et al. 2007; Both et al. 2011). In this case, presence of hylid tadpoles in organic fields 

might simply be related to longer hydroperiods. However, this does not exclude other

effects of organic management, such as no or little use of chemical pesticides/inorganic 

fertilizers and maintenance of a heterogeneous landscape around crop edges, of 

contributing to abundance in nearby areas.  

Maltchik et al. (2011) investigated if irrigation channels could maintain high anuran 

diversity over the cultivation cycle and found species corresponding to 63% of the richness 

observed in the studied region (Loebmann 2005). However, anuran community was 

strongly dominated by L. latrans, P. minuta, and P. biligonigerus, all generalist and highly 

adaptable species (Loebmann 2005). 

 Crops can maintain apparently viable anuran populations despite the fact that the 

main anuran breeding and feeding season may occur during cropping. However, there will 

be a dominance of generalist, widespread, open area breeders and terrestrial species. In 

particular, rice fields appear to have the potential to support diverse anuran communities, 

due to certain characteristics of rice production, namely the need to flood the crop. 

However, natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow 

depressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation must be assured as they 

appear to be important landscape features for promoting the use of rice fields by anurans. 

Nonetheless, even if these structures are assured in agricultural landscapes, anuran 

populations of generalist species might be under sup-optimal conditions. Telles et al. 

(2007) analyzed the genetic structure of P. cuvieri populations from central Cerrado and 

found that anthropization explains patterns of genetic distances, even regarding recent 

disturbances. The genetic distances found were higher than expected by geographic 

distances. Current human population density, characteristics of habitat fragmentation and 

year since the creation of each municipality are involved in the explanation of these 

discontinuities. Indeed, the southeast region of the biome, with the strongest 

discontinuities, was the first region occupied, in the 18th century.  

 

2.4.3 Agrochemicals &amp;amp; Diseases 

Besides habitat degradation and fragmentation, contamination from agrochemicals 

is the biggest threat to amphibians worldwide. Although Brazil is the world’s largest 

consumer of pesticides (Pacheco, 2009), the impacts of agricultural pesticides on local 

amphibians have barely been explored. The most commonly used herbicides in soy and 

rice crops are glyphosate, phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and endosulfan. 



Chapter 2 

	

86	

Simioni, Silva and Mott (2013) determined the toxicity (CL50) of the herbicide 

glyphosate on P. albonotatus and tadpole survivorship rates under sub-lethal 

concentrations. Glyphosate is a systemic herbicide, considered slightly toxic to vertebrates 

and environmentally innocuous since it is promptly adsorbed and does not remain active in 

the environment. However, some studies have indicated that glyphosate can cause negative 

impacts to the biota (Langiano &amp;amp; Martinez, 2008), including amphibians (Releya, 2005; 

Releya &amp;amp; Jones, 2009). The CL50 value for P. albonotatus was four times smaller than the 

value found for a congeneric species (P. centralis) using the same protocol (Figueiredo and 

Rodrigues, 2010). Figueiredo and Rodrigues (2010) found even higher values of CL50 for 

two other Brazilian amphibian species, the bufonid Rhinella marina and the microhylid 

Elachistocleis sp. These discrepancies may reflect a differential resistance of anurans 

species to herbicides. Figueiredo and Rodrigues (2010) collected egg masses in puddles 

close to soybean plantations, where glyphosate has been used for at least a decade. Anuran 

species with different historical contact with pesticides may develop tolerance. Species-

specific tolerances may also be due to phylogenetic factors or environmental conditions 

and merit further investigation, as there was also considerable variation in the response of 

Brazilian anuran species to sub-lethal concentrations of glyphosate. For example, P. 

centralis had higher mortality rates when kept in higher sub-lethal concentrations of 

glyphosate. For R. marina, 50% and 75% of CL50 also affected survivorship, although for 

Elachistocleis sp. differences in mortality among different sub-lethal concentrations were 

not statistically significant (Figueiredo and Rodrigues 2010). Hence, glyphosate exposure 

poses different threat levels to different anuran species. However, further research is 

needed to assess whether resistance is influenced by phylogenetic signature, tolerance 

and/or historical contact with pesticides. 

 Moreira et al. (2012) analyzed groundwater and rainwater for pesticides and related 

these data to morphological anomalies and presence of organochlorines in the blood 

plasma of R. schneideri and Leptodactylus labyrinthicus. Residues of endosulfan, flutriafol 

and atrazine were detected in the water. Endosulfan, an organochlorine insecticide, is 

known be very toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms (Grisolia, 2005) and many studies 

have confirmed its mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity (e.g., Gupta, Saxema 

and Chandra, 2000). Endosulfan residues were detected in the plasma of R. schneideri and 

L. labyrinthicus. Posterior analyzes detected external malformations in cane toads but not

in pepper frogs. The presence of residues of endosulfan and others organochlorine 

pesticides in anuran blood plasma may indicate impaired fitness, as atrazine is known to 

cause loss of larval swimming performance, adult sex changes and various anatomical 

anomalies. 

 Lima (2010) performed histological analysis on liver, skin and reproductive system 

of Leptodactylus latrans individuals from pristine and agricultural Cerrado areas. Although 

both liver and skin showed histopathologic changes, liver tissue was damaged in animals 

from pristine and agricultural areas. Two of the three studied areas where under direct 

influence of agriculture, but the first area was presumably free of pesticides, which may 

indicate the power that pesticide use in agricultural areas have on the surrounding habitats. 

 Survival in agroecosystems depends upon the physiological tolerance of organisms 

to adapt to rapid changes in the habitat or to adopt an effective dispersal behavior (Beja 

and Alcazar 2003; Bambaradeniya et al. 2004; Davidson 2004). The available studies 

indicate that the generalists commonly found in Cerrado crops may be in sub-optimal 

fitness conditions due to pesticide exposure, representing an inconspicuous detrimental 

consequence of agriculture for anuran populations. More studies are urgently needed in 

order to thoroughly assess the effects of agrochemicals on the Cerrado anurofauna. 

 Infectious diseases in general are regarded as one of the most significant catalysts 

driving global amphibian declines (Young 2004), and the emerging chytridiomycosis is a 

prominent cause of anuran population declines (Schloegel et al. 2010). Chytridiomycosis, 

caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been detected in 

more than 350 amphibian species (Skerratt et al. 2007, Lips et al. 2006, Stuart et al. 2004). 

This disease has been linked to population decline in at least 200 species since 1980 

(Skerratt et al. 2007). The fungus targets amphibian skin and colonizes keratinous 

structures such as tadpole oral discs (Berger et al. 1998). Infections in tadpoles can affect 

their feeding, constraining growth, metamorphosis, and survival (Blaustein et al. 2005). 

During metamorphosis the skin becomes more keratinized, allowing the fungus to 

potentially spread to other parts of the body (Rachowicz et al. 2004, Berger et al. 2005, De 

Paula &amp;amp; Catão-Dias 2011). In adults, the infection induces skin hyperkeratosis and slough 

off (Berger et al. 1998). The hyperkeratosis alters proper osmotic regulation, causing some 

individuals to suffer from a hydroelectrolytic imbalance and subsequent death due to a 

heart attack (Voyles et al. 2009, Campbell et al. 2012).  



Chapter 2 

	

88	

 In Brazil, Bd has been recorded in species belonging to ten anuran families from 

the Atlantic Forest (Becker &amp;amp; Zamudio 2011, Carnaval et al. 2006, Grundler et al. 2012, 

De Paula &amp;amp; Catão-Dias 2011, Ron 2005, Schloegel et al. 2010, Toledo et al. 2006a, Toledo 

et al. 2006b). Ramalho (2015) recorded the first case of Bd in amphibians from the Cerrado 

and also for species of the endemic Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis group. These species 

occur in small geographic ranges at high altitudes (above 900m a.s.l.), and their tadpoles 

develop in low-temperature, fast-flowing streams and rivulets (Eterovick &amp;amp; Brandão 2001, 

Brandão et al. 2012). These traits may increase species susceptibility to chytrid infection 

(Rödder et al. 2009), as there are several reports of chytrid fungus causing infection of 

stream dwelling species (Piotrowski et al. 2004, Lips et al. 2003, La Marca et al. 2005). 

Climate conditions in the Cerrado seem suitable for the survival and spread of the 

pathogen, and some models have already predicted the occurrence of Bd in the biome 

(Ron, 2005, Toledo et al. 2006b). Thirteen species extant in the Cerrado have been found 

infected by Bd, although diagnoses were confirmed on populations from other biome. 

Hence, more Bd studies are urgent for this biome and potentially susceptible endemic 

species from rupestrian habitats. 

 

 

2.4.4 Cattle pastures 

 The Cerrado is host to 42% of the national bovine herd and 67% of the biome’s 

total cleared land has been used to set pastures. Native grasslands are clear-cut, burned and 

seeded with potentially invasive African grasses (Klink 1994) to form cattle pastures. Open 

area anurans are often seen as generalists with reproductive strategies adapted to harsh 

conditions (Haddad and Prado 2005) and some species may be resilient or even thrive in 

pastures. However, despite being regarded as innocuous and even beneficial to amphibians 

given the seemingly mild practices and presence of waterbodies used as breeding sites, 

studies on the effect of pastures on anurans are still insufficient to achieve that conclusion. 

 Silva, Candeira and Rossa-Feres (2011) evaluated which pond characteristics 

affected anuran species occurrence in farmland ponds located in a pasture matrix. They 

found 26 anuran species, but only Leptodactylus fuscus, E. nattereri, Pseudopaludicola 

falcipes and P. cuvieri were consistently found, whereas most species were recorded in 



The Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado 

89	

	

only one or two ponds. According to this study, anuran species richness in farmland ponds 

is mainly predicted by marginal vegetation height and other variables related to habitat 

heterogeneity that reflect the structural complexity of breeding sites. The occurrence of 

Boana albopunctata was associated with higher aquatic vegetation heterogeneity, whereas 

the occurrence of Elachistocleis cesarii was associated with a greater vegetation cover in 

the pond surface. The occurrence of E. nattereri was associated with lower aquatic 

vegetation inside the pond, whereas the occurrence of L. podicipinus was associated with 

taller marginal vegetation. Leptodactylus fuscus occurred mainly in ponds showing 

intermediate or permanent hydroperiods whereas P. falcipes was associated with large 

ponds and ponds with taller aquatic vegetation.  

 De Marco et al. (2013) investigated local and regional patterns of species richness 

in the Cerrado ponds and found that amphibians were affected by environmental gradients 

related to water parameters, being positively affected by increased chlorophyll, 

ammonium, pH, and electric conductivity and negatively affected by increased 

transparency, representing mainly the trophic state of the pond. Several studies previously 

conducted in tropical and temperate regions have found that anuran species richness is 

positively correlated with the amount and/or diversity of vegetation within ponds (Burne 

and Griffin 2005; Lichtenberg et al. 2006; Silva et al. 2011) and in pond margins (Hazell et 

al. 2004; Peltzer et al. 2006). The importance of marginal vegetation height for species 

richness is related to the greater diversity of microhabitats provided by different levels of 

vertical stratification, allowing a greater number of species to coexist. 

 Silva, Gibbs and Rossa-Feres (2011) evaluated the effects of environmental 

variables on anuran species richness and abundance in artificial temporary pools located in 

a pasture matrix. Although they recorded 27 anuran species, only P. cuvieri and L. fuscus 

were recorded in every pool, whereas most species were found in only one pool.   

Pools with longer hydroperiods and more aquatic vegetation supported higher species 

richness. In areas with long and intense dry seasons, unpredictable rainfall and predator 

pressure promote the use of long-term temporary habitats for amphibian reproduction. For 

most species, breeding occurs during the rainy season (October to March) so it is probably 

most advantageous to colonize temporary breeding pools with longer hydroperiod, where 

there are few predators, than to occupy either short-hydroperiod sites, such as breeding 

pools that may be free from predators but have high risk of desiccation, or permanent pools 



Chapter 2 

	

90	

with elevated numbers of predators (Wellborn et al. 1996). Aquatic vegetation was 

especially important for arboreal species that vocalize perched in the vegetation. Pools 

with more structural complexity may be more inviting for anuran reproduction because 

they offer more sites for calling, amplexus, and oviposition, as well as shelter for recently 

metamorphosed tadpoles and adults from predators (Shulse et al. 2010).  

 Distance from the pool to the nearest forest remnant was also determinant for some 

species, especially E. bicolor and E. nattereri, two small burrowing frogs that have low 

dispersal capacity (Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011). Discontinuity between suitable aquatic 

and terrestrial habitats, a phenomenon known as “habitat split”, forces many species with 

aquatic larvae into risky breeding migrations through disturbed environments (Becker et al. 

2010) and may result in population extinction. Forest fragments have been identified as 

important habitats, providing refuge for many arboreal and fossorial species (Hazell et al. 

2001) and enhancing landscape connectivity (Becker et al. 2010). Silva et al. (2012) 

studied the effect that landscape configuration had on anuran abundance and diversity in 

agro-savanna landscapes. The authors found that generalist species used both pasture and 

forest habitats and were forced to cross open habitats to reach cattle ponds to breed, despite 

the inherent risks of crossing pastures (Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006). Ponds closer to 

fragments had higher anuran abundance and species richness than those far from or even 

within forest fragments. This study indicates that landscape configuration has an important 

influence on anuran population viability in tropical agricultural landscapes  

 Silva and Rossa-Feres (2011) analyzed how anuran species richness varied in 

waterbodies located in a pasture matrix with increasing distance from forest fragments. 

They found that the dominant species were the same regardless of the pools’ distance from 

the forest fragments. However, species were more abundant and showed prolonged 

breeding activity in pools closer to forest fragments. Forest fragments facilitate anuran 

migration from breeding, to feeding and aestivating areas (Silva &amp;amp; Rossa-Feres 2007) and 

are increasingly important as altered environments may impair anuran movement (Becker 

et al. 2007). These results reinforce the importance of forest fragments even for open area 

breeders. Several temperate-zone studies recorded higher anuran richness in breeding pools 

near forest fragments than those without nearby forest fragments (Herrmann et al. 2005). 

In contrast to these studies, where species composition was a mix of forest-associated and 

open-habitat species, the species recorded by Silva and Rossa-Feres (2011) are typical of 



The Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado 

91	

	

open areas and tolerant to anthropogenic modifications (Duellman 1999). The higher 

temperature and lower soil moisture typical of open areas are known to restrict the 

occurrence of anurans, which experience higher rates of evaporative water loss and 

mortality due to desiccation or increased mortality from predators (Rothermel &amp;amp; Semlitsch 

2002). Consequently, proximity of breeding pools to forested patches and more suitable 

micro-climatic conditions enable some species to extend their breeding activity compared 

to breeding pools distant from them. These studies emphasize the importance of forest 

fragments and indicate that conserving these fragments is paramount for amphibian 

diversity and abundance in tropical agro-savanna landscapes, even for open area breeders. 

 

2.4.5 Hydroelectric exploration 

 River damming and the creation of large reservoirs are among the severest and 

most permanent human interferences on nature (Tundisi 1996). Flooding due to a 

hydroelectric dam causes habitat loss and fragmentation, population isolation, and 

reductions in species richness, abundance, and movement patterns. The Cerrado is the 

birthplace of the rivers that originate Brazil’s six main watersheds (Parnaíba, Paraná, 

Paraguai, Tocantins-Araguaia, São Francisco and Amazonas), making the biome’s 

potential for hydroelectric dams very high.  

 Although this is a much unaddressed issue, Brandão &amp;amp; Araújo (2008) studied 

changes on anuran abundance and richness caused by habitat loss and insularization during 

the flooding of the Serra da Mesa hydroelectric reservoir, in Central Brazil, created by the 

damming of Tocantins river. The enormous area flooded (178,000 ha) was previously 

covered by several phytophysiognomies but after complete flooding only 280 islands were 

formed by the isolation of hilltops. After complete flooding, only 11 of the 31 species 

originally found were still recorded on the site. R. schneideri, a large, abundant, and 

generalist species, commonly found in human-modified Cerrado habitats, almost 

disappeared from the islands during the following months. P. cuvieri and Rhinella 

granulosa were the most abundant species on the hills before flooding but showed 

significant declines in abundance after insularization. All amphibian species that depend 

on the availability of water bodies went extinct on the islands. Species that used gallery 

forests, previously present on the lowlands, went extinct as the gallery forests of the region 

were submerged. Despite the fact that most species of Serra da Mesa use lentic habitats, 



Chapter 2 

	

92	

the number of species found at the end of the study corresponds to less than 30 percent of 

the total number of species recorded in the region before dam formation.  

 It was expected that opportunistic species would be favored with the flooding and 

the creation of a new permanent aquatic environment. However, this study shows that 

hydroelectric reservoirs located in the Cerrado are not used by most anurans as 

reproductive sites. In fact, only R. schneideri used the lake for reproduction, while other 

generalist species were not observed breeding in the lake. Besides the presence of 

predatory fishes, the reservoirs of hydroelectric plants lack adequate structure for 

amphibian reproduction due to i) it’s large size and lack of physical barriers, strong waves, 

making anuran activity and egg adherence to substrates difficult; ii) it’s depth, leaving few 

suitable places for egg laying and tadpole development, which usually occur in shallow 

waters (Barreto &amp;amp; Moreira 1996) and iii) vegetation mortality at the edges, creating a strip 

of dead trees and exposed soil (Diamond 1972).  

 

2.5 Climate change and future prospects 

 The large-scale agricultural conversion of the Cerrado has direct consequences for 

habitat availability and suitability as well as other indirect and less conspicuous effects. 

Simulations of the effects of converting natural Cerrado into open grasslands on regional 

climate have shown reduced precipitation, an increase in the frequency of dry periods 

within the wet season, changes in albedo and increased mean surface air temperature 

(Hoffmann and Jackson 2000). 

 The synergy between climate change and habitat loss is perhaps the greatest threat 

to biodiversity (Drake et al. 2005, Canhos et al. 2008). This becomes apparent when 

considering the projected scenario of habitat degradation for 2050. If human occupation of 

the Cerrado continues northward, as expected, the proportion of remaining natural habitats 

will be rapidly reduced, which will lead to a great loss of biodiversity (Diniz-Filho et al. 

2009). In this case, only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will remain in northern 

Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. As populations are 

already reduced in size by isolation due to habitat loss, increased temperature and reduced 

rainfall could lead to the extinction of populations and species (Bickford et al. 2010). 



The Anurofauna of a vanishing savana: the case of the Brazilian Cerrado 

93	

	

 According to Silvano (2011), future climate will not be favorable to most Cerrado 

amphibians. Many species have restricted distributions, which increases the risks 

associated to climate change, since even relatively small changes may result in a reduction 

of their geographic distributions (Bush and Hooghiemstra 2005). In a realistic scenario, 

with a dispersal limit of 500 km around the biome, climate change should exert drastic 

effects on habitat suitability for amphibians. According to this author, most species will 

undergo more contraction than expansion of suitable areas in 2050. With an average of 

30% range loss, many species would be threatened with extinction. 

 A species’ ability to deal with disturbances and habitat fragmentation varies with 

its ecological and reproductive plasticity in the use of the altered habitats (Tocher et al. 

2001, Brandão and Araújo 2001, Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006). The ability a species has to 

disperse will determine if they will occupy shifting suitable areas in the future or simply 

disappear as their habitats are destroyed. Therefore, because amphibians are highly 

dependent on dispersal corridors in highly anthropogenic environments (Gibbs 1998), it is 

important to assure the integrity of corridors or suitable areas to their dispersion (Araújo et 

al. 2006) between distant habitats. The forecasted climate changes can also impair species 

migration, especially considering the speed and magnitude of their occurrence (Araújo et 

al. 2006). Few amphibian species are able to disperse, within 50 years, across the 170 km. 

Therefore, displacement of suitable areas is an additional concern for Cerrado amphibian 

conservation, since southeastern Brazil is precisely the most disturbed and densely 

populated areas in Brazil (Marini et al. 2009). Likewise, the current and predicted areas of 

highest amphibian richness in the Cerrado coincide with densely populated areas with 

advanced degrees of degradation. Diniz-Filho et al. (2009) investigated the effects of 

climate change on patterns of vertebrate diversity in the Brazilian Cerrado and found that 

species distribution expansions may include areas already being used for livestock. 

 According to Pacífico (2011), future global climatic changes will have a strong 

negative effect on the anurans endemic to the Cerrado, especially those with small 

potential actual distribution. Anurans with small distributions will have to disperse in order 

to survive the alterations occurring on their native areas. Thus, the ability to disperse is 

paramount for the resilience of a species in a rapidly changing environment (Trakhtenbrot 

et al. 2005). However, besides the intrinsic ability every anuran species has to disperse, 

there are structural barriers (large rivers, mountains) and anthropogenic activities that 



Chapter 2 

	

94	

cause landscape fragmentation. This synergy exacerbates the negative effects generated by 

the global climatic changes, especially for small distribution species. 

 

2.6 Conclusion 

 The world’s largest and most diverse savanna is currently under major agronomic 

pressure. Despite the scarcity of studies regarding the effects of agricultural activities on 

native anurans, we were able to draw some conclusions from the main studies mentioned 

on this review (Table 2.1).   

Commonly regarded as more resilient to disturbances than their forest counterparts, 

the anurofauna of the Cerrado is characterized by a series of life-history traits that may 

effectively render them more resistant to anthropogenic disturbances than Neotropical 

forest anurans. According to many studies, fossorial habits and specialized breeding 

structures such as foam nests might in fact be responsible for the resistance of some 

anurans in disturbed Cerrado habitats such as crops and pastures. However, much like what 

has been acknowledged in other biomes, these anthropogenic areas are dominated by 

widespread, generalist species. Hence, crops and pastures can harbor an anuran 

community, albeit strongly dominated by highly resilient species, favoring generalists and 

excluding specialists. Nonetheless, there is evidence that these generalist populations are in 

sub-optimal fitness conditions.  

Maintaining natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow 

depressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation in order to maximize the 

potential of agroecosystems to harbor diverse anuran communities. 

The anurofauna of the Cerrado is especially vulnerable to hydroelectric projects but 

the Brazilian government has been increasingly acknowledging the hydroelectric potential 

of the Cerrado, planning for the construction of more hydroelectric dams in a biome 

already largely converted into crops and pastures, putting the Cerrado’s remaining 

biodiversity in a especially precarious position.  

 It is urgent to direct the attention to the Brazilian savanna. The scientific 

community must help establish the Cerrado as a valuable biome with major ecological 

importance. Detailed demographic and community-level studies on Cerrado amphibians 

are badly needed, namely abundance and species richness studies for adult, juveniles and

larvae/eggs. Furthermore, studies approaching species loss from a functional (Tilman 

2001) and phylogenetic (Magurran 2005) point of view should be used as they allow a 

more thorough assessment of the effects on biodiversity, analyzing the changes in 

community composition. Invariably, as the Cerrado is transformed into the agricultural 

heart of Brazil, it is urgent to thoroughly assess the impacts on anuran communities, 

identify eventual threatened populations and develop efficient conservation policies in 

consonance with agricultural systems.

3.1. Abstract 
 Determining species extinction risk and its drivers is a major goal for conservation 

biology. The IUCN Red List is widely used for classifying extinction-risk and prioritizing 

conservation action. However, this system has been acknowledged as biased and 

complementary approaches are strongly recommended to achieve more reliable conclusions on 

conservation priorities. Species traits, often perceived as determinant for resiliency to 

disturbances, have been used to identify potentially vulnerable species, even when data are 

scarce (e.g. Data Deficient species). We provide an integrative and cost-effective framework 

for predicting species extinction-risk using data on 195 anurans from the Cerrado. We used 

IUCN population trend and expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration as response 

variables, to identify traits associated to increased extinction-risk. We used species traits, 

threat pressure and geographic range to determine which species and areas had higher 

conservation priority. We found the official extinction-risk to be underestimated, as many 

species categorized as LC or DD are actually sensitive and/or declining. We identified 

breeding site, habitat and clutch size as predictors of anuran extinction risk. We found that 

&gt;70% of the biome’s anurans have major protection gaps, incurring in high extinction-risk. 

The southwest and central region of the biome are the main hotspots for high extinction-risk

species and should be prioritized for conservation. Our framework may be particularly 

valuable to assess extinction-risk and prioritize conservation action regarding less studied taxa 

and regions with high anthropogenic pressure, but weak government support and scarce 

funding.

3.2. Introduction 
 Vulnerability to disturbance differs across species and many systems have been 

devised to determine extinction risk, aid in conservation planning and raise public awareness. 

The most prevalent of these systems is the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (henceforth 

“Red List”), developed by the Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union 

(IUCN; http://www.iucn.org). The Red List highlights species at greater risk of extinction, 

aiming to prioritize conservation action. The Red List classifies species based on quantitative 

data on population size and geographic range (IUCN, 2001). If population size or range have 

been shown to decline, species are classified as threatened (Critically Endangered (CR), 

Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU)). If threat criteria are not met, species are classified as 

not threatened (Near Threatened (NT), Least Concern (LC)) or, when there is no sufficient 

data for categorization, as Data Deficient (DD). The Red List has been paramount for 

establishing protection priorities and justifying conservation funding (Baillie et al., 2008; 

Mace and Baillie, 2007; Young et al., 2014). However, conservation status is more relative 

than absolute, in the sense that a classification of CR does not imply that the species is almost 

extinct, but only that it is in greater danger of becoming extinct - even if by stochastic events - 

compared to a species that is classified in any other category. 

 The Red List’s reliability stems from its criteria, which are objective and relatively 

easy to apply when adequate information is available (IUCN, 2001). These criteria were, 

however, defined based on the requirements of large vertebrate species, causing the system to 

be putatively biased towards larger and easily sampled taxa (Cardoso et al., 2011; Régnier et 

al., 2015; Triantis et al., 2010). Hence, even if enough information could be gathered, they 

may not be appropriate for many taxa. Furthermore, decade-long re-evaluation periods may 

render the Red List unable to detect shifts in extinction-risk for fast-declining species, further 

compromising its effectiveness. Despite its unarguable value for conservation, the Red List 

should not be used as the sole means of setting priorities for conservation measures (IUCN, 

2001). This recommendation is rarely appreciated and, due to the system’s importance in 

current conservation circles, its bias is often pervasive in species inventories (Cardoso et al., 

2011), reintroduction projects (Seddon et al., 2007), invasive species studies (Pyšek et al., 

2008), legally protected species lists and conservation funding (Cardoso et al., 2011).

Although there is a considerable degree of classification consistency, the Red List does not 

take into account species life histories, causing under- or over-estimated extinction-risks in 

certain cases (IUCN, 2001). Hence, threat category provides only a relative assessment of the 

extinction-risk under current circumstances, and should not be used in isolation. A system for 

assessing priorities for action should include numerous other factors concerning conservation 

action, such as biological characteristics of the subject, costs, logistics and chances of success 

(IUCN, 2001). 

 Our understanding of which species are most at risk remains poor, especially for 

inconspicuous taxa, for which natural histories have not been well documented and population 

changes are hard to detect (Cardoso et al., 2011). For example, according to the Red List, 32.4 

% of the world’s amphibians are threatened or extinct, and 24.4% are unclassified (DD), due 

to insufficient information (IUCN, 2008). Amphibians are among the least studied vertebrates 

when compared to birds and mammals (Hecnar, 2009), due to their inconspicuous nature and 

small size (Wells, 2007). In a highly anthropogenic world, with alarming climate change 

predictions and limited funding for conservation, it is vital to develop more accurate and case-

specific frameworks to prioritize conservation actions and aid mitigation. 

 Differences in species extinction risk have been partially attributed to variation in 

biological traits (Pearson et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2012). Indeed, habitat preferences, 

ecological traits and demographic characteristics have been successfully used to predict 

species’ extinction risk (e.g. Cardillo et al., 2005; Davies et al., 2004; Lee and Jetz, 2011; 

Pearson et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding how species traits interact to determine 

extinction-risk may help identify species at greater risk and prompt cost-effective and timely 

conservation measures. 

 Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators and 

prey, and enabling nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems (Blaustein et al., 

2011; Wells, 2007). Furthermore, amphibians are among the most diverse and abundant 

vertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding strategies and dispersal 

abilities (Wells, 2007). Due to their biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic 

physiology, amphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its 

change (Niemi and McDonald, 2004). Hence, amphibian extinction risk can be used as a

surrogate for ecosystem resilience (Davic and Welsh, 2004) and a suitable model for 

conceiving a new framework to informatively predict extinction risk. 

 The Cerrado is the world’s largest and most biodiverse savanna. It is also Brazil’s new 

agricultural frontier, hosting the country’s largest bovine herd and a percentage of crop area 

larger than that of the Amazon. About 40% of the biome has been converted into crops and 

pastures (Sano et al., 2010) and only 6.48% is under protection (Arruda et al., 2008; Overbeck 

et al., 2015). The anuran assemblage of this biome has high endemicity (ca. 50%) (Valdujo et 

al., 2012), but low official extinction risk, as only 3 amphibians are considered threatened 

(IUCN, 2014, MMA, 2014), while 22% remain Data Deficient. Discrepancy between low 

extinction risk, high endemicity (Valdujo et al., 2012) and intense anthropogenic pressure may 

be explained by historical biases towards Neotropical forest biomes, such as the Amazon or 

the Atlantic Forest. For example, sixteen Atlantic Forest anurans are threatened, but a Web of 

Science (apps.webofknowledge.com, accessed on April 2015) search using ‘‘Atlantic Forest’’ 

or ‘‘Cerrado’’ in combination with “amphibians” retrieved 3 times more journal articles on the 

Atlantic Forest than on the Cerrado. 

 With the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressure on biomes worldwide, many species 

may be unrecognizably endangered. There is a need for integrative, predictive and spatially 

explicit models capable of accurately identifying species at higher risk, evaluating the 

consequences of disturbances for biodiversity and guiding conservation actions, especially in 

biodiverse, highly disturbed and scarcely studied regions. Herein we assess amphibian 

extinction risk and identify its drivers in a highly disturbed biodiversity hotspot. We propose 

an integrative and cost-effective method for accurately assessing and predicting extinction 

risk, considering species rarity, threat pressure and trait-based vulnerability to disturbances. 

We compiled an extensive database with 12 biological traits (e.g., activity, habits) and 4 

variables describing threat pressure (e.g., percentage of a species’ range occupied by crops) for 

195 Cerrado anurans. First, to identify traits associated to increased extinction risk across 

species, we used two proxies for extinction risk as response variables: IUCN population trend 

and expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration. This analysis allowed us then to (i) 

predict population decline and vulnerability to habitat alteration for every species; (ii) use our 

results to calculate integrative species-specific conservation targets; (iii) perform a gap

	 131	

analysis to evaluate how effective the network of the biome’s protected areas (PA) is, and 

which are the species with more urgent conservation needs, and (iv) build maps representing 

areas with increased extinction-risk. 

 

3.3. Methods 

3.3.1. Data collection 

 We compiled intrinsic biological traits and extrinsic environmental variables for 195 

species of anurans extant in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used the species list from Valdujo et al. 

(2012) and crossed it with the IUCN distribution maps (IUCN, 2008). This data crossing 

motivated us to exclude species for which we could not find satisfactory distribution maps, 

and include others not considered by Valdujo et al. (2012), with mapped occurrence in the 

Cerrado. The biological traits we considered for this study were anuran activity, adult snout-

vent length (SVL), geographic range size, habitat, habit, fossorial behavior, breeding site, 

breeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season and breeding pattern. We also 

considered 4 variables quantifying extrinsic environmental variables, namely the percentage of 

range area in Cerrado, and percentage of natural vegetation, crops and pastures within each 

species' geographic range in the Cerrado (Table A1, Supplementary material). Trait data were 

compiled from the literature, AmphibiaWeb and IUCN online databases. If published data 

were unavailable, we relied on expert opinion. External threats were quantified using species 

distribution maps (IUCN, 2008) and a shapefile of land use in the Cerrado (e.g., agriculture, 

urban areas) provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (MMA, 2007). We 

determined the percentage of each species’ range occupied by crops, pastures and natural 

vegetation using program QGIS v.2.6.1 Brighton. Predictor variables were chosen based on 

our perception of their importance for determining species responses to anthropogenic 

disturbances, and also on data availability. 

 To identify which traits are associated with increased extinction risk across species, we 

used two proxies for extinction risk obtained from the IUCN Red List online database, as 

response variables. Due to the relatively low percentage of threatened amphibians (CR, VU, 

EN) among the 195 known from the Cerrado, we used other two variables provided by IUCN: 

(i) population trend, and (ii) expert-perceived vulnerability to habitat alteration. Both 



An integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing 

	 132	

population trend and expert-perceived vulnerability were obtained from each species’ fact 

sheet on the IUCN Red List database. This information is based on empirical data collected by 

experts. Population trend is categorized as declining (D), stable (S), increasing (I) or unknown 

(U). According to this variable, 13% of the species have declining populations, 58% have 

stable populations and 26% have unknown population trends. Expert-perceived species 

vulnerability to habitat alteration was gathered from uncategorized information given by 

experts based on their empirical field experience on how often a species is found in disturbed 

areas. We considered a species either tolerant to habitat alteration (T) if it is commonly found 

in disturbed areas, sensitive (S) if it tends to disappear after disturbances, or unknown (U). The 

IUCN online database has information on each species’ vulnerability to habitat alteration for 

most cases. When this was omitted we searched the literature and, if necessary, contacted the 

species assessor(s) credited on the factsheet. We contacted over 20 experts for clarifying both 

trait and vulnerability uncertainties. Experts contacted were based on institutions ranging from 

the states of Bahia, to Goiás and São Paulo. Only when we could not get information from any 

of these sources, we would classify species vulnerability to habitat alteration as unknown. 

According to this variable, 23% of the anurans occurring in the Cerrado are sensitive to habitat 

alteration, whereas 46% are considered tolerant and 30% of the species have unknown 

sensitivity to habitat alteration. 

 

3.3.2. Data analysis 

 Machine learning techniques are a powerful alternative to traditional linear models and 

have documented advantages for extinction risk analyses, especially when the goal is 

predictive accuracy (Davidson et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2011). Classification-tree models 

identify nonlinear, context-dependent associations among multiple correlated predictor 

variables (Olden et al., 2008). These methods do not assume a specific distribution of 

predictor variables or data independence, avoiding concerns about pseudoreplication and 

alleviating the need for phylogenetic control (Bielby et al., 2009). 

 To identify which traits and/or external threats were associated with increased 

extinction risk measured by (i) population trend and (ii) expert-perceived vulnerability to 

habitat alteration, we used random forest models. This approach combines the predictions of 



An integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing 

	 133	

many independent decision-tree models to produce a robust classification (Breiman, 2001), 

determine predictor importance and predict vulnerability and population trend for each 

species, especially those for which information is unknown. However, because random forest 

models cannot graphically represent how each trait influences population decline and species 

vulnerability, we also used traditional decision-tree models for that purpose. 

 We assessed model accuracy through the percentage of species correctly classified 

(PCC), the percentage of species not threatened that are correctly classified (specificity), the 

percentage of threatened species that are correctly classified (sensitivity), and Cohen’s kappa, 

which measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative items between two classifications. 

Cohen’s kappa is considered more robust than percent agreement calculations, since it 

accounts for the agreement occurring by chance. We calculated Cohen's kappa statistics for 

agreement and further tested the null-hypothesis that the extent of agreement is random (kappa 

statistic equals zero) using package irr (Gamer, 2015) on program R v.3.1.2 (R Core Team 

2014). We built random forest and classification-tree models using packages randomForest 

(Liaw and Wiener, 2015) and rpart (Therneau and Atkinson, 2012) also on program R. 

Classification trees are built by repeatedly partitioning the dataset into a nested series of 

mutually exclusive groups, each group as homogenous as possible regarding the response 

variable, according to the mean decrease in accuracy (Liaw and Wiener, 2015). Branches are 

afterwards pruned by 10-fold cross-validation to produce an “optimal tree”, balancing 

complexity (i.e., number of nodes) with prediction accuracy. The smallest tree with an error 

rate within 1 standard error of the minimum-error tree is taken as the most parsimonious tree, 

the “optimal tree”. 

 Although decision-tree models do not assume data points to be independent, alleviating 

the need to “correct” for phylogenetic relationships between species, we used a taxonomic 

variable (family) to evaluate the role of taxonomy in population trend and expert-perceived 

vulnerability. 

 To visualize how vulnerability to habitat alteration and population trend is 

geographically distributed, we created heatmaps of high extinction risk zones by overlapping 

geographic ranges of anuran species with traits identified as vulnerability- or decreasing-prone 

by our models using program QGIS v.2.6.1 Brighton.

	 134	

 To evaluate the conservation efficiency of the Cerrado PA network, we performed a 

gap analysis. Gap analysis is a version of the well-established method of identifying gaps in 

the representation of biodiversity in management areas (Scott et al., 1993). Digital map 

overlays are used in GIS environment to identify individual species, species-rich areas, and 

vegetation types that are underrepresented (Scott et al., 1993). Gap analysis is considered one 

of the most successful tools for detecting whether a PA system adequately protects a given 

species or assemblage, requiring: (i) an estimate of its distribution in the region, (ii) the 

identification of protected sites, and (iii) the definition of explicit conservation targets 

necessary to ensure acceptably small extinction risks (Pressey et al., 2003). Conservation 

targets represent the minimum amount of a particular biodiversity feature (e.g., habitat type) 

that should be conserved through conservation actions (Carwardine et al., 2009). The most 

commonly used targets in conservation are equivalent for all species (Urbina-Cardona and 

Flores-Villela, 2010) or for groups of species with equivalent distributions (Catullo et al., 

2008; Marini et al., 2009). These can favor widespread species (Vimal et al., 2011), failing to 

acknowledge that some may require more extensive protection than others (Pressey et al., 

2003). We adopted a specific approach based on (i) species’ geographic range, resulting in 

larger targets for species with smaller distributions, and recognizing the increased risks that 

extensive impacts present for unprotected portions of their distributions (Pressey et al., 2003); 

(ii) susceptibility, accounting for the percentage of habitat loss and an estimate of extinction 

threat, represented by species population trend and vulnerability previously predicted, and (iii) 

life-history, accounting for life-history traits previously identified as determinant for 

decreasing population trend or increased vulnerability: breeding site; habitat; clutch size and 

body size. 

 Geographic range (GR), susceptibility (SU) and life-history (LH) components were 

calculated as shown in de Novaes e Silva et al. (2014). Species sensitive to habitat alteration 

are expected to have increased need for protection, to avoid high exposure to disturbances. 

Hence, we ranked the SU component as 1 for sensitive, 0.1 for tolerant, or 1 for decreasing 

and 0.1 for stable. This ensured that susceptible species were attributed higher conservation 

targets. For the LH component, accounting for life-history (biological traits), we used the 

outputs from our random forest and classification trees models to assign values and relative

	 135	

importance to each trait and respective attribute. To input trait importance for extinction-risk 

and, therefore, conservation target, we used the mean accuracy decrease value. This represents 

the relative importance of each predictor for vulnerability and population trend, measured by 

the reduction in classification accuracy upon removal of each trait in a set of 2000 random 

forest trees. To input trait attribute importance, we used the results form our classification tree 

model to define which attribute was more associated to increased extinction-risk. For example, 

for breeding site we used 22.5 to input trait relative importance, and attributed different values 

according to association to lotic (1) or lentic (0.3) breeding sites, as association to lotic 

environments was a predictor of increased vulnerability in our classification tree models. This 

way, a species with lotic breeding habits will have increased conservation targets compared to 

a pond breeding species, due to our predictions of increased extinction risk for the previous. 

The other three more important traits were accordingly classified, and the values summed to 

describe species sensitivity due to life-history traits. 

 To calculate conservation targets, we weighted the GR component twice as much as 

the other two criteria, to avoid putting too much emphasis on the conservation of widespread 

species and also recognizing the prominent role of range size in determining the risk of 

extinction (Harnik et al., 2012). We tuned the formula so that a minimum theoretical value of 

about 10% of every species’ pristine range was guaranteed, a value that has been widely used 

as a uniform target (de Novaes e Silva et al., 2014; Pressey et al., 2003). We calculated the 

conservation target for each species i as: 

 

!	# = 0.065 + 0.1+,# + 0.05-.# + 0.05/0#, 
	

where GR is geographic range, SU is susceptibility (population trend/vulnerability), and LH is 

sensitivity due to life-history traits. 

 We conducted a global sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of uncertainty in 

model input upon the uncertainty in model output (Saltelli, 2002), generating 10,000 samples 

from the 3-dimensional parameter space (GR, SU, LH) using the Latin Hypercube Sampling 

and assuming a uniform distribution for each parameter, with package pse (Chalom and Prado, 

2014) on program R. Using maps of the Cerrado’s PA network (MMA, 2007), we also

	 136	

quantified the percentage of target area currently under protection for each species, 

considering species with ? 50% of the target achieved as minor gaps and those with &amp;lt;50% of 

the target achieved as major gaps. 

  

 Our framework is composed of 3 steps, initially requiring (i) proxies for extinction-risk 

obtained mostly from the IUCN online database, (ii) data on 12 biological traits, (iii) 

distribution maps for every species and (iv) quantification of threat pressure on each species’ 

range. In a second step, we analyze this data using random forest and classification tree 

models, to (i) identify traits associated to increased extinction-risk and (ii) predict population 

trend and vulnerability to habitat alteration for every species, including species for which there 

is no information on those parameters. In the final step of the framework, we use (i) the traits 

associated to increased extinction risk, (ii) species’ geographic range and (iii) predicted 

susceptibility (population trend and vulnerability) to calculate conservation targets and 

identify high priority species and areas (Fig. 3.1).

3.4. Results 
 Classification accuracy of the random forest model was high (PCC = 77%, Cohen’s 

kappa = 0.32, p = 0.001). Breeding site was the most important predictor of vulnerability (Fig. 

3.2), though total geographic range, % Cerrado range, habitat, clutch size, breeding strategy 

and SVL were also important (Fig. 3.3). The optimal classification tree predicted amphibian 

vulnerability with 79% accuracy (PCC, Cohen’s kappa = 0.54, p &amp;lt;0.001). Regarding 

population trends, classification accuracy of the random forest model was high (PCC 83.3%, 

Cohen’s kappa = 0.34, p &amp;lt;0.001) and similar to the optimal classification-tree model. Because 

the difference between the two most parsimonious trees was very small, we choose two 

classification trees for graphical representation, the “optimal classification tree” and the 

“second-optimal classification tree” for graphical representation. Despite high model

Our classification trees allow us to visualize the importance of each trait and respective 

attributes in determining species vulnerability and population trend. Regarding vulnerability, 

the first major split in the optimal tree separates anurans that have stream-associated breeding 

strategies from the rest, mostly pond breeders (Fig. 3.3).

sensitive to habitat alteration, but 67% of the anurans with broader ranges, larger than 51 mm 

SVL and with clutches smaller than 685 eggs are also vulnerable to habitat alteration. 

 Breeding site was the best predictor of population trends (Fig. 3.2), although habitat, % 

of pasture area inside the geographic range and range in the Cerrado were also important. The 

“optimal” decision tree indicated that only taxonomic family predicted population trend, 

although the “second-optimal” decision tree indicated that breeding site and habitat predicted 

population trends (Fig. 3.4). Seventy percent of anurans belonging to Brachycephalidae, 

Centrolenidae, Ceratophryidae, Craugastoridae and Hylodidae have decreasing populations 

(Fig. 3.4A). Breeding site is also important for predicting decreasing population trends; 52% 

of stream-breeding species have decreasing populations (Fig. 3.4B). This model indicates that 

habitat acts along with breeding site, resulting in 73% of the stream-breeding species from 

forests or rupestrian fields having decreasing populations. 

 About 41% of the species considered sensitive to habitat modification according to the 

information gathered from the IUCN Red List online database are considered DD by IUCN, 

55% LC and only 3.6% are considered threatened (EN, VU or CR) (Table 1). About 77% of 

the species with verified decreasing population trends are considered LC, 11% as DD and 

7.7% as threatened. The fact that most species considered decreasing are currently categorized 

as LC, suggests that the Red List may indeed be underestimating the extinction risk of the 

Cerrado anurans. We compared vulnerability gathered from the Red List online database to the 

vulnerability predicted by our model and found original and predicted vulnerability to be 

similar regarding distribution along Red List statuses. About 41% of decreasing species are 

listed as DD, 53% as LC and only 5.8% as threatened (Table 1). Considering every species 

listed as DD, 65% are predicted as sensitive, 11% as decreasing and 17% as sensitive and 

decreasing (Table A2, Supplementary material). 

 According to our heatmaps, anurans sensitive to habitat alteration appear more densely 

concentrated in the center of the Cerrado, and in other smaller and more isolated areas in the 

southwestern region (Fig. 3.5A). Likewise, decreasing species are also concentrated in the 

center of the Cerrado (Fig. 3.5B). 

 The global sensitivity analysis revealed a null expectation of 21.7 ± 2.3% for the 

conservation target (Ti). As such, and considering the range of observed values, only those

species with Ti larger than 25.5, deviated significantly from the null expectation (Z-test, p &amp;lt;

0.05) (Table A3, Supplementary material). These species are experiencing a higher extinction 

risk than expected by chance, given the model constraints. According to our conservation 

targets, 141 anuran species currently are major conservation gaps, i.e., the percentage of the 

species range under protection corresponds to less than 50% of its conservation targets, while 

only 29 species are protected.

3.5. Discussion 
 Our study demonstrates that the most vulnerable anurans in the Brazilian Cerrado are a 

highly non-random subset of the assemblage regarding certain biological traits. Using two 

proxies for extinction risk (population trend and expert-perceived vulnerability), we were able 

to identify lotic breeders and habitat specialists with small clutches, large body sizes and small 

geographic ranges as those associated with increased risk of extinction. 

 The traits we found associated with increased extinction risk corroborate several other 

studies regarding a wide array of taxa (Murray et al., 2011; Olden et al., 2007; Siliceo and 

Díaz, 2010; Sodhi et al., 2008; Tomiya, 2013). Compared to generalists, specialists are 

considered less capable of dealing with new environmental challenges (e.g., habitat loss, 

climate change) because they are often unable to persist outside of their narrow range of 

preferred conditions (Murray et al., 2011). Lotic breeding habits, habitat specialization, small 

clutches, large body size and small geographic range have all been acknowledged as 

surrogates for higher degrees of specialization on multiple taxa (Prado and Haddad, 2005; 

Sagot and Chaverri, 2015; Siliceo and Díaz, 2010; Wells, 2007). Stream-breeding species 

appear particularly sensitive to habitat alteration, which is not a new finding. Stream-dwelling 

larvae are highly specialized in microhabitat use for foraging and cover. Specialization can 

render species susceptible to even minor environmental changes altering their ability to seek 

cover or forage (Welsh and Ollivier, 1998). We found that stream-breeding species with small 

clutches are especially sensitive to habitat alteration, which has not been previously reported. 

Cooper et al. (2008) found that clutch size is a significant component of geographical range 

size, while Hero et al. (2005) suggested that more fecund species might have greater potential 

to spread to new areas and occupy large geographical ranges. If larger clutches are related to 

larger ranges, higher dispersal ability and colonization success in amphibians, smaller clutches 

may render species more susceptible to stochastic events and anthropogenic activities, 

resulting in increased sensitivity to habitat alteration (Grafe et al., 2004; Pounds et al., 2006). 

 Range size was a predictor of species vulnerability to habitat alteration, especially for 

pond breeders. These results corroborate previous findings that small geographical range 

correlates with population decline or extinction risk in frogs (Botts et al., 2013; Sodhi et al., 



An integrated trait-based framewok to predict extintion risk and guide conservation planing

2008). Anurans with small ranges may be more vulnerable than those with larger ranges 

because they are at greater risk from activities affecting their entire range. For example, 

several endemic amphibians of Central America with narrow ranges have declined, leading to 

increased IUCN Red List status (e.g. Atelopus spp.), and possibly even extinction (e.g. Incilius 

periglenes). Widespread species exposed to the same threats may decline locally, but not 

enough throughout their range to increase their extinction risk. Furthermore, species with 

restricted ranges are often specialists, which has been associated with declines in several taxa 

(Clavel et al., 2011) including frogs (Cooper et al., 2008). Narrow tolerance to environmental 

conditions makes species highly susceptible to climatic change or fluctuations (Murray and 

Hose, 2005). 

 Large body size has been found to correlate with population declines in mammals 

(Tomiya, 2013), birds (Owens and Bennett, 2000) and amphibians (Lips et al., 2003). Lips et 

al. (2003) suggested that body size might regulate population density. For example, large-

bodied frogs would be at a disadvantage because, all else being equal, they would have a 

lower density than small frogs and, since population density may influence population 

survival, larger frogs might be less resilient to habitat alteration. Considering the interaction 

with clutch size, species with larger body sizes but average-size clutches may not reach a 

density that ensures survival if habitat disturbances occur. 

 Family was identified as the main predictor of decreasing population trends. Lotic 

breeding habits and association with forest or rupestrian habitats were also important 

predictors of population decline. The 5 families with increased probability of population 

decline are associated with forest habitats and/or have lotic breeding habits. While these 

associations have already been explained in relation to vulnerability, the fact that taxonomy 

played the most important part in this model may be masking a bias of the scientific 

community towards forest-associated amphibians, since this proxy was derived from 

quantitative data more widely available from forest species. González-Suárez et al. (2012) 

identified biases in the spatial distribution of data availability, especially in the diverse tropics, 

where disparity in data availability was greater among species. The authors found published 

studies focused on a small group of species, often those easily sampled or more attractive. 

Multivariate analyses that consider several traits associated with vulnerability to extinction are

likely limited to a skewed subset of species that may not be representative of the whole 

ensemble. Although this does not imply that all comparative analyses are mistaken or 

erroneous, it must be used to motivate more unbiased data gathering. 

 Intrinsic traits were strong predictors of extinction risk, while variables describing 

direct human impacts apparently had no effect on extinction risk. One plausible explanation 

for this finding is that populations of threatened species may have already been extirpated 

from the most disturbed habitats before assessments occurred (Cardillo et al., 2005; Tingley et 

al., 2013). Another possibility is that detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities have 

broad, across-species consequences, being detrimental to all species. In this case, variables 

describing human impacts are not identified as mediators of extinction risk because they affect 

a wide range of species. 

 The Red List is often used as the main tool for setting priorities for conservation 

measures. Although the system is valuable and reliable, it has its limitations, and may under- 

or over-estimate extinction risk for certain taxa (IUCN, 2001), rendering the category of threat 

insufficient to determine conservation priorities. Other aspects, such as biological 

characteristics of the subject, should be considered during this process (IUCN, 2001). There is 

a need for integrative, predictive and spatially-explicit frameworks capable of accurately 

identifying species at higher risk, evaluating the consequences of disturbances for biodiversity 

and guiding conservation actions, especially in biodiverse, highly disturbed and scarcely 

studied regions. 

 Our study suggests that the extinction risk of amphibians worldwide may be severely 

underestimated, especially in scarcely studied and highly anthropogenic biomes. We found 

that a large proportion of species predicted as sensitive and/or decreasing is currently listed as 

LC or DD by the Red List. This corroborates previous studies regarding other taxa; smaller, 

unpopular and inconspicuous species may be severely unacknowledged by the world’s leading 

extinction risk classification system, despite their often pivotal importance for ecosystem 

functioning. Bland et al. (2014) found that 64% of the world’s mammals categorized as DD 

were actually predicted as threatened and Butchart and Bird (2010) and Morais et al. (2013) 

underscored the urgency to consider DD species as priorities for studies. In fact, DD 

amphibians are likely to be more threatened with extinction than their fully assessed

	 147	

counterparts (Howard and Bickford, 2014). Given their importance for ecosystem functioning 

and the intrinsic difficulties in studying amphibians, predictive integrative trait-based analyses 

may give us insight into impending declines and prioritize regions for scientific projects or 

conservation actions. 

 About 70% of the species analyzed are major conservation gaps, while only 29 species 

are sufficiently protected. The center of the Cerrado is the biome’s main hotspot for high 

extinction-risk anurans, which may be partially explained by the high concentration of narrow 

endemics in mountainous regions, such as Serra do Cipó (e.g., Bokermannohyla saxicola and 

Hypsiboas cipoensis), Serra do Cabral (e.g., Scinax cabralensis), Serra da Canastra (e.g., 

Bokermannohyla ibitiguara and Scinax maracaya), Chapada dos Veadeiros (e.g., Hypsiboas 

ericae and Leptodactylus tapiti), and Chapada dos Guimarães (e.g., Phyllomedusa centralis, 

Pristimantis crepitans) (Valdujo et al., 2012). A further explanation may be the historical 

human occupation of that region, coupled with the inadequacy of the local PA network. We 

conclude that the extinction risk of the Cerrado anurans appears severely underestimated, and 

the current PA network is insufficient to protect at least 50% of the minimum area required for 

ensuring the protection of 141 species. Bokermannohyla ibitiguara, Bokermannohyla 

izecksohni, Elachistocleis bumbameuboi, Hypsiboas ericae, Pristimantis crepitans, 

Proceratophrys moratoi, Phyllomedusa oreades, Rhinella scitula, and Scinax cabralensis have 

especially high conservation needs, and&amp;lt;10% of their conservation target achieved. These 

species are concentrated mainly in the southwest and central regions of the biome. Hence, we 

recommend that these species and regions in particular be prioritized for conservation actions 

in the Cerrado. 

 Our results provide novel insights into factors that lead to a high risk of extinction in 

anurans, highlighting the usefulness of an integrative framework for making predictions 

regarding the likelihood of future population declines. This study underscores the urgency of 

taking more specific and integrative approaches, considering species ecology and landscape 

metrics with powerful quantitative tools to unveil the patterns that lead to extinction, and use 

those results to guide conservation and management policies. The cost-effective approach we 

present may be of special value for biodiverse regions, with strong anthropogenic pressure, but 

weak government support and scarce funding for conservation actions. Brazil is currently

experiencing extremely high economic demands, and after long decades of raising public 

awareness to the importance of protecting the Amazon rainforest, other biomes have been 

targeted to fulfill the high social and economic exigencies (Allan, 2003). Non-forest biomes, 

such as the Cerrado, have been neglected, even though they cover large parts of the country 

and have biodiversity levels comparable to forests (Overbeck et al., 2015). To avoid losing 

much of its biodiversity and ecosystem services, conservation and sustainable land use 

policies in Brazil need to be extended to non-forest biomes, encompassing the creation of new 

large protected areas, the reinforcement of legal restrictions of land use; extension of subsidy 

programs and governance commitments to non-forest biomes; and the improvement of 

ecosystem monitoring, management and sustainable use in non-forest biomes (Overbeck et al., 

2015). Indeed, if Brazil manages to extend its conservation successes to non-forest biomes, it 

not only would contribute significantly to conservation of its biodiversity, but also could take 

the lead in conservation of non-forest biomes worldwide. Frameworks such as ours may shed 

light into which areas and species need more protection and what is the minimum protection 

each species needs to endure. These practical approaches may be vital in prioritizing 

conservation actions in the most neglected non-forest biomes. However, these efforts should 

be accompanied by substantial increases in coordinated research on the long-term monitoring 

of amphibian populations and collection of life history and ecological data to further 

understand species declines and mitigate current threats. 

 

3.6. Conclusion 
 The extinction risk of certain taxa and biomes is possibly underestimated worldwide. 

This may be especially dangerous for highly sensitive taxa from highly diverse but 

anthropogenic regions. Although the value of the Red List is unquestionable, its generalist 

character requires the use of other complementary approaches to accurately assess and predict 

extinction risk, to prioritize conservation actions. The Red List very clearly warns of the 

system’s limitations, stating that it should not be used as the sole instrument for approaching 

conservation prioritization. Our study shows that adopting an integrative specific approach to 

evaluate extinction risk, using species traits in association with threat exposure, may be an 

accurate and cost-effective framework. We do not intend to suggest transformations to the Red

List, but rather motivate the use of holistic, informed and more specific approaches, that 

capitalize the Red List’s value and ensure successful outcomes, especially for biodiversity 

hotspots. Planning and implementing conservation actions takes large amounts of time, effort 

and funding. The framework we presented may be particularly valuable to prioritizing 

conservation actions in biomes with important conservation value, high human pressure and 

low funding.

4.1. Abstract 
 Agricultural expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the 

megadiverse tropics. Rice is the world’s most important food crop, but the effects of 

habitat conversion to rice crops on biodiversity have not been consensual. Nonetheless, 

given its nature, location and extension worldwide, irrigated rice fields are invariably used 

by the native fauna. Here we conduct an integrative evaluation of the effects habitat 

conversion to irrigated rice crops has on anuran communities in a Cerrado-Amazon 

ecotone. We found that habitat conversion and agricultural management caused profound 

alterations to the anuran community, namely dramatic loss of species diversity and 

functional richness with increased functional divergence. Community composition was 

altered, with dominance by generalist and low representation of specialist. Anuran 

communities in rice fields exhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean 

phylogenetic distance, with increased mean nearest phylogenetic distance. Agricultural 

communities are composed of phylogenetically related species. Nonetheless, taxonomic 

diversity did not vary significantly, suggesting that it should not be used without 

complementary metrics. We found small geographic ranges, habitat specialization, small

clutches and large body size to be associated with low species abundances in rice fields. 

Frogs from crops exhibited lower body condition across guilds, indicating reduced fitness 

and suggesting that reproductive output and survival may be impaired in these 

communities. Understanding how communities are altered by human activities will allow 

better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use. Maintaining high 

levels of diversity in anthropogenic environments is important for ecosystem resilience 

because diverse communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of 

contributing to a single ecological function. Conversion of Neotropical natural vegetation 

to vast irrigated rice crops results in the extinction of large subsets of species irrespective 

of their specialization, with even the more resilient generalists exhibiting lower body 

condition. Neotropical rice crops appear unable to support functionally and 

phylogenetically diverse, healthy communities, contributing to lower ecosystem resilience 

and dramatic implications for global ecology, economy and public health. 

 
Keywords: Neotropics, Amphibians, Agriculture, Functional diversity, Phylogenetic 
diversity.

4.2. Introduction 
 Deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the megadiverse 

Neotropics, where it is mainly caused by agricultural expansion (García-Barrios et al., 

2009). Agriculture and cattle farming are known to cause extensive and complex 

alterations to communities and ecosystems (Frishkoff et al., 2014; Williams-Guillén and 

Perfecto, 2010). For example, several studies have reported negative effects of habitat 

conversion to irrigated rice crops on biodiversity (e.g. Attademo et al. 2011; Hyne et al. 

2009; Maximiliano Attademo et al. 2015). However, these agricultural wetlands have also 

been considered valuable for birds and amphibians (Bambaradeniya and Amarasinghe, 

2004; Czech and Parsons, 2002; Elphick and Oring, 2003; Lepš et al., 2006) and even 

functional equivalents to natural wetlands.  

 Wetlands are important breeding habitats for many amphibian species and irrigated 

rice fields are invariably used by local amphibians to forage and reproduce. Due to their 

biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, amphibians are 

very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change (Niemi and 

McDonald, 2004). They play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both 

predators and prey, enable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and 

are among the most diverse and abundant vertebrates, especially in the Neotropics. 

Amphibians can hence be used as reliable surrogates to evaluate the effects of human 

disturbances on whole communities and ecosystems (Davic and Welsh, 2004). 

 Rice is the world’s most important food crop, occupying 11% of the world’s total 

arable land (Guimarães, 2009). Asian countries are responsible for 90% of the world’s rice 

production, while Latin America and the Caribbean produce 4.1%, half of which comes 

solely from Brazil (FAO, 2011). Given the extension and location of rice fields worldwide, 

determining if these agricultural wetlands can function adequately to maintain biodiverse 

and healthy communities is of the utmost concern. This takes special significance in the 

Neotropics, where rice production meets important social and economic demands and 

biodiversity is especially high and unique.  

 The effects of anthropogenic landscape modification are complex, often involving 

the rise of new environmental, compositional and configurational conditions that affect 

biodiversity. This concept, defined as environmental filtering, suggests that the 

environment acts as a filter, favoring certain species with particular traits over others 



Chapter 4 

	 180	

(Keddy 1992; Weiher &amp;amp; Keddy 1995; Mayfield et al. 2005; Lebrija-Trejos et al. 2010). 

The environmental filters arisen as a consequence of disturbances often favor generalist 

species while creating communities with species richness similar and even higher to that of 

pristine environments. General patterns of environmental filtering have been identified for 

birds, plants, and freshwater organisms. Traits such as body size, leaf area and geographic 

range have been identified as determinant for species resiliency to disturbances 

(Lindenmayer &amp;amp; Montague-Drake 2008, McIntyre 2008, Poff 1997). Environmental 

filtering may hold great promise as a predictive framework to assist conservation planning 

and management of anthropogenic environments directed at favoring species with 

particular traits associated with decreased resilience (Hanspach, 2012).  

 Species richness metrics rely on the erroneous assumption that all species are equal, 

i.e., only relative abundances establish the relative importance of species in communities 

and ecosystems (Magurran, 2004). In fact, some species carry more evolutionary history or 

functional traits essential to ecosystem processes than others (Cadotte et al., 2010; 

Mouillot et al., 2013a). Nonetheless, most studies addressing community assembly in 

human-modified landscapes rely on simplistic taxonomic metrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich, 

2010) and leave important ecosystem-level consequences unaddressed. Because the 

complex effects of environmental variation induced by human activities on species is 

ultimately mediated by specific characteristics (e.g. physiological constraints, habitat 

requirements, dispersal abilities), considering only taxonomic metrics may fail to provide 

accurate conclusions on the real consequences of anthropization on biodiversity. To attain 

more representative conclusions on the effects human activities have on communities, we 

must go beyond species number and account for different components of biodiversity.  

 Functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) are estimates of biodiversity 

based on ecological functions and evolutionary histories of species, respectively. FD 

describes the variability in ecological attributes among species and expresses ecosystem 

resistance, resilience and functioning (Petchey and Gaston, 2006). FD can be divided into 

three primary components – functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv) and 

functional evenness (FEve). FRic represents the amount of functional space occupied by a 

species assemblage. FEve corresponds to how regularly species abundances are distributed 

in the functional space. Finally, FDiv defines how far high species abundances are from 

the center of the functional space. These facets are complementary and jointly describe the

	 181	

distribution of species and their abundances within the functional space. PD measures the 

evolutionary differences among species based on times since divergence from a common 

ancestor (Faith, 1992), representing an estimate of phylogenetically conserved ecological 

and phenotypic differences among species (Cavender-Bares et al. 2009). This dimension 

may characterize the long-term evolutionary potential of specific clades to respond or 

adapt to current and future environments. Few studies have explored the influences of 

anthropogenic landscapes on FD or PD (Tscharntke et al., 2012), and most of which have 

focused on plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2012; Aviron 

et al. 2005; Laliberte et al. 2010). 

 Other metrics have been proposed to assess the effects of anthropogenic 

disturbance on communities. Body condition is considered an indicator of environmental 

stress, prey availability and/or habitat quality (Sztatecsny and Schabetsberger, 2005), 

reproductive investment (Castellano et al., 2004), parasite load, investment in secondary 

sexual characters (Green, 2001), mate choice (Uetz et al., 2002), survival (Hoey and 

McCormick, 2004), vulnerability to predation (Murray, 2002), and/or fighting ability (Bee 

et al., 2000). Body condition is thus a proxy of energy reserves (Schulte-Hostedde et al., 

2005) and may be used to assess the effects of environmental disturbances on the 

individual fitness level. 

 Here we conduct an integrative evaluation of the effects that habitat conversion to 

rice fields has on anuran communities in a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone. This region has three 

large rivers, Araguaia, Formoso and Javaés, hosting the world’s largest continuous area of 

irrigated rice, with over 500.000 ha. As an ecotone, it has unique biodiversity, resulting 

from constant and historical direct contact between species typical of the Cerrado and the 

Amazon biomes. We adopted a multidimensional approach to assess i) how taxonomic 

diversity, species richness and evenness are modified; ii) how functional and phylogenetic 

diversity are affected; iii) which anuran traits are selected and excluded in Neotropical 

agricultural landscapes; and iv) use body condition indices to assess if population fitness is 

unaltered by agricultural activities. We expect that indices considering functional and 

phylogenetic diversity will provide better evaluations of habitat degradation than indices 

based on species taxonomic identity and abundances, since species–environment 

relationships are assumed to be mediated via functional traits (e.g., Suding et al. 2008). 

Furthermore, we expect rice fields to pose different environmental filters on anuran 



Chapter 4 

	 182	

communities, resulting in more homogeneous communities, with marked selection for 

certain traits that ensure persistence on these altered landscapes. Finally, we hypothesize 

that, although generalist species are apparently successful in these environments, body 

condition indices will be lower than in pristine areas, which may indicate that agricultural 

environments are unable to host healthy generalist anuran communities. This is the first 

study to simultaneously assess taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of 

anuran communities, along with body condition, within a human-modified landscape in the 

Neotropics.

4.3. Methods 
4.3.1. Study area 

 This study took place in the states of Goiás and Tocantins, Brazil. Both pristine and 

agricultural study areas are inserted in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and 

the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado. 

 Depending on topography, soil type and condition, temperature, pluviometry and 

available technology, there are five types of rice fields in Brazil. Irrigated and upland rice 

fields are the most expressive regarding crop area and yield, accounting for 67% and 37% of 

the annual production, respectively (IBGE, 2005). While upland rice fields are distributed 

along the biome, on montane areas, irrigated rice is grown in periodically flooded regions, 

usually close to large rivers. Considered Brazil’s “water tank”, with its extensive periodically 

flooded areas, high water availability and suitable climatic and territorial extension, the 

Cerrado has great agricultural potential for irrigated rice production (Santos and Rabelo, 

2004).  

 Sampled rice fields are located in the municipal district of Lagoa da Confusão 

(Tocantins). Pristine areas are located in Pium, Ilha do Bananal (Tocantins) and Monte Alto 

(Goiás). The region is a seasonally flooded area, with two large rivers, Formoso and Javaés, 

and a very pronounced rainy season from October to April. This highly unique ecotone is 

often characterized by the presence of ipucas, “islands” of closed native vegetation that remain 

flooded longer than the surrounding areas. Recently, an endemic rodent (Rhipidomys 

ipukensis) was found within these structures (Rocha et al., 2011). When an ipuca is destroyed 

to make place for crops, low crop yields often result because when the native vegetation is 

removed, the ipuca area remains flooded for longer, thus becoming useless for agriculture. 

The ipucas exist only in the state of Tocantins, making the agricultural landscapes of this state 

quite peculiar, with vast crop areas speckled by many “islands” of native vegetation of 

variable dimensions. 

 Irrigated rice fields in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone present a dynamic hydrologic 

regime, with variation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. When rice is being produced, 

from December to April, rice fields have surface water until harvest, before which crops are 



Chapter 4 

	 184	

completely drained (Santos and Rabelo, 2004). After rice harvesting, fields may remain 

without crops, or other crops, such as soybeans or watermelons, may be grown, depending on 

the landowner’s will. Besides rice fields, the region’s landscape is also occupied by pasture 

areas, where cattle, emus or water buffalos roam. 

 Sampled pristine areas are characterized by natural vegetation typical of Cerrado-

Amazon ecotone, with no significant anthropogenic activities. 

 
4.3.2. Sampling design 

 To ensure we represented most of the environmental variability of this agricultural 

landscape, we chose a total of 10 rice fields along the Rio Formoso irrigation project (Fig. 

4.1). Chosen rice fields varied in size, ipuca abundance and dimensions and waterbody 

abundance and size. We selected 4 to 5 lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice 

field, totaling 35 waterbodies sampled in rice fields. All waterbodies were located inside the 

agricultural matrix or less than 50 m from rice fields. Waterbodies for the pristine and 

agricultural area were chosen based on type, size and hydroperiod. We chose small (25 m2) to 

large (1200 m2) temporary lentic waterbodies. All sampled waterbodies were at least 450 m 

apart (Fig. 4.1).  

 
4.3.3. Anuran surveys 

Agricultural and pristine area surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from 

February 2013 to April 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual 

encounter surveys along a 10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. 

Every individual seen perched on the vegetation, on the ground, under the leaf litter, logs or 

stones was caught, identified, measured, weighed, photographed and then released near the 

site of origin.

4.3.4. Trait Data 

We compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species encountered in the 

agricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information on 12 traits: 

activity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), breeding site, 

breeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding pattern and geographic 

range size. Traits were chosen based on perceived importance for determining species 

resilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data availability. Trait data were

vegetation. White dots represent pristine sampling sites (detailed in B), dark dots represent agricultural

compiled from the literature, the AmphibiaWeb and IUCN online databases. If published data 

were unavailable, we relied on expert opinion or inferred trait information based on closely 

related species. 

 

 
4.4. Data analysis 

4.4.1. Sampling efficiency and species richness 

To assess the effectiveness of our sampling effort, we fitted species accumulation curves 

for the agricultural and pristine areas. We calculated observed species richness, estimated 

species richness (Chao1 estimator), species diversity (Shannon–Weaver's H) and species 

evenness (Pielou’s J) for the agricultural and pristine areas, for every site sampled in both 

areas, using the Vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2010) in program R version 3.1.2 (Team, 

2013). 

 

4.4.2. Taxonomic Diversity 

We calculated taxonomic diversity (D) and taxonomic distinctness (D*) (Clarke and 

Warwick 2001) based on information derived from a hierarchical taxonomic tree. We used 

taxonomic classification of all species sampled in both agricultural and pristine areas. 

Taxonomic indices were calculated using package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2010) on program R 

version 3.1.2 (Team, 2013). 

 

4.4.3. Functional diversity 

Mason et al. (2005) divided functional diversity into three independent components: the 

amount of trait space filled by the community (FRic), the divergence of abundance distribution 

in the occupied trait space (FDiv) and the evenness of distribution of abundance in trait space 

(FEve). We quantified functional richness (FRic) according to Villéger, Mason, and Mouillot 

(2008), which corresponds to the volume inside the hull that contains all trait combinations 

represented in the community. FRic is only influenced by the identity of species and more 

particularly by the most extreme species (in terms of functional traits), which delimitate the 

convex hull. We quantified functional evenness and functional divergence with FEve and

	 187	

FDiv, proposed by Villéger et.al. (2008). FEve includes both the regularity of species 

distribution and the regularity of their abundances along the “skeleton” of the functional 

volume occupied. It decreases when functional distances among species are less even or when 

abundances are less evenly distributed among species, i.e. when the main abundances belong 

to functionally close species. FDiv, the third facet of functional diversity, describes whether 

higher abundances are close to the volume borders. It approaches zero when highly abundant 

species are very close to the center of gravity of the volume occupied and approaches unity 

when highly abundant species are very distant from the center of gravity. FDis is the mean 

distance in multidimensional trait space of individual species to the centroid of all species 

being unaffected by species richness by construction (Laliberté et al., 2010). We also 

computed functional group richness (FGR), which returns the number of functional groups per 

community, as well as the abundance of each group in each community. 

 All of the abovementioned components of functional diversity were computed for both 

areas, based on trait values and relative abundances of species. To assess differences among 

indices from agricultural and pristine areas, we used t-tests or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests 

for non-parametric data. All FD indices were calculated using packages FD (Laliberté et al., 

2015), Ape (Paradis et al., 2004) and Picante (Kembel et al., 2010) in R version 3.1.2 (Team, 

2013). 

 

4.4.4. Null model validation 

 Most changes in FD components cannot be interpreted directly, since communities 

differ in species richness. Thus, we must assess not if observed diversity indices are 

significantly different between the agricultural and pristine areas, but if diversity indices are 

significantly different between agricultural and pristine areas after randomizing the samples 

between the areas. We tested the null hypothesis of no change in pristine and agricultural 

communities, designing an appropriate randomization procedure to test community changes in 

diversity indices (Swenson, 2014). Our null models were independent swap models, which 

randomize community data, while maintaining species occurrence frequency and sampling 

species richness for each community. The randomization process was carried out 999 times for 

each index and area and the P-value associated with the null hypothesis (no community effect) 



Chapter 4 

	 188	

rejection was estimated (Manly, 2007). We tested whether the actual FD for each community 

was significantly higher or lower than the null FD distribution, at ? = 0.05. This approach 

allowed us to determine if changes in FD simply reflected species richness, or if species 

composition and trait diversity varied in important ways between agricultural and pristine 

areas. In addition, a standardized effect size (SES) was calculated for each index and each area 

to measure the statistical amount of deviation of the observed index of community structure 

from the distribution of simulated indices (Gotelli and McCabe, 2002). Null models and 

respective significance metrics were generated on program R version 3.1.2. 

 
4.4.5. Phylogenetic Diversity 

 We used the phylogenetic tree built by Isaac et al. (2012) from the amphibian ‘tree of 

life’ described by Faivovich et al. (2006), with 5713 amphibian species and respective branch 

lengths. We pruned this supertree to build a smaller phylogenetic tree with every species 

sampled in the pristine and agricultural areas. All operations related to pruning the original 

Isaac et al. (2012) supertree were performed on R v. 3.1.2 using package Ape (Paradis et al., 

2004). We quantified the phylogenetic diversity (PD) with three different measures: Faith’s 

index of PD (PDf, Faith 1992), mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) and mean nearest 

phylogenetic taxon distance (MNTD) (Webb et al., 2002). Faith’s index of phylogenetic 

diversity is defined as the minimum total length of the phylogenetic branches connecting the 

species together on the phylogenetic tree. The abundance-weighted measures MPD and 

MNTD are respectively the average distance between two random individuals in a sample and 

the average distance to the closest heterospecific individual for all individuals in the sample 

(Webb et al., 2008). The branch lengths on the phylogram were used as distance measures. 

MPD is a measure of the tree-wide phylogenetic relatedness of the community, while MNTD 

focuses more on the relationships between the tips of the phylogenetic tree (Kraft et al., 2007). 

Measures of PD were calculated in R version 3.1.2 with the Picante package (Kembel et al., 

2010).

4.4.6. Anuran trait association with agricultural landscapes 

 To identify which traits persisted or were lost with land use, we used machine learning 

techniques to build classification and regression trees (CART). Although these tools have been 

previously used in ecology and recommended for conservation practice and wildlife 

management (Oliver et al., 2012), their application is still limited (Olden et al., 2008). 

Decision and regression trees are designed to identify nonlinear, context-dependent 

relationships between multiple correlated predictor variables (Olden et al., 2008). They do not 

assume a specific distribution of predictor variables or data independence, avoiding potential 

concerns about pseudoreplication and alleviating the need for explicit phylogenetic control 

(Bielby et al., 2009). Predictor variables may appear repeatedly in the model as necessary, a 

fundamental difference from the single-predictor variables of linear models. Finally, these 

analyses produce graphical outputs that quantify and summarize the interactions in a visual, 

easily interpretable format. 

 Because traditional tree models can be unstable, we used random forest, which 

combines the predictions of many independent decision-tree models to produce robust results 

regarding variable importance (Breiman, 2001). However, because random forest models do 

not produce a visual representation of variable importance, we also fitted traditional 

classification and regression tree models. We used packages randomForest (Liaw and Wiener, 

2015) and rpart (Therneau and Atkinson, 1997) of program R v. 3.1.2 to determine the main 

predictors of anuran presence and species relative abundance in rice fields. Trees are built by 

repeatedly partitioning the dataset into a nested series of mutually exclusive groups, each 

group as homogenous as possible regarding the response variable. Homogeneity is measured 

by the Gini index. Branches or split points in the tree are determined by considering all 

possible splits of all predictor variables and selecting the split that results in the most 

homogenous subgroups for the data. The branching process continues until further subdivision 

no longer reduces the Gini index. Lower branches are afterwards pruned by 10-fold cross-

validation to produce an optimal tree, balancing complexity (i.e., number of nodes) with 

prediction accuracy. The smallest tree with an error rate within 1 standard error of the 

minimum-error tree is taken as the optimal tree. 



Chapter 4 

	 190	

 We quantified overall model accuracy using the percentage of species correctly 

classified (PCC), specificity (percentage of species not present correctly classified), and 

sensitivity (percentage of species present correctly classified). We assessed the accuracy of the 

relative abundance model using cross-validation from package rpart in program R.  

 

4.4.7. Body condition index 

 The original method of estimating body condition involved the quantification of fat 

deposits and was fatal for the studied individuals (Blackwell, 2002). A non-destructive 

alternative to the above-mentioned method is the use of body condition indices (BCI) based on 

allometric relationships between length and weight. We extracted body condition indices from 

the residuals of the regression of log(body mass) on log(snout–vent length) (Jakob et al., 1996; 

Peig and Green, 2010). To evaluate how body condition varied between pristine and crop 

areas and across guilds, we calculated body condition indices for two treefrog genera 

(Dendropsophus and Hypsiboas) and for a terrestrial genus (Leptodactylus). Hypsiboas 

represents larger treefrogs while Dendropsophus represents smaller treefrogs. Samples 

consisted of 241 individuals of Dendropsophus, 161 Hypsiboas and 657 Leptodactylus. Half 

of the datasets corresponded to individuals from pristine areas, and the other half to 

individuals sampled in rice fields.

4.5. Results 

4.5.1. Sampling efficiency and species richness 

Although sampling was effective in capturing the vast majority of the species present 

in rice fields, sampling effort on pristine areas could have been increased and more species 

would have been registered (Table 4.1, Fig.A4.1). Species richness was significantly 

higher in pristine areas than in rice fields (Table 4.1, Fig.A4.2). 

 

 

4.5.2. Taxonomic Diversity 

Differences between taxonomic metrics in pristine and agricultural areas were not 

significant (Table 4.1). 

 

 

 

4.5.3. Functional diversity 

Functional richness was significantly higher in pristine areas than in rice fields 

(W=17, p= 0.02). Functional divergence was significantly lower in pristine areas than in 

rice fields (t(12.5) = 2.99, p=0.01). Regarding functional trait clusters, cluster 1 only had 

40% of the species present in pristine areas represented in rice fields, cluster 2 had 27%, 

cluster 3 had 31% and cluster 4 had 25% (Fig. 4.2). Cluster 3 was significantly more 

abundant in pristine areas than in rice fields (t(3.2607) = 8.47, p=0.01) (Fig.4.3). The 

NMDS also revealed differences in community composition, with the agricultural 

community being composed of a few species, strongly associated to those environments,

4.5.4. Null model validation 

 Observed functional richness in rice fields was significantly lower than null 

expectation 70% of the times. Faith’s phylogenetic index is strongly affected by species 

richness. Observed mean phylogenetic distance in rice fields was significantly lower than 

randomly expected 80% of the times. Observed mean phylogenetic distance to the nearest 

taxon in rice fields was significantly lower than null expectation 70% of the times (Table 

4.2). Hence, significant differences in functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics are not 

due to differences in species richness, but largely attributed to trait composition and 

community phylogenetic structure.

clade represented in rice fields (Fig. 4.5). 

 

4.5.6. Anuran trait association to agricultural landscapes 

 Our random forest models selected range size, SVL, clutch size and habitat as 

predictors of anuran species presence in rice fields. Our classification tree models 

identified two optimal trees for trait association with species presence in rice fields. In the 

first tree, small species ranges (&amp;lt;599 km2) determine species presence in crops, with 83% 

of the species with ranges smaller than 599 km2 being absent from rice fields. In the 

second tree, anurans associated with forest and open area habitats have 77% probability of 

being absent from rice fields. If the described habitat association occurs in synergy with 

small clutch size (&amp;lt;182 or 432), the probability of that species being absent from rice

association to species presence in rice crops.

fields is high (100% or 82%). Anurans associated to forest or open area with larger 

clutches have a relatively high probability of occurring in rice fields (57%) (Fig. 4.6). 

Our random forest models selected habitat, SVL, range size and clutch size as 

predictors of relative abundance of anuran species in rice fields. Our regression tree 

models identified three optimal trees for trait regression against species relative abundance 

in rice fields (Fig.4.8).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 In the first tree, small species ranges (&amp;lt;685 km2) results in low relative abundance 

in crops and, if in synergy with larger body size (? 18 mm), corresponds to a very low

relative abundance in rice fields. On the contrary, anurans with small ranges but smaller 

body size (&amp;lt;18mm) are associated with relatively higher abundances in rice fields 

(Fig.4.7A). The second optimal tree identifies forest or open area habitat associations as 

determinant for low relative abundance in crops, which, if in synergy with larger body size, 

results in absence from crops (Fig.4.7B). The third optimal tree identifies larger body size

Evidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation 

	

	 199	

 

4.6. Discussion 
 Our study is the first to integratively represent the effects of natural habitat conversion 

to rice fields on anuran communities. Habitat conversion and agricultural management have 

caused profound alterations to the anuran community, including dramatic loss of species 

diversity and functional richness and increased functional divergence. Community 

composition suffered severe alterations, resulting in dominance of generalist hylids and 

leptodactylids and low representation of specialist microhylids and bufonids. Anuran 

communities in rice fields exhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean phylogenetic 

distance, and increased mean nearest phylogenetic distance, suggesting that anuran 

communities in agricultural areas are composed of phylogenetically related species and, 

therefore, are not as diverse as their pristine counterparts. 

 Taxonomic indices often show unimodal patterns, with higher species richness for 

intermediate disturbance levels and contribute to the misconception that disturbance may be 

advantageous to biodiversity. These indices are unable to accurately describe how 

disturbances affect biodiversity, unless other metrics are taken into consideration. Functional 

diversity indices are expected to decrease under high disturbance levels due to environmental 

filtering (Cornwell et al., 2006; Flynn et al., 2009), and are thus perceived as better translators 

of disturbance effects on communities and ecosystems. According to the performance filter 

hypothesis, the environment determines the performance of species according to their trait 

syndromes, posing environmental filters to communities and selecting trait combinations 

associated with increased fitness in the occurring conditions (Mouillot et al., 2013b). This 

means that even milder disturbances may deplete populations of species with vulnerable 

combinations of traits (e.g., habitat specialists) without modifying species composition and, 

thus, without affecting taxonomic indices. Functional and phylogenetic diversity indices 

provide deeper insights into the complex effects that disturbances have on biodiversity 

(Cornwell et al., 2006). Functional richness in particular has been invoked as a good predictor 

of ecosystem service because it describes species traits, translating the capacity of each species 

to provide a particular service (D??az and Cabido, 2001). Indices based on both species traits 

and abundances, such as functional divergence or specialization, are more likely to act as 



Chapter 4 

	 200	

early-warning indicators as they do not need species extirpations or local extinctions to change 

(Villéger et al., 2010). Our study corroborates such conceptions because, although anuran 

species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were significantly lower in 

rice fields, taxonomic diversity did not vary significantly. 

 Phylogenetic diversity represents the total evolutionary history or phylogenetic 

relatedness of all species in a community (Faith, 1992), being recognized as intrinsically 

valuable for conservation (Winter et al., 2013). Several studies have suggested that 

communities with higher phylogenetic diversity are more stable (Cadotte et al., 2012), 

productive (Cadotte, 2013) and support more species (Dinnage et al., 2012). However, despite 

the known impacts of agriculture on species loss, the effects of habitat conversion on 

phylogenetic diversity remains largely unknown. Studies on plants and invertebrates suggest 

that environmental disturbances favor subsets of closely related clades, resulting in 

phylogenetic diversity loss (Helmus et al., 2010). Global extinction risk assessments of birds 

and mammals suggest that particular branches are at greater extinction risk than others (Verde 

Arregoitia et al., 2013). Although species richness was significantly decreased in rice fields, 

species loss alone did not account for declining phylogenetic diversity. The changes we 

detected in phylogenetic diversity result from species loss and increased species relatedness. 

Species in pristine areas were less related to one another than expected by chance, whereas 

species in rice were more closely related. These patterns indicate that anuran phylogenetic 

diversity loss in agriculture causes a shift in community composition while taxonomic 

diversity remains relatively stable. 

 Ecological resilience, the ability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while 

maintaining key functions (Folke et al., 2004), is increasingly crucial considering global 

changes and increased human pressure on ecosystems. Ecosystem resilience safeguards vital 

services upon which humans and biodiversity depend, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and 

pest control (Foley et al., 2005). Functional richness and redundancy are important aspects of 

ecosystems resilience (Allen et al., 2005). While FRic describes the diversity and range of 

functional traits responsible for ecosystem services (Wright et al., 2006), functional 

redundancy represents the number of species fulfilling the same function. Ecosystems are 

more resilient when a given function is fulfilled by multiple species, which minimizes the 



Evidence of anuran community disruption on rice crops: a multidimensional evaluation 

	

	 201	

probability of trait extinction. In highly functionally redundant communities, if one species 

goes extinct, others will continue to fulfill the same functions and ensure community 

functioning even under increasing pressure, allowing long-term sustainability of ecosystems 

and their services (Tscharntke et al. 2005). Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem 

functioning; in food webs, they act as both predators on invertebrates and small vertebrates 

and as prey for larger animals, and they establish an avenue for nutrient transport between 

aquatic and terrestrial systems. Loss of amphibian functional richness and an increase in 

functional divergence may affect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system 

resilience and resistance (Davic and Welsh, 2004). 

 The dramatic decline in FRic and the increase in functional divergence following 

conversion of natural habitats to rice fields indicates that the loss of more sensitive species is 

not counterbalanced by the addition of new, disturbance-tolerant species that could either fill 

vacant functional niches or occupy different functional roles. Anuran communities from rice 

fields were strongly dominated by a few generalist species (e.g., D. nanus, L. latrans), while 

communities from pristine areas were composed by more species, many specialists, occurring 

at lower abundances. These community changes provide strong evidence for environmental 

filtering in agricultural landscapes. Generalists with short life cycles and high reproductive 

capacities (i.e. r-selected species, Begon et al., 1996) are favored, and K-selected specialists 

are excluded from the communities due to lower ability to adapt to the fluctuating resources of 

intensively managed agricultural lands (Begon et al., 1996). While habitat loss and pesticide 

burden are important drivers of extinction of specialized and rare species, habitat 

fragmentation per se and the disrupted exchange of individuals between local communities 

affect less mobile species. Reduced dispersal affects meta-population dynamics, resulting in 

increased extinction risk for less vagile species (Schweiger et al. 2005). Consequently, 

intensively cultivated landscapes will be dominated by generalist and mobile species. 

Functional groups composed mainly of specialized, rare, or less mobile species have higher 

extinction risk when land use is intensified than groups dominated by generalist or highly 

mobile species (Schweiger et al., 2007). 

 Small geographic ranges, association with forest and open area habitats, small clutches 

and large body size are associated with low to null species abundances in rice fields. Indeed, 



Chapter 4 

	 202	

while pristine communities were composed of many, similarly abundant species, with varied 

degrees of habitat specialization, clutch and body size, agricultural communities were 

composed of few widespread habitat generalists, with smaller body size and larger clutches, 

such as D. nanus or L. latrans. Large body size and small range are the most common 

predictors of high extinction risk for several organisms (Botts et al., 2013; Gilroy et al., 2014; 

Sodhi et al., 2008). The most consistently significant correlate with amphibian decline risk is 

geographic range size (Botts et al., 2013). Small-range species are more likely to decline, 

become threatened and eventually suffer extinction (Devictor et al. 2010; Murray et al. 2011; 

Sodhi et al. 2008). Species with small ranges are often less abundant, less mobile, poorer 

competitors and have lower reproductive success than more widespread species (Cooper et al., 

2008; Sodhi et al., 2008). The geographic area of a species depends on suitable environmental 

conditions, ability to disperse and to successfully compete with other species and survive 

predation (Olalla-Tárraga et al., 2011). Species with large ranges often tolerate a wide variety 

of conditions, while species with small ranges are only able to persist under a narrower range 

of conditions. Hence, the size of a species range is, at least partially, a spatial representation of 

its degree of specialization (Cooper et al., 2008; Devictor et al., 2010; Sodhi et al., 2008). 

Strong association with forest and open area habitats are also correlated with higher degrees of 

specialization. The anurofauna of the Cerrado is composed of species strongly associated with 

forest formations, those dependent on open area formations and those that are widespread 

generalists (Valdujo et al., 2012). Forest associated species have specialized breeding 

strategies, such as terrestrial clutches and lotic tadpoles, while open area specialists often 

produce foam nests in subterranean chambers to minimize humidity loss and temperature 

fluctuation. Larger body sizes generally correlate with slower life history traits, thus 

decreasing recovery potential after population crashes (Sodhi et al., 2008). Anuran body size 

reflects effects of reduced surface to volume ratios in larger species to control both heat and 

water balance (Olalla-Tárraga et al. 2009); thus, larger species are commonly associated with 

high water deficit areas, whereas smaller species are usually found in humid areas. In addition, 

assuming resistance to desiccation relates to mobility, larger species forced to migrate across 

agricultural matrices, from shelter areas to breeding areas, might be more successful than 

smaller ones. Our results indicate that agricultural activities such as pesticide application and

	 203	

ploughing may be significantly more detrimental to larger species and may offset the 

physiological advantage that larger body size has in regulating body temperature and 

increasing mobility. Small clutches are correlated with decreased survival probabilities, 

especially in unstable and adverse conditions, such as those present in agricultural 

environments. 
 Most studies on the effects of agricultural activities on amphibians are based on 

abundance or density changes. While these metrics are useful, less conspicuous effects occur 

at the individual and population level. Although the effects of habitat change on body 

condition are seldom studied, the few studies available indicate that anurans in agricultural 

areas have lower body condition than their pristine counterparts (e.g. Brodeur et al. 2011; 

Karraker and Welsh 2006; Neckel-oliveira 2007). Body condition indices are surrogates for 

the animal’s mass associated with energy reserves after correcting for structural body size. An 

individual in good condition is assumed to have more energy reserves than an animal in poor 

condition. As energy stores can be allocated for maintenance, growth or reproduction, animals 

with larger energy reserves will usually have better fasting endurance, survival and 

reproductive output than individuals with smaller reserves (e.g., Bachman and Widemo 1999). 

Consequently, the lower body condition observed in frogs from cultivated sites is an indication 

that these animals have reduced fitness and suggests that ecologically relevant parameters such 

as reproductive output and survival may be impaired in these populations (Brodeur et al., 

2011). Higher abundance of generalists in agricultural areas may result in increased 

competition for resources and in lower body condition. High exposure to fertilizers and 

pesticides in crops may stimulate the organism’s compensation/detoxification systems to re-

establish homeostasis, explaining the reduction of energy reserves due to physiological 

alterations and consequent increase of energetic maintenance costs. Another explanation for 

the reduced body condition of frogs from agricultural areas would be for food intake to be 

lower in cultivated sites due to either the smaller area of habitat available or to a decrease in 

the abundance of prey insects caused by insecticide applications. Our results highlight the 

need for further investigations into the causes and consequences of the low body conditions 

consistently found in anuran communities from agricultural environments.

 Understanding how species traits correlate with their responses to agriculture will 

allow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use (Newbold et al., 

2013). Diversity itself is an important component of ecosystem resilience because diverse 

communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to a single given 

function. Our results show that the conversion of natural Cerrado-Amazon vegetation to vast 

rice fields results in such environmental stresses, that large subsets of species are driven to 

local extinction irrespective of their specialization. Species commonly perceived as resilient to 

habitat alteration did not occur in these environments (e.g. Leptodactylus labyrinthicus, Heyer 

2005), which indicates that the new environmental filters, arisen as a consequence of replacing 

native vegetation with rice fields, are more detrimental on Neotropical anurans than was 

expected. Our results corroborate previous studies (e.g.,  Cooper et al. 2008; Hero, Williams, 

and Magnusson 2005; Lips, Reeve, and Witters 2003; Murray and Hose 2005) but also deliver 

new insights into potential synergies of different drivers of anuran community change in 

agricultural environments. This study supports previous findings that traditional metrics such 

as taxonomic diversity can hide important information about the real impacts of anthropogenic 

land-use on species composition and ecosystem functioning. Integrative approaches provide 

holistic insights on the impacts and consequences of human-mediated disturbances on 

biodiversity, potentially contributing to future conservation and agricultural management 

decisions (Hidasi-Neto et al., 2012; Vandewalle et al., 2010).

5.1. Abstract 

Deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, mainly due to agriculture. As 

rice is among the world’s most important crops, determining how agricultural 

communities are shaped is imperative. However, few studies have addressed the factors 

that alter community assembly in human-modified landscapes. We aim to quantify 

taxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an anuran community from rice 

crops on a biodiversity hotspot. Identify local and landscape characteris- tics responsible 

for variations in multiple dimensions of anuran diversity in rice crops. This study was 

performed in Tocantins, Brazil. We chose 36 lentic waterbodies on rice fields for anuran 

sampling. We quantified taxonomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD) and 

phylogenetic diversity (PD) for each waterbody. We also estimated the mean functional 

differences among species for each trait separately. To evaluate how local and landscape 

scale features affect anurans, we performed generalized linear mixed models in 500, 1000 

and 1500 m buffers around each waterbody. We found increased PD and FD in water- 

bodies closer to many other waterbodies and large forest patches. Anuran biomass 

decreased with increasing distance to the closest waterbody. Trait diversity varied with 

waterbody abundance and closeness, percentage of bare ground and marginal vegetation. 

Our study emphasizes the importance of waterbody and forest patch networks for 

maintain- ing high anuran FD and PD in agricultural landscapes. As both metrics are 

known to be related to ecosystem resilience, understanding these patterns is pivotal for

5.2. Introduction 
Deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, especially in the megadiverse 

Neotropics, where it is mainly caused by agricultural expansion (Garcia-Barrios et al. 

2009). Anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and cattle farming are known to cause 

profound and complex alterations to communities and ecosystems (Williams-Guillen and 

Perfecto 2010; Frishkoff et al. 2014). Rice is the world’s most important food crop, 

occupying 11% of the world’s total arable land (Kang and Priyadarshan, 2007). Asian 

countries are responsible for 90% of the world’s production, while Latin America and the 

Caribbean produce 4.1%, half of which comes solely from Brazil (FAO, 2011). Several 

studies have reported negative effects of habitat conversion to irrigated rice crops on 

biodiversity (e.g. Attademo et al. 2011; Hyne et al. 2009; Maximiliano Attademo et al. 

2015). However, these agricultural wetlands have also been considered valuable for birds 

and amphibians (Czech and Parsons 2002; Elphick and Oring 2003; Bambaradeniya and 

Amarasinghe 2004; Leps et al. 2006) and even functional equivalents to natural wetlands. 

(Bambaradeniya and Amarasinghe 2004). Given the extension and location of rice fields 

worldwide, determining how communities living in these environments are shaped is of 

the utmost concern, especially in the tropics, where rice production meets important 

social and economic demands, and biodiversity is especially high and unique. 

Wetlands are important breeding habitats for many amphibian species and 

irrigated rice fields are invariably used by local amphibians to forage and reproduce. Due 

to their generally biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, 

amphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change 

(Niemi and McDonald 2004). These characteristics have made amphibians the most 

threatened vertebrates worldwide, especially due to habitat destruction (Stuart, 2004). 

They play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, acting as both predators and prey, 

enable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and are among the most 

diverse and abundant vertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding 

strategies and dispersal abilities. Loss of amphibian species may therefore affect vital 

ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience and resistance (Davie and 

Welsh 2004). Due to their ecological importance and sensitivity, amphibians constitute

rice crops 

	

	 221	

reliable surrogates to evaluate the effects of human disturbances on whole communities 

and ecosystems (Davie and Welsh 2004). 

Although some studies have already investigated the variables that affect 

community composition in anthropogenic landscapes, most were based on taxonomic 

metrics (Sodhi and Ehrlich 2010), leaving important community and ecosystem-level 

consequences unaddressed. Species richness relies on the assumption that all species are 

equal, i.e., only relative abundances determine the importance of species in communities 

15 and ecosystems (Magurran 2004). However, some species are more distinct from an 

evolutionary perspective or carry functional traits especially important for ecosystem 

processes than others (Cadotte et al. 2010; Mouillot et al. 2013). As the effects of 

anthropogenic environmental alteration on species are ultimately mediated by traits (e.g. 

physiological constraints, habitat preference, dispersal ability), considering only 

taxonomic metrics may fail to provide accurate conclusions on the real consequences of 

anthropization on biodiversity. 

Landscape modification often creates new environmental filters that favor 

particular attributes for species persistence, generating generalist communities with 

species richness similar and sometimes even higher than pristine environments. In order 

to attain more representative conclusions on the effects human activities have on 

communities, we must account for different components of biodiversity, such as 

functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) diversity. 

FD describes the variability in ecological attributes among species, being often 

considered representative of ecosystem resistance, resilience and functioning (Petchey 

and Gaston 2006). Measuring FD is equivalent to measuring functional trait diversity, 

where functional traits are components of an organism’s phenotype that influence 

ecosystem processes. PD analyzes the evolutionary differences between species (Faith, 

1992), representing an estimate of phylogenetically conserved ecological and phenotypic 

differences between species (Cavender-Bares et al. 2009). This metric may characterize 

the evolutionary potential of biodiversity to respond to environments (Cisneros, Fagan, 

and Willig 2014). Studies approaching the effects anthropogenic landscapes have on 

species traits, FD or PD (Tscharntke et al. 2012) are still scarce but, while most focused

	 222	

on plant and invertebrate assemblages (e.g., Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2012; Aviron et al. 

2005; Laliberte et al. 2010), others have successfully explored the effects human 

activities have on vertebrate communities (e.g. Ernst et al. 2006, Trimble and Aarde 

2014). However, the influences of landscape and local features of agricultural landscapes 

on communities are seldom investigated (but see Cisneros et al., 2014). 

Human-mediated landscape modification is spatially complex, as native 

formations are fragmented and replaced by a variety of anthropogenic land cover types. 

These new landscape matrices are not completely inhospitable to biota, and species 

dispersal ability and plasticity in resource use often determine its ability to endure in 

these environments (Kupfer et al., 2006; Perfecto &amp;amp; Vandermeer, 2008). 

Land cover change alters resource availability and diversity, as well as 

connectivity among resource patches. Landscape modification has three main 

consequences for the fauna: loss of native vegetation; fragmentation and alteration of 

matrix permeability (Tscharntke et al., 2012). Because species are affected in multi- 

dimensional manners (e.g. landscape composition and configuration), understanding the 

effects of native vegetation loss, fragmentation, and matrix configuration on community 

assembly requires considering multiple scale-dependent compositional and 

configurational landscape features. 

We aim to quantify taxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an 

anuran community from rice crops in a Neotropical biodiversity hotspot. Our objective 

was to identify local and landscape characteristics responsible for variations in multiple 

dimensions of anuran diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the 

effects that landscape and local features of agricultural systems have on taxonomic, 

functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of a Neotropical anuran community. 

 

5.3. Methods 
5.3.1. Study area and sampling design 

This study took place in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and the 

Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, in the municipal district of Lagoa da Confusão, state of 

Tocantins, Brazil. Agricultural landscapes of this area are characterized by the presence

rice crops 

	

	 223	

of ipucas, “islands” of closed native vegetation which remain flooded longer than the 

surrounding areas. These landscapes are composed of vast crop areas speckled by many 

“islands” of native vegetation of variable dimensions. The region is a seasonally flooded 

area, with a very pronounced rainy season from October to April. 

Irrigated rice fields in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone present a dynamic hydrologic 

regime, with variation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. When rice is being grown, 

from December to April, rice fields remain with surface water until harvest, before which 

crops are completely drained. After rice harvesting, crops may remain fallow or other 

crops may be cultivated, depending on the landowner’s will. Besides rice fields, the 

region’s landscape is also occupied by pasture areas, where cows, emus or water buffalos 

roam. This area has been under agricultural exploration for the last 30 years, especially 

targeting rice production. Given the temporal extent of this exploration, we consider these 

communities as stable, despite the use of pesticides and crop management procedures. 

We chose a total of 10 rice fields along the Rio Formoso irrigation project (Fig. 

5.1). Rice fields varied in size, ipuca and waterbody abundance and size. We selected 4 

to 5 temporary lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice field, totalizing 35 

waterbodies. In order to investigate how local and landscape characteristics affect anuran 

diversity in rice crops, sampled waterbodies were chosen to represented the variance in 

habitat and landscape-level characteristics present in rice crop waterbodies. Due to 

logistic constraints, average accessibility to the waterbodies was also considered, as 

difficulty to sample was an important constraint for some waterbodies. We chose small 

(25 m2) to large (1200 m2) waterbodies. All waterbodies were located inside the 

agricultural matrix or less than 50 m from rice crops. All waterbodies were at least 450 m 

apart, and the maximum distance between waterbodies was 7km.

5.3.2. Anuran surveys 

 Agricultural surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from February 

2013 to April 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual encounter 

surveys along the 10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. Every 

individual seen perched on the vegetation, on the floor, under the leaf litter, logs or stones 

was caught, identified, measured, weighed, photographed and then released near the site 

of origin.

influences of landscape features and anuran diversity.

5.3.3. Local waterbodies characteristics 

 Environmental variables such as percentage of bare ground, herbaceous 

vegetation, shrubs, trees, shaded ground, leaf litter, logs/rocks, aquatic vegetation, 

herbaceous vegetation height, shrub vegetation height, herbaceous vegetation 

heterogeneity and shrub vegetation heterogeneity were registered.  These variables were 

quantified performing transects (10 m long x 1 m wide) set on the sampled waterbody 

margin. For every meter, a 50 cm x 50 cm grid would be placed above the ground and the 

number of squares with 50% or more coverage of each variable would be summed and 

divided by the total (25 squares). 

 

5.3.4. Landscape features 

 We quantified landscape features on the vicinity of each waterbody using high 

resolution Google Earth satellite imagery representing the landscape of the year 2014, on 

which we could easily discern crops from natural vegetation. This satellite classification 

was afterwards corroborated through presential visits to the main features on the field. 

For each of the 36 sampled waterbodies, we quantified distance to the closest waterbody, 

distance to the closest forest patch and number of waterbodies, number of forest patches, 

total waterbody area, total forest area, mean forest patch area and mean waterbody area 

within 500 m, 1000 m and 1500 m buffers (Fig. 5.1). While compositional features, such 

as number of forest patches or total waterbody area describe the proportions of different 

types of land use within the area surrounding a waterbody, configurational features, such 

as distance to the closest forest patch or waterbody, specify the geometric arrangement of 

land features surrounding a waterbody. Both compositional and configurational features 

were considered based on the acknowledged importance of such features for amphibian 

breeding success, migration and, consequently, metapopulation sustenance (Dodd, 2009). 

Trying to cover every possible function these features might have for the anuran 

community, we decided to consider multiple variables, despite their high apparent 

correlation. For example, while mean forest patch size and number of forest patches are 

correlated, they address different perspectives; mean forest patch size is important for 

addressing species which mostly exist within those environments, while number of forest 



Chapter 5  

	 226	

patches addresses the stepping stone character of each forest patch, and therefore, is 

relevant to species that use forest patches in dispersion.  

Because spatial patterns are scale dependent, and anuran communities from 

anthropogenic environments are affected by different features on different scales, the 

scale at which anurans react to the environment differs among species, depending on a 

series of traits (Gorresen et al., 2005; Klingbeil &amp;amp; Willig, 2009). We quantified landscape 

characteristics at three spatial scales (buffers of 500, 1000 and 1500 m radius) that we 

found significant for amphibians regarding known dispersal abilities, to account for 

interspecific differences in anuran dispersal and ability to endure in agricultural systems. 

 

5.3.5. Anuran Data 

 We compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species registered 

in the agricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information of 

12 traits: activity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), 

breeding site, breeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding 

pattern and geographic range size. We chose these traits based on perceived importance 

for determining species resilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data 

availability. We compiled trait data from the literature, the AmphibiaWeb and IUCN 

online databases. If published data were unavailable, we relied on expert opinion or 

inferred trait information based on closely related species. Because breeding site, 

breeding season and breeding pattern were very homogeneous along the agricultural 

anuran community, we decided to exclude these three traits from the following analyses.  

We used the phylogenetic tree built by Isaac et al. (2012) from the amphibian 

‘tree of life’ described by Faivovich et al. (2006), with 5713 amphibian species and 

respective branch lengths. We pruned this supertree to build a smaller phylogenetic tree 

with every species sampled in rice crops. All operations related to pruning the original 

Isaac et al. (2012) supertree were performed using package Ape (Paradis et al. 2004) in 

program R.

5.3.6. Biodiversity metrics  

 At each site we quantified TD using Simpson’s diversity index (Simpson, 1949), 

and FD and PD through Rao’s quadratic entropy (Botta-Duke at, 2005). As Rao’s Q 

derives from Simpson’s index, hence including information on species differences, it can 

be used for the three dimensions (TD, FD and PD), which facilitates the comparison 

among different metrics. Rao’s Q corresponds to the sum of functional or phylogenetic 

distances among all species, weighted by the product of their abundances, hence 

describing the abundance-weighted average difference between species from a 

community (Weiher, 2011).  

Rao's Q, is commonly used in a multi-trait perspective, however, due to its 

intrinsic versatility, it can also be used to translate variability in trait state, e.g. regarding 

habits, how many different habits are in the space we are studying. Given the amount of 

trait information we collected for this community, we decided to explore how rice crops 

affected variability in trait state, and go beyond FD, which measures overall functional 

trait diversity. Hence, because landscape and local agricultural features may affect 

particular traits differently, we estimated the mean functional differences among species 

for each trait separately (e.g., habitat, breeding mode), as well as for all traits combined, 

corresponding to the FD metric. We obtained functional and phylogenetic distances 

between species from pairwise dissimilarity matrices for each trait separately, for all 

traits combined, and for the phylogeny. We built functional pairwise dissimilarity 

matrices using the Gower distance matrix, which quantifies dissimilarities with 

categorical and numeric attributes simultaneously (Botta-Duké at, 2005). In order to 

compare dimensions, we transformed each metric into its effective number of species 

(Jost, 2006), allowing direct interpretation of differences among indices (Jost, 2006). We 

calculated FD with function dfFD from package FD, and PD and TD with function raoD 

from package picante on program R. 

We also determined anuran biomass directly, through the total anuran weight 

collected in each waterbody, and tested how it was affected by the considered predictors.

5.3.7. Phylogenetic signal  

 To facilitate ecological interpretation of phylogenetic patterns, we used abouheif’s 

Cmean test to measure the strength of phylogenetic signal of the traits we used. 

Abouheif’s Cmean tests the statistical dependence between species’ traits due to 

phylogenetic affinities, using Revell et al. (2008) both categorical and mensural 

attributes. This approach evaluates if traits on a phylogeny are overdispersed, 

independent, consistent with a model of Brownian motion or conserved. If trait 

distribution along a phylogeny is consistent with a model of Brownian motion or 

conserved, traits exhibit phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic patterns can be interpreted 

with regard to those traits. Abouheif’s Cmean test of phylogenetic signal was calculated 

with the R package adephylo (Jombart &amp;amp; Dray, 2010).  

 

5.3.8. Quantitative analyses  

We performed principal component analysis on waterbody characteristics, in 

order to assess local variable importance for overall variance and inter-variable 

correlation. We used package FactoMineR (Lê et al. 2008). 

We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the effects 

of local and landscape features on anuran biomass and taxonomic, phylogenetic, 

functional and trait diversity. Because the 1000 and 1500 m buffers used to characterize 

the surroundings of each waterbody included other waterbodies within the same rice 

field, we used rice field as random effect. Random effects are especially useful for 

inferring on a population when the data available are random samples of that population, 

assuming it is a meta-population, and that our sample reflects many draws from that 

population. So rather than anchoring results around heterogeneous intercepts, the data 

will be used to elucidate the parameters of that distribution from which data were drawn. 

Model fit for each dependent variable was manually assessed from the null model, 

to avoid automatic variable elimination for the sake of model fit optimization only. We 

choose to assess model fit and predictor significance through F-tests performed among 

nested models por each dependent variable (FD, PD, TD, each trait’s diversity and 

Biomass), first progressively evaluating each predictor’s significance, then fitting 



Landscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in 
rice crops 

	

	 229	

reduced models with the most significant predictors, and finally assessing the reduced 

models’ fit against the full model, using F tests. We fit all models using the lme4 package 

(Bates 2007). 

We performed hierarchical partitioning (HP) to further determine the relative 

independent importance of each significant variable. We determined the statistical 

significance of each independent variable’s independent contribution using a 

randomization approach with 5000 iterations and an alpha- level of 0.05 (Mac Nally, 

2002). We executed hierarchical partitioning using package ‘hier.part’ (Mac Nally &amp;amp; 

Walsh, 2004). 

 

5.4. Results 
Relationships between landscape and local characteristics and anuran diversity 

were scale and metric-specific (Table 5.1). TD variation across waterbodies was affected 

mainly by local waterbody and landscape characteristics (F(8, 26) = 14.78,  p = 0.048, 

Table 1). TD decreased 67% with increased percentage of terrestrial leaf-litter (Fig. 

5.2E), and with increased mean forest patch area within the 500 m buffer (Fig. 5.2D).  

Variation in PD was mainly accounted for by the number of forest patches within 

the 1500 m buffer (F(9, 26) = 20.34,  p = 0.034); increased number of forest patches was 

associated to a 92% increase in phylogenetic diversity (Fig. 5.2C). Phylogenetic signal 

was significant for only four traits (Table 5.2), being stronger for habits, breeding 

strategy and parental care. Hence, PD is not a surrogate for FD, as phylogeny is only 

related to trait diversity regarding 3 traits. Therefore, it is important to consider PD, as 

well as FD and trait diversity, because all these metrics account for some independent 

variability.  

Variation in FD considering all functional components jointly, was best accounted 

for by mean forest patch and waterbody area in the 1500 m buffer (F(8, 26) = 35.84,  p = 

0.029; Table 1); higher mean forest patch and waterbody area caused a 6.5 and 8.7% 

increase in functional diversity, respectively (Fig. 5.2A, B). Anuran biomass was mostly 

affected by distance to the closest waterbody, decreasing 95% with increased distance to 

the closest waterbody (F(8, 26) = 74.97,  p = 0.021; Fig. 5.2F). 



Chapter 5  

	 230	

Decomposing FD into its functional components revealed considerable 

heterogeneity regarding the effects landscape and local variables have on each trait’s 

diversity (Table 5.1). Anuran activity diversity decreased 25% with increased distance to 

the closest waterbody (F(9, 26) = 79.44,  p = 0.019; Fig. 5.3A). Diversity in anuran habits 

was affected mainly by local waterbody characteristics, namely percentage of bare 

ground, increasing 47% with increased bare ground (F(9, 26) = 32.27,  p = 0.031; Fig.  

5.3B). Diversity in anuran habitats was predicted by the number of waterbodies within 

the 500 m buffer, increasing 21% with higher waterbody abundance (F(9, 26) = 21.07,  p = 

0.033; Fig. 5.3C). Diversity in adult snout-vent-length and anuran breeding strategy were 

mainly affected by local waterbody characteristics. SVL diversity increased 11% with 

increasing shrub height and percentage of shaded ground (F(8, 26) = 17.31,  p = 0.044; Fig.  

5.3D, E). Breeding strategy diversity increased 56% with increased percentage of shaded 

ground (F(9, 26) = 19.20,  p = 0.037; Fig. 5.3F). Diversity in clutch size was mainly 

predicted by the distance to the closest waterbody, decreasing 25% with increasing 

distance to the nearest waterbody (F(9, 26) = 43.97,  p = 0.021; Fig. 5.4A). Diversity in 

parental care was mainly predicted by local waterbody characteristics, especially 

percentage of bare ground, and total waterbody area within the 1000 m buffer (F(8, 26) 

= 23.70,  p = 0.031; Table 5.1). Parental care diversity increased 33% with increasing 

percentage of bare ground, and decreased 23% with increasing total waterbody area 

within the 1000 m buffer (Fig. 5.4B, C). Range diversity was mainly affected by the total 

forest patch area within the 500 m buffer, increasing 24% with increased total forest area 

(F(9, 26) = 16.81,  p = 0.046; Fig. 5.4D). 

The apparent departure from linearity in some relationships (Fig 5.2D, E; Fig. 

5.2F; Fig. 5.4C) is caused by the insufficient sampling of waterbodies in the intermediate 

and maximum state regarding predictor variables. For example, regarding the 

relationships among TD and mean forest area, we apparently failed to sample more 

waterbodies within the intermediate and maximum amount of forest area within the 500m 

buffer. Hence, while the relation appears linear for those levels, there is a cluster of 

waterbodies with a small amount of forest area visually confounding the overall 

relationship.

5.5. Discussion 
 Our study shows that communities from anthropogenic environments are shaped 

by multiple scale-dependent features. Furthermore, our trait-based approach allowed us to 

better understand how community assembly is shaped in human-modified landscapes, 

specifically how local and landscape features affect different facets of biodiversity. 

Variation in TD was best explained by local waterbody characteristics and a 

compositional landscape variable, whereas variation in FD and PD were best explained 

only by landscape characteristics. This illustrates the complex ways in which human 

disturbances can affect different dimensions of biodiversity. Furthermore, it demonstrates 

how taking one diversity metric as the sole describer of biodiversity is too simplistic and 

may lead to erroneous conclusions and flawed management plans. Nonetheless, 

biodiversity is still seldom assessed using multidimensional and multi-scale approaches. 

To our knowledge, this was the first study to address the effects of local and landscape 

variables on multiple and complementary anuran diversity metrics in anthropogenic 

environments. 

TD was lower in waterbodies with more terrestrial leaf-litter i.e., in waterbodies 

more marginal to rice crops, only partially embedded in rice crops. This, along with the 

association of lower TD with increased mean forest patch area within the 500 m buffer, 

may suggest that species prefer breeding inside forest patches (Becker et al. (2010)).

Landscape and local correlates of anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in 
rice crops

When forest patches are scarce, species tend to concentrate in waterbodies embedded in 

rice crops, causing increased species richness, due to low availability of better breeding 

sites. 

Not all traits exhibited a phylogenetic signal, possibly indicating that PD 

represents differences in traits that were not considered for this study. Because 

community assembly processes act on traits, species’ response to environmental variation 

may be reliably translated by the measured functional attributes (FD) or by unmeasured 

characteristics (addressed through PD). PD increased with increasing number of forest 

patches, which may be explained by the decreased PD in communities from rice crops 

compared to their pristine counterparts (Ribeiro et al.  in prep). Waterbodies close to 

more forest patches exhibit higher PD because species living on those patches may be 

able to disperse and colonize waterbodies within rice crops if these are sufficiently close 

to ensure dispersal and survival. Similarly, variation in FD, which considers every 

functional trait jointly, increased with higher mean forest patch and waterbody area. Both 

dimensions highlight a pattern of increased diversity in waterbodies closer to many others 

and large forest patches, emphasizing the importance of forest patches and waterbodies in 

maintaining diverse anuran communities in agricultural landscapes. Distance from forest 

patch has been considered an important predictor of species richness, especially for 

species with low dispersal ability (Otto et al. 2007; Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011, Silva et 

al. 2011). Due to amphibian’s ecophysiological limitations (Duellman and Trueb 1994), 

low mobility (Gibbs 1998), and high mortality during dispersal through roads or 

agricultural matrices (Becker et al. 2007), colonizing isolated ponds is impossible for 

some species and leads to selective exclusion from these waterbodies (Silva and Rossa- 

Feres 2011). PD and FD are important aspects of ecosystem resilience (Allen et al. 2005; 

Cisneros et al. 2014), the ability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while maintaining 

key functions (Folke et al. 2004), increasingly crucial considering global changes and 

increased human pressure on ecosystems. Ecosystem resilience safeguards vital services 

upon which humans and biodiversity depend, such as seed dispersal, pollination, and pest 

control (Foley et al. 2005). Ecosystems are more resilient when every function is fulfilled 

by at least one species. Due to their ecological importance, loss of anuran diversity may 



Chapter 5  

	 238	

affect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience and resistance 

(Davic and Welsh 2004). 

The importance of landscape and local features for anuran assemblages was trait- 

specific. Anuran biomass and several traits (anuran activity, habitat, clutch size and range 

size diversity) showed increased diversity with increased waterbody proximity and area.  

Waterbody proximity, abundance and area has been determined as important for species 

diversity and abundance, often linked to the amphibian’s need to avoid desiccation 

(Salazar et al. 2016). Due to diurnal environmental constraints, such as high temperatures 

and low humidity, most anurans from the Cerrado are nocturnal, while diurnal anuran are 

usually more associated to forest physiognomies (Olalla-Tárraga et al. 2009). Hence, 

distance to the closest waterbody may determine dispersion survival and, consequently, 

success in colonizing new waterbodies. Waterbody networks also offer increased shelter, 

calling, oviposition, and foraging site availability, in numerous waterbodies located 

relatively closer to each other. More isolated waterbodies may present increased 

desiccation risk during migration, as well as lower microhabitat availability, possibility 

with every shelter/oviposition/foraging site saturated, leading to competitive exclusion of 

some species (Becker et al. 2007, Russildi et al. 2016). Therefore, waterbody networks 

are especially important for amphibian communities in agricultural landscapes due to the 

often hostile conditions of those environments. Networks provide increased dispersion 

success, and higher availability of ecological niches, calling and oviposition sites, making 

them of the utmost importance for sustaining diverse anuran communities in agricultural 

landscapes.  

Range diversity also increased with increasing forest area. The presence of forest 

patches in the vicinities of the waterbody allows the subsistence of less generalist species 

that probably use the patches as shelter and occasionally breed in agricultural waterbodies 

close by (Silva and Rossa-Feres 2011, Silva et al. 2011), causing an increased diversity in 

range size.  

Anuran SVL, habits, breeding strategies and parental care diversity increased with 

increasing bare ground, vegetation height and shaded ground, expressing the ability that 

waterbodies more marginal to rice crops have to sustain increased trait diversity than

	 239	

waterbodies embedded in the agricultural matrix. Indeed, both percentage of bare ground 

and vegetation height have been considered important for amphibian abundance and 

diversity, due to its direct influence on amphibian desiccation risk and reproductive 

success (Scheele et al. 2012, Cline and Hunter 2014). Larger anurans tend to incur in 

increased desiccation risk due a larger surface area, which may explain increased SVL 

diversity in marginal waterbodies, with increased shelter availability and microclimate 

stability, due to diverse marginal vegetation (Olalla-Tárraga et al. 2009). This explains 

why waterbodies embedded in rice crops appear to be mainly colonized by smaller 

species, with similar habits and breeding strategies. Marginal waterbodies offer increased 

microhabitat diversity and availability, hosting an increased diversity of species with 

diverse traits. Waterbodies embedded in rice crops offer little breeding site diversity, 

which explains why waterbodies marginal to the crops held increased diversity in traits 

related to breeding strategies. 

Our study is the first to approach how scale-dependent features shape anuran 

functional and phylogenetic diversity in agricultural landscapes. Our results emphasize 

the importance of creating and/or conserving networks of abundant and large forest 

patches and waterbodies for sustaining higher levels of FD and PD in agricultural 

landscapes. As both PD and FD are known to greatly contribute to ecosystem resilience, 

we believe the patterns observed for anuran communities are of the utmost importance 

for managing of agricultural lands, especially in the tropics, where agricultural expansion 

is unrelenting and biodiversity is especially high and unique.

6.1 Abstract 

Habitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of biodiversity decline in 

agricultural landscapes. Enhancing connectivity among fragmented habitats is therefore 

pivotal for conservation planning. Amphibians are frequently characterized as having 

limited dispersal abilities, strong site fidelity and spatially distant breeding habitats. Hence, 

success in amphibian conservation, restoration or management can only be achieved by 

evaluating how structural connectivity relates to a species’ functional connectivity. We 

performed graph-theoretic network analysis to a set of waterbodies embedded in rice crops, 

to estimate the importance of each waterbody to the connectivity of the entire network. We 

used anuran diversity metrics (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) as proxies 

of anuran functional connectivity, as species diversity has previously been related with 

landscape connectivity. We found that forest patch area and abundance, as well as waterbody 

area in the vicinities of a waterbody, were the most important predictors of waterbody 

importance for connectivity. Although our approach of network analysis followed the 

simplest model, and cannot be generalized to other cases without caution, our results suggest 

that, in order to maximize pond network connectivity for amphibians in rice crops, we must 

ensure the existence of (i) abundant and large forest patches in the area surrounding 

waterbodies, and (ii) a network of abundant waterbodies.

6.2 Introduction 
Natural habitat loss and fragmentation are the main causes of biodiversity loss in 

agricultural landscapes (Liira et al., 2008). The effects of habitat fragmentation on species 

richness and composition have been extensively studied (Ockinger et al., 2010). However, little 

is known about how fragmentation affects other facets of biodiversity, such as functional or 

phylogenetic diversity. Fragmentation can indeed affect plant functional diversity directly (e.g. 

by promoting traits associated to long distance dispersal when fragment isolation increases) and 

indirectly (e.g. by decreasing species richness, hence trait diversity, when fragment area 

decreases) (Magnago et al., 2014; Sonnier et al., 2014). Certain ecological traits, such as 

naturally low population size, strong habitat specialization, large body size and low mobility 

have been shown to be associated to a increased sensitivity to fragmentation in some vertebrate 

groups (Ewers and Didham, 2006; Henle et al., 2004; Laurance, 1991; Viveiros De Castro and 

Fernandez, 2004). A common explanation for this phenomenon is that habitat fragmentation 

may filter species with particular sets of traits, leading to trait convergence (Grime, 2006) and 

decreased functional diversity. Although the identification of these traits is critical for designing 

species-specific conservation strategies (Kotiaho et al., 2005; Purvis et al., 2000), few studies 

have addressed the effects of habitat fragmentation on functional or phylogenetic diversity.  

A wide range of measures has been developed to quantify habitat connectivity that either 

measure structural or functional connectivity (Tischendorf and Fahrig, 2000). Structural 

connectivity can be easily determined, for example, by calculating landscape metrics obtained 

from geographic information systems, or simply by estimating geographic distances among 

habitats or populations. Because it is easily measured, structural connectivity is often used as a 

proxy for functional connectivity, although the response of species may not necessarily be 

equivalent to the spatial configuration and composition of a landscape (Tischendorf and Fahrig, 

2000). Functional connectivity can be measured either by directly observing the movement of 

species, for example, by radio-tracking or mark-recapture studies, or indirectly by using 

population genetic data (Keller et al., 2010).  

Enhancing connectivity among fragmented habitats is a major goals of conservation

planning (Brückmann et al., 2010). However, success in conservation, restoration or ecological 

management can only be achieved by evaluating to which degree an increase in structural 

connectivity (for example, the creation of stepping stones) improves the functional connectivity 

of target species. Because structural connectivity is generally used as an equivalent of functional 

connectivity in conservation, ecological literature and even management plans, it may lead to 

inaccurate and unsuccessful conservation schemes (Taylor et al., 2006).  

Models such as “least cost path analysis” (e.g., LaRue and Nielsen, 2008), or “graph-

theoretic” models are often used to study connectivity and aid in management planning. One of 

the most popular approaches in meta-population ecology, is patch-based monitoring, wherein 

species occupancy is recorded in a network of discrete habitat patches of varying size and 

isolation. Attributes of the habitat patches, matrix areas, and/or the species of interest are used 

in a modeling framework to determine how strongly connectivity and other factors influence 

species occupancy, colonization, or extinction probabilities. Patch connectivity can be measured 

in a variety of ways, from the simplest nearest-neighbor distance to more complex formulas that 

include patch distances, areas, species dispersal abilities, and other scaling parameters (Hanski 

1994b).  

Graph-theoretic connectivity metrics combine the attributes of habitats and populations 

with the dispersal behavior of species (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007). In graph-theoretic 

approaches, the habitat patches or populations (nodes) are connected by links, for example, 

geographic distances (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007; Saura and Torné, 2009). Nodes are 

considered connected if the internode distance is lower than, for example, the maximum 

dispersal distance of a focal species (that is, structural connectivity). Based on the topology of 

a network, it is possible to determine the most critical network elements—nodes as well as 

links—for maintaining the structural connectivity of habitat patches or populations in a 

landscape. Graph theory (Harary, 1977) has been taken from its original mathematical context 

and is nowadays applied to many other purposes, such as understanding biological process as 

food webs, community stability and gene networks (Proulx et al., 2005). This approach has been

suggested as a useful tool in assisting decision making for conservation purposes (Saura and 

Pascual- Hortal, 2007). The application to landscape ecology is not new (Risser et al. 1984) but 

it was not until recently that it started to be used for conservation practices (Jordán et al., 

2007; Minor and Urban, 2008; Vasas et al., 2009). Despite the increasing application of graph-

based connectivity metrics in recent years, studies relating these measures to estimates of 

functional connectivity, such as gene flow, or to genetic diversity, remain scarce (Dyer et al., 

2012; Neel, 2008).  

Amphibians are the most endangered vertebrates worldwide (Wake and Vredenburg, 

2008). Due to their biphasic life cycle, highly permeable skin and ectothermic physiology, 

amphibians are very dependent on environmental quality and vulnerable to its change (Niemi 

and McDonald, 2004). These specificities, combined with their restricted dispersal ability 

(Bowne and Bowers, 2004; Russell et al., 2005), demand an integrated local and landscape-level 

approach when planning for amphibian conservation and habitat management. Pond breeding 

amphibians have reproductive populations associated with ponds distributed over the landscape, 

being often considered to follow meta-population dynamics (but see Smith and Green, 2005). 

Thus, landscape connectivity and, specifically, pond connectivity is of extreme importance for 

the long- term persistence of these populations, since it may buffer the stochastic events to which 

ponds (particularly Mediterranean ponds) are extremely prone (Compton et al., 2007; Cushman, 

2005) Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem functioning, act as both predators and prey, 

enable nutrient transport between aquatic and terrestrial systems and are among the most diverse 

and abundant vertebrates, comprising species from a variety of habits, breeding strategies and 

dispersal abilities. Hence, the importance of amphibian communities is intrinsically related to 

vital ecosystem processes and, consequently, ecosystem resilience and resistance (Davic and 

Welsh, 2004).  

In this study, we applied network analysis to a set of waterbodies whose amphibian 

communities were sampled, in order to establish the structural importance of each individual 

waterbody to the connectivity of the entire network. With this procedure, we characterize each 

waterbody regarding relative connectivity and corresponding amphibian diversity. The latter 

has previously been related with landscape connectivity (Bailey et al., 2010) and, although, with

constraints, it is a very straightforward measure of biological response to the environment. Since 

connectivity is not the only parameter that influences suitability of a waterbody for amphibians, 

we added several local waterbody (e.g., percentage of bare ground, herbaceous vegetation, 

shrubs and trees, aquatic vegetation) and landscape characteristics (e.g. distance to the closest 

waterbody, total waterbody area and total forest patch area within a 500 m buffer) considered 

important for amphibians. We intend to assess the relation between each waterbody importance 

for connectivity with those variables, in order to better contribute to more effective management 

recommendations. First, we evaluated whether graph-based estimates of structural connectivity 

reflect functional connectivity, measured as anuran taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic 

diversity. Afterwards, we examined the relationship between local and landscape pond 

characteristics on waterbody importance for connectivity. We hypothesized that forest patch 

area and waterbody structural heterogeneity would affect pond importance for connectivity in 

the agricultural matrix.  

	

6.3 Methods 
6.3.1 Study area and sampling design 

This study took place in an ecotone region between the Amazon rainforest and the 

Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado, in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Sampled rice crops are located 

in the municipal district of Lagoa da Confusão. The agricultural landscapes of the Cerrado-

Amazon ecotone are characterized by the presence of ipucas, “islands” of closed native 

vegetation which remain flooded longer than the surrounding areas. These structures are 

characterized by the abundance of certain plants (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense) and presence of 

endemic animals (e.g. Rhipidomys ipukensis). Because converting an ipuca into cropland results 

in very low crop yields, due to their inherent inappropriateness for agricultural exploration, the 

agricultural landscapes of the Tocantins state are quite peculiar, with vast crop areas speckled

by many “islands” of native vegetation of variable dimensions.

	 253	

The region is a seasonally flooded area, with two large rivers, Formoso and Javaés, and 

a very pronounced rainy season from October to April.  

Irrigated rice fields in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone present a dynamic hydrologic 

regime, with variation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. When rice is being grown, from 

December to April, rice fields remain with surface water until harvest, before which crops are 

completely drained. After rice harvesting, crops may remain fallow or other crops, such as soy 

or watermelon, may be cultivated, depending on the landowner’s will. Besides rice fields, the 

region’s landscape is also occupied by pasture areas, where cows, emus or water buffalos roam.  

In order to ensure that we represented most of the environmental variability of this 

agricultural landscape, a total of 10 rice fields were chosen along the Rio Formoso irrigation 

project (Fig. 6.1). Rice fields varied in size, ipuca abundance and dimensions and waterbody 

abundance and size. We selected 3 to 4 lentic waterbodies for anuran sampling in each rice field, 

totalizing 35 waterbodies. Waterbodies were chosen based on type, size and hydroperiod. We 

chose small (25 m2) to large (1200 m2) temporary lentic waterbodies.  

 

6.3.2 Anuran surveys 

 Agricultural surveys were conducted during two rainy seasons, from February 2013 to 

April 2014. Anuran sampling was performed using nocturnal visual encounter surveys along the 

10 m wide margin of each waterbody, for approximately 30 min. Every individual seen perched 

on the vegetation, on the floor, under the leaf litter, logs or stones was caught, identified, 

measured, weighed, photographed and then released near the site of origin. 

 

 

6.3.3 Local waterbodies characteristics 

Environmental variables such as percentage of bare ground, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs, 

trees, shaded ground, leaf litter, logs/rocks, aquatic vegetation, herbaceous vegetation height, 



Chapter 6  

254	

	

shrub vegetation height, herbaceous vegetation heterogeneity and shrub vegetation 

heterogeneity were registered.  These variables were quantified performing transects (10 m long 

x 1 m wide) set on the sampled waterbody margin. For every meter, a 50 cm x 50 cm grid 

would be placed above the ground and the number of squares with 50% or more coverage of 

each variable would be summed and divided by the total (25 squares). 

 

6.3.4 Landscape features 

We quantified landscape structure for each waterbody using Google Earth satellite 

imagery representing the landscape of the year 2014 and corroborated the main features on the 

field. For each of the 35 sampled waterbodies, we quantified distance to the closest waterbody, 

distance to the closest forest patch and number of waterbodies, number of forest patches, total 

waterbody area, total forest area, mean forest patch area and mean waterbody area within 500 

m, 1000 m and 1500 m buffers. While compositional features, such as number of forest patches 

or total waterbody area describe the proportions of different types of land use within the area 

surrounding a waterbody, configurational features, such as distance to the closest forest patch 

or waterbody, specify the geometric arrangement of land features surrounding a waterbody. We 

quantified landscape characteristics at three spatial scales (buffers of 500, 1000 and 1500 m 

radius) that we found significant for amphibians, regarding known dispersal abilities, to account 

for interspecific differences in anuran dispersal and ability to endure in agricultural systems.  

 

6.3.5 Trait Data 

We compiled life history and ecological traits for every anuran species registered in the 

agricultural and pristine study areas. For each species we compiled information of 12 traits: 

activity, habits, habitat, fossorial behavior, adult snout-vent length (SVL), breeding site, 

breeding strategy, clutch size, parental care, breeding season, breeding pattern and geographic 

range size. We chose these traits based on perceived importance for determining species 

resilience to agricultural activities (Table A1) and on data availability. We compiled trait data 

from the literature, the AmphibiaWeb and IUCN online databases. If published data were 

unavailable, we relied on expert opinion or inferred trait information based on closely related 



                                            Anuran Functional Connectivity In Rice Crops: A Graph-Theoretic Approach 

	

	 255	

species. Because breeding site, breeding season and breeding pattern were very homogeneous 

along the agricultural anuran community, we decided to exclude these three traits from the 

following analyses.  

 

6.3.6 Biodiversity metrics  

We quantified TD at each site, using Simpson’s diversity index (Simpson, 1949), and 

FD and PD using Rao’s quadratic entropy (Botta-Dukát, 2005). These metrics facilitate 

comparison among these three dimensions because Rao’s Q is an extended form of Simpson’s 

index that includes information on species dissimilarities. Rao’s Q corresponds to the sum of 

functional or phylogenetic distances between all species, weighted by the product of their 

relative abundances and describes the abundance- weighted average difference among species 

from a community (Weiher, 2011). Functional and phylogenetic distances between species were 

obtained from pairwise dissimilarity matrices for all traits combined and for the phylogeny. 

Functional pairwise dissimilarity matrices were calculated using the Gower distance matrix, 

which quantifies dissimilarities with categorical and numeric attributes simultaneously (Botta-

Dukát, 2005). To promote meaningful comparisons among dimensions, we transformed each 

metric into its effective number of species (Jost, 2007), allowing direct interpretation of 

differences among indices (Jost, 2007). We calculated FD with function dfFD from package 

FD, and PD and TD with function raoD from package picante on program R.  

 

6.3.7 Network analysis  

Studies on dispersal ability of amphibians reveal that the maximum walked distance is 

very variable among species (Kovar et al., 2009; Smith and Green, 2005), ranging from 10 to 

2000 m. We therefore, established four thresholds: 250, 500, 800 and 1000 m. We then tested 

at which threshold the relationship with anuran diversity lost significance. For each threshold 

and diversity metric, we calculated node importance for connectivity of the entire pond network. 

We used correlation analysis to relate the waterbody importance for connectivity to the diversity 



Chapter 6

metrics of the pond-breeding amphibians.  

Nodes were characterized by three diversity metrics (TD, FD and PD), and links 

were represented using Euclidean distances between meta-populations. Species richness has 

previously been related with landscape connectivity (Bailey et al., 2010) and used to assess pond 

network connectivity for amphibians (Ribeiro et al., 2011). Although with constraints, it is a 

very reliable measure of biological response to the environment. We used taxonomic diversity, 

but also functional and phylogenetic diversity to assess pond connectivity, as both FD and PD 

constitute more accurate representations of anuran diversity, dispersal constraints and more 

thorough guidance for management actions.  

Two graph-based connectivity indices, the integral index of connectivity (IIC) and the 

probability of connectivity (PC), have been shown to perform best for the purpose of 

prioritization of habitats and links (Saura and Pascual-Hortal, 2007; Saura and Torné, 2009). 
We chose IIC for evaluating the importance of each waterbody for connectivity. IIC ranges 

between 0 and 1 and is defined as:  

!!" =
$%$&amp;amp;

1 + )*%&amp;amp;

+

&amp;amp;,-

+

%,-
 

 

where n is the total number of nodes in the landscape, ai and aj are the attributes of nodes i and 

j and nlij is the number of links (distances) between nodes i and j. IIC is based on a binary 

connection model that means that two nodes are either considered connected or not depending 

on the actual distance between them in relation to the predefined distance threshold. In 

CONEFOR 2.6, the prioritization of each node for maintaining landscape connectivity is 

calculated as the percentage of the variation of IIC resulting from the removal of a given node 

from the landscape:  

.* % = 100×! ? !345674!

	 257	

 

where I is the overall index value (IIC) for all initially existing nodes in the landscape, and 

Iremove is the overall index value after the removal of a given node from the landscape. To 

estimate the effects of landscape variables on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity 

as a measure of functional connectivity, we used Euclidian distance, and the local and landscape 

variables for each waterbody.  

 

6.3.8 Quantitative analyses  

We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the effects of 

local and landscape features on waterbody connectivity considering TD, FD and PD as anuran 

diversity metrics.  

Because the 1000 and 1500 m buffers used to characterize the surroundings of each 

waterbody included other waterbodies within the same rice field, we used rice field as random 

effect. Random effects are especially useful for inferring on a population when the data available 

are random samples of that population, assuming it is a meta-population, and that our sample 

reflects many draws from that population. So rather than anchoring results around 

heterogeneous intercepts, the data will be used to elucidate the parameters of that distribution 

from which data were drawn. 

Model fit for each dependent variable was manually assessed from the null model, to 

avoid automatic variable elimination for the sake of model fit optimization only. We choose to 

assess model fit and predictor significance through F-tests performed among nested models for 

connectivity described by FD, PD and TD. We progressively evaluated each predictor’s 

significance, and then fitted reduced models with the most significant predictors, finally 

assessing the reduced models’ fit against the full model, using F tests. We fit all models using 

the lme4 package (Bates 2007). 

We performed hierarchical partitioning (HP) to further determine the relative 

independent importance of each significant variable. We determined the statistical significance 



Chapter 6  

258	

	

of each independent variable’s independent contribution using a randomization approach with 

5000 iterations and an alpha- level of 0.05 (Mac Nally, 2002). We executed hierarchical 

partitioning using package ‘hier.part’ (MacNally &amp;amp; Walsh, 2004). 

 

6.4 Results 
The effects of structural graph-theoretic connectivity measures on taxonomic, functional 

and phylogenetic diversity were different but consistent. Depending on the distance threshold 

considered, we detected significant correlations between node importance and estimates of 

diversity. TD was significantly correlated to node importance considering the 250, 500 and 800 

m thresholds (r250=0.81, p-value = 3.721e- 09; r500=0.81, p-value=3.721e-09; r800=0.64, p-

value=3.291e-05). FD was significantly correlated to node importance in the 250 and 500 m 

thresholds (r250=0.51, p-value = 0.001705; r500=0.51, p-value = 0.001705). PD was 

significantly correlated to node importance considering three thresholds (r250=0.66, p-value = 

1.812e-05; r500=0.66, p- value = 1.812e-05; r800=0.55, p-value = 0.000608).  

Local variables were important predictors of node importance regarding taxonomic, 

functional and phylogenetic diversity (Table 6.1). Regarding TD and PD, node importance 

decreased with increasing shaded ground. Regarding FD, node importance increased with 

increasing abundance of shrubs and trees in the waterbody margin.  

The most important landscape predictors of node importance were also consistent. 

Number of forest patches, total forest area and mean waterbody area in the vicinities of the 

waterbodies were the most important predictors of node importance for connectivity regarding 

the three diversity metrics used (Table 6.1). Regarding TD, waterbody importance increased 7% 

with total forest area and number of forest patches (Fig. 6.2A, B). Regarding FD, node 

importance increased 83% with increasing mean waterbody area in the vicinities of the 

waterbodies (Fig. 6.2C). Regarding PD, node importance increased 8% with increasing number 
of forest patches and total forest area in the vicinity of each waterbody (Fig. 6.2D, E).

The most significant predictors for the GLMM models were in agreement with the HP 

results (Table 6.1), which determines the independent contribution from each predictor.

6.5 Discussion 
 The significant positive relationship between anuran diversity metrics and pond 

importance clearly demonstrates that there is an association between structural and functional 

connectivity. The adoption of TD, FD and PD as proxies for functional connectivity is based on 

the premise that more accessible sites will host more species, traits and lineages, considering 

habitat suitability is equal. Regarding TD, the most accessible waterbody will host more species. 

Regarding FD, more traits will be represented in a waterbody widely accessible to the trait 

ensemble of the local community. Regarding PD, more lineages will be represented in the most 

accessible waterbodies.  

Node importance depends on amphibian functional connectivity, in this case represented 

by anuran diversity metrics. Given that diversity metrics also represent habitat suitability, as 

more species will breed successfully in more suitable waterbodies, functional connectivity may 

be overestimated if those factors related to habitat quality are not accounted for. Hence, we 

regressed node importance measured according to the three proxies of functional connectivity 

against local habitat and landscape variables. Functional connectivity can only be affected by 

species intrinsic dispersal ability or by landscape features.  

 Amphibian functional connectivity within this agricultural landscape was positively 

related to node importance at distance thresholds between 250 and 800 m, depending on the 

metric used. The relation of the landscape connectivity with anuran diversity metrics is 

unambiguous, indicating that the accumulation of amphibian species, traits and lineages in 

breeding ponds is, even if partially, related to the spatial position of the pond in relation to the 

other ponds nearby. Our results corroborate those found by Cunningham et al. (2007) and 

Ribeiro et al. (2011). In fact, according to Cunningham et al. (2007), wetland connectivity is the 

best variable in distinguishing wetlands with high amphibian species richness from those with 

low species richness. Although species richness is an elementary measurement of regional 

diversity and extremely useful in conservation planning, it could be misleading and simplistic, 

as accounting only for species number leaves important community and ecosystem-level

parameters unassessed. For example, in this study the maximum distance threshold at which 

structural and functional connectivity were correlated was 500 m regarding trait diversity (FD) 

and 800 m regarding taxonomic and phylogenic diversity. This means that if traits related 

to low dispersal ability were represented by only one or two species that are unable to disperse 

beyond 500 m, they would not be represented in waterbodies beyond that threshold. However, 

this absence would probably not be translated into significantly lower taxonomic or 

phylogenetic diversity, which illustrates the importance of taking more that a single avenue to 

reach conclusions on the effects on anthropization of biodiversity.  

 Pond breeding amphibians typically exist in local populations associated with discrete 

breeding pools. With low dispersal ability and the potential for asynchronous dynamics among 

local populations, meta-population dynamics may play an important role in long-term 

population persistence (Gamble et al., 2007; Semlitsch, 2002; Smith and Green, 2005), 

especially in unstable anthropogenic landscapes. Hence, conservation efforts limited to the 

protection of individual pools may be ineffective over the long term if connectivity among pools 

is not maintained (Gibbs and Shriver, 2005; Gibbs, 1993). Indeed, maintaining and enhancing 

spatial connectivity among fragmented natural and semi-natural habitats is one of the main 

challenges for ecological management and conservation biology. However, although the 

structural properties of landscapes are widely used as indicators of biodiversity in practical 

landscape planning, they may not have a straightforward effect on functional connectivity, i.e., 

the way each species responds to landscape structure (Tischendorf and Fahrig, 2000). In this 

study, we used several local and landscape variables and a graph-theory based index to assess 

which features are more determinant for increasing waterbody importance for connectivity in a 

pond network embedded in an agricultural landscape. We found that total forest patch area and 

abundance within 1000 m from a waterbody, and mean waterbody area within the 500 m from 

a waterbody, were the most important predictors of node importance for connectivity.  

 The importance of forest fragments for dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes has been 

identified before. Janin et al. (2009) found that the landscape matrix strongly influenced toad 

occurrence, with forests and meadows causing low resistance to toad movement, and crops 

posing intermediate to high resistance to toad movement. Popescu and Hunter (2011) found

clear-cuts to be significant barriers to amphibian dispersal, altering the movements of emigrating 

juveniles from waterbodies. The low permeability of clear-cuts and other open-canopy habitats 

to juvenile amphibian movement has been previously recorded (Rothermel and Semlitsch, 2002; 

Rothermel, 2004). Hence, promoting the persistence of amphibian populations in anthropogenic 

landscapes must involve the preservation or creation of forest habitats adjacent to breeding sites 

(Todd et al., 2009).  

Although our approach of network analysis followed the simplest model (euclidean 

distance and no weighing of the different ponds), and cannot be generalized to other cases 

without caution, our results suggest that in order to maximize pond network connectivity for 

amphibians in rice crops we must ensure that abundant and large forest patches are present in 

the vicinities of the waterbodies, and that we must create or preserve a network of abundant

General discussion and conclusions 

	 271	

7.1. Effects of anthropization on the Cerrado anurans 
 The Cerrado is currently under major anthropogenic pressure and the limited 

knowledge available on the biome’s biodiversity is evident; new species are constantly being 

described and large portions of the biome have never been adequately sampled. Unfortunately 

this poses a very clear impairment on the development of effective management and 

conservation plans. 

 The anurofauna of the Cerrado has a series of ecophysiological traits that may 

render them more resistant to anthropic disturbances than Neotropical forest anurans. 

Characteristic fossorial habits and specialized breeding structures such as foam nests might in 

fact be responsible for the increased resistance of some Cerrado anurans in disturbed habitats, 

such as crops and pastures. However, much like what has been acknowledged in other biomes, 

anthropogenic areas are dominated by widespread, generalist species. Hence, although crops 

and pastures can harbor a seemingly diverse anuran community, there will be a strong 

dominance by resilient species, favoring generalists and excluding anuran specialists. 

Nonetheless, natural vegetation fragments, earthen irrigation channels and shallow depressions 

that support perennial ponds and aquatic vegetation appear to be important landscape features 

for promoting the use of rice fields by anurans.   

 The massive and omnipresent use of agrochemicals in the Cerrado is bound to act 

synergistically with crop and pasture setting and management. In fact, the scarce studies 

available identified pesticides on living tissue of generalist species, which may indicate that 

even these seemingly resilient species have low fitness. Furthermore, chytridiomycosis has 

also been recorded in many species extant in the biome, including Cerrado endemics. Given 

the declines this disease is known to cause, it may be causing severe unacknowledged 

declines. 

 The Cerrado anurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to the development of 

hydroelectric projects, as even previously common, widespread and generalist species 

declined or disappeared after flooding.  

 Latest predictions indicate that the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed 

northwards, dramatically reducing the proportion of remaining natural habitats, in synergy 

with climate change, leading to a great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable 



Chapter 7 

	 272	

natural habitats will remain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to 

less than half. Future climate changes will be especially detrimental for endemic anurans, with 

small potential current distribution.  

 This review allowed me to conclude that, contrary to widespread belief, the 

biodiversity of the Amazon is not the only one enduring aggressive threats in Brazil. The 

anurofauna of the Cerrado is under an unacknowledged high extinction risk and in urgent need 

of more scientific studies and conservation and management projects. It is urgent to direct the 

attention to the Brazilian savanna. The scientific community must help establish the Cerrado 

as a valuable biome with major ecological importance. Detailed demographic and community-

level studies on Cerrado amphibians are badly needed, namely abundance and diversity 

studies for adult, juveniles and larvae/eggs.  

 

7.2.  Conservation priorities for the anurofauna of the Cerrado 
In spite of the broad and aggressive character of the anthropogenic conversion of the 

Brazilian Cerrado, species do not respond equally to the same threats. The most vulnerable 

anurans in the Cerrado are a highly non-random subset of the anurofauna, composed of lotic 

breeders and habitat specialists with small clutches, large body sizes and small geographic 

ranges. Specialization has been associated to increased susceptibility to environmental change. 

Variables describing direct human impacts apparently had no effect on extinction risk, perhaps 

because populations of threatened species may have already been extirpated from the most 

disturbed habitats before assessments occurred (Cardillo et al., 2005; Tingley et al., 2013) or 

detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities have such broad, across species consequences, 

that end up being detrimental to all species.  

 This particular study demonstrates that the extinction risk of amphibians worldwide 

may be severely underestimated, especially in scarcely studied and highly anthropic biomes. A 

large proportion of species predicted as sensitive and/or decreasing is currently listed as LC or 

DD by the IUCN Red List. Given the difficulties intrinsic to studying amphibians, adopting 

predictive integrative trait-based approaches may give us insight into “accidents waiting to 

happen” and help prioritize regions for scientific projects or conservation actions. 



General discussion and conclusions 

	 273	

 The center of the Cerrado is the biome’s main hotspot for high extinction-risk anurans 

and about 70% of the anuran species considered are major conservation gaps, while only 29 

species are adequately protected. Hence, not only the extinction risk of the Cerrado 

anurofauna appears severely underestimated, but also the current PA network is insufficient to 

protect at least 50% of the minimum area required for ensuring the protection of 141 species. 

 This study underscores the importance of adopting more specific and integrative 

approaches to extinction risk, considering species ecology and landscape metrics to better 

guide conservation and management policies. The cost-effective and integrative approach we 

presented may be of special value for biodiverse regions, with strong anthropogenic pressure, 

but weak government support and scarce funding for conservation actions. Brazil is currently 

experiencing extremely high economic demands and, after long decades of raising public 

awareness to the importance of protecting the Amazon rainforest, other biomes have been 

targeted to fulfill social and economic pressures. Frameworks such as ours may shed light into 

which areas and species need more protection and what is the minimum protection each 

species needs to endure.  

 

7.3. Neotropical anuran communities from rice crops 
 Habitat conversion and agricultural management caused profound alterations to the 

anuran community of a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone area, with dramatic loss of species diversity 

and functional richness and increase in functional divergence. Community composition 

suffered severe alterations, resulting in dominance of generalist hylids and leptodactylids and 

low representation of specialist microhylids and bufonids. Anuran communities in rice fields 

exhibited decreased phylogenetic diversity and mean phylogenetic distance, and increased 

mean nearest phylogenetic distance, suggesting that anuran communities in agricultural areas 

are composed of a few phylogenetically related species and, therefore, not as diverse as their 

pristine counterparts. 

 Functional and phylogenetic diversity indices provide deeper insights into the complex 

effects that disturbances have on biodiversity (Cornwell et al., 2006). Functional richness in 

particular has been invoked as a good predictor of ecosystem services because it describes 

species traits and represents the capacity of each species to provide a particular service (D??az 



Chapter 7 

	 274	

and Cabido, 2001). Our study corroborates such conceptions because, although anuran species 

richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were significantly lower in rice fields, 

taxonomic diversity did not vary significantly. Amphibians play keystone roles in ecosystem 

functioning; in food webs, they act as both predators on invertebrates and small vertebrates 

and as prey for larger animals, establishing an avenue for nutrient transport between aquatic 

and terrestrial systems. Loss of amphibian functional richness and increased functional 

divergence may affect vital ecosystem processes and contribute to loss of system resilience 

and resistance (Davic and Welsh, 2004). 

 Understanding how species traits correlate with their responses to agriculture will 

allow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use (Newbold et al., 

2013). Diversity itself is an important component of ecosystem resilience because diverse 

communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to a single given 

function. Small geographic ranges, association with forest and open area habitats, small 

clutches and large body size were associated with low to null species abundances in rice fields. 

However, our results show that the conversion of natural Cerrado-Amazon vegetation to vast 

rice fields results in such environmental stresses, that large subsets of species are driven to 

local extinction irrespective of their specialization. Species commonly perceived as resilient to 

habitat alteration did not occur in these environments (e.g. Leptodactylus labyrinthicus, Heyer, 

2005), which indicates that the new environmental filters, arisen as a consequence of replacing 

native vegetation with rice fields, are more detrimental on Neotropical anurans than expected. 

 Anuran biomass, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and specific trait 

diversity were positively influenced by the presence and abundance of landscape features such 

as waterbodies and forest patches. These metrics increased with decreasing distance to the 

closest waterbody and increasing waterbody abundance and forest patch area. Hence, these 

landscape features are crucial for maintaining more diverse anuran communities in agricultural 

landscapes.  

 The lower body condition observed in frogs from cultivated sites is an indication that 

these animals have reduced fitness and suggests that ecologically relevant parameters such as 

reproductive output and survival may be impaired in these populations (Brodeur et al., 2011). 



General discussion and conclusions 

	 275	

 Meta-population theory, the source-sink concept and adaptations of island 

biogeography theory all stress that habitat patches vary in their capacity to maintain 

populations (due to variation in their size, resources, microclimate, etc.), and that a subset of 

patches may be pivotal to network viability (Whittaker and Fernández-Palacios, 2007). Indeed, 

meta-population persistence in fragmented landscapes depends on the ability of habitat 

patches to support resilient local populations and sufficient connectivity between patches. 

Amphibians are frequently characterized as having limited dispersal abilities, strong site 

fidelity and spatially distant breeding habitat. Investigating how landscape structure influences 

amphibian populations is crucial, and measuring connectivity has been recognized as critical 

to the study of fragmented populations. We found that forest patch area and abundance, as 

well as waterbody area, were the most important predictors of waterbody importance for 

connectivity. Although our approach of network analysis followed the simplest model, and 

cannot be generalized to other cases without caution, our results suggest that in order to 

maximize pond network connectivity for amphibians in rice crops we must ensure that 

abundant and large forest patches are present in the vicinities of the breeding sites, and that a 

network of abundant waterbodies must be preserved or even created. 

 Anuran communities in crops have considerable economic potential, acting as pest 

control and contributing to increased crop yield. We believe the patterns we detected on 

anuran communities are of the utmost importance for managing agro-ecosystems, especially in 

the Neotropics, where agricultural expansion is unrelenting and biodiversity especially high 

and unique. 

 Local diversity, a proportion of regional richness (e.g. Holt et al., 2002; Meatyard, 

2005), can be expected to be lower in agroecosystems than in natural ecosystems, because of 

their high disturbance levels. In fact, crop fields have been described as “defaunated islands, 

relying on colonization from the regional species pool” (Tscharntke et al., 2005). Managing 

such disturbed ecosystems depends on a diversity of source populations in the surrounding 

landscape, which assure the resilience of the systems for sustainable use (Folke et al., 1996). 

 Although organic farming has been often touted as the solution for ensuring 

biodiversity preservation in crops, landscape context is also important (Bengtsson et al., 2005). 

In fact, the species pool of the landscape from which local communities are drawn may be 



Chapter 7 

	 276	

even more important than the difference between organic and conventional agriculture, For 

example, Schmidt and Tscharntke (2005) and Schmidt et al. (2005) found the diversity of 

spiders to increase with landscape complexity, but not farming system. The negative impact of 

intensive farming may happen only in simple landscapes, with little colonization from the 

surrounding areas, whereas complex landscapes appear to mitigate the effects of actions 

associated to the management of intensively grown crops. Hence, in simple agricultural 

landscapes, such as vast rice crop areas, local habitat creation or management changes may be 

important for reducing isolation from sources of colonizers, thereby improving ecosystem 

services (see Bengtsson et al., 2003).   

 

7.4. Management guidelines and implications 
 Brazil is currently facing extremely high economic demands, which reinforces the need 

for thorough, viable and cost-effective conservation and management actions.  

 I recommend the protected areas’ network of the Cerrado to be revised to include 

pristine regions still remaining in the center of the biome, as this is the region with the largest 

concentration of high extinction anurans, major conservation gaps and strongest anthropogenic 

pressure. In simple landscapes, such as vast monocultures, local habitat creation or 
management may be the solution to reducing isolation from sources of colonizers and improve 

ecosystem services. In concrete, maintaining or creating a network of abundant waterbodies 

and large forest patches is crucial for sustaining more functionally and phylogenetically 

diverse anuran communities in these anthropogenic landscapes. Furthermore, earthen 

irrigation channels and shallow depressions that support perennial ponds and aquatic 

vegetation are other important features for promoting the use of rice fields by anurans.   

 

7.5. Future research  
 Given the current economic pressure to converting the Cerrado into a massive 

agricultural area, the scientific community must make a definite effort to try to preserve what 

is still left from the world’s largest and most diverse savanna. This effort should involve 

developing more conservation plans, improving the protected areas network and respective

management. However, this is highly dependent on acquiring more knowledge on the 

biodiversity of this biome and on the threats that human activities pose. The northernmost 

portion of the biome has been especially disregarded by scientific projects and is now being 

targeted for agricultural development. 

 Beyond studies on natural history, conserving and managing the actual anthropogenic 

Cerrado will require more studies on the effects that human activities have on the biome’s 

biodiversity. This thesis underscores the importance of adopting more integrative approaches, 

considering species ecology and landscape metrics to better guide conservation and 

management policies.
