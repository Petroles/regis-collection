SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF AN

ALFISOL UNDER DIFFERENT HILLSLOPE CURVATURES(1)

Livia Arantes Camargo(2), José Marques Júnior(3) &amp;amp; Gener Tadeu Pereira(4)

SUMMARY

The influence of relief forms has been studied by several authors and explains
the variability in the soil attributes of a landscape.  Soil physical attributes depend
on relief forms, and their assessment is important in mechanized agricultural
systems, such as of sugarcane.  This study aimed to characterize the spatial
variability in the physical soil attributes and their relationship to the hillslope
curvatures in an Alfisol developed from sandstone and growing sugarcane.  Grids
of 100 x 100 m were delimited in a convex and a concave area.  The grids had a
regular spacing of 10 x 10 m, and the crossing points of this spacing determined a
total of 121 georeferenced sampling points.  Samples were collected to determine
the physical attributes related to soil aggregates, porosity, bulk density, resistance
to penetration and moisture within the 0–0.2 and 0.2–0.4 m depth.  Statistical
analyses, geostatistics and Student’s t-tests were performed with the means of the
areas.  All attributes, except aggregates &gt; 2 mm in the 0–0.2 m depth and
macroporosity at both depths, showed significant differences between the hillslope
curvatures.  The convex area showed the highest values of the mean weighted
diameter, mean geometric diameter, aggregates &gt; 2 mm, 1–2 mm aggregates, total
porosity and moisture and lower values of bulk density and resistance to
penetration in both depth compared to the concave area.  The number of soil
attributes with greater spatial variability was higher in the concave area.

Index terms: soil-landscape relationship, geostatistics, semivariogram.

RESUMO:       VARIABILIDADE ESPACIAL DE ATRIBUTOS FÍSICOS DE UM
ARGISSOLO SOB DIFERENTES CURVATURAS DO RELEVO

A influência das formas do relevo tem sido estudada por diversos autores e explica a
variabilidade dos atributos do solo na paisagem.  Os atributos físicos do solo são dependentes
das formas do relevo, e a avaliação desses atributos é importante em sistemas mecanizados
como o da cultura de cana-de-açúcar.  O presente estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar a
variabilidade espacial dos atributos físicos de Argissolos desenvolvidos de arenito e cultivados
com cana-de-açúcar bem como a relação desses com as curvaturas do relevo.  Uma malha de
dimensão de 100 x 100 m foi delimitada em uma área caracterizada pela forma convexa e
outra em uma área caracterizada pela forma côncava.  As malhas tinham espaçamento
regular de 10 x 10 m, e os pontos de cruzamento desse espaçamento determinaram os pontos
de coleta das amostras, num total de 121 pontos amostrais georreferenciados.  Amostras
foram coletadas para determinação dos atributos físicos: agregados, porosidade, densidade do
solo, resistência à penetração e umidade nas profundidades 0,00–0,20 e 0,20–0,40 m.  Foram
realizadas análises estatísticas e geoestatísticas.  Todos os atributos, com exceção dos agregados
&gt; 2 mm na profundidade de 0,00–0,20 m e dos macroporos nas duas profundidades,
apresentaram diferença significativa entre as curvaturas.  A área convexa apresentou os maiores
valores de diâmetro médio ponderado, diâmetro médio geométrico, agregados &gt; 2 mm,
agregados de 2–1 mm, volume total de poros e umidade e os menores valores de densidade do
solo e resistência à penetração nas duas profundidades estudadas, em relação à área côncava.
A área côncava apresentou maior número de atributos do solo com maior variabilidade
espacial.

Termos de indexação: relação solo-paisagem, agregados, densidade do solo, porosidade,
geoestatística, semivariograma.

INTRODUCTION

Several studies have reported the influence of the
landscape on the variability of soil physical attributes
and its relationship with plant growth (Pennock et
al., 2001; Rezaei &amp;amp; Gilkes, 2005; Terra et al., 2006).
The relief is an independent and major soil formation
factor (Jenny, 1941) that determines the soil
distribution in the landscape (Bockheim et al., 2005).
Therefore, its participation in soil formation can be
studied apart.  Landscape attributes such as
curvatures and slopes, among others, influence the
hydrological conditions, resulting in different
moisture and water flow patterns.  In studies by Seibert
et al. (2007), the influence of topography on the
formation of different soil types mediated by
hydrological processes was characterized, and this
influence can possibly be understood and predicted
through the use of soil physical attributes (Mello et
al., 2007).

The adoption of highly mechanized cultivation and
harvesting techniques in sugarcane plantations has
provoked alterations in the behavior of soil physical
attributes and in the sugarcane yields (Souza et al.,
2004a,b).  The main effect of mechanization is soil
compaction, and further studies to evaluate this
process are necessary to optimize crop production.  The
evaluation of soil physical attributes is important to
diagnose the degree of compaction and guide the
physical soil management.

In studies to diagnose the soil physical state of a
landscape, some authors have found that the spatial
variability in soil physical attributes is related to the
landscape forms (Souza et al., 2004a; Brito et al., 2006;
Camargo et al., 2008).  The potential of soil
degradation by a management varies according to the
location of the landscape and the spatial distribution
of landscape attributes (Cambardella et al., 2004;
Pennock, 2003).  Soares et al. (2005) affirmed that, to
understand the temporal variation in the soil physical
attributes, it is necessary to consider vertical and
lateral variations (along the toposequence).  Juhász
et al. (2006) concluded that the physical-hydric
behavior of the studied soil is influenced by landscape
conditions.

Campos et al. (2006) emphasized the importance
of landscape models to understand the soil-
geomorphology relationships.  The same authors
reported on the model established by Troeh (1965),
which is based on relief profiles and hillslope
curvatures in which the pedoforms vary from linear
over convex to concave.  Nizeyimana &amp;amp; Bicki (1992),
Pennock et al. (2001), De Alba et al. (2004), Montanari
et al. (2005), Van Oost et al. (2005), and Brito et al.
(2006) studied the relationships between the spatial
variability in soil attributes and terrain curvature.

The dependence and spatial variability of soil
attributes can be characterized by geostatistical
analyses.  These analyses involve mainly the
semivariogram, which is the estimation and modeling

of the spatial variance structure, and kriging, which
is the prediction of regionalized variable values of
unsampled points or regions (Vieira, 2000).

The spatial variability of aggregate stability and
organic matter in an Oxisol was explained by Souza
et al. (2004a) by small variations in the slope gradient
and in relief forms.  The spatial dependence of stable
aggregates was observed in an Oxisol studied by
Camargo et al. (2008) and was spatially correlated to
the clay fraction mineralogy.  Zanette et al. (2007)
evaluated the spatial moisture variability of a
Hapludox and found values for this attribute ranging
from 5.20 to 10.67 m.  The authors reported that no
spatial dependence was observed in the studied
attribute in deeper depths.

Geoestatistical analyses also make the
determination possible of intensity and form of
attribute sampling because the semivariogram range
values indicate the ideal sampling distance (Vieira et
al., 1992).  In this case, attributes with larger range
values require a smaller sample quantity than
attributes with lower range values.  However, in the
absence of spatial dependence, classical statistics are
applied (Silva et al., 1989).

The objective of this study was to characterize the
spatial variability of physical attributes of a
sugarcane-cultivated Alfisol developed from sandstone
and the relationship between these attributes and
hillslope curvatures.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The study area is located in Catanduva, state of
São Paulo (latitude 21o05’57.11"S and longitude

49 o 01 ’ 02.08 ” W).  The regional climate, according
to Köppen’s classification, is tropical hot humid, type
Aw, with dry winters.  The average precipitation is
1,350 mm, and the average annual temperature
23 oC.  The temperature in the hottest month is &gt;
22 oC and in the coldest month &amp;lt;18 oC.  The principal
vegetation types in the Catanduva region are seasonal
rainforest and cerrado (savanna-like), and the current
predominant land use in the region for over 20 years
was sugarcane cultivation, in a harvest system that
includes burning.

The soils, classified as a Typic Hapludalf (Soil
Survey Staff, 1999) with medium texture, are derived
from weathering sedimentary sandy rocks from the
Bauru Group, Adamantina Formation (IPT, 1981).
The studied area was characterized with aerial
pictures of the elevation profile of the region at a scale
of 1:35,000, and the fields were classified by
geomorphological and pedological classifications.

To identify the relief forms according to Troeh
(1965), a 200 ha area was mapped using the Global
Positioning System (GPS) equipment.  Coordinates
and altimetry were used to construct a digital elevation
model (DEM) using the Surfer program (1999)
(Figure 1).  The field and DEM observations allowed
the identification of two areas of interest, one a convex
and the other a concave hillslope area.  In the DEM
area (Figure 1), arrows indicate the intensity and
surface water flow, illustrating the slope modeling
and, consequently, the water flow distribution pattern.
In the concave area, the water flow is heterogeneous
and has a disorganized distribution pattern, whereas
in the convex area, this distribution pattern is
homogeneous and organized.  The granulometric and
chemical characterizations of the hillslope curvatures
are presented in Table 1.

Two grids (100 x 100 m) were installed at locations
representing each of the areas.  The grids had a
regular spacing of 10 x 10 m, and the intersections of
this spacing determined the sampling points,
amounting to a total of 121 georeferenced sampling
points.  Trenches (0.3 x 0.3 m, 0.5 m deep) were
opened for the collection of undisturbed soil samples
in volumetric rings and disturbed soil samples.  The
samples were collected at depths of 0–0.2 and 0.2–
0.4 m.

The collected samples were crumbled and left to
dry in the shade.  One part of the soil was sieved in a
9.51 mm diameter grid sieve for aggregate analysis,
and the other part was sieved in a 2.0 mm sieve.
Aggregate size and stability were determined using
the method described by Kemper &amp;amp; Chepil (1965).  The
aggregates retained in the 4.76 mm sieve were
subjected to slow pre-moistening by atomizing with
distilled water and afterwards shaken for 15 min in a
set of sieves with 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.105 mm
mesh in a water-filled container.  The material
retained in each sieve was heated to 105 oC in an oven.
Based on the obtained results, the mean geometric
diameter (MGD) and the mean weighted diameter
(MWD) were calculated.

In order to determine soil porosity (total porosity,
macropores and micropores), the undisturbed samples
were saturated for 48 h in a tray with water filling
two-thirds the height of the soil ring.  After the
saturation period, the samples were drained at a
pressure of -0.006 MPa using a tension table
(Embrapa, 1997).  In the same samples, bulk density
was determined with the volumetric ring method
according to Embrapa (1997), as well as moisture.
The soil resistance to penetration was field-determined
at each grid point using an model IAA/Planalsucar
impact penetrometer, and the values were calculated
according to Stolf (1991).

The laboratory analysis results were subjected to
descriptive statistical analyses.  For the evaluation of

the difference between mean values of the attributes
between the areas, the Student’s t-test was applied.
All results were obtained using the MINITAB 14
statistical package (Minitab, 2000).

For the spatial dependence analysis geostatistical
techniques were used (Vieira et al., 2000).  The
semivariograms were estimated under the hypothesis
of intrinsic stationarity, and a mathematical model
was adjusted for those that showed spatial
dependence.  The semivariogram is a graph that
characterizes the spatial dependence structure of a
variable (or of variables) under study.  The
semivariogram can be defined as a function that
connects the semivariance with the distance vector,
and can be analytically and/or graphically represented.
It is estimated by the following equation:

 

where N (h) is the number of experimental data pairs
separated by vector h, and Z represents the measured
values for soil or crop attributes.  The semivariogram
is normally represented by the graph of ? (h) versus
h.  The program GS+ was used for spatial dependence
evaluation (Gamma Design Software, 1998).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The value distribution of most of the studied
attributes was symmetric, with skewness and kurtosis
values of approximately zero; the mean and median
values were very close to each other (Tables 2 and 3).
Exceptions were aggregates between 1–2 mm (at both
depths), MWD, aggregates &gt; 2 mm from the convex
area and attributes of aggregates in the concave area
at both depths other than aggregates between 1–2 mm
in the 0–0.2 m depth.

Data normality is not a requirement for the
application of geostatistical techniques; however, it is
recommended that the distribution tails should not
be overly long.  The coefficient-of-variation values (CV)
(Tables 2 and 3) of attributes varied between low
(&amp;lt;12 %), average (12–24 %) and high (&gt; 24 %),
according to the classification proposed by Warrick &amp;amp;
Nielsen (1980).  The high values of this estimate reveal
the need for an evaluation that allows a better
understanding of the data variation.  The CV estimate
is a helpful technique in the evaluation of attribute
variability used to determine the minimum sampling
number (Cline 1944; Montanari et al., 2005).
However, it does not permit the evaluation of the
spatial dependence of attributes that are verified,
among others, by geostatistical techniques.

It was observed that the mean attributes values that
determine aggregate stability, i.e., the mean weighted
diameter (MWD) and mean geometric diameter (MGD),
were highest in the 0–0.2 m depth (Tables 2 and 3).

The TPV and macropore values were greater in
the surface depth.  In this study the macropore values,
in both areas and depths, were between 13.29 and
14.31 % higher than the 10 % considered the
minimum for plant growth (Drewry &amp;amp; Paton, 2005;
Drewry et al., 2006; Reynolds et al., 2008).

The Bd values were close to the values found by
Araújo et al. (2004) in a recently cleared and burned
area.  In Ultisol with 45 % clay, Falleiro et al. (2003)
found mean Bd values between 1.14 to 1.37 g cm-3
and reported that the lowest values observed for to
conventional tillage were a consequence of soil turning,
aimed mainly at an increase in porosity.

In the convex area, where the relative Bd values
were lowest, the resistance-to-penetration values (RP)
were also lowest and moisture highest (in both depths).
These results agree with those reported by
Lampurlanés &amp;amp; Cantero-Martinez (2003).  Lima et
al. (2006) stated that, according to the significant
correlation found between moisture, resistance to
penetration and pre-consolidation pressure, the Ultisol
load capacity can be estimated by its resistance to
penetration, confirming the importance of this
attribute in the evaluation of the physical soil qualities.
The mean RP values, in the 0–0.2 m depth in both areas,
were above the critical value for root growth (3 MPa),
according to Lipiec &amp;amp; Håkansson (2000).

The mean values of the studied attributes were
compared to the values reported in the literature, and
it was observed that they were not different from
values found in Brazilian Alfisol and Ultisol.
However, a range of maximum and minimum values

were observed (Tables 2 and 3) which, for some
attributes, were not within the interval cited by
national and international authors.  This fact,
together with the high attribute variation (CV),
suggests the need for a spatial variability analysis.

It is emphasized that the evaluation of soil
attributes revealed aspects such as mobility of water
and air in the soil, which affects root growth and
makes soil susceptible to compaction.  The existence
of a range of values for these attributes indicates that
the average values do not represent the spatial activity
in the area.  This aspect is important for the planning
of local soil management and indicates that an analysis
of the spatial variability of attributes is required.

The Student’s t-test results (Table 4) revealed a
significant difference (5 %) in the attributes means
between the convex and concave areas at the two
studied depths, with the exception of the percentage
of aggregates &gt; 2 mm in the 0–0.2 m depth and
macropores at both studied depths.

It was observed that, in the convex area, there
were greater values for the MWD, MGD and
percentages of aggregates &gt; 2 mm and between 1–
2 mm, TPV and moisture and lowest Bd and RP values
in both depths.  Therefore, it can be stated that the
physical quality of the soils in the convex area was

better (Reynolds et al., 2002) than of soils in the
concave area, which reflects the clear influence of relief
forms on the attributes since the applied management
in the two areas was the same.  Cambardella et al.
(2004) verified the effect of landscape on soil quality
by finding positive relationships between the best
quality indices, also obtained with physical attributes,
and the higher positions in the landscape.  In the study
of Soares et al. (2005), the relief influenced the changes
in density and macropores of an Oxisol under
sugarcane, confirming the results of Souza (2004).

These results can be explained by the higher clay,
organic matter and total iron contents in convex than
in concave area soils (Table 1).  These attributes are
fundamental for soil aggregation (Arca &amp;amp; Weed, 1966;
Tisdall &amp;amp; Oades, 1982; Azevedo &amp;amp; Bonumá, 2004).
The difference between them is related to a reduced
thickness of the A+E horizon of the soils in the convex
area (0.30 m) than in the concave area (0.39 m)
(Table 1).  Therefore, in the convex area, there is a
greater influence of the more clayey horizon which is
characteristic of Alfisols.  Thus, the influence of relief
on soil thickness and on the fundamental soil
aggregation attributes due to water flow characteristic
for each curvature indicates the role of the relief as
integration of factors that determine the soil physical
attributes.

To evaluate spatial dependence, semivariograms
(Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5) were constructed.  The following
models were adjusted to the attribute data: (a)
exponential for MWD, aggregates &gt; 2 mm,
macropores, RP and moisture in the convex area in
the 0–0.2 m depth, Bd in the convex area in the 0.2–
0.4 m depth and RP in the concave area at both depths;
(b) spherical for aggregates &gt; 1 mm, micropores, TPV,
Bd in the convex area in the 0–0.2 m depth, MWD,
aggregates &gt; 2 mm, micropores, TPV, RP and
moisture of convex area in the 0.2–0.4 m depth,
micropores, TPV and Bd of the concave area in the
0.2–0.4 m depth.

Of all the attributes for which exponential and
spherical models were adjusted to semivariograms,
the degree of spatial dependence was only high [Co/
(Co+C1) &amp;lt;25 %] for macropores in the convex area in
the 0–0.2 m depth and moderate for the other
attributes [Co/ (Co+C1) between 25 % and 75 %]
according to the classification of Cambardella et al.
(1994).

The preliminary semivariograms for macropore
attributes in the 0–0.2 m depth, macropores,
micropores, TPV and moisture in the 0.2–0.4 m depth
in the concave area showed an increased variance

without stabilization.  This demands the removal of
the trend or a non-stationarity that can be performed
by adjusting the data to a surface trend (Davis, 1973).
In this study, the use of a linear surface was chosen
for the removal of the attribute trends that showed
these phenomena according to the methodology
described by Vieira et al. (1992) and Vieira (2000).
The semivariograms resulting from the removal of
the trend revealed an absence of spatial dependence
of these attributes, presenting a pure nugget effect instead
(Figures 4 and 5).

The called pure nugget effect (PNE) of data was
also observed in the following attributes: MGD,
aggregates between 1–2 mm in the 0–0.2 m depth,
MGD, aggregates between 1–2 mm, aggregates
&gt; 1 mm, macropores in the 0.2–0.2 m attributes for
the convex area and MWD, MGD, aggregates &gt; 2 mm,
aggregates between 1–2 mm and aggregates &gt; 1 mm
in the 0–0.2 m depth, MWD, MGD, aggregates
&gt; 2 mm, aggregates between 1–2 mm, aggregates
&amp;lt;1 mm and Bd in the 0.2–0.4 m depth for the concave
area.  A random spatial distribution was identified
for these attributes, and in this case, classical
statistical analyses are recommended (Silva et al.,
1989), and the mean estimate values are
representative of the area.

Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 show that the spatial
dependence of attributes in the convex is stronger than
in the concave area, where the number of attributes
with pure nugget effects is higher.

The range values of the attributes of the convex
were greater than those of the concave area, except
for microspore attributes, with a lower range in the
convex than in the concave area.  Souza et al. (2004a)

found that for Oxisol, the range of aggregates &gt;2mm
and aggregates between 1–2 mm were greater than
observed in this study.  This reflects the greater
heterogeneity of Alfisols, which typically occupy less
stable positions in the landscape (Miller &amp;amp; Mehlich,
1960).

In this sense, the discontinuity of the physical
attribute distributions and consequently the spatial
variability of these attributes is greater in the concave
area.  This result matches the heterogenous water
flow characteristic of this area.

When comparing the results of the studied depths,
it was observed that a greater number of attributes
with PNE occurred in the 0.2–0.4 m depth in both
areas.  Higher range values were observed in the
surface depth, except for aggregates &gt; 2 mm and
micropores in the convex area and RP in the concave
area.  Grego &amp;amp; Vieira (2005) and Berner et al. (2007)
also observed a prevailing spatial dependence of
physical attributes in the upper soil depths, and these
results were attributed to soil tillage, which in the
conventional system favors a greater similarity among
points that are close than among those that are far
away from each other.

These results support decision-making in the
planning of soil sampling.  In addition, they send a
warning about the variability of physical attributes
within the same soil class and with the same
management history.  Therefore, the use hillslope
curvatures can be useful in outlining similar
management areas in the field and in determining
the sampling scheme, acknowledging the need to
determine the number of samples and spacing between
them, which is a constant concern in soil science
(Webster &amp;amp; Oliver, 1990).

CONCLUSIONS

1. The hillslope curvatures in this study scale
influenced the spatial variability of the soil physical
attributes.

2. The concave area presented a greater number
of soil attributes with a greater spatial variability.

3. The convex area is relatively better as the
physical quality of soil  for crop development.
