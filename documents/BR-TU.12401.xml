Resumo 

 

A degeneração do disco intervertebral é considerada a maior causa de dor lombar, que por sua 

vez tem um impacto socioeconómico mundial na ordem dos 70 mil milhões de euros por ano. A 

Engenharia de Tecidos é uma área de investigação que está a crescer exponencialmente e que 

tem o potencial de desenvolver novos tratamentos, livres de rejeição imunológica, uma vez que 

são utilizadas células do próprio paciente. No entanto, é possível aumentar esse potencial de 

compatibilidade com o paciente combinando Engenharia Reversa com Prototipagem Rápida. 

Com isto visa-se o desenvolvimento de uma estrutura biodegradável e compatível tanto 

imunologicamente com estruturalmente, que vai sendo progressivamente substituída por novo 

tecido até se alcançar uma regeneração definitiva do disco intervertebral. 

A prova-de-conceito preliminar desta estratégia terapêutica é reportada neste estudo através da 

utilização tanto de células, como a própria estrutura e morfologia, do disco intervertebral de 

coelho. A estrutura do anel fibroso foi replicada por Engenharia Reversa e Prototipagem Rápida 

em policaprolactona, enquanto que para servir como substituto do núcleo pulposo foram 

encapsuladas células num hidrogel de goma gelana metacrilada. A citotoxicidade, 

comportamento mecânico, morfologia superficial e porosidade da réplica do anel fibroso foram 

analisadas. Verificou-se que a porosidade é similar ao disco nativo e que o nível de 

biocompatibilidade está acima de 80%. As imagens de miscroscopia mostraram que as várias 

camadas da estrutura apresentam uma boa ligação após a solidificação do polímero. A adesão, 

proliferação e viabilidade celular na goma gelana metacrilada foram analisadas até 21 dias de 

cultura. Observou-se uma maior actividade metabólica nas células do núcleo pulposo do que na 

linha celular de fibroblastos, ambas encapsuladas em goma gelana metacrilada. Como trabalho 

futuro, pretende-se utilizar esta estratégia para tratar casos de degeneração do disco de uma 

forma efetiva em que o resultado final, após absorção da estrutura, é um disco intervertebral 

nativo biomecanicamente funcional.

Abstract 

 

Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration disease (IDD) is considered the main cause for 

low back pain (LBP), which has a world socioeconomic burden of 70 billion euros a year. 

Tissue Engineering (TE) is an exponentially growing area due to its potential of finding patient-

specific treatments in terms of immunological compatibility by using the patient’s own cells. 

Though, it is possible to increase TE patient-specificity by combining other technologies such as 

Reverse Engineering (RE) and Rapid Prototyping (RP). In this sense, it is possible to prepare a 

biodegradable scaffold that is both immunological and structurally compatible. This strategy has 

the potential to significantly increase implant integration and decrease immunological rejection, 

allowing the scaffold to be progressively replaced with newly synthesised tissue to ultimately 

regenerate the IVD into a fully functional anatomical motion segment. 

Herein is reported a preliminary proof-of-concept for that strategy using rabbit IVD’s 

cells as well as morphology and structure. In this sense, the annulus fibrosus (AF) structure was 

replicated by RE and RP into a polycaprolactone scaffold, and the cells were encapsulated in 

methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) hydrogel as a nucleus pulposus (NP) substitute. The AF 

scaffold’s cytotoxicity, mechanical behaviour, porosity and superficial morphology were also 

analysed. It was observed a significant level of biocompatibility from the AF replica and a 

similar porosity in relation with the native IVD. Cell adhesion, proliferation and viability were 

assessed until 21 days of culture in GG-MA. The metabolic activity was higher in the NP cells 

than in the fibroblast cell line, both cultured in GG-MA. In the future, this novel strategy is 

envisaged to treat IDD, and remove LBP, by fully regenerating the intervertebral disc.

Acknowledgments 

 

I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to the 3B’s Research Group and 

Prof. Doutor Rui L. Reis, who not only gave me the possibility of working in this stimulating 

group with state-of-the-art equipment, but also for allowing me to work under his supervision. It 

is truly a golden opportunity to have as supervisor the President of the Tissue Engineering and 

Regenerative Medicine International Society, which was recently appointed Commander of the 

Ordem Militar de Sant’Iago de Espada by the President of the Portuguese Republic, and won the 

Clemson’s prize among many other distinctions with no less credit. However, if there is a 

person that really gave me direct supervision during this project was Doutor J. Miguel Oliveira. 

He is my role model on how I want to be as a researcher, with collaborations, projects and 

prizes exponentially increasing, which will definitely make him one of the best Tissue 

Engineering researchers in the world. I never saw such a dedication and tireless working 

efficiency. I am extremely grateful to Doutora Joana Silva-Correia, who although having had a 

baby while I was doing my thesis managed to teach me encapsulation and culturing techniques 

needed for me to accomplish this work as well as proofreading my work with great detailed 

attention. I look at her on how to express my data in a transparent and flawless manner, with 

extreme ethics. I thank Doutor Vitor Correlo for helping me work with the Istron Mechanical 

Testing System and the Twin-screw Extruder. I would like to thank Profª. Doutora Cecília Leão 

for being so nice to help me find a thesis in Universidade do Minho, and in granting me the 

possibility to make my first contact with this thesis. 

I would like to acknowledge Profª. Doutora Cecília Calado for all the support during my 

studies in Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade Católica. And also together with Prof. 

Doutor Manuel Barata Marques for having prepared and created this really interesting and 

dynamic graduation, which now I am able to see how important were all those courses that at 

the beginning I could not understand their relevance. If I went back to the end of the highschool, 

I would chose this exact graduation in this Faculty again. On an entirely different subject, I 

appreciate all the patience and time spent while I was continually bothering both with academic 

association problems in my duty as vice-president of the academic association. To Prof. Pedro 

Simões I acknowledge my first contact with Tissue Engineering and Immunology. These were 

the only two courses that Prof. Pedro taught me, however I found his classes so interesting that 

when I was searching for a thesis my main choices were only between these two courses/fields. 

I thank all people working in 3B’s Research Group that helped me in my work, and 

most of all for the after/off work time that we spent. I met a lot of foreign people in 3B’s that 



x 
 

shared their life stories and views, which come from completely different backgrounds and from 

all parts of the world.  

I would like to acknowledge in a special way Daniela Pacheco for sharing with me her 

love for science research. I thank her for helping me to maintain focus in finishing the thesis at 

times that seemed this thesis would never end, which were several. When I started at 3B’s I was 

supposed to study the state-of-the-art regarding the subject of this thesis, however, sometimes I 

did not want to sit on my desk reading papers, but instead to start working in the lab, she kindly 

showed me around and helped me gain practical experience in the lab. She proofread my work 

in situations that I was exhausted and could not read another sentence. Daniela made possible to 

come work afterhours, on weekends and holydays when I needed and she could just go enjoy 

her day off instead, always with the attitude “if there is work to be done, (let’s) do it!”. To her I 

express my full gratitude. 

I thank my colleagues Daniel Nunes, Elisete Duarte, Patrícia Bacelar, Patrícia Silva, and 

Pedro Júdice for the teamwork and sense of community. As the only MSc students in our year, 

we were only six, but we had a far greater determination not only to achieve good grades but 

most of all for learning. There were times that we surrounded the Professor, which was giving 

the class, with questions and more questions and we only let go when we got the answer and 

made sure that everyone of us understood. Therefore, I am grateful for this small community 

feeling that made me learn the courses I had with full long-lasting understanding of the given 

subjects, which in the end truly helped me in the thesis. 

I would like to thank Materialise NV© for allowing me to use a trial version of their 

software, without which it would have been impossible to make this work. 

Last but definitely not least, I would like to thank my mother and my sister Catarina for 

all the tasty homemade food that always felt like I was eating at home. However, if this thesis 

was possible to happen in every sense, from getting to start it until enabling to finish it, was my 

father. He was the one that gave me the chance to go to Vienna, to the World TERMIS, in 2012 

to find Prof. Rui Reis to ask him for this thesis. He gave me the best toy an Engineer can have, a 

3D printer, which was the most important equipment I needed for this thesis, without it I could 

not have prepared the scaffolds. I thank my father for contributing indirectly in my decision to 

study/follow the “Bio” world that alongside with my innate attraction towards Engineering 

made me chose to study Biomedical Engineering. However, the last push to study Biomedical 

Engineering was given by Profª. Doutora Isabel Spencer-Martins that in 2005 opened my eyes 

for the potentialities of this field for the future, and that I would regret not being part of it. If I 

never studied Biomedical Engineering this thesis would not have been made, for that reason I 

am truly thankful.

I. General Introduction: Advanced Regenerative Strategies for 

Treatment of the Intervertebral Disc degeneration 

 

 

1. Impact of Low Back Pain and the Promise of Advanced Therapies 

 

Low back pain (LBP) is a major issue in our society these days, mainly in terms of 

socioeconomic impact and quality of life. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration disease 

(IDD) is believed to be the main cause for LBP
1,2

. Tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative 

medicine (RM; TERM) are an application of multidisciplinary tools by researchers, 

engineers, and physicians to construct biological substitutes that can mimic tissues for 

diagnostic and research, with the final purpose to regenerate diseased and injured tissues
3
.  

TERM is a field where a therapeutic strategy for IDD can be found, the doubt is not if 

it will work, but instead, how and when it will work. Indeed, many therapeutic strategies for 

IDD have been proposed within these two fields
4–6

, and although all of these have the same 

purpose, they use different ways to get there. Some research groups use cultured cells 

directly implanted in the native tissue, whether it is with nucleus pulposus (NP) cells 

(NPCs)
7
, annulus fibrosus (AF) cells (AFCs) and/or with stem cells

8–11
.  

The aim of the cell therapy strategies is to increase IVD’s cell number levels and, 

therefore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Another treatment option relies on 

biomolecules’ injection
12

, which is intended to reduce the anabolic processes and increase the 

catabolic processes to restore ECM levels. However, there are also other approaches that can 

be taken for severe cases of IDD, regarding biomechanical dysfunction or lack of proper 

ECM content in the IVD, using third generation biomaterials that can mimic the native 

tissue’s physical and biochemical conditions
13

. These three strategies are the main ways 

within TERM fields to stop and revert IVD’s degeneration process. They can be chosen 

according with the IVD’s stage of degeneration and type of malfunction, but probably, as 

many research groups have been suggesting, the most adequate approach, at least for 

moderate and severe cases of IDD, where IVD’s biomechanics is about to or is already 

compromised, would be a combination of two or all of these main regenerative strategies 

(e.g., a combination of scaffold with cells and bioactive molecules)
14,15

. 

Bearing in mind that the world is in a difficult economic crisis and that getting enough 

funding for science research, as in other areas, is harder; a question must be asked - Is 



2 
 

researching an IVD’s regeneration strategy economically worthwhile? To answer that 

question, it must be taken into account the size of the disease in terms of prevalence in 

society and its socioeconomic impact, which is statistically masked as LBP. So the 

dependence between LBP and IVD degeneration should be analysed. In fact, the IVD 

degeneration is thought to be the primary cause of LBP, causing compression of the spinal 

nerves and adjacent vertebrae
1,2

. By the age of 50, 97% of the population show signs of IVD 

degeneration
16

, which is a time bomb for LBP. The incidence of LBP increases with age, 

creating a relationship between age related IVD degeneration and the frequency of LBP
17

. 

Having in account the increasing lifetime average in first world countries, incidence of LBP 

is increasing with it. Considering the fact that modern lifestyle tends to fulfil some LBP’s 

risk factors, such as a large number of hours in a seated position, high levels of psychological 

distress, low levels of physical activity, obesity or job dissatisfaction, and the relation 

between IDD and LBP shows the problem is far from solved. Other risk factors for LBP are 

poor knowledge about self-state of health, previous back pain, pain below the knee, 

depression, fear avoidance behaviours, exposure to intense vibrations and smoking. 

The most favourable way to analyse the economic importance/relevance of exploiting 

a regenerative strategy for IDD, is to check how much money is spent directly or indirectly 

(money not won on labour or which is spent in consequences due to LBP, e.g., impairment 

and/or unemployment benefits) every year on treatments for LBP, and consider the 

percentage of LBP that is related to disc degeneration cases. Most LBP cases resolve rapidly 

(approximately 80-90% until the twelfth week with LBP symptom, acute LBP cases), but the 

remaining cases are the ones (from the twelfth week of LBP symptom forward is considered 

chronic LBP), which incur most of the treatment challenges and healthcare costs. In the 

United States, LBP is: the first cause of impairment in people younger than 45 years, the 

second cause to visit the physician, the third cause for surgical procedures and the fifth cause 

of admission in the hospital
18

. In the United Kingdom, LBP accounts for 13% of the 

certificated sickness leave, with estimated indirect costs to the country of 9 billion euros per 

year (in today’s euro currency, X-Rates), and an annual direct cost to the National Health 

Service of 900 M€ (in today’s euro currency, X-Rates)
19

. Resulting in 70 billion euros (in 

today’s euro currency, X-Rates) in annual costs to alleviate and treat this pain
1
 and it is 

rising. 

This subject takes us to another question – Are there any good treatments for LBP? 

The current treatments for LBP are therapies addressed for LBP, and not for its cause, which 

means, that these treatments are focused on treating only the symptoms, and do not solve the 

actual problem, e.g., IDD. The current treatments addressed to LBP, which largely include 

IDD’s cases too, can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies
16

.

The pharmacological treatment options include anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, 

antidepressants
20

, analgesics and opioids, and injection therapy (drug’s injection). 

Unfortunately, most of these treatment approaches have the danger of promoting addiction. 

On the other hand, the current treatments for chronic LBP are exercise, multidisciplinary 

therapy as in physical and psychological training, massage (classical/Swedish muscle 

massage)
8
, acupuncture

21
, behavioural therapy, back school, spinal manipulation

22
, 

electromyographic biofeedback, lumbar supports, traction and transcutaneous electrical nerve 

stimulation. These are all treatments applied nowadays for patients with IDD, which are 

diagnosed with LBP, and contribute for $90 billion annual costs applied directly in LBP 

patients’, money that could be spent in good and efficient treatments, which do not exist still. 

None of these treatments have shown already to be effective, sometimes it works, but it 

seems to depend on the cause of LBP, e.g., if a patient suffers from stress a muscle relaxant 

can be enough to solve the condition. 

Herein, it is intended to address the basic anatomy and biomechanics of the spine and 

IVD, as well as the degeneration process of the IVD. It also overviews the state of the art 

regarding the repair strategies, gene therapy and TERM strategies developed to repair and 

regenerate the degenerated IVD. Other advanced strategies that have been exploited in new 

TE approaches are also discussed, which employs the use of reverse engineering (RE) and 

rapid prototyping (RP) technologies in order to prepare a patient-specific TE-total disc 

replacement (TE-TDR) implant for middle to severe cases of IDD, e.g., cases in which the 

AF is already compromised.

2. Spine: Anatomy and Function 

 

The spine is composed of 33 vertebrae (9 are fused together in the sacrum and coccyx 

regions), most of them interspersed with IVDs, these being the biomechanical pivot of upper 

body motion. This allows the spine to be in the upper right position, bend and be submitted 

to torsion at the same time as it protects the spinal cord from trauma
23,24

. The spine provides 

strength and flexibility allowing the body to move in multiple spatial planes. The vertebrae 

composing the spine are numbered according to their spinal area location: 7 cervical (C1 to 

C7), 12 thoracic (T1 to T12), 5 lumbar (L1 to L5), 5 sacral (S1 to S5) and 4 coccygeal (fused 

vertebrae)
25

.  

Cervical area’s main function is to support the head weight, which accounts for 8% of 

total bodyweight
26

. Thoracic area’s range of motion is very limited and its main function is to 

protect the chest’s internal organs by supporting the thoracic cage. The lumbar area is 

responsible for bearing the upper body’s weight; for that reason, it has the biggest vertebrae 

in the entire spine. Vertebrae from both sacral and coccygeal areas are, each one, fused 

together. 

The spine has a total of 24 IVDs, with approximately 4 cm in diameter and 7 to 10 mm 

thick (in the lumbar area), which account for one third of its height, and are the main 

responsible for its flexibility. It also allows a variety of movements, namely in three different 

planes: lateral bending, axial rotation and flexion-extension. When these motions are 

accompanied with heavy lifting, forces up to 17 kN can be created in the lumbar area
27

. In 

fact, this tissue is under high pressure when the body is in a vertical position, especially the 

lumbar area’s discs, and even more when the body is in a seated position
28

. This indicates 

that the modern lifestyle, regarding its tendency for higher number of hours in which a 

person is seated, can be one more risk factor for chronic LBP and IVD degeneration. 

The IVD is a complex structure composed of three different, although interdependent, 

types of tissue: (1) NP, (2) AF and (3) the cartilaginous endplates (CEP) (Figure 2.1)
1
 located 

on both top and down IVD extremities which vertically delimit the AF and the NP. The NP 

is the gelatinous core of the IVD, and is contained by the strong and elastic AF. 

 



6 
 

 

Figure 2.1. Micro-computed tomography three-dimensional reconstruction of a rabbit IVD, 
presenting the different components, namely: NP in the middle, AF around the NP and both top and 

down CEPs (Micro- computed tomography parameters: pixel size – 13.18µm, source 89kV / 112µA). 

 

The NP’s hydrogel-like consistency is due to its proteoglycan (PG) and water content, 

held loosely by a random network of collagen type II and elastin fibres. This structure has a 

high water content due to its high PG predominance in
28–31

 which is about 80% and 65% (in 

dry weight), respectively at childhood, and drastically decreases with age
3233

. PGs are highly 

hydrophilic molecules, allowing them to adsorb large quantities of water, making NP’s ECM 

to swell, giving the NP the classic hydrogel-like morphology. This morphology has 

viscoelastic properties, which is ideal for the NP function, and also ideal for the IVD’s and 

spine’s biomechanics. 

The AF structure is responsible for contain the NP, and avoid its extrusion followed by 

collapse, as NP is under high pressure and its consistency does not allow weight bearing on 

its own. The AF surrounds the NP with 10 to 25, extremely organized and highly fibrotic, 

annular elastic strips called lamellas
28,31

. Although collagen type II is also present in the AF 

as it is in the NP, the proportion is much smaller, on the other hand the presence of collagen 

type I is highly predominant
30

. The collagen ratio of type I/type II increases from the NP’s 

centre until the AF’s outer periphery. Actually, the AF varies so much radially that some 

research groups, including ours
27

 and Cassinelli et al., say the IVD is composed by four 

structures: CEP, NP, inner AF and outer AF
17

.  

The outer AF is the peripheral layer of the IVD (in the transverse plane), and it is 

highly dense and organized
17,27

. The collagen fibres make a 60º angle with vertical axes, in 

the same lamella they are parallel to each other, but alternated from adjacent fibres. All 

together, the lamellas make a diamond mesh-like force field to contain the NP. This 

configuration allows the outer AF to contain large forces coming from the compression of 

the NP by the spine that are not contained by the inner AF
30,31,34

. 



7 
 

The inner AF is a less organized structure than the outer AF. It is somehow a 

combination between the outer AF and the NP both biochemically and biologically, although 

more similar with the outer AF. On a healthy IVD the inner AF has a clear and smooth 

appearance. 

CEP divides both NP and AF from the adjacent vertebrae by covering the cortical 

bone’s surface. Vertebrae are connected to the CEPs through calcium structures, in addition 

the collagen fibres present in AF cross the border, tying the IVD to the vertebral bodies at its 

rim
29

. The CEP tissue is cartilaginous, and resembles articular cartilage in many properties. 

Studies have demonstrated that this tissue is the weakest of the three tissues in terms of 

mechanical properties
30

. 

The IVD’s mechanism works by using the best properties of each of its three main 

types of tissue: CEP, stiffness; NP, uniaxial into hydrostatic pressure converter; AF, elastic 

resilience. This characteristics work on a force transfer cascade which begins with the spine 

being mechanically requested, resulting in its compression
35–38

. The uniaxial compression 

driven by this force is transferred through the CEPs to the NP, which reacts hydrostatically 

due to its fluid properties. As a result the AF ends up being pushed from within 

homogeneously, which reacts by containing it (Figure 2.2). 

 

 

Figure 2.2. IVD’s biomechanics general scheme, when the spine is mechanically requested. (Micro-

computed tomography of rabbit IVD. Acquisition parameters: pixel size – 13.18µm, source 89kV / 

112µA). 

 

The assembled combination of both AF’s and NP’s mechanical properties make the 

IVD as it was composed of only one viscoelastic material ruled by two limit situations of 



8 
 

material mechanics: elastic solid and viscous liquid. As so, it is possible to consider, that the 

IVD has both elastic solid and viscous liquid properties.

3. Intervertebral Disc Degeneration (IDD) 

 

The IVD suffers a great range of changes along the life of an individual - from the 

molecular phenotype expression, to cell type, to tissues’ (CEPs, AF and NP) morphology. 

Alongside with these changes, called aging process of the IVD, can be an underlying 

progressing process of IDD. This disease can be triggered by an acute overloading (e.g., 

lifting a heavy object). With aging, the needed threshold loading, to initiate the disease, 

progressively decreases. The degeneration of the disc converts the mild changes of aging 

IVD into serious conditions, e.g., water loss, ECM production activity and phenotype, among 

several other changes at the biomolecular level. Ultimately, these changes lead to severe 

morphological changes, expressed in the form of pathologies. 

The IVD biomechanical functioning relies on a balance between the three tissues that 

compose it.  The same way the pressure goes along the CEPs to the NP, further to the AF, as 

aforementioned; the water flow follows the same pattern. In young discs, the only existent 

vascularisation is located inside the CEPs, which provide hydration for the whole disc
39

. The 

water is absorbed due to the osmotic pressure created by the biochemical components that 

compose most of the NP. Therefore, during loading cycles where compression forces affect 

the disc, the NP is strongly squeezed and the water molecules “detach” from the PGs, 

flowing away through the AF tissue.  

As previously mentioned, the PGs are extremely hydrophilic molecules that are 

responsible for the 80% water composition of the NP in young IVDs
32

. A combination of 

spine overloading with aging leads to NP’s ECM remodeling unbalance, loss of hydration, 

IVD height decrease, abnormal force distribution, and, ultimately, leads to the appearance of 

IDD morphological signs
40

. 

 

 

3.1. Pathophysiology  

 

Thompson et al. proposed a grading scale for the anatomical changes that happen 

along the IDD development
41

. With the evolution of the IDD, there are a number of 

pathophysiologic events that can develop with it, such as: annular tears, disc prolapse, end 

plate damage and Schmorl’s nodes, internal disc disruption, discogenic pain, disc narrowing, 

radial bulging, and vertebral osteophytes
42

, which are addressed below. 



10 
 

3.1.1. Annular Tears 

The annular tears (Figure 3.1) are protrusions of NP tissue into the AF. As the NP’s 

material characteristics change and the AF tissue’s elastic properties weakens, with the help 

of an acute overloading recurrence on the spine, the NP is extruded through the AF and 

therefore creating an annular tear. There are three types of annular tears: circumferential 

tears, peripheral tears, and radial fissures. Circumferential tears may evolve from acute 

overloading in older IVDs; the peripheral rim tears can be associated with trauma or with 

bony outgrowths, and are more frequent in the AF’s anterior side; radial fissures are related 

with IDD and may appear on both posterior or posterolateral sides
43

.  

 

 

Figure 3.1. Annular tear in hernia stage. 

 

Annular tears can be classified as contained or herniated, the last being when the NP is 

extruding out of the AF. From contained to herniated NP there are five levels of severity for 

the annular tears progression, which is the gold standard for the computed tomography (CT) 

classification of annular tears (Figure 3.2). Grade 0 refers to a normal health IVD; grade 1 is 

when the NP extrudes until the inner one-third of the AF; in grade 2 the NP leakage 

progressed until two-thirds of the AF; when the NP finally completes the three-thirds of 

extrusion through the AF, but no more than that, is on the grade 3 of annular tear 

classification; after the NP extruding beyond the AF outer border line the annular tear is on 

the fourth grade; the last stage of the annular tear progression grading scale (grade 5) is when 

the extrusion of the NP reaches the epidural space, that is when it may press the spinal nerve 

or one nerve ending, creating LBP
44

. 

 



11 
 

 

Figure 3.2. Classification of annular tears first purposed by Sach et al. in 1990, which has been 

modified by Bogduk et al. in 1992 and further modified by Schellhas et al. in 1996.  

 

3.1.2. Disc Prolapse 

When the NP is totally extruded throughout the AF there is a disc prolapse. In fact, the 

AF does not have any significant compressive properties, it is an elastic tissue and it acts like 

a rubber band when compressed, i.e., when it is submitted to traction it responds increasing 

the reaction force the more it is stretched, however when compressed the middle part runs 

away towards one of the sides. Therefore, when there is no NP to convert the received force 

into a hydrostatic pressure, the uniaxial compressive force is not contained and comes down 

on the AF, which bends easily and it prolapses the disc. The difference between a disc 

herniation and a stage 5 annular tear is the quantity of NP content outside of place, if it is 

total then a disc prolapse (Figure 3.3) is about to or already did happen
45

. 

 

 

Figure 3.3. Scheme of a prolapsed disc, emphasized in red. 

 

3.1.3. End Plate Damage and Schmorl’s Nodes 

Another typical IVD’s pathology is CEP damage and the appearance of Schmorl’s 

nodes. The CEPs are the weakest tissue of the three composing the IVD, in terms of 

mechanical properties
30

. In aged IVDs, when the CEPs already undergone a severe trabecular 



12 
 

microdamage, the tissue can suffer protrusion from the NP. The NP invades the vertebral 

bodies (Figure 3.4) and it ceases to be under pressure, since the force presses the AF instead, 

which cannot bear it and bends
42

. 

 

 

Figure 3.4. NP protrusions (Schmorl’s nodes) into the CEPs due to trabecular microdamage driven by 

NP biochemical imbalance. 

 

3.1.4. Internal Disc Disruption 

Finally, the loss of water inside the NP makes its volume decrease in almost 1:1 

proportional ratio, since as much as 80% of the NP is water. The decrease of NP’s volume 

has a threshold, when this level is crossed the AF tissue seizes to be pushed by the NP. Since 

the NP’s height is smaller than the AF, the CEPs start to compress the AF instead of the NP. 

The AF is not a hard tissue, thus it cannot hold compression in a functional way and internal 

disc disruption occurs, dividing the AF into two layers that bend to different sides, in and 

out
46

. Due to AF organisational morphology, which is divided in radial lamellas, tends to 

break apart between 2 of the 15 to 25 lamella stripes that compose the whole AF. This event 

creates a gap inside the AF, which significantly decreases the tissues mechanical 

performance, thus contributing to the progression of degeneration
47

. 

 

 

3.2. Biological and Molecular Changes  

 

Biological and molecular changes underlie the morphological signs of IDD. Regarding 

biological changes, the cells present in degenerating IVDs suffer changes in several domains. 

Zhao et al.
48

 made an extensive review on the cellular changes that happen during IDD. The 



13 
 

authors claim that there are cell changes in: type, density, death, proliferation, senescence, 

and phenotype. All these changes have an impact on molecular synthesis, which leads to an 

unbalanced ECM remodeling, and ultimately to loss of hydration that should be about 80%
30

. 

The IVD is composed of different types of cells in its different parts. The CEP as in 

resemblance to the hyaline cartilage is composed by chondrocytes; the outer AF is populated 

by elongated fibroblastic-like cells; the inner AF as more rounded chondrocyte-like cells. 

The cell population in CEP and AF does not change much with aging, however, it does vary 

greatly in the NP
48

. The CEP and the whole AF as most of the spinal structures are derived 

from the mesoderm germ layer, but not the NP
49

. This tissue on the other hand, has its origin 

on the endoderm germ layer that is also the notochordal cell’s origin. These cells are largely 

present in young discs, but disappear by the end of the first decade of life. The notochordal 

cells (NCs) are gradually replaced by chondrocyte-like cells which are believed to migrate 

from the inner AF and/or from the CEPs
29

. 

There is some controversy around cell density changes. Zhao et al.
48

 believe the cell 

density has its turnovers in parallel with the change of cell type in the NP. As NCs start to 

disappear, the cell density drops creating a positive feedback for chondrocyte-like cells 

migration and proliferation into the NP tissue, coming from the already mentioned tissues. 

These chondrocyte-like cells increase density along IDD. Bae et al. do not agree though, they 

claim that the degenerated disc’s cell density is lower than that found in healthy discs
50

. But 

both hypotheses have strong arguments, as degeneration process progresses the CEPs start to 

calcify and IVD’s vascular access starts to become scarce affecting the cells’ nutritional 

route and cellular waste removal, causing increased cell death (Figure 3.5). However, with 

IDD progression, ingrowth of blood vessels accompanied by nerve growth occurs into the 

AF and even into the NP (in advanced IDD)
51

. These changes increase nutritional 

accessibility and waste removal rate, which can increase as well the cell density in the NP. 

But with nutritional availability also oxygen concentration increases inside the IVD, even 

more than in healthy IVDs. NPCs phenotype and activity is stimulated by hypoxia, 

ultimately the excessive availability to oxygen leads to normoxia, which tends to make NPCs 

senescent
52,53

. 

 



14 
 

 

 Figure 3.5. Scheme of the cascade of events associated with the morphological signs of IDD. 

 

The cellular change, potentially most responsible for the morphological 

transformations observed due to IDD, is the NPC phenotype. Cell expression has direct 

influence in the anabolic-catabolic ECM pathway balance, as IDD progresses the catabolism 

increases in relation to anabolism, i.e., the matrix is more degraded than it is produced. In a 

normal IVD, the AF is largely composed of collagen type I whereas the NP is composed of 

collagen type II and aggrecan, which is a type of PG. But other molecules are present in the 

NP, such as: collagen type I, III, V, VI, IX and XI, biglycans, decorin and fibromodulin 

(other types of PGs), and fibronectin
30

. In healthy IVDs there is also production of catabolic 



15 
 

molecules with increased expression while IDD progresses. These molecules are matrix 

metalloprotainases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, which break down the ECM. There are 

several types of MMPs expressed in the NP: type 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 13. In addition to that, 

there is also an increased cytokine production, such as: interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-1? and tumour 

necrosis factor-?. These molecules also promote the MMPs synthesis, having a devastating 

effect on the ECM
34

. Zhao et al. summarized a table of the biochemical changes caused by 

the IDD, which complements this brief description of ECM remodeling mediation
48

. 

The biomolecular changes throughout the IVD decrease the concentration of 

hydrophilic molecules in the NP. This has a strong effect on the IVD’s permeability that 

when affected can change the IVD’s biomechanics. NP´s hydraulic permeability greatly 

depends on the magnitude of the compression force made on the disc. Heneghan et al.
54

 

defined a mathematical formula explaining this phenomenon, which is given by equation 1. 

?(?) = 2.05 × 10?15(? ? 0.2)1.13? ?0.01(?
2?1)       (Equation 1) 

 

Where, k, is the named permeability and, ?, is the stretch ratio, i.e., the ratio between 

the compressed sample’s height and the original height, on the apparatus used by this 

research group. In which, an IVD is submitted to a compression strain and the flow inlet and 

outlet are measured. This experiment besides giving a relation between permeability and 

compression, also shows that this relation does not follow a linear tendency but, instead 

follows an exponential tendency (? = h / h0, as h0 is the uncompressed height of the IVD and 

is always higher than h, which is the compressed height of the NP; therefore, ? is always 

between 0 and 1). Until a certain level of NP compression magnitude (? ? 0.2), the tissue is 

not permeable, i.e., when k = 0 or is an imaginary value. But this formula can only be applied 

when the NP is healthy, since when the degeneration starts the PG number decreases inside 

the NP and its permeability increases with it, i.e., the water retention decreases and the whole 

IVD decreases its mechanical performance. This process is a cycle, with loss of 

biomechanical properties the typical loading starts to become an overloading, which also is a 

factor to progress the degeneration state that will in the end reduce even more the mechanical 

capacity, and the cycle goes on in a recessive spiral.

4. Treatment Strategies for Intervertebral Disc Repair/Regeneration 

 

As previously stated, current treatments for LBP can cause addiction and only treat the 

symptoms. These treatments only work in specific situations, like in acute IVD traumas or in 

the beginning of the IDD’s appearance. They mainly work by taking pressure out of the IVD 

(e.g., muscle relaxants soften muscle strain over the IVD) thereby allowing the natural 

regeneration mechanism to solve the issue by itself. However, most of these treatments 

merely neutralize or reduce the patient’s pain, while the IDD is still progressing
40

. 

In more severe cases of IDD, the natural regeneration system cannot cope anymore, 

either by itself or with strain releasing help (such as current treatments for LBP, e.g., 

massage). In that case, only three strategies have the potential to remove pain completely, 

which are repair
55

, gene therapy
56

 and TERM strategies
57

. The first intends to solve IDD with 

artificial implants, whereas the second and third aim at the total regeneration of a patient’s 

IVD, removing all previous signs of degeneration. 

Even though gene therapy is still far away from clinical application, it promises great 

results in the future, not only in IVD regeneration, but also in several different kinds of 

diseases e.g., cystic fibrosis
58

. The question of which one of these strategies is the best, 

cannot be answered yet, mainly due to the fact that there is still no clinically-approved IVD 

regeneration strategy available, despite promising potential in the currently researched 

treatment options
59

. Now, patients can only choose repair strategies as an alternative to 

current treatments in order to treat IDD. 

In this section, it will be discussed the several repair approaches. Starting with the 

discectomy procedure, with its objective to remove the LBP generated by extruded NP 

material that compresses the peripheral spinal nerve or the spinal cord. This section gives a 

resume of some repair device strategies that not only remove LBP, but prevent it from 

coming back due to re-herniation after discectomy. Furthermore, the spinal fusion procedure 

is briefly explained, and how it treats IDD by removing the source of pain, preventing any 

possibility of it coming back. Well, at least in that intervertebral space, since herein it is also 

discussed how this procedure can stimulate adjacent IVDs to degenerate due to 

biomechanical imbalance through the spine after spinal fusion.  

Moreover, TERM strategies to treat IDD in the NP are described and what pathways 

some research groups are taking to achieve that goal. This can be made whether by finding 

potential ways of differentiating stem cells into NPCs or by culturing isolated NPCs with 

growth factors (GFs) or serum-free chemically defined medium to make them metabolically 



18 
 

active. Then, which materials have been giving more interesting results to carry NPCs in the 

degenerated NP. Furthermore, it will be discussed which strategies are being followed 

nowadays to regenerate the AF, since without a good support, whether native or scaffold, for 

the NP, this will herniate on the first loading cycle. But to find the right material to mimic 

the complex mechanical properties of the AF is not an easy task, since it is a very efficiently 

organized tissue. And the synthesis of this ECM organization must, as well, be stimulated 

and timed with the scaffold rate of degradation. 

 

 

4.1. Repair Strategy  

 

4.1.1. Discectomy/Arthrodesis 

Surgical methods for degenerative lumbar conditions include discectomy, arthrodesis 

or a combination of both. Discectomy is the surgical removal of NP fragments following 

herniation that compresses the spinal nerve. This compression distribution on the affected 

nerve causes pain, sensory changes, or weakness
60,61

. Discectomy is successful in relieving 

the radicular pain caused by the herniated disc. However, this procedure alone is unable to 

restore the nucleus to its original load sharing capacity, which controversially affects long-

term benefits and re-herniation rates. Moreover, discectomy may accelerate the progression 

of disc degeneration by damaging the AF, which in turn will lead to a decrease in NP 

pressure, decreasing the disc height, impairing the disc’s ability to rehydrate, and increasing 

the AF stresses and strains
61

. Besides the anatomical problems, the removal of the 

degenerated or damaged disc tissue typically provokes negative biomechanical changes
1,60

. 

Furthermore, it is unknown whether the effect of discectomy depends on the degenerative 

state of the disc
61

. 

Due to the disadvantages and limited success of discectomy procedures in general, 

arthrodesis was developed as an alternative method within clinical treatments. Arthrodesis, 

also known as spinal fusion, has been practiced since the beginning of the 20
th
 century. 

Spinal fusion involves the use of bone tissue, traditionally derived from autografts, allografts, 

as well as the application of demineralized bone matrix, ceramics, and more recently bone 

morphogenetic proteins to bridge two or more vertebrae
62

. This procedure aims at stabilizing 

the moving segment, and slowing the progression of disc degeneration and relative 

pathological motion between vertebrae. Arthrodesis is based on the hypothesis that the 

mechanical and environmental changes will relieve the pain
63,64

. Even though spinal fusion is 



19 
 

a common procedure, its efficacy in treating discogenic LBP has been resulted in conflicting 

results
65

. Long-term consequences such as adjacent segment disease have increased concerns 

for the use of spinal fusion
1
. Furthermore, several changes have been observed such as 

dehydration, disc space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and progressive deformity at levels 

adjacent to a fused spinal segment
66

.  

 

 

4.1.2. Replacement 

In an effort to improve results of fusion and to decrease the incidence of adjacent IVD 

degeneration, TDR techniques have been introduced and studied extensively. 

Artificial disc replacement (nucleus and annulus) technology was first considered in 

the early 1950’s to produce an implant that could mimic, to some extent, the function of the 

normal IVD (maintain the mobility of the intervertebral motion segment and restoring 

natural disc function)
62,67

. Moreover, implants for disc replacement should be biocompatible, 

durable, and easily implantable
68

. There are generally two types of disc arthroplasty devices, 

which are nucleus replacement or TDR devices, with the latter being more frequently used
1
.  

Nucleus substitutes are aimed at restoring disc height and returning annular fibres to 

their natural length. Adding to the appeal is the minimally invasive nature of this treatment 

method
69

. However, despite minimal invasion, a passage through the annulus for the 

prosthesis has to be created. Nevertheless, this approach allows the rehabilitation of the 

normal load distribution among the nucleus, the annulus and the facet joints, as well as 

promoting the healing of the annulus and thwart degeneration by themselves.  

In general, the substitute should provide resistance to pressure with position change 

recreating the disc “bellows” effect
60

. A wide range of materials has been tried in order to 

replace the nucleus of the IVD, including: polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol 

(PVA)/polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) copolymer, polycarbonate urethane, albumin, silicon, 

and stainless steel
62

. The most well-known device is the prosthetic disc nucleus, which is 

comprised of two sections: the first is made up of a non-degradable hydrogel pellet 

(polyacrylamide) and the second, which surrounds the hydrogel, is a polymer mesh or jacket 

composed of polyethylene
70

. However, in advanced stages of degeneration, these devices 

cannot be applied and TDR becomes again the most favourable approach.  

TDR aims at restoring the physiological kinematics of the IVD, such as resisting wear 

and relieving pain, while avoiding instability and protecting the adjacent discs and facet 



20 
 

joints from undue degeneration
62

. Three artificial disc options have been proposed for TDR: 

metallic, non-metallic, or a combination of both materials
27

. SB-Charité
®
, a metal-

polyethylene-metal construct was the first total disc arthroplasty, which is still in use today 

following only minor changes to the original design. Pro-disc
®
 is another prosthesis that has 

been widely used
71

. 

Each artificial disc is composed of two or three components, which include two 

endplates and an articulating mechanism with either a metal-on-metal or metal-on-polymer 

surface. In order to keep the disc in place and provide stability within the host vertebral 

body, devices feature different designs - teeth-like compounds fixed into the vertebral bone; 

a porous coated surface onto the endplates, which promotes the growth of fibrous tissue 

around the device; or implant securing with screws into the recipient vertebral body
27,72

. 

Even though theoretically appealing, there are several challenges with current TDR strategies 

and also there is insufficient data to assess the performance of IVD arthroplasty adequately. 

Despite being in use for at least the last 20 years, there are some concerns regarding the 

safety and efficacy of these methods
73

. Consequently, patients may require revision surgery, 

which may be very dangerous due to the adjacent great vessels and the nerve plexus. Another 

solution, posterior fusion, requires the removal of the disc prosthesis followed by spinal 

fusion to immobilize the affected tissue, which again is very risky and dangerous
1,73

. 

Regarding the obvious downfalls of spinal fusion, the development of dynamic, or 

semi rigid-, constructs for lumbar spine instrumentation has emerged as an alternative option. 

This method is based on a load-sharing device, allowing for fusion without excessive 

rigidity, which, if disregarded, may lead to adjacent segment complications
74

. Some dynamic 

constructs have also been used without fusion
75

. Several authors have reported that posterior 

dynamic instrumentation, compared to rigid instrumentation, increases the amount of load 

transmitted through the anterior column and the interbody bone graft, which will avoid 

stress-shielding phenomena. Consequently, this may favour osteogenesis and enhance 

interbody fusion in accordance with Wolff’s Law, which states that bone will adapt to the 

load it is placed under through piezoelectric phenomena
74

. 

Systems for spinal fusion can be described as pedicle screw–based constructs that are 

semi-rigid, or allow constrained motion in compression or flexion and extension. Pedicle 

screw-based systems are classically divided into semi-rigid rod systems and tension band-

based posterior systems used in non-fusion technology
74

. The rigidity of these constructs 

depends on the material and design of the rods, which are connecting the pedicle screws. 

Although, solid stainless steel and titanium are commonly used in spinal fusion constructs
76

, 

the semi-rigid constructs often include polyetheretherketone (PEEK) rods
77

, nitinol rods
78

, 



21 
 

especially cut rods (e.g., Accuflex), articulated rods, and polyethylene terephthalate cords 

(Dynesys)
75,79

. 

Unlike the aforementioned prostheses that are fixed to the vertebrae by the use of 

pedicle screws, there are “floating devices”, which are interspinous implants. These implants 

have the advantage of reducing the risk of implant loosening during motion
80

.  

During the last decade, spinal cage implantation has gained a lot of attention. This 

approach enhances spinal fusion and stability in cervical spine surgery, ensuring, at the same 

time, an adequate increase in the height and helping to correct cervical kyphosis, i.e., a 

curvature in the cervical area of the spine
81

. PEEK cages have recently been used in cervical 

surgery, since they provide both strength and stiffness in the intervertebral space. A major 

advantage of these implants is their radio transparency and magnetic resonance imaging 

(MRI) compatibility, which are traditionally used in the visualization of the spinal cord and 

the root. Since the polymer is radiolucent, visualization in the aforementioned methods can 

be performed without the generation of implant artefacts in the resulting images
81

.  

Finally, intradiscal electrothermal therapy is a percutaneous technique reported by Saal 

et al., and it is another option for the treatment of discogenic LBP
82

. A navigable 

electrothermal catheter is inserted inside the posterior annulus, which delivers heat. The 

proposed mechanism of action of this technique is collagen modulation, cauterization of 

granulation tissue, deactivation of inflammatory agents and possibly annular denervation. 

The heat induces the retraction of the annular collagen (collagen fibrils shrink at 

temperatures greater than 60ºC), therefore coagulating inflammatory tissue and nerve 

endings in the periphery of the disc’s posterior side
82

. This heating method has been shown 

to produce temperatures sufficient to cause nerve fibre death as well as collagen 

denaturation
83

. Moreover, there are no biomechanical modifications and destabilizations after 

applying this procedure. 

 

 

4.2. Gene Therapy  

 

A potential therapeutic strategy next to the classic LBP management treatments and 

repair strategies is the gene therapy. This possibility was first thought as a way of treating 

chronic diseases, targeting the problem on its core by modifying, adding or disabling a gene 

or a cocktail of genes. Several problems occurred, when it was first tested; unfortunately the 



22 
 

idea gained a bad reputation and gone into a research standby for a decade
84

. Recently, the 

number of groups researching gene therapy started rising again, being nowadays a possibility 

of stopping and reverting degeneration of the IVD. 

The first question when applying this strategy for IVD regeneration is – what should 

change on a molecular level, to stop and revert IVD’s degeneration? As it has been explained 

above, the malfunction in the NP’s ECM production and maintenance is one of the main 

reasons for the IVD to fail biomechanically. So, the strategy must be focused on balancing 

the catabolic-anabolic equilibrium into the ECM production side. For that, two things can be 

done, alone or together, increase the ECM anabolism and decrease the catabolic pathway. 

This can be done by transfecting the right genes into the NPC population, genes that codify 

potential therapeutic GFs and cytokines such as: transforming GF (TGF)-?1, TGF-?3, insulin 

like GF-1, osteogenic protein-1, IL-1, bone morphogenic protein-2, latent membrane protein-

1, SOX9, among others
85

. Transfecting a combination of these genes would increase ECM 

production, but the reverse strategy can also show equally positive results, by silencing 

targeted catabolic proteins using RNA interference, such as proteolytic enzymes (e.g., MMPs 

and disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs). This RNA suppresses 

the overall production of the targeted gene by using a small interfering RNA, which binds 

specifically to the gene’s mRNA sequence, leading to a suppressed translation or increased 

mRNA’s degradation
86,87

. 

After choosing the proper cocktail of genes to be delivered, another question may be 

posed - how does the gene reach its final destination? With few exceptions naked DNA alone 

is not a feasible way to deliver it to target the cells’ nucleus; a vector is needed that can be 

viral or non-viral. Non-viral vectors are systems, which do not have viral origin, such as 

liposomes
88

, DNA-ligand complexes
89

, gene gun
90

 and microbubble enhanced ultrasound
91

. 

However, the non-viral vectors give the host a transient gene expression that is not suitable 

for the treatment of chronic diseases. A longer lasting strategy must be applied, for that, viral 

vectors are the most favourable since they use viral’s natural way of infecting the host and 

integrating DNA into the target cells’ genome, e.g., metabolism senescent cells like the ones 

present inside the IVD in order to enhance their activity. Viral vectors, on the other hand, 

bring the risk of alarming the immune system that is a huge issue in high-vascularised 

tissues, which is not the case as the IVD is the most avascular tissue in the body. Viral 

vectors utilized for gene therapy applications include adenovirus
92

, adeno-associated virus
93

, 

herpes simplex virus
94

, lentivirus and retrovirus
95

. 

In addition to the selection of the appropriate gene and vector, another important 

consideration with gene therapy applications is the delivery strategy. There are two main 



23 
 

strategies for gene delivery as proposed by Nishida et al
96

, in vivo and ex vivo (Figure 4.1). 

The first strategy takes fewer steps than the second, it involves the direct transfer of the 

vector-gene complex into the target tissue within the living host. The ex vivo strategy 

involves a more complex approach. First the cells are isolated from the host; after the culture 

is transfected with the desired DNA material; the cells, which were successfully genetically 

modified, are then implanted into the desired tissue. This strategy seems to be much safer, 

since while cells remain in vitro they can be assessed before implantation in order to control 

what goes inside the patient’s organism; so those cells that had a bad reaction to the 

transfection can be removed, and only the desired cells are implanted
97

. Also, the in vitro 

culture required in ex vivo strategies may change cells characteristics in a way that they 

cannot survive in the harsh environment observed in a degenerated NP (low oxygen, low pH, 

poor nutrition)
98

. Mimicking the IVD’s conditions is needed in order to reproduce in vitro, as 

much as possible, the IVD’s cell environment, and probably the only possible strategy is to 

proceed with the culture in a bioreactor. On the other hand, the in vivo strategy has its 

disadvantages as well, using this approach the viral vectors are injected with an unknown 

concentration in comparison with the cells present in the target tissue. This relation between 

the number of viral particles and target cells is called multiplicity of infection, which in high 

values is extremely cytotoxic
52

. 

 

 

Figure 4.1. Gene delivery strategy available, A. in vivo – which implants the vector-gene complex 

within the living host – and B. ex vivo – which involves isolation of the host target cells (1
st
 and 2

nd
 

steps), transfection (3
rd

 step) and implantation (4
th

 step). 



24 
 

 

The literature is controversial about which delivery strategy is the most proper 

strategy, further research is needed to unveil this topic, however, it seems relatively easy to 

conclude that the in vivo strategy, although more dangerous, seems more efficient. 

The IDD can be a severely debilitating disease, but it can never be fatal. For that 

reason only, a treatment, such as gene therapy can be seen as an extremist strategy, since, 

although the disease will not kill, the cure can, as well as stimulate IDD to an even more 

debilitating condition (e.g., paralysis)
99

. In fact, gene therapy can achieve great result without 

being too invasive, but only if everything goes according to plan, otherwise (e.g., high 

multiplicity of infection, injection made in a vascular vessel or in a nerve ending) there is a 

real risk of killing the patient. Anyway, there are no better treatments, only appropriate 

treatments, and with more research, gene therapy can have a place as an IDD therapy. 

 

 

4.3. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Strategies Applied to 

the Regeneration of Intervertebral Disc  

 

Since Langer and Vacanti first defined TE as “an interdisciplinary field of research 

that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences towards the development of 

biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function”
100

 the research field 

went into an exponential growth. Its close companion field, RM, is going good as well since 

it was recently declared by The Economist as “the best market in the world right now”
101

. 

TERM are definitely two potential areas to find treatment strategies that can cure diseases 

that until now did not have an effective cure
3
. While RM targets diseases in which the main 

problem is in the cellular population, the TE addresses diseases in an advanced state of 

degeneration in which, or for any other reason (e.g., tissue surgically removed for treating 

cancer), the tissue’s mechanical stability has been compromised.  

In the case of the IDD disease, TE (Figure 4.2) aims to restore disc height and 

biomechanical stability by repairing the tissue at first
102

. Through time the scaffold degrades 

and becomes bioactive, sprouting back the body’s natural regeneration process that without a 

physical support provided by the biomaterial would not be possible. This grants a favourable 

environment for cells to produce not just ECM, but the right type of matrix. Cells need to be 

in contact with each other in order to produce the right ECM for it to be the aimed tissue. On 



25 
 

the other hand, for that tissue to be grown the cells must be at the density that its cell type is 

used to, not only that, but also the rate of nutrient supply and cellular waste removal should 

be similar to the native tissue. The situation is similar regarding oxygen supply and carbon 

dioxide removal
103

. These parameters are very important, especially for the IVD, since this is 

the most avascular tissue in the human body. The same presence of nerve endings in the IVD 

is also extremely limited, which explains the lack of symptoms until a severe state of IDD
104

. 

Therefore, NPCs are not used to be close to a blood vessel that provides higher concentration 

nutrients and oxygen. All of this influences the cell’s type and what they express, as 

explained before, having a direct impact in the functional stability of the tissue.  

 

 

Figure 4.2. Scheme of a Tissue Engineering strategy applied to the intervertebral disc. 

 

 

4.3.1. Nucleus Pulposus 

The genesis of IDD is related to the loss of ECM in the NP’s (Figure 2.2). The main 

reason for the appearing of this disease, besides it may arise due to an acute overloading of 



26 
 

the spine or ageing, is in the loss of water within the NP matrix. Since 80% of its content is 

water, a decrease in its content lead to a decrease in NP height and consequently it loses its 

biomechanical functionality
32

. When regenerating the NP this high water content must be 

maintained, therefore the hydrogels seem like the ideal candidate to mimic the native tissue 

due to their ability to retain water, some up to 98%
105

. 

Cell-based strategies aimed to regenerate the IVD concern strictly on renewing the 

synthesis of NP’s ECM by cell injection in order to increase cell number, but more 

importantly to boost the active cell population. This because the reason why the ECM is lost 

is due to the native NPCs’ change in behaviour, they seize to produce PGs at an even rate as 

the ECM remodelling proteins destroy it
50

. The NPCs living inside IVDs that are in an 

advanced state of degeneration are senescent and need to be replaced with strong and 

vigorous ECM cell producers. 

 

 

4.3.1.1. Matrices: Biomaterials/Scaffolds 

Regarding regeneration treatment strategies for IDD, when the subject is cell-based 

strategies it is implied that only the NP tissue is being regenerated. This because in IDD 

process the AF degenerates after the NP, in fact the AF degenerates mainly because of NP 

malfunction, due to its degenerated state
106

. So when choosing the right biomaterial to carry 

cells to the NP, several properties must be taken in account, as described in Table 4.1. 

 



27 
 

Table 4.1. Hydrogel requirements as NPCs carrier. 

 Problem Solution References

AF should be left intact as much as 

possible during surgical procedure 

Injectable material, so that only the area 

of the needle’s section is hurt on the 

AF’s 

107
 

2 

In order to achieve the first 

requirement, the material must be 

able to polymerise only when inside 

the NP. * 

This polymerization can respond either 

to pH, ion interaction, temperature, or 

even light. 

108,109
 

 

3 

If the material is going to carry the 

cells to the NP it should improve the 

NP’s properties, such as disc height 

and biomechanical function, in order 

for the cells to remain viable. 

The material’s mechanical properties 

should be as close as possible with the 

mechanical properties of the NP 

tissue. 

110
 

4 

Provide an environment that 

stimulates NPC’s phenotype. 

The material must be able to absorb a 

lot of water, at least 80%, which is the 

amount of water inside the NP.  

32
 

5 
The material besides biocompatible 

should be biodegradable. 

The degradability rate must match the 

tissue’s rate of regeneration. 

111
 

*If the polymerised material is able to be injected or if the material does not polymerise in vivo it is very 

likely that the material will come right off through the needle hole, with cells included, on the first IVD 

loading. 

 

With all those properties in mind, the type of material that stands out is the hydrogel 

(Figure 4.3). Hydrogels are polymeric networks with the capacity of absorbing water from 10 up 

to 100 times its dry weight.

28 
 

Several kinds of hydrogels have been studied for cartilage regeneration, as well as 

specifically prepared for IVD TE strategies. Hydrogels belong to the group of polymeric 

materials, thus they can be divided into two types regarding their origin – natural and 

synthetic
112

. 

There is a growing interest in natural origin hydrogels, and the economic aspect is the 

main reason for it. As most of the naturally occurring hydrogels are extracted and not 

synthesised, this greatly reduces its manufacturing cost. In that sense, they also require 

purification processing, which sometimes involves using severely toxic solvents and reagents. 

Even so, in general, they are less expensive to produce than synthetic hydrogels. Other reasons 

for why they are getting more attractive might be their low level of cytotoxicity and their wide 

range of possible TE applications, such as: bioactive degradation, available to cellular 

remodelling, cell adherent, and biological signalling
113–115

. 

Although natural origin hydrogels offer a wide range of biological advantages, they 

generally lack the needed physical properties, as solubility and accelerated rate of degradation 

do not allow the tissue to regenerate in such low time. This does not suit cartilage regeneration, 

since they have a long regeneration time
116

. Therefore, if a natural originated hydrogel as these 

properties suited for cartilage then it’s a very promising material. Some examples are: 

alginate
117

, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), chitosan, collagen, gellan gum (GG), and 

hyaluronic acid (HA) (Table 4.2).

In contrast with natural origin hydrogels are the synthetic hydrogels. This hydrogels 

provide predictable and reproducible chemical and physical properties that can be tuned for 

different TE applications, e.g., degradation rate according to the aimed tissue regeneration rate. 

Moreover, they are easy to blend with polymers that broaden even more the properties’ 

possibilities of synthetic origin hydrogels
125

. Since they are made of well-known molecules, 

when pure, they have a low risk of immunogenicity, infection and toxicity
115,126

. Though, they 

lack bioactivity, and their manufacture is, in general, economically unattractive. Some examples 

of synthetic hydrogels for IVD TE strategies are: polyethylene glycol (PEG)

 (Table 4.2). 

 

 

4.3.1.2. Cells 

Cell therapy approach for IVD regeneration is based on injecting NP phenotype cells that 

are believed to produce PGs when in situ. Thus, the first obstacle is - what type of cells is the 

right one to be used? Well, if the native NPCs (Figure 4.4) are to be replaced they surely cannot 

be used, i.e., the NPCs from the degenerated IVD cannot be used since they are senescent or 

they are not expressing the right phenotype. 

 



31 
 

 

Figure 4.4. Micrographs of human NPCs after 3 days in culture. Scale bar: 50 µm. 

 

Fortunately, it is possible for this to be a wrong statement in the near future, since Rosalin 

Abbott and her co-workers
12

 have been working on increasing human NPCs’ metabolic activity, 

proliferation, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, and stimulate non-degenerated NPC’s 

phenotype. They believe that native NPCs from an IVD in a severe state of degeneration have, 

in fact, a hidden regenerative potential. The exposer of these type of cells to a notochordal 

conditioned media and/or GFs, namely from the TGF family, constitutes a promising strategy to 

enhance GAG production and be an effective treatment. They retrieved the cells from a human 

source and after expanding them under the aforementioned conditions they were implanted in 

IDD rabbit models (induced by needle-punctures).The results showed not only that cells stayed 

viable for up to 24 weeks but also that this strategy delayed the IDD progression.  

Jennifer Maier
130

 studied the effects of Foxa1 and Foxa2 genes n the notochordal sheet 

formation during embryogenesis, and found out that in fact they do have an indispensable role 

in NP tissue formation. It is believed, that the young NP tissue does not have the chondrocyte-

like NPCs, but only NC cells, and the chondrocyte migrate from the inner AF tissue or from the 

CEPs
131

. There is the possibility that stem cell transfection with Foxa1 and Foxa2 could guide 

the differentiation line to NC cells, but it is a very premature statement, with the potential to be 

researched, though. 

The prospect of using stem cells in cell-based strategies for IVD regeneration brings with 

it the necessary step of differentiating stem cells into fully functional NPCs. Although this is not 

an easy task, recent efforts (e.g., induced pluripotent stem cells)
132

 have been helping to reduce 

one part of the problem, the stem cell source. The amount of stem cells needed in the beginning 



32 
 

significantly depends on the method that is being followed, since the differentiation into NPCs 

can be done in vitro or in situ, for reasons explained below. 

The in vitro differentiation method has the advantage of assuring that the implanted cells 

have the correct phenotype, although with the disadvantage of more stem cells being needed. 

Stem cell expansion is not trivial, and many cells are lost while differentiating into NPCs
133

. The 

key factor, specific for IVD regeneration treatment, is hypoxia (2% O2), since this is the 

environment where NPCs live in, they can be up to 2-3mm from the closest blood vessel
52,53

. 

Therefore, the best way to ensure that stem cells differentiate into NPCs is by introducing them 

in a hypoxic environment, though a lot of cells tend to die due to the lack of oxygen therefore 

more stem cells are needed at start. Zhong Fang and his co-workers
133

 have been working on the 

hypothesis of manipulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to make them resistant to 

hypoxia by adding an anti-apoptotic gene called Bcl-2. By avoiding stem cells to suffer 

apoptosis on the early stage of differentiation they made these pre-NP phenotype cells to be 

resistant to the low concentration of oxygen and thus maintaining cell number even after the 

later stage of differentiation. This way, the initial number of stem cells needed decreased 

significantly (2.2 times less). But the doubt still remains – Does this not increase the chance of 

cancer cells formation? Decreasing the ability of cells to resort to apoptosis is a step forward for 

cells to be unable to commit apoptosis, and losing the ability to die makes them virtually cancer 

cells. Nevertheless, this work brings great promise and if proven safe there is no reason why not 

to use this method, even in other strategies for IVD regeneration (i.e., cell constructs). 

In situ differentiation method has the advantage of using a standard approach for stem 

cell expansion, the process from isolated stem cells until before the injection in the NP is done 

the same way has it was for any other kind of tissue. Steven Leckie and his co-workers
134

 

developed a work following this type of cell-based method. Its purpose was to determine 

whether injecting human umbilical tissue-derived cells into the NP would improve the course of 

IDD. The authors injected cells alone (carried by a buffer), carrier alone and carrier + cells. 

Follow up was based on MRI, biomechanics and histology findings. The results were not close 

enough to the positive control (non-punctured IVDs), and failed to fully restore MRI parameters 

for non-degenerated IVDs. However, they were successful in slowing down the degeneration 

process and showed better results than the negative control (punctured IVDs). At 12 weeks the 

MRI results showed that cells alone and cells + carrier were significantly distinct from 

punctured values. Although, regarding the viscoelastic properties, the cell-free carrier and cells 

+ carrier were significantly closer to positive control than the cells alone, though not close 

enough. If the biological and biochemical conditions within this tissue are not right the use of 

this method can stimulate the growth of blood vessels and nerve endings inside the NP, though. 

In the literature, there has been shown evidences, or at least suspicions, that the appearance of 



33 
 

blood vessels and nerve endings inside the NP might be originated by native stem cells
135

. 

Therefore the addition of stem cells could promote this as well as deteriorate the state of the 

tissue by further degenerating it, but there is still a need to further research and clarify that.

 used HA as a cell carrier for MSCs. Disc height was evaluated on 

several time-points, but with no significant results. They evaluated the cells’ viability of the 

injected cellular population by using a cell tracker staining and observed that when using cells + 

carrier, the cells remained viable for up to 28 days by 100%, but no NP phenotype or 

biomechanical behaviour of the hydrogel, after a period of culture, was tested. 

Anna Reza and Steven Nicoll
15

 made a very interesting and complete study using 

methacrylated CMC as a carrier for NPCs. Besides analysing the matrix elaboration and 

functional properties NPC-laden CMC hydrogels, they also compared two different types of 

medium - the standard serum-containing medium formulation versus a serum-free chemically 

defined medium, both of them supplemented with TGF-?3. The results show why using a 

chemically defined medium is so important, obviously compensated by its high cost. GAG and 

collagen type II content was significantly greater in serum-free constructs, as well as the 

Young’s modulus, and the equilibrium weight-swelling ratio of the same constructs approached 

that of the native NP tissue (22.19 vs. 19.94, respectively). These results indicate the importance 

of medium formulation in NP construct development demonstrated by enhanced functional 

matrix development by NPCs when cultured in CMC hydrogels maintained in serum-free, TGF-

?3 supplement medium. 

Yung-Hsin Cheng and co-workers
136

 added gelatin to a thermosensitive chitosan and ?-

glycerol-based hydrogel to improve its mechanical strength and gelation properties. Gelatin was 

chosen by its low-cost, biocompatibility, biodegradability, but especially due to its gelation 

properties. After evaluating its feasibility to carry cells for NP regeneration, it was observed 

from the rheological measurements that the gelation temperature was near 33ºC, thus liquid at 

room temperature, and that at 37ºC its gelation time was 49 seconds. Later on, 
137

 the same 

scaffold was used in combination with ferulic acid, due to its properties, namely: anti-

inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-aging, hepatoprotective, 

neuroprotective, radioprotective and pulmonary protective. The aim was to perceive if this 

bioactive agent had similar protective and/or therapeutic effects on a degenerated IVD. The 



34 
 

results demonstrated that this hydrogel composite has the potential to be used as sustained-

release system for hydrophobic compounds (such as ferulic acid). A down-regulation of 

collagen type II synthesis and substantial up-regulation collagen type I. It was observed that 

ferulic acid can be an interesting molecule to encapsulate in AF scaffolds, such as 

polycaprolactone (PCL) being this polymer hydrophobic.  

Anthony Baer
118

 and his colleagues studied the collagen expression and mechanical 

properties of NPC-laden alginate hydrogels. Interestingly the results showed a good cellular 

viability, but the mechanical behaviour of the cell-laden hydrogels after 21 days was not near 

the native NP mechanical behaviour. Putting the two different types of results together, it 

suggests that although IVD cells maintain their phenotype characteristics when cultured in 

alginate, the synthesised molecules were not able to form a mechanically functional matrix in 

vitro. 

GG hydrogels (Figure 4.5) have been proposing great results as a material for cartilage 

regeneration
138

, showing interesting features, such as its natural property of being non-

angiogenic
139

. This is a crucial feature in cell-based approach upon IVD regeneration, since by 

keeping blood vessels away the environment inside the NP can remain hypoxic as it is in 

undegenerated IVDs, therefore stimulating NP phenotype even with no GF supplement.

Silva-Correia and colleagues have been shown indicatives of GG potential for its use in 

cartilage regeneration
140

. A protocol for producing methacrylated-GG (GG-MA) was 

developed
141

. By adjusting the methacrylation reaction to 24 hours, GG-MA mechanical 

properties became the most suitable for NPC-based therapy. Moreover, a photo-polymerizable 

class of GG-MA was also developed allowing its gelification after exposure to ultra-violet (UV) 

light (approximately during 6 minutes). The viability tests showed that UV exposure did not 

significantly affected the cell number, as the cultures of photo-crosslinked GG-MA with 

encapsulated NPCs remained viable up to 21 days
142,143

. In 2012, the same team ran an 

experiment for evaluating the angiogenic potential of GG, which has shown splendid results for 

IVD regeneration treatment applications
59

. The same team demonstrated the methacrylated 

biocompatibility with both lung fibroblasts cell line (L929) cell line and human IVD cells
144

. 

Therefore, it shows the potential of GG-MA material to be used as an NP substitute. 

 

 

4.3.2. Annulus Fibrosus 

IDD has a starting point in the NP tissue, as already mentioned, but its progression is 

towards the adjacent tissues – AF (Figure 4.6) and CEPs. The CEPs are a critical tissue for the 

whole IVD’s health maintenance, they are the main source of water and nutrition, and with IDD 

progression they tend to become calcified, therefore loosing supply permeability
145

. When this 

path is blocked, angiogenesis is stimulated inside the IVD that raises oxygen levels, making the 

NP normoxic, decreasing the NPCs capacity of PG production by slowly making them 

senescent
48

. This process only happens in very severe cases of IDD, though being very 

important for the whole IVD biological balance. When looking into the general picture, the 

CEPs are the third last important tissue to focus on regenerating. But maybe it is time for 

research surrounding IVD TE to start focusing more on the CEP regeneration in order to 

provide the clinics a whole spectrum of available TE therapies for IVD regeneration, from mild 

to severe IDD. Although this subject is not addressed here, the authors strongly believe that 

there is a gap in the IVD TE research that urgently needs attention.

Figure 4.6. µCT top view of the AF, surrounding a dark area, which is the NP. (µCT of rabbit AF and 

NP. Acquisition parameters: pixel size – 13.18µm, source 89kV / 112µA). 

 

When NP loses force-converting abilities, i.e., the ability to convert uniaxial compression 

into hydrostatic pressure, the AF tissue seizes to be pushed aside. When this is combined with 

loss of NP volume due to decrease in water content or through herniated annular tears, the 

compression made by the spine structure on the IVD compresses the AF, instead of compressing 

the NP and then pushing the AF from within. When the biomechanics of the IVD are following 

this path of mechanical energy distribution the AF disrupts creating the internal disc disruption 

pathology, thus contributing to the progression of the degeneration
47

. When the AF is under this 

state of degeneration it is somehow hopeless to try regenerating the IVD by focusing only on the 

NP, since any hydrogel, with seeded cells or not, injected in the IVD, will certainly herniate 

through the AF after a stronger spine loading
107

. Therefore, in severe states of IDD it is as 

important to regenerate the AF as the NP, since any effort on regenerating the NP alone would 

be meaningless unless there is a functional AF to hold the NP tissue in place
146–148

. In order to 

do that a biphasic (NP + AF) or even a triphasic (NP + inner AF + outer AF) cell construct is 

needed to have the chance to succeed with the treatment. Moreover, future strategies could also 

address the substitution of the CEPs as well, for extreme cases of IDD. 

 

 

4.3.2.1. Matrices: Biomaterials/Scaffolds 

The AF varies greatly in morphology along its radius, and that is the reason why 

researchers claim that there are two distinct structures within the AF - the inner and the outer 

AF
17,27

. Actually, the biocomposite AF and NP is one whole structure with no evident borders. 



37 
 

The biochemistry of it simply changes gradually from the NP centre to the most peripheral layer 

of the outer AF. Since it is not easy to mimic the assembling complexity of the IVD’s ECM 

molecules in order to form the macro structure, the most promising way to produce a whole 

IVD cell construct is by defining the borders between the different types of tissue that are to be 

mimicked. 

There is one type of ECM component that prevail in each one of the three structures
32

. 

Inside the NP there is a major presence of PGs. In opposition to the NP’s biochemical and 

morphological composition is the outer AF. This anisotropic tissue
149

 is mostly made of 

collagen type I, therefore it is an extremely elastic type of tissue. It has a totally different type of 

mechanical behaviour from the NP, which is more of an isotropic viscous liquid. The inner AF, 

although having more collagen type II than the other two types of tissue, is like a mixture of 

both in terms of mechanics and biology, but having a morphological organisation closer to the 

outer AF, though
38

.  

In this sub-chapter it will be described the types of materials that are being used in 

research for the AF tissue regeneration strategy. Several materials have been developed and 

used as prime-material for preparing AF scaffolds (Figure 4.7). There are an immense amount 

of different composites and formulations, though they are based on the same materials, such as: 

polylactic acid (PLA)
150,151

, polyglycolic acid (PGA)
151,152

, silk
153,154

, collagen
155–158

 or 

demineralised and decellularised bone matrix (collagen base)
159

, PCL
160,161

, alginate, chitosan
162

 

and HA
150

.

Like any material to be used in a TE application, it must be biodegradable and 

bioresorbable as well as biocompatible while being shape-tailored. However the IVD is an 

anatomical structure highly subjected to complex movements and strains
163

. Therefore, the 



38 
 

material chosen to replace the AF, in the short-term, must have similar mechanical properties. It 

should have a similar Young’s modulus that enables the material to sustain high forces while 

remaining in the elastic domain, i.e., free of plastic deformation. In the long-term, it must 

degrade at the same timing as the implanted cells are synthesizing the tissue. This ECM 

remodelling is manipulated by the cells and depends on the biochemical balance existing inside 

the cell construct, though it is maybe also affected by a piezoelectric effect (i.e., emits electrical 

signals when mechanically requested and vice-versa) created by the collagen, since this 

molecule possesses piezoelectric properties
164

. The lines of tension change dynamically with 

loading cycles of the spine, resulting in degradation of the AF scaffold and synthesis of new 

ECM. This affects piezoelectricity inside the structure; cells are attracted to where pressure is 

felt, since the collagen upon mechanical stimulation releases electric stimulus that attracts cells 

and stimulates them to produce ECM, in order for the whole tissue to be mechanically balanced. 

This effect is similar to what happens in almost every tissue of the human body, a very good 

example is bone since trabeculae and its mineralization are coincident with tension lines felt in 

the tissue
165

. Briefly, the way that the scaffold degrades, and how its mechanical properties vary 

with it, is very important for the cell construct to be successful upon implantation. 

Nesti and co-workers
150

 decided to use only one composite material to mimic the whole 

IVD structure. They say that if the IVD fails as a unit then it must be regenerated as a material 

composite unit. They prepared what they have called a HA nanofibrous scaffold that is made 

first by electrospinning of nanofibrous poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA). The electrospun mat was 

then cut into 1cm
2
 sections and, after seeding the nanofibrous dense scaffold with MSCs and left 

overnight, a solution of HA with encapsulated cells was injected inside the PLLA cell construct. 

This, they say, created a pressurized pouch, cuboidal in shape, with the inner core of HA and 

nanofibrous elements surrounded by a sheath of dense nanofibrous scaffold. 

Munirah Sha’ban and his team
151

 also used polylactic acid as based material, but 

combined with polyglycolic acid, making a composite of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). 

They also used fibrin to allow better cell adhesion to the scaffold after seeding, this way 

reducing cell loss in this step. 

However the AF ECM is mainly made of collagen, being the principal reason why several 

research groups have been using it for AF scaffold preparation
155,157,158

. Scaffolds made of 

collagen type I or II have already shown to stimulate IVD cells to produce big PGs and long 

GAG chains
157,166

. 

 

 



39 
 

4.3.2.2. Cells 

The literature is consistent on this subject. Most of the research carried out for AF 

regeneration has used AFCs
167–169

, aside from few exceptions that used MSCs
150

. 

The cell type native to the AF is considered fibroblast-like
170

. Fibroblast cells constitute 

the easiest type of primary cells to grow in vitro. In fact, usually they are unwanted, since 

sometimes they contaminate the isolated cell culture due to its higher rate of proliferation, 

representing the worst and most common type of autologous contamination in cell isolation 

procedures
171

. Therefore, there are several approaches regarding cell types seeded in AF TE 

scaffolds, which are still not proven worthless to research as integrated part of therapeutic 

strategies that aim full IVD regeneration, even for severe cases of IDD. 

The most common approach seen in the literature is seeding the AF scaffold with 

AFCs
167–169

. These cells are easy to isolate and have the desired phenotype, since they are native 

to the tissue. If the study is being made in vitro, i.e., without an in vivo surrounding source of 

native fibroblast, then the AFCs might be the most advisable option. Since acellular AF scaffold 

assessment would only be realistic as a model for short-term implantation, long-term results 

would require in vivo studies to observe fibroblast migration. The “keep-it-simple” approach is 

the acellular AF scaffold. The idea is that fibroblast cells are easy to taxis (e.g., chemotaxis), 

and have proliferative advantage in comparison to other cell types. In this sense, the acellular 

approach can provide good results, since native fibroblast will migrate to the AF scaffold and 

proliferate, being the scaffold seeded or not. 

There is a short percentage of research in AF regeneration that uses MSCs as a seeding 

population. The main reason is to use only one cell type in the whole IVD cell construct (since 

most AF regeneration research implies the regeneration of the NP as well, due to IDD line of 

progression), and at the same time have, as a final result, both cell types - AFCs and NPCs. 

Therefore, this strategy combines the advantages from both two remaining alternatives - in a 

way, it is a “keep-it-simple” approach but also complete. But it is not a perfect approach, since it 

would require using at least two different GFs, which would significantly increase the estimated 

cost of the future optimised approach in the clinics. Also, it compensates one type of cell “keep-

it-simple” approach (e.g., NPCs in hydrogel with acellular AF scaffold), since it involves two 

paths of differentiation would complicate the already difficult task of assessing just one path of 

differentiation. 

 

 



40 
 

4.3.2.3. Combined therapy: Cell-laden scaffolds 

The great advantage of developing acellular strategies is its simplicity, rapid application 

and predictability. Though, as soon as the material is implanted the degradation time starts, thus 

it is important for cell construct’s maturation, i.e., ECM production to native tissue levels, to be 

as fast as possible. And the maturation of cell constructs in vivo is faster if cells are already 

seeded in the scaffold. Making taxis of migrating fibroblasts, from outside the cell construct, 

synergic, instead of fundamental for maturation. Therefore, several strategies for AF 

regeneration, that have been developed, use seeded cells. 

Wan and co-workers
172

 develop a biphasic scaffold just as an AF scaffold, i.e., without 

focusing on NP regeneration, this way mimicking the properties of the inner and outer AF 

tissues. A demineralised and decellularised bone matrix gelatin (BMG) from the extracted 

cortical bone using as a source New Zealand white rabbit femur was prepared as the outer phase 

of the scaffold. After the process of demineralisation and decellularisation what remains 

essentially, regarding molecule composition, is a natural material with high collagen type I 

content, like the outer AF. To mimic the inner AF tissue, they produced a scaffold orientated in 

concentric sheets of poly(PCL triol malate) (PPCLM) seeded with chondrocytes in order to 

mimic the lamella structured cartilage-like inner AF. This strategy is interesting regarding its 

biomechanics, since PPCLM spiral open when NP pushes the cell-scaffold construct, but on the 

other hand the BMG ring does not let it unfold. Therefore, it was created a string-like effect that 

mimics the AF native tissue in a different biomechanical strategy. Although, the scaffolds do 

not mimic the lamellar structure of the native AF tissue despite contrary information, therefore 

the mechanical performance of the cell constructs reached not even half of the AF rabbit tissue, 

not being enough to withstand a tensile stress of 4 MPa. In this study, it was shown that by 

controlling the PPCLM polymerization time it is possible to prepare AF scaffolds with different 

degrading behaviours that can be tuned according with the ECM synthesis along the 

regeneration process. By using a PCL-based material, it was avoided the problem of increasing 

acidification inside the cell constructs, upon scaffold degradation, since the PCL byproducts do 

not acidify the environment
172

. 

Park and his team
173

 did a study with outstanding results in terms of final silk scaffold 

morphology, resembling very closely with the AF tissue. After solubilizing the silk, a mixture of 

sodium alginate solution was added and injected it into cylindrical shaped (12 mm in diameter 

and 5 mm thick) silicon moulds. The moulds were subjected to a standard lyophilisation for 2 

days and then water-annealed to generate the insoluble state of silk by inducing ?-sheet 

crystallinity. The mixed alginate was removed from the scaffold by immersion in water for 24 

hours and the donut-shaped silk scaffolds were achieved by simple punching. The results 



41 
 

showed highly dense lamellar structure with spaces between lamellas varying from 10 to 400 

µm. The silk is a material very used in TE research, there is no need to point here its good 

biocompatibility and adhesion properties, what is in fact interesting is that this scaffold in this 

macro form and micro-lamellar structure has an elongation to failure very close to the human 

AF tissue at the first week, slightly less after 2 weeks, though. Unfortunately, regarding the 

Young’s modulus, that in our point of view is the mechanical property that really matters, is 

quite far from the human AF. Their lamellar silk scaffold had a compressive Young’s modulus 

of 0.3-0.4 MPa after 2 weeks of culture, while the human AF is around 1.23 MPa. However the 

work is far from effortless, since the morphological structure of the silk toroidal is a perfect 

scaffold, in the literal sense of the word, to guide collagen deposition. Probably, with times of 

culture longer than 2 weeks, the cell constructs can gain optimal mechanical properties, since 

silk is strong but not elastic, therefore, with further deposition of collagen the cell construct can 

become extremely elastic while still strong. 

IVD TE research is already extensive and several obstacles are being surpassed, though 

there is an argument still not mentioned, the structural compatibility, not in terms of 

morphology but in terms of optimal fitting within the intervertebral space. Generally, NP 

scaffolds are gel-like so they do not enter on this subject, but AF is an elastic solid that is often 

mimicked by a circular shaped scaffold, not even the disc-like geometry
155

. Even if the disc-like 

shape is mimicked, the top and down surfaces are not prepared according to the CEPs surface, 

therefore what is being developed are TE-TDR implants with a high potential to suffer 

displacement upon spine loading when in vivo. A more structural patient-specific type of 

approach must be addressed, and that is precisely the subject discussed in the next chapter.

5. Future Advanced Strategies for Patient-specific Tissue Engineering: Reverse 

Engineering and Rapid Prototyping 

 

TERM comprise different treatment strategies in which it can be applied a patient-

specific type of approach. The idea is to use the know-how of patient’s own cells in order to 

regenerate a specific tissue. This way, it stimulates the natural way of biological tissue building, 

in a bottom-up approach, in alternative to top-down strategy, used by repair strategies. Also, by 

using the patient’s own cells, there is a huge decrease in the risk of implant rejection, thus being 

a patient-specific treatment. 

The point where TERM diverges is on the use of a scaffold as a cell support, RM focus 

on using only cells while TE uses a scaffold combined with cells, as mentioned. In a way, RM 

treatments in general are patient-specific as far as they can get, but TE can still be more patient-

specific that it already is, since scaffolds can be structurally produced according with the 

patient’s needs. For example, if a bone tumour is surgically removed from a patient, and the gap 

that remains has a cubic geometry of 4 mm in length, then the patient needs exactly a 4 mm 

scaffold cube. That scaffold geometry is the most appropriate for that patient’s defect, but for 

the next patient probably will not be. Thus, if a patient needs a TE treatment, he will need not 

only an immunocompatible cell source (patient’s own cells) but also a structurally compatible 

scaffold. The authors believe that this is the challenge that TE is facing, the field needs to 

progress in this direction in order to produce treatments with even more patient-specificity, re-

enforcing this that is the biggest advantage in the TE strategy. 

In this sense, RE and rapid prototyping RP technologies can be fused together with TE in 

order to prepare the next generation type of cell constructs in order to fulfil the patient-specific 

structural needs. RE concerns the data acquisition and three-dimensional (3D) model 

preparation, which is followed by RP for processing the material into the desired physical form. 

 

 

5.1. Reverse Engineering  

 

RE definition first came as the process of extracting the knowledge or blueprint from 

anything man-made. Now with its increasing potential of use into the TE field, its definition can 

be extended to the process of extracting the knowledge or blueprint of any given object’s 

structure, whether man-made or not, e.g., biological. This type of engineering concerns the data 



44 
 

uptake of the patient’s anatomical structure, more specifically the part that is in need of 

regeneration, this process is called two-dimensional (2D) image acquisition. Which applied to 

biological tissues can be made by any imaging equipment system, but it has shown to work well 

with MRI
174

 or CT
175,176

. MRI seems more appropriate for soft tissues and the CT for hard 

tissues. Although, when applying RE to biological tissues a micro analyser version of these 

devices is advised in order to acquire the smallest details, which usually are crucial for the 

mechanical or physiological functioning of the whole tissue. 

For conversion and processing of the acquired 2D images several types of software are 

needed. The acquired raw images, obtained from micro-CT (µCT), are vertical images that are a 

result of sequential turning either of the analysing object within the imaging device or of both 

emitter and receiver around the object. These images must be then converted into stack images. 

Raw 2D image processing is followed by segmentation, which returns the raw 3D model 

of the native anatomical structure. In this step the user must select the part of interest within the 

2D images. This can be done by creating a mask, and by painting with it slice-by-slice (each 2D 

stack image at a time) the pixels that belong to the desired anatomical structure. The mask will 

afterwards be the 3D model, the 2D images are kind of a guide/map for the user to paint what it 

is thought relevant. It is normal in acquisition to obtain over 300 images from one sample, so 

this step can be really time consuming. But there are ways to make it faster, in some software 

there are tools such as “painting with threshold” that enables masking the pixels within a 

specific grey-scale range. Briefly, the 2D images returned from the µCT are in a grey-scale, in 

which each pixel has a type of grey that corresponds to a number that is associated to a specific 

original density (average density of the tissue’s area, which corresponds to that pixel). 

Therefore, if the objective is to select only the bone and not the soft tissues there is the 

possibility of painting with a threshold that fits in a range of whiter colours of grey-scale. When 

segmentation is finished a 3D model can be exported, though it usually has a great amount of 

information, way more than it is needed (i.e., details that cannot be applied in the following 

steps due to technological limitations regarding RP detail resolution).  

Therefore, after the 3D model (e.g., STL format) is done, it needs to be processed in order 

to reduce its computational size for easier conversion into a 3D printable file format (it depends 

on the computer system capabilities). There are some software tools that can be used, such as: 

fix, cut, wrap and fillet, but a good tool to work with is the smoothing, which reduces the 

surface roughness/detail. However, this is an indispensable step, even for the best computational 

systems, since the 3D model must mature into a closed surface with every finite element 

organised in the proper way, i.e., with a positive normal vector and no finite element 

overlapping
176

. 



45 
 

 

 

5.2. Finite Element Method  

 

The finite element method (FEM) is a relatively recent methodology, it was developed in 

the middle of the last century and started to gain interest with the evolution of computational 

hardware. This method requires a great deal of mathematical calculus, therefore it was only 

when computers gain the capabilities to handle more complex formulas that it started to be 

standardly used in the engineering industry. In the last two decades, it revolutionised the world 

of engineering, and replaced several other methods that did not require a computer, e.g., finite 

difference method, to use almost exclusively FEM. Before that, engineers made continuum 

medium analysis of a specific problem by associating it to an already known and extensively 

studied type of problem, in order to use tables to address the values of unknown parameters. 

This association is very useful, but it also carries the disadvantage of adding a great deal of 

uncertainty to the results, i.e., high error factor between real and nominal values. As a 

consequence of that, more (or stronger) material would have to be used in order for the given 

structure to be safe, resulting in higher costs than needed, among other things. 

Every given geometry can be described by a mathematical model. This formula is 

generally a complex integral impossible to calculate (or it takes an unreasonable amount of 

time). FEM uses the problem solving logic called ‘divide and conquer’, which divides a big and 

complex problem into several small and simple problems easy to solve. FEM formulation 

provides the possibility of replacing the integral ruled under the complex domain of the 

structure (volume V) by summation of integrals ruled under sub domains of simple geometries 

(volume Vi). This technique is illustrated with the following example, which corresponds to the 

volume integral of the function f: 

 

? ? ?? =  ? ? ? ??
??

?

?=1?

                     (2) 

In (2) it is assumed that: 

? = ? ??

?

?=1

 

 

(3) 



46 
 

Each sub domain Vi matches a single finite element of simple geometry, such as a 

triangle, rectangle, line segment, cuboid, among others
177

. 

FEM is used to create a mesh after segmentation, it literally divides the surface into an 

assembly of triangles or rectangles (depending on the structure) with different orientations and 

sizes making up for the whole 3D model. 

 

 

5.3. Rapid Prototyping  

 

RP was first developed to produce realistic models of given structures, not specifically 

use them as parts of a mechanism but as models for those parts, in order to help easier spatial 

visualization. Furthermore, the field evolved into the production of objects with more complex 

geometries, and made of materials with capabilities of withstanding higher forces or even 

dynamic handling. Therefore, RP equipment started to be used for industrial production
178

. 

There are several types of RP technologies divided into two ways of achieving the final 

object, subtractive or additive manufacturing. While the first removes material until the final 

object is done, the second is responsible for adding layer over layer until the production is 

finished. The three most used technologies in 3D printing (Figure 5.2) to be used in the TE field 

are: (i) selective laser sintering (SLS), (ii) stereolithography (SLA), and (iii) fused deposition 

modelling (FDM). Other technologies for rapid prototyping are laminated object manufacturing, 

solid base curing, optical fabrication, photochemical machining, among others, though they will 

not be described here due to its low interest to be used in the AF scaffold development. 

 



47

5.3.1. Stereolithography 

SLA (Figure 5.3.1) is the additive polymerization, layer-by-layer, of a material on a 

moving platform by UV exposure in selective spatial points. This method requires the use of a 

photo-polymerizable material, which at start is in the liquid state, generally called resin. This 

resin is placed inside a container, which is then selectively polymerized, following the 

computer-aided design (CAD) of the desired final object, i.e., the light beam focuses on voxels 

represented in the CAD model
179

. 

Due to the limitation for only being able to use photo-polymerizable materials, this 

method has the tendency to be more expensive. But, on the other hand, the outcomes of it are 

extremely accurate and precise, with tolerances below 0.05 mm
180,181

. 

 



48 
 

 

Figure 5.2. Stereolithography process explained in the form of a scheme. 

 

 

5.3.2. Fused Deposition Modelling 

FDM (Figure 5.3.2) uses an extruder nozzle composed by heating chamber used to fuse a 

material, generally a polymer or a metal. The melted material is extruded through the nozzle in 

areas specified by the CAD model, layer-by-layer, until the object is complete
182

. The STL file 

input is generally converted into a G-code file, which converts the CAD model into a group of 

virtual filaments that altogether make up for the 3D model. These lines are the path taken by the 

extruder while extruding the fused material, which after a few seconds of being at room 

temperature it starts to solidify. 

 



49 
 

 

Figure 5.3. Fused Deposition Modelling process: (1) heat extruder of melted material; (2) aggregated 

deposited polymer filaments; (3) printing bed. 

 

The most tempting advantage of this method is the extremely low-cost of the equipment 

system. Recently 3D printing based on FDM became very popular among hobbyists due to its 

low cost 3D printers (1,000-3,000€), and its popularity is growing with time.  

Comparing with SLA this method is more appropriate to construct bigger objects due to 

its cheap available filament polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, PLA and PVA. Although 

several other materials can be used as long as the extruder’s heating head is able to fuse it
183,184

. 

 

 

5.3.3. Selective Laser Sintering 

The idea behind SLS (Figure 5.3.3) is not far from SLA, though they handle materials in 

different phase state. While SLA uses at start a liquid material, the second handles the material 

in the form of powder. This technology applies a laser in a selective way to join the granules of 

the powder together, i.e., sintering, in order to create the 3D structure
185

. 

 



50 
 

 

Figure 5.4. Schematic representation of Selective Laser Sintering process. 

 

Briefly, the CAD model is first divided into a finite number of thin slices, and the data is 

then uploaded to the manufacturing equipment. The equipment first adds a layer of the powder 

material that is then exposed to a laser beam that only focuses on the respective areas of the 

CAD’s first slice, resulting on the sintering of this layer whereas the rest of the material remains 

in the powder form. After, the platform moves down, and the next layer of powder material is 

applied, the process repeats itself by following the next slices of the CAD model until the object 

is finished
186,187

. 

In general, all structures manufactured using any of these technologies, or others, can be 

used for a functional purpose. It depends on the technology being applied, but it mainly depends 

on the material that is used. Furthermore, it is possible to analyse if a material will serve the 

final purpose, since it is possible to simulate the CAD model under several physical situations 

by introducing in the software the known values of the mechanical behaviour parameters related 

to the material that is after used. The result will give an estimate on if the structure made with a 

certain material will have the minimal requirements for a given function or not
188

. 

 

 



51 
 

5.4. Reverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping Technologies Applied to 

Tissue Engineering  

 

The first thing that must be kept in mind, when using RE and RP in TE (Figure 5.5), is 

that the accuracy and resolution of the prototype in comparison with the original native tissue is 

limited by the less precise equipment used in the whole process – from acquisition to 3D 

printing. In general, the computational modelling does not interfere with the outcome resolution 

of the final scaffold, all it is needed is a good computer to be able to handle the amount of 

processes needed for the modelling. In the end, this limitation is placed between properties of 

the µCT and the 3D printer. Comparing the state of the art between both technologies gives a 

better outcome for the imaging side, which provides the conclusion that the 3D printer normally 

limits the resolution of the final prototype. A µCT can have a resolution down to 7µm (1072 

µCT; Skyscan, Belgium) isotropic detail detection, while an SLA 3D printer has a resolution in 

the order of 25 µm (The Form 1 3D Printer; Formlabs, USA). All of this must be analysed 

before working with 3D modelling since there is no need for extensive computational 

processing in details smaller than the limited resolution of the whole RE and RP process (i.e., 

&lt;25 µm), which can be extremely time consuming.

intervertebral disc Tissue Engineering strategy (which was followed in this work). 

 

Several strategies can be taken when using RE and RP together with TE, but can be 

resumed down to two strategies: solid-based scaffold preparation or solid-free-based scaffold
189

. 

In order to choose between strategies, one thing must be decided before – will the cell construct 

mature before or after implantation, i.e., will it mature in vitro or in situ? This is especially 

important if the tissue to be replaced is subjected to mechanical stimulus or not, in other words, 

if the tissue has or not a biomechanical function? In a way, if a solid-based cell construct is 

matured in situ then it can be classified as a short-term repair strategy while the cell construct is 

maturing, and with time it has a regenerating effect, i.e., in middle-term and long-term. The 

advantage of this approach is the low amount of time between cell isolation until implantation, 

but with the disadvantage of balancing the mechanical properties of the scaffold (while it 

degrades) versus mechanical properties of the native healthy tissue for mimicking reasons, and 

the degradation time versus regeneration rate (ECM production) to avoid gaps of malfunction 

along the treatment. 

Solid-free-based cell construct is a concept developed and used by Gabor Forgacs, 

Anthony Atala and their co-workers
189–193

. The concept has a lifetime of around a decade, but 

holds great promise
189,190

. A two year company, named Organovo™, has been created based on 



53 
 

all the work performed by him and his team, which was considered the most innovative 

company in the world in its first year of life, and in 5 months had an increased share price 

around ~600%, though with a similar decrease afterwards but it only means that investors are 

watching its evolution very closely. Its concept was named Bioprinting
192

, which uses high-

resolution 3D printers that build structures in an additive manner, like other 3D printing 

technologies. But instead of delivering filaments of fused material or polymerizing specific sites 

of the resin material, it deposits spheroid units. Spheroids, following their definition, are units of 

cell pellet in a spherical shape, although it can have other shapes (e.g., ellipsoids)
193

. By adding 

spheroids following a CAD model, the spheroids will automatically fuse together, upon cell 

construct maturation in vitro, allowing a three-dimensional support of its cells and its ECM 

product. Spheroids can be made of different types of cells, and several different types of 

spheroids can be used easily when bioprinting a cell construct. In this manner, the printing 

possibilities are massive with no significant degree of difficulty in comparison with its potential. 

Briefly, the process of making spheroids starts by releasing the cells from the culture flask and 

typical centrifuging. The pellet is then re-suspended in 4mL of medium and cultured in a small 

culture flask for one hour on a gyratory shaker. Then the solution is extracted and centrifuged at 

very high speed, e.g., 3500 rpm. The pellet is transferred to a capillary micropipette that, then, 

extrudes a cell pellet filament to be further cut into small equal fragments with a diameter of 

300 or 500 µm. These small pellet pieces are then left on a gyratory shaker to round up, by 

being cultured in suspension flasks. These spheroids have defined diameter/volume and cell 

number
194

. 

 

 

5.5. Authors’ Considerations on Tissue Engineering the Intervertebral 

Disc Using Bioprinting Technology  

 

Take for example the IVD structure as a possible application of this concept. Its 

biological formulation varies radially – from the centre to the periphery. A range of different 

types of spheroids could be made with different percentages of two or three types of cells (AFCs 

+ NPCs, AFCs + MSCs, MSCs + NPCs or AFCs + MSCs + NPCs). Each type of spheroid 

would be introduced inside one syringe. The system would work with the same concept of 

regular FDM printers, with the difference of replacing the heat extruder with a precise micro-

syringe pump. The ability to change the syringe in the middle of the bioprinting process would 

be provided, at the same time delivering precise amounts of spheroids down to one-by-one. 



54 
 

Each voxel, i.e., 3D imaging unit (3D version of a pixel), of the 3D model would belong to one 

spheroid, and each layer would be bioprinted one at a time and each radial IVD filament would 

be printed with the same syringe/type of spheroids. This is still a preliminary idea since the cell 

constructs would have several maturation possibilities. However, by encapsulating also 

bioactive molecules that stimulate the right phenotype and with external mechanical stimulus in 

the right differentiation line, by using a bioreactor, with progressing pressures, it can be that the 

only maturation possibility would be the correct one, i.e., towards a healthy native IVD. This 

way the native morphology of a healthy IVD would slowly appear until full maturation. Then 

again, this will be a rather time consuming process as well as expensive, (even) when optimized, 

since it would require GFs and, probably, serum-free chemically defined medium. 

Bioprinting technology, despite being still under optimization, for now it seems 

promising to be used for regeneration of non-mechanic-subjected tissues. This way cell 

construct maturation can occur partially already in vivo. However, when the method is applied 

to tissues that are subjected to mechanical forces, e.g., cartilage, the cell construct must almost 

fully mature in vitro before implantation, in order for it to have the capability to withstand 

compression present in the tissue and be able to function biomechanically (Table 5.1). This is an 

obstacle that solid-scaffold based TE strategies do not have, since the scaffold is mechanically 

functional while the tissue is maturating in vivo, i.e., it employs a short-term repair strategy. 

 

Table 5.1. Solid-free based TE versus solid-scaffold based TE for regeneration of mechanically subjected 

tissues. 

Strategy Solid-free based TE Solid-scaffold based TE 

Maturation In vitro In vivo 

Advantages 

Predictable after implantation - safer; 

Fast integration with surrounding 

tissues. 

Rapid preparation and application; 

Simpler; 

Cheaper. 

Disadvantages 

Expensive; 

Complex; 

Slow preparation. 

Less predictable; 

Can suffer implant displacement. 

 

In addition, the maturation of the cell construct takes a long time if not accelerated, since 

the process requires production and deposition of ECM until its typical amount, on a native 

healthy tissue, is reached. Therefore, for tissues such as the IVD, the authors believe that 

bioprinting strategies still need optimization in order to be successfully used in the clinics. 

Moreover, solid-based cell construct’s preparation looks more suitable since it enables the 

production of a cell constructs that can be minimally matured in a bioreactor until implantation, 



55 
 

and have the major part of its maturation in vivo. This because the cell construct has a solid part 

that can in the short-term after implantation serve has a repair strategy, by providing mechanical 

support and function for the whole tissue. At the same time, cells carried inside can produce 

ECM while the scaffold structure is being degraded. Therefore, a cheaper and easier alternative 

to bioprinting is to use SLA or FDM 3D printing in a RE solid-based TE strategy.

6. Final Remarks and Future Trends 

 

The IVD is a complex natural shock absorber system that is arranged in an incredible 

fashion, taking advantage of viscous gel liquid with an elastic soft tissue. NP regeneration 

substitutes, namely hydrogels carrying cells look very promising, and seem ready to be tried in 

the clinics. But IDD settles without warning the patient until it is in a severe state, since LBP is 

triggered only then. Generally that is the case when the patient seeks for medical attention. 

Annular tears are associated with AF tissue degeneration, thus it reveals loss of full capacity to 

support the NP efficiently (the remaining NP volume after discectomy), as much a hydrogel 

(extra volume added to the remaining NP volume). Thus, strategies aiming for regeneration of 

both AF and NP tissues seem to have a better probability of reaching the clinics, but an ideal AF 

regeneration substitute is still missing. 

A possible strategy, to produce an AF scaffold, is to use technologies that are only now 

reaching the TE field, although they have been used in industrial engineering for decades. RE 

combined with RP might have the potential to produce the ideal AF scaffold, though these 

technologies still need optimization to better analyse and reproduce the micron level, and 

furthermore the nano. Imaging technologies are already able to acquire data at the sub-micron 

level, it is a question of time until it evolves to an even higher resolution. This would provide 

the AF tissue’s details to prepare an accurate 3D model that could then be employed in a direct 

laser writing RP technology system. This way the lamellar morphology of this tissue could be 

mimicked, which would offer a better chance for the AF tissue to regenerate, as well as the NP.  

The next obstacle will probably be the implant displacement already being seen in the 

IVD repair field. The solution to this problem could be a biodegradable stent, surrounding the 

TE-TDR implant and both adjacent vertebrae that would remain in position until implant 

integration. 

Another problem will be the lack of data imaging from how the degenerated patient’s 

IVD was, when healthy, in order to reverse engineer it. But as long as the top and down CEPs’ 

surface topography is recordable the only parameter lacking is the correct IVD height. And that 

can be calculated by statistically studying the average height of the IVD according with its other 

dimensions. 

The future IVD TE strategies will certainly rely on stem cell differentiation. Human 

NPCs’ isolation generally is contaminated with other types of cells from the foramen region, 

upon discectomy, and NPCs tend to be already senescent due to IDD. The use of these cells is 

interesting in TE research, but when a strategy actually goes to clinics it will need a sustainable 



58 
 

cell source. Therefore, the differentiation pathways towards NPC type still need to be cleared 

and optimized. 

Moreover, the in vitro culture conditions for TE-TDR implant maturation are needed for 

this type of strategy to be successful. Thus, IVD TE lacks a tunable hypoxia (2% O2) bioreactor 

for both compression and hydrostatic pressure conditions, for culturing TE-TDR implant and 

NP cell constructs alone, respectively. 

The emerging and promising next generation of engineered NP will rely on the 

production of scaffolds with functional cues, aiming at driving proper IVD regeneration. In this 

sense, an interesting approach would be the combination of scaffolds with NPCs, or stem cells, 

with GFs to stimulate NPC phenotype, cell migration, differentiation and tissue remodeling, 

respectively. The delivery of relevant biochemical cues by drug delivery systems would allow 

their sequential release in a manner that mimics the temporal profile of the healing process in 

vivo. TGF-?1 has been shown to guide the differentiation of stem cells towards NPCs, whilst 

TGF-?3 is an important protein to maintain their phenotype. Moreover, for the regeneration to 

be successful in the long-term, a GF or a drug (e.g., bevacizumab) release system would avoid 

angiogenesis on newly formed tissue
195

. Though GG based hydrogels shown to be non-

angiogenic it degrades while tissue regenerates thus allowing angiogenesis to occur while tissue 

regeneration reaches a stable level. Therefore, a particulate system that allows the release of 

both proteins and drugs, in a sustained and independent fashion, would facilitate cell 

attachment, proliferation and differentiation of NPCs in a synergistic manner as well as disable 

the possibility for angiogenesis.

II. Patient-Specific Tissue Engineered Total Disc Replacement 

 

 

1. Hypothesis 

 

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the main cause for low back pain (LBP), to 

which the standard available treatments address the symptoms and not the disease, possibly 

followed by serious side effects. A small percentage of patients become chronic, but are these 

cases that weigh the most in LBP’s worldwide socioeconomic impact estimated at 70 billion 

euros per year
1
. Therefore, the cost per patient is very high meaning there is a gap in the medical 

market for more sophisticated treatment strategies. Therefore, effective treatments for IDD 

should minimize the suffering of a great number of patients as well as reduce its socioeconomic 

impact. 

By analysing what was discussed in the General Introduction it can be stated that a 

fully regenerated intervertebral disc (IVD), in severe IDD cases, can be successfully achieved 

by means of using a tissue engineering (TE) strategy. In fact, TE holds the potential to have in 

the future the advantages of all treatment strategies: short-term repair, long-term regeneration, 

and LBP neutralization. Several TE strategies for the NP or total IVD regeneration have been 

described elsewhere in the scientific literature
4,8,15,118,137,172,173

. For nucleus pulposus (NP) 

regeneration alone, several hydrogels have been developed for supporting native NP cells 

(NPCs) (acellular scaffolds), or for carrying mesenchymal stem cells or NPCs, namely 

alginate
118

, carboxymethylcellulose
15

, hyaluronan
8
, among others

1
. Gellan gum (GG) hydrogels 

have been suggested as a suitable platform to support NPCs functions as well as to avoid 

angiogenesis that helps to maintain hypoxia levels inside the NP, thus stimulating NPC’s 

phenotype
59,105

. The methacrylation of GG allowed tuning of its mechanical properties for 

mimicking the NP by controlling the reaction time of the methacrylation
9,143,15,16

. However, 

despite the considerable progress in engineering the NP of IVD, none has led to translation to 

clinical implementation. One of the reasons is lack of effective strategies to regenerate damaged 

annulus fibrosus (AF), since the NP regeneration strategies alone cannot effectively prevent re-

herniation in severe cases, and in average patients show signs of AF degeneration. Therefore a 

support material is needed to help holding the newly restored NP. As a component that plays a 

critical role in the biomechanical properties of the IVD, the structural integrity of AF is essential 

to confine the NP and maintain physiological intradiscal pressure upon loading
147

. The most 

used polymers for the production of AF scaffolds are mainly collagen
155–158

, and aliphatic 

polyesters that includes polylactic acid 
151,196

, polyglycolic acid 
151,152

, and its copolymers. The 

currently available literature describes that the majority of AF scaffolds have been mainly 



62 
 

processed by electrospinning in the form of nanofibers, which have been showing good 

results
146

. Polycaprolactone (PCL) in particular, has been proposed for several biomedical 

applications, including TE, due to its chemical versatility
197

, easy processability and tuning 

possibility of the mechanical properties to match a desired role
198

. Though, PCL has a bigger 

elastic domain than other candidate materials, i.e., higher resistance to plastic deformation
147

, 

due to its low melting-point (~60ºC).  

In terms of cellular AF regeneration strategies, they mainly consist in the usage of AF 

cells (AFCs), which are characterized as fibroblast-like
57

. At the same time, TE strategies often 

face the problem of fibroblast invasion, for IVD regeneration this becomes a solution, thus 

making acellular AF constructs seem more appropriate. 

Despite the several promising studies to fully regenerate the IVD
152,158,167,196

, none until 

now as achieved a precise replication of a customized IVD scaffold to prepare a TE-total disc 

replacement (TE-TDR) implant. By observing the state-of-the-art outcomes of IDD repair 

strategies, which are already being applied in the clinics, it is noticeable to presume what can go 

wrong in implanting a TE-TDR, i.e., implant displacement
170

. Therefore, patient specificity is 

important for achieving better implant integration (whether in a TE or in a repair approach) and 

thus reducing the risk of dislocation. That is precisely our main concern with this work. 

Herein, it is proposed an innovative customized implant for total disc regeneration, 

specifically for AF substitution, by means of using reverse engineering (RE) and rapid 

prototyping (RP) technologies. In this sense, it was established a method using micro-computed 

tomography (µCT) equipment for intervertebral space stack image acquisition to three-

dimensional (3D) model a customized virtual IVD replica (STL. File) for further G-Code 

refinement using a rabbit spine model as proof-of-concept. Injectable GG hydrogels have been 

shown to be a suitable platform to support and deliver cells for non-invasive injectable TE 

applications
138

. With this in mind, and aiming at mimicking the NP structure within the TE-

TDR implant, rabbit NPCs have been encapsulated in the GG-MA hydrogels and cultured in 

vitro up to 21 days. The viability of both NPCs and lung fibroblasts cell line (L929) was 

investigated by Live/Dead staining assay and DNA quantification. The NPCs’ proliferation 

profile in the methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) was assessed by mitochondrial activity over 

the 21 days of culture and compared with the same assessment for L929 cell line encapsulated 

as well in GG-MA.

2. Materials and Methods 

 

 

2.1. Spine Segments Extraction and Discriminated Intervertebral Disc 

Cells Isolation  

 

In order to fulfil this work’s objectives, rabbit spine segments were extracted for the 

purpose of discriminated isolation of IVD cells (separated isolation of AFCs and NPCs) and µ-

CT imaging analysis (a total of four rabbits were sacrificed; 4 weeks old, ~1.3 Kg; 8 weeks old, 

~1.7 Kg; 9 weeks old, ~1.9 Kg; 10 weeks old: ~1.9 Kg). For each rabbit, the dorsal region was 

opened by 2 parallel sagittal scalpel cuts, one at each side of the vertebral column. When all the 

internal dorsal tissues were cut the entire spine was lifted, both top and down extremities were 

cut, alongside with the ribs, in order to get the vertebral column loose. Furthermore, the internal 

ventral tissues surrounding the spine were also cut, leaving it detached from the rest of the 

rabbit. The spine was separated into two segments with a scalpel incision in one of the middle-

bottom thoracic IVDs (between T7 and T11 vertebrae) and placed in 50 mL conical tubes 

already filled with 25 mL of 10% antimycotic and antibiotic solution (ATB) in phosphate 

buffered saline (PBS) solution and placed at 4ºC until used. 

One lower spine segment containing the lumbar IVDs was reserved for the µ-CT 

analysis, while the remaining spine segments were processed for IVD cells’ isolation. Briefly, 

all muscle and ligament covering the thoracic and cervical spine segments were removed. A 

clean transverse scalpel cut was made in each IVD to allow access to the NP tissue. Bending the 

two adjacent vertebrae in opposing directions exposes the tissue. Furthermore, with the end of 

the scalpel blade, the NP tissue alone, i.e., without pieces of AF or other adjacent tissues, was 

removed and placed in a Falcon tube with 25 mL of PBS. In each IVD, after the NP tissue had 

been removed, both parts of the AF tissue were cut off from each corresponding cartilaginous 

endplate (CEP) with a scalpel, washed with PBS and placed in a conical tube with 25 mL of 

PBS. 

Both types of cells/tissue suspension were centrifuged at 340 g for 3 minutes, at -4ºC. 

The supernatant was discarded and the same PBS washing procedure was repeated 2 more 

times. The tissue fragments were then suspended in a solution containing the same proportions 

of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM:F12; Invitrogen, 

USA), with the pH adjusted to 7.4, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; 

Alfagene, USA), 1% (v/v) of ATB, and 0.25% (w/v) collagenase. The tubes were incubated at 



64 
 

37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Enzymatic digestion time-points were collected 

every hour, this procedure was made by filtrating the suspension using a 100 µm pore size cell 

strainer and further centrifuge the solution at 340 g for 3 minutes, at -4ºC. Then, instead of 

discarding the centrifuge supernatant this was used to wash the remaining tissue trapped in the 

filter in order to continue the enzymatic digestion. The pellet was re-suspended in medium and 

centrifuged again in the same conditions. This washing process was repeated two more times. 

Finally, the pellet was re-suspended in medium and seeded in T25 flasks. The AF tissue 

digestion retrieved more cells at the 4 hours’ time-point while the NP tissue had a better 

outcome at the 2 hour time-point. By making several time-points while the digestion is 

occurring, instead of only doing one at the end of the digestion period (around 24 hours of 

enzymatic digestion), it avoids already freed cells to be exposed to the harsh enzymatic 

environment that greatly reduces the amount of sub-cultures before the cells lose significantly 

their native phenotype. Both cell types were expanded until the third or fourth passage before 

each culture assay, always having the medium replaced every second or third day. 

Note: During all isolation process, cells/tissues from different rabbits were always kept separate, 

as well as later on through the in vitro assessment. 

 

 

2.2. Replicating the Annulus Fibrosus: Scaffold Preparation  

 

2.2.1. Reverse Engineering of Rabbit Intervertebral Disc  

The imaging analysis and 3D modelling was performed on rabbit spine segments of the 

lumbar region, to access the design of the IVDs most commonly affected by IDD. After the 

spinal lumbar segments were extracted, the IVDs were separated from the spine segment by 

making scalpel straight incision alongside the CEPs and vertebrae, leaving the whole AF and 

NP tissues completely intact. 

 

 

2.2.1.1. Micro-Computed Tomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs: Acquisition 

The designs of fresh IVDs were acquired by µ-CT (Skyscan 1072; Skyscan, Belgium) 

for two-dimensional (2D) raw (images that live in the YZ plane domain) imaging acquisition. 



65 
 

The analysis was processed with a final magnification of 13.18 µm/pixel, and with source 

parameters of voltage and intensity adjusted to 89 kV and 112 µA, respectively. 

 

 

2.2.1.2. Conversion and Processing of Raw 2D Images into 2D Stack Images 

The NRecon software (Skyscan, Belgium) was used for processing the acquired raw 2D 

images. Briefly, the areas that did not contain the IVD were discarded as much as possible 

throughout the whole RE procedure. The grey-scale threshold was adjusted to only take into 

account the pixels with grey between 80 and 255 grey-scale units (every pixel below 80 was 

turned into 0, i.e., black) to subtract any signal noise*. The images were processed for 

misalignment (which had a starting value of -1.5), smoothing, ring artefact reduction, beam 

hardening correction and finally saved as 2D stack images (images that live in the XY spatial 

plane domain). Before segmentation for 3D modelling and to help on that following process, the 

images were aligned using Dataviewer (Skyscan, Belgium). 

 

 

 

* The µ-CT analysis emits a signal on one side (0º) of the acquisition chamber, which is collected on the 

other side (180º) of the acquisition chamber, after crossing the object being analysed. Depending on the 

material’s (being trespassed) density, the sensor detects from none (0 or 0%) to total (1 or 100%) the 

amount of radiation being emitted. Thus, the amount of radiation reaching each small square that 

composes the sensor is converted into a number between 0 and 255 corresponding to the material’s 

density, which is directly involved with the signal deviation. Generally the numbers are inversely 

proportional for the sake of intuition, since the lack of signal means that a higher density material is being 

analysed, which in medical imaging generally indicates bone that is white. Therefore, 0% of the signal 

recorded is generally represented as total white that is equal to 255 in the grey-scale while 100% signal 

recording is represented in black and is equal to 0 in the grey-scale. In the end each image is composed of 

a limited, but generally large (1024x1024 pixels), number of pixels all ranged in the grey-scale both 

represented by a type of grey and a number that is directly related to its original density. After 180º 

rotation during acquisition and several images acquired, e.g., 412 images if each step takes a rotation of 

0.45º, it is possible to process the images and process them into a 3D view composed of voxels that 

follow the same representation logic of the pixels but have an additional space parameter (cubes instead 

of squares). 



66 
 

2.2.1.3. Three Dimensional Modelling 

The segmentation process of the 2D stack images was performed using Mimics 

software (Trial version; Materialise, Belgium) by creating only one mask, which was chosen to 

cover the appropriate pixels that enclosed the areas of interest in each 2D image, i.e., the areas 

representing the AF and the NP. Therefore, the ‘Threshold’ tool was employed to mask the 

pixels of interest, which are selected according with the specified range of tissue density 

(represented by a specified range within the grey-scale). Then, the raw 3D mesh was exported 

from the mask. 

In this step, the raw 3D model file previously acquired using Mimics was then uploaded 

to the 3-Matic software (Trial version; Materialise, Belgium). The 3D model was analysed for 

‘dirty’ Geometry, i.e., holes in the model’s surface, inverted triangles, overlapping triangles and 

angles between elements smaller than 45? angle
199

. The holes were then closed. Triangles were 

reverted to an optimal position, i.e., the normal vectors of each inverted triangle were converted 

to a positive value. Overlapping triangles were substituted by one triangle or a set of well-

arranged triangles. Sets of triangles composed of angles smaller than 45? were replaced by a 

more smother surface. Each one of the four tools herein described when applied can create 

defects that must be corrected with the other tools, e.g., if holes are closed in a designated 

surface, the process can easily create other defects such as: overlapping triangles, inverted 

triangles, or even small angles. Therefore, this step is a positive spiral between the four 

corrective domains until the whole surface is corrected, according with the four surface’s error 

checkers. Using different software could bring more or less surface’s error checkers, which 

would contribute to a more or less faithful RE process. 

After the mesh was created and corrected, it was smoothened until a desired resolution 

detail, in order for the afterwards exported STL file to have a reasonable size for the RP 

equipment to be able to 3D print it. Too much model resolution stalls the rapid prototyping 

process without any extra benefit, since the resolution is conditioned by the rapid prototyping 

equipment’s resolution (100 µm). With the 3D model optimized, several different pore 

geometries were made on the top and down lids of the model, in order to make the interior 

accessible for medium to enter. These porosities were designed only on the two surfaces that are 

in contact with the vertebrae, in the native IVD, and even so they were restricted only to the NP 

area (in the middle of the surfaces following the 2D NP transaxial images). Also simplified 

versions of the vertebrae contact surfaces with the native IVD were also modelled to prepare the 

top and down moulds of the IVD as adapting pieces that will allow, in future work, for the 

scaffold to be pressurized while in culture, in resemblance to the native cyclic pressurized 

conditions known to exist in the IVD. 



67 
 

 

2.2.2. Rapid Prototyping of the Rabbit Intervertebral Disc’s 3D Model  

The RP was made using a desktop 3D printer (Replicator 2; Makerbot, USA), which is 

a fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology equipment. The AF scaffolds were printed in 

PCL (Flexible Filament; Makerbot, USA) at a fusion temperature of 100ºC. The parameters 

chosen in the 3D printing software (MakerWare; Makerbot, USA) were 1 shell, 100% infill, 

100µm layer height and 200% scale of the original rabbit IVD (still half the size of a human 

IVD, thus more challenging due to resolution limitations). The printing speed was established 

for 45 mm per second of extrusion and 90 mm per second without extrusion. 

 

 

2.3. Patient-Specific Annulus Fibrosus Scaffolds Assessment  

 

2.3.1. Micro-Computed Tomography Analysis of the Replicas  

The PCL scaffolds were analysed by µ-CT, following the same protocol described in 

the x-ray 2D slices’ acquisition of the fresh rabbit IVDs (please see “Micro-Computed 

Tomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs – Acquisition”), with different parameter values, 

though. The analysis magnification was set to 19.13 µm/pixel, and the electrical voltage and 

current were adjusted to 37 kV and 226 µA, respectively. The resulting raw 2D images were 

processed also following the same protocol described above (please see “Micro-Computed 

Tomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs – Conversion and Processing of Raw 2D Images 

into 2D Stack Images”) with the slight change in the grey scale threshold selected, which was 

set between 40 and 255. 

Moreover, the CT Analyser software (Skyscan, Belgium) was used to further process 

and analyse the scaffolds’ and native IVD’s porosity and structure thickness. The processing 

steps comprised (a) filtering of the Gaussian blur type (3D space) with a radius of 5.0, (b) again 

grey-scale thresholding between 40 or 80 (scaffolds or native IVD, respectively) and 255 and 

(c) region-of-interest shrink-wrap mode (3D space) that stretches the model over holes with a 

diameter less than 4 voxels. Furthermore, the 3D analysis was made to both replicas and native 

IVD after each processing. 

 



68 
 

 

2.3.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy 

The surface and porosity morphologies of the scaffold were assessed by scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM), without any post-treatment (e.g., hydration, fixation) after 3D 

printing. Though, they were mounted onto stubs with carbon double-sided tape and further gold 

coated. The specimens were observed using SEM equipment (JSM-6010LV; JEOL, Japan) 

operating at 10 kV.  

 

 

2.3.3. Mechanical Testing 

The AF replica scaffolds were assessed for their mechanical properties using universal 

mechanical testing equipment (model 5543; Instron, USA). The surfaces of the test samples in 

contact with the equipment’s compression plates had to be plain for a homogeneous 

compression of the whole scaffold. Therefore, in the segmentation process (see “Three 

Dimensional Modelling”) the top and down surfaces were filled with mask until they became 

plain. 

Moreover, in order to calculate correctly the sample’s mechanical properties they had to 

be in a simple geometry, e.g., cylinder, cuboid, and prism. Thus, the scaffolds were punched 

into a cylindrical shape with the largest diameter possible, which for all specimens varied 

between 9.8 and 10.1 mm in diameter and 6.6 and 7.0 mm in height. These measurements were 

made to each sample before it was loaded into the equipment, to serve as input parameters in the 

equipment’s software. 

The samples were tested in dry and hydrated states, in which the second required the 

extra step of immersing the samples in PBS for 5 hours before the assessment. On both states, 

the samples were conditioned at room temperature in a dry environment for at least 48 hours 

before being processed for assessment. The tests were performed under uniaxial compression 

and its Young’s modulus was determined in the straightest linear region of the stress-strain 

graph, by means of using the secant method. Each condition was assessed for six replicates.

2.3.4. Scaffold’s Cytotoxicity Assessment 

In order to verify the possibility of using these AF scaffolds as a TE strategy, they were 

assessed for cytotoxicity. Therefore, AFCs and immortalized mouse L929 were independently 

cultured in 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates at a cell density of 20 x 10
3
 

cells/well for 24 hours in chondrogenic medium solution of DMEM:F12 supplemented with 

10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) ATB, at 37°C and in 5% CO2 atmosphere. In the same time frame, 

both PCL scaffolds and latex (negative control) were embedded independently in 20 ml of the 

same type of culture medium in a quantity of 4 g and 120 cm
2
 (less than 0.5 mm thick; 

accounting with the surface area of both sides: 2 x 60 cm
2
) clipped in 0.5 x 5 cm

2
 sections, 

respectively. Both extractions were run during 24 hours (in parallel with the cell’s attachment to 

the TCPS), in a water-bath, at 37ºC and with a shaking rate of 60 rpm. 

After the 24 hour period was complete, each extraction was filtered through a 0.45 Fm 

membrane into a sterile conical tube. These mediums alongside with the medium without 

extraction (positive control) were added independently to the wells seeded with cells in the day 

before. All conditions were left in culture for 24 hours and 72 hours, after which the metabolic 

activity profile was assessed. The experiments were performed by using twelve independent 

measurements per condition. 

 

 

2.3.4.1. MTS assay 

MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-

tetrazolium) assay was performed to assess the metabolic activity profile previously addressed. 

The cultures were incubated in 350 µl of phenol red-free DMEM culture medium solution, with 

the already mentioned supplements, together with CellTiter 96
®
 Aqueous One Solution Reagent 

(Promega, USA), containing MTS reagent, at 5:1 ratio. The samples were incubated in the dark 

in a humidified atmosphere at 37ºC and 5% CO2 for 3 hours. After the incubation period, 100 

µL of the solution was transferred from each well in triplicate to a transparent 96-well plate. 

Furthermore, the optical density (OD) was determined at 490 nm, by Synergy HT multi-

detection microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). The resulted OD for this type of assay 

is proportional to the cellular activity, being what is believed to be a measurement of the cell 

culture’s total mitochondrial activity.

2.4. Nucleus Pulposus Cell Construct Preparation  

 

2.4.1. Methacrylated Gellan Gum Synthesis 

The methacrylation of gellan gum was performed by reacting Low Acyl Gellan Gum 

(LA-GG; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with Glycidyl Methcrylate 97% (GMA; Sigma-Aldrich, 

Germany) at 20-fold molar excess in respect to the repeating unit of LA-GG, as previously 

described by Silva-Correia et al. (2010)
105

, and based on a study performed by Li and co-

workers (2003)
200

. Briefly, LA-GG was added to deionized water, at room temperature and 

under vigorous agitation, with required quantities in order to achieve a final concentration of 1% 

(w/v). The solution was then heated until 90ºC, where it was maintained constant for 30 minutes 

to 1 hour, aiming to dissolve the LA-GG completely. The solution was allowed to cool down to 

room temperature overnight. An appropriate amount of GMA was added to the solution, with 

the objective of achieving a 20-fold molar excess in respect to the repeating unit of GG. The pH 

was raised to 8.5 with 1 M sodium hydroxide (VWR, USA), and maintained constant during 24 

hours, by means of using a micro syringe pump (Fusion 200; Chemyx Inc., USA). GG-MA was 

precipitated by adding half the solution’s volume of cold acetone (VWR, USA). Moreover, the 

solution was dialysed against deionised water for 7 days using a cellulose membrane (MW 

cutoff 12 kDa; Sigma, USA), in order to remove the acetone and remaining GMA. Finally, the 

GG-MA was frozen at -80ºC overnight and lyophilised for 7 days to obtain it in the stable off-

the-shelf state of water-free foam. 

 

 

2.4.2. Preparation of Ionic Methacrylated Gellan Gum Hydrogel Discs 

The lyophilised GG-MA was sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. The 

GG-MA solution was obtained by dissolving the lyophilised GG-MA in distilled water at a final 

concentration of 1.5% (w/v), and left overnight under vigorous agitation at room temperature. In 

order to achieve the polymerized disc form (6 mm in diameter and ~3.5 mm in height; 100 µL 

in volume) the GG-MA solution was pipetted into a multidisc polycarbonate mould plate 

(moulds with 6 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height), and PBS was added over to plate with 

enough volume to cover the mould plate. The apparatus was left this way up to 30 minutes 

aiming for ionic polymerization of the hydrogel.

2.4.3. In Vitro Culture Studies of Encapsulated Nucleus Pulposus Cells 

 

2.4.3.1. In vitro cellular encapsulation 

In order to encapsulate NPCs within GG-MA discs, approximately 1 x 10
7
 cells/mL 

were re-suspended in 1.5% (w/v) GG-MA solution (prepared as previously described, prior to 

its polymerization). After homogeneous dispersion, the GG-MA cell suspension was inserted in 

a polycarbonate mould being further polymerized as previously described. GG-MA discs in the 

absence of cells were also prepared, to serve as negative control while in culture. 

The GG-MA discs, with or without encapsulated NPCs, were further cultured in a 

chondrogenic medium solution of DMEM:F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) 

ATB, at 37°C and in 5% CO2 atmosphere for different periods of culture (depending on the type 

of assay performed afterwards), until up to 21 days. 

 

 

2.4.3.2. Live/Dead Viability and Adhesion Assay  

Cell adhesion and viability were investigated by Live/Dead assay, which consists on 

using two types of probes namely calcein-AM (green; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies 

Corporation, USA)) and propidium iodide (red; Alfagene, USA) that marks live and dead cells, 

respectively.  

Briefly, the medium was removed and the samples were washed three times with PBS. 

Then, 1 mL of PBS solution containing 2 µg/mL of calcein-AM and 1 µg/mL of Propidium 

Iodide was added to each well and left for 1 hour at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of CO2. 

Moreover, the samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager Z1m; 

Zeiss, Germany). 

 

 



72 
 

2.4.3.3. DNA quantification 

Cell proliferation and viability were assessed by DNA quantification. Proliferation of 

NPCs cultured in GG-MA was evaluated after DNA quantification at defined culture times, 

namely 0 and 24 hours, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture. The DNA of each culture was quantified 

by using the PicoGreen Quantification Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Picogreen has fluorescence 

properties and binds to double-stranded DNA, therefore it allows measurement of the 

proportional fluorescence enhancement
201

. In each time-point each disc was transferred directly 

to an Eppendorf containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water (from ultra-pure water system Genpure 

UV/UF; TKA, Denmark) solution of 0.5% (w/v) NaOH.  

The third difference in the protocol already described was the use of the vortex to help 

dissolve the GG-MA just before leaving the samples overnight in the -80ºC freezer. The 

Eppendorfs were put in a 37ºC water-bath during 1 hour, vortexed and left overnight at -80ºC in 

a freezer. 

On the next day, the 20X Tris-EDTA buffer solution, provided in the quantification kit, 

was diluted upH2O at a 1:20 ratio (therefore resulting in a 1X Tris-EDTA buffer solution). 100 

µL of this solution was transferred to each well of a 96-well white opaque plate (Corning, 

USA). Moreover, the PicoGreen reagent (also provided in the kit) was diluted with the 1X Tris-

EDTA buffer solution at a 1:200 ratio. Then, 71.3 µL of this PicoGreen solution was transferred 

to each well of the 96-well plate and finally 28.7 µL of each sample solution was transferred to 

three wells (three pipetting replicates) of the 96-well plate and it was incubated for ten minutes 

protected from direct light. Fluorescence was then read at 480/20 nm of excitation and 520/20 

nm of emission in a Synergy HT microplate reader. A standard curve was made out of the 

picogreen kit’s provided DNA vial (concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2% (w/v)) for 

extrapolation of the samples DNA concentration, according with read absorbance for each 

sample. Furthermore, a solution of 50 x 10
5
 cells/mL was centrifuged and re-suspended in ultra-

pure water at the same concentration, and followed the same PicoGreen Quantification Kit 

procedure. Therefore, allowing a relation between cell number and DNA concentration, in order 

to provide the cell number present in each sample.  All the experiments were replicated nine 

times per sample condition. 

 

 



73 
 

2.4.3.4. MTS Assay 

The metabolic activity of the NPCs encapsulated in the GG-MA discs was evaluated by 

MTS assay. The protocol followed for this assessment was the same as described above (see 

“Scaffold Biocompatibility”), but instead of assessing cells attached to a 96-well plate the 

culture comprised the GG-MA disc constructs in 24-well plates for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of 

culture. 

Additionally, the viability of GG-MA discs was also evaluated for L929 cells 

encapsulated in GG-MA. Since GG-MA has been shown to have non-angiogenic properties, 

herein is assessed the metabolic activity of a fibroblast cell line in GG-MA, i.e., a cell type that 

requires a great level of cell adhesion, in comparison with NPCs encapsulated in the same 

material. All the experiments were replicated nine times per sample condition.

3. Results 

 

3.1. Reverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping the Intervertebral Disc  

 

3.1.1. Scaffold Preparation 

The procedure of developing a customized IVD through RE and RP method would be 

based on CT measurements of the patients. In this sense, aiming to observe the feasibility of this 

strategy in the TE field, more precisely in the IVD regeneration, the µCT was used to acquire 

the images to model the IVD design and afterwards analyse the PCL replica to compare the 2D 

images of both analysis types and understand if the design is maintained after being produced 

(Figure 3.1). 

 

 

Figure 3.1. Representation of the results acquired from the main steps of intervertebral disc reverse 

engineering and rapid prototyping techniques: (A) raw 2D images acquired from the rabbit IVD imaging 

analysis (5 from a set of 412 images); (B) 2D stack images after dataset processing; (C) one of the 10 

virtual representation of the IVD replica model, specifically the “small pores” model, 200% scale of the 

original native IVD; (D) photograph of the 3D printed geometrical model, 200% scale of the original 

IVD; (F) and (G) scaffold imaging acquisition and processing, respectively, 200% scale of the original 

IVD, analogues of (A) and (B); (E) fast rendering of the image dataset represented in (G). Scale bars 

correspond to 5 mm. 

 



76 
 

Thus, the raw 2D images in Figure 3.1.A (412 images in total) show both the IVD and 

vertebral tissues from one native rabbit intervertebral motion unit, which when processed 

generates the 2D stack image dataset represented by the images in Figure 3.1.B (355 images in 

total). The rendering of this stack image dataset generates the 3D model replica of the native 

IVD. 

The RP customized scaffold was prepared by uploading the 3D model onto the 3D 

printer. The printed result is shown in Figure 3.1.D that was further analysed by the original 

imaging equipment used to acquire the native IVD raw images, as previously mentioned. The 

raw images of the scaffold are represented in Figure 3.1.F that when processed generated the 

dataset represented in Figure 3.1.G, which by fast rendering produced the model visualization 

shown in Figure 3.1.E. 

While using this method of RE and RP, several models based on the original AF 

scaffold were produced. Several types of porosity patterns were designed (in the segmentation 

step), on the top and down lids of the scaffold over the NP cavity (located on the border of the 

IVD with the vertebrae in the original rabbit's IVDs) (Figure 3.2). 

 



77 
 

 

Figure 3.2. Virtual representation of IVD replica models designed with different porosities and 

correspondent photographs of the respective 3D printed scaffolds. Scale bar on the bottom right 

corresponds to 5 mm for all virtual and 3D printed models, while corresponding to 3 mm for all SEM 

images. 

 

A total of 9 different models (derivatives of the original replica model, which did not 

have any superficial porosity) were prepared, and in order to analyse them, they were named: 

“Small Pores”, “Medium Pores”, “Big Pores”, “Lines”, “4 Stripes”, “3 Stripes”, “4 Vertical 

Lines”, “Grid” and “Squares”, shown in Figure 3.2 from left to right and from top to bottom, 

respectively. 

The radial surface morphology of the scaffolds was recorded by SEM (Figure 3.3). The 

SEM results unveil the filament morphology deposited during the 3D printing process that 

otherwise is not noticeable by naked eye. It is also possible to observe the high integration 

between the several deposited layers, as well as the resolution between layers (100 µm).

plane (on top; scale bar: 500 µm), with higher magnification (in the middle; scale bar 100 µm) and ventral 

side of the coronal plane, which comprise the last layers of the 3D printing process (on the bottom; scale 

bar 500 µm). 

 

Additionally, in the research perspective regarding this method, thinking in future 

pressurized cultures, the top and down surface casts of the IVD model were also rendered, 

representing the models of the top and down surfaces of the vertebrae in contact with the 

original IVD. Also, each type of porosity designed in the IVD models was imprinted on the top 

and down moulds, for each model. With this apparatus composed of three pieces, shown in 

Figure 3.4., it is possible to culture the scaffold under anatomy-like cyclic and uniformly 

distributed compression (the top and down surfaces are naturally far from flat), while allowing 

for the culture medium to access the NP cavity through the porosity.

3.1.2. 3D Analysis 

After retrieving the aligned 2D stack images of the rabbit IVD, they were 3D analysed 

to serve as control results to further analyse which model has closer morphological 

characteristics. With this purpose in mind, the 9 different models were also 3D analysed, which 

results for average pore size and percentage of bulk material within the object’s volume are 

expressed in Figure 3.5. The porosities for each scaffold were 0.027%, 0.018%, 0.042%, 

0.010%, 0.030%, 0.017%, 0.016%, 7.132% and 0.021% for the “3 Stripes”, “4 Stripes”, “4 

Vertical Lines”, “Big Pores”, “Grid”, “Lines”, “Medium Pores”, “Small Pores” and “Squares” 

models, respectively. The native rabbit IVD, representing the positive control, had a porosity of 

0.098%.

Figure 3.5. Average pore size within each three-dimensional printed model and rabbit intervertebral disc. 

 

The analysis was set to ignore macroscopic pores over a certain size. Therefore, the 

designed porosities did not contribute to these results since they can be viewed by naked eye. 

But the pores designed in the “small pores” design were small enough to be detected in the 3D 

analysis, which measured in average 1289 µm.

3.1.3. Mechanical Tests 

Mechanical tests were performed for each condition, being homogeneously compressed 

until 1 kN of uniaxial load (~105 MPa tension in the specimens’ surface). The compressive load 

required to deform each specimen until 15% strain (deformation). Figure 3.6 shows the 

specimens’ mechanical behaviour, of both dry and hydrated states, represented as stress-strain 

curves, with corresponding linear functions of the elastic domain and yield points. 

 

 

Figure 3.6. Mechanical assessment results regarding the scaffold’s elastic deformation upon compressive 

load. The mechanical behaviour of the scaffolds in a dry state is shown at the top, while in a hydrated 

state the deformation is reported at the bottom. N = 6. 

 

The average values of Young’s Modulus for both specimen conditions upon 

compression (Figure 3.7) were 72 ± 7.8 MPa and 77 ± 5.2 MPa for dry and hydrated states, 

respectively.

unequal variances, both conditions’ compressive Young’s modulus have more than 5% probability 

(p&gt;0.05) of being equal next time the experiment is carried out. 

 

Furthermore, the compressive stress values at 15% specimen strain of dry and hydrated 

conditions were 34.6 ± 4.1 MPa and 35.6 ± 2.23 MPa (Figure 3.8), respectively.

variances, both conditions’ stress have more than 5% probability (p&gt;0.05) of being equal next time the 

experiment is carried out. 

 

 

3.1.4. Cytotoxicity Screening 

L929 cells and AFCs were used to assess the RP scaffolds possible cytotoxic effect. 

Cells were cultured in the presence of extraction medium containing leachables of the RP 



83 
 

scaffolds for 24 hours and 72 hours, after which the metabolic activity of both was analysed via 

MTS assay (Figure 3.9). 

 

 

Figure 3.9. Cytotoxicity assay results for L929 cells and AFCs in culture with the scaffold extracts after 

24 and 72 hours of culture. Positive control represents 100%; negative control represents 0%. Results 

expressed as an average ± standard deviation; n = 12. #: p&lt;0.05 vs. L929, n.s.: p&gt;0.05 vs. L929, ***: 

p&lt;0.001 vs. the other time-point; both L929 and AFCs cultures have less than 0.1% probability of having 

the similar results versus the negative control the next time the experiment is carried out. 

 

The optical density showed that the metabolic activity of the cultures with the scaffold’s 

extracts were over 80% (L929: 24 hours – 85%, 72 hours – 82%; AFCs: 24 hours – 81%, 72 

hours – 85%) in relation to the culture with regular medium (positive control). 

 

 

3.2. In vitro assessment of nucleus pulpous cells viability, adhesion and 

proliferation  

 

The cellular behaviour of NPCs, regarding their properties of adhesion, proliferation 

and viability within GG-MA, was assessed after performing Live/Dead staining, cellular activity 

profile and DNA quantification, at specific time-points. For this purpose, both NPCs and L929 

cells were encapsulated (separately) in GG-MA with a final cell concentration of 10 million 

cells per mL of hydrogel. In this sense, the viability after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days in culture was 

analysed by Live/Dead assay (Figure 3.10).  



84 
 

 

 

Figure 3.10. Live/Dead viability assay of L929 (on the left) cells and rabbit nucleus pulposus cells (on 

the right) in GG-MA discs examined under fluorescence microscopy at: 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. All scale 

bars correspond to 200 µm. 

 

The Live/Dead staining, marks viable cells’ population as a strong green fluorescence 

while the dead cells are marked in red fluorescence. These results seem to show a reduction of 

dead cells in the first 3 days of culture (Figure 3.10; both cell types at 1 and 3 days), which is 

almost unnoticeable after 7 days (Figure 3.10; both cell types at 7 days), i.e., the rate of cell 

death decreases over time. After 14 and 21 days of culture each cell type has different results. 



85 
 

The L929 cells do not show (Figure 3.10; L929 cells in GG-MA at 14 and 21 days), apparently, 

signs of dead cells, only alive cells. Concerning the NPCs culture on the other hand, it is 

noticeable a decrease in the number of viable cells until the final time-point of 21 days, where it 

is visualized an even balance between live and dead cells (Figure 3.10; NPCs in GG-MA at 14 

and 21 days).  

In order to corroborate the previous results, the cumulative amount of DNA existent in 

culture at several time-points of 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture, was quantified (Figure 3.11).  

 

 

Figure 3.11. DNA content of rabbit nucleus pulposus cells seeded within GG-MA and cultured for 0, 1, 

7, 14 and 21 days. Results expressed as an average ± standard deviation; n = 9. By one-way ANOVA, 

variances of each time-point were analysed with all others with the assuming (null hypothesis) unequal 

variances, p-values were: 0d vs all as well as 1d vs 14d and 21d - P&lt;0.001; 7d vs 21d – P&lt;0.05; 1d vs 7d, 

7d vs 14d and 14d vs 21d – P&gt;0.05. 

 

Results indicated that NPCs cultured in GG-MA did not proliferate between 0 and 24 

hours of culture. Furthermore, by observing the remaining three time-points, a stabilisation can 

be observed. Although the NPCs concentration within the GG-MA discs is always decreasing 

along with time, the cell number difference between time-points gets smaller and smaller, 

varying between 14 and 21 days by 5.1 x 10
4
 cells, while between 0 and 24 hours there was a 

decrease of 2.9 x 10
5
 cells/disc. The 21 days’ time-point retrieved a cell number of 4.2 x 10

5
 

cells/disc. 

The cellular proliferation of both L929 cells and NPCs was assessed via quantification 

of their metabolic activity at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture. Figure 3.12 shows the cellular 

activity for both cell types encapsulated in GG-MA, with a concentration of 1 million cells per 

disc, and 1 x 10
4
 cells growing in TCPS 6-well plates without GG-MA.

 cells seeded in TCPS 6-well plates without 

methacrylated gellan gum (on the left). Both culture conditions were made for L929 cells (on the top) and

p&gt;0.05, *: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.01, ***: p&lt;0.001, ##: p&lt;0.01, ###: p&lt;0.001. 

 

The NPCs activity in GG-MA was higher on the first day of culture when compared 

with the other time-points, though it decreased abruptly (~67%) after 7 days of culture. 

Nevertheless, by the day 14, NPCs activity increased ~143% in comparison with cellular 

metabolic activity at 7 days. At 21 days’ time-point the metabolic activity was similar, though 

slightly higher, than the 7 days result. 

Regarding the metabolic activity of NPCs cultured in TCPS well plate, it remained 

statistically the same at time-points of 1 and 7 days of culture. Though, after another 7 days of 

culture (14 days’ time-point) the metabolic activity was ~236% higher. Moreover, by day 21 of 

culture the optical density decreased to ~43% in relation to the optical density observed at 14 



87 
 

days’ time-point. Nevertheless, still the double of the first two time-points (1 and 7 days of 

culture).

4. Discussion 

 

The current work aims to provide a new strategy for the setup of a TE-TDR construct. 

Not only that, but the final construct must, from macro- to microscopic level, faithfully and 

specifically replicate the native patient’s IVD as it was when not degenerated. With this in 

mind, it was hypothesized that the combination of RE with RP together with TE would be a 

promising approach to achieve not only an immunocompatible cell construct, but also a 

structurally compatible IVD scaffold that fits precisely within the intervertebral space. Most 

cases of LBP caused by IDD already are in a medium to a severe state of degeneration when the 

patient arrive to the clinics (LBP is felt when a hernia presses adjacent nerves or when nerve 

endings grow inside the IVD)
202

. This means that the AF tissue is already compromised, 

therefore any hydrogel carrying cells with the objective of regenerating the NP cannot be held 

by the native AF, and herniates producing more LBP. Thus, a more complete, though not 

necessarily complex, TE strategy must be followed in order to treat these cases, which includes 

a scaffold that replaces and regenerates the AF tissue. Due to the AF’s biochemical and 

biomechanical properties, it is expected for the scaffold to have elastic properties similar to the 

native natural structure and must degrade at the same rate as the new AF tissue is synthesised by 

the AFCs. 

For this purpose, two complementary pathways were followed, one that comprises the 

regeneration of the AF and the other for the NP. Though, the final purpose is to combine both 

strategies in order to prepare a TE-TDR implant composed by a PCL scaffold, replicating the 

outer surface of the AF, filled with NPCs encapsulated in GG-MA hydrogels.  In the future, this 

novel strategy is envisaged to treat IDD, and remove LBP, by fully regenerating the 

intervertebral disc. In another side of the same approach, this work aims as well to reinforce the 

feasibility of GG-MA hydrogels as a potential support for NPCs. 

Several research groups are tuning up new strategies to regenerate the IVD
146–148,151–

155,157,158,161,162,169,170,172,196,203–208
, but most of them render to mimic the IVD shape

152
, however 

they are not focused on patient-specificity. Not withstanding, every patient has different 

intervertebral geometric characteristics, and if this geometry is replicated into the implanted 

construct there is an increased possibility that it is successfully integrated. This geometrical 

patient-specificity can be achieved without extra costs (in relation to other TE strategies), just 

by using the patient’s data already being acquired during standard diagnostic procedures. In 

fact, anatomical modelling can be performed by classical design-parametric features, using 

several types of computer aided design (CAD) software. Another possibility is the use of RE to 

convert the real system into a 3D virtual solid. In this sense, RE is presented as a process that is 



90 
 

focused on the creation of a CAD model from a physical model aiming to use the geometric 

model for its manufacturing. The first step of RE is focused on the data acquisition through non-

invasive imaging techniques, commonly used in the hospital environment for diagnosis, namely 

CT or MRI technology, these models are further generated by 3D-image-based reconstruction 

software, such as Mimics. The 3D model is parameterized and used as a reference model for 

creating patient-specific anatomical models based on dimensions extracted from radiographic 

images. 

This study describes a novel method for producing IVD scaffolds using RE and RP 

techniques. The underlying idea behind this method was proposed envisioning the possibility to 

prepare customized scaffolds for each patient individually, as previously mentioned. Herein, the 

RE process is in association with the RP technology of 3D printing by FDM, which does not 

require any solvent and offers great ease and flexibility in material handling and processing. The 

use of a filament modelling material also reduces its residence time in the heating compartment 

and allows continuous production without the need of replacing feedstock
209

. Moreover, this 

technique enables a very fast and low-cost method of producing scaffolds in a precise manner 

(resolution = 100 µm) regarding what the CAD model represents virtually.  

When a patient with LBP arrives to the medical doctor’s office to understand and treat 

his source of pain, he is advised, among other things, to be submitted to a CT or a magnetic 

resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnostic purposes. For the cases of IVD degeneration these 

images can have another purpose, and this is where the present work picks on. The stack images 

obtained by the imaging system are segmented into a 3D model that is the virtual replica of the 

patient’s IVD. This 3D model, after some modelling treatment can then be uploaded to a low-

cost RP FDM 3D printer that prepares a faithful replica (from 100 µm to the macroscopic level) 

of the patient’s IVD in the desired biomaterial (any given biomaterial suitable for FDM 3D 

printing). By comparing the Figures 3.1.B and G it is possible to observe the pattern 

resemblance that in B is the shadow regions and in G are the bright regions, both representing 

the IVD volume, native and replica respectively. The centre image in Figure 3.1.G reveals the 

NP cavity that is not noticeable in the native image dataset, though the respective cavity volume 

was designed according with the grey-scale threshold, which left a lighter “pixel fog” over the 

shown cavity region. This voxels were removed to avoid unnecessary heavy processing of the 

model in the 3D printer software, since voxels are ~14 µm of side they are not expressed unless 

when in groups of at least 7 x 7 x 7 cubic voxels (343 voxels altogether) due to the 3D printer 

resolution limitation. 

Several porosities were designed in the resulting IVD replica generating several 3D 

models that were afterwards 3D printed. There were some porosity patterns that could be 



91 
 

transposed from the virtual model to the real object, though some could not, it mainly depended 

of the resolution required by the pattern and the orientation of the scaffold while being prepared, 

since FDM technology is conditioned by gravity. The IVD replica 3D model does not include 

the NP volume (i.e., the model is hollow), thus, if the scaffold was printed in anatomically IVD-

like position, the top lid (over the NP cavity) would collapse on the bottom lid (below the NP 

cavity) before the PCL could solidify due to lack of support for the fused PCL being extruded. 

This creates the need to add support material inside the scaffold, i.e., material not represented in 

the CAD model that is needed for the object generation, which would compromise the 

mechanical behaviour (and probably the biocompatibility of the final construct) of the scaffold 

if not removed. Therefore the scaffold was turned 90º from anterior transverse plane to inferior 

coronal plane, which allowed the preparation of at least 6 of the 9 porosity patterns with high 

matching degree. These porosities, in a future work, will be assessed for permeability to analyse 

which porosity better matches with the native IVD range of permeability. The non-reproduced 

precision details that were not transposed from the virtual model to real 3D printed object could 

be easily overcome if the RP system was a stereolithography (SLA) system, due to its higher 

resolution. However, it addresses the limitation of narrowing the range of source material 

available. The material needs to be photo-polymerizable that for PCL means the need to use 

photo-initiator, which can create a whole new set of challenges, e.g., cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, 

it is an interesting idea to explore as well, since it enables a higher degree of resolution and does 

not rely directly on gravity in the solidifying site.   

Herein, PCL was proposed for this procedure due to its mechanical properties, 

specifically its elastic domain at physiological temperature. Since the RP process will only 

replicate the solid part of the native IVD, i.e., the AF, the substitution material should have a 

degree of elasticity AF-like. The PCL has been proposed for AF regeneration by several 

research groups
167,172,210

. This polymer possesses a very low melting point (~60ºC) that confers 

it a greater elastic domain than other polymers at 37ºC. This is an ideal property for an AF 

scaffold to have, since it must be able to sustain not only one big load, but rather several loading 

cycles. Therefore, it cannot sustain a loading force for the sake of plastic deformation, it must be 

able to be subjected to the loading and afterwards return to the original morphology, remaining 

ready to absorb the next loading cycle. Thus, it shall never go into plastic deformation by 

sustaining the pressure before reaching the Yield Point, otherwise the material will suffer from 

mechanical fatigue that ultimately leads to fracture. 

Best et al. measured the compressive elastic modulus of the AF by confined 

compression, the resulting modulus was 0.38 MPa
211

. Umehara et al. demonstrated that the 

compressive modulus of the AF was 0.11 MPa
212

. The compressive young’s modulus of the 

produced IVD scaffolds in dry and hydrated state was 72 MPa and 77 MPa, respectively. 



92 
 

Comparing to the native AF elastic modulus, it was observed a higher compressive young’s 

modulus, however, considering that the produced scaffold presents a compact structure, it shows 

that in the future it would be possible to create more porous in this structure. In this study, the 

RP process was programmed to infill the AF volume 100%, this parameter can be lowered, 

which will probably decrease the Young’s modulus exponentially. Moreover, as previously 

mentioned, the scaffold is made of PCL that presents a melting point of about 60ºC, thus if the 

mechanical tests were performed at physiological temperature (37ºC) instead of room 

temperature (~20ºC) the resulting elastic modulus would be lower.  

These compressive modulus values (72 MPa and 77 MPa), for both states, can be 

considered very close, which shows how predictable and stable these scaffolds are, being in 

accordance with Lebourg et al. results, whom tested mechanically PCL electrospun scaffolds
213

. 

Although, this similarity in the mechanical behaviour between both states was already expected 

due to the hydrophobic nature of this material
214

. Moreover, the porosity results express that the 

empty volume inside the scaffolds is an average of 0.023% (not considering the NP cavity). 

Therefore, suggesting that the NP cavity is the key feature responsible for the difference 

between compressive modulus by being filled when the scaffold is hydrated. 

Alongside with its good mechanical properties, the PCL degrades into non-acidic 

byproducts
172

. In this sense, the biocompatibility of the 3D PCL IVD scaffolds was also 

assessed. The mitochondrial activity, measured via MTS assay, at 24 and 72 hours produced an 

optical density between 81% and 85% in relation to the positive control, thus suggesting a good 

degree of biocompatibility.  In fact, this result is not surprising since this parameter was already 

reported. Koepsell et al. prepared electrospun nanofibrous PCL scaffolds for AF TE, although  

it was not performed a cytotoxic assessment, the in vitro studies shown an increased AFCs’ 

proliferation and activity along with culture time suggesting biocompatibility
210

. Wan et al. 

prepared an IVD construct in which the inner AF scaffold was composed of poly-

(polycaprolactone triol malate). The biocompatibility evaluation using mice as a model revealed 

no obvious immunological reaction after 1 week
172

. Similar status results were also shown in 

other studies for bone
215

, cartilage
216

, cardiac
217

, vascular
218

 and skin TE
219

. 

As previously mentioned, the AF scaffold is hollow inside since a cavity, which 

replicates the NP design, is left in the 3D printing process envisioning that afterwards an 

injectable hydrogel containing patient’s NPCs could be introduced in this cavity. Therefore, and 

continuing the parallelism with what happens nowadays in the clinics regarding an IVD 

degeneration condition, when the patient is submitted to a discectomy (procedure for a disc 

hernia removal) the tissue instead of being discarded is kept for NPCs isolation. These cells, 

after expansion or not (second surgery vs. NPCs availability), can be encapsulated within the 



93 
 

hydrogel and further injected in the hollow part of the PCL AF scaffold. If no cell expansion is 

needed, the AF scaffold can be prepared between diagnosis and surgery, and the NPCs’ 

encapsulation in the hydrogel would be performed in the operating theatre and further injected 

in the AF scaffold. Then the TE-TDR construct can be implanted in the same procedure as the 

discectomy (which would, naturally, seize to be a discectomy). If not, then a second surgery 

would be needed, as it is nowadays for recurrent disc herniations that ultimately lead to a spinal 

fusion
220

. 

Ionic-polymerized low acyl GG hydrogels have been proposed by 3B’s Research Group 

for TE strategies
121,140,144,221

. In fact, this GG based material was chosen as a carrier for NPCs for 

several reasons. What seems to be the one characteristic that distinguishes GG from other 

hydrogels is its non-angiogenic property
59

. The GG is a hydrogel with low cell adhesion 

characteristics, thus unwanted cell types, which generally require strong attachment to the 

surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), or biomaterial, do not migrate and proliferate in the 

GG. Therefore, angiogenesis is avoided inside the replaced IVD, which is essential for an NP 

TE strategy, since avascularity stimulates NPC phenotype expression
52,53

. Moreover, the GG can 

be submitted to a methacrylation reaction with glycidyl methacrylate, and by controlling the 

time of this reaction it is possible to tailor the desired mechanical properties
121

. When 

methacrylation is preformed to GG, the final product is a mixture of GG and GG-MA, therefore 

the more time the methacrylation reaction occurs the more amount of GG-MA will be present in 

the final material. In fact, by allowing the GG to react with glycidyl methacrylate for 24 hours, 

the resulting material has a storage modulus of 89.5±7.4 kPa, resulting in more favourable 

mechanical properties than regular GG that is 56.2±1.4 kPa
144

. Briefly, the storage modulus is 

the ability for the material to retain mechanical energy, subjected to it, before reacting to the 

mechanical stimulus. In the other hand, the NP is an extremely hydrated tissue, thus the material 

chosen to replace must have good hydrophilic properties. GG-MA is able to polymerize with 

1.5% (w/v) concentration, thus the remaining 98.5% is water. It is interesting how this material 

can hold more water than the NP and still have similar mechanical properties. Therefore, the 

GG-MA seems a promising material to be used not only for IVD regeneration but also for other 

TE purposes. 

The in vitro assessment follows the results obtained in previous studies
105,144

, in which 

the biocompatibility of GG-MA was tested with L929 cell line and human IVD cells by calcein-

AM staining and cytotoxicity assay. Herein, the viability, proliferation, metabolic activity and 

qualitative characterization of rabbit NPCs encapsulated in GG-MA were assessed. 

Furthermore, L929 cells were also encapsulated within GG-MA hydrogels in order to compare 

the metabolic activity of NPCs with a more adherence requiring cell type. Results of DNA 

quantification and Live/Dead assay for the culture of NPCs in GG-MA show great cell loss after 



94 
 

the first day of culture. This may be due to the encapsulation process that takes some time, and 

while it is being followed, the cells are out of the incubator at room temperature, being exposed 

to harsh conditions (e.g., centrifuge process, lack of medium supply, and absence of adherent 

surface). Therefore, this process consumes a great number of cells not directly, but due to 

encapsulation cell stress that can increase cell death in the first 24 hours, which was confirmed 

by the Live/Dead results, which after one day of culture showed a high number of dead (red) 

cells. These results are corroborated by DNA quantification, since it shows a decrease from 1 x 

10
6
 cells to 6.9 x 10

5
 cells, corresponding to a decrease of cell number in approximately 30%. 

On the other hand, the metabolic activity was higher than any other time-point, suggesting 

metabolic activity triggered by encapsulation stress. However, after this short time, very few 

dead cells were noticed, being corroborated by the DNA quantification results. Surprisingly, the 

L929 cells in GG-MA culture was metabolically less active than NPCs, what was not expected 

since L929 are generally used as a positive control population thus retrieving higher results. As 

previously reported, GG-MA may be selective to different cell types, since this hydrogel has 

been shown to be not ideal for high adherent cell types. Thus, it is foreseen as a good platform 

for NP regeneration, since it does not allow the contamination by high adherence cells types, 

such as the IVD in relation to angiogenesis and fibroblast-like cells migrating from the AF. 

Therefore, these results are in accordance with what was reported by Silva-Correia et al. in 

which the non-angiogenic properties of the GG-MA are demonstrated
139

. 

In this work, a concentration of 1 x 10
7
 cells/mL of GG-MA was used, since it is the 

adopted cell density described in the literature of NP regeneration strategies
8
. In this study, it 

was observed a decrease in cell number along with the time, thus suggesting that the initial cell 

seeding number is too high for these culture conditions (i.e., 20% oxygen and unpressurized 

environment), since like in a degenerated NP the cell number decreases with normoxia 

conditions
48,52,53,222

. Therefore, without pressure environment and hypoxia stimulus, the seeding 

number of cells cannot be sustained, decreasing successively until a balanced cell concentration 

is achieved.

5. Concluding Remarks and Future work 

 

The aim of this work was to develop a therapeutic TE strategy in a patient specific 

perspective. Thus, theoretically it is possible to apply this strategy by using the data acquired for 

IDD or hernia diagnosis alongside with a patient’s cell source, whether NPCs harvested in 

discectomy surgery or stem cells. 

The designed scaffold can be changed according to the native AF morphology, by 

replicating the lamellar structure, which can be prepared by 3D printing with equipment that 

possesses higher precision, such as SLA 3D printing. Probably in the next couple of years FDM 

3D printers will start to have higher resolution, i.e., below 100 µm, and if a 50 µm is possible, 

the lamellar structure can be replicated through RE and the whole scaffold may have a 

mechanical behaviour similar to the native AF. Moreover, with lamellar structure or with a 

lower infill it brings the opportunity to inject AFCs in this new porosity, allowing co-culture in 

vitro studies aiming to compare an acellular with cellular strategy (e.g., AFCs seeded on the 3D 

printed scaffold) alongside with encapsulated NPCs in GG-MA hydrogels in the NP cavity. In 

the future, if technology permits the possibility of 3D printing the design of the lamellas in the 

scaffold, after culturing the full TE-TDR under compression stimulus it will be interesting to 

assess if there will be aligned growth of collagen type I filaments between the scaffolding 

lamellas. 

This work serves as baseline data for future studies focused on culturing this cells + TE-

TDR construct under a pressurised system, using the vertebral surface casts, in a hypoxia 

environment coupled with transforming growth factor-?3 supplement, aiming to promote and 

maintain the NPCs phenotype. 

Moreover, different features can be coupled with the present strategy, namely the 

exploitation of the piezoelectric phenomena, which is an intrinsic property of collagen type I 

and II, known to be the protein basis of the IVD’s ECM.  A conductive PCL composite can be 

also used to stimulate electrotaxis precisely where it is needed while maintaining good 

mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Thus, electrical stimulus can be used to encourage 

AFC’s to synthesise ECM in a native like alignment. The subjacent idea would be to induce the 

production of the first synthesized ECM in a native morphology to increase significantly the 

correct maturation of the cells + scaffold construct in vivo.  

In fact, a solid approach to achieve a truly reliable IVD TE strategy would use the 

following steps: 



96 
 

? GF’s cocktail optimization for MSCs differentiation into NPCs, and further 

encapsulation of both (GF’s cocktail and MSCs) in GG-MA; 

? Model and design a patient specific AF scaffold with a precise native-like 

lamellar structure with an electroconductive PCL composite; 

? Inject a hydrogel, e.g., a blend of GG-MA with silk hydrogel, containing AFCs, 

in the interlamellar spaces; 

? Inject the GG-MA containing MSCs and GFs in the NP region of the scaffold; 

? Culture this construct in a bioreactor, adapted with vertebrae casts (for 

homogeneous mechanical stress distribution), with 2% oxygen and under cyclic 

pressure until biological stabilization is achieved; 

? Implantation of the construct in vivo. 

Fortunately, there is no lack of ideas for trying to achieve a functional TE strategy to 

regenerate the IVD. The authors strongly believe that in the near future there will be a feasible 

TE strategy for the IVD in the clinics with the potential to overcome IDD.
