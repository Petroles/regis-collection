RESUMO 

 

O setor informal em Gana é muito grande e emprega a maior parte da força de trabalho do país 

tanto nas atividades agrícolas quanto nas demais, mas ainda assim contribui muito pouco em 

termos de receita tributária. O objetivo de todo país em desenvolvimento é o crescimento de sua 

economia através do uso de suas receitas internas e a minimização do uso de empréstimos e 

subvenções que trazem dificuldades para o país. A maneira mais importante de tornar isso 

possível é através do uso da receita fiscal, ferramenta fundamental para a construção e 

sustentação das economias nacionais. Uma das áreas que exigem atenção nesse sentido é o setor 

informal. De uma população estimada de 1.5 milhão de ganenses que pagam impostos diretos, o 

setor informal representa menos de 5% desse número.  

O ponto central dessa tese é o potencial de contribuição do setor informal para os cofres públicos, 

uma vez que esse apresenta grande potencial de crescimento e geração de receita, especialmente 

se for levada em consideração a parcela de população que obtém altos rendimentos e tem 

condições de pagar impostos, mais ainda não o faz. Para que o governo possa aumentar sua 

receita fiscal sem recorrer ao aumento das taxas é necessário ampliar a rede fiscal para nela 

incluir todos aqueles que deveriam pagar impostos. Gana utiliza o sistema progressivo de 

impostos, o que assegura que os impostos sejam proporcionais à renda. Isso significa, portanto, 

que a carga tributária é uma responsabilidade compartilhada por todos os cidadãos, e o setor 

informal não é exceção. 

 

Palavras chave: Gana – setor informal – tributação – formalização

ABSTRACT 

 

The informal Sector in Ghana by its size is very hug and employs the largest number of the 

country’s labour force in both Agriculture and Non-agriculture activities yet, contribute very little 

in terms of tax revenue. It is the aim of every developing country to grow its economy by using 

more of its own internally generated revenues and to minimize or do away with securing loans 

and grants from donors which brings a lot of hardship on the country. The most important way of 

carrying out this is through the use of “Taxation Revenue” which is the fundamental tool for 

building and sustaining national economies. One area that needs concentration in this regard is 

the informal sector. Out of an estimated 1.5million Ghanaian tax population paying direct taxes, 

the informal sector consists less than 5 percent of the number. This thesis focuses on the informal 

sectors potential to contribute substantially into the tax revenue coffers, since the sector is highly 

potential in the growth and revenue generation, especially those in the high income spectrum of 

the sector who has the condition to pay taxes, yet are not paying. In order for the government to 

increase its tax revenue potential without increasing the tax rate is to widen the tax net to capture 

all those who are to pay tax. Ghana is using the progressive tax system in its direct tax 

administration, which ensures that the more your income the more tax you pay and the lower 

your income the lower tax you pay. It’s therefore means that the tax burden is a shared 

responsibility of all citizens of the country for which the informal sector is not an exception.

INTRODUCTION  

 

One major challenge facing many developing countries including Ghana is raising 

adequate revenues internally to finance its social and developmental programmes. It is the 

aim of every developing country to be able to grow its economy by using more of its own 

generated revenues in order to become self-sufficient, for which Ghana is not an exception. 

In 2011, Ghana was declared a Lower Middle Income country, which then imposes 

more challenge of self-reliance on internally generated funds than the over reliance on 

donor funding of its major developmental programmes. 

 For some decades, Ghana’s budgeted revenues always fall short of its budgeted 

expenditures, thereby resulting in huge deficits. For instance, Ghana’s budget deficit was 

estimated at 3.2 percent of GDP in 2007, currently (2012) Ghana registered a budget deficit 

of 12 percent of GDP, which gives an increase of about 8.8 percent in five years.  Budget 

deficits impose a barrier to achieve the projected goal of becoming a Middle Income 

economy by the end of year 2015 (Budget statements 2007 &amp;amp; 2013). One of the reasons 

why deficits arise as obstacles for growth is public debt – both domestic and external - as 

its payment divert resources from governmental productive investments in education, 

health care and infrastructure building among other needed investments. 

One and most important way of achieving this goal is through the use of Taxation 

revenue
1
. Taxation is a fundamental tool, which is used to provide the essential revenue to 

build a state that is accountable and responsive to its citizens. Thus it becomes an important 

instrument for building and sustaining national economies. At the same time, accountability 

and transparency make easier for governments to tax its constituency, and to get support for 

a wider tax base (Prichard, 2009).   

Ghana has a tax system that includes taxes on income and property,  taxes  on  

domestic  goods  and  services,  international  trade  taxes  and value-added tax (Osei and 

Quartey, 2005). Up to 1999, when VAT became operational, the largest component of 

Ghana´s revenue was taxes on international trade. Nowadays, the most important category 

is the income and property taxes. The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) component of these taxes, 

represent almost a third of this category. The second most important source of revenue is 

the value-added tax (VAT) was introduced initially in 1995, withdrawn and re-introduced

in 1998. The conflicts surrounding VAT´s implementation show the need to be extremely 

careful when trying to implement new taxes. 

In order for the government to increase its tax revenue potential without increasing 

the tax base/tax rate is to widen the tax net to include all those who must pay taxes. There 

are two types of problems included here, one is pure tax evasion, and another is simple 

under reporting of income. In a very small set of cases taxes are not paid for simple 

ignorance of this duty.   

Due to their organization, mid-sized and large firms honor their tax duties, but small 

units and self-employed workers barely contribute to the total tax revenue of the country.  

There is a major conceptual issue involved here: On the one hand, there is the 

problem of the economic–legal- activities that are not registered by the Government 

Statistical Offices, and thus go unaccounted in the GDP statistics. On the other hand, there 

is a certain proportion of the working population that is not under the protection of the labor 

laws or the social protection net: self-employed people and workers in very small economic 

units (micro units). The first group is included under the label of “underground economy”, 

“unregistered activities” or “informal economic activities”. The workers who are part of the 

second group are usually labeled as members of “informal sector”. 

There is a non-void intersection between those categories, clearly, as members of 

the underground economy don´t pay taxes, but a certain proportion of the so called 

“informal sector” certainly do. VAT and income and property taxes are collected from both 

the formal and the informal sectors of the economy, while international trade taxes are only 

collected from units in the formal economy as they are generally of medium to large size, 

and thus registered. While the formal sector is well structured in honoring its tax 

obligations, the same cannot be said of the informal sector. 

The informal sector of Ghana employs more than 80percent of the total labour 

force, which is largely self- employed, yet it contributes very little to the total tax revenue 

collection of the country. It is estimated that out of about 1.5million Ghanaian tax 

population paying direct taxes, the informal sector contribution consists only 5 percent of 

the number (Terpker, 2013).  

Seth Terpker, the Minister of Finance, in his address to the Top managements of the 

Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) the body in charge of tax administration in the country, 



 
 

3 

 

has said among other things that the informal sector continue to be the worst offenders 

when it comes to tax evasion.  

Ghana is using the progressive tax system in its direct tax administration, which 

ensures that the more your income the more tax you pay and the lower your income the 

lower tax you pay. It’s therefore clear that the tax burden is a shared responsibility of all 

citizens of the country for which the informal sector is not an exception. The informal 

sector’s contribution to GDP in 2009 is estimated to be 38.4percent. Thus, one can expect 

that the sector with such a size could contribute substantially to the tax revenue of Ghana. 

Many changes can be done in terms of taxing, not only the richest part of the Ghanaian 

population, but also foreign capital, big firms and financial capital. Those changes could 

bring forth higher tax revenue and greater levels of tax justice, In spite of those 

possibilities, the main focus of this work is to identify ways in which the informal sector 

operatives can increase its tax revenue contribution to the state.  

A persistent feature of the Ghanaian economy is the large share of self-employment, 

as well as very small scale economic units, that conform to the so called “informal sector”. 

Some members of the sector have the capacity to pay taxes, so they can be transformed into 

a source of revenue that could add resources for economic development. It can be noted 

that how to tax the sector remains a very difficult task (Anuradha&amp;amp;Ayee, 2001), because it 

means also that there is a need to discuss policies aimed to formalize economic activities 

and labor relations, to support micro and small scale activities and at the same time to 

strengthen the government´s punitive and fiscalization capacities, viz a vis tax evaders with 

a real capacity to pay. 

As governments of developing countries are finding ways of increasing internally 

generated funds to meet the growing pressure on them to improve infrastructure and other 

socio-economic developmental issues facing their countries, a big informal sector is an 

important target for tax revenue, this is particularly important since the bigger share of that 

sector is in the total economy, economic viability, market share and relatively large 

incomes accrue to informal sector participants (Santos, 2013). Public policies to improve 

income, productivity, revenue and economic performance of micro and small units can help 

the formalization of informal enterprises and its labour relations, and to reduce tax evasion 

in the formal sector.  



 
 

4 

 

Thus, proposals to formalize and tax at least the more successful groups of the 

informal sector enterprises and workers, especially the urban informal sector, that can lead 

to increase in tax revenue come to fore as an important problem to be confronted. 

The objectives of this study are to describe the main characteristics of urban 

informal sector in Ghana and to define which sector, activities or people should effectively 

pay tax, separating them from the poor people working in the informal sector; analyze ways 

of formalizing the informal sector in order to increase their tax contribution, considering 

some important international experiences, mainly the public policies focusing on Brazil; 

analyze the inhibiting factors that make it difficult for the informal sector to contribute 

substantially to the tax revenue of Ghana; to offer some suggestions that when addressed 

can help the Ghana Revenue Authority to effectively tax the sector. 

The importance of this study stems from the fact that the informal sector has 

become a focus of developing countries in their quest to maximize revenue from within and 

not to always depend on foreign donors as well as borrowing to carry out economic 

developments. This study can be justified also on the grounds of the need to think about a 

more fair tax revenue structure that also contributes to reducing inequality. 

The study will also add to the numerous research and existing body and knowledge 

on international experiences on how to formalize the informal sector for the expansion of 

the economy, improve the labour conditions and remuneration and also to increase tax 

revenue. In these sense, the study will further help policy makers, especially, GRA-DTRD 

in fashioning out ways to address the critical issue of taxing the informal sector. 

This work adopts the use of secondary information such as journals, academic 

studies and official information from ILO, Ghanaian Government and other countries and 

international institutions which are of relevance to the study. The study seeks to analyze the 

potential contribution of the informal sector (urban-informal sector) to the tax revenue in 

Ghana taking into consideration it huge size in the labour market. The study will also 

consider the issues of formalization and how it can lead to increase in tax contribution from 

the sector. 

Unfortunately, the researcher is constrained with obtaining adequate information on 

the urban-informal sector in Ghana. It seems much attention has not been put on the 

importance of the sector under consideration. The government needs to resource the Ghana 



 
 

5 

 

Statistical Service adequately for them to conduct in depth research to cover all aspect of 

the informal sector and its contribution to the country. 

The broad outline of the study are that, chapter one will analyze the Ghana economy 

in area of Labour market and the general features of the informal sector. The second 

chapter will also look at the SMEs in Ghana and government support to them, the chapter 

will also consider the discussion on formalization with some international experiences. The 

third and the last chapter will consider the tax structure of Ghana and the contribution of 

income tax from the various sectors of the economy. The final part of the chapter will 

assess the main aspect of the informal sector taxation and offer recommendations on how 

the sector can be formalized in order to increase the tax revenue.

CHAPTER 1: ECONOMY, LABOUR MARKET AND GENERAL FEATURES OF 

INFORMAL SECTOR IN GHANA 

 

 

The informal sector´s contribution to GDP in the Ghanaian economy is very 

difficult to estimate in this work because there is lack of information on it by the Ghana 

Statistical Service, the institution in charge of providing economic data in the country. A 

figure of 22% was recorded by (ILO/JASPA, 1989) and 38.4% is estimated as the sector’s 

contribution to GDP in 2009 (ISODEC, 2009). This contribution tells how the informal 

sector is of great importance to the state and would wish to see its reflection in their tax 

revenue contribution.
2
  

The persistence of a large agricultural sector, with low levels of productivity and a 

large share of small farms, is a telltale signal of economic underdevelopment. This is so 

because average income generated in those activities is extremely low. Thus the country 

might lack enough capacity for sustained growth, as investment and savings rates certainly 

will be very small. This is particularly true in former colonies, as the colonial powers were 

only interested in extracting agricultural or mining surplus and guaranteeing a stable market 

for the imported goods they produced at the Metropolis. 

As another consequence, the power of the State after independence was relatively 

weak, with lack of revenue that limits the capacity of the country in the area of industrial 

investments. The lack of an industrial sector and the resources needed to build up one sets 

developing economies like Ghana into a vicious circle of low investment, low income and 

poverty. As the vast majority of the population needs some sort of labour income, the 

possibilities of self-employment stand up as a survival strategy for many workers. In the 

case of Ghana, the resource based economy meant that industrialization is not a current 

national priority. Revenue derived from raw materials or food products cannot use for 

capital accumulation. 

                                                           
2
 Informal sector operatives in Ghana, lack technology in their activities, most of them uses labour intensive 

capital in their work, unlike the formal sector that operate with a lot of technological equipment.  Operatives 

in the sector work from simple tools to power operator equipment. These equipment’s are rarely imported, 

they are either self-constructed or second-hand that need some improvement. Raw materials used by the 

informal sector for their work are largely from local resources or obtain from the formal sector.  Some 

materials are also locally produced, discarded materials (Scraps) and very low imported goods that cannot be 

locally obtained.   

 



 
 

8 

 

Under these conditions, the lack of stimulus for generalized economic growth 

results in a stable (if not growing) small economic units expansion.   

Ghana had its fair share of liberal policies in the mid-80s which adversely affected 

its labour market showing a constant decline in formal sector jobs, falling standards of jobs, 

low economic activities and poor living standards of Ghanaians. During the 2000s, high 

rates of GDP growth were accompanied by a very low level of employment creation and a 

growing informal sector. This shows that, from a structural point of view, because of the 

neoliberal policies implanted during this period, the positive impacts derived from GDP 

growth were minimized.  

In a relatively poor country, whose modern productive sectors and manufacturing 

activities are underdeveloped, poverty and the harshness of daily life in rural areas; force a 

rural urban migration process, with people seeking better jobs, access to social services and 

better living conditions. This urban expansion process promotes informal sector growth, 

growth that was intensified by decades of liberal policies. Therefore, in the last decades, 

Ghana’s labour market has seen a dominance of informal employment, self-subsistence 

activities, low productivity and small income agricultural activities. 

 

1.1  Labour Market and Informality in Ghana 

In terms of occupation in the country, a significant number of 3,875,957 

representing 40.1% of the population are in agricultural employment. Another category of 

employees who deserves much of attention is ‘Service and Sales Workers’ due to their 

recent contributions to Ghana’s economy. 21.5% of the population representing 2,076,970 

of the labour force is service and sales workers (see table below). However, despite the 

fairly recent rates, the growth performance of the economy has not been sufficient to meet 

the employment needs of the rapidly expanding labour force. A high number of employees 

in this sector are not in permanent employment despite the various professions they find 

themselves in. Regardless of the fact that temporary employees can be found in professions 

such as banking, sales and marketing, teaching, information technology etc., contract or 

temporary employees are generally employed in hazardous jobs or jobs of low complexities 

with earnings below that of their permanent counterparts and in most cases they are less 

likely to have health and pension benefits. 15.6% of the population engages in craft and 

related trade works. Professionals and Managers also account for 5.5% and 2.5% 



 
 

9 

 

respectively. Of the active population, only 1.5% are clerical support workers and 1.9% are 

technicians and associate professionals.

Source: GSS 2010 Population and Housing Census 

  

The 2010 Population and Housing Census conducted by the Ghana Statistical 

Service on 170 Metropolitan, Municipal and Districts Assemblies revealed that, out of 

14,040,893 of the population who are potentially to be in some economic activity, 73.1% 

(10,268,699) are involved in some kind of economic activity
3
. The labour market currently 

has a total of 9,657,179 employed with 4,713,480 males and 4,943,699 females. There is 

more percentage of females than males currently in some economic activity. The total 

participation rate is 73.1% and an occupation rate 68.8%. The unemployment rate was 

around 6%; in absolute terms, the unemployment figure shows a total of 611,520 persons 

currently without any employment and again with a female dominance as they number 

337,187, compared with 274,333 unemployed males.
4
 This shows that occupation and 

participation rates are high, and at the same time unemployment levels are not high, in a

 A total of 3,772,199 people are not economically active which may be as a result of being at school, 

incapacitation, ill health or women playing housewife roles.

 The survey considered economically active population to be ´all persons who did some economic activity 

for pay, profit or family gain seven days prior to the enumeration´. Leave applicants, temporary ill and 

temporarily laid off persons who also did some work before the survey were considered employed. People 

who did not work seven days prior to the survey and were looking for job but stop are not considered 

unemployed except those who did not have work but were actively seeking work, or were, at least, available 

to take up work if they were offered some during the reference period.

country where economic reforms in the last decades meant less employment in the more 

organized formal sector.

 So the major impact of those reforms was an expressive growth 

of informal activities and self-employment, for men and women equally.

Public sector employment was greatly reduced because of the neoliberal policies 

implemented and so it was one of the most important factors that explain the observed 

growth of urban informal sector activities. Data from the GSS quarterly digest (1960-1991), 

showed that major expansion of public sector employment in Ghana took place before 1965 

recording 10.2 percentage points’ increment over the 1960 public sector employment when 

there exist numerous of government establishments in Ghana.
6
 The sector saw a drastic 

decline in it employment generation between 1975 and 1989, due to the crisis times of coup 

d’états in the seventies and the Structural Adjustment Programmes in the early eighties. 

According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census report, the public sector of Ghana´s 

economy employed 475,416 (6.4%) of the total labour force in the year 2000. Although the 

number of employees increased in the 2010 census, the percentage share in the labour force

 Ghana´s unemployment figure currently stands at 6% for both sexes and high among females (6.4%) than 

males (5.5%). This figures don´t include long term unemployment  as people who are not working but stop 

looking for job 7 days prior to the enumeration will not be considered unemployed The criterion used by the 

GSS which is a benchmark of IMF in the survey does not give a true reflection of the unemployment situation 

in the country. 
6
 The public sector increased its work force by 40 percent. Public sector employees are the number of people 

on government payroll as are referred to as workers in the Civil Service, Ghana Education Service, Judiciary, 

the law enforcement agencies, the Article 71 employees, the Foreign Missions, and Subverted Agencies.

declined to 6.2% as captured in table 5 below (GSS, 2012). The private sector (both formal 

and informal) has become the sole provider of all essential services and also the main 

source of employment. This reduction in the state´s role of employment creation in recent 

years can be attributed to the introduction of the economic reforms by the government in 

2008, as a way of reducing the public wage bill. Thus, the private sector has become the 

sector of attraction for the teeming jobseekers, but the supply of formal Jobs in this segment 

was not enough to counter the expansion of informal activities. The formal sector 

employment in Ghana is referred to as those having a legally enforceable employment 

contract with employee and contributing to the Social Security and National Insurance 

Trust (SSNIT) or both in the private sector. The private sector encompasses a wide range of 

economic activities. Among these activities are; banking &amp;amp; non-banking financial services, 

mining, construction, agriculture, forestry &amp;amp; logging, manufacturing, transport, trade, social 

&amp;amp; personal services. Because of the negative impacts of neoliberal reforms on formal 

employment, in recent years, the sector has received considerable attention from both 

government and development partners, aiming at developing and positioning the sector to 

support the public sector as a major source of formal employment.  

The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), in its 2011 annual report 

shows that the formal sector establishments covered by the scheme increased from 27,980 

establishments in 2007 to 36,534 in 2011. Of this figures the private sector has the highest 

share of 27,857 as against the public sector’s share of 123 in 2007. In 2011, out of the total, 

the private sector still has the highest 36,534 establishments with the public sector 

managing a share of only 101 establishments.  

 Again the SSNIT report indicates that in 2011 out of an estimated 963,619 

employees contributing to the scheme in Ghana. More than half of this number (560,955) 

representing about 58.21% are private sector employees, all public institution contribute the 

remaining of 402,664 (SSNIT, 2012 p.15). However, despite the above impressive figures, 

employment from the private formal sector in total employment fell from 8.5 to 6.8%, and 

remains relatively small, according to the 2010 census results (see table 5 below).  

In addressing the labour market issues in Ghana, one cannot skip the issue of 

minimum wage which is at the heart of a successful income policy. At the beginning of 

every year Government, Employers and the Organized Labour (Tripartite) meet to fix the 

minimum wage for workers. This wage is the amount below which no employer must pay a 



 
 

12 

 

worker. As part of the communiqué which is issued at the end of the meeting, the minimum 

wage does not attract tax. This is done by considering the economic indicators at the time. 

This has over the period increased steadily, especially in the last decade. The minimum 

wage for 2013 is GH¢5.24 (US$ 2.6) daily. Earnings or incomes from the sector are 

generally low. Many of the informal sector employees earn less than the monthly minimum 

wage as compared to their counterparts in the formal sector, about 58% earn below the 

minimum wage in the country (Baah, 2006). The statistical data from the GLSS5 indicate 

that 46% of food crop farmers earn less than the national minimum wage. The report 

further shows that 10% of private formal and 8% of public sector workers also earn less 

than the monthly minimum wage (GLSS 5). Unfortunately, there is no study on the average 

income of informal sector workers in the country. The table below shows the national 

minimum wage from 2000 to 2013 as contained in the above report and also by the Ghana 

Trades Union Congress
7
. From the table below, one can see how low wage levels in Ghana 

are which force even people with formal jobs to still have enterprises in the informal sector 

to support their monthly incomes, which has contributed to the high informal sector 

operations in the country. 

Again, profit also varies between different activities. Records on the profit and 

earnings of the sector is not available, however, Sowa et al., 1992 and Barwa, 1995, 

provides that about 21% of the enterprises at the large end of the small-scale spectrum 

experience over 50% growth in output as compared to only 9% of the micro enterprises, 

which means when incomes or profit are relatively low, it impedes growth. In as much as 

we recognize incomes or profit of the informal sector entrepreneurs as low, some segment 

of them also earn relatively high returns yet, they still find themselves in the sector. 

Thus, income levels for informal sector activities and for self-employed workers is 

low, but employers of the more organized small scale activities have higher income levels, 

potentially compatible with paying taxes

The Exchange rates are from the BoG and the Minimum wage data from the GTUC. Ghana redenominated 

its currency in July 2007, the new Ghana Cedis exchanged for the old cedi at ¢ 10,000.00 toGH¢1.00, Data 
from 2000 to 2007 are in the old Cedis and that of 2008 to 2013 in the new Ghana Cedis. Monthly minimum 

wage is calculated as daily MW multiplied by 27.

1.2  Classification, dynamics and structure of urban informal sector in 

Ghana 

This section is restricted to the enterprises that form the non protected segment of 

labour in urban Ghana, that is self-employed workers either with employees or not (Micro 

and small scale enterprises). This group is constituted by self-employed or own-account 

workers, owner of small businesses, employee of small, medium or big businesses without 

register or access to labor rights who deal in production, sales and distribution of goods and 

service in the urban areas of the country. 

More than half of the employed population in Ghana are self-employed or own-

account workers and a significant proportion of the labour force that are in wage 

employment also does not have formal employer-employee relationship making it 

extremely difficult to provide them with any form of protection, leaving them in the contest 

of job insecurity and low income. Public policy relating to the labour market has undergone 

significant changes over recent years, these changes respond to demands for greater 

flexibility in the labour market but they also respond to the pressures of growing levels of 

unemployment and its consequences for worsening conditions in the labour market. The 



 
 

14 

 

negative impact of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) which was implemented in 

most developing countries including Ghana in the 1980s and the early 1990s had long term 

consequences (Barwa, 1995). 

The above mentioned groups of workers are usually included under a single name: 

informal urban sector. There is a long standing discussion regarding how to define the 

informal sector, which activities constitute the sector and what name to give to it. The first 

organization to officially adopt the term Informal Sector was the ILO, in a report on 

employment in Kenya and continued to act as a driving force behind the study and the 

debate of the concept. Keith Hart, an anthropologist whom the origin of informal sector is 

attributed to, in his paper, Informal income opportunities and urban employment in Ghana 

(Hart, 1973), presented at an Institute of Development Studies (IDS) conference on Urban 

Unemployment in Africa in 1971, described the “economic activities of the low-income 

section of the labour force in Accra, the urban sub-proletariat into which the unskilled and 

illiterate majority are drawn” (Hart, 1973 p.61). Hart further focused on individual income 

opportunities and placed wage-earners in the formal sector and self-employed in the 

informal, which include both legitimate and illegitimate income sources (ibid, p.68-69). 

The use of the term informal sector became widely accepted among academia and the 

international development community in the 1980s. Thomas (1992), acknowledged the fact 

that there was some understanding of what kind of activities or groups of workers that 

could be associated with the sector, but focus and definition still remain.  

The ILO adopted the term informal sector because what it used to be the traditional 

sector had become “profitable and efficient enterprises as well as marginal activities”. 

Thus, the change in the activities of the sector had a total change in the idea that this sector 

would eventually be absorbed into the modern capitalist or the formal economy and 

disappears (Chen, 2005, p.2&amp;amp;3).  

Researchers have defined the informal sector in many ways. Many of these 

definitions are descriptive because of the difficulties involved in capturing all the 

dimensions of the informal sector in one definition. The most common features of the 

sectors activities are that the sector is unregistered, unregulated or the institutions escape 

regulations. Peattie 1987, p.851, describes the informal sector concept as “exceedingly 

fuzzy”. Thus, bringing a lot of confusion in coming out with a single definition of the 

sector. 



 
 

15 

 

The following are some of the definitions that have been used in the literature and 

are of relevance to this study. We should keep in mind that the first two definitions used the 

term “informal sector” as synonymous with undeclared or underground economy.  

a) Feige (1989) defined the informal sector as “all currently unregistered economic 

activities that contribute to the officially calculated Gross National Product”. His 

definition point to the fact that the sector is recognized but yet not registered, either 

for regulation or tax purposes. 

b) Schneider (2005) re-echoes the fact that the sector’s economic activities and the 

income derived from that circumvent or otherwise escape government regulation, 

taxation or observation. In other words, the informal sector here does not include 

illegitimate activities such as smuggling, armed robbery, just to mention a few. 

These illegal activities even though may provide income to the individuals 

involved, but add very little value to the society and the national economy (Fambon, 

2006). 

c) Farrell et al (2000) and Thomas (1992) have defined the sector in two approaches: 

“the definitional and behavioral”.  

 

According to Farrell, the definitional approach, “is an economic activity unrecorded 

in the official statistics such as the gross domestic product and/or the national income 

account” whiles the behavioral approach, sees the informal sector on the basis of “whether 

or not activity complies with the established judicial, regulatory and institutional 

framework”.  For Thomas, the definitional approach is used to estimate the size and the 

economic value of the informal sector, and the behavioral approach is used to explain the 

causes of the informal sector. In broad terms, he refers to the sector as all productive 

activities, which are not included in the national income accounts of the country (Thomas, 

1992).  

Amin (2002, p.9), also stress that defining the sector depends largely on country by 

country and went ahead to come out with two approaches in which the informal sector can 

be defined, his approaches are 1) the Enterprise or 2) the status of labour.   

Informal activities in the urban and rural sectors are very different, so there is a 

clear need to examine them separately (Adu-Amankwah, 1999, FES, 2012).  



 
 

16 

 

The rural informal sector is basically agriculture activities, ranging from small farm 

units, peasant or subsistence in nature, fishing and fish processes to rural agro-based 

processing. Agriculture (Both rural and Urban) employs about 54% of the total labour force 

and 63% of all self-employment non-agriculture work in Ghana. The actors in the informal 

agriculture sector are mostly illiterates or semi-illiterate, thus, they have not gone through 

any formal education or training. They generally depend on apprenticeship for their skills 

as well as family labour (Baah, 2006). The rural informal sector have less income, less 

organized and low productivity, and the urban informal sector have more potential to 

formalization and to increase their tax revenue. 

On the other hand, the urban informal sector, the main subject of our work, is 

characterized by its heterogeneity. The sector´s activities are grouped into small, medium 

and micro scale businesses in the areas of trading, transportation, construction, food 

preparation, dress making, footwear making, distilleries, Services, Manufacturing etc. 

According to Barwa (1995), male dominance in the areas of manufacturing, such as metal 

fabrication, footwear making is more than their female counterpart who dominates in the 

areas of Service sector such as food processing, trading and dress making.  

According to the GSS, 2008, 80% of the informal sector work is dominated by three 

sectors, agriculture/fishery workers (55.1%), manufacturing/craft workers (13.4%) and the 

service/sales workers (13%). As it has been established earlier, agriculture is predominantly 

rural occupation, however many urban informal activities are dominated by service/sales 

work, such as, wholesale and retail, vehicle repairs.  

In this text, the focused is on the urban informality, we consider the urban informal 

sector to include enterprises that are not legally registered, regulated, protected and 

majority of whom are self-employed without employees (own account businesses) and self-

employment with employees, they have ease of entry and exit as well as a very high 

competitive environment and they generally engage in transactions on cash bases which 

makes it difficult for authorities to monitor their real income. Many of the operatives in the 

sector do not have permanent premises for their businesses; they operate in areas they can 

be seen in the general public. Many of them also operate from their residences, with some 

under sheds and structures. They are also puts under the threat of the local authorities to 

eject them from the public spaces (Baah, 2006 and Osei-Boateng, 2011). 



 
 

17 

 

In 2010, out of the total informal labour force of 8,364,649 (86.2%), 51% were from 

the urban area and 48.8% in the rural area. From the table 4 below, informal sector activity 

is high in the rural area (92.7% of the labour force) as compared to the urban area (66.2%). 

Non-agriculture employment is higher in the urban areas (47.4%) of the country than the 

rural areas (17.7%).  According to Baah (2006, p.12), Self-employment in the non-

agricultural activities account for 28% of total labour force and 37% of all informal sector 

workforce in the country, with women accounting for 57% of all informal sector activities. 

According to Amin (2002, p.11), estimating the size of the sector remains 

problematic, thus most countries are not able to conduct comprehensive survey on the 

sector leaving out a lot of areas that are important to the sector. In Ghana, the size of the 

informal sector is estimated to be 86.2% of the total labour force, according to the 

Population and Housing Census (PHC) conducted by the GSS in 2010 (GSS, 2013). The 

sector is made up of self-employed with employee, self-employed without employees, 

contributing family workers, apprenticeships, as well as domestic workers (GSS, 2013, 

p.266). Although there are no data to prove the size of the urban informal sector in the past, 

it has been in existence before the SAP, by considering the survey conducted by Keith Hart 

in 1973 on the urban informal entrepreneurs in Ghana however, the current data show that 

the introduction of the SAP worsened the situation with it numerous changes in the labour 

market. The largest is the self-employed without employees, which are small/medium scale 

enterprises in nature.   

The informal sector of Ghana lack proper linkage with the formal sector. Most of 

the products of the sector are sold directly to the final consumers. This does not encourage 

growth and formalization of the sector. There should be a mechanism that will require the 

formal sector to patronize the products of the informal sector. The public sector can design 

laws that will ensure that the informal sector becomes the first point of call for any goods or 

service required.  A proper linkage of the two sectors is very important, as this can be a 

vehicle for the transmission of skills, resources and market for the benefit of both sectors.  

The situation where, policies and regulation in the labour market are designed to the 

advantage of the formally registered firms is not encouraging proper and coherent linkage 

of the two sectors. Most of the informal sector enterprises provide raw materials or supply 

finished goods to the formal firms either directly or through other informal intermediate 

firms. Like the structuralist school of thought that believe that the formal and the informal 



 
 

18 

 

sector economies are intrinsically linked, and that to ensure increase competitiveness, 

capitalist firms in the formal economy are seen to reduce their input costs, which include 

the labour costs, by promoting informal production and employment relations with 

subordinated economic units and workers. Chen, 2005, acknowledge that to understand the 

linkage between the formal and the informal economies it is important to consider the 

nature of the production system through which they are linked. I believe there is also the 

need for government to step in to invest in the economy in areas that will require the use of 

the goods and services of the informal sector, because the reliance on the private formal has 

failed to offer the needed linkage to promote the growth agenda of the informal sector.   

The average size of employment is four, however, the number vary on the type of 

activities, for instance those in restaurants will require more hands than those in transport 

business (Baah, 2006). The tendency of informal activities to grow is so great that even 

workers with good educational levels get their jobs from this sector. Currently an estimated 

number of 250,000 fresh graduates enter the labour market annually; yet, the formal sector 

absorbs only 2% of this number leaving the rest either in unemployment or in the informal 

sector (Ulandssekretariatet, 2013).

Majority of informal sector entrepreneurs are self-employed without employees, 

they accounted for 68.2% in 2000 and 60.1% in 2010 of the labour force. Self-employed 

with employees are mostly found in the restaurants, woodworking (furniture), metal 

fabrication, construction and commerce (wholesale and retail). The sector´s employment 

ranges from retail and restaurants 50%, manufacturing 37%, services 10% to transport 3% 

(Yankson 1992, Barwa, 1995). This category account for 5.2% in 2000 and 4.9% in 2010 

(See the table 6 below). 



 
 

20 

 

The table below shows that a high percentage of the active population is in ‘Self 

Employment without Employees’. Self-Employed with employees account for only about 

5%, meanwhile, they are mostly private informal jobs with challenges of job insecurity and 

low incomes influenced by local customs and traditions of employment devoid of 

employment and employment relationships as in the case of formal employment where 

employment contracts tend to be subjected to some measure of legislative control making it 

extremely difficult to provide them with any form of social and legal protection. High 

numbers of the self-employed category are subsistence farmers in husbandry, forestry and 

fishing. Majority of them can also be seen at the major cities in Ghana mainly Accra (the 

capital) engaging in one economic activity or the other just for survival. It can be concluded 

that employees in this category are just occupied by this form of employment in spite of the 

fact that most of them earn below the national minimum wage. Ayee, 2007 in his paper 

“Building Tax Compliance through Reciprocity with Government” has provided a lot of 

informal organizations and associations
8
, (Pages 3 &amp;amp; 4). These groupings represent the 

majority of the informal sector activities in Ghana.

 Some of the informal groups are: Ghana Private Road Transport Union, Ghana Cooperative Transport

According to a recent data, about 80% of all manufacturing employments and 90% 

of employment in trade and commerce is provided by the informal sector, with about 56% 

in the service activities (FES, Ghana, 2011). Majority of the men in the informal sector are 

into the services and the manufacturing activities, whiles, the women are mostly into 

trading and commerce activities (Ibid, 2011). The labour Act in Ghana has it that 

employment relations are formalized by signing of a written contract between employers 

and employees. This provision is not complied by many private businesses both formal and 

informal with the latter been the worst affected. Section 12 of the Labour Act states that 

´´the employment of a worker by employer for a period of six months or more or for a 

number of working days equivalent to six months or more within a year shall be secured by 

a written contract of employment``.  

The compliance of this provision is not enforced by the authorities responsible. In 

Ghana, enforcement of the labour law is generally weak and the fact that the informal 

sector is not regulated makes it very difficult for any action to be taken against those 

employers (Osei-Boateng, 2011). The fear of a worker losing his/her job also prevents them 

from reporting to the authorities, making them more vulnerable to their employers. The 

informal worker has but very little chance of demanding his/her rights in an employment 

relation. The trade union has a greater responsibility to ensure that the informal sector 

workers are organized in order for them to enjoy their rights as workers. The enforcement 

of the labour Act to cover all workers irrespective of the sector need to be taken seriously, 

if there can ever be an end to this numerous inhuman treatments informal workers go 

through as well as ensuring that the minimum wage policy is implemented to cover these 

vulnerable workers. These are aspects that also contribute to the expansion of informal 

employment in Ghana. 

Ghana´s informal sector as it has been identified earlier is made up of many 

activities mostly concentrated in the urban cities in the country, mainly the domestic 

workers and the street vendors sectors.

 One domestic worker is said to be in every 

household with larger households having more (LAWA-Ghana, 2003, Osei-Boateng, 

                                                           
9
 The hidden nature of the domestic work in Ghana makes it difficult to obtain any statistical data on its 

activities. They are generally carried out in private homes, with very few in offices. The labour Act (Act 651, 

2003) section 175, has defined domestic worker as “a person who is not a member of the famil y of a person 

who employs him/her as house-help”.  

 



 
 

22 

 

2011). In Ghana, the practice of using poor family relations as unpaid domestic workers is 

also common which normally end up seeing the use of under-age as domestic workers 

(Tsikata, 2009). These workers are usually from poor or deprived background and have to 

survive no matter the circumstances they find themselves. Activities of domestic workers 

range from house-helps, gardeners, private security workers, cleaners, laundry men/women, 

drivers, cooks to nannies (Osei-Boateng, 2011).  

When it comes to employment of domestic workers, they are normally done through 

friends and relatives, so, there is no legal contract of employment between the employer 

and the worker, agreement is mostly verbal. Although in Ghana, formal contract are 

supposed to be sign between employer and employee after six month of regular 

engagement in a year, same cannot be said for the informal sector in general and domestic 

workers in particular. In some urban centers there are recruitment companies and agents 

who recruit domestic workers as intermediaries, these companies usually sign the contract 

with the employer on behalf of the worker. The companies then ensure that all disputes are 

resolved. The agents on the other hand, only ensures that the worker get the work, takes his 

commission, any contract is between the worker and the employer, he does not perform any 

mediation function again (Osei-Boateng, 2011).The lack of written contracts in the 

informal sector and especially the domestic workers is the result of “unfair termination of 

employment relations by employers in the sector and some domestic workers also leave 

their employment at will without notice” (Ibid, p.9). 

In terms of wages, the domestic workers like most informal sector workers, earn 

below the national monthly minimum wage in most households in Ghana, there is no 

separate law that fight for the right of domestic workers as in the case of Brazil. According 

to Osei-Boateng, in 2010, domestic workers in the capital city of Ghana (ACCRA), 

received monthly wages between GH80 (US$57.00) and GH 100.00 (US$71.00). Although 

these payments were above the minimum wage at the time, they were still low, especially 

dependent individuals.  

In Ghana, street vendors mostly are found in the urban cities especially the major 

capital cities. Like the domestic workers, there is no statistical data or information from the 

Ghana statistical service on the activities of the street vendors as well.  A study on the 

activities of these street vendors conducted by Mittulah and cited by Osei-Boateng 

however, reveals that majority of these people are women, including widows, who have to 



 
 

23 

 

put food on the table of her family. Their male counterpart also join street trading at a very 

young ages with the hope to leave when they get good jobs (Mittulah, 2003 and Osei-

Boateng, 2011). 

Education attainment is also very low among street vendors. 52% of street food 

vendors in Accra had basic education as the maximum education level and 36percent had 

no education (Obeng-Asiedu, 2000, Osei-Boateng, 2011). The major driven force of street 

vending like most informal activity is poverty. “As many as 92.5percent, of street vendors 

in the capital city (Accra) were found to be migrants from other regions in the country to 

seek better standard of living” (Osei-Boateng, 2011, p.7). Most of these people come with 

the hope of leaving with their relatives to better their lives, but they end up in the street to 

fend for themselves. 

Unlike domestic workers and other workers within the informal sector, street 

vendors are mostly self-employed, they control their own profit from the sales they make, 

although these incomes can be irregular, they are able to manage it. 

 

1.3 Life Condition of Workers in the Urban Informal Sector 

Informal sector employees in Ghana do not have any social protection, many of 

them are not considered in the decision making process, not even the once that affect their 

work, such as, their wages, health and safety at the work place. Access to benefits such as, 

sick leave with pay, annual leave with pay, pension scheme are not guaranteed at all as well 

as lack of income and job security (Osei-Boateng, 2011).  In Ghana, there is a pension 

scheme that mandates employers and employees to contribute into a fund that gives 

guarantee to workers on retirement. Many informal workers do not enjoy these facilities 

because of lack of written contract. However, the scheme allows individuals within the 

informal sector to make their own contributions with a defined benefit at the end of their 

working life (SSNIT, 2012). This arrangement is for both self-employed persons and 

workers. The special scheme allows interested informal sector individuals to make 

contribution at their own convenience, daily, weekly or seasonal basis. One can have some 

sort of relief in the fact that if employers are not contributing to their future; they have the 

opportunity to do so by themselves. The government has also established some social 

protection programs for the citizens which operatives in the informal sector can also take 

advantage of them to support their livelihood. Some of the schemes are: The National 



 
 

24 

 

Health Insurance Scheme, the Capitation Grant to basic school children which guarantees 

free basic education for all school going age, free school feeding program, the free school 

uniforms and the supply of exercise books to basic schools as well as the cash transfers for 

the very poor households known as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 

(FES, 2011, P.4-10).   

Majority of the informal people are not highly educated, some researchers put it at 

about 36.1% (Ayee, 1977) to 50% (Yankson, 1992), these are those whose education is 

below the secondary school level. Currently, in Ghana, education attainment in the 

economic active population as reported by the GSS are that 33% have never been to school, 

47.8% have obtained basic education whiles, only 19.2% have secondary education and 

higher.  Apprenticeship also is important in the informal sector - GSS put the numbers at 

2.8% and 2.7% for 2000 and 2010 respectively -, as skills and knowledge is transferred to 

others. This was higher in the 1990s, about 54% (Yankson, 1992). The levels of literacy 

also have direct relationship with the level of informality in a country. It is obvious that, 

with a low formal labor supply and a great labor surplus population in the urban areas, 

people with low education cannot be attracted by the formal sector. Employers are looking 

for persons with high skills to work with, by this those with very low education finds 

themselves in the informal sector to make a living or survive.  According to Baah, 2006, 

“countries where the share of formal economy is large, their literacy rates are also high”, 

which then means that the reverse is also true. There is a positive correlation between 

poverty, underemployment, informal sector and lack of public policies.   

But it is important to emphasize that there is not necessarily a causal relationship 

between low education level and informal employment. A greater supply of jobs in medium 

and large companies and the public sector, due to possible higher levels of development 

and industrialization and higher rate of economic growth can increase the rate of 

formalization, by employing workers in the formal sector who currently are not hired 

because there is no demand and not because they have a low level of education and 

qualification. Even in more advanced and developed countries in this current pattern of 

capitalist development, sectors are compatible with workforce of low-skilled occupations 

because they are repetitive jobs such as assembly lines, construction, cleaning etc. On the 

other hand, the increase in development and the pace of industrialization and economic 

growth are aspects that contribute to the rise in per capita income and tax revenues, 



 
 

25 

 

allowing greater investment in education, training and professional qualification. Thus, the 

correlation reported by Baah (2006) expressed over the relationship between low level of 

development, low per capita income, low investment in education at the same time hinder 

higher education spending and limit the expansion of formal employment, since capitalist 

sectors that are typically more organized, with highest levels of productivity and able to 

offer formal jobs have low share of the total employed population.  

On the other hand, workers in the informal sector face appalling living conditions 

related to the lack of urban and social infrastructure. Ghana is generally fighting to cube its 

sanitation problem, especially in the urban areas. Health of Ghanaians in general and the 

operatives in the informal sector in particular poses great danger. Poor public and 

environmental health, in both the residential and market areas where informal sector 

workers operate is a major urban problem in Ghana and are risk to the health of many 

informal workers (Apt and Amankrah, 2004; King and Oppong, 2003; Kwankye et al, 

2007, Osei-Boateng). Heaps of garbage remains the common sight on the streets of the 

major cities even as vendors do brisk business. Many workers in the informal sector are 

either ignorant about hazardous practices or substances or simply cannot afford protective 

gadgets because they are expensive. Some work in environment with very high dust or 

noise levels, under the scorching sun or extremely high or cold temperatures. Some are 

exposed to dangerous chemicals, vibration and excessive lighting. They are thus exposed to 

all forms of diseases such as typhoid, malaria, and other forms of occupational diseases. 

This sicknesses if not handled as early as possible can cause death to this informal workers. 

 

1.4  Conclusion 

The much talked about economic growth has not created enough jobs for the people 

of Ghana. Unfortunately, these gains have not also reflected in the expansion of formal 

sector or in improving the lives of its people. The question is what is economic growth 

without improvements in the livelihood of the citizenry? Almost all the productive sectors 

of the economy witnessed growth in recent years led by the service sector, yet, there are 

still growing informality, which shows that the growth of the economy is not linked to job 

creation that has the potential of reducing poverty, reducing informality as well as reduction 

in the high growth of rural-urban migration.  



 
 

26 

 

The country over the years has been dependent on import oriented policies, this I 

believe need to be reversed. Ghana exports its products to the international market in it raw 

state, no value added, this call for government to embark on public investment policies that 

can establish industries to add value to our products before exporting them. By this more 

job opportunities can be created to bring down unemployment and informality. One 

important area is the Agricultural sector that has not receive attention in the area of  

technology and mechanization, the country still rely heavily on rainfall for cultivation, no 

irrigation programs for farmers to improve their methods of farming, no better road 

infrastructure from farming areas to market centers. This has brought a lot of hardship to 

the rural areas whose major occupation is agriculture, contributing to the issues of poverty 

and migration to the cities to search for decent jobs, but end up in the informal sector for 

survival. Lack of rural development, infrastructural deficit and low productivity in the rural 

areas has resulted in the high level of migration to the urban areas. The government and 

policy makers need to address these issues to encourage reduction in the high urban 

informality in the country. 

 Informal sector as we can see from the above information stands at 86.2%, of the 

labour force in the country which has the tendency of retiring the development that is 

expected. The lack of formal job opportunities in the country and especially in the urban 

areas has resulted in the country’s huge informality. To address this situation, government 

and policy makers should put in more public investment initiatives aiming at creating jobs 

by moving the country to the era of industrialization and also encourage more of the 

informal enterprises that have the potential of formalizing to do so. However, the issue of 

formalization has been dealt with in the second chapter. 

The government and policy makers need to look at how the informal sector can be 

included in the national account of the country through strategies for formalization and tax 

payment. In spite of the informal sector´s contribution to the Ghanaian economy, most of 

the informal sector workers live in a very deplorable condition such as housing, health, 

education and sanitation.  In order for the informal sector to contribute meaningfully to the 

nation in the area of taxation, government should implement public policies to improve the 

conditions within which this entrepreneurs and workers find themselves. Again, public 

investment in the area of building more schools, health facilities, roads etc. will help to 



 
 

27 

 

create job opportunities for the informal workers that can encourage them to pay more 

income taxes.

CHAPTER 2: SMALL AND MICRO ENTERPRISES, FORMALIZATION AND 

INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES 

 

The focus of the chapter two is to identify the structure and the dynamics of the 

Small and Micro Scale Enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana and government policies to support 

them. The chapter will further discuss the formalization process of businesses in Ghana; 

some international experiences with focus on Brazil, the chapter will end with an Indian 

positive impact of a tax reform for small businesses. 

 

2.1: Structure and Dynamics of the SMES in Ghana and Government Policies 

SMEs in most developing countries accounts for a greater share of employments. It 

has also been accepted by many economies that SMEs are important pillars of economic 

growth and development because they encourage entrepreneurship, generate employments 

and reduce poverty.  

But in capitalist economies, industrialization and development process depends 

heavily on the ability to accumulate capital, finance and technological development, 

centralization of financial capital, and the large-scale production, range of domestic and 

international markets, which are promoted mainly by large companies. Thus, rhythm, 

dynamic and diverse conditions that define the performance space of micro and small 

enterprises are determined by the dynamics of big businesses. The expansion of more 

modern and organized micro and small businesses, therefore, depends on their links with 

the large and medium enterprise - national and international - generally showing a 

relationship of subordination: as a subcontractor; producer of raw materials; supplier of 

parts, parts and components; service provider; distributors of the products produced by 

large companies; dependent on the dynamics of income and employment created by 

medium and large scale enterprises to expand their markets and sales of products and 

services to household (Santos, 2013). 

Therefore, to support small businesses, it is necessary that the country has a 

dynamic of growth driven by medium and large company, with the government supporting 

the productive, technological, financial (credit) development, research, exports of large and 

medium-sized enterprise as a form of open space, expand markets for micro and small 

enterprises (Santos 2013).  Changes in these directions can help to increase exports at 

global scale and so on, its means that it is so much important that the developmental 



 
 

30 

 

policies of the country should create conditions to promote national medium and big 

enterprises who can bring about industrialization.  At the same time, public policies need to 

support micro and small businesses so that they reduce their organizational and competitive 

disadvantages: reducing bureaucracy; developed support for the qualification of 

entrepreneurs and managers programs; favored offering online credits, low interest and 

solving the problems associated with collateral requirements; offering a favored and easy to 

perform tax regime; stimulating exports and organizational and technological development; 

facilitating the access of SMEs to government procurement; among other important policies 

that are clearly seen in many countries, including developing and average per capita income 

countries, such as Brazil (Santos 2013). 

 In order to discuss the various policies that government has put in place to help the 

SMEs, there is the need to actually understand its characteristics and the structure in the 

Ghanaian context. The following is the detailed discussion of SMEs.  

The SMEs in Ghana is defined by the National Board for Small Scale Industries as, 

enterprises that employs not more than 29 workers, with investment in plant and machinery 

(excluding land and Buildings) not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000. 

The Venture Capital  Trust Fund Act (Act 680, 2004) in section 28 has also defined 

the SMEs as an industry , project, undertaking or economic activity which employs not 

more than 100 persons and whose total asset base, excluding land and Buildings does not 

exceed the cedi equivalent of US$1million in value. Another important sector in the 

Ghanaian economy is the Ghana Statistical Service, which has also defined the SMEs as 

firms which employs between 5 and 29 employees and with fixed assets not exceeding 

US$100,000 as small scale and those employing between 30 and 99 employees as medium 

scale.  

From the above definition of the sector, it shows that there are two ways in which 

the SMEs can be identified, either by the number of employees or the total value of the 

firms fixed assets. Since there can be challenges regarding the use of the fixed asset values 

in the area of uniform valuation, Ghana in practice uses the number of employees to define 

and identify its SMEs (Boon, 1989).  

In Ghana, SMEs are heterogeneous in nature; they operate from small workshops 

making furniture, metal fabrications and dress making to medium sized manufacturing of 

machinery as well as service providers in restaurants, consultancy and computer or ICT 



 
 

31 

 

firms.  Some enterprises within the SMEs are operated for survival of families and so does 

not poses growth potentials whiles some are also highly growth oriented in their operations. 

The SMEs can also be considered as urban or rural enterprises, the urban enterprises 

can further be subdivided into organized and unorganized enterprises. The organized 

enterprises tends to have employees with a registered office and mostly solely owned  by an 

individual (self-employed) with small employees, whiles the unorganized enterprises are 

mostly made up of artisans who work in open spaces, operate in temporal  structures or at 

the residences of the owners and also employ very small or no salaried workers. They 

mostly use family members or apprentices in their work. The rural enterprises on the other 

hand, are mainly family groups, very small and operate mainly for survival, they are 

engaged in individual artisans, women in food processing, soap making and detergents, 

fabrics, clothing (Batik tie and dye), tailoring textile and leather works, blacksmiths, timber 

and small scale mining etc. (Kayanula and Quartey, 2000). Majority of SME entrepreneurs 

and workers have very low education background and other necessary training that are very 

important in their business. Because of the self-employment nature of the sector, the 

concept of separation in accounting does not hold, many uses their personal account as 

business account, which possess several problems for them. 

The contribution of the SMEs to the Ghanaian economy cannot be overlooked; 

many governments’ programmes have regarded the SMEs as the engine of growth of the 

economy, seeing the sector as possessing Ghana’s transformation key (Ayimah-Ackah, 

2006).  It is for this reason that the government must assist the sector to grow by 

implementing policies that seeks to concentrate on growing the sector to take advantage of 

the potentials they are made off. 

SMEs in Ghana are estimated to account for about 93%t of all registered businesses 

in the country, playing very important role by offering employment opportunities, opening 

of new businesses, enhancing entrepreneurship and fostering creativity among many other 

things. They are said to constitute about 85% of all manufacturing employments in the 

country and also contribute 70% of GDP.
10

  In terms of developments, the SME sector is 

recognized as the engine through which the growth objectives of many developing 

countries rest (Kayanula and Quartey, 2000).  They provide the potential source of

employment and income for many people.  This sector apart from job creation, many of 

them also pay taxes, brings innovations as well as leading the global trade of many 

economies including Ghana. 

 

According to the 2003 National Industrial Census, SMEs in Ghana constitute the 

greater percent of all businesses (96%), out of total firm units of 26,493. The Medium and 

Large firms share the rest by 2.9% and 1.1% respectively. In terms of employment 

generation, SMEs employs 47.6% of all employees, in the country (see table 7 below)

SMEs in Ghana face a lot of challenges in their businesses. Majority of SMEs 

entrepreneurs lack the requisite knowledge and training in managing their businesses 

(Baah, 2006). Although there are institutions providing training and advisory services for 

these SMEs, many have not taking advantage of the opportunities. In view of the fact that 

many SMEs are self-employed or owner managed businesses, they do not see the need to 

employ the services of qualified managers to help them due to the perceived high cost 

involve. Those who posses some level of skills also do not adopt the right attitude in their 

work, by not putting in their maximum effort towards the growth of their businesses. 



 
 

33 

 

Many SMEs are not able to compete with the foreign products in the Ghanaian 

market. The reliance of foreign products to the neglect of the local produced once has put a 

lot of pressure on the efficiency, prices, consumer satisfaction as well as quality of the local 

product. This situation has created low share of SMEs in the Ghanaian market.  The trade 

liberalization adopted as part of the Structural Adjustment Programme has also contributed 

to this trend.  

The growing technological advancement in the business environment has become a 

hug challenge for small businesses in Ghana (Duan et al, 2002). The inability of SMEs to 

learn and use technology in their line of business has eroded them from benefiting from it. 

With the changes in technology, many SMEs appear to be unfamiliar with new 

technologies even if they have the skill. However, those who have acquired the knowledge 

in ICT are reaping the benefit of their investments. 

The issues of bureaucracies and high cost of starting businesses in Ghana is a major 

challenge for SMEs. They see the registration process as burdensome to undertake all in the 

name of regulations, these has impeded grow of many business and has also left some in 

the informal sector. The high cost and legalities in clearing goods especially raw materials 

from the port are also a big problem. There is the need for government to address these 

issues that have the possibility of retarding the growth of many SMEs. If government or 

policy makers will take steps to reduce the high cost associated with registration and 

obtaining regulation and legal assistance for small businesses in the country, it will go a 

long way to encourage formalization of many informal businesses.  

On the heart of the many challenges faced by SMEs in Ghana is the issue of access 

to credit and financing mechanisms. Access to credit in the area of working capital and raw 

materials is a huge problem creating a lot of bottlenecks in the growth of many small 

businesses. They have very limited access in obtaining credit from the capital market either 

locally or internationally, largely because of the perception of high risk in the SMEs 

business. Other areas have to do with management weakness, barriers to information and 

high cost of intermediation for small firms. One other important element in this issue of 

finance is the lack of adequate collateral to secure loans from the banks. Banks always 

demand for collateral in place of the risk that surrounds the small business operations so 

that they can recover their monies in case of default.  



 
 

34 

 

According to Cuevas et al (1993, p.24), the lack of clear title to much useable land 

in Ghana, has posse limited amount of real property that can be put up as collateral. Since 

many of the lands in Ghana are stool or family lands, usage of it as collateral for advance 

from financial institutions is restricted. Delays by authorities in finalizing mortgages, where 

titles are available with regards to regulations also impede access to loans. This situations 

only leave the entrepreneur to rely on family, friends or to the informal financial markets 

that offer very expensive advances in terms of interest rate. 

The lack of expansion by many private sector firms in Ghana is mainly attributable 

to this challenge of finance and access to credit. It is for this reason that the government 

need to come to their aid to help small businesses to raise the necessary funding for 

anticipated expansion or growth. 

In the quest for the support of SMEs in Ghana, the government in 1981 passed the 

law to establish a Board to look at the promotion of this sector in its expansion and growth 

potentials.
11

 The need for greater contribution to employment creation and development of 

the economy was identified in the Ghanaian MSMEs at the time and it’s still considered 

important. The Act 434 (Act 1981) became operationalized in 1985 with the establishment 

of National Board for Small Scale Industries as the apex body to coordinate the activities of 

the MSMEs in the country as has been said earlier. The coming into being of the NBSSI 

merged there then, Ghanaian Enterprises Development Commission (GEDC) and the 

Cottage Industries Division of the Department of Rural Housing and Cottage Industries, 

this merges was to have a single body responsible for the development of MSMEs in the 

country. 

The NBSSI was mandated to look at two broad needs of the sector, the Financial 

and the Non-financial needs. The Financial services included extending credit through its 

loan schemes to entrepreneurs for both working capital and the acquisition of fixed assets. 

The interest rates of these loans were to be lower than that of the open market (Banks) with 

flexible repayment periods of monthly installments. Due to the fact that small-scale 

entrepreneurs do not have collateral as security for loans from the financial market, 

accessing the loans from the board only requires a personal guarantee.

The board functions on the following areas to help the development of MSMEs in 

Ghana: 

? “Facilitation of access to enabling environment through the provision of 

relevant market information, providing explanation on government policies and procedures 

and help the entrepreneur fulfill all regulatory requirements, information on incentives and 

investment opportunities available to the entrepreneurs. Last but not the least in this 

category is to assist entrepreneurs to exhibit the products at both local and international 

fairs by acquiring space for them”. This will help to strengthen the information that they 

need to know in order to make the right choices regarding their growth and expansion. 

? “Facilitating access to credit through the provision of advice and direction to 

entrepreneurs, assisting entrepreneurs to locate sources of funding and working with them 

on their applications. Another way is helping the entrepreneurs to streamline their 

accounting and business records and ensuring credit delivery and recovery”. Access to 

credit is a very major need of the MSMEs; this will enable them to expand their business 

because they do not have a very high capital outlay to operate without credit. 

? “Training and counseling, training of entrepreneurs in the sector is very 

important, the board provide training in the area of: management development skills, 

marketing practices, information on local and foreign markets, choice of equipment, 

business plan preparation, assist in feasibility studies, problem solving techniques and help 

entrepreneurs to identify their strength and weakness in their field of business”. Due to the 

low level of education by most of the entrepreneurs, these trainings are designed to equip 

them to function properly and also make them ready to compete with the outside world. 

? “Support for business associations, in Ghana there are many business owners 

who come together to form associations to help assist each other. The board has programs 

to support these associations to achieve their aims in the areas of: promoting and strengthen 

their business, offer training to their executives and strengthen their operational capabilities 

as well as helping the associations to determine their goals and objectives”.  In Ghana the 

phenomenon of groups and associations are very common, so reaching them will help the 

board to cover a large number of people at a time. 

The board also has specific programs for the rural dwellers by name the Rural 

Enterprises Project. The NBSSI through its district offices in the rural areas offer assistance 

to enterprises in these areas by: given entrepreneurs literacy and numeracy training, 



 
 

36 

 

business orientation seminars, community based training to impart basic level skills in 

simple activities like soap making, mushroom growing, etc. Another area is assisting in 

small business management training and counseling.  Finally in an attempt to link rural 

enterprise to their urban counterpart, the board offers them marketing support that will 

equip them to compete favorably in any market they find themselves.  

The board has revived its credit scheme aiming at supporting SMEs who have 

registered with the Registrar General’s Department (RGD), Credit Unions and the NBSSI 

itself with an amount of 10 million Ghana Cedis from the Export Trading, Agriculture and 

Industrial Development Fund (EDAIF). The support is also to encourage agro-processing 

enterprises that have export potentials. 

 

2.2 Formalizing the Informal Sector and SMEs  

The issue of formalization is always at the heart of discussions of the informal 

sector, which has been very difficult to achieve by many developing countries. Chen, M.A. 

(2007), has put it that it is not clear what is meant by “formalization”, thus in order to 

address the issue, there is the need for clearer understanding of what is formalization.  

Nelson and De Bruijn (2005, p.579), has defined formalization to mean “graduating 

from the informal sector to the formal sector, either directly or via semi-formal status”, 

indeed, not all informal enterprises can be graduated into the formal but, those with the 

potential and the capacity for growth.   

Some policymakers in the world over views the subject of formalization as a means 

of informal sector enterprises or entrepreneurs, getting or obtaining license, registering their 

businesses and paying taxes. But the question is asked about the benefit the businesses will 

obtain when formalized.  There is a comprehensive approach to the issue of formalizing the 

informal sector which affects both the informal enterprises and the informal jobs (WIEGO, 

2012).

 It must be noted that the focus of this thesis in on the informal enterprises which operate as a modern 

capitalist, because this section of operatives makes profits which needs to be assessed for taxes to be paid.

Every firm or business would like to operate formally and not be classified as 

informal which connote something of less value. The issues as I posed earlier is that what 

benefit is derived when moving from informal business or firm to formal? I however, agree 

to the fact that formalization has different dimensions beyond just registering and paying 

taxes (WIEGO, 2012). Box (1) above has outlined the benefits informal sector enterprises 

seek in the area of receiving legal and social protection enjoyed by the formal firms and 

formal workers. The various tax holidays and tax incentive packages
13

 being enjoyed by the 

formal firms or businesses can be a very important encouragement for enterprises operating 

informally to think of moves towards formal operations. The other issue is allowing them to 

organize and to have representative voice in rule-setting and policy making processes and 

more. 

In fact, these dissertation agree to those who have come out to state that 

formalization is not a one-step process, but rather an on-going process of extending benefits 

of formalization incrementally to the informal sector, this should be greatly be recognized 

by policy-makers on various dimensions. 

According to, Wedderburn et. al, (p.11), in a paper captioned “The informal 

economy in Jamaica: Is it feasible to tax this sector? “The following outlined points are 

ways of ensuring that the informal sector in Jamaica operates formally in order to 

contribute significantly to the official recorded economic growth. The paper underscores 

the fact that: 

 

1) “Business registrations be simplified 

2) Improvement of social programs 

3) Equity in the tax system 

4) Confidence in the tax administration” 

 

Would encourage moves towards formalization. In this sense, is also important to 

add that simplifying the tax system by making it easy for businesses and individuals to 

access can be more important to encourage formalization than reduction in the tax. The 

example of the Brazilian experience below can be considered. 

                                                           
13

 Sections 10 and 11 of the internal revenue act, Act 592 as amended has provided a number of these 

exemptions and industrial concessions for business but can only be enjoyed if you operate formally. 



 
 

39 

 

To further appreciate the need for a greater reduction in informal activities in most 

developing countries, Uganda in a research has alluded to the fact that when informal sector 

is formalized, the country’s chances of expanding employment opportunities, increase 

government tax revenue as well as raising income of participant in the economy is very 

high (Muwonge et.el,2007 p.28). Formalization of informal enterprises tend to be cost to 

the entrepreneurs, they see the fact that they have to be licensed, register their accounts and 

also to pay taxes (or social contribution) as not a benefit but a cost (Chen, 2005).  

The informal entrepreneur is interested in the benefit that is accrued to him or her 

for moving from informal to operating formally, they look forward to receiving such 

benefit as: enforceable commercial contracts; legal ownership of their place of businesses 

and means of production; tax breaks and incentive packages to increase their 

competitiveness; membership in trade associations; and statutory social protections, access 

to government contracts. The informal wage workers also seek converting their current 

employment status into formal jobs; obtain new formal jobs; have a secured employment 

contracts, worker benefits and social protection as the benefit of formalization (Chen, 

2005). In order to ensure that formalization is achieved, the benefits should be made clear 

to the operatives in the informal sector by so doing the will be willing to voluntarily 

formalized their businesses. The bottom line is for both informal self-employed persons and 

informal wage workers to see a reduction in the cost or the challenge of working informal 

to increasing the benefit associated with operating formally. 

Finally, Chen, 2005, p.90-91, makes three important conclusions to the 

formalization debate apart from the issues of cost reduction and increased benefit to the 

informal enterprises and workers. To her in as much as there are campaigns for 

formalization of all enterprises and workers in the sector there are also constraints that will 

impede the process, these constraints are; 1) ´´bureaucracies would not be able to handle 

the volume of license applications and tax forms to be processed by the authorities, `` thus, 

informal entrepreneurs would not be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting before they 

commence their businesses. 2) ´´Most bureaucracies would claim they cannot afford to 

offer informal businesses the incentives and benefits that formal businesses receive``, thus, 

authorities are looking at the increasing cost of benefits to formal businesses. And 3) ´´there 

are not enough jobs to absorb the growth in employment``, meaning formal job seekers are 

much more than available job vacancies.

In Ghana businesses are expected to first of all register with the local authorities
14

 to 

enable them obtain a license or permits to operate. The licenses are issued for specific trade 

or services and so the cost is lower and it’s a little simpler in processing. The revenues 

generated from this registration is used for rural and community development. The second 

stage of the process is to register a unique business name with the Registrar Generals’ 

Department (RGD)
15

 which will issue the certificate to commence business as well as the 

certificate of incorporation (in the case of Limited liability Company). As part of efforts to 

encourage formalization in the country, government has established institutions to offer 

technical and financial support to the informal entrepreneurs (Self-employed). Some of the 

institutions are: 

  

? National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI) 

? National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) 

? Micro Finance and Small Loans Center (MASLOC) 

? Venture Capital Fund (VCF) 

? Ghana Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) 

In order for these informal enterprises to access the various support and assistance 

available to them, they are first of all required to register with the Registrar General´s 

Department to obtain all the necessary certificates or to obtain business operating permit 

from the local authorities. And also they are required to register with the Ghana Revenue 

Authority with the issuance of their taxpayer identification numbers, file their tax returns 

and ensure that they meet their tax obligation (if any). Aside the above, self-employed 

businesses who have registered with the revenue authority are entitled to various tax reliefs 

at the end of the year after filing their tax returns. The Section 39 (1) of the Internal 

Revenue Act, 2000, Act 592 as amended states that, ´´the assessable income of an 

individual for a year of assessment shall be reduced by the following tax reliefs``. The 

current tax reliefs available to individuals can be observed in the table 8.

 In Ghana these local authorities are known as the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies. 
15

 The RGD is the organization in charge of registration of all nature in Ghana; businesses, properties etc...

The major constraints in this registration process are the cost and the procedure 

involved, this situation has been confirmed by the World Bank Doing Business report for 

2013
16

, where Ghana is ranked 64 as an economy that has not created conducive regulatory 

environment for doing business. In the area of starting business, Ghana is ranked 128 in 

2013 from 111 in the previous report, which means the country is making reforms that are 

difficult for people to register and do business, this create incentive for people to operate 

informally. Again, from the same report, Ghana is ranked 7 out of 10 score in its 

procedures involved in registering business in the country, which also indicate difficult 

bureaucratic procedure for businesses. 

Even though, various support and assistance initiatives have been provided, the 

difficulties the informal sector operatives go through to formalize is discouraging them to 

do so, hence, their continuing stay in the informal sector.

2.3  The International Experience 

In order to learn some lessons from what other countries have done in the area of 

formalization of businesses that has reduced informality, the Brazilian experience is 

considered below as well as that of Liberia and India. 

During the Lula government, the system for encouraging small and micro 

businesses to formalize was further extended to a larger set of segments, with its 

replacement by Simples Nacional, also known as Super Simple. According to Leone 

(2010),  

In an attempt to increase the creation of formal employment and reduce business costs 

the Federal government implemented the Simple (Law of Micro and Small 

Enterprises), approved by Law No. 9,317 of 05.12.1996 , which provides a special 

regime for small companies with sales of up to 36 thousand dollars a year. The single 

was abolished on 1
st
  July, 2007 and replaced by the National Singles and Super 

simples laying down general rules on the differential tax treatment to be accorded to 

microenterprises and small businesses within the Union, States, Federal District and 

Municipalities upon single system of collection, including ancillary obligations  

(http://www.portaltributario.com.br accessed 26/06/2010).  

Despite the Simple System contributing to the formalization of small businesses and 

their employees, their rules mainly benefit small businesses with a better degree of 

organization. So, to reach small businesses with lower level of organization,  usually  

individual entrepreneurs with help from family work - with a small number of employees - 

the Brazilian government created in 2008, the Law of Micro Entrepreneur Individual (MEI) 

(Santos 2012). 

In Brazil, very small businesses are formalized through registration as either 

Individual Micro-Entrepreneur (MEI - Microempreendedor Individual).
17

 MEI allows the 

operatives to formalize their status, equally and also allows them to obtain a National 

Registration of Legal Entities [CNPJ – Cadastro National de Pessoa Juridical] and pension 

coverage. However, to become an Individual Entrepreneur, it is necessary to raise a 

maximum turnover of R$60,000 per annum. By law the individual cannot participate in

another company as a partner, director or holder, nor have more than a single employee
18

. 

Registration of these businesses is free and it is done on the internet, also some accounting 

firms undertake the registration for the entrepreneurs with no cost. Registration offers the 

individual entrepreneur access to open a bank account, access to bank loans and invoice 

issuance
19

. Entrepreneurs in more than 400 activities can join MEI, and they can also be 

employed in another firm (SEBRAE, 2011). The micro businesses shall be exempt from 

federal taxes (Income tax, and other charges and social contribution on the payroll). One 

only pay a fixed monthly amount of R$34.10 (Trade or Industry), R$38.90 (services-

related) or R$39.90 (trade and Services), which will be allocated to social security and to 

ICMS (a kind of VAT) or to ISS (tax on service sector). The amount is annually updated in 

accordance with the minimum wage. Paying this monthly amount, the entrepreneur enjoys 

social security benefits including maternity-leave, sick-leave, retirement, among others.  

After registration, the following charges are paid: 5% of the minimum wage as 

social security; R$1.00 to the state if business activity is Commercial or industrial and 

R$5.00 for the municipality if business activity is service related
20

. Since its launch in 

January 2009, about four million businesses have been formalized by these new policies. 

The impacts of the MEI were very positive on formalization, as highlighted by Santos 

(2012),  

... At least informal units associated with lack of social security contributions, CNPJ, 

permits and other forms of legal recognition and licensing ... made substantial progress 

with the progressive advance of the registration of entrepreneurs and self-employed in 

MEI.  … Participation in MEI is only possible with the hiring of at most one employee. 

However, not only by the possibility of formalizing employers with a single employee, 

but also by the fact that these perspectives opened by formalizing stimulated by MEI 

will take many entrepreneurs to join in future the Super simples and thus placing 

                                                           
18 According to Santos (2012), when fit on the Super Simple, "your employee becomes entitled to pension 

benefits, eg, retirement, unemployment insurance, aid for accidents or sickness, maternity leave. All other 

labor rights of the employee are also held for the regime of MEI.  
19

 Along with a wide-ranging set of benefits for entrepreneurs formalized by MEI, according to Santos (2012) 

this program has also "facilitated access to the banking system and differential credit, issuing invoices, 

participate in government procurement and bidding consortia, have formalized an employee with a yield of 1 

MW or wage ', besides having a procurement employee at a lower cost (only 3% of social security 

contributions on wages). The registration also entitles you to receive provisional operating license for 180 

days, simplified accounting procedures, participation in consortia specific for carrying out joint procurement 

purposes. Besides, the EI has access to a streamlined electronic system for issuing guides ever with payment 

values calculated by the system (Santos, 2012). 
20

 The entire amounts stated are paid monthly and the payment is via the internet by the 20
th

 of each month.  



 
 

44 

 

themselves in a situation of full potential employer, the impacts of the broad process of 

registration in the MEI already contributes and, over time, will further contribute to the 

formalization of the informal group of employers, i.e., to reduce informality not only in 

the universe of own account workers, but also  for employers.” 

 Formalization has reached many businesses with fixed premises, as well as those 

without fixed location or category, such as street vendors: Santos (2012) shows that "quite 

surprisingly, the total subscribers in MEI, most IEs develop their activities in fixed 

establishments, that proportion reaches 56.4% for the whole country. This indicates that the 

MEI is serving as a way to formalize proportionally more small businesses who are already 

established (and probably in better condition) in less developed regions, in areas where the 

size of establishments, sales and the level of organization and productivity seem to be in 

need of further support of public policies for their formalization (SANTOS, 2011). The 

formalization of IEs developing activities without fixed location or property (street, door to 

door etc...) appears as the second most important activity in this process of formalization by 

MEI, reaching 21% of total EIs formalized throughout the country." 

From the above description on how businesses are formalized in Brazil, it shows 

that, there is no cost involve and the process is also less bureaucratic with the use of 

internet, providing an incentive for once informal businesses to become formal as well as 

providing a future through the benefit of social security after one’s active working age.  

In Liberia, greater number of the informal sector enterprises have the desire to be 

formalized in order to avoid the many payment of unofficial money’s they pay to 

authorities illegally, yet there are a lot of bottleneck to be addressed. Unlike many 

developing countries, where formalization of informal sector is being enforced, in Liberia 

governments are reluctant in enforcing the need for formalization of the sector, because it 

sees the sector as an employment incentive in the countries post war era. And also believe 

that interfering with the informal sector will derail the peaceful environment the country 

finds itself now.
21

 Aside the fact that the government is not enforcing the issue of

 This was contained in a policy briefing by Alfred K. Tarway-Twalla (Factors Influencing Contribution of 

Informal Business to Private Sector Development in Liberia.

formalization, in a related survey
22

  the informal operatives in Liberia expressed their 

willingness to voluntarily formalize their businesses if the following issues are addressed: 

 

I. Lack of Information on how to Formalize their businesses 

II. Burdensome procedures to formalization - the informal sector operatives who have 

made various attempt at formalizing by registering with the authority complain of 

burdensome procedures as well as it been expensive for them and however, does not 

encourage them to complete the process. 

III. The issue of high income tax payment, high compliance cost and social 

contributions associated with the formal sector, that they avoid also serves as 

motivation for them to remain informal. 

The Liberian situation is a very unique one in the sense that, this is post war 

economy that lost a lot of its formal working life and is now building it. Hence, the 

government reason for not interfering with the peace by enforcing programs on the 

informal sector is legitimate. According to the world Bank 2013 doing business report, the 

country is ranked 38 out of 185 countries in the area of starting business, also it has the 

highest ranking among the ECOWAS countries. 

In India (Bihar), they undertook a tax reform aiming at improving tax compliance of 

the Micro and Small businesses through simplification of tax laws and procedures to reduce 

compliance issues as well as to encourage small businesses to register as taxpayers
23

. 

According to an article on “Simplifying Tax Compliance for small firms, Improving 

Business Climate” the reforms has brought a lot of improvement in tax payment and has 

also widen the tax base with improved business climate. The following were some of the 

reforms undertaking: 

 

? “Adopting of several progressive measures by the use of fixed tax rate for micro and 

small enterprises with no or less routine scrutiny. 

? Improving online filing of tax returns for larger enterprises

? Simplified admission of appeals 

? Faster resolutions and payment of refunds to taxpayers” 

 The reform project at the end of the period from 2009 to 2013 produced the following 

results: 

? “It recorded 24% increase in the taxpayer base 

? Increased the number of tax payers filing their returns online through the e-returns 

from 149 in 2009 to 22,000 which has brought improvement of about 93% of tax 

revenues collected electronically. 

? Last but not the least; it has also recoded increase of registration of small tax payers 

to 6,800”  

Finally, to the small enterprises the reforms has lessen the burden in tax compliance 

and the ease of doing business has also improved. 

 

In concluding for this chapter, we can understand that although the dualism and the 

pluralism of markets or business are important in an economy, efforts needs to be made to 

reduce informality in economies with high percentage of the informal sector. Looking at the 

importance of Small and Micro businesses in the employment structure of the country, 

there is the need for government to come out with concrete polices that will help the 

transition of small businesses into medium and large ones that will have the potential of 

growth and also change the labour market structure from high informal to a more formal 

and job creation oriented one. Also of great importance is the need for expansion of market 

for small businesses that can lead to the promotion of national medium and big enterprises 

with the potential of bringing about the intended anticipation of industrialization. The major 

challenge of these SMEs is the access to credit and finance for expansion, which needs to 

be handled with all seriousness. This challenge has contributed to the high rate of 

informality in the country. Although, the NBSSI is to provide assistance to SMEs in the 

area of finance, the processes that this assistance is accessed are cumbersome and 

discouraging. Efforts needs to be made to re-organize these processes to ensure that the 

goals of the board is achieved to enhance the growth of SMEs in the country. 

In order for Ghana to experience reduction of its high informality, policymakers 

must consider that formalization is a gradual process and not a one-time activity, the need 



 
 

47 

 

for reduction in the bureaucratic procedures and increase incentives for registering 

businesses (i.e. the cost and ease of registration). There is also greater need for the 

identification of those firms or businesses within the informal sector/economy that can be 

formalized, because not all businesses within the sector can be formalized, as formalization 

of some informal sector businesses is just not justifiable or desirable and could create 

greater hardships to operatives. Both informal enterprises and informal workers will look 

out for certain benefits especially in the areas of social protection and formal job openings 

before taking a decision to formalize.  

The Brazilian experiences that have made a great impact with reduction in 

informality would have to be considered, by linking social benefits to the payment of taxes 

for small businesses that can result in reduced informality and increase tax revenue. 

Simplification of the tax structure in favour of small businesses as has been undertaking by 

India which has resulted in an increase in the taxpayer base and tax revenue can also be 

looked at seriously.

CHAPTER 3: STRUCTURE OF GHANA’S TAXATION, INFORMAL SECTOR 

TAXATION  

 

 

In order for the state to fulfill its obligation of providing the needed funds for social 

programs and infrastructure development, taxation revenue is what is required. Taxation is 

a distributive mechanism for redistributing incomes of the rich population to the poor 

(Abdullah, 2008, p.12).  We can agree that it’s a dual responsibility of both the state and the 

citizens that tax is raised as enough as possible. When state´s raise enough revenue from 

their own people, it gradually builds the capacity of achieving the fiscal social contract 

between them. Concentrating and collecting more taxes from the citizenry, will reduce the 

reliance on donor funding that comes with a lot of challenges to states, in a form of 

conditionality. Because governments would have to apply those donor funds to areas that 

the donors want, this may not be a priority of the state. 

Edgar and Sandler (2005) suggest five purpose for which a nation will impose taxes 

on its citizens, these purposes are: a) to give government power to allocate resources, b) to 

enable governments to provide or support social development, c) to stabilize the economy, 

d) to constitute and define the market place, e) to encourage optimal economic growth. The 

above purposes are important but it is necessary to consider the important role of tax 

revenue in reducing inequality and eradication of poverty, which will mean looking at the 

importance of a progressive tax system. 

In Ghana, the tax revenue to GDP has decline from an average of 20% between 

2004 and 2007, to 17.1% in 2012, of this figure, the self-employed tax which is mainly 

from the informal sector is less than 5 percent (ISODEC, 2009 and BoG, 2013). It has been 

noted that not all informal enterprises can be formalized and pay tax, because there are 

operatives who are generally not capable to do so. This issue is addressed by first looking at 

the various segments of taxpayers and the tax payment of the informal sector.  

This chapter is dedicated to look at the general tax structure and the various tax 

types in Ghana as well as a critical assessment of the systems available to tax the informal 

sector (self-employed) and their tax payment.  

In 2009, the government established the GRA as part of the various reforms of the 

tax administration of the country. The Ghana Revenue Authority Act 2009, (Act 791) was 

passed in December, 2009 to give legal backing to the Authority. This reform was aimed at 



 
 

50 

 

bringing all the revenue agencies of Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Valued Added Tax 

Service (VAT), the Custom Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) as well as the Revenue 

Agencies Governing Board (RAGB) under one umbrella to offer a one stop- shop service 

for taxpayers. 

This tax reform marks the possible end of decades of several attempt from 1986 

when the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and the Internal Revenue 

Service (IRS) was taken out of the civil service and made semi-autonomous self-accounting 

public sector institutions with separate boards, in the same year the National Revenue 

Secretariat (NRS) was also established to formulate policies, supervise and manage 

possible tax reforms. As a first step of reforms the Value Added Tax Service (VATS) was 

reintroduced in the country in 1998 after rejection of the tax and its eventual withdrawal in 

1995, the VAT was to administer the various consumption taxes under legal backing of 

VAT Act, 1998 (Act, 546) and accompanying Regulations 1998 (LI 1646) with the aim of 

widening the tax net.  

Again, the Revenue Agencies Governing Board (RAGB) was established in 1998, 

with the passage of RAGB Act, 1998 (Act 558) to abolish the individual boards of the 

CEPS, IRS and the VATS. In 2001 the RAGB started its work as the supervisor and the 

coordinator of the RAs. In order to enhance information interchange and risk profiling as 

part of the tax reforms of the country, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system 

was introduced in 2002 by the passage of Act 632. The RAGB in 2004, recommended for 

the establishment of the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) to operate on functional lines to pave 

way for the eventual integration of the Revenue Agencies (Ghana Revenue Authority). The 

RAGB saw the need to reform the tax administration further by proposing the 

establishment of the GRA to conform to best practice in the world. 

The government of Ghana in order to follow the modern trend of tax administration 

which focus on functional revenue administration that leads to improved customer delivery 

as an alternative to the old aged tax type administration. Many countries in the world 

including South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, and United Kingdom, just to mention a few have 

all adopted this new trend. The main reason for the establishment of the GRA includes: 1) 

to integrate the management of the Domestic tax and the Customs; 2) to modernize 

Domestic Tax and Customs operations through the review of processes and procedures; 3) 

to integrate IRS, VATS into Domestic Tax operations on functional lines.

The Ghana Revenue Authority has three divisions to enable it achieve its objectives. 

? The Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) consisting of IRS and VATS 

which is responsible for the administration of both Direct and Indirect taxes such as, 

Individual income tax, Corporate tax, Capital gains tax, Gift tax, Value Added tax, 

Communication Service tax as well as the National Health Insurance Levy. This division is 

in charge of collecting taxes from the Self-Employed including the Informal Sector. There 

is an office responsible for small taxpayers and field operations, where policies and 

programs to improve the tax collection of small businesses and the informal sector 

enterprises emanate from. It is a very important division because of it responsibility to 

expand the tax net to capture many of the informal sector enterprises in the country. 

? Custom Division which collect the taxes and perform the duties of the 

erstwhile Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS). Administer taxes and duties at 

the country´s entry points. 

? Support Services Division (SSD) which has brought together all the finance 

and the administration functions of the erstwhile Revenue Agencies together. 

The Ghana Revenue Authority seeks to achieve the following: “reduce 

administration and tax compliance cost; better service delivery; improved departmental 

information flow; holistic approach to domestic tax and customs administration; enhance 

revenue mobilization” 

Taxation plays a very key role in the economies of nations. It is the socio- economic 

bedrock of all nations. Without taxation nations cannot offer any meaningful social benefit 

to its citizens. Taxes are the “blood” that runs through the veins of nations. From an 

unpublished GRA training material, socio-economic benefit of taxation to a state and its 

citizens can be said to include the following. 

Tax revenue is the most important source of income to any nation or government. It 

is taxation that helps governments to offer social services and infrastructure to its people. 

Without taxation as its being said earlier, the quality of health services, basic education, 

roads, transportation, water etc., will suffer, leading to reduction in the level of confidence 

the citizenry have in their nation.  

Taxation also can be used as a tool for equitable distribution of the nation’s income 

to its people. Through the institution of a progressive tax system, the rich are made to 



 
 

52 

 

contribute more to the “taxation fund” than the poor. By so doing the government can 

distribute it for the benefit of all citizens. 

It is used as a tool to control inflation or deflation in a country. A spiraling 

inflationary situation may be curbed by increasing the incidence of taxation and thus 

absorbing the excess liquidity. A deflationary situation may be controlled by reducing the 

incidence of taxation and thereby increasing the volume of money in circulation. 

 Taxation may be used to foster growth of the key sectors of the economy. Under 

the current tax laws, for instance, in Ghana, manufacturing companies situated in the 

Regional capitals other than Accra and Tema enjoys a tax rebate of 25% while those 

located in non- regional capitals enjoy a tax rebate of 50%.  The law has also made a lot of 

tax holidays available to those who are in the Agriculture sector ranging from 5 to 10 years, 

depending on the nature of farming being undertaken.  Also, the Real estate Developers in 

Ghana enjoys a tax holiday of five years and Venture Capital firms are encouraged with a 

tax holiday of 5 years from paying Corporate Tax.  The above measure is to expand 

development to other areas of the country. The growth in the key sectors may result in 

increased employment and improved standard of living.  

Taxation is used as a tool to reduce the budget deficit and pay lesser amount of 

interest. An effective and efficient tax Administration may result in increase in tax revenue. 

This may have the effect of a reduced budgetary deficit which will lead to the reduction of 

government borrowing, amount of interest and increase the public spend in the social 

program, infrastructure, industrial and SMEs policies etc. 

For efficient tax administration, the tax authority (GRA) has grouped taxpayers into: 

a) Individuals who pay taxes on their profit or gains, which are called the self-employed 

taxes, (entrepreneurs either registered or not); b) Employees pay taxes on their wages and 

salaries which are referred to as Pay As You Earn (PAYE); c) Corporate Tax is also paid by 

registered legal entities on their profits; d) Partnership is also a legal entity, but tax payment 

is not paid in the name of the partnership business but from the individual partner’s share of 

profit. This also the way tax payments are recorded and reported statistically. 

Ghana’s taxation is backed by laws enacted by parliament, although there is 

integration of all the revenue agencies, the individual laws are still in use for the 

administration and collection of tax revenue now. Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act 592) as 

amended is the law that is used to administer direct taxes in Ghana; the law has three 



 
 

53 

 

categories of income on which taxes are levied in Ghana. These categories are i) income 

from Business; ii) income from an employment; iii) income from an investment.  

Section 7 of the Act defines income from business as: a) a person’s income from a 

business,  

as that person’s gains or profits from any business carried on for whatever period of 

time by that person; b) there shall be included in ascertaining the gains or profits from 

a business carried on by a person amounts accruing to or derived by that person that 

are attributable to the business and that would be included in calculating that person’s 

income from any investment 

Thus, any individual engaged in any business venture must declare his/her income to be 

taxed, which includes entrepreneurs in the urban informal sector. The tax rate differs from 

the type of business, the category (company or self-employed) and either resident or non-

resident.  

Section 8 (1) of the Act defines what the law means by income from employment as 

“that person’s gains or profits from that person’s employment”. Section 8, sub-section 2 

from “A-F” state various gains that comes to the hands of a person in employment, yet not 

tax as gains or profit to that person. Sub-section 2 state that “the gains or profit from an 

employment of a person include any allowances or benefits paid in cash or given in kind to, 

or on behalf of, that person from that employment”.  The tax on employment is by the use 

of the monthly graduated rate after all additions in the form benefits in cash or kind have 

been made and deductions in the form of personal reliefs have also been considered. 

However, in the case of an employee whose monthly earning is up to the minimum wage, 

the rate is charge at 0% with those earning is in excess of 5% of the minimum wage, pays a 

flat tax of 2.5% on the excess.  

Section 9, sub- sections 1&amp;amp;2 of the Act also define and give meaning to what the 

law regards as income from investment: 

“i) a person’s income from an investment is that person’s gains or profits from any 

investment”; ii) “the gains or profits of a person from investment include any dividends 

from a non-Resident company, interest, charge, annuity, royalties, rent, natural resource 

payment, or other income accruing to or derived by that person from the investment other 

than an amount included in ascertaining that person’s income from a business or 

employment”. 



 
 

54 

 

Tax rate on investment incomes is different for all the categories mention in ii) above, for 

instance, rent tax is charge at a rate of 8% of the total rent income and dividends from non-

resident companies are taxed at 10% of the total amount.   

In Ghana, the following are the important taxes administered by the Ghana Revenue 

Authority (GRA), and these are group under two broad categories which are Domestic and 

Custom duties or taxes. The Domestic Taxes are directly under the Domestic Tax Revenue 

Division (DTRD) and the Custom Division is also in charge of the collection of the custom 

and excise taxes. 

 

I) Income Taxes in Ghana 

Taxes on income and property in Ghana are generally derived from personal and 

corporate income taxes. The personal income tax is a progressive system that covers 

employees, sole proprietors and partnerships. These taxes are charge on the income of 

individuals and companies. The incidence of the tax is on the individuals or the companies 

earning the income. Some of the major taxes are briefly discussed: 

 

Corporate Tax 

These are taxes paid by companies on their profit in a particular year. The tax is 

charged after all outgoings and expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessary 

incurred in the production of the income are allowed to be deducted. The basis period of a 

company is the accounting year. However, the tax law allows companies to choose their 

own accounting year; the companies can only change with prior approval from the 

Commissioner General of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The current general rate for the 

company (corporate) tax is 25%. This rate is agreed on between the government and the tax 

authority after considering a lot of economic indicators and the performance of the 

economy. It does not have a single base on which the rate is determined.  

 

Personal Income Tax 

These are taxes levied on self-employed persons who are obliged to pay income tax 

on their profit or earnings at the end of the year after all outgoings and expenses which are 

wholly, exclusively and necessary are deducted. The basis period of the individual is the 



 
 

55 

 

accounting year (1
st
 January to 31

st
 December). Unlike the company tax, the self-employed 

businesses, excluding those in the informal sector are taxed using the graduated rate as in 

the table below. 

Table 9: Annual Tax Rate for Self-Employed Persons, 2013.

In this table, the chargeable income represents the annual income of a resident self-

employed (monthly in the case of an employee) at which the tax rate is multiplied with in 

order to get the tax for the individual. If that person’s chargeable income does not exceed 

GH¢1,584.00 (marginal threshold), the rate is free and therefore, no tax is paid. The more 

the chargeable income exceeds the marginal threshold, the higher the rate and the resultant 

tax to be paid.  The table 10 below which is for the calculation of monthly employees’ tax 

is the same.

Pay As You Earn (PAYE) 

PAYE is a method of withholding tax that employers withhold from the salaries and 

wages of their employees as contribution to the tax revenue of the country. These taxes are 

deducted using the graduated rate (Monthly). The law gives the employers on or before the 

15
th

 of the following month after the month of deduction to pay same to the GRA. The table 

above shows how the tax is deducted. Again as a way of lifting some of the social burdens 

from workers or individuals, Section 39 of the Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act, 592) as 

amended allows for the following personal upfront reliefs to be deducted from the salaries 

before tax is calculated.  These reliefs are: Old age relief, Aged dependent relief, Child 

education, Marriage/Responsibility and Disability relief. The tripartite committee has also 

made it a point that, employees who earn the monthly minimum wage or below do not pay 

taxes on their wages. With this policy in place, since most of the informal sector workers 

earn below the minimum wage, their wages are not taxed 

 

Other Domestic Taxes 

Other taxes that are administered by the DTRD are The Value Added Tax (VAT), 

National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL), and Communication Service Tax (CST).  The 

VAT is a form of consumption tax which is imposed on goods and services supplied or 

imported into the country. The incidence of the tax is on the consumers when they purchase 

goods or services rendered. Businesses are registered to collect the tax based on their 

turnover in the stages of value added, from the manufacturing to the retail stage. The 

current VAT rate is 12.5%. A special scheme of collecting the VAT known as the “VAT 

Flat Rate Scheme” has been designed for the traders operating in the retail sector. Retail 

operators are obliged to charge the VAT at a flat rate of 3% on all taxable goods (VAT, Act 

564).   



 
 

57 

 

Levy tax is imposed on goods and services at the rate of 2.5%. This levy take the 

same attribute of the Value Added Tax, so in Ghana, both are collected together at a single 

transaction. It was introduced to cushion and help sustain the National Health Insurance 

scheme in the country. The tax is imposed on the use of communication services by 

consumers. It is collected by the communication service providers and paid to the GRA at 

the end of every month.  

The CST was established by an act of parliament, Communication Service Tax, Act 

2008 (Act, 754). Section 5 of the act mandates government to use at least 20% of the 

revenues generated to finance the National Youth Employment Programs (CST Act, 754). 

Others include: i) Vehicle income tax, ii) Tax stamp, iii) Stamp Duty, iv) Capital Gains 

Tax, v) Gift Tax, vi) Rent Tax and vii) Mineral Royalties.  

 

II)  Custom Duties 

Excise duty is payable on all locally manufactured or produced goods, unless the 

goods are exempt from the duty. The duty is computed on the ex-factory prices of the 

goods produced. The ex-factory price of the product is the factory cost of production plus 

the manufacturer’s profit margin. Currently excise duty is levied on alcoholic and non-

alcoholic beverages as well as tobacco and petroleum products. The commissioner has the 

right to exempt some goods from taxed upon application from the manufactures. The duty 

is due and shall be paid by the manufacturer to the GRA before the goods are delivered 

from the factory or the warehouse. Unfortunately, there are no available figures to show the 

total excise duty contribution to GDP in Ghana, but according to Terpker, 2001, excise duty 

increased from 12.8% in 1993 to 15% of GDP in 1995 after the restructure of the tax in the 

1980s (p.3).  

International trade tax includes import and export duties on both traditional and 

non-traditional goods. Import duties are payable on almost all import into the country 

except those with specific exemptions such as agricultural inputs, personal effects, 

industrial machinery, solar cells and panels, thermal energy and electrical generating set of 

375 KVA and above, among other goods. Currently the general standard import duty is 

charged at the rate of 20%, but import of raw materials by manufacturing companies pay 

the duty at 10% of the total amount of the import (Abdullah, 2008). Export duty on the 



 
 

58 

 

other hand, is paid on goods exported from the country. The duty is currently levied on 

cocoa beans and Hydrocarbon oil, (e.g. Aviation turbo kerosene). Apart from this two 

goods, all other export are taxed at zero (0) percent (Ghana Revenue Authority web site).  

 

3.1 Taxing the Informal Sector 

There have been a lot of difficulties in taxing the informal sector by Tax 

Administrators in many developing countries. A report by Africa Tax Spotlight (ATS), it 

came out with three main benefits for taxing the informal sector, which are for government 

to raise enough revenues for the provision of more infrastructures. It will also help to 

advance the growth of the economy and if the informal sector operatives pay taxes, it will 

enhance political accountability as well as ensuring greater ways for engaging with the 

state. In many developing countries, taxation has been a burden on the shrinking formal 

sector whiles majority of the informal sector entrepreneurs continue to avoid the payment 

of income tax. 

Wedderburn et al. (p.2), in a paper captioned “The informal economy in Jamaica: Is 

It feasible to tax this sector” also gave out further reasons or benefits in taxing the informal 

sector in Jamaica. The benefit to them are that taxing with the appropriate tax system will 

improve tax revenues which can pay off the nation’s debt, economic growth as well as 

providing domestic programs that will go a long way to improve the lives of the citizens. 

Taxing the informal sector will also help in revealing the size of the sector that can expose 

the “deeper, more pervasive issues of corruption and bribery” 

The nonpayment of income tax by the informal sector undermines the linkage 

between citizens and the state (Green, 2013).  It has been revealed that taxing the informal 

sector increases the moral and also increases tax compliance from other sectors of the 

economy (Terpker, 2003, Ayee, 2007, p.2). Torgler 2003 also gives account of the fact that 

“evidence from Latin America shows that tax compliance in the formal sector is high in 

countries with small informal sector” (Ayee, 2007, p.2). Therefore, one can strongly 

foresee that taxing the informal sector also have positive compliance effects on other 

sectors such as the formal sector, thereby improving tax collection in the country as a 

whole.  

According to Ayee (2007), taxing the informal sector of Ghana as well as most 

developing countries comes with a number of reasons, enumerated as follows: “Revenue 



 
 

59 

 

needs, the phenomenal size and growth of informal sector, impact on tax compliance in the 

formal sector, State legitimacy, and demands from the informal sector as well as tax-

accountability link”. However, not all informal sector businesses can be taxed. 

Records available from the Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Statistical Service, reveal 

that the self-employed constitute the least taxpayers in the country in spite of it size. These 

self-employed businesses are mainly the urban informal sector operatives which constitute 

the largest business in Ghana. Although taxes from the informal sector (Self-employed) is 

very small, the size of the sector and the fact that there are some large operators within the 

sector makes it assuring that much tax revenue can be achieved. Ordonez (2010) was able 

to estimate that, if the Mexican informal sector is successfully taxed, it can lead to an 

increase of about 17% in total economic productivity.  

The major obstacle to income tax collection from the informal sector are the size of 

the sector which makes it difficult to be identified for proper tax enforcement and since the 

sector is largely self-employed, with cash transactions, there are no proper accounting 

records that will help authorities to determine their actual incomes to be taxed, thus, making 

the informal sector worst offenders of tax evasion (Terpker, 2013). In the Minister of 

Finance’s address to the managements of GRA, he admitted that the informal sector 

continues to be the “worst offenders of tax evasion in the country” and that the tax 

administrators should put in place measures to curb this situation. This to me makes the 

issue of tax evasion by the informal sector important and needs to be addressed by 

authorities immediately.  Otieku (1988) outlines the following as constituting tax evasion: 

“a) illiteracy on the part of some informal sector entrepreneurs, b) lack of voluntary 

compliance in the payment of their obligated taxes, c) domination of cash transactions, d) 

low standard of record keeping and e) inaccessibility to tax offices to pay their taxes”.  If 

adequate measures are put in place in addressing the issues above by policy makers, 

internal revenue generation can be increased.  

 I must acknowledge that it is not all informal sector operatives that have the right 

condition to pay tax, because some engage in informal activities as survival strategies and 

therefore taxing their meager incomes will bring a lot of hardships to them. There is also 

the need for the outlining of advantages or benefits in a form of social policies for the 

operators of small businesses and the informal sector as well as coming out with 



 
 

60 

 

appropriate punitive mechanisms to punish defaulters. These people to me need a lot of 

transfer programs from the state to help them survive and live better. 

 

3.1.2 Tax Payment and the Contribution of Informal Sector  

Taxpayers in Ghana are segmented according to their annual turnover (Large, 

Medium and Small) the following table provides the various turnover thresholds for each of 

the categories. 

Table 11: Taxpayer Segmentation- GRA 

TAXPAYERS TURNOVER THRESHOLD 

Large GH¢5million and above 

Medium GH¢90,000 and not exceeding 

GH5million 

Small Turnover below GH¢90,000 

Source: Ghana Revenue Authority. 

 

The informal sector is captured as part of the small taxpayers in Ghana. It is not all 

small businesses that are classified as informal, because there are other small businesses 

that has registered officially or has been formalized and that proportion are taxed using the 

graduated rate. As has been said earlier, the part of informal sector who cannot go through 

registration as well as to pay income taxes are those who sell petty items on tables and the 

floor ranging from food stuffs to very small household items, domestic workers, street 

vendors etc. any attempt to tax these people can impose hardship on them and their families 

because they lack the condition to do so. In that sense Brazil’s tax reforms MEI for small 

businesses can be considered. Their business activities are for their survival and not to 

accumulate profit. There are others who are in the informal sector whose earnings are very 

high and would have to pay more taxes. Some of this people are, for example, car dealers in 

our urban cities, food sellers, and textile sellers in our various market centers in the cities 

among others.   



 
 

61 

 

According to Yeboah 2012, the GRA has come out with the following statistics on 

the percentage size of businesses and their percentage tax contribution as contained in the 

table below. 

 

Table 12: Business Size and their Tax Contribution in Ghana 

BUSINESS PERCENTAGE SIZE PERCENTAGE TAX 

CONTRIBUTION 

Large Less than 1% 70% + 

Medium 5%-25% 10%-25% 

Small &amp;amp; Micro 70%-95% Less than 10% 

Source: Yeboah, 2012 

The table above shows that the small and micro size businesses that form the 

informal sector are the majority (70-95%) of the firms in the country yet contributes less 

than 10% of tax revenue. Comparing this to the large firms that forms less than 1% yet, 

contribute more than 70% of tax revenue. There is the need for proper segmentation of the 

small businesses in order to identify the vulnerable groups to be exempted from tax and 

advocate for government to offer them subsidies to let them improve on their livelihood. 

There is also the upper segment of the informal sector or the small businesses that need to 

be taxed more, thereby increasing the tax revenue of the informal sector.  

The Commissioner General of GRA, Mr. Blankson has said at the 2013 

Management Retreat that the informal sector contributes 5% of tax revenue in the country. 

According to him, “an estimated 1.5million Ghanaians pay direct taxes only five percent of 

this taxpaying population is in the informal sector”. This trend has been in the system for 

quite some time, a former Assistant Commissioner of the erstwhile Internal Revenue 

Service, Mrs. Amamoo in 2008 also came out with some interesting figures to buttress the 

point that the informal sector contribute very little to the tax revenue of the country. She 

said, out of the 266,760 self-employed registered by the Ghana Registrar General’s 

Department, only 53,352 have been registered with the tax authority, this leaves the rest of 



 
 

62 

 

the people in the informal sector. It thus calls for reforms to link business registration 

taxpayer registration to capture all businesses.  

 

 

Fig. 1  PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTION BY TAX TYPE 

 

Source: Data from GSS and BANK of GHANA. S/E= Self-Employed and TDT= Total Direct Tax 

 

The above figure represents the percentage contribution of all tax types in Ghana for 

2009 to 2012, September. As we can see whiles the other tax types increase their 

contribution to the direct tax revenue, same cannot be said for the Self-Employed (S/E). For 

instance, in 2009, the S/E contributed 4.24% of tax, this figure reduced in 2010 to 4.08%, 

the 2011 figures up to September recorded 3.55%, comparing the same period in 2012, the 

collection further declined to 2.90% with Personal Income Tax (PAYE) and Companies 

contributing 40.34% and 38.96% respectively, however, they contribute to VAT since that 

is a consumption tax. How can country develop meaningfully with a high informal sector 

that contributes very little to the tax wallet of the nation? This figure also shows that 

majority of the direct tax generated in the country comes from workers small salaries. 

Although there is no empirical evidence, some informal sector operatives earn incomes 

which are more than an average worker, yet are not paying tax.

3.1.3 Systems for Taxing the Informal Sector (Self-Employed) 

The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) from 1970, adopted several methods of 

collecting taxes from the informal sector, before the coming into force of the Internal 

Revenue Act (IRA 592, Act 2000) and Internal Revenue Regulation (IRR, 2001, LI 1675). 

The erstwhile IRS used a general system of presumptive flat tax, as means of taxing the 

informal sector, which ensured that businesses operating within the sector are tax based on 

Standard Assessment, which did not take into consideration the incomes earned by the 

business, but was based on the size of the business and the industry. This system was first 

introduced in the 1960s with all operators paying a lump sum of money as tax. The 

estimated amounts to be paid by the informal sector as tax liability are based on financial 

and economic surveys of firms, industries or sectors. Also the system is based on standard 

indicators such as sales, purchases, estimated profit margins, floor space and number of 

employees if any. The system brought about a lot of difficulties to both the tax authorities 

and the tax-paying community, although it initially brought a lot of gains (Amamoo, 2008). 

According to Joshi and Ayee (2002), there was an agitation of the system not been fair, due 

to the fact that lower and higher income earners were paying the same tax. That the 

informal sector did not comply with the tax they were supposed to pay. This prompted a 

need for reforms that will help the state to find a better way of taxing the sector, the 

occupational group tax system adopted. 

The revenue agency as part of addressing the poor implementation of the 

presumptive tax system brought about the idea of “agency role” of occupational groups or 

association. This measure was aim at widening the tax net to increase revenue generation 

from the informal sector. In 1987, occupational group or identifiable groups were given 

agency role by the IRS to collect taxes from their members on behalf of the commissioner 

after negations with their leadership, which was aimed at bringing into the tax net potential 

taxpayers within the various associations or groups. This was accepted because it was very 

easy to collect from their members that they already know. The system had gone through a 

lot of changes from daily collections initially through weekly collection to quarterly to 

reduce the high cost of printing of the receipts and monitoring by tax officials. 

According to Mrs. Lydia Amamoo (Deputy Commissioner, DTRD),  she revealed 

that “although the system chalked up some initial success, in the long run, it failed to make 



 
 

64 

 

the desired impact on self-employed collection”.  Some of the problems associated with the 

failure of the system were: 

1) “Failure to properly account for the taxes collected 
2) Falsification of receipts and other records 
3) Conflict in the associations 
4) Spring up of sprinter-groups in the associations 
5) Linking-up of membership fees and dues to payment of tax 
6) Imposition of unauthorized penalties by the associations for non-payment of the 

taxes 

7) Inadequate monitoring by the service” 
 

This called for further reforms that will be appropriate to achieve the objective of 

adequately taxing the informal sector. The coming into force of the Internal Revenue Act 

and the Internal Revenue Regulations of 2000 and 2001 respectively, brought into effect 

regulations 25 of LI 1675 with the list of associations, occupational groups and classes of 

persons forming the informal sector in the country for the purposes of taxation and new 

ways of taxing them.  

The following were the major reforms adopted to improve the tax revenue 

collection of the informal sector enterprises. The introduction of Vehicle Income Tax (VIT) 

is a way of capturing all commercial vehicle owners to pay their taxes on quarterly basis.  

This law was contained in the legislative instrument (LI. 1727), and schedule five of 

regulation 25A. The stickers are purchased from the offices of the IRS (now the STO 

offices of the GRA) which are to be conspicuously displayed on the windscreen of the 

vehicle; this will enable the police to effectively check defaulters. The stickers can be 

bought individually or by the transport unions.
24

 

The VIT that was introduced assisted in capturing all commercial vehicle owners on 

quarterly basis for tax purposes. The LI. 1727 came out with the following important issues 

as stated by Mrs. Amamoo (Deputy Commissioner, STO and Field operations): 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
24

 This was to encourage the unions and also 2.5% discount is given to them for bulk purchases of the sticker.

2) Stickers are to be displayed on the windscreens of all vehicles like the insurance 

and road worthiness Certificates. 

3) Specified rates are provided for various classes of commercial vehicle 

4) The VIT stickers system shall be enforced by the police and monitored by tax 

authority’s monitoring teams in collaboration with the police 

5) Taxpayers are required to file their tax returns at the end of each year since the 

payments for the VIT are not final but payment on account. 

6) The LI also provided punitive sanctions against those who fail to comply, 

ranging from a fine of not less than 25 penalty units and not more than 50 

penalty units to imprisonment of not less than two (2) months.

The rate of tax payable by the commercial vehicle owners are reviewed as and when 

necessary through negotiation between the tax authorities and the transport unions. One can 

confidently say that the introduction of the LI.1727 has improved the tax collection from 

self-employed commercial vehicle operators. The current amendment of the regulation in 

2011, LI 1997, has new figures as tax to be paid by the owners of these commercial 

vehicles as contained in the table below.

In 2005, the erstwhile IRS as a way of improving the contribution of tax by the 

informal sector (self-employed) other than the vehicle owners came out with LI. 1803 

regulation 25B captioned “Tax installments payable by specified self-employed persons” 

which introduced a new quarterly tax payment known as the “Tax Stamp” system. The 

system also deals with the identifiable groupings, because of the lack of effective book-

keeping that would have allowed for proper standard income taxation. By this system, 

informal sector operators are made to purchase a quarterly stamp that has to be displayed 

conspicuously in their premises, kiosk, and containers as well as to be carried around by 

hawkers. The tax stamp system has improved the tax revenue collection of the sector, yet 

much needs to be done. 

In addition, schedule six was introduced to cover those who are not covered by the 

schedule two of LI. 1675 as amended. The schedule six classes of traders and their 

quarterly tax rate are stated in the table below. The important issues contained in the LI 

1675 as amended are also stated in the box below.

3.1.4 Difficulties in Taxing the Informal Sector 

Taxing the informal sector is a very difficult task, operators within the sector 

generally transact business on cash bases making it problematic to assess their incomes and 

tax them appropriately. This form of transaction creates avenues for them to cover up their 

profit or incomes that are to be taxed. The following are three major difficulties that prevent 

proper taxation of the informal sector: i) capacity constraints; ii) the issue of equity; iii) 

political issue. 

The informal sector lacks the capacity to keep proper books of account or financial 

records for tax purposes, making it difficult for tax authorities to effectively assess them to 

tax. According to Ayee (2007), he state that “…in tax administration a very important task 

is the correct determination of income of the taxpayer so that a meaningful assessment of 

the tax liability could be made”. This constraint can be attributed to the level of illiteracy 

among operators in the sector. Tax administrators on the other hand, also lack the capacity 

to enforce the laws available to them to collect taxes from the citizenry in general and the 

informal sector in particular. Terpker (2006, p.27), thinks that accounting is necessary for 

enhancing tax compliance, meanwhile small businesses finds it difficult and expensive to 

maintain proper or adequate accounting records. In order to solve this problem that will go 

a long way to put an end to the indiscriminate application of cash accounting and also to 

reduce the system of presumptive tax rules applied to all small business, it is important for 

“policy makers or those in the accounting practice to design a simple cash and accrual 

accounting format that comes with less cost that the operatives within the informal sector 

can afford”. 

Income or profit from majority of the informal sector operatives is said to be low 

which are difficult to tax, some also receive a lot of income or profit that needs to be 

assessed for the right tax to be charged. In fact enough tax can be charged from this group 

to bring out the progressiveness of the direct tax system. However, the lack of effective 

financial records by operatives makes it difficult to target the high income earners to pay 

more tax in order to bring equity in the tax system to save the low income earners within 

the sector. The use of presumptive tax system to tax the informal sector, which are 

estimates imposed on operatives can be addressed if proper financial records are kept by 

business, that would help tax authorities to distinguish between who should pay more tax 

and who should not even pay the tax at all.  If accounting record is been kept by all 



 
 

70 

 

operatives, the presumption tax should be paid by the vulnerable small businesses (Terpker, 

2006). 

Judith Tendler (2002, p.3), terms the political influence in the taxation of the 

informal sector as the “Devils deal”, which is an unspoken arrangement between politicians 

and the informal operatives. Low income taxpayers within the sector are many, yet 

contribute very little to the tax revenue, hence have a strong political voice, Politicians also 

have the strong incentive to exempt them or willing to turn blind eye on the informal sector 

in exchange of political support or vote to maintain them in power. As long as the 

politicians depend largely on the vote of the citizenry to keep them in power, they greatly 

do everything humanly possible to attract the vote of the informal sector. 

The informal sector is a very important sector of the economy that needs a lot of 

attention from policy makers to ensure that the sector contribute more meaningfully and 

come out with programs to encourage formalization which will reduce the high informality 

the country is experiencing. I believe that for a sector that do not have the capacity to 

maintain accounting records which will enable tax administrators to give them proper 

assessment, the Tax Stamp and the Vehicle Income Tax (VIT) systems are the best way of 

taxing the sector. There is the need to separate the informal sector into those who have the 

conditions to pay more taxes and those who do not have the material and financial 

conditions to pay tax, they are just in the sector for survival and need government support, 

putting taxes on their incomes will create a lot of hardship for them.

4. FINAL CONSIDERATION 

 

Ghana’s tax system has a lot of difficulties which is affecting revenue mobilization 

in the country.  The Ghana Revenue Authority has to improve the tax system in order for 

the citizen to have confidence and contribute significantly in to the tax revenue coffers.  

The lack of resource in the form of human and logistics is one major constraint that 

has made tax administration very difficult.  For effective and efficient tax administration, 

there is the need for more skilled human resources to be able to ensure proper enforcement 

of the tax laws and undertake inspection of taxpayers. Frequent monitoring of taxpayers 

requires a well trained staff. The other issue is the lack of logistics like operational vehicles, 

offices, computers and many more.  The tax system in Ghana generally operates with more 

manual and paper work in this era of technological advancement.  

After so many years of the existence as administrators of direct tax systems in 

Ghana, the GRA has still not been able to automate all of its operations and continues to do 

paper work. This has also contributed immensely to the poor tax revenue generation as a 

country. Government needs to change these systems by resourcing the revenue agency to 

speed up the automation of the tax system. The Brazilian case has shown that automation 

and cash-less business environment is a sure way of increasing tax revenue. 

One other area that requires a lot of attention is taxpayer education by the revenue 

agency. Educating or training of taxpayers on some of the beneficiary provisions in the tax 

laws will encourage them to trust the system for voluntary tax compliance.  Some of the 

benefits are: tax incentives, tax concessions and tax reliefs and also interpretation of certain 

unclear portions of the tax laws to them will also go a long way to help. This will give the 

GRA the confidence to carry out any action against those who do not comply with tax laws 

and their obligation to pay tax. The business environment in Ghana is dominated by cash 

transactions which make it difficult to analyze incomes of many tax payers for fair and 

proper assessment; this situation has made the informal sector very hard to tax. This is an 

area that needs to be looked at seriously by the tax authorities; a simple training on income 

and expenditure can be given to the small business owners who cannot afford the high cost 

of engaging a professional accountant to help them to prepare simple financial records and 

account for tax purposes. 



 
 

72 

 

The reforms that are being implemented for informal sector enterprises and SMEs, 

can be considered the best within the circumstances we find ourselves in, especially the 

Vehicle income Tax and the Tax stamps, since majority of the operatives in the sector are 

illiterate or semi-illiterate and cannot keep accounting records on their business for tax 

collectors to properly assess them base on their incomes. What is therefore, required is a 

further segmentation of the turnover threshold for small businesses in order to identify 

those within the informal sector who earn more incomes and need to be taxed properly to 

pay more, those who can continue to pay the tax stamps and those whose businesses are on 

survival bases and do not have the condition to pay income taxes, but rather to receive 

government support in a form of cash transfers. 

The Act 592 of 2000 as amended was intended to bring about reforms to all aspects 

of the tax system in the country, but it seems the act is in favour of medium and large firms 

with very little mention of small, micro and informal sector businesses. Much needs to be 

done in the area of making tax reforms that will go a long way to encourage small 

businesses and the informal sector to think of moves to formalize which has the tendency of 

improving tax payment from the sector. The Brazilian experience, where tax payment for 

small businesses goes with some social benefits can be considered. 

The informal sector in Ghana continues to grow but statistical data and information 

on the sector is limited, especially in the area of assessing the actual size of the sector. The 

sector’s contribution to GDP and the actual contribution to tax revenue have not being 

adequately researched on to mention a few. Government should resource the Ghana 

Statistical Service and the Ghana Revenue Authority adequately to conduct in-depth 

research into the informal sector and it contribution to the GDP of this country. This will 

help tax administrators to come out with tax structure that will have greater consideration of 

small businesses and the informal sector. No meaningful reform can be done for small 

businesses and the informal sector, without a proper research of the sectors involved. 

Simplification of the tax system is very important, there seems to be a lot of 

burdensome procedures in the system that authorities need to work on. Section 72 of the 

IRA, 2000 (Act 592 as amended) enjoins “a person to furnish a return of income for the 

year of assessment of that person, not later than four months after the end of a basis period 

of that persons ending within the year”. Due to the voluminous nature of the forms, 

taxpayers always find it difficult in completing the forms which cannot also be accessed, 



 
 

73 

 

complete and submitted electronically. Taxpayers find it problematic to travel to the tax 

offices to complete this forms. Taxpayers are expected to always walk to the tax offices 

before they can even make payments. Policy makers must take steps to address this issue 

by, simplifying the processes and procedures for easy compliance, such as the return forms 

and also to provide the platform for electronic filing of the income tax returns and 

payments of taxes by the taxpaying population which will go a long way to help both the 

tax authorities and the taxpayers. 

Registration of business in Ghana is a very important tool in the issue of 

formalization that has the potential of tax revenue generation. There are cumbersome and 

bureaucratic procedures business owners have to go through to register; the cost associated 

with this business registration is also a problem. This also makes it difficult for small and 

informal businesses to convert to formal businesses. According to the World Bank data on 

“Doing Business”, Ghana is ranked 111 out of 189 countries in the area of starting a 

business in 2013. In 2014, on the same category, Ghana was ranked 128 out of 189 

countries. This record is very much discouraging and urgent steps are needed to address the 

issue which has the potential of reducing informality in the country.  

  In 2002, the parliament of Ghana through the TIN Act, 632 brought into force  “An 

act to establish a Taxpayer Identification Numbering (TIN) system under which taxpayers are given 

identification numbers for official transactions with the public institutions by or under the Act and 

to connected matters”. 

 If this act is well followed, it would give the GRA an opportunity to capture all taxpayers 

including the informal sector operatives who escape from paying tax, because this numbers 

are unique to all persons. Section 5(1) of the act state that: “every person, liable to pay tax 

or required to withhold tax at source” by law is supposed to obtain Tax Identification 

Number (TIN). I therefore, believe that a nationwide issuance of the TIN and also properly 

linking it to some sectors of the economy especially the Driver and Vehicle Licensing 

Authority, would help us to identify and bring into the tax net all taxable persons including 

our high informal entrepreneurs.  

Last but not the least, Ghana after fifty-seven (57) years of our independence cannot 

boost of a well street-naming system that would make it easier to locate persons, especially 

taxpayers within the informal sector. This failure is blamed on the Metropolitan, Municipal 



 
 

74 

 

and District Assemblies (MMDAs) on their inability to effectively provide layout and 

permit for buildings and house numbering (GoG, 2010). If the guidelines which was 

compiled by the Ministry of local Government and Rural Development, on street naming 

and property numbering system (street addressing system) could be followed, this would 

lead to roping into the tax net many persons who are doing business of which taxes need to 

be paid on their incomes, but yet cannot easily be traced or located. Many of our informal 

sector enterprises fall into this category of persons. This system in my opinion will have 

positive impact and also improve the “Rent Tax” collection, because of ease in locating 

properties.
