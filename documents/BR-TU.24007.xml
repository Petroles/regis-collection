Abstract  
This thesis presents the mesoscale characterization of the evolution of two lagoon systems, 

Traba (550 years of sedimentary sequence) and Melides (1745 years of sedimentary 

sequence), using sedimentological, geochemical and biological, particularly diatoms, 

indicators. Also, a characterization of 18 present-day transitional environments (coastal lakes 

and ponds, lagoons and estuaries) of the Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC) was 

performed, based on the diatom content of 25 samples of surface sediments and water 

physico-chemical parameters. 

The study of diatom thanatocoenoses in present-day bottom sediments showed that there are 

distinct assemblages representative of the major types of environments, and that their 

distribution is mainly governed by gradients in salinity, PO4
3 -

, NO
3 -

 and Dissolved Organic 

Carbon. From this knowledge, a transfer function for salinity was derived which, plus 

autoecological data on diatoms, sedimentology, geochemical indicators and geochronology, 

were used to reconstruct the long-term evolution of two contrasting coastal wetlands in the 

WIAC. 

At the considered time scale, the evolution of Traba and Melides was mainly dependent on 

changes in four natural and anthropogenic factors: sand-barrier breaching (natural and/or 

human-induced), precipitation, forest cover (natural and/or human-induced), and cultural 

eutrophication. Sea-level changes played a minor or no role in their recent evolution. The 

complex interplay among all these factors prompted large ecological regime shifts interpreted 

in the framework of the Alternative Stable State Hypothesis of Shallow Lakes. Before the 

systems were impacted by direct human intervention, humid conditions were favourable for 

the development of turbid phases, generally irrespective of changes in barrier permeability. 

Whereas this relationship is clear in the Traba record, a higher connection to the ocean in 

Melides probably gave rise to a much more overlapped signal of the different forcing factors, 

making more difficult to disentangle the real contribution of climate in its evolution. In recent 

times cultural eutrophication and artificial barrier breaching accounted for most of the 

variability in the data, constituting the main drivers of the evolution in the two systems. 

In spite of concerns on present-day accelerated sea-level rise, palaeoecological research 

performed in Melides and Traba shows that the difficult task of good management practice in 

these systems should first focus in reducing nutrient loads to facilitate their natural recovery. 

Keywords: Western Iberian Atlantic Coast; Salinity Transfer function; Holocene 

palaeoenvironmental evolution; Alternative stable state conditions; Anthropic and climatic 

forcing factors.

Resumo 
Estuários, lagunas e lagos e charcos costeiros são ambientes de transição em constante 

evolução, por processos naturais ou atividades antrópicas, enfrentando problemas ambientais 

como a poluição ou assoreamento provocado por sedimentação de materiais de origem 

marinha ou continental. Este último, tornou-se mais evidente desde há cerca de 5500-7500 

anos cal AP (anos calibrados Antes do Presente), quando a barreira arenosa se tornou uma 

característica permanente das áreas costeiras da Costa Oeste Ibérica Atlântica (COIA). Torna-se 

imprescindível reconhecer se os agentes forçadores da evolução destes ambientes são de 

origem natural, antrópica, ou ambas, sendo as diatomáceas um indicador fundamental (em 

perspetiva multidisciplinar) no destrinçar dessas mesma origem. 

A reconstrução das condições ambientais passadas na COIA, baseada em diatomáceas, tem 

sido efetuada, até hoje de forma qualitativa, isto é, focada na autoecologia daquelas 

microalgas. Nesta dissertação pretende-se efetuar uma reconstrução paleoambiental 

quantitativa. Para tal, duas tipologias de amostragem distintas foram executadas. Um conjunto 

de amostras representativas das condições ambientais atuais (25 amostras de sedimentos 

superficiais para avaliação do conteúdo em diatomáceas e parâmetros físico-químicos da 

coluna de água), de 18 ambientes de transição da COIA (Valdoviño, Doniños, Traba, Louro, 

Xuño, Muro, Illa de Arousa, Bodeira, Minho, Lima, Vela, Óbidos, Albufeira, Sado, Melides, 

Santo André, Barbaroxa de Baixo e Mira), e outro, consistindo numa amostragem de alta 

resolução de duas sequências sedimentares (em Traba, representando os últimos 550 anos e 

Melides, representando os últimos 1745 anos). Com o primeiro foi possível construir uma 

função de transferência de salinidade, usada na reconstrução ambiental quantitativa das 

sequências sedimentares de Traba e Melides. 

Os resultados das amostras superficiais mostram que os locais estudados são representativos 

de ambientes marginais ou de pouca profundidade, podendo ser agrupados em lagos 

costeiros, lagunas e estuários, de acordo com associações de diatomáceas distintas. O primeiro 

grupo, constituído por lagos costeiros (Galegos e Portugueses), é caracterizado por 

diatomáceas ticoplantónicas e epifíticas de água doce/salobra. O segundo grupo, é composto 

por estuários portugueses e um único lago litoral galego (Doniños), sendo caracterizado 

principalmente pela presença de diatomáceas epipsâmicas marinhas/salobras. Finalmente, o 

terceiro grupo é constituído por lagunas portugueses (e o estuário do Sado) onde as 

diatomáceas epífitas de água doce a salobra são dominantes. As diatomáceas mais comuns e 

abundantes das amostras superficiais são Achnanthidium minutissimum, Pseudostaurosira 

trainorii e Nitzschia frustulum, sendo a salinidade, PO4
3-

, NO
3-

 e Carbono Orgânico Dissolvido, 

as variáveis que melhor explicam a distribuição das associações de diatomáceas dos ambientes 

da COIA. De entre estas, a salinidade é a que apresenta maior potencial para a reconstrução 

quantitativa dos paleoambientes costeiros de Traba e Melides.

As duas espécies de diatomáceas que melhor caracterizam o registo sedimentar de Traba, são 

a Pseudostaurosira trainorii (relacionada principalmente com a instabilidade ambiental 

associada a alterações na permeabilidade da barreira arenosa) e Achnanthidium 

minutissimum, podendo também ser usadas como indicadoras de mudanças tróficas neste 

sistema costeiro. Em Melides, são as espécies Pseudostaurosira trainorii (também aqui 

indicadora da instabilidade ambiental associada a alterações na permeabilidade da barreira 

arenosa), a epipélica Nitzschia frustulum e a epifítica Cocconeis placentula var. placentula 

(relacionadas com mudanças de estados alternativos estáveis) que predominam. À abundância 

relativa de taxa de diatomáceas, aliada à reconstrução quantitativa da salinidade adquirida por 

função de transferência, juntou-se a sedimentologia, a geoquímica e geocronologia, para uma 

interpretação multidisciplinar da evolução ambiental dos sistemas costeiros de Traba e 

Melides, mostrando que a sua evolução ecológica, tem como ponto fulcral a teoria dos estados 

alternativos estáveis para lagos pouco profundos, isto é, os ambientes variam ao longo da sua 

evolução entre dois estados de equilíbrio, uma condição turva com dominância de biomassa 

algal e outra transparente, caracterizada por um amplo desenvolvimento de vegetação 

aquática. 

A evolução ao longo de aproximadamente 550 anos a Lagoa de Traba foi controlada pela ação 

conjunta da variabilidade climática e intervenção humana. Verificou-se que as diatomáceas 

deste sistema respondem principalmente à abertura da barreira arenosa. Assim, de 1470 a 

1875 anos cal EC (anos calibrados da Era Comum), Traba caracterizou-se por um ambiente com 

ligação ao oceano, de características oligosalinas e com carga significativa de nutrientes 

(condição turva), potenciada não só pela desflorestação provocada pelo Homem, mas também 

pelo aumento da precipitação e eventos tempestivos, associados a longos períodos de NAO 

(North Atlantic Oscilation) negativa durante a Pequena Idade do Gelo (PIG). Entre 1875 e 1990 

anos cal EC, o nível de água deste sistema baixa, bem como a carga de nutrientes (condição de 

transparência). Esta transição não está apenas ligada ao terminus da PIG como também à 

reflorestação feita na bacia hidrográfica desta zona húmida e consequente aprisionamento de 

nutrientes a montante. A partir de 1992 até 2007 anos cal EC, assiste-se a uma nova mudança, 

com provável intervenção humana direta nas imediações desta zona húmida, representada 

por um novo aumento de nutrientes para esta área. Nos últimos anos, o nível de eutrofização 

diminui, devido à abertura artificial da barreira arenosa. 

A Lagoa de Melides, de maiores dimensões que a de Traba, apresenta-se como um sistema de 

mistura, isto é, mostrando que os múltiplos fatores que influenciam esta zona húmida têm 

interação complexa e simultânea, tornando a distinção das causas forçadoras dos últimos 1745 

anos deste sistema muito difícil. No entanto, verificou-se que as diatomáceas respondem a 

dois grandes fatores, a instabilidade (potenciada pela abertura da barra, entrada de água da 

bacia hidrográfica ou precipitação) e mudanças de estados alternativos estáveis do sistema. 

Assim, de 260 a 530 anos cal EC, Melides era um ambiente restrito, apesar de apresentar 

condição turva. A partir de 530 até 850 anos cal EC, há um acréscimo de carga de nutrientes no 

sistema, devido a um aumento da permeabilidade da barreira arenosa. Sugere-se que esta 

condição de elevada permeabilidade do sistema esteja a mascarar as condições húmidas 

responsáveis pela entrada de nutrientes via continental, em discordância com as condições

secas bem estabelecidas para o Período das Trevas. Entre 850 e 1700 anos cal EC, a laguna 

transforma-se num ambiente mais restrito, resultado da baixa conexão com o oceano, embora 

esta aumente no final este período. Por outro lado, ocorrem duas grandes mudanças nos 

estados alternativos estáveis. A primeira dá-se entre 850 e 1700 anos cal EC, através de uma 

mudança gradual de condição turva para transparência, desencadeada não só pelas condições 

quentes e relativamente áridas da Anomalia Climática Medieval descritas para a Península 

Ibérica, como também pelas condições de baixa precipitação associadas a fases positivas 

persistentes da NAO, que diminuíram claramente a carga de nutrientes que chega ao espaço 

lagunar restrito. Segue-se uma fase de transição, e um novo retorno a um sistema de condição 

turva adquirida desde 1950 anos cal EC até ao presente. As condições húmidas da PIG que 

aumentariam a carga de nutrientes, não foram no entanto responsáveis pela transição para 

uma condição turva, muito devido ao aumento da conexão com oceano, que acontece a partir 

de 1950. Sugere-se que é a partir desta data que as condições atuais de hipertrofia foram 

adquiridas, como resultado do aumento de nutrientes potenciado pela carga de fertilizantes 

chegada por via continental. 

Assim, na escala de tempo considerada, a evolução de Traba e Melides dependeu 

principalmente de alterações em quatro fatores naturais e antrópicos: abertura/fecho da 

barreira arenosa (natural e/ou induzida pelo Homem), precipitação, cobertura florestal 

(natural e/ou induzida pelo Homem) e eutrofização cultural. As flutuações do nível médio do 

mar desempenharam um papel menor ou nulo na evolução recente destes sistemas. A 

complexa interação entre todos esses fatores conduziu a grandes mudanças de regime 

ecológico interpretadas segundo a teoria de estados alternativos estáveis para lagos pouco 

profundos. Estas mudanças em Melides e Traba dependeram em grande parte das Mudanças 

Climáticas Rápidas ocorridas durante o Holocénico. Antes da intervenção humana direta nos 

sistemas, as condições húmidas foram favoráveis para o desenvolvimento das fases turvas, e 

em geral, independentes de alterações na permeabilidade da barreira. Ambos os sistemas 

experimentaram mudanças a partir de um estado turvo para um de transparência associadas a 

mudanças de períodos húmidos para secos (o início da Anomalia Climática Medieval em 

Melides, e o termo da PIG em Traba). Essa relação é clara no registo de Traba, enquanto que 

uma mais frequente conexão com o oceano em Melides, provavelmente, deu origem a uma 

sobreposição de sinais dos diferentes fatores que forçam os sistema, tornando mais difícil 

separar a contribuição real do clima na sua evolução. Nos últimos anos, a eutrofização cultural 

e a abertura artificial da barreira arenosa, são os responsáveis pela maior parte da 

variabilidade dos dados, que constituem os principais motores da evolução nos dois sistemas. 

Os resultados obtidos mostram-se fundamentais na correta gestão integrada da zona costeira 

Ibérica. Apesar das preocupações com o atual aumento do nível do mar, a pesquisa 

paleoecológica realizada em Melides e Traba mostra que as boas práticas de gestão devem 

primeiro focar-se na redução de cargas de nutrientes para facilitar a sua recuperação natural, e 

ser acompanhadas por planos de monitorização e investigação científica multidisciplinar.

Preface 
This thesis is based on the work carried out as a PhD student at the Departamento de 

Geologia, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, as well as in the Facultade de 

Ciencias, Universidade da  Coruña, between March 2007 and December 2013. 

The main objective of this thesis consists on disentangling the natural and anthropogenic 

factors that drive the evolution of two coastal environments, Traba (Galicia, NW Spain; 550 

years of sedimentation) and Melides Lagoon (SW Portugal; 1745 years of sedimentation), using 

sedimentological, geochemical and biological, particularly diatoms indicators. This thesis is 

explained in five chapters which can be briefly described as follows:  

Chapter 1: Introduction – in this introductory chapter the main objectives of this thesis will be 

discussed as well as its problematic – the issues that can be addressed in the study of the 

evolution of coastal environments, the identification of diatom communities, its structure and 

distribution in both present day samples and in core samples, but also questions associated 

with the sampling strategy and application of transfer functions derived from the present 

diatoms assemblages to the past (i. e., cores), especially in coastal environments, and also the 

scientific context of this work;  

Chapter 2: Study area – in this chapter, the 18 coastal environments with different types of 

connection to the sea – lakes and ponds, lagoons and estuaries - located in the Western 

Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC) that were studied are presented. Their general features, 

geological, geomorphological and climatic contexts are also briefly described; 

Chapter 3: Methods – these 18 environments were subjected to an environmental 

characterization and identification of the diatom assemblages preserved in their surface 

sediments. The relationship between the diatom assemblages composition and the 

environmental variables has been studied, and two coastal wetlands, Traba (Galicia, NW Spain) 

and Melides (SW Portugal), where selected for coring and reconstructions of past 

environmental conditions. All the field and laboratory methodologies, as well as the numerical 

analyses performed on both present day and core data, are explained in this chapter; 

Chapter 4 - Results – the results are presented in three separate paper-like chapters, each one 

including introduction, results, and discussion and conclusions sections. 

Chapter 4.1. Diatom assemblages in present-day bottom sediments of Western Iberian Atlantic 

coastal environments - This chapter documents the diatom assemblages present in 18 coastal 

environments of the Western Iberian Atlantic and their relationship with the main 

hydrochemical variables that characterize them, resulting in a transfer function to be used for

the reconstruction of past salinity conditions in the recent history of Traba and Melides coastal 

wetlands. 

Chapter 4.2. Climatic and anthropogenic impacts in Traba coastal wetland (Galicia, NW Spain) 

in the last 550 years – in this chapter the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Traba wetland 

in the last 550 years based on diatoms, sedimentology and geochemical proxies is presented. 

The main forcing factors, both natural and anthropogenic are identified, as well as how they 

have prompted changes between ecological alternative stable states. 

Chapter 4.3. Natural and human-induced changes in alternative stable states – a 1745 years 

record of environmental change in the Melides lagoon (Portugal) – this chapter presents a 

multiproxy palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the last 1745 years in the Melides lagoon 

that includes diatom, sedimentological and geochemical data. The major natural and 

anthropogenic agents driving this evolution are also identified and, as in the previous chapter, 

studied as the triggers of changes between ecological alternative stable states. 

Chapter 5: Discussion and Conclusions - in this chapter a global discussion that integrates all 

the results found in this thesis, and some general conclusions are presented, as well as some 

ideas about the future work that could be tackled and self-criticism.

1. Introduction 
 

1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Coastal lakes and ponds, lagoons and estuaries are transitional environments in constant 

evolution, either by natural processes – e. g., climatic changes, sea-level rise - or 

anthropogenic activities – e. g., afforestation/deforestation, agriculture, water and sediment 

extraction, urbanization, industry, port constructions. Extremely sensitive, these environments 

are in the centre of conflict of interests between its use (sometimes abusive), and its 

preservation, given its great ecological importance, namely in carbon storage, biodiversity 

conservation, fish production, water purification, and erosion control (Moreno-Mateos et al., 

2013). They face not only environmental problems like pollution and silting up, with mainly 

siltyclastic material, from marine or continental origin, but they are also particularly vulnerable 

to climate change impacts that include accelerated sea-level rise, increased temperature, 

changes in rainfall distribution and freshwater inputs, increases in the frequency and intensity 

of storms, sediment supply, tidal range, land use, and nutrient availability, all operating over a 

range of temporal and spatial scales (Cooper, 1994; Isla, 1995; Hesp &amp;amp; Short, 1999; Day et al., 

2008; Moser et al., 2013; Newton et al., 2013; Williams, 2013). Besides these global agents, 

direct local human intervention in these systems is a potential major factor that can 

significantly alter coastal ecosystems (Håkanson &amp;amp; Bryhn, 2008), but the exact pace and 

ultimate severity of local impacts very much depend on regional climatic changes (Moser et al., 

2012). 

It is therefore imperative the understanding of these systems and especially their evolution, 

since most of the world population leaves in the coastal area.  Hence, it is important to 

understand the relative contribution of different modelling agents into shaping these 

wetlands, including the anthropogenic influence. 

Present-day Atlantic transitional systems are frequently in an advanced stage of siltation, due 

to sediments from ocean and continental origin deposited after the deglaciation and especially 

in the last 5500 calibrated years Before Present (cal yr BP), when sea-level decelerates (Bao et 

al., 1999; Freitas et al., 1999; Dias et al., 2000; Freitas et al., 2002a, 2003a; Cearreta et al., 

2003; Andrade et al., 2004; Alday et al., 2006; Dinis et al., 2006; Bao et al., 2007; Costas et al., 

2009; González Villanueva et al., 2009). It has been suggested that until the end of the first half 

of the Holocene, global forcing factors control the evolution of the wetlands, whereas in the 

second half, due to the decrease postglacial marine transgression, mesoscale factors have

become progressively more important in explaining that (Devoy et al., 1996; Freitas et al., 

2002a; Bao et al., 2007).  

Also, global and local forcing factors can induce changes in the equilibrium of ecosystems. For 

the case of shallow lentic systems, it is known that they can be found in two main types of 

alternative stable states: a clear state dominated by aquatic vegetation, and a turbid state 

characterized by high algal biomass (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer, 2004). Major changes in 

nutrient availability trigger the ecological regime shift from one stable state to another, but 

this can last long periods of time, making long-term studies imperative for understanding the 

real nature of this kind of ecosystem transitions (e. g., García Rodríguez et al., 2010; Stutz et 

al., 2012).  

However in most cases environmental monitoring data are not available and, when available, 

they usually cover less than 15 years, in spite of being essential for knowing, for instance, the 

effects of climate change in semi enclosed coastal systems (Newton et al., 2013). 

Palaeoenvironmental records covering decadal to centennial time-scales can substitute the 

lack of monitoring data for tracking long-term dynamics in aquatic systems whilst smoothing 

out short-term variability (Sayer et al., 2010). They can not only provide valuable data on 

reference conditions that can be target for correct restoration plans in disturbed ecosystems, 

but be used to track the consequences of these plans (Smol, 2008). This is particularly 

important for the case of wetlands, because they can recover towards alternative states that 

differ from reference conditions before degradation (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2013). 

In order to disentangle anthropogenic from natural forcing factors during the Holocene 

evolution of coastal areas, multidisciplinary studies have to be done at different time scales, 

microscale (hundreds of years) to mesoscale (hundreds to thousand years). Conditions prior 

and after these impacts, can be assessed trough the evaluation of several indicators, namely 

sedimentological, geochemical or biological, in sediments accumulated in that time period. 

The use of microfossils is decisive to the multidisciplinary palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions of the coastal area during the Holocene, including the knowledge of the 

controlling factors on the Holocene evolution of the coast. Recent work about the Holocene 

sedimentary records of Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC), limited especially to Rias 

environments and Atlantic continental shelf (e. g., Abrantes, 1991; Bao et al., 1997; Sanchez-

Goñi et al., 1999; Abrantes, 2000; Diz et al., 2002; Cobelo-Garcia &amp;amp;Prego, 2003, Desprat et al., 

2003; García-García et al., 2005; González-Álvarez et al., 2005; Bartels-Jónsdóttir et al., 2006; 

Lebreiro et al., 2006, Álvarez-Iglesias et al., 2007; Naughton et al., 2007a; Pérez-Arlucea et al., 

2007; Bernardez et al., 2008; Lantzsch et al., 2009;  Rodrigues et al., 2009; Mohamed et al., 

2010; Evans et al, 2011; Gomes et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2012), have shown the importance 

of multidisciplinary studies in paleoclimatology, palaeoceanography, sea-level rise or 

contaminants.

Although there are a good number of works about how the forcing agents (natural or 

anthropogenic) have control the evolution of transitional coastal environments in the WIAC (e. 

g., Zazo et al., 1996; Pendon et al., 1998; Ramos et al., 2001; Santos et al., 2001; Henriques et 

al., 2002; Freitas et al., 2003b; Drago et al., 2004; Santos &amp;amp; Sánchez-Goñi, 2003; Cearreta et al., 

2003; Abrantes et al., 2005; Dinis et al., 2005; Cabral et al., 2006; Costa, 2006; Drago et al., 

2006; Ferreira et al., 2006; Cearreta et al., 2007; Naughton et al., 2007b; Danielsen, 2008; 

Costas et al., 2009; Cruces et al., 2009; Arribas et al., 2010; Cruces et al., 2010; Granja et al., 

2010; Cruces et al., 2011; De la Rosa et al., 2012; Leorri et al., 2013), and at Mediterranean 

coast (e. g., Bosky et al., 2002; Andrade et al., 2004; Fletcher et al., 2017; Bosky et al., 2008)  

most of them are focused on estuaries, whereas lagoons and coastal lakes and ponds studies 

are still scarse.  

There are several palaeoecological indicators suitable to be used in coastal environments 

evolution. Among them, the analysis of diatoms has proven to be a very effective technique 

(Anderson &amp;amp; Vos, 1992; Denys &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1999), since they are sensitive to environmental 

variations and constitute a key element for their detection and control.  

Diatoms (Class Bacillariophyceae) are a group of microscopic algae abundant in almost all 

aquatic habitats. They are constituted by frustules that are composed of hydrated amorphous 

silica, SiO2.nH2O. Diatoms are very sensitive indicators regarding the trophic status (Bennion, 

1994), sea-level variation and shallow lake alternative states (Gárcia-Rodrigues et al., 2010), 

sea-level fluctuations and palaeotidal levels (e. g., Zong and Horton, 1999), isolation bowls due 

to isostasy (e. g., Kjemperud, 1986; Saulnier-Talbot &amp;amp; Pienitz, 2001; Granja et al., 2010), 

stability of barriers in lagoons (e. g., Bao et al., 1999), changes in hydrological dynamics (e. g., 

Rovira et al., 2012),"storm surge" events (e. g., Parsons, 1998; Zong and Tooley, 1999) and 

tsunamigenic activity (e. g., Hemphill-Haley, 1996). 

Diatoms have proven to be particularly useful in the WIAC Holocene evolutional studies (Bao 

et al., 1999; Santos et al., 2001; Cearreta et al., 2003; Ferreira, 2006; Bao et al., 2007; Granja et 

al., 2010; Santos 2010), but whereas precise quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions 

could be accomplished elsewhere (e. g., Cooper et al., 2010; Snoeijs &amp;amp; Weckström, 2010), 

interpretation of the Iberian Atlantic Holocene diatom records have always been qualitative, 

based on autoecological data from other regions (Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993). Regarding the study of 

diatoms in sediments applied to the Holocene evolution of coastal environments and 

particularly lakes and ponds, lagoons and estuaries, the approach used in the projects 

PRAXIS/PCNA/C/CTE/12/96 and POCTI/PDCTM/P/MAR/15231/99 allowed, for the first time, its 

registration in some environments of SW Portugal (Alentejo Coast); these results were 

integrated in a multi and interdisciplinary perspective, and led to the establishment of a 

conceptual model of evolution of the coastline in the last thousand years framed with the 

respective forcing factors, that stand out the variation in means of sea-level, climate change 

and anthropogenic influence (Bao et al., 1999; Cearreta et al., 2003).

1.2 OBJECTIVES 

The main objective of this study is to use diatoms as ecological indicators and derive transfer 

functions to be applied in two cores in order to reconstruct past environmental conditions in 

the Iberian Atlantic façade.   

This general goal will be developed, pointing out, whenever necessary, the various problems 

associated specially with the sampling and analysis in coastal environments, as detailed in the 

following items: 

1. To know the present-day  diatom associations existing in sediments of lakes and 

ponds, lagoons and estuaries from western Iberian coastal fringe and relate them to 

environmental variables, in order to build transfer functions for environmental 

variables that intervene more decisively in the distribution of the present-day 

diatom associations (microscale approach); 

Coastal transitional environments are subjected to a large variety of forcing factors 

and contributors. It is important to assess what is (are) the main environmental 

variable(s) responsible for diatom variation. Although relatively low hydraulic energy 

that usually characterize these environments favour the sediment settling, deposition 

and preservation, there are a huge amount of geological (i. e., sediment supply, 

geological settings and isostasy), physical (i. e., oceanographic, atmospheric, fluvial, 

groundwater processes and sea-level changes), morphological,  chemical (i. e., 

nutrients, pollutants), biological (i. e., intervening flora and fauna) and anthropogenic 

factors, that play a wide spectra of roles (Perrilo et al., 2009). These leads to different 

levels of complexity, being the estuaries the environments where these variations and 

influences are experienced most strongly and the coastal lakes and ponds, the ones 

that experience the less intensely.  

This complex series of factors are the main cause of diversity and difficulty on the 

identification of diatoms and for the lack of studies on autoecologies. A thorough and 

proper compilation of these reasons, especially for estuarine environments, have 

already been described in Ribeiro (2010); this author points to shortage in specialized 

literature, namely for brackish waters, considerable morphological variability of widely 

distributed taxa and also dissolution and fragmentation, due not only to nutrient 

limitation but also to high hydrodynamism. Actually, according to Ryves et al. (2006), 

salinity is the most important variable affecting dissolution within each data-set, and 

Gasse et al. (1995) taphonomic problems related to diatom dissolution are critical in 

saline waters. Dissolution of diatoms can bias the assemblage by selective dissolution 

of weakly silicified forms. This process depends on both ionic composition and 

concentration and thus is site specific (Barker et al., 1994). All these problems can 

often lead to aff. and cf. classification forms, which will ultimately result in a less 

reliable reconstruction.

For the purpose of constructing a transfer function, a set of sediment samples and 

environmental variables were collected, to evaluate the diatom assemblages in the 

sediment which responds to the variation of an environmental variable. Transfer 

functions derive a quantitative relationship between species composition (in these 

case, diatoms) and water quality parameters. Knowing the optima and tolerances of 

these diatoms to a given variable, it is possible to transfer that information to the past, 

and reconstruct quantitatively the given variable along the period of time of the core. 

 

 

 

2. To characterize the existing fossil diatom associations in the sediments of the Traba 

and Melides coastal wetlands which have been accumulated in the last thousand 

years (mesoscale approach); to use the transfer functions to reconstruct past 

environmental conditions and integrate this information in a multi and 

interdisciplinary perspective in order to refine the existing palaeoenvironmental 

evolution models; 

After identification of the diatom assemblage, present in each core and their variation 

at a high level of resolution, the application of the transfer function can be done.  

In WIAC area, there are few studies devoted to the reconstruction performed of 

coastal palaeoenvironmental systems based on diatoms and those are essentially 

concentrated in the continental shelf and the oceanic environments (e. g., Abrantes, 

2000; Abrantes et al., 2005). Also, diatoms are usually used to characterize coastal 

systems and their relationship with the main environmental gradients (Sampayo, 1970; 

Cabrita e Moita, 1995; Ribeiro et al., 2003; Resende et al., 2005; Gameiro et al., 2007; 

Brogueira et al., 2007; Resende et al., 2007; Mendes et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2010; 

Gameiro et al., 2010; Ribeiro, 2010, Gomes et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2013). But until 

present there are no works on a quantitative reconstruction of an environmental 

variable. With the development of dedicated coastal diatom-water quality transfer 

functions, it will be possible to estimate some aspects of pre and post-human 

intervention in water quality in coastal areas, thereby providing a baseline against 

which it is possible to assess the degree of human impact. 

Transfer functions are powerful tolls that rely on present data to be applied on the 

past data but as it was shown above, in coastal areas, namely transitional 

environments, the appliance, although very tempting, must be derived with careful 

(see discussion in Juggins, 2013). The reasons already pointed out in Objective 1, along 

with the variability and poor records, are the main reasons for transitional 

environments being so poorly study, especially in what concerns transfer functions 

using diatoms.

3. To get new indicators that allow to understand the forcing factors in coastal areas 

and to contribute to the characterization of the resilience of the evaluated  systems 

based on behavioural responses, past and present, data of primary importance in the 

face of global changes and in an Integrated Coastal Zone Management perspective. 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – IPCC predicts that coastal areas will 

undergo rapid and continued changes In the future (IPCC, 2007), thus is important to 

disentangle if changes in the ecosystem are caused by human pressure and not due to 

natural variability (Newton et al., 2013).  

Diatoms are sensitive to environmental variations (Anderson &amp;amp; Vos, 1992; Denys &amp;amp; de 

Wolf, 1999). It is therefore imperative the study of these systems at different scales 

based on diatoms, which will not only allow assessing the reference situation against 

which the present-day situation is confronted, but also evaluate the conditions that 

controlled the evolution of coastal areas. Such studies can provide indicators species 

that can be used as analogues to the future changes in these coastal systems.

2. Study Area 
 

2.1 PHYSICAL SETTING 

This work focuses in a set of 18 study sites, corresponding to transitional coastal environments 

spread along the Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC), particularly coastal lakes and ponds, 

lagoons and estuaries, extending in latitude from 43 ?N to 37 ?N (Fig.2.1). 

On the WAIC the tide is semi-diurnal which according to Davies (1977), makes this coast to be 

classified in the mesotidal regime and dominated by swells from the NW (73 %) and from the 

W (16 %) (Costa, 1994). Mean wave heights vary strongly with season (Vitorino et al., 2002a, 

b). In summer, typical wave heights are 1–3 m, with periods of 11–13 s. During winter storms 

often exceed 7 m, typically with periods of 13 s, but they can exceed 18 s (Costa, 1994).

In the following sections a description of the studied lowlands addressed in this study, as well 

as their geological and climate contexts, is presented.

2.2 COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS CHARACTERIZATION 

The studied coastal systems have been classified according to the following definitions and 

references: 

• Coastal lakes and ponds are freshwater coastal bodies located in a depression 

completely separated from the ocean by any type of barrier. 

• Lagoons are depressed coastal areas, separated from the ocean by a barrier that 

allows a permanent or ephemeral communication with the ocean and where river flow 

is negligible or null (Freitas, 1995). 

• Estuaries are semi-enclosed coastal water bodies, with connection to the ocean, where 

seawater is mixed with fresh water from river drainage (Cameron &amp;amp; Prichard, 1963, in 

Dyer, 1973). 

The classification of each coastal environment addressed in this study in the above-cited 

scheme is evident in the case of estuaries (Minho, Lima, Sado and Mira) and coastal lakes and 

ponds (Xuño, Bodeira, Illa de Arousa, Vela and Barbaroxa de Baixo). However, the classification 

of systems with barriers and ephemeral inlets, such as lagoons, is not always so clear 

(Valdoviño, Doniños, Traba, Louro, Muro, Óbidos, Albufeira, Melides and Santo André).  

The classification of Portuguese lagoon systems was based on the existing bibliography 

(Óbidos - Freitas, 1989; Albufeira - Freitas, 1995; Melides and Santo André – Cruces, 2001). For 

the Galician environments, the classification was more difficult, since bibliographic information 

is scarce. An evaluation was therefore made with the available cartographic and photographic 

data, in order to assess the type and effectiveness of communication with the ocean, the type 

of inlet (permanent, ephemeral). A set of ancient maps, aerial photographs, Google Earth 

imagery and ground photographs from different authors offered as shareware in Google Earth 

Gallery (2013) were used. From these data, it was possible to classify the 18 studied 

environments in the 3 previously established types.  

Table 2.1 summarises the most relevant environmental characteristics of all the studied sites. 

Figure 2.2.a and b illustrate all studied environments and sample locations.

2.3 GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SETTING 

The lowlands addressed in this study are distributed throughout the WIAC and are located in 

the transition between the continent and the ocean (estuaries and lagoons), or just a few 

hundred metres away from the coastline (in the case of coastal lakes and ponds). In general, 

they correspond to coastal depressions developed in association with recent coastal features, 

such as barriers or coastal plains, regardless the age and geology of the regional bedrock. They 

are located in three fundamental morpho-structural terranes.  The Hesperian massif, pre-

Mesozoic in age and including a varied suite of metamorphic and magmatic rocks hosts the 

northern lowlands of Galicia, the Minho and Lima estuaries, as well as the Mira estuary, 

located further south. The western Mesozoic basin (Lusitanian basin), largely made up by 

consolidated terrigenous sediments and limestones, deposited in relation with the opening 

and expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, accommodate the Vela lake and Óbidos lagoon. Finally, 

the lagoons of Albufeira, Melides, Santo André and Barbaroxa de Baixo pond, as well as the 

Sado estuary, are located in the Cenozoic basins of the Tagus and Sado rivers (Fig. 2.3). 

 

Fig. 2.3 - Plot of the studied environments within the Iberian Peninsula showing the principal 

morpho-structural units (adapted from Ribeiro et al., 1979). 

In general terms, and from a geomorphological point of view, most of the studied sites, 

extending along the western Iberian Atlantic fringe, are located in littoral plains, carved in 

Precambrian and Paleozoic terranes that were later covered by detritic deposits (Fig. 2.3). 

These littoral features confine further inland with mountainous land defined in Mesozoic and 

essentially pre-Mesozoic terranes. The Cenozoic deposits resting on the substrate are 

essentially Pleistocene and Holocene in age and include a varied suite of forms and sediments,

related with periglacial, lacustrine, fluvial, lagoonal, estuarine, coastal and shallow-marine 

environments, such as beach and dune ridges (Ribeiro et al., 1979; Ferreira, 1981; Valcarlos &amp;amp; 

Vidal, 1998) (Fig. 2.3). 

2.4 CLIMATIC CONTEXT 

The previously mentioned geological and structural constraints influence the geomorphology 

and, consequently, the relief of Iberia.  The northern region has in general terms higher 

altitudes in contrast with the southern one. This contrast translates to some extent in the 

distribution of the climatic patterns, although a general broad influence from the Atlantic 

extends along the whole studied region (Ribeiro et al., 1987a, b). 

The results from the 1971-2000 climate normals (Iberian Climate Atlas, 2011), can be used to 

map the spatial distribution of climate types in Iberia according to the Köppen-Geiger 

classification (which is the latest revision of Köppen, 1936, classification) (Fig. 2.5). The results 

indicate that most of the Iberian climate is temperate (Type C); the littoral façade corresponds 

to subtype Cs (temperate with dry summer) and includes two  climate subtypes: the Csb 

subtype (temperate with dry to temperate summer; average temperature in the hottest 

month below or equal to 22  °C  and four months or more with average temperatures above 

10 °C), which dominates in the studied area;  and  the Csa subtype (temperate with dry to hot 

summer,  average temperature in the hottest month above 22 °C) applying to the region of the 

Sado estuary and Albufeira lagoon.

Annual average rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula has a nonuniform distribution throughout the 

territory. This is mainly due to the orographic distribution (Fig. 2.6). According to Iberian 

Climate Atlas (2011), highest values are above 2200 mm and are seen in the mountainous 

areas of north-eastern Continental Portugal (Serra do Gerês), in the northeast of Navarra and 

in some areas of the southwestern Galicia, close to the “Rias Baixas” in Spain. The lowest 

values were recorded in the southeast of Spain, in the provinces of Almeria and Murcia, and 

the south of Alicante, with average annual rainfall below 300 mm. In the areas close to Cabo 

de Gata (Spain), rainfall is even lower, less than 200 mm. 

According to the Iberian Climate Atlas (2011), monthly average rainfall varies between years, 

with notable seasonality, being stronger in the southern half of the Peninsula, and less notable 

in the northeast of Spain, with a clear reduction in rainfall in summer. The rainiest month in 

the Peninsula is December, whereas the driest is July.  

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been recognised for more than 60 years as one of the 

major patterns of atmospheric variability in the Northern Hemisphere (Walker 1924; Walker &amp;amp; 

Bliss 1932). This important circulation mode is clearly identified when time-averaged data 

(monthly or seasonal) are examined, since time-averaging reduces the "noise" of small-scale 

and transient meteorological phenomena not related to large-scale climate variability (Hurrel, 

2000). In simple terms, the NAO corresponds to a large-scale meridional oscillation between 

the subtropical anticyclone near the Azores (the Azores High) and the subpolar low pressure 

system near Iceland (the Icelandic Low) (van Loon &amp;amp; Rogers 1978). The relative strengths and 

positions of these systems vary from year to year and this variation is known as the NAO. 

The negative NAO phase (NAO
-
) occurs when the Icelandic Low and Açores High are 

simultaneously weak (e. g., Serreze et al., 1997), favouring the suppression of the westerlies, 

(Trigo et al., 2002). Negative phases of the NAO induce above-normal precipitation in southern 

Europe, particularly over the west and southwest sectors of the Iberian Peninsula (Hurrell &amp;amp; 

van Loon 1997; Trigo et al. 2002). During episodes of strong negative index values, enhanced 

storminess and precipitation between the Azores archipelago and Iberia occur (Trigo et al., 

2004; Vicente- Serrano et al., 2011). 

By contrast, the positive NAO phase (NAO
+
) occurs when the Icelandic Low and Açores High are 

simultaneously strong (e. g., Serreze et al., 1997), leading to increased westerlies (Trigo et al., 

2002). During high NAO index winters, drier conditions occur over much of central and 

southern Europe, whereas enhanced moisture flux converges from Iceland through 

Scandinavia (Hurrell, 1995). These circumstances are manifested by an increase in cyclone 

frequency, enhanced westerlies across the northern North Atlantic and an increase of winter 

air temperatures (Trigo et al., 2002).  

Although NAO exerts a big control on precipitation patterns over the Mediterranean basin, 

(Trigo et al., 2004), it is also known that the strength of the correlation between the NAO index 

and local (or regional) climate variables has changed over time (Rodó et al., 1997; Goodess &amp;amp; 

Jones, 2002).

3. Methods 
 

3.1 INTRODUCTION 

This study aims at unravelling the main environmental factors governing the present-day 

composition of diatom assemblages found in bottom sediments of coastal lowlands from the 

Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC) and at using this knowledge on the modern analogues 

for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.  

To achieve these objectives, two groups of samples were studied. A first set of samples 

consisted of present-day bottom sediments and water samples collected from 18 transitional 

coastal systems of the WIAC (see Fig. 2.1 and Table 2.1, Chapter 2). It is assumed that bottom 

sediments in wetlands contain an integrated diatom assemblage that represents the various 

habitats in the system in the last few months or years of sedimentation (Battarbee et al., 

2001). The combination of compositional diatom abundance data from the sediments with 

physico-chemical data (environmental data) from the water column that describe the key 

characteristics of the wetland, produces what is called a training data-set (Birks, 2010). 

Relating the two type of data (diatom abundances in the sediments and environmental data) 

with statistical analyses, a model called transfer function can be produced allowing the 

quantitative reconstruction of an environmental variable for a given time of the past (Sachs et 

al., 1977). 

A second set consisted of core samples taken from Lagoa de Traba (ED50: 29T 496302E; 

478265N) in Galicia (Fig. 2.2a, Chapter 2), NW Spain, and Lagoa de Melides  

(ED50: 29S 000165E;   4220501N), in central-west Portugal (Fig. 2.2b, Chapter 2), covering, in 

both coastal systems, the sedimentation occurred in the very late Holocene. A 

palaeoenvironmental reconstruction allowing the identification of the main forcing factors 

driving the recent evolution of the two systems was performed using sedimentological and 

geochemical data from the cores and, especially, the knowledge of diatom modern analogues 

from the training data-set. 

In the following section, field methods, sample processing techniques and numerical analysis 

procedures will be described as applied to both the present-day (training set) and core data-

sets.

3.2 FIELD METHODS 

Field surveys for bottom sediment sampling and measurement of physico-chemical variables 

characterizing the overlying water column were completed between February 2007 and July 

2008, on a seasonal basis (Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, Appendix I).

3.2.1 WATER SAMPLING – ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS 

Water sampling and in-situ measurements were performed two to four times per year (Table 

3.3, Appendix I) to examine the seasonal environmental variability and to compute an annual 

average. In each sampling station measurements of physico-chemical variables were taken at 

the surface for shallow water bodies and every 0.5 m along the water column from surface 

until bottom for deeper water bodies. Temperature, pH, redox potential, conductivity, salinity, 

dissolved oxygen (concentration and % of saturation) were measured in-situ using calibrated 

probes (Table 3.2). Water samples were collected with a Van Dorn water sampler for 

laboratory analyses (surface samples for shallow water bodies and a bottom sample for deeper 

water bodies); for nutrient (NO3

3.2.2 PRESENT-DAY BOTTOM SEDIMENTS AND CORES 

A total of 25 sites from 18 water bodies that make up this study were sampled for the study of 

modern analogues. Bottom sediments were collected using a van Veen grab sampler. The 

uppermost 1 cm of sediment was taken and stored in plastic vials at 4 °C. 

Short cores were taken in 2003 in Lagoa de Melides (3 replica, cores LM6-1, LM6-2 and LM6-3) 

and in 2007 in Lagoa de Traba (2 replica, cores TRA07-A1 and TRA07-A2) (Fig. 2.2a and b, 

Chapter 2; Table 3.4) using a hand-driven gravity corer (Melides) operated from a small boat 

and a piston corer from Aquatic Research Instruments (based on Fisher et al., 1992) also 

operated from a small boat (Traba). The cores were kept at 4 °C in the laboratory, described 

macroscopically, and subsampled at 1 cm intervals. The sedimentological and geochemical 

characterization of the replicas allowed for detailed correlation between cores of different 

length and to construct two composite cores, LM6 and TRA07. On Results Chapter (Chapter 4), 

data and results of analytical procedures, will be refer to the replica core, whereas 

interpretations and discussion will refer to the composite cores.

) were analysed in the Instituto de 

Investigacións Mariñas (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas - CSIC, Vigo, Spain) 

using an Integral Futura autoanalyser system (Alliance Instruments), which uses separate 

analytical lines to determine nitrate (NO3

and silicate (SiO4

), according to standard colorimetric methods (Hansen &amp;amp; Koroleff, 1999). 

The accuracy of the analytical procedure was assessed by processing certified reference 

materials: MOOS-1 (seawater nutrients; NRC, Canada), and good agreement has been 

obtained with the certified values. The precision measured was assessed by relative standard 

deviation (RSD), always remained less than 5 %. Detection limits, expressed as three times the 

standard deviation of 10 replicate measurements of reagent blanks, were: 0.14 µM for nitrate, 

0.01 µM for ammonium, 0.08 µM for phosphate and 0.14 µM for silicate. 

In the Servizos de Apoio á Investigación of the Universidade da Coruña (SAI-UDC), anion

3.3.2 DIATOMS  

Bottom sediment samples taken during the last field survey in each site, were selected for the 

study of diatom content in order to relate diatom assemblages with water parameters. The 

collected material (uppermost 1 cm) is assumed to contain representative information of the 

environmental constrains modulating the depositional system, time-averaged over the last few 

years or months (Battarbee et al., 2001) (Appendix IIA).  Similarly, sediment cores were 

sampled every 1 cm (Traba, TRA07-A1, Appendix IIB) or every 2 cm (Melides, LM6-3, (Appendix 

IIC) for diatom analysis. 

Both present-day and core sediment samples were prepared following Renberg (1990). Each 

dry sediment subsample, weighting approximately 0.1 g, was inserted in a 10 mL-capacity 

centrifuge tube and treated with hot H2O2 (30 %) and HCl (35 %) to remove organic matter and 

carbonates, respectively. Following elimination of these components, successive washings with 

distilled water were made until neutralization of the suspension. After each washing 

operation, the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 1200 rpm during 4 minutes.   

The suspensions were then successively subjected to dilution or concentration procedures 

until an appropriate diatom valve concentration in the microscopic slides was achieved for 

routine identification and counting under the microscope. Finally, 0.5 mL of this suspension 

was extended on a clean cover glass, dried at room temperature, and mounted on a slide with 

Naphrax® mounting medium (refractive index = 1.74). 

The slides were observed under light microscope for taxonomic identification. This was done 

at GeoFCUL laboratories (Departamento de Geologia, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade 

de Lisboa, Portugal), using an Olympus BX 51 - phase contrast microscope (magnification 

1000x), and at the laboratories of the Facultade de Ciencias, Universidade da Coruña (UDC, 

Spain) using a Nikon Eclipse E600 - differential-interferential contrast Normarsky microscope 

(magnification 1000x). 

In addition to optical methods, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used at FCUL and UDC 

for the identification of problematic taxa in both present-day and core sediment samples. At 

Centro de Biologia Ambiental (CBA) of FCUL, aliquots of clean material were air dried onto  

1 cm-diameter circular pieces of aluminium foil. These stubs were coated with gold using a 

JEOL JFC-1200 Sputter Coater. A JEOL JSM-5200LV electron microscope operating at 15/25 kV 

and 20 mm distance was used for the analysis, and digital images were directly captured. At 



DIATOM-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF IBERIAN COASTAL 
ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALES 

 2013

 

22 
 

UDC, aliquots of treated material were air dried onto 2.5 cm-diameter circular pieces of 

aluminium foil. These stubs were then coated with gold-palladium using a BAL-TEC SCD 004 

Sputter Coater. A JEOL JSM 6400 electron microscope operating at 5/30 kV and 20 mm 

distance was used for SEM analysis and digital images were obtained.  

The identification of diatoms was based on the floras of Krammer &amp;amp; Lange-Bertalot (1986-

1991), Lange-Bertalot (1993), Snoeijs (1993), Snoeijs &amp;amp; Vilbaste (1994), Lange-Bertalot &amp;amp; Gert 

(1994), Snoeijs &amp;amp; Potapova (1995), Snoeijs &amp;amp; Kasperovi?iené (1996), Krammer (1997a, b), 

Snoeijs &amp;amp; Balashova (1998), Witkowski et al. (2000), Morales (2001, 2002) and Lange-Bertalot 

(2000-2003). 

A minimum of 400 valves per sample were counted following random transects under the 

microscope. The categories considered for counting followed Schrader &amp;amp; Gersonde (1978). 

Raw counts were converted to relative frequencies, that is, the proportion of individual taxa 

relative to the total diatom count in the sample, and expressed as percentages. In the cases of 

the cores collected at Melides and Traba, the vertical (downcore) data on diatom abundances 

were displayed in the form of stratigraphical diagrams constructed using the C2 v.1.5.1 

software (Juggins, 2007).  

3.3.3 SEDIMENTOLOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS 

3.3.3.1 Core sediments 

3.3.3.1.1 Sedimentology 

Cores TRA07-A2 and LM6-2 were sampled every 1 or 2 cm for different types of sediment 

analysis. Samples from core LM6-2 were analysed for pH, % organic matter, % calcium 

carbonate and texture. TRA 07-A2 samples were used only for textural analysis. 

pH was determined by the electrometric method according to the Portuguese standard E 203 

(LNEC, 1967). For the determination of the organic matter content loss on ignition was 

performed using an oven burning at 500 ?C for 2 hours. The calcium carbonate content was 

determined gasometrically using an Eijkelkamp calcimetre. The size separation of the fractions 

above and below 63 ?m was performed by wet sieving using a 4 ? sieve. This procedure 

allowed the textural classification of sediments according to Flemming (2000). Fraction below 

63µm was analysed by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser. All these analyses 

were performed at GeoFCUL. 

In core TRA07-A2, the size separation of the fractions above and below 63?m was performed 

by wet sieving using a 4 ? sieve in UDC. Textural classification of sediments was done following 

Flemming (2000). Fraction below 63 µm was also analysed at GeoFCUL, using a Malvern 

Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser. 

3.3.3.1.2 Carbon, Nitrogen and Sulphur Contents 

In both cores, the percentages of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) were determined by 

combustion of dry sediment at 1050 °C, using an elemental analyser equipment EuroVector, 

mod. EuroEA 3000, at GeoFCUL for core LM6-2 and LECO elemental autoanalyzer mod. 1000

23 
 

for TRA07-A1, at UDC. Total organic carbon (TOC) in core samples of both sites was estimated 

as the difference between TC and total inorganic carbon (TIC), the latter measured by weight 

difference before and after incineration of the sample at 450 °C during 4 hours (Cambardella et 

al., 2001). In this work, TN was considered equal to total organic nitrogen (TON), since in most 

sedimentary materials the fraction of inorganic nitrogen is negligible (Müller &amp;amp; Mathesius, 

1999). 

For both cores, TOC, TN, and the ratio of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in organic matter 

(?
13

Corg and ?
15

Norg respectively) were determined using samples taken every 2 cm and pre-

treated with HCl at 4 mol L
-1

 to remove inorganic carbon, followed by repeated washing with 

distilled water until neutrality. Analyses were made in a FlashEA1112 elemental combustion 

analyser (ThermoFinnigan), coupled with a DELTAplus isotope ratio mass spectrometer 

(ThermoFinningan) at the SAI-UDC. The results obtained for TOC and TN were converted to the 

total sample in TRA07. In LM6-3 core, the bulk sample was not weighted prior to analyses. To 

overcome this drawback, a sensitive analysis was conducted using % CaCO3 data obtained in 

LM6-1. Results show that for a range of % CaCO3 &amp;lt;10 %, the converted TOC/TN (referenced as 

Corg/Ntotal) values never exceeded 12 (maximum value of unconverted Corg/Ntotal) and 

differences to unconverted Corg/Ntotal were less than 1 unit. Although absolute TOC values may 

be different, the interpretations of Corg/Ntotal ratios remain unchanged. 

In core TRA07-A1 the percentage of total sulphur (TS) was measured by combustion at 1200 °C 

in a LECO mod. SC 144DR autoanalyzer at the laboratories of the Departamento de Edafoloxía 

e Química Agrícola from the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela.

CNRS 5805 Environnements et Paléoenvironnements Océanique et Continentaux (EPOC), using 

gamma spectroscopy and 11 samples from TRA07-A1 at the University College Dublin School of 

Physics (Ireland). 

Additionally, three samples of organic sediment from LM6-3 (taken at 87.5, 44.5 and 34.5 cm 

depth) and other three from TRA-07-A2 (taken at 94, 36 and 28 cm depth), were dated by the 
14

C method (Björck &amp;amp; Wohlfarth, 2001) using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Analyses 

were carried out at Beta Analytic Inc. (Florida, USA) for LM6-3 and at the Poznan Radiocarbon 

Laboratory (Poland) for TRA-07-A2. 

 

3.4 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 

The statistical study of the relationship between diatom assemblages in present-day bottom 

sediments and environmental variables measured in the water column is one of the main goals 

of this work. The objective is to use this knowledge to make precise quantitative inferences of 

past hydrochemical conditions from the fossil diatom assemblages found in the cores. To 

achieve this, different types of multivariate data analyses were performed, as described below.

3.4.1 THE PRESENT-DAY DATA-SET  

The present-day data-set consists of water column environmental data and abundance data of 

the main taxa making up diatom assemblages in present-day bottom sediments (Appendix I 

and IIA). Average values of the water column environmental data were used in the numerical 

analyses. These values were log (x+1) transformed for regression and calibration (except for pH 

values). For the case of diatoms, only those taxa with abundance ? 2 % and occurring in two or 

more samples were included in the analyses, to minimize the influence of rare taxa. This 

reduced the data-set from 386 to 46 taxa, and the abundance values (percentages) were 

further squared root-transformed for regression and calibration (see section 3.4.1.2.1 below).  

3.4.1.1 Environmental data 

3.4.1.1.1 Variance inflation analysis 

Some of the variables integrating the environmental data-set may be correlated (for example, 

salinity and conductivity), thus contributing to undesirable multi-collinearity effects, a 

statistical property in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are 

highly correlated. In order to reduce redundancy introduced by multi-collinearity effects, the 

environmental data-set was studied for the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), as implemented in 

the CANOCO 4.5 computer program (ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2002). VIF measures the proportion 

by which the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated in the presence of other 

explanatory variables (Boccard et al., 2011). Higher VIF values indicate existence of more 

collinear variables in the model and VIF &amp;lt;10 (the threshold value used in this study) is 

considered sufficiently low as to avoid collinearity effects. 

3.4.1.2 Diatom and Environmental data 

3.4.1.2.1 Diatom-based Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions 

One of the goals of this work is to evaluate ecological optima and tolerance of diatom 

assemblages of the present-day data-set to construct transfer functions that allow 

palaeoenvironmental conditions to be quantitatively inferred from fossil assemblages data 

(Birks et al., 1990). Besides these quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, a 

qualitative approach based on the known autocologies of the diatom taxa has also been 

adopted. Autoecological information on life-forms, saline affinities and pH, among others, was 

mainly obtained from dter Braake Wolf (1982), Kjemperud (1982), Denys (1991a, b), Vos &amp;amp; de 

Wolf (1993b), Snoeijs (1993), Snoeijs &amp;amp; Vilbaste (1994), Van Dam et al. (1994), Snoeijs &amp;amp; 

Potapova (1995), Snoeijs &amp;amp; Kasperovi?iené (1996) and Snoeijs &amp;amp; Balashova (1998). 

Both diatom and environmental data were first analysed using clustering methods in order to 

recognize similarities that could finally lead to groups for both data-sets. Following this 

procedure, an evaluation of the ecological optima and tolerance of diatom assemblages from 

the present data-set was made to construct transfer functions. This procedure involves two 

steps: (1) the regression step, in which the responses of taxa to the contemporary 

environment are modelled, and (2) a calibration step, in which the environmental variable of 

interest is predicted from the fossil compositional data (Birks, 1995; Birks et al., 2012).

3.4.1.2.1.1 Cluster Analysis 

Cluster analysis was used to examine the whole set of environments addressed in this study 

according to their affinities with respect to both the diatom assemblages and sample location 

data. Cluster analysis followed the Ward’s method (Ward, 1963) and Gower distance matrix 

(Gower, 1971), using the functions hclust and vegedist included in the vegan package 1.17-6 

(Oksanen et al., 2011) of the R software (R Development Core Team, 2010). A total height cut-

off of 20 and 17 was used for diatom and sample grouping, respectively. 

3.4.1.2.1.2 Transfer Function 

3.4.1.2.1.2.1 Regression and Calibration 

The mathematical methods for establishing transfer functions are commonly based on 

linear/monotonic or nonlinear (unimodal) regression techniques (Birks, 2012). Hill &amp;amp; Gauch 

(1980) defined the length of the gradient of variation in biological data as the range of the 

sample scores obtained from a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). If the gradient 

length is short (2 standard deviation units or less), taxa generally behave monotonically  

(i. e., they have a linear response) along the gradient (ter Braak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988; Birks, 1995); 

otherwise, if the gradient length is larger (2 standard deviation units or more), several taxa will 

have their optima located within the gradient, and use of unimodal-based models of 

regression and calibration is more appropriate. In this study, the CANOCO 4.5 computer 

program (Ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2002) was used to perform the data analyses. 

In cases showing a linear response of the diatoms to the environmental gradients, regression 

and calibration techniques such as classical linear regression, inverse linear regression or 

partial least (PLS) or redundancy analysis (RDA) can be used (Birks, 1995; Birks et al., 2012). If a 

unimodal distribution is assumed as more representative of the data-set, then regression and 

calibration may be achieved using techniques such as weighted averaging (WA, ter Braak, 

1987; ter Braak &amp;amp; Van Dam, 1989), correspondence analysis (CA, ter Braak, 1987), canonical 

correspondence analysis (CCA, ter Braak, 1986) or weighted averaging –partial least squares 

(WA-PLS, ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins 1993). 

As will be shown later, the diatom responses found in this study agree with a unimodal 

response model, thus various (unimodal) non-linear regression and calibration methods were 

used. Canonical Correspondence Analysis regression (CCA) is a multivariate method to 

elucidate the relationships between biological assemblages (species) and their environment. 

The method is designed to extract synthetic environmental gradients from ecological  

data-sets. A good indicator for assessing the viability of an environmental variable selected to 

construct transfer functions is the ratio of ?1 to ?2, the first two eigenvalues of partial CCA (ter 

Braak, 1988; Hall &amp;amp; Smol, 1992). Variables exhibiting high ?1/?2 ratio (&gt; 1) generally produce 

strong calibration models, but lower ratios can still be of use in the construction of transfer 

functions provided that care is taken in ecological interpretation (ter Braak, 1987, 1988). The 

statistical significance of the 1
st

 axis and of all canonical axes was assessed by unrestricted 

Monte Carlo tests (full model) involving 999 permutations at p ? 0.05. 

A series of partial CCAs was then performed. Each run considered one explanatory variable at a 

time to establish the significance and relative strength of its contribution to the total variance

26 
 

found in diatom data. Variance partitioning was performed by additional partial CCAs where 

the effects of other variables were removed, or partialled out, by including them as 

covariables, to establish: (1) the unique contribution of individual chemical gradients, (2) the 

contribution due to interactions between gradients, and (3) the unexplained variance (Gasse et 

al., 1995). The amount of variation explained in each case was transformed into percentages 

by dividing the sum of canonical eigenvalues by the total inertia, according to the procedure 

described by Borcard et al. (1992). The statistical significance of each explanatory variable was 

assessed by unrestricted Monte Carlo tests (full model) involving 999 permutations at p ? 0.05. 

All analyses were performed using the CANOCO 4.5 computer program (ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 

2002). 

After CCA validation, diatom taxon responses (optima and tolerances) were modelled, using 

WA with C2 v.1.5.1 (Juggins, 2007). 

The most popular models of calibration for unimodal distributions used in diatom studies are 

Weighted Averaging (WA; ter Braak &amp;amp; Van Dam, 1989) and the WA partial least squares 

(WAPLS; ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993), because they perform well in cases considering noisy, 

species-rich, compositional data, with many zero values and some outliers. Both models were 

tested using the program C2 v.1.5.1 (Juggins, 2007). In both approaches, the underlying 

response model is the Gaussian function, that is, each taxon is assumed to follow a bell-shaped 

distribution along an environmental variable. 

For reconstruction purposes, it is essential to estimate the gradient length for the 

environmental variables(s) of interest. This can be assessed by Detrended Canonical 

Correspondence Analysis (DCCA, ter Braak, 1986) constrained to that particular environmental 

variable (Birks, 1995). If the gradient is short (2 standard deviation units or less) taxa generally 

behave monotonically along the gradient (ter Braak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988). If the gradient length is 

larger (more than 2 standard deviation units), several taxa will have their optima located 

within the gradient, and unimodal-based models of regression and calibration are considered 

more appropriate. CANOCO 4.5 computer program (ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2002) was used for 

these tasks. 

Validation of the models can be addressed by analysing the different statistical parameters 

extracted by cross-validation procedures (ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993) like jack-knifing 

(Quenouille, 1949) and/or bootstrapping (Efron, 1979): coefficient of determination (r
2
), 

apparent root mean square error (RMSE), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), mean 

and maximum bias. Ideally, the best models should yield high r
2
 and low RMSEP values when 

compared to the variable range and low mean and maximum bias values based on cross-

validation (ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993). 

Jack-knifing (also known as ‘leave-one-out’ measures) is a cross-validation method that 

provides more reliable measures of the overall predictive ability of the data-set, at least when 

applied to the modern assemblages (Sejrup et al., 2004). However, it does not provide sample-

specific errors for the environmental variable chosen for reconstruction of each core sample 

(Birks, 1995). Bootstrapping can be used to derive a standard error of prediction (SEpred; Birks

27 
 

et al., 1990), which varies from sample to sample depending upon the composition of the core 

assemblage and the presence or absence of taxa with a particularly strong signal for the 

environmental variable of interest (Birks, 1995). Also, the optimal number of components for 

WA-PLS to include in the transfer functions can be assessed by leave-one-out. In the present 

case, these validations were undertaken with the C2 v.1.5.1 (Juggins, 2007) software 

environment. 

3.4.2 CORE DATA 

3.4.2.1 Sedimentology, Geochemistry and Diatoms 

The core data-sets (Traba and Melides) consist of diatom abundance and sedimentological and 

geochemical data. Sedimentological and diatom abundance data were subject to numerical 

analyses, aiming to: i) establish contrasting Sedimentological and Diatom Assemblage Zones 

and ii) use sedimentology data and diatom assemblages to identify the essential underlying 

palaeoenvironmental changes and/or trends. To minimize the influence of diatom rare taxa, 

only diatom taxa with abundance ? 2 % and occurring in at least one sample were selected for 

the analyses (Appendix IIB and C). 

The concept of Diatom Assemblage Zone (DAZ) is inspired on the concepts of Fossil 

Assemblage Zone and Fossil Abundance Zone (Murphy &amp;amp; Salvador, 1999). A DAZ may be 

defined as the body of strata characterized by an assemblage of diatoms in which the 

abundance of a particular taxon or specified group of taxa is significantly greater than is usual 

in the adjacent parts of the stratigraphic section. In this study, the definition of the main DAZs 

in the diatom abundance diagrams was performed using stratigraphically-constrained cluster 

analysis (Constrained Incremental Sum of Squares Clustering, CONISS, Grimm, 1987), based on 

squared Euclidian dissimilarity, computed using the packages vegan version 1.17-6 (Oksanen et 

al., 2011) and Rioja version 0.5-6 (Juggins, 2009) developed for the R software (R Development 

Core Team, 2010). Zonation with variances exceeding values generated by a broken-stick 

model of the distribution of variance was deemed statistically significant (Bennett, 1996). 

Clustering obtained from cluster analysis was also used for the definition of subzones. Total 

dispersion cut-offs of 200 and 600, obtained from cluster analyses were used for the definition 

of subzones in Traba and Melides, respectively. The sedimentological data were also processed 

using the methodologies described above to obtain a sedimentological/litoestratigraphical 

zonation and help in the definition of sedimentological units, using a total dispersion cut-offs 

of 1100 and 155 for the definition of sedimentary subzones in Traba and Melides, respectively. 

Ordination analyses were conducted to identify the main environmental gradients explaining 

the variability in diatom abundance. For both Melides and Traba, data matrices contain few 

zero values, so classical ordination methods were used. A DCA was first performed to estimate 

the length of the dominant gradient for the diatom assemblages and thus to evaluate whether 

the taxa followed a unimodal or linear distribution (Jongman et al., 1987). The CANOCO 4.5 

computer program (ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2002) was used for this. As explained above, when 

the obtained length of gradients was larger than 2 standard deviations, a unimodal distribution 

was assumed (ter Braak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988) and a CA was performed. For length gradients of less 

than 2 standard deviations, the response of the diatoms was considered monotonic/linear, and

a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Lepš &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2003), was performed. Both analyses 

were run using the C2 program, v. 1.5.1 (Juggins, 2007). 

3.4.2.2 Plot of passive samples in CCA  

Core samples from Melides and Traba were plotted as supplementary passive samples 

(i. e., not influencing on the ordination) on the biplot of the CCA that relates the present-day 

diatom assemblages of the WIAC with the main present-day environmental gradients. These 

plots were used to help in understanding the underlying trajectories of environmental change 

when interpreting the fossil data (Birks et al., 1990; ter Braak &amp;amp; Šmilauer, 2002). Fossil diatom 

abundance data were squared root transformed. 

3.4.2.3 Transfer functions 

After assessing the best model to use in calibration (section 3.4.1.2.1.2.1), the selected model 

was applied to the core data. Sample-specific errors of the environmental variable chosen for 

reconstruction of each core sample were computed by bootstrapping (Birks et al., 1990). Then, 

a validation of reconstructed environmental values was undertaken. The most powerful 

validation method is to compare reconstructions with historical records (e. g., Fritz, 1990; Laird 

et al., 1996; Lotter, 1998), which is limited to the recent past; the second best procedure is to 

compare reconstructions with independent palaeoenvironmental data (Fritz et al., 1994). 

Since the original data-set was processed using a log (x+1) transformation, reconstruction of  

palaeoenvironmental variables was achieved using an inverse transformation.

Results obtained from the vertical profiles of

Cs activities, as well as from the AMS

C dating, allowed to develop an age model by fitting the age–depth data with linear 

interpolation between neighbouring levels using the clam code version 2.1 routine (Blaauw, 

2010) developed for the software R (R Development Core Team, 2010). This routine calibrates 

radiocarbon ages using the standard IntCal09 calibration curve (Stuiver et al., 1998; Reimer et 

al., 2009) and generates Monte Carlo age–depth fits through the calibrated age probability 

distributions. It then calculates the ‘best-fit’ age-depth curve as the weighted average of 1000 

iterations. The confidence intervals are calculated at the 2 ? range centred at the mean value 

of the iterations.

4.1.1 INTRODUCTION 

Most of the estuaries and coastal wetlands of the Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC) have 

been originated after c. 5500 cal yr BP (calibrated years before Present) as a result of the late 

Holocene sea-level rise deceleration (e. g., Bao et al., 1999, 2007; Freitas et al., 1999, 2002a, 

2003a; Cearreta et al., 2003; Freitas &amp;amp; Andrade, 2005; Dinis et al., 2006, Costas et al., 2009; 

González-Villanueva et al., 2009). Since their origin, they have been affected by both global 

(eustatism, climate) and local (sediment availability and fluvial basin changes, anthropic 

influence) forcing factors occurring at different time scales. Whereas global drivers of change 

were mainly responsible for the early evolution of these systems, the relative importance of 

local factors have increased in more recent times (Freitas et al., 2002a; Dinis et al., 2006; Leorri 

et al., 2013). 

The use of microfossils was decisive in the multidisciplinary palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions that lead to the knowledge of the controlling factors on the Holocene 

evolution of the transitional environments from the WIAC (e. g., Santos et al., 2001; Ramalho, 

2003; Santos &amp;amp; Sánchez-Goñi, 2003; Cearreta et al., 2003, 2007; Cabral et al., 2006; Drago et 

al., 2006; Naughton et al., 2007b; Danielsen, 2008; Gomes et al., 2012; Leorri et al., 2013). 

Among these, diatoms have proven to be particularly useful (Bao et al., 1999, 2007; Santos et 

al., 2001; Cearreta et al., 2003; Granja et al., 2010), but whereas precise quantitative 

palaeoenvironmental reconstructions could be accomplished elsewhere (Cooper et al., 2010; 

Snoeijs &amp;amp; Weckström, 2010), interpretation of the Ibero Atlantic Holocene diatom records 

have always been qualitative (e. g., Bao et al., 1999, 2007; Santos et al., 2001; Ferreira, 2006; 

Santos, 2010), based on autoecological data from other regions (e. g., Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993a, 

b). 

Understanding the relationship between present-day dead diatom assemblages 

(thanatocoenoses) and the environmental variables that control their distribution, is a key 

factor for quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (Birks, 2012). In spite of the fact 

that quantitative studies performed on continental aquatic ecosystems are much more 

common than those carried out on marine or coastal areas (Mackay et al., 2003), some 

present-day calibration data-sets have been established for different types of coastal systems 

and geographical areas. Hence, transfer functions have been developed for the reconstruction

of changes in salinity and conductivity (e. g., Juggins, 1992; Roberts et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 

2009; Wachnicka et al., 2010; Zong et al., 2010; Espinosa et al., 2012), pH (Denys, 2006), 

nutrients (Clarke et al., 2003; Weckström et al., 2004), tidal and sea-level (Zong &amp;amp; Horton, 

1999; Horton et al., 2007), elevation (Sawai et al., 2004), water depth (Campeau et al., 1999; 

Ng &amp;amp; Sin, 2003) or dissolved inorganic carbon (Denys, 2006). For the case of changes in salinity 

and conductivity, precise inferences are however hindered by the fact that diatoms adapt to a 

wide range of conditions in brackish and marine habitats (Denys &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1999). 

Few studies have examined the present-day distribution patterns of diatoms in the Ibero 

Atlantic coastal systems and their relationship with the main environmental gradients 

(Sampayo, 1970; Gameiro, 2009; Ribeiro, 2010; Ribeiro et al., 2003, 2013; Resende et al., 2005, 

2007; Mendes et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2010; Gomes et al., 2012), and they have been of 

limited geographical extent (Lagoa de Albufeira e Santo André), and mainly focussed on the 

study of estuaries (Aveiro, Tagus, Sado and Guadiana). It has been shown that, at least for the 

reconstruction of palaeotidal levels, application of regional transfer functions should be 

preferred rather than those constructed from local training-sets (Wilson &amp;amp; Lamb, 2012). It is 

therefore necessary to complete our knowledge of the present-day diatom assemblages and 

their relationship with the physical and chemical environment in a broader geographic extent 

and arranging a wider set of coastal ecosystems for more precise palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions in the future.  

This chapter shows how diatom assemblages in present-day bottom sediments of different 

types of aquatic systems from the Galician and Portuguese coast respond to mg L
-1

 the main 

environmental gradients. From this knowledge, a transfer function for water salinity in the 

WIAC has been derived. 

4.1.2 DATA 

The original data-set incorporates data from 25 bottom sediment samples belonging to 18 

transitional systems of the WIAC (Fig. 2.1, Table 2.1, Chapter 2). For each bottom sediment 

sample, diatom abundance and associated environmental data were collected. Only diatom 

taxa observed in ? 2 % abundance and occurring in two or more samples were included in the 

subsequent data analysis to minimize the influence of rare taxa, reducing the total 398 to 46 

taxa. The environmental data consisted on measurements of 21 water variables (Table 4.1.1) 

taken at the place where the bottom sediments were collected. Raw environmental and 

diatom abundances data are presented in appendixes I and IIA, respectively, as well as diatom 

plates in appendix IIIA.

4.1.3 RESULTS 

4.1.3.1 Environmental Variables and Diatom Species Distributional Patterns 

4.1.3.1.1 Environmental data 

The study of the 21 water variables (environmental variables) shows that the WIAC 

environments comprise a large spectrum of characteristics (Table 4.1.1).  

The average water temperature ranges from 12.8 °C in Barbaroxa de Baixo to 26.0 °C in Illa de 

Arousa. Average pH values correspond to water bodies varying from slightly acid to strongly 

alkaline (6.16 at Barbaroxa de Baixo to 9.32 at Vela). Considering the mean values, all the 

environments are oxidant (Eh varies between 0.50, at Louro and 212.30 at Muro), with the 

exception of Valdoviño (Eh= -75.10). Although this is not the only negative value measured 

between 2007 and 2008, the average values for each sample yielded positive values. In this 

context, average Eh values must be carefully taken in to account since their values range 

widely and can therefore bias the average result. The average salinity and conductivity varies 

from 0.13 ‰ and 0.23 mS cm
-1

 in Doniños (freshwater) to 34.93 ‰ and 81.88 mS cm
-1

 in the 

low marsh of the Mira estuary (saline water). There is a distinct division between the Galician 

and Portuguese environments in terms of salinity/conductivity, being the Galician sites 

predominantly freshwater or slightly brackish (with the exception of Valdoviño an open 

lagoon, and Louro) and the Portuguese environments, being mainly brackish (with the 

exception of Barbaroxa de Baixo and Vela, two freshwater coastal pond and lake respectively). 

Most of the environments constitute, according to dissolved oxygen (D.O.) concentrations, a

4.1.3.1.2 Diatom abundance data 

The final diatom data-set consisted of 398 taxa, from which only those with an abundance 

 ?2 % in at least two samples were considered for study. This resulted in a total of 46 diatom 

taxa, from which 26 occurred at maximum abundances over 10 %. Most of the diatoms 

occurring at high relative abundances were epiphytes, such as Achnanthidium minutissimum 

(Kützing) Czarnecki, although the tychoplanktonic Pseudostaurosira trainorii Morales, is the 

taxon displaying the highest relative abundance (72.8 % at Louro). These two species, with 

Nitzschia frustulum (Kützing) Grunow in Cleve &amp;amp; Grunow, are the most common and abundant 

in the data-set. Frequent, but not so abundant diatoms, are Cocconeis neodiminuta Krammer, 

Cocconeis placentula var. placentula Ehrenberg, Cocconeis placentula var. lineata (Ehrenberg) 

van Heurck and Synedra tabulata (Agardh) Kützing. Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) Williams 

&amp;amp; Round and Gomphonemopsis obscurum (Krasske) Lange-Bertalot acquire high percentage 

values (up to more than 50 %), but are less represented in the data-set than the previous taxa. 

Euplanktonic diatoms (mainly represented by Cyclotella comensis Grunow and Cyclotella 

meneghiniana Kützing) have a very limited importance in the diatom assemblages (mean 

percentage is 0.99 %). 

Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis using Gower distance (Gower, 1971) and Ward 

method (Ward, 1963) was used to classify the diatom species (Fig. 4.1.1), as well as the 

samples, according to their relative abundance data (Fig. 4.1.2). The analyses produced three 

main groups of samples (Fig. 4.1.2). Group I is composed by coastal lakes and ponds from both 

the Galician and Portuguese coast. Tychoplanktonic and epiphytic (Group A) diatoms (e. g., 

Pseudostaurosira trainorii, Achnanthidium minutissimum and Cocconeis placentula var.

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

placentula) are the main contributors to the diatom assemblages of this group. Group II is 

composed by estuaries from northern Portugal and a single Galician coastal lake (Doniños). 

These locations are mainly characterized by epipsammic and epiphytic (Group B) diatoms  

(e. g., Planothidium delicatulum (Kützing) Round &amp;amp; Bukhtiyarova, Planothidium aff. 

engelbrechtii (Cholnoky) Round &amp;amp; Bukhtiyarova, and Navicula paul-schulzii Witkowski et 

Lange-Bertalot. Finally, all the Portuguese lagoons and Sado estuary are clustered in Group III, 

where epiphytic (Group C) diatoms are dominant (e. g., Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta 

(Ehrenberg) Cleve, Cocconeis costata Gregory var. costata and Rhopalodia brebissonii 

Krammer), plus the relevant contribution of a tychoplanktonic form (Staurosirella pinnata) in 

Santo André.

4.1.3.2 Diatom species – Environmental variables Relationships  

4.1.3.2.1 Canonical Correspondence Analysis 

A Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was first performed to estimate the length of the 

dominant gradient for the diatom assemblages and thus to evaluate whether the taxa followed 

a unimodal or linear distribution (Birks, 1995). The obtained length of axis 1 was 4.085 

standard deviation (SD) units, which suggests a unimodal response of the diatom assemblages 

to the environmental gradients (Ter Braak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988; Birks, 1995). According to this 

result, a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed to further explore the 

relationship between the diatom assemblages and the main environmental gradients. 

Results of the CCA applied to the 9 explanatory environmental variables and diatom data 

indicates that axes 1 (?1 = 0.577) and 2 (?2 = 0.472) captured 48.3 % of the variance in taxa 

composition (Table 4.1.3). The species-environment correlations of CCA axis 1 (0.961) and  

axis 2 (0.927) are very high. The results of the CCA have also been displayed in the form of a 

biplot, where these environmental variables are depicted by arrows, and species and locations 

by dots (Fig. 4.1.3). The relative importance of each variable in explaining the composition of 

the diatom assemblages is indicated by the length of its arrow, whereas its direction shows the 

relationship to the two CCA axes (Ter Braak, 1987). According to this ordination diagram, axis 1 

is representing the salinity, pH and PO4
3-

 gradient, and axis 2 the availability in NO3
- 
and DOC. 

The test of significance for axis 1 (p = 0.018) and all canonical ordination axis (p = 0.004) is 

significant (p ? 0.05).

and therefore account for a significant portion of the total variance in the diatom data. The 

CCA biplot shows that salinity is the environmental variable that account for most of the 

variability in the data, followed by PO4

 (axis 2).

4.1.3.2.2 Variance partitioning 

Variance partitioning decomposes the total variability into a part that can be explained solely 

by each variable (% independent variance). Table 4.1.4 shows the contributions of each 

variable to the total variance in the diatom data, but also the independent variation explained 

solely by each variable. This is calculated by variation partitioning assessed by partial CCA’s, 

measured with one explanatory variable each time and with co-variables. The 9 environmental 

variables showed a total explained variance of 56.56 % of the diatom data, where DOC, PO4
3-

, 

salinity and NO3
-
 contributed with higher independent explained variances. As a result, four 

major hydrochemical gradients, i. e., salinity, phosphorous (PO4
3-

) and nitrogen (NO3
-
) 

availability, as well as organic load (DOC) are identified.

Once the main environmental gradients that rule the composition of the diatom assemblages 

are identified, they can be tested for their suitability to produce quantitative inference models 

for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. A good indicator for assessing the viability of the 

environmental variables selected to construct transfer functions is the ratio of ?1 to ?2, the 

first two eigenvalues of partial CCA (Ter Braak, 1988; Hall &amp;amp; Smol, 1992). Variables with high 

?1/?2 ratios (e. g., &gt;1) generally produce strong calibration models, but variables with lower 

ratios can still be used in transfer function development if caution is taken in the 

palaeoecological interpretations (Ter Braak, 1987; Ter Braak, 1988). Table 4.1.4 shows that 

salinity has the lowest p value, the highest total explained variance (after variation 

partitioning), and the ?1/?2 ratio closest to 1 among the variables. It is also highly related with 

axis 1, which is significant, and explains 26.7 % of the relation between variables and species. 

For these reasons, salinity has been chosen as the variable that would perform better for the 

construction of quantitative inference models for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

4.1.3.2.3 Transfer function for salinity - Regression and Calibration 

In order to determine whether a unimodal or linear response model would perform better 

with the existing training set (i. e., the diatom abundance data from the present-day bottom 

sediments plus the  environmental data from the water column; Birks, 2012), the gradient 

length of the first canonical axis constrained to salinity was estimated with a Detrended 

Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). If the gradient length is greater than 2 SD units, 

assumption of a unimodal response model is considered the most appropriate for any further 

data analysis, whereas a linear response model is more suited when gradient length is smaller 

than 2 SD units (Birks, 1995). The gradient length for the training set was 3.208 SD units, 

indicating that unimodal calibration models can be used for the reconstruction of salinity in 

the Western Iberian Atlantic coastal systems. Therefore, the following unimodal calibration 

models were tested: Two-way Weighted Averaging (WA) and Weighted Averaging-Partial Least 

Squares Regression (WA-PLS) (Ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993). 

WA is first used to obtain salinity species optima and tolerances, as well as the number of 

occurrences of each taxon (N) and Hill's N2 (number of effective occurrences; Hill, 1973) (Table 

4.1.5). The latter gives an indication of the number of samples contributing to the calculation 

of a taxon's WA optima. Optima estimated for taxa with a low number of occurrences or a low 

N2 should be interpreted with caution (Gasse et al., 1995). Taxa with N &gt; 3 and/or N2 &gt; 2 can 

be considered more reliable for reconstruction, as it is the case in our data of Planothidium 

delicatulum, Ctenophora pulchella (Ralfs ex Kützing) Williams &amp;amp; Round, Cyclotella 

meneghiniana and Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta (Table 4.1.5). 

According to the estimated salinity optima and tolerances, diatom taxa show in the WIAC a 

wide saline distribution, from oligohalobous halophobous to polyhalobous (Hustedt, 1953), 

tolerating salinities ranging from 0.42 to 31.98 ‰. Taxa located at both ends of the diagram 

showed the narrowest tolerance ranges (Fig. 4.1.4).

Fig. 4.1.4 - Plot of the WA salinity optima and tolerances of diatom taxa (Table 4.1.5). See

According to the performance of the several salinity transfer functions models developed with 

validation using jack-knifing method Quenouille (1949) (Table 4.1.6), the components 4 and 5 

of the WA–PLS model appear to perform better than WA, since they showed the highest 

r

the lowest root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) RMSEPjack-knifed (0.39 and 0.40, 

respectively) and the lowest maximum deviation (0.47 and 0.48 respectively). Component 4 

WA–PLS model was chosen for the final reconstruction of salinity since it presents lower values 

of RMSEPJack-knifed (0.39) than component 5. Bootstrapping (Efron, 1979) cross-validation 

statistic method was used to derive the standard error of prediction (SEP, Birks et al., 1990) of 

the reconstructed salinity to be used in core samples. Scatterplots of observed against

4.1.4 DISCUSSION 

4.1.4.1 Environmental variables and diatom species distribution patterns 

The studied environments of the WIAC are characterized by a large range of physico-chemical 

conditions. Along this spectrum, diatom assemblages are dominated by benthic and 

tychoplanktonic diatoms of freshwater to brackish/marine affinities. Many of the taxa found as 

dead assemblages in this study of bottom sediments have previously been reported in studies 

of benthic diatom biocoenoses of this coastline (Resende et al., 2005, 2007; Ribeiro, 2010; 



DIATOM-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF IBERIAN COASTAL 
ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

 2013

 

46 
 

Gomes et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2013). This suggests that diatoms of the dead assemblages in 

bottom sediments are a reliable image of the taxonomic composition of the biocoenoses they 

come from. The dominance of periphytic taxa and almost absence of euplanktonic forms is 

certainly related to the predominance of very shallow water bodies throughout the region. 

Only Albufeira (Portugal) and Doniños (Galicia) surpass a maximum water depth of 5 m. The 

sampled sites are therefore good representations of the shallow or marginal habitats of the 

region. As a result, caution should be taken with the use of the modern analogues of these 

systems for the quantitative or qualitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction where pelagic 

environments prevail. 

Results of cluster analysis show that freshwater coastal lakes and ponds, and restricted 

lagoons, environments mainly present in the Galician coast, are characterized by 

brackish/freshwater to freshwater epiphytic and tychoplanktonic diatoms such as 

Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cocconeis placentula and Pseudostaurosira trainorii (de Wolf, 

1982; Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993b; Morales, 2001). By contrast, the lagoons of the Portuguese coast, 

more connected to the ocean, show a more diverse assemblage of dominant diatoms, 

probably as a result of the less stable conditions in these environments. Consequently, they 

are characterized by diatoms ranging from freshwater to purely brackish affinities of a mainly 

epiphytic character such as Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Cocconeis costata var. costata, 

Gomphonemopsis obscurum or Rhopalodia brebissonii (de Wolf, 1982; Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993b; 

Snoeijs, 1993; Witkowski et al., 2000). An epipelic diatom typical of estuarine conditions, 

Nitzschia frustulum, acts also as a good indicator of these kinds of environments (Rovira et al., 

2012). The inclusion of Sado in this group, which is the biggest studied Portuguese estuary, 

makes sense, since it has been considered more closely related to lagoons and not to estuaries 

due to its low river discharge (e. g., Ferreira et al., 2005). Finally, true estuaries belonging to 

the Portuguese coast are mainly characterized by two closely related taxa. Planothidium 

delicatulum is a marine/brackish epipsammic diatom, whereas Planothidium aff. engelbrechtii, 

in spite of its still not definite taxonomic identity, can very likely be considered as an 

epipsammic salt-loving diatom because of its close resemblance to Planothidium engelbrechtii 

(Robinson, 2004). The indicator value of epipsammic diatoms in this group is surely a reflection 

of the coarser nature of the estuarine sediments in the whole studied area (Ferreira, 

unpublished data). It is also known that epipsammic diatoms are a common component in the 

sandflats of the Tagus estuary (Ribeiro et al., 2013). Another species characteristic of this  

group is  

Navicula paul-schulzii, an epipelic diatom, which has been defined as typical of water bodies 

characterised by continuous freshwater inputs with high nutrient contents (Trobajo, 2005), a 

distinct feature of the estuarine ecosystems. Quite surprising is the inclusion of the freshwater 

coastal lake of Doniños in this group. The site sampled in this system showed a high abundance 

of not only the typical Planothidium delicatulum and Planothidium aff. engelbrechtii, that 

characterize the group it belongs to, but also of Cocconeis neodiminuta, a diatom that is also 

present in the estuaries of Minho and Lima. This assemblage can however be considered 

atypical for this system for several reasons. First, the lake has a maximum depth of 11 m and 

pelagic, instead of periphytic habitats, are more represented in it. Present-day diatom

assemblages on the deeper parts are dominated by Aulacoseira spp. Thwaites, Fragilaria 

crotonensis Kitton and Achnanthidium minutissimum (Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, pers. comm.). On the 

other hand, the marginal environments are dominated by species such as Achnanthidium 

minutissimum, Cocconeis placentula and Fragilaria capucina Desmazière, the latter a 

freshwater tychoplanktonic diatom (Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, pers. comm.). A combination of factors 

might explain the prevalence of the mesohaline epipsammic taxa that were found in Doniños 

during the sampling for this thesis in 2007. The marginal area where the sampling took place is, 

at the present, dominated by aeolian sands, probably as a reflection of its exposure to a 

nearby active dune field. On the other hand, the N-S orientation of the sand barrier, facing the 

open ocean, which differs from other water bodies with less exposed orientations (e. g., Xuño 

and Muro), might well explain the dominance of mesohalobous taxa, especially at times of 

increased barrier permeability such as November, when the sampling was carried out. The 

existence of well-defined groups of diatoms characteristic of these three major types of 

environments could be a powerful tool for the reconstruction of past sedimentary 

environments which do not rely solely on autoecological data from elsewhere (e. g., Vos &amp;amp; de 

Wolf, 1993) but on the specific knowledge of modern analogues from the WIAC. 

The classification of samples in three main groups related to well-defined distinct salinity 

conditions suggests that salinity plays a major role in the distribution of the diatom 

assemblages. This is corroborated by the CCA results once highly correlated environmental 

variables, as demonstrated by VIF analysis, are removed. In the ordination diagram (Fig. 4.1.3) 

salinity is the most relevant variable in the data-set, showing the largest correlation with the 

ordination axes, followed by PO4
3-

 (axis 1), DOC and NO3
-
 (axis 2). This relationship between 

salinity and PO4
3-

 is not surprising. Ruttenberg (2004) suggests that dissolved phosphate is 

typically present in water with circumneutral pH and seawater salinity. Phosphorous, and 

particularly the availability of PO4
3-

, is well known to limit the productivity in most lakes 

(Schindler, 1977).  The plot of samples of the different water bodies discriminates, in general 

terms, the low salinity sites, mainly belonging to Galicia on the left, from the more saline 

Portuguese environments to the right, according to the values of axis 1. Axis 2 seems to be 

related to a trophic gradient according to its relationship with N sources (NO2
- 
and NO3

-
) and 

DOC. This minor source of variation within the present-day data-set could however be 

demonstrated as potentially more important with the inclusion of new data, since it is known 

that nutrient gradients play a major role on the distribution of recent dead assemblages in 

similar coastal environments elsewhere (e. g., Weckström et al., 2004). 

4.1.4.2 Modern analogues as tools for coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction 

From the results of the partial CCA analysis, 9 environmental variables accounted for 48 % of 

the explained variance in the diatom data (Table 4.1.4). However, 52 % total variation of the 

diatom data remains unexplained, which can be related to some overlooked factor not 

contemplated in this study. This explained percentage is however higher or similar to those 

found in many other similar biological data-sets in coastal areas, having larger number of 

samples, that were used to develop conductivity or salinity transfer functions (e. g., Zong &amp;amp; 

Horton, 1999; Hassan et al., 2009).

Both cluster analysis and CCA results clearly indicate that salinity and nutrient concentrations 

are the most important environmental variables explaining the diatom distribution in the 

studied environments. Salinity is often the dominant factor influencing diatom community 

composition in coastal areas (Denys &amp;amp; Wolf, 1999; Snoeijs &amp;amp; Weckström, 2010), and studies 

involving the use of diatoms to reconstruct the long-term evolution of coastal systems usually 

employ salinity reconstructions (Cooper et al., 2010). For these reasons, a salinity transfer 

function was developed to infer past salinity conditions (DI-salinity) from fossil samples in the 

water bodies of the WIAC.  

The predictive ability of the salinity transfer function (r
2
 apparent = 0.99) compares well with 

those of other coastal regions for salinity or conductivity (e. g., r
2
 apparent = 0.86-0.97, Juggins, 

1992; Parson et al., 1999; Hassan et al., 2009; Wachnika et al., 2010). The poor performance 

under jack-knifing (r
2
 = 0.56) and bootstrapping (r

2
 = 0.53) reflects the heterogeneous nature 

of the dataset. Any DI-salinity estimated from this data-set should therefore be used with 

caution, namely taking into account the presence of certain diatom taxa with low N and N2 

values. Although this work represents the first transfer function available for 

palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in continental aquatic systems of the WIAC, the results 

clearly show that the calibration data-set can be improved by merging other available data-

sets (e. g., Ribeiro et al., 2013; Resende et al., 2005, 2007) or new data. For the case of DI-

salinity reconstructions, the data-sets should include a wider range of salt conditions and 

environments (i. e., the inclusion of deeper water bodies depicting pelagic habitats) to broaden 

the use of the transfer function to coastal areas with more varied salinities and morphologies. 

Moreover, the extension of the calibration data-sets to develop regional rather than local 

transfer functions has recently been recommended for carrying out palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions in coastal ecosystems (Wilson &amp;amp; Lamb, 2012; Watcham et al., 2013). 

This study also corroborates that it is difficult to achieve precise inferences in coastal habitats 

because of the adaptation of many taxa to a wide range of ecological conditions (Anderson &amp;amp; 

Vos, 1992; Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993; Denys &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1999). Some present-day diatom taxa in the 

studied data-set showed salinity optima with wide tolerances (namely in the 

freshwater/brackish salinity ranges). These broad tolerances can hinder their use as modern 

analogues when compared to fossil taxa for salinity reconstructions. For the case of the four 

taxa presenting the highest values for N and N2 (Table 4.1.5), the salinity optima derived from 

this study reflect both similarities and discrepancies with those estimated from other data-

sets. 

The results derived from the present data-set shows that Planothidium delicatulum is a taxon 

typical of lagoon and estuarine environments of the WIAC with salinity optima of  

5.45 ± 3.11 ‰. This optima and the wide tolerance are in agreement with its wide distribution 

in different types of sandy coastal environments (Witkowski et al., 2000; Ribeiro et al., 2003; 

Robinson, 2004; Ribeiro, 2010). On the other hand, Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta resulted 

to be a taxon typical of lagoon and estuarine environments of the WIAC, with salinity optima 

of 19.84 ± 1.93 ‰, hence exhibiting the most brackish/marine character compared with other 

Cocconeis placentula varieties. This is in correspondence with the estuarine character of this

49 
 

taxon elsewhere (Snoeijs &amp;amp; Balashova 1998; Cantoral-Uriza &amp;amp; Aboal, 2010). Cyclotella 

meneghiniana is traditionally considered a euplanktonic freshwater or freshwater/brackish 

diatom in coastal areas (Denys, 1991b). The salinity optima derived from the present day data-

set is 3.58 ± 2.59 ‰, which is below the 6 ‰ estimated salinity optima in coastal water bodies 

from, for instance, north-eastern Argentina (Hassan et al., 2009). Cyclotella meneghiniana is a 

common diatom in an open estuary such as the Tagus (Ribeiro et al., 2003; Ribeiro, 2010; 

Santos, 2010) which, with the estimated salinity optima obtained for the WIAC, support its 

affinity for salty environments in this region. This taxon lives in a wide range of habitat types, 

from oligotrophic lakes to polluted lagoons, and shows a large morphological variation, 

resulting in one of the most problematic species in the study of diatom ecology (Håkansson &amp;amp; 

Cherpurnov, 1999). Because of its morphological variability, Ribeiro (2010) points that 

Cyclotella meneghiniana in estuarine waters and sediments can easily be misconfused with 

several closely related species, especially under light microscope cell counts. Although 

misidentification of some specimens or ecophenotypic variability cannot be completely ruled 

out, the salinity optima derived for Cyclotella meneghiniana in this study is in line with the 

euryaline character stated by Håkansson (2002). 

The high unexplained variance (52 %) from the CCA result indicates that diatoms respond not 

only to salinity, PO4
3-

, NO3
-
, and DOC but to other unknown variables as well. Hence, it is 

advisable to use the constructed transfer function for salinity in a multiproxy approach that 

also contemplates employment of total organic carbon/total nitrogen ratios (Corg/Ntotal) and 

stable isotopes (Lamb et al., 2006) or trace elements such as Br, Cl
 
or S (Freitas  et al., 2003) as 

indicators for inferring salinity changes in coastal sedimentary records.  

Future studies in the WIAC should assess not only the role of salinity or nutrient gradients on 

the composition of diatom dead assemblages in present-day bottom sediments, but also of 

other environmental variables, such as tidal levels, sediment composition or depth. This would 

lead to more reliable palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in these systems where the 

complex interplay between continental and marine influences complicates the interpretation 

of the sedimentary record. 

4.1.5 CONCLUSIONS 

This work provides an ecological basis for understanding the variability of present-day dead 

diatom assemblages in the Western Iberian Atlantic coastal environments and the main 

environmental factors that govern their composition. The similarities found between the dead 

assemblages and the biocoenoses reported in previous studies suggest a minor taphonomical 

bias. The sampled sites are also good representations of the shallow or marginal habitats 

samples of the region. Results of cluster analysis revealed that coastal lakes and ponds, 

lagoons and estuaries can be characterized by distinct diatom assemblages, being 

Achnanthidium minutissimum, Pseudostaurosira trainorii and Nitzschia frustulum, the most 

common and abundant diatoms in the data-set from these environments, and salinity, PO4
3-

, 

NO
3-

, and DOC, the water column most significant variables influencing the composition of the 

dead diatom assemblages in the region.

It is possible to discriminate among three distinct types of coastal environments according to 

the dominating types of diatoms. A first type is constituted by coastal lakes and ponds from 

both the Galician and Portuguese coast, and it is characterized by freshwater to 

brackish/freshwater tychoplanktonic and epiphytic diatoms. The second type comprises 

estuaries from Portugal and an outlier, a single Galician coastal lake (Doniños), which are 

mainly characterized by marine/brackish epipsammic diatoms. Finally, the third type consists 

of Portuguese lagoons (and Sado estuary) where freshwater to brackish epiphytic diatoms are 

dominant. The comparison of taxa belonging to these three main types of environments with 

those dominating fossil diatom assemblages can be used for the reconstruction of past 

sedimentary environments in the WIAC that until now solely rely on autoecological data from 

elsewhere. 

Diatom salinity optima and tolerances, estimated by WA, showed a wide haline distribution, 

ranging from oligohalobous halophobous to polyhalobous taxa. The results indicate that 

Planothidium delicatulum, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, are 

the most reliable diatoms for past salinity reconstructions. On the other hand, WA–PLS 

demonstrated to be the model with the best fit for past salinity reconstruction. The strong and 

highly significant relationship of the present-day dead assemblages with salinity enabled the 

construction of a transfer function for this variable with a good predictive power. This transfer 

function could be used in future studies on the history of the coastal evolution of this area, 

such as research on long-term sea-level change, or on the history of natural or human-induced 

permeability of coastal lakes and lagoons. The application of this technique to the sedimentary 

record will rely on the close correspondence between the taxonomic composition of the 

present-day data-set and the fossil assemblages. On the other hand, the use of this transfer 

function should be restricted to the reconstruction of marginal environments in coastal water 

bodies. Merging of other existing data-sets or new ones is advisable to generate a new transfer 

function applicable to deeper water environments.

4.2. Climatic and anthropogenic impacts 
in Traba coastal wetland (Galicia, NW 
Spain) in the last 550 years 
 

 

4.2.1 INTRODUCTION  

Wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world because they provide critical 

ecosystem goods and services, such as carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, fish 

production, water purification, and erosion control (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2012). Those 

wetlands located in the interface of land and ocean, are highly productive and particularly 

complex because they can include multiple habitats such as sand dunes, mudflats, creeks and 

channels and associated ecotones such as salt marsh and sea-grass meadows (Newton et al., 

2013). However, not only coastal wetlands, but littoral ecosystems in general, are particularly 

vulnerable to climate change impacts that include accelerated sea-level rise, increased 

temperature, changes in rainfall distribution and freshwater inputs, and in the frequency and 

intensity of storms, all operating over a range of temporal and spatial scales (Day et al., 2008). 

Besides these global agents, direct local human intervention in these systems is a potential 

major factor that can significantly alter coastal ecosystems (Håkanson &amp;amp; Bryhn, 2008), but the 

exact pace and ultimate severity of local impacts very much depend on regional climatic 

changes (Moser et al., 2012). It is therefore essential to know the relative importance that 

local and regional factors have on the dynamics of these complex ecosystems and how they 

have operated at different time scales. 

Global and local forcing factors can induce changes in the equilibrium of ecosystems. For the 

case of shallow lentic systems, it is known that they can be found in two main types of 

alternative stable states: a clear state dominated by aquatic vegetation, and a turbid state 

characterized by high algal biomass (Scheffer et al., 1993). Major changes in nutrient 

availability trigger the ecological regime shift from one stable state to another, but this can last 

long periods of time, making long-term studies imperative for understanding the real nature of 

this kind of ecosystem transitions. Environmental monitoring data are however not available in 

most cases and, when available, they usually cover less than 15 years, in spite of being 

essential for knowing, for instance, the effects of climate change in semienclosed coastal 

systems (Newton et al., 2013). Palaeoenvironmental records covering decadal to centennial 

time-scales can substitute the lack of monitoring data for tracking long-term dynamics in 

aquatic systems whilst smoothing out short-term variability (Sayer et al., 2010). They can not 

only provide valuable data on reference conditions that can be target for correct restoration 

plans in disturbed ecosystems, but be used to track the consequences of these plans (Smol, 

2008). This is particularly important for the case of wetlands, because they can recover

towards alternative states that differ from reference conditions before degradation (Moreno-

Mateos et al., 2012). 

Coastal wetlands are fairly uncommon and unstudied features in Galicia (NW Spain). As for 

similar systems in the western Ibero Atlantic coast (WIAC), they originated behind sand-

barriers when the rate of sea-level rise was attenuated around 5500 cal yr BP (Bao et al., 2007; 

Costas et al., 2009; González-Villanueva et al., 2009). Although low-resolution studies have 

identified eustatism and climate as major controls on the long-term evolution of these 

systems, local forcing factors such as direct human intervention have increasingly played a 

more significant role in the last centuries to decades (e. g., Devoy et al., 1996; Santos et al., 

2001; Bao et al., 2007; Costas &amp;amp; Alejo, 2007; González-Villanueva et al., 2009; Vázquez-

Loureiro, 2011). Disentangling to what extent local vs global drivers prompted changes in the 

ecological status of these systems in recent times requires high-resolution multiproxy studies 

that would allow to distinguish when changes in the state of the ecosystem are caused by 

human pressure and when are due to natural variability (Newton et al., 2013). 

The Traba coastal wetland, located in the Galician “Death Coast”, is a Site of Community 

Importance under the Habitats Directive of the European Union (EU). It can be classified as a 

coastal freshwater lagoon according to the Ramsar Convention Classification System for 

Wetland Types (Ramsar-Convention-Secretariat, 2013). Although the major environmental 

changes that took place in this wetland since it origin at 5700 cal yr BP are well known (Bao et 

al., 2007) a high temporal resolution study characterizing how climatic and non-climatic 

stressors could have promoted changes in its ecological state at centennial to decadal time 

scales is still lacking. There is a strong need for this since it has been addressed that 

development of observing systems acting at appropriate scales to detect global climate change 

and its effects on coastal wetlands is essential for the correct management of these complex 

systems (Day et al., 2008). 

In this work a palaeoecological multiproxy approach (sedimentology, fossil diatom 

assemblages, and geochemistry) is used, to identify ecological regime shifts in the Traba 

coastal wetland during the last 550 yrears and relate them to the natural and anthropogenic 

stressors that could have caused them. This work pretends to establish the theoretical basis 

for implementing correct management policies in this EU’s Site of Community Importance. 

4.2.2 RESULTS 

4.2.2.1 Sedimentology and Stratigraphy 

Sedimentology and the main stratigraphic units were defined in core TRA07-A2 (94 cm long). 

This core is basically made up by organic slightly sandy muds (% &gt; 63 µm ? 25 %) intercalated 

with muddy sands and sandy mud levels (% &gt; 63 µm &gt; 25 %) (Flemming, 2000; Fig. 4.2.1). The 

term “sandy” is used here in a strictly dimensional sense. Thus, the sandy levels are not only 

made up by rounded quartz grains of aeolian origin but also by large organic fibers (Fig. 4.2.1). 

Two distinct sedimentary units could be defined according to stratigraphically constrained 

cluster analysis based on squared Euclidian dissimilarity (CONISS, Grimm, 1987):

53 

 

Unit I (94 - 52 cm): Silts (&amp;lt;63 µm and &gt; 2 % µm) are the main component of this unit (Fig. 

4.2.1). The &gt; 63 µm fraction varies between 9.5 and 41.9 %, being mainly made up by slightly 

sandy muds with fewer sandy mud sediments (% &gt; 63 µm &gt; 25 %, Fig. 4.2.1). Sands of aeolian 

origin are scarce.  

Unit 2 (52 - 0 cm): The &gt; 63 µm fraction in this unit varies between 14.9 and 60.1 %, 

corresponding to sediments classified as sandy muds with muddy sand deposits  

(% &gt; 63 µm &gt; 50 %) (Fig.  4.2.1). 

Another parallel core, TRA07-A1, which recovered only Unit II, was taken and correlated with 

TRA07-A2 (Fig. 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). Results on diatom content and geochemical proxies refer to 

samples taken in this shorter core.

4.2.2.2 Diatom stratigraphy 

The study of diatoms in core TRA07-A1 gave a record consisting of 89 taxa. The relative 

abundance diagram, once taxa reaching a value &amp;lt;2 % were removed to minimize the influence 

of rare diatoms as shown in Figure 4.2.2. This reduced the number of taxa from 89 to 23, which 

however represent 93 % of the total counted diatoms (Appendix IIB for diatom abundances 

and appendix IIIB for diatom plates). The diatoms are grouped in the diagram by their 

apparent salinity and habitat tolerances (Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993) (Fig. 4.2.2). Diatom assemblage 

zones (DAZs) were delimited with a broken-stick model of variance distribution (Bennett, 

1996). Subzones were defined by stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis based on 

CONISS method (Grimm 1987) (Fig. 4.2.2). The analyses defined three distinct DAZs (Fig. 4.2.2): 

DAZ TRA07-I (45 - 19 cm) 

This zone is characterized by the dominance of tychoplanktonic diatoms (mainly 

Pseudostaurosira trainorii Morales; ? 49 % relative abundance) with the freshwater epiphytic 

Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kützing) Czarnecki as subdominant taxa with values always 

lower than 10 %. Other taxa represented in low abundances are the also tychoplanktonic 

Stauroforma exiguiformis (Lange-Bertalot) Flower, Jones &amp;amp; Round, the epiphytic Encyonopsis 

subminuta Krammer &amp;amp; Reichardt, the epipelic Navicula radiosa Kützing, Brachysira vitrea 

(Grunow) Ross in Hartley or Nitzschia fonticola (Grunow) Grunow in Van Heurck and the 

epipsammic Planothidium delicatulum (Kützing) Round &amp;amp; Bukhtiyarova. All these taxa are 

almost exclusively restricted in the core to this zone. On the basis of these taxa, this zone can 

be subdivided in two subzones. Whereas in subzone TRA07-Ia (45-33 cm) these taxa are 

present in abundances ranging from 0 to 6.7 %, in subzone TRA07-Ib (33-19 cm) they diminish, 

except for Achnanthidium minutissimum, in favor of Pseudostaurosira trainorii, which records 

maximum abundances for the whole sequence (Fig. 4.2.2). 

DAZ TRA07-II (19 - 14 cm) 

In this zone, Pseudostaurosira trainorii starts to decrease, although it is still the dominant 

taxon (46 to 65 %). This reduction is followed by an increase in the freshwater epiphytic 

Achnanthidium minutissimum. Taxa in minor abundances that also start to increase are 

Ctenophora pulchella (Ralfs ex Kützing) Williams &amp;amp; Round, Psammothidium oblongellum 

(Oestrup) Van de Vijver, Cocconeis placentula var. placentula Ehrenberg and Halamphora 

veneta (Kützing) Levkov (Fig. 4.2.2). 

DAZ TRA07-III (14 - 0 cm) 

This zone is characterized by the sharp decrease in the brackish/freshwater tychoplanktonic 

Pseudostaurosira trainorii which is mainly replaced by the now dominant freshwater epiphytic 

Achnanthidium minutissimum. The marine/brackish epiphyte Ctenophora pulchella, the 

freshwater epiphytic Psammothidium oblongellum, and the freshwater epipelic Halamphora 

veneta act as codominant or subdominant taxa in this zone. Mainly according to shifts in the 

abundance of Achnanthidium minutissimum, this zone can be divided in two subzones. In 

subzone TRA07-IIIa (14 to 3 cm) this taxon dominates the assemblage, with the  

exception of the top samples which are codominated by Psammothidium oblongellum. 

Subzone TRA07-IIIb (3 to 0 cm) shows an increase in Pseudostaurosira trainorii, being the 



DIATOM-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF IBERIAN COASTAL 
ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

55 

 

assemblage not dominated by a single taxon , but rather codominated by  

Pseudostaurosira trainorii, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Psammothidium oblongellum and 

Halamphora veneta (Fig. 4.2.2). 

Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was performed on the diatom abundance data to 

reveal the length of the dominant gradient for the diatom assemblages and to evaluate the 

unimodal or linear distribution of the data (ter Baak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988). Because the obtained 

length of gradient was 1.35 standard deviation units, the response was considered linear and a 

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was subsequently performed. 90 % of the total variance 

of the diatom compositional change is represented by axis 1 of the PCA, whereas axis 2 

represents only 0.04 % (Fig. 4.2.3). Pseudostaurosira trainorii and Achnanthidium 

minutissimum showed the minimum and maximum scores for axis 1 (Fig. 4.2.3B). 

Psammothidium oblongellum and Achnanthidium minutissimum are the two taxa more closely 

related to axis 2 (Fig. 4.2.3B).  

 

4.2.2.2.1 Ordination of the fossil samples on the main environmental gradients of the 

WIAC 

Data for each of the 45 studied samples in core TRA07-A1 were placed as supplementary 

passive samples in the ordination space of the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) that 

analyzed the relationship between the present-day diatom and dead assemblages in the WIAC 

and the main environmental variables (Chapter 4.1). Position of these fossil samples on the 

resulting CCA biplot (Fig. 4.2.4) provides an indication of the main trajectories of 

environmental change through time with respect to the significant environmental variables 

ruling the composition of the diatom assemblages (salinity, PO4
3-

  – axis 1 and NO3
-
 and DOC – 

axis 2;  see Chapter 4.1). 

The fossil samples show a reduced variation compared to the length of the gradients found in 

the Ibero Atlantic coast, suggesting that minor environmental changes took place in 

approximately the last 550 years (Fig. 4.2.4). All the samples are plotted at the side of low 

salinity and PO4
3-

 conditions indicating the development of freshwater or slightly brackish 

waters with low P concentrations at all times. Samples below the 13 cm depth are positioned 

at the more saline extreme of this reduced gradient for axis 1, pointing to a freshening of this 

water body in recent times. The extent of variation is greater for axis 2, indicating more 

significant changes related to NO3
-
 and DOC than to salinity or P availability. At approximately 

13 cm depth there seems to be a threshold separating the more NO3
-
 and DOC enriched 

samples at the bottom of the core from those at the top.

4.2.2.2.2 Quantitative Salinity Reconstruction 

The salinity transfer function developed for the water bodies of the WIAC (Chapter 4.1) was 

used for inferring salinity changes in Traba during approximately the last 550 years. 

Component 4 of the Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares Regression model (WA-PLS, ter 

Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993) was used for this task. The resultant diatom-inferred salinity (DI-

salinity) profile (Fig. 4.2.5) shows minor changes in salinity, as predicted by the position of the 

downcore samples in the ordination space of the CCA performed with surface sediment data 

from the region (Fig. 4.2.4). 

DAZ TRA07-I shows very constant salinity values around 3.6 ± 0.2 ‰ to 5.7 ± 0.3 ‰, all in the 

freshwater to slightly brackish water range. Highest salinity values for this zone are recorded in 

subzone TRA07-Ib. There is a net shift towards more freshwater conditions along DAZ TRA07-II, 

with inferred salinities ranging from 2.2 ± 0.2 ‰ to 4.1 ± 0.2 ‰. The freshwater character is 

accentuated during DAZ TRA07-III which records minimum salinity conditions ranging from  

-0.1 ± 0.2 ‰ to 1.9 ± 0.2 ‰ in subzone TRA07-IIIa. Subzone TRA07-IIIb salinity recover to 

values very similar as those recorded in zone II (2.2 ± 0.2 ‰ to 4.1 ± 0.2 ‰). Reconstructed 

salinities for subzone TRA07-IIIa should however be taken with caution, as indicated by some 

estimated salinities that, according to the model, yielded negative values.

TC shows high values at the base of this zone (with a maximum of 9.32 %), experiencing a

4.2.2.4 Geochronology 

The 
210

Pb activity signal recorded in eleven samples from TRA07-A1 is small (-45 to 48 Bq kg
-1

) 

and indistinguishable within the uncertainties of the measurement (67 to 111 Bq kg
-1

), thus 

preventing being unable to provide a chronology using 
210

Pb. In spite of this, the record of 
137

Cs 

activity shows a start at 15.5 cm, with a peak at 11.5 cm (Fig. 4.2.7). Whereas the start of the 
137

Cs activity can be ascribed to 1954, the peak can be interpreted as belonging to the 1963 

maximum deposition rate of 
137

Cs before the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, with no evidence of the 

1986 Chernobyl event in this core (León Vintró, pers. comm.). The radiocarbon dating was 

performed in 3 samples (at 28, 36 and 94 cm depths in TRA07-A2). The topmost sample 

accused post-modern carbon (Table 4.2.2). 

CLAM 2.1 (Blaauw, 2010) produces an age-model for the sedimentary sequence using both 

radiocarbon and non-radiocarbon

ages (calibrated ages). Linear interpolation was chosen to create the models in Fig. 4.2.7, 

considering no outliers (model A) and an outlier Poz-43729 (model B). The model generates 

interpolated ages for each centimeter associated with a 95 % confidence, based on the ‘best’

Sedimentation rates (SRs) were estimated for the composite sequence using the two 

constructed models. The downmost sedimentation rates of 11.4 and 12.6 mm yr
-1

 estimated 

with models A and B, respectively, were extended to the 33 cm level according to the gentle 

and continuous trends in both the composition of the diatom assemblages and geochemical 

indicators (Figs. 4.2.2 and 4.2.6). The major difference between the two models rely on the 

estimated SRs between 33 and 15.5 cm. Model A considers two different SRs (0.2 and  

17.9 mm yr
-1

) whereas in model B there is a unique estimated SR of 0.4 mm yr
-1

. Model B was 

chosen based on its simpler assumptions. Model A would assume a major erosive or 

sedimentation hiatus (294 years) taking place between 33 and 28 cm, i. e., between 1656 and 

1950 cal yr CE - calibrated years of Common Era. There is no evidence either in the diatom 

assemblages or the geochemical proxies of any abrupt shift indicating a major change in the 

sedimentary environment. Hence, interpolated ages are from here on based on the ‘best’ age-

depth model from the CLAM age-depth model B.

range from 3 to 177 years, average 81 years. C -

Sedimentation rates presented are interpolated using age-models A and B. 

Application of the model yielded four SRs: (1) 12.6 mm yr

 (94 to 33 cm), (2) 0.4 mm yr

 (33 to 

15.5 cm), (3) 5 mm yr
-1

 (15.5 to 11.5 cm), and (4) 2.7 mm yr
-1

 (Fig. 4.2.6).  

The first SR, 12.6 mm yr
-1

 (94 to 33 cm), is certainly enlarged by the presence of centimetric 

aeolian sand layers (Fig. 4.2.1). Removal of the 8 cm of sand layers, presumably deposited 

during short episodic events, would yield a more reasonable SR of 9.8 mm yr
-1

. 

4.2.3 DISCUSSION 

4.2.3.1 Meaning of the diatom assemblages and isotopic signatures 

The results of the PCA, combined with the study of the behavior of the fossil samples in the 

ordination space defined by the CCA on present-day samples of the WIAC (Chapter 4.1), 

provide the main basis for the palaeoecological interpretation of the diatom assemblages 

found in core TRA07. Variance explained by the first two components of the PCA (90 % for PC1 

and 0.04 % for PC2) shows that almost all the variation can be reduced to what the PC1 means. 

This first component mainly reflects variations in the abundance of Pseudostaurosira trainorii 

and Achnanthidium minutissimum. Both species constitute two of the main taxa characterizing

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

64 

 

the cluster of freshwater coastal lakes and ponds and restricted lagoons of the WIAC (Chapter 

4.1). Pseudostaurosira trainorii, which belongs to the Fragilaria s. l. group, is an opportunistic 

brackish/freshwater tychoplanktonic small diatom found elsewhere in small water bodies with 

neutral pH and low to high concentrations of phosphorous (Morales, 2001). Achnanthidium 

minutissimum is a widespread and abundant species, constituting one of the most frequently 

occurring diatoms in freshwater benthic samples (Patrick &amp;amp; Reimer, 1966; Krammer &amp;amp; Lange-

Bertalot 1991). The dominance of these two taxa throughout the core suggests that during the 

studied period Traba behaved as a coastal lake or pond with minor connection to the ocean 

(Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993), as it occurred during the 5700 cal yr BP of its history (Bao et al., 2007). 

However, the clear alternate dominance of the two species before and after c. 1875 cal yr CE 

points to an underlying environmental change that significantly altered the composition of the 

diatom assemblages. Fragilaria s. l.-dominated assemblages are typical of shallow-water 

littoral zones of a wide variety of water bodies under conditions of environmental instability 

(Reed, 1999). Under these circumstances they often bloom in coastal environments (Denys, 

1990), having been considered typical before and during the process of water body isolation 

from the ocean (Stabell, 1985). Growth of this taxon is also favored by alkalinizing base cations 

released from the catchment (Axford et al., 2009). For the mentioned reasons, and the 

brackish/freshwater affinity of Pseudostaurosira trainorii, its dominance before c. 1875 cal yr 

CE point to the existence of instable environmental conditions associated to a more frequent 

and/or intense connection to the ocean. As the rest of the Fragilaria s. l. species, it would also 

indicate the predominance of shallow but open waters (Fan et al., 1996). On the other hand, 

Achnanthidium minutissimum is common in well-oxygenated lakes and streams with low or 

moderate concentrations of nutrients and organic pollution (Kelly, 2000). It is not only an 

epiphytic species indicative of extensive macrophytic development (Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993), but 

also an indicator of increased infilling in wetlands behind a sand barrier (Earle &amp;amp; Duthie, 1986). 

In the long-term evolution of Traba, Achnanthidium minutissimum was the dominant species 

during the transition from a lacustrine to palustrine environment, at c. 3100 cal yr BP in the 

innermost position of the present-day wetland (Bao et al., 2007). According to the ecologies of 

these two dominant taxa in core TRA07, shifts in the PC1 scores throughout the record (Fig. 

4.2.2) can be used as rough indicators of changes in the confinement of the system. Low values 

of this axis would be indicative of more frequent and/or intense connection to the ocean, 

whereas high values would be characteristic of a less permeable sand barrier that gave rise to 

a more confined environment. 

Besides changes in sand-barrier permeability, nutrients exert also a control on the composition 

of the diatom assemblages, as shown by the plot of fossil samples in the CCA (Fig. 4.3.4). Top 

samples dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum fall at the side of low P and N sources 

compared to those dominated by Pseudostaurosira trainorii. This result suggests that these 

two species can be used to trace changes in the eutrophy of the system.  

Shifts in carbon isotope ratios in lake sediments have mainly been attributed to changes in 

productivity, metabolic pathways for carbon fixation, source of organic matter and diagenesis, 

among others (Meyers &amp;amp; Teranes, 2001; Cohen, 2003; Lamb et al., 2006). For the particular

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

65 

 

case of coastal environments, variations in the fluvial vs. marine inputs of organic matter play a 

major role on C fractionation (Lamb et al., 2006). Although the net increase in ?
13

C values 

would be coherent with the diatom-inferred salinity reconstruction for the first part of the 

record (DAZs I and II, Figs. 4.2.5 and 4.2.6), the pattern is reversed in the most recent history of 

the wetland (DAZ-I). Other factors should therefore be taken into account for the observed 

change in the carbon isotope ratio. It is known that the delivery of light dissolved inorganic 

carbon from land runoff can result in isotopically light algal organic matter (Meyers &amp;amp; Teranes, 

2001; Lamb et al., 2006). Variations in ?
13

C values found in Traba are in general terms inverse 

to those in the Corg/Ntotal ratio, suggesting that changes in the incorporation of terrestrial vs. 

aquatic organic matter can be the main responsible for shifts in the carbon isotope ratios. The 

observed net increase in ?
13

C would therefore be indicative of a reduction in the catchment 

runoff. This explanation is likely applicable to the observed pattern of ?
15

N. Inorganic nitrogen 

reservoirs available to land plants and aquatic plants differ in their isotopic contents so land-

derived organic matter yields a lighter N signature than aquatic organic matter (Meyers &amp;amp; 

Ishiwatari, 1995). For the particular case of Traba, the reduced size of the catchment probably 

magnified the effects of land-derived vs aquatic organic matter inputs over other factors on 

both the C and N isotope signatures, explaining the net increase through time of both proxies. 

4.2.3.2 Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction 

Diatom assemblage data indicate that Traba was always a wetland with no tidal influence 

according to the classification of Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf (1993) throughout the studied period, but have 

responded to changes in water level and sand barrier permeability as well as to nutrient 

concentration. Based on the sedimentology, changes in the diatom assemblages, Corg/Ntotal 

ratios, isotopic signatures in organic matter (?
13

C and ?
15

N) and DI-salinity, three main stages 

in the evolution of the system can be identified (Fig. 4.2.8). 

Stage A (interpolated age c. 1470-1875 cal yr CE) 

As stated before, dominance of brackish/freshwater tychoplanktonic diatoms suggests the 

development of shallow but open oligohaline waters during this stage. Corg/Ntotal ratios point to 

a mix of aquatic and terrestrial organic carbon sources which progressively become more 

aquatic, after 1600 cal yr CE (Meyers &amp;amp; Ishiwatari, 1995). Sedimentation rates experience a 

drastic decline from 9.8 to 0.4 mm yr
-1 

(Fig. 4.2.8). At the same time, there is an increase in the 

abundance of tychoplanktonic taxa, indicating that depth and/or extension of open waters was 

at its peak for the whole studied period. Both diatom and Corg/Ntotal ratio data suggest that the 

progressive expansion of open waters is paralleled, as expected, by a relative increase in the 

contribution of algae to primary productivity. Flood simulations in Traba have shown that 

extreme water elevations would imply extensive inundation of the sand-barrier (González-

Villanueva et al., 2013) (Fig. 4.2.8). This would have facilitated exchange with the ocean, and 

thus the dominance of pioneering diatoms typical of instable environments such as Fragilaria 

s. l. (Stabell, 1985; Denys, 1990) to which the genus Pseudostaurosira belongs to. Diatoms of 

this group are also reported as being benefited from alkalinizing base cations released from 

the catchment (Axford et al., 2009; Reed et al., 1999). The dominance of these diatoms during 

this stage could indicate enhanced runoff and increased cation input to lake waters.

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

Allochthonous inputs are not only limited to byproducts of weathering, but also to sands of 

aeolian origin, as shown by the maximum number of sand layers in the record at this time (Fig. 

4.2.8). 

A correlation between the core TRA07 (this hapter) and the marginal TR1 (Bao et al., 2007) 

shows that at this latter position infilling already had started, as indicated by its diatom 

community dominated by freshwater epiphytes. Besides this, a minor peak in oligohalobous 

halophilous taxa confirms that some kind of marine influence affected even this inner position 

at this time.  

Stage B (interpolated age c. 1875-1990 cal yr CE) 

During this stage a progressive transition from an open wetland with reduced but more or less 

constant ocean influence to a more confined freshwater environment takes place, as indicated 

by the DI-salinity reduction (Fig. 4.2.8). The change is accompanied by a probable decrease in 

aeolian activity, shown by the reduction in the deposited sand layers (Fig. 4.2.8). However, 

major changes affected the trophic status and composition of biological communities in the 

lake itself. 

The stage starts with an increase in the Corg/Ntotal values (in the range of 13.7 to 14.2) indicating 

enhanced contribution of land-derived organic matter. This increase is coincident with the 

decline in tychoplanktonic diatoms, which are progressively replaced mainly by freshwater 

epiphytes. Debris of macrophytes associated to epiphytic diatoms might explain the cellulose-

rich organic matter that would increase the Corg/Ntotal values (Meyers &amp;amp; Teranes, 2001), as well 

as a higher sedimentation rate. A similar correspondence between an increase in epiphytic 

diatoms and Corg/Ntotal is found in the previous Stage A (DAZ-Ia, Fig. 4.2.8). However, after the 

peak in Corg/Ntotal recorded at the start of this Stage B there is a progressive decrease in the 

values of the ratio, starting at c. 1960 cal yr CE, in spite of the epiphytic diatoms net rise. At 

this time both diatom data and aerial photograph surveys indicate extensive growth of areas 

colonized by emerged macrophytes at the expense of the water body (González-Villanueva et 

al., 2013). This would be in conflict with the decline shown by the Corg/Ntotal profile. A probable 

explanation would lie on the relative importance of emerged vs. submerged vegetation on the 

recent palludification of the whole system (Bao et al., 2007). The marginal areas of the lake are 

currently colonized by reeds (Phragmites australis), whereas the bottom is covered during 

spring and summer by a mat of the algae Aegagropila linnaei and a submerged macrophyte 

community dominated by Ruppia maritima, with other plants, such as Ceratophyllum 

demersum, being subdominant (Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, pers. comm.). Analyses of samples of 

Phragmites australis in the coastal lake of Doniños, northern Galicia, yielded average values of 

Corg/Ntotal = 27.2 and ?
13

C= -31.0 ‰ (Bao et al., unpublished data) not in the range of those 

observed in the sediments of Traba during this stage. Although we lack isotopic and Corg/Ntotal 

data from the dominant Aegagropila linnaei and Ruppia maritima, it is very likely, especially 

for the former, that their values are very close to those of the subdominant Ceratophyllum 

demersum, which in Doniños yielded figures of Corg/Ntotal = 8.4 and ?
13

C= -19.5 ‰ (Bao et al., 

unpublished data), clearly in the range of freshwater to marine algae (Lamb et al., 2006). The

67 

 

low values in the sediment’s Corg/Ntotal ratio during this stage would therefore not be 

associated to the known expansion of emerged macrophytes in the marginal areas of the lake 

(González-Villanueva et al., 2013). On the contrary, they seem to be related to the 

development of extensive beds of submerged plants that would support the epiphytic diatom 

communities showing a peak in the sedimentary record during this stage. The positive 

excursion of ?
13

C could very probably be related to the expansion of submerged plants, these 

also with heavier carbon. 

The reduction in connection with the ocean is probably a consequence of a less extended 

water table, according to the available simulations (González-Villanueva et al., 2013), and/or a 

more consolidated and thus less permeable sand barrier (Fig. 4.2.8). A big event of barrier 

breaching or overwash is however suggested by the peak in TS recorded at c. 1960 cal yr CE. 

This has no correspondence with a similar rise in TOC, so the S peak is not due to a 

correspondent increase in organic matter. The high S content, reflected in a TOC/TS value of 

14, suggests a very short-term episode of salinization accompanied by strong reducing 

conditions in the lake (Berner et al., 1979). This episode had a limited effect on the biological 

communities, as shown by the slight modification in the DI-salinity profile (Fig. 4.2.8), 

confirming the very short-lived condition of the event. 

The shift from an assemblage dominated by Pseudostaurosira trainorii (Stage A) to 

Achnanthidium minutissimum in 1875 cal yr CE, points to a modification of the eutrophic status 

of the lake. According to the plot of the fossil samples from core TRA07 on the CCA of the 

present-day diatom dead assemblages and environmental variables (Fig. 4.3.4), this shift 

would be related to a reduction in the N and P sources. The coincidence of these conditions 

with the development of macrophytes rises as a probable explanation for a change of 

equilibrium in the system, due to a reduction in nutrient levels. According to the alternative 

stable states hypothesis, shallow lakes can have two opposite alternative states: a high 

nutrient turbid state with few submerged plants, or a clear state with abundant submerged 

macrophytes (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer &amp;amp; van Nes, 2007). This model has successfully 

been used to interpret the long-term evolution of coastal lake systems that became separated 

from the ocean (e. g., García-Rodríguez et al., 2010). Conforming to this model, Traba 

experienced a transition (DAZ-II, c. 1875 to 1960 cal yr CE) from a turbid state characterized by 

higher nutrient levels and low macrophytic development (Stage A) to a clear state (Stage B) 

with lower nutrient load and abundant submerged plants. As stated above, the latter would be 

the responsible for the apparently counterintuitive observed low Corg/Ntotal ratios. 

Stage C (interpolated age c. 1990-2007 cal yr CE) 

This stage is characterized by the absence of aeolian sandy events and by a minor but steady 

salinity increase to 4.1 ± 0.2 ‰. Both this shift and the also subtle decline in PC1 is a reflection 

of the change from a diatom assemblage dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum (Stage B) 

to one codominated by this taxon and the formerly dominant (Stage A) Pseudostaurosira 

trainorii. A reversal of the trend might have taken place, but the subtle changes involved in the 

rest of the proxies do not allow confirming this hypothesis. Corg/Ntotal ratio remains in low

4.2.3.3 Climatic and non-climatic forcings in the recent ecological evolution of the wetland 

Comparison of the Traba wetland based on this multiproxy approach, with the already 

available local and regional palaeoenvironmental data, allows us to elucidate the main factors 

responsible for the evolution of this site. It can also serve for the purpose of contributing to a 

better understanding of the palaeoclimatic variability of Galicia in the approximately last 550 

years. 

For more than 500 years Traba behaved as a coastal freshwater to slightly brackish wetland 

with a varying extension of open waters and communication with the ocean. As a result of this 

dynamism, the lake experienced at least two different ecological states according to the 

alternative stable states hypothesis (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer &amp;amp; van Nes, 2007). From c. 

1470 to 1875 cal yr CE, the system experienced a more intense nutrient load that led to a 

turbid state according to Scheffer &amp;amp; van Nes, (2007). After this time, and for approximately  

85 years (c. 1875 to 1960 cal yr CE), the lake transformed to a clear state until c. 1990 cal yr CE, 

when a sound shift in the diatom assemblages suggests the possibility of a new state change 

that would last until present. Both regional (climate change) and local (sand barrier 

permeability, in-lake processes, and anthropogenic influence) factors account for the observed 

changes in the state of this lake system. 

4.2.3.3.1 The turbid state 

For approximately 400 years (c. 1470 to 1875 cal yr CE) an opportunistic diatom flora 

flourished in Traba, indicating a high water table that facilitated some kind of connection with 

the ocean (according to simulation models of González-Villanueva et al., 2013). This period 

falls quite accurately in the Little Ice Age (LIA), a climate anomaly that extends from c. 1350 to 

1850 cal yr CE and had a worldwide imprint (Soon &amp;amp; Baliunas, 2003; Wanner et al., 2008; 

Desprat et al., 2003, Fig. 5.1A, Chapter 5), lowering 1 to 2 °C air temperature in Galicia 

(Martínez-Cortizas et al., 1999). Analyses of marine records have suggested a dry LIA for 

Galician latitudes. Both the rías of Muros and Vigo reflect a reduction in runoff at the onset of 

the LIA (Lebreiro et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2010; Andrade et al., 2011). Disentangling the 

relative importance among marine factors (upwelling of deep waters and productivity) and 

land factors (changes in river input) in these records, has however been proven difficult (Cacho 

et al., 2010). This mixture of two primary signals could explain why using different proxies a 

more humid LIA was also suggested for the Ría de Vigo (Bernárdez et al., 2008). By contrast, 

several continental records of the Iberian Peninsula characterize the LIA as a period of 

increased water availability associated with predominant negative values of the North Atlantic 

Oscillation (NAO) index (Benito et al., 2003; Moreno et al., 2008). For instance, an abnormal

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

69 

 

high frequency of large floods in the Atlantic sector of the Iberian Peninsula seems to be well 

documented (Benito et al., 2008) matching with evidences of an intensified fluvial geomorphic 

activity in Europe (Rumsby &amp;amp; Macklin, 1996; Grove, 2001; Macklin &amp;amp; Lewin, 2003). This 

scenario of large water availability fits with a well developed water table in Traba, and is also in 

close agreement with the wet period dating 1430–1865 cal yr CE identified from organic 

matter chemistry in a Galician peat (Schellekens et al., 2011), as well as with 

palaeolimnological records of the Iberian Peninsula (Roberts et al., 2012). 

Climate forcing on the environmental features of the wetland at this time is not restricted to 

precipitation variability. The LIA has been considered a period of enhanced storminess over 

the North Atlantic coastlines (Dawson et al., 2003, 2007; Clarke &amp;amp; Rendell, 2009; Trouet et al., 

2012). This increased storminess coincided with numerous episodes of sand drift and dune 

building along the western European coast as documented by historical records (Clarke &amp;amp; 

Rendell, 2009). Both stormy conditions and intense aeolian activity are compatible with the 

palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Traba for the LIA. DI-salinity reveals that it was during 

this period that the highest saline conditions were acquired in the system. These could have 

been the product not only of an easier connection to the ocean due to an elevated water 

table, but also to the phenomena of storm-induced barrier breaching. On the other hand, high 

aeolian activity in Traba is manifested in the water body by the highest frequency of deposited 

aeolian sand layers for the last c. 550 years. This intensification of sand movements has also 

been recorded in northwest Portugal for the LIA (Granja et al., 2008). The Traba record adds 

new information on the conflicting views of the relationship between NAO and storminess 

variabilities in the North Atlantic (Trouet et al., 2012). It has been suggested that the increase 

in storminess during the LIA is linked to a pervasive NAO positive state (Dawson et al., 2003, 

2007), a view that conflicts with the hypothesis of a negative NAO condition suggested by 

other authors (Trouet et al., 2009; Mann et al., 2009). The high water table and cation 

enrichment recorded in Traba during the LIA suggest enhanced precipitation conditions that 

are in agreement with a dominant weakened NAO state. This supports the hypothesis of 

Trouet et al. (2012) of increased storminess not associated to more frequent storms, as a 

pervasive strengthened NAO would suggest (Dawson et al., 2007), but to more intense storms 

compatible with a NAO negative state scenario. The Traba record also gives an additional 

evidence that the intensification of aeolian activity coincident with increased storminess and 

prolonged negative phases of NAO extended well into SW Europe during the LIA (as pointed by 

Costas et al., 2012) (Fig. 5.1A, Chapter 5). 

The climatic conditions of the LIA had not only an impact on the precipitation and storm 

regime of the area, but probably also on the forest cover of the basin. The combined effects of 

increased water availability and a reduced forest cover very probably explain the intensified 

cation release from the basin that is suggested by the dominance of Pseudostaurosira. It is 

known from historical sources and pollen data that a process of intense deforestation followed 

the Roman Warm Period (250 cal yr BCE – calibrated years Before Common Era, to 450 cal yr 

CE, Desprat et al., 2003) and that it did not stop in Galicia until the mid 1800’s, when an open 

landscape dominated by shrubs prevailed (Guitián Rivera, 2001; Kaal et al., 2011). For the 



DIATOM-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF IBERIAN COASTAL 
ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

70 

 

specific case of coastal areas, pollen data also indicate that locations such as the surroundings 

of the Ría de Vigo were almost completely deforested during the LIA (Muñoz-Sobrino et al., 

2012). However, both climatic deterioration and human activities participated in the process of 

deforestation that led to increased erosion, making difficult to disentangle the relative 

contribution of the two sources in the environmental degradation that took place at the time 

(Kaal et al., 2011). 

4.2.3.3.2 The clear state 

By the end of the LIA, almost all proxies show some kind of inflection, indicating a gradual 

transformation during approximately 85 years (c. 1875 to 1960 cal yr CE) that underwent in a 

change of state. 

A reduction of nutrient availability was probably the main cause involved in this shift of state, 

as indicated by the trajectories of change of the passive fossil samples in the CCA biplot that 

relates diatom composition with the environmental variables (Fig. 4.3.4). External nutrient 

load was very probably reduced by a gradual transformation from a shrub to a forest-

dominated landscape in the surroundings (Guitián Rivera, 2001). The expansion of Pinus in 

Galicia started at c. 1650 cal yr CE, but it was only in the begining of the last century that large 

afforestation, especially in coastal areas, took place (Ramil-Rego et al., 2001; Desprat et al., 

2003). From the mid century onwards, this was accompanied by the also massive afforestation 

with Eucalyptus globulus. Both should have contributed to a reduced export of nutrients from 

the catchment to the wetland, facilitating gradual transition from a turbid to a clear state 

(Schallenberg &amp;amp; Sorrell, 2009). Besides this, aerial surveys show a net increase in the extension 

of the area occupied by emergent macrophytes in the shores since, at least, 1945 (González-

Villanueva et al., 2013). The progression of the marginal marsh could have also benefited the 

reduction in the nutrient loads (Jacobs &amp;amp; Gilliam, 1985; Gasiorowski, 2008). In any case, the 

nutrient decrease was however gradual, not only because of the progressive transformation of 

the landascape, but also because it is necessary a strong nutrient reduction to enable 

recolonization by plants from a previous turbid state (Scheffer et al., 1993). 

Besides the reduction in the catchment nutrient flux to the wetland, other factors could have 

contributed to the shift of alternative states. First, there are indications that changes in the 

water level affecting the performance of submerged macrophytes may have been an 

important trigger of the switches in shallow lakes (Scheffer et al., 1993; O’Farrell et al., 2011). 

Submerged macrophyte dominance is positively related to the occurrence of lake level drops, 

and negatively to lake surface area (van Geest et al., 2007). The low water period in Traba that 

extended from 1875 to 1990 cal yr CE very probably had its influence in the transition from a 

turbid to a clear state. Second, heavy storms can sometimes be implicated in the change 

between alternative stable states (van Nes et al., 2007). Enhanced storminess during the 

1950’s (González-Villanueva et al., 2013), is documented in the sedimentary record of Traba by 

a short-lived episode of barrier breaching indicated by the notable TS peak. As indicated 

above, this episode had a quite limited effect on the biological communities, and probably 

might have had a little contribution to the change from a turbid to a clear state , but some kind 

of influence cannot be completely ruled out.

Although sedimentation rate increases during this phase to be reduced afterwards, there is not 

a consistent pattern during this or the previous phase between changes in sedimentation rates 

and in ecological conditions. This observation agrees with the fact that the sedimentation rate 

does not depend on the ecological status but rather on depth, lake area and hydrological 

conditions (Gasiorowski, 2008). 

4.2.3.3.3 A transition to a new stable state? 

The sedimentary record reflects a change in the abundance trends of epiphytic vs. 

tychoplanktonic diatoms, as well as an increase in salinity from 1992 to 2007 cal yr CE. These 

changes might be indicative of the start of a new change from a clear to a turbid state, but the 

behavior of the remaining sedimentary record proxies do not allow to confirm this hypothesis. 

Some other data suggest however that this might be the case. 

Birdwatchers monitoring waterfowl populations in the wetland for the last 35 years witnessed 

dramatic changes in land use that took place in the inmediate catchment from the start of the 

1990’s onwards (J. L. Rabuñal, pers. comm.). This involved channelization of the small 

tributaries that feed the system, transformation of the higrophilous grasslands mainly made up 

by Juncus spp. and Eleocharis palustris into pastures, intensive use of manure as fertilizer, and 

intermittent artificial opening of the drainage channel that allows sea water entrance. Large 

development of emergent macrophytes at the shores also occurred. 

The increase in arable land and the use of fertilizers could have implicated an intensification of 

nutrient loads (Schallenberg &amp;amp; Sorrell, 2009), likely triggering a transition of the system to a 

new turbid state that could be taking place nowadays. TN concentrations recorded at present 

in the water column range from 1.4 to 3.1 mg L
-1

 when the inlet is not artificially opened 

(Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, pers. comm.). On the other hand, in spite of cultural eutrophication, 

average nitrate (0.61 mg L
-1

) concentrations occuring in the water body at present makes it fall 

in the category of a mesotrophic system (Håkanson &amp;amp; Bryhn, 2008). These data would put 

Traba in an intermediate rather than pure turbid state according to the classification of 

Ibelings et al. (2007). Both the buffering effect (Gasiorowski, 2008) of the marginal marsh 

mainly made up by Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia, and the artificial barrier breaching 

to prevent the flooding of the adjacent artifical pastures very probably counteracted to avoid 

pure eutrophic conditions in the wetland. Nitrate concentration in the lake can be reduced as 

much as 300 times when breaching takes place, until the normal concentrations that range 

from approximately 1.0 to 3.0 mg L
-1

 are reached some weeks later, when natural closure of 

the channel occurs (Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, pers. comm.). Although this type of manipulation can 

have a temporary impact on nutrient concentrations, it is not sure that it can provide a return 

to the previous clear state (Hobbs et al., 2012). 

The additive effect of natural eutrophication in a hypothetic change of state can also not be 

disregarded. Shallow lakes can cyclically switch from vegetation dominated clear water phase 

and a contrasting turbid phase as a result of slow internal eutrophication (van Nes et al., 2007). 

This “time bomb effect” occurs when during the clear phase P is sequestered from the water 

column by the macrophytes and accumulated in the sediments. The accumulation of organic

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

72 

 

matter results in increased oxygen demand that causes anaerobic conditions, boosting a P 

release from the sediments that can provoke a shift to a clear state. At least 7 years of 

macrophyte dominance has been observed as the lapse time needed for these regular cycles 

(van Nes et al., 2007). Traba showed at least 35 years of dominance of a clear state, making 

plausible that the “time bomb effect” exerted some influence on a change of state. 

Another line of evidence supporting a plausible change of state comes from birdwatching 

monitoring data that shows in Traba a drastic reduction in wintering and breeding populations 

of rails and waterfowl from approximately 1992-2003 to present (J. L. Rabuñal, pers. comm.). 

At least for the case of waterfowl, lower numbers are known to occurr at times with low 

macrophyte cover and turbid water, compared to times when submersed macrophytes 

flourish and the water is clear (Hansson et al., 2010). Although there is a time lag between the 

first historical and sedimentary evidences for change and the response of waterfowl 

populations (mainly Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, J. L. Rabuñal, pers. comm.) a probable close 

relationship cannot be dismissed. 

Validation of the hypothesis of a change to a new turbid state in Traba requires ecological 

monitoring data that started to be gathered in 2007, at the time when the studied core was 

retrieved from the wetland. It will not be until a long-term ecological database is completed 

that a final conclusion could be drawn about the ecological present day status and fate of this 

freshwater coastal environment. 

 

4.2.4 CONCLUSIONS 

The multiproxy palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Traba demonstrates that the evolution 

of this coastal wetland in the last approximatley 550 years was dependent on the complex 

interplay between a variety of factors that acted simultaneously. Climatic variability and direct 

or indirect human intervention gave rise to at least two different ecological states in its history 

that can be understood in the framework of the shallow lakes alternative stable state 

hypothesis. During the period extending from 1470 to 1875 cal yr CE Traba was characterized 

by a turbid state fed by significant nutrient loads facilitated by a deforested catchment. 

Deforestation was not only the product of human impact after the Roman Warm Period until 

the 1800’s but also of the deteriorated climatic conditions associated to the LIA. A pervasive 

NAO negative phase brought intensified precitation to the region during this climatic anomaly, 

increasing external nutrient inputs and a rise in the water table. Under this climatic scenario, 

the system was also subject to increased storminess that facilitated some exchange with the 

ocean through the sand barrier, raising its salinity. The Traba record gives additional support to 

a scenario of intensification of aeolian activity coincident with increased storminess and 

prolonged negative phases of NAO during the LIA in the Atlantic European coast. 

From 1875 to 1990 cal yr CE the lake experienced a gradual transition to a clear phase, that last 

approximately 85 years. Reduced nutrient loads to the lake, as well as a lake level drop, 

facilitated the transition to a submerged macrophyte dominated state. The start of this

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

73 

 

transition is not only coincident with the termination of the LIA, but also with the afforestation 

of the catchment that hindered nutrient export to the wetland. The inertia of the system and 

the gradual afforestation of the catchment made the transition from the turbid to the clear 

state a long process. 

The record shows a recent hypothetical new change of state that probably started at 1992 cal 

yr CE with the direct human intervention in the inmediate surroundings of the lake. 

Transformation of the hygrophilous grassland shore communities to pastures, and the 

intensive use of manure as fertilizer, contributed to enhanced nutrient inputs to the lake. 

Episodic artificial breaching of the sand barrier performed to avoid flooding of pastures, and 

the buffering effect of the marginal marsh have however probably alleviated eutrophication in 

the lake in the last years. 

Regime shifts between alternative stable states in the recent history of this small shallow 

water body are coincident with known human intervention, both indirectly affecting the 

catchment (i. e., via deforestation/afforestation) or directly on the inmediate surroundings (i. 

e., via land reclamation, fertilization, and sand barrier breaching). However, climatic variability 

has also played a major role as a forcing agent on its evolution (cold conditions associated to 

the LIA, NAO, and storminess variability). The story of Traba reflects the difficulties to unravel 

the relative importance that the two main groups of forcing agents, climatic and human-

induced, have in the recent evolution of these systems.

4.3. Natural and human-induced changes 
in alternative stable states – a 1745 years 
record of environmental change in the 
Melides lagoon (Portugal)  

 
 

4.3.1 INTRODUCTION 

The reduction in the rate of postglacial sea-level rise that took place since the mid-Holocene 

(Lambeck et al., 2002) facilitated the formation of sand-barriers and associated back-barrier 

wetlands in the Western Iberian Atlantic coast (WIAC) around 5500 cal yr BP (Bao et al., 1999, 

2007; Freitas et al., 1999, 2002a, 2003a; Cearreta et al., 2003; Freitas &amp;amp; Andrade, 2005; Costas 

et al., 2009; González-Villanueva et al., 2009). The evolution of these coastal systems in the 

world is forced by global or regional factors, such as changes in sea-level, climate and tectonic 

stability, and by local factors such as changes in sediment supply, tidal range, land use, and 

nutrient availability (Cooper, 1994; Isla, 1995; Hesp &amp;amp; Short, 1999; Day et al., 2008; Moser et 

al., 2012; Newton et al., 2013; Williams, 2013). Although the deceleration of the Holocene 

postglacial marine transgression seem to have induced local factors to become progressively 

more important (e. g., Devoy et al., 1996), the current context of accelerated sea-level rise 

induced by global warming (Nicholls &amp;amp; Cazenave, 2010) may reactivate the relevance of global 

stressors on coastal wetlands. Disentangling the relative importance of local vs global forcing 

factors driving the recent evolution of these systems and how they have operated at different 

time scales is essential for their correct management (Newton et al., 2013). This is particularly 

relevant when long-term changes in ecological status involving different stable states (Scheffer 

et al., 1993) take place (e. g., García Rodríguez et al., 2010; Stutz et al., 2012). 

The Melides lagoon lies in the southern half of the Tróia-Sines coastal ribbon 80 km south of 

Lisbon (Portugal). As other similar features located nearby, it was originated after the 

establishment of a sand barrier which isolated the previous marine setting from the open sea 

around 5500 cal yr BP (Cearreta et al., 2007). In the last decades Melides was studied under 

contrasting spatial and temporal scales. At a microscale the physico-chemical characteristics of 

the lagoon have been described for its water and bottom sediments (Cruces, 2001; Cruces in 

prep.), and detailed studies on the calcareous nanoplankton (Ramalho, 2003) and benthic 

foraminifera (Alday, 2004) assemblages in surface sediments have also been carried out. 

Meso- to macroscale multiproxy studies involved sedimentological (Freitas et al., 2002a, b), 

geochemical (Cruces, in prep.), and palaeoecological analyses of the sedimentary record, the 

latter focussed on the downcore analyses of nanoplankton (Freitas et al., 2002a; Ramalho, 

2003; M. J. Ramalho unpublished data in Cruces, in prep.), ostracoda (Cabral et al., 2006), 

benthic foraminifera (Cearreta et al., 2007; Alday, 2004; M. Alday unpublished data in Cruces

in prep.) and pollen (Queiroz &amp;amp; Mateus 2004; Santos, 2010) assemblages.  

These studies have identified global eustatic sea-level rise as the main factor responsible for 

coastal development in the area during the postglacial interval and first part of the Holocene 

(Cearreta et al, 2007). Sea-level was of secondary importance after the sand-barrier formation, 

being the dynamics of the barrier what played the most significant role in the evolution of the 

lagoon (Cabral et al., 2006). On the one hand, barrier breaching promotes drainage of 

freshwater lowering the lagoon depth and reducing the wet surface. Conversely, barrier 

closure promotes accumulation of freshwater, increases depth and expands the wet surface. 

This sand-barrier dynamism acted differently through time. First, from 5500 to 500 cal yr BP, it 

were natural variations in the stability and effectiveness of the barrier in excluding marine 

water over time the primary control of the physico-chemical and biological features of the 

lagoon. Second, human intervention in the system since 500 cal yr BP through artificial 

opening of the inlet to prevent eutrophication largely replaced natural variability as the main 

reason for change (Cearreta et al., 2007). Besides artificial opening of the inlet, agricultural 

activities and timber production/consumption on the catchment goes back to 3250-3950 cal yr 

BP (Mateus, 1999), both activities contributing to disturb the natural sedimentary budget of 

the lagoon. In the last decade, and especially since 2003 (Freitas et al., 2009), the Melides 

lagoon has faced many environmental problems including significant deterioration of water 

quality in the shallower sections of the lowland and, in some cases, death of aquatic life.  

The morphological and sedimentological evolution and stability of the semi-enclosed coastal 

environments of the World, such as Melides, is not well understood, and the main driving 

processes in their evolution urgently need to be described and interpreted (Newton et al 

2013). Distinguishing the relative effects of global and local stressors is essential, because 

although many coastal wetlands could adjust to the predicted climate change, human impacts, 

in combination with climate change, can significantly affect these ecosystems (Day et al., 

2008). 

There is therefore the need to conduct high temporal resolution studies of the environmental 

changes that occurred in coastal wetlands in the last centuries, and the likely causes for any 

shift in ecological regimes that could have taken place, a study that is still missing in the 

Melides lagoon. 

In this work we examine the main ecological changes in the Melides history since the 3
rd

 

century by means of the multiproxy study of its sedimentary record. Using sedimentological, 

geochemical and, especially, the analysis of the diatom assemblages making up its recent fossil 

record, we identify the main changes in alternative stable states sensu Scheffer (2004) and 

dilucidate the natural, such as the periods of Rapid Climate Change (Mayewski et al., 2004), 

and/or anthropogenic determinants behind them. We also explore whether its most recent 

history is more influenced by local forcing factors or by global phenomena such as the present 

day accelerated sea-level rise caused by climate change.

4.3.2 RESULTS 

4.3.2.1 Sedimentology and Stratigraphy  

Core LM6-2 reached a depth of 82 cm below surface, and the sediment was found to be 

relatively uniform in terms of texture, though with different contributions of calcium 

carbonate (CaCO3) and organic matter (OM). Sedimentological analysis (Fig. 4.3.1), revealed 

the presence of three different lithological units, defined by stratigraphically constrained 

cluster analysis based on CONISS method (Grimm, 1987). The basal Unit I consisted essentially 

of organic muds low in calcium carbonate. Unit II is mainly made up by muddy sediments with 

higher CaCO3 content. Unit III is similar to Unit I, but richer in CaCO3 and OM.  

A detailed description of these three units, according to the clay (&amp;lt;2 µm) fraction, pH of 

sediment and % OM and CaCO3 is given below: 

Unit I (82 – 45cm): Consists of a sub-alcaline organic mud with nil to low (% &amp;lt;1.5) content in 

CaCO3. The % of coarse-sized particles (&gt; 63 µm) consists mainly of plant fibres. The proportion 

of clay is higher in both the basal (from the base of the core to 64 cm - 14.5 to 19.3 %) and 

upper sections (55 to 45 cm - 15.8 - 18.2 %), with a middle section (64 to 55 cm) showing lower 

values (9.8 to 13.9 %). OM varies mainly between 6.8 and 12 %, being consistently higher than 

10% from 60 to 45 cm (Fig. 4.3.1).  

Unit II (45 – 11 cm): The sediments are very similar in pH to the previous unit (sub-alcaline), 

but the % of coarse-sized (&gt; 63 µm) particles (consisting of plant fibres and minerogenic sand) 

is the lowest found in the whole core (0.7 %). The CaCO3 content is slightly higher than in Unit 

I, with several peaks mainly corresponding to bioclasts fragments reaching 3.8 % (mainly in the 

&amp;lt;63 µm fraction). The values decrease towards the top of the unit, where carbonates are 

completely absent. The % of clay varies between 13.2 and 21.1 %, this unit exhibiting the 

higher values of clay in the whole core. OM decreases from around 9 % to 6 % between 45 and 

19 cm and increases from 7 to 9 % between 19 and 10 cm (Fig. 4.3.1). 

Unit III (11 – 0cm): The pH in this unit is homogeneous, but lower than in the lower sections, 

whereas OM reveals the higher values of the whole core. The base of Unit III (represented by 

four samples collected between 7 and 11 cm) records a single event, with higher values of  

% &gt; 63 µm, OM and CaCO3 (13.4 %, 13.8 % and 9.3 % respectively). This corresponds to a sub-

alcaline to neutral slightly sandy mud very rich in OM (7 - 13.8 %) and with also high bioclastic 

CaCO3 content. The top 7 cm consist of neutral organic muds free of CaCO3 (Fig. 4.3.1).

for core LM6-2.  

4.3.2.2 Diatom stratigraphy 

Core LM6-3 was studied for diatom content, giving a record consisting of 138 taxa. Many 

valves showed strong evidence of dissolution or were broken, and this prevented in some 

cases identification to the species level of some forms of Navicula and Amphora s. l.. The 

number of taxa considered for further statistical analyses was reduced to 39, as only those 

reaching a frequency of ? 2 % were considered for quantitative studies (Appendix IIC for 

diatom abundances and appendix IIIC for diatom plates). The resulting diatom abundance 

diagram, with taxa grouped according to their apparent salinity and habitat tolerances (Vos &amp;amp; 

de Wolf, 1993) is shown in Fig. 4.3.2. Diatom Assemblage Zones (DAZs) were delimited with a 

broken-stick model of variance distribution (Bennett, 1996).  Subzones were defined by 

stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis based on CONISS method (Grimm 1987). The 

analyses defined three distinct DAZs (Fig. 4.3.2):

DAZ I (88 - 35cm)  

This zone is mainly characterized by the presence of brackish/freshwater to marine/brackish 

epipelic diatoms, although the epiphytic Cocconeis placentula var. placentula Ehrenberg is the 

most abundant species. Nitzschia frustulum (Kützing) Grunow in Cleve &amp;amp; Grunow is almost 

exclusive of this zone. In spite of being classified as a brackish/freshwater epipelic diatom in 

the Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf (1993) system, this species is common in estuarine euryaline environments 

(Trobajo et al., 2004; Rovira et al., 2012).  

DAZ II (35 - 13 cm)  

The main feature of this zone is the almost disappearance of Nitzschia frustulum. This zone 

was subdivided in two subzones. Subzone DAZIIa (35  - 21cm) is dominated by the 

freshwater/brackish epiphyte Cocconeis placentula, although with some variations in the 

abundance of its different varieties. The subzone is also characterized by moderate 

abundances of the marine/brackish epiphytic Achnanthes brevipes C. Agardh and a subtle 

increase in the brackish/freshwater Pseudostaurosira trainorii Morales. Subzone DAZ IIb  

(21 - 13 cm) exhibits a decrease in the abundance of Cocconeis placentula  in favour 

of Pseudostaurosira trainorii. Cymbella aff. affiniformis Krammer, Synedra tabulata (C. Agardh) 

Kützing, Staurophora salina (Smith) Mereschkowsk and Rhopalodia acuminata Krammer show 

higher abundances in this sub-zone, whereas taxa like Diploneis smithii (Brébisson) Cleve and 

Opephora guenter-grassii (Witkowski &amp;amp; Lange-Bertalot) Sabbe &amp;amp; Vyverman, decrease in 

percentage. Sub-zone DAZ IIb reveals an increase in marine epipelon and marine/ brackish 

epiphytes as well as of tychoplanktonic taxa and Chaetoceros spp. resting pores (although with 

abundance &amp;lt;2 %). 

DAZ III (13 - 0 cm) 

The diatom assemblage in this zone is characterized by the dominance of the 

brackish/freshwater tychoplanktonic Pseudostaurosira trainorii, being sub-dominated by the 

brackish/freshwater epiphyte Cocconeis placentula (mainly Cocconeis placentula var. lineata 

(Ehrenberg) van Heurck). 

Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was performed on the diatom abundance data to 

reveal the length of the dominant gradient for the diatom assemblages and to evaluate the 

unimodal or linear distribution of the data (ter Braak &amp;amp; Prentice, 1988). The obtained length of 

gradient of the first axis (1.713 standard deviation units) was less than 3.0 standard deviation 

units and so, diatom response was assumed to follow a linear distribution. As a result, a PCA 

was subsequently performed to explore the diatom assemblages’ composition under the main 

environmental gradients. Most of the variability is summarized in the first two principal 

components (Fig. 4.3.3). PCA axis 1 and 2 explain 49 % and 19 % of the total variance, 

respectively. Cocconeis placentula var. placentula and Pseudostaurosira trainorii show 

minimum and maximum scores for axis 1, whereas Nitzschia frustulum and Cocconeis 

placentula var. placentula are the two species more positively and 

negatively related to axis 2. Plot of sample scores throughout the core (Fig. 4.3.2), show 

minimum, moderate, and maximum values of PC1 for DAZs I, II and III respectively. PC2 shows 

a net increase from DAZ I to II, declining afterwards in DAZ III.

4.3.2.2.1 Ordination of the fossil samples on the main environmental gradients of the 

WIAC 

Samples from core LM6-3 were used as supplementary passive samples of the Canonical 

Correspondence Analysis (CCA) that analyses the relationship between the present-day species 

data-set of the WIAC and 4 statistically significant environmental variables (Salinity and PO4
3-

 – 

axis 1 and NO3
-
  and DOC – axis 2) (Chapter 4.1). The plot of the fossil samples on the space 

defined by the first two CCA axes (Fig. 4.3.4) shows a limited amount of variation that indicates 

minor environmental long-term changes in the Melides lagoon compared to the present-day 

spatial variability throughout the WIAC. The exhibited trajectories also show that the main 

source of variation is related to the trophic status of the system, mainly associated to NO3 and 

DOC concentrations (axis 1), although variations in salinity and, secondarily, PO4 levels (axis 2) 

also play a significant role. 

 

4.3.2.2.2 Quantitative Salinity Reconstruction 

Salinity changes in the Melides lagoon throughout its recent history were reconstructed 

calculating the diatom-inferred salinity (DI-salinity) from the transfer function developed for 

the water bodies of the WIAC (Chapter 4.1) (Fig. 4.3.5). The component 4 of the Weighted 

Averaging Partial Least Squares Regression (WA-PLS, ter Braak &amp;amp; Juggins, 1993) model was 

used. The resultant DI-salinity values range from 1.51 to 5.7 ‰, (errors ranging from ± 0.29 to 

0.83 ‰), indicating fresh to slightly brackish waters. 

DAZ I, shows the major  range of variation, with both the lowest and  highest salinity  

values of 1.51 ± 0.63 and 5.71 ± 0.30 ‰. DAZ II, shows a gradual increase from low (DAZ IIa, 

1.51 ± 0.60 to 2.96 ±0.47 ‰), to higher DI-salinity values (DAZ IIb, 2.97 ± 0.57 to  

3.87 ± 0.58 ‰). DAZ III, shows a smaller range of variation (2.94 ± 0.73 and 4.35 ± 0.78 ‰).

TC varies between 0.21 and 7.01 %, with a peak at 40.5 cm, probably related to the presence 

of carbonates (Fig. 4.3.1). High TC values are also recorded in the topmost section of the core 

(DAZ III). The lowest values were found at DAZ II. %TOC ranges from 6.78 to 13.76 %. A rising 

trend in %TOC is detected from the base of the core to approximately 50 cm depth, declining 

afterwards until approximately 20 cm depth, when a new rising trend starts. Maximum values 

for the whole core are recorded at DAZ III. %TN shows the same trend as TOC, exhibiting 

higher values at DAZ I and III (Fig. 4.3.6, Table 4.3.1). The ?

4.3.2.4  Geochronology 

For the estimation of sedimentation rates in core LM6-1, 
210

Pb and 
137

Cs were analysed (Fig. 

4.3.7 C). A sedimentation rate of 2.4 mm yr
-1

 was inferred from 
210

Pb activity considering only 

the topmost 5 samples. Below 13.75 cm, the activity profile of 
210

Pb was disregarded, since the 

data strongly suggest incorporation of younger material at this depth and also further 

downcore (Fig. 4.3.7 C), as shown by an increase in 
210

Pb activity (probably by bioturbation). 
137

Cs exhibits a single shallow peak, at 8.75 cm, interpreted as the signature of maximum 

atmospheric fallout from 1963 (Appleby, 2001). This interpretation leads to an inferred 

sedimentation rate of 2.2 mm yr
-1

 that is in agreement with the estimates derived from 
210

Pb. 

Linear extrapolation of this sedimentation rate further downcore would indicate 11.3 cm as 

the depth of the earliest 
137

Cs activity in the core, in correspondence with 1954, the time-

boundary of commencement of nuclear testing. In fact, detectable amounts of 
137

Cs are found 

below that depth, within a core section that is contaminated by more recent materials, as 

indicated by the 
210

Pb activity record. Given that the results of 
137

Cs and 
210

Pb are mutually 

consistent above 13.75 cm, and taking into account the imprecision introduced by the 

thickness of the samples analysed in terms of depth values, 13.75 cm was assumed  as the 

more likely depth for the first appearance of 
137

Cs. 

A number of studies of recent past sediments (e. g., Barker &amp;amp; Bouisset 2001) reported the 

existence of a double-peak profile in 
137

Cs that includes a peak in activity that is attributed to 

the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986. However, not all European locations 

received fall-out from Chernobyl, and at some, the Chernobyl contribution overprints the 

earlier weapon signature, so the two peaks become blurred (Appleby, 2001; Roux &amp;amp; Marshall, 

2011). Records showing both peaks have not been yet found in the SW Portuguese lowlands. 

Single-peak profiles in 
137

Cs are the common pattern in the nearby lagoons (e. g., Santo André  

- LSA11 core, Ramos, 2005) and undoubtedly interpreted as corresponding to 1963. 

Radiocarbon 
14

C ages were obtained from three samples throughout the core LM6-3 (Table 

4.3.2). Results show that the lowest sample corresponds to the older one but an age reversal 

exists between samples taken at 34.5 and 44.5cm. This was considered in the two age-models 

(A and B) shown in Fig. 4.3.7, where each of these two samples were considered as outliers. 

Model A excludes sample Beta – 327816 (44.5 cm), whereas model B excludes sample Beta – 

333509 (34.5 cm).

The combination of ages obtained from radiocarbon dating and inferred from
 137

Cs activity 

(here reported as “radiocarbon ages” and “non-radiocarbon ages” in Table 4.3.3) were used to 

construct two age-models using the CLAM version 2.1 (Blaauw, 2010), for the software R (R 

Development Core Team, 2010). This code calibrates the 
14

C ages using the IntCal09 calibration 

curve (Reimer et al., 2009) and yields results in cal yr BP. Linear interpolation was chosen to 

create the models A and B in Fig. 4.3.7. The model generates interpolated ages for each core 

centimetre associated with a 95 % confidence level, based on the ‘best’ age- depth model.

Model B was chosen based on its simpler assumptions. Considering the Model A, the 44.5 cm 

sample would correspond to an incorporation of recent carbon by bioturbation. It would imply 

that the diatom record at 44.5 cm (DAZ I, Fig. 4.3.2) would be more similar to the  

DAZ IIa. Since this condition is not verified (Fig. 4.3.2), plus the fact that there is a strong  

continuity in diatom record until 35cm (DAZ I) and in unit I from the sedimentary record (until 

45cm, Fig. 4.3.1), it is reasonable to assume that there is no bioturbation, and the sample 44.5 

cm is an outlier. Hence interpolated ages are from here on based on the ‘best’ age-depth 

model from the CLAM age-depth model B. 

SRs were estimated for the composite sequence using the constructed model B, yielding four 

SRs (Fig. 4.3.7 D): (1) 0.7 mm yr

 (88 to 44.5 cm) (2) 0.3 mm yr

4.3.3 DISCUSSION 

4.3.3.1 Meaning of the diatom assemblages and Geochemical Proxies 

The dominance of benthic taxa throughout the core somewhat hinders ecological explanations 

for the meaning of the diatom assemblages, since ecology of benthic diatoms is in general less 

known than that of planktonic diatoms (Round et al., 1990). Results of PCA indicate however 

two major sources of variation in the diatom assemblages. PC1 (49 % explained variance) is 

strongly related to the abundance of Pseudostaurosira trainorii in the sediments. Autoecology 

of this taxon is not fully known yet, but it has been found in a wide range of phosphorous 

concentration and conductivity conditions (Morales, 2001). Its eurioic character is surely a 

reflection of the opportunistic behaviour of the Fragilaria s. l. group to which it belongs. This 

genus has traditionally been considered as characteristic of shallow-water periphytic habitats 

under conditions of environmental instability (Reed et al., 1999). For the particular case of 

coastal environments, they occur in high percentages before, during, and after the contact of a 

continental water body with the ocean (Stabell, 1985; Denys, 1990). Interpretation of PC1 in 

the Lagoa de Melides can therefore be related to instable environmental conditions associated 

to events of both connection and isolation from the ocean (i. e., barrier breaching/closing).

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE

91 
 

Changes in barrier permeability are at present the main forcing factor on the perturbation of 

the lagoon characteristics (Freitas et al., 2011). 

PC2 (19 % explained variance) relates, on the one hand, epipelic (minimum score for Nitzschia 

frustulum) and, on the other hand, epiphytic diatom taxa (maximum score for Cocconeis 

placentula var. placentula) that need macrophytes to live. It is known that epipelon is more 

abundant in unvegetated areas than in those containing abundant macrophytes, probably as a 

consequence of reduced irradiance at the sediment surface or because macrophytes 

outcompete epipelon for nutrients (Goldsborough &amp;amp; Robinson, 1996). PC2 can tentatively be 

interpreted in terms of the alternative stable state hypothesis of shallow lakes (Scheffer et al., 

1993; Scheffer &amp;amp; van Nes, 2007). According to this model, shallow lake systems can have two 

opposite alternative states with regard to the development of macrophytes: a macrophyte-

dominated equilibrium at low nutrient and turbidity conditions (clear state), and a turbid 

unvegetated situation favoured by high nutrient concentrations (turbid state). Changes in PC2 

scores define three distinct phases in the evolution of the lagoon that roughly coincide with 

the main DAZs (Fig. 4.3.2): a clear state corresponding to the top of DAZ-I and the whole DAZ-

II, and two turbid states represented by the bottom and half of DAZ-I, and the whole DAZ-III. 

The close correspondence between shifts in PC2 and TOC from the top of DAZ-I to the top of 

the entire sequence supports this interpretation. 

Results of PCA indicate that both changes in environmental stability, mainly associated to 

barrier breaching variability (Fig. 4.3.2), and in nutrient state, are responsible for most of the 

variation in the diatom assemblages, as the projection of passive fossil samples on the CCA of 

present-day samples from the WIAC (Chapter 4.1) also reflects (Fig. 4. 3. 4). Also, the three 

main species confirming the diatom assemblages, from bottom to top, Nitzschia frustulum, 

Cocconeis placentula, and Pseudostaurosira trainorii, constitute part of the most relevant taxa 

discriminating the different major coastal environments of the WIAC according to results of 

the cluster analyses (Chapter 4.1). DAZ-I would therefore be characterized by a more open 

lagoon type (dominance of Nitzschia frustulum, an euryaline species typical of estuaries 

according to Rovira et al., 2012) compared to the more restricted conditions represented by 

DAZs II and III (dominance of Cocconeis placentula and Pseudostaurosira trainorii). 

The lack of a close resemblance between the DI-salinity and the ?
13

C suggests that changes in 

fluvial vs. marine inputs of organic matter on the system play a minor role on C fractionation in 

Melides. By contrast, ?
13

C major trends follow variations in TOC, with the exception of a short 

interval in DAZ-IB and the topmost part of the core. Although other factors such as source of 

organic matter (pelagic vs. land-derived, fluvial vs. marine), diagenesis, dominant vegetation 

within the watershed or changes in metabolic pathways for C fixation can have contributed to 

the fractionation of C (Meyers &amp;amp; Teranes, 2001; Cohen, 2003; Lamb et al., 2006), the 

parallelism between the two curves suggests that changes in productivity have played the 

most significant role in Melides.

The interpretation of the ?
15

N record is more difficult, not only because of the complexity of 

processes that intervene in N fractionation (Talbot, 2001), but to the lack of a clear match with 

other independent proxies in the Melides record. In lagoonal systems light values of ?
15

N are 

characteristic of increased contribution of organic matter from land, whereas rises in ?
15

N are 

interpreted as the product of the increased contribution of the autochthonous organic matter 

fraction (Müller &amp;amp; Voss, 1999). However the large extent of biogeochemical processes taking 

part in N fractionation in lagoons (ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, nitrate 

dissimilatory reduction and nutrient assimilation) make difficult interpretation of ?
15

N 

sedimentary records in terms of provenance of organic matter (Müller &amp;amp; Voss, 1999). The lack 

of a correspondence between the Corg/Ntotal and ?
15

N curves of Melides suggests that other 

factors intervene more directly on N fractionation in this system than the origin of organic 

matter. 

Finally, most of the organic matter sedimentation in the lagoon had a pelagic or slightly mixed 

source, as indicated by values of the Corg/Ntotal ratio ranging from 6.2 to 12.0 (Meyers &amp;amp; 

Teranes, 2001).

4.3.3.3 Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction 

According to the available multiproxy data, Melides was always a lagoon system with small 

tidal influence in the last 1745 years, but subject to changes in its connection with the ocean 

and trophic conditions. Up to six distinct stages can be distinguished in its evolution (Fig. 

4.3.8).  

 Stage A (interpolated age c. 1692 – 1417 cal yr BP; 260-530 cal yr CE) 

The history of the lagoon starts with a codominance of epipelic (mainly made up by Nitzschia 

frustulum) and epiphytic diatom communities (mainly Cocconeis placentula) of primarily 

brackish/freshwater character typical of lagoons of small tidal influence (Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1993). 

Throughout this stage the increase in ?
13

C, which is paralleled by OM and TOC, indicates an 

increase in productivity (Teranes &amp;amp; Bernasconi, 2005), as the low values of PC2 also suggest. 

This interpretation is supported by the high abundances of Nitzschia frustulum, a species 

tolerant to high organic matter and nutrient concentrations (Denys, 1991a,b; van Dam, 1994; 

Trobajo et al., 2004) and by the present-day observation that this species is typical of two 

eutrophic lagoons in the Portuguese coast, Óbidos and Albufeira (Chapter 4.1). Most of the 

productivity relied on algae at this stage, as indicated by the Corg/Ntotal ratios (Lamb et al., 

2006). Although there is a small difference between net and peak values of ?
15

N 

(approximately 2 ‰), its peak, together with a drop on Corg/Ntotal and a rise of ?
13

C, may 

indicate stratification or eutrophication conditions (Bratton et al., 2003) leading to an anoxic or 

suboxic environment at the bottom. This would result in bacterial denitrification and, 

consequently, heavier N in the sediments (Cohen, 2003; Meyers &amp;amp; Teranes, 2001) (Fig. 4.3.8). 

All the evidences indicate that, in the spectrum of eutrophic conditions, the system would fall 

close to a turbid phase in the alternative stable states hypothesis (Scheffer et al., 1993).

Stage B (interpolated age c. 1417-1101 cal BP; 530 – 850 cal CE) 

This stage is characterized by minor fluctuations in the OM content of the sediments that 

however show a net increase (Fig. 4.3.8). It starts with a ?
15

N peak that might indicate the 

persistence of anoxic or suboxic conditions at the bottom. The ecological stability of the 

system is reduced, as evidenced by the increase in Pseudostaurosira trainorii (higher values for 

PC1) (Fig. 4.3.8). Barrier breaching, with associated short-term changes that favoured the 

development of opportunistic taxa and an increase in salinity (Fig. 4.3.8), could account for 

more instable conditions. As a result, the bottom probably became more oxygenated, and this 

might be the reason for the drop in ?
15

N values. Evidence of a less restricted environment, 

more connected to the ocean, is also provided by the presence of calcareous nannoplankton at 

this time interval (M. J. Ramalho unpublished data in Cruces, in prep., Fig. 4.3.8). In spite of the 

existence of more renewed waters, the lagoon did not relax its trophic condition, as indicated 

by the TOC and ?
13

C net increases. At the start of this stage, values of the Corg/Ntotal ratio rise, 

indicating enhanced allochthonous organic loads. These are also suggested by the negative 

excursion in ?
13

C that, during this particular event, seems to be more related to inputs of 

organic matter of continental origin than to productivity (Lamb et al., 2006). At the end of this 

stage DI-salinity shows a peak that coincides with a peak in calcareous nannoplankton (M. J. 

Ramalho unpublished data in Cruces, in prep., Fig. 4.3.8). The gradual decline in the PC1 values 

however suggest that the rise in salinity might likely be the result of punctual episodes of 

barrier breaching not significantly affecting the stability of the biological communities in the 

mid-term.  

Stage C (interpolated age c. 1101-755 cal yr BP; 850-1200 cal yr CE) 

A gradual major transition that involves a change in sedimentary units, among others, takes 

place during this stage. A decline in DI-salinity is accompanied by a more stable environment, 

as indicated by low values of PC1 (Fig. 4.3.8). These observations point to a more restricted 

communication with the ocean. In spite of the development of a less permeable lagoon, there 

are no clear evidences of a significant water level rise. Quite the contrary, the Corg/Ntotal ratio 

decreases, indicating reduced organic matter inputs and therefore likely reduced precipitation 

in the region. Oligohaline conditions would however be maintained by reduced connection 

with the ocean. In turn, productivity decreases, as indicated by the TOC content in the 

sediments (Fig. 4.3.8), and the system gradually experiences a change to a clear phase 

(Scheffer et al., 1993). This is corroborated by the partial replacement of epipelic by epiphytic 

diatoms (increase in PC2), that suggests significant macrophytic development. In spite of the 

difficulties in interpreting ?
15

N records (Talbot, 2001), it might be the case, as in previous 

stages, that the ?
15

N peak at the start of this stage might be related to an anoxic or suboxic 

bottom of the lagoon due to a more restricted environment. 

Stage D (interpolated age c. 755 -255 cal yr BP; 1200-1700 cal yr CE) 

An increase in DI-salinity points to more intense and/or frequent barrier breaching during this 

stage. Intensified connection to the ocean is also suggested by the presence of calcareous

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

 2013

 

94 
 

nannoplankton (M. J. Ramalho unpublished data in Cruces in prep., Fig. 4.3.8) and Chaetoceros 

spp. resting pores, the latter, a predominantly marine diatom taxon, that may be indicative of 

entrances of marine water conveyed either through the inlet or barrier overwash. Values of 

PC1 indicate increased environmental instability that is very likely explained by frequent shifts 

in the water column characteristics of the lagoon associated to barrier breaching. 

Consequences of a more persistent opening of the inlet were twofold. On the one hand, 

renewed waters probably favoured a relaxation of the trophic state of the system, as 

suggested by the decreasing trends in the TOC and ?
13

C profiles (Fig. 4.3.8). On the other hand, 

a second probable implication of barrier breaching was the lagoon shallowing, which favoured 

the development of macrophytes, as suggested by the increased abundance of epiphytic 

diatoms, many of marine/brackish affinity. The diatom community codominated by epipelic 

and epiphytic diatoms of the previous stages is replaced by an epiphytic-dominated 

community (Fig. 4.3.8). Submerged macrophytes would be benefited by the lower nutrient and 

turbidity conditions that the TOC and ?
13

C records suggest, so the shift from a turbid to a clear 

phase, initiated during the previous stage, is consolidated at this time. This shift to a clear 

state, in the sense of Scheffer et al. (1993), was however never close to the equilibrium line 

proposed by these authors, since algal productivity was still dominant, as reflected by the 

Corg/Ntotal signal in the sediments (Fig. 4.3.8).  

Stage E (interpolated age c. 255 to -5 cal yr BP; 1700- 1950 cal yr CE) 

During this stage the trend in salinity increase persists, as shown by the DI-salinity record, and 

instable environmental conditions seem to be reinforced looking at the PC1 profile (Fig. 4.3.8). 

Connection of the system with the ocean was at least as common as in the previous stage. Low 

TOC and ?
13

C values suggest that productivity conditions were also similar, in spite TOC 

showing a slight increase at the top. In spite of these similarities with the previous stage, 

epiphytic diatoms show a sharp decline, suggesting a transitional phase with less macrophytic 

cover and the likely start of a new gradual change towards a turbid state, as the modest TOC 

increase would support. Entrance of organic matter of continental origin, as indicated by the 

increase in the Corg/Ntotal ratio, could be, among other factors, behind this still modest change 

in the trophism of the system. 

Stage F (interpolated age c. -5 to -53 cal yr BP; 1950-2003 cal yr CE) 

The previous transitional stage is followed by a situation where the highest TOC content and 

minimum abundances of epiphytic diatoms of the whole record occur. This circumstance 

points to a shift toward one the end terms in the alternative states model, when a critical 

turbidity threshold is surpassed and macrophytes can even disappear (Scheffer et al., 1993). It 

can be hypothesized that present-day hypertrophic conditions (Freitas et al., 2011) started to 

be acquired at this time. 

To disentangle the main underlying reason for the productivity increase, the 10-year moving 

average precipitation from the close meteorological station of Grândola for the period 1932 to 

1999 was plotted contiguous to the Corg/Ntotal ratio curve (Fig. 4.3.8). Peak precipitation 

coincides with the increase in TOC, suggesting a possible link between productivity and the

arrival of nutrients from the catchment. Yet, even at times of reduced precipitation, the TOC 

increasing trend is maintained, pointing to an uncoupling between external nutrient loads and 

productivity in the system. The high organic matter and nutrient concentration condition is 

accompanied by the maximum peak in the ?
15

N record, probably indicating common anoxic or 

suboxic conditions at the bottom of the lagoon. Accumulation of organic matter at the bottom 

under low oxygen concentration might result in P release (van Nes et al., 2007), so internal 

nutrient recycling could have prompted high productivity conditions irrespective of nutrient 

allochthonous entrances in the system. 

Moderate barrier permeability seems to be maintained at this time, as the still high values of 

DI-salinity and persistence of instable conditions as the PC1 record indicate. In the more recent 

times of this stage, significant openings of the barrier occurred, as evidenced by the calcareous 

nannoplankton and foraminifera records (M. J. Ramalho and M. Alday unpublished data in 

Cruces in prep., Fig. 4.3.8). These however were probably episodic, as no significant increase in 

the DI-salinity is recorded, nor a change to more instable conditions, as shown by the PC1 

record, occurs. In spite of the regular connection with the ocean, this seems to have had no 

effect on the relaxation of the trophic condition of the system, at least on the long-term. 

4.3.3.4 Main forcing in the evolution of the lagoon 

Long-term evolution of lagoon systems is the result of the complex interplay among different 

processes taking place at regional and local scales (Bird, 1994). The multiproxy record of the 

evolution of the Melides lagoon allows us to identify changes in marine influence and 

continental supply as the main agents provoking the major environmental changes detected in 

this short time-span, 1745 years. Results of the plot of passive samples in the CCA of diatom 

and environmental variables from the surface sediment data-set of the WIAC (Chapter 4.1) 

indicates that the main source of variation in the diatom assemblages is related to changes in 

the salinity and in trophic status (Fig. 4.3.4). Whereas significant changes in trophic status are 

also supported by results of PCA (axis PC2) and independent geochemical proxy data (mainly 

variations in TOC and ?
13

C), variations in salinity triggered by changes in barrier permeability 

are confirmed by the detected shifts in DI-salinity and results of the PCA (axis PC1) (Fig. 4.3.8). 

As a result of these variations, the lagoon experienced one major change in relation to marine 

connection (from an open to a more restricted lagoon that lasted from around 850 to 1700 cal 

yr CE) and two major changes in the trophic status that can be interpreted in terms of the 

alternative stable state hypothesis of shallow lakes (Scheffer &amp;amp; van Nes, 2007). A change from 

a turbid to a clear phase occurred between 850 and 1700 cal yr CE, followed by a transitional 

phase, and a return to a turbid state from 1950 cal yr CE to present-day. Whether there are 

causal climatic reasons for these changes or more local factors intervene behind them is 

however ambiguous on the light of the data. The LM6 sequence encompasses 1745 years of 

coastal environmental evolution that cover some global periods of Rapid Climate Change 

(Mayewski et al., 2004) such as the Roman Warm Period (RWP, 250 cal yr BCE – 450 cal yr CE; 

Desprat et al., 2003), the Dark Ages (DA, 450-950 cal yr CE; Desprat et al., 2003; Álvarez et al., 

2005), the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA, 950-1250 cal yr CE; Mann et al., 2009), the Little 

Ice Age (LIA, 1350-1850 cal yr CE; Wanner et al., 2008) and the Recent Period (Fig. 5.1B, 

Chapter 5). Previous evidences in this lagoon and in the close interdune coastal peat dune

slack of Barbaroxa and Sancha, located 7 km south, point to episodes of terrestrialization and 

inundation likely driven by climatic shifts (Cruces et al., 2011). It is therefore relevant to study 

the relationship between the main stages in the recent evolution of the lagoon and the known 

late Holocene periods of Rapid Climate Change (Fig. 5.1B, Chapter 5). 

The bottom of the Melides record covers approximately the last half of the RWP (Stage A). This 

period has specifically been characterized for the Iberian Peninsula and referred to as the 

Iberian–Roman Humid Period (IRHP, 550 cal yr BCE to 350 cal yr CE), the most humid phase of 

the last 4000 years in southern Spain (Martín-Puertas et al., 2008, 2009). Humidity conditions 

during this interval were however not homogeneous. Stage A of the Melides record falls during 

the decline of the Roman Empire, when humid conditions were reactivated after an arid event 

(Martín-Puertas et al., 2009). Although values of the Corg/Ntotal ratio suggest a mixture of 

autochthonous and land-derived organic matter, the most significant increase in the inputs of 

continental organic material do not occur during this phase but latter (Stage B), during the DA. 

This period has been identified as a cold and dry phase from northern Iberian records (Desprat 

et al., 2003; Andrade et al., 2011; Martín-Chivelet et al., 2011). Even taking into consideration 

a more restricted chronology for this period (approximately 400-650 cal yr CE, e. g., Abrantes 

et al., 2005; Gil et al., 2006; Lebreiro et al., 2006), the DA appear in the Melides record as a 

period of increased continental loads and productivity. The strong consistency of the data that 

indicate less humid conditions for the DA in the Iberian Peninsula (including lower lake levels in 

southern Spain, Martín-Puertas et al., 2008), suggest that the climatic signal can be masked in 

the Melides record, as for the IRHP and for this time interval. Both periods concur with the 

development of an open lagoon with less restricted ocean influence, as indicated mainly by the 

composition of the diatom assemblages, the DI-salinity, and the presence of calcareous 

nannopankton in the sediments. It can be hypothesized that either increased marine influence, 

with associated environmental instability (PC1), acted to obscure the true climatic signal 

associated to the IHRP and DA in the Melides record or, less probably, that a real trend of 

enhanced precipitation throughout those periods took place. 

The most significant change in the Melides lagoon took place, however, when the system 

transformed from an open to a more restricted lagoon, also coinciding with a gradual 

modification of its trophic status from a turbid to a clear phase (Stage C). The start of this 

change roughly coincides with the onset of the MCA that involved warm and relatively arid 

conditions in the Mediterranean Iberia (Moreno et al., 2012). Palaeoenvironmental data from 

the Melides lagoon is compatible with a warm and dry regime in the area. Reduced 

allochthonous nutrient inputs to the lagoon associated to low precipitation by a pervasive 

positive state of the NAO (Trouet et al., 2009; Mann et al., 2009) might be the natural cause for 

a change of state from a turbid to a clear phase that would have facilitated extensive 

macrophytic coverage in the lagoon. On the other hand, persistence of a NAO positive phase in 

the SW European Atlantic coast seem to have favoured reduced storminess activity compared 

to the subsequent LIA (Trouet et al., 2012). The Melides record shows that during the MCA 

connection with the ocean was reduced to a minimum, suggesting that attenuated storminess 

could have played a significant role on the reduction of barrier permeability at this time. 

Afterwards, from 1200 to 1700 cal yr CE, Melides experienced a gradual salinization (Stage D)

that could likely be related to the climatic MCA/LIA transition that involved more intense 

storms (Costas et al. 2012; Trouet et al., 2012), promoting increased permeability of the sand 

barrier. Whereas the MCA/LIA transition could have been responsible for a return to a more 

open condition of the lagoon, it seems however not to have acted on the change to a new 

trophic state. The clear phase in the lagoon persisted from the MCA to the end of the LIA, 

when productivity started to recover (Stage E). The scenario of more humid conditions in 

Iberia during the LIA, relatively to the MCA (e. g., Abrantes et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2012), is 

consistent with the observed increase in the Corg/Ntotal ratio in Melides at this time. It also 

coincides with the start of the so called terrestrialization phase of Queiroz &amp;amp; Mateus (2004) 

and the progradation of the fluvial system into the lagoon (Cabral et al., 2006; Cearreta et al., 

2007). Enhanced continental loads however did not promote an increase in productivity as in 

previous phases (Stage B). Rather than caused by low temperatures associated to the LIA 

(minimum productivity, as indicated by the TOC levels, is coincident with the Maunder 

Minimum of 1675-1715 cal yr CE, Luterbacher et al., 2000), a local driving factor, intensified 

interchange of water between the ocean and the lagoon, and could have maintained low 

productivity levels in the system. Present-day evidences demonstrate that phosphorous 

concentrations can be reduced up to 100 times in Melides when the inlet is artificially opened 

(Freitas et al., 2011). It is therefore very probably a matter of balance between intensity and 

frequency of barrier breaching and degree of continental nutrient loads what makes the 

lagoon to naturally be more (Stage B) or less (Stages D and E) productive, and therefore to shift 

between different alternative states. 

The recent evolution of the lagoon is mostly a reflection of human activities in the system. 

Historical records indicate that artificial barrier breaching of Melides began at least in 1839 CE 

(Cruces, 2001), being intensified in more recent times. Human intervention on the system not 

only includes the opening of the inlet, but also several activities performed in the catchment 

area, such as inert extraction (increasing solid suspension), intense rice production (delivering 

nutrients and pesticides), livestock farming activities (not only increasing organic matter and 

nutrient levels, but also bringing pathogens to the system), and discharges from two 

wastewater treatment plants (Freitas et al., 2009). These impacts are evidenced in the Melides 

sedimentary record since 1950 cal yr CE (Stage F), triggering a change from a clear to a turbid 

state, as indicated by the highest TOC levels and minimum abundances of epiphytic diatoms. 

The shift of state agrees with the present day hypertrophic condition of the lagoon, where 

phosphorous concentrations &gt; 5000 µg L
-1

 can be reached (Freitas et al., 2011). Although the 

short lived periods of sand barrier breaching can induce a significant lowering of nutrient 

levels, the fast recovery of pre-opening concentrations is however a common feature in lagoon 

systems (Suzuki et al., 1998). It is also known that once a system has switched to a turbid state, 

a strong nutrient reduction is necessary for a reversion to a clear phase (Scheffer et al., 1993). 

The evolution recorded during Stage F indicates that artificial breaching of the barrier had just 

a limited short-term impact on the trophic status of the lagoon that maintains its turbid 

condition since at least 1950 cal yr CE. However, the use of biodegradable fertilizers since 2004 

under the Integrated Protected System Management Policy (Freitas et al., 2009) brings the 

possibility of a relaxation of the hypertrophic status of the lagoon in the mid-term.

98 
 

Another human-induced factor, accelerated sea-level rise associated to global warming, seem 

to have however played a secondary role on the recent evolution of the lagoon. The record 

shows increased environmental instability from the most recent parts of Stage E to the lower 

half of Stage F, coetaneous to the 1905-1945 cal yr CE time period, when modern rates of 

accelerated sea-level rise started (Gehrels &amp;amp; Woodworth, 2013). Yet, this trend is reversed in 

the last decades, which also do not show any consistent pattern of increase in salinity. The 

recent record, therefore, shows no indication of any sea drowning prompted by the present-

day accelerated sea-level rise, suggesting that the response of the lagoon is largely more 

dependent on local conditions (Williams, 2013). The Melides lagoon would thus confirm the 

increased control on the dynamics of the Portuguese barrier-lagoonal system by local driving 

agents instead of climatic variability or present accelerated sea-level rise in their more recent 

history (Bao et al., 1999; Freitas et al., 2005; Dinis et al., 2006). 

 

4.3.4 CONCLUSION  

The sedimentary record of the Melides lagoon shows that the evolution of this system in the 

last 1745 years experienced changes in its ecological condition forced by regional, mainly 

climatic, and local, mainly man-induced, factors. All these agents acted simultaneously, 

producing an overlapped signal that cannot be easily disentangled. Whereas anthropogenic 

influence produced a quite clear signal in the sedimentary record, the effects of the Late 

Holocene periods of Rapid Climate Change on the evolution of the system are at some time 

intervals ambiguous on the light of the data. 

Changes in barrier permeability and trophic status were the main components of 

environmental change at decadal to centennial scales in this system. These can be understood 

in the framework of the shallow lakes alternative stable state hypothesis.  

From the period 260-850 cal yr CE the lagoon exhibited its more open condition, which 

however kept the water body in a turbid phase and always within the range of oligohaline to 

slightly mesohaline waters. During the 530-850 cal yr CE interval the recorded intensification 

of organic matter loads of continental origin are not in agreement with the well-established 

dry conditions for the DA in the Iberian Peninsula. It is therefore hypothesized that the climatic 

signature in the sedimentary record is masked by the environmental noise introduced by the 

frequent and/or intense breaching of the barrier rather than reflecting increased precipitation 

at these times. 

From around 850 to 1700 cal yr CE the lagoon transformed into a more restricted environment 

as a result of reduced connection to the ocean through a less permeable sand barrier, 

although there is an increase in the barrier permeability towards the end of this period. On the 

other hand, two major shifts in its trophic status occurred when the system changed very 

gradually its turbid equilibrium state to a clear phase in the period from 850 to 1700 cal yr CE, 

followed by a transitional phase, and a return to a new turbid state acquired from 1950 cal yr 

CE to present-day, when hypertrophic conditions are recorded.

As the lagoon experienced reduced barrier permeability, being converted in a more restricted 

environment, there is a closer correspondence between the known palaeoclimatic events in 

the Iberian Peninsula and environmental changes taking place in the lagoon. The gradual 

transformation from the turbid to the clear state (850-1700 cal yr CE) starts with the onset of 

the warm and relatively arid MCA. Reduced precipitation associated to a pervasive positive 

phase of the NAO could have been the natural trigger for the ecological transformation of the 

lagoon into a clear state, diminishing external nutrient loads. These were again accentuated 

during the LIA, when humid conditions in the Iberian Peninsula prevailed. Humidity did not 

however prompt a rapid transformation to a new turbid phase, probably because renewed 

connection to the ocean counteracted avoiding increased nutrient concentrations in the 

system. The gradual change to a new equilibrium phase lasted from 1700 to 1950 cal yr CE. It is 

at this latter date when the lagoon probably acquired its present turbid condition as a result of 

intensified intervention in the system that introduced high loads of fertilizers from the 

catchment. In spite of being anthropogenic influence the main forcing agent in the evolution of 

the lagoon since 1950 cal yr CE, there are no evidences of drowning induced by the present-

day accelerated sea-level rise.

5.2 PRESENT-DAY DIATOM DEAD ASSEMBLAGES IN THE WIAC AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP 

WITH THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS 

 

The studied lowlands of the Western Iberian Atlantic Coast (WIAC) – Valdoviño, Doniños, 

Traba, Louro, Xuño, Muro, Illa de Arousa, Bodeira, Minho, Lima, Vela, Óbidos, Albufeira, Sado, 

Melides, Santo André, Barbaroxa de Baixo and Mira - are characterized by a large range of 

environmental conditions. It is this large environmental gradient what makes possible the 

construction of quantitative inference models for physico-chemical variables from the past as 

an aid to reconstruct the long term history of these systems (e. g., Birks, 2010). Before trying to 

know the main environmental changes that occurred in two case studies of the WIAC (Melides 

and Traba) in the last centuries, a study relating the distribution of dead diatom assemblages 

throughout the WIAC and the main environmental gradients ruling them was performed. 

Diatom-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, whether qualitative or quantitative, rely 

on the fidelity of fossil diatom assemblages to the diatom biocenoses they come from (Birks &amp;amp; 

Birks, 1980). However, in the taphonomic pathway from the biocoenoses to the death 

assemblage or thanatocoenoses preserved in the sediments information is inevitably lost. The 

lack of correspondence between fossil data and their contemporary environment has 

profound implications on palaeoenvironmental inferences (Battarbee et al., 2005; Ryves et al., 

2009). Coastal environments are highly dynamic systems where taphonomical biases can be 

particularly accentuated by removal of species by breakage or dissolution, or by the transport 

of allochthonous taxa by tidal currents among other processes (e. g., Beyens &amp;amp; Denys, 1982; 

Vos &amp;amp; de Wolf, 1988; Sherrod et al., 1989; Sherrod, 1999; Sawai, 2001; Hassan et al., 2008). 

Although it was beyond the scope of this thesis to precisely quantify the linkage between 

present-day diatom distribution in bottom sediments and the live assemblages they come 

from, the comparison with the available data on benthic diatom biocoenoses of the 

Portuguese coast (Resende et al., 2005, 2007; Ribeiro, 2010; Gomes et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 

2013) show very close similarities between diatom biocenoses and thanatocoenoses in 

present-day bottom sediments. Because almost all the studied water bodies correspond to

very shallow environments, this conclusion should not be extrapolated to the few water bodies 

of the WIAC with average water depths &gt; 3 m. 

The three major types of environments sampled in this study, i. e., coastal lakes and ponds, 

lagoons and estuaries, showed clearly distinct diatom assemblages in their present-day bottom 

sediments that can be used to differentiate sedimentary environments by means of facies 

analysis in long-term records. The statistical multivariate analyses of the data also showed that 

changes in salinity, PO4
3-

, NO
3-

 and DOC are the drivers that make diatom thanatocoenoses in 

present-day bottom sediments to be distinct in the major types of environments. In spite of 

the likely influence of other environmental variables (no taken into account in this study), such 

as water depth, sediment composition or tidal levels, this result agrees with the well-known 

major roles that salinity and nutrient concentration gradients play on the diatom 

thanatocoenoses in present-day bottom sediments of coastal environments elsewhere (e. g., 

Weckström et al., 2004; Snoeijs &amp;amp; Weckström, 2010). It is not surprising either that these 

variables are the main factor ruling the composition of the diatom assemblages in the 

wetlands of the WIAC, since they are strongly affected by changes in barrier permeability. This, 

either natural or artificial, have major effects on the present-day nature of the back-barrier 

wetlands in this region (Freitas et al., 2011; Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, in prep.). 

In spite of the difficulties of constructing precise diatom-based quantitative inference models 

for past environmental variables in coastal habitats (Anderson &amp;amp; Vos, 1992), a salinity transfer 

function with a good predictive power was developed for shallow water bodies of the WIAC. 

Quantitative DI-salinities, diatom autoecological data on habitat preferences, and qualitative 

inferences for past nutrient concentrations (i. e., those based on the behaviour of passive fossil 

samples on the space defined by the multivariate analysis of present-day environmental and 

diatom data) were used to reconstruct the main long-term environmental changes in two 

contrasting wetlands of the WIAC, Melides and Traba. Diatom-inferred palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions were supported by independent multiproxy geochemical and sedimentological 

data. The results showed that the dynamics of both systems in the last centuries was 

significantly subject to four main natural and anthropogenic factors: sand-barrier breaching 

(natural and/or human-induced), precipitation, forest cover (natural and/or human-induced), 

and cultural eutrophication. A fifth factor, sea-level change, exerted a minor or no control at 

the time scales considered. The complex interplay among these factors prompted large 

ecological regime shifts interpreted in the framework of the Alternative Stable State 

Hypothesis of Shallow Lakes (e. g., Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer, 2004). Both water bodies 

experienced phases of equilibrium with reduced nutrient concentrations and low turbidity 

conditions that favoured submerged macrophytic development (clear state), and others, were 

high nutrient concentrations provoked high turbidity and, therefore few submerged plants 

(turbid state). The long-term evolution of these systems show that the mentioned forcing 

factors played different roles through time, as explained below.

5.3 LONG-TERM MAIN DRIVING AGENTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF TWO WETLANDS IN THE 

WIAC 

5.3.1 CHANGES IN BARRIER PERMEABILITY 

Previous palaeoecological research on the WIAC has identified barrier breaching as one of the 

most significant forcing factors in the evolution of back-barrier lagoon systems (Bao et al., 

1999, 2007; Cearreta et al., 2003; Freitas et al., 2002a,b, 2003; Andrade et al., 2004). The 

effects of barrier permeability are mainly manifested as salinity, water level, and nutrient 

concentration changes in the water body which could have significant consequences on its 

ecological status. Melides and Traba represent two systems with ephemeral inlets which 

however show relevant differences in terms of connection to the ocean. In the most recent 

times Melides experienced natural and man-induced inlet breaching since the 19
th

 century 

(Cruces, 2001). By contrast, the first known large human intervention in the outlet of Traba 

dates 1992. The two systems also showed contrasting barrier permeability regimes for the 

time period that they share in common. Since approximately 1470 cal yr CE, Melides showed 

increased connection to the ocean that is maintained in moderate levels from approximately 

1800 cal yr CE to present, as indicated mainly by values of the DI-salinity (Fig. 5.1) and the 

scores of PC1, an indicator of ecological instability. Traba shows an almost inverse pattern, 

being almost isolated from the ocean since approximately 1875 cal yr CE to the decade of the 

1990s when the outlet began to be artificially opened. Also, Melides had a previous history of 

natural more open lagoon like conditions from 260 to 850 cal yr CE. It is at this latter date 

when the system began a gradual change towards more restricted conditions, roughly 

coincident with the start of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA). 

Turbid states are recorded in Melides and Traba at times of increased permeability of the sand 

barriers, and clear phases when the systems reduced their connection to the ocean. Present-

day empirical evidence demonstrates that nutrient levels can strongly be reduced at times of 

barrier breaching in these and other lagoon systems, to be afterwards recovered very fast 

(Suzuki et al., 1998; Freitas et al., 2011; Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, in prep.). It can be hypothesized, 

however, that in the long-term, more permanent connection to the ocean would bring these 

systems to lower nutrient level conditions that would keep them apart of turbid phases (Roselli 

et al., 2013), which seems not to be the case in Melides and Traba. Other factors, such as the 

precipitation regime, should have counteracted to avoid this.  

5.3.2 PRECIPITATION VARIABILITY 

Terrestrial inputs constitute a key source of nutrients in lakes at different environmental 

contexts (Richey &amp;amp; Wissmar, 1979; Wetzel, 2000), so differences in precipitation need to be 

taken into consideration in the absence of a meaningful explanation between the degree of 

barrier permeability and trophic status in Melides and Traba. 

The sedimentary records of Melides and Traba span some of the periods of Rapid Climate 

Change of the Holocene (RCC) (Mayewski et al., 2004), namely the Roman Warm Period (RWP), 

Dark Ages (DA), and the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) for the case of Melides, and the 

Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Recent Period for both records (Fig. 5.1). Similar coastal systems 

elsewhere record ecological changes of state with climatic ameliorations (warmer/humid

periods) being related to turbid regimes, and climatic deteriorations (colder/drier periods) with 

clear phases (Bracco et al., 2005; Inda et al., 2006; García-Rodríguez et al., 2010). Similar 

univocal relationships can be established for Traba, but not so easily for Melides. The long-

term turbid state that characterized Traba from 1470 to 1875 cal yr CE fit into the LIA, a period 

of increased water availability, as evidenced by most continental records in the Iberian 

Peninsula (e. g., Benito et al., 2003; Moreno et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2012) and, particularly, 

Galicia (Schellekens et al., 2010) (Fig. 5.1). Besides the elevated water table at this time, 

diatom data also indicate that there was intensified release of alkalinizing base cations derived 

from the catchment, both evidences of high water availability in the area. It has been 

suggested that a pervasive negative phase of the NAO seems to be not only behind this wet 

period in the region (Moreno et al., 2008), but related to increased storminess as well (Trouet 

et al., 2012). This is manifested in the Traba record by the intense aeolian activity that brought 

sands from the sand-barrier to the water body and, probably, by the increase in DI-salinity 

values. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction suggests the hypothesis that, in spite of more 

intense and/or frequent barrier breaching, the turbid state in Traba could be naturally induced 

by enhanced nutrient inputs from the catchment under an intensified precipitation regime 

associated to a dominant negative NAO state. This hypothesis is supported by the gradual 

change to a clear state that follows the termination of the LIA, a period of global drier 

conditions (Dai et al., 1997; Hulme et al., 1998; Rowel, 2005) that is also manifested in the 

Iberian Peninsula (Desprat et al., 2013). Changes in allochthonous nutrient flux to the water 

body mediated by precipitation variability, likely associated to the NAO, could therefore 

account for naturally-induced changes in ecological regime shifts in Traba. 

The extent of climate forcing as a major driver in changes in alternative stable states is 

however largely obscured in the Melides sedimentary record. Diatom, sedimentological and 

geochemical data show that for about 600 years (260-850 cal yr CE) dominant ecological 

conditions in Melides could be ascribed to those of a turbid state (Fig. 5.1). Yet, two 

contrasting events of RCC developed throughout this time interval. The transition from one 

humid (RWP) to one dry (DA) period had however no apparent effects on the trophic status of 

the system. Contrary to expected, cold and dry conditions in the peninsula associated to the 

DA (Desprat et al., 2003) are coincident in the sedimentary record with an apparent increase in 

the delivery of land-derived organic matter compared to the previous humid RWP (Martín-

Puertas et al., 2008). DI-salinity shows that during these two periods a more permeable sand 

barrier gave rise to a less confined water body with instable ecological conditions. By contrast, 

the start of the dry MCA (Moreno et al., 2012) matches a gradual change in equilibrium 

towards a clear state. But whereas reduced nutrient inputs from the basin could be the likely 

cause triggering the regime shift, it is not until the period 1200-1700 cal yr CE when the system 

acquired the lowest productivity levels and maximum macrophytic development. Because this 

phase is again related to the enhanced humid conditions associated to the LIA, it can be 

hypothesized that in this case enhanced barrier permeability counteracted to avoid an 

increase in nutrients in the system (Fig. 5.1). 

A common climatic forcing pattern that could explain shifts between different alternative 

states in Melides and Traba before direct human intervention is therefore lacking. The Melides

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

107 
 

record shows a high degree of different and sometimes contradictory overlapping signals that 

probably mask the extent to which climate changes have affected the evolution of the lagoon. 

Times of enhanced connection to the ocean, amplified for the case of Melides because of its 

more open condition throughout its history, probably acted to blur the climatic signal in the 

sedimentary record. A delicate balance between intensity and frequency of barrier breaching 

on one hand, and land-derived nutrient flux probably controlled shifts between different 

alternative states in Melides. By contrast, the levels of much more reduced connection to the 

ocean until human intervention (Bao et al., 2007), facilitated in Traba to validate the causal 

links between climate variability and the type of ecological equilibrium state, i. e., turbid or 

clear. 

 

5.3.3 CHANGES IN FOREST COVER IN THE CATCHMENT 

In spite of the likely role that the precipitation-mediated nutrient influx from the catchment 

played in ecological regime changes in Traba before direct human intervention on the system, 

indirect anthropogenic influence on the catchment cannot completely be ruled out from 1470 

to 1950 cal yr CE. An open deforested landscape dominated by shrubs prevailed in the Galician 

coast during the LIA (Muñoz-Sobrino et al., 2012). A large part of this deforestation was not 

only due to climate deterioration associated to the LIA, but also human-induced (Guitián 

Rivera, 2001; Kaal et al., 2011). A clear landscape would have facilitated increased rates of 

erosion and therefore, the entrance of nutrients in the Traba water body. The climatic signal of 

the more humid LIA could therefore be amplified in the sedimentary record by the effects of 

human intervention in the catchment, being difficult to disentangle the relative contributions 

of each sources of variability (Fig. 5.1). 

 

5.3.4 CULTURAL EUTROPHICATION 

Human-induced accelerated rates of nutrient inputs to aquatic ecosystems are considered one 

of the most significant drivers of ecological change (Smol, 2008). Multiproxy data indicate that 

increased runoff of fertilizers from agriculture constitutes a major control in the ecological 

status starting no later than 1950 cal yr CE in Melides and 1990 cal yr CE in Traba (Fig. 5.1). The 

problem of cultural eutrophication is related in Melides to intensive rice production, livestock 

farming activities, and discharges by two Wastewater Treatment Plants, being aggravated by 

inert extraction in the basin that increase solids in suspension (Freitas et al., 2009). All these 

factors contributed to its present hypertrophic condition. On the other hand, Traba also 

experienced dramatic changes in the immediate catchment that involved channelization of the 

small tributaries that feed the system, and transformation of the hygrophilous grasslands into 

pastures. Because these changes prompted large development of emergent macrophytes at 

the shores, there was a buffering effect that still maintains Traba in a mesotrophic condition. 

Thus, whereas in Melides a new turbid state has been clearly achieved, Traba seems to be still 

in a transitional phase towards turbid conditions. During very short-term episodes, both 

systems relax their trophic status when artificial barrier breaching occurs, but man-induced

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

108 
 

eutrophication seems to be the primary driver in the evolution of the lagoon for the last 

decades (Fig. 5.1). 

5.3.5 SEA-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS 

Current concerns regarding the potential eustatic sea-level rise associated to anthropogenic 

warming of the atmosphere and oceans, and its impacts on coastal resources have resulted in 

increased interest in former relative sea-level (RSL) fluctuations (IPCC, 2007). One of the main 

physical impacts of present-day accelerated RSL rise is the increased flooding of coastal 

wetlands, unless they have sufficient sediment supply (Nichols &amp;amp; Cazenave, 2010). It is 

therefore vital to have precise estimates of regional rates of sea-level rise and of 

sedimentation rates for the main coastal wetland areas. This knowledge allows ascertaining 

whether RSL changes constitute a significant factor in the evolution of these systems at 

different temporal time scales. 

Historical instrumental data provide a global sea-level rise (GSLR) rate of 1.8 mm yr
?1

 (IPCC, 

2007), but regional tidal gauges records are essential to understand the regional variability. 

Unfortunately, these tide gauges are limited in terms of temporal coverage and cannot provide 

GSLR rates for times before 20
th

 century. The rate of RSL rise estimated for the northern 

Iberian coast from tide gauge records yielded values of 1.49 to 2.51 ± 0.09 mmyr
?1

 for the 

period 1943-2001 (Tel &amp;amp; García, 2001; Marcos et al., 2005; Alonso &amp;amp; Pagés, 2010). To put these 

figures in context, they need to be compared with estimates extending back to the time when 

lagoons were originated. Rate of sea-level rise derived from salt marsh records of northern 

Spain yielded a value of 0.7 mm yr
?1

 for the period c. 6700 to 3000 cal yr BP (Leorri &amp;amp; Cearreta, 

2009a; Cearreta, 2010). This was followed by a deceleration of -0.2 mm yr
?1

, from 3000 cal yr 

BP until the 20
th

 century (Cearreta, 2010), and a new increase yielding a value of 1.9 mm yr
?1

 

for the 20
th

 century (Leorri &amp;amp; Cearreta, 2009b). This last figure is in very good agreement with 

instrumental data for the region, especially with estimates of 2.01 ± 0.85 mm yr
?1

 corrected for 

vertical land movements using GPS records (Marcos et al., 2007) (Fig. 5.1).  

For the southern Iberian Atlantic coast, local instrumental records in Cascais extending from 

1882 to 2010 (Ferreira et al., 2008; Antunes et al., 2010) allowed estimates of sea-level rise of 

0.5 mm yr
?1

 for the period 1882 to 1920 (Ferreira et al., 2008), 1.6 mm yr
?1

 for the period 1920 

to 2000 (Antunes &amp;amp; Taborda, 2009), and 2.9 mm yr
?1

 for 1990 to 2010 (Antunes et al., 2010). 

Most of the estimates of the rate of RSL rise based on sedimentary records focused on the sea-

level deceleration that occurred c. 5000 cal yr BP (e. g., Dias, 1987; Psuty &amp;amp; Moreira, 2000; 

Boski et al., 2002; Teixeira et al, 2005; Vis, 2009), with fewer data on the Late Holocene. Rough 

estimates for the Mediterranean during the period 7500 cal yr BP until present yielded values 

of 3 to 5 mm yr
?1

 (Boski et al., 2002; Teixeira et al, 2005), whereas for the period 2600 cal yr BP 

until present a value of 0.43 mm yr
?1

 was obtained (Psuty &amp;amp; Moreira, 2000) (Fig. 5.1). 

Accelerated rates of RSL rise for the northern and southern Iberian Atlantic coasts during the 

20
th

 century do not match with DI-salinity records of the two studied coastal wetlands. This is 

particularly evident for Traba, where a clear decrease in salinity took place during the whole 

20
th

 century. The only exception corresponds to the increase of the last decade, which with all 

certainty is related to the start of artificial breaching of the barrier. Comparison of the rate of

SLR for the northern Atlantic Iberian coast during the 20
th

 century (2.01 mm yr
?1

) with the 

estimated sedimentation rates for recent times in Traba (2.7 mm yr
?1

) shows that the system 

would qualify as a “surplus lagoon”, where sediment infill outpaces sea-level rise (Nichols, 

1989; Nichols &amp;amp; Boon, 1994). By contrast, recent sedimentation rate (2.2 mm yr
?1

) and recent 

RSL rise rate (2.9 mm yr
?1

) for the southern Iberian Atlantic coast do not keep pace in Melides 

making it to be classified as a “deficit lagoon” (Fig. 5.1). In spite of this, no significant trend 

towards more saline conditions throughout the 20
th

 century is found in this lagoon either, 

according to the DI-salinities, indicating that salt water intrusions associated to the accelerated 

RSL rise have not had still any significant effects on the water bodies. Whether this is indicating 

a high resilience of the system (Elliott et al., 2007) or not is open to question.

5.4 MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES  

Growing human pressures constitute a challenge for correct decision making in the World’s 

coastal areas (Moser et al., 2012). For the particular case of coastal wetlands, dramatic 

ecosystem changes have been observed, and actions undertaken to alleviate or even return 

these systems to their original conditions have failed many times (Newton et al., 2013). Much 

emphasis has been put on the effects of accelerated sea-level rise associated to Global 

Warming, but historical loss of coastal wetlands has been dominated by the direct human 

modification on these systems (Kirwan &amp;amp; Megonigal, 2013). In spite of this, the non-climate 

drivers in the evolution of coastal environments received much less attention than climate 

components, because they are considered a local issue (Nicholls et al., 2008; Nicholls &amp;amp; 

Cazenave 2010). The long-term evolution of Melides and Traba shows that local stressors 

played a much more significant role on recent environmental deterioration than global scale 

effects. 

For any good management practice in coastal wetlands it is necessary to distinguish when 

changes in the state of the ecosystem are caused by human pressure and not due to natural 

variability (Newton et al., 2013). Palaeoecological research developed in Melides and Traba 

has been decisive for this, demonstrating that both natural and human-induced causes 

intervened in major long-term environmental shifts that drove the two systems to different 

ecological states. 

The trophic status of Melides and Traba was largely dependent on natural causes linked to 

Rapid Climate Changes during the Holocene (Mayewski et al., 2004). Both systems experienced 

shifts from a turbid to a clear phase associated to changes from humid to dry periods (the 

onset of the MCA in Melides, and the termination of the LIA in Traba). Under these high runoff 

conditions, even at periods with higher connection to the sea, the systems did not increase the 

buffer capacity against nutrient enrichment, as should be expected (Roselli et al., 2013). But 

this natural control on the nutrient concentration status of the water bodies (modulated, at 

least in the case of Traba, by human-induced changes in forest cover of the catchment), has 

been replaced by the anthropogenic effects on nutrient levels in the last decades. Cultural 

eutrophication is one of the major stresses that these systems are facing, and one of the main 

management strategies should be to reduce nutrient loads and improve water quality. This is 

particularly important for Melides, where hypertrophic conditions are recorded. The use of 

biodegradable fertilizers since 2004, under the Integrated Protected System Management 

Policy (Freitas et al., 2009), brings some hope to foresee a reduction in nutrient levels in this 

lagoon in the mid-term. By contrast, no active decision making has been put into practice in 

Traba, where palaeoecological data suggest that it is facing a transition from a clear to a turbid 

phase probably only mitigated by very short-term episodes of episodic artificial breaching of 

the barrier and, more permanently, by the large development of emerged macrophytes at the 

shoreline. 

Artificial breaching is known to provoke high reductions in nutrient levels in Melides (Freitas et 

al., 2011) and Traba (Carballeira &amp;amp; Leira, in prep.). Although it would be tempting to intervene 

in the inlets to induce more frequent and/or intense connection to the sea, in dynamic coastal

ENVIRONMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALE 

2013 

 

111 
 

systems natural recovery is seen as the most appropriate and most likely mechanism to 

restore the ecosystem goods and services (Elliott et al., 2007). In the case of Traba, a strict 

application of the Nitrate Directive (EU, 1991) could have a significant impact on nutrient levels 

in the wetland. Environmental monitoring should be implemented to follow this and any other 

remediation plans, both here and in Melides, since there is a strong link among the different 

forcing factors driving their evolution. Susceptibility to eutrophication in coastal wetlands is 

not only a simple function of nutrient loadings, but also depends on sedimentary processes 

that are mainly controlled by a suite of sedimentological and geochemical variables (Moser et 

al., 2012). For instance, minimisation of sediment loads and vegetation clearance at the 

margins were suggested as palliative measures that would help functional life prolongation in 

Traba (Bao et al., 2007). Although this would benefit the extension of the dramatically reduced 

open waters, it would also limit the buffering effect of the marginal marsh against nutrient 

enrichment (Gasiorowski, 2008). On the other hand, under the Global Warming scenario, it is 

expected an increase of precipitation that would enhance the delivery of nutrients to coastal 

wetlands (Moser et al., 2012). This would make the alleviation of the effects of eutrophication 

even more challenging in systems like Melides and Traba, where increased precipitation 

regimes naturally contributed to keep them in turbid states in the past. To complicate things 

further, the direction of change of eutrophication in coastal wetlands can be site specific 

(Kirwan &amp;amp; Megonigal, 2013), so general rules on remediation should not be applied. 

The given examples of a very complex interplay among the different forcing factors driving the 

evolution of Melides and Traba shows that successful restoration in coastal environments is 

not only a matter of engineering, but requires good science and hypothesis testing (Elliott et 

al., 2007). Management policy in coastal wetlands must therefore recognize the multiple 

scales of impacting agents and responses (Day et al., 2008). To know this, palaeoecological 

research is therefore imperative, contributing to develop realistic and well informed 

management, conservation, and restoration strategies (Smol, 2008, Saunders et al., 2008).

5.1 SELF-CRITICISM AND FUTURE WORK 

This work has focused on two main approaches, the microscale, addressing the present-day 

data, and the mesoscale, based on the study of two cores retrieved from the Traba and 

Melides wetlands. Apart from the fact that every research work can be improved with more 

data or re-interpreted based on a deeper discussion, it is important to express and, if possible, 

to justify some aspects in which this work has been based, but also how these apprehensions 

can constitute future work. 

1. In what microscale approach is concerned, although two samples (spring-summer and 

autumn-winter conditions) of the diatom assemblages have been collected, only the 

last sample collected was studied due to time restrictions. Nevertheless, it 

corresponds to a first complete study on diatoms of such a number of Iberian 

transitional coastal environments. However, it remains unknown how the diatom 

community responds to seasonal changes, namely in coastal environments with large 

areas that exhibit heterogenic sediments and diverse water levels and quality 

according to river discharge and sea connection. Some coastal water bodies are 

relatively well studied (such as the lagoons of Albufeira, Melides and Santo André), but 

most part of the Iberian coastal transitional environments are not, enhancing the 

importance of an exhaustive diatom assemblages study with a complete evaluation of 

environmental variables. 

2. Moreover, few studies have been done relating diatoms with sedimentological and 

geochemical characteristics in the sediment, such as organic matter, stable isotopes 

and metals, from the water body itself but also from the adjacent fluvial areas, on a 

seasonal basis. Future studies in the WIAC should assess not only the role of salinity or 

nutrient gradients on the composition of diatom dead assemblages in present-day 

bottom sediments, but also of other environmental variables, such as tidal levels, 

sediment composition or depth. This would lead to more reliable palaeoenvironmental 

reconstructions in these systems were the complex interplay between continental and 

marine influences complicate the interpretation of the sedimentary record. 

3. The calibration data-set could be improved merging other available data-sets (e. g., 

Ribeiro, 2013; Resende et al., 2005, 2007) or new data. For the case of DI-salinity 

reconstructions, the data-sets should include a wider range of salt conditions and 

environments (i. e., the inclusion of deeper water bodies depicting pelagic habitats). 

4. If detailed knowledge could be achieved, quantitative inferred conditions could be 

more precise and a more reliable palaeoenvironmental reconstruction could be 

accomplished, specially focusing on the accuracy of these reconstructions, to provide 

information about optima and tolerances of diatom taxa in local and regional 

environments. Also, for a correct regional knowledge, efforts towards intercalibration 

of probes and methodologies between laboratories of different countries and regions 

must be imperative, with the prejudice of losing valid samples. Nonetheless, the 

samples and variables shown in this work represent the first characterization on the 

Iberian Atlantic façade.

5. It has become clear that to study past conditions in the coastal fringe, the choice 

should fall on a lake or lagoon with small dimensions. This choice leads to better 

samples toward a more reliable interpretation. However, the consequence of this 

choice would lead to an even greater lack of knowledge of coastal areas subject to 

multi- biotic and abiotic variables, which in the most part of the cases are the 

environments more subject to anthropic pressures. 

6. Although the available meteorological data was used for evolution interpretation of 

both Traba and Melides, it would be important to install or to re-activate 

meteorological stations nearby coastal areas, were precipitation and temperature data 

could be measured and further related with the ecological responses. 

7. It is important to expand these multi-proxy studies at high resolution level to other 

coastal environments, since in most part of the cases, they are centred in higher time-

spans (the Holocene or a time interval encompassing the Last Glacial Maximum and 

the Holocene), focusing mainly on the global factors and addressed at a low resolution 

level, with little or no information about the local factors forcing the last centuries, 

especially related with human impacts.  

8. Finally, it is essential to improve the chronology, since dates are crucial to frame 

palaeoenvironmental interpretations. 

The development of these approaches depends on research projects and all the related 

funding, not only at Universities, but also on entities and institutes with social, scientific 

and technological accountabilities toward a responsible and informed decision-making.
