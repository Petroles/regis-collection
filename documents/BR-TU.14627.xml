ABSTRACT

Heat transfer from skin surface to ambient water is probably the most important aspect of thermal
balance in marine mammals, but the respective calculations depend on knowing the surface temperature
(T

S
), the direct measurement of which in free animals is very difficult. An indirect iterative method

is proposed for T
S
 prediction in free cetaceans from deep body temperature, swimming speed, and

temperature and thermodynamic properties of the water.

Key words: cetaceans, thermoregulation, skin temperature, prediction.

RESUMO

Determinação da temperatura cutânea em cetáceos: uma abordagem iterativa

A transferência de energia térmica da superfície corporal para a água é provavelmente o aspecto mais
importante do equilíbrio térmico em mamíferos marinhos, mas os respectivos cálculos dependem do
conhecimento da temperatura da superfície, T

S
, cuja medição direta em animais em liberdade constitui

um problema difícil de resolver. Um método iterativo é proposto para a predição de T
S
 de cetáceos

em liberdade, a partir da temperatura corporal profunda, da velocidade de deslocamento e da tem-
peratura e propriedades termodinâmicas da água.

Palavras-chave: cetáceos, termorregulação, temperatura cutânea, predição.

INTRODUCTION

Cetaceans are the only homeotherms that spend
their entire life in the open sea, subject to water
temperatures ranging from –2oC to about 30oC.
Thermal difficulties imposed by such a variable
environment stem mostly from the high thermal
conductivity of water, which results in rapid heat
flow away from the body surface. Consequently,
it is widely assumed that skin temperature of these
bare-skinned animals is nearly the same as that of
water (Irving &amp;amp; Hart, 1957).

In general, endothermic animals minimize heat
loss in cold environments by reducing skin tem-
perature in order to maintain the least possible
temperature differential. This reduction is achieved

by low conduction of heat from the inner body
tissues to the cutaneous surface. In cetaceans the
main thermal barrier is a blubber layer covering most
of the body. For example, a porpoise with 2 cm of
blubber can sustain a deep body temperature 39oC
higher than that of the ambient water.

While fur seals may present skin temperatures
more than 20oC above that of ambient water (Boyd,
2000), bare-skinned dolphins have surface tem-
peratures usually within 1oC of the water even after
exercise in warm waters (Noren et al., 1999). Diffe-
rent models have been used to estimate heat ex-
change in marine mammals (Innes, 1986; Kshatriya
&amp;amp; Blake, 1988; Ryg et al., 1988; Hokkanen, 1990;
Watts et al., 1993), but the results vary widely, which
is probably explained by the practical difficulties

entailed in measuring body surface temperature of
these animals.

This paper presents an iterative method of
predicting the skin temperature of cetaceans using
deep body temperature, swimming speed, and the
temperature and thermodynamic properties of the
water.

The model
In the simplest terms, the body of a cetacean

may be thermally considered as a cylinder of length
L with a uniformly warm core surrounded by an
insulating blubber layer (Scholander et al., 1950; Watts
et al., 1993), whose thickness is assumed to be uniform
throughout the body. The inner body temperature is
within the usual mammalian range of 35o to 38oC
(Kanwischer &amp;amp; Leivestad, 1957; Morrison, 1962;
Kanwischer &amp;amp; Sundnes, 1966) and one can assume
an average 37oC value without significant error. A
cylindrical model, illustrated in Fig. 1, has also been
supposed by other authors (Ryg et al., 1988; Lavigne
et al., 1990; Watts et al., 1993).

Thermal balance is reached when heat input
equates with heat loss. The thermal balance equation
in cetaceans is very simple compared to that of
terrestrial mammals. The only heat input results from
metabolism (M ), while heat is lost by conduction
(K) from the inner body to the skin, from which heat
passes by convection (C) to ambient water:

KCM += (1)

Latent heat loss by evaporation in the
respiratory tract, as observed in most mammals, is

another way to transfer thermal energy, but cetaceans
spend much time under water, emerging at intervals
for respiration. Thus, heat loss by respiratory
evaporation is low, i.e., less than 6% of total body
heat loss (Kanwischer &amp;amp; Sundnes, 1966; Folkow &amp;amp;
Blix, 1992). On the other hand, fins and flippers are
regarded as efficient cooling surfaces because they
have little or no insulation and a rich blood supply
(Tomilin, 1951). It must be pointed out that excessive
heat loss from flippers and fluke is avoided by a
counter-current mechanism, which is characterized
by a special blood vessel arrangement so that that
the larger arteries are completely surrounded by veins
(Schmidt-Nielsen, 1990). This prevents heat from
reaching the surface of the appendages. The same
mechanism, also found in the legs of seagulls and
other birds that swim in cold waters (Steen &amp;amp; Steen,
1965), transfers heat mainly by conduction from the
core to the skin surface through the blubber. The
corresponding flux in the steady state is given by:

at a rate:

When considering the hydrodynamic and ther-
modynamic aspects of convection, knowledge of
surface temperature, T

S
, for determination of the heat

transfer coefficient, h, is generally assumed. However,
in real problems involving cetaceans neither T

S
 nor

h are known, and it becomes necessary to calculate
conduction and convection simultaneously. At the
skin surface the convection coefficient h depends on
the unknown surface temperature and, in turn, this
temperature depends on the heat transfer coefficient.
The dependence of h on T

S
 involves the difference

between this temperature and that of the environment.
Hence, it is not possible to calculate tem-

perature directly, and an iterative procedure must
be considered. The problem of heat transfer by
combined conduction and convection from insulated
pipes, comprehensive treatments of which are found
in many textbooks, is well known in engineering
(e.g., Chapman, 1987). Another problem is the
thermal conductivity of blubber. This value and that
of blubber thickness are the parameters that deter-
mine insulating capacity, or thermal resistance of
the blubber layer. Worthy &amp;amp; Edwards (1990)
suggested the value k

B
 = 0.1 W.m–1.oC–1 for harbor

porpoises, while for whales the usual value is k
B

= 0.2 W.m–1.oC–1 (Innes, 1986; Ryg et al., 1988;
Lavigne et al., 1990; Watts et al., 1993). A laboratory
experiment by Kvadsheim et al. (1996) showed an
average value of 0.25 W.m–1.oC–1 for minke whales.

Noren et al. (1999) measured experimentally
the heat flow at the skin surface of bottlenose dolphins,
Tursiops truncatus, resting in warm (28.5o to 31oC)
water. They obtained a flow of 50 W.m–2 in the trunk.
A consistent result reached by these authors showed
that the surface temperature T

S
 remained within 1oC

of the water. By using their data and considering the
body measurements of the animals observed, we can
apply equation (2) to estimate the value of the blubber
thermal conductivity as follows:

This value is very close to that of Worthy &amp;amp;

Iterative procedure
In order to estimate adequate values for heat

flow from the body of a cetacean to its environment
an iterative procedure is proposed here, as follows:

1. A trial value of T
S
 is assumed. For exam-

ple, in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops
truncatus) the skin temperature remains
about 1oC above that of the water tem-
perature, T

W
.

2. The mean temperature T
m 

= (T
S
 + T

W
)/2 is

calculated. The following thermal
properties of the seawater at this
temperature are obtained: specific heat (c

p
),

density (?), kinematic viscosity (?), and
conductivity (k). These properties can be
found in Table 1 for temperatures between
–2o to 35oC (271.15 to 308.15 K).

3. The following numbers are calculated: the
Reynolds, R

e 
= Vd?–1 and the Prandtl, P

r 
=

?c
p
?k–1, where V is the swimming speed

(m.s–1) and d is the characteristic dimension
of the body, which in this case is the length
(m). The forced convection is considered
when the animal is moving through water,
otherwise free convection is used, in which
case the Grashof number is needed:

 = 9.8 d 3 ?–2T –1

w
(T

where d is the body diameter (m) and all
temperatures are in K degrees.

( )

= WBS (10)

The result is compared with the initial assump-
tion for T

S
, a revised value of T

S
 is chosen, and all

calculations are repeated. The process continues
until the results converge and a satisfactory
agreement between two successive T

S 
values is

achieved. The extent to which the iterative process
is carried out depends on desired accuracy. In
general, less than 10 iterations may be needed until
adequate convergence is reached.

The difference ?T between the skin temperature
estimated by equation 10 and that of the water linearly
decrease with water temperature, as shown in Fig.
2. For example, at T

W 
= 0oC the skin temperature is

7.8oC while it is 31.3oC for T
W 

= 30oC. Experimental
data recorded by Noren et al. (1999) showed that
?T remained at around 1oC for T

W
 values between

28o and 31oC with a linear association. It is noteworthy
that these results are in accordance with the values
predicted by equation 10, despite the lack of expe-
rimental evidence for cold-water conditions.

The estimated body surface temperature can
be used to determine heat loss by convection and
conduction as follows:

1. T
m 

= (T
S
 + T

W
)/2 is calculated. The thermo-

physical properties of water at that tem-
perature are obtained (Table 1).

2. The Nusselt number, N
u
, is

 
calculated.

3. The rate of convective loss, C = kL–1N
u
 (T

S 
–

T
W

), W.m–2 is calculated.

If the heat lost by respiration is negligible and
a thermal equilibrium steady state can be assumed,
then the rate of heat loss by convection calculated
as above is also an estimate of the rate of metabolic
heat production (M).

Example
Suppose a dolphin, 2.5 m in length and 0.37

m in maximum body diameter, is swimming at a 10
knot speed (5.1 m.s–1) in 18oC water. The blubber
has an average thickness of 1.23 cm and deep body
temperature is 37oC.

Solution
Assuming an initial value T

S 
= 20oC, the ave-

rage temperature is T
m 

= (20 + 18)/2 = 19oC. In Table
1, the thermophysical properties of the water are
found for this temperature: ? = 1024.8 kg.m–3, c

p
 =

3.99314 J.kg–1.oC–1, k = 0.5980 W.m–1.oC–1, and ? =
1.07431 x 10–3 m2.s–1.

After four iterations the results converged to
the value T

S
 = 21.647oC, for which the coefficient of

convection h = 33.841 W.m–2.oC–1 was calculated and
used to compute the heat loss by convection:

C = h (T
S
 – T

W
) = 33.841 (21.647 – 18) = 123.42 W.m–2

 Thus, in order to sustain thermal balance in
the given environmental conditions the animal must
have a metabolic rate of the same level as that of
the heat loss (C).

The above-described procedure would be
useful in behavioral studies, when the handling of
the animals and even excessively close watching
must be avoided. Using a C++ program allows the
carrying out of all needed calculations. This program
is available on request from the author.
