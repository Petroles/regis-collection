Abstract

In many cases in large urban centers, which have appropriate waterbodies, small-scale fisheries are the only source 
of cheap protein for the poor. In Lago Paranoá, located in Brasília, the capital city of Brazil, fishing was studied by 
conducting interviews with 53 fishers filling in logbooks from March, 1??? to March, 2000 in three fishing communi-
ties. The fishers come from the poorest towns around Brasília, known as satellite-towns. They have been living there 
on average for 21.7 years (s = ?.6 years), their families have 4.? members (s = 3.6) on average and 44.2% do not have 
a basic education. However, such characteristics are similar to the socioeconomic indices of the metropolis where 
they live. In spite of being illegal between 1?66 and 2000, fishing generated an average monthly income of U$ 23?.00 
(s = U$ 171.77). The Nile Tilapia Oreocrhromis niloticus is the main captured species (85% of a total number of land-
ings in weight of 62.5 t.). Fishing is carried out in rowing boats, individually or in pairs. The fishing equipment used 
are gillnets and castnets. Gillnets were used actively, whereby the surface of the water is beaten with a stick to drive 
Tilapias towards nets as they have the ability to swim backwards. This fishing strategy was used in 64.7% of the fisher-
ies, followed by castnets (31.1%) and by gillnets which were used less (4.2%). The fish is sold directly in the streets 
and fairs of the satellite-towns to middlemen or to bar owners. Three communities have different strategies in terms of 
fishing equipments, fishing spots and commercialization. Consequently, there are statistically significant differences in 
relation to the monthly income for each one of these communities.

A pesca de pequena escala no Lago Paranoá Brasília, DF, Brazil

Resumo

Em muitos centros urbanos, com corpos d´água apropriados, as pescarias de pequena escala são a única fonte de 
proteína barata para os pobres. No Lago Paranoá, localizado em Brasília, a atividade pesqueira foi estudada através 
de entrevistas com 53 pescadores que vivem em cidades satélites, de Março/1??? a Março/2000, em três comunida-
des pesqueiras. Nesse período os pescadores viviam nas cidades satélites em média há 21,7 anos (s = ?,6 anos), com 
famílias de 4,? membros (s = 3,6) e 44,2% deles não possuíam instrução mínima. Entretanto, suas condições são se-
melhantes aquelas apontadas pelos indicadores socioeconômicos das áreas onde residem. A pesca, embora clandestina 
de 1?66 a 2000, gerou um rendimento médio de U$ 23?,00 (s = U$ 171,77). A tilápia do Nilo Oreochromis niloticus 
foi a principal espécie capturada (85% de um rendimento total em peso de 62,5 t). As pescarias foram realizadas em 
canoas a remo, individualmente ou em duplas. As artes empregadas foram a malhadeira e a tarrafa. A malhadeira foi 
empregada de modo ativo sob a forma de batida, onde se bate na água com um bastão para afugentar as tilápias em 
direção às redes. Essa estratégia foi empregada em 64,7% das pescarias, seguida pela tarrafa (31,1%) e pela malha-
deira empregada passivamente (4,2%). O pescado foi vendido diretamente nas ruas e em feiras das cidades-satélite, 
por atravessadores ou donos de bar. As três comunidades de pescadores apresentam estratégias diferentes para pescar 
e comercializar o pescado. Assim há diferenças significativas em relação à essa fonte de renda, entre as comunidades.

1. Introduction

In 2000, the total amount of fish landing in the world 
was close to ?5 million tons, of which 8.8 million (?%) 
were fresh water fish (FAO, 2003). In 2000, in Brazil it 
a total production of 847 thousand tons was estimated 
(FAO, 2003).

Small-scale fisheries are the main suppliers of good 
quality protein for local populations. Fishers use a wide 
variety of equipment and most of the boats are not mo-
torized. The fishers go fishing on their own, in pairs or 
in small groups from four to six individuals and they are 
under economical pressure which makes them select 
fish of a larger value. Their relationship with the market 
is characterized by the middlemen’s presence (Bayley 
and Petrere, 1?8?; Petrere, 1?8?; Fischer et al., 1??2; 
Diegues, 1??5). Diegues (1??5) estimated that 550.000 
small-scale fishers in Brazil are responsible for a high 
proportion of quality fish which is sold on the domestic 
and external market. 

In many Brazilian urban-reservoirs, small-scale fish-
ery is the only source for the poor population. In many 
great cities, there are appropriate water structures, such 
as in the Represa Billings (127 km2) in the capital city 
of São Paulo, in Lagoa Pampulha (0.3 km2) in the capi-
tal of Belo Horizonte and in Lago Paranoá (38 km2) in 
Brasília, the capital of Brazil (Petrere, 1??5). Minte-Vera 
and Petrere (2000) estimated there were 101 fishers in the 
Represa Billings and a production of 63 kg.ha.-1.year-1, 
where 81.4% of the total landings in weight (147.6 tons) 
is represented by the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.

 In Lagoa Pampulha in Belo Horizonte, there are ap-
proximately 1,600 fishers and for 83.3% fish is a basic 
food. It is considered that many of the fish which are 
caught are tilapia Oreocrohomis sp. (82.4% of ?44 fish), 

followed by traíra Hoplias cf. lacerdae (4.?%) and 
matrinchã Brycon lundii (3.?%), (Godinho et al., 1??2).

 Lago Paranoá dam was built in 1?5?, one year before 
the new capital city of Brazil was inaugurated (Figure 1). 
At that time, the purpose of building the reservoir was to 
increase the relative humidity of the air to produce elec-
tric power, to serve as a recreation area, a place to keep 
fish, landscape, a place for sewer effluents and rainwater 
(França et al., 1?64). The lake has an area of 3,800 ha 
and is in the urban district of Brasília and there were 
two million inhabitants in 2000 (CODEPLAN, 2000). 
During the 60’s and 70’s, Lago Paranoá went through 
a eutrophication process due to the inefficiency in col-
lecting and treating sewers in the two treatment stations 
(North and South) located on their banks (Palmer, 1?6?; 
Oliveira and Krau, 1?70; Branco, 1?76). However, from 
1??3 onwards the new treatment stations started to oper-
ate, both using a sewer treatment system removing nu-
trients in order to enable the ecosystem of the lake to 
recompose. After three years, the lake showed obvious 
signs of recovery (Fernandes and Pinto, 1??8). 

After constructing the reservoir, various species of 
fish were introduced for recreational purposes and as a 
place for posterior fish farming around Brasília. Small-
scale fishing, which had not been contemplated, started 
spontaneously. In 1??8, after doing a very well-designed 
hydro-acoustic experiment, the lake fish total biomass 
was estimated at 1,400 toneladas (Lebourges-Dhaussy 
et al., 1??8), mainly consisting of acará Geophagus 
brasiliensis, bagre (catfish) Rhamdia quelen, cascudo 
(armoured fish) Hypostomus sp., jeju Erytinus erytinus, 
lambari Astyanax sp, mussum Synbranchus marmoratus, 
planaltina Planaltina meyersi, saúba or sagüiru 
Steindachnerina isnculpta, tamoatá Hoplosternum

 lacerdae, all native species of the Paranoá basin (Lazzaro 
et al., 1??8). The introduced species were bluegill 
Lepomis macrochira, common carp Cyprinus carpio, 
silver carp Hypophthlmicthyes molitrix, Congo tilapia 
Tilapia rendalli, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and 
tucunaré (oscar) Cichla sp. (Lazzaro et al., 1??8). T h i s 
biomass estimation is equivalent to a production higher 
than 300 kg.ha-1. This result places Lago Paranoá among 
the most productive ecosystems when compared to 
temperate and subtropical lakes (Brabrand et al., 1??0; 
Bachmann et al., 1??6). 

Although small-scale fishing started when the dam 
was built, commercial fishing with castnets and gillnets 
was prohibited between 1?66 and 1??? and was only 
made legal when the Lebourges-Dhaussy et al. (1??8) 
experiment was being conducted. Even though it was 
illegal, in 1?85 there were at least 100 families living 
exclusively from fishing at Lago Paranoá. According to 
information given by older fishers, the annual fish pro-
duction at that time was estimated around 200 annual 
tons (48.1 kg.ha-1.year-1).  The landings were almost all 
tilapias, carps but rarely, catfish and tucunarés. The fish 
was totally consumed in the satellite-towns in great 
demand. As always, all fish was sold by middlemen 
(Dornelles and Dias Neto, 1?85). However, from 1??1, 
an increase in the efficiency of inspections, as well as a 
Police Station which was built opposite the best fishing 
spot of the lake caused a decline in professional fishing. 
On the other hand, the stock assessment of Lago Paranoá 
detected a large tilapia biomass leading to an increased 
concentration of phosphorous making the water quality 
worse, because they stirred the bottom, releasing depos-
ited and inactive phospohorous (Marmori, 1??5; Starling 
and Lazzaro, 1??7 and; Starling, 1??8). This led to some 
environmental agencies making professional fishing le-
gal on the lake in order to reduce the population of tila-
pias.

The main objective of this paper is to describe the 
socioeconomic importance of professional small-scale 
fishing at Lago Paranoá as a supplier of income and pro-
tein for the poor population of the Federal District (DF) 
in order to subsidize its permanent legalisation. 

2. Materials and Methods

The socioeconomic description was made by con-
ducting interviews with professional fishers, whose 
questionnaires were closed and modified from Valêncio 
(1??5). Sampling was at random, as described by 
IBAMA/DNOCS/GTZ (1??2), where an available fisher 
interviewee recommended others and so on. This pro-
cedure was also adopted because we did not know the 
number of existing professional fishers at Lago Paranoá 
beforehand. Data collection was carried out between 
24/01/?? and 25/03/?? in four areas of interviews: 
Acampamento da Telebrasília (28 fishers), Vila Paranoá 
(12 fishers), at Estação de Tratamentos de Esgotos Sul 
– ETE Sul (? fishers) and at Estação de Tratamentos de 
Esgotos Norte ETE Norte (4 fishers). After the inter-

views, catching and data was done in three of the de-
scribed communities, except in ETE Norte. Landings 
were monitored from March/1??? to March/ 2000, mak-
ing a total of 1,4?8 fishing trips. 

The sampling unit is for each fishing trip, once in 
Lago Paranoá, apart from 32 trips in which one piece 
of fishing equipment was used. The catch was defined 
by the total amount in weight (kg) of round fish. As a 
scale was not always available to weigh the fish, two 
alternatives were adopted. The first one consisted of 
counting the number of 18-liter cans with fish in as some 
fishers sell their products in these containers. Later, we 
weighed a few cans at random containing tilapias or carp 
separately and calculated their average weight for future 
conversion. The second alternative was to quantify a 
fisher’s estimated catch in weight according to Petrere 
(1?78) who points out that a fisher often knows the pre-
cise weight of the catch and the correction can be made 
making use of a simple linear regression. The X vari-
able, which is always available, is the estimated catch 
by a given fisher in weight and the Y variable is the real, 
corresponding weighed catch by a scale, in a random 
experiment. Finally, some fishers weighed the fish after 
evisceration. For correction of those values, we calcu-
lated a linear regression between the rounded up weight 
(in kg) Y and the corresponding weight (in kg) of the 
eviscerated fish X for each species.

After the convenient data transformation, a simple 
linear regression was done in order to explore the re-
lationship between catch and effort. A socioeconomic 
analysis was carried out making use of descriptive sta-
tistics. The average monthly income was calculated from 
the catch information and from the commercialization 
price from each fisher. A comparison among incomes 
was made by an ANOVA and a further Scheffé test of 
multiple comparison a posteriori. During the interviews, 
US$ 1 = R$ 1.80. 

3. Results

3.1. The professional fishers

3.1.1. Their origin and settlement time 

The site with a larger concentration of interviewed 
fishers was Vila da Telebrasília (28 fishers), followed by 
Vila Paranoá (12), Buraco (?) and ETE Norte (4). Vila 
Telebrasília and Vila Paranoá are places where people 
live. The other two are landing places (Figure 2). From 
the interviews, we estimated that there were 55 active 
fishers in Lago Paranoá, showing that we nearly reached 
the whole population using our non-random sampling 
procedure. 

The fishers have lived in the Federal District 
or in the satellite-towns for 21.7 years, on average 
(s = ?.6 years, n = 53), where 4?% have lived there for 
more than 21 years. We judge that this average is quite 
high as Brasília was founded in 1?60 in an original no-
man’s land. From these, 11.5% were born in the Federal

District. From the remaining, the most representative 
area is the Northeast (64.1%), followed by the Center-
West (32.1%) and the Southeast (3.8%). 

3.1.2. Home conditions, basic sanitation  
and electric energy 

Most of the fishers own their own houses (41 fish-
ers), followed by those who pay rent (5), those who live 
with relatives (3), those who live in invaded areas (3) and 
one who is a caretaker. The average size of the houses is 
of 76.2 m2 (s = 5?.5? m2. n = 52). The smallest house has 
2 m2 and the largest, 360 m2. 

The average size of the families is 4.? people (n = 53, 
s = 3.62) varying from 1 to twelve members. 

The houses have masonry walls (32 houses) or wood 
(21). The material of the roofs is usually made of fibroce-
ment (48 houses) or tiles (3). There are 2 fishers who 
live in canvas huts. The floors are made of rough cement 
or burned “vermelhão” (40 houses), followed by tile or 
ceramic floors (?) and soil (4). 

In 50 houses, the source of energy comes from the 
public electric power system, 2 from kerosene lanterns 
or candles and 1 from the community’s generator. The 
fuel used for cooking is from gas jars (51) and firewood 
(2). In 46 houses, the water comes from the public sup-
ply.

In 50 houses there are sanitary facilities. From these, 
32 are connected to the public sewage system, 11 have 
raw sewage, 7 have a septic tank and 1 throws the sewage 
into a ditch. 

In 44 houses, there is public garbage collection, in ? 
the garbage is burnt, in 3 it is buried, in 2 it is taken to 
wastelands and in 1 it is disposed of in water. 

3.1.3. Sex and age of the fishers

While being interviewed, there was only one fish-
erwoman, although as mentioned previously, there is a 
larger amount of fisherwomen. The youngest fisher was 
17 years old and the oldest 67 (n = 52). On average, the 
interviewees’ age was of 40.7 years (s = 12.8). 50% of 

the interviewees’ were between 17 and 40 years old. 
There were two classes of fishers, an older one (between 
41 and 67 years) and a younger one, made up mainly of 
their children, who are married and who are also fishers. 

3.1.4. Education 

From the 52 Lago Paranoá fishers, 52% never at-
tended school or went for less than four years, 21.1% 
were illiterate, 5.8% knew “ how to read and write”, but 
never went to school, 1.?% were at adult primary school 
and 23.1% did not finish school (Table 1).

3.1.5. Importance of fish in the diet 

The fish caught in the lake is an important basic food 
as it is consumed by 61.2% of the families more than 
three times a week, on average (Table 2). 

3.2. The fisheries

3.2.1. Dedication to fishing 

Dedication to fishing is important in order to evalu-
ate if the activity is sufficient for the fisher and his family 
to survive. Another important factor is the time between 
harvesting periods, when the fisher leaves the activity to 
do something else or changes fishing strategies in order 
to catch other fish species. 

Throughout the interviews, three groups of fishers 
could be observed (Table 3). In the first one, fishing is 
their main activity and they may or may not have a sec-
ond source of income (3?.6%, n = 53). The second group 
stops fishing due to inspection checks and only returns 
when there are no more (32.1%). The third group is par-
tially active (28.3%), stopping when another job oppor-
tunity arises or when the fishing equipament is taken by 
the police. Among the active fishers, 47.6% (n = 21) only 
live off fishing. 

Among the unstable fishers, when they were being 
interviewed, 40.0% (n = 15) did not have another source 
of income and 46.7% were autonomous. Among those 
fishers that stopped fishing, 17.6% (n = 17) were unem-
ployed. 

Throughout 1???, 18.?% (n = 53) of the fishers only 
lived off fishing, which is a low number when compared 
to 1??5, where 73.?% of the interviewees (n = 46) only 
lived off fishing (Walter, 2000). 

The remaining fishers have the fishery as a main 
source of income. From the 3?.6% (n = 53) who are au-
tonomous, all of them have few professional qualifica-
tions. However, all the fishers affirmed that they fish all 
year round, except for two that only fish at the end of 
the dry period and one that only fishes when he is un-
employed. 

3.2.2. The fishing boats and its crew 

In the Lago Paranoá, professional fishing is done in 
paddle wooden canoes with one or two crew members. 
Only 7.5% (n = 53) said they fished alone. The crews 
are made up of friends (50.?%), relatives (32.1%) and 
employees (?.4%, n = 51). In relation to the fisheries,

tion. In this case, both are fishers, unlike when there is 
payment for the activity, where the crew consists of a 
fisher and an assistant. There are some cases where the 
fishing assistant is a member of the family as a son. In 
these cases, there is no remuneration, as the income is in 
the same family. 

The canoes are usually made by their owners at an 
average cost of U$ 38.60 (n = 48, s = 15.05). 

3.2.3. The fish species 

According to Gulland (1?76), in some fisheries, the 
crew uses a combination of various techniques to catch 
a target species. In some cases, together with this spe-
cies there is a catch, which is either discarded or sold 
at a low price. In Lago Paranoá, the target species are 
the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and the saúba or 
sagüirú Steindachnerina insculpta. The other non-target 
species are associated to catching these two, but some 
are economically important, such as the traíra Hoplias 
malabaricus or they may often appear, such as the com-
mon carp Cyprinus carpio, so they cannot be considered 
as a catch because they are not discarded. With the ex-
ception of the common carp, these species have a better 
price on the market.

The carp is the non-target species which ap-
pears in more trips (48.8%) followed by Congo tilapia 
(1?.3%). traíra (15.4%) and tucunaré (10.4%, n = 1.4?8). 
According to the fishers, carp and congo tilapia are sold 
to the middlemen mixed with Nile tilapia. When sold in 
retail, common carp is not well accepted and the tilapias 
are sold mixed. Traíra and tucunaré are either consumed 
or sold for higher prices than the tilapias. Species such 
as the silver carp, tambaqui, piapara and African catfish 
are considered special as they are the most expensive on 
the market. 

The three more frequent species in the fisheries are 
invaders: Nile tilapia (appeared ?6.7%), common carp 
(48.8%) and Congo tilapia (1?.3%). 

3.2.4. Random sampling experiments

Table 4 shows the average weight and other statis-
tics of interest from random samples of Nile tilapia and 
common carp, contained in 18-litre cans. These averages 
were further used to express the total number of catches 
in weight.

When analyzing the Y (Weighed catch)* X (Fisher’s 
estimated catch), it was observed that although the rela-
tionship was fairly linear, the variance was not constant

?5.6% fish in pairs (n = 14?5) and 4.4% with a single

same. In fact with few exceptions, the partnership is 
highly unstable. According to their information, this fact 
is a consequence of many conflicts when fishing, as well 
as due to the instability of fishing, where many fishers 
shift to other jobs. Those fishers that have employees pay 
them with a percentage of fish or in money and those that 
fish in partnerships have the catch at the same propor-

as it increased with estimated weights presenting a cor-
net effect. We log transformed the data and the regres-
sion presented no tendentious residues, however with out 
normal distribution, with three outlier. However, remov-
ing these three values, the residues remained non ten-
dentious and normal (g1 = -0.186 and g2 = 0.027). The 
final equation was: y = 1.2 x 0.?21 (n = 168; r = 0.?86; 
p&amp;lt;0.001).

Table 5 shows the linear relationships between the 
fresh round fish (Y) and fresh eviscerated fish for 5 fish 
species. Note the high correlation coefficients in all 
 cases.

3.2.5. Fishing equipment and fishing strategies 

According to Minte-Vera and Petrere (2000), some 
fishing strategies may consist of a combination of differ-
ent equipment with appropriate mesh and type of habitat. 
Due to these combinations, a fisher tries to increase his/
her chance of catching the target species. Therefore, in 
Lago Paranoá two types of equipment are used in profes-
sional fishing: castnets and gillnets. A gillnet can be used 
in two ways: actively or passively. When used actively, 
the following local technique called batida (beat) is used: 
the fishers beat the water surface with a stick driving the 
tilapias towards the net as they have the ability to swim 
backwards. The purpose of Batida is to mainly catch Nile 
tilapia. Therefore, 35.8% of the fishers fish exclusively 
with castnets (n = 51) and 22.6% fish exclusively with 
gillnets. The others (41.6%) fish with both. However, the 
fishers from Vila da Telebrasília only used castnets, except 
for three, who also used gillnets. On the other hand, the 
Vila Paranoá fishers only fish with batida and the Buraco 
fish fishers with castnets and gillnets, except for two, one 
who only uses castnets and another only gillnets. The four 
fishers interviewed in ETE Norte only fish with castnets. 

In the Lago Paranoá, the gillnets used in batida have 
from one to three sets of nets tied together with the same 
or different mesh sizes. The average total length of the 
whole set is 142.2 m, average mesh size of ?.4 cm be-
tween opposite knots and an average height of 2.0 m.

The castnets are also used in catching saúba and Nile 
tilapia (31.1% of the fisheries). Saúba fishing is done in 
the outlet of the streams mainly for subsistence. Because 
of this, the castnets (tarrafas) are smaller (tarrafinha), 
with an average mesh size of 2.7 cm between opposite 
knots and an average height of 1.8 meters. 

Castnets used in tilapia fishing are the only ones 
which were made legal by the Brazilian Institute of the 

Environment and the Renewable Natural Resources 
(IBAMA) in December, 1???. These castnets have an av-
erage mesh size of 7.14 cm between opposite knots, an 
average height of 2.8 m and a diameter of 21.8 m. 

The nets are usually bought at U$ 1.03/mr (n = 28, 
s = 0.3?) and the castnets and tarrafinhas can be made or 
bought costing U$ 48.57 on average (n = 35, s = 15.72). 

3.2.6. The landings

The total amount of fish caught at the Lago Paranoá 
from March, 1??? to March, 2000 was 62.50 tons in 
1,4?8 trips (41.7 kg/trip; s = 26.43, minimum = 0.00, 
maximum=170). The most captured species was the 
Nile tilapia (84.?%), followed by the common carp, 
11.1%, Congo tilapia 2.2%, traíra 1.0% and 0.8% of the 
other species (Table 6). The total catch varied month-
ly (Figure 3). On average, 21.4 fishers were active per 
month (s = 12.37) in 115 fisheries (s = 41.56). The aver-
age yield was of 224.7 kg/fisher/month. 

The saúba were not sorted out, except in those cases 
where the fishers differentiated all the species. Therefore, 
it does not correspond to catching saguirú exactly.

Considering the total area of the lake is 3,800 hec-
tares, the fishing productivity of the reservoir is 
16.4 kg.ha-1.year-1. 

The weight of the landing proportions in 1,4?8 
fishing trips was: Vila Paranoá (4?.4% of a total of 
62,500 kg), followed by Buraco (38.4%) and Vila da 
Telebrasília (10.?%). 

3.3. Fish commercialization 

Most of the time, fish is directly sold to the consumers 
(84.?%, n = 53) in fairs (6?.8%, n = 53) or in the streets 
(4?.1%, n = 53) of the satellite-towns and municipal 
districts of the State of Goiás. Selling it at fairs usually 
happens at the weekends, mainly on Sundays. On other 
days of the week, the fishers sell the fish in the streets. 
Fish is also sold to middlemen (37.7%). The fish sold to 
middlemen or to consumers may take place by the lake 
(7.5%) or in houses (35.8%). There are two cases where 
fishers supply bars with fish. However, throughout the 
research it was observed that the fish buyers or the bars 
always resell the fish directly to the consumers and many 
bar owners buy the fish from middlemen for more acces-
sible prices. Therefore, between the fisher and consumer, 
there are at least two more people. 

The price and the way to sell fish vary according to 
the buyer´s type and the fish species. The tilapias and

carps can be sold in cans, in fish strings (6 fish/string 
hung by the gill) and by kilo. Price varies according to 
fish numbers or size. On average, the average price of 
the tilapia sold directly to the consumer was U$ 1.23/kg 
(n = 24, s = 0.37) and U$ 1.52/string (n = 20, s = 0.45). 

Carp is sold in a similar way. Its final average cost was 
U$ 2.06/string (n = 12, s = 2.06) or U$ 1.24/kilo (n = 21, 
s = 0.37). The traíra and the tucunaré are sold by the kilo 
to the consumer for an average price of U$ 1.74 (n = 23, 
s = 0.3?) and U$1.?? (n = 12, s = 0.45), respectively. On 
average, the saúba costs U$ 1.?4/kilo (n = 20, s = 0.67). 
The fish is sold to the middlemen in cans or by kilogram.

The weight of a can is approximately 14 kg. On average, a 
tilapia can costs U$ 7.58 (n = 11, s = 2.0?) and carp costs 
U$ 7.?3 (n = 7, s = 2.02). Many fishers said they sold 
mixed fish to middlemen and the value of a can increased 
according to the number of traíras and tucunarés it con-
tained. When sold to the middlemen in kilogram, the price 
of the fish varied between U$ 0.28 and U$ 1.11. 

Some fishers removed traíra and tucunaré for their 
own consumption or it was given to relatives or neigh-
bours. Only four fishers reported selling traíra to middle-
men for U$ 1.18/kg (s = 0.7?). 

3.4. Differences presented by the fishing communities in 
relation to fishing strategies and marketing 

Throughout the work, it was observed that the com-
munities had different strategies regarding the equipment 
used, the area of the lake used for fishing, the period of 
day when fishing took place and the kind of commer-
cialization areas. 

For instance, the community of Buraco only fishes at 
the southern end of the lake. When this was illegal, they 
used batida at night. After it was made legal in February, 
2000 they started fishing with castnets in the daytime and 
at night (Table 7).

The Paranoá community used all the areas of the lake 
to fish, mainly the central area. Their strategies consisted 
of fishing at night, only with batida. 

The Vila da Telebrasília community fishes mainly 
with castnets and some fishers also use gillnets and bat-

ida. The fishing area is mainly at the southern end of the 
lake and people fish mainly during the day. 

Regarding commercialization, it was also observed 
that places and different ways of selling are used by 
each one of the communities. For instance, when Vila 
Paranoá’s fishers sell fish directly in the streets, they sell 
it in strings and the main place is in the Vila itself. Most 
of the fishers there sell eviscerated fish to the middlemen 
and they measure it in kilograms. In this community, 
there is a third group that sells fish in fairs by kilogram, 
mainly in Planaltina town. Fishers commented that when 
the fish buyer does not show up, they sell the fish on 
the streets of Paranoá, Gama or Santa Maria. Gama was 
mentioned as the best place. The fish buyers that buy the 
fish in Paranoá resell it in Paranoá itself, in Santa Maria, 
Gama and Luziânia (Figure 1). 

The fishers in Buraco sell fish on the streets (main-
ly in Ceilândia - Figure 1) in strings or to the middle-
men and bar owners in cans. Trade is mostly done in 
Ceilândia, Parque das Emas or in Águas Lindas, areas 
where they live (Figure 1). In fairs, it is sold in Ceilândia 
or in Águas Lindas. 

The fishers in Vila da Telebrasília sell fish mainly in 
fairs in Pedregal, Gama and Céu Azul (Figure 1). They 
rarely sell fish to middlemen, but when they do the fish 
is sold in cans. 

3.5. Income 

In Figure 4, the calculated monthly income to the 
community is shown. This information is the financial 
result of the different community strategies related to 
fishing and fish commercialization. For this analysis, the 
information was considered according to the community 
the fishers belong to, the fishing equipment, payment 
to the other crew members, how often people fished, 
monthly catches and the number of months in which 
fishing took place. 

The monthly average income was U$ 238.73 
(s = 171.77), however the results demonstrate that there 

is a significant difference among the incomes of the three 
communities (p = 0.0135), where the monthly income of 
Vila Paranoá’s community (U$ 362.18, s = 184.17) is sig-
nificantly higher than Vila da Telebrasília (U$ = 131.18, 
s = 131.68, p = 0.0202). The monthly income of Buraco 
(U$ = 2?4.52, s = 116.78) does not differ from the in-
come of Paranoá (p = 0.72) and Telebrasília (p = 0.12), 
(Figure 4).

4. Discussion

4.1. Professional fishers 

Assessing the fish stock does not only mean evaluat-
ing the catch and the income. It is important to focus 
on the information from fishers and the market system, 
which governs the catch per unit of effort, as well as the 
biological characteristics of the species and to recog-
nize that the fishers are the political centre of the fish-
ery. Moreover, profit is what measures the success of the 
management (Hilborn and Walters, 1??2). 

Understanding the socioeconomic reality of the fish-
ers is of great importance, as far as implementing meas-
ures of fish stock management are concerned as well as 
the economic development of these populations. Bazigos 
(1?74) recommends doing censuses in order to find out 
the population of fishers in tropical areas of difficult ac-
cess, so that afterwards a data collection system can be 
made on the statistics of fish which have landed. 

In Lago Paranoá, the importance of studying the re-
ality of professional fishers entails understanding how 
much involved they are in society and in the job market, 
where a regulated fishery can create jobs in the Federal 
District (Paviani, 1??2). 

Although professional fishers are concentrated in 
four main communities (Figure 2), they belong to several 
areas of the Federal District and its surrounding towns 
which are the poorest according to official statistics 
(CODEPLAN, 1??7). 

The small estimated number of fishers in each one 
of the administrative regions (AR) does not allow us to 
make comparisons between the places where the fishers 
belong. However, a general analysis can be made evalu-
ating the fishers as a single group, as well as the situa-
tion of the population of the administrative regions to 
which they belong. It is important to point out that there 
are no official statistics in the towns from the State of 
Goiás (which surround the Federal District) and Vila da 
Telebrasília. 

In the general context of the Federal District, the 
average size of a family is of 4.15 members. The most 
numerous families live in Santa Maria (4.57 members) 
and Riacho Fundo (4.40 members, CODEPLAN, (1??7), 
smaller than the average fisher’s families (4.? members). 

The poor education level of a population restricts its 
employment opportunities because the job market is in-
creasingly more complex (Borges, 1??7). The level of 
education in the Federal District is comparatively low, 
where 40.?% do not reach the first degree (CODEPLAN,

1??7). In poorer villages, this situation is even worse. 
In Brazilândia town, 81.8% of the heads of the fami-
lies do not have basic education, in Recanto das Emas 
81.2%, in Samambaia 7?.06%, in Planaltina 78.6%, in 
Ceilândia 77.6% and in Paranoá ?0% (CODEPLAN, 
1??7). Professional fishers are in this situation, as they 
are more likely to be unemployed (Paviani, 1??2). 

The time of residence of fishers is higher in relation 
to the rest of the population of the DF: 35.3% have lived 
there from 0 to ? years, 2?% from 10 to 1? years, 22.7% 
from 20 to 2? years and 13.0% has lived there for more 
than thirty years (CODEPLAN. 1??7). From the inter-
viewees, only 11.5% were born in the DF, which is a 
low figure when compared to the rest of the population 
(43.?%), (CODEPLAN, 1??7). However, the official 
statistics refer to the whole population and not just to 
the heads of families, who do not consider their children 
who were born in the capital.

Houses are owned by 46.0% of the families in the 
DF, 37.2% live in somebody else’s properties and 10.8% 
of the population occupies dubious land: they are owners 
of their houses, but not of the plots of land. Therefore, 
they are a typical case of the establishments promoted by 
the government for the poor (CODEPLAN, 1??7). Most 
fishers claimed to live in their own houses. 41.6% of the 
population of the DF lives in houses, which are at most 
60 m2. This situation is worse in the Recanto das Emas 
(77.5%), São Sebastião (66.7%), Planaltina (64.?%), 
Paranoá (63.4%), Samambaia (61.7%) and Santa Maria 
(61.6%), (CODEPLAN, 1??7). 40.4% of fishers live in 
areas of up to 60 m2, which is an improvement than the 
rest of the DF, putting them in a minority class in relation 
to the average of RAs in which they live. However, this 
reality is regardless of the size, because concerning the 
material used in the construction, the DF has: i) 6?.1% 
of masonry houses, 17.7% are apartments and 10.2% 
huts (CODEPLAN, 1??7); ii) 3?.4% of the houses have 
ceramic floors and 3?.8% cement, reaching 60% of the 
houses in the RAs whose population has a smaller pur-
chasing power; iii) asbestos tile floors (72.4%), followed 
by mud floors (13.8%); and iv) the sanitary facilities are 
collective in 6.4% of the homes in the DF (CODEPLAN, 
1??7). The houses of the fishers are among the most pre-
carious, however the number of fishers who use collec-
tive bathrooms is smaller. 

Besides being one of a citizen’s fundamental rights, 
housing is the centre of sociability where organization of 
the family takes place. However, the quality of the house 
depends not only on intrinsic factors such as education 
and income, but also on sanitary facilities provided by 
public policies and ecological characteristics of the area 
(Borges, 1??7). Electric power supply, water, sewage 
and garbage collection are public services for most of 
the DF population (CODEPLAN, 1??7). This condition 
is above the national average (IBGE, 1??6) and it reflects 
the high degree of urbanization of the fishers and their 
dependence on public policies (in this case we can in-
clude the situation of land concession). 

The fish in Lago Paranoá is comparatively important 
(Table 5) as it is more consumed than in the Represa 
Billings, where 87% of the families of fishers consume 
the fish from the reservoir twice a week on average 
(Minte-Vera et al., 1??7). In two reservoirs in the Iguaçu 
River in the State of Paraná, the number of fish is low, as 
41.4% of the fishers’ families consume fish once a week 
(Okada et al., 1??7). When studying the community of 
the Mina d’Água (an invaded land that existed in 1?85 
close to the Lago Paranoá), Dias (1??4) pointed out that 
the fish in the reservoir was the only source of protein for 
many families. Petrere (1??5) also points out the impor-
tance of fish in the fishers´ diet, where in urban reservoirs 
such as the Lago Paranoá (DF), the dam Billings (SP) 
and the Lagoa da Pampulha (MG), it is their only source 
of protein. 

Payne (2000) considers that small-scale fishers come 
strictly from rural communities. However, in the Lago 
Paranoá, the fishers come from urban communities. 
This situation was also observed by Nehrer and Begossi 
(2000), where small-scale fishers from Posto Seis in 
Copacabana come from the slums of Rio de Janeiro 
city. Minte-Vera et al. (1??7) argue that Reservatório 
Billings’s fishers come from the metropolitan area of São 
Paulo, which is also urban. 

Acheson (1?81) points out that in industrial fisheries 
there is a division of work: while the men fish, women 
are responsible for the housework. Minte-Vera et al. 
(1??7) also argue that 16.4% of the fishers from Billings 
are women, including fishing as a whole: they handle all 
the equipment, hire assistants and own their own produc-
tion and most of the time they are independent from the 
fishermen

In Lago Paranoá, the presence of a class of younger 
fishers, consisting mainly of fisher’s children shows that 
there is continuity in fishing. All these fishers said that 
they were previously assistants of their parents when 
fishing. However, in spite of the high participation of 
the family in fishing, there is no work division in Lake 
Paranoá by age or sex. 

4.2. The fisheries 

4.2.1. Dedication to fishing 

The group of fishers that are devoted exclusively to 
fishing in a given place shows not only its cultural impor-
tance, but also that fisheries supply the need of income 
to a family. In the Lago Paranoá, the proportion of fish-
ers who fish exclusively is low, mainly compared to the 
Represa Billings, where 87.3% of the fishers only live 
from the fisheries (Minte-Vera et al., 1??7). However, 
the small number of fishers and their decrease through-
out the months is attributed to the secrecy of the fishing. 
In two reservoirs in Iguaçú River, where fishing is pro-
hibited, only 6.7% of the fishers live exclusively from 
fishing (Okada et al., 1??7). However, there is no time 
between harvests in Lago Paranoá. 

When we refer to the poor population, its inclusion 
in the job market makes it possible to understand it on 



Walter, T. and Petrere Jr., M.

Braz. J. Biol., 67(1): 9-21, 200718

an individual level. Jobs are very important because they 
are the main source of income of the poorest population 
(Baltar and Dequech Fo, 1??0). The more precarious the 
way an individual is seen in the job market, the larger 
the difference between his/her income and the necessary 
income to satisfy his/her basic needs. As a consequence, 
the larger his/her dependence is in relation to other as-
pects: public attendance, attendance of private and fa-
miliar institutions (Troyano, 1??0). The three groups of 
distinguished fishers reflect this situation. Only 3?.6% 
of the fishers are devoted to fishing, the others stopped 
due to low qualification jobs, reflecting the difficulty in 
the job market. This is the general situation of inequality 
in modern Brazil, which is even worse in Brasília where 
jobs are not very diversified (Costa, 1??2). 

4.2.2. Fishing economic resource

The professional fisheries in Lago Paranoá have gen-
eral attributes of small-scale fisheries: a small number of 
crew members who are usually partners, some of whom 
have friendly relationships; they have boats without en-
gines; very defined strategies and some are very knowl-
edgeable fishers (Bayley and Petrere, 1?8?; Petrere, 
1?8?; Fischer et al., 1??2; Diegues, 1??5). Tomanik 
(1??7) points out that the community from Porto Rico 
(PR) fish in pairs in a partnership system. Everything is 
divided and shared. Even the boat and most of the equip-
ment belong to one of the partners and this is not taken 
into account when sharing out the earnings or respon-
sibilities. Partnerships are usually set up among fishers, 
who have already had vast experience in fishing and who 
have some kind of fishing equipment. Another type of re-
lationship is established when there is a difference of age, 
professional experience and ownership. In these cases, 
the oldest fisher can hire a younger assistant, who has lit-
tle experience and still does not have his own equipment. 
He is paid a percentage without any expenses. 

The fishing economic resource (Bazigos, 1?74) in 
Lago Paranoá is a wooden canoe with one or two castnets. 
Therefore, the initial investment in fishing is U$ 184.55 
for gillnet fishing and U$ 87.22 for castnet fishing. It is 
a low investment when compared to other places, mainly 
those that use motorized boats. In the lower part of the 
São Francisco River, the price of an aluminium boat is 
U$ 1,317.15, a wooden one costs U$ 35?.64, the en-
gine costs U$ 1,165.72, the caceia net costs U$ 473.48, 
the gillnet costs U$ 122.11 and the castnet U$ 145,16 
(Camargo and Petrere, 2001). In the reservoir in Itaipú in 
the State of Paraná, the average cost for full equipment is 
U$ 818 (Agostinho et al., 1??4). However, the compara-
tively low investment in fishing in Lago Paranoá is due to 
constantly replacing material and to inspections, which 
does not encourage the fisher to invest more. On the other 
hand, the small amount of equipment per fisher and the 
use of paddle canoes reduce the number of fishers. 

4.2.3. The species which are caught

There are few species of fish in the small-scale fish-
eries in Lago Paranoá and the Nile Tilapia represents 

84.?% of the haul in weight, followed by the common 
Carp (11.1%) and the Congo Tilapia (2.21%, Table 7).

In many other places in the tropical world, small-
scale fisheries are sustained by these species (Fernando, 
1??1; Fernando and Holcik, 1??1). In Colombia, in 
Honduras and in the Dominican Republic, the Nile 
Tilapia is the species which is caught most (FAO, 2003). 
In the Brazilian Northeastern dams, when Tilapias were 
introduced, they increased the fishing productivity of 
these reservoirs, ranging from 18 to 667 kg.ha-1.year-1 
(Paiva et al., 1??4). In 2000, 231 thousand tons were 
caught worldwide (FAO, 2003). 

In Java, there are reservoirs with very high produc-
tion, for instance, a lake of 25 hectares has a productivity 
from 500 to 600 kg.ha-1, mostly consisting of Cyprinus 
carpio (data compiled by Lowe-McConnell, 1??1). The 
fisheries in Lake Tana in Ethiopia is confined to the 
Golf of Bahir with a low production of 4 kg.ha-1.year-1. 
There are two main types of fishing: i) a small-scale 
subsistence fishery, consisting of papyrus canoes mainly 
catching Nile Tilapia and Barbel Barbus tsanensis and 
ii) motorized fishing, which catches Barbus sp and the 
African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Wudneh, 1??8). 
Since 1?52 in Sri Lanka, the Tilapia Oreochromis mos-
sambicus is the most important species in inland fisher-
ies with an estimated productivity ranging from 270 to 
300 kg.ha-1.year-1 (Pet, 1??5). The Tilapia Oreochromis 
aureus and the Cyprinidae family are the main produce 
in Cuban reservoirs (Quirós and Mari, 1???). 

The composition of the haul in Lago Paranoá´s pro-
fessional fisheries differs from the experimental gillnet 
fishing carried out by Lazzaro et al. (1??8), where the 
common carp was more abundant (23.4% from a total 
of 342.6 kg) followed by the Nile Tilapia (18.8%). The 
explanation is due to the castnets used in the profession-
al fisheries, equipment which was not used by Lazzaro 
et al. (1??8) in their sampling. 

The low richness and high species dominance ob-
served in the Lago Paranoá fish community is indicative 
of communities who suffer from stress, which is due to 
i) the transformation of a lotic ecosystem to a lentic one; 
ii) the posterior eutrophization; and iii) the introduction 
of species (Magurran, 1?88). 

4.3. Commercialization 

Selling fish in the Lago Paranoá has many particu-
lar aspects. The first consists of not having a real by-
catch where the other species have a market value or are 
sold together with the Tilapias. This rarely happens in 
other fisheries, such as Minte-Vera and Petrere (2000). 
The fisheries in Reservatório Billings point out that the 
caborja Hoplosternum littorale is not well accepted, even 
in bad season fisheries. 

A second interesting aspect is the fisher who takes the 
best fish for his own consumption. This could be a conse-
quence of not catching many of these species associated 
to the highly valued Tilapia. However, the most important 
aspect of the commercialization system in Lago Paranoá 
was attributed to fishers who are owners of their own

production. Therefore, these fishers do not depend on the 
middlemen providing them with food (the fishing trips are 
local and short) and paying for their fishing equipment. 
The choice between directly selling to the consumer or 
to the middlemen is free, and therefore the price obtained 
for their fish is higher than many of the Brazilian reser-
voirs, even if commercialization is represented mainly by 
a single species, which is the Nile Tilapia. In the Represa 
Billings, for example, Tilapia is sold filleted (four kilos of 
fish is needed for a kilo of filet, Minte-Vera and Petrere, 
2000) and is sold to the middlemen for U$ 1.55. The 
fish which reaches the highest prices in the reservoir at 
Sobradinho (4,200 km2) in the State of Bahia was sold for 
U$ 1.50 the kilo to the middlemen (Agostinho, 1??7). 

In the middle part of the São Francisco River, sell-
ing takes place by an unjust income distribution where 
fishers only receive 5% of the final price of their product. 
The consumers have to pay for the costs of quite com-
plex a chain of middlemen (PROJETO BRA/?0/005). 

In the Northeastern dams selling depends on middle-
men where the participation of the fisher in the final price 
of the fish is 28% (PROJETO BRA/?0/005). 

On the other hand, fishers or at the most two mid-
dlemen at the Lago Paranoá set their price. Fish is not 
exported to other federations, as it is supplied fresh at an 
accessible price to the local population. It is cheaper than 
most of the original fish from other places and the fish-
ers are paid more. This situation is due to fact that Lago 
Paranoá is the only appropriate fishing waterbody in the 
Federal District and its population consumes a larger 
amount of fish (12.8 kg.capita-1.year-1) in relation to the 
Brazilian average (5.8 kg.capita-1.year-1), (PROGRAM 
OF FISH FARMING OF DF, unpublished). The DF 
imports 4,000 tons of fish a year (Rui Donizzeti – civil 
servant from the Ministry of Agriculture – Fish Farming 
Project of the DF – personal communication to TW, 
1???) and the fish caught in Lago Paranoá represents less 
than 2% of its total consumption.

A final aspect, which is a consequence of fishers sell-
ing directly in streets and fairs, is also an important so-
cial role which encourages solidarity and possibly comes 
from small rural communities. It involves exchang-
ing their production with people in the neighborhood. 
Amoroso (1?81) points out that in the poor outskirts of 
Manaus, donating or exchanging food is common, main-
ly in poor families. 

4.4. The monthly income 

Income generated by fishing is a consequence of the 
strategies used by fishers and the decisive social function 
of fisheries (Hilborn and Walters, 1??2). 

The monthly income is higher in Vila Paranoá 
(U$ 362.18) in relation to Vila da Telebrasília 
(U$ 131.18), possibly due to most of the fishers from 
Paranoá fishing full time, even if most sell the fish for 
smaller prices. The Vila da Telebrasília community tends 
to fish as well as doing other activities. The Buraco com-
munity has an income of U$ 2?4.52, although it is not 
significantly different from the other two. 

It is worth mentioning that the income of Lago 
Paranoá’s fishers is high, when compared to other 
Brazilian reservoirs, as the productivity and the amount 
of fishers is larger and they have species which are ac-
cepted more on the market. In the Sobradinho reservoir, 
for example, the monthly income of the fishers who fish 
in the most productive areas is U$ 375.21 (Agostinho, 
1??7). In Billings reservoir, where the main fish species 
is also the Nile Tilapia, 34% of the fishers said they had a 
basic income of U$ 105.00 to U$ 210.00 (Minte-Vera and 
Petrere, 2000). Cetra and Petrere (2001) calculated that 
the daily income of the professional fishers of the middle 
part of the Tocantins River was U$ 2.00. They attributed 
this low income due to the middlemen who control the 
means of production. Okada et al. (1??7) calculated that 
the income of the fishers from two reservoirs in the Iguaçú 
River is U$ 12.00/day. The monthly profit of fishing in the 
Itaipú reservoir is only U$ 25.00 (Agostinho et al., 1??4). 
However, in these places fishing is done on motorized ca-
noes, there is a supply of ice, freezers and more equipment 
used by each fisher, which increases his/her costs. 

A second interesting comparison is to evaluate the in-
come with the average values of social groups IV and V 
(CODEPLAN, 1??7) to which these fishers belong. In this 
situation, even if fishing is the only source of the family’s 
income, the family would have the same living standards 
of other non-fishing families, and therefore if fishing was 
regularized, it would be economically sustainable.

5. Conclusions 

Small-scale fishing has been present at the Lago 
Paranoá ever since it was built. The fishers have adapted 
catching the fish species according to its evolution, pre-
senting different strategies, according to the community 
they belong to: Vila da Telebrasília, Buraco, Vila Paranoá 
and ETE Norte. 

Among the poorest population in the Federal District, 
the fishers have a source of income as well as cheap pro-
tein and the important task of supplying it to the rest of 
the population. The sale may not be in cash and donating 
fish is quite common.

Although some of it is illegal, the annual catch has 
reached 62.5 tons with an income of 41.7 kg.fishery-1 
equivalent to 224.7 kg.fisher-1.month-1 and a productivity 
of 15.4 kg.ha-1.year-1. Therefore, low productivity in fish-
ing is due to its secrecy: i) where it is not worth investing 
in fishing material; ii) there is a limit to catching and ef-
fort from which it is not worth running the risk of having 
the material confiscated by inspectors; and iii) there are 
no landing facilities, freezers and supply of ice, which 
would limit catching the fish and increase fishing costs. 

The high amount of tilapias and carps, which are 
caught, is a consequence of them being dominant in this 
reservoir and the fact that appropriate catching strategies 
are used. 

Selling fish is mainly the responsibility of the fisher, 
as he/she owns cheap fishing equipment and is free to 
choose to whom he/she sells the fish.

Productivity together with the added value given by 
the fish, as well as a high demand/offer, makes fishing 
profitable when compared to small-scale fishing else-
where, and is a good job alternative. Therefore, the pro-
fessional fisheries at Lago Paranoá have particular char-
acteristics compared to other inland Brazilian fisheries. 

The fishery also has pleasant environmental and so-
cial requirements: the catch in weight of alien species is 
?8% of the total; the Tilapias caught by castnet are ben-
eficial in order to control algae; the fishers come from the 
poor population and fishing is profitable economically. 
The cultural aspects of fishing can still be seen as part of 
the patrimony of the capital city of Brasília.
