Abstract: This work presents the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotope compositions of nine 

samples of bottled waters from several regions of Portuguese mainland. The 

Sr isotopic variability displayed by the analysed waters is strongly 

correlated with the age and mineralogical composition of the aquifer source 

rocks, suggesting that the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotope signatures of these mineral 

waters are dominantly controlled by fluid-rock and/or fluid-mineral 

interaction processes. The lowest 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios are found in water samples 

from the Monchique aquifer (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.70447), located in Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmatic rocks of mantle origin. The Vimeiro waters 

hosted in carbonate and evaporite formations of Jurassic age have 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

values of 0.70808 and appear to have reached bulk isotopic equilibrium 

with whole-rock, whereas the waters sourced in Cenozoic siliciclastic 

sediments tend to exhibit 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios close to the rainwater value (São 

Silvestre; 
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.71078). Finally, the waters coming from granitic 

and/or metamorphic terrains of the Iberian Variscan basement (Vitalis, 

Luso, Carvalhelhos, Fastio and Serra da Estrela) display the most 

radiogenic Sr isotopic signatures (
87

Sr/
86

Sr &gt; 0.7136). In the modern 

commercial context, the differences encountered provide a powerful tool for 

fingerprinting the mineral water origin and may be used for purposes of 

mineral water authentication. The results obtained also show the relevance 

of Sr isotopes as geochemical tracers in hydrogeology.

Sr obtidas em nove amostras de águas engarrafadas 

provenientes de vários pontos do território continental português. A 

variabilidade isotópica encontrada nas águas analisadas relaciona-se com 

a idade e com a composição mineralógica das rochas do aquífero de 

origem, o que sugere que as razões isotópicas de Sr são fortemente 

controladas por processos de interacção água - rocha e/ou água - 

minerais. Os valores mais baixos de

Sr encontram-se nas águas do 

aquífero de Monchique (
87

Sr/

Sr = 0,70447), que estão associadas a 

ocorrências magmáticas alcalinas do Cretácico superior. As águas de 

Vimeiro, captadas em formações carbonatadas e evaporíticas do 

Mesozoico apresentam valores de 
87

Sr/
86

Sr de 0,70808, sugerindo que 

estas águas alcançaram o equilibrio isotópico com as rochas do aquífero, 

enquanto as águas associadas a rochas sedimentares siliciclásticas de 

idade cenozóica possuem razões isotópicas muito próximas dos valores 

que se encontram na água da chuva (São Silvestre; 
87

Sr/

Sr = 0,71078). 

Por último, as águas procedentes de rochas graníticas e/ou metamórficas 

do soco varisco (Vitalis, Luso, Carvalhelhos, Fastio e Serra da Estrela) 

apresentam composições isotópicas de Sr mais radiogénicas (

0,7136). Num contexto comercial as diferenças encontradas 

proporcionam uma ferramenta que poderá ser usada para fins de

1. Introduction 

In the past decades, the European market of bottled mineral 

waters and spring waters has been steadily growing due to the 

progressive increase in the water consumption per capita (from 

30 L to 108 L per year over the period 1997-2004) (Euzen, 2006; 

Brach-Papa et al., 2009). As reported by Brach-Papa et al. (2009) 

and references therein, the European legislation on this subject is 

very strict and contains precise specifications on several 

parameters such as the maximum concentrations of the major 

constituents, the type of processes authorized for bottling and the 

labelling information that should be provided to the consumers 

by the producers. From the large number of requirements of a 

‘‘Natural Mineral Water’’, the source provenance is one of the 

most important. Only mineral waters with clear details of 

provenance are included in the list of ‘‘Natural Mineral Waters’ 

recognised by the European Union state members. 

Recent studies have demonstrated that Sr isotopes provide a 

way of fingerprinting different mineral waters and may therefore 

be applied, in combination with other chemical and isotope data, 

for source authentication purposes (e.g. Négrel et al., 1997; 

Montgomery et al., 2006; Voerkelius et al., 2010; Marques et al., 

2012). Since water is completely bio-available to plants and 

animals and can be transferred to any organic material without 

significant fractionation of Sr isotopes, the determination of 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotope ratios has also been widely used to trace the 

geographic origin of a large variety of food products (e.g. wine, 

milk, butter and fruit juices) (Horn et al., 1993; 1998; Aberg, 

1995; Rossmann et al., 2000; Almeida and Vasconcelos, 2001; 

Barbaste et al., 2002; Crittenden et al., 2007; Rummel et al., 

2008). 

Strontium is a divalent cation that can easily substitute Ca
2+

 

in the crystal lattice of Ca-bearing minerals, such as plagioclase 

feldspar, apatite, titanite, calcite, aragonite and dolomite. It has 

four naturally occurring isotopes

Sr, 
86

Sr, 
87

Sr and 
88

Sr. 
84

Sr, 
86

Sr and 
88

Sr are stable, whereas 
87

Sr derives from the radioactive 

decay of 
87

Rb (Faure and Mensing 2005). As a result, the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios in rocks and minerals tend to increase with time.

Unlike strontium, rubidium is incorporated in K-bearing silicate 

minerals, including K-feldspars, micas and clay minerals. Of the 

two naturally occurring Rb isotopes (
85

Rb and 
87

Rb), 
87

Rb is 

radioactive and decays to radiogenic 
87

Sr by ?
-
 emission. Thus, 

the age and the Rb content of a rock are the major factors 

controlling its present day 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratio. Old sialic crustal rocks 

with high Rb/Sr ratios have the most radiogenic Sr isotopic 

signatures (
87

Sr/
86

Sr &gt; 0.709). In contrast, geologically young Rb-

depleted basaltic rocks typically display the lowest 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

ratios (0.703 - 0.706), whilst Sr-enriched calcareous sediments 

and limestones are generally characterized by 
87

Sr/
86

Sr values 

ranging between 0.706 and 0.709. 

It is commonly assumed that Sr isotopes are not significantly 

affected by mass fractionation during chemical weathering 

processes (Shand et al., 2009). Therefore, the Sr released to the 

water is a function of both the composition and the stability of 

the aquifer bedrock forming minerals (Faure, 1986; Négrel et al., 

1993; 2001). As the reaction kinetics of mineral dissolution may 

vary over several orders of magnitude, the Sr isotope signature 

recorded in the water is dominantly controlled by the most easily 

weathered minerals and does not always reflect the bulk isotopic 

composition of the parent rock (e.g. Blum et al., 1993; Aberg, 

1995, Jacobson et al., 2002; Bau et al., 2004, Montgomery et al., 

2006; Shand et al., 2009). For water reservoirs interacting with 

silicate lithologies, isotope equilibrium with whole-rock is rarely 

achieved, because the reactivity rates of their rock-forming 

minerals are widely variable. In contrast, the waters sourced in 

carbonate environments often show close to equilibrium Sr 

isotope compositions due to the high solubilities of carbonate 

minerals. More complex distribution patterns occur when water 

systems receive Sr inputs from various sources with contrasting 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios (e.g. Négrel, 1999; Négrel et al., 2001; Barbieri 

and Morotti, 2003). The final isotopic characteristics of these 

waters will be determined by the compositions and the relative 

contributions of the different end-members involved in the 

mixture. 

Natural waters have short residence times (maximum 10
3
 

years) compared to the half-life of 
87

Rb
 
(48,8x10

9
 years) and 

suffer no influence of the 
87

Rb radioactive decay. Weathering 

of carbonate minerals is generally very rapid, but the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

ratios in waters from non-carbonate aquifers can be strongly 

affected by the timescale at which water-rock interaction 

processes take place. Longer residence times tend to favour the 

hydrolysis reactions of silicate phases (plagioclase feldspar, 

followed by K-feldspar and micas), allowing groundwater to 

approach the equilibrium with the crystalline host rocks (Bullen 

et al., 1996; Frost e Toner, 2004; Blum e Erel, 2005). 

According to Frost and Toner (2004), the permeability 

associated with igneous and metamorphic rocks can also 

influence the weathering process, with low permeabilities 

slowing groundwater equilibration rates. 

In addition to natural causes, the use of fertilizers 

(including dolomite, potash, nitrogen and phosphate materials) 

may produce changes in the rates of release and exchange of Sr 

in soils and significant variations in the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios of 

shallow groundwaters and streams draining these regions. 

Groundwater contamination by agricultural activities or other 

pollutant sources can disturb their original chemical and 

isotopic characteristics and add further complexities to the 

investigation of their source provenance (e.g. Bohlke e Horan, 

2000; Soler et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2009). 

A valid interpretation of water Sr isotope signatures 

requires therefore a thorough knowledge of the potential 

hydrogeochemical processes operating along water flow paths, 

because the Sr isotope composition of natural waters is not 

always a conservative property and may be highly influenced 

by the following factors: (a) reaction kinetics of mineral 

dissolution and exchange efficiency; (b) thermodynamic 

equilibrium; (c) water residence time; (d) mixing of waters of 

distinct provenance and (e) addition of natural or anthropogenic 

contaminants. 

The aim of the present investigation is to determine the Sr 

isotope composition of natural mineral waters from different 

geologic environments in Portuguese mainland and assess the 

extent to which the Sr radiogenic isotopes can be used to trace 

their origin. 

2. Geological setting 

Portuguese mainland is located in the western and southwestern 

sector of Iberia, at latitudes between 42.2°N to 36.92°N and 

longitudes between 9.61° W to 6.07° W (Fig. 1). In broad terms, 

it comprises terrains of the Variscan basement, occupying 

extensive areas in the inner part of the country and a Mesozoic–

Cenozoic sedimentary cover, particularly well exposed along its 

western and southwestern margins (Fig. 1). The Variscan 

basement, also known as Iberian Massif, is composed of 

thrusted, folded and metamorphosed rocks of Late Proterozoic 

and Paleozoic age and large granitoid batholiths intruded in the 

last stages of the Late Paleozoic Variscan oblique continent-

continent collision (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 1979; Matte, 1986; 

Quesada, 1991).

Vera et al., 2004).

(adaptado de Vera et al., 2004). 

During Mesozoic times, extensional tectonics related to the 

opening of the North Atlantic Ocean resulted in the development 

of the Lusitanian and the Algarve rift basins along the western 

and southwestern borders of Iberia (Ribeiro et al., 1979; Wilson 

et al., 1989; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Terrinha, 1998). The 

stratigraphic record preserved in these fault-bounded basins 

includes Late Triassic red fluvial siliciclastics, Hettangian 

evaporites and Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous limestones, 

sandstones and shales, documenting the occurrence of several 

rifting episodes from early Triassic to early Cretaceous (Wilson 

et al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 1996). 

Continental breakup was accompanied by three cycles of 

magmatic activity. The first cycle is represented on-shore by 

basaltic and dolerite dykes of tholeiitic affinities intruded at 

around 200 Ma. This episode was followed by the emplacement 

of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous intrusives with transitional 

characteristics, at approximately 140 Ma (Ferreira e Macedo, 

1979; Martins, 1991; Martins et al., 2008; Verati et al., 2007). 



Sr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 31 

 

The last magmatic cycle took place between 100 and 70 Ma and 

includes the NNW-SSE aligned subvolcanic alkaline complexes 

of Sintra, Sines and Monchique, the volcanic complex of 

Lisbon and other minor alkaline intrusions (Miranda et al., 

2009). 

Finally, the Cenozoic evolution of Iberia was strongly 

controlled by Alpine compression, involving distinct periods of 

crustal deformation, fault reactivation, and halokinesis related to 

multiple episodes of collision between Iberia, Eurasia and Africa 

(e.g. Mougenot, 1986; Malod and Mau¡ret, 1990; Srivastava et 

al., 1990; Rosembaum et al., 2002; Alves et al., 2003). These 

tectonic events are well expressed by a series of unconformity-

bounded Cenozoic sequences. Basin infilling resulted from the 

interplay between alluvial fan, lacustrine, fluvial and shallow 

marine sedimentation and consists of major siliciclastic facies 

assemblages associated with minor carbonates (Antunes et al., 

1999, Pais et al., 2010). 

3. Sampling and analytical techniques 

The samples analysed in this study were collected from 250 -

1500 mL water bottles from different brands, purchased in 

grocery stores. Only mineral waters with clear details for 

provenance, mineral content values and physical parameters 

were selected for analysis. Their geographical origin was 

determined through the address labelled on the bottle and 

further confirmed by direct contact with the technical director 

of each mineral water company. Many of the waters now 

exploited on a commercial basis have a long documented 

history of use and are believed to be endowed with healing 

properties. Of the nine samples analysed, eight are classified as 

‘‘Natural Mineral Waters’’ and one as “Spring Water”. In order 

to assess the effects from mixing of water from several 

boreholes, filtering and bottling processes and potential 

seasonal variations of strontium isotope ratios, the 

characterization of each type of water involved the 

measurement of two / three replicate samples with different 

bottling dates and serial numbers. For comparison purposes, 

samples of rainwater and snow were also collected and 

analysed. To minimize contamination, snow samples were 

collected approximately 0.1 - 0.2 m below the snow surface and 

stored into pre-cleaned containers. 

Sample preparation involved previous filtering of rainwater 

and snow samples through a pre-washed 0.5 ?m Millipore 

filter. All water samples were then acidified to pH 2 with 

redistilled concentrated HNO3. A volume of 250 mL for 

rainwater and snow samples and 10 - 50 mL for bottled waters 

was measured into pre-cleaned Teflon beakers and evaporated 

to dryness. The residue was subsequently acidified with 1mL 

sub-boiled HF and 0.5 mL sub-boiled HNO3 and dried. Each 

sample was then dissolved using 1 mL of sub-boiled 6.2N HCl 

and evaporated to dryness. Strontium was collected using 

conventional AG8 50W Bio-Rad resin ion exchange methods 

and loaded on single tantalum filaments with H3PO4. 

The Sr isotope compositions were determined using a VG 

Sector 54 multi-collector mass spectrometer in the Laboratory 

of Isotope Geology of the University of Aveiro. All 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

ratios were corrected for instrumental mass fractionation and 

normalized to 
86

Sr/
88

Sr = 0.1194. The in-run precision of each 

analysis lies between 30 to 50 ppm, with two standard 

deviations from the mean (2? error) and Sr blanks are less than 

250 pg. The international standard SRM-987 gave an average 

value of 0.710249 ? 6 (n = 18) during this study. 

Sr concentrations in the water samples were obtained by 

inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the 

University of Aveiro. 

4. Results and discussion 

The location of the studied samples is shown in the simplified 

geological map of Portugal of figure 2. Chemical and Sr isotopic 

data for rainwater and snow samples are given in table 1. General 

information for the analysed bottled mineral waters, including 

source, water type, mineral content values and pH are presented 

in table 2, whilst their Sr contents and 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotopic ratios are 

compiled in table 3. Thorough reviews on the main chemical 

characteristics of Portuguese bottled mineral waters can be found 

in Lourenço et al. (2010).

4.1 Rainwater and snow 

The Sr isotopic ratios for rainwater (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.709287 - 

0.710345) and snow samples (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.708415 - 0.710805) 

show a considerable degree of overlap (Tab. 1). Despite the small 

number of samples collected and their scattered spatial and 

temporal distribution (2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010), the data 

obtained in this study lie within the range of values published in 

the literature for rainwater in Portugal and other European 

countries, such as Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and 

Scotland (Fig. 3). The average value (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.70951 ? 

0.00033) provides therefore a rough estimate for the isotopic 

composition of rain in Portugal. 



32  S. Ribeiro et al. / Comunicações Geológicas (2014) 101, 1, 29-37 

 

As pointed out by Négrel et al. (2007), the Sr isotopic signature 

of rainwater is dominantly controlled by the nature of the 

atmospheric aerosol sources, including sea salts, crustal dust, 

volcanic dust, biogenic material and anthropogenic emissions. In 

the present case, most of the rainwater and snow samples have 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios similar or slightly higher than that of seawater 

(
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.70918 ± 1, Faure and Mensing, 2005) revealing that 

sea salts are probably the major source of dissolved species for 

rain and snow falls in Portugal. A significant contribution of 

continental dusts from silicate terrains of the Variscan basement 

(e.g. granite, gneiss, metasediments) and/or Cenozoic cover 

deposits is strongly suggested for the rain and snow samples with 

more radiogenic compositions (
87

Sr/

Sr &gt; 0.709).

4.2 Bottled mineral waters 

Sr concentrations and 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios for the analysed bottled 

mineral waters are presented in table 3. The lack of significant 

differences in the isotopic compositions of replicate samples 

from the same brand, pumped and bottled at distinct dates, 

demonstrates that the potential influence of mixing between 

waters from different boreholes, filtering and bottling processes 

and/or seasonal variations of strontium isotope ratios can be 

neglected. 

Figure 4 shows that the nine samples of Portuguese mineral 

waters are clearly distinguished on the basis of their 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

signatures. The Monchique water drawn from Late Cretaceous 

alkaline magmatic aquifer rocks is the least radiogenic (
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

= 0.70447) of the analysed mineral waters. The water samples 

hosted in Jurassic limestones (“Vimeiro”) and Miocene 

sandstones (“São Silvestre”) have average 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotopic 

ratios of 0.708086 and 0.71077, respectively, which, in the latter 

case, are very close to rainwater values. Finally, all the remaining 

bottled mineral waters come from areas of the Variscan basement 

and yield very radiogenic isotopic compositions (
87

Sr/
86

Sr &gt; 

0.713). As discussed below, the stratigraphic age of the aquifer 

host rocks and their mineralogical composition appear to be the 

main factors governing the water Sr isotope signatures.

Cenozoic cover deposits - “São Silvestre” water 

The São Silvestre water is sourced from two similar deep wells 

(more than 176 m depth) in the Santarém region (Fig. 2). The 

aquifer (82 - 176 m depth) is located in continental siliciclastic 

units of Miocene age (Burdigalian - Helvetian), known as the 

detrital complexes of “Ota” and “Arneiro de Milhariças”, which 

are overlain by marls and carbonate sediments from the 

Sarmatian - Pontian complex. The three sedimentary complexes 

are part of the infilling deposits of a large basin differentiated at 

middle Eocene times, as a result of the reactivation of NE-SW 

fractures - the Lower Tejo Cenozoic basin (Figs. 1 and 2). 



Sr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 33 

 

In terms of Sr isotopic composition, there are strong 

similarities between the São Silvestre water (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.710754 

- 0.710785) and rainwater (Fig. 4). This suggests that the Sr 

isotopic signature of this water was probably controlled by direct 

rainfall recharge of the aquifer and has not suffered significant 

influence of water-rock interaction processes. According to 

Albino de Medeiros (oral communication), technical director of 

this water, the admitted short residence time and high velocity 

flow of water on São Silvestre aquifer may therefore have 

prevented groundwater from equilibrating with the host rocks. 

The nature of the bedrock (sandstones) can also have contributed 

to inhibit extensive interaction between groundwater and the 

surrounding reservoir rocks, because the main mineral 

constituents in these deposits (quartz ± K-feldspar + micas ± clay 

minerals; Manuppella et al., 2006) are not easily dissolved 

(Bullen et al., 1996; Frost and Toner, 2004; Blum and Erel, 

2005).

However, the relatively high mineralization content and pH 

value recorded in the São Silvestre waters (181 mg/L, pH = 

7.13; Tab. 2) and, particularly their elevated Sr concentrations 

(Sr = 64 ppb, Tab. 2), point to some ion input from the marls 

and carbonate sediments from the overlying Sarmatian - 

Pontian formations along their flow path. As, on the other hand, 

the clastic component of the Cenozoic sediments is mostly 

derived from weathering of strongly radiogenic Precambrian 

and Palaeozoic rocks and would therefore have produced 

waters with relatively high 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotopic ratios, an 

alternative scenario can be proposed. In this model, the isotopic 

signature of the São Silvestre water could have resulted from 

mixing of distinct Sr sources (meteoric water, carbonates with 

low 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotopic ratios and sandstones with high 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

isotopic ratios). 

Irrespective of the model assumed, the available data 

suggest that the São Silvestre mineral aquifer corresponds to a 

semi-confined aquifer in which water flows on the Miocene 

detrital formation but also receives water, by leakage, from the 

overlying carbonates. 

Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic rocks – “Monchique” water 

The Late Cretaceous Monchique alkaline subvolcanic complex 

crops out in the southwest corner of Portugal (Fig. 2) and consists 

of two concentric bodies of nepheline syenites and minor 

occurrences of mafic and ultramafic rocks (Rock, 1978; Miranda 

et al., 2009). These alkaline magmas of deep mantle origin were 

intruded into Carboniferous slates and quartzites from the 

Brejeira Formation, at around 72 Ma (MacIntyre and Berger, 

1982, Rock, 1976; Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 

2004). 

The Monchique water flows through a highly fractured 

bedrock, taps a deep aquifer (at least several hundred meters 

deep) and is recovered from drill holes at temperatures of 27? - 

31.5 ºC (Lourenço and Cruz, 2010; Tab. 2). Its Na-HCO3 

chemical character and high pH values (total mineral contents = 

295 mg/L, pH = 9.13; Tab. 2) indicate that groundwater has 

significantly interacted with the main mineral phases (K-feldspar 

+ albite + nepheline) present in the nepheline syenite host rocks. 

Progressive dissolution of Na-silicates (albite and nepheline) was 

probably the major cause for the increase of sodium 

concentration and alkalinity in the Monchique water. However, it 

is likely that ion exchange reactions between groundwater and 

Na-rich clays produced by weathering of primary minerals along 

fracture zones has also contributed to the chemical signature of 

the Monchique water (Venturelli et al., 2003). Also relevant for 

the geochemical composition of the Monchique water is the 

contribution of other deep-origin components (CO2, H2S, NaCl 

and N2) (Calado and Vieira da Silva, 2003). 

From the group of samples of bottled mineral waters analysed 

in this study, the Monchique water is the least radiogenic 

(
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.704448 - 0.704486; Fig. 4). The 
87

Sr/
86

Sr isotopic 

ratios for this sample lie within the range of present-day whole-

rock values displayed by the nepheline syenites (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 

0.703674 ± 52 - 0,705189 ± 56, Valadares, 2004), revealing that 

groundwater appears to have reached almost complete 

equilibrium with the aquifer host rocks. Both the bulk chemistry 

and the Sr isotopic composition of the Monchique water may 

therefore result from long-term fluid-rock interaction 

mechanisms, at relatively high temperature. 

Mesozoic Limestones – “Vimeiro” water 

The Vimeiro mineral water comes from a deep-seated confined 

aquifer (? 200 m) of Late Jurassic karstified limestones (Upper 

Kimmeridgian), located in the southern sector of the Lusitanian 

Basin (Fig. 1). At the presently exposed level, the limestones 

occur at the flanks of a NNE-SSW salt anticline structure 

(Maceira diapir) with a core composed of Late Triassic 

mudstones, carbonates and evaporites from the “Dagorda 

Formation” (Hettangian) (Manuppella et al., 1999). The region is 

famous for its thermal bath resort and highly mineralized springs. 

The water is heated by circulation down to 1000 m in depth 

reaching temperatures of 35 ºC and discharges in a valley situated 

on the eastern flank of the diapir zone, with temperatures up to 

26°C (Costa, 1982). 

The chemical composition (Na-Ca-Cl-HCO3) and high total 

dissolved solids content (1112 mg/L) of the Vimeiro bottled 

mineral water (Tab. 2) can be attributed to intense dissolution of 

carbonates (calcite/dolomite), sulphates (anhydrite/gypsum) and 

chloride salts (halite) from the buried Mesozoic carbonate and 

evaporite formations during deep groundwater flow and mostly 

during ascending terminal fluxes. Widespread water–rock 

interaction processes involving highly soluble minerals with 

typically low Rb/Sr values would have enabled groundwater to 

equilibrate chemically and isotopically with the aquifer host

rocks, explaining the low 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios found in the sample of 

the Vimeiro water (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.708084 - 0.708087, Fig. 4). 

Assuming that the Sr isotopic composition of the Vimeiro 

groundwater is inherited from the evaporite/marine carbonate 

rock system with which it interacts, its isotope ratio should 

encompass the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr seawater curve for Late Triassic and/or 

Late Jurassic times. However, the average Sr isotopic ratio 

obtained in the sample of the Vimeiro natural mineral water is 

slightly higher than the values reported in the literature for 

Hettangian and Upper Kimmeridgian seawater (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 

0.7077 and 0.7069 respectively; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001). As 

such, it is possible that the observed increase reflects changes in 

the Sr isotopic signatures of the reservoir rocks induced by post-

depositional diagenetic processes or derive from mixing with 

more radiogenic non-marine waters. Irrespective of the factors 

controlling this subtle shift towards more elevated 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

ratios, the Sr isotopic composition of the Vimeiro groundwater is 

entirely consistent with the published data for aquifers associated 

with Mesozoic marine carbonates (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.7070 - 0.7090; 

Voerkelius et al., 2010). 

Variscan granitoids – “Carvalhelhos”, “Fastio”, “Serra da 

Estrela” mineral waters 

The water samples included in this group are all hosted in 

granitoid intrusions from Northern/Central Portugal (Fig. 2). 

Most of these plutons were emplaced into metasediments of Late 

Proterozoic to Paleozoic age, during or slightly after the last 

Variscan deformation event (D3). Based on their structural, 

petrographical and geochemical characteristics, the Portuguese 

Variscan granitoids have been classified into four main suites: a) 

early, syn-D3 granodiorites and biotite monzogranites; b) strongly 

peraluminous syn-D3 leucogranites and two-mica granites; c) 

late-post-D3 calc-alkaline granodiorites and biotite monzogranites 

and (d) late-post-D3, slightly peraluminous, biotite-muscovite 

granites (Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references 

therein). It is generally accepted that the synkinematic 

leucogranites and two-mica granites have S-type signatures 

(
87

Sr/
86

Sri &gt; 0.708) and should therefore have derived from 

partial melting of middle crustal metasedimentary sources 

(Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references therein). In 

contrast, a major contribution from metaigneous lower crust 

materials and/or interaction with mantle derived magmas appears 

to be required to produce the least radiogenic I- and H-type syn-

D3 and late-post-D3 granodiorite-monzogranite suites (
87

Sr/
86

Sri &amp;lt;

0.708) (Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references 

therein). 

The Carvalhelhos water has very peculiar characteristics. It 

comes from a large hydrologic province of hot and cold CO2-rich 

thermal and mineral springs, located in the Galicia-Trás-os-

Montes para-autochthonous terrains of NE Portugal. Many of 

these CO2-rich waters are issued from granitic aquifers, at the 

intersection of major fault systems, reactivated during Alpine 

compression (e.g. Marques et al., 2006; Marques et al., 2010; 

Lourenço, 2010). According to several authors, their high CO2 

contents result from fluids of deep-seated (upper-mantle) origin, 

carrying a CO2-rich gaseous phase, that have migrated towards 

the surface through the regional fault network (e.g. Marques et 

al., 2006; Carreira et al., 2008; Marques et al., 2010). 

In the Carvalhelhos area, the spring emergences occur close 

to the contact between the Barroso syn-D3 two-mica granite and 

the Silurian metasedimentary sequences, with a temperature of 

22°C, a total mineralization of 230 mg/L and a pH of 7.3. The 

relatively low outflow temperatures suggest that these Na-HCO3-

CO2 cold waters represent infiltrating meteoric waters with deep 

circulation paths (at least 200 m deep), mineralized by water–

gas–rock interaction processes. According to Vieira da Silva (oral 

communication), technical director of this water, the absence of 

tritium in samples of the Carvalhelhos water collected in 1996, 

means that infiltration of meteoric water occurred more than 44 

years before that date. Carbon isotopes analysis were 

inconclusive concerning dating of this water, since it is suspected 

that there is a deep mantle CO2 contribution to its final 

composition. 

The Sr isotopic ratios for the Carvalhelhos water (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 

0.726255 - 0.726485), though more radiogenic than rainwater 

(Fig. 4), do not lie within the range of present-day values 

reported by Saraiva et al. (2007) for samples of the host granite 

(
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.749238) and the Silurian formations (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 

0.760103 - 0.782684) (Tab. 3), indicating that the bulk 

equilibrium between rocks and fluids was not attained. In granitic 

and metamorphic environments, the isotopic exchange between 

rocks and fluids is highly dependent on the relative leaching 

stabilities of the different silicate phases (plagioclase feldspar 

dissolves first than biotite, K-feldspar or muscovite), which may 

therefore lead to some decoupling of their Sr isotopic 

compositions (Stettler and Allégre, 1978; Lasaga, 1984, Marques 

et al., 2006). As, on the other hand, the most easily weathered 

silicate mineral is plagioclase feldspar, which is Sr-enriched and 

far less radiogenic than K-feldspar or micas (Tab. 3), it is likely 

that the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios of the Carvalhelhos mineral waters have 

been essentially controlled by the dissolution of Na-feldspar, as 

proposed by Saraiva (2006) and Saraiva et al. (2007). The high 

degree of overlap between the Sr isotopic ratios of the 

Carvalhelhos water and the results obtained by Brough (1990) in 

plagioclases from similar granitoids (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.716873 - 

0.736393) supports this assumption.  

The samples of the Fastio and Serra da Estrela bottled 

mineral waters can be clearly distinguished from the 

Carvalhelhos water by their lower concentrations of dissolved 

solids (&amp;lt;52 mg/L), pH values (5.8 - 6.9) and average Sr isotopic 

ratios (Fastio: 0.71369, Serra da Estrela: 0.71982). Their 

physico-chemical characteristics and Sr isotopic compositions 

point to shallower groundwater circulation paths, shorter 

residence times and less effective fluid-rock (fluid-plagioclase) 

interaction mechanisms. It should be noted, however, that the 

aquifer source rocks are in both cases late-post-D3 Variscan 

granitoids with younger ages, lower Rb/Sr ratios and less 

radiogenic Sr isotopic signatures than the S-type granite hosting 

the Carvalhelhos water. 

The Gouveia Massif (Serra da Estrela water) displays a U-Pb 

zircon age of 301 ? 2.6 Ma and a Sr isotopic ratio of 0.74421 

(Neiva et al., 2009), whereas the Agrela Massif (Fastio water) is 

306 ? 3.5 Ma old and shows present-day 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios ranging 

from 0.720803 to 0.732505 (Dias et al., 1998; 2002). A 

comparison of water and whole-rock isotope ratios is of little 

relevance, because full isotope equilibrium with the surrounding 

country rocks is rarely achieved (Négrel et al., 2001; Shand et al., 

2009). Nevertheless, differences in the age and nature of granite 

reservoirs will have strong effects on the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios of their 

silicate minerals, being therefore possible that the Sr isotopic 

variability recorded in the three types of granite waters analysed 

in this study reflects contrasts in the exchange rates and 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

compositions of the plagioclase with which they have interacted, 

as also demonstrated by Marques et al. (2012). 

Ordovician quartzites – “Luso”, “Ladeira de Envendos”, 

“Castelo de Vide” mineral waters. 

The natural mineral waters of Luso, Ladeira de Envendos and 

Castelo de Vide are low mineralised water types (Tab. 2), derived 

from infiltration of meteoric water along a highly fractured 



Sr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 35 

 

bedrock, consisting mainly of quartzites of Lower Ordovician age 

(Arenigian). The Ordovician sequences are exposed in the core of 

a series of NW-SE trending synclines, formed during the first 

Variscan deformation event (Buçaco, Envendos-Pinhal and 

Castelo de Vide synclines, respectively). 

In a geological environment dominated by quartz-rich 

lithologies with little or no Sr-bearing minerals, a close match 

between the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios of groundwater and rainfall should be 

expected. However, the average Sr isotopic compositions of the 

three mineral water samples (Luso:
 

0.71525; Ladeira de 

Envendos: 0.71700; Castelo de Vide: 0.77701) are distinctly 

more radiogenic than rainwater (Fig. 4), suggesting that the 

isotopic composition of the recharge waters was substantially 

modified by the input of easily accessible Sr with high 
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

ratios from external sources.  

For the Luso and Ladeira de Envendos hydrologic systems, 

the increase in the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios relative to rainwater may have 

resulted from chemical weathering of silicate minerals present 

either in arkosic / pelitic intercalations within the Arenigian 

quartzite succession or in the underlying red bed and 

conglomerate deposits of presumed Tremadocian age (Teixeira, 

1981; Oliveira et al., 1992). These low-grade metasedimentary 

rocks contain, in addition to quartz, variable amounts of feldspar 

and phylossilicates (muscovite and chlorite) and may thus have 

supplied radiogenic Sr to groundwater. 

The Luso and Ladeira de Envendos mineral waters flow 

through deep-seated fractures (&gt; 100 m) and discharge with 

moderate temperatures (Luso: 27 ºC; Envendos: 22 ºC), pH 

ranging from 4.8 to 5.7 and very low mineralization contents 

(Tab. 2). Under these conditions, partial equilibrium between 

silicic rocks and fluids could have occurred and Sr may have 

been progressively released to the solution from the primary 

reacting minerals (feldspar, muscovite, chlorite) and neo-formed 

clay minerals, promoting the elevation of the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios in 

the waters. Their overall chemistry and relatively high silica 

concentrations are consistent with a chemical evolution primarily 

controlled by water-rock interaction processes involving acidic 

weathering of aluminosilicates. In the case of the Serra do 

Buçaco aquifers (Luso region), Vieira da Silva et al. (2000) 

showed that there is a direct correlation between discharge 

temperature, silica content, maximum depth of circulation and 

tritium content (residence time). 

As first pointed out by Voerkelius et al. (2010), the Castelo 

de Vide mineral water exhibits anomalously high 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios 

(0.776543 - 0.777268). The water is sourced from an Ordovician 

aquifer system (the “Castelo de Vide” syncline) showing the 

same broad stratigraphic units that the Luso and Ladeira de 

Envendos synclines. However, the Ordovician sequences of the 

Castelo de Vide syncline are in contact with strongly deformed 

pre-Variscan granitoids (Portalegre orthogneisses), related to an 

old episode of magmatic activity (493 ± 3.5 Ma; Solá, 2007). In 

keeping with their old age and extreme differentiated character, 

the Portalegre orthogneisses have 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios ranging from 

0.9573 - 1.4985 (Solá, 2007). Because the Sr isotope ratios in 

granite rock forming minerals depend on the age and Rb/Sr ratio 

of the host, it may be presumed that dissolution of radiogenic 

plagioclase (and to a lesser extent, K-felspar and biotite) from the 

Portalegre orthogneisses could have provided a supplementary 

source of radiogenic Sr for the Castelo de Vide mineral water. 

5. Conclusions 

Based on the results obtained for nine samples of bottled mineral 

waters from Portuguese mainland, it is possible do draw the 

following conclusions: 

(a) each of the analysed water samples exhibits a distinctive 

Sr isotope signature that does not change significantly with time 

and can therefore be used for purposes of mineral water 

authentication; 

(b) the Sr isotope ratios of the analysed waters are 

dominantly controlled by both the nature and stratigraphic age of 

the aquifer host rocks. The least radiogenic waters are related to 

Jurassic carbonates / evaporites (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.70808) and Late 

Cretaceous alkaline igneous sources (
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.70447), 

whereas the Cenozoic siliciclastic sediments host waters with 
87

Sr/
86

Sr values of 0.71078 and the waters coming from granitic 

and/or metamorphic terrains of the Iberian Variscan basement 

display highly radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions (
87

Sr/
86

Sr 

varying between 0.7136 and 0.7770); 

(c) fluid-rock and fluid-mineral interaction processes 

involving lithologies composed by easily soluble minerals 

(calcite/dolomite, anhydrite/gypsum and halite) promote bulk 

isotope equilibrium between groundwater and parent rock 

(Vimeiro water). For water reservoirs interacting with silicate 

rocks, isotopic equilibrium with the whole-rock is rarely achieved 

due to the variable reactivity rates of their mineral constituents 

(Carvalhelhos, Fastio, Serra da Estrela, Castelo de Vide, Luso, 

Ladeira de Envendos waters) and can only be approached by 

long-term fluid-rock interaction mechanisms at high temperatures 

(Monchique water); 

(d) in non-carbonate environments, the input of radiogenic Sr 

to the water is a function of the stability, age and Rb/Sr ratios of 

the aquifer bedrock silicate minerals and appears to be mainly 

provided by the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspar and, to a lesser 

extent, primary phylossilicates or neo-formed clay minerals. 

Finally, the presence of significant differences in the Sr 

isotope composition of the Portuguese bottled mineral waters 

provides a powerful tool for fingerprinting their origin and to 

trace the hydrogeochemical processes operating along water flow 

paths.
