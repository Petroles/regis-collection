Abstract 

Environmental concerns coupled with the increasingly importance of the 

alternative energies in the world economy are moving the energy consumption from oil, 

towards more environmental friendly sources. Whereas it is commonly known that, an 

increase oil price has a good financial impact on alternative energy stock prices, the 

works that analyzes the alternative energy risk factors are scarce. 

 This thesis analyzes the risk factors of investing in alternative energies, using 

for this purpose, a four variable regression where the factors are oil prices, technology 

stock prices, S&amp;amp;P 500 and interest rates.   Due to their growing importance in markets, 

it is of interest of investors, managers and policy makers to know the risks of this kind 

of investments. The correlation matrix show that clean energy companies are more 

influenced by technology companies returns than with oil prices movements. The 

regression analysis show that oil prices, technology stock prices, risk free rate and the 

S&amp;amp;P 500 have some relative strength in explaining clean energy stock price movements. 

In addition, it also demonstrates that technology stock price movements are more 

important to explain alternative energy stock price movements than oil price movements 

because investors may see alternative energy companies similar to technology 

companies.

Resumo 

 Preocupações ambientais juntamente com a crescente importância das energias 

alternativas na economia mundial estão a mudar os hábitos de consumo energéticos do 

petróleo, em direção a fontes mais ecológicas. Enquanto é conhecido que, um aumento 

no preço do petróleo tem um impacto financeiro positivo no preço das ações das 

energias alternativas, os trabalhos que analisam os fatores de risco das energias 

alternativas são escassos. 

 Esta tese analisa os fatores de risco de investir em energias alternativas, usando 

para este propósito, uma regressão com quatro variáveis onde os fatores de risco são 

preços do petróleo, preços de ações de empresas tecnológicas, S&amp;amp;P 500 e taxas de juro. 

Devido à sua crescente importância nos mercados, é portanto do interesse dos 

investidores, empresários e políticos saber quais os riscos deste tipo de investimentos. A 

matriz de correlação indica que as empresas de energias alternativas são mais 

influenciadas pelo retorno de empresas tecnológicas do que pelas alterações dos preços 

do petróleo. A análise da regressão estatística demonstra que os preços do petróleo, as 

cotações das ações das empresas de tecnologia, as taxas de juro e o S&amp;amp;P 500 tem algum 

poder relativo na explicação das alterações das cotações das ações das empresas de 

energia alternativa. A regressão mostra ainda que, as alterações do preço das ações das 

empresas tecnológicas têm maior importância na explicação dos movimentos dos preços 

das ações das empresas de energia alternativa do que as oscilações do preço do petróleo, 

devido à forma como os investidores poderão ver as empresas de energia alternativa 

semelhantes às empresas tecnológicas.

1. Introduction 
 

“The Administration is committed to a comprehensive energy strategy that 

supports economic and job growth, bolsters energy security, positions the US to lead 

the world in clean energy, and addresses the global challenge of climate change” 

Economic Report of the President (2013). 

The importance of alternative energies is expected to continue to increase in the 

coming years, due mainly to environmental concerns and energy security issues. 

Therefore, the importance of this sector in the global economy is expected to grow and 

more firms have been appearing along the years. Thus it is of interest of investors to 

know the risks of investing in alternative energy firms. 

 The aim of this thesis is to analyze the risk factors of 

alternative energy stocks, being oil prices, technology stock prices and interest rates the 

major risk factors. Oil price movements help to explain alternative energy stock 

movements because it is, first of all, an important substitute where rising oil prices 

increase alternative energy demand (Henriques and Sadorski, 2008). Furthermore, the 

same paper suggest that stock prices of alternative energy companies are more 

influenced by shocks in technology stock prices than by oil prices movements. Kumar  

et al. (2012) extend Henriques and Sadorsky (2008), and state that investors see clean 

energy firms as technology firms, although Managi (2013) results, contradict it. He 

shows that after structural breaks, there is a positive relationship between oil prices and 

clean energy prices, which reveal a different view, whereas Henriques and Sadorsky 

(2008) and Kumar et al. (2012) show that alternative energy companies are more 

influenced by shocks in technology stock prices than oil price movements and that 

alternative energy firms are seen by investors as technology firms, Managi (2013) states 

that before structural breaks the results are consistent with them, however, after 

structural breaks there is a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy 

prices. 

The purpose of this paper is, thus, to shed some light on this issue in order to 

know the risks of this kind of investments.

To better understand the aforementioned relations, it is fundamental to begin this 

study by analyzing the energy consumption worldwide. 

Oil is the major driver of the world economy, it affects all industries thus every 

activity relies on it and it is as well, the most traded commodity, as it can be seen in 

Figure 1. Crude oil alone accounts for 15%, which represents the commodity with the 

greatest importance, followed by Gold (11.5%), Natural Gas (9.4%) and Copper (7.5%). 

In the other hand, Nickel (2.0%), Lean Hogs (1.9%) and Cotton (1.6%) are the ones 

with the smallest relevance when comparing with the other commodities. The US is the 

biggest crude oil importer according to Key World Energy Statistics (2013). 

 

Figure 1 – Dow Jones UBS commodity Index Composition 

 

The World oil demand in 2013 represents a growth of 1% or 0.82 mb/d  

compared to the previous year and forecasts for 2014 indicate that it is expected to 

increase by 1 mb/d or 1.2%. However, the OECD consumption is expected to continue 

to decline at rate of 0.2 mb/d (OPEC October 2013). On the other hand, compared to the 

global spectrum of the energy, as Figure 2 demonstrates, oil consumption has been

decreasing, which represents a change towards alternative energies. Analyzing the year 

of 1973 and 2011 in regard to the world consumption, we can see a positive evolution in 

the alternative energies it evolves from 1.6% in 1973 to 3.4% in 2011 and a decrease in 

oil from 48.1% to 40.8%, respectively, despite the fact that in global terms the energy 

consumption has increased from 4674 to 8918 Mtoe in 2011 (Key World Energy 

Statistics 2013).  

Figure 2 – Total Energy Consumption from 1973 to 2011 

Source : Key World Energy Statistics 

Regarding the commercial stock movements, results for August 2013 show that 

OECD commercial oil stocks decreased by 10.4 mb, where it reached a 68 mb below 

the five-year average and presented a 53 mb less than the previous year. On the other 

hand, the results about the same period demonstrate that US commercial oil stocks 

increased by 4.5 mb and inventories stood at 2.4 mb or 0.2% above the year before and 

showed a gain of 33 mb or 3% over the five-year average (OPEC October 2013). 

While energy consumption is increasing, as it can be seen in Figure 2, it is 

crucial that other sources of energy are used, namely clean or alternative energies such 

as solar, wind, geothermal, heat between others, in order to limit climate changes and so 

embrace the sustainable development.  In the US, several policies and measures have 

been implemented such as market-based solution to climate change, which provide 

economic incentives to those who pollute less, so that the cost of polluting reflects the 

economic harm caused to others. Cap-and-trade system and Clean Energy Standard are

examples of market-based solutions presented in the Economic Report of the President 

(2013).  

According to IPCC 2013, human influence on the climate is clear, raising 

greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, forcing positive radioactive and 

global warming. In addition, the report also states that in order to limit the climate 

changes it would be necessary to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, because the 

continued emissions will cause further warming and changes to the climate system. So, 

it is fundamental not only, to further develop the alternative energies, but as well to 

reduce the human footprint on the environment, in order to build a greener society.  

After motivating this topic and explaining what issues are expected to be 

covered it is time to do a brief overview over the sample period about what happened in 

the world economy but more precisely in the US, followed by market analysis, review 

literature, data and empirical analysis. The final chapter of the thesis presents the major 

conclusions.

2. Overview of the sample period- The new century 
 

This chapter of the thesis intends to study some of the events of the sample period, 

from the year of 2001 until 2013, subdivided in three sub periods, which happened in 

the US, in order to examine the relationships among the variables under the scope of 

this paper. 

 

Figure 3 provides a good picture regarding the way on these assets have developed 

since the beginning of 2001 until 2013. As the graphic illustrates, Crude Oil (West 

Texas Intermediate) is the green line and the Clean Energy Index is represented by 

WilderHill in orange. As it can be seen in 2001/2002 the Clean Energy Index suffered a 

great loss, whereas Crude Oil did not present a big variation, afterwards, both assets 

maintained a constant grow, prior to the global financial crisis, even reaching both 

assets peaking values, considering this sample period, suffering after it major hits. 

Following the losses caused by the crisis in 2007/2008 in the darker area, both assets 

kept constant values until the crude oil passes the clean energy index reverting the initial 

situation, until current days. In Figure 3 it seems that both assets follow a similar path, 

before the financial crisis and although the oil price had reached higher values after 

WilderHill, it appears that it suffered in the same way as clean energies. Contrasting 

with clean energies, which had decreased even more, the price of oil started to recover 

in 2009.

2.1 2001-2002 - The end of the recession and the terrorist 

attacks 
 

The subperiod among 2001-2002 had two major events that caused a significant 

decline in financial markets, two distinct situations that combined aggravate even more 

the recession that was already in place. The so-called Dot-com bubble and the Terrorist 

attacks of 9/11. 

In order to analyze this subperiod is necessary to go a couple of years back. In 

the year of 1999, there was an economic boom regarding technology companies, namely 

computer and software sales, induced by the Y2K fright, the bug of the millennium. In 

order to prevent this issue, many companies and individuals bought new software 

systems, which induced the stock prices of high technology companies to increase. As a 

result, a lot of investors invested in high technology companies, whether they are 

profitable or not. 

In 2000, as companies and individuals had bought all the necessary computer 

equipment, computer orders had declined which led ultimately to a stock-market sell-

off. As stock prices declined many high technology companies went bankrupt
1
.As a 

consequence, the Nasdaq Composite, where most high technology company stocks are 

traded, lost 78% (percentage lost from peak to bottom) of its value as it fell from 

5046.86 to 1114.11
2
. As it can be seen in the Figure 4, the Nasdaq suffered a great 

evolution, from less than 1000 points in 1995 to its highest value in 2000 of more than 

4500 points. After it, the bubble burst and then, Nasdaq decreased to a little more than 

1000 points in 2002. From 2002 until 2009, Nasdaq was having a constant growth when 

in 2008, with the global financial crisis as it is better explained afterwards, decreased 

again from 2500 to 1500 points.

Regarding the terrorist attacks, which happened on 11th of September of 2001, 

they had several implications, both short and long-term economic impacts, which led 

the Dow Jones to decrease more than 600 points, the 2001 recession to aggravate and 

had initiated the War on Terrorism. As stated before, the terrorist attacks worsened the 

2001 recession, the economy had contracted in the first quarter and however the second 

quarter had described an economy growth, the attacks had extended the recession with a 

new economy contraction
3
. 

Furthermore, one of the measures undertaken was to kept NYSE and the Nasdaq 

closed until the 17
th

 of September to try to avoid panic selling and a huge loss in the 

markets, it was the longest shutdown since 1933. On the first trading day of NYSE after 

9/11, it set a record for the great loss in one day in exchange history, the market fell 684 

points, which represented a 7.1% loss. By the end of that week, with the biggest losses 

in NYSE history, the Dow Jones had felt for almost of 1370 points, which translates in a 

loss over 14%. Regarding the other US index, the S&amp;amp;P lost 11.6%, a $1.4 trillion in 

value in a week. The most affected sectors were the airlines and insurance companies 

where American Airlines and United Airlines suffered the hardest hit, the first one 

dropped from a $29.70 per share on September 11
th
 to $18.00 per share September 17th,

a 39% decline, whereas the latter dropped from $30.82 to $17.50 representing a 42% 

decrease. Considering the financial services, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley 

suffered the greatest losses, 11.5% and 13%, respectively. 

In the other hand, there were some sectors which increased value, for instance, 

some technology, defense, weaponry, communications and pharmaceutical companies 

saw share prices grow due to an increase in government business as the country 

prepared for war
4
. 

According to Kliesen, the 2001 recession and its recovery was unique in some 

aspects. Firstly, it had a relatively short duration, when compared to other recessions. 

Secondly, in a usual recession, the spending on durable goods and real estate decrease, 

but this was not the situation, it kept increasing during the recession.  

After covered the period among 2001-2002 it is time to study what happened 

between the following subsample period, 2003-2007.

2.2 2003-2007 – Sub-prime crisis and the housing market 

bubble 
 

Following the technology bubble and the events happened on 11
th
 September of 

2001, the Fed, in the US, cut the interest rates to an extremely low level, in order to 

stimulate the economy. This measure was the beginning, ironically, to a new crisis. 

People who usually could not afford loans, because of the poor credit rating, were able 

to access it through the sub-prime lending, when non-traditional mortgages were 

created, interest-only loans and mortgages with extended amortization periods, for 

example. Interest rates ended up climbed back up and many borrowers defaulted when 

their mortgages were reset to much higher monthly payments. This left mortgage 

lenders with property that was worth less than the loan value due to a weakening 

housing market. Defaults increased; the problem snowballed, and several lenders went 

bankrupt
5
. 

The consequences regarding the financial markets were originated mostly due to a 

fundamental change in the way mortgages markets work. Normally, banks financed 

their mortgage lending with deposits received from customers, which had limited the 

amount of lending they could do. However, the change made to the traditional model 

allowed banks to fund additional borrowing in a much easier way: they sold the 

mortgages to the bond markets which led to abuses as banks no longer have the 

incentive to check carefully the mortgages they issue
6
. In other words, lenders sold 

mortgages they originated into the secondary market, where they were sold together as 

CDOs and other MBSs. 

In the year of 2005, sub-prime lending had spread across America. By then, one of 

five mortgages were sub-prime, they were particularly popular among recent 

immigrants, or in other terms, families that did not qualify for ordinary home loans who 

were looking for a home for the first time in the US and because of the high prices it 

was difficult to buy one without moving to the suburbs. The evolution between the 2003 

and 2006 of below-investment MBSs is shown in the Table 1 and as it can be seen, the 

subprime lending was the one with the bigger increase, from 37.4 (34% ) in 2003 to

114.3 Million Dollars (44%). The main problem with the sub-prime mortgages was the 

payments, which were fixed for two years and then become dependent on the level of 

Fed interest rates, which many of them increased in the next two years, leading to a 

much higher rate of repossession by the banks than other mortgages. Furthermore, the 

many repossessions made by banks had one major impact, the reverse evolution of 

houses prices, which force the property owners to lower the prices, in order to try to sell 

the remain properties, or in other terms, the repossessions caused the first house prices 

decline since the decade of 30s

As a conclusion of this sub-sample period, during the sharp growth of the sub-prime 

market among 2001 and 2006, the quality of loans had become worse and the 

underwriting criteria wider; the fact that house prices had appreciated between 2003 and 

2005 disguised the real risk of sub-prime mortgages which was underestimated by 

rating agencies and finally the unsustainable growth of the sub-prime market led to its 

collapse (Demyanyk and Van Hemert 2009).  

The sub-prime crisis, as well as the housing prices crash or downturn, had several 

implications on the global financial crisis as it is explained hereafter.

2.3 2008-2013 – Global Financial Crisis up to today 
 

The time period from 2008 to 2013, represents a global financial crisis that is so far, 

the worst crisis since the great depression of 1930s. This crisis had several 

consequences such as, the deterioration of most financial markets around the world, 

contributed to a potential collapse of major financial institutions worldwide and it 

involved national governments in bailing out too?big?to?fail banks (SIFIs). During this 

time period more was affected besides financial markets and its institutions, in 

particular, the house market and real estate prices at a global level, the unemployment 

and the long-term unemployment rates increased, the consumer wealth and its 

expenditures decreased over this period and ultimately, this crisis contributed to the 

European sovereign-debt crisis (Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Global 

Financial Crisis by Vodenska, Boston University). 

In Figure 5 are represented the evolution of five variables, Crude Oil, WilderHill, 

Arca Tech 100, 3 month Treasury Bill Interest Rate, S&amp;amp;P 500 from 2008 to 2013. In 

this Figure it can be seen when the global financial crisis took place (the darker grey in 

the Figure), all variables suffered a loss, being the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Arca Tech 100 the 

ones that suffered the major losses. After it in the following years, the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the 

Arca Tech 100 had a great recovery ended in the 2013 with superior values than the 

ones when the crisis hit, whilst the Crude Oil, the WilderHill and the 3 month Treasury 

Bill Interest Rate kept constant values after the crisis, being the 3 month interest rate the 

one with the lowest values during the entire subperiod. According to some papers, 

namely Managi (2013),he shows that after structural breaks, the financial crisis, there is 

a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices, which is what can be 

seen in Figure 5, where both have approximately the same values.

Evolution from 2008 to 2013

The financial crisis of 2008 can be defined as the worst recession since the great 

depression of 1929, where house prices fell 31.8% and unemployment continue to be 

above the rate of 9% two years after the recession
8
.  

The first evidence that was something wrong with the economy appeared in 2006, 

when the house prices started to downturn, as mentioned before. In addition, there was a 

chain of reactions, after the house market downturn, in the financial system. 

Furthermore, the financial instruments supposedly without risk turn out to be worthless, 

namely MBSs and CDOs even with the approval of the rating agencies
9
. 

According to Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis by 

Vodenska, Boston University, the number of failed banks in the US between 2000 and 

2013 was 497, 27 from the year of 2000 to 2007 and 470 from 2008 until 2013, which 

can reveal what happened to the financial system during the last years. In addition, 

Vodenska also states several reasons for Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, namely, the high 

level of leverage, which increased from 2003 to 2008, the heavy investments made in 

the real estate market and the large positions taken in the sub-prime market as well as

other lower-rated mortgages, which ended up with Lehman Brothers declaring 

bankruptcy on September 2013. 

According to the article The origins of the financial crisis by The Economist, one of 

the most dramatic errors made during the crisis was to let Lehman Brothers to go 

bankrupt, which had multiplied the panic in the markets leading to a real problem in the 

economy, where non-financial companies were unable to borrow money from banks, 

thus making the companies powerless to fulfill its payment obligations, namely to 

suppliers or even workers. 

In 2008 the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US lost 33.8% of its value and by 

the end of the year, since the economic systems had become more globally 

interconnected, the recession had spread to most of the World
10

. The situation 

deteriorated during the summer of 2008, where the Treasury Department was allowed to 

spent up to $150 billion to subsidize and eventually take over Fannie Mae and Freddie 

Mac, the two most important mortgage companies, and regarding the AIG (American 

International Group), an insurance company that faced its most delicate financial 

situation in 2008, due to the sold credit protection that ultimately had decrease in value, 

the Fed used $150 billion to bail it out.  

On September, because of the lack of trust on other financial instruments, 

businesses moved record $140 billion into even safer Treasury bonds. Meanwhile, the 

Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson along with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, proposed a 

proposed a $700 billion bailout package, although only $350 billion was used in 2008 to 

buy bank and automotive company stocks, in order to try to stimulate these industries. 

One of the measures done by the Treasury Secretary in order to establish and manage of 

a treasury fund, TARP, that was created in October 2008, which objectives were to 

bought stocks in eight banks: Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, 

Morgan Stanley, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and State 

Street. Moreover, TARP funds were used to buy other company stocks namely: AIG 

($40 billion), Community banks ($92 billion), Big 3 auto companies ($24.8 billion), 

Citigroup and Bank of America ($45 billion)
11

. In the year of 2010, banks had already

paid back $194 of the TARP fund. The remaining money, reserved for the President 

Obama was never used, in other way he created the economic stimulus package ($787 

billion), which was approved by the congress in 2009
12

. 

The main objective of the economic stimulus package was to quickly begin the 

economic growth, save between 900,000 to 2.3 million jobs, to ensure the needed 

confidence to restore the economic growth and it has as an objective to restore the trust 

in the financial industry. The stimulus package was a success, in March 2009, before it 

was launched, the GDP in the first quarter (Q1) was -5.4% and the Dow had decreased 

to 6,594.44 on March 5, 2009. By the last quarter of 2009, the GDP was up to 3.9% and 

the Dow had risen to 10,428. However, not all success can be assigned to the stimulus 

package, since there were other important issues such as the expansive monetary policy 

and the emerging markets which both had contributed to stimulate the economy, 

although the last two were already set in the beginning of 2009, so one can conclude 

that at least the President Obama’s stimulus package gave the investors and markets the 

confidence needed to turn the economy round
13

. 

In order to show what happened regarding the US GDP during the sample analysis 

(2001-2013), is shown in Figure 6 the evolution since the beginning of the 21
st
 century. 

As one can see, in 2000 the GDP was a little bit above the 4% where it suffered a great 

decrease reaching the value of 1%, which can be explained by the technology bubble as 

well as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Following the before mention events, the Fed, cut the 

interest rates to an extremely low level, in order to stimulate the economy, which can 

explain the positive variation in the GDP, between 2001 and 2004, where it reached 

almost 4%. Furthermore, this period roughly coincides with the sharp growth of the sub-

prime market among 2001 and 2006, where the quality of loans had become worse and 

the underwriting criteria wider and the fact that house prices had appreciated between 

2003 and 2005 disguised the real risk of sub-prime mortgages which was 

underestimated by rating agencies and finally the unsustainable growth of the sub-prime 

market led to its collapse in 2008 where the GDP almost reached -3%. The time period 

between 2008 and 2013, represent a global financial crisis that is so far, the worst crisis 

since the great depression of 1930s. According to the World Bank, the US GDP in 2012

2.4 Brief Forecast on Following Years 
 

Following the explanation about what happen in the world during the thesis’s 

sample period, it is time to make a relatively short forecast on the years to come about, 

mostly, the economy growth. 

In accordance with CNBC, the Japanese investment bank Nomura have stated that 

the global financial crisis have ended in 2013 and 2014 is the recovery year. As 

evidence for this, the bank's equity research team led by Michael Kurtz identified some 

economic indicators that have been improving such as the US real estate market and the 

Europe’s economic expansion, among others
14

. 

In agreement with Nomura is IMF, that stated that during the second part of 2013, 

after a slow start in the beginning of the year, the global activity have been strengthened 

and it is expected to continue to increase even further in 2014 and 2015, mostly due to 

the recovery in the advanced economies. The growth at a global level is expected to be 

higher in 2014, with 3.7%, increasing to 3.9% in the next year
15

. 

Similarly, the White House is in line with the last two points of view. According to 

Reuters, under its projection, US economy is going to surpass in 2014 the last year’s 

growth of 1.7% with 3.1%, while the forecast for 2015 is similar, it is going to 

overcome 2014’s with 3.4%. Moreover, the White House gave some reasons for the 

aforementioned growth: the decline of budget deficit, the improving house market and 

US energy production, decrease in health costs and advances in technology were some 

of the economic drivers pointed out by the White House
16

. 

In accordance with Bloomberg, S&amp;amp;P 500 Index rose 30% last year for the highest 

increase since 1997, whereas house prices increased in October, comparing with the 

homologous year, for the biggest increment for more than seven years
17

.

As it has been shown, the outlook for 2014 and 2015 is better than before, which 

means that the economic indicators are still going to increase and improve. Bill Conerly 

is in line with that thought, he states that in the demand side, consumer spending is 

going to increase and housing construction is going to grow. One of the most important 

facts is the growth of oil and gas production, petroleum accounted for 77% of 2012 

imports, which is declining due to the increasing energy production. The Real GDP 

Growth is presented in the Figure 7. As it can be seen, in 2013 the GDP growth was 

inferior to 2012, however in 2014 the 3.3% change as well as the 4.1% in 2015 reveals 

that the crisis ended in 2013 and 2014 is the recovery year, suggesting that the global 

financial crisis has finally ended
18

. 

 

Have ended the analysis on the sample period, as done a brief forecast on the 

following years as well as given some reasons/drivers for the economic growth 

projections, it is presented afterwards a market analysis about the alternative energies 

and the oil prices, so it could be better understood some of their different characteristics.

3. Market Analysis 
 

In order to study the relationships among the alternative energies and the oil prices it 

is better to understand firstly some of their different characteristics, some aspects that 

could affect prices, evolution taking in consideration the last decade and even some 

forecasts in what respects their consumption. 

3.1 Oil 
 

Brief Introduction 

The oil is the major driver of the world economy as well as the most traded 

commodity, it affects every industry and so every activity relies on it. Nowadays the US 

is the biggest crude oil importer according to Key World Energy Statistics (2013). 

According to US Environmental Protection Agency, in the US, crude oil is mainly 

used for transportation and heating purposes, however a small percentage is used as fuel 

for electricity generating plants
19

.  

One of its characteristics is that crude oil come in many varieties as well as 

qualities, that is, its features, namely the specific gravity and sulfur content, depends on 

the place where it was extracted from as it is priced
20

. This is represented in the Figure 

8. The crude oil market value depends especially on these two features and so, the 

density ranges from light to heavy while sulfur content is whether sweet or sour. A 

sweet crude oil is characterized by its sulfur content which is less than 0.5%, while oil 

with more than 0.5% is defined as sour.

20

 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/904748.stm

19 
 

 The figure 8 represents, the different crude oil characteristics regarding the place 

where it was extracted from, for instance the Mexico-Maya is the one with the highest 

sour percentage and the one with the highest density, and so it is the one with the higher 

heavy and sour results. In contrast, Algeria-Sahara Blend and Malaysia-Tapis are the 

ones with higher sweet and light values and this is the reason why the Algeria-Sahara 

Blend, as well as Malaysia-Tapis are priced higher than the Mexico-Maya crude oil, as 

it is explained below.  

According to EIA, crude oils are priced differently considering its characteristics, 

namely, the crude oils with “light (higher degrees of API gravity, or lower density)” and 

sweet, with low sulfur content are normally priced higher than heavy, sour crude oil. 

This is mainly due to the fact that gasoline and diesel fuel are sold at a premium, rather 

than residual fuel and others that are usually more easily and cheaply produced using 

light, sweet crude oil. Basically, the ones that can be got with more rudimentary 

processes as well as with less energy-consuming refineries are the desirable ones, thus 

the light sweet grades are the most desirable crude oils

Figure 9 – Crude Oil, OPEC Oil Basket and Non-OPEC Crude Oil Total Prod Evolution 

from 2001 to 2013 

 

 Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream 

The Figure 9 illustrates Crude Oil (West Texas Intermediate) and OPEC Oil Basket 

prices as well as Non-OPEC Crude Oil Total Production from 2001 to 2013. In the 

beginning of this period, coinciding with the recession, all variables suffered a loss, 

being the Non-OPEC oil production the one that suffered the most. After it and until the 

global financial crisis, the Non-OPEC oil production had a sharp growth, while the 

other variables kept a constant growth with similar values. However, when the crisis 

took place, all variables had a big loss in their values, where Crude Oil and OPEC Oil 

Basket suffered the major hit. Following this period, all variables recovered and the 

Crude Oil and OPEC Oil had different growths, where the OPEC Oil registered, 

occasionally, higher values than Crude Oil. 

The need to price crude oil in terms of a benchmark comes from the fact that there 

are many different qualities of crude oil, so, buyers and sellers found it easier to have 

benchmarks, thus other varieties are priced at a discount or premium according to their 

quality. There are some benchmarks worldwide, such as, Brent, Dubai, OPEC and West 

Texas Intermediate. Regarding the Brent benchmark, it is usually accepted as the world 

benchmark and according to EIA it prices two thirds of the world’s traded crude oil. In 

what respects the Dubai benchmark, it is used to price sales of other regional crudes into 

Asia, simply because it is one of the few Gulf crudes available in single, on the spot, 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

21 
 

sales as opposed to long term supply contracts. In what regards the US benchmark, the 

crude oil is priced in relation to West Texas Intermediate. Regarding the OPEC basket, 

this organization is currently constituted by 12 countries namely, Algeria, Angola, 

Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates 

and Venezuela
22

. The OPEC benchmark price is determined by the average of all of its 

12 countries and one of its objectives is to control the amount of oil they supply to the 

market in order to keep the price between a predetermined range prices
23

. In addition, 

81% of the world’s oil reserves belong to OPEC which is represented in figure 4
24

, 

which give a great amount of diplomatic leverage in worldwide businesses, due to its 

importance. The countries with highest crude oil reserves, as it can be seen in Figure 10, 

are Venezuela with 24.8%, Saudi Arabia with 22.1% and Iran with 13.1% of total 

reserves and in the other hand the OPEC countries with fewer crude oil reserves are 

Algeria 1%, Angola 0.8% and Ecuador with 0.7% of total reserves. Moreover, one issue 

coupled with OPEC is that most of its countries are located in geopolitical stressed 

regions of the world, which create a security matter for large consumption nations 

(Henriques and Sadorski 2008).

Crude oil is priced according to its characteristics which make some crude oils more 

expensive than others, however as Figure 11 presents, they tend to move together.  

Figure 11 – World Crude Oil Prices 

 

Source :  http://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/spot_prices.cfm 

 Figure 11 presents the crude oil spot prices from 2001 to 2014 and as it is 

shown, the different crude oils tend to move together, even when crude oils are 

significantly different between them: crude oil types, light-weight, low sulfur grades 

and heavier-sulfur crudes that have lower quality as it was explained before. From 2001 

to 2008 all crude oils saw their price increase and after the 2008 financial crisis all of 

them suffered a big loss, which recovered after it. Although there are many types of 

crude oil around the world due to their characteristics, the prices are different as well, 

but because oil prices are globally integrated, they tend to move together. 

Have exposed the main characteristics, benchmarks, places where crude oil is 

got from and different crude oil prices evolution during the sample period it is explained 

afterwards the characteristics of RE.

3.2 Renewable Energy 
 

 According to IEA, RE can be defined as energy that is derived from natural 

processes such as sunlight or wind and is restored faster that it is consumed, for 

instance, solar, wind, geothermal and hydro are usual sources of RE. In 2009, 13.1% of 

primary energy supply came from renewable sources. In addition, 19.5% of global 

energy generation, or in other terms, renewable energies are mostly used for generating 

electricity and 3% of global energy consumption for road transport belongs as well to 

RE. 

In 2011 and 2012, in spite of the global financial crisis, policy uncertainty and 

decreasing support in some markets, the demand for renewable energies continued to 

increase (REN21). 

Regarding the RE evolution since the year of 2000, Table 2 presents it considering 

Wind Power, Solar and Biofuel and presenting in the last column, the evolution between 

2000 and 2010 in the case of Biofuel or 2011 considering Wind Power and Solar. 

Table 2 – Renewable Energies evolution over the last decade 

Renewable Energy 2000 2010/2011 Evolution 

Wind Power 220 GW 238 GW 8.2% 

Solar 1.5 GW 67 GW 4366.7% 

Biofuel  16 Billion 100 Billion 525% 

Source: IEA 

Wind Power had grown 18 GW since 2000 to 2011 which represents an 

evolution of 8.2%, with an average growth rate over 25% considering the past five 

years. 

Solar energy can be directly converted into electricity using a PV cell. Analyzing 

the Table 2, it can be observed that there was an impressive growth, comparing the year 

of 2000 (1.5 GW) with 2011 (67 GW), which represents a 4366.7% growth, 

furthermore, over the past five years Solar PV had an average growth rate over 50%. 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

24 
 

Biofuel energy reached a value of more than 100 Billion liters in 2010, 

comparing with 16 Billion liters registered in 2000 represents an increase of 525%. In 

addition, Biofuel supplies 3% of the world’s fuel for transport, for instance, in Brazil it 

represents 23% of all transport fuel, while in the US it registers 4% and 3% in the EU
25

. 

In regard of the VRE, or in other terms, taking in consideration the renewable 

energies that are variable, which includes wind, solar and other renewable energies that 

fluctuate during the day or season, or which are connected to the variability of wind 

speed or solar radiation which changes during the day or year season. Coupled with this 

flexibility is the market value and price of VRE, which is affected by the amount of 

energy received by the generators, or in other words, during windy and sunny times, the 

additional amount of electricity received decreases the prices, thus because of the higher 

energy reception, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate (Hirth 

2013). However, there are measures that can be considered in order to reduce this 

variability, such as more flexible generating capacities as gas and hydro power plants, 

interconnections or storage so that it can be combined to provide the required 

flexibility
26

. 

According to World Energy Outlook, renewable energies increase their importance 

in all long-term scenarios regarding the expectation until the year of 2035, renewable 

electricity generation triples from 2009 to 2035, moreover, when considering the 

limitation of the global warming, renewable energies grow even more, it almost 

quadruples.  

As it is addressed in this thesis, the energy security is one of the major concerns in 

regard of the energy supply due to the reduction in oil supplies coupled with the 

increase of global demand as well as political insecurity in oil rich countries (Henriques 

and Sadorski, 2008). Taking this in account, it is easy to understand that energy security 

has great relevance for policy driver for RE. Furthermore, the use of RE can reduce fuel 

importation and detach the economy from fossil fuel price rises and variations, which 

would improve energy security.

25 
 

As it was covered before, the RE sector is increasing its competitiveness, wind and 

solar PV are growing at a fast pace, portfolios of RE technologies are becoming cost-

competitive, moreover, technologies such as hydro and geothermal are frequently fully 

competitive. Although, some economic barriers still remain and there is a need for costs 

to be reduced in order to achieve competitiveness
27

. 

According to IEA, there is a need for further subsidies to the RE sector, because it is 

believed that further growth is essential for a secure and sustainable energy system, in 

order to stimulate costs reduction throughout technology deployment, as improvements 

in manufacturing, technology performances and economies of scale. This issue has a 

special importance because in several countries, the policies in place are not the better, 

which led to higher than anticipated costs and excessive policy costs
28

. 

In terms of investment in RE, the global investment decreased 11% in 2013, 

according to BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance), which was the second time it 

declined since 2011. Moreover, financing must double by 2020 and double again to $1 

trillion by 2030, so that environmental targets could be achieved namely, the global 

warming of more than 2 degrees could be avoided
29

. 

According to REN21, the Global investment in renewable power and fuels was in 

2012, 244 billion USD, which represent a 12% decline, comparing with the year before. 

However, if the investments in hydropower projects larger than 50 megawatts (MW) 

and in solar power were included, in 2011 the total new investment would have reached 

a value of 285 billion USD. Furthermore, the decrease in investment, after several years 

of growth, came from uncertainty about support policies in major economies, such as 

Europe and the US, with the first decreasing 36% and the latter 35%. Although, 

disregarding replacement plants and so considering only net additions to electric 

capacity, in 2012 for the third year in a row, the global investment in renewable power 

was ahead of fossil fuels. These values regarding the evolution in investment in new 

renewable capacity and renewable power capacity (with and without hydro) between 

2010 and 2012 can be seen in the Table 3.

In addition, considering the year of 2012, it saw the most dramatic shift regarding 

the investment among developed and developing economies, whilst the investment in 

developing countries in 2011 arrived to 112 billion USD representing 46% of the world 

total, the investment in developed countries declined 29% to 132 billion USD, 

illustrating the lowest level since 2009. The major drivers regarding this reduction were 

the reductions in subsidies, the increase investor interest in emerging economies with 

attractive energy resources and decreasing costs in technology costs of wind and solar 

PV.  

Considering the top five countries regarding the annual investment in renewable 

energies, in 2012, divided by sources the US is in the top five except for Hydropower 

capacity and Solar water collector (heating) capacity, reaching the first positions in 

Wind power capacity, Biodiesel and Ethanol production as it can be seen in the Table 4. 

In addition, Europe and China combined a 60% value of global investment in 2012, 

with Solar power being the sector with more money applied, having received in 2012, 

57% of the total new investment in RE, which accounted for 96% to solar PV.

Following presenting a brief introduction on some characteristics, what drives 

their prices, the growth since the year of 2000 and even some forecasts on future 

consumption of renewable energies as well as crude oil, it is exposed in the next chapter 

the literature review where all the main literature is discussed.

4. Literature Review 
 

 In this section, it is discussed the literature with greater relevance regarding the 

topic under the scope. 

The literature on the relationship between the alternative energy stock prices and 

oil prices is scarce. Henriques and Sadorski (2008) study this topic using a vector 

autoregression model with four variables: alternative energy companies returns, 

technology stock returns, oil prices, and interest rates. Results show that the technology 

stock returns, oil prices, and interest rates are related with alternative energy companies 

returns and can explain movements on its stock price. Furthermore, they found that 

stock prices of alternative energy companies are more influenced by shocks in 

technology stock prices than by oil prices movements. 

 Sadorsky (2008) uses a study on a RE company systematic risk. This paper 

shows that increases in company sales reduce systematic risk whereas increases in oil 

price returns increase systematic risk. However, when oil price returns are positive and 

moderate, increases in company sales can offset the impact of oil prices and thus lower 

the systematic risk, although when they are higher it is in general not possible to offset 

the effects with sales growth. The Monte Carlo simulation reveals that oil prices have 

greater impact on beta than sales growth do. It also shows that market returns cause 

more effects on stock returns, followed by oil prices and then sales growth. 

Kumar et al. (2012) extends Henriques and Sadorsky (2008) work by adding the 

carbon market data from April 22
nd

 of 2005 to November 26
th

 of 2008 using Markov-

Switching VAR. This paper studied the relationship between clean energy companies, 

technology companies, oil prices, carbon prices and interest rates using for this purpose 

three indices of clean energy stocks.  This paper demonstrates that the movements of all 

three indices of clean energy stocks are explained by oil prices, technology firms stock 

prices and interest rates movements. Moreover, it shows that investors see clean energy 

firms as technology firms and also that the carbon market does not influence the clean 

energy stock prices, which might be due to the fact that the carbon price have been 

lower than the oil price and so it has not created any incentive to switch to low-carbon 

technologies.

Managi (2013) analyzed the same issue but now considering structural breaks. 

For this purpose he uses a four variable Markov-switching vector autoregressive model 

(oil prices, clean energy, technology stock prices and interest rates). The results suggest 

that after structural breaks, there are positive relationship between oil prices and clean 

energy prices, which contradicts some papers previously made. These results are 

consistent with those found by Henriques and Sadorsky (2008) before the structural 

break in 2007, however after it they are contradictory. Managi (2013) found that oil 

prices and clean energy prices have a positive relationship after structural changes. The 

paper also states that when the economy recovers, it may turn back into a non-

relationship again, among clean energy and oil prices. 

 Bohl et. Al. (2013) addresses the evolution of German RE stock returns from 

2004 to 2011. To this end, they used the four factor Carhart model which is an 

expansion of the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) and Fama French models, that 

adds the momentum (factor which is the difference between the highest 30% and the 

lowest 30% stock returns). The German government undertook several measures and 

policies in order to change to alternative energies. This study found that the German 

stock analyzed from 2004 to 2007 was perceived as a winner, however between 2008 to 

2011 the alternative energy sector suffered a great hit with the global crisis and so, these 

stocks turned into looser after all. The author considers that in the sub-period 2004-

2007, there was a speculative bubble. To test this, Bohl (2013) used a supremum ADF 

test and the Markov regime-switching ADF test, which confirmed the existence of a 

price bubble. 

The previous two studies seem to concur that there was a structural break, in 

both papers the period prior to 2007 is studied and after it some conclusions were made. 

In the German case were found that since 2004-2007 there was a speculative bubble and 

in the other case after structural breaks the relationships change. So, after speculative 

bubbles some relationships change and that was the case of the oil prices and clean 

energy stock prices, which after the 2008 break have created a positive one and so the 

connection can be made among the positive relationship with the underperform of 

German clean energy stock prices. Thus, the positive relationship between oil prices and 

clean energy stock prices, have badly influenced the German stocks which had 

underperformed.

Wen, Guo, Wei, Huang (2013) study the return and volatility spillover effect 

among two variables: the stock prices of Chinese new energy and fossil fuels 

companies. For this matter, the asymmetric BEKK model is used to investigate the 

volatility between the mentioned variables while considering that the volatility spillover 

effects might be asymmetric. The sample period used goes from August 30, 2006 to 

September 11, 2012; the performance of new energy and fossil fuel companies in China 

stock markets is taken from China’s new energy index (NE index) and coal and oil 

index (CO index), respectively. Results suggest that the relationships among the 

previously referred variables are significant and asymmetric, that is, bad news have a 

greater impact than good ones in each of the variables thus, bad news about both 

variables leads to larger return changes in their assets. In addition, however good news 

about new energy stock returns leads fossil fuels returns to fall, good news on fossil fuel 

stocks returns cause a rise in new energy returns, although when comparing with bad 

news, these ones causes larger impacts than  positive news do on both variables. 

Furthermore, in regard of volatility spillover, both variables spill over into each other 

assets variance, and also, volatility spillovers depend on the respective signs of the 

return shocks of each asset, for example the spillover is greater when the new energy 

and fossil fuel returns have different signs.  The results demonstrate that new energy 

and fuel stocks are viewed as competitors, substitutes and so, the positive news about 

one variable could affect the attractiveness of the other, moreover, the results also show 

that new energy stock investment is more speculative and thus, riskier than investing in 

fossil fuel stock investment. 

To deeply understand the relationship among oil prices and alternative energy 

stock prices is fundamental to perceive the government intervention and so the policies 

and measures implemented. Felix Groba and Barbara Breitschopf (2013) study the 

needs and motivations regarding the implementation of renewable specific policies. 

They show that policy intervention has been successful in change relative prices and 

thus foster innovation, or in other words, policy intervention can reduce technological 

costs and so lower the final cost, making this industry more attractive. This paper also 

explains the importance of policy mix, market-pull and technological-push policies. The 

main purpose of market-pull policy is to increase the technology usage by creating 

demand for RE technology in one hand by increasing incentives (reduce the investment 

costs, for example) or by rising costs (additional taxes or even technological standards), 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

31 
 

which can be accomplished by setting a variety of measures, for instance, the 

introduction of carbon-tax, carbon trading scheme, feed-in-tariffs, renewable portfolio 

standards, fiscal incentives or even public finance. Regarding the technological-push 

policy, the main objective is to generate new technologies through Research and 

Development incentives. The paper demonstrates that there are different phases in the 

new energy technology deployment and each requires different types of policies, 

whereas the initial phases requires technology-push policies in order to develop new 

technologies and reduce the producing cost and the latter is more suitable for market-

pull policy to commercialize it and put it available in the market to increment the 

market expansion. 

Hirth (2013) considered one aspect that was not yet covered the effect of solar 

and wind power variability on their relative price. In his paper, it is studied the drivers 

of the market value of VRE. In regard of the variable renewable, it includes wind, solar 

and other renewable energies that fluctuate during the day or season. Coupled with this 

flexibility is the market value and price of VRE, which is affected by the amount of 

energy, received by the generators, or in other words, during windy and sunny times, 

the additional amount of electricity received decreases the prices. Thus the higher the 

energy reception and higher penetration rate, more the market value of VRE falls.  

In his study, the author reinforces the fact that the electricity generation from 

renewable energies has been growing at a fast pace during the past years, which had 

been driven by technological progress, economies of scale as well as more subsidies. In 

addition, he also states that one of the best option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is, 

in fact RE, thus it is expected to grow even more in the following decades. According to 

this paper, the objectives for RE share in EU has to come from 17% in 2008, to 35% in 

2020 and finally to 60-80% in 2050, which ensure the growing importance, deployment 

and investment in the alternative energy sector in the coming years. Furthermore, most 

of the growth has to come from wind and solar power, due to the hydropower potential 

is already largely developed and biomass growth is limited by supply constraints. 

Regarding the supply, as it goes without saying, the supply of VRE is variable, thus the 

market value of the electricity depends on when it was produced, which is determined 

by weather conditions. Moreover, as the output is characterized by its uncertainty, 

forecasts error of VRE generation need to be accounted at short notice which is costly, 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

32 
 

leading ultimately to the reduction of the market value. In addition, as transmission 

costs reduce the value of wind power for instance, the value of electricity depends on 

where it is generated, causing far away locations to be costlier than nearby sites. 

Hirth in his paper also provides measures that could reduce the RE output, for 

instance, in order to stabilize wind’s market value, the wind turbine rotor diameters can 

be increased as well as the hub heights so that, it could reduce the output variability and 

could be helpful to reach that objective. Furthermore, VRE need mid and peak load 

generators as complementary technologies, gap which can be filled by Biomass as well 

as efficient natural gas-fired plants. Hirth found as well that a high carbon price alone 

does not make wind and solar power competitive at high penetration rates. In addition, 

he found that without technological innovations, wind and solar power will have 

difficulties at becoming competitive on large scale. 

After analyzed several papers and articles, in which were studied all the 

important variables in regard of this paper it is time to refer where the data comes from, 

identify the main variables studied in this paper, the data frequency and also the sample 

period used in the thesis.

5. Data 
 

The thesis aims to study the risk factors of clean energy stock price, in which is 

fundamental to establish connections among different variables such as oil prices, 

alternative energy stock prices, technology stock prices, S&amp;amp;P 500 and interest rates. 

To analyze clean energy stock prices the WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO) 

is chosen, because it was the first index for tracking the stock prices of RE companies 

and had become a benchmark index (Henriques and Sadorski, 2008). The main purpose 

of ECO is to define and track the clean energy sector, namely businesses that help in the 

transition to a greener society. Individual investors cannot buy directly ECO, they can 

instead invest in an exchange fund which mirrors it, the PowerShares Wilderhill Clean 

Energy Portfolio, with a symbol PBW
30

. PBW aims to invest in companies that focus on 

greener and renewable sources of energy and currently is composed by 50 companies 

from different activity sectors: information technology (49.08%), industrials (20.38%), 

materials (9.76%), utilities (8.18%), energy (6.72%) and consumer discretionary 

(5.87%)

Figure 12 illustrates the evolution of WilderHill Clean Energy Index from 2001 

to 2013. As it is represented in the figure, during the sample period, the WilderHill 

Index suffered huge losses twice bounded by the shadow areas. The first one respects 

the Dot-com Bubble crisis in the beginning of the century, whereas after it the Index 

recovered and grew at a constant rate until reach its highest value in this sample period 

coinciding with the beginning of the global financial crisis. Thus, the second time where 

the WilderHill Index registered a sharp decline was in 2007/2008, with the global crisis, 

being the greatest loss in the period under analysis. The Index value continued to 

decline in the following years, although it had seen a slight ly recovery in the past couple 

of years. 

Kumar et al. (2012) advocate that investors tend to see clean energy firms as 

technology firms and so, it is important to draw some conclusions regarding it. In order 

to examine the importance of the technology stock prices, the Arca Tech 100 Index 

(PSE) was chosen. The objective of this index is to provide a benchmark for measuring 

the performance of technology companies, since it was launched in 1982 by the Pacific 

Stock Exchange. PSE selects companies from different industry sectors as: computer 

hardware, software, semiconductors, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace &amp;amp; 

defense, health care equipment, and biotechnology, always ensuring that the 

technological innovation is at the core of their business
32

. 

The impact of rising oil prices on alternative energy stock prices is positive, 

because it fosters the transition to cleaner energy sources that don’t use petroleum 

(Henriques and Sadorsky, 2008). To this end, it is fundamental to study the oil prices 

variations, thus,  the closing price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is used, crude oil 

futures contract, which trades on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The WTI 

is used as a benchmark to set other oil product related prices. In addition it is the most 

traded futures contract which provides relevant information between buyers and sellers 

(Sadorsky, 2008). 

Previous researches showed that there is a relationship among interest rates and 

stock prices (Sadorsky, 1999, 2001). Therefore, in this paper is used a 3 month US 

Treasury bill interest rate (Rf).

After referred which variables are used in this paper, it is fundamental to set the 

sample period. For this study, weekly data was collected from Datastream between the 

years of 2001 and 2013 which is divided in three sub-periods:  2001-2002; 2003-2007 

and 2008-2013. This period was selected in order to better understand the relationships 

among the aforementioned variables, since the beginning of the 21
st
 Century and the 

sample period was divided in three different parts so the study could focus on distinct 

events.  

The sub-periods were chosen in order to analyze what might have changed, in 

the scope of the dissertation theme, between those periods addressing different events 

occurred in the World. The first sub-period concerns the analysis of what might had 

changed with the Dot-com bubble and the terrorist attacks of 11
th
 of September of 2001 

(2001-2002), the second regards the period prior the global financial crisis of 2008 

(2003-2007) and the last, the crisis era (2008-2013).

Figure 13 represents all variables used in this paper from 2001 to 2013, West 

Texas Intermediate (Crudoil), WilderHill (Winegi), Arca Tech 100 Index (NYSE Arca 

Tech 100 Idx), 3 month risk free interest rate (Treasury Bill Rate- 3 Month US) and 

S&amp;amp;P 500 Composite. As it can be seen in the figure, in the beginning of the sample 

there was a huge loss in the majority of the variables, in accordance with the Dot-com 

bubble crisis in the years 2000-2001, where the ones with the biggest losses were S&amp;amp;P 

500, Arca Tech 100 Index and Wilderhill Clean Energy Index. After this period these 

variables had a constant growth until the year of 2007-2008, the global financial crisis, 

where once more, these three variables suffered large falls. After this crisis, the Arca 

Tech 100 Index growth sharply ended up in 2013 with a higher value than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Regarding the remaining variables, West Texas Intermediate kept a constant growth 

reaching a superior value than the WilderHill Index in 2013, where the 3 month risk free 

interest rate kept the lowest value during the sample period. 

Relating the results found by previous papers with those shown in Figure 13, 

according to Henriques and Sadorski (2008) they found that stock prices of alternative 

energy companies are more influenced by shocks in technology stock prices than by oil 

prices movements, which can be observed in the figure, when Crude oil during the Dot-

-com crisis remain constant, WilderHill decreased along with Arca Tech 100 as well as 

S&amp;amp;P 500. After it, Arca Tech 100 registered a sharp growth along with a recovery 

period by WilderHill, while Crude oil kept constant values. Moreover, this relationship 

can be understood as investors see clean energy firms as technology firms (Kumar et al. 

2012). However, following the financial crisis, all variables suffered a huge loss, there 

was a change in the WilderHill Index behavior, instead of going after the sharp increase 

in value of S&amp;amp;P 500 and Arca Tech, the clean energy index remain constant along with 

Crude oil until 2013, which can be related to the results found by Managi (2013), which 

suggest that after structural breaks, the case of the global crisis, there are positive 

relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices. 

In Table 5 is presented the Summary Statistics regarding the variables used in 

this paper: WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO), West Texas Intermediate (WTI), 

Arca Tech 100 Index (PSE), S&amp;amp;P 500 and Risk Free Rate (Rf).

Table 5 – Summary Statistics 

Variables Mean Sd Max Min N 

ECO -0,1246% 4,9263% 0,145088 -0,15194 673 

WTI 0,1896% 5,5472% 0,273306 -0,36075 674

Rf 0,0411% 0,0347% 0,00122 0.0000394 674 

 

ECO is the only variable with a negative mean, reaching -0.1246%, followed by 

Rf with 0.0411%, S&amp;amp;P 500 with 0.0478%, PSE with 0.0934% and finally WTI with 

0.1896% being the variable with the highest mean value. Regarding the standard 

deviation, as it would be expected Rf has the lowest value, 0.0347%, followed by the 

S&amp;amp;P 500 with 2.7243%, PSE with 3.2222%, ECO with 4.9263% and finally WTI with 

the highest standard deviation value, 5.5472%. Considering the highest and lowest 

values achieved, WTI has the highest value, 0.273306, followed by ECO, 0.145088, 

S&amp;amp;P 500 with 0.129509, PSE with 0.093155 and finally Rf with 0.00122, whilst the 

lowest value registered, -0.36075 represents the WTI, where ECO comes after (-

0.15194), S&amp;amp;P comes next with -0.14908, followed by Arca Tech -0.09559 and 

ultimately Rf with 0.0000394 being the only positive value.  

The variable with higher mean and standard deviation values is WTI as well as 

higher Max and Min values, which illustrates that it is the one with higher values for the 

majority of the sample period as it has the most risk achieving ultimately the Max and  

Min values of the sample period. WTI is the variable with the most unstable and volatile 

values representing the values with more fluctuation along the sample period. ECO 

regardless of its negative mean value, it is similar to WTI having the second bigger 

standard deviation, the second higher Max value and the second lower Min value, 

having this way a big fluctuation along the sample period. In the other hand, Rf is the 

one with the lower risk and has a positive mean and although it has not a great Max 

values it has not negative Min values representing a safe bet. 

After noting the variables used, the sample period, its sub-periods, the evolution 

of the variables during the sample period as well as the summary statistics presents 

itself then, the empirical analysis used in order to address the topic.

6. Empirical Analysis 
 

 In this paper, a multivariate regression examines the relationship between 

alternative energy stock prices, oil prices, technology stock prices, S&amp;amp;P 500 and interest 

rates. Several tables are presented next in order to analyze the variables, such as 

Summary Statistics, Correlation Matrix and the regressions analysis. 

Regression analysis is one of the most used tools in market research because it 

allows analyzing relationships among one or more independent variable and one 

dependent variable, where the independent variables are used to explain the output 

(dependent variable). Regression analysis is used to produce an equation that will 

estimate the dependent variable, as it was explained before, thus the equation is the 

following:  

 

                                         

Where: 

?   - Dependent variable 

?    - Coefficients or Multipliers 

?    - Independent variables 

?   - Constant 

?    – Residual Variable 

The   is the dependent variable that the equation tries to predict,    are the 

coefficients that multiply the size of the effect the independent variables have on the 

dependent variable,    are the independent variables used to predict   and   is the 

constant, thus when all independent variables are equal to zero,   is equal to   and 

finally    are the residuals present in the estimation equation. 

Regression analysis have some advantages such as, it indicates if independent 

variables have a significant relationship with the dependent variable, indicates the 

relative strength that independent variables have on explaining the dependent one and it 

is used to make predictions.

The Table 6 presents the Correlation Matrix between the variables used in this 

paper. 

Table 6 – Correlation Matrix 

  ECO WTI PSE S&amp;amp;P 500 Rf 

ECO 1     

WTI 0,2370 1       

PSE 0,8049 0,1751 1   

S&amp;amp;P 500 0,8012 0,2375 0,8724 1  

Rf -0,0023 -0,0142 -0,074 -0,0626 1 

 

 ECO correlates the most with PSE, 0.8049, followed closely by S&amp;amp;P 500, 

0.8012, while the variable with the lowest correlation value with ECO is Rf (-0.0023). 

Considering WTI, the highest correlation appears to be with S&amp;amp;P 500, 0.2375, followed 

by ECO with 0.2370, being Rf the one with the lowest correlation values, -0.0142. PSE 

and S&amp;amp;P 500 have the bigger correlation values, 0.8724, being Rf, once more, the 

variable that PSE has the lower correlation values with, -0.074. S&amp;amp;P has the higher 

correlation values with PSE, 0.8724 and the lower with Rf, -0.0626. Regarding Rf has 

the higher correlation with ECO -0.0023 and the lower with PSE with -0.074. 

 The highest and lowest correlation values are 0.8724 and -0.074, respectively, 

being the first one among PSE with S&amp;amp;P 500 and the latter PSE with Rf. It implies that 

PSE and S&amp;amp;P 500 have a high correlation and so one variable can help to predict the 

value of the other, whereas, although PSE and Rf have the lowest correlation values 

they have approximately no correlation one with the other because it is close to zero, 

thus one variable cannot help to predict the values of the other. 

 As previous studies state, the clean energy companies are more alike with 

technology companies than with oil prices movements, which can be explained by their 

high correlation, ECO and PSE have 0.8049 of correlation values so, one variable could 

help to predict the values of the other, rather than WTI that have a correlation value of 

0.2370 with ECO, which is considered a low correlation.

The robust regression is an alternative to least squares regression and it is used 

in order to eliminate the effect of outliers, an extreme observation distant from the 

others, which could influence the findings of the paper
33

. The errors are robust to 

control for heteroskedasticity, which means that the standard deviations of a variable 

through time are non-constant
34

. In Table 7 is presented the Regression Outputs. It 

shows three different models: Model 1 with five independent variables WTI, PSE, Rf, 

Oil Vol and S&amp;amp;P 500; Model 2 with four independent variables WTI, PSE, Rf and Oil 

Vol, and Model 3 with seven explanatory variables,  WTI, Oil Pos, D oil Pos, PSE, Rf 

and Oil Vol. In every model the dependent variable is ECO. It is also shown, in 

parentheses the corresponding P-value, the number of observations, the R-squared, the 

Adjusted R-squared and the t-statistics that are statistically significant for a 10%, 5% 

and 1% significance level.

In order to analyze the Model 1 regression outputs, R-square shows the amount 

of variance of ECO explained by WTI, PSE, Rf, Oil Vol and S&amp;amp;P 500. Thus, the model 

shows that approximately 70% of ECO variance can be explained by the independent 

variables.

The Model 1 equation explains that ECO increases 0,0580, 0,6973, 8,0797, 

0,0060 and 0,7072 when WTI, PSE, Rf, Oil Vol and S&amp;amp;P 500 go up by one unit, 

respectively. In addition the equation also states that, when all independent variables are 

equal to zero, ECO is -0,0059. Thus, the betas (independent variables) which have more 

relative strength in explaining the dependent one are Rf followed by S&amp;amp;P 500 and PSE. 

In Model 2 regression outputs shows that 66% (R-square) of ECO variance can 

be explained by explanatory variables, illustrating a decrease when comparing with the 

regression previous analyzed.  

The Model 2 equation explains that ECO increases 0,0869, 1,2087, and 8,2820 

when WTI, PSE and Rf go up by one unit, respectively whilst it decreases 0,02078 

when Oil Vol increase one unit, meaning that the increase in the riskiness of oil hurts 

ECO’s evolution. In addition the equation also states that, when all independent 

variables are equal to zero, ECO is -0,0050. Thus, the betas which have more relative 

strength in explaining the dependent variable are Rf followed by PSE and finally WTI. 

The Model 3 regression output, has a 66% R-square, which show the amount of 

ECO variance that can be explained by the explanatory variables. The estimation 

equation shows that ECO increases 0,0082, 0,0737 0,0078, 1,2040 and 8,4167 when 

WTI, Oil Pos, D Oil Pos, PSE and Rf go up by one unit, respectively whilst it decreases 

-0,0440 when Oil Vol increase one unit, meaning that the increase in the riskiness of oil 

hurts ECO’s evolution. Moreover, the equation also states that, when all independent 

variables are equal to zero, ECO is equal to -0,0096 Thus, the betas which have more 

relative strength in explaining the dependent variable are Rf followed by PSE. 

The coefficients with more relative strength in explaining the dependent variable 

in the three models are Rf and PSE and in the first model, S&amp;amp;P 500, and in the second 

model, WTI, appear to have also more relative strength than the remain variables.  

The R-square shows the amount of variance of ECO explained by the 

independent variables. Thus, Model 1 shows that 69.6%, Model 2 66.1% and Model 3 

66.5% of ECO variance that can be explained by the independent variables, whilst the 

Adjusted R-square represents the same as R-square but adjusted by the number of 

observations as well as the number of variables in the regression, which provide a more 

truthful association among the variables. For instance, when the number of variables is 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

42 
 

small and the number of observations is very large, the Adjusted R-square is closer to 

R-square. Which is exactly what happens in the models, both have a large number of 

observations (673) and a small number of variables, the R-squared is equal to 69.6%, 

while the Adjusted R-squared is 69.4% in the first model, a 66.1% R-squared and a 

65.9% Adjusted R-squared in the second one and finally 66.5% R-squared and 66.2% 

Adjusted R-squared in the third model, thus according to Adjusted R-squared the 

explanatory variables can explain 69.4%, 65.9% and 66.2% of ECO’s evolution. 

When the estimators are analyzed to check if they are statistical significant or 

not, the Model 1 has WTI (b=0,0580; p=0,021), PSE (b= 0,6973; p=0),Rf (b=8,0797; 

p=0.008) and S&amp;amp;P 500 (b=0,7072; p=0) are statistically significant making them related 

with ECO’s evolution, whilst Oil Vol (b=0,0060; p=0.901) is not statistically significant 

and so it seems to be unrelated with ECO. Thus, when WTI increases and because its 

coefficient is positive it is expected that ECO grows as well, where the same happens 

with PSE, Rf and S&amp;amp;P 500. The results found are consistent with previous studies.  

In Model 2 the variables WTI (b=0,0869; p=0,002), PSE (b=1,2087; p=0) and Rf 

(b=8,2820; p=0,008) are statistically significant making them related with ECO’s 

evolution, whilst Oil Vol (b= -0,0207; p=0,709) is not statistically significant and so it 

appears to be unrelated with ECO. Thus, when WTI increases and because its 

coefficient is positive it is expected that ECO grows as well, happening the same with 

PSE and Rf. 

In Model 3 the independent variables D Oil Pos (b=0,0078; p=0,029), PSE 

(b=1,2040; p=0,000), Rf (b=8,4167; p=0,007) are statistically significant making them 

related with ECO’s evolution, whilst WTI (b=0,0082; p=0,885), Oil Pos (b=0,0737; 

p=0,454), Oil Vol (b= -0,0440; p=0,486) are not statistically significant and so seem to 

be unrelated with ECO.                   

The Figures 14, 15, 16 and 17 present rolling windows that show the evolution 

of WTI, PSE, Rf and Oil Vol along the sample period. 

 Figure 14 shows WTI evolution during the sample period, it registered three big 

losses. One in the beginning of the sample period due to the terrorist attacks and the 

Dot-com bubble crisis, then it grew to its maximum value in this sample period and 

registered its biggest loss caused by the financial crisis then recovered after it and 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

43 
 

suffered one more fall at the end of the sample period. However WTI registered three 

big losses, its linear trend line is positive meaning that its evolution is positive, although 

most of it had been motivated by the huge growth prior the financial crisis.  

Figure 14 – WTI Rolling Window 

 

 Figure 15 illustrate PSE evolution along the sample period and as it can be seen 

in the figure it had a constant growth with small variations having this way a linear 

trend line positive, initiating the sample period with 1 and ending with 1.5, which means 

that the sensibility to variations increased during the sample period. 

Figure 15 – PSE Rolling Window

44 
 

Figure 16 represents Rf evolution through the sample period, as the figure 

illustrates, values are mostly constant rounding 0, however there was a big fall in the 

middle of the sample period registering large negative values followed by a huge 

recovery achieving huge positive numbers, which means that there must be outlier 

values that influenced in a great way the coefficient estimation   Followed this event, Rf 

note values rounding 0. The linear trend line indicates that Rf has been decreasing along 

the time. 

Figure 16 – Rf Rolling Window 

 

 

Figure 17 exibiths Oil Vol evolution during the sample period which is very 

unstable as it can be seen in the figure, however its linear trend line is negative which 

means that the oil volatility has been decreasing along the sample period. In a general 

term, the coefficient values are not constant througout the time.

7. Conclusions 
 

The importance of alternative energies is expected to continue to increase in the 

coming years, due mainly to environmental concerns and energy security issues, which 

has great relevance for policy driver for renewable energies. Furthermore, the use of 

renewable energies can reduce fuel importation and detach the economy from fossil fuel 

price rises and variations, which would improve energy security. Therefore, the 

importance of this sector in the global economy is expected to grow and more firms 

have been appearing along the years.  

Oil is the most traded commodity, crude oil alone accounts for 15%, which 

represents the commodity with the greatest importance, followed by Gold (11.5%), 

Natural Gas (9.4%) and Copper (7.5%) (Key World Energy Statistics 2013). However, 

oil consumption has been decreasing, which represents a change towards alternative 

energies. 

According to IPCC 2013, human influence on the climate is clear, raising 

greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, forcing positive radioactive and 

global warming. So, it is fundamental not only, to further develop the alternat ive 

energies, but as well to reduce the human footprint on the environment, in order to build 

a greener society. In response to this, the US is implementing several policies and 

measures such as market-based solution to climate change, which provide economic 

incentives to those who pollute less, so that the cost of polluting reflects the economic 

harm caused to others. Cap-and-trade system and Clean Energy Standard are examples 

of market-based solutions (Economic Report of the President 2013).  

This thesis analyzes the risk factors of investing in alternative energies, using for 

this purpose, a four variable regression where the factors are oil prices, technology stock 

prices, S&amp;amp;P 500 and interest rates.   Due to their growing importance in markets, thus it 

is of interest of investors, managers and policy makers to know the risks of this kind of 

investments. The correlation matrix show that clean energy companies are more 

influenced by technology company returns than with oil prices movements. The 

regression analysis show that oil prices, technology stock prices, risk free rate and the 

S&amp;amp;P 500 have some relative strength in explaining clean energy stock price movements. 

In addition, it also demonstrates that technology stock price movements are more 



An Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors 

 

 

47 
 

important to explain alternative energy stock price movements than oil price movements 

because investors may see alternative energy companies similar to technology 

companies. This seems to suggest that investors care about technological innovations in 

this area more than the price of substitute goods. 

According to IEA, there is a need for further subsidies to the renewable energy 

sector, because it is believed that further growth is essential for a secure and sustainable 

energy system, in order to stimulate costs reduction throughout technology deployment, 

as improvements in manufacturing, technology performances and economies of scale. 

There are some economic barriers that still remain and there is a need for costs to be 

reduced in order to achieve competitiveness. 

In the future, the significance of the alternative energy sector is expected to 

continue to increase and particularly in the US, several policies and measures are being 

implemented to meet environmental targets, not only to reduce the human’s 

environmental footprint but also to make the alternative energy markets more efficient 

and competitive to be able to change from fossil fuels to renewable energies. In the past 

years, several conferences have taken place in order to face the problematic of the 

climate changes. Thus, in the coming years is expected that more alternative energy 

related companies are going to appear, especially in the US. The scope of this paper 

could be extended to other countries and different indexes in order to study the 

relationships among the variables in different markets.
