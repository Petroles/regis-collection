STRATIGRAPHY OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SERGIPANO BELT, NE
BRAZIL: TECTONIC IMPLICATIONS

LUIZ J. H. D'EL-REY SILVA* &amp;amp; KENNETH R. McCLAY*

RESUMO ESTRATIGRAFIA DA PARTE SUL DA FAIXA SERGIPANA, NE DO BRASIL:
IMPLICAÇÔ ES TECTÔ NICAS A Faixa Sergipana (NE, Brasil) é uma cunha orogenética de direção geral
ESE-WNW e que foi polideformada/metamorfisada em consequencia da colisão entre o Macifo Pernambuco- Alagoas,
a norte, e o Cráton de São Francisco, a sul, no Ciclo Brasiliano, há cerca de 700-600 Ma, A partir de estudos anteriores
em escala regional a faixa e dividida, de sul para norte, em tres domínios litotectônicos longitudinals, respectivamente
assemelhados a pilhas de rochas sedimentares e vulcanicas construidas em ambiente cratdnico, miogeoclinal e
eugeoclinal separados por falhas reversas, em geral de alto angulo, que indicam transporte de topo para SSW com
transcorrgncia associada. Na parte norte da faixa são ainda individualizados dois outros domfnios de rochas fgneas e
um domfnio de migmatitos e gnaisses.
Modelos divergentes de evolução tectônica foram produzidos para a faixa, com base em interpretações a favor e contra
a continuidade lateral entre os metasedimentos. Estudos litoestratigrdficos-estruturais realizados em escala de detalhe
(1987-1995) em drea de 4000km2 circundando dois domos gnáissicos de embasamento e englobando a interface entre
o craton, miogeoclinal e eugeoclinal, na parte sul da faixa Sergipana, revelam: (1) uma nova litoestratigrafia das rochas
depositadas nos dois domínios mais a sul, distinta daquela dos estudos anteriores; (2) evidencias sedimentológicas,
estruturais, metamórficas e geofísicas inequívocas a favor da continuidade entre os três domínios, através das suas
falhas de borda; (3) a parte superior da seção da cobertura cratonica compreende uma sequencia de argilito, siltito,
arenito, arcósio e grauvação lítica, com granulometria crescente para o topo; esta seção passa gradativamente a
metasiltito e filito depositados na bacia, onde ocorre sobreposta ao grupo basal e sotoposta a diamictitos e carbonates
do grupo superior, todos depositados em tomo dos domos de embasamento que ocupam o nucleo de antiformes
regionais; (4) as caracteristicas sedimentológicas e o posicionamento estratigráfico inequívoco da sequência de
granulometria crescente para o topo descartam modelos tipo bacia foreland anteriormente adotados para explicar o
topo da seção da cobertura cratônica adjacente a Faixa Sergipana.
Os dados permitem interpretar que o preenchimento da bacia precursora se deu em regime de sedimentação controlada
por tectônica, no qual os domos de embasamento provavelmente atuaram como paleo-altos e as falhas regionais
limitantes dos domínios (meta)vulcano-sedimentares sao provdveis falhas normals originais, que foram positivamente
invertidas na fase de fechamento da bacia. A origem da parte superior da cobertura cratônica, cuja deve ser atribuída
ao soerguimento e erosao de fonte a sul, e os controles tectonicos da sedimentacao, implicam consideravelmente para
a evolução da Faixa Sergipana e do Cráton de São Francisco.

ABSTRACT The Sergipano Belt (NE Brazil) is a ESE-WNW trending volcano-sedimentary wedge
polydeformed and metamorphosed (700-600Ma) due to the collision of the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif, to the north,
with the São Francisco Craton, to the south, during the Pan-African/Brasiliano orogeny. According to previous,
regional-scale studies, the belt comprises three longitudinal lithotectonic domains with cratonic, miogeoclinal and
eugeoclinal affinities, respectively from S to N, separated by regional, WNW-ESE trending, generally high-angle
thrust-strike slip faults. Divergent tectonic evolution models were produced based on interpretations for and against
the lateral continuity between these domains. Detailed stratigraphic-structural analysis from a 1:50,000 scale
mapping carried out (1987-1995) in a 4000km2 area encompassing the interface between the three domains and
surrounding two basement gneiss domes in the southern part of the belt, revealed: (1) the lithostratigraphy of the rocks
deposited in the cratonic and miogeoclinal segments; (2) innequivocal evidence for the sedimentological, structural
and metamorphic continuity across the domains boundary faults; (3) the upper section of the sediments deposited in
the cratonic domain records the deposition of coarsening-upwards mudstones, siltstones, arkosic sandstones and lithic
wackes that spreaded from the craton, to the south, across the craton-basin interface and graded into metasiltites and
phyllites towards the miogeoclinal basin, where they occur in the core of a major basement-cored antiform and are
overlain by a distinct diamictite formation, thus building up a siliciclastic mcgascquence. The sedimentological
characteristics and innequivocal stratigraphic position of these arkosic sandstones and lithic wackes do not fit in
previously suggested thrust-fold belt/foreland basin models; (4) very strong evidence for the miogeoclinal and
eugeoclinal domains being also continuous across their boundary faults, allowing to erect a new stratigraphic template
for the Sergipano Belt.
The data allow to interpret that sedimentation was tectônicaly controlled by the basement domes and normal faults
likely to have been inverted during the closure of the basin. The origin of the upper section of the sediments deposited
in the cratonic domain and the tectonic controls of the sedimentation have relevant implications for the evolution of
both the Sergipano Belt and the São Francisco Craton.

INTRODUCTION - GEOLOGICAL SETTING       The
Sergipano Belt of NE Brazil is a triangle-shaped, highly
deformed wedge lying between the Sao Francisco craton to
the south, and the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north,
the latter being part of the Borborema Province. This Province
is a segment of continental crust intruded by granitoid plutons
and transected by continental-scale ductile zones of high
strain, such as the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, during

the Brasiliano / Pan-African Orogeny (Fig. 1, Almeida et al.
1981, Santos and Brito Neves 1984). The Sao Francisco
Craton was consolidated by the end of the Paleoproterozoic
and, nearby the Sergipano Belt, consists of granulites, gneiss,
migmatites and granites (Fig. 2, Mascarenhas et al. 1984,
Teixeira and Figueiredo 1991). The Borborema Province is a
puzzle of Neoproterozoic belts and gneiss-granite blocks (Fig.
2) reworked since the Archean and/or created mostly in the

Mesoproterozoic (Van Schmus et al. 1993, 1995), possibly
representing a Neoproterozoic collage of terranes, some of
them with polycyclic evolution (Jardim de Sa 1994).

The Sergipano Belt (Fig. 2) comprises six lithotectonic
domains separated by generally high-angle, WNW-ESE strik-
ing thrust and strike-slip faults, and is transected by the

Tucano-Jatoba and Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic basins. The
crystalline basement crops out mostly in the Jirau do Pon-
ciano, Itabaiana and Simão Dias amphibolite grade gneiss
domes. These are mantled by and involved together with the
metasediments in the deformation and regional metamor-
phism. Gneiss from the Simão Dias dome display a whole rock
Rb-Sr 2505 Ma age (Humphrey and Allard 1969), and or-
thogneisses of the Jirau do Ponciano dome display a whole
rock 2500 Ma Rb-Sr isochron age (Amorim et al. 1993). Close
to the belt, rocks from the São Francisco Craton and the
Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif yield whole rock Rb-Sr ages
around 1800 Ma, whereas the belt has a Rb-Sr record of a
673-600Ma old structural-metamorphic evolution (Brito
Neves and Cordani 1973).

The Sao Miguel do Aleixo fault separates the Sergipano
Belt in two longitudinal parts (Santos et al. 1988, Davison and
Santos 1989). The northern part comprises polydeformed,
greenschist to upper amphibolite facies siliciclastic and car-
bonate metasediments of the Macurure domain, migmatites of
the Poço Redondo domain, metadacites and metarhyolites of
the Maranco domain, and the basic-ultrabasic volcanics and
intrusives of the Caninde domain, all being intruded by syn-
to post-tectonic granites around 650Ma (Rb-Sr data in Brito

Neves and Cordani 1973, Chaves 1991). Currently, the lithos-
tratigraphic units of the Macurure Group to the N of the Jirau
do Ponciano dome and the Caninde Domain (Fig. 2) are being
studied in more detail (e.g. Amorim and Torres 1994). The
southern part of the belt comprises polydeformed, sub- to
greenschist facies siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments
of the Vaza Barris domain. The Itaporanga fault separates this
domain from the cratonic Estancia domain.

The Sergipano Belt was a cornerstone in the early days of
the continental-drift hypothesis (Allard 1969, Allard and
Hurst 1969) and has been regarded, together with the Sao
Francisco Craton, as a key for the study of crustal evolution
in the Neoproterozoic (e.g. Davison and Santos 1989, Murphy
and Nance 1991). Compared with other Pan-Afri-
can/Brasiliano belts (e.g. Trompette 1994), the Sergipano Belt
has almost unique gneiss domes around which well preserved
metasedimentary cover and basement-cover relationships are
observable, particularly around the two domes of its southern
part.

Based on fundamental lithological descriptions by Hum-
phrey and Allard (1968, 1969), Jordan (1971) and Silva Filho
(1976), the first stratigraphic framework was established by
Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b), and Silva Filho and Brito Neves
(1979), who divided the sedimentary-volcanic rock record of
the Sergipano Belt in the Estancia, Miaba/Vaza Barris and
Macurure groups (Fig. 2) and interpreted it in terms of the
laterally continuous, cratonic, miogeoclinal and eugeoclinal
domains of a single basin deepening northwards away from
the São Francisco Craton. The cratonic domain comprises the
Estancia Group, which rests unconformably on the craton and
is sub-divided into three formations (lower argillites, sand-
stones and conglomerates; intermediate carbonates; and upper
mudstones, siltstones and sandstones), and the Palmares For-
mation (Fig. 2; massive sandstones, local conglomerates and
lithic wackes), resting unconformably on both the Estancia
Group and the craton. The miogeoclinal domain comprises the
basal Miaba Group, unconformably deposited around the
Itabaiana dome and consisting of basal quartzites (minor
conglomerates), intermediate pebbly phyllites, meta-argillites
and greywackes, and upper metacarbonates. The Vaza Barris
Group, spreading on the rest of the domain, and consisting of
phyllites, metagreywackes, metavolcanics, metadiamictites
and metacarbonates. The eugeoclinal domain comprises the
Macururé Group (basal quartzites and upper schists and meta-
volcanics, all intruded by granites) and the unconformably
overlying Jua Formation (undeformed coarse-grained silici-
clastics). The latter is deposited in a small graben nearby the
eastern border of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2).

Those authors adopted a model (also in Silva Filho 1982)
whereby the syn-tectonic erosion of a collisional thrust-and-
fold belt would supply terrigenous sediments for the uncon-
formable deposition of the Palmares and Jua formations,
respectively as foreland and intramontane basin deposits sup-
plied from the north. Many authors maintained these ideas and
postulated tectonic models for a frontal collision of the Per-
nambuco-Alagoas Massif and the Sao Francisco Craton (e.g.
Brito Neves et al. 1977, Jardim de Sa et al. 1981, 1986,
Campos Neto and Brito Neves 1987). However, challenging
the concept of a single basin, Santos et al. (1988) and Davison
and Santos (1989) defined the Maranco, Poço Redondo and
Caninde domains after a 1:100,000 scale geological mapping
of the central part of the belt, and interpreted the six lithotec-
tonic domains of the Sergipano Belt as terranes accreted
during oblique collision.

Even after Saes (1984) has described in detail a gradual
transition throughout the cratonic sediments, arguing for cau-
tion on the origin of the Palmares Formation, then incorpo-
rated at the top of his Estancia Group, the whole stratigraphy
of the belt and the thrust belt-foreland basin model remained

undisputed until D'el-Rey Silva (1992) carried out a detailed
geological mapping (1:50,000 scale) as part of a PhD research
programme (1989-1992) on the 4,000km2 key area surround-
ing the Itabaiana and Simão Dias domes, and spreading over
the cratonic, miogeocline and eugeocline domains (the
Itabaiana dome area, Fig. 2). An up to date tectonic sinthesis
of the belt is available in D'el-Rey Silva (1995b).

This paper reports the analysis which resulted in a substan-
tial reassessment of the stratigraphy and lithostratigraphic-
structural correlations across the southern part of the belt
(D'el-Rey Silva 1992), coupled with data from more recent
research (1993-1995). The paper describes the geology and
stratigraphy of the Itabaiana dome area and introduces a
stratigraphic framework for the Estância, Miaba/Vaza B arris
and Macururure domains, as part of a continuous basin whose
evolution of architecture and sedimentary infilling is then
interpreted in terms of tectônically controlled sedimentation.
The results of this research have also allowed to describe in
enough detail the geology of the basement domes and to
interpret their evolution in terms of syn-depositional exten-
sional structures that evolved into basement-cored overturned
antiforms during the D1-D3 deformation of the area (D'el-
Rey Silva 1992, 1995a).

GEOLOGY OF THE ITABAIANA DOME AREA In-
troduction The Itabaiana dome area (Fig. 3) comprises
an amphibolite grade granite-gneiss complex cropping out in
two basement domes mantled by a highly deformed green-
schist grade metavolcano-sedimentary cover of quartzite,
diamictite, phyllite and carbonate, together with almost unde-
formed and nonmetamorphosed sediments occupying the SW
part of the area. The Itabaiana dome is an elliptical structure
surrounded by a series of prominent quartzite ranges around
the town of Itabaiana. The Simão Dias dome is much smaller
and continues eastwards along a very narrow strip of mylonitic
gneisses. The stratigraphic record shows a wide variation of
lithofacies and thicknesses throughout the area and comprises
the Miaba, Simão Dias and Vaza Barris groups, subdivided
into eight formations (Fig. 4). The Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic
basin, not included in this analysis, occupies the SSE corner
of the area.

The basement consists of granodiorite gneiss, locally in-
truded by basic-ultrabasic rocks (amphibolites, hornblende
gabbro, minor pyroxenites) and deformed porphyritic gran-
ites. The gneiss is composed of plagioclase, quartz, k-feldspar,
biotite, hornblende, muscovite, sericite, chlorite and epidote.
Accessories are apatite, sphene, zircon, and opaque minerals.
Garnet occurs locally. These are highly anysotropic rocks
basically differing in the more or less continuous metamorphic
banding, which is normally defined by l-10cm thick layers of
fine to medium grained quartz and feldspars intercalated with
?lcm thick biotite-muscovite- epidote rich layers.

The basement/cover contact is generally sheared, except
locally in the eastern margin of the Itabaiana dome, where
basal (meta)conglomerates of the metasedimentary cover lie
unconformably on an erosion surface affecting gneisses dis-
playing the strong anisotropy described before (Davison and
Santos 1989, D'el-Rey Silva 1992, 1995a). Therefore the
metamorphic banding in the basement is older than the
Brasiliano Cycle, and it is most probably Archean- Paleopro-
terozoic because of the radiometric data previously mentioned
in this paper.

The metamorphic banding of the basement (Sn) and the
sedimentary layering of the cover (So) both record similar
polyphase deformational evolution attributable to the
Brasiliano Orogeny. The main mappable structures are sub-
vertical, WNW-ESE trending thrust, strike-slip, normal faults
and major F2 phase folds, whereas a major stratigraphic
inversion on the western border is ascribed to Fl-related

nappes and recumbent folds (Fig. 3). From S to N, the main
faults are the Jacare, Itaporanga, Simão Dias, Escarpa, Pelada,
Mocambo, Ribeiropolis and Dores faults. The main strike-slip
shear zones are the Vaza Barris and the Mocambo faults. Other
subvertical, NW-SE to E-W striking shear zones cut across
the eastern and southern margins of the Itabaiana dome. The
Itaporanga fault roughly corresponds to the boundary between
almost flat-lying cratonic sediments, to the south, and the
deformed wedge to the north. Within this wedge Sn and So
are subparallel to the S1//S2 foliations. Overall these struc-
tures generally trend WNW-ESE and dip steeply to NNE,
except in the hinge zones of the larger F2 folds where the axial
planar foliation is steeper than the folded structures, such as
observed in the interior and along the western side of the
Itabaiana dome, and the Paripiranga anticline to the W of the
Simão Dias dome (Fig. 3).

Stratigraphy The stratigraphy of the study area (Fig.
4) results from the combination of data on 12 sections across
the basement-cover contact around the gneiss domes (Fig. 5)
and comprises the Miaba, Simão Dias and Vaza Barris groups,
fully recognized along sections AA', BB' and JJ'. The other
sections are important to show the lateral equivalence of the
lithofacies. Despite the area is not 100% covered by outcrops,
the sections were composed after the study of numerous,
good-quality exposures along streams, rivers, roads and
quarries. Composite sections with these characteristics have
been produced very recently for other Neoproterozoic basins
(e.g. Knoll et al. 1995, Christie-Blick et al 1995). Although
thickness measurements (Fig. 5) are generally hampered by
the polyphase deformation, the relative thicknesses of each
formation can be traced across the area.

The Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana quartzites, the
Ribeiropolis pebbly phyllites and the Jacoca metacarbonates.
Group thicknesses vary from ?200m on the western side of
the Simão Dias dome, to ?1100m on the eastern and western
sides of the Itabaiana dome.

The Itabaiana Formation consists of a sandy and a muddy
lithofacies. The former surrounds most of the Itabaiana dome
and also occurs as a narrow, discontinuous belt in the western
margin of the Simão Dias dome (the Itabaiana quartzites of
Humphrey and Allard, 1968, 1969). The muddy lithofacies
mainly occurs along narrow ranges to the north of the area,
also in part of the northern margin of the Itabaiana dome and
in the western margin of the Simão Dias dome. The Formation
is 400-700m thick in the eastern and western borders of the
Itabaiana dome, and ?30-200m in the rest of the area.

The most typical section (JJ', Fig. 5) starts with local, thin
bodies of matrix-supported, trough and tabular cross-bedded
conglomerates and conglomeratic sandstones, with basement-
derived clasts, which pass gradually to the 100's m-thick
sequence of white to grey, homogeneously medium- to fine-
grained, sub-rounded, planar cross-bedded quartzites (feld-
spathic near the base) also displaying fluid-escape structures.
Opaque minerals and tourmaline are common accessories
observed in thin sections. Humphrey and Allard (1969) pre-
sented paleocurrent data from relatively common tabular
crossed beds at ?lm-scale, and concluded for a sedimentary
flow to NNW-NNE. D'el-Rey Silva (1992) presented further
observations indicating local sedimentary flows to the E and
W, in basal conglomeratic quartzites, to the west of the Simão
Dias dome and in the middle section to the east of the Itabaiana
dome. The very top of the formation, along section JJ', con-
sists of grey to brown-red, fine-grained metasandstones, me-
tasiltites and meta-argillites, or may also consist of thin lenses
of conglomerattic quartzites with ?lcm-size, generally
rounded basement-derived clasts. The muddy lithofacies con-
sists of micaceous quartzites and/or 10-100cm-thick layers of

arkosic sandstones or wackes, intercalated with red brown
phyllites.

The Ribeiropolis Formation (D'el-Rey Silva 1992) con-
sists of light brown silty phyllites with intercalations of fine
metagrey wackes and pebbly phyllites/metarkoses, but may be
represented only by intermediate metavolcanics or metacon-
glomerates (sections BB' and EE', Fig. 5). It is ?100m thick
in the western margin of the Simão Dias dome and may be
absent or attain ?300m on both the eastern and western
margins of the Itabaiana dome. Thickness ?500m is likely to
occur on the southern and northern margins of this dome. The
contact is generally gradational with the Itabaiana Formation,
but is sheared along a top to ESE low-angle ramp, in one
locallity of the western margin of the Itabaiana dome.

Due to the variety of lithofacies, this formation lacks a
type-section, but generally the pebbly phyllites and metacon-
glomerates occupy basal positions and the phyllitic facies
occurs towards the top of the unit. The best section (JJ', Fig.
5) starts with white to grey or light brown, silty meta-argillites
with parallel stratification, containing intercalations of up to
l0m-thick metagrey wackes and graded bedded conglomeratic
metasandstones and pebbly phyllites, with clasts from base-
ment rocks and quartzite. This sequence passes to finely
laminated grey meta-argillites and light brown metasiltites,

which are overlain by light brown, calcareous phyllites with
intercalations of carbonaceous phyllites, suggesting a gradual
transition upwards into the Jacoca Formation.

To the north of the Itabaiana dome (along section GG', Fig.
5) the Ribeirópolis Formation starts with red brown to purple
silty phyllites seen in gradual passage with the Itabaiana
Formation, and proceeds northward with intercalated pebbly
phyllites, light brown-purple phyllites and possibly porphy-
roclastic volcanic rocks with similar colours. Weathered
metarhyolites and metadacites have been described as part of
this sequence, immediately to the north of the Itabaiana dome
area (Santos et al 1988).

The Jacoca Formation conformably overlies the Ribeirópo-
lis Formation and rests unconformably on Itabaiana quartz-
ites, to the west of the Itabaiana dome (section EE', Fig. 5). It
comprises lithofacies of metacarbonates and metarhythmites.

The typical section (Fig. 6) starts with a 3m thick layer of
laminated white-light grey, l-3cm thick beds of metadolomite
containing ?lcm thick beds of pyrite and chalcopyrite. These
are overlain by a ?15m thick layer of metarhythmites, which
consist of intercalated, laterally continuous, up to l0cm-thick
layers of thinly laminated metadolomite, light brown
metachert and dark grey to black, calcareous phyllite, overlain
by a ?10m-thick column of 1m-thick layers of massive

metadolomite. Thin section of the thinly laminated
metadolomite displays a typical marble texture of equigranu-
lar recrystallised calcite grains, interbedded with ?lmm-thick
layers of sericite, chlorite, biotite, very fine-grained quartz and
feldspar defining a layer-parallel foliation. This unit is over-
lain by a ?40m thick sequence of intercalated, ?l-10cm thick
layers of grey metalimestone, calcarenite and dark grey-black,
locally carbonaceous phyllite. These units display parallel
laminations, wave-truncated current ripples and pass upwards
into a ?200m thick sequence of ?lm thick layers of light grey
metadolomites. Primary structures such as parallel lamina-
tion, fluid-escape structures, small-scale wave-reworking
structures and tabular cross stratifications are observed in the
western margin of the Itabaiana dome. In this area, Guimaraes
et al. (1991) also described abundant oolites and intraclasts,
respectively in the lower and upper section of the Jacoca
Formation. In the western side of the Simão Dias dome the
metarhythmites consist of ?100m thick layers of brown-grey
phyllites with ?10m thick layers of white to grey

metadolomite which was disrupted and occurs in lenses, prob-
ably due to the deformation. To the north of the Mocambo
fault (Fig. 3) the metarhythmites are defined by generally
continuous, ?lm thick layers of dark grey-black, fine-grained
metalimestone, intercalated with ?10cm thick layers of light
brown to dark or variegated metapelites, metasiltites and
minor, fine-grained metasandstones.

The Simão Dias Group is a ?400-700m thick coarsening-
upwards siliciclastic sequence deposited on the Craton and in
the basin. It conformably overlies the Miaba Group in the
studied area, and comprises the interfingered Lagarto-Pal-
mares, Jacare and Frei Paulo formations. The group is a new
stratigraphic unit identified in the southern part of the Sergi-
pano Belt and the name refers to the tectonicaly significant
outcrops found principally to the west of the Simão Dias
dome, in the core of the Paripiranga anticline (section BB' and
Fig. 7a). This group was originally termed Lagarto Group by
D'el-Rey Silva (1992) who also described the complete sec-
tions JJ' (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7b) and LL' (Fig. 8). The new name
is to avoid confusion with the well known Lagarto Formation.

The Lagarto-Palmares Formation (D'el-Rey Silva, 1992)
in general conformably overlies the Jacoca Formation, but the
outcrops along section BB' rest above outcrops of Ribeiropo-
lis metavolcanics. This may suggest an unconformable rela-
tionship due to the lack of the Jacoca Formation, though not
proven because the direct contact is not observed. The forma-
tion also lies in fault contact with the crystalline basement, far
to the south, in the São Francisco Craton (Silva Filho 1982,
Saes 1984). The formation comprises a ?200m thick basal unit
of mudstones and siltstones with lenses of fine-grained, planar
cross-bedded sandstones which occur in the southern limit of
the Itabaiana dome area (Fig. 8a). This unit spreads from the
craton onto the basin's border and gradually passes up-sec-
tion, towards the north, into an intermediate unit consisting of
?200m of fine-grained sandstones with repeated cycles of
parallel lamination capped by small-scale, symmetric wave
ripples. Sharp truncation surfaces are observed at the base of
each cycle. This unit is ?200m-thick and consists of 10cm-
thick layers of fine- to medium-grained, brown to grey, mi-
caceous, parallel laminated (meta)sandstones, with ?5cm-
scale abundant symmetric wave ripples.

Upwards, these rocks pass gradually into the upper unit
(Fig. 9), a ?120m thick sequence consisting of metre-scale
layers of massive or parallel laminated, greenish grey, calcite-
cemented, micaceous fine- to medium-grained sandstones and
lithic wackes, with intercalations of laterally continuous,
?lcm-thick layers of red-brown mudstones. D'el-Rey Silva
(1992) described wavy-surfaces of truncation of the sandstone
layers and sigmoidal-shaped surfaces of truncation of the
muddy layers, above which micaceous sandstone layers were
deposited, indicating an interplay between periods of quies-
cence and periods of sedimentation with higher energy, and
also described ?1 cm-thick continuous muddy layers com-
monly disrupted into ?10cm-wide disk-like mudstone frag-
ments, forming local intraformational breccias or laterally
continuous thin layers of platy, reddish brown fragments.
Petrographically, the upper unit consists of submature mas-
sive sandstones composed of subangular to subrounded, gen-
erally 0.15-0.45mm size grains of quartz, K-feldspar, plagio-
clase, opaque minerals, zircon, granite, aggregates of micro-
crystalline quartz, calcite, epidote, and flakes of muscovite
and chlorite. The erosion of these rocks commonly result into
?1 m-size rounded boulders that dominate the topography, and
this erosion pattern is controlled by the intersection of bedding
and orthogonal fractures (Fig. 8b).

The lower and intermediate units belong to the Lagarto
Formation, whereas the upper unit stands for the Palmares

Formation of Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b) and Silva Filho
(1982). The overall estimated thickness of the Lagarto-Pal-
mares Formation in the Itabaiana dome area (?720m; Fig. 9)
fits with the thickness proved below the Tucano Basin by oil
industry wells (Silva Filho et al., 1978b). However, the maxi-
mum thickness of the upper unit is actually unknown, as it is
truncated by the topography. A section of ?2500m is found in
a partially fault-bounded depocentre where the formation is
in contact with the crystalline basement, far in the cratonic
area (Saes, 1984). This author described in detail a gradual
contact relationship between the Lagarto and Palmares For-
mations, too, in an area ?100km to the south of the Itabaiana
dome. In addition, Saes (1984) showed detailed paleocurrent

data indicating a sedimentary flow to NNE, during the depo-
sition of the Lagarto and Palmares Formations.

Altogether, the large inventory of data mentioned up to here
makes hard to believe that the origin of the Palmares Forma-
tion lies on the erosion of the Sergipano Belt. Just in contrary,
as D'el-Rey Silva stated (1992), the Palmares Formation must
reflect the erosion of high grade granite-gneiss terranes and
low grade supracrustals (greenstone belts) that are found to
the south, in the São Francisco Craton, relatively close to the
basin's border, and this explains the composition of the La-
garto-Palmares arkoses and lithic greywackes. In fact these
formations are truly interfingered, as demonstrated by further
field observation (1993-1995) by the main author, C.A.
Rosiere (UFMG) and B.B. Brito Neves (USP): 1 -?lm-thick,
laterally continuous layers of typical Palmares sandstones

intercalated within beds of Lagarto sandstones, in the largest
site of economic exploitation of the latter rocks, in the same
locality of Figure 8a; and 2 - layers of Palmares sandstones
and polimictic conglomerates with crystalline basement-de-
rived, ?5cm-size, rounded clasts, intercalated with layers of
Lagarto sandstones displaying typical symmetric wave ripples
?5cm across, about 50km into the craton, to the south of the
Itabaiana dome area.

The Jacare Formation (D'el-Rey Silva 1992) consists es-
sentially of micaceous, light brown, homogeneous to vari-
egated and 10-100cm thick layers of metasiltites (Fig. 8c) with
subordinated, l-10m thick lenses of fine- to medium-grained,
light brown metasandstones. The metasiltites are mappable in
gradual transition from the Lagarto-Palmares Formation
along an E-W trending band in the southern part of the area
and in the core of the Paripiranga anticline. The best exposures
are along section LL' (Fig. 9), where thickness is ?150-200m,
and in the core of the Paripiranga anticline where it is much
thinner (section BB', Fig. 5). In the vicinity of faults and shear
zones, these rocks attain a dark brown-black colour, are silici-
fied and indurated, displaying a vitreous texture (e.g.: out-
crops along section LL' and along the Jacaré fault).

The Frei Paulo Formation is ?100m-thick to the west of the
Simão Dias dome (sections BB' and CC'), and ?300m to
?500m elsewhere, particularly in the Vaza Barris valley area
(sections DD', EE', FF'). It comprises several lithotypes: light
grey to brown, silty and variegated phyllites (Fig.8d) with
local intercalations of carbonate-cemented arkosic metasand-
stones and wackes, quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and meta-
greywackes (Fig.8e), metarhythmites consisting of thinly
interbedded black phyllites, metasiltites, calcilutites and silty
phyllites (Fig.8f), and local, thinly interbedded
metalimestones and metagreywackes (Fig.8g). Basic-inter-

mediate metavolcanics may be present, as the ?10m thick
lenses found to the east of the Itabaiana dome (section JJ').

Each of the lithofacies of this formation dominates but is
not exclusive in one part of the area. To the south of the
Escarpa fault, the Frei Paulo Formation consists of variegated
silty phyllites (FP1, Fig. 3). To the north of the Mocambo fault,
the Frei Paulo Formation commonly consists of light brown-
cream silty phyllites, with mappable bodies of fine- to me-
dium-grained, brownish-greenish grey, calcite-cemented
metasandstones, petrographically similar to the Lagarto-Pal-
mares (meta)sandstones and lithic (meta)greywackes (FP2).
Between the Escarpa and Pelada faults, and eastwards of the
Itabaiana dome (FP3, Fig.3), the dominant lithofacies are the
green-blue grey, pyritous, quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites,
metagreywackes, metarhythmites, minor lenses of metasand-
stones and interbedded metagreywackes and metalimestones.

The Vaza Barris Group occurs only to the north of the
Itaporanga fault (Fig.3) and is a ?2000m-thick sequence un-
conformably overlying the previous formations and the crys-
talline basement. It comprises the Palestina metadiamictites
and the Olhos D'agua metacarbonates and metarhythmites.

The Palestina Formation consists of metadiamictites, peb-
bly phyllites and minor phyllites, with local lenses of quartz-
ites. These rocks contain granules, pebbles and cobbles of
basement rocks, as well as quartzites, phyllites and metacar-
bonates. These strain markers are commonly flattened and
elongated, and are all supported by a green-blue grey, gener-
ally fine-grained and foliated sericite-chlorite matrix (Fig.
l0a). The contact with the Frei Paulo Formation is commonly
obscure, although it appears locally to be gradational (section
JJ'). The formation is also seen in close proximity to the
crystalline basement and the Itabaiana Formation, which may
suggest unconformable relationships. The typical area of oc-
currence is between the Escarpa and Pelada faults (the Vaza
Barris river area), where the thickness is &gt;500m and &gt;10cm
size clasts are common. Around the Simão Dias dome the
thickness is ?100m, the matrix is siltier than anywhere else
and &gt;10cm size clasts are rare, although Im-size blocks of
granitic rocks are found near the western end of the trace of
the Simão Dias fault, to the WNW of the Simão Dias dome.
To the east of the Itabaiana dome, the metadiamictites occur
along the Jacarecica river (Fig.7b) above variegated phyllites,
quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and intercalated metasand-
stones of the Frei Paulo Formation. It contains boulders and
pebbles of Itabaiana quartzite and Lagarto-Palmares me-
tasandstones (Fig.lOb) never found in the rest of the area or
described in the literature (D'el-Rey Silva 1992).

The Olhos D'agua Formation consists of metacarbonates
that conformably overlie the Palestina diamictites, but are also
seen highly deformed in contact with the Lagarto-Palmares
Formation, in the SW corner of the area, and also with the
crystalline basement, along the Simão Dias and Itaporanga
faults (Fig. 3). It comprises three different lithofacies (base to
top): laminated metacarbonate rhythmites; oolitic metali-
mestones and metadolostones; mixed metacarbonate and sili-
ciclastics (metarhythmites). The thickness is ?1300m around
the Simão Dias dome and probably also to the north of the
Pelada fault. It seems to be much less, perhaps ?200m, possi-
bly due to tectonic thinning, to the south of the Itabaiana dome.
The Olhos D'água Formation also occurs in the NW corner of
the area and in two bodies cut by the Propriá fault, to the east
of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3), where the laminated metacar-
bonate rhythmites dominate.

The best exposures are from the Simão Dias dome to the
north (A A', Fig. 5). The section starts with hundreds of metres
of laminated metacarbonate rhythmites, which consist of
?10cm-thick interbedded layers of light and dark grey-black,
fine-grained metalimestones, with intercalated ?1cm-thick
layers of light brown metasiltites, brown to purple metapelites

and chert (Fig.l0c). Small- to medium-scale planar cross
stratifications are found locally. These rocks pass up section
into a sequence (probably also 100's of metres thick) of
metalimestones and metadolostones consisting of interbed-
ded, ?10cm-thick layers of fine-grained, black
metalimestones in many places oolitic and pelloidal, with
oncoid structures (Fig.l0d). This lithofacies also contains
&lt;10mm-thick intercalations of brown metapelite, and 10-
l00m-thick layers of grey to light-brown metadoloarenite
displaying small-scale planar cross stratification, wave-like
erosion surfaces, intraclasts and graded bedding (Fig.l0e).

Upwards, this sequence passes gradually into hundreds of
metres of metarhythmites, which consist of fine-grained, 10-
100cm thick beds of black limestone, intercalated with 1-
10cm thick layers of brown to red-brown, commonly vari-
egated, pyritic metapelite (Fig. 10f). These metarhythmites
form the WNW-ESE trending hills that occur along the Es-
carpa and Pelada faults, and the siliciclastic layers become
increasingly significant northwards. Close to the northwestern
side of the Itabaiana dome, along the Salgado river, the
metarhythmites contain 10-100cm thick intercalations of dark
grey-black phyllite (D'el-Rey Silva 1992).

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF
THE SERGIPANO BELT The definition of the Simão
Dias Group as a craton-basin continues blanket of siliciclas-
tics in the southern part of the belt (Fig. 11) led to redistribute
the cratonic domain sediments, all previously incorporated in
the Estancia Group by Saes (1984), and resulted in the lateral
correlation with the metasediments of the miogeoclinal do-
main. The Estancia Group (D'el-Rey Silva 1992) comprises
basal arkosic sandstones, argillites and diamictites (Juete For-
mation) overlain by carbonates (Acaua Formation), and cor-
relates with the Miaba Group, the base of the miogeoclinal
domain, where the Simão Dias and Vaza barris groups also
occur.

Moreover, taking into account the conclusive evidence for
sedimentary, metamorphic, structural and geophysical conti-
nuity between the cratonic, miogeoclinal and eugeoclinal
domains of the belt, despite of their faulted boundaries (D'el-
Rey Silva 1992, 1995a), the Estancia-Miaba, Simão Dias and
Vaza Barris groups correlate with the Macurure Group me-
tasediments to the north. The age of the sedimentation in the
Sergipano basin has been constrained more recently by U-Pb
data from Macurure metavolcanics and other isotopic data
pointing to a l,000Ma old event of rifting recorded in most of
the Borborema Province (Brito Neves et al. 1993).

The Juete-Itabaiana/Ribeiropolis lateral correlation is war-
ranted by the fact that these are siliclastic sediments uncon-
formably overlying the crystalline basement and overlain by
carbonates of the laterally equivalent Acaua and Jacoca for-
mations. Moreover the meta-arkosic sandstones and red-
brown phyllites of the Itabaiana Formation may be correlated
with arkosic sandstones and red-brown argillites in the Juete
Formation of Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b) and Saes (1984),
and the same is valid for conglomerates and diamictites in both
environments. This correlation was in fact done by Silva
Filho et al. (1978 a,b), including even the basal conglomerates
and quartzites of the Macurure Group, deposited around the
Jirau do Ponciano dome.

Megasequence stratigraphy in the Sergipano
Belt The basic principles of sequence (and seismic) strati-
graphy (Hubbard et al. 1985, Wagoner et al. 1987, Christie-
Blick 1991) imply to study sedimentary successions in terms
of the arrange of facies and associated discontinuities, either
on surface or through seismic reflection data. These principles
were established in Phanerozoic areas but have more recently

been also applied to Proterozoic basins (e.g. Christie-Blick et
al. 1988, 1995, Knoll et al. 1995, Saylor et al. 1995).

Due to a poor biostratigraphic resolution, definition of
Neoproterozoic depositional sequences is commonly more
difficult than of Phanerozoic counterparts (Christie-Blick et
al. 1995). These authors established several points for physi-
cal recognition of sequence boundaries, i.e. unconformities
and correlative conformities, and emphasized that successful
studies are easier to achieve in less deformed, ?5km-thick
stratigraphic sections with relatively continuous exposures
along strike.

The southern part of the Sergipano Belt is not the best area
for such purposes, particularly because the D1-D2 deforma-
tion brought into parallelism the S0-S1-S2 planes in large
tracts of the area (D'el-Rey Silva 1992, 1995b); furthermore,
continues outcrops are uncommon, although there are numer-
ous of good quality. Even so, we list below some of the
evidence indicating that important unconformities may have
existed within the stratigraphic succesion of the study area: 1
- some conglomeratic facies intercalated in the Itabaiana and
Ribeiropolis formations may have been incised valleys; 2 -
uplift and erosion of internal parts of the basin as recorded by
the Ribeirópolis and Palestina diamictites; 3 - the wide variety
of lithofacies; 4 - the lack of some formations, like the
Ribeirópolis and Jacoca, around the Itabaiana dome, may be
interpreted as non-depositional surfaces; 5 - moreover, con-
cordant strata do not rule out the existence of unconformities
in a basin (Christie-Blick et al. 1995).

The tracing down of systems tracts within sedimentary
sequences would be too speculative in a section across the
Sergipano basin. However, the establishment of boundaries
of megasequences is feasible, as an amalgamation of silici-
clastic or carbonate sequences, and has allowed the recogni-
tion of two distinct sedimentary cycles in the southern part of
the Sergipano Belt (Cycles I and II, Fig. 11; D'el-Rey Silva
1992). Cycle I comprises the lower siliciclastic megasequence
(Juete-Itabaiana and Ribeiropolis formations) and the lower
carbonate megasequence (Acaua-Jacoca Formation). Cycle II
comprises the upper siliciclastic megasequence (Simão Dias
Group-Palestina Formation) and the upper carbonate megase-
quence (Olhos D'água Formation). These cycles allow to
interpret basin evolution in terms of periods of extensional
tectonism followed by tectonic quiescence (discussed ahead
in this paper), instead of understanding evolution of each
group individually, and thus justifying group boundaries
within a megasequence (Fig. 11), similarly of what has been
done in other Neoproterozoic areas (e.g. Christie-Blick 1995).

THE SERGIPANO BASIN       Lithofacies analysis
Within the Lower Siliciclastic Megasequence, deposition
started with alluvial/fluvial sediments in a continental envi-
ronment (trough cross-bedded basal conglomerates, conglom-
eratic sandstones, diamictites, arkoses and argillites of the
Juete-Itabaiana Formation, and continued with the prograda-
tion of the bulk of ?lm-size planar cross-bedded, relatively
well-sorted and pure Itabaiana quartzites, which compare with
other siliciclastic sequences deposited in a well-washed, shal-
low marine environment (cf. Walker 1985). The lithofacies of
interbeded arkosic metasandstones and red brown phyllites
may be interpreted to indicate uplift and erosion of inner-basin
crystalline basement areas or blocks (cf. Dickinson and
Suczek 1979), whereas the Ribeirópolis phyllites record the
upper and finer fraction invaded at times by intrabasinal clasts
and minor volcanics.

In the Simão Dias Group, the vertical succession of primary
structures of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation strongly sug-
gests increasing energy in the sedimentary environment (cf.
Nio et al. 1980, Tillman 1985) and compares with those
expected in coarsening-upwards siliciclastic sequences de-

posited on shallow marine platforms (shelf sandstones, cf.
Walker 1985). The basal unit matches the typical interbedded
sandstone-and-mudstone facies deposited by storm-induced
turbiditic currents below the storm wave base (cf. Walker
1985, Tillman 1985). The small-scale, wave-ripple cross
stratification, with local indications of bidirectional flows, and
the sand-mud couplets in the bottom of the upper unit of this
formation, with muddy layers commonly disrupted (Fig. 8),
indicate inteftidal to subtidal environments (cf. Visser 1980,
Tillman 1985) and suggest the action of wave-reworking
processes or even the overload of thick sandstone layers being
deposited. The grain size, the parallel lamination, the dis-
rupted muddy layers, and some parallel cross stratifications
of the Palmares sandstones compare with the cross-bedded
sandstone facies deposited above the tidal current base, where
stronger currents do exist (cf. Walker 1985). Parallel-lami-
nate, fine-grained siliciclastics such as the Jacare metasiltites
and Frei Paulo variegated phyllites may be interpreted as distal
sediments deposited below the storm-wave base, with even-
tual contribution of turbiditic tongues to form the sandy
lenses. The assemblage of Frei Paulo quartz-sericite-chlorite
phyllites, metagreywackes, metarhythmites and metavol-
canics is very similar to those commonly found in distal,
restricted, and relatively deeper-water environments associ-
ated with volcanism, e.g. in the Mesoproterozoic of Canada
(cf. Wardle and Bailey 1981) and also in the Riacho do Pontal
Fold Belt (Fig. 1, Gomes 1990). The lithofacies of interbedded
metacarbonates and pebbly metagreywackes, already de-
scribed in other Neoproterozoic areas (Miller 1983), has also
been recognised in Cretaceous deep waters of North America
(Sliler et al. 1991).

Diamictites Although these rocks may be formed by
meltwaters, glaciogenic processes, debris and mud flows
(Eyles and Mial 1984), commonly the clasts suply is mostly
induced by extensional tectonic processes in all sedimentary
environments (Eyles 1993). The Ribeirópolis and Palestina
pebbly phyllites and diamictites most probably indicate
tectônically and gravity-induced mass flows operating in the
basin, in agreement with earlier suggestions by Humphrey and
Allard (1969). Evidence are the thickness variation, the nature
and the size of some clasts locally observed close to regional
faults. Negative evidence are the lack of glaciation-related
clasts, striated pavements, and extra-basinal clasts in the study
area.

Carbonates The Jacoca and Olhos D'água carbonates
compare with shallowing-up sequences typical of most of the
Proterozoic platforms (cf. Grotzinger 1989). These sequences
normally have basah offshore shelf facies (parallel-laminated
and thinly intercalated carbonate and fine siliciclastics or
distal turbidites), and pass into subtidal-intertidal facies,
where oolites, intraclasts and wave-reworked structures
recording a more agitated environment (e.g. Herrington and
Fairchild 1989). Similarly, both carbonate formations in the
Itabaiana dome area pass to rhythmites comparable to the
limestone rhythmite facies commonly developed along ramps
leading to relatively deeper environments (cf. Hoffman 1974,
Markello and Read 1981).

Paleogeography and syn-depositional tectonics
Several data from the literature of the Sergipano Belt (sum-
mary in D'el-Rey Silva 1992) indicate that the Sergipano

basin was asymmetric and deepened eastwards and north-
wards from the NNE margin of the São Francisco Craton. To
the west of the Tucano basin (Fig.2), the sediments deposited
in the cratonic environment are less than a few 100'm-thick
and consist of local Juete conglomerates and Acaua carbon-
ates, which directly overlap the craton basement. The sedi-
ments deposited in the basin are siliciclastic and belong to the
Frei Paulo and Palestina Formations. To the east of the Tucano
basin, the cratonic sediments are generally =1-3km thick
(Silva Filho 1982, Saes 1984) whereas in the basin total
thicknesses is ?4km around the Itabaiana dome (Davison and
Santos 1989, D'el-Rey Silva 1992).

Wide variation of lithofacies and thicknesses associated
with regional faults, as in the Sergipano basin, have been
described and interpreted as well-documented examples of
sedimentary infilling under a syn-depositional extensional
regime (e.g. Mitchell and Owens 1990, Collier 1991). Actu-
ally, the abundant evidence for tectônically controlled sedi-
mentation up to the deposition of the third megasequence (Fig.
10) allows to interpret most of the regional thrust faults in the
southern part of the Sergipano Belt as positively inverted
normal faults (Fig. 3). The data also strongly suggest that the
Itabaiana and Simão dias basement domes started to evolve as
paleohighs, and the area between the Escarpa and Pelada faults
evolved into a fault-bounded, long-lived and relatively deeper
trough during basin evolution (the Vaza B arris trough of
D'el-Rey Silva 1992) which extends up to 300km, to the west
of the Itabaiana dome, in an otherwise shallow water basin.
The trough may have stretched also to the east, in the direction
of the present Atlantic ocean.

In fact, all the formations are much thinner (0-100m)
around the Simão Dias dome, exception for the Olhos D'água
carbonates, and around the Itabaiana dome, exception for the
Itabaiana quartzites. On the contrary, the greatest accumula-
tions of finer siliciclastics (?500m) is recorded between the
Escarpa and Pelada faults, as well as to the north of the
Mocambo fault (Fig. 3). One could argue for tectonic thinning
of the siliciclastic sediments above the Itabaiana quartzites,
instead of a stratigraphic thinning towards the domes. How-
ever, the fact that the Ribeirópolis Formation is actually
missing somewhere around the Itabaiana dome, without evi-
dence of tectonism in the contact Itabaiana-Jacoca formations,
together with preservation of primary structures in the basal
contacts of the Itabaiana and Ribeiropolis formations, around
both the domes, does not recommend the tectonic interpreta-
tion, although it may have had some participation, enhancing
the thickness contrast.

The Miaba Group The (Juetê-)Itabaiana Formation
changes from the muddy and conglomeratic basal lithofacies,
up to the ?30m thick on the craton and regionally, even around
the two domes, to well-washed quartzites up to 200m-thick,
in the southern part of the Itabaiana dome, reaching ?750m to
the west and east of it. This change happens across the trace
of the Simão Dias and Itaporanga faults, and strongly suggests
that the site of the future Itabaiana dome evolved into a deeper
depocenter which captured most of the sediment supply.
Ribeiropolis volcanics occur in the western side of the Simão
Dias dome, whereas conglomeratic lithofacies occur locally

in the eastern and western sides of the Itabaiana dome
(Ribeirópolis diamictites displaying ?1.2m size clasts of
basement rocks were found close to the Mocambo fault and
to the Itabaiana dome by Humphrey and Allard 1969). The
thicker Jacoca carbonates die to the west and northwest of the
Itabaiana dome and become increasingly siliciclastic towards
the Vaza Barris trough, and to the north of the Mocambo fault.

The Simão Dias Group By that time the basin
received thicker and relatively deep water sediments of the
Frei Paulo Formation to the west and to the east of the
Itabaiana dome, whereas sandstone lenses are recorded within
the phyllites, particularly to the north of the trough (Fig. 3).

The Vaza Barris Group The Vaza Barris trough
records the thickest section of the Palestina diamictites, and
also records the gradual passage from Olhos D'água
carbonates into carbonate metarhythmites, across the trace of
the Escarpa fault (section AA' , Fig. 5).

Continental margin extensional model We prefer
a simple shear style of crustal extension (cf. Wernicke and
Burchfiel 1982) for the opening of the Sergipano basin above
a linked listric detachment (cf. Gibbs 1984). Extension of the
northern margin of the Sao Francisco Craton was probably
oblique (Fig. 12; cf. Gibbs 1987). The basin probably evolved
from an initially intracratonic setting into an oceanic basin.
Such interpretation is supported by the island-arc geochemical
signature of the basic-ultrabasic magmatism of the Caninde
domain and by deposition of the Palestina diamictites in a
?300km long trench that indicate an important event of crustal
extension (the Vaza Barris trough of D'el-Rey Silva 1992,
1995b). In such a model, upper crust extension would take
place above a ramp-flat listric basal detachment, and the
cumulative strain of the extending hangingwall was accom-
modated by a system of synthetic and antithetic, planar and
listric normal faults.

The listric fault model is favoured because: a - the basin
must have been asymmetric; b - thicknesses generally increase
to the north, away from the São Francisco Craton; c - the
Palestina diamictites are deposited in a long lived trough; d -
extensional fault activity is indicated by the presence of large
polylithic clasts of both basement and cover sediments in the
succession adjacent to the Simão Dias and Mocambo faults,
pointing out to uplift-erosion of footwall and possibly hang-
ingwall blocks twice during the evolution of the basin; and e
- the lack of multiple wedge shaped sedimentary sequences
within the succession. These would be produced if extension
in the basin margin dominantly occurred by an array of
domino style faults (e.g. Davison 1989), or even in a flexural-
cantilever model (cf. Kusznir et al. 1991).

TECTONIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BELT AND
THE SAO FRANCISCO CRATON The stratigraphic
analysis here presented rules out thrust belt-foreland basin
models to explain the origin of the Palmares sandstones and
lithic wackes, an interpretation initially adopted in the pre-
vious literature of the Sergipano Belt, as in the Introduction
of this paper. In addition to the large amount of new data
pointing out to another origin for the Lagarto-Palmares For-
mation, the sedimentary characteristics of the Palmares sand-
stones and wackes do not compare either with continental
sedimentation described elsewhere ahead of thrust sheets (e.g.
Gustavson 1974, Nichols 1987) or ahead fault-uplifted terra-
nes (e.g. Wescott and Ethridge 1990). Similarly, the strati-
graphic succession formed by the Simão Dias and Vaza Barris
groups does not compare with the marine sedimentation de-

veloped in foreland basins due to accretion of terranes into a
passive margin, as interpreted for example in the evolution of
the Appalachians and Cordilleran basins of North America
(Tankard 1986).

Because the Sergipano Belt has unique and key evidence
around the basement domes, and because its cratonic-miogeo-
cline-eugeocline lithostructural continuity is a common fea-
ture in many other Neoproterozoic fold belts, in particular
around the Sao Francisco Craton (e.g. Egydio da Silva et al.
1989, Gomes 1990, Uhlein et al. 1990, Pedrosa-Soares et al
1992, Farias 1995), caution is required in applying thrust
belt-foreland basin models to explain the upper section of the
cratonic cover related to the Riacho do Pontal, Rio Preto,
Brasilia and Araçuaí Belts (Fig. 1). Instead, the voluminous
sands of the upper section of the Estância domain in the
Sergipano Belt (the Palmares massive sandstones) must have
come from southern sources in the São Francisco Craton, once
the detailed sedimentary analysis done by Saes (1984) within
his Lagarto and Palmares formations does not support a
northern source.

CONCLUSIONS Tectônically controlled sedimenta-
tion resulted in the deposition of a _1-4km thick miogeoclinal
wedge of carbonates and siliciclastics in the southern part of
an asymmetric basin that afterwards evolved into an ocenic
basin, the closure of which formed the Sergipano Belt in the
northern margin of the São Francisco Craton. The
stratigraphic record of the southern part of the belt is divided
in the Estancia-Miaba, Simão Dias and Vaza Barris groups.
These groups correlate laterally with the Macururé Group of
the northern part of the belt and comprise ten formations
interpreted as part of two sedimentary cycles and four
megasequences which accounts for the spatial distribution of
lithofacies, thickness and sedimentary processes throughout
the basin.

A new tectonic-sedimentary entity in the Sergipano Belt
(the Simão Dias Group and the Upper Siliciclastic Megase-
quence as a whole), most likely resulted from a uplift and
erosion of the São Francisco Craton and also from basement
blocks uplifted to the N of the Itabaiana dome area, implying
that massive sandstones overlying the cratonic sedimentary
cover (the Palmares sandstones) are not the product of the
erosion of a deforming Sergipano Belt. The similarities of the
sedimentary record, the craton-belt lithostructural continuity
and the megasequence stratigraphy of the Sergipano Belt
compare well with other Neoproterozoic cratonic margins,
pointing out to a probable common tectonic evolution for the
Neoproterozoic cratons, basins and belts. This issue is to be
adressed in more detail in a future publication where basin
evolution is further discussed, together with the origin of the
Simão Dias Group and its implication for the evolution of the
São Francisco Craton and peripheral Neoproterozoic basins.
