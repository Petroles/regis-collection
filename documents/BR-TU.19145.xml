ABSTRACT

This thesis assesses the use of the measured motions of a semisubmersible oil platform
as a basis for estimating on-site wave spectra. The inference method followed is based on
the wave buoy analogy, which aims at solving the linear inverse problem: estimate the
sea state, given the measured motions and the transfer function of the platform.

Directional wave inference obtained from the records of vessels motions is a technique
that has seen its application grow significantly over the last years. As a matter of fact, its
applications in ships with forward speed and ship-shaped moored platforms (such as FP-
SOs) have provided good results. However, little research has been done regarding the use
of semisubmersible platforms as wave sensors. This is due to the fact that these platforms
are designed to present no significant responses when excited by waves. Notwithstand-
ing this, the semisubmersible platforms are characterized by measurable small motions.
Moreover, if compared with ship-shaped motion-based wave sensors, the responses of the
semisubmersibles are in better agreement with the response characteristics estimations
obtained by means of linear hydrodynamic models. In addition, the eminently linear
characteristics of the responses often lasts even for severe wave conditions. This feature
results in that the semisubmersible platforms stand as a promising wave sensor even for
extreme sea states, conditions in which other types of sensors (i.e. buoys, radars) may
face difficulties. Throughout the text, the main results of this work are presented and
discussed. These results are mainly based on a dedicated experimental campaign, carried
out with a scaled model of the A?sgar-B platform, which is a semisubmersible platform
located in the A?sgard field offshore Norway. Regarding the sea states tested during the ex-
periential campaign, they were estimated by means of a motion-based Bayesian inference
method, which has been developed for more than then years at the EPUSP. In order to
allow the adoption of the semisubmersible platforms as a motion based wave sensors, this
thesis provides two significant improvements of the method: first, a method to obtain an
estimation of the linearized equivalent external viscous damping is provided. This analyt-
ical methodology allows to reduce the uncertainty of the transfer function of the platform
close to the resonances of the motions and, as a consequence, it increases the accuracy of
the inference approach. The second relevant contribution is the development of an alter-
native prior distribution, which is adopted to introduce the prior beliefs regarding the sea
state in the Bayesian inference approach. It is shown that although some aspects of this
novel approach require further evaluation in future work, the prior distribution developed
has potential to improve the accuracy of wave estimates, and, at the same time, it sig-
nificantly simplifies the calibration procedures followed by other state-of-the-art Bayesian
wave inference methods.

Summing up, the inference approach proposed in this work provides the bases to use
each semisubmersible oil platform, which stand as the most common type of oil platforms
operated offshore Brasil, as a motion based wave sensor, thus contributing to the possible
broadening of the Brazilian oceanographic measurement network.

RESUMO

A presente tese investiga a adoc?a?o de plataformas de petro?leo semissubmers??veis como
base para infere?ncia das condic?o?es de onda atrave?s do monitoramento de seus movimentos.
O problema em questa?o consiste na soluc?a?o do problema inverso de comportamento em
ondas; ou seja, uma vez observados os movimentos da unidade flutuante (e conhecidas
suas func?o?es de resposta de movimento), estima-se as condic?o?es de ondas que os causaram.

Este tipo de me?todo ja? vem sendo empregado ha? anos para navios em curso e tambe?m
para navios convertidos em plataformas de petro?leo (os chamados FPSOs) com bons re-
sultados. No entanto, o poss??vel emprego de plataformas semissubmers??veis para o mesmo
fim foi muito pouco explorado ate? o momento. Evidentemente, isso decorre da suposic?a?o
de que, uma vez que essas estruturas sa?o projetadas com o intuito primeiro de atenuar
os movimentos decorrentes das ac?o?es de ondas, naturalmente elas na?o seriam bons sen-
sores para esta finalidade. Os resultados apresentados nesta tese, todavia, contrariam tal
suposic?a?o. De fato, as semissubmers??veis respondem de forma fraca a?s ondas, pore?m esta
resposta e? mensura?vel. Na?o apenas isso, mas, em comparac?a?o com os cascos de navios,
esta resposta adere melhor a?s previso?es dos modelos hidrodina?micos lineares a partir dos
quais as caracter??sticas da plataforma sa?o estimadas. Ademais, o cara?ter eminentemente
linear da resposta muitas vezes perdura inclusive para condic?o?es de ondas severas. Isto,
por sua vez, torna as semissubmers??veis promissoras inclusive para a estimac?a?o de mares
extremos, situac?a?o nas quais os outros tipos de sensores (boias, radares) enfrentam dificul-
dades. Nesta tese, a demonstrac?a?o destes fatos e? sustentada por um extenso conjunto de
testes experimentais realizados em tanque de ondas com um modelo em escala reduzida
de uma plataforma que hoje opera no Mar do Norte. Para tanto, foi empregado um
me?todo de infere?ncia Bayesiana para estimac?a?o de ondas em navios que vem sendo desen-
volvido na EPUSP ha? mais de dez anos. Para o estudo das semissubmers??veis o trabalho
propo?e duas melhorias importantes no me?todo: A primeira consiste em um procedimento
anal??tico para prever o amortecimento hidrodina?mico de origem viscosa dos movimentos
observados do casco. Este procedimento permite reduzir as incertezas quanto a? func?a?o
de resposta em condic?o?es de ressona?ncia dos movimentos com as ondas e, dessa forma,
aumentar a confiabilidade do me?todo. A segunda contribuic?a?o relevante e? a proposic?a?o
de uma alternativa para a chamada distribuic?a?o a priori originalmente empregada pelo
me?todo Bayesiano. Demonstra-se que, embora alguns aspectos desta nova metodologia
ainda necessitem de uma avaliac?a?o adicional em trabalhos futuros, a nova distribuic?a?o tem
grande potencial para melhorar a precisa?o das estimativas de ondas, ale?m de simplificar
de maneira significativa os procedimentos atuais de calibrac?a?o do sistema de infere?ncia.

Em suma, o me?todo de infere?ncia aqui proposto abre caminho para tornar cada
unidade flutuante de o?leo e ga?s do tipo semissubmers??vel, um dos sistemas de produc?a?o
mais frequentes nas costas brasileiras, um eventual ponto de monitoramento de ondas,
contribuindo enta?o para a poss??vel ampliac?a?o de nossas bases de medic?a?o oceanogra?ficas.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Motivation

The knowledge of the sea conditions is of central importance for a wide range of off-

shore and nearshore operations, engineering design and validation of forecasts of extreme

wave events. In general, field measurements of the sea conditions are collected by research

institutions and governmental organizations. Notwithstanding this, a significant amount

of these meteorological and physical oceanographic data (also known as metocean data)

is collected by private industry, in particular by Oil and Gas (O&amp;amp;G) companies.

As a matter of fact, observed metocean data and analyses provide the O&amp;amp;G industry

with essential information and knowledge for the design and engineering of offshore in-

stallations, such as platforms and pipelines, and decision support systems. For the sake of

illustration of the main benefits related to the use of ocean data, some examples extracted

from (SHAW et al., 1999) are provided:

• A 5% reduction in design wave height translates into a reduction in steel costs that

may range between 5% and 10%;

• Decision support systems (which are crucial for a proper operational management)

adopted during the installation and operation of offshore platforms are based on

weather forecasts and real-time metocean data;

• The selection of the most convenient platform type for field exploration/production

is usually based on historical sea data measurements.

The assessments and discussions regarding the research carried out and presented in

this work are expected to represent a small contribution towards the development of the



2

a more sophisticated and efficient network of wave monitoring systems, through the use

of a semisubmersible platform as a motion based sea wave sensor.

1.1.1 Wave estimation in the sea: The state-of-the-art

For the purpose of this thesis, it is important to bear in mind the general principles

and theory of wave measuring systems. For readers not familiar with such devices, a

general overview of the main technologies is provided, including the wave buoys and wave

radars, but this overview is by no means exhaustive. (BARSTOW et al., 2005) stands as a

reference for the readers interested in a comprehensive description of the wave measuring

technologies assessed below.

Wave conditions in the ocean can be characterized according to the data collected

through wave measurement devices. Nevertheless, one must remember that the sea sur-

face elevation cannot be described by means of an explicit mathematical model and,

as a consequence, it is assumed to be a time-space random process (DENIS; PIERSON,

1953). Hence, to properly describe the sea state, the directional energy wave density spec-

trum is commonly adopted. The directional energy wave density spectrum, also know as

directional wave spectrum, provides information regarding the distribution of the wave

energy in both frequency and direction domain and it is estimated using the data collected

through sea wave monitoring systems. Figure 1.1 shows a simple illustration of the main

features that a directional wave spectrum presents.

Figure 1.1: Directional wave spectrum. From (LLOYD, 1989).

In general, on-site measurements of ocean data are obtained through moored buoys,

which enclose a wide range of models. In (BARSTOW et al., 2005) the authors followed a

categorization based on the variables recorded by these devices (e.g. acceleration, vertical

displacement, etc.) resulting in the following types of wave buoys: (i) heave-roll-pitch

buoys, (ii) displacement buoys and (iii) GPS buoys. The earliest reference to using a

wave buoy for directional wave measurements appeared in (BARBER; URSELL, 1948),

but it was not until some years later that Longuet-Higgins, Cartwright and Smith (1963)

provided a systematical discussion and characterization of the main fundamentals of these

systems, which rely on the use of the measured motions of the buoy as a basis to estimate

the wave spectrum and the associated sea state parameters. The relevance of the wave

buoys as a wave measurement systems is attested by several works, such as the WADIC

project (ALLENDER et al., 1989), that presented the results of a one-year field trial

in the North Sea and included a comprehensive analysis of the data obtained with five

different wave buoys measurement systems.

During the past decades these devices have been complemented by new technologies.

An example of these technologies is the wave radar measuring system, whose general

principle is well known. These wave radars are generally classified based on their working

frequency band. Thus, radars with HF and VHF bands are usually under 300 MHz.

Regarding the navigation radars, the preferred band corresponds to the X-band (8 to 12

GHz.), which requires very small antennas due to the fact that the size of antennas is

related to the length of the signal (higher frequencies require smaller antennas). Several

works have been developed using radar data to characterize the wave conditions, such

as (MAGNUSSON, 2008), where the author used wave radar data to forecast extreme

wave condition in central North Sea. (FUCILE et al., 2016) is another interesting work

regarding the wave inference using radar data, in this case the authors provided two

analysis techniques based on measurements collected using radar imaging. An illustration

of wave buoy and wave radar measurement systems is provided in Fig. 1.2.

At the same time, there are several difficulties associated with the measuring of the

wave conditions through these wave monitoring systems. Indeed, a drawback arises in

extreme weather conditions when these systems may render inaccurate measurements.

For instance, wave buoys may be dragged through or swerve around the 3D peaks of

waves (ALLENDER et al., 1989). Furthermore, the accuracy of the buoy displace-

ments decreases when long swell wave energy (&gt; 20s) is present (ESSEN; EWANS; MC-

CONOCHIE, 2018). In addition, eventual presence of a spike in the raw accelerometer

data may produce erratic maximum wave height measurements (MACKAY, 2009). Rough

sea states and adverse weather conditions are also among the possible sources of errors

in wave measurements from wave radar systems, since errors can be attributed to the

shadowing effects produced by rain, large waves or sea spray, as well as the inherent bias

of the system that can happen to increase under extreme sea conditions (MAGNUSSON,

2008).

Comparisons between estimations obtained with wave buoys and wave radars have

shown some important discrepancies,see for example (DURRANT; GREENSLADE; SIM-

MONDS, 2009; CHEN et al., 2013) and (WIJAYA, 2009), highlighting the inherent biasses

and differences in the performance of these sensors in different sea conditions. Therefore,

aiming at estimate the directional wave spectrum, several assumptions must be made,

which should be different from one instrument to another. This aspect of the wave moni-

toring systems is well illustrated in (BARSTOW et al., 2005), where the authors pointed

out the importance of understanding the main strengths and weaknesses of each measure-

ment system in order to judge which parameters of the wave spectrum can be accurately

estimated.

Returning to the wave buoys, nowadays they are in widespread use as they are the

most common monitoring technology. This fact is well depicted by the number of these

devices deployed within the major O&amp;amp;G fields. For instance, Fig. 1.3 shows the moored



5

wave buoys currently operating in the Gulf of Mexico. This figure includes more than 150

of these devices which are operated by governmental and private institutions. These wave

buoys are concentrated in an area equivalent to 1 million square kilometers (the upper

half part of the Gulf of Mexico) with a water depth ranging from 300m to 2150m, where

the main O&amp;amp;G exploration and production operations are carried out.

Figure 1.3: Wave buoys stations in the Gulf of Mexico. Data from (NOAA, 2018).

There are several reasons that have had a significant impact on the adoption of these

devices. Table 1.1, extracted from (FILIPPELLI et al., 2015), shows the most relevant

factors referring to the cost range, estimate deployment time and net energy uncertainty

for different wave measuring systems. The values provided in this table include the esti-

mated cost of the systems as well as the installation and operation for a time span of 3

years. Nonetheless, these systems usually require a calibration campaign, that generates

an extra-cost that varies between 5% and 10% of the total cost of the system (FILIP-

PELLI et al., 2015). From these data, one may realize that the measurement systems

most commonly adopted (wave buoys) present the lower prices and deployment times

compared to other systems, although in some cases these advantages may be obtained at

the cost of increasing the energy uncertainty.

Even though the advantages of using the wave monitoring systems seem clear (tech-

nical decisions are made, based on the collected metocean data, on whether or not spend

many millions of dollars while the cost involved in collecting these data are several orders

of magnitude lower), some regions in the world containing major oil fields are not yet

characterized by a proper network of wave monitoring sensors. As an example, Fig. 1.4

shows the moored buoys installed offshore the Brazilian Southern region. This region

includes the Santos, Campos and Esp??rito Santo basins, which represent the major part

of the Brazilian O&amp;amp;G reserves and account for more than 60 bilion barrels of oil.

Figure 1.4: Wave buoys stations in the Santos, Campos and Esp??ritu Santo basins, located
in the Southern region of the Brazilian coast. Data from (GOOS-BRASIL, 2018) and
(NOAA, 2018).

The offshore area included in Fig. 1.4 is equivalent to 1,2 millions of square kilometers,

where the maximum water depth is about 3000m. This figure provides the moored buoys

operated by governmental and private organizations. Differently from the Gulf of Mexico,

in this area only seven buoys are currently installed and four of them are under mainte-



7

nance operations (orange markers) at the current date (25/08/2018). Thus, only 3 buoys

are monitoring an area that is equivalent in extension and relevance to the one assessed

previously in the Gulf of Mexico (where more than 150 of these devices are operating).

The lack of a proper monitoring network of wave buoys can be explained by several rea-

sons, such as the technical challenges that arise during the installation/manteinance of

these devices in deep and ultra-deep water conditions1 and the fact that O&amp;amp;G industries

began the development of their deep water activities in part of these fields during the late

90s and early 2000s.

An alternative to overcome the lack of wave measurement systems would be the use of

the O&amp;amp;G floating offshore platforms operating in the Brazilian coast as wave sensors. The

main idea here is to complement the wave measurements obtained through the moored

buoys with the sea state estimations computed based on the measured motions of the

offshore platforms. Thus, for example, if all the floating platforms currently operated by

Petrobras in the region assessed previously in Fig. 1.4 were adopted as wave sensors, the

resulting network of monitoring systems would be composed by more than 40 sensors.

This is illustrated in Fig. 1.4, were the network of waves buoys shown in Fig. 1.4 is com-

plemented by the location of the floating O&amp;amp;G offshore platforms operated by Petrobras.

The adoption of moored floating offshore platforms as on-site wave sensors to improve

the wave measurement network in the Brazilian coast was an idea initially proposed

in 1999, by the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department along with the

Mechatronics Engineering Department of the Polytechnic School of University of Sa?o

Paulo (EPUSP). The relevance and the main characteristics of this approach, also known

as vessel motion-based wave inference (or for short, VMB wave inference) are properly

addressed in the following section.

1.1.2 Relevance of the VMB wave inference method for the in-
dustry

In the 1980s the firsts works assessing the VMB wave inference appeared, e.g. (WEB-

STER; DILLINGHAM, 1981), mainly using short records of data for the analysis. Other

works regarding this research topic were developed during the late 90s and early 2000s,

1Deep water is considered to be anything more than 1500 meters and the top end of ultra deep water
comes at around 2133 meters.

when the computing power available made the adoption of this method practical. These

improvements lead to the first reliable application of the VMB wave inference, carried out

using a container ship with forward speed. A detailed and comprehensive description of

the application of this technique for wave inference in the shipping industry is provided

in (NIELSEN, 2005).

Simultaneously, as it has been pointed out in the previous section, at EPUSP an ex-

tensive research program was being done to assess the use of the floating offshore platform

for on-site VMB wave inference. Due to the central importance of this long-term research

topic, the entire research program was supported by Petrobras in the years followed. In

order to carry out this research, Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) and

semisubmersible type platforms were evaluated as bases for VMB wave inference before

the starting of the research campaign (Fig. 1.6 provides an illustration of both types of

offshore structures). Finally, the former was selected over the later as a consequence of

the following reasons:

• The hydrodynamical properties of the semisubmersible platforms as well as their

massive dimensions result in motions with small or non-significant amplitudes.



9

Hence, it was assumed that this type of platforms will not have the appropriate

behavior for being used as wave sensor. Nevertheless, this assumption (which was

accepted at the moment) was in fact inaccurate as it is shown in this thesis;

• Preceding works on VMB wave inference had been carried out in ship-shaped vessels,

obtaining promising results for a several range of sea conditions;

• At that time, FPSO offshore platforms were already a common type of offshore

platform operated by Petrobras in the Brazilian offshore waters, specially in the

Campos basin.

As a result of this long term research, several works have been published, e.g. (TANNURI

et al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2010, 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2012), where the authors

carried out an assessment of the use of a moored FPSO as a VMB wave sensor. The

results provided in these works (obtained during model-scale and full-scale experimental

campaigns) show that the FPSO type platforms can be used as reliable wave sensors.

Figure 1.6: FPSO Cidade de Ilhabela (left) and semisubmersible P-51 (right). From
(PETROBRAS, 2018).

A common feature of all these VMB wave inference works is the adoption of the

Bayesian inference method to solve the inverse problem, which is by nature ill-conditioned.

The adoption of this statistical approach allows to take into account measurements and

model uncertainties in the inverse problem, avoiding misleading estimations of the un-

known (BERNARDO; SMITH, 2006). Hence, the outcome of the problem (the posterior

distribution of the quantity of interest, in this case the wave spectrum) combines the

information provided by the measured motions of the vessel with relevant available prior

information about the sea conditions. In general, the prior information for VMB wave



10

inference is limited to: (i) assume that the difference between the spectra of the measured

motions and the estimated ones is Gaussian distributed and that (ii) the sea spectrum

inferred must be characterized by a certain level of smoothness (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000).

It is important to highlight that the pertinence of the prior information and its relevance

on the output of the problem is tuned through a set of prior parameters also known as

hyperparameters.

As for the other wave measurement systems, the VMB wave inference is also char-

acterized by some limitations. The major shortcoming of the method is that the vessel

acts as a kind of low-pass filter, filtering the wave components that do not excite the

vessels responses (mainly high frequency ones). Therefore, the larger the vessel, or the

lower its response in waves, the more restricted will be the estimation range. As an il-

lustration of this limitation, when the estimation is based on a very large vessel, such as

a FPSO platform with a VLCC hull, previous studies (BISPO et al., 2016) have shown

that wave conditions may be well captured by the method only for peak periods above 8

seconds. For this reason, the VMB wave inference approach is not intended for provid-

ing broad oceanographic records, but rather to be used as a means for identifying wave

conditions that impose considerable motions on the vessel on which the system is based

on. A possible overcome to this drawback is assessed in (SOUZA et al., 2018), where

the authors combined the Bayesian VMB wave inference and the use of on-board wave

probes; following the technique discussed in (PINKSTER et al., 1978) to measure the

high-order components of the wave spectrum by means of wave gauges installed around

the hull. This combination of different approaches resulted in a novel methodology that

aims at extending the range of wave frequencies that can be estimated through VMB

wave inference, including the high-frequency ones.

In the year 2014, the VMB wave inference research program carried out at University

of Sa?o Paulo (USP) consolidated an important milestone with the starting of an extensive

research project, supported by EQUINOR (ex-STATOIL) in partnership with Petrobras

and the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP). One of the topics envisioned in

this partnership was the assessment of the use of a large semisubmersible platform as a

VMB sea wave sensor. This idea proposed by the EQUINOR’s department of physical

oceanography had as a main objective the inference of extreme sea conditions, that would

induce significant motions on a semisubmersible platform increasing its reliability as VMB



11

inference sensor. This research project also enclosed the assessment of the use of wave-

probes to increase the reliability of the VMB wave inference method in the high frequency-

domain and a two years real scale monitoring campaign in the Peregrino field, located

in the southwest part of the Campos Basin, using the measured motions onboard of the

Peregrino FPSO, which is operated by EQUINOR and its partner Sinochem. Another

improvement related to the project was the development of a fully working graphical user

interface (GUI), that allows an effective operation and control of the VMB wave inference

algorithm. Figure 1.7 provides an example of the developed GUI.

Figure 1.7: GUI of the VMB wave estimation software. From (BISPO et al., 2016).

Regarding the idea proposed by EQUINOR of using a semisubmersible platform as

a VMB wave inference sensor, it was assessed by means of a dedicated model-scale ex-

perimental campaign carried out in the wave basin of the USP’s numerical offshore tank

(TPN-USP) using a scaled model of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform, currently

operating offshore Norway. The results of the tests carried out at the TPN-USP are

presented in this thesis, showing the reliability of this type of platforms for VMB wave



12

inference not only for severe sea conditions but also for mild sea states.

For the reader interested in the results obtained through this project, some publica-

tions already available are (BISPO et al., 2016; MAS-SOLER et al., 2017; SOUZA et al.,

2018) and (MAS-SOLER; SIMOS; TANNURI, 2018).

Summing up, it can be stated that the growing interest in the VMB wave inference

approach comes from the accuracy of the estimations obtained, the technical advantages of

the method as well as the simplicity of the hardware required on-board (mainly composed

by an ordinary set of accelerometers connected to a consumer-level PC, hardware that

the major part of the O&amp;amp;G offshore platforms already have installed on-board). These

practical aspects guarantee a lower initial investment, compared to other technologies,

such as radar systems or wave buoys, and uncomplicated maintenance of the system.

From the point of view of the offshore O&amp;amp;G industry, the use of the VMB wave inference

method has several advantages:

• Ships and offshore platforms can work together to provide worldwide information

about the sea conditions, even from remote areas, at anytime. This feature could

improve the exploration activities in more remote offshore areas as well as in deep

or ultra-deep water oil fields, where other measuring devices may presents some

limitations regarding their installation and operation. The latter application may

have significant importance for the exploration and production activities carried out

offshore the Brazilian coast, where the major oil and gas reservoirs are located in

deep or ultra-deep water conditions;

• VMB wave inference may provide real-time information about the sea condition,

that is crucial for a proper operational management of an offshore platform. In this

case, the use of the VMB wave inference may result in significant improvements

in many offshore activities, such as drilling operations, shuttle tanker operations,

installation of the topsides facilities relative to floating or fixed platforms and in the

assessment of the downtime for production facilities.

As a result, the VMB wave inference has become the object of investigation both in

shipping and the O&amp;amp;G sectors, see for example (MAS-SOLER; SIMOS; TANNURI, 2018;

NIELSEN; BRODTKORB; SØRENSEN, 2018) and (NIELSEN, 2018), as a reference



13

of the last developments attained in this research topic. As a matter of fact, due to the

remarkable results obtained using the inference algorithm developed at EPUSP, Petrobras

has started a new project aiming to test and implement the VMB wave inference software

during its offshore operations.

Finally, it is important to highlight that the main motivations for this thesis not

only come from the general practical advantages of the VMB wave inference but also

from the fact that although a semisubmersible is designed for responding only weakly to

the incoming waves, it will still present significant linear motions in more severe wave

conditions and, in these situations, it may perhaps provide an interesting complement

to the readings of other devices. This would guarantee the reliability and accuracy of

the method even in harsh environmental conditions, that are of important relevance for

offshore projects. Nevertheless, one of the challenges arising from the use of the VMB

wave inference approach to estimate extreme sea conditions is the possible lack of linearity

between the induced motions of the platform and the wave exciting forces. For this reason,

non-linear effects and their implications should be carefully analyzed in order to improve

the robustness of the estimations and avoid misleading inferred sea statistics.

1.2 Objectives

The use of a large semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor is investigated in

the present thesis by means of a dedicated model-scale experimental campaign. In order to

fully understand the major characteristics of the dynamics of a semisubmersible platform

in various sea conditions, ranging from mild to extremely rough sea states, the model of the

system has been set as simple as possible, only including wave exciting forces. Accordingly,

risers or mooring lines have not been modelled during the experimental campaign. The

objectives herein are set aiming at addressing the main motivation referred to in the

previous section.

1. Asses if the Bayesian VMB wave inference method can be used in a robust way to

accurately infere severe wave conditions based on the measured motions of a large

semisubmersible platform.

For this purpose the Bayesian inference approach proposed by Tannuri et al. (2003)



14

has been adopted. Answers to the following questions are sought:

(a) Are the assumptions, regarding the linear excitation-responses (NIELSEN,

2005) along with the properties of the wave spectrum (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000),

valid for the use of a semisubmersible platform as a wave sensor?

(b) Is the procedure adopted by Tannuri et al. (2003) to determine the prior dis-

tribution sufficiently robust to properly control the uncertainties of the model

induced mainly by non-linear effects?

(c) What are the most relevant sea conditions to be tested in the wave basin in

order to provide a reliable evaluation of the use of the semisubmersible platform

as a VMB wave sensor?

(d) Are the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign accurately

estimated through the method?

2. Discuss the selection of the prior distribution and propose an alternative approach

aiming at increasing the accuracy of the estimations.

Regarding this objective, a brief discussion of the different prior distributions has

been conducted, including the approaches adopted in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; NIELSEN,

2008) and (TANNURI et al., 2003). Also, a new prior distribution alternative to

the previous ones is proposed. Through this, answers to the following questions will

be sought:

(a) What are the main characteristics of the various prior distributions in use

nowadays for wave inference?

(b) Which is the most appropriate prior distribution, among the ones compared,

for the current problem?

(c) How can an alternative prior distribution provide practical improvements for

the method?

3. Introduce an appropriate procedure to model the response amplitude operators and

deal with the typical non-linearities of the resonant motions.

Previously, it has been highlighted that one of the challenges arising from using a

semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor to estimate severe sea conditions is



15

that non-linear responses should be properly accounted for. In this regard, answers

to the following questions will be sought:

(a) Which motions are expected to be more sensitive to non-linear effects and how

do they impact the wave estimations?

(b) What are the sources of such non-linearities?

(c) Can the estimations of the VMB wave inference be improved by means of a

simple damping model that account for these non-linearities?

4. Evaluate the limits, in terms of the accuracy of the estimations of the motion-based

wave inference method using the measured motions of a model-scale semisubmersible

platform.

During the experimental campaign only long crested waves have been simulated in

the wave basin. Since these tests do not include current and wind effects, the model

of the platform has been kept as simple as possible, without including submerged

lines (such as risers and mooring lines) nor the topside. However, in extreme sea

conditions, other phenomena, such as wind and current effects, may excite the plat-

form motions. Consequently, the results obtained during the experimental campaign

may be not enough representative for extreme weather conditions. Accordingly, the

answers to the following questions will be sought:

(a) What are the potential effects of other environmental conditions, such as cur-

rent or wind, on the responses of the semisubmersible platform?

(b) Do the submerged lines have a substantial influence on the motions of the

semisubmersible platform within the frequency range of interest?

(c) Are there other limitations of the Bayesian approach when dealing with the

motions of a semisubmersible in a full-scale application, which have not been

considered yet?

1.3 Methodology

The fulfillment of the objectives enumerated in the previous section results in elab-

orated and complex procedures. Thus, it is interesting to provide a general idea of the



16

approach adopted to meet each one of these topics.

1.3.1 The non-parametric approach: The Bayesian VMB wave
inference

Since the main interest is the adoption of the Bayesian VMB wave inference approach,

it is important to validate the relevance of the hypothesis endorsed in this approach when

a semisubmersible platform is adopted as a wave sensor. With this aim, a systemati-

cal review of the literature has been carried out. This assessment mainly consists in a

comprehensive comparison between the hypothesis in the Bayesian VMB wave inference

approach and the theoretical/experimental analysis described in relevant works, such as

(GODA, 2000) and (HAVER; MOAN, 1983).

Concerning the sea conditions tested in the wave basin of the TPN-USP, they range

from mild to extreme sea states. Thus, the resulting test matrix allows the evaluation

of the feasibility of a semisubmersible platform as a wave sensor in a wide range of sea

conditions. Moreover, the features of the water surface elevation time series, which have

been measured by means of wave probes, are evaluated to determine if they are consistent

with the assumptions previously reviewed. It is important to highlight the fact that the

adoption of capacitive waves probes to register the water surfaces elevation guarantees

accurate registers without disturbing the mechanically generated waves.

This approach ensures that the sea conditions generated during the experimental

campaign as well as the model of the semisubmersible paltform are in agreement with the

hypotheses adopted to estimate the sea conditions by means of the bayesian VMB wave

inference technique.

1.3.2 The role of the prior distribution in the Bayesian VMB
wave inference

Previous works estimating the sea conditions by means of the Bayesian VMB wave

inference approach (e.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; NIELSEN, 2005) or (TANNURI et al.,

2003)) have in common the model that describes the dynamic responses of the vessel,

which linearly relates the excitation (in this case the sea state, that is the unknown of

the problem) with the measured motions. However, differences arise between the prior



17

distributions presented in the literature. More precisely, these differences appear between

the number of the prior parameters adopted to estimate the sea state and the approach

followed to estimate their values. In other words, the main difference between these works

has its origin in the relevance given to the prior knowledge and the hypothesis adopted

regarding the wave spectrum.

A dedicated analysis of these differences have been provided in this thesis. Further-

more, the main conclusions obtained from this assessment are evaluated to determine

which prior distribution would be the most appropriate to estimate the sea conditions

using the motions of the semisubmersible platform. It is important to remember that this

approach envisages the identification of the main shortcomings that characterize each

prior distribution, which posteriorly have been taken into account in order to develop a

new prior distribution to overcome them.

1.3.3 Modelling non-linearities of the resonant motions

It has been pointed out that the techniques based on the wave buoy analogy have in

common the approach followed to model the dynamics of the wave sensor, that relates

the excitations with the induced responses through a transfer function. Even though the

approach adopted in the literature already includes some uncertainties of the model by

means of adding a certain amount of noise, it is expected that non-linear effects may

result in misleading estimations.

More precisely, the effects of these non-linearities start to become relevant close the

resonance of the motions, that corresponds to the frequency range where the damping

terms govern the dynamics of the platform. Consequently, the VMB wave inference

approach may render inaccurate estimations of the sea conditions for low frequency sea

waves, where the resonances of the motions appear.

In order to determine the linear model and also take account of these non-linearities

the following approach is followed.

• The transfer functions adopted to model the dynamics of the platform have been

obtained in the frequency-domain using a diffraction analysis, which characterizes

the primary hydrodynamic parameters of the platform. The resulting transfer func-



18

tions can be improved adopting a representative constant damping value for each

motion, thus leading to bounded responses of the platform close its resonances. The

damping values used in this work have been estimated empirically, using the data

obtained during the calibration tests carried out at the wave basin in TPN-USP.

• A sensitive analysis of the possible damping effects arising from the submerged

lines (moorings &amp;amp; risers) has been carried out through numerical simulations in

ANSYS-AQWA. These simulations compare the responses of the model without

the submerged lines (as it is tested in the wave basin) with the responses of a

quasi complete model, that includes the submerged lines (mooring and risers). It

is important to remember that due to the nature of the problem being solved, non-

linear effects only have been evaluated for the motions that present their resonance

in the wave frequency range of interest.

• A theoretical approach is followed to develop a simple model that estimates the

damping effects on the heave motion. This model is based on the hydrodynamic

drag forces acting on the pontoons and provides the damping of the motion in accor-

dance with the measured amplitudes. Thus, the response amplitude functions can be

upgraded constantly using the amplitude of the motions measured. Also, the relia-

bility of the approach proposed to estimate the external damping has been analyzed

by means of a comparison between the results obtained through this methodology

and the experimental measurements.

1.3.4 Assessing the accuracy of the VMB wave inference method-
ology based on a semisubmersible platform

In order to estimate the sea conditions generated in the wave basin in the TPN-USP

the measured motions of a model-scale semisubmersible platform have been adopted.

These motions are recorded through an optical tracking system, which guarantees accurate

recordings of the model motions. Since the responses of all the six degrees of freedom (dofs)

have been recorded, the linearity of the responses is assessed by means of the coherence

functions to determine the most convenient base of motions for the wave inference.

At the same time, the measurements obtained during the experimental campaign

through the wave probes have been used as a paradigm to validate the numerical char-



19

acterization of the semisubmersible platform model as well as the estimations obtained

through the VMB wave inference.

1.4 Text structure

The contents of the thesis have been organized into six chapters, including the present

one. Chapter 2 is devoted to a review of the literature concerning the existing motion-

based wave inference methodologies. Chapter 3 provides a brief analysis of the stochastic

description of the sea states and the hypotheses assumed to compute the motion re-

sponses of the platform. The contents of this chapter are also linked to appendices A, B

and C, which include a detailed analysis regarding various statistical properties of the sea

conditions generated in the wave basin and their extrapolation to real-scale. Moreover,

appendix D brings an assessment of the heave responses of a semisubmersible platform.

Chapter 4 contains a detailed description of the Bayesian inference approach and the

main hypothesis adopted; also, the main inference methods adopted in this work are ex-

plained systematically, including the development of an alternative prior distribution for

wave inference. The contents of this chapter are associated with appendix E, that aims

at providing a broader understanding of the features of the prior distribution. Chapter 5

includes the description of the model-scale experimental campaign carried out in the wave

basin of the TPN-USP, using a scaled model of a large semisubmersible platform (content

that is related to appendix F). This chapter also presents the results of the estimations

obtained using the motion-based Bayesian inference method, that were checked against

the measurements obtained by means of an array of wave-probes. Finally, chapter 6 is

a summary of the main conclusions reached through this work, that are complemented

with recommendations for future work.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW

In general, there are several approaches that may be considered for performing wave

inference based on the recorded motions of a vessel (see Nielsen (2017) for a recent review).

As a first option, the wave spectrum can be estimated on a parametric approach. This

method is used to estimate the sea conditions from directional buoy measurements. The

main advantage that this technique has is that it is conceptually simple and it is based

on the parametric representation of the directional sea spectrum. Some examples of

this method are provided in: (HUA; PALMQUIST, 1994), where the authors adopted

a variational method to estimate the optimal values of the spectrum parameters using

the full-scale data measurements carried out on a ro/ro ship. Another work based in

this approach is presented by Tannuri et al. (2003), who used the data from on-board

motion measurements of a moored FPSO and the directional sea spectrum estimations

were obtained by means of a parametric model.

The parametric modelling has gained increasing attention in recent years. For ex-

ample, in (MONTAZERI; NIELSEN, 2014) the authors used the parametric approach to

estimate the directional wave spectrum, fitting a standard JONSWAP spectrum, from full-

scale response measurements carried out on a container ship. One additional example of

the parametric modelling approach can be found in (MONTAZERI; NIELSEN; JENSEN,

2015), which presented a methodology that upgraded the estimation procedure by means

of introducing the trends identified in the parameters of the wave spectrum model. These

trends were identified in an analysis that was carried out in parallel with the main wave

inference estimation routine. In this work the authors obtained good agreement between

the estimations and wave radar measurements of the sea state. Finally, (MONTAZERI;

NIELSEN; JENSEN, 2016) stands as another recent work in which a parametric model

was adopted for estimating wind seas and swells based on measured ship motions.



21

Alternatively, another line of works proposes the estimation of the directional wave

spectrum based on non-parametric methods. The inference is then made using the wave

buoy analogy, which relies on a comparison between measurements of response spectra

and calculated ones. (WEBSTER; DILLINGHAM, 1981) is one of the first studies es-

timating the directional wave spectrum using on-board measured ship motions. In this

case the wave spectrum was estimated using a linear programming approach. Thus, the

methodology proposed provided accurate estimations in the frequency range where the re-

sponse amplitude operators of the ship were linear and had some directional dependence.

Another example is provided by Hirayama (1987), where the sea spectrum was computed

by means of the Maximum Likelihood Method, based on the real-scale measured ship

motions. A current example of this approach is provided in (NIELSEN; GALEAZZI;

BRODTKORB, 2016), where the authors evaluated a novel concept for wave estimation

adopting the wave buoy analogy using model-scale measurements. The approach adopted

in this case was formulated directly in the time-domain combining different techniques

and the least squares fitting to estimate wave amplitude and phase. The results obtained

during the study showed that the statistical parameters were accurately estimated when

compared with the measurements obtained through waves probes.

Regarding the directional wave spectrum estimation based on the so-called VMB

Bayesian modelling, it was proposed in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), for a ship with forward

speed. In order to validate the technique proposed, towing tank experiments and on-

board measurements were carried out by the authors. This approach has been adopted

also by Nielsen (2006), who presented derivations of both parametric and non-parametric

theories. The theories for both methods were applied in order to obtain the directional

wave spectrum using the motions of a container ship. The estimations obtained with

these methods were compared to measurements made by a wave radar , obtaining good

agreement between both approaches. The same researcher carried out a detailed study

(NIELSEN, 2007) of numerical simulations of wave records, providing an estimation of

the sea state parameters. In his work, two approaches were considered: The parametric

procedure and the non-parametric one. The paper finally concluded that it is difficult

to favor a particular method since both render similar results. A common feature of

the Bayesian wave inference approach as adopted in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), (NIELSEN,

2006) and (NIELSEN, 2007), is that the prior distribution is computed using the Akaike’s



22

Bayesian Information Criterion (AKAIKE, 1980). However, Iseki (2012) showed that this

approach may not provide optimal values for the prior parameters, for sea conditions

for which non-linear effects begin to be relevant and, consequently, the uncertainties

associated to the response amplitude operators are increased.

Following a similar approach, (SIMOS et al., 2010) presented a complete analysis of

the sea states estimated from the motions of a model-scale FPSO. These estimations were

performed using the Bayesian inference method with three prior parameters, analogous to

the method proposed by Nielsen (2008), but with a relevant conceptual change. Different

from the original proposal where the hyperparameters were estimated by means of the

ABIC method (TANNURI et al., 2003), the authors set a pre-calibration of these hyper-

parameters, meaning that their values were prescribed for each wave estimation. From a

conceptual point of view, although the mathematical structure of the Bayesian model was

preserved, an important feature of the Bayesian approach was abandoned, i.e. the adop-

tion of an information criterion for searching the best calibration of the prior parameters

in each estimation event. A detailed description of the procedure followed to calibrate

these hyperparameters can be found in (BISPO, 2011a) and in (BISPO, 2011b). This

approach led to a much more expedite estimation procedure while the results obtained in

the experimental campaign attested that the wave conditions could still be inferred with

good accuracy.

Later, Simos et al. (2012) utilized full-scale data measurements from a FPSO oper-

ating in Brazil’s Campos basin for a first evaluation of the performance of this method

in field conditions. However, due to the lack of alternative wave sensors, the compar-

ison of the results was made almost exclusively with hindcast measurements provided

by NOAA for the same region where the FPSO was operating. The authors concluded

that the method was capable of inferring the sea states with a good agreement with the

NOAA measurements, despite the inherent limitations concerning the estimation of sea

states with low peak periods. Bispo et al. (2016) provide another feasibility study of

the methodology proposed in (SIMOS et al., 2010); for this purpose the first part of the

results from a new field campaign, started in December 2014, was presented. Again, re-

sults were obtained from full-scale FPSO motions using the Bayesian inference approach

with three pre-calibrated hyperparameters. The performance of the VMB wave inference

method is checked against the wave estimations provided by a commercial marine radar



23

system. Comparison between both systems attest an adequate identification of the wave

conditions.

Assessing the feasibility of a semisubmersible platform as a motion based wave sensor

is the main general objective of this thesis. This topic was first investigated by Wijaya

(2009). In order to validate the hypothesis that a semisubmersible platform can be used

as a VMB wave sensor, his work was mostly based on model-scale tests of the A?sgard-B

semisubmersible platform, which has also been adopted as a case-study for this thesis.

The tests assessed in Wijaya (2009) were conducted in the Marintek facilities with the

model subjected to waves, wind and currents. Since the experimental campaign was car-

ried out under combined environmental conditions (waves, wind and current), the model

of the platform included the submerged lines (riser and moorings) as well the topside.

Nevertheless, only a short range of wave conditions was evaluated due to the fact that the

analysis was based on a set of final design tests. The author also assessed some full-scale

results but these were limited because concerned a short period of time and only included

mild wave conditions. With regard to the modelling approach followed, the estimation

of the sea spectrum was obtained using the parametric modelling. In order to properly

evaluate the accuracy of the results obtained with this inference approach, model-scale

results were compared to measurements obtained in the wave basin. Measurements from

wave radar and buoy were adopted as the paradigm for the full-scale estimations. In

general, the author concluded that the results, for model-scale and real-scale, shown good

agreement with the measurements of the significant wave height. Nevertheless, the author

pointed out that significant discrepancies regarding the mean direction and peak period

were noticeable. Also, some deviations (over-estimation) can be observed for the inferred

values of the significant wave height. Finally, as a consequence of the discrepancies re-

ported between the estimations and the measurements, the author concluded that further

research should be conducted in order to determine if a semisubmersible platform can be

adopted as a VMB wave sensor.

In the present study, a scaled model of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible unit was built,

and tested in a large set of experimental conditions at the wave basin in the TPN-USP

wave basin. They were specifically conceived for verifying the feasibility of performing the

VMB wave inference estimations, putting a special emphasis on severe wave conditions,

and its frequency range limitations when this type of offshore platforms is adopted as a



24

wave sensor.

On the other hand, further attention should be paid to the mathematical basis of

the problem, which, in principle, consists of an inverse problem in which the input (sea

spectrum) has to be estimated from the measured output data (floater motions), by means

of the Bayesian modelling approach. The conventional methodology adopted in the works

described above does not include the inherent uncertainties in the estimates of the ship

response functions. A first step in this attempt was made by Iseki (2012), who addressed

this challenge with an error matrix, composed of products of the response functions and

the estimation errors, achieving a modified Gaussian stochastic linear regression model

by the summation of the RAO matrix and the error matrix (C).

Full-scale ship motion data was used to validate the modified Bayesian procedure

proposed, and Iseki (2012) showed that this alternative approach provides improved esti-

mations of the different sea conditions and increases the reliability of the hyperparameters

estimated by means of the ABIC.

This thesis includes several references to other wave monitoring systems, such as buoys

and marine radar systems. Although the study and characterization of these systems are

not in the scope of this work, a brief review is needed, regarding the mathematical models

commonly adopted and their main drawbacks. Traditionally, wave measurements have

been carried out by means of directional wave buoys. These are floating devices equipped

with different measuring systems (including accelerometers and inclinometers). Thus,

wave measurements can be obtained using the recorded signals of the measuring sys-

tems. Usually, the approach followed to estimate the sea spectrum characteristics is the

parametrical modelling, see for example (HASSELMANN; DUNCKEL; EWING, 1980)

or (ALLENDER et al., 1989). The possible drawbacks of this measurement system have

been described in chapter 1. In addition to directional wave buoys, wave radar systems

have gained notorious popularity as a wave monitoring system. In general, they pro-

vide accurate measurements and information about the sea spectrum in a wide frequency

range. However, in extreme sea conditions, as it has been pointed out before, these sys-

tems may present different shortcomings (MAGNUSSON, 2008) that generate imprecise

measurements of the wave heights and the energy distribution. One may realize that both

systems have a common shortcoming regarding the inaccurate estimations of extreme sea



25

conditions, that leads to divergent inferred values for the same sea conditions. Accord-

ingly, the recover of reliable estimations of the sea spectrum characteristics in extreme sea

states is one of the main motivations to use a large semisubmersible platform as a VMB

wave sensor, as discussed by Wijaya (2009).

Finally, it should be stressed that this section has not included a detailed review of

the works related to the Bayesian inference approach; this is due to the fact that the most

prominent literature references have been included in the bulk text of section 4, where

the method fundamentals are also covered.

3 LINEAR MODELLING OF OCEAN WAVES

AND WAVE INDUCED RESPONSES OF

FLOATING OFFSHORE STRUCTURES

3.1 Introduction

Since the methodology investigated in the present thesis aims to determine the sea

conditions based on the platform motions, the accuracy of the output is associated with

the hypotheses and simplifications regarding the wave description and the responses of

the floating platform. In particular, this technique is strongly sensitive to the precision

of the model adopted to estimate the vessel responses. For this reason, this chapter aims

at providing a brief review of the hypotheses and properties related to the description of

ocean waves and the induced responses of the vessel.

3.2 Description of ocean waves

The proper description of ocean waves is of interest to the dynamics of ships and

offshore structures. In normal conditions the sea surface comprises a large number of waves

with different lengths, heights and directions. As a direct result of this heterogeneity, the

water surface elevation cannot be described by means of a deterministic mathematical

expression. A common approach adopted to describe the sea surface elevation is to assume

that it is given by the superposition of many simple, regular wave components, each one

with its own amplitude, length, frequency and direction of propagation. This concept (also

known as the superposition principle) was first adopted in (DENIS; PIERSON, 1953) to

describe the behavior of the sea surface in terms of a simple theory of regular waves.

Regarding the characterization of regular waves, it is based on major waves theories,

such as Airy linear wave theory, that were developed during the 19th century. The re-



27

sults of these theories are also of central importance for solving the seakeeping problem.

Therefore, the most relevant definitions and theory used to describe the regular waves are

discussed in the following section. In this case, due to the fact that only a brief review

is provided, the reader is referred to (NEWMAN, 1977) for a detailed and systematical

description of the theory and formulae.

3.2.1 Regular waves

Figure 3.1 shows the main features and characteristics adopted to define the regular

waves. As a matter of fact, this figure provides the wave profile, ?, accordingly to the

distance, x, for a given instant of time, t. It is worth remembering that the coordinate

system is placed at the still water level (SWL) with the y-axis directed upward and the

x-axis is positive in the direction of wave propagation.

Figure 3.1: Harmonic wave definitions.

Even though the regular wave constitutes the simplest component of an irregular sea,

some assumptions are still needed to develop a theory that describes it. In the following,

the assumptions in which this approach is based are provided.

1. The flow is assumed to be 2-dimensional;

2. The flow can be described by the velocity potential, ?;

3. The flow can be considered as irrotational flow, i.e. vorticity ?× u = 0. It is

important to remember that this condition does not apply where flow separation

occurs;



28

4. Fluid motion in the ocean can be assumed as a potential flow, which is formally

characterized by:

• The velocity can be described in terms of a scalar potential,

u(x,y,z,t) = ??(x,y,z,t) , (3.1)

• The velocity potential must fulfil the following form of the continuity equation,

also known as the Laplace equation, given by,

?2? = 0 , (3.2)

• The resulting momentum equation is,

p(x,y,z,t)

?
= ?

??

? t
?

1

2
|??|2 ?gy . (3.3)

where p is the pressure and ? and g stand for the density of the water and the

gravity constants, respectively.

5. Small wave amplitudes are assumed: This hypothesis is equivalent to state that

A
?
&lt;&amp;lt;1. Thus, resulting in ?

?2 T
&lt;&amp;lt;1.

Therefore, the problem is reduced to solve the Laplace equation for the velocity potential,

given certain boundary conditions (BCs). This linear description of the propagation

gravity waves is commonly known as the linearized (Airy) wave theory.

Regarding the BCs, deep water condition is assumed1, that is equivalent to set ?? ?

0, for y ? ??. This condition has been adopted due to the fact that it results in a

simple solution of the velocity potential, which equally illustrates the main assumptions

and simplifications adopted in this theory. Again, (NEWMAN, 1977) is provided as the

main reference for a detailed review of the problem including the BC for y = ?H.

Now, it is necessary to describe the behavior of the free surface. For this purpose two

different BCs are endorsed:

1. Kinematic BC: It is assumed that the normal component of water velocity at water

surface is the same as the normal component of the velocity of the surface. In other

1In the linear wave theory the water conditions are considered to be deep if the water depth, H, is
more than half the wave length, ?, so: H

?
&gt; 1

2
or ?

H
&amp;lt;2.



29

words, this BC is equivalent to accept that water particles at the surface stay on

the free surface and that the flow has to be tangential at the free surface. Formally,

this condition is given by,

??

? t
=
??

? y
? u ·?? . (3.4)

2. Dynamic BC: The pressure on the both sides of the surface is equal. Which is

equivalent to assume that in the free surface the hydrodynamic pressure (p) equals

the atmospheric pressure (pa). This relation can be expressed by means of the

momentum equation,

?
1

?
(p?pa) =

??

? t
+

2
[?? ·??] + g? = 0 , (3.5)

Now, in virtue of the small amplitude assumption (A
?
&lt;&amp;lt;1), it can be shown

that slopes of the wave profile, i.e.
??

? x
, are small quantities compared to one.

Moreover, the derivatives of the velocity potential are small first order-quantities, as

a consequence of the fact that the fluid velocity can be assumed as a small quantity

proportional to the wave motion. Therefore, the non-linear terms in Eqs. (3.4)

and (3.5) can be neglected. In such conditions, the resulting formal expressions of

the linearized BCs are,

Before taking any further steps, it is important to highlight that the resulting BCs



30

adopted to describe the behavior of the sea surface are characterized by two linearizing

hypothesis: (i) non-linear terms of the dynamic BC have been omitted (thus, highlighting

the importance of the hypothesis of small wave amplitudes) and (ii) the BCs are applied

at y = 0 (SWL) and not to y = ?(x,t).

The straightforward velocity potential that fulfils the Laplace equation as well as the

BCs described is given by,

? =
gA

?
eky sin(kx?? t) . (3.9)

where k stands for the wave number and ? for the wave frequency. Thus, the general

form of the free surface elevation can be expressed as,

?(x,t) = A cos(k x?? t) . (3.10)

As it was stated previously, the relevance of this theory is well illustrated by the prin-

ciple adopted to describe the irregular waves, which allows the representation of irregular

times series of the sea surface elevation as the result of the linear superposition of many

(regular) waves, each one with different phase shift, ?i, amplitude and frequency. This

linearization can be formally expressed as,

?(x,t) =
N?
i=1

?i =
N?
i=1

Ai cos(ki x??it + ?i) . (3.11)

where each ?i is derived by means of combining Eq. (3.7) and (3.9). For instance, the

regular waves included in Eq. (3.11) can be characterized using the theory discussed in

this section. A detailed review of the main methodology followed to characterize the

ocean surface elevation is provided in the following.

3.2.2 Irregular waves

The reader must be already aware of the fact that the description of the ocean waves

is a topic of major significance for the purpose of this thesis. An analysis regarding the

background of the regular waves has been provided in the previous section. This method-

ology, however, does not characterize the sea surface elevation by itself. Altogether, it



31

has been discussed that the sea surface is a non-deterministic process in space and time,

thus the probabilistic approach is commonly adopted in order to describe its main char-

acteristics. The major fundamentals of the approach discussed hereafter are thoroughly

described in the literature, e.g. (BISHOP; PRICE, 1979) or (GODA, 2000).

In order to obtain a realistic idea of the wave forces acting on offshore structures, the

sea surface elevation is considered as a time-space dependent random process (GODA,

2000). An illustration of the statistical characteristics of this process has been provided

in appendix A, which consists of an analysis of a sinusoidal wave as a random process.

However, the characterization of a random process is relatively complex. Considering

the properties discussed in appendix A, the sea surface elevation can be assumed as a

stationary, homogeneous and ergodic random process2. As a result of these hypotheses,

the probability density function of the surface elevation is the same for different records,

given that the statistical properties remain constant for any (sufficiently long) time span

and location.

These assumptions make it possible to characterize the sea condition from a single

wave record. The common approach is the use of power spectral density (PSD) estimators,

which are based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the wave record and that are in

accordance with the model described in Eq. (3.11). In sea wave analysis, the use of the

FFT stands as the most practical way to estimate the PSD, providing good frequency

resolution. However, the ideal method should provide high resolution regarding rapid

temporal changes in analytic state variables for frequency, phase and amplitude. These

characteristics of the analysis can be obtained, for example, by means of the Hilbert

Transform. It has to be said, however, that both methods give similar results when

applied to signals having relatively long durations, as is the case in sea wave analysis. As

a consequence of the similarity of the outputs when applied to signals that are relatively

long and for practical purposes, in this thesis the power spectral density estimations will

be computed using models based on the FFT of the measurements.

The description of the wave energy distribution over the frequency and direction

ranges is provided by the directional energy wave density spectrum, S??(?,?), which

stands as an statistical characteristic of the sea. Then, the energy density (per unit area

spectrum as follows,

E = ?g

? 2?

S??(?,?)d?d? , (3.12)

Returning to the Fourier analysis, it widely known that it allows the description of the

surface elevation as the sum of infinite waves for all possible combinations of frequencies in

Nk directions, leading to the Longuet-Higgins model (see, once again, appendix A) which

is similar to the one presented in Eq. (3.11) to describe the irregular wave elevation,

?(x, t) =

Nk?
j=1

N????
i=1

Aji cos(kji · x ??i t + ?i) , (3.13)

where the wave number vector kji = ki(cos(?j), sin(?j)) has magnitude ki and the ran-

domness of the process is obtained by means of random phases, ?i. Therefore, making

use of the central limit theorem, it is assumed that the sea surface elevation has a normal

distribution.

Accordingly, the energy density can be computed as the sum of the energy of the wave

components of Eq. (3.13),

E = ?g

which provides a relation between the sea energy spectrum and the amplitudes of the

waves that compose it. Thus, the following equivalence exists between S??(?,?) and the

amplitudes of the individual regular waves,

The assumptions adopted regarding the sea surface (it is stationary, narrow banded

and Gaussian distributed) allow the adoption of the Rayleigh distribution to characterize

the probability of the wave amplitude. A comprehensive discussion of the Rayleigh distri-

bution and how it is related to the Normal probability distribution function is provided



33

in (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010)3.

As it has been pointed out earlier, the spectral density function allows the statistical

characterization of any sea state and it is usually described in a parametric way based on

some statistical parameters of the waves. Some common ones are provided herein.

3This model is correct when the number of waves components tends to infinity (see Goda (2000)).
However, a common practice is to obtain the sea conditions using a finite number of sinusoidal waves,
producing series that have their variance bounded and, consequently, that are neither Gaussian nor
ergodic (TUCKER; CHALLENOR; CARTER, 1984). Notwithstanding this, it is widely known that the
statistical distribution of the individual wave heights is well approximated by a Rayleigh distribution.
Thus, herein an analysis is provided, regarding the expected distribution of S??(fi) = S??i and its
variance, when the number of components in the Longuet-Higgins model tends to infinity.

Let s??i :=
1
2
A2 = S??(fi)? fi. Also, it is now known that A is Rayleigh distributed, thus its probability

density function can be written as,

pdf(A) =
A

?2
exp

(
?
A2

)
,

The change-of-variable technique can be used as follows,

pdf(A)dA = pdf(s??i )ds??i , where
dA

ds??i
=

1

A
,

Leading to,

pdf(s??i ) =
1

?2
exp

(
?
s??i

)
,

Therefore, s??i has an exponential distribution. Regarding the variance, following (OCHI, 1990) it can
be rewritten as,

Var(s??i ) = E[(s??i )
2] ?E2[s??i ] = ?

4 ,

Thus the coefficient of variation is,

CoV(s??i ) =

(
Var(s??i )

E2[s??i ]

)1
2

= 1 ,

Meaning that the standard deviation of an exponential distribution is equal to its mean. Finally, if the
spectrum, S??, is estimated from a real Gaussian process,

E[S??i ] =
?2

? f
= S??i .

where S??i is the averaged spectrum of the spectra, S, for the i
th frequency, obtained for each realization,

?(t), of the same process.
But, in this ideal condition the coefficient of variation is 1 (CoV(S??i ) = 1), for a ? f = const.
For the analysis of practical (time-limited) wave records this quantity provides a measurement of the

expected variance of each component of the spectrum. In order to have a clear idea of the origin of this
variance a brief explanation is provided. A random process can be featured by a continuous spectrum,
in other words, the measured signal (recorded over a extremely long period of time) is the result of the
sum of a large number of components closely spaced in frequency and with random phases. If a short
record of the signal is now taken, each harmonic of the spectrum splits its energy amongst the adjacent
components of the spectrum, as described in (SHIN; HAMMOND, 2008). Therefore, each harmonic is
given by a large number of contributions which are random in phase. Thus, the amplitude of a particular
harmonic is to some extent random. Consequently, the analysis of different records of the same signal
is expected to result in a fluctuation of the amplitude of the harmonics from analysis to analysis. This

measure of the energy of the sea spectrum. However, this quantity, by itself, does not

provide information regarding the energy distribution in the frequency range.

Such distribution is described by means of statistical wave periods. Most common

periods are:

Peak Period

This period, Tp, is the wave period with the highest energy.

Mean Wave Period

The mean wave period, T1, is defined as the mean value of all wave periods in a wave

record representing a certain sea state. This period is associated to the frequency that

corresponds to the spectral centroid of the wave spectrum and it can be estimated as,

Additionally, the expected value of the zero up-crossing period stands for the average

period of zero-crossing waves. It can be associated to the frequency that represents the

radius of gyration around ? = 0 of the area under the spectrum and its value is computed

by means of the zeroth and second order spectral moments as shown below,

Figure 3.2 provides an illustration of the wave spectrum (in the period domain) and

some of the statistical parameters discussed, i.e. the Peak period, Mean wave period and

Mean zero up-crossing period.

period.

In section 1.1.2, it has been pointed out that the vessel may be intended as a kind

of low-pass filter, filtering the wave components that do not excite the vessels responses.

This results in one of the major limitations that the VMB wave inference method presents.

Consequently, the mean wave period has been used in different works as a measure of the

accuracy of the estimation, e.g. (SIMOS et al., 2010, 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016).

Unlike Tp, this statistical parameter is more sensitive to the energies placed in the high

frequency range and allows an accurate assessment of the inferred sea conditions.

3.2.2.1 Note on standard wave spectrum models

The sea states are generally characterized by their PSD. A common approach is to

adopt a standard wave spectrum model among the ones that are used to represent the

power spectral density in the frequency-domain, S??(?). There are various idealized spec-

tra that are used nowadays in oceanography and ocean engineering. Perhaps the simplest



36

is that proposed in (PIERSON; WILLARD; MOSKOWITZ, 1964), also known as the

Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum. Other commonly adopted wave spectra are

the Bretschneider (BS) wave spectrum (BRETSCHNEIDER, 1959) and the JONSWAP

(HASSELMANN; DUNCKEL; EWING, 1980) wave spectrum. Furthermore, some of

these standard wave spectra allow the adjustment of the wave energy distribution through

the bandwidth by means of different parameters. Thus, leading to sea spectra that present

broader or narrower energy distribution of the ocean waves in accordance with the devel-

opment stage that sea being modelled presents.

Regarding the directional wave spectrum, S??(?,?), it can be obtained by multiplying

the PSD, S??(?), by a directional spread function, D(?,?). This functional represents the

directional distribution of wave energy. As an example, the Mitsuyasu type directional

spreading function is provided next (GODA, 2000). Mathematically, it is given by,

S??(?,?) = S??(?) D(?,?) , (3.19)

D(?,?) = G(s) cos2s

?
?? ??0

2

?
? . (3.20)

where the parameter s determines the directional spread of the spectrum and ?0 stands

as the main direction. The function G(s) is only a normalizing factor used to guarantee

an unitary integral, thus, it must fulfil the following condition,

G(s) ?
? 2?

0

D(?,?)d? = 1 . (3.21)

For illustrative purposes, Fig. 3.3 provides an example for the directional spread func-

tion and the PSD. The combination of this spread function and a JONSWAP wave spec-

trum (with Hs = 1m and Tp = 14s) leads to the directional wave spectrum shown in

Fig. 3.4. It is worth to remember that knowledge of the directional distribution of the

energy of sea waves is still limited because of the difficulty in making reliable field mea-

surements and, as a consequence, the establishment of a standard functional form for the

directional wave spectrum has not been achieved yet, in contrast to the case of the PSD,

S??(?). Therefore, the functionals commonly adopted to model the directional energy



37

distribution are adapted to a limited database of measurements and basically consider

a smooth distribution of the energy, including different parameters to set how wide the

peak of the wave spectrum must be.

Figure 3.4: Example of directional energy spectrum.

The approach described above reflects the methodology adopted traditionally to char-

acterize the sea states, resulting in directional wave spectra that are regarded as unimodal

(with energy concentrated mainly on the wind direction). However, field measurements



38

have already demonstrated that the energy of short waves tends to be accumulated along

two or more off-wind directions, generating double (or multiple) directional distributions.

Several works, e.g. (OCHI; HUBBLE, 1977; GARCIA-GABIN, 2015; TOFFOLI et al.,

2010) and (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004), provide a detailed discussion and char-

acterization of these bimodal directional wave spectra. Accordingly, some spectral models

have been developed to give a realistic approach for double peak cases in the frequency-

domain, such as the bimodal spectral model formulated in (OCHI; HUBBLE, 1977) (which

is an extension of the BS wave spectrum) and the model developed in (TORSETHAU-

GEN, 1993), which are referred as Ochi-Hubble and Torsethaugen wave spectrum repec-

tively.

In this thesis, the assessment of the use of a semisubmersible platform as a motion

based wave sensor has been carried out using a scale model of the A?sgard-B semisub-

mersible platform (see section 1.1.2). Therefore, aiming at generating compelling results,

the sea spectrum models adopted to generate the irregular sea in the wave basin cor-

respond to: The JONSWAP and Torsethaugen wave spectra, which stand as the most

representative wave spectrum models for the sea condition observed in the Norwegian con-

tinental shelf. Although these spectra are widely documented in the literature, a succinct

description of their formulae is provided in appendix C.

Moreover, Fig. 3.5 shows a comparison between the Torsethaugen spectrum and JON-

SWAP spectrum for the same sea condition, with significant wave height equal to 1m and

spectral peak period of 12.6s. From this figure, one may realize that the main difference

between these spectrum models is the energy distribution along the wave frequency axis.

On the one hand, the energy is concentrated near the peak of the spectrum in the JON-

SWAP model and less on frequencies further away from the peak. On the other hand,

Torsethaugen spectrum is a bimodal sea spectrum composed by a swell (energy around the

peak in the low frequency range) and locally generated wind waves (energy components

given in the high frequency range).

In order to illustrate the quantitative differences between the JONSWAP and the

Torsethaugen spectrum Tab. 3.1 provides some statistical characteristics of these spectra

for different sea conditions. In this case, the Torsethaugen characteristics have been

normalized by the correspondent statistical features of the JONSWAP wave spectrum,

for the same sea condition. The statistics provided include the variance of the wave train

given by the area under the spectrum (m0), the mean wave period (T1) and the median

wave period, or T1
2
. Concerning the median wave period, it is related to the frequency that

exactly divides the spectrum into two equal parts (in the frequency-domain). Therefore,

this period also provides meaningful information of the energy distribution being, at the

same time, less sensitive to the extreme values than T1. The period, T1

It is worth remembering that in this thesis the area calculation for each wave spectrum

has been done by integrating the wave spectrum curve by means of a trapezoidal method.

The results provided in Tab. 3.1 show that JONSWAP wave spectrum has a slightly

smaller area if compared with the Torsethaugen spectrum. Such differences have also

been reported in other works, e.g. (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004) and (WIJAYA,

2009). The origin of these differences may be explained, for moderate and high sea states,

by the fact that the high frequency tail of the simplified Torsethaugen spectrum model

seems to fall off slower (it is proportional to the ?4 exponential) than the reference spec-



40

trum. Therefore, for the simplified model of the Torsethaugen spectrum proposed in

(TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004), narrow differences between the outputs are consid-

ered acceptable when the same sea condition is modelled through different wave spectrum

models. Regarding the mean wave period and the median wave period, Torsethaugen

spectrum always provides lower values than JONSWAP, as expected, due to the fact that

the energy is usually concentrated in the high frequency range. Finally, another feature

of the statistics provided is the fact that median period is always greater than the mean

period, as expected.

The points addressed above would constitute a basic description of the probabilistic

approach, introducing the reader to the fundamentals of the probabilistic characterization

of the ocean waves. However, some questions remain unanswered, such as which is the

ideal time duration of the recorded wave signal to estimate the sea spectrum? and how

does the time duration of the records affect the repeatability of the same sea spectrum?

There are some works, as for example (GODA, 2000) and (MELLO, 2005), that ana-

lyze this topic and attempt to provide an appropriate methodology to estimate the ideal

sample time. Nevertheless, the procedures proposed have some limitations regarding the

bandwidth of the sea spectrum, specially when it comes to bimodal wave spectra. Since

this thesis does not aim at providing a systematic analysis of the probabilistic techniques

to describe the ocean waves, a discussion regarding these points has been included in



41

appendix B, along with a guideline to define the optimal sample time for each event (sea

condition).

3.3 Ship motions in waves

The main aspects of the linear modelling of floating vessel motions are described in

the following. For a detailed derivation and description of the forces and moments acting

on the floating body in waves the reader is referred to (NEWMAN, 1977).

First of all, the main assumptions adopted to develop the linear modelling of the ship

motions are given by:

1. When defining wave excitation, the same linear model is used as when describing

the linear wave theory, i.e. waves are assumed to have a low amplitude and slopes;

2. The motions of the floating vessel (ship/platform) are assumed small;

3. Hydrostatic forces and moments are represented by initial stability approximation

(this assumption can be assumed as a consequence of the previous one);

4. Potential flow model is used, or in other words, the flow model is inviscid and

irrotational.

5. The boundary layer must be thin enough to guarantee that the outer pressure

(estimated by means of the potential flow model) stands as a good approximation for

the pressure acting on the body’s surface (the hull of the vessel, in our case). In order

to guarantee this condition high Reynolds Number are required (in typical marine

engineering applications this requirement is fulfilled) as well as a small Keulegan-

Carpenter number5, which ensures that separation effects can be neglected in the

most general cases;

6. The quantities used to describe interaction between the hull and water are indepen-

dent upon the motions.

Regarding the equations of motion of the floating system, they can be derived using the

second Newton’s law,

5Section 3.3.1 provides a systematical description of this quantity.



42

?
F = M?? , (3.23)

where ? = [? x,? y,? z,? ?,? ?,? ?]T are amplitudes of the vessel motions and M is mass

and inertia moment matrix. Concerning the forces acting on the system, they are given

by:

1. The pressure force, Fp, which can be decomposed as (see (NEWMAN, 1977) and

(FALTINSEN, 1993)):

• The so-called Froude-Krylov excitation term: That estimates the force that

would be exerted on a fixed body by the incident waves (the vessel does not

affect the incoming wave and resulting flow);

• A second term also known as the diffraction part: This component takes into

account the wave deformation due to the vessel presence.

It should be emphasized that this decomposition of the resulting forces acting on

the floating platform is possible due to the assumption of small wave amplitudes

and slope, and small body displacements around a reference point. Moreover, for

long waves6 the Froude-Krylov forces are dominant meanwhile in short waves both

terms must be considered.

2. Another component of the hydrodynamic forces acting on a floating vessel is the

radiation term, referred in the following as Fh. Cummins (1962) showed that the

(radiation-induced) hydrodynamic forces in an ideal fluid can be related to a added

mass, a, and a potential damping, B.

3. Finally, the equations of motion are completed by the total static linearized forces,

which include the forces due to the body weight, Fhs.

Thus, Eq. (3.23) can be rewritten as,

Fp + Fh + Fhs = M?? , (3.24)

6The relation between the wave length and the frequency is given by the dispersion relation (GODA,
2000). For deep water applications (such as is the semisubmersible platform under study) the wave length
is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency.



43

Now, it is assumed that the responses of the vessel are linearly related to the amplitude

and slope of the regular wave, which velocity potential has been defined in Eq. (3.9).

Hence, the response of the 2nd ? order system can be fitted to a linear model and the

solution is sought in the frequency-domain. Accordingly, Eq. (3.24) can be transformed

to the frequency-domain as follows,

[M + a(?)]?? + B(?)?? + c? = ?
{
??2[M + a] + i? b + c

}
= A X . (3.25)

where M is the system mass and inertia moment matrix, b represents the linear damping

coefficient, c is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient, A stands as the wave amplitude and

X is the complex amplitude of the exciting force or moment7. Through Eq. (3.25) it is

possible, by means of standard matrix inversion techniques, to compute the ratio ?/A.

Therefore, for the jth mode, this ratio is given by,

Zj(?,?) =
?j

A
=

i=1

Xi

??2[Mij + aij] + i? bij + cij
= Aj(?,?) + iBj(?,?) . (3.26)

where Z(?,?) stands as the complex amplitude of the body motion in response to an

incident wave of unitary amplitude, frequency ? and direction of incidence, ?, of the

wave in relation to the vessel (see Fig. 3.6). This function is also known as the Response

Amplitude Operator (RAO) in the field of marine engineering.

Moreover, it is important to highlight that in Eq. (3.26) the complex notation has been

adopted (denoted by i) aiming to properly compute the phase shift between the responses

of the platform and the incident waves. In the last place, Aj(?,?) and Bj(?,?) correspond

to real and imaginary parts of the complex transfer function of motion Zj(?,?).

For instance, the phase angle, ?j, can be computed as,

?j = arctan

, (3.27)

Thus, the complex transfer function is rewritten as,

In some cases it is more convenient to define the transfer function in wave period

rather than in wave frequency. Then, the equivalence is directly computed as follows,

Zj(?,?) = Zj

)
. (3.29)

Finally, from Eq. (3.28) it is possible to compute the RAOs for a given direction

and frequency range, in virtue of the superposition principle (previously discussed in

section 3.2). As for the waves, the responses of the vessel are a random process. Therefore,

the response PSD can be adopted to characterize its motions. Formally, the response

power spectrum of the jth mode is related to the RAOs (of the same jth mode) and the

wave spectrum (defined in Eq. (3.19)) by,

Sjj(?,?) = |Zj(?,?)|2S??(?,?) . (3.30)

Among the different qualitative characteristics of the RAOs, it is interesting to high-

light its main feature for the intermediate range of frequencies. As in the case of a



45

mechanical oscillator, the floating platform will experience a response of large amplitude

close and at the natural frequency of each one of its motions (also there is a phase shift

? from zero, in lower frequencies, to ??, for ? = ?n). The resulting response, thus, will

be inversely proportional to the damping coefficient.

Accordingly, the estimation of the RAOs is possible if the potential coefficient a and B

are known. However, this estimation will not be accurate unless viscous damping effects

are included. This is due to the fact that the model adopted until now assumes that the

fluid is inviscid. Therefore, in those cases where the damping is dominated by viscous

effects the theory will result in misleading (over)-estimation of the responses that the

floating system presents close to its motion resonances. A brief discussion regarding the

viscous damping and its relevance for the motions of floating structures can be followed

in the next section.

3.3.1 Viscous damping effects

Returning to the analogy of the mechanical oscillator, it is widely known that the

resonant response will be inversely proportional to the damping coefficient. Hence, off-

shore structures with small damping coefficients will experience large resonant responses.

As a matter of fact, it can be shown (by means of the Haskind relations8) that there is

a connection between the exciting force and the potential damping coefficient. Conse-

quently, the vessels designed to experience small exciting forces will be subjected to small

damping coefficients, leading to large resonant responses. Clauss et al. (2014) show that

the semisubmersible platforms fall within this category and that their motions will be

characterized by large resonant responses, whose damping is dominated by viscous effects

mainly coming from the separation of the flow over the columns and pontoons.

Following the approach proposed by Morison, Johnson and Schaaf (1950), the non-

linear drag force originated by viscous effects and the associated downstream wake can

be expressed as,

dFd =
1

2
Cd? |u|udS . (3.31)

8See (NEWMAN, 1977).



46

where u is the total local flow velocity, the Cd stands as the drag coefficient (including the

form and friction drag) and S is the cross sectional area of the element of the structure

under study.

Now, using Eqs. (3.9) and (3.31), it can be shown that the nonlinear drag force fulfils

the following relation,

dFd ? |cos(? t)|cos(? t) . (3.32)

And using series to develop the term |cos(? t)|cos(? t), the drag force can be rewritten

as,

dFd =
??

(3.33)

This non-linear force can be linearized by means of the principle of energy equivalence:

Where the energy dissipation resulting from the drag force must be identical in both linear

and nonlinear terms. More details regarding this linearization are provided in section 5.2.4.

As a direct consequence of this linearization, the estimated drag coefficient can be

superposed to the radiation damping coefficient for a proper computation of the RAO

(close to the motion resonance, where an over-estimation of the responses may occur).

Concerning the resulting linearized damping coefficient (see Eq. (3.33)), it includes

both frictional and separation effects. However, it has been identified that the viscous

damping for offshore structures is mainly governed by the separation effects (SARPKAYA,

2010). A common approach to categorize the relevance of the separation effects in periodic

flows is the computation of the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number. This coefficient is

formally expressed as,

KC =
UT

D
, (3.34)

where U is the equivalent amplitude of the object (or flow) velocity oscillation, T rep-



47

resents the period of the oscillation and D stands as a characteristic length scale of the

object (e.g. the diameter for a vertical cylinder under wave loading). Moreover, follow-

ing the linear wave theory for deep water conditions (see (NEWMAN, 1977)) U can be

rewritten as U = A2? exp{ky}. Therefore, Eq. (3.34) can be expressed as,

KC =
h?

D
exp{ky} , (3.35)

where h = 2A stands as the wave height.

Physically, the KC number can be related to the ratio of the maximum values of the

drag and inertia force acting on an element of the structure (see (CLAUSS et al., 2014))

and it is crucial for determining the nature of the fluid force acting on the structure.

Therefore, when the KC number is small the inertia forces are more important than

the drag forces, whereas if the KC number is large the drag forces are dominant. In

section 3.3.2 the KC number has been used to classify the nature of the forces acting on

the column elements of the hull of the semisubmersible platform adopted as a case study

in this thesis.

Finally, it must be highlighted that in this thesis the solution of the linear equations

that describe the motions of the vessel in waves has been computed by means of numerical

methods, which allow the estimations of the RAOs for arbitrary geometries. More pre-

cisely, the RAOs adopted to estimate the sea conditions were computed by means of two

different software packages. First, WAMIT (LEE; NEWMAN, 2006) software was used

to analyze the wave-body interaction in the frequency-domain. Secondly, ANSYS-AQWA

(ANSYS, 2013) has also been used in this thesis. This package includes both frequency

and time-domain analysis.

3.3.2 Note on the motions of semisubmersible platforms in waves

The overview provided above constitutes a general description of the most significant

definitions and theory adopted to characterize the induced ship motions in waves. Since

this thesis aims to assess the use of a semisubmersible platform as a motion based wave

sensor, a discussion regarding the main characteristics of its hydrodynamic properties is

provided herein.



48

At the beginning of section 3.3 it has been shown that the interaction of waves with

floating structures includes the effects that the vessel presence has on the incoming flow.

The significance of this effect is associated to the shape, dimensions and relative motion

of the vessel that is being analyzed. In order to categorize the interaction wave-body,

distinction must be made between small and large bodies, since the nature of the forces

experienced by the vessel differs significatively depending on its size. In this case, the

reader is referred once again to (CLAUSS et al., 2014) for a detailed discussion about this

topic.

The categorization of small/large bodies is based on the comparison between the

characteristic length of the structure, D, the characteristic wave length, ?, and the wave

height, H (these parameters are generally evaluated for the most adverse conditions, i.e.

at y = 0). Therefore, for small D/? and large values of H/D the structure can be

assumed small. These conditions lead to a regime where viscous drag forces dominate

(mainly originated by flow separation). For wave-body interactions where D/? are larger

than 0.2 and H/D is small, diffraction effects will dominate the dynamics of the structure

and separation effects can be neglected.

In order to illustrate this categorization Fig. 3.7 is provided below, where the loading

regimes for the columns of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform have been assessed

in terms of the columns diameters, significant wave height and peak period for all the

sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign9. In this figure the vertical axis

shows the ratio H/D, which is equivalent to the KC number (CLAUSS et al., 2014) while

the horizontal axis can be interpreted as a the diffraction parameter.

The results in Fig. 3.7 show that the diffraction effects are more dominant for the

columns with large diameters than for the columns with a diameter equal to 12.2m, as

expected. Moreover, for extreme wave conditions (high H/D relations) the data shows

that the drag effects become relevant, being the columns with smallest diameter the ones

that will experience larger drag forces. Meanwhile, in calm-mild sea conditions these hull

elements will experience loading regimes featured by a dominance of the inertia terms.

This discussion regarding the main characteristics of the wave-body interaction pro-

9Chapter 5 includes detailed descriptions of the main dimensions of the platform as well as the sea
conditions tested.

vide a general idea of the dominant effects that column elements of the hull will experi-

ence. Notwithstanding this, the main characteristics of the platform dynamics are given

by the motion RAOs. Thus, a brief review of the main feature of the motion RAOs for a

semisubmersible platform is provided hereafter.

First, it is analyzed what happens to all the six degrees of motion in the high frequency

range. At very high frequencies, the exciting force in the numerator of Eq. (3.26) will

tend to zero for all modes of motion (NEWMAN, 1977) while the denominator would be

proportional to ?2. Thus, for short waves the RAOs of the six dofs will tend to zero.

In the long waves regime (that correspond to the limit of low frequencies), differently

from the high frequency range, the platform motions are not expected to present the

same behavior. Regarding the roll and pitch motions, it can be show that the exciting

force will be characterized by small values, see (NEWMAN, 1977), while the denominator

of Eq.(3.26) will be given by the respective restoring coefficients (which are different of

zero). For the heave motion, it is expected that the structure will simply ride up and

down along with the free surface. In relation to the horizontal modes of the platform, the

large diameter columns and massive displacements that the semisubmersible platforms



50

present will result in a greater capability of the hull to disrupt the incoming waves. As a

consequence, the resulting forces may induce large amplitudes of motions of the platform

in these dofs.

For the intermediate frequency range, it is already known that the main features of

the RAOs are the resonant responses of the motions. The resonant frequencies of the

heave, roll and pitch motions are computed using the geometric features of the platform

(CLAUSS et al., 2014). For instance, the distribution of the waterplane area of a semisub-

mersible platform results in large resonant periods for these motions, when compared with

a ship-shaped platforms characterized with similar displacements. As a matter of fact,

if compared with ship-shaped platforms, such as FPSOs, semisubmersible platforms are

characterized by smaller waterplane areas, which result in low hydrostatic restoring coef-

ficients. Furthermore, layout of the waterplane area of a semisubmersible platform (given

by the cross sectional area of the platform’s columns) leads to large moments of inertia.

Altogether, these characteristics result in large values for the resonance periods of heave,

roll and pitch motions. For the sake of illustration, the natural periods for the heave,

roll and pitch motion of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform are: 24s, 74s and 88s,

respectively10. That are significantly larger than the ones that characterize the dynamics

of a FPSO, given for example in (BISPO et al., 2016), and that corresponds to 11.5s,

14.5s and 16.3s, for the heave, roll and pitch motions respectively.

For illustrative purposes, an example of the heave motion RAO of the semisubmersible

platform used during the experimental campaign is shown in Fig. 3.8. This RAO has been

computed in the frequency-domain using WAMIT for a heading condition equal to 180?,

including the phase ?. From this figure, one may realize that this motion presents its reso-

nance close to 24s. Also, in 22s the RAO has a cancellation point. For practical reasons, it

is worth remembering that this cancellation point is the result of the equilibrium between

the forces acting on the pontoons of the platform and the forces acting on the columns11.

Analogous behavior is observed at lower wave periods, or higher frequencies, where the

heave RAO shows some zero points. Nonetheless, in this case the origin of the zero points

is due to the cancellation of the wave effects by the superposition of the forces on both

sides of the semisubmersible. It is important to highlight that for some sea conditions the

10The main characteristics of these motions are thoroughly discussed in chapter 5.
11See appendix D for a comprehensive analysis of the heave RAO of the semisubmersible platform.



51

platforms may present responses in frequencies that correspond to cancellation points of

the RAOs, where the platform is not expected to present any significant responses. This

deviation from the theoretical transfer function can be related, among other factors, to

non-linear drag effects; once again the reader is referred to appendix D for a detailed dis-

cussion regarding the cancellation points of the heave RAO. Finally, the RAO shows that

for long waves the heave motion responds by following the surface elevation, meanwhile

for short waves the platform is expected to present motions with small amplitudes, as

expected.

Concerning the phase of the RAO, ?, negative values mean that the positive maximum

of forces or structural motions occurs after the passage of the wave crest. For instance,

if ? = ?? we have that platform vertically oscillates opposite to the wave elevation.

The positives values for the phase stand for conditions where the positive maximum of

forces happens before the passage of the wave crest. In long waves, the semisubmersible

predictably follows the wave amplitude, and the resulting phase angle between heave

motion and wave elevation is zero.

With regard to the horizontal modes of the platform, their resonances would depend

on the restoring coefficients induced by the mooring system. Since the submerged lines

result in a system with low stiffness while the whole system is characterized by a large

mass, the resulting resonances of these motions will happen in the very low frequency

range. It is important to highlight the fact that VMB wave inference aims at estimating

gravity waves, whose periods usually range between 1 and 30s. Thus, the effects that may

arise close to the resonances of these motions (&gt;&gt; 30s) are not of interest for the purpose

of this work.

The importance of the resonance frequency has its origin in the resulting amplitudes

of motion. It has been shown that close and at the resonant frequency, the system

will present responses of large amplitudes. Furthermore, the semisubmersible platform

is characterized by large resonance responses, in virtue of the connection between the

exciting force and the damping coefficient as explained previously in section 3.3.1. As a

matter of fact, radiated waves are expected to be small due large draft of the platform

and the cylindrical shape of the columns. Therefore, the platform will experience small

exciting forces and, as a consequence, it will be subjected to small damping coefficients.

In order to illustrate the relevance of these viscous drag effects on the heave motion

response, Fig. 3.9 provides the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number estimated for the pon-

toons of the platform, based on the measured responses close to the resonance of the

motion. These values were computed using a significant amplitude of the heave motion

derived from Eq. (3.15), which is given by,

Az =

where Szz(?n) is the measured power spectrum of the heave motion at the natural fre-

quency and ??n is the frequency interval of the spectral analysis close to the natural

frequency (?n), or [?n ??(n?1),?(n+1) + ?n].

In this case the expected effect of the wave flow on the damping force is small due to

being A the significant amplitude of the heave motion (see Eq. (3.27)) and hpont the height

of the pontoon.

Therefore, when the KC number is small the inertia forces are more important than the

drag forces, whereas if the KC number is large the drag forces are dominant. Particularly,

the results in Fig. 3.9 attest that sea conditions with high periods will increase the effects

of the drag forces on the pontoon near the resonance of the motion. Similar results are

presented by Chaplin (1988), who analyzed the flow around a submerged circular cylinder

in beam waves. Moreover, the author shown that since the drag forces arise mainly from

separations effects, there are not any severe scale effects (a detailed discussion regarding

the scale effects is also provided in (FALTINSEN, 1993)), thus increasing the reliability

of the model-scale results.

3.4 The semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave

sensor

This section aims at providing an earlier assessment of the possible advantages and

disadvantages that the adoption of the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor

may present. This evaluation is entirely based on the main weaknesses and strengths

related to the methodology described in section 3.3. Although the following discussion

is focused on the dynamics of the semisubmersible platform, the reader is referred to

chapter 4 and appendix B for a discussion concerning the main limitations of the theory

provided in section 3.2 and its possible implications for the VMB wave inference problem.

The main objective of this thesis is the assessment of the use of the semisubmersible

platform as a motion based wave sensor. Nonetheless, other ship-shaped vessels, such

as FPSOs and container ships, have been adopted as reliable wave sensors in a wide

range of sea conditions. Therefore, for illustrative purposes the main features of the

semisubmersible platform have been compared with the ones of the FPSOs, which are

broadly documented in the literature, e.g. (BISPO, 2011b).

The RAOs of the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform are provided in Fig. 3.10. This

figure includes the RAOs corresponding to: surge, sway, heave, roll and pitch motions12,

which have been computed for 5 different headings. In a similar way, and only for com-

parative purposes, Fig. 3.10 provides the RAOs of a FPSO.

Concerning the RAOs of the semisubmersible platform, one may realize that in the

first region up to the zero point at T = 10s in the horizontal motions, the transfer functions

of motion indicate small oscillation amplitudes. As a consequence, unlike the ship-shaped

platforms (see Fig. 3.11), the semisubmersible is expected to filter large amounts of energy

for the most frequently encountered wave periods in offshore activities (T &amp;lt;10s). For

instance, the heave motion will be less than 10% of wave elevation. These characteristics

of the semisubmersible motions in the high frequency range properly illustrate the main

possible drawback of the VMB wave inference, highlighted previously in section 1.1.2,

which may result in inaccurate estimations of calm sea conditions.

12The yaw motion has not been included in this analysis due to the fact that its main properties
depend on external factors, such as mooring stiffness and inertia properties of the platform around the z
(vertical)-axis; about which there was not accurate/enough data in order to carry out a proper analysis
and characterization.

In the intermediate range (10s &amp;lt;T &amp;lt;20s) the RAOs of the semisubmersible platform

still show smaller oscillation amplitudes than the ones presented by the FPSO. For in-

stance, the small amplitudes that the semisubmersible platforms present in calm to mild

sea conditions have led some authors to assume (a priori ) that these platforms are not

reliable motion based wave sensors, as it has been discussed in section 1.1.2. However,

one may realize that although the RAOs are not characterized by large responses, there

are no resonance or cancellation points in this interval in any of the five dofs under study.

Therefore, the reliability of the linear relation between the exciting waves and the plat-

form responses is hold. Concerning the RAOs of the FPSO, they not only show several

zero points but also the heave, roll and pitch motions present their resonances within the

limits of this period range. Thus, the associated non-linear effects are expected to result

in the increase of the uncertainty of the estimations of the sea conditions based on the

measured motions of a FPSO (BISPO, 2011b).



57

For the highest possible waves to which the extreme wave conditions belongs, periods

lie in the region of T &gt; 20s. The RAOs have been computed following the approach

described in section 3.3, where the small wave amplitudes/slopes are assumed. However,

it is not clear if this assumption is consistent for the period range evaluated: Although

for the most general sea conditions the wave amplitude/slope can be assumed sufficiently

small (see Fig. 3.7), in extreme sea conditions with very step wind waves this assumption it

may not be fulfilled leading to uncertainties of the RAOs. The most significant features of

the semisubmersible RAOs in this range are identified for the heave motion, that presents

a cancellation point and its resonance.

Regarding the dynamic behavior of the heave resonance, it is already known that the

semisubmersible platforms are expected to present large responses, due to the small po-

tential damping that the hull presents. This may result in the violation of the assumption

of small response amplitudes. Moreover, non-linear viscous forces become significant in

the heave motion near the resonance, modifying the linearly estimated responses as well

as the cancellation point close to the resonance (here the reader is referred, once again,

to appendix D for a detailed discussion regarding the resonance and this zero point). In

this case, an external damping coefficient must be imposed in order to emulate the effects

of the viscous forces. However, it is not obvious how to bound the influence of these

viscous effects a priori (a detailed evaluation of the cancellation point and the assessment

of various solutions proposed to account for the associated shortcomings is provided in

chapter 5). Therefore, in harsh weather conditions the heave responses must be properly

modelled in order to avoid misleading estimation of the sea conditions that induced the

measured motions of the platform. Regarding the extremely low-frequency components,

it can be highlighted that the platform is expected to follow the free surface elevation,

reaching, in the limit, a pure heave motion.

Finally, another characteristic of the semisubmersible platforms is their reduced value

of the metacentric height (GM)13, which limits its stability properties. As a consequence,

these platforms constantly monitor their GM values. Moreover, usually these platforms

are typically designed only for three different draft configurations which are: the opera-

tional, survival and transit draft. In the operating condition the draft is at the maximum

magnitude. These features turn to be an advantage for the semisubmersible platforms as

motion based wave sensor, since they allow the estimation of the most appropriate set

of RAOs at any moment. Contrary, the FPSOs present large draft variations that result

in significant changes of their stability properties, such as their GM and centre of grav-

ity. This limitation is well illustrated in (BISPO, 2011b), where the author carried out a

sensibility study to assess the RAOs changes of a FPSO in differing loading conditions.

4 BAYESIAN INFERENCE

4.1 The Bayesian paradigm

Previous works and results concerning VMB wave inference, e.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU,

2000) and (NIELSEN, 2006), as well as the preceding research conducted at the USP on

this topic, i.e. (TANNURI et al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2012), have motivated the adoption

of the Bayesian inference method to estimate the sea conditions based on the measured

platform motions. A proper explanation with regards to the advantages of using this

statistical inference method to estimate the sea conditions from the measured platform

motions is addressed along the next sections.

Bayesian inference is one of the most important statistical inference methods in use

nowadays. Its core principle is that the posterior distribution of the variable of interest is

the result of updating the existing prior information on the model parameters using the

available data, where the systematic process of learning from the data is implemented via

Bayes theorem. This can be formally expressed as follows (BERNARDO; SMITH, 2006),

P(x|B) =
P(B|x)p(x)

P(B)
, (4.1)

where P(x|B) is the posterior updated distribution, P(B|x) is the probability of observing

B given x, p(x) is the prior distribution and P(B) stands for the marginal probability

distribution of observing the event B.

Since the proportionality constant, P(B) =
?
?
P(B|x)p(x)dx, may always be de-

ducted from the fact that P(x|B), a probability density function, may be integrated to

one, the Bayes theorem may be simply expressed as follows,



60

P(x|B) ? P(B|x)p(x) . (4.2)

4.2 Bayesian modelling procedure and ill-conditioned

problems

From a formal Bayesian point of view, it is assumed that the statistical model derived

from the observed data, P(B|x), is correct. In fact the Bayesian learning process is

optimal when P(B|x) matches the exact statistical distribution of the observed data

(ZELLNER, 1988). Returning to the VMB wave inference problem, the model can be

written in accordance with the RAOs of the vessel. Thus, the output of the Bayesian

inference procedure will be optimum for those cases where the RAOs stand as the true

(exact) statistic that determine the likely behavior of the vessel when operated at sea.

However, in practice, it is already known that only in controlled conditions and for a

limited range of frequencies and directions the RAOs will lead to the exact statistical

model. For instance, in several engineering problems both the exact statistical model

parameters and their number (order) are generally unknown, and oftentimes the exact

model is infinite-dimensional (then, non-parametric). Therefore, to attain something

close to a exact model, one would need a very large statistical model, yet this is at the

expense of keeping the statistical model as simple as possible in order to focus on the

main characteristics of the system under study.

One of the first works dealing with this challenge was the problem addressed by

Whittaker (1922) in the estimation of a smooth trend. In that problem, the observations,

B, are given. They are assumed to consist of the sum of a smooth function, f, and the

observation Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance ?2. The problem is to estimate

the unknown trend function, f. In this context, Whittaker (1922) suggested that the

optimal solution will balance a tradeoff between the fitting of data and the goodness-of-fit

to a smoothness criterion. This idea is considered a conceptual predecessor of smoothness

priors in Bayesian inference.

Consequently, a common approach is to model the phenomenon under investigation

making use of a stochastic linear regression model, which allows the study of the essential

features of the unknown physical process.



61

Consider the Gaussian stochastic linear regression model,

B = A x + ? , (4.3)

where B stands for the measurements, A is the matrix that contains the characteristics of

the sensor, x is the unknown vector and ? is the sensor noise with zero mean and variance

?2. The dimensions of the matrices in Eq. (4.3) are B : n× 1; A : n× p; x : p× 1 and

? : n× 1, where n is the number of measurements and p is the dimension of the unknown

vector x.

A straightforward approach to reconstruct the unknown would be the use of the

inverse transform with the inverse filter, which is possible by using the pseudoinverse

(A+) of matrix A. Thus,

x? = A+B = x + A+? . (4.4)

However, the noise may make this approximation impossible. As a mater of fact, in

solving the inverse-problem, the pseudoinverse A+ operates as a high-pass filter that has

the undesirable tendency to amplify noise. This means that the estimation of the unknown

quickly becomes unstable as many noisy values are multiplied by larger values and then

summed up. In those cases, the pseudoinverse is said to be ill-conditioned. Otherwise, the

problem is known to be well-conditioned or well-posed1, leading to a significant variation

of the output value of the problem for a small change in the input argument.

The standard approach to solve the problem introduced by Eq. (4.3) is the use of

the linear least square regression method finding the minimum of J(x) = ||Ax ? B||2.

However, if the problem is ill-conditioned, the ordinary least square estimation leads to

an under-determined or, more often, to an over-determined (over-fitted) model2. In order

1In accordance with Hadamard (2014), a well-conditioned problem should have the following proper-
ties: (i) a solution exists; (ii) the solution is unique; (iii) the solution’s behavior changes continuously
with the initial conditions. A simple illustrative example of an ill-conditioned matrix is given by the
following matrix,

A =
1

2

[
1 1

1 + 10?10 1 ? 10?10
]
, with A+ =

[
1 ? 1010 1010
1 + 1010 ?1010

]
.

Which will result in the amplification of the measurement noise (when it exists). It is important to
highlight that this matrix is characterized by a very small determinant (2 · 10?10).

2The reader must note that the nature of the problem is also conditioned by the number of unknowns



62

to give preference to a particular solution with desirable properties, a regularization term

can be included in this minimization,

J(x) = ||Ax ? B||2 + ?||Dx||2 , (4.5)

where ? is referred to as a hyperparameter (LINDLEY; SMITH, 1972), and stands as a

trade-off parameter, balancing the variability of the estimation of the unknown and the

regularization condition. A small hyperparameter will prioritize a rough estimation and,

as a consequence, the data totally determine the estimation. As the hyperparameter gets

larger, the estimate moves further from the rough estimation and the regularization con-

ditions become more influential. Concerning matrix D, it stands as the matrix containing

the different weights given to regularization and it is usually known. This equation is

the more general form of the regularized objective function also known as the weighted

regularization (KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012).

Accordingly, if ? were known and since the measurement noise is assumed Gaussian,

the unbiased solution of the problem is given by the minimization of the regularized

objective function, Eq. (4.5). Thus, taking the gradient with respect to x,

?J(x) = 2AT (Ax ? B) + 2? DT Dx , (4.6)

and setting this gradient to zero, the unbiased solution is given by,

x? = (AT A + ? DT D)?1AT B . (4.7)

Aiming at illustrate the weighted regularization, Fig. 4.1 has been included as an

example. This figure provides the exact function (black line) that must be fitted and it is

given by y(x) = 1.5 x. Moreover, 17 points (black points), sampled from the exact function

(y), are included. In order to obtain these 17 noisy samples accordingly with Eq. (4.3),

the following relation has been adopted: y + ?, where ? is a Gaussian measurement noise

with zero mean and variance equal to 1. In addition to these samples and the real function

(y), approximations obtained by means of a polynomial model of order four are displayed.

that have to be solve. Thus, if n &amp;lt;p (in addition to the fact that the pseudoinverse of matrix A may act
as a high pass filter) then the adoption of ordinary multivariate procedures to estimate the unknowns is
not longer possible.

Figure 4.1: Illustration of the weighted regularization problem.

In this case, and with illustrative purposes, a weighted regularization has been adopted

to compute the fourth order fitting model. Therefore, the coefficients of the fourth order

polynomial models are computed by means of Eq. (4.7). Concerning the matrix containing

the different weights, D, the following form has been adopted,

D =

?

0 0 1 ?2 1

0 0 0 0.1 0.1

, (4.8)

This matrix results in a regularization problem that prioritizes smooth solutions (the

reader is referred to section 4.4 and (KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012) for a detailed discus-

sion concerning the main characteristics of matrix D provided). The hyperparameter, ?,

assessed for this illustrating example varies between 0 and 1000 (this stands as a set of

values that, similarly to matrix D, has been selected ad-hoc).

The solutions obtained in this example highlighted the critical role of the hyperpa-



64

rameter. First, an estimation of the training data has been obtained using ? = 1000

and it is not sufficient to fit the training samples. This is called underfitting (green line).

Secondly, the value of ? has been set equal to 0, which results in a polynomial model

(red line) that over-fits the sampled points, i.e. it learns the noise of the training data.

Finally, the best fitting model is included (blue line) and it corresponds to ? = 30. This

model minimizes the norm of the differences between the coefficients of the fourth degree

polynomial model obtained through the exact function, y = 1.5 x, and the fourth degree

polynomial model, y?, computed using the weighted regularization with ? = 30. Table 4.1

shows the error values for the three values of ? aforementioned.

Table 4.1: Hyperparameter values and the corresponding estimated error.

? ||x? ? x||2
0 581.3
30 0.89

1000 1.86

As a matter of fact, ? = 30 is a good choice for the regularization parameter. Thus,

resulting in a 4th order polynomial fitting model given by: y?(x) = ?0.038x4 + 0.12x3 +

0.27x2 + 0.43x+ 0.58. However, it must be reminded that we could only compute Tab. 4.1

with the knowledge of the exact solution, y = 1.5 x.

Returning to the review of the theoretical framework, an interpretation of the Bayesian

smoothness priors is obtained by multiplying Eq. (4.5) by ?1
2?2

and exponentiate (KON-

ISHI; KITAGAWA, 1996). Thus, the unknown that minimizes Eq. (4.5) also maximizes

the following relation,

exp

(
?1
2?2
||Ax ? B||2

)
exp

(
??
2?2
||Dx||2

)
, (4.9)

where ?2 remains as the variance of the sensor noise.

From Eq. (4.9), the unbiased solution (since the resulting posterior distribution is

assumed Gaussian) is the unknown that maximizes the product of the conditional data

distribution3 (the first term of Eq. (4.9)) and the prior distribution (the second term of

Eq. (4.9)). The main advantage of adopting the Bayesian modelling approach arises from

3Akaike (1992) introduces the notion that the statistical model may be regarded as depending of the
unknown, then it can be called the likelihood function.



65

the fact that the value of the hyperparameter can be obtained following the approach

proposed in (AKAIKE, 1980). From Shibata (1983) and Akaike (1980), it can be shown

that when using a finite-dimensional stochastic Gaussian regression model to estimate the

assumed infinite-dimensional truth model with a conjugated prior distribution, the ABIC

(Akaike’s Bayesian Information Criterion) provides an asymptotically efficient solution

under the quadratic loss function for selecting the best fit to the data.

Thus, the Bayes theorem (see Eq. (4.2)) is obtained from combining Eq. (4.9) and

Eq. (4.3),

P(x|B,?2,?) ? P(B|x,?2)p(x|?2, D,?) , (4.10)

Since the left hand side of Eq. (4.10) is a proper distribution, the marginal likelihood

of the unknown parameters (? and ?2) is given by the integration of the right hand side

of the equation,

L(?,?2) =

? ?
P(B|x,?2)p(x|?2, D,?)dxdD . (4.11)

Good (2003) referred to the maximization of Eq. (4.11) as a type II maximum likeli-

hood method (which includes certain hypotheses concerning the distribution of the data

and the use of the proper conjugate prior distribution). An essential result in Akaike

(1980) is that, since the posterior distribution is normally distributed, then the marginal

likelihood of the unknown parameters can be expressed in a closed form, providing a

method for the direct computation of the value of the hyperparameter.

A common approach in information criteria and statistical modelling is the use of the

Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence) to measure how the estimated probability

distribution diverges from the expected probability distribution. This index is similar to

the Fisher information distance (see Walker (2016)) and relies on the expected differential

entropy between prior and posterior distributions. In fact, the KL-Divergence can be used

to show that the value of the hyperparameter, ?, estimated with the ABIC minimizes the

norm of the difference between the entropy4 of the prior and the posterior distributions.

4The entropy of a system is defined as the minimal amount of information needed to describe its state
(AKAIKE, 1992).



66

This means that the prior distribution obtained using the ABIC is the least informative

as well as the one that presents smaller differences with the posterior distribution.

4.3 Data distributions

The concepts and hypotheses presented in the previous sections provide a general idea

regarding the data distribution. However, a detailed analysis is needed to fully understand

the repercussion of these assumptions on the output of the inference problem. A brief

review of the two main assumptions and their implications is provided herein, so that the

reader can asses the adequacy of these assumptions to the real phenomenon when it is

analyzed later in this section:

• Measurement noise is Gaussian: The assumption that the measurement noise is

Gaussian is the strongest condition regarding the structure and output of the prob-

lem. However, it is also a weak hypothesis as we will see later. Since the difference

between the measurements and the estimations is assumed Gaussian with variance,

?2, and zero mean, this hypothesis leads to a Gaussian Likelihood function of the

data model with similar properties.

• Gaussianity of the posterior distribution and conjugate prior distribution: In order

to ensure that the posterior distribution is Gaussian, the prior distribution is chosen

to be Gaussian (the Gaussian family is conjugate to itself, or self-conjugate, with

respect to a Gaussian likelihood function). The fact that the posterior distribution

is Gaussian provides a key advantage, because it ensures that the ABIC provides

the optimal values for the hyperparameters (KONISHI; KITAGAWA, 1996).

It is widely known, see for example (HAVER; MOAN, 1983), (NIELSEN, 2005) or

(FALTINSEN, 1993), that the hypotheses above can be largely affected by the uncer-

tainties related to the stochastic modelling of the ocean waves and the linear wave-body

interaction modelling adopted to describe the motions of the platform. Concerning the

wave-body interaction modelling procedure, chapter 3 addressed its main characteristics

along with the possible shortcomings. Also, it provided a brief description of the stochastic

modelling of ocean waves, whose possible drawbacks will be discussed next.



67

Basic assumptions commonly adopted for the probabilistic description of ocean waves

are: Records (time series) of the process shall be stationary and ergodic in order to esti-

mate meaningful statistical properties from only one realization of the irregular sea. Also,

the surface elevation random process is assumed to be Gaussian. These two assumptions

are only partially fulfilled in actual sea states. However, they are widely used since they

imply very attractive simplifications from a practical point of view.

In addition to these assumptions, uncertainties will be always related to the selection of

significant values to represent the sea condition, as for any stochastic phenomenon. These

uncertainties should be recognized in the actual learning process since they are somehow

included in the measurement noise of the model. For this purpose, following (HAVER;

MOAN, 1983) and (BENKE; LOWELL; HAMILTON, 2008), a brief but comprehensive

description is provided.

Fundamental uncertainty

This uncertainty is consequence of making use of stochastic models to characterize

the phenomenon in study. Therefore, this uncertainty is inherent to the random nature

of the phenomenon.

Model uncertainty

This uncertainty can be decomposed into two different components: First, as it has

been pointed out before, the real nature phenomenon can never be strictly modelled.

This means that the analytic model of a physical phenomenon implies simplifications,

i.e. an approximated image of the real stochastic phenomenon is considered. Secondly,

an uncertainty can be introduced through the selection of the probability distribution

for the random variables involved in the phenomenon due to lack of knowledge (if the

distribution is known a priori only a reduced model uncertainty is introduced due to the

model simplification). If the distribution of the random variable is not known, it is hard

to exactly quantify the model uncertainty associated to a specific choice of a probability

distribution.

One may realize that this uncertainty is always present and it is implicit to the

mathematical model of the physical phenomenon.



68

Parameter uncertainty

(HECKMAN; MEYERS, 1983) is one of the first works that began the analysis of

parameter uncertainty. Since the estimation of the parameters has to be done from

existing data, there is an uncertainty associated to the estimated variables (subjected to

both bias, systematic and, also, random error).

These three uncertainties together with the ones related to the misleading estimations

of the RAOs (due to effects discussed in section 3.3) are supposed to be embedded in the

measurement noise. As a consequence, one may realize that the assumptions concerning

the data distribution of the Bayesian approach adopted may be inaccurate, especially

when it comes to the measurement noise. The problem is therefore: Is the measurement

noise Gaussian distributed? And if not, what are the implications?

For some sea conditions, specially the more severe sea states, previous studies (HAVER;

MOAN, 1983) indicate that sometimes the stationarity assumption can be questioned even

for short periods of time (less than 30 min). In practice, it is typically assumed that the

stationary period holds to few hours (SOARES; FRICKE, 2011). Furthermore, it is widely

accepted that a non-Gaussian structure of the sea surface elevation is likely to occur when

the wave steepness increases.

In section 3.4 it has been shown that the hypothesis of linear dynamic model for the

vessel motions can be questioned for more severe sea states, due to the relatively large

steepness of the waves and the possible excitation of resonant motions of the platform,

both of which would result in non-Gaussian measurement errors of the stochastic linear

regression model adopted. For moderate to mild sea conditions, the RAOs computed in

the frequency-domain are expected to provide accurate estimations of the motions of the

platform, when combined with the sea spectrum.

In summary, the Gaussianity assumption can be strongly questioned in connection

with rough sea states. Therefore, assuming that we have the motion records for a time

span for which the sea condition can be assumed stationary, what are the possible effects

on the estimation of the sea state using the Bayesian if the Gaussianity assumption is not

met or can be questioned?



69

For answering this, let us assume that we obtain a certain estimation of the sea

condition, namely x?. Due to the nature of this problem, if the estimator is unbiased, the

quadratic loss function has to be minimized as follows,

min{E
[
(x ? x?)2

]
} = min{E

[
(x2 ? 2xx? + x?2

]
} , (4.12)

where E [·] stands for the expected value. Thus, taking the gradient with respect to x,

?(E
[
(x ? x?)2

]
) = 2E [x] ? 2E [x?] , (4.13)

and setting the gradient equal to zero, the unbiased solution is given by5,

5The reader may have already realized the fact that the main limitation that Eq. (4.14) brings is
that it is high-dimensional. For instance, the solution of the problem as it is given in Eq. (4.14) can be
computed as follows,

E[x|B] =
?
x??

x
P(x|B)p(x)

P(B)
dx ,

where ? stands as the space that contains all the possible sea states. Although this space is finite
dimensional, its dimensions remain sufficiently large to make the computation of the expected value of
x, given certain motion measurements B, unfeasible from a conventional point of view. Nevertheless,
there are some approaches that may allow the estimation of the value of this integral, i.e. the expected
value of the sea state based on the measured motions, such as the Monte Carlo method for solving
high-dimensional integrals (see (SOBOL, 1994)).

Basically, this approach allows the approximation of the integral of any function, let us say for the time

being g(x), as the mean value of the ratio
g(x)
h(x)

. Thus,

I =

? b
a

g(x)dx =

? b

g(x)

h(x)
h(x)dx ? E

[
g(x)

h(x)

]
,

where h(x) is any arbitrary probability density function that is defined over the domain of integration,
e.g. 1/(b?a). Accordingly, the value of the integral can be approximated as,

I ?
b?a
N

N?
i=1

g(xi) .

This integration method can be generalized to compute multidimensional integrals, such as,

I =

g(x)dx,

Thus,

I =

?
x??

g(x)

h(x)
h(x)dx ? I =

N

N?

.

Therefore this method involves the estimation of the values of g (in our case
xP(x|B)p(x)

P(B)
) at a number

N of points, which can be selected randomly in the domain of integration (the result becomes exact when
N ? ?, being the error proportional to 1?

N
(SOBOL, 1994)). In order to compute the values of this

functional a straightforward approach would be the use of the metocean data. Thus for each possible sea
state, x, shown by this set of data, it is possible to compute the probability of existence, p(x), by taking
the ratio between the number of observed events (x) over the possible number of sea states (in this cases



70

x? = E [x] . (4.14)

It is worth remembering that the sea estimation obtained from the Bayesian inference

method proposed above is the sea condition that maximizes the posterior distribution.

Therefore, if the posterior distribution is Gaussian, i.e. the measurement noise is Gaus-

sian, the expected value is equal to the Mode of the distribution and, as a consequence of

Eq. (4.14), the estimation is unbiased. However, if the measurement noise is not Gaussian,

even though the optimal value of the hyperparameter is known somehow, the solution ob-

tained by the maximization of the product of the prior distribution and likelihood function

is expected to be biased. Furthermore, in this condition the values of the hyperparameters

estimated by means of the ABIC approach may not be optimal (ISEKI, 2012).

The resulting bias associated to the estimation in cases when there is a lack of Gaus-

sianity can hardly be quantified in advance. A common procedure adopted in order to

overcome this drawback is the use of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) pro-

cedure, which is equivalent to the use of the Laplace distribution as a prior distribution

(KITAGAWA; GERSCH, 2012). The output of this approach, that minimizes the L1

norm, is less sensitive to the dispersion of the posterior probability distribution of the

variable of interest. Although (in theory) this approach is optimal, it does not provide a

proper methodology to choose the optimal values of the hyperparameters.

Returning to the VMB wave inference approach, the results obtained in previous

works, such as in (HIRAYAMA, 1987), show that the adoption of the use of the MLE

procedure has some limitations regarding the estimation of wave frequency and direction.

Otherwise, there are several works that assume that the measurement noise is Gaussian,

e.g. (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000; TANNURI et al., 2003; NIELSEN, 2008; SIMOS et al.,

p(x) would be given by the total number of sea states assessed in the metocean report). It is important
to highlight that h(x) can be estimated following the same approach, thus h(x) = p(x). Regarding the
likelihood function, P(x|B), it can be computed following (AKAIKE, 1980) (see Eq. (4.22)). Finally, the
term P(B) can be easily computed as

?N
i=1 P(xi|B)p(xi).

Unfortunately, this process cannot be adopted for the general purpose of this thesis. This is mainly
due to the fact that it relies on the availability of previous metocean data of the sea being monitored. Its
main limitation, thus, not only entails the availability of previous metocean data of the field where the
campaign is carried out, but also it must be sufficiently representative in order to include a wide range
of possible events, i.e. metocean data based on short field measurement campaigns may not include
infrequent sea states. Finally, although this methodology stands as a fast procedure for surveying the sea
state based on the ship motions, its research and application have been left as a future work.



71

2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016). Even though problems may become relevant in some

sea condition, such as when part of the high frequency components of the sea spectrum

are filtered by the ship (BISPO, 2011b), these works have attested that good estimations

of the sea conditions can be obtained, both in model and full-scale applications. Conse-

quently, from now on, the hypothesis of the Gaussian property for the measurement noise

will be accepted for the semisubmersible platform, although sometimes at the expense

of the optimal solution. Moreover, the improvements made on the RAOs regarding the

non-linear effects, discussed later in chapter 5, should favor the validity of the Gaussianity

hypothesis. Finally, it should be stressed that the Gaussianity hypothesis of the measure-

ment noise can be considered almost unavoidable (CLAUSS et al., 2014) due to practical

reasons related to numerical and/or experimental limitations when it comes to deal with

the wave-body interaction problem.

Under this Gaussianity hypothesis, the likelihood function can be written as it is

shown next. Also, the formal description of the problem provided ahead is expected to

help the reader to fully understand the computation procedure of the Bayesian inference

approach, as it is adopted in the present work.

Assuming that the relation between the waves and the platform responses is linear,

the directional wave spectrum, S??(?,?), and the vessel RAOs are related to the cross

spectra derived from the time series of the platform motions (Sij) through the following

identity (see section 3.3),

Sij(?) =

? ?
??

Zi(?,?)Z
?
j(?,?)S??(?,?)d? , (4.15)

where Zi(?,?) is the Response Amplitude Operator of the motion i at wave frequency ?

and direction of incidence ?. Z?j(?,?) stands for the complex conjugate of the RAO. The

relation given in Eq. (4.15) can be rewritten in discrete form assuming the integrand to

be constant in each slice ?? = 2?

Sij(?) = ??

Zi(?,?k)Z

j(?,?k)S??(?,?k) , (4.16)

where ?k = ?? + (k? 1)?? and K is the number of discrete wave directions considered.

Returning to the indices i and j, they correspond to the dofs assessed; i.e. if only three



72

dofs are adopted (N=3): heave, roll and pitch; these indices will vary between 3 and 5.

If a certain range of M wave frequencies is specified previously, being ?? = ?M??1
M?1 ,

Eq. (4.16) can be approximated in matrix form as follows,

B = A x + ? , (4.17)

Here, the vector B contains a total of (N2 · M× 1) elements, which are related to the

as,

Regarding the unknown discretized wave spectrum evaluated at the (K × M) pairs

of frequencies and directions, represented as the vector x of Eq. (4.17), it is denoted as:

x =

S??(?1,?1)

S??(?1,?2)
...

S??(?M,?K?1)

S??(?M,?K)

?
??????????
. (4.21)

Finally, ? is a vector with (M · N2× 1) elements representing the measurement noise,

which has been assumed to be Gaussian, with zero mean value and variance ?2.

The resulting equation system (see from Eq. (4.18) to (4.21)) will in general be under-

determined. As a matter of fact, typically three degrees of freedom are adopted (namely

heave, roll and pitch) while K = 72 and the number frequencies assessed is equal to

M = 20. Basically, this means that the resulting equation system is composed by N2·M =

180 equations with 72 · 20 = 1440 unknowns, thus reflecting a highly under-determined

equation system7. In this thesis, as well as in other works in the literature (see, for instance

(TANNURI et al., 2003)), the adoption of the Bayesian inference approach guarantees a

stable solution.

Following Akaike (1980), the Bayes procedure can be applied to the singular sys-

tem presented by the Eq. (4.17). With such procedure, the estimation of the vector x

is obtained maximizing the product of the likelihood function L(x|B) by the prior dis-
7One may think that the reduction of the number of directions assessed (e.g. in virtue of the vessel

symmetry) and the inclusion of more dofs will result, at some point, in a system with a single unique
solution. However, the adoption of more degrees of freedom leads to A matrices characterized by smaller
determinants (when compared with the ones obtained with a small number of dofs) and, therefore,
resultoing in problem that are not well-posed.

tribution, where the likelihood function represents the probability of occurrence of the

spectrum given an specific measurement, B.

As pointed out above, the measurement noise is assumed Gaussian with zero mean

and variance ?2. Therefore, the likelihood function is given by (AKAIKE, 1980),

4.4 Prior distributions

As it has been shown before, see Eq. (4.9), the posterior distribution of the variable of

interest is given by the product of the likelihood function and the prior distribution. The

following section aims to provide a brief introduction to the different prior distributions

previously adopted in the VMB wave inference method. Moreover, in this section the

proposal of a new prior distribution is presented, which not only aims to improve the

accuracy of the method but also the reduction of the computing time. This alternative

approach addresses the VMB wave inference problem by means of the ABIC and the use

of heuristic restrictions to solve the optimization problem. Regarding the performance of

this alternative proposal, it is assessed by means of a comprehensive comparison with the

outputs of the prior distribution already adopted in other works of the group of USP, i.e.

(TANNURI et al., 2003; SIMOS et al., 2010; BISPO et al., 2016) and (BISPO, 2011b),

and that is adopted in this work as the reference benchmark for the VMB Bayesian wave

inference approach.8

8The goodness of the prior distribution can also be assessed as follows. Consider G as the probability
distribution function that generates the data as the exact model or the true distribution, and P(x|B) is
the estimated model. Then, using Eq. (4.10) the KL-Divergence is given by,

I ? EG

[
log

G

P(B|x)
? log

P(x|B)
p(x)

]
.

The two terms in the right side of Eq. (8) can be interpreted respectively as an accuracy term, given by
the logarithm of the generating function over the posterior expected likelihood, and a complexity term,
obtained by the logarithm of the ratio of the posterior and the prior distribution. This means that models
with likelihood functions and prior distributions close to the real generating function and the posterior
distribution, respectively, receive low penalties. The relation given by the previous equation provides a
tool to select models that reproduce observations well (high accuracy) without including too much prior
information.



75

4.4.1 Conventional approach

The non-parametric approach adopted in this study follows the Bayesian modelling

procedure as proposed by Akaike (1980), which essentially aims at introducing various

kinds of prior information regarding the directional wave spectrum to improve the so-

lution of the ill-conditioned problem as well as to reduce the influence of the noise. In

wave inference, the prior information essentially concerns the fact that the spreading of

wave energy should happen smoothly (in frequency and direction). Mathematically this

restraint can be translated, among other possibilities, into delimiting the curvature of the

function as it shown in the following. For this aim, let us assume that the value of the

spectrum at direction, ?k, and frequency, ?i?1, can be estimated as,

S??(?i+1,?k) = S??(?i,?k) + ?? S
?

??(?i,?k) +
??2

2
S
??

??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?
3) , (4.23)

where S
??
??(?i,?k) stands as the second order derivative of the wave spectrum with respect

to the variable of interest, in this case (?). Following a similar approach, the spectrum

can be evaluated at the pair of frequency and direction, ?i+1 and ?k, obtaining that,

S??(?i?1,?k) = S??(?i,?k) ? ?? S
?

??(?i,?k) +
??2

2
S
??

??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?
3) , (4.24)

Now, assume that we have two different models whose KL-Divergences are given by I = I(G; P(x|B))
and I? = I(G; P?(x|B)). Thus,

? I = I ? I? = EG

[

G

P(B|x)
? log

G

P?(B|x)
+ log

P(B)

p(x)
? log

,

It is expected that the output of the likelihood function of both models is approximately equal. Al-
though this is a strong assumption, it is known that there are several sea conditions that provide analo-
gous minimum values for the likelihood function. Accordingly, it is accurate enough to assume that the
expected value of the likelihood is approximately equal for both models, leading to:

? I ? EG

[
log

P(B)

p(x)
? log

P?(B)

p?(x)

]
.

If the estimation P(x|B) is more accurate than P?(x|B) then ? I &amp;lt;0. Therefore the prior distribution
of the first model is less informative than the second one. The relation obtained using a measurement of
the entropy between the posterior distribution and the prior distribution ensures, for the cases where two
different estimations are obtained for the same sea condition, that the improvement of the estimations of
the sea condition are directly related to the prior distribution selected.



76

Combining Eqs. (4.23) and (4.24), it is possible to estimate the value of the spectrum

at the pair (?i,?k),

S??(?i,?k) =
1

2
(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) +

??2

2
S
??

??(?i,?k) + ? (? ?
3) , (4.25)

This approximation is possible due to the fact that the smoothness condition in fre-

quency and direction domain can be introduced separately in the prior distribution, as it

is shown later. Furthermore, the same procedure can be followed to introduce the smooth-

ness condition in the direction domain. Returning to the model proposed to estimate the

value of the spectrum at the pair (?i,?k), it is commonly reduced to the truncated form

of Eq. (4.25), as it is shown in Eq. (4.26).

S??(?i,?k) =
1

2
(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) , (4.26)

However, when it comes to describe the behavior of the spectrum, the model pro-

vided in Eq. (4.26) may present some shortcomings; due to the fact that it provides an

approximation of the exact value that the spectrum presents at (?i,?k). Therefore, an

uncertainty regarding the prior belief (Eq. (4.26)) is accepted,

S??(?i,?k) =
1

2
(S??(?i?1,?k) + S??(?i+1,?k)) + ?p . (4.27)

where ?p represents the uncertainty of the prior model and stands as an approximation

of the high order terms ( ??
2

2
S
??
??(?i,?k) and ? (? ?

3)) of Eq. (4.25). Regarding the main

properties of this uncertainty, it has been assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and

variance ?2p. Intuitively, the standard deviation determines how much the reconstructed

function (unknown spectrum) departs from a line. In terms of matrices we obtain,

?p = H S??(?,?k) , (4.28)

where S??(?,?k), in this case, is the wave spectrum for a fixed direction, k, and H can

be directly deducted by identification from Eq. (4.27),

which stands as an approximation of the second order finite difference matrix. However,

this matrix has a rank equal to M ? 1, that leads to a prior distribution that is a de-

generated Gaussian density function in RM+1. This is due to the absence of boundary

conditions for S??(?,?)
9. A possible option, as proposed by Nielsen (2006), is to assume

that in the direction domain the following relation is fulfilled: S??(?m,?0) = S??(?m,?k)

and S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1). Regarding the frequency-domain, the condition im-

posed is that the power of the spectrum is minimized for ? ? 0 and ? ??.

This central idea was used for the first time in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000) to estimate

the wave spectrum from the motions measured on a ship with forward speed. In their

approach, the trade-off between the good fit to the data and the smoothness of the solution

is then controlled by means of a single hyperparameter, u = ?
?p

. In this case, the posterior

distribution is given by,

L(x|B) · p(x) =

2

exp

(

[?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u2(H1 + H2 + H3))x]

)
,

(4.30)

where H1 and H2 stand for the discrete second order derivatives of the estimated vector,

that can be easily computed considering the definition of vector x (NIELSEN, 2008), as

it will be shown next.

The smoothness condition can be introduced through an approximation of the second

order differences associated to the estimated spectrum (see Eqs. (4.27) and (4.29)) in

direction, ?1mk, and frequency, ?2mk, that are simply defined as,

9A brief discussion concerning the boundary conditions is provided in appendix E.



78

?1mk = S??(?m,?k?1) ? 2S??(?m,?k) + S??(?m,?k+1) ,

?2mk = S??(?m?1,?k) ? 2S??(?m,?k) + S??(?m+1,?k) .
(4.31)

Also, it has been pointed out that the prior distribution aims at guaranteeing an

estimated sea spectrum with a certain degree of smoothness. This condition is equivalent

to keeping the following relations as small as possible (see Eq. (4.27) and Eq. (4.28)),

K?
k=1

M?
m=1

?1mk = x
T H1x ,

K?
k=1

M?
m=1

?2mk = x
T H2x .

(4.32)

where S??(?m,?0) = S??(?m,?K) and S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1).

In addition, one must take care of another practical problem regarding the limitations

due to the frequency insensitivity already mentioned in section 3.3, i.e. wave frequencies

for which part or all the motions of the platform are null. As a consequence, any estimation

in this frequency range therefore not supported by a proportionality between excitation

and response. In order to avoid an over prediction of the spectrum energy leading to

inconsistent results, the total energy of the spectrum is minimized in two pre-defined

ranges of low and high frequencies. This can be reached by minimizing the following

expression,

K?
k=1

L?
m=1

S??(?m,?k)
2 +

K?
k=1

M?
m=H

S??(?m,?k)
2 = xT H3x (4.33)

when ?L and ?H are respectively the upper and lower frequencies of the range whose

energy is to be minimized.

Accordingly, the posterior distribution in Eq. (4.30) can be derived using the relations

provided above. Moreover, it is worth remembering that the sea condition that minimizes

the relations in Eq. (4.32) and Eq. (4.33) is the same sea spectrum that would maximize

the product of the likelihood function, Eq. (4.22), and the prior distribution, given in

Eq. (4.30).



79

Following the idea presented in (ISEKI; OHTSU, 2000), Nielsen (2008) proposed the

introduction of an additional hyperparameter, thus leading to a prior distribution with two

hyperparameters. In the resulting distribution, the first hyperparameter, u1, determines

the balance of the fit of the model and the smoothness in direction while the second one,

u2, controls the smoothness of the energy distribution regarding the wave frequency. The

effects of H3 on the final solution are addressed in (NIELSEN, 2008) by means of the

minimization of the sum of the power spectrum in the frequency range where the ship

presents no significant motions. Therefore, the optimal solution in (NIELSEN, 2008) is

obtained by maximizing the following functional:

L(x|B) · p(x) =

exp

(
?

2?2
[?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u21H1 + u

2
2H2)x]

)
, (4.34)

Common to these previous applications of VMB wave inference is the fact that the

determination of the optimal values of the hyperparameters has been done by minimizing

the ABIC, i.e. following the procedure proposed in Akaike (1980), despite the expensive

computational cost that is required by this methodology.

Other works in the field (see for example Tannuri et al. (2003) or Simos et al. (2012))

used an approach based on the one proposed by Nielsen (2008), but including a third

hyperparameter, u3, which controls the excessive energy estimation at frequency bound-

aries. Nonetheless, the main modification proposed in Tannuri et al. (2003) and adopted

in subsequent works of the group of University of Sa?o Paulo, concerns the estimation

of the hyperparameters, which are pre-defined in their apporach. As a matter of fact,

the use of pre-defined hyperparameters increases the functionality of the method, thus,

resulting in a less time-consuming approach that may be adopted in applications that rely

on real-time data, such as decision support systems for offshore operations. Therefore,

in this case, the statistical approach, followed to determine the hyperparameters, has

been abandoned by these authors to increase the practical applicability of the method

(TANNURI et al., 2003). Regarding the calibration procedure of the (pre-defined) hy-

perparameters, it has been improved over the time by means of sensitivity studies carried

out using model-scale and full-scale data, as it shown in (SIMOS et al., 2010; BISPO et



80

al., 2012) and (SIMOS et al., 2012; BISPO et al., 2016; BISPO, 2011b), respectively. In

this approach the posterior distribution is hence written as,

L(x|B) · p(x) =

?

)
.

(4.35)

with u1, u2 and u3 known.

Two main motivations can be underlined among the arguments that lead to pre-define

the values of the hyperparameters in (TANNURI et al., 2003) and (SIMOS et al., 2012)

as well as in (BISPO, 2011a; SIMOS et al., 2012) and (BISPO et al., 2016). First, since

the ABIC method implies multiple testing, the technique followed by Nielsen is very time-

consuming (TANNURI et al., 2003) and considered impractical for real-time applications,

such as decision support systems. Secondly, some works, e.g. (ISEKI, 2012), showed that

in some cases the results obtained with the ABIC do not provide the optimal solution. The

discrepancies observed can be explained in those cases by one of the majors drawbacks of

the ABIC method, i.e. is its instability under certain conditions. For example, when the

linear model is not sufficient to characterize the sea state (e.g. when non-linear effects

start to have some relevance on the ship motions or when the ship has no significant

motions, leading to situations in which the Gaussianity assumption of the measurement

noise may not be fulfilled), it is usually hard for the method to distinguish solutions that

are close to each other. In this case, the choice of the values of the hyperparameters

becomes unstable during the multiple testing stage and a non-asymptotic behavior of the

solution is reached, leading to erratic and inaccurate estimations of the sea conditions.

Therefore, the approach proposed initially by Tannuri et al. (2003) with the calibration

procedure defined in Simos et al. (2012) will be the methodology adopted from now on

in this work to assess the use of the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor

and to provide a reference for evaluating the quality of the estimation obtained with

the alternative prior distribution proposed in the following section. Finally, it should be

noticed that the maximization of the product of the likelihood function and the prior

distribution, given in Eq. (4.35), is then equivalent to the minimization of the following

functional,



81

J(x) = ?B ? Ax?2 + xT (u21H1 + u
2
2H2 + u

3H3)x . (4.36)

which is feasible by means of a conventional quadratic algorithm.

4.4.2 Alternative prior distribution

This section contains a detailed explanation regarding the proposal of an alternative

prior distribution for the Bayesian inference method. Nonetheless, a comprehensive de-

scription of the main shortcomings of the approach adopted by Simos et al. (2012) and

Bispo et al. (2016) is provided in order to enable the reader to understand the main

motivations that led to this proposal.

Limitations of the conventional approach

As it has been pointed out in chapter 1, the results of ten months of a field campaign

on a FPSO platform were used in Bispo et al. (2016). This work highlighted the good

accuracy of the Bayesian method to estimate the sea conditions that happened during

this period of time provided they were in the estimation range (Tp &gt; 8s). However, in

some sporadic cases the authors also observed large discrepancies between the estimations

obtained and the radar measurements, which were adopted as the basis for assessing the

performance of the VMB wave inference method. These discrepancies can be grouped

as follows: (i) spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel in beam sea

conditions and (ii) global mean wave direction, when deviates from the expected value,

has a consistent and systematic error.

It is plausible to consider that part of the misleading estimations of the sea conditions

can be explained by limitations of the prior distribution adopted. Possible improvements

of the prior distribution are:

• It is known from the formal discussion provided in (AKAIKE, 1980), that the prior

distribution should be determined taking into account the measured data. Although

previous works developed by the research group of USP have been based on a pre-

calibration procedure of the hyperparameters (TANNURI et al., 2003), the current

work aims at providing a prior distribution which is computed using the measured

data without compromising the practical features gained with the pre-calibration of



82

the hyperparameters;

• As mentioned earlier, the likelihood function adopted works as a high-pass filter and

it has the undesirable effect of amplifying the measurement uncertainties when the

ship is expected to present no significant motions, see Eq. (4.22). Thus, a mechanism

capable of properly computing the variance introduced by the points of minima of

the RAOs would be welcome;

• The pre-definition of the two first hyperparameters, (u1,u2), showed several advan-

tages, e.g. the algorithm is less time-consuming and a consistent improvement of the

estimation has been observed. However, in some cases the values adopted for the

hyperparameters are not optimal (see Bispo (2011a)). This effect may be related to

the point of minima of the RAOs, where the vessel is expected to have no significant

responses, but certain wave conditions may impose some motions leading to poor

estimations of the sea state (see section 3.3.2). Also, the number of hyperparameters

and the calibration procedure adopted may not lead to the lower expected mean

squared error, as it is shown by the Stein’s paradox (STEIN, 1959). In addition,

this approach requires a pre-calibration procedure that involves numerical simula-

tions and, in some cases, real scale data to validate the values estimated with the

hyperparameters chosen. The novel prior distribution proposed does not rely on the

use of these hyperparameters, and therefore it is expected that this characteristic

of the prior distribution will help to avoid some of the drawbacks related to the

pre-defined hyperparameters;

• Despite the fact that the use of the third hyperparameter provides an useful tech-

nique to avoid spurious energy estimations, this methodology restrains the estima-

tion of the energy in certain frequency ranges in which the ship still has representa-

tive motions and this can have a negative impact on the estimations of the significant

wave height and mean period. Thus, the prior distribution proposed does not rely

on the use of a third hyperparameter, u3, whose influence on the final solution has

been modelled by means of a method that avoids misleading energy estimations

within the frequency limits.

From the points listed above, the following can be concluded: For mitigating the errors

of estimation, the uncertainties introduced by the RAOs should be properly addressed by



83

the prior distribution. Also, a method to calibrate the trade-off between the likelihood

function and the prior distribution is needed, at least one that would lead to optimal

estimations of the prior distribution in the majority of the cases.

An heuristic prior distribution

Next, the deduction of an alternative prior distribution that aims to reach the im-

provements suggested above is presented. This is followed by a detailed description of

the benefits expected with the use of this new prior distribution in VMB wave inference

problems.

For this purpose, let us assume that the prior distribution function of S?? is given by

a negative exponential probability distribution in the form of,

p(x) ? exp

??
?? ? Cx ?

2

2?2

??
? , (4.37)

where C stands as a matrix of coefficients that must be estimated. Once again, this

assumption is in accordance with the theory presented above (see section 4.2). Further-

more, this assumption allows us to estimate the variance of each element of the unknown

spectrum, S??j
10, as follow (see (BUI-THANH, 2012)),

Var(S??j ) = ej

(?
RM+1

S2??p(S??)dS??

)
eTj = ?

2ej(C
T C)?1ej , (4.38)

where ej stands for the j
th canonical basis11 vector in RM+1.

Accordingly,

Cjj =

?
? ?2

Var(S??j )

?
?

1
2

and Cij := 0 , (4.39)

Let us assume an approximate solution to the problem (x?) be somehow known. It is

possible to obtain the same estimation from Eq. (4.5) setting the matrix containing the

different weights of the regularization term D equal to the C. Now, it has been assumed,

10In this case j ranges between 1 and K · M. Thus, S??j = S??(?m,?k).
11The reader is referred to appendix E for a comprehensive discussion regarding the size of the higher-

dimensional space of the prior distribution.



84

heuristically, that the variance of each element of the unknown spectrum is proportional

to,

Var(S??j ) ?
max(x?) ? min(x?)
|x?j ? max(x?)|

, (4.40)

Now, because the regularization term can be assimilated to an approximation of the

measurement noise, as shown by the result obtained in Eq. (4.39), and aiming to facilitate

the computing process, the final expression of each element of matrix C has been adopted

as,

Cjj · Cjj =
|x?j ? max(x?)|

max(x?) ? min(x?)
?2 , (4.41)

This results in a regularization term that induces larger estimation errors in the frequency

regions in which the sea spectrum presents small amounts of power or the responses of the

platform are not significant, which is in accordance with the results obtained by means

of the coherence functions (discussed in section 5.4.2), i.e. the uncertainty of the linear

model is larger when the platform does not present significant motions.

From Eq. (4.41), the computation of the matrix C is reduced to the estimation of the

approximation of the sea spectrum x?, that is also needed to estimate the jth element of

the variance of the measurement noise, ?2, as it is shown below.

Therefore, the measured data will be used to compute the prior distribution. It is

known that the use of the measured data to construct the prior distribution can introduce

different correlations between the likelihood function and the prior distribution, resulting

in misleading estimations of the sea conditions. Aiming to avoid any bias on the posterior

distribution, as well as to maintain the benchmark of the prior distribution proposed in

previous works, the ABIC method has been adopted.

Introducing the posterior distribution obtained by Nielsen (2008), see Eq. (4.9), in

the general form of the ABIC (AKAIKE, 1980), that is given by,

ABIC = ?2 log
?

Ppost(x|...)dx , (4.42)

The following relation for the ABIC can be obtained,



85

ABIC = N(N + 1) log(2??2) ?K · M lg(?2) ? 2 log
? ?? 1

2??2

?
?

KM
2

exp

??
? ? 12?2 J(x?)

??
? ,

(4.43)

Following the results obtained by Nielsen (2008), Eq. (4.43) can be rearranged as,

ABIC = N(N + 1) log(2??2) ?K · M lg(?2) +
J(x?)

?2
+ F(?, A, D) , (4.44)

where N, M and K are constants related to the number of variables, as it has been

pointed out in section 4.3, and J(x?) = ?B ? Ax??2 + x?T (u21H1 + u22H2)x?.

In order to compute the value of ?2 that minimizes the ABIC, Eq. (4.44) is differ-

entiated with respect to the variable of interest (?2) and then set equal to zero, leading

to,

N(N + 1)

2??2
2? ?

J(x?)

?4
= 0 , (4.45)

that can be rewritten as,

?2 =
J(x?)

N(N + 1)
=
?B ? Ax??2 + x?T (u21H1 + u22H2)x?

N(N + 1)
. (4.46)

To compute Eq. (4.46), an estimation of the residual of the regularized objective

function, J(x?), is needed. The objective function selected for this purpose is the one

resulting from Eq. (4.34), which guarantees the smoothness and continuity of the solution

in frequency and direction. Also, it is compatible with the hypotheses assumed. Since

the matrix C is expected to provide an estimation of the variance of measurement noise,

the values of the hyperparameters of Eq. (4.34) were set equal to 1, that also is consistent

with Eq. (4.41). Finally, an estimation of J(x?) is needed in order to compute the variance

of the measured noise. Therefore,

x? = (AT A + 12H1 + 1
2H2)

?1AT B . (4.47)



86

Since we are trying to approximate the variance of the measurement noise and Eq. (4.47)

provides the minimum of the objective function under the hypotheses adopted, from Hu-

ber (1965)12 we obtain that a single estimation of the residual of the objective function

is enough, making the process less time-consuming. It is worthy to highlight that the

objective function selected will be indirectly included into the prior distribution and, as

a consequence, the adoption of this objective function assures a certain preference to

smooth solutions. Nonetheless, at the same time, it acts as a weak condition in contrast

with the maximization problem proposed by Nielsen (2006).

The resulting procedure may provide large values of Cjj for certain frequencies and

directions. In order to avoid unbounded values that would result in an unstable prior

distribution, the values of the elements of matrix C will be kept equal to or below a

certain threshold, as shown next.

From the Gaussian linear regression model adopted, see Eq. (4.3), it is known that the

measurement error is Gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance ?2. Thus, x is a

normally distributed parameter vector independent of ? with zero mean and covariance

(4.52)

Consequently, the covariance values of the motions would be adopted as the limiting

threshold for the values of the elements of matrix C, leading to the following relation,

Cjj · Cjj =
|x?j ? max(x?)|

max(x?) ? min(x?)
?2 ? ?2B , (4.53)

An estimation of C can be obtained by substituting the output of Eq. (4.46) and

Eq. (4.47) into Eq. (4.53). However, this procedure, once again, may lead to unbounded

values for the estimation of the unknown for the pairs of frequencies and directions linked

to the point of minima of the RAOs. As mentioned in chapter 3, the zero points of

the RAOs may introduce some uncertainties due to the fact that waves with frequencies

and directions that correspond to cancellations points of the RAOs, when the vessel is

expected to have no significant response, may, in reality, impose some motions on the

platform. This is because the numerical model for the RAOs is not free from errors (as it

has been shown in chapter 3). The procedure described below avoids this shortcoming.

1. Components Cjj of matrix C linked to the cancelation points of the RAOs are set

equal to the maximum of the output obtained by means of the estimation of matrix

C.

2. Also, components of matrix C near to the cancelation points and points of minima

of the RAOs may provide, in certain conditions, unrealistic estimations of the wave

spectrum. Therefore, if the corresponding values of C are less than a certain thresh-



88

old, then the values are replaced by this threshold. The estimation of this threshold

is done be means of a linear interpolation between the maximum and minimum of

matrix C accordingly to the heave RAO, which has been select among the (six)

RAOs due to the fact that it can be considered as an almost ideal response model13,

thus providing a better prediction of the responses of the platform in comparison

with the other dofs.

A formal description of the alternative prior distribution can be deduced introducing

the uncertainty, namely w, that the points of minima or cancellation points of the RAOs

can generate on the model. Since this uncertainty is unknown at the beginning, it can

be included into the inference model using a common approach followed in Bayesian

networks, which essentially considers the uncertainty as a parameter of the distribution,

obtaining the following equation:

P(x, w|B)P(B) =P(x, w, B) = P(B|x, w)P(x, w) =

P(B|x, w)P(x|w)P(w) ? P(x, w|B) ? P(B|x, w)P(x|w)P(w) .
(4.54)

where P(B|x, w) is the likelihood function, P(x|w) is the probability of x given the

uncertainty w and P(w) is the probability of the existence of the uncertainty. Thus, if

the RAOs present a cancellation point at a given pair of wave frequency and direction, the

corresponding uncertainty (w) is assumed to have a probability of existence equal to one.

Accordingly, see Eq. (4.53), the output of the inference approach will be characterized

by sea conditions which present small uncertainties for points of minima and larger ones

for the maximums; this is in accordance with the discussion provided in section 3.2.2

(CoV(s??n) = 1).

With regards to the numerical considerations, the resulting matrix C will have the

characteristics described in the following. Furthermore, an illustrative description of the

algorithm adopted to estimate C is provided in Fig. 4.2.

13An analysis regarding the linearity between the excitations and the RAOs of the platform has been
carried out in chapter 5 using coherence functions.

, (4.56)

As it has been pointed out before, the total size of the maximization problem is

still defined by the number of directions (K) and frequencies (M) considered, being the

number of variables equal to K × M. Therefore, the solution of the problem is given by

the minimization of the following objective function:

J(x) = ?B ?Ax?2 + ?Cx?2 . (4.57)

This minimization is also feasible by means of a conventional quadratic programming

algorithm.

Finally, it should be stressed that the alternative approach proposed above is not

intended to discredit the advances obtained by other authors or substitute the previous

prior distributions14, but rather it is an attempt to improve the estimations of the sea

conditions based on the observed drawbacks of the current methods.

14The non-existence of a unique prior distribution that would be appropriate for any inference problem
within a given model is established in (DAWID; STONE; ZIDEK, 1973), where the authors showed that
the existence of a unique prior is incompatible with a consistent marginalization.

Expected improvements of the proposed prior distribution

At the beginning of this section a description of the main shortcomings of the prior

distribution as it is adopted nowadays has been provided. One may realize that the

proposed alternative prior distribution is expected to mitigate some of these issues. In

fact, the main advantages expected are (a detailed discussion regarding the attainment

of these advantages is provided in chapter 5, based on the experimental measurements):

• This prior distribution does not need previous calibration, in fact it is the result of

a self-calibrating procedure that relies on the ABIC information criterion based on

the measured motions;

• Since the restraint (H3), that avoids unrealistic estimations of the sea wave energy

outside of the frequency range of interest, has been replaced by the measurement of

the uncertainty in the points of minima, an improvement of the energy estimations

in the high frequency range is expected.

• Due to the fact that the approach proposed provides a prior distribution adjusted

for each sea condition, it is also expected that the computing time will be reduced.

Although the prior distribution proposed above bring several improvements to the

VMB wave inference methodology, it is also characterized by some shortcomings. First, it

is important to highlight the fact that the formal description of this new prior distribution

is not featured by a direct and clear physical interpretation as it is the case for the prior

distribution adopted in the literature. Moreover, in order to avoid estimations of spurious

energy peaks as well as poor quality estimations of the sea conditions, there are some

assumptions adopted ad-hoc, such as the increase of the values of matrix C close to the

cancellation point of the RAOs, thus resulting in a heuristic approach.

5 CASE STUDY: THE A?SGARD-B

SEMISUBMERSIBLE PLATFORM

In this chapter, an assessment of the use of the measured motions of a semisubmersible

platform to estimate the sea condition will be made based on model tests performed in

a wave basin. For this purpose, the chapter has been organized as follows: First, a

brief description of the semisubmersible platform adopted as a case study is provided

(section 5.1), followed by a description of the numerical modelling of the hydrodynamic

characteristics of the platform (section 5.2). Such description also addresses the impor-

tance of a proper damping estimation for predicting the heave resonant motions and the

difficulties imposed by the non-linear character of the viscous effects. The experimental

setup and the main features of the test campaign are presented in section 5.3. Finally,

the chapter includes a detailed comparison of the results obtained when using the prior

distribution recommended by (SIMOS et al., 2012) and the alternative prior distribution

proposed in this thesis, both previously discussed in chapter 4.

5.1 General description

The study carried out at USP for assessing the use of a semisubmersible platform as a

VMB wave sensor has been supported by Equinor (see section 1.1.2), whose main offshore

developments are located in the Norwegian sea. Moreover, it was expected that only sea

states featured with large wave heights (here the reader is referred to chapter 3, which

includes a discussion regarding the semisubmersible hydrodynamic characteristics) could

be accurately inferred using this kind of floating platforms. The model employed during

the experimental campaign at the wave basin of the TPN-USP was a scaled (1:120) model

of the Equinor’s A?sgard-B (large) semisubmersible production platform. The adoption

of the A?sgard-B platform as a VMB wave sensor was also motivated by the preliminary



93

evaluation carried out in (WIJAYA, 2009) (chapter 2 includes a review of the work carried

out by Wijaya).

Figure 5.1 shows an aerial photo of the platform as it stands today. The A?sgard-B

unit was installed in the year 2000 in the A?sgard Field located in the Haltenbank area

in the Norwegian Sea, 200km offshore Norway (see Fig. 5.1). The A?sgard development

also includes an internal-turret moored FPSO (A?sgard-A unit) for oil and condensate

production, along with other facilities, such as the A?sgard-C unit (a storage ship) and

several subsea production systems.

The structure of the semisubmersible platform is mainly composed of a rectangular

ring pontoon connected to the deck by six box shaped columns (4 corner columns and 2

center columns). All the equipment necessary to operate the platform, such as processing

facilities, living quarters, utilities to generate power as well as the drilling materials, are

located on the top of the deck supporting structure, at elevation of 54m. The platform is

connected to a spread catenary mooring system consisting of 16 lines and a flexible riser

system consisting of altogether 37 risers (including simple catenary risers, lazy wave and

lazy-S risers)1. A general description of the main dimensions of the A?sgard-B platform is

provided in Tab. 5.1.

The metocean data of the A?sgard (MATHIESEN; NYGAARD, 2013) provides an

idea of how harsh the sea conditions might be in the region where the platform is placed.

For instance, the (omni-directional) significant wave height in this field is characterized

by a mean monthly value that ranges between 3.88m (January) and 1.54m (July), with

a peak periods varying between 2s and 23s. Regarding the maximum (omni-directional)

monthly wave heights, the average value is equal to 11.41m, with maximums up to 16.5m

during the months of December &amp;amp; January. Moreover, the metocean data shows that

the main wind (omni-directional) statistics are featured by a monthly mean wind speed

value of 8.67m/s with a standard deviation equal to 1.51m/s and maximum values equal

to 33.5m/s. Concerning the (omni-directional) data and statistics of the sea currents of

this oil field, the measurements carried out attest that the mean velocity usually ranges

between &amp;lt;0.05m/s and 0.6m/s.

1The scaled semisubmersible platform model used during the experimental at the TPN-USP wave
basin include neither the elements corresponding to the deck nor the submerged systems (moorings &amp;amp;
risers).

Figure 5.1: A?sgard-B floating gas production platform (left) and a sketch showing the
position of the A?sgard field in the Norwegian sea (right), from (STATOIL, 2014).

VMB wave inference will be made based on the three motions in the vertical plane,

namely heave, roll and pitch. The adoption of this set of motions as the basis for esti-

mating the sea conditions will be discussed thoroughly in section 5.4.2. At this point,

however, an analysis of the dynamic characteristics of these motions is important. The

hydrodynamic properties of the semisubmersible unit have been documented by Wijaya

(2009). The unit presents a natural period in heave equal to 24s. The natural periods for

roll and pitch are both well above the wave frequency range of interest, being defined as

74s and 88s, respectively.

These sea conditions are characterized by large wave heights and peak periods. More-

over, although the roll and pitch resonances are not expected to be excited, the sea

conditions tested present significant amounts of energy close to the natural frequency of

the heave motion. Since it is known that the estimation of a linearized viscous damping

is an important source of errors concerning the prediction of the resonant responses, one

may realize that this platform indeed has good response characteristics for being used as

a wave sensor. In fact, the very large natural periods in roll and pitch place their reso-

nances well outside the wave frequency range, thus increasing the reliability of the RAOs

of angular motions in this range. Nonetheless, damping corrections in heave motion are

still necessary, because this motion presents its resonance inside the range of interest of

the current study (focused on long period waves). These corrections have been discussed

with detail in section 5.2.



95

It is worth to remember that the extreme sea conditions of the A?sgard field present

significantly larger peak periods and wave heights that the ones expected, for example,

in the Campos Basin (in Brazil). Notwithstanding this, the experimental campaign also

included calm/mild sea conditions that may be more representative for other O&amp;amp;G fields

different than the ones encountered in the Norwegian continental shelf.

Scaled model

The manufacturing process for the model construction took into account the geomet-

rical complexity of the hull and the need to keep the model light weighted (in order to

guarantee a proper margin for ballast calibration). Considering these restraints, the 3D

printing with nylon sintered material was selected as the best method of construction,

except for the deck, which was made of medium density fiberboard (top sides were not

modelled, as the tests did not include wind effects). As an illustration a 3D sketch and

a photo of the scaled model are presented in Fig. 5.2. The main features of the platform

in model scale are also given in Tab. 5.1. The inertial properties of the model (without

ballast) were confirmed experimentally by means of pendulum tests (roll and pitch). In-

clination tests in still water were made in order to verify the metacentric heights. Finally,

regarding the scale of the model (1:120), it was selected aiming at properly generate all

the wave conditions, even the ones characterized by larger wave steepness (h
?
), and avoid

to exceed the TPN-USP wave basin limits (although a brief review of the main character-

istics of the wave basin is provided in section 5.3, the reader is also referred to (MELLO,

2005) for a detailed description for he TPN-USP wave basin).

5.2 Numerical modelling: Motion RAOs and exter-

nal damping

5.2.1 Introduction

For this case study, the body’s hydrodynamical properties have been obtained with

two different approaches: Frequency and time-domain analysis. The former allows to

obtain the set of motion RAOs that are used in the wave inference process. Alternatively,

time domain simulations were were carried out in order to support the analysis of the non-

linear drag effects, especially those associated with large amplitudes of heave motions near

resonance (see chapter 3). A detailed description of the procedures adopted during the

numerical modelling is provided next, including the analysis of the main results obtained.



97

5.2.2 Frequency-domain analysis

RAOs were computed in frequency-domain using the software WAMIT. This software

is based on the boundary elements method, also known as panel method, that employs

the Green’s second identity to derive the boundary integral equations of a distribution

of sources and doublets over the surface. Thus, the solution of the problem is computed

directly by solving the boundary integral equation system obtained. Moreover, in order to

properly model the geometry of the platform the high-order method was adopted, where

the potential is represented by means of B-spline functions. In our case, the hull geometry

was represented by 52 different patches, which are described by smaller surface elements

(panels) with lengths approximately equal to 5m (in full scale). Then, resulting in that

4760 panels were used to defined the entire hull of the platform. Figure 5.3 illustrates the

geometry considered in this numerical model.

Figure 5.3: Higher order mesh of the semisubmersible platform.

Figure 5.4 shows the RAOs computed in frequency-domain for the heave, roll and pitch

motions. Results are presented for five different wave directions, from 180deg. (or bow

waves, see Fig. 5.5) to 90deg., beam waves (one should remind that the hull is symmetric in

both x and y directions). For the sake of illustration, RAOs were computed with external

damping equal to 0% and 5% (black line), which is a typical value for the external viscous

damping of this kind of floating unit and therefore provides a useful reference. The

RAOs with 5% of external damping are only provided for the most unfavorable direction

regarding for each motion, i.e.: 180deg. for heave and pitch and 90deg. for roll motion.

Figure 5.5: Main wave direction relative to the platform.

These RAOs reflect the dynamic characteristics of the platform discussed in sec-

tion 5.1: The heave motion is the only one with resonance (around 24s, see Tab. 5.1)

inside the wave-frequency range (therefore, the external damping effect is only significant



99

for the heave RAO); roll and pitch natural periods are around 74 and 88 seconds, respec-

tively, and therefore their motions within the wave frequency range are not supposed to

be significantly affected by viscous effects.

In chapter 2 it has been shown that a proper calibration of the external damping is

of major importance for an accurate prediction of the responses of the platform close to

its resonances. Therefore, the adoption of unreliable external damping coefficients may

lead to misleading estimation of the sea conditions that induced the measured motions.

Aiming at avoiding inaccurate estimations of the sea state in this case, a dedicated analysis

in the domain has been carried out to feature the dynamics of the heave motion of the

semisubmersible platform and it is presented in the next section.

5.2.3 Time-domain analysis

As aforementioned, the aim of the time-domain analysis is to evaluate the viscous drag

forces acting on the pontoons of the platform and their impact on the motions, especially

when large amplitudes are involved. The impact of the viscous forces on motion RAOs

are widely documented in the literature, e.g. (CLAUSS et al., 2014). In the present case

the largest influence of the drag forces are found in the heave motion. A proper evaluation

of these effects is necessary, especially because (non-linear) effects may lead to misleading

estimations regarding wave conditions with high periods.

5.2.3.1 Drag effects arising from the pontoons

The software used during this stage was the ANSYS-AQWA Hydrodynamic Time

Response package. Concerning the frequency domain analysis, the panel model is used

to solve the 3-D diffraction/radiation problem and compute the hydrodynamic properties

of the structure under study, such as added mass, potential damping and wave excitation

forces. The time-domain analysis includes the beam model based on Morison equation

(MORISON; JOHNSON; SCHAAF, 1950), see chapter 2, model that is used to estimate

drag induced forces (viscous damping force) acting on the platform by means of the char-

acteristics computed in the frequency-domain. Moreover, due to the linear assumptions

adopted, the models (in frequency and time-domain) can be combined and the advantages

of both models are obtained through this approach.



100

In order to perform the analysis in AQWA, the model was approximated by 11830

panels using the low-order model. In addition, the parts of the pontoons between columns

were modelled as Morison elements in order to introduce the quadratic drag effects. For

instance, the added mass coefficient of these elements, Cm, was set equal to zero and the

drag coefficient, Cd, was estimated using the data obtained during the decay tests (which

are discussed in section 5.3.2).

Figure 5.6 provides an illustration of the heave RAO. Only the heading equal to 180?

is evaluated here, because the heave responses for different headings show only narrow

differences if compared to this direction (see Fig. 5.4). The WAMIT frequency-domain

analysis (with 0% and 5% of external damping) provides a basis of comparison for the time-

domain study. It can be seen that both codes provide similar results for the computations

in frequency-domain with 5% external damping.

The figure also presents the results obtained for different regular wave amplitudes

using the AQWA time-domain package (indicated by AQWA TD). A first set of results

was obtained for a wave steepness of 2%, without considering the Morison elements on

the pontoons (blue circles). It can be seen that the RAO results obtained this way

agree well with the results obtained from frequency-domain, as expected, due to the fact

that non-linear forces have not been included in the analysis. A second set of results was

generated including the Morison elements of the pontoon, for wave steepness of 0.64% and

2% (magenta rhombus and orange squares, respectively). These results, on the one hand,

make the effects of the non-linear drag on the resonant amplification clear (for periods

above 24s). On the other hand, they also show that the cancellation point (period of

zero heave motion slightly above 22s) expected from the potential flow analysis ceases

to exist when the drag forces are considered (the reader is referred to section 3.3.2 and

appendix D for a detailed explanation regarding the origin of this cancellation point and

its main features). For instance, the resulting excitation force of the heave motion would

include a non-linear (extra) drag force component (given by Eq. (3.31)), which leads to a

RAO that is dependent, at the same time, of the amplitude of the motion. Accordingly,

the value of the heave RAO close to the cancellation is expected to be in accordance with

the wave amplitude (i.e. the wave steepness), and therefore reinforcing the relevance of

the analysis carried out using different wave steepnesses.

Figure 5.6 also presents a set of experimental results obtained in regular wave tests

(green triangles). All the experimental tests included, for different wave periods, were

conducted considering a fixed wave steepness of 2%. One may notice that the experi-

mental results confirm the main trends obtained from the time-domain simulations. As

anticipated, these experimental results attest that a proper consideration of the non-linear

viscous effects is necessary for a good prediction of the resonant motions.

Finally, it can be highlighted that the main problem, contrary to the results obtained

through the linear model, is that for the A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform the heave

motion RAO values (close to the resonance) will depend on the incident wave amplitude.

This non-linear effect must be included in the dynamic model of the heave motion of the

floating unit under analysis, topic that has been addressed in section 5.2.4. Regarding full-

scale applications, the reader must keep in mind the importance of a dedicated analysis

to assess the possible non-linear effects arising from the submerged lines of the system

(i.e. moorings and risers) as well as the ones derived from the environmental conditions,

such as winds and currents. As a preliminary evaluation, appendix F provides an analysis

of the possible effects that the submerged lines may have on the responses of the heave

motion close to the resonance.

5.2.4 Viscous drag forces and damping linearization

The reasons why a refined dynamic damping model is needed for the heave motion

were already pointed out. From the experimental data obtained during the decay tests

(see section 5.3.2), it can be observed that the critical damping factor is strongly correlated

with the motion amplitude, as expected. For instance, in section 3.3.2, it has been

highlighted that the damping effects in the heave motion are mainly originated by the

vertical drag generated by separation effects on the pontoons. Moreover, this is attested

by the estimations of the typical KC numbers of the flow, provided in Fig. 3.4, which

show that viscous drag effects on the heave motions become significant in sea conditions

characterized by long waves. Therefore, a method to account for this matter and obtain

an estimation of the linearized equivalent external damping for different Hs is needed.

For this purpose the assumption adopted, and frequently made in the literature, is

that the damping is quadratic. In fact, it is common to assume that the steady-state

motion with frequency ? can be written as, see for instance (FALTINSEN, 1993),

z? + b1z? + b2z?|z?| + cz = Fz exp{i? t} , (5.1)

where b1 is the linear damping coefficient, b2 is the quadratic damping coefficient and c

stands for a linear hydrostatic restoring coefficient.

Since the damping arises essentially from the pontoons, an estimation of the external

damping can be obtained in accordance for a given value of Hs, i.e. ? = f(Hs). This

approximation is possible due to the fact that it is assumed that the platform responses

are still linearly related to the amplitudes of incoming waves. Now, using the Morison

quadratic drag force formula (MORISON; JOHNSON; SCHAAF, 1950), a correction for

the damping factor in the heave motion can be obtained as follows,

dFd =
1

2
?Cdz?|z?|dS ? Fd = b2z?|z?| , (5.2)

being S the cross-sectional area of the pontoon and Cd the two-dimensional drag coefficient

of the sectional area of the pontoon.

In section 3.3.1 it has been shown that the linearization of the drag force is obtained



103

using the well-known method of equivalent energy dissipation (presented, for instance in

Faltinsen (1993)). This method results in an equivalent linear drag factor (b
Equiv
2 ), which

stands as a linearization of the drag factor (b2) and can be written as,

b

2 =

3?
b2 ? z =

3?
b2 ? Re{Az exp{i(? t + ?zz)}} , (5.3)

where ? is the frquency and Az represents the (heave) motion amplitude

Then, the resulting equation of motion would be given by,

z? + (b1 + b
Equiv
2 )z? + cz = Fz exp{i? t} , (5.4)

Finally, since the platform is characterized by a small potential damping, the damping

ratio can be approximated as,

where hpont and bpont represent the height and the beam of the pontoon, respectively. lpont

is the length of the pontoons in-between columns. CD represents the cross-sectional drag

coefficient of the pontoon, a33 the heave added mass for the heave natural frequency and

M the total mass of the platform.

Therefore, with an appropriate value of Cd, an estimation of the heave external damp-

ing can be made based on a certain representative motion amplitude. In an irregular sea

state, however, waves with different frequencies have different amplitudes. Nonetheless,

for the purpose of estimating the damping, the most relevant frequency is the resonant

frequency of motion. Keeping this in mind, an approximation for the representative am-

plitude of resonant heave motion can be approximated as2,

Az =
?

2Szz(?n) · ??n (5.6)
2It is important to remember that for regular waves a direct correspondence between the measured

amplitude, Az, and the estimated representative amplitude of motion (given by eq. (5.6)) is expected.



104

where, once again, Szz(?n) stands as the measured power spectrum of the heave motion

at the natural frequency and ??n is the frequency interval of the spectral analysis close

to the natural frequency (?n), or [?n ? ?(n?1),?(n+1) + ?n]. Since the measured power

spectrum of the heave motion is known from the records of motions of the platform, this

model, thus, allow the estimation of ? for each wave estimation event.

In the following section, the damping results obtained with the proposed procedure

(referred for now on as variable damping model ) are confronted with the damping esti-

mated from the experimental decay tests in heave, showing that indeed a very good fit is

achieved.

It should be noticed that since the heave amplitude Az can be obtained directly from

the platform motion records, the procedure above can be used for pre-callibrating the non-

linear damping level prior to each wave estimation event. In this way, the implementation

is quite simple: All that is needed is a database of RAOs computed for different damping

levels, defined within a specified range. At the moment of the wave estimation, the

inference algorithm computes the representative heave motion amplitude and selects the

most appropriate heave RAO for that particular estimation.

5.3 Experimental setup and tests description

5.3.1 General

The model tests were carried out in the Numerical Offshore Tank (TPN-USP) facil-

ities, in the USP. The wave basin is a squared (14.0m × 14.0m × 4.1m) tank able to

generate and absorb waves from 0.5Hz to 2.0Hz (see (MELLO et al., 2013)), by means of

a set of 148 flap-type wavemakers. Figure 5.7 shows a sketch of the wave basin and one

of the horizontal mooring arrangements adopted during the experimental campaign.

The model was placed in the middle of the basin and its horizontal excursions were

restricted by a soft mooring system, above the waterline3. As a matter of fact, the

objective of the mooring was only to keep the model offsets within the range of optical

motion-tracking system. Therefore, the stiffness of the system was kept as low as possible

3It is worthy to remember that neither mooring lines nor risers were modelled during the experimental
campaign.



105

in order to have little effect on the first order motions of the platform. The overall stiffness

in both horizontal directions (x and y) was confirmed by means of pull-out tests, obtaining

that their values were both equal to 241.05kN/m, in full-scale.

In order to guarantee a small influence of the mooring system on the responses of the

pitch and roll motions, the lines were attached to the hull of the platform at a height

corresponding to the centre of gravity of the model (see Tab. 5.1). Furthermore, the

results of the inclination tests were used to ensure that the expected geometric properties

(centre of gravity, metacentric height, etc.) did not present significant changes.

The adoption of a mooring system characterized by a low horizontal stiffness resulted

in high resonant periods for the motions in the x?y plane, i.e. 113s, 116s and 87s for the

surge, sway and yaw motions, respectively. Consequently, the resonances of these motions

were not excited by the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign, which

only presented energy in periods ranging between 5 and 33s.

The campaign comprised only one draft (operational) and five wave headings from

bow waves to beam waves (in this case: 180?, 150?, 135?, 120? and 80?). Since one end

of the tank acted as an actuator (generating the waves) and the other end was used as

a wave-absorbing surface for all the sea condition tested, the correct heading conditions

were guaranteed by means of changing the (relative) orientation of the model in the

tank (always keeping the mooring characteristics unchanged). Finally, it is important to

remember that during the tests, the motions of the model were recorded with a Qualisysr

optical tracking system.

5.3.2 Motion decay tests

Decay tests were performed in still water for motions in the six dofs, in order to

determine the natural periods and the damping characteristics of the semisubmersible

platform model. For each motion, tests with four different initial amplitudes were carried

out, with three repetitions each.

For avoiding spurious excitation of motions other than the ones being tested, a specific

set up was used for the decay tests. This set up essentially comprised a set of bars and

pulleys with a high resistance wire, used for moving the model and keeping it in the



106

and stiffness of the mooring lines. Adapted from Mello (2005).

required initial position for each test. After releasing the model, all the motions were

tracked by the Qualisysr optical system. Figure 5.8 provides an illustration of the time

series for the decay tests concerning the heave, roll and pitch motions, respectively (in

model-scale). From this figure one may realize the similarities between the roll and pitch

motions. Furthermore, it shows that the three motions assessed are characterized by a

small potential damping, resulting, thus, in time series of the decay tests featured with

several cycles.

The method adopted for characterizing the non-linear damping in each test is essen-

tially the one proposed in (FALTINSEN, 1993), which considers a linear and a quadratic

damping term (Eq. (5.2)). The former is supposed constant while the later is expressed

as a function of the motion amplitude. For illustration purposes, Fig. 5.9 presents the

results obtained in tests for four different motions (namely: Heave, roll, pitch and yaw).

In this case, however, instead of presenting linear and quadratic damping coefficients, the

results are combined and expressed as a percentage of the critical damping ratio for each

amplitude (? = b1+b2

).

Figure 5.8: Time series of the decay tests, for heave, roll and pitch motions.

Given the geometry of the semisubmersible, with the pontoons placed at relatively

large depth, a comparison between damping estimations obtained from tests in waves

and in still water (decay tests) is illustrative. For doing this, the method proposed in

section 5.2.4 for computing the heave damping from drag estimations was applied. The

results were generated considering all the 32 different irregular waves tested in the wave

basin, which will be discussed in section 5.3.3 (see Tab. 5.3 for data on the different

irregular waves). For each one of them, a representative resonant heave amplitude was

obtained according to Eq. (5.6) while the damping ratio was computed with Eq. (5.5). The

damping ratios obtained from the irregular wave tests as a function of the resonant heave

amplitudes were then compared to the estimations derived from the heave decay tests (see

Fig. 5.9). The agreement between the different estimations is shown in Fig. 5.10. One

may notice that the damping ratio estimated from the irregular wave tests (black dots)

indeed presents narrow differences with the linear fitting (red line) of the data obtained

in the heave decay tests performed in calm water (blue triangles).

The good agreement attests that the heave damping is indeed dominated by the

pontoon motions and that effect of the wave flow on the damping force is small, even for

the largest wave amplitudes that were tested. In this sense, the good fit with the decay

data indicates that the method proposed indeed is adequate for estimating the resonant

heave damping of the hull in waves4.

5.3.3 Wave tests

Transient and regular wave tests

Transient wave tests (CLAUSS, 1999) were used to verify the accuracy of the linear

motion RAOs predicted by the numerical model. For this reason, the wave steepness was

kept below 4% for all the tests. The range of periods for the generation of the transient

waves was set from 8 to 24 seconds (values in full-scale), with a constant wave amplitude

equal to 1.68m. Tests had a duration equivalent to 240 seconds in full-scale, guaranteeing

4It is important to keep in mind that the effects of mooring lines as well as risers are not included
in this assessment. The reader is referred to appendix F for a preliminary evaluation of the possible
dynamic effects resulting from the submerged lines.

at least 10 cycles (ITTC, 2014) of the heave motion in the resonant frequency.

In addition, a set of 33 tests in regular waves was carried out for a better evaluation of

the non-linear effects on the RAOs. Again, the wave period ranged from 8 to 24 seconds,

but different wave amplitudes were tested corresponding to wave steepnesses of 2%, 4%

and 6%.

Figure 5.11 illustrates the level of agreement obtained between the motion RAOs

derived from the wave tests (both for transient and regular waves) and those derived

numerically. Results correspond to a wave heading of 135deg. and comprise only the

three motions that were used for the purpose of wave inference (heave, roll, pitch). Due

to the technical limitations of the wave basin, the estimations of the RAOs obtained by

means of the regular waves with 4% and 6% steepnesses arrive up to 22s. Nonetheless,

it can be seen that the agreement for the angular motions is good for the whole range of

frequencies. This was indeed expected because neither roll or pitch resonate in the wave

frequency range. For the heave motion, on the other hand, the agreement is good for wave

periods up to 20 seconds. As anticipated in chapter 3 and in section 5.2.3, discrepancies



110

rise for larger periods and are associated to viscous effects within the resonant range (see

Fig. 3.4). In this case, the numerical heave RAOs were computed with ? = 5% as well

as with ? = 3.81% and ? = 6.89%. The two last damping values (3.81% and 6.89%)

were computed through the procedure proposed in section 5.2.4 and correspond to the

amplitude deduced from the transient wave and the regular wave with steepness equal

to 2%, respectively. Since the effects that the damping has on the numerical roll and

pitch RAOs in the period range of interest are negligible, only the roll and pitch RAOs

computed with ? = 5% have been included.

Regarding the use of the heave motion for wave inference, these results show that the

possible discrepancies close to the resonance can be mitigated with the use of a proper

damping model, which provides a better adjustment of the resonant amplification for wave

periods around the natural one. Another source of error, namely the one related to the

motions observed close to the numerical cancellation point, is, however, more difficult to



111

mitigate.

Irregular wave tests

The wave conditions for the of irregular waves (sea states) were selected from the

wave statistics of the A?sgard field documented by Mathiesen and Nygaard (2013). Along

with the brief description of the main characteristics of this field provided in section 5.1,

Tab. 5.2 provides a general picture regarding the annual probability of exceedance of the

(omni-directional) extreme wave conditions (significant wave height and peak period).

Furthermore, as previously pointed out in section 3.2.2, the JONSWAP and Torsethaugen

wave spectra stand as the most representative wave spectrum models for the sea conditions

observed in the A?sgard field.

Table 5.2: Annual probability of the input parameter used for some of the sea tests
conditions.

10?1 14.1 16.9
10?2 16.4 18.1
10?4 20.8 20.3

The experimental campaign comprised a set of 32 sea conditions with their corre-

sponding peak periods (Tp) and significant wave heights (Hs), ranging from mild waves

with high probability of occurrence to extreme 100yr-return events. It should be high-

lighted that for the experimental campaign carried out with the semisubmersible platform

only long crested sea conditions were generated due to technical limitations of the wave

basin. Following the recommendation proposed in (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004),

some of the sea conditions were generated using a double peak (in frequency-domain)

wave spectrum, more specifically the Torsethaugen wave spectrum.

The sea conditions generated in the wave basin by means of this spectrum were se-

lected based on the approach proposed by Torsethaugen and Haver (2004). This method-

ology is based on the estimations of a peak period threshold, which is referred to by

the authors as limiting spectral peak period and defined by the relation Tpf = 6.6H
1/3
s .

Thus, if the expected peak period of the sea (Tp) was located within a band given by

Tpf ± 2 seconds, the JONSWAP standard model was adopted to generate the spectrum

and otherwise, the spectrum was generated using the Torsethaugen spectrum. Figure 3.1



112

provides a comparison between the Torsethaugen spectrum and an equivalent JONSWAP

spectrum for the same significant wave height and peak period.

Table 5.3 shows the input parameters used for all the sea tests conditions. During

the experimental campaign the time duration of each test was equivalent to three hours

in full-scale (16.4min in model-scale), which were split in two intervals of 1.5 hours each5.

the theoretical spectra. Also, the phase seed used to generate the randomness of the wave

record was different for each 1.5h half test, providing two different realizations of the same

sea condition.

In order to provide a general idea of the results obtained Fig. 5.12 has been in-

cluded, which presents the water surface elevation for the first realization of sea condition

STA-IRR-29. In this case Hmax corresponds to 23.4m and over the whole experimental

campaign the maximum wave height recorded was equal to 26.6m.

Wave calibration

Wave calibration tests were performed in the absence of the semisubmersible model

and the evaluation of the wave spectrum within the test zone was performed by means

of an array of three wave probes. The quality of the waves generated in the basin was

checked considering the main statistical parameters. In most of the cases, the values of Tp

and Hs were close to the requested values in the first wave execution. In this calibration

procedure, the maximum frequency of the spectrum computed was 2Hz, corresponding

to 5.5 seconds in full-scale. The procedure has guaranteed that errors in the values of Tp

and Hs were lower than 5% for all tests.

5.3.4 Wave spectra estimation from wave probes

As pointed out in section 5.3.3, wave calibration tests were performed in the absence

of the semisubmersible model by means of an array of three wave probes. Figure 5.15

showed some examples of the sea spectrum measured. It included sea states generated

using a JONSWAP and Torsethaugen sea spectra, as well as different sea conditions.

From this figure one may realize that all the different sea conditions were generated with

reasonable accuracy.

Experimental measurements of the directional wave spectrum

In order to provide a reference for evaluating the accuracy of the seas estimated using

the VMB wave inference algorithm, an array of eight wave probes has been used to measure

the directional wave spectrum in the wave basin. Once again, the measurements were

made in the absence of the semisubmersible model. The procedure adopted to measure

directional waves follows the one proposed by Nwogu (1989), applying the Maximum

Entropy Method (MEM). A good explanation of the procedure adopted for estimating

the spectrum from the wave records can be found in Tannuri et al. (2007). The disposition

of the wave probes is similar to the one proposed in Stansberg (1998), with six capacitive

wave probes placed in the vertices of a regular hexagon with a circumradius equal to

0.4m, plus two central ones. Figure 5.16 provides a view of the wave probes arrangement

installed in the basin.

For illustrative purposes, Fig. 5.17 presents the results obtained with MEM method

for the irregular waves generated in four different tests, which were selected among the 32

sea conditions in order to provide a representative sample of the whole range of periods

that was tested. In these polar plots, the wave energy in each wave frequency (radial

coordinate in rad/s, with values given in full-scale) is depicted for all wave directions (as

a convention, the wave direction in the tank was considered as 180deg.). In addition,

the main statistical parameters for each wave condition are presented at the top of each

figure. It should be stressed that, instead of the peak period, the mean central period T1

is used for evaluating the results (as diescussed previously in section 3.2).

All the waves generated in the basin were long-crested, as pointed out in section 5.3.3,

meaning that no directional energy spreading was considered in the wave generation. For

this reason, one may realize that the wave spectra measured with the MEM method have

energy concentrated in a very narrow range around the mean direction (the directional

resolution considered in the spectral analysis corresponded to ?? = 5 degrees, the same

that has been employed for the VMB wave inference, whose results will be presented in

section 5.4).

5.4 Directional wave spectrum estimation based on

model test data

This section is divided in four different sections in order to arrange the results in a

logical sequence. First, a discussion regarding the optimal sample time for each sea con-

dition tested in the wave basin is provided in section 5.4.1. Section 5.4.2 contains the an

assessment of the motion basis (heave-roll-pitch) adopted for wave inference. The analy-

sis of the adequacy regarding the motion basis has been carried out based on coherence

functions. Section 5.4.3 provides a comparison between the outcomes of the wave infer-

ence algorithm obtained using the different sets of RAOs proposed in section 5.2. The

VMB wave inference method adopted in section 5.4.3 corresponds to the conventional

approach, whose reliability to estimate different sea conditions has been shown by the

results provided in different works (SIMOS et al., 2012; BISPO et al., 2016). Therefore,

it provides a consistent framework to compare and select the most appropriate set of

RAOs. In section 5.4.4, the main results obtained from this analysis are compared with

the sea estimations determined by means of the alternative prior distribution proposed in

chapter 3.

5.4.1 Selection of the optimal sample time for each sea condition

Previously, in chapter 4, it has been pointed out that it is usually assumed that the

stationary time span of a sea state may range between 20m and 3h (the reader is referred

to (SOARES; FRICKE, 2011) for more details regarding the stationary time span of

different sea conditions). Nonetheless, from a practical point of view, this assumption

may lead to a large uncertainty regarding the ideal sampling time (or optimal run length)

of a wave record, due to the wide interval of time that this assumption involves.

Since the main scope of this work do not include the analysis of this topic, only a

brief discussion is included here and a more detailed assessment of the procedure followed

to determine the run length of each test can be found in appendix B. In theory, the

methodology followed should work properly if the measurement of the wave elevation of

a stationary sea state is used as an input (once again, see appendix B). However, for full-

scale applications in VMB wave inference, only the measured motions of the platform are



119

provided. It has been shown in appendix B that the statistical properties of the motion

spectra cannot be assumed stationary. Nonetheless, certain applications, such as the

semisubmersible platform under study, that presents a fixed heading relative to the seabed

and a constant operational draft, may provide reliable information about the optimal

sample time through the measured motions. In order to provide a preliminary evaluation,

the optimal sample time for each condition tested in the wave basin was estimated based

on the measured motions of the model-scale platform during the experimental campaign.

This technique provides time series with the same statistical significance, since it aims

at keeping the variance of a certain estimator always below a given value. As a result of

the adoption of the measured heave motion as the input to estimate the sample time, the

estimator provided by Eq. (B.16) has been selected as indicator. Figure 5.18 shows the

coefficient of variability of the estimator for all the sea conditions tested in the wave basin

as a function of the time, based on the measured heave motion of the model. Lines with

the same color stand for the same sea condition, with the continuous line being the first

realization and the dashed line the second realization of the same sea condition using a

different phase seed, with a total time duration of 1.5 hour, each. As a consequence of

keeping the model of the platform as simple as possible and the fact that the test matrix

was composed by long crested wave conditions, the coefficient of variability of the temporal

variance estimator selected was characterized by extremely low values. Accordingly, the

threshold adopted to determine the sample time was given by a coefficient of variability

of the temporal variance estimator equal to 1.2%.

The resulting total sample time obtained for each test is provided in Fig. 5.19. In

order to show a general idea about the results obtained through the analysis, this figure

also includes the estimated mean value for all the test conditions (41.5min) and the 25th

and 75th percentiles, which are equal to 31.6min and 56.5min, respectively. Also, the

minimum time used for the analysis, corresponding to 30 minutes, and the maximum test

time, 90 minutes, are included by the dashed blue and red lines. From this figure one

may realize that the optimal sample time for extreme sea conditions will be larger than

the sample time expected for calm sea conditions, as it is expected.

The largest sample time concerns the first realization of the test number 23. From

Tab. 5.3, it is known that this sea condition was generated using a JONSWAP spectrum,

with significant wave height equal to 10m and peak period of 14.5s. Some examples

of a comparison between the theoretical and the estimated spectrum obtained in each



121

repetition are included in Fig 5.15. Test number 23 has been included among the different

examples provided in Fig. 5.15, and it presents no significant deviation from the theoretical

spectrum. Therefore, the large duration of the wave record can be associated to the

random nature of the statistical properties of the motions spectra and the extremely low

threshold adopted for the coefficient of variability of the temporal variance estimator

(1.2%).

In order to provide a general benchmark for the results presented in Fig. 5.19 the

guidelines presented in (ITTC, 2014) have been followed. As a matter of fact, the guide-

lines proposed by the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) use the number of

waves (encounters), N, obtained during the test to determine the optimal rung length

of each test and can be summarized as follows: (i) N = 50 should be taken as a lower

limit; (ii) N = 100 is accepted as a standard and (iii) N = 200 or larger is considered

as an excellent practice. In this case, for comparison purposes, N = 200 to compute the

optimal sample time. The results of this analysis shown in Fig. 5.20.

The results obtained following the approach proposed in (ITTC, 2014) are character-

ized by leading to lower sample values than the ones provided in Fig.5.19 (also included

in Fig. 5.20). This is well illustrated by the mean value obtained for the outputs of

the ITTC method (equal to 34.4min) as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles, equal to

31.4min. and 37.2min., respectively. Furthermore, the estimations obtained for some of

the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign show values even lower than

30min. Other characteristic of the outputs obtained following the ITTC guidelines is the

strong correlation between the recommended sample time and the increase of the incre-

ment of the peak period, as expected. Moreover, the right side of the figure shows the

histogram of the results obtained with a class interval equal to 1min, showing that the

ITTC estimations have a narrower distribution that the ones presented in Fig. 5.19.

The results obtained in Fig. 5.20 attested that the methodology followed in this work

to determine the sample time provides, in general, larger run lengths than the ones ob-

tained through the ITTC guidelines. As a consequence, the procedure adopted results in

sample times that can be considered indeed, following the guidelines described in (ITTC,

2014), as an excellent practice for the characterization of the sea conditions.

It is important to understand the possible effects of the sample time on the wave

inference. For the sake of illustration Tab. 5.4 has been included, which for the time

being must be intended as quantitative comparison rather than a qualitative one. In

this case the table provides the results obtained using the inference approach (which are

analyzed with further detail in section 5.4.3), for sea condition 23 using three 30min time

span intervals as well as the sample time estimated previously, i.e. 79.1min. Moreover, the

measurements obtained using the wave probes (corresponding to wave record of 79.1min)

are also included in this table as general reference for the estimations. From these results

it can be stated that there are no significant differences between the estimations obtained

regarding all the parameters evaluated (i.e. significant wave height, peak period and

mean wave direction) when using different time lengths and intervals. Nonetheless, it is

important to highlight the fact that as the test progresses there is a tendency that results

in slight increments of the wave statistical values. This effect may be related to the small

amount of energy that is not absorbed by basin absorbtion system (see (MELLO et al.,

2013)). However, it shows that if the stationary condition is not accurate for short time



123

intervals (see for instance (HAVER; MOAN, 1983)) the adoption of short sample time

may lead to misleading estimations of the sea states.

In this work the methodology described above, and which results are presented in

Fig. 5.19, has been followed to estimate the optimal sample time to estimate the sea

states. This approach will ensure similar statistical significance of the results and, at the

same time.

Regarding full-scale applications, however, this approach is expected to present several

limitations. First, usually only the time motion time series are recorded (the use of

full-scale waves probes still, generally, limited to few research projects). Secondly, it is

already known that the sea surface elevation time series (as well as the motion time series)

often result in a non-stationary process, thus (in theory) the run length value estimated

thought this technique may not be optimal. Finally, the results of this method may

vary in accordance with the threshold value selected. For instance, if it is increased to

5%, Fig. 5.18 shows that the expected sample duration for all the sea conditions tested

would be 40min., except for the test 23 that would present a run length equal to 45min.

Therefore, for full-scale applications, the common practice of adopting 30min intervals

may be considered reasonable.

5.4.2 An analysis of the adequacy of the heave-roll-pitch mo-
tion basis for VMB wave inference based on coherence
functions

Previously, at the beginning of this chapter, it has been pointed out that the VMB

wave inference will be made based on the three motions, namely heave, roll and pitch.

The adoption of this basis is primarily due to the analogy with wave buoys, which usually

take into account the set of motions with vertical movements as a base for estimation the

sea states (see, for instance (TANNURI et al., 2003)). Next, the adequacy of this basis

(heave, roll and pitch) is evaluated by means of coherence functions.

The degree of linear dependency between two signals can be quantified by means

of the coherence function, which provides a measurement of the causality between the

input and the output of a linear system. For the purpose of this thesis, it stands as

an assessment of the linearity between the incoming wave, ?, and motion response, ?.

Regarding the output of this function, it varies between zero and one. Therefore, if ? and

? are uncorrelated the sample coherence converges to zero. On the other hand, values

equal to one indicate linearity between the excitation and the response.

The coherence function between ? and ? for a certain frequency, f?, is defined as

follows (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010),

?? ?(f
?) =

S? ?(f
?)S?? (f

?)

S??(f?)S??(f?)
, (5.7)

where S??(f
?)S?? (f

?) = S??(f
?)S???(f

?) = |S??(f?)|2. Thus,

???(f
?) =

|S??(f?)|2

S??(f?)S??(f?)
, (5.8)

Figure 5.21 and Fig. 5.22 show the coherence function values computed for the six

motions of the semisubmersible platform. These figures include the results obtained for

all the 32 sea conditions tested in wave basin for beam and quartering sea conditions,

? = 90deg. &amp;amp; ? = 135deg. respectively. Due to the geometrical properties of the hull of

the A?sagrd-B platform, the results shown in these figures provide sufficient information

about the responses of the platform regarding other heading conditions.

Figure 5.22: Coherence function for quartering seas.

Figure 5.21 shows that the coherence functions of sway, heave and roll motion are

close to one in periods between 10s and 20s. Hence, it shows that linear dynamics are



126

indeed dominant in sway, heave and roll motions in this frequency range. Nonetheless,

the values of the coherence function concerning the surge, pitch and yaw motions indicate

lack of linearity between the excitation and the responses. This is due to the fact that

this motions (in theory) are not excited in beam sea conditions. Therefore, the outputs

of the coherence functions are expected to be lower than one.

Returning to the sway, heave and roll coherence functions presented in Fig. 5.21,

one may realize that close to 10s all of them present a local minimum, indicating that

low linearity is expected between the excitation and the responses. Aiming to properly

illustrate the origin of this minimum Fig. 5.23 has been included. This figure shows

the coherence functions concerning tests 02 and 31 for the heave motion (in red), for

quartering sea conditions. Moreover, the spectrum for each sea condition (blue line) and

the theoretical heave RAO (black line) are provided. It is possible to identify by simple

comparison that the minimum that the coherence function presents close to 10s is related

to the cancellation point that the RAO presents at the same period. Similarly, the minima

in the sway and roll motions in this period range are related to the zero points of the RAO

(see Fig. 3.10). The values obtained of the coherence functions for the high period range

(T &gt; 20s) also show low values, which can be related to the small amounts of energy that

the wave spectra tested present in this period interval. It is important to highlight the fact

that the heave coherence functions do not present a minimum close to the cancellation

point of the heave RAO in 22s. As it has been show in section 5.4.1 it is expected, due to

non-linear drag effects, that the platform will present motions with significant amplitudes

close to this period. Therefore, the resulting values of the coherence functions indicate

that non-linear responses are expected.

The coherence functions for model tests in quartering sea condition presented in

Fig. 5.22 show that linear effects are dominating in periods between 10s and 20s, for

all the dofs assessed. These results are in accordance with the previous analysis regarding

carried out using the result presented in Fig. 5.21 and 5.23.

The analysis of the linear dynamic model provided above allows the assessment of

adequacy of motion basis selected for VMB wave inference. First, it is important to state

that the yaw motion in this case was not considered for VMB wave inference due to

the uncertainty regarding the full-scale inertia properties of the platform around the z

(vertical)-axis6. From the previous Fig. 5.21 and 5.22 one may realize that the use of the

surge and sway motions could provide relevant information about some sea conditions in

the low frequency range. However, for beam and head sea conditions, these will result

in that at least two dofs of the base adopted to estimate the sea conditions are expected

to present no significant linear wave excitations. As a consequence, these motions will

be predominantly driven by other factors, e.g. as winds, currents or even low frequency

waves drifting forces (WIJAYA, 2009). Therefore, the use of the 5 motions as the base to

estimate the sea conditions, for this semisubmersible platform, will result in the escalation

of the uncertainties inherent to the problem. Consequently, the base of motions selected to

estimate the sea conditions based on the measured motion of a semisubmersible platform

will be composed by: Heave, roll and pitch.

Finally, another use of the coherence function is the one proposed by Nielsen (2005).

The main idea is to use the coherence function as a normalization factor for the measured

motions of the floating vessel. This approach guarantees that motions with strong linear-

ities in a certain frequency range will be advantaged at the expense of the ones that are

expected to present no significant linearities. However, the lack of the physical quantifi-

cation of the motion (it does not provide comparative values for different motions such

as heave and pitch responses) of this technique usually leads to misleading estimations.

The method followed in this thesis normalizes the motion signals by means of using

the main dimensions of the platform. Therefore, the angular motions will be multiplied by

a certain linear dimension, i.e. the half beam of the platform or the half length, for the roll

and pitch motions, respectively. This procedure does not guarantee that all the recorded

motions will present the same uncertainty (because the RAOs vary in the frequency range).

Nevertheless, the alternative methodology to deduce the prior distribution proposed in

section 4.4.2 improves this shortcoming by using the measured motions and increasing

the uncertainty of the estimation close to the point of minima of the RAOs.

5.4.3 Wave inference using the conventional prior distribution

In the following, the results obtained with the wave inference method based on the mo-

tions of the semisubmersible model are presented and confronted with the measurements

performed in the wave basin with conventional wave probes, with the following objec-

tives: (i) to evaluate the impact of the viscous drag forces on the RAOs, as discussed in

chapter 3 and (ii) to provide a general assessment of the use of a large semisubmersible

as a VMB wave sensor.

Accordingly to the results provided in section 5.4.2, the motion base adopted for

the analysis comprises only three motions, namely: Heave, roll and pitch. On the one

hand, three different sets of RAOs were employed as alternatives for modelling the heave

motions: One with a constant external damping coefficient corresponding to 5% of the



129

critical damping, which is a typical value for the external viscous damping of this kind

of floating unit and is in accordance with the results obtained through the experimental

decay tests of the heave motion. Secondly, the set of RAOs resulting of the variable

damping method in heave computed following the procedure proposed in section 5.2.

In the third place, aiming at providing a reference framework, the RAOs derived from

time-domain simulations in the software ANSYS-AQWA with a wave steepness equal to

2%, which includes the pontoon drag forces (see Fig. 5.6). As a matter of fact, this

heave motion RAO has been adopted to assess the possible impact that the non-linear

effects may have on the estimations. On the other hand, the roll and pitch motions are

characterized by high resonant periods (see section 5.1). Therefore, these motions were

modelled for all the cases by means of the RAOs estimated through the frequency-domain

analysis. Finally, in order to estimate the sea conditions, twenty different wave frequencies

were considered, with a spatial resolution of ?? = 5 degrees (corresponding to M=20 and

K=72, see chapter 4).

Regarding the values of the hyperparameters, an extensive sensitivity analysis has

been performed in order to obtain the optimal values. Thus, it was determined that: u1

remains equal as the one proposed in (BISPO, 2011a), where the author proposes the

estimation of the value of the first hyperparameter by means linear interpolation. For

instance, Bispo (2011a) interpolates the value of u1 within a range given by the interval

[0.00208 0.02000] and using the mean zero up-crossing period of the heave motions,

which must range between 7.5s and 14s. In those cases where the estimated mean zero

up-crossing period is larger than 14s, u1 is assumed equal to 0.02. For u2, the optimal

value is given by 1 · 10?5 and u3 is set to 0.0035. The small value of u2, if compared with

the value provided in (BISPO et al., 2012), arises from the narrow differences between

the beam and length of the platform, which produce complementary RAOs for roll and

pitch motions. This resemblance maintains all the zero points of the roll and pitch RAOs

limited to certain frequency ranges and, therefore, larger values of u2 are no longer needed.

From a practical point of view, it is also important to remind that the VMB wave esti-

mations were made considering the acquisition time determined in section 5.4.1, following

the procedure provided in appendix B.

For all the results shown ahead, the computations were carried out with a desk-



130

top personal computer using MATLABr2014a, which contains the toolbox solver7 for

numerical optimization that was used to estimate the minimum of the objective function

derived from the Bayesian approach.

In Figs. 5.24 to 5.278 the reliability of the estimations was evaluated by means of the

relative errors. Accordingly, the vertical axes of these figures provide the relative errors

of the following statistics:

• Significant wave height (Hs), whose relative error is given by,

?Hs =
Hm ?Hs
Hm

, (5.9)

where Hm stands as the measured significant wave height and Hs is the value esti-

mated from the model motions;

• Mean wave period (T1), that leads to the following relative error,

?T1 =
Tm ?T1
Tm

, (5.10)

where Tm stands as the measured mean wave period and T1 is the estimated value

of the mean wave period. It must be emphasized, once again, that the platform is

expected to filter certain part of the energy placed in the high frequency range. For

this reason, T1 has been adopted instead of Tp, for being a better indicator of the

distribution of the energy.

The relative errors in the wave statistics are presented as a function of the (measured)

mean period (T1) of the waves in each test, given in the lower horizontal axis. The upper

axis indicates the corresponding (measured) significant wave heights, in meters, so that

the reader can easily assess the agreement obtained with the VMB wave inference method

7In this case the optimization toolbox adopted uses the quadprog as a solver.
8The prediction of the mean direction was very accurate for all the conditions tested. Therefore, only

the relative errors regarding the significant wave height and the mean wave period are provided in these
figures. Regarding the mean wave direction ?, the relative error may be written as,

?? =
?s ??m

?
,

where ?m stands as the measured mean wave direction and ?s is the estimated value of the significant
wave height.



131

for different wave periods and heights. Moreover, it should be noticed that these figures

present three sets of results, that correspond to the estimations obtained using the RAOs

described above.

Figure 5.27: Results of the wave inference method estimated with different sets of RAOs
for the heading 135?, concerning the second realization.

It must be realized that the results are clustered into two different sets with different

colors, indicating whether the waves generated in the basin corresponded to a JONSWAP



135

(blue) or Torsethaugen (red) power spectrum.

Finally, one should also notice that the figures referred above only include information

for waves coming from 90? and 135?. The reason for this is that the results obtained for

other heading conditions tested during the experimental campaign do not provide any

meaningful new information, as it will be shown ahead in section 5.4.3. For each heading,

two analogous figures are included, corresponding to the two realization of the same sea

conditions carried out in the experimental campaign. Based on these figures, a detailed

discussion of the performance of the VMB wave inference method will be presented next.

Discussion

Many aspects of the results presented above deserve attention. First, by inspecting

the error statistics obtained with the wave inference method, it can be concluded that

the overall agreement with the expected values is indeed very good for all the headings

analyzed.

Regarding specifically the significant wave height, the inference method tends to un-

derestimate the experimental values, with errors always below 18% for the most unfavor-

able heading (90?) and only 9% for the most favorable one (135?). It must be emphasized

that the underestimation observed is indeed consistent with the expected bias of the

method, since part of the energy in the high frequency wave components is filtered as

these waves do not impose large motions on the platform. It is also important to observe

that the level of underestimation and the difference in this level for the different headings

tend to decrease as the wave period increases, thus favoring the results for the most severe

sea states.

The results obtained for the predicted mean wave periods (T1) are also consistent with

the bias of the method. Since energy is filtered from the wave components with higher

frequencies, the mean frequency of the estimated spectrum tends to be lower than the

real one and, consequently, the mean period tends to be higher. Nonetheless, the results

show that differences are not large, with errors below 15% in all cases. Once again, the

errors decrease for larger wave periods, as should be expected.

Figures 5.24 to 5.26 also allow an assessment of the influence of the different heave

RAO models on the VMB predictions. It is interesting to realize that the main influence



136

arising from the consideration of pontoon drag effects occurs in the estimation of the

significant wave height. Moreover, the discrepancies in the wave height predicted by

the different models increase for larger periods. This was already expected and happens

due to the fact that these waves induce resonant heave motions, where the three sets

of RAOs adopted behave differently. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that the

results obtained for the Torsethaugen wave spectrum show larger discrepancies between

the three models. This is due to fact that in general the Torsethaugen condition are

estimated with less accuracy than the JONSWAP sea condition, as a consequence of

filtering the high frequency components of the spectrum. Therefore, small changes in

the low frequency range lead to more relevant differences than in sea states generated by

means of the JONSWAP sea spectrum.

Since the results provided in this figures are characterized by a large variability, which

makes it difficult to identify a clear tendency among the results obtained, a more detailed

analysis of the results provided in the figures above is done next.

As pointed out in section 5.2.3 and in the previous section, the set of RAOs derived

from the time-domain simulations allows a sensitivity analysis of the effects that non-linear

responses may have on the estimation. However, the usefulness of the RAOs obtained

numerically is limited due to the fact that the main characteristics of the sea conditions

should be known a priori in order to compute the most appropriate set of RAOs. Conse-

quently, only the sets of RAOs obtained through the variable damping model or assuming

a constant damping model are eligible, in practice. It is worth remembering that the

RAOs derived from time domain simulations have been included in order to provide a

reference benchmark, thus allowing an early assessment of the possible effect that may

arise if non-linear dynamics are take into account. For instance, the results obtained show

that large discrepancies are not expected.

One may find that the results in the Figs. 5.24 to 5.27 are somewhat inconclusive when

it comes to selecting the most appropriate set of RAOs. Therefore, aiming to provide all

the data in a suitable and manageable form, Tab. 5.5 is included herein. This table

provides the mean value of the relative errors (regarding the significant wave height and

the mean wave period) obtained from both headings analyzed and the two sea realizations.

Also, the results are clustered by the model of RAOs used. The differences between the



137

results predicted adopting different models increase for larger periods, due to the induced

heave motions near the resonance. Therefore, only the 10 sea conditions with the largest

mean wave periods have been included in the table.

The results provided in Tab. 5.5 show that the damping models adopted to compute

the RAOs of the semisubmersible platform do not lead to significant differences between

the estimations of the sea conditions. Although the variable damping model in general

provides slightly smaller values for the relative errors of the significant wave height and

mean wave period than the constant damping model (in Tab. 5.5) none of these models can

be conclusively selected as the most accurate. However, due to the practical advantages

that the variable damping model provides, such as the fact that it does not rely on any

experiment tests, it will be adopted in this thesis.

For a first assessment of the other statistical parameters, namely the mean wave di-

rection and the wave spreading, Figs. 5.28 and 5.29 provide the directional wave spectra

estimated for the same sea conditions previously displayed in Fig. 5.17, for the two differ-

ent heading conditions. These spectra were estimated using the set of RAOs computed

by means of the variable damping model. In these figures, the accuracy regarding the

estimation of the mean wave direction (?) can be assessed reminding that the expected

wave direction in the wave basin is always 180?. Although all these examples are provided

for illustration purposes due to the fact that only long crested wave conditions were gen-

erated in the basin, more results of the directional sea spectrum obtained by means the

conventional approach can be assessed in Figs. 5.39 and 5.40.



138

The spreading of the measured wave spectrum is larger than the one estimated by

means of wave probes and the using MEM. The larger spreading of wave energy when using

the Bayesian inference method is related to the calibration of the hyper-parameter u1,

which controls the level of smoothness of the spectrum with respect to the wave direction.

In this case, the pre-calibration of the hyparameter was made seeking to improve the

accuracy in the prediction of the main statistical wave parameters (T1, Hs and ?), a

procedure that ultimately tends to lead to a larger wave spreading. Notwithstanding this,

the sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign (long crested) do not stand

as the most appropriate sea condition to assess the reliability of the direction spreading.

As a matter of fact, the prior distribution adopted results from the assumption that the

sea spectrum must be smooth in frequency and direction. Thus, the long crested sea

conditions tested during the experimental campaign stand as limiting conditions for the

wave inference method adopted (see, for instance section 4.4).

The results in Figs. 5.24 to 5.27 show that the spreading increases for sea conditions

characterized with higher peak periods. This is due to the fact that in severe sea conditions

the amount of energy close to the zero point of the heave RAO (around 22s) is larger than

in mild/calm sea states. Therefore, in these conditions the resulting directional spreading

of the spectrum may be larger.

In addition to the graphical results above, Tab. 5.6 provides the mean values of the

errors obtained not only for beam and quartering wave conditions, but also for the other

wave headings adopted in the tests. Again, the results stand for the estimations obtained

adopting the variable damping model. The values provided in this table are the expected

value of all the estimated mean relative errors computed for significant wave height and

the mean wave period. In order to maintain the table suitable and manageable, the

results were clustered in four different intervals, given by the corresponding theoretical

peak periods of the wave spectra. Also, the absolute error of the estimated direction is

included, in degrees. Finally, the relative errors are presented separately for JONSWAP

and Torsethaugen spectra, to avoid the introduction of a bias in the groups.

Considering the whole range of wave periods tested, Tab. 5.6 attest that the maximum

expected errors involved in the prediction of wave height and period are around 10% for

JONSWAP seas, and 15% for the conditions corresponding to the bimodal Torsethaugen



139

spectra.

Regarding the shape of the wave spectrum, one may realize that the relative errors

(for significant wave height and mean period) are amplified by the Torsethaugen model

for all the wave headings. Again, this is not surprising since, compared to the JONSWAP

model (see figure 3.1), the Torsethaugen spectrum places a larger amount of energy in the

high frequency range, for which the dynamic response of the model is less pronounced.

Furthermore, the whole set of results show that the most unfavorable headings are

those of bow (180?) and beam (90?) waves. Once again, this was expected because these

are the situations when only 2 of the 3 motions used for the estimations are excited by

the waves. On the other hand, the most favorable conditions are those closer to 135? (or

45?), when all the 3 motions are excited and thus the amount of information available for

the estimations is larger. These patterns are shown in Fig. 5.30, which presents the mean

of relative errors for Hs and Tp (shown in previous table) in accordance with the heading

condition. In this figure the data have been categorized in two different sets: blue markers,

which stand for the error related to the sea conditions generated using the JONSWAP

wave spectrum; and red markers, that represent the errors for the Torsethaugen wave

conditions.

When the mean wave direction is concerned (see also, Fig. 5.28 and Fig. 5.29), al-

though the estimated spectra present a somewhat larger spreading of energy if compared

to those obtained from the wave probes, the prediction of the mean direction was very

accurate for all the conditions tested. For instance, in all the conditions assessed during

the experimental campaign it remained smaller than 3deg..

Finally, to conclude the discussion of the main aspects, some additional comments

regarding the prediction of the most several conditions must be made. In fact, it is im-

portant to realize that wave conditions with mean periods above to 12.7s., that correspond

to 100 years return period sea conditions of the A?sgard field, could be captured by the

VMB method with errors equal or lower than 10% in both wave height and period (for



142

estimations obtained using the variable damping). These conditions involved waves with

Hs up to 16 meters and peak periods close to 20 seconds, which represent quite extreme

waves. Obviously, one must remind that these good results were obtained in model-scale,

in very controlled conditions. When considering the estimations made aboard a full-scale

unit, other factors like short crested wave conditions as well as the presence of risers

and mooring lines and the effects of wind and current on the motions, for example, will

certainly impose a more demanding scenario for the predictions.

5.4.4 Wave Inference using the alternative prior distribution

In the following, a detailed comparison between the results obtained with the analysis

presented above and those obtained with the alternative prior distribution (see section

4.4.2) is provided. Again, the set of RAOs adopted in this section was obtained with the

variable damping model, which stands as the most appropriate damping approximation.

In order to provide an effective and proper visual formatting for the comparison of

the results, a different arrangement is adopted: A representation of the distribution of

the ratio between the value of the estimation and the measured value, for all the heading

conditions (five), in terms of box-plots, plus the indication of 5% and 95% estimated

percentile values. The plots in Figs. 5.31 to 5.36 report the following quantities, estimated

using the different heading conditions, for the first realization9 of each sea condition tested:

• The lower and upper limit of each box indicate the 25% and 75% percentile levels,

i.e. the lower and upper quartile respectively;

• The central mark indicates the 50% percentile level, i.e. the median;

• The bars in these plots indicate the the estimated 5% and 95% percentile levels

respectively while the remaining data outside of the limits defined previously are

likely outliers.;

Figures 5.31 to 5.33 show the results obtained by means of the conventional prior

distribution, already discussed in the previous section. In this case, once more, only the

9In this case, since these figures aim at providing a comparison between the conventional and the
alternative prior distribution, only the results regarding the first realization have been included.

Figure 5.33: Box-plot showing the ratio between the estimated and measured mean wave
direction, obtained by means of the conventional approach.

The box-plot representation of the data allows the reader to properly assess and quantify

the variations imposed by the different heading conditions. Finally, it is interesting to

point out that the differences between the estimations for different headings are reduced

for sea conditions with large mean wave periods. This trend, that can be explained by

the fact that in extreme sea conditions large amount of information is provided by the

platform motions, is clearly shown in Figs. 5.31 and 5.32.

Similarly, Figs. 5.34 to 5.36 provide the results obtained using the alternative prior

distribution, described in section 4.4.2. In this case, as it has been pointed out before,

the set of RAOs has also been determined with the variable damping model. In general,

the results obtained show a clear improvement of the estimations regarding the mean

wave period (see Figs. 5.31 and 5.34, respectively), T1. Furthermore, for calm to mild

sea conditions the alternative prior distribution seems to result in a lower loss of energy.

As a matter of fact, Fig. 5.35 shows a significant improvement on the estimation of the

significant wave height for sea conditions characterized with low mean wave periods, if

compared with the results obtained with the conventional prior distribution and presented

in Fig. 5.32.

A clear disadvantage that arises from the use of the alternative prior distribution is

that it tends to overestimate the energy of the wave spectrum (or the significant wave

height) in some cases. Also, the variability of the results for the same sea state obtained

with different headings has been increased, leading to differences up to 18% between the

estimations of Hs. In a similar way the estimations of the mean wave direction present

the same pattern regarding the increment of variability of the estimation in accordance

with the heading of the platform.

Figures 5.37 and 5.38 provide the energy spectrum in frequency-domain for different

sea conditions tested. These figures include the theoretical spectrum (dashed black line),

the measured spectrum (dashed green line) and the estimations obtained with the con-

ventional and the alternative prior distribution, that correspond to the red and blue lines

respectively. In general the results of the alternative prior distribution seems to provide

estimations of the energy spectrum similar to the ones obtained through the alternative

approach.

The influence of the cancellation points of the base of motions adopted to estimate

the sea conditions may become meaningful for some sea conditions with large amounts of

energy in the high frequency range (see for example sea condition 6, 12 and 15 in Fig. 5.37).

Thus, resulting in some discrepancies with the measured wave spectra. For instance, the



147

results of the alternative prior distribution are characterized by the overestimation of

the energy close to periods of 9.2s. Regarding the low frequency range, although in

one sea condition the energy peak is underestimated with the alternative approach (i.e.

sea condition 12 in Fig. 5.37), the energy distribution for the remaining cases has been

properly estimated.

In theory, the alternative prior distribution provides a mechanism that avoids the

estimation of spurious energy in the frequency and direction range close to the cancellation

points. The reliability of this approach has been assessed by the improvement of the

estimations of the directional energy spreading for sea conditions with mean periods above

to 12.7s. A detailed discussion about the estimations of the directional energy spectra is

provided in the following (see Figs. 5.39 and 5.40). However, its effectiveness is limited by

the fact that the heave, roll and pitch RAOs present several cancellation points in the high

frequency range. It should be emphasized that although the alternative prior distribution

aims at taking into account the uncertainties close to the zero points of the RAOs, large

discrepancies between the measurements and the expected values of the motions may lead

to the misleading estimation of the energy spectrum in certain frequency ranges linked to

several cancellation points (from heave, roll and pitch).

Table 5.7 shows the mean value of the ratios presented in figures from 5.31 to 5.36. In

this case the values are sorted according to the measured wave period of the first realization

of the sea conditions. First, by inspecting the error statistics, it can be concluded that

good agreement with the expected values is obtained in both cases. Nonetheless, as it

has been pointed out before, the alternative prior distribution provides an improvement

in the estimations obtained for the mean wave period. Regarding the estimations of

the significant wave height and the mean wave direction, it can be stated that even

though analogous results have been obtained in both cases, it is expected to obtain more

accurate estimations with the alternative prior distribution for sea conditions with mean

wave periods up to 11s.

Figures 5.39 and 5.40 show a comparison between the measured directional sea spec-

trum and the estimations, obtained by means of the two different approaches, the con-

ventional approach and the Bayesian inference based on the alternative prior distribution.

The examples selected comprise one moderate sea condition, one mild sea condition and

same approach leads to a non-smooth spectrum pattern for those quartering sea condi-

tions with small wave periods (for instance, see Fig. 5.39). This can be linked to the fact

that the alternative prior distribution no longer imposes the smoothness conditions as

a necessary requirement of the solution, something that also leads to minor misleading

estimation of the energy distribution in the direction. In any case, this drawback does

not affect the energy distribution in the frequency-domain (see Figs. 5.37 and 5.38). Once

again, it is important to remember that the long crested waves stand as a limiting condi-



151

tion for the conventional approach, since it assumes an smooth distribution in the energy

domain. Therefore, one may realize the relevance of the assessment regarding the perfor-

mance of the methodologies adopted in this work by means of sea conditions generated

(or measured) with a certain degree of spreading, something that has been left for future

work.

By inspecting these figures it can be concluded that the alternative approach, in

general, provides solutions with narrow spread of the energy in the direction. However,

the use of the smoothness only as a weak condition, in the alternative prior distribution,

may generate non-smooth solutions quartering seas. Another trend that can be identified

is that spreading of the solutions obtained by means of both approaches are larger for

extreme sea states than mild/calm sea states. This is due to the influence of the zero point

that the heave RAO presents close to 22s. It is worth to remember that the alternative

approach provides estimations characterized by a smaller spreading than the ones obtained

through the conventional approach.

To sum up, it can be concluded that the alternative prior distribution brings some

improvements if compared with the conventional approach. For instance, the alternative

approach seems to provide more accurate estimations of sea conditions characterized by

low mean wave periods. Similarly, the spreading of the energy in direction is narrower

when the sea state is estimated by means of the alternative approach than if it is inferred

using the conventional prior distribution. Nonetheless, the variance of the results, with

regards to the different heading conditions, is increased when they are estimated though

the alternative prior distribution.

Finally, another advantage obtained with the alternative prior distribution is the re-

duction of the computing time. As it has been pointed before, the computations were

carried out with a desktop personal computer using MATLABr2014a. In average, the

software took 28s. to estimate one sea condition using the conventional approach, without

taking into account the time spent during pre-calibration procedure of the hyperparam-

eters. This mean time is reduced to only 6.7s when the alternative prior distribution is

adopted. This may be relevant for future applications of the method, such as its use to

obtain a preliminary estimation of the sea state or even when large data sets are analyzed.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This thesis has primarily assessed the usefulness of employing a semisubmersible plat-

form for VMB estimations of local sea spectra. The analysis performed was based on the

results obtained through an extensive model-scale experimental campaign carried out at

the USP’s wave basin (TPN-USP), using a (1 : 120) scale model.

In accordance with the objectives of this thesis, the following tasks have been fulfilled

and subsequent conclusions drawn:

1. A systematical analysis of the dynamics of the semisubmersible platform has been

carried out, including a detailed assessment regarding the main hypothesis adopted

to model the sea wave conditions as well as to linearize the platform wave responses.

Moreover, the VMB Bayesian wave inference with three hyperparameters, as pro-

posed in (SIMOS et al., 2012), has been adopted in order to evaluate the reliability

of the platform as a VMB wave sensor.

• The dynamics of the motions of the platform has been analyzed numerically

in time-domain and in frequency-domain, showing that the platform presents

good (linear) response characteristics for being used as a wave sensor, partic-

ularly for periods below 20s.

• Since the sea conditions tested at the wave basin range from calm/mild con-

ditions to 100yr-return events, they allowed a comprehensive assessment of

the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor in calm and extreme sea

states.

• The analysis carried out by means of the coherence functions has shown that

the heave-roll-pitch basis is the most appropriate for inferring the sea states

using the semisubmersible platform.



155

• Results obtained adopting this approach revealed that all the wave conditions

tested could be accurately inferred from the Bayesian method, keeping the

errors within reasonable limits. On the one hand, the errors were larger in the

most unfavorable conditions, which correspond to the ones with small motions

(small periods or mild seas) and in the cases when the sea only excited two

of the three motions (bow and beam waves). Thus, the wave height and the

mean wave period were estimated with errors always below 18% and 15% for

the most unfavorable heading conditions, respectively. Regarding the mean

wave direction the results shown that it can be estimated with an error lower

than 3deg.

• The errors are reduced in the cases were the platform presents larger motions, or

the existing ones provide more information, which are given when the heading

is close to 135? and for the more severe wave conditions (when the wave induce

more pronounced motions). The errors for the most favorable conditions are

0.05%, 1.3% and 0.6deg., for the estimations concerning the significant wave

height, mean wave period and mean direction, respectively. All the results

confirmed the expected biases of overestimating the wave period while under-

estimating the wave height, deviations that are progressively smaller as the

wave period increases and leading to better estimation regarding the extreme

sea conditions.

2. A detailed discussion regarding the prior distribution introduced by different authors

has been provided. The main differences between them and how they are related

to each other have been also addressed in the analysis provided. The conclusions

drawn are:

• The Bayesian learning methodology adopted, see (TANNURI et al., 2003), to

assess the reliability of using the measured motions of the platform to esti-

mate sea conditions, has provided results that show good agreement with the

measurements obtained by means of conventional waves probes. However, the

semisubmersible platform was tested under carefully controlled experimental

conditions, reducing the uncertainties of the linear model. In fact, other works

developed using the same inference technique, based on the measured motions



156

of a FPSO, e.g. (BISPO, 2011a), have pointed out misleading estimations

under certain sea conditions.

• In principle, the inference results can be improved by means of simple modi-

fications of the prior distributions adopted. In fact, an alternative prior dis-

tribution has been developed, aiming to account for the possible drawbacks of

the current approach.

• The comparison between the outputs obtained with the conventional approach

(TANNURI et al., 2003) and the ones resulting from the inference method

based on the alternative prior distribution has shown that the adoption of

the later may lead to significant improvements. In fact, the error associated

with the estimation of the mean wave period has been reduced in general by

a factor equal to 5%. Similarly, the estimation of the wave height revealed an

improvement of the order of 3% regarding the mean error of the estimations,

although it presents an increment of the error variability concerning different

headings.

• An aspect of the alternative prior distribution that needs to be reviewed is that

for certain heading conditions (120?, 135? and 150?), the estimations result in

non-smooth patterns of the sea spectra. Concerning the relative errors of the

estimations of the statistical parameters of the sea, it can be stated that they

remained almost unchanged. The resulting unsmoothed pattern of the sea

spectrum for these headings may be related to the fact that the smoothness

conditions, adopted in the alternative prior distribution, act only as a weak

restriction.

3. An assessment regarding the non-linearities close to the heave resonance has been

carried out by means of numerical analysis in frequency-domain and time-domain.

• Non-linear heave responses were identified close the resonance frequency, that

is within the frequency range of interest. Regarding the roll and pitch motions,

their resonances are equal to 74s and 88s. Therefore, for the purposes of this

work the platform is expected to respond linearly in roll and pitch.

• It is already known that the main source of non-linearities close to the reso-

nances arise from drag effects. As a matter of fact, the viscous damping of the



157

heave motions is mainly governed by separation effects of the pontoons.

• In order to properly model the responses of the heave motion, a simple linear

damping model has been proposed to take account of the non-liner resonant

responses, which indeed showed a good agreement with the decay tests carried

out in still water.

4. The results for more severe sea states are promising, even when the RAOs are

modelled in a conventional linear analysis in frequency-domain. Furthermore, the

adoption of the alternative prior distribution seems to provide promising improve-

ments of the estimations of the sea conditions. Also, this prior distribution does

not need previous calibration of the hyperparameters (avoiding the use of numeri-

cal simulations or a dedicated experimental campaign). This property, along with

the fact that the computational time is reduced, leads to a less time-consuming

methodology.

• It may perhaps be observed that the results with the RAOs obtained from

different approaches also highlighted the importance of a proper modelling of

the transfer functions of motion.

• In the experimental setup, a soft mooring system was used and the major source

of drag was the platform itself. In this condition, the results obtained when

using the variable external damping method (a damping ratio proportional to

the recorded heave amplitude in each test) proved to be a good option for

dealing with effects of the non-linear viscous damping.

• Other possible effects due to the environmental conditions, such as wind and

currents, or the submerged lines, must be properly assessed by means of a

dedicated experimental campaign.

• Another characteristic that may have a relevant influence on the accuracy of

the estimations is the spreading of the sea. During experimental campaign

only long crested sea conditions were tested, which provides a preliminary

assessment of the reliability of the semisubmersible as a VMB wave inference

sensor. Long crested seas, however, stand as a limiting case for the conventional

approach and the use of sea states with spreading in direction may result in

the improvement of the estimations.



158

• The results obtained also attest that the semisubmersible platforms, although it

is characterized by small motion amplitudes, it responds linearly in a wide range

of sea conditions. Furthermore, it is known that in the operating condition

these platforms does not present variations of their metacentric height and

draft, which facilitates the estimations of the most appropriate set of RAOs

used to infer the sea conditions.

As a general conclusion, one may state that the results obtained with the small-scale

tests indicate that semisubmersible platform indeed may be considered as a good choice for

the VMB wave inference. Finally, since the semisubmersible platform can provide reliable

account of the sea conditions that imposed the measurement motions, in wide range of

frequencies, they can be adopted to complement the wave buoys network installed along

the Brazilian coast. Figure 6.1 presents the resulting wave monitoring network if Fig. 1.5

is updated including only the semisubmersible platforms operated by Petrobras (in dark

blue), illustrating the improvement of the monitoring network.

6.1 Major findings

This thesis aims at researching the VMB wave inference method using the motions of

a semisubmersible platform. The major contributions obtained during the development

of this work can be summarized as follows:

• When estimating the wave conditions based on the measured motions of a small-

scale model of a semisubmersible platform, the results obtained show that semisub-

mersible platforms may be considered as a good choice for the VMB wave inference.

In fact, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the platform (high natural periods)

increase the reliability of the model adopted. Therefore, for large semisubmersible

platforms, the interval of estimation may be more restricted in the high frequency

range. Generally, the accuracy of the estimations is improved as the wave period

increases, which is a benefit to the semisubmersible as a VMB wave sensor consid-

ering the more severe wave scenarios expected where these platforms are usually

developed.

• Non-linear effects should be included in the excitation-response model of the plat-

form to increase the accuracy of the estimations, especially in sea conditions charac-

terized by large peaks periods that have energy close to the heave resonance. From

the Morison quadratic drag equation a linear damping estimation has been proposed.

This methodology aims to provide a simple approach to estimate the non-linear drag

effects acting on the heave motion of a semisubmersible platform. The estimations

obtained through this model show good agreement with the experimental data from

the heave decay tests.

• The Bayesian VMB wave inference method as adopted by Tannuri et al. (2003) pro-

vided good estimations when compared with the experimental measurements carried

out at the wave basin by means of wave probes. However, this inference model must

be pre-calibrated, procedure that may involve numerical simulations as well as ex-

perimental measurements. Furthermore, in some specific conditions previous works

have identified some limitations. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, an alter-

native prior distribution is provided in this thesis. The results obtained through

this prior distribution are in agreement with the experimental measurements and in



160

some frequency ranges outperform the estimations obtained by means of the con-

ventional approach. Another important advantage obtained with this alternative

approach is the reduction of the computing time to estimate the sea conditions.

Summing up, the main contributions of this thesis are the assessment of the use of

a large semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave sensor and the development of an

alternative prior distribution. It is shown that the prior knowledge of the variance of

each element of the unknown spectrum can be estimated through the measured mo-

tions. An extensive analysis of analytical, numerical and small-scale experimental

data has been carried out. Finally, this thesis also provides a systematic discussion

regarding the characteristics of the sea states generated at the wave basin (Gaus-

sianity, Stationarity and the optimal run length) as well as the boundary conditions

adopted in the Bayesian approach to estimate the sea states.

6.2 Future work

Naturally, a substantial amount of possible future work threads arise from the topics

discussed in this thesis. From these, the following tasks are considered the more relevant

to properly addressing during future stages of this research:

• The relevance of a more refined experimental analysis of the effects the moorings

and risers may have on the motions of the unit is envisaged, and the same is true

regarding the action of wind and current. Furthermore, the use of the full-scale

data to make wave inference will be useful to understand the real effects that the

moorings lines and risers may have on the motions of the semisubmersible platform.

• Regarding the use of full-scale data, it may also be useful to fully assess the reliability

of the semisubmersible platform as a VMB wave inference wave sensor. The results

obtained through the experimental campaign carried out in the wave basin attested

that the method was capable of capturing very well all the wave conditions tested.

However, full-scale data may bring challenges that are different to the ones that

were overcome in this thesis.

Following the procedure adopted in (BISPO, 2011b) to validate the use of a FPSO

as VMB wave sensor, it can be advised to adopt a minimum time span equal to



161

24 months of full-scale data. This approach would allow to take into consideration

the seasonal variability of the sea conditions (including Hs, Tp and ?) when the

assessment of the use of a semisubmersible platform is carried out.

• The A?sgard-B semisubmersible platform is characterized by large resonant periods

for the roll and pitch motions. However, this is not the general standard for the all

semisubmersible platform, which usually present lower natural periods for pitch and

roll motions (slightly above to 30s). Since one the objectives is the expansion of the

wave buoys monitoring network in the Brazilian coast, it is important to carry out

some tests with geometries for the semisubmersible platform operated by Petrobras,

such as P-18, P-20, P-51 and P-52.

• Regarding the alternative prior distribution, there are still some problems with the

smoothness of the outputs. In fact, for bow sea conditions the estimated directional

wave spectrum in some cases is characterized by a noisy pattern. The adoption

of smoothing functions, based on the estimated energy distribution, may provide a

suitable solution for this shortcoming.

• It has been shown that the uncertainty introduced by the cancellation points of the

RAOs may generate misleading estimations of the sea conditions. The alternative

prior distribution proposed in this work provides a proper mechanism to avoid spu-

rious energy estimations near the cancellation points. However, it would be useful

to properly study if the linear approach adopted to estimate the prior distribution

(see Eq. 4.40) is the one that leads the best estimations.

• The boundary conditions adopted to compute the prior distribution have been dis-

cussed in appendix E. Moreover, it was shown that some of these conditions can

be modified to mitigate some drawbacks identified by other authors when a FPSO

is adopted as a VMB wave sensor (see Bispo et al. (2016)), such as the tendency

of the method of locating spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel

in beam sea conditions. Due to the fact that the estimations obtained during this

research do not show the limitations identified by Bispo et al. (2016), an assessment

regarding the possible improvements provided by the changes proposed for the prior

distribution has been left as a future work.



162

• This thesis is based on an extensive analysis of the results obtained using two differ-

ent approaches for the Bayesian inference. In both cases good agreement with the

measurements is obtained, showing that a semisubmersible platform can be used

as a proper VMB wave sensor. However, it would be interesting to determine the

statistical significance of these results, or in other words, what are the chances of

obtaining the same results if a similar model-scale experimental campaign is car-

ried out again? The most common approach adopted to answer this question is

to generate large amounts of data through an experimental campaign. However,

this approach is likely to result in an expensive research campaign and in some

cases the results drawn may be inconclusive. In fact, large amounts of data tend

to normalize biases, specially when they do not properly represent the majority of

the population of interest (in this case the semisubmersible platforms). For these

reasons, it is proposed as a future work the evaluation of the statistical significance

of the results by means of alternative statistical techniques, such as the Bayesian

factors. By adopting this approach, the main challenge to be faced would be to

properly estimate the marginal distribution of measuring the data obtained from

the measured motions of the platform, P(B).

• Finally, another line of future work is the use of semisubmersible wind turbine

platforms as a base for the VMB wave inference. As a matter of fact, these platforms

stand a popular technology as an offshore wind turbine foundation and they usually

are carefully monitored. Although the dynamics of these platforms is similar to

the one presented by conventional O&amp;amp;G conventional semisubmersible platforms, a

dedicated experimental campaign is needed to properly assess the effects that the

aerodynamic wind forces may have on the platform motions.

APPENDIX A – SINUSOIDAL WAVE AS

A RANDOM PROCESS

For a given amplitude, frequency and wave number, the randomness of a sinusoidal

wave can be introduced by defining the phase shift, ?, with respect to a given frequency as

a random variable taking values in the range [0, 2?). When modeling ocean wave trains,

it is commonly assumed that ? has a constant density thus implying that all phase shift

values have the same probability of occurrence (LONGUET-HIGGINS, 1957).

Accordingly, the probability distribution of the phase shift (see Eq. (3.13)) can be

written as,

P(? &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? + d?) = pdf(?)d? =
1

2?
d?, (A.1)

obtaining that,

? +?
??

pdf(?)d? =

? +?
??

1

2?
d? = 1 . (A.2)

Same instantaneous value of the sinusoidal wave can be obtained using two different

phases. In other words, for a same time instant two different phase shifts can provide

the same instantaneous value. From this property, the probability density function of the

wave elevation is given by,

pdf(?)d? = P(? = ?) = P(? = ?1) + P(? = ?2) = 2pdf(?)d? =
d?

?
. (A.3)

This is an important relation that allows the following variable change (considering

the fact that the probability density function should be always positive),



172

pdf(?) = pdf(?)

????d?d?
???? = 1?

????d?d?
???? , (A.4)

Thus, d? should be determined in order to estimate the probability density function

of the amplitude of the wave. Thus simplifying Eq. (3.13) for an unidirectional wave and

differentiating,

d? = ?A sin(kx?? t + ?)d?, (A.5)

relation that should be replaced in Eq. (A.6), leading to the expression of the probability

density function of the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave,

pdf(?) =
1

? (A2 ??2)
1
2

. (A.6)

Now, by means of the expression provided in Eq. (A.6), the statistical characteristics

of the process can be computed as follows. In the first place, the mean value is given by,

E[?(x,t)] =

? +?
??

? pdf(?)d? =

? +?
??

?

? (A2 ??2)
1
2

d? = 0 . (A.7)

This result shows that the process is independent of the time and space (GODA,

2000). Secondly, the mean square can be computed as,

E[?2(x,t)] =

? +?
??

?2 pdf(?)d? =

? +?
??

?2

? (A2 ??2)

2

d? =

2
. (A.8)

relation that shows that the mean square does not depend of the space and time. In

the third place, the autocorrelation function is defined by the expression provided in

Eq. (A.9). For this purpose, assume that the random process under study produces

two random variables ?(x1, t1) and ?(x2, t2) at times an positions (x1, t1) and (x2, t2),

respectively (A?STRO?M, 2012).



173

R?? := R??(x1, t1; x2, t2) = E[?(x1, t1)?(x2, t2)] =

? +?
??

?1?2pdf?(x1,t1)?(x2,t2)(?1,?2)d?1d?2 ,

(A.9)

The resulting relation, after some algebra, can be rewritten as,

R?? = E

[
A2

2
(cos(k(x1 + x2) ??(t1 + t2) + 2?) + cos(k(x1 ?x2) ??(t1 ? t2)))

]
,

(A.10)

and using the following definitions ?? = x1?x2, ? = t1?t2, x3 = x1 +x2 and t3 = t1 +t2,

the autocorrelation function will be,

R?? =
A2

2
E [(cos(kx3 ?? t3 + 2?) + a cos(k?????))] . (A.11)

Another important property of the sinusoidal wave is that the mean value over one

complete cycle is zero. This feature allows the simplification of the previous equation,

being reduced to,

R?? =
A2

2
cos(k?????) . (A.12)

Equation A.12 shows that autocorrelation function is independent of the time and

space and, as a consequence, it only depends on the relative values of the time and position

with respect to a certain reference. Also, it has been shown that the sinusoidal wave is

a stationary process regarding its mean value, the mean square and the autocorrelation

function. Therefore, the process can be assumed ergodic.

Finally, another example is provided for illustration purposes. Let be ?(x,t) a random

process that is given as the sum of two independent sinusoidal waves,

?1(x,t) = A1 cos(k1x??1 t + ?1) ,

?2(x,t) = A2 cos(k2x??2 t + ?2) ,
(A.13)

Thus,



174

?(x,t) = A1 cos(k1x??1 t + ?1) + A2 cos(k2x??2 t + ?2) , (A.14)

Leading to the mean value,

E[?(x,t)] = E[?1(x,t) + ?2(x,t)] = E[?1(x,t)] + E[?2(x,t)] = 0 + 0 = 0 . (A.15)

Accordingly, the mean square is computed as follows,

E[?2(x,t)] = E[(?1(x,t) + ?2(x,t))
2
] =

E[?21 (x,t)] + E[?
2
2 (x,t)] + 2E[?1(x,t)?2(x,t)] ,

(A.16)

If both process are independent, the resulting covariance must be zero (E[?1(x,t)?2(x,t)] =

0), also, as it has been shown before, the mean value of the process over one period is

equal to zero. As a consequence, the Eq. (A.16) is reduced to,

E[?2(x,t)] =
A21
2

+
A22
2
. (A.17)

Accordingly, the autocorrelation function can be reduced to the following expression,

R?? = R??(x1, t1; x2, t2) = E[?(x1, t1)?(x2, t2)] =

R11 + R22 + R12 = R11 + R22 ,
(A.18)

Finally, this process presents the same characteristics regarding the mean value, the

mean square and the autocorrelation function as the sinusoidal wave, i.e. the process

is stationary and homogeneous and it can be assumed ergodic. In this context ergodic

means that the number of the cosine waves included in the analysis is sufficiently large.

The foregoing results present a basic illustration of the main fundamentals that allow

the characterization of the sea surface elevation using the statistical approach. Further-

more, an interesting result of this approach arises when infinite waves components are

included, thus the well-known Longuet-Higgins model (see eq. (3.13)) is obtained.



175

APPENDIX B – STATISTICAL

DESCRIPTION OF

WAVES

A brief discussion regarding key concepts of the probabilistic description of the sea is

included herein. Therefore, conditions concerning the Gaussianity, Ergodicity, Stationar-

ity and optimal sample time of the process are reviewed.

B.1 Gaussianity

In the Longuet-Higgins random sea model, the sea surface profile is obtained as a

result of the sum of infinity sinusoidal wave components (LONGUET-HIGGINS, 1957).

Examination of the resulting amplitudes of this model reveals that this process can be

assumed stationary Gaussian, as a direct consequence of the central limit theorem. On

the other hand, it is common to assume the narrow banded spectrum hypothesis, in order

to assure that there is a very small probability that the maxima of the irregular wave

profile are located elsewhere than at the wave crests. Accordingly, the amplitude of the

wave components gives the amplitude of the wave envelope. Nonetheless, Longuet-Higgins

(1957) shows that for a Gaussian process, the envelope of an irregular wave profile can

always be defined, even if the spectrum is not narrow.

Another remark should be done regarding narrow banded processes, as it is the result-

ing sea of the Longuet-Higgins random sea model. This kind of processes has an important

relationship with the Rayleigh distribution, which describes the probability distribution

of the the envelope of the random data series. The Rayleigh probability distribution can

be derived from the Gaussian distribution, as it shown in (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010). A

direct consequence of the use of the Rayleigh distribution to describe the envelope of the



176

irregular wave profile is that important information about the statistical characteristics of

the sea spectrum can be derived from this distribution, as it has been shown in chapter 3.

Concerning the effectiveness of the Gaussianity assumption, chapter 4 provides a

detailed review about the Gaussian characteristics of the wave elevation and the im-

plications on the Bayesian inference approach. This analysis shows that it is expected

that the Guassianity assumption will be no longer valid for processes that are highly

non-stationary or/and when the non-linear terms of the hydrodynamic equations become

significant. Furthermore, when irregular sea conditions are generated artificially by means

of numerical simulations or in controlled conditions, such as wave basins, the relation be-

tween different sinusoidal wave components of the Longet-Higgins model may lead to a

non-gaussian process, see (TUCKER; CHALLENOR; CARTER, 1984). However, the

Gaussianity assumption leads to very attractive simplifications from a practical point of

view, and, as a consequence, the Gaussianity hypothesis is commonly adopted even for

non-linear processes.

In order to illustrate these points Fig. B.1 and Fig. B.2 provide the empirical distri-

bution of the surface elevation for two different sea conditions tested in the wave basin (a

detailed description of all conditions tested during the experimental campaign is provided

in chapter 5). The sea conditions selected for this analysis correspond to: The first sea

condition, with Tp = 9.5s and Hs = 3.5m (mild sea state), and the most extreme sea

condition, with Tp = 19.5s and Hs = 16.4m (once in 100 years). Both sea conditions were

obtained using a JONSWAP spectrum. Sea states generated by means of a Torsethaugen

spectrum are assumed not proper for this analysis because their spectrum band is larger

than the equivalent JONSWAP spectrum and, as a consequence, the expected deviation

from the Gaussian distribution could be larger. The test conditions analyzed here indicate

some discrepancies of the surface elevation from the normal distribution. Also, in order to

provide some statistical framework, various parametric distributions have been adjusted

to the empirical data and included in these figures, i.e.: Normal (gaussian), GEV (Gen-

eralized Extreme Values), Logistic and Tlocationscale distributions, that are extensively

documented in the literature.

The probability distributions shown in Fig. B.1 and Fig. B.2 provide a general idea

regarding the main differences between the empirical distribution and the adjusted normal

distribution. However, a quantitative analysis is needed in order to evaluate the validity of

the Gaussianity assumption regarding the sea conditions generated in the wave basin. For



178

this purpose (BULMER, 2012) suggests the evaluation of the skewness, which provides a

measurement of the asymmetry of the measured probability distribution.

Concerning the normal distribution, it is characterized by having an skewness equal

to zero, which implies that the data is perfectly symmetric, but this value of the skewness

is highly unusual for empirical data. Therefore, the classification proposed in (BULMER,

2012) will be adopted to determine if a the distribution can be assumed symmetric and

consequently Gaussian. The criterion adopted sates that:

• If the skewness is less than ?1 or greater than +1, the distribution is assumed as

highly skewed;

• If the value of the skewness is between ?1 and ?0.5 or between +0.5 and +1, the

estimated distribution will be assumed moderately skewed;

• If the skewness is between ?0.5 and +0.5, the measured distribution can be assumed

approximately symmetric.

The values of the estimated skewness of the measured wave elevation for all the sea

conditions tested in the wave basin are provided in Tab. B.1. These results show that all

the sea conditions tested in the wave basin present skewness values between 0.2 and 0.49.

Therefore, the distributions can be assumed approximately symmetric and, consequently,

the Gaussianity assumption will be adopted for all the sea conditions tested. Also, it

is interesting to remark that the positive value of the skewness, obtained for all the sea

conditions, suggests that the wave crest heights are larger than the wave trough depths.

B.2 Ergodicity

An ensemble of wave profiles is assumed an ergodic process if a particular sample

has the property that its time averaged statistics are equal to those of the ensemble

average. Therefore, the assumption of ergodicity allows a theoretically correct substitution

of ensemble averaging by temporal average (BENDAT; PIERSOL, 2010). It is important

to highlight that the hypothesis of ergodicity derives from the linear sea wave theory, as

well as the Gaussian hypothesis (see appendix A).

Consequently, if the sea surface elevation is an ergodic process, then all the joint pdfs

can be estimated from one single realization of the process having infinite time length.

So, a process is said to be ergodic if the statistics of a particular sample ?i(t) are equal

to those of the ensemble average,

It is seen from Eqs. (B.1) and (B.2) that an ergodic process must necessarily be

stationary. If these equations hold for a Gaussian process, then all the joint distributions

can be obtained and the process will be fully determined. Finally, a stochastic process that

possesses ergodicity is always a stationary process. However, the stationarity conditions

does not imply ergodicity of the process.

B.3 Stationarity

Above, the Gaussian and ergodic conditions of random sea waves have been reviewed.

This section aims at explaining the stationarity condition, which refers to the character-

istic of a stochastic process in which all the statistic properties are time-invariant. For

example, if the stationary condition is applied to a certain register of wave elevation, then

the arithmetic mean and the autocorrelation function have the following properties:

E[?(t)] = µ? = E[?(0)] , with ?? &amp;lt;t &amp;lt;? , (B.3)

E[?(t + ? t)?(t)] = R?? = E[?(?)?(0)] , with ?? &amp;lt;t &amp;lt;? . (B.4)

B.4 Optimal sample time

In theory, the fulfillment of three conditions described above would be sufficient to

select the test duration in which a minimum number of relevant events is obtained. How-

ever, from a practical point of view this is usually an unrealistic objective, because the

wave elevation, even in a controlled experimental campaign at a wave basin, is in general

non-stationary. Also, a minimal number of cycles (or waves) is needed (ITTC, 2014) to

obtain a statistical significance of the characteristics of the wave spectrum. The use of

the well-known Fast Fourier Transform procedure implies that the maximum time dura-

tion is given by Tmax =
1

? f
, where ? f is the frequency separation of the harmonics (see

(CAMAS, 2016)). This is due to the fact that wave record repeats itself after this time.



181

Another advantage that derives from the adoption of the Fast Fourier Transform is

that it allows the estimation of the standard error, ?2m, that a spectrum presents over the

frequency interval of interest (given by N harmonics in the frequency range [fm,fm+N?1]),

in accordance with the sample time duration of the signal.

In order to deduce the value of the standard error, the random nature of the amplitude

of each harmonic of a power spectrum (that has been introduced in section 3.2) should

be considered. In the analysis of a single record, the measured value of the power of a

given harmonic component is given by s??i, and as a result of its randomness its value

may differ from one to another independent record of the same signal. Nonetheless, it is

possible to adopt the average of the amplitude of a given harmonic, S??i, over many inde-

pendent records of the same signal as the truly characteristic amplitude of the harmonic

(TUCKER, 1957).

For the jth realization, the average of the spectrum from the mth to the (m + N?1)th

harmonic is (s??m + ... + s??m+N?1 )/N and the error is the amount that differs from the

average of the averaged values of the spectrum over many records (S??m +...+S??m+N?1 )/N.

Now, the square of the error can be defined as,

[
(S??m ?s??m) + ... + (S??m+N?1 + s??m+N?1 )

]
N2

=[?m+N?1
i=m (S??i ?s??i) +

?
n 6= l(S??n ?s??n)(S??l ?s??l)

]
N2

,

(B.5)

By definitions the value computed as the average value of Eq. (B.5) over many analyses

is the square of the standard error, ?. Tucker (1957) shows that the values of (S??n?s??n)

and (S??l ?s??l) are unrelated and that their product averaged over many analyses tends

to zero. Thus, the standard error can be defied as,

?2 =

?m+N?1
i=m (S??i ?s??i)

N2
=

?m+N?1
i=m ?

2
i

N2
. (B.6)

Assuming that all the values of the spectrum are equal over the frequency range of

interest all the values of ?2i and ?
2 =

?2i

N
. Now, from the relation between the variance



182

and the expected value of the spectrum in each frequency, obtained in section 3.2, the

standard error can be rewritten as,

?2 =
S2??i

N
. (B.7)

Thus, the proportional standard error
?2

S??i
=

1
?
N

. As an illustration of the impor-

tance of this relation, consider the analysis of a recorded signal characterized by bandwidth

equivalent to 0.5Hz. If a 2.5% standard error is required, then the signal recorded must

have at least 1600 cycles, that is, the record must be 3200s.

This shows that the procedure provides an optimal solution regarding the time du-

ration of the recorded signal if the true power spectrum is uniform and narrowband.

However, for different sea conditions it may present some problems. For example, con-

sider the spectra provided in Fig. B.3. In this figure the Torsethaugen spectrum is named

as TH and Measured provides the full-scale measured sea spectrum. In this case, if the

relations presented above are followed, the total time for the recorded signal will be the

same for both spectra: Torsethaugen and the measured. However, from the same figure,

it can be observed that the expected mean wave period is different for these spectra.

Thus, if the same recording time is considered, the expected number of cycles (or waves)

for these sea conditions will be (sufficiently) different and, consequently, the statistical

estimators will have distinct significance. Accordingly, a different procedure to determine

the time length of the signal is needed to obtain recordings that have the same statistical

significance.

The main idea followed in this work, to determine the time duration of the register,

is to estimate the variance of a temporal statistical estimator, such as the temporal mean

or the temporal mean square of the wave elevation, and set the estimated variance of

the estimator less than or equal of a certain value, for all the sea conditions. Therefore,

the total recorded time for the tested sea conditions will be different in each case. In

order to guarantee a minimum number of cycles, a minimum time span of 30 minutes is

considered, that is typically assumed as the length of the stationary period (SOARES;

FRICKE, 2011). Then, the variance of the estimator is obtained every minute until a

certain sample time is reached, where the computed variance of the estimator is less than

or equal to a prescribed value.

The deduction regarding the estimation of the variance of the running statistical

estimators presented below is already reported in (NAITO; KIHARA, 1993) in a similar

way. The running mean and running mean square of a process, ?, are given by:

??? =

? t

?(?)d? , (B.8)

??2? =

t

? t

?2(?)d? . (B.9)

If the process under analysis, ?, is supposed weakly stationary, it has the following

properties:

E[?] =

? pdf(?)d? = µ? , (B.10)



184

E[?2] =

? +?
??

?2 pdf(?)d? = µ2? + ?
2
? , (B.11)

E[?(t)?(t + ? t)] = R??(?) . (B.12)

From Eqs. (B.8) and (B.9), the expected values of the running mean and the running

mean square are:

E[???] =
1

t

? t

E[?(?)]d? = µ? , (B.13)

E[??2?] =

? t

E[?2(?)]d? = µ? + ?
2
? . (B.14)

Therefore, the unbiased estimators, for the expected values of ? and ?2, are given by

the running mean and the running mean square. However, the main interest in this case

is the degree of variation of these estimators over the time. Thus,

Var(???) = E[???2] ?E2[???] =

Eqs. (B.15) and (B.16) provide general expression for any stationary process. In the

case of zero-mean Gaussian process (see Ochi (1990)), the expressions simplify to:



185

Var(???) =

Consequently, the time length of the signal will be determined when the variance

selected as indicator from Eqs. (B.17) or (B.18), reaches a certain minimum value. This

procedure is expected to provide different time lengths of the recorded signal for the sea

conditions tested, providing larger sampling times for test conditions that correspond to

extreme sea states in the scatter diagram.

The procedure proposed above provides a proper methodology to determine the time

duration of the recorded signal for sea conditions where the sea elevation is known, such

as tests conducted in a wave basin. However, in full-scale applications only the measured

motions of a ship or platform are available. The problem is therefore: Is this procedure

appropriate when it is applied to the ship motions?

Let ?(t) be a realization of a certain sea condition in a time interval [0,T]. In order to

properly represent the motions induced in a floating vessel by this sea condition, let be ` a

sufficiently smooth function of the value ? of the sea condition under study. On the other

hand, ships and platforms usually behave themselves as a low-pass filters. Therefore, the

realization of the new process (which represents a certain response of the ship, such as

the heave motion) can be obtained as:

zi(t) =
1

? t

? t+? t
t

`(?(?))d? , (B.19)

where t &amp;lt;T and ? t is assumed sufficient to filter the high frequency component of the

resulting process.

The expected value is estimated with Eq. (B.20), which is the result of making use

of the definition of the expected value and the linearity of the operators involved in the

calculation.

Consequently, the variance is given by:

Var(z(t)) = E[z2(t)] ?E2[z(t)] = Rzz(t) ?E[z2(t)] . (B.25)

It must be noted that, in general, even if the wave elevation is stationary, the induced

motion does not have stationarity with respect to the autocorrelation function, but it is

stationary with respect to the expected value. Moreover, the autocorrelation function,

R??(?), is equivalent to the power spectral density function, S??(?, k), by virtue of the the

Wiener-Kinchine theorem. Therefore, the resulting statistical properties of the motions

spectra are not stationary.

From a practical point of view, however, in some cases the measured motions may



187

provide a good input of the procedure proposed to select the optimal sample time. In

fact, it is expected that the uncertainty introduced by the non-stationarity of the motions

will be minimum in systems moored with a fixed heading relative to the seabed, because

the induced non-stationarity is reduced to the RAOs variation in frequency-domain and

the sea mean direction, limiting the possible wind and current effects on the heading of

the platform and, as consequence, on the non-stationarity of the motions. As a prelimi-

nary evaluation of this procedure, the estimated sampling time will be obtained through

the measured heave motion of the semisubmersible platform employed during the exper-

imental campaign. However, due to the limitations of the tests carried out in the wave

basin, full-scale applications of this method should be discussed more thoroughly with

the analysis of real data of the measured motions.

APPENDIX C – STANDARD MODELS

FOR WAVE SPECTRUM

A detailed description of the wave spectrum models adopted in this work is provided

in (BISHOP; PRICE, 1979) and (TORSETHAUGEN; HAVER, 2004). In the following

the main formulae of the JONSWAP wave spectrum and the Torsethaugen wave spectrum

are addressed.

JONSWAP wave spectrum

The JONSWAP wave spectrum was derived from the analysis of the data collected

during the Joint North Sea Wave Observation Project (JONSWAP) and it can be con-

sidered an improvement of the PM wave spectrum. The expression for this type of wave

spectrum is defined by,

S??(f) = 0.3125 H
2
s T

2
p f
?5 exp

{
?1.25 T?4p f

?4} (1 ? 0.287 ln ?) ?(exp{?0.5(Tpf?1? )2}) ,
(C.1)

where the parameter, ?, is a measure of the width of the spectral peak and can be written

as,

???
??
? = 0.07, for Tp f &amp;lt;1

? = 0.09, for Tp f ? 1 ,
(C.2)

and ? stands as the peakedness of the spectrum relative to a fully developed spectrum.

As a matter of fact, when ? is equal to one, JONSWAP spectrum equals to the PM

spectrum. In this thesis the peak enhancement factor has been computed as proposed by

Torsethaugen and Haver (2004):



189

? = max

{
1, 42.2

(
2? Hs
gT 2p

)}
. (C.3)

where g is the gravity acceleration.

Torsethaugen wave spectrum

The Torsethaugen wave spectrum has been commonly used as a model for the double

peak spectra at Norwegian seas. It allows the representation of the sea states as a com-

bination of a locally wind generated sea and an incoming swell system. The simplified

wave spectrum adopted in this thesis can be defined as a summation of two JONSWAP

type wave spectra as follows:

S??(f) =
2?
j=1

Ej Sj(f) , (C.4)

where j = 1 represents the primary sea system (locally wind generated) and j = 2 is the

secondary sea system (swell). Regarding the values of E, they can be defined as,

?????
????
E =

1

16
H21Tp1, for j = 1

E =

16
H22Tp2, for j = 2 ,

(C.5)

where H1, Tp1, H2 and Tp2 are given by Eqs. (C.10) and (C.11) for wind sea dominated

cases while for swell dominated cases, Eqs. (C.13) and (C.14) are used to compute these

parameters.

The non dimensional spectral density, Sj, can be written as,

???
??
S??(f) = 3.26 A? f

?4

(
exp

, for j = 1

S??(f) = 3.26 A? f
?4
2 exp{f

?4
2 }, for j = 2 ,

(C.6)

The parameters included in Eq. (C.6) are defined as follows,

f1 = fTp1

f2 = fTp2 ,

? = 0.07, for Tp f &amp;lt;1

sea:

• Wind sea: Tp ? afH

APPENDIX D – ANALYSIS OF THE

HEAVE MOTION

Through the Morison equation it is possible to estimate the forces acting on cylindrical

shaped offshore structures. The computation of these forces allows the estimation of the

motions of a semisubmersible platform (CHAKRABARTI, 2005). In this appendix, due

to the particular interest the heave motions previously explained in section 3.3, only

the vertical motion of a platform is characterized, along with a discussion regarding its

most significant parameters. In order to provide an useful illustration of the heave motion

features, the main characteristics of the platform provided in chapter 5 have been adopted

to compute the relations shown herein.

In this appendix, the vertical responses of the platform are estimated assuming that

the exciting forces are consequence of a wave traveling from port to starbord side of the

platform. This approach allows to keep the model as simple as possible. Thus, using linear

deep water theory and the Morison equation, the vertical force acting on the platform is

obtained as the sum of the following terms,

• Columns: It has been assumed that the waves are traveling at a right angle of the

stern-forward direction of the platform. Consequently, the relative phase of the wave

to the port and the starbord sides of the platform is ? = ±kB
2
?? t, being B the total

beam of the platform, k the wave number and ? the wave frequency. Additionally,

the hydrodynamic mass term of the columns has been assumed sufficiently small to

be neglected. Therefore, the force acting in each column can be written as follows,

Fcz = Pz=?hcAcol = ?g?a Ac exp{?khcol}cos(?) , (D.1)



194

where Acol stands for the area of the column (adopted as a constant along the height

of the column), hcol is the height of the columns.

• Pontoon sections (port or starbord sides): For these sections of the pontoon the

phase properties are equal to the ones used to estimate the force acting on the

columns. Thus,

Fpsz = ?Cm??Pps?a?
2 exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}cos(?) , (D.2)

with Cm = 1 + Ca and ?Pps = ApL the displacement of each part of the pontoon

under study.

• Pontoon section (forward or stern): The procedure followed to estimate the force

acting on these parts of the pontoon is similar to the one adopted above, but in this

case the phase of the force acting on each longitudinal element of the pontoon is

given by ? = kx, with x ? [?B/2,B/2]. consequently, the force acting on one part

of the pontoon can be computed as,

Ffsz = ?
? B/2
?B/2

(D.3)

The vertical force acting on the whole structure can be estimated as the sum of the

respective forces listed above,

of the total water plane area, AcolT , and ?g?a,

From the total vertical force provided in Eq. (D.6), the transfer function of the un-

damped heave motion is given by,

|Zz| =
2?gAcolT F

?
z

czz(1 ? (
?

?n
)2)

,
(D.7)



196

where the restoring coefficient , czz, follows from the hydrostatic buoyancy force of the

columns,

czz = 2?gAcolT . (D.8)

On the other hand, the total mass of the system is given by the mass of the floating

platform and the hydrodynamic mass of the pontoon,

?? + mzz = ?(2?ct + Cm?pont) . (D.9)

Consequently, the natural frequency of this structure can be estimated as,

?n =

?
? gAcolT

2?ct + Cm?pont

?
?

. (D.10)

The relations provided until now are useful to predict the undamped motion of the

semisubmersible platform under study. As a matter of fact, the heave transfer function

presents a cancellation point close to the resonance and its value at the resonant frequency

is infinite. The effects of the velocity-dependent viscous forces can be introduced through

the linearized form of the drag component of the Morison equation,

FDLz =
4

3?
?CdAp[?? ? z?](?? ? z?) .

(D.11)

where ?? is the vertical orbital velocity, z? is the vertical velocity of the platform and Ap is

the effective area of the pontoon. Therefore, and knowing that [???z?] is the representative

velocity amplitude, the drag force can be computed in terms of the heave transfer function,

FDLz =
4

3?
?CdAp[exp{?k(hcol + hpont)}?|Zz|ei?]?a? Ap(?? ? z?) = b33(?? ? z?) ,

(D.12)



197

The resulting terms of the velocity-dependent drag force, bzz??, and damping force,

bzzz?, can be used to estimate the magnitude of the transfer function of the heave motion,

leading to,

Figure D.1: Illustration of heave RAO of motion.

Equation D.13 provides the transfer function of the heave motion, including the drag

and damping forces. Since the value of the velocity-dependent drag force cannot be

computed until the velocity of the structure is known, this method to compute the heave

motion RAO results in an iterative process. It is convenient to highlight that the resulting

transfer function is characterized by:

• As it has been shown before, the inertia forces vanishes close to the resonance of

the heave motion. Consequently, the vertical motion of the structure depends ex-

clusively of the velocity-dependent drag forces. Thus, the amplitude at the (former)

cancellation point close to the resonance of the motion can be estimated as,

• Regarding the amplitude of the motion at the resonance frequency, the first term of

the denominator is reduced to zero (leading to infinite amplitude of the motions if

only the inertia forces are computed), leaving only the damping term. Consequently,

the amplitude of the motion at the resonant frequency is given by,

|Zz| =
Fz + b33??

?a (bzz??)
. (D.15)

The features described above, with regards to the heave motion transfer function,

are also shown in Fig. D.1. This figure provides the RAO of the heave motion esti-

mated through the relations deduced in this appendix and using the characteristics of the

platform provided in chapter 5. This figure also reflects other characteristics previously

listed in section 3.3 regarding Fig. 3.3, such as the fact that in short waves the motion

of the platform is minimum and in long waves the platform predictably follows the wave

amplitude. The estimated heave RAO also shows that the resonant frequency is equal

to ?n = 0.262rad/s, that is close to frequency of the vertical (inertia) forces cancella-

tion (?c = 0.281rad/s). In the high frequency range, that corresponds to short wave

periods, the magnitude of the transfer function indicates successively smaller oscillation

amplitudes, with multiple cancellation points due to the phase of the force and the small

influence of the velocity-dependent forces. Finally, the analytical approach adopted in

this appendix to deduce the heave RAO can be intended as a reasoned explanation of the

influence that non-linear viscous forces will have on the heave motion near the resonance,

modifying the linearly estimated responses as well as the cancellation point close to the

resonance as shown in section 3.3.

APPENDIX E – CONSTRUCTION OF A

SMOOTH PRIOR

DISTRIBUTION

In section 4.4.1 it has been shown that the hypothesis that the unknown spectrum

should be smooth can be expressed through a matrix that stands as an approximation

of the second order finite difference. Thus, the prior distribution is given by (for a given

direction or frequency),

p(x) ? exp

??
?? ? Hx ?

2

2?2

??
? , (E.1)

where H can be defined for a given frequency (m) as (following a similar procedure that

in section 4.4.1),

H =

??????? ? R

(K?1)×(K+1) , (E.2)

where K is the number of discrete wave heading considered.

Nevertheless, due to the rank of matrix H (that is K?1) boundary conditions should

be imposed. In the direction domain (NIELSEN, 2005) it is assumed that: S??(?m,?0) =

S??(?m,?K) and S??(?m,?K+1) = S??(?m,?1). These conditions leads to the following

matrix H1,

H1 =

?
??????? ? R

(K+1)×(K+1) , (E.3)

When it comes to the frequency-domain, for a given direction k, the hypothesis is

that S is smooth and close to zero in the boundary. Thus,

S??(?0,?k) =
1

2
(S??(?0?1,?k)+S??(?0+1,?k))+?p0 =

1

2
(S??(?0+1,?k)))+?p0 , ?p0 ? N(0,?

(E.4)

S??(?M,?k) =

(S??(?M?1,?k)+S??(?M+1,?k))+?pM =

1

2
(S??(?M?1,?k)))+?pM , ?pM ? N(0,?

2
p) ,

(E.5)

It should be highlighted that the wave spectrum has been extended by 0 outside of

the frequency-domain since the prior believe says that is smooth. Finally, the resulting

H2 is,

H2 =

?
???????

2 ?1 0 0 · · · 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 · · · 0 ?1 2

?
??????? ? R

(M+1)×(M+1) , (E.6)

However, since the limits of the frequency-domain are imposed by the limitation due

to the frequency insensitivity of the sensor (in this case the semisubmersible platform),

there is no reason to believe that S must be zero at the boundary. Since the real values of

the spectrum at the boundary in the frequency-domain are unknown, they can be assumed

Gaussian random variables, that properly adhere to the Bayesian nature of the problem,

such as,

S??(?0,?k) ? N

?
?0, ?2

?20

?
? and S??(?M,?k)) ? N

?
?0, ?2

?2M

?

201

Therefore, the prior distribution in the frequency-domain (in direction k) is given by,

P(x) ? exp

??
?? ? H2n x ?

2

2?2

??
? , (E.8)

where H2n is,

H2n =

0 0 0 0 · · · 0 0 ?M

(M+1)×(M+1) , (E.9)

The value of the variance in each component of S should be computed in order to

estimate the values of ?20 and ?
2
M . From Eq. (4.38) it is already known that the variance

of each element of the sea spectrum can be expressed as,

Var(Sj) = ej(

?
RM+1

S2P(S)dS)eTj = ?
2ej(H

T
2n

H2n)
?1ej , (E.10)

where ej stands for the j
th canonical basis vector in RM+1.

If the relation in Eq. (E.10) is computed using the matrix obtained in Eq. (E.6), one

may realize that the maximum uncertainty is reached at the middle of the domain, since

it is the furthest point from the boundary. Consequently, in order to make all the values

equally uncertain, the following relation must be set:

Var(SM/2) = Var(S0) = Var(SM ) = ?
2eM/2(H

T
2n

H2n)
?1eM/2 . (E.11)

This relation leads to,

?20 = ?
2
M =

eM/2(H

H2n)
?1eM/2

. (E.12)

However, Eq. (E.13) requires to solve a non-linear equation, since H2n depends on ?
2
0

and ?2M . Thus, in order to simplify the computing process, Eq. (E.13) may be simplified

as,



202

?20 = ?
2
M =

eM/2(H

?1eM/2

This modified boundary condition introduces slight changes on the original prior dis-

tribution (discussed in section 4.4.1). These modifications may improve the tendency of

the method of locating spurious energy peaks at the bow and stern of the vessel in beam

sea conditions, increasing the chances of determining these energy peaks elsewhere. Since

the data used in this thesis does not reflect the drawback identified by Bispo et al. (2016),

the evaluation of the effect resulting from this modification is something that has been

left as a future work.

APPENDIX F – DRAG EFFECTS

ARISING FROM

MOORING LINES AND

RISERS

The semisubmersible platform, its risers and mooring lines make up a global system

that has a complex dynamic response when excited by waves. In fact, the dynamics

of a semisubmersible platform is quite different from the one presented by ship-shaped

vessel commonly used to make wave inference, such as a FPSO (BISPO et al., 2016).

Among other factors, an important part of this difference is related to the fact that the

semisubmersible’s motions are only weakly damped, one reason for this being the fact that

radiated waves are small due large draft and the cylindrical shape of the columns. For

this reason, the dynamics of semisubmersibles is known to be more sensitive to damping

effects arising from mooring lines and risers (see, for instance Wijaya (2009)). Moreover,

the results presented ins ection 5.2.3 suggest that a proper study of the influence of the

damping and stiffness induced by risers and mooring lines in the heave RAO is needed

to assess the accuracy of the method for estimating extreme waves with very high peak

periods (typical above 20s), which will necessarily impose a significant resonant response

of the heave motion of the Asgard-B platform.

The relevance of a more refined analysis of the motions in high wave periods becomes

even stronger for future wave estimations based on a real semisubmersible platform. For

this purpose a sensitive analysis has been carried out by means of time-domain analysis in

ANSYS-AQWA, which provides a dedicated resource for the motion analysis of floating

platform as well as the effects arising from the submerged lines (see, for instance Jeon

et al. (2013)). Accordingly, the resulting model (see Fig. F.1) was composed by the



204

hull of the platform, which was attached to 16 spread mooring lines and a flexible riser

system of altogether 37 risers, including: Simple catenary risers, lazy wave and lazy-S

risers and whose main features are provided in (LIAN, 1997). The riser and mooring lines

are modelled in the software as a Morsion elements, while its structural properties and

responses are modelled using the ANSYS-MECHANIAL APDL module (see (ANSYS,

2013)). Although the software controls the dynamics of the risers and mooring lines,

some coefficients, such as added mass and drag, as well as the main inertia properties

of the submerged lines must be provided. For this purpose, the values of the drag and

added mass coefficient specified in (SARPKAYA, 2010) have been adopted, meanwhile

the data detailed in (LIAN, 1997) are adopted to model the mass and inertia properties

of the submerged lines.

Figure F.1: ANSYS-AQWA model including the submerged lines.

Therefore, mooring and riser systems were included in the analysis in order to repro-

duce both the damping and stiffness effects. Figure F.2 shows the amplitude of the heave

motion, z, along the time-domain. This result corresponds to the test carried out with

ANSYS-AQWA including risers and mooring lines, with a regular wave with a steepness

equal to 2%. The response of the heave motion has been normalized by the wave am-

plitude, A. In the starting region (T &amp;lt;400s) the mean amplitude of the heave response

fluctuated significantly, time that seems to be related with the time span needed to reach

the force equilibrium and, as a consequence, the steady state. Concerning the responses



205

estimated for T &gt; 400s (referent to the steady state), the mean value of the response

amplitude remained approximately constant.

Figure F.2: Normalized heave amplitude, for the test with wave steepness equal to 2%
and including the risers and mooring lines.

The RAO resulting from taking into account the submerged lines is included in Fig. F.3

for two different wave steepnesses: 0.64% and 2% (orange rhombus and magenta squares,

respectively) along with the RAO obtained previously for the same wave steepness in

Fig. 5.6 (magenta rhombus and orange squares, respectively). One may realize that the

results in this figure including the submerged lines were carried out only for periods up

to 24s, this is due to the lack of convergence of the simulations for higher periods.

The RAOs presented in Fig. F.3 show that the expected response of the heave motion,

including risers and mooring effects in the numerical analysis, present narrow differences

with the RAOs obtained taking in account only the drag effects acting on the pontoon.

Therefore, this preliminary assessment indicates that no significant differences in the esti-

mations of the sea condition should be expected if this new RAO is adopted. Nonetheless,

a dedicated study (experimental and/or numerical) must be carried out in order to accu-

rately determine the possible effects that submerged lines as well as environmental effects

(i.e. wind &amp;amp; currents) may have on the heave responses close to the resonance when deal-
