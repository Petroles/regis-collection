resumo 
 

 

Os biocombustíveis têm estado na linha da frente das políticas energéticas 
mundiais visto que as suas vantagens conseguem colmatar as incertezas e 
resolver alguns dos problemas associados aos combustíveis fósseis. O 
biodiesel tem provado ser um combustível muito fiável, alternativo ao 
petrodiesel. É uma mistura de ésteres alquílicos produzidos a partir de óleos 
vegetais e gorduras animais através de uma reacção de transesterificação. 
Como combustível, o biodiesel é economicamente viável, socialmente 
responsável, tecnicamente compatível e ambientalmente amigável. O principal 
desafio associado ao seu desenvolvimento tem a ver com a escolha de 
matéria-prima para a sua produção. Nos países do terceiro mundo, óleos 
alimentares são mais importantes para alimentar pessoas do que fazer 
funcionar carros.  
Esta tese tem como objectivos produzir/processar biodiesel a partir de 
recursos endógenos de Timor-Leste e medir/prever as propriedades 
termodinâmicas do biodiesel, a partir das dos esteres alquílicos. A síntese do 
biodiesel a partir dos óleos de Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas e borras 
de café foram aqui estudados. As propriedades termodinâmicas como 
densidade, viscosidade, tensão superficial, volatilidade e velocidade do som 
também foram medidas e estimadas usando modelos preditivos disponíveis na 
literatura, incluindo as equações de estado CPA e soft-SAFT.  
Timor-Leste é um país muito rico em recursos naturais, mas a maioria da 
população ainda vive na pobreza e na privação de acesso a serviços básicos e 
condições de vida decentes. A exploração de petróleo e gás no mar de Timor 
tem sido controlado pelo Fundo Petrolífero. O país ainda carece de 
electricidade e combustíveis que são cruciais para materializar as políticas de 
redução da pobreza. Como solução, o governo timorense criou recentemente o 
Plano Estratégico de Desenvolvimento a 20 anos cujas prioridades incluem 
trazer o desenvolvimento do petróleo do mar para a costa sul de Timor-Leste e 
desenvolver as energias renováveis. É neste último contexto que o biodiesel 
se insere. O seu desenvolvimento no país poderá ser uma solução para o 
fornecimento de electricidade, a criação de empregos e sobretudo o combate 
contra a pobreza e a privação. Para ser usado como combustível, no entanto, 
o biodiesel deve possuir propriedades termodinâmicas coerentes com as 
especificadas nas normas da ASTM D6751 (nos Estados Unidos) ou EN 14214 
(na Europa) para garantir uma adequada ignição, atomização e combustão do 
biodiesel no motor.

abstract 

 

The biofuels have been at the forefront of global energy policies as their 
advantages can overcome the uncertainties of fossil fuels. Biodiesel has 
proven to be a very reliable fuel alternative to petrodiesel. It is a mixture of fatty 
acid alkyl esters obtained by the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal 
fat. As fuel, biodiesel is economically viable, socially responsible, technically 
compatible and environmentally friendly. The main challenge associated to its 
development concerns the choice of raw materials for its production. In third 
world countries, edible oils are more important for feeding people than for 
running cars. 
This thesis aims to produce / process biodiesel from resources endogenous of 
Timor-Leste and to measure/predict the thermodynamic properties of biodiesel, 
from those of alkyl esters. The synthesis of biodiesel from oils of Aleurites 
moluccana, Jatropha curcas and coffee waste were here studied. The 
thermodynamic properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, volatility 
and speed of sound were also measured and estimated using predictive 
models available in the literature including some equations of state like CPA 
and soft-SAFT. 
Timor Leste is a country rich in natural resources, but the majority of the 
population still lives in poverty and deprivation of access to basic services and 
decent living conditions. The exploitation of oil and gas in the Timor Sea has 
filled only the Oil Fund. The country still lacks electricity and fuels that are 
crucial to materialize policies for poverty reduction. As a solution, the Timorese 
government has recently established the Strategic Development Plan of 20 
years whose priorities include bringing the development of oil from the sea to 
the south coast of Timor-Leste and developing renewable energy sources. It is 
in this latter context that biodiesel should be considered. Its development in the 
country will be contextually an appropriate solution for electricity supply, job 
creation and especially combat against poverty and deprivation. To be used as 
fuel, however, biodiesel must possess thermodynamic properties consistent 
with those specified in the standards of ASTM D6751 (in USA) or EN 14214 (in 
Europe) to ensure proper ignition, atomization and combustion in diesel 
engines.

CHAPTER 1 

 

General Introduction 

 

 

 

This introductory chapter highlights globally the current framework of biodiesel fuels in 

the international fuel market and specifically their development and prospects in Timor 

Leste for the projects of alleviating poverty and deprivation.

1.1. The rising trend of biofuel 

Nowadays, since «energy &amp;amp; fuel» becomes a frequent matter of worldwide concern 

and discussion, «sustainability» becomes a buzzword on everyone’s lips. Given the 

scarcity of petroleum resources, the oil-importing countries (e.g., the OECD members) are 

constantly worrying about their energy security whereas the oil-exporting countries (i.e., 

the OPEC countries) are apprehensive about the impact of global energy demand on their 

petroleum resources. The truth is that the existing petroleum resources will not be always 

available at reliable prices for the non-OPEC countries much less in the circumstances of 

financial or economic crisis. Moreover, their use is not only costly but also is rigorously 

controlled by the existing international environmental regulations like Kyoto and Montreal 

protocols to avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide 

(CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) [1, 2] that are the main causative 

of global warming and consequent climate changes. It is noted, for example, that the 

overall CO2 emissions from petroleum fuels were 30.3 GtCO2 in 2010 and are foreseen to 

be 37.0 GtCO2 in 2035 [3].  

This disquieting scenario can be a picture of contrasts in the coming decades. On 

the one hand, due to the increase of global population (will reach 9 billion in 2040 ) and to 

the growth of global economy (an annual average rate of 2.8 % from 2010 to 2040 ), the 

worldwide energy demand will be redoubling until 2040 particularly in Africa and Asia 

pacific like China and India [4].The demand for oil will be more noticeable in the sector of 

transportation than other sectors in 2035 (Figure1.1). On the other hand, the offer of crude 

oil for the non-OPEC countries will be in continuous decrement until being negative (-4 

mb/d) in the period between 2020 to 2035 comparing to that of non-crude oil (9 mb/d) [5]. 

This situation has forced governments, civil societies and industries to develop energy 

from renewable resources aiming at reducing the petroleum dependency and mainly at 

providing reliable, affordable and clean energy.

Figure 1 1. Forecast of global energy demand [4] 

In this perspective, biofuels have been already at the forefront of alternative fuels to 

petroleum fuels. Ethanol and biodiesel are able to replace totally or to be blended at any 

proportion with gasoline and petrodiesel respectively to be used in the conventional 

engines as they offer several benefits that can override many uncertainties of petroleum-

based fuels. Beyond renewable and clean, they are domestically produced from agricultural 

products such as sugarcane, oleaginous plants, forest biomass and other sources of organic 

matter [6]. Their production will achieve circa 4.1 Mb/d by 2035 [7] especially when the 

governments also have decided to support financially their development. For example, on 

18
th

 December 2012, five advanced biofuels projects and three bioenergy projects, to be 

hosted in Zone Euro member states, received funding of over €1.2 billion from the 

European Commission [8]. In the United States of America, the administration of president 

Barack Obama also announced in 2012 up to $35 million over three years to support 

research and development in advanced biofuels, bioenergy and high-value bio-based 

products [9]. Shortly, biofuel is now popular in the arena of energy.  

Ethanol is a biocomponent for gasoline produced from sugarcane, sugar beet and 

cereals. Its average annual growth is 12.8 % from 2010 to 2020 [10] and will represent 73 

% of biofuel demand in 2020 [11]. In Brazil, ethanol fuel has been sold as a low blend with 

gasoline (which varies between 18 to 25 % in volume) and also in a pure version (E100) 

[12, 13]. The high level mixture of ethanol with gasoline like E85 is foreseen to be 

available worldwide only in 2035 where circa 37 % of domestic ethanol will be used [14].  



 

5 
 

Biodiesel is a biocomponent for petrodiesel obtained from lipid feedstocks like 

vegetable oils, greases and animal fats [15, 16]. Its average annual growth is 28.2 % from 

2010 to 2020 [11] whose supply and demand are foreseen to continuously increase until 

2020 as illustrated by Figure 1.2 with the European Union being the protagonist of this 

increase (44 % of share). The smaller contribution comes from the North America. In 

Portugal, there is already available in the market petrodiesel with 7 % of biodiesel (B7) 

since January 2010 [17].

1.2.1.1. Compositional profile and synthesis of biodiesel  

Chemically, biodiesel is a fuel composed of monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty 

acids produced from the lipid feedstocks like vegetable oils, grease or animal fats [15, 16]. 

These feedstocks are commonly known as triacylglycerides (TAGs) and the common fatty 

acid groups in biodiesel are described in Table 1.1 where the C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids 

with unsaturation bond up to three are the most common.

Some oils contain other fatty acids like caprilic acid (C8:0), capric acid (C10:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0) and ricinoleic acid (C18:1OH). To 

term these fatty acids as fatty acid esters, one just changes the termination ic in the nomenclature of fatty acids with ate in that of esters (example from 

lauric to laurate). The common acronyms here presented will be used throughout this thesis.

Biodiesel is usually synthesized from the transesterification reaction between the 

triglycerides and short-chain alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of 

catalysts such as an alkali. This reaction is reversible, although the back reaction is largely 

negligible because the glycerol formed is not miscible with the product, leading to a two-

phase system [19]. If methanol is used for the reaction, then the biodiesel produced is 

composed of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). Equation 1.1 expresses the global 

transesterification of triglycerides, where R1, R2, R3 are fatty acid chains.  

 

 

(1.1) 

 

 

There are several basic factors that affect the efficiency of the transesterification 

reaction such as free fatty acids (FFA), water content and proportion of alcohol to oil, 

amount and type of catalyst, reaction temperature and stirring rate. Each factor is equally 

important to achieve a high quality biodiesel which meets the regulatory standards [20]. 

The effect of feedstocks on the efficiency of transesterification reaction is normally 

assessed through FFA level and water content. FFA level is the percentage of saturated or 

unsaturated monocarboxylic acids that occurs naturally in oils but are not attached to 

glycerol backbones [21]. They can be removed in an acid-catalysed transesterification. 

Alkaline transesterification only tolerates oils with less than 3 % of FFA [20] because these 

can react with the catalyst to form soaps that reduce the catalytic efficiency, as well as 

causing an increase in viscosity, the formation of gels and difficulty in achieving 

separation of glycerol [21, 22]. Water content must be as low as 0.1 % to prevent the 

hydrolysis of oils and decrease the conversion of ester [23]. Thus, the removal of the 

moisture content by heating the oil before starting the transesterification reaction is 

recommended.  

 

 



 

8 
 

1.2.1.2.Type of catalysts 

According to the type of catalyst used in the process, transesterification reaction 

can be alkali-catalysed, acid-catalysed or enzyme-catalysed. Each catalyst has its own 

suitability for the reaction, depending on the quality of feedstocks.  

For an alkali-catalysed transesterification, either sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 

potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) could be used with methanol 

or ethanol as well as any kind of oils, refined, crude or frying [24]. Although the alkaline 

catalyst is not corrosive for engine’s metallic parts, it does not deal efficiently with oils 

with high level of FFA and water content. Water retards the transesterification through the 

hydrolysis reaction. It hydrolyzes triglycerides to form more FFA instead of esters as 

shown in equation 1.2. The risk of FFA or water contamination results in soap formation, 

making downstream recovery and purification very difficult and expensive [25]. 

 

(1.2) 

 

 

A major advantage of base-catalysed transesterification is the mild reaction conditions, 

which for the production of methyl esters typically are 1h at 60–65 ºC and ambient 

pressure, 1 % catalyst and a molar ratio of alcohol to oil of 6:1 [21]. 

Acid catalyst is more tolerant of FFA. So it is more suitable to treat oils with high 

levels of FFA [26]. Strong acid such as sulfuric acid can catalyze the esterification of the 

FFA and the transesterification of the triglycerides without formation of soaps. The 

reaction is shown in equation 1.3. 

(1.3) 

 

Although the esterification of FFA is relatively fast, proceeding substantially to 

completion in one hour at 60 ºC, the transesterification of the triglycerides is very slow, 

taking several days to complete. In this case, only an excess of the alcohol solves the 

problem although hinders the recovery of the glycerol [27]. Another problem with acid 



 

9 
 

catalysis is that the water production from the following reaction stays in the reaction 

mixture and ultimately stops the reaction, usually well before reaching completion. 

Moreover the corrosiveness of the acids may cause damage to the equipment and the 

reaction rate can also be low, sometimes taking more than a day to finish [25]. 

Acid catalysis followed by alkali catalysis can improve the transesterification 

process of low quality feedstocks. Each technique will accomplish the process for which it 

is best suited. Acid catalysis is relatively fast for esterification of FFA, so it is used as a 

pretreatment for the high FFA feedstocks to reduce the level of FFA to 0.5-3.0 %, or lower. 

Then an alkali catalyst is added to convert the triglycerides to biodiesel. Although this 

process can convert high FFA feedstocks quickly and effectively, water formation is still a 

problem during the pretreatment phase. An addition of a large excess of methanol during 

the pretreatment can dilute the water produced to the level where it does not limit the 

reaction although this approach will still hamper the separation process.  

Transesterification can also be carried out enzymatically. Lipases can be used as 

catalyst in a solvent-free system to produce biodiesel. It is more appropriate for the 

production of biodiesel from feedstocks containing high FFA and water because the free 

fatty acids are directly esterified into biodiesel [25]. The immobilization of lipase could 

enhance the biodiesel yield. Many studies have been focused on optimizing the reaction 

conditions (solvent, temperature, pH, type of microorganism that generates the enzyme, 

etc.) in order to establish suitable characteristics for an industrial application [27]. Table 

1.2 shows the comparison of the three different transesterification process here described.

The typical industrial production and purification process of biodiesel is illustrated 

in Figure 1.3. The transesterification reaction occurs in a reactor with the oil reacting with 

the methanol, in the presence of a catalyst, to produce methyl esters and glycerol. These 

products then form two phases at the outlet of reactor. The aqueous phase is rich in 

glycerol and the organic phase in fatty esters. The unreacted methanol is distributed 

between them. After reaction, the aqueous phase is sent to the alcohol recovery section 

(section 1) to recover and to purify the glycerol for posterior sale in the market (section 2). 

The removal of excess alcohol from the methyl esters stream leaving the transesterification 

reactor can be performed by flash evaporation or distillation. The organic phase containing 

methyl esters is washed with acidified water to neutralize the catalyst. The washed product 

is then dried to reduce the water content to an acceptable value by the biodiesel required 

standards (section 3).

1.2.2. Practical Concerns: Pros and Cons 

 

1.2.2.1. Pros viewpoints  

As a fuel, biodiesel offers several economic, environmental and technical benefits 

like ready availability, portability, renewability, domestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic 

content, biodegradability, better ignition quality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, 

positive energy balance, greater safety, nontoxic character of the exhaust emissions and 

cleaner burning [15, 23, 29-35] when compared to diesel fuel. Biodiesel degrades, 

however, four times faster than diesel. In pure state it degrades 80-88 % in water after 22-

28 days [36]. It is nonflammable and non-explosive; with a flash point of 423 K compared 

to 337 K for petrodiesel (a higher flash point leads to safe handling and storage). 

Furthermore, it is miscible with petrodiesel in any proportion and can be used in the 

conventional diesel engine with no modification [35, 37-40] because of the great molecular 

similarities of biodiesel to paraffinic diesel fuel compounds [39]. Indeed, biodiesel is most 

often blended with petroleum diesel in ratios of 2 % (B2), 5 % (B5), or 20 % (B20). It can, 

nevertheless, also be used as pure biodiesel (B100) [16]. 

Regarding the emissions, neat biodiesel (B100) reduces carbon dioxide emissions 

by more than 75 % over petroleum diesel, while a B20 reduces carbon dioxide emissions 

by 15 % [41, 42]. Biodiesel also can reduce carbon monoxide by 20 %, unburned 

hydrocarbon by 30 % and particulate matter by 40 %. Other types of emissions like sulphur 

dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are 

also reduced by appreciable magnitudes [1, 42, 43]. Only NOx emissions increase about 

10-15 %, compared to that of petrodiesel, because biodiesel contains 10-11 % of oxygen 

[43-45]. Reductions in NOx tend to be accompanied by increases in particulate emissions 

and fuel consumption [19]. It can be reduced, however, by retarding the injection time [46] 

or using exhaust gas recirculation [47]. 

Beyond the advantages aforementioned, if the development of biodiesel does not 

harm the ecosystems, it can provide new labor and market opportunities related to 

production of domestic crops and their further processing into biodiesel and decreases the 

country’s dependence on imported petroleum or refined products [48]. This enables 

countries with no petroleum resources to join the fuel market, auto sustain their energy 

needs and reduce unemployment.  



 

12 
 

1.2.2.2.  Cons Viewpoints 

Sustainability is the key to the decision. As required for the petroleum fuels, the 

production of biodiesels must also be sustainable. So far the development of biodiesel, 

however, is still facing challenges including feedstock bottleneck and quality issues.  

First, in most cases, biodiesel production is not truly green, renewable nor 

environmentally friendly because it still uses methanol derived from petroleum (10 % of 

the feedstock input) and the synthetic catalysts used for the transesterification process are 

sulfuric acid, sodium or potassium hydroxide, which are highly caustic and toxic [49].  

Second, the dilemma fuel vs. food always remains alive in the third world countries 

where the concerns about the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biodiesel production in 

detriment of the food supply are seriously analysed, namely when the edibles oils are used 

for the purpose. Many voices claim that edible oils are more important for feeding human 

than for running vehicles. This reality makes the price of biodiesel feedstocks soaring and 

the production economically non-viable compared to that of diesel fuel. Note that in recent 

years about more than 85 % of the costs of biodiesel production are field up in feedstock 

costs [46], placing the marketability of biodiesel in constant equation. Beyond that, 

ecologically, conversion of natural habitats into monocultures diminishes biodiversity and 

reduces the natural carbon sink capacity. Converting native ecosystems to biodiesel 

production frequently causes much greater net green house gas releases over a long period 

than the combustion of an energy-equivalent amount of petroleum diesel would do [50].  

Third, some properties of biodiesel need to be improved to achieve high quality. 

The higher kinematic viscosity, higher cloud point and pour point [51], lower oxidation 

stability, hygroscopicity [26], lower calorific value, lower effective engine power, higher 

emission of NOx, reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains [52] and greater sensitivity 

to low temperatures [1] may still compromise the quality of biodiesel and consequently the 

engine performance and exhaust emissions [53]. These properties are generally influenced 

by the quality of feedstock (chain length, branching and degree of saturation) and 

efficiency of biodiesel production and processing. In any situation, the presence of 

impurities in biodiesel, either due to side-reactions, unreacted feedstock, or non-fatty acid 

constituents, may increase pollutants [38, 53]. So, the target is to ensure that the neat 

biodiesel obeys the specifications presented in Table 1.3 for some properties.

In fact, many of the neat biodiesels obtained from different types of oils and fats have 

indeed magnitudes of viscosity and higher heating value (HHV) concordant with the 

standard limits as illustrated in Figures 1.4 and 1.5, respectively. HHV for biodiesel is 

only circa 12 % less than that of petrodiesel (46 MJ/kg), meaning that it is worthy to use 

biodiesel as fuel.

1.2.2.3. Approaches to the challenges 

Many efforts have been developed to delineate the beneficial solutions for the 

challenges of biodiesel development. If the use of virgin edible oils is expensive and 

competes with the food supply, then the use of low cost feedstocks and the development of 

other alternative sources in marginal lands are strongly recommended, not only to increase 

the economic viability of biodiesel, but also the potential supply of this fuel. In this regard, 

many researches have been focused on the use of waste frying oils, animal fats, microbial 

oils and non-edible oils which are not suitable for human consumption and can be 

developed in nonarable lands [16]. However, given the low cost feedstocks have the 

relatively higher amounts of free fatty acids and water content, additional processing steps 

are required to remove any water and either the free fatty acids or soap from the reaction 

mixture to ensure that the final net biodiesel possess required properties. Only the decrease 

in the feedstock costs will affirmatively reduce to an acceptable value the great divergence 

between the prices of biodiesel and diesel fuel.  

The choice of source for biodiesel production and also the reagents used in the 

transesterification process (if they are green or not), however, is made according to the 

availability and cost in each of the producing countries. Indeed for a given production line, 

the comparison of the feedstocks should include issues like cultivation practices, 

availability of land and land use practices, use of resources, soil erosion, contribution to 

biodiversity and landscape value losses, direct economic value of the feedstocks taking 

into account the co-products, creation or maintenance of employment and water 

requirements and water availability among others [51]. In any case the statistics show that 

today more than 95 % of the world biodiesel is produced from edible oils [51]. 

Countries like USA and those belonging to European Union are self-dependent in 

production of edible oils and even have surplus amount to export. Hence, edible oils such 

as soybean and rapeseed are mostly used in USA and European Union, respectively. 

However the use of edible oils to produce biodiesel in Africa and other developing 

countries is not feasible because of the huge gap between the demand and the supply of 

such oils in the developing world [25]. For example India is a net importer of edible oil to 

meet the food requirements, hence the emphasis of biodiesel is on non-edible oils from 

plants such as Jatropha, karanja, neem, mahua, simarouba, etc [20, 45].

1.3. Energy Context in Timor Leste 

 

1.3.1. Current Status and development 

The provision of reliable, affordable and clean energy is crucial for alleviating 

poverty and deprivation because energy is the base of human life. This policy is still not 

easy to implement in Timor Leste, making the country a picture of contrasts during a 

decade of independence. On the one hand, it has abundant fossil and renewable resources 

capable of providing fuels and electricity to the whole country like oil, natural gas, water, 

sun, wind and biomass. If so far the renewable energies are still ongoing projects, the 

undersea oil and gas have been developed for years by Australia and in return Timor Leste 

receives the revenues by 90 % from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and 50 

% from the entire Greater Sunrise field according to the treaty of Certain Maritime 

Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMAT) as exemplified in Figure 1.6 [54]. The revenues 

made the Timorese Petroleum Fund achieve circa $12 billion in 2012, from which 4.6 % 

was used to support the 2013 General State Budget, i.e., an amount lower than that used in 

the 2012 State Budget (6.7 %) but still higher than that of Estimated Sustainable Income 

(3.0 %) [55].  

 

Figure 1 6. Undersea oil and gas resources of Timor Leste [54] 

On the other hand, the country still lacks energy and remains a slave to poverty and 

deprivation. In the sector of electricity generation, the rural territories are not yet electrified 

as only 58 isolated diesel-powered generators are producing about 40 MWatt of electricity 



 

17 
 

to the whole country [56]. Moreover, the existing electricity grid continues to use imported 

fuels. In the sector of transportation, the cars still use Indonesian gasoline and diesel. In the 

residential sector, most households still use candle, kerosene, battery, solar panel and small 

gasoline generators to service their energy needs. The poorest households use regularly 

wood fire as their primary energy for cooking and lighting. For example, in 2006 about 

98.3% of households used woods for cooking (Table1.4) and only 0.8 % got electricity 

from diesel power generators [57]. In short, it can be said that the struggle for the 

alleviation of poverty remains so far a complicated mission for Timor Leste, obliging the 

rural population to live poor and deprived of access to basic services and decent living 

conditions. It is noted that 49.9 % of population live below the poverty line and 38.7 % in 

the severe poverty [58], despite the Gross Domestic product per capita of $1393 reported 

in 2011 and the increase of 2.71 % of Human Index Development (HID) in 2012 from 

2000 [58], standing this as a proof that economic growth does not always expresses the 

poverty reduction. 

Table 1 4. Source of energy used for cooking in 2006 [57] 

Energy source Urban (%) Rural (%) All areas (%) 

Fuel-wood 98.3 98.9 98.7 

Agricultural residues 0.5 0.4 0.4 

Charcoal 0.5 0.7 0.7 

Kerosene 9.2 1.6 3.0 

Electricity  1.2 0.7 0.8 

This controversial scenario happens because of two possible reasons among others. 

First, the country still has very low social capital, technology and know-how to mine its 

own resources and revenues without foreign aids. So during the period of independence, 

Timorese government has been investing intensively on education and skills. The public 

spending in education was 14 % of GDP in 2010 from 2005 [58]. Second, in 1999 the 

Indonesian troops and pro-integration militia destroyed about 70 % of the economic 

infrastructure including all power sector assets, administrative buildings, power stations, 

power lines, and associated records and documentation, solar panels and connection boxes 

at individual home installations, obliging the country to reform all the institutions and 

infrastructures from the scratch during the period of independence. The truth is that before 

the independency, 28.7 % of all Timorese villages were already electrified and about 70 % 

of the households in the electrified villages were connected to the grid [59].  



 

18 
 

To remedy the aforementioned challenges, the Timorese government created 

recently a called Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for 20 years whose priorities also 

include developing the renewable energy sources like biogas, hydropower, solar panel, 

wind power and biomass-based energy, beyond bringing the petroleum or natural gas 

development from the sea, through pipelines, to the south coast of Timor-Leste under the 

Tasi Mane (male sea) project (Figure1.7). The target is to improve the electrification rate 

by 2015 (i.e., everybody will have access to electricity during 24 h) and to satisfy by 2020 

half of the national energy needs with the renewable energy sources and the energy needs 

of 100000 families with solar energy as the rates of daily global sunlight in entire territory 

of Timor Leste are always between 14.85 and 22.33 MJ/m² per day [56]. 

The Tasi Mane Project is planned to start in 2015 and to end in 2030, exactly when 

the number of Timorese population doubles [58]. The success of this project, however, also 

depends on the decision of Australia as the Greater Sunrise project is currently operated by 

Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Osaka Gas companies. Anyway, so far, 

the project continues to be a matter of negotiation between Australia and Timor Leste.

1.3.2. Prospect of biodiesel development  

Since the fossil projects take time to bring benefits to Timor Leste, the development 

of renewable energy is at present an urgent mission and an adequate solution to improve 

the electrification rate and mainly to create jobs for Timorese people. Thereat, among the 

existing renewable energies, biodiesel production has been widely discussed in the country 

since 2008. The biggest concern linked to this project is about choosing feedstocks without 

compromising the food supply as circa 80 % of Timorese population is subsistence 

farmers. Fortunately, the Timorese lands offer solutions to avoid the confrontation between 

food supply and biodiesel production. Beyond some agroforestry wastes, there are 

oleaginous plants like Jatropha curcas (Ahi oan metan in Tetum and pinhão manso in 

Portuguese) and Aleurites moluccana (Kamí in Tetum and Nogueira de Iguapé in 

Portuguese) that produce oils useful for biodiesel production without compromising the 

food security.  

Jatropha curcas belongs to the family of Euforbiaceae (Figure1.8). It has normally 

a height not superior to 3 m. It requires little water and fertilizer and can grow in arid, 

marginal and poor lands, is resistant to pests, produces over 30 to 40 years and the seed has 

a high oil content (30-40 %), which is toxic and may not be suitable for human or animal 

consumption [60]. It is abundant in the Timorese lands and given the current social and 

environmental situation, its cultivation could contribute to the reforestation of large areas 

of the country, reduce soil erosion and allow the economic exploitation of marginal lands 

useless for conventional agriculture and create jobs.  

 

Figure 1 8. Fruits and seeds of Jatropha curcas 

Aleurites moluccana also belongs to the family of Euforbiaceae (Figure 1.9). It is 

an arborescent plant of 20 to 30 feet high, but sometimes as high as 100 feet [61]. It can 



 

20 
 

grow in all kinds of terrain, particularly in tropical climates. Its lipid-containing kernel has 

been used for illumination, pharmaceuticals, and seasonings, while its seed covered with a 

hard shell has been used for children’s toys or ritual offerings [62]. The seeds contain 

about 60 % oil. Sulistyo et al [63] already studied at laboratory scale about the viability of 

producing biodiesel from the oil of Aleurites moluccana. 

 

Figure 1 9. Fruits and seeds of Aleurites moluccana 

As Timor Leste has adequate lands and good climatic condition to promote the 

cultivation of these plants to be sources of biodiesel production, Timorese government 

took on the challenge to explore and strengthen the Jatropha production with foreign 

companies. This effort aimed to set Timor Leste at the forefront of the Southeast Asia 

biofuel producers and mainly create many jobs in Timor Leste. With this in mind, the 

Enviroenergy Developments Australia (EDA) Company and Daba-Loqui, a Timorese 

company, signed in 2005 a deal to develop Jatropha plantations in Timor-Leste and other 

territories aiming at building an oil extraction plant in Timor-Leste to extract oil from 

seeds of the Jatropha plant for biodiesel production. The agreement was again updated in 

2008 by Timor Leste, giving to the EDA Company a possibility to access to 59 hectares of 

industrial land on the waterfront at Carabella (Baucau) and to purchase for a 30 year lease, 

with options to renew for an additional 60 years. The seeds of Jatropha would also be 

imported from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and India. The installation of 

Biodiesel Extraction and Refining Facility, Jatropha Pellet Facility and Jatropha Pellet 

Plant would require an estimated capital investment of $550 million dollars over 10 years. 

The target was to produce 100 million liters of biodiesel oil per year in Timor and to build 

a biomass power plant at Carabella, as well as a waste treatment facility and potable water 

supply plant [64]. 



 

21 
 

Regarding Aleurites moluccana there is no plan yet about using its oil to produce 

biodiesel. The use of the seeds for seasoning is common for Indonesia but it is not for 

Timor Leste. So the actual final oil extracted by Acelda Company since 2006 in Baucau is 

exported to Hawaii for cosmetic purposes.  

Timor Leste also has abundant coffee plantations especially in the occidental part of 

the country. It has been crucial to the country’s overall economy and has served as the 

primary source of income for about 25 % of the country’s population [65]. The discovery 

of Nevada researches about producing biodiesel from the coffee waste oil (10-15%) [66] 

will value the Timorese coffee in the international market. After all, coffee is not only for 

beverage but could also be used for biofuel production.   

 

1.4. Scopes, objectives and organization of this thesis 

This thesis emphasizes globally the rising trend of biodiesel in the international fuel 

market as alternative fuel for diesel engines and specifically its prospects in Timor Leste. 

This biofuel has gained a prominent place in the arena of energy, as already introduced 

above, because petroleum resources are increasingly limited, constantly soaring and 

sustainability stays frequently in a complex equation namely for the oil-importing 

countries. Biodiesel can ensure, to them, energy security, economic growth, environmental 

safety and human-wellbeing as its benefits constitute a potential therapy for the 

uncertainties of petroleum fuels. For Timor Leste, the expectation is that, the development 

of a biodiesel refinery will contribute to the alleviation of poverty and deprivation and 

possibly will place the country at the forefront of biodiesel producers without jeopardizing 

the environmental wellbeing. The erection of a biodiesel refinery is adequate to the actual 

social context of Timor Leste because, the revenues from the undersea fossil resources still 

do not be a Messiah for the country.  

Howsoever, to be used as a fuel, pure or blended with petrodiesel, biodiesel must 

have good quality. So, the study of thermodynamic properties is important for the 

optimization of the production and processing of biodiesel. Unfortunately, the exhaustive 

information about them is still scant much less at the working conditions of the diesel 

engines. Thereat, the aims of this thesis cover two key-issues: production/processing of 



 

22 
 

biodiesel fuels and measurement/prediction of thermodynamic properties of biodiesel (also 

feed oils and fatty esters). These key-issues are incorporated in five main chapters: 

Chapter 1 is the general introductory chapter that already highlighted the global 

framework of biodiesel potential in the international fuel market and specifically its 

prospect in Timor Leste for alleviating poverty and deprivation.  

Chapter 2 will focus especially on the importance of lipase as catalyst for the 

production of biodiesel. It presents mainly the basic informations about improving the 

lipase production in the fermentation of bacteria Bacillus sp. ITP-001 using several oxygen 

vectors and inducers.  

Chapter 3 will address the measurement and prediction of thermodynamic 

properties of biodiesel, feed oils and fatty esters that compose biodiesel. So it will expose, 

beyond the experimental data of several properties (such as density, viscosity, surface 

tension, volatility, speed of sound both at wide range of temperatures and pressures), the 

predictive models capable of computing the experimental data.  

Chapter 4 will concern the use of soft-SAFT Equation of State for prediction of the 

thermodynamic properties of fatty esters and biodiesels like density, surface tension, speed 

of sound and viscosity at wide range of temperatures and pressures.  

Chapter 5 will report the production of biodiesel from oils endogenous of Timor 

Leste (Jatropha curcas, Aleurites moluccana and coffee waste) and also the evaluation of 

their thermophysical properties using the models already studied in Chapter 3.  

Chapter 6 and so on will set out the general conclusions, concluding remarks and 

future works.

CHAPTER 2 

 

 

Production of lipase by the fermentation of Bacillus sp. 

ITP-001 
 

 

 

This chapter discusses in particular the production of lipase by the submerged 

fermentation of Bacillus sp. ITP-001. The initial goal of this part of work was to produce, 

separate, purify and immobilize lipase for posterior use as catalyst in the enzymatic 

synthesis of biodiesel. However, as the processing of lipase did not reach the final stage 

and the enzymatic transesterification was not performed, this chapter only reports the 

results linked to the production of lipase namely to the effects of inducers (i.e., vegetable 

oils) and oxygen vectors (perfluorodecalina, dodecane and particles of silica) on lipase 

activity.

2.1. Introduction 
 

Enzymes are innovative solutions for many bioconversion processes as they work 

at expense of mild reaction conditions, low energy demand, decrease in side reactions, high 

degree of specificity and simplicity of post-recovery [67]. Of all known enzymes, lipases 

(triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, E.C.3.1.3) have attracted most attention due to their broad 

industrial applications. They catalyze hydrolysis of carboxylic ester bonds and organic 

synthesis such as esterification, interesterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis and aminolysis 

[67-69]. Microbial lipases, mainly bacterial and fungal, represent the most widely used 

enzymes in biotechnological applications and organic chemistry because of their diversity 

in catalytic activity, high yield and low cost production, as well as relative ease of genetic 

manipulation [70]. Moreover, they are stable in organic solvents, do not require cofactors 

and accept a broad range of substrate (i.e., aliphatic, alicyclic, bicyclic and aromatic esters, 

thioesters and activated amines) whilst maintaining high regio-, chemo- and 

enantioselectivity [71]. This versatility makes microbial lipases of choice for potential 

applications in the food, detergent, pharmaceutical, textile, leather, cosmetic, paper 

industries (for pitch control), waste treatment (breakdown of fat solids) and biodiesel 

production [67]. 

The efficiency of lipase production, in solid state fermentation by fungi or in 

submerged fermentation by bacteria, depends on strain, nutritional and physico-chemical 

factors such as growth media composition (nitrogen and carbon sources), presence of 

lipids, inorganic salts and cultivation conditions (pH, temperature, agitation and dissolved 

oxygen concentration–for aerobic microorganism) [72]. Since lipases are inducible 

enzymes, their activity is only known in the presence of inducers like oils, lipids and fatty 

acids [73-77]. In aerobic cultures, i.e., when a supply of oxygen is a limiting factor, a high 

yield is only achieved with a good aeration, which depends greatly on oxygen solubility in 

the media and diffusion rate into the broths to satisfy the oxygen demand of microbial 

population. Unfortunately oxygen, unlike other nutrients, is poorly soluble in aqueous 

media. The solubility of oxygen in water is just 7.95 mg/L
 
 at 30 ºC [78]. 

The conventional approach to overcome this limitation involves improved 

bioreactor design, agitator and sparger as well as the use of oxygen-enriched air. Other 

solutions may include the manipulation of microbial metabolism through genetic 



 

26 
 

engineering [79]. A novel approach is the use of water-insoluble oxygen vectors in which 

oxygen has a greater solubility such as hydrocarbons [80], perfluorocarbons (PFCs) [81, 

82], natural and synthetic oils [83] and functionalized magnetic nanoparticles [84]. Beyond 

enhancing the oxygen transfer rate, without the need for extra energy supply, and 

preventing foam formation [85], these can act as surface active agents to lower the surface 

tension of water and increase the gaseous specific interfacial area [86]. Moreover, oxygen 

vectors avoid the damage of cells (especially mammalian cells) caused by mechanical 

agitation and air bubbles [87]. PFCs have been applied very successfully in the culture of 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae [88], immobilized Streptomyces coelicolor [89], insect cells and 

virus-infected insect cells [90] and Yarrowia lypolytica [82, 91]. They are petroleum-based 

compounds synthesized by substituting the hydrocarbons hydrogen atoms by fluorine. Due 

to the presence of very strong carbon-fluorine bonds they are non-toxic towards the cells, 

stable and chemically inert [82]. Their interesting peculiarity is their high solubility of 

gases. Oxygen solubility in PFCs is 10-20 times higher than that in pure water [92, 93]. 

Furthermore due to the low solubility of PFCs in water [94], there is no change in the 

properties of the aqueous phase, while an increase on the oxygen mass transfer is achieved 

[95] leading to the enhanced performance of the process with an easy recovery of PFCs at 

the end of fermentation. Beside PFCs, some immiscible organic solvents have also been 

used with success in fermentation process as oxygen vectors. N-dodecane has been used in 

the culture of Crypthecodinium cohnii fermentations and DHA production [96] and in the 

production of L-asparaginase by Escherichia coli [85]. Karimi et al [97] evaluated the 

capacity of silicon oil to increase the oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) in the treatment of 

gas containing benzene, toluene and xylene and found that silicon oil was only beneficial 

to the process at low concentration. The ability of some suspended hydrophobic particles to 

enhance the mass transfer were also tested in the adsorption of surfactants where, at low 

solid loadings, these particles increased significantly the mass transfer rates [98]. 

This work aims to evaluate the ability of oils of coconut, Aleurites moluccana, 

Jatropha curcas and coffee waste as inducers, and the capability of perfluorodecaline, n-

dodecane, silica particles and silicon oil as oxygen vectors, to improve the lipase 

production by Bacillus sp. ITP-001. As aforementioned, so far only two works [76, 77] 

reported the use of this strain to produce lipase, but without oxygen vectors.

2.2. Materials and methods 

 

2.2.1. Inducers 

Oils of Aleurites moluccana and Jatropha curcas were obtained by solid-liquid 

extraction of the corresponding seeds in a Soxlet unit with 250 mL of n-hexane. Coffee 

waste oil was obtained by the same process from the wastes collected at the University of 

Aveiro while coconut oil was purchased from Brazilian market. These oils were always 

sterilized in autoclave at 121 ºC before being added in 4 % of volume fraction to the 

culture media. 

2.2.2. Oxygen vectors 

Perfluorodecaline was purchased from F2 Chemicals Limited. N-dodecane of 99 % 

purity and silicon oil were purchased from Sigma. These liquids were always sterilized by 

filtration through 0.45 µm filters and saturated with oxygen before being added to all 

experiments at inoculation time. Two types of silica particles were used. Particles of silica 

A were produced in our laboratory with circa 200 nm of diameter while silica B, 

nanoparticles of silica with 10 nm of diameter, was purchased from Sigma. The particles of 

silica A were synthesized following the Stober method that is based on the hydrolysis of 

tetra-alkyl silicate in homogeneous alcoholic medium using ammonia as a catalyst [99]. 

2.2.3. Strain and media 

Bacillus sp. ITP-001 was isolated from soil with a history of contact with 

petroleum. It was maintained in nutrient agar tubes and stored at 4 °C. The culture media 

consisted of (% w/v): starch (2.0), peptone (0.13), yeast extract (0.6), MgSO4.7H2O (0.05), 

NaNO3 (0.3), KH2PO4 (0.1), triton X-100 (2.0). The media was always adjusted to pH 5.0 

and then sterilized in the autoclave at 121 °C for 22 minutes. 

2.2.4. Cultivation conditions 

The experiments were carried out in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks on an orbital shaker 

at 32 °C. Each flask was filled with 100 mL of culture media. To this, a known amount of 

the oxygen vector was added, before being inoculated with 10 % (v/v) of an inoculum of 

48 h old. At 72 h of fermentation, the inducer was added to the broth and the culture was 

carried up to 168 h.

2.2.5. Analysis 

 

2.2.5.1. Lipase activity assay 

The lipase activity was assayed in accordance with the methodology of Soares et al 

[76, 77] using olive oil as substrate. This was initially prepared as an emulsion of olive oil 

and water (50:50) with arabic gum (7 %). Then 2 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, 

pH 7.0) were added to 5 mL of this emulsion. This mixture was stirred at 100 rpm on an 

orbital shaker at 37 °C. An aliquot of 1 mL of enzyme solution was added and the reaction 

occurred for 5 min. A sample of 0.33 mL of reaction solution was withdrawn and added to 

2 mL of acetanolic solution (water: ethanol: acetone, 1:1:1) to stop the reaction. This 

mixture was then titrated with a potassium hydroxide solution using phenolphthalein as 

indicator. One unit of enzyme activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that 

liberates one µmol of free fatty acids per minute (µmol/min) under the assay conditions.  

 

2.2.5.2. Cell biomass, protein and starch 

Cell growth biomass was measured by using centrifugation (2500 rpm, 10 min) 

followed by drying in the oven (105 ºC) until constant weight. Biomass was expressed as 

mg of cell dry weight per millilitre. Analyses of protein and starch were performed 

according to the Bradford method [100] and Soccol method [101] respectively.  

2.2.5.3. Emulsion stability 

The emulsion stability was measured according to the method of Lima et al [102]. 

The emulsion was prepared by mixing 50 ?L of oil with 12.5 mL of the culture media. 

This mixture was then shaken during two minutes at room temperature and paused for 10 

min before reading its absorbance at 540 nm over time. The blank contained only the 

culture media. The decay constant (kd) is the slope of the ln (Abs) versus time. The lower 

the value of this parameter the higher the stability of the emulsion. 

2.2.5.4. Experimental design and statistical analysis 

To study the effect of perfluorodecaline concentration and agitation rate on lipase 

production, an Experimental Design of 2
2 

factorial with three replications at the central 



 

29 
 

point was carried. The experimental data were then analyzed with Statistica
®

, version 7.0 

to obtain surface response and Pareto diagram. 

2.2.5.5. Kinetic parameters 

Some kinetic parameters namely the specific rate of growth (µ in h
-1

); the specific 

rates of substrate consumption and product formation (qs and qp in g/(g.h) and the yield 

factors of dry cell biomass and protein (YX/S and YP/S in g/g) were determined at the 

conditions of maximum productivity of lipase using the Eqs. 2.1- 2.5, where X, S and P 

represent biomass, substrate (starch) and product (enzyme) respectively.

2.3. Results and discussion 

 

2.3.1. Effect of inducers 

As mentioned above, lipase activity in the fermentation broth is only observed in 

presence of an inducer that can be oil or a fatty acid. Thereat, many works have studied the 

influence of vegetables oils and fatty acids in various fermentation processes. Dalmau et al 

[73] and Lakshami et al [74] reported that the highest yields of enzyme were obtained with 

lipids or fatty acids as carbon sources where the amount of lipase secreted correlated well 

with the relative percentage of C18:n fatty acid esters, namely oleic acid (C18:1), present 

in the respective oils. Obradors et al [75] also observed that C18:1 as inducer was 

beneficial for lipase production by Candida rugosa. Only Makhzoum et al [103] found a 

repressing effect of C18:1 on the production of lipase by Pseudomonas Fluroescens 2D. 

These results show that the ability of inducers to improve lipase production depends also 

on the type of strain used. Certain inducers can be beneficial for a strain but prejudicial for 

others.  



 

30 
 

This work evaluated the induction ability of four different oils (coconut oil, coffee 

waste oil, Aleurites moluccana oil and Jatropha curcas oil) on lipase production by 

Bacillus sp. ITP-001. The cultivation occurred at 200 rpm and the amount of oil used was 4 

% (v/v). The run with coconut oil (without oxygen vector) was used as control. This strain 

was already used in previous works by Carvalho et al [76] to evaluate the induction ability 

of coconut oil, olive oil and castor oil, having obtained the lipase activity of 1675, 1200 

and 1400 U/mL ,respectively and by Feitosa et al [77] that achieved 4370 U/mL of lipase 

activity using palm oil. 

In this work, when coconut oil was used as inducer, the maximum lipase activity 

obtained was 1642 U/mL which is consistent with that reported by Carvalho et al [76] 

(1675 U/mL). The corresponding maximum biomass (0.36 mg/mL), however, was much 

higher than that of Carvalho (~0.070 mg/mL), evincing that, although lipase is a growth - 

associated product, there is no linear correlation between cell growth and lipase production 

by the strain here used. Using other oils, the lipase activities obtained were 2249, 2112 and 

1630 U/mL, respectively for coffee waste oil, Aleurites moluccana oil and Jatropha curcas 

oil. Figure 2.1 shows the profile of lipase activity over the fermentation time for the four 

inducers studied. The maximum lipase activity was obtained between 120 and 144 h of 

fermentation time.

So far it is known that inducers are important for the production of lipase, some 

being better than others. Instead of using the oil composition to discuss the results as some 

works did, in this work we used the emulsion stability, represented by the decay constant

(kd), to justify the discrepancy in lipase activities between the inducers based on the 

principle that only a stable emulsion reduces the size of oil drops and the respective surface 

tension in water-oil to enable the better contact with microorganism and consequently 

guarantee an easy assimilation of respective oil as carbon source for the bacteria. Table 2.1 

shows that coffee waste oil formed a stable emulsion with the media, presenting a smaller 

kd and thus higher lipase activity, followed by Aleurites moluccana oil and coconut oil 

while Jatropha curcas oil presented higher kd and lower relative lipase activity. So, the 

order of emulsion stability matters for the lipase production. In terms of relative values, 

coffee waste oil increased the lipase activity about 37 % of the control and Aleurites 

moluccana oil about 29 %.

2.3.2. Effect of oxygen vectors 

 

2.3.2.1. Influence of perfluorodecaline concentration and agitation rate 

Several works have reported the potential use of perfluorodecaline as oxygen vector 

in aerobic cultures. Elibol et al [79] included 50 % of perfluorodecaline in the culture of 

Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to increase the maximum antibiotic concentration by a 5-

fold. Amaral et al [91] enhanced lipase production by Y. lipolytica by 23-fold at 250 rpm 

using 20 % (v/v) PFC and 2 % (w/v) of glucose as substrate.  

Aiming to evaluate the influence of perfluorodecaline concentration (% v/v) and 

agitation rate (rpm) in the culture of Bacillus sp. ITP-001, this work used the Experimental 

Design of 2
2 

factorial with three replications at the central point to perform the experiments 

using coconut oil as inducer. The results from here obtained were used to generate Pareto 

diagram (Figure 2.2) which shows that agitation rate was the more influent parameter than 

perfluorodecaline concentration and the interaction between the parameters had a 

negligible effect on lipase production. 



 

32 
 

 

Figure 2 2. Diagram of Pareto for the model tested for lipase activity 

The same conclusion was obtained by the ANOVA analysis (Table 2.2) through 

the lower p-value for the agitation rate. The response surface curve (Figure 2.3) addressed 

the positive effect of both parameters, i.e., higher lipase activity is obtained at higher 

concentration of perfluorodecaline and agitation rate.

For an aerobic culture, these results are expected since perfluorodecaline improves 

the oxygenation of the culture media and higher agitation rate improves the homogeneity 

of the system, the emulsion stability, the distribution of perfluorodecaline and the bubbles 

on the system. 

The optimal cultivations conditions found for lipase production by Bacillus sp. ITP-

001 were 20 % (v/v) of perfluorodecaline and 200 rpm of agitation rate (Table 2.3). At this 

condition, the lipase activity was increased to circa 4-fold of control that is much lower 

than the value observed by Amaral et al [90] with Y. Lipolytica. This difference shows that 

the strains have different responses to the oxygen vectors.

2.3.2.2. Influence of perfluorodecaline in presence of different inducers 

Using the optimal operating conditions identified using the Experimental Design 

described above, the effect of perfluorodecaline on lipase production were also studied in 

presence of several inducers namely oils of Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas and 

coffee waste. The results, shown in Table 2.4, indicate that the inclusion of 20 % (v/v) 



 

34 
 

perfluorodecaline in the culture media increased the lipase activity to more than 2-fold of 

the control, for all inducers.

Based on the order of emulsion stability, it was expected that coffee oil would 

present higher lipase activity than other oils in the presence of perfluorodecaline. The 

results, however, revealed that, in the presence of perfluorodecaline, coconut oil increased 

lipase activity to circa 4-fold of the control, even if it formed less stable emulsions when 

compared with coffee waste oil. In cultures aerated by oxygen vectors the emulsion 

stability is no longer the only explanatory parameter for the inducer effect. Regarding the 

cell growth, as shown in Figure 2.4 below, the results support the absence of dependence 

between cell growth biomass and lipase activity for the culture of Bacillus sp. ITP-001.

The profiles of starch, dry cell biomass and lipase activity for the coconut oil in the 

presence of 20 % perfluorodecaline are shown in Figure 2.4. In general, as expected, there 

was consumption of starch, increase of biomass and lipase production over the

fermentation time. A situation of diauxia (sequential consumption of two substrates) was 

observed even with low intensity.  

The kinetics parameters for the fermentation with several inducers in presence of 

perfluorodecaline were determined under conditions of maximum production of lipase and 

the results are shown in Table 2.5.  

Table 2 5. Kinetic parameters for different inducers

Yp/s g/g 387.57 245.13 178.09 319.83 

They indicate that the specific rate of growth (µ) is similar for all inducers. The 

specific rates of substrate consumption (qs) and product formation (qp), on the other hand, 

are dissimilar for the various inducers studied and the higher values were obtained for 

coconut oil and coffee waste oil. This fact echoed in high yields of lipase (Yp/s) obtained 

with these oils. Again the results indicate that there is no linear correlation between the cell 

growth biomass and the lipase production as even though the yield of biomass (Yx/s) is low 

for coconut oil (0.079 g/g), the production of lipase is high (387.57 g/g). Theoretically, a 

linear dependency of lipase production on cell growth biomass can be expressed by the 

mixed model of Luedeking et al [104] presented in Eq. (2.6) below, were ? and ? are the 

fitting parameters. Many works have reported lipase production to be a microbial growth 

associated product. Puthli et al [105], for example, dealt with a linear dependency of lipase 

production on cell growth in the culture of Candida rugosa. 

               (2.6) 

 However, the non association between cell growth and lipase production observed 

in this work is not an extraneous case and has been reported by other authors. Deive et al 

[106] studied the culture of aerobic Bacillus strain and verified that lipase production was 

found not to be a microbial growth associated product. This situation happened when the 

lipase activity is detected just at the stationary growth phase. 

  



 

36 
 

2.3.2.3. Influence of other oxygen vectors in presence of different inducers 

 Other oxygen vectors like silica particles, n-dodecane and silicon oil were also 

evaluated in presence of coconut oil for their ability to improve lipase production by 

Bacillus sp. ITP-001. The runs were carried at 200 rpm. Hydrophobic particles, n-dodecane 

and silicon oils were previously reported to enhance the mass transfer rates in some 

fermentation processes [97, 98].  

Using silica particles as oxygen vector, two different behaviors were observed. For 

the larger particles (silica A), lipase activity increased for the lower silica concentrations 

up to 0.12 g and then decreased with the increasing amount of particles as shown in Table 

2.6. 

Table 2 6. Influence of silica A in Lipase production 

Silica A (g) Control ? 0.12 ? 0.15 ? 0.30 ? 0.50 ?

Rel-LA (%)  100  129.2  108.2  102.6  99.5  

For the best conditions an enhancement of about 30% on the lipase production was 

observed. The opposite effect was observed for the smaller particles (silica B). For these 

the lipase activity was severely compromised but recovered with the increasing amount of 

particles in the culture media as shown in Table 2.7. 

Table 2 7. Effect of silica B on Lipase production

Regarding the n-dodecane and silicon oil, the results are shown in Table 2.8 for a 

20 % (v/v) and compared with perfluorodecaline. An increase of around 11 % of in the 

lipase activity was observed with n-dodecane while Silicon oil, had a repressing effect on 

lipase production. Kaya et al [98] suggest that only concentrations below 10 % silicon oil 

are beneficial for increasing oxygen mass transfer. This may explain the poor result 

observed on this work.

2.4. Conclusions 

The influence of various inducers and oxygen vectors on the production of lipase 

by Bacillus sp. ITP-001 was here studied. It is here shown that the production process can 

be improved by using perfluorodecaline as oxygen vector and the optimal operating 

conditions here obtained were 20 % (v/v) of perfluorodecaline concentration and 200 rpm 

of agitation rate. At this conditions, perfluorodecaline increased the lipase activity to circa 

4-fold. Regarding other oxygen vectors, n-dodecane enhanced the lipase activity by about 

11 % and silica A by about 29 % while silicon oil and silica B had a repressing influence in 

lipase production. About the induction ability, without oxygen vectors, coffee waste oil 

was better than other oils here studied due to its higher emulsion stability. In presence of 

perfluorodecaline, coconut oil revealed to be the best inducer and the emulsion stability 

ceases to be the unique explanatory parameter.  

In all cases no direct correlation was observed between the cell growth biomass and 

lipase activity. The optimal conditions for lipase production seem thus to be using 20 % 

(v/v) of perfluorodecalin with coconut oil as inducer.

CHAPTER 3 

 

 
Thermodynamic properties of biodiesels, fatty esters and 

feed oils: measurement and prediction  
 

 

 

One of the key-challenges linked to the use of biodiesel is that its properties may not be 

concordant with those established in the standards. The knowledge of thermodynamic 

properties becomes crucial for process modeling and product design of biodiesel 

manufacturing. Thereat, this chapter provides experimental data of several properties like 

density, viscosity, vapor pressure, surface tension and speed of sound for biodiesel, fatty 

esters and also feed oils as well as methods capable of predicting them at a wide range of 

temperatures and pressures. The ester nomenclature adopted throughout this chapter is 

based on the fatty acid chain length. A Cx:y ester means the alkyl ester of fatty acid with 

x carbons and y unsaturations.

41 
 

3.1. Relevance of studying thermodynamic properties 

Despite the many promising advantages and merits that biodiesels can offer to 

override the uncertainties of petrodiesel, to be used in diesel engines, however, their 

properties must be coherent with those specified in the standards [107, 108] in order to 

guarantee suitable ignition, atomization and combustion of this fuel in diesel engines. This 

means that all the steps involved in the manufacturing of biodiesel, since the processing of 

feedstocks (oils or fats) until the purification of the product, must be always carried out at 

the optimum conditions. In this regard, the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of 

biodiesel, feed oils and fatty esters (that compose biodiesels) become crucial not only for 

designing the better technology for biodiesel manufacturing but also for enhancing the 

engine performance. 

The knowledge of thermodynamic properties is also relevant for high-pressure 

technology. This, commonly coupled with thermal processing, has been used in many 

engineering applications such as in food processing to achieve stable food products, 

additive free and microbiologically safe, as the constituents and the contaminants of food 

can be controlled under this condition [109-113] and in the fuel industry to get low 

pollutant levels and lower fuel consumption through the enhancement of combustion 

process using of the common rail fuel injection system [114-116]. High-pressures in the 

processing of vegetable oils are used for their extraction from the corresponding seeds, the 

fractionation of their constituents with supercritical fluids [117-119] and also for the 

production of biodiesels at near or supercritical conditions [120, 121]. 

The supercritical fluid extraction of oil from seeds, in special, is already considered 

to be more beneficial than the conventional technology as it does not require the distillation 

and the solvent removal processes normally involved in the conventional extraction [122]. 

Moreover, the efficiency of the extraction is simply controlled by the pressure and/or the 

temperature of operation , the contact time and the solubility of the oil in the extracting 

fluids [123]. This feature can be also applied for the extraction of oil constituents with 

supercritical fluids as already addressed elsewhere in the literature [124, 125]. 

Regarding biodiesel, it is known that transesterification with supercritical alcohol 

constitutes a better technical approach to the conventional catalytic transesterification of 

low quality feedstocks [126] as the alkaline-catalyzed transesterification is very sensitive 



 

42 
 

to the purity of the reactants [127]. Moreover, the injection of biodiesel in diesel engines is 

usually done at very energetic conditions. This chapter aims to provide experimental data 

of several properties like density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure and speed of 

sound either for biodiesel, fatty esters or feed oils and ultimately to recommend methods 

capable of predicting each property at wide range of temperatures and pressures.  

In all studies, the predictive ability of the models studied is evaluated by simply 

calculating the relative deviations (RDs) between predicted and experimental data 

according to Eq. (3.1.1). Afterwards, the overall average relative deviation (OARD) was 

calculated through Eq. (3.1.2), where Ns is the number of systems studied and the average 

relative deviation (ARD) is the summation of the modulus of RD over Np experimental 

data points.

3.2. Measurement and prediction of biodiesel density 

 

 

3.2.1.  Density of methylic biodiesels  

The production and the measurement of atmospheric density for ten methylic 

biodiesel samples used in this work were carried out at our Laboratory by Dr. 

Maria Jorge Pratas. The complete work is already published as paper in the 

journal of Energy &amp;amp; Fuels [128]. The fitting of the parameters for Revised 

GCVOL method was also done by her.  The measurement of high-pressure 

density was done in Spain at the University of Vigo by Prof. Manuel Piñeiro 

and his group. This section only reports my direct contribution to the paper 

that was the prediction of high-pressure density of biodiesel fuels using the 

revised GCVOL group contribution method.

3.2.1.1. Introduction 

Density is an important property for a fuel because injection systems, pumps and 

injectors must deliver an amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide proper combustion 

[129]. So it influences the amount of mass injected in diesel engines [130] [131]. Density 

data is important in numerous unit operations in biodiesel production and required to be 

known to properly design reactors, distillation units and separation process, storage tanks 

and process piping [132, 133]. The magnitude of density depends on the raw materials 

used for biodiesel fuel production and on the biodiesel alkyl esters profile [134]. So the 

capacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities from the composition of fatty esters is of 

major relevance for a correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at 

producing biodiesel according to the required quality standards [135, 136] with the lowest 

production costs. 

This section used the new experimental density data for ten biodiesel samples 

measured at temperatures from 278.15 to 373.15 K to assess the adequacy of revised 

GCVOL group contribution method for predicting the high-pressure densities of biodiesel 

fuels.  

 

3.2.1.2. Experimental section 

 

3.2.1.2.1. Biodiesel sample synthesis 

Ten biodiesel samples were here studied. Two of these samples were obtained from 

Portuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and GP (Soybean+Rapeseed). Eight 

biodiesel samples were synthesized at our laboratory by a transesterification reaction of the 

vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), and their respective binary and 

ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), 

and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and Sunflower (Sf). The molar ratio of oil: methanol 

used was 1:5 with 0.5 % sodium hydroxide by weight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was 

performed at 55 ºC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was 

adopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol 

was removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a 

separating funnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral 



 

46 
 

pH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was 

reached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer 

titration.  

 

3.2.1.2.2. Determination of FAME composition 

The composition of the fatty acid esters in these biodiesels was analyzed using a 

capillary gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID). This equipment is a 

Varian CP-3800 with a FID in a split injection system with a Varian GC column CP 9080 

select biodiesel for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 ?m). 

The column temperature was set at 120 ºC and then programmed to increase up to 250 ºC 

at 4 ºC/min. The detector and injector were set at 250 º C. The carrier gas was helium with 

a flow rate of 2 mL/min.  

 

3.2.1.2.3. Density measurement 

Atmospheric density was measured at our Laboratory in the temperature range of 

278.15 to 373.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar 

rotational Stabinger Viscometer. The apparatus was equipped with a vibrating U-tube 

densimeter. The absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 kg/m
3
. The SVM 3000 uses 

Peltier elements for fast and efficient thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is ± 

0.02 K from 288.15 to 378.15 K. The SVM was previously tested for other compounds and 

presented a very good reproducibility [135, 137]. The instrument was rinsed with ethanol 

three times and then pumped in a closed circuit at constant flow of the solvent during 

twenty minutes at 323 K. This cleaning cycle was repeated with acetone and then kept at 

343 K for thirty minutes under a stream of air to ensure that the measurement cell was 

thoroughly cleaned and dried before the measurement of a new sample.  

The experimental procedure of high-pressure density measurement is already 

described elsewhere [138-140]. An Anton Paar 512P vibrating tube densimeter, connected 

to an Anton Paar DMA 4500 data acquisition unit was used for this purpose. Temperature 

stability was ensured with a PolyScience 9510 circulating fluid bath, and the temperature 

value was determined with a CKT100 platinum probe placed in the immediacy of the 

density measuring cell, with an uncertainty that has been determined to be lower than 



 

47 
 

5×10
-2

 K. The pressure was generated and controlled using a Ruska 7610 pressure 

controller, whose pressure stability is 2 ×10
-3 

MPa. This device determines the vibration 

period of a metallic U-shape cell filled with the studied fluid, which is directly linked to 

the sample fluid density. The repeatability in the density values determined from the 

vibration period measured by the DMA 4500 unit is 10
-5

 g/cm
3
. The combinations of 

density determination repeatability and the accuracies in temperature and pressure 

measurement lead to an overall experimental density uncertainty value that is lower than 

10
-4

. 

 

3.2.1.3. GCVOL group contribution method 

GCVOL method is a group contribution method developed for the prediction of 

molar volumes of liquids. This method fractionates the molecule into various functional 

groups and then uses the molar volume of each group to estimate the density of the 

molecule according to the Eq. (3.2.1) where x is the molar fraction, Mw (g/mol) is the 

molecular weight and V (g/cm
3
) is the molar volume.

According to the parameters Ai, Bi, and Ci used the GCVOL method can be divided 

in three different versions: The original version uses the parameters reported by Elbro et al 

[141] The extended version uses the parameters reported by Ihmels et al [142] and the 

revised version uses new values for Ai, Bi and Ci for the double bond parameter (–CH=) 

that were estimated based on the density data for fatty acid esters reported in previous

works of ours [135, 136]. The parameters for other groups are equal to those of the original 

GCVOL. The parameters for the three versions of GCVOL method are presented in Table

3.2.1.4. Results and discussion 

Table 3.2.2 reports the FAME composition of the studied biodiesels. Palm 

biodiesel is the most saturated and the sunflower biodiesel the least. New experimental 

density data for eight biodiesels synthesized in this work and for two industrial biodiesels 

are reported in Table 3.2.3. For palm oil biodiesel, measurements were only carried at 

temperatures above its cloud point.

The experimental data show that the density of biodiesels decreases with increasing 

temperature and with the level of unsaturation of the FAMEs, as expected from previous 

works [135, 136] where the same behavior for pure compounds was observed. Pratas et al 

[128] used the experimental data to assess the ability of the GCVOL methods to predict 

atmospheric densities of biodiesel fuels. The results showed that the revised GCVOL 

method was the most adequate, presenting only an OARD of 0.17 % for ten biodiesel 

studied as seen in Table 3.2.4

that the extension to high pressures of the revised GCVOL method here proposed can 

provide excellent predictions of densities of different biodiesel fuels at high pressure.

3.2.2. Density of Ethylic Biodiesels 

 

 

Two sets of ethylic biodiesels were here studied. The first set includes 

biodiesels like EEAI (ethyl esters from Azadinachta indica), EEJC (ethyl esters 

from Jatropha oil), EEBA (ethyl esters from Balanites aegyptica) and EEWCO 

(ethyl esters from waste cooking oil). They were produced by Cosseron et al 

[144] at the University of Nancy. The second set includes soybean (S), 

sunflower (Sf), binary mixture of soybean with beef tallow (S+B) and palm (P). 

These were produced by Prof. Dr. Meirelles and his group at the University of 

Campinas in Brasil.  The measurement of density was done at our Laboratory. 

This section reports the prediction of density for these fuels using the revised 

GCVOL group contribution method that already predicted very well the 

density of methylic biodiesels.

3.2.2.1. Experimental Section 

The samples of EEAI (ethyl esters from Azadinachta indica), EEJC (ethyl esters 

from Jatropha oil), EEBA (ethyl esters from Balanites aegyptica) and EEWCO (ethyl 

esters from waste cooking oil) were produced in the LGRP Laboratory (Nancy, France) by 

Cosseron et al [144]. Shortly, they used alkali catalysed-transesterification reaction to 

convert the oils into biodiesels. The reaction was conducted in a 4-L jacked reactor made 

of borosilicate glass and equipped with a reflux condenser (operating conditions: 80 °C, 1 

wt % EtONa by weight of oil, stirring speed 250 rpm, ethanol :oil molar ratio 6:1). After 2 

h of reaction to ensure almost complete conversion of the oil (mass fraction in FAEE of the 

crude biodiesel obtained at this stage: 91.7 wt %, determined by GC-FID), the reactor was 

cooled and the two formed layers (a lower phase rich in glycerol and an upper-phase rich 

in FAEE) were separated by sedimentation and the latter underwent two stages of 

purification to concentrate the sample. The FAEE composition in biodiesel samples was 

here analysed again in gas chromatography following the same procedures described in 

previous section 3.2.1.  

The samples of soybean (S), sunflower (Sf) and palm (P) were produced by the 

transesterification of the corresponding oils with ethanol using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 

as the catalyst. The amount of NaOH used was 1.0 wt. % of the oil. Oil and ethanol with a 

mole ratio of 1:6 reacted at 323.15 K for 180 min. A fourth sample consisting of ethylic 

biodiesel derived from soybean oil and beef tallow (S+B) was supplied by Fertibom 

(Catanduva, SP, Brazil), a Brazilian company that produces ethylic biodiesel in industrial 

scale. The fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) compositions for all biodiesel samples were 

determined in triplicate by gas chromatography. The chromatographic analyses were 

carried out using a GC capillary gas chromatograph system (Agilent, 6850 Series GC 

System, Santa Clara, CA, USA) under the following experimental conditions: Elite 225 

capillary column (PERKIN ELMER, 50 % Cyanopropylphenyl-Phenylmethylpolysiloxane,

1.0 ?L. The fatty acid ethyl esters were identified by comparison with external standards 

purchased from Nu Check Prep (Elysian, MN, USA). Quantification was done by internal 

normalization.

The measurement of density was done in the temperature range of 288.15 to 368.15 

K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational 

Stabinger Viscometer following the same procedure described in Section 3.2.1.  

 

3.2.2.2. Results and discussion 

The FAEE compositions of the ethylic biodiesels are presented in Table 3.2.6

The experimental density and viscosity of the eight biodiesels here studied are 

presented in Table 3.2.7 where, as expected, the EEWCO biodiesel, being the highly 

unsaturated, has higher density than other samples while biodiesel P has lower density as it 

is more saturated than others.

The experimental data here measured were used to evaluate the revised GCVOL 

method. The model described very well the density of biodiesels here studied, presenting 

an OARD of only 0.51 % as shown in Table 3.2.8.  The adequacy of this model can also 

be seen in Figures 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 where the deviations are almost stable within the range 

of temperature studied with a maximum of 0.85 %.

3.2.3. Conclusions 

The high-pressure densities of ten methylic biodiesel fuels were here predicted with 

the revised GCVOL group contribution method. The prediction was excellent with and 

overall average relative deviations (OARD) of 0.37 %. Moreover the deviations over the 

temperature were almost stable with the maximum of 0.40 %. This model was also applied 

to predict the atmospheric densities of eight ethylic biodiesels and the prediction was good 

with and OARD of only 0.51 % and the deviations were stable with a maximum of only 

0.85 %. So the revised GCVOL method can be applied for all types of biodiesels since the 

compositions of fatty esters are known.

3.3. Modeling the viscosity of biodiesel fuels 

 

3.3.1.  Viscosity of methylic biodiesels 

 

 

 

The measurement of viscosity for seven biodiesel samples used in this work 

was done at our Laboratory by Dr. Maria Jorge Pratas. The modeling was 

done by me. The complete work is already published as paper in the journal of 

Energy &amp;amp; Fuels [128, 145]. So this section is an adapted version of the 

published paper.  



 

60

3.3.1.1. Introduction 

One of the major problems associated with biodiesel is that its viscosity may be 

higher than that for diesel fuel. A fuel of high viscosity tends to form larger droplets upon 

injection, leading to poorer atomization during the spray and creating operation problems, 

such as increased carbon deposits [146] and may enhance the polymerization reaction, 

especially for oils of a high degree of unsaturation [147]. It also leads to poor combustion 

and increased exhaust smoke and emissions, beyond the problems in cold weather because 

of the increase of viscosity with a decreasing temperature. On the other hand, a fuel with 

low viscosity may not provide sufficient lubrication for the precision fit of fuel injection 

pumps, resulting in leakage or increased wear [148]. 

Thus, the kinematic viscosity of biodiesel at 40 °C must be in the range of 3.5-5.0 

mm
2
/s according to EN-14214 specifications in Europe [107] and 1.9-6.0 mm

2
/s in 

accordance with American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-6751 

specifications in the USA [108], while the limit for diesel fuel is 2.0-4.5 mm
2
/s [148]. 

Nevertheless, in similarity to the feed oils, there is only few information about viscosity of 

biodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel mixtures over the whole composition range at 

different operational conditions of pressure and temperature.  

This work evaluated the predictive capabilities of three models developed by 

Ceriani et al.[149], Krisnangkura et al.[147] and Yuan et al.[150], respectively, for the 

estimation of the viscosity of several biodiesels and their blends with diesel fuels. A 

revised version of Yuan’s model was also proposed and evaluated. 

 

3.3.1.2. Samples and Viscosity measurement 

Seven of ten methylic biodiesel samples already reported in section 3.2.1 and an 

additional compound named B1 (methyl oleate of technical grade, 70 %) supplied by 

Sigma were here used. 

Measurements of viscosity were performed in the temperature range of 278.15-

363.15 K at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational 

Stabinger viscometer. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from 288.15 to 378.15 K. The 

relative uncertainty of the dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % for the standard 



 

62 
 

fluid SHL120 (SH Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. 

This viscometer was previously tested for other compounds and presented a very good 

reproducibility [151-153]. 

 

3.3.1.3. Viscosity Models 

The models described here are valid for the estimation of the viscosity of mixtures 

of fatty acid alkyl esters. The viscosities of biodiesel are calculated using the equation of 

Grunberg-Nissan, which is known to be the most suitable equation for computing the 

viscosity of liquid mixtures [146, 150]. Given that biodiesel fuels are non-associated 

liquids (i.e., they have essentially a dispersive interaction between the individual 

components), their dynamic viscosity can be estimated using the following equation: 

i

i

im
x ?? lnln ??       (3.3.1) 

Where ?i is the dynamic viscosity of an individual compound, ?m is the dynamic viscosity 

of the mixture, and xi is the mole fraction. 

 

3.3.1.3.1. Ceriani’s Model 

Ceriani et al.[149] proposed a model to predict the viscosity of fatty acid esters 

based on a group contribution method, i.e., a compound or a mixture of compounds is 

considered as a solution of groups, and its properties are the sum of the contributions of 

each group [149]. The model for the pure compounds is described in Eqs (3.3.2) - (3.3.4)

where Nk is the number of groups k in the molecule i, M is the component molecular 

weight that multiplies the “perturbation term”, A1k, B1k, C1k, D1k, A2k, B2k, C2k, and D2k are 

parameters obtained from the regression of the experimental data, k represents the groups 

of component i, Q is a correction term, f0, f1, s0, and s1 are optimized constants, ?, ?, ?, and 

? are optimized parameters obtained by regression of the databank as a whole, Nc is the 

total number of carbon atoms in the molecule, and Ncs is the number of carbons of the 

alcohol side chain. The parameter values were found by Ceriani et al [149]. 

 

3.3.1.3.2. Krisnangkura’s model 

Krisnangkura et al [147] fitted Eq. (3.3.5) to an experimental viscosity databank 

and provided a set of parameters for the description of the viscosity of pure fatty acid 

methyl esters (FAME) [147]. 

       (3.3.5) 

This equation was developed by considering the viscosity as the integral of the interaction 

forces of molecules. On the basis of this approach, the temperature dependency of the 

viscosity for short-chain methyl esters (C6-C12) can be estimated by Eq. (3.3.6) 

     (3.3.6) 

while for longer chain esters (C12:0?C18:0), the viscosity obeys Eq.(3.3.7). 

     (3.3.7) 

The viscosity of unsaturated FAME is estimated by Eqs. (3.3.8)-(3.3.11). 

       (3.3.8) 

       (3.3.9) 

       (3.3.10) 

       (3.3.11) 



 

64 
 

In all of these equations, ? is the kinematic viscosity expressed in mm
2
/s and T is the 

absolute temperature in kelvin. 

Because Krisnangkura’s model does not provide equations for several unsaturated 

FAME, such as C16:1, C20:0, C20:1, and C22:1, to predict the viscosity of biodiesel 

containing these compounds, it was necessary to resort to a pseudo-component approach, 

where the biodiesel composition was modified by adding C16:1 to C16:0, C20:0 and C20:1 

to C18:3, and C22:0 to C22:1. 

Beyond that, given that Krisnangkura’s model provides only kinematic viscosities, 

their conversion into dynamic viscosities was performed by considering the density data 

for pure FAME reported by Pratas et al [151, 152]. 

 

3.3.1.3.3. Yuan’s model 

Yuan et al [150] applied the Vogel-Tammann?Fulcher (VTF) equation to describe 

the viscosity-temperature relationship of pure FAME commonly present in biodiesel fuels 

       (3.3.12) 

and then to estimate the viscosity of biodiesel fuels based on their FAME composition 

through the mixture model. In Eq.(3.3.12), A, B, and T0 are parameters with values 

determined by fitting experimental viscosity data available and are reported by Yuan et al 

[150]. 

3.3.1.3.4. Revised Yuan’s model 

In previous works, Pratas et al [151, 152] reported new and more accurate data for 

the viscosities of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. Revised Yuan’s model consists of a 

version of Yuan’s model where the parameters of the VTF model were refitted to the new 

data. The new parameters for FAME are presented in Table 3.3.1.

3.3.1.4. Database of biodiesel viscosities 

Although values for the biodiesel viscosity are common in the literature, 

information concerning the biodiesel composition that is more detailed than the 

information about the oil used for the biodiesel synthesis is scarce. To apply the models 

studied here, detailed information about the biodiesel and/or diesel composition is 

required.  

The database for biodiesels used in this work was collected from the literature and 

supplemented with data for seven new biodiesels measured in our laboratory whose 

composition is detailed in Section 3.2. The compositions in terms of FAME of literature 

data are reported in Table 3.3.2. The biodiesels used in this study cover the most important 

oils used in biodiesel production, such as soy, palm, canola, rapeseed, and sunflower, but 

also other oils, such as cotton seed, coconut, and babassu, are relevant because of their 

singular compositions. In terms of FAME distributions, it addresses both oils rich in short-

chain and saturated fatty acids, such as coconut, rich in saturated fractions, such as palm, 

and rich in unsaturated compounds, such as soy and sunflower.

The viscosities of the seven biodiesel samples measured in this work as function of the 

temperature are reported in Table 3.3.4. The magnitude of the viscosities is in good 

agreement with other data previously reported in the literature for biodiesel produced from the 

same oils [147, 150, 154, 155].

The ARDs for each biodiesel and biodiesel blend studied are reported in Table 3.3.5, 

while the RDs of the individual data points for the 22 biodiesel samples are shown in Figures 

3.3.1 and 3.3.2. The results suggest that all of the models tend to underpredict the 

experimental viscosities. The predictions of Ceriani’s and Krisnangkura’s models (Figure 

3.3.1) are systematically larger than the Yuan-type models and temperature-dependent. Note, 

however, this dependency is opposite in the two cases: while Ceriani’s deviations tend to 

increase with the temperature, the reverse effect is observed for Krisnangkura’s model; i.e., 

the deviations are lower at the higher temperatures, where the viscosities have lower values. 

In both cases, the deviations at the temperature extremes tend to be very large (up to 25 %). 

The temperature dependency of Ceriani’s model seems to be related to the poor description of 

the viscosity of unsaturated fatty acid esters as discussed in previous works [151, 152]. A re-

estimation of the parameters for these compounds should allow for a better description of the 

experimental viscosities. The temperature dependency of the fatty acid esters is better 

described in large temperature ranges by a VTF equation as suggested by Yuan et al [150] 

than by the Arrhenius type adopted by Krisnangkura. The poor temperature dependency of 

this model is due to the equation used to describe the temperature dependency of the viscosity 

of the pure components of the mixture.

Figure 3.3.2 reveal that the RDs obtained with the two versions of Yuan’s model are 

temperature-independent and the maximum deviations observed are in general lower than 10 

%. They are thus more robust and reliable, producing suitable ARDs in comparison to other 

models available in the literature. In numbers, both Ceriani’s and Krisnangkura’s models have 

global ARDs around 8.0 %, Yuan’s original model has ARDs of 5.3 %, and the revised 

version of Yuan’s model proposed here has ARDs of just 4.7 % that must be close to the 

experimental uncertainty of many of the experimental data. 

The prediction of the viscosities of mixtures of biodiesel with petroleum diesel was 

also studied here by using eq.3.3.1, where the biodiesel viscosity is estimated using the 

models studied here, and the petroleum diesel viscosity used was the experimental value 

(Figures 3.3.3 and 3.3.4). The RDs are reported in Table 3.3.6. It was found that the 

deviations observed for the individual mixtures and the global deviations are in good 

agreement with those observed for the pure biodiesel, showing that their predictive 

capabilities of the approach used here is not affected by the presence of hydrocarbons in the 

mixture. Ceriani’s model shows an overall deviation of 6.5 %, and Yuan’s and 

Krisnangkura’s models presented 5.6 and 7.1 %, respectively, while revised Yuan’s model 

had the lowest global deviation of just 5.2 %, suggesting that the Yuan-type models are also 

suitable to predict the viscosity data of biodiesel blends with petrodiesel.

3.3.2. Viscosity of ethylic biodiesels 

  

 

 

 

The two sets of ethylic biodiesels already described in Section 3.2 are here 

used again to test the ability of the revised Yuan’s model for predicting the 

viscosity of ethylic biodiesels.  



 

77 
 

3.3.2.1. Experimental section 

The eight samples of ethylic biodiesels described in section 3.2 are here used again 

to study the viscosity. The measurement of viscosity was done in the temperature range of 

288.15 to 368.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar 

rotational Stabinger Viscometer following the same procedure described in Section 3.2.  

 

3.3.2.2. Results and discussion 

Similarly to the methylic biodiesels, the viscosity parameters of FAEE were used to 

describe the viscosity of ethylic biodiesels. The VTF parameters for the revised Yuan’s 

model are presented in Table 3.3.7. Because there were no parameters for several FAEE, 

to predict the viscosity of biodiesel containing these compounds, it was necessary to resort 

to a pseudo-component approach, where the biodiesel composition was modified by adding 

C16:1 to C16:0 and C20:1, C22:0, C22:1 and C24:0 to C20:0.

The experimental viscosities of the eight biodiesels here studied are presented in 

Table 3.3.8 where, with the exception of EEWCO, the viscosity of other biodiesels 

decreases with the level of unsaturation as expected.

The experimental data here measured were used to evaluate the revised Yuan’s 

model. This model described acceptably the viscosity of biodiesels, presenting an OARD 

of only 7.5 %. Except the EEWCO and EEAI samples, the results were satisfactory for 

other samples as shown in Table 3.3.9.  The high deviation of EEWCO may due to the low 

conversion of oil to biodiesel or to the degradation of the sample. The adequacy of this 

model can be also seen in Figures 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 where the deviations are large at low 

temperatures but tend to lower and be stable at high temperatures.

3.3.3. Conclusions 

 

Viscosity data for seven well-characterized methylic biodiesel samples in terms of 

their FAME composition were measured and reported. Along with a database compiled 

from the literature, they were used to evaluate four models able to predict biodiesel 

viscosities based on information of their FAME compositions. It is shown that, although all 

of the models studied are able to predict the viscosities of both pure biodiesels and blends 

of biodiesel with petrodiesel with less than 10 % deviation in general, the models of 

Krisnangkura et al [147] and Ceriani et al [149] present deviations that are temperature-

dependent and that, at the extremes of the temperature range studied, can have deviations 

as high as 25 %. The deviations presented by the Yuan-type models are more robust over 

temperature and also lower than those obtained with the two previous models. In 

particular, the revised version of Yuan’s model proposed here on the basis of new and 

more accurate data for the FAME produces predictions with uncertainties that are close to 

the experimental uncertainties of the experimental data and can thus be an interesting tool 

to the design of biofuels or biofuel blends with viscosities that comply with legal 

specifications. 

The Revised Yuan’s model was used also to predict the viscosity of eight ethylic 

biodiesels and the results were acceptable with and overall average relative deviations 

(OARD) of 7. 5 %. Moreover the deviations tend to be stable at high temperatures.

3.4. Measurement and Prediction of biodiesel volatility 

 

 

 

 

This work is also already published as a paper in the journal of Energy &amp;amp; 

Fuels [159]. This section is again an adapted version of the published paper. 

Just to underline that the samples used in this section were those produced by 

Dr. Maria Jorge. The experimental measurement and also the modeling of 

vapor pressure of biodiesels were done by me.   

 

  



 

82 
 



 

83 
 

3.4.1. Introduction 

Vapor pressures (and boiling points) express the volatility, safety, and stability of a 

fuel. Higher value of this property favors the evaporative emissions while lower value 

leads to delayed ignition, poor atomization, and problematic combustion. Biodiesel fuels 

have lower vapor pressure and, thus, might cause these problems. To be used in diesel 

engines, this property must be adjusted by changing the composition of biodiesel to meet 

the standard values. For this purpose, because the experimental measurement is 

impractical, the use of predictive models is recommended. Many works in the literature 

have dealt with the measurement and estimation of vapor pressures for several methyl 

esters and biodiesels [160-166], but almost none of them described with detail their 

dependency upon the composition of fatty acid alkyl esters. 

This work aims at reporting the experimental data of vapor pressures for 3 pure 

methyl esters and 10 biodiesel fuels and evaluating the predictive ability of Yuan’s, 

Ceriani’s, and CPA EoS models for their description. 

 

3.4.2. Experimental Section: samples and measurement procedure 

The three methyl esters here studied were methyl laurate (with 97 % of purity from 

Fluka), methyl myristate (with 98 % of purity from SAFC) and methyl palmitate (with 97 

% from SAFC). The ten biodiesel fuels addressed in Section 3.2 are here studied again.  

The measurement of vapor pressures was done using an ebulliometer previously 

used by us to study glycerol containing systems [28]. The ebulliometer was composed of a 

boiling still with a port for liquid sampling/injection and a condenser. A thermostatic bath 

was used to control the temperature. The pressure was kept constant trough a vacuum line 

with a calibrated Baratron Heated Capacitance Manometer 728AMKS, with an accuracy of 

0.50 %. Circa 20 mL of the sample were used for the measurement. This sample was 

always mixed with a magnetic stirrer and heated to its boiling point. The temperature was 

measured using a calibrated Pt100 temperature sensor with an uncertainty of 0.05 K. The 

measurement of boiling points was carried from 0.026 to 0.250 bar with an uncertainty of 

± 0.25 ºC.  

 



 

84 
 

3.4.3. Models of vapor pressure 

The vapor pressures or boiling points of the biodiesel fuels here studied were 

predicted by using three different approaches: Yuan´s, Ceriani’s and CPA’s model. 

 

3.4.3.1. Yuan’s model 

Yuan et al [161] fitted the Antoine equation (Eq. (3.4.1)) to the experimental data 

of vapor pressures for several pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) that compose the 

biodiesel fuels reported in the works of Rose et al [160] and Scott et al [162].

compound was added to C16:0. The nomenclature for esters here adopted is based on the 

fatty acid chain length where Cx:y ester represents the methyl ester of fatty acid with x 

carbons and y unsaturations. 

3.4.3.2. Ceriani’s model 

Ceriani and co-workers have proposed a number of group-contribution models for 

estimating the thermophysical properties of fatty compounds. and among these one for the 

vapor pressures [164]. The modeling of viscosity with this model is already described in 

Section 3.3. The model for predicting vapor pressures is shown in Eq. (3.4.3) and (3.4.4)

3.4.3.3. CPA EoS 

Recently the Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) has been 

extended for application in biodiesel production and purification. It was applied to describe 

the liquid-liquid, the vapor-liquid and the solid-liquid equilibria of binary and 

multicomponent systems containing fatty acids, fatty acid esters, water, short alcohols and 

glycerol [167]. Lately, it successfully described densities at high pressures [140] and 

surface tensions [135] for the same biodiesels studied in this work.  

This equation of state has been extensively described on the above stated 

publications and therefore it will be shortly addressed here. It consists on the combination 

of a cubic contribution, in this work the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), with the Wertheim 

term in order to explicitly take into account interactions between like molecules (self-

association) and different molecules (cross-association) [168-170].  

Since biodiesels are composed of fatty acid esters, which are known not to self-

associate, the association term disappears. In terms of the compressibility factor the CPA 

EoS appears as:

The three pure component parameters in the cubic term (a0, c1 and b) are regressed

3.4.3.4. Evaluation of models 

The predictive ability of the models aforementioned was evaluated by simply 

calculating the average relative deviations (ARDs) using Eqs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 or the average

(Eq. (3.4.8)).

3.4.4. Results and Discussion 

The experimental vapor pressures for three pure methyl esters and ten biodiesel 

fuels measured at different temperatures are presented in Tables 3.4.1 to 3.4.3. The upper 

temperature limit of the measurements, circa 550 K, is imposed by the degradation of the 

biodiesel at higher temperatures under the measurement conditions.

The experimental data of vapor pressure for the three pure methyl esters here 

measured were compared to those previously reported in the literature [160, 165] and they 

were found to be in acceptable agreement with an average deviation of 1.7 % for C12:0, 

3.5 % for C14:0 and 1.6 % for C16:0 as shown in Figure 3.4.1. As expected, the vapor 

pressures are lower (boiling points higher) for the long chain fatty acid esters and thus for 

biodiesels with larger amounts of these esters in their composition. For example, the palm 

biodiesel presented a higher vapor pressure than rapeseed biodiesel as the first has a higher 

percentage of C16:0 and the second is richer in C18:1.

The CPA pure-compound parameters for the FAME that compose the biodiesels

pressure densities [140]  and surface tensions [135] of the selected biodiesels. However, 

when extrapolated for the temperature range of interest for this work, 450–600 K, poor 

predictions were obtained for the biodiesel vapor pressures. Consequently, a new set of 

CPA pure-compound parameters for the FAME composing the biodiesels studied is 

proposed here for applications at high temperatures. The recent density data by Pratas et al 

[140] and vapor pressures by Yuan et al [161] were used in a simultaneous regression for 

parameter estimation. Critical properties to be applied in eq. 3.4.6 were generated by the 

Wilson and Jasperson [171] group-contribution model for the saturated FAME and by 

Ambrose [172] for the unsaturated FAME. These group-contribution models were shown 

previously to be the best models to calculate critical properties for the correspondent 

family of compounds [173]. Parameter values are presented in Table 3.4.5, as well as 

critical temperature values and deviations in vapor pressures and liquid densities.

Higher density errors for C10:0 and C12:0 were obtained, which can be related to 

the extrapolation for high temperatures of the density–temperature relations proposed in 

reference [140], which seem to provide poorer density descriptions at high temperatures 

for these smaller compounds. However, an excellent vapor pressure description, of 

relevance for this work, is assured, as seen in Table 3.4.6. Subsequently, the good vapor 

pressure description of biodiesels rich in C10:0 or C12:0 is guaranteed.

Because there were no data of the vapor pressure for methyl palmitoleate (C16:1), 

the parameters of the CPA EoS used for this compound were the same as those of methyl 

palmitate (C16:0). In terms of ARDs on the vapor pressures, Yuan’s and CPA EoS models 

were shown to be better than Ceriani’s model by presenting an OARD of only 3.4 and 0.80 

%, respectively, compared to 9.9 % of the latter, as shown in Table 3.4.6. Even for the 

pure FAME, Ceriani’s model shows large deviations in the range of pressures studied.

Similar results are observed for the boiling points when estimating the average 

temperature deviations (?Tm) or its overall value (O?Tm). Yuan’s and CPA EoS models 

describe the experimental data of the boiling points in the range of pressures studied with 

only 1.12 and 1.25 K of overall average temperature deviation (O?Tm), respectively, 

compared to 4.01 K of Ceriani’s model, as shown in Table 3.4.7. The predicted boiling 

points of biodiesel fuels were plotted against the experimental data in Figure 3.4.2, where 

Yuan’s and CPA EoS models show a very good agreement with the experimental data, 

while Ceriani’s model presents larger deviations at high temperatures in the range of 

pressures studied, overpredicting boiling points.

3.4.5. Conclusions 

The boiling points of ten biodiesel fuels, three methyl esters and one binary mixture 

of methyl esters were measured and predicted by three different approaches: Yuan’s, 

Ceriani´s and the CPA EoS models. It is shown that Yuan’s and CPA EoS models provide 

a good description of the experimental data with only 1.12 and 1.25 K of overall average 

temperature difference (O?Tm) in boiling temperatures and 3.41 and 0.80 % in vapor 

pressures. In addition, a new set of CPA EoS pure compound parameters for fatty acid 

methyl esters for applications at high temperatures are proposed.

3.5. Measurement and prediction of biodiesel surface tensions 

 

 

 

 

This work is also published as an article in the journal of Energy &amp;amp; Fuels [135]. 

So this section is an adapted version of the published paper. Note that the 

biodiesel samples used here were the same used in earlier sections. The 

experimental measurement and the modeling of surface tension were done by 

me. The modeling with the CPA EoS was done by Dr. Mariana Belo.

3.5.1. Introduction 

Surface tension influences fuel atomization, i.e., the first stage of combustion [37]. 

A correct atomization permits proper mixing and complete combustion in an injection 

engine, reducing emissions and increasing the engine efficiency [174]. Higher surface 

tensions make the drop formation difficult, leading to an inefficient fuel atomization [174]. 

Furthermore, just like most biodiesel properties, surface tension increases with long fatty 

acid hydrocarbon chains and a level of unsaturated bonds [175], i.e., more unsaturated 

biodiesel fuels will present a higher surface tension. Thus, being able to predict this 

physical property for biodiesels for which composition on fatty acid esters is known makes 

it possible to optimize biodiesel production and blending processes, with the final aim of 

improving the fuel performance in the engine, particularly during atomization. 

There is, however, a lack of information concerning surface tensions of biodiesels 

or fatty acid esters from which biodiesels are composed, and when available, the data are 

limited to a single temperature [175, 176]. To overcome that lack of data, this work 

provides experimental surface tension data for ten different biodiesel fuels. The 

experimental data were acquired at temperatures from 303.15 to 353.15 K. The data were 

used to test two surface tension predictive models: the parachor-based MacLeod-Sugden 

equation and the density gradient theory based on the CPA EoS. 

3.5.2. Experimental Section 

Ten biodiesel fuels reported in Section 3.2 were here used again to study the surface 

tensions. The detailed compositions of these biodiesels are already reported in Table 3.2.1 

[128]. 

The measurement of the surface tension of the biodiesel samples was carried out 

using a Nima Dynamic Surface Tensiometer, model DST9005, previously used for studies 

of hydrocarbon mixtures [177-179] and ionic liquids [180-182]. This is a sophisticated 

computer controlled instrument that measures and records the forces that biodiesel exerts 

to withstand the external force provoked by the immersion of the Pt/Ir Du Noüy ring in the 

liquid. A Haake F6 bath circulator, equipped with a Pt100 probe, was connected to the 

tensiometer to guarantee that measurements occurred within an uncertainty of ± 0.01 K. 

The ring was always cleaned before each measurement in a butane flame. The 



 

98 
 

measurement was carried from 303.15 to 353.15 K for all biodiesel fuels. For each sample 

at least five sets of three immersion/detachment cycles were measured, providing a 

minimum of at least 15 surface tension values, allowing the determination of an average 

surface tension value for each temperature. To correct the meniscus formed by the Noüy 

ring, the liquid densities of the biodiesels reported in a previous work [128] were 

introduced before measuring the surface tension. 

3.5.3. Prediction of biodiesel surface tensions 

The surface tensions of the biodiesel fuels studied here were predicted using two 

different predictive approaches: the parachor-based MacLeod-Sugden equation with the 

parachors proposed by Allen et al [176] and Knotts et al [183] and the density gradient 

theory (GT) based on the CPA EoS [184-186] as shown in Table 3.5.1.

To use the gradient theory, it is necessary to determine the equilibrium densities of 

the coexisting phases, the chemical potentials and the Helmholtz energy using an adequate 

model. For these purposes, the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) will be 

used in this work. 

The CPA EoS was chosen since it presents several advantages over conventional 

cubic equations and other association models. The CPA EoS allows an accurate description 

of saturated liquid densities without any need for a volume correction, in contrast to what 



 

100 
 

succeeds with traditional cubic EoS, and is also mathematically simpler than other 

association equations of state such as SAFT. Considering biodiesel industry related 

systems, of interest for this work, it was previously shown that the CPA EoS is the most 

adequate model to describe the phase equilibria of different systems appearing during the 

biodiesel production, purification and use, that are characterized by containing polar 

compounds with strong associative interactions, taking into account its accuracy, range of 

applicability, simplicity, and predictive character [28, 184, 189-192]. 

In the current work, the CPA EoS model combines a cubic contribution from the 

Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EoS with an association contribution, originally proposed by 

Wertheim [168-170]. Using a generalized cubic term (for the SRK approach with ?1 and ?2 

equal to 0), the cubic and association contributions to the Helmholtz energy (A) are given 

by Eqs 3.5.6 and 3.5.7 [193].

Esters are non-self-associating compounds, and therefore, there are only three pure 

compound parameters, the parameters of the physical part (a0, c1, and b), to be regressed 

simultaneously from vapor pressure and liquid density data. The CPA pure compound 

parameters for several ester families were already estimated in previous works [140, 189].

3.5.4. Results and Discussion 

The experimental surface tensions for the ten biodiesel fuels here studied and the 

corresponding standard deviations are reported in Table 3.5.2. As expected, this property 

decreases with increasing temperature and generally also with the level of unsaturation of 

the FAME constituting the biodiesel, i.e., at the same temperature, the rapeseed and the 

sunflower biodiesel fuels present the higher surface tensions and the soy type biodiesel the 

lower surface tension.

) Standard deviation 

Given the scarcity of surface tension data for biodiesel fuels, it was only possible to 

compare the surface tension data for the soybean and palm biodiesel fuels with those 

measured by Allen et al [176] at 313.15 K. It is shown that our data are circa 6 % higher 

than Allen’s data for this temperature. Although the comparison of only one point is not 

very conclusive, this error is acceptable given the differences in composition between the 

biodiesel fuels.  

Using the parachors suggested by Allen et al [176], the predictions of surface 

tensions by the MacLeod-Sugden equation overestimate the experimental data within a 10 

% deviation (OARD of 7.7 %) as shown in Figures 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. This approach 

provides better predictions of surface tension when the parachors suggested by Knotts et al 

[183] are used as seen in Figures 3.5.3 and 3.5.4. An OARD of 1.3 % is obtained with this 

model that is not much higher than the experimental uncertainty of the data. A very good 



 

102 
 

description of the temperature dependency of the experimental data is achieved using this 

approach, as the RDs obtained for the two version of this model, shown in Figures 3.5.2 

and 3.5.4, are almost temperature-independent. The average relative deviations (ARD) for 

the ten biodiesels studied are presented in Table 3.5.3. The reported results show the good 

predictive capacity of parachors through the MacLeod-Sugden equation to compute surface 

tensions of biodiesel fuels, in particular when the Knotts et al [183] parachors are used

The gradient theory coupled with the CPA EoS was previously used for the 

description of the surface tensions of a series of esters, with 37 ester compounds evaluated, 

including formates, acetates, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and unsaturated methyl esters 

[185]. As discussed above, the influence parameter definition is too complex to be easily 

implemented, and alternatively, influence parameters are adjusted from surface tension 

data and plotted (far from the critical point) using the energy and co-volume parameters of 

the physical part of the CPA EoS (as c/ab

showed in a previous work [185] that, for esters, the influence parameter dependency with 

the temperature is linear up to a Tr of about 0.70, and consequently, a linear approach for 

the influence parameter temperature dependence was considered, resulting in only two 

parameters to be correlated.

Furthermore, plotting the parameters of the linear equation against the acentric 

factor it was seen that these parameters don’t vary significantly, and average values were 

estimated for D and E, aiming at using this approach in a predictive way, to estimate 

surface tensions for biodiesels. For this work D×10

= 0.6177 and E×10

= -0.4425 [185]. 

Using these assumptions, the density gradient theory coupled with the CPA Eos 

was used to predict the ten measured biodiesels surface tension data. The surface tensions 

are in general underpredicted and within a 10 % deviation from the reported experimental 

data, as shown in Figure 3.5.5. The RDs are almost temperature-independent, as reported 

in Figure 3.5.6, showing that the temperature dependency of the experimental data is 

correctly described. The average relative deviations (ARD) for the ten biodiesels studied 

are presented in Table 3.5.3, and an overall value (OARD) of 9.7 % was achieved.

These results are remarkable because the modeling of biodiesels with the gradient 

theory is considerably more difficult (and predictive) than for pure esters, because density 

profiles have to be calculated at each discrete point of the dividing interface limited by the 

upper and lower phase densities [187]. From the presented results, it is possible to 

conclude that the coupling of the gradient theory with the CPA EoS provides a more 

complex yet appealing approach to predict surface tensions of biodiesels, allowing for a 

simultaneous description of the surface tensions and phase equilibria, using constant 

parameters for the linear temperature dependence of the ester influence parameters. 

Additionally, it does not require the a priori knowledge of the liquid-phase densities, as 

occurs with the parachor models. 

The surface thermodynamics properties namely surface entropy that corresponds to 

the slope of the curve of the measured surface tension data as a function of temperature, 

and surface enthalpy were also determined by using the eqs. (3.5.10) and (3.5.11).

3.5.5. Conclusions 

Surface tensions of ten biodiesel fuels were measured at temperatures from 303.15 

to 353.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. 

Two different modeling approaches were used to predict the experimental data: the 

MacLeod-Sugden equation with two different parachor sets and the density gradient theory 

coupled with the CPA EoS. The first method presented an OARD of 7.7 % when using the 

Allen’s parachors and of 1.3 % with Knotts’ parachors, showing that a simple and 

empirical method, based on parachors, can be applied to predict, from the composition, the 

temperature dependence of the biodiesel surface tensions. 

Using constant parameters for the linear temperature dependence of the influence 

parameter for all the fatty acid esters constituting the different biodiesels, the gradient 



 

108 
 

theory in combination with the CPA EoS was shown to predict biodiesels surface tensions 

with an OARD of 9.7 %, while also providing information concerning the phase equilibria 

of the biodiesel systems. 

These results clearly show that, provided that the biodiesel FAME composition is 

known, the predictive methods here investigated here can be used to predict surface 

tensions of biodiesel fuels in a wide range of temperatures.

3.6. Measurement and Prediction of Speed of Sound 

 

 

 

 

As there was no equipment for measuring speeds of sound at the University of 

Aveiro, the samples here studied were analysed by our collaborators in other 

universities. The atmospheric speeds of sound of methyl esters and methylic 

biodiesels were measured in Brasil by Prof. Dr. Márcio L.L. Paredes and his 

group at the UERJ. The atmospheric speeds of sound of ethyl esters and ethylic 

biodiesels were measured at the University of Lisboa by Dr. Ângela Santos and 

her group. The methylic biodiesels were produced by Dr. Maria Jorge while the 

ethylic biodiesels were produced by Prof. Dr. Meirelles and his group at the 

University of Campinas in Brasil. This section is an adapted version of the three 

articles published in the journals of Energy &amp;amp; Fuels and Fuel [196-198].

3.6.1. Introduction 

Isentropic bulk modulus and speed of sound are the two properties with important 

impacts on the injection process of a fuel. While the first measures the compressibility of 

the fuel under pressure, i.e., it affects the amount of pressure rise that will occur from the 

fuel pump pulse, the second affects the time required for the pressure rise to proceed 

through the fuel line and reach the injector. In comparison to petroleum fuel, biodiesel has 

higher values of both properties. A higher isentropic bulk modulus and higher speed of 

sound would cause an earlier injection of fuel and also an earlier combustion, which raises 

peak in-cylinder temperature, thereby increasing thermal NOx formation [199] namely for 

injectors activated with pressure [176, 200, 201]. Thus the bulk modulus and speed of 

sound values are relevant for system modeling and experimental injection rate 

determination [202]. They are important for the study of the injection rate, injection timing, 

injection duration, injection pressure, start of combustion, in-cylinder gas pressure and 

temperature and heat release rate that influence the final NOx emissions [203]. 

In case of speed of sound, just like any other thermophysical properties, its 

magnitude is influenced by the structure of the fatty acid alkyl esters that compose 

biodiesel fuels such as chain length, branching and level of unsaturation [204]. Thus the 

knowledge of the relationship between the biodiesel properties and the percentage of fatty 

esters in biodiesels is of great importance. 

 Unfortunately there are not so many data available in the literature for fatty acid 

methyl esters (FAME) [196, 201, 205-210], being the experimental speeds of sound of 

fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) even more scant [211], although some studies were already 

done for the shorter methyl and ethyl esters [212]. The oldest experimental data of the 

speed of sound include those reported by Gouw et al [206] at 20 and 40 °C for methyl 

esters and by Tat et al [208] for biodiesel fuels at pressures from atmospheric to 35 MPa. 

Later, these authors also proposed correlations to estimate the speeds of sound of alkyl 

monoesters at higher temperatures and pressures[201]. Ott et al [210] provided the speeds 

of sound for five methyl esters as a function of the temperature at 83 kPa. Recently, some 

experimental data were reported by Huber et al [213] for two commercial biodiesels and 

by Kumar et al [214] for Jatropha curcas biodiesel at atmospheric pressure. Daridon et al 

[211] provided experimental data for several pure fatty acid esters at atmospheric pressure 

and temperatures from 283.15 to 373.15 K and published [215] high-pressure speeds of 



 

112 
 

sound for methyl caprate and ethyl caprate. This work provides new experimental data of 

speed of sound for several fatty esters and biodiesel fuels measured at different 

temperature and pressure and then using them to evaluate the predictive ability of several 

methods.  

 

3.6.2. Experimental Details: samples and measurement procedures 

 

3.6.2.1. Speed of Sound of FAME and methylic biodiesels 

The eight methyl esters here studied were methyl laurate (with 97 % of purity from 

Fluka), methyl myristate (with 98 % of purity from SAFC) and Methyl Oleate (with 99 % 

from Aldrich), methyl caprylate, (with 99 % purity from Sigma-Aldrich); methyl caprate, 

(with 99 % purity from Fluka); methyl palmitate, (with 99 % purity from Sigma-Aldrich); 

methyl stearate, (with 99 % purity from Fluka) and methyl linoleate, (with 99 % purity 

from Sigma-Aldrich). The ten methylic biodiesel fuels reported by Pratas et al [128] and 

addressed in Section 3.2 are here used again to study the speed of sound.  

The density and speed of sound were obtained using an automatic digital 

densimeter (Anton Paar DSA 5000). DSA 5000 simultaneously determines two physically 

independent properties within one sample. The instrument is equipped with a density cell 

and a sound velocity cell combining the known oscillating U-tube method with a highly 

accurate measurement of the speed of sound [216]. The density and speed of sound meter 

was calibrated against ultrapure water and air at atmospheric pressure. The calibration was 

accepted if the measurements were estimated to be within ± 2 × 10
-3

 kg/m
3
 and ± 0.02 m/s 

of the reference values, respectively. The measurements were obtained in duplicates, and 

the standard experimental uncertainty was obtained by dividing the modulus of the 

repeatability differences by the square of two. The value obtained was 0.23 m/s for 142 

repetition points [216]. The estimated standard uncertainties in density and speed of sound 

measurements are 2 × 10
–2

 kg/m
3
 and 0.1 m/s

1
, respectively. The standard uncertainty in 

the temperature is 0.01 K. 



 

113 
 

3.6.2.2. Speed of Sound of FAEE and ethylic biodiesels 

The nine ethyl esters here studied were ethyl butyrate (98% quoted purity from 

Fluka), ethyl caprylate (&gt;99 % quoted purity from Aldrich), ethyl caprate (99 % quoted 

purity from Fluka), ethyl laurate (99 % quoted purity from Sigma), ethyl myristate (99 % 

quoted purity from Aldrich), ethyl palmitate (&gt;99 % quoted purity from Sigma), ethyl 

stearate (&gt;99% quoted purity from Fluka), ethyl oleate (&gt;98 % quoted purity from 

Aldrich), ethyl linoleate (&gt;99 % quoted purity from Sigma). These compounds were used 

as received without any further purification. The four biodiesel fuels here used (S, Sf, S+B 

and P) are already described in Section 3.2.  

Experimental measurements of density and speed of sound were made concurrently 

using an Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter and ultrasound speed meter, model DSA 

5000 M, with an automatic temperature control within ±0.01 K. All measurements were 

made at ambient pressure. According to the procedure already described elsewhere [217], 

calibration of the speed of sound cell was made with degassed Millipore ultra-quality 

water. Measurement and comparison with literature values of speed of sound of toluene 

and cyclohexane at 25 °C leads us to assume an accuracy of 0.5 m/s, as claimed by the 

manufacturer. In the case of density, besides the usual method recommended by the 

manufacturer of using dry air and degassed ultra-pure water at 293.15 K as reference 

fluids, a new calibration procedure thoroughly described elsewhere [218] was performed. 

The calibrants used were ultra-pure water and dodecane with certified density values 

issued by H§D Fitzgerald, with expanded uncertainties of 0.01 kg/m
3
 (coverage factor 

k = 2, providing a 95 % level of confidence). The use of this pair of calibrating fluids 

allowed a close bracketing of the densities measured, the importance of which has recently 

been emphasized by Fortin et al [219] As the temperature range of certified density values 

for dodecane does not cover values higher than 323.15 K, an extrapolation of those values 

had to be made. However, a careful analysis of results based on comparison between direct 

density values (taken from direct readings of the densimeter) and final values obtained 

from the calibration procedure allowed a reassurance about the validity of that 

extrapolation. 

Every day before starting the measurements, the usual routine procedure of 

performing a water and air check was invariably adopted. Before injection all samples 



 

114 
 

were pre-heated, and degassed, at the maximum experimental temperature. Then, for the 

same single sample injection a complete series of measurements was made, decreasing the 

temperature from 343.15 K to 293.15 K in decrements of 5 K. At each temperature three to 

seven data readings were taken and some measurements were repeated with a new 

injection, allowing asserting an estimate for the repeatability and standard uncertainty for 

density values lower than 0.0006 % and 0.005 %, respectively, and for speed of sound of 

0.01 % and 0.02 %, respectively. After each set of measurements the instrument was 

flushed several times with n-heptane at 333 K and with acetone at 313 K, sequentially, and 

then dried at 343 K during at least 1 h, with a stream of forced room air. To assess the 

effectiveness of these cleaning actions, new air and water checks were done and whenever 

deviations higher than 0.002 % for density and 0.013 % for sound speed were found, a new 

cycle of cleaning steps was executed. 

 

3.6.3. Models for speed of sound 

The description of speed of sound for fatty esters (FAME and FAEE) and biodiesel 

fuels was done by using the Auerbach’s relation, linear mixing rule and the Wada’s group 

contribution method as individually described bellow.  

 

3.6.3.1. Auerbach’s model 

The Auerbach’s model [143, 220] is represented by Eq. (3.6.1), where u is the 

speed of sound in m/s, ?  is the surface tension in N/m and ? is the density in kg/m
3
. Since 

this equation requires the prior knowledge of densities and surface tensions, this work uses 

the data reported in our previous works [128, 135].

relaxing the value of the constant c1 of Eq. (3.6.2).

3.6.3.2. Ideal Mixture Mixing Rules  

 

As biodiesel fuels are a mixture of FAME (or FAEE) of similar molecular weight, 

their speeds of sound can be estimated using a mixing rule assuming an ideal mixture 

behavior. This approach, described by Eq. (3.6.3), will be here used to describe the speed 

of sound of biodiesels, where uBD is the speed of sound of biodiesel in m/s, xi is the molar 

composition and ui is the speed of sound of individual fatty esters in m/s.

To calculate the speed of sound of methylic and ethylic biodiesels some approaches 

have to be done especially when there are no data for some esters. So for methylic 

biodiesels, due to lack of experimental data of speed of sound for some minoritary FAME 

compounds, such as C10:0, C16:1, C20:0, C20:1, C22:0, C22:1 and C24:0, the pseudo-

component concept was adopted by adding C10:0 to C12:0, C16:1 to C16:0 and C20:0, 

C22:0 and C24:0 to C18:0 and C20:1 and C22:1 to C18:3. In this work the experimental 

speed of sound for the methyl esters used, with their respective purities, was that reported 

by Tat et al [201] except for C14:0 measured in this work. This methyl ester has 98 % of 

purity.  

The same procedure is valid for the ethylic biodiesels, i.e., since there are no 

experimental data of speed of sound for some of the less common FAEE, to use the mixing 

rules, a pseudo-component approach is used by adding C16:1 to C16:0 and C20:1, C22:0 

and C24:0 to C20:0. The nomenclature for esters here adopted is based on the fatty acid 

chain length.  

 

3.6.3.3. Wada’s Group Contribution Method 

The Wada’s Group Contribution Method was previously proposed by Daridon et al 

[211] to predict the speed of sound of alkyl esters. This model simply relates speed of 



 

116 
 

sound (u in m/s) with density (? in kg/m
3
), molecular mass (Mw in g/mol) and molecular 

compressibility (?m) according to the following equation:

         (3.6.4) 

The molecular compressibility (?m) is also known as Wada’s constant and its value can 

easily be decomposed in groups [211] allowing for the establishment of a group 

contribution model as presented in the following equation:

        (3.6.5) 

Where Km,j connotes the Wada’s constant of the group j which occurs Nj times in the given 

molecule and ? is a constant parameter used to take into account the influence of 

temperature. 

To carry out the predictions of speed of sound using the Wada’s model, the ester 

molecule must be split into five main groups: -CH3- and -CH2- to account the linear and 

saturated alkyl chain, -CH CH- to describe the contribution of the unsaturation of the 

alkyl chain and -CH3COO- and -CH2COO- to take into account the ester contribution from 

methyl and ethyl esters, respectively. Then the corresponding Wada’s constants reported in 

Daridon et al [211], are used to estimate the speed of sound for each ethyl ester in the 

range of temperatures investigated. 

For biodiesels, the application of Wada’s model can be carried using two different 

approaches. The first approach (Wada 1) follows exactly the method described above, i.e., 

splits the biodiesel molecules into the main groups aforementioned, whose Wada’s 

constants are already known, then predicts their speeds of sound using either the 

experimental or predicted densities of biodiesels using a linear mixing rule of the densities 

of the pure fatty acid esters as the two approaches present only ca. 0.1 % of difference. The 

second approach (Wada 2) consists of using a linear mixing rule to predict the speed of 

sound of biodiesels from that of their pure constituents (fatty esters) according to Eq. 

(3.6.1), but with the speed of sound of pure esters (ui) predicted with the Wada’s model. 



 

117 
 

For this approach the estimation of the densities for pure FAEE were the same as those 

used in Wada 1. 

 

3.6.4. Results and discussion 

 

3.6.4.1. Speed of sound of FAME and methylic biodiesels 

The experimental data of speed of sound for eight pure methyl esters and ten 

biodiesels here studied are reported in Tables 3.6.1 to 3.6.2. The experimental data of 

speed of sound for the methyl esters here measured were compared to those reported in the 

literature [201, 206, 210, 211]. The results show a good agreement between the 

experimental and literature data, presenting only deviations within ± 1 % of literature data 

as seen in Figures 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, except for methyl palmitate reported by Tat et al [201] 

with a sample of questionable purity. At the same conditions, the speed of sound for 

methyl linoleate is thus higher than that of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate, as seen in 

Table 3.6.1. These results in biodiesels with a high level of saturated short-chain 

compounds, such as those based on palm [196] or coconut oil, present lower speeds of 

sound than those containing high levels of unsaturated compounds, such as biodiesel based 

on sunflower oil [196]. 

For biodiesel fuels, very small differences in the speed of sound are observed 

between the various biodiesels studied. Both the magnitude of the speed of sound and its 

temperature dependency vary less than 1% between the fluids, unlike what was previously 

observed for other properties [129, 135, 216]. In spite of the similarities it can be observed, 

nevertheless, that the increase in concentration of the saturation level of the compounds 

decreases the speed of sound. The palm biodiesel and the mixtures containing palm present 

the lower speeds of sound, while the sunflower has the largest speed of sound measured in 

this work.

The experimental speeds of sound of biodiesels were firstly predicted with the 

Auerbach’s equation and the Ideal Mixture Mixing Rules. The results reported in Table 3.6.4, 

however, show that the original Auerbach’s equation fails to provide a good description of the 

experimental data. Aiming at enhancing the description of the data the value of the model 

parameter was modified. To develop the modified Auerbach’s relation, four methyl esters 

(methyl palmitate, methyl oleate, methyl stearate and methyl linoleate) reported by Ott et al 

[210] and three biodiesels (S, SR and SRP) were used as training set to adjust the value of c1, 

while the other methyl esters and biodiesels here measured were used as validation set. A 

value for c1 of 0.987 was obtained that provided an OARD of 1.3 % for the training set and of 

1.4 % for the validation set in the temperature range 283-373 K. The behavior of the modified 

Auerbach’s model for both set of compounds can be seen separately in Figures 3.6.3 and 

3.6.4 where the deviation between the predicted and experimental data is within ± 4.0 %. A 

deficient temperature dependency of the model is highlighted in these figures.

The ARD for the ten biodiesels here studied and eleven other biodiesels previously 

reported in the literature are presented in Table 3.6.4 for the various models investigated. Here 

it can be seen that the ideal mixture mixing rules is seen to be the more appropriate model for 

describing the speeds of sound for biodiesel fuels, presenting only an OARD of 0.37 % for 21

biodiesel fuels here studied and the individual value of ARD was almost of the same 

magnitude for all biodiesels in comparison with 9.1 and 1.6 % of the original Auerbach’s 

equation and the modified Auerbach’s model respectively. The behavior of predictions of 

speed of sound for biodiesel fuels are shown in Figure 3.6.5. It is possible to observe again 

that the ideal mixture mixing rules is the most appropriate model for describing the 

experimental data, allowing a good prediction of their temperature dependency.

To estimate the speed of sounds for methylic biodiesel fuels at high pressures, this 

work used the experimental data of speed of sound reported by Tat et al [201] to develop a 

correlation. The experimental data displays very similar pressures dependencies for the speeds 

of sound observed for the pure FAME’s and for the biodiesel fuels, that are linear in the range 

of pressures (0-35 MPa) studied by Tat et al [201] For the same pressure range, a linear 

behavior is also observed for the experimental data reported by Pairy et al [202]. It should thus 

be possible to describe the pressure dependency of the speed of sound up to 40 MPa by  

         (3.6.6) 

Where u is the speed of sound in m/s, u0 is the speed of sound at atmospheric pressure, a is the 

pressure gradient and P is the pressure in MPa. To develop a high pressure correlation for the

speed of sound of biodiesel fuels the six FAME, C12:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and 

C18:3 reported by Tat et al [201], were used as the training set while the other six biodiesels 

as the validation set. After fitting the Eq. (3.6.6) to the experimental data of the training set, 

the numerical value of the pressure gradient was obtained (a=4.53 m/(s MPa)). This 

correlation of speed of sound provided an OARD of 0.37 % for the training set and 0.56 % for 

the validation set as detailed in Table 3.6.5. The validity of these correlations is limited to the 

pressures below 40 MPa and should not be extrapolated to higher pressures. As shown by 

Pairy et al [202] for higher pressures the pressure dependency of the speed of sound is no 

longer linear. Unfortunately at present the data available precludes the development of a 

correlation for higher pressures.

The experimental speeds of sound for some methyl esters presented in Table 3.6.1 

were also used to assess the Wada’s group contribution model. The adequacy of this model for 

predicting the speeds of sound of the fatty acid esters here studied is reported in Figure 3.6.6. 

The results show that the speed of sound of the methyl esters is well-described by this model, 

with temperature-dependent deviations that change only slightly, within ±0.3 %, in the range 



 

125 
 

of temperatures studied. Individual deviations for each ester are reported in Table 3.6.6, with 

maximum values for C8:0 and C18:2 that are lower than 0.2 % and an OARD of just 0.12 %.

The deviations between the predicted and experimental data are shown in Figure 3.6.7, 

where it is shown that the model provides a good description of the experimental data. Unlike 

the pure esters, for the biodiesels studied here, the deviations seem to be stable within the 

range of temperatures studied and present deviations within ±0.5 %. The largest deviations, 

with a maximum of 1.5 %, are only observed for an oxidized soy biodiesel, as shown in 

Figure 3.6.7. In comparison to the models described in our previous work, [196] the accuracy 

of Wada’s model seems to be better than that of Auerbach’s relation and closer to the ideal 

mixture mixing rules.

An extension of Wada’s model was also developed to predict the speed of sound of 

biodiesel fuels at high pressures. For this purpose, a linear pressure dependency, described by 

eq 3.6.7, was fitted to the high-pressure speed of sound of methyl caprate recently reported by 

Ndiaye et al [215].

dependency of the speed of sound is correctly described and is approximately linear in the 

pressure range considered. The data by Ndiaye et al [215] suggest that the pressure 

dependency of the speed of sound for higher pressures may no longer be linear, and thus, eqs. 

3.6.6 and 3.6.7 should not be used to extrapolate the speed of sound to higher pressures.

For pure ethyl esters, the magnitude of densities is in very good agreement with that 

reported by Pratas et al [151]. Their speeds of sound decrease with the temperature and 

increase with the ester chain length as seen in Figures 3.6.10 and 3.6.11. Moreover, for the 

same chain length, the presence of unsaturated bonds in the ester molecule increases the 

magnitude of speed of sound as expected since this property also depends directly on the 

density. Due to the lack of experimental data for ethyl esters, our experimental data were only 

compared to those reported by Daridon et al [211] and Ndiaye et al [215, 221]. The data 

showed to be in very good agreement, presenting a deviation below ±0.20 % as shown in 

Figure 3.6.12.

For the ethylic biodiesels, the difference of densities between the fluids is mainly 

expressed by the difference of FAEE compositions. Moreover, since the FAME present a

biodiesels is expected to be lower than that of the corresponding methylic biodiesels. 

Regarding the speed of sound, as previously observed for methylic biodiesels [205], a 

difference in the speed of sound of only ca. 1.0 % is observed between the four types of 

biodiesels studied. The same observation is valid for its temperature dependency. 

The experimental data here reported were used to test the predictive ability of the 

Wada’s model previously proposed [211]. The results reported in Table 3.6.12 suggest that 

the Wada’s model provide a very good description of the experimental speeds of sound for 

both the ethyl esters and the ethylic biodiesels respectively. For the nine ethyl esters studied 

the model tends to slightly overpredict the experimental speed of sound. Moreover, the 

deviations are very stable in the range of temperatures studied, except for the short-chain 

esters like ethyl butyrate where the model presents larger deviations as seen in Figure 3.6.13. 

This limitation might be related with the inadequacy of the Wada’s constants here used for 

description of speed of sound of the short-chain esters. Further work to overcome this problem 

is being undertaken but it does not impact on the systems of interest for the biodiesel industry. 

By excluding the ethyl butyrate of the remaining ethyl esters due to the larger deviations, the 

Wada’s model presents only an OARD of 0.14 %. For the biodiesels, the Wada 1 approach 

presents an OARD of 0.59 % (Table 3.6.12). Using the Wada 2 approach the OARD obtained 

was of only 0.45 %. The predictions presented in Figure 3.6.14 show that the deviations are 

temperature independent. Therefore, the Wada’s model applied directly or through the mixing 

rules can be extended to other biodiesel fuels provided that the composition of fatty esters is 

well known.

Finally since the fuel injection systems operate at high injection pressures, the 

prediction of high pressure speeds of sound would be of importance. But, unlike for methylic 

biodiesels, there are yet no data for FAEE to extend the atmospheric pressure model here 

proposed to high pressures as previously done for methylic biodiesels [196, 205]. The 

measurement of high pressure speed of sound for fatty acid ethyl esters and ethylic biodiesels 

is being carried in our laboratories and will be object of future works. 

 

3.6.5. Conclusions 

The experimental speeds of sound for eight pure methyl esters and ten methylic 

biodiesel fuels were measured at temperatures from 288 to 343 K and at atmospheric pressure. 

These data were then used, along with other literature data, to evaluate the capacity of two 

versions of Auerbach’s relation, ideal mixture mixing rules and Wada’s model to predict the 

speed of sound of biodiesel fuels from the knowledge of their composition. For all biodiesel 

studied, the overall average relative deviation (OARD) value obtained for these models were 

1.6, 0.37 and 0.29 %, respectively for the modified Auerbach model, ideal mixture mixing 

rules and Wada’s model, respectively.

Correlations for estimating the speeds of sound for biodiesels at high pressures were 

also developed with validity up to 40 MPa. The first correlation based on the literature data 

provides an OARD of 0.56 % for seven biodiesels tested. The second correlation that uses the 

Wada’s model was applied presents a global deviation of 1.0 %.  

The experimental speeds of sound for nine FAEE and four ethylic biodiesels, measured 

at atmospheric pressure and temperature from 293.15 to 343.15 K, were also here reported and 

were used to assess the predictive ability of the Wada’s model. It is shown that this method 

describes very well the experimental data of speed of sound for pure esters and biodiesel fuels, 

presenting only OARDs of 0.25 % and 0.45 %, respectively.  

This means that when the measurement of speed of sound is impractical for any 

biodiesel, these models can be a useful tool for predicting the speed of sound in a wide range 

of temperatures and pressures provided that the composition of fatty esters is known.

3.7. High pressure density and Speed of Sound of two biodiesel fuels: 

measurement and prediction 

 

 

 

 

In previous section (section 3.6) the study of high-pressure speed of sound was 

done only up to 45 MPa due to lack of experimental data at pressures above this 

value. Up to this limit the trend was linear but above this limit this trend was no 

longer valid anymore as shown by the data of Ndiaye et al [215]. Thereat 

Habrioux et al [222] provided experimental data of speed of sound and density 

for biodiesel fuels at pressures up to 200 and 100 MPa respectively for two 

biodiesel fuels (Soybean and Rapeseed) presented here in Supporting 

information B. This data is already submitted as article to the Journal of Energy 

&amp;amp; Fuels. My contribution to this paper was to develop correlations capable of 

describing the speed of sound and density of biodiesel fuels at pressures above 40 

MPa.

3.7.1. Experimental measurement 

The measurements of speed of sound at high pressure was based on a pulse echo 

technique working at 3 MHZ with a path length fixed to L0 = 30 mm. This length constitutes an 

acceptable compromise between shorter distances that reduce measuring accuracy and longer 

that increase the damping of the wave. The frequency of 3 MHz is low enough to avoid 

dispersion phenomena and is also a good compromise between lower frequencies (that give 

clear signal but with a lower precision) and higher frequencies (that give more damping of 

wave into the fluid but with a better precision). The apparatus is essentially made up of an 

acoustic sensor composed of two piezoelectric disks (12 mm in diameter) facing each other at 

both ends of a stainless steel cylindrical support. One of them generates the ultrasonic wave 

that travels into the fluid sample while the other is used to receive different echoes. The entire 

acoustic sensor is located within a stainless-steel high-pressure vessel closed at one end by a 

plug in which three electric connections were machined. These electric connections allow 

connecting both piezoelectric elements to a high voltage Ultrasonic Pulser – Receiver device 

(high-voltage pulse generator (Panametrics Model 5055PR). The speed of sound is determined 

from the measurement of the time between two successive echoes by using the base time of an 

oscilloscope (TEKTRONIX TDS 1022B). The path length needed for calculating speed of 

sound was determined at different temperatures and pressures by measuring the time of flight 

of the wave into a liquid of known speed of sound. Water and heptane were used for this 

calibration. This calibration leads to an uncertainty in the speed of sound of about 0.06 %. 

However, the ultimate error in speed of sound measurement depends in addition on the 

thermal stability as well as on the uncertainty in the measurement of both temperature and 

pressure. In order to ensure a satisfactory thermal stability, the full cell is immersed in a 

thermostated bath (HUBER CC410) filled with silicone oil and the temperature is directly 

measured into the fluid by a platinum probe (Pt100, 1.2 mm diameter) housed in a metal 

finger. With this configuration, temperature uncertainty leads to an additional error of 0.04 % 

in speed of sound. According to the pressure range investigated, two identical manometers 

(HOTTING BALDWIN MESSTECHNIK MVD 2510) were used to measure the pressure. 

One is calibrated in the full pressure scale (with an uncertainty of 0.2 MPa) whereas the other 



 

140 
 

is only calibrated up to 100 MPa in order to achieve a better accuracy in this range (0.02 

MPa). These pressure sensor involve an error in speed of sound less than 0.1 % up to 100 MPa 

and 0.2 % between (100 and 200) MPa. Consequently the overall experimental uncertainty in 

the reported speed of sound values is estimated to be 0.2 % between (0.1 and 100) MPa and 

0.3 % between (100 and 210 MPa). 

Density of biodiesels was measured by a densimeter ANTON-PAAR mPDS 2000 V3 

connected to a high pressure volumetric pump working up to 100 MPa. The principle of this 

apparatus is to measure the period of oscillation of a U-shape tube and to deduce the density 

which is related to the square of the period by a linear law. Vacuum and a liquid of reference 

were to determine the parameters of this linear function. Water and hexane were considered as 

reference. The temperature of the densimeter is controlled by an external circulating fluid 

using thermostatic bath (HUBER MINISTAT 125) and is measured with a Pt100 with an 

uncertainty of ? 0.1 K in the temperature range investigated. The pressure is transmitted to the 

cell by the liquid itself using a volumetric pump and measured with a HBM pressure gauge 

(with an uncertainty of 0.2 MPa) fixed on the circuit linking the pump to the U-tube cell. 

Taking into account the uncertainty of the temperature, the pressure, the density of the 

reference fluid as well as the error in the measurements of the period of oscillation for the 

vacuum and for both the reference and the studied liquid, the overall experimental uncertainty 

in the reported density values is estimated to be ? 0.5 kg/m

 (0.06 %).  

 

3.7.2. Results and discussion 

The experimental data of speed of sound here measured was used to assess an 

extension of the Wada’s model to high pressures. This extension is described by Eq. (3.7.1)

where u0 (m/s) is the atmospheric speed of sound predicted with the Wada’s model at the 

reference pressure P0, T (K) is the absolute temperature and P (MPa) is the absolute pressure. 

The parameters a and b are the fitting parameters whose values were estimated by fitting the 

Eq.(3.7.1) to the experimental high pressure speeds of sound of methyl caprate reported by

and an overall value (OAAD) of 0.53 % as shown in Table 3.7.1.

The adequacy of the proposed approach for the description of the speeds of sound is also 

highlighted in the Figures 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 where it is shown that the model provides a very 

good description of the experimental speeds of sound of the biodiesels studied up to 200 MPa, 

confirming thus the suitability of the extended Wada’s model to provide reliable predictions of 

the speed of sound for any biodiesel fuel at high pressures.

high pressure densities is achieved.

High-pressure speeds of sound and densities of two biodiesels (soybean and rapeseed) were 

here measured and predicted using quadratic extrapolations of the atmospheric pressure data. 

These approaches described very well the experimental data, presenting only overall average 

relative deviations (OARD) of 0.53 % for speed of sound and 0.14 % for density.

3.8. High pressure viscosity of biodiesel fuels: measurement and 
prediction 

 

 

 

 

This part of work reports new experimental data of high-pressure viscosities for 

three biodiesel fuels (soybean, rapeseed and their binary mixture) measured at 

temperatures from 283.15 K to 393.15 K and pressures from atmospheric up to 140 

MPa and proposes a correlation capable of describing the experimental data. The 

FAME compositions of biodiesels are already presented in Section 3.2. The 

measurements of viscosity were done by Prof. Dr. José Juan Segovia Puras at the 

University of Valladolid, Spain.

3.8.1. Introduction 

The modern injection system called “common rail injection systems” uses high 

pressures (up to 200 MPa) to pump the fuel and avoid the leakage [223, 224]. At this point, the 

prior knowledge of high-pressure viscosities of biodiesel becomes crucial for previewing the 

engine performance and the quality of emissions. Most data available in the literature reports 

the temperature dependency of viscosity for biodiesel fuels at atmospheric pressure. Only few 

works have focused on measuring and predicting the high-pressure viscosities of biodiesel 

fuels and their blends with petrodiesel [223-227]. Thereat, this work aims to report new 

experimental data of high- pressure viscosity for three methylic biodiesels (soybean, rapeseed 

and their binary mixture) measured at temperatures from 283.15 to 393.15 K and pressures 

from atmospheric to 140 MPa, and to propose a correlation capable of predicting them and 

their mixtures with petrodiesel.  

 

3.8.2. Experimental section 

The three biodiesel samples here studied: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R) and their binary 

mixture (SR) are already described in Section 3.2.  

 The experimental measurements of high-pressure viscosities were done using a 

vibrating-wire instrument developed in the TERMOCAL laboratory (Figure 3.8.1). This 

instrument is capable of operating at temperatures between 273.15 and 423.15K and at 

pressures up to 140 MPa. Calibration was performed by means of measurements in vacuum, 

air, and toluene. The estimated uncertainty of the results is 1 % in viscosity. 

The vibrating wire viscometer has been designed to operate in the viscosity range 0.3–

30 mPa·s. The vibrating wire and magnetic assembly were housed in a commercially-available 

pressure vessel HIP rated for operation at 140 MPa, this vessel was immersed in a bath Hart 

Scientific 6020. The temperature of the fluid was measured using two platinum resistance 

thermometer (PRT) and a ASL F100 thermometer. This thermometer was calibrated with an 

uncertainty of ±0.02 K. The pressure was measured in the external pipework by means of a 

Druck DPI 104 transducer, with a full scale reading of 140 MPa and an uncertainty of ± 0.02 

% kPa/kPa. The pressure was generated by a HiP pump, model 68-5.75-15.

3.8.3. Results and discussion 

 The experimental viscosities of the three biodiesels here studied are presented in Table 

3.8.1 where it is seen, as expected, that the magnitude of viscosity is higher for saturated 

biodiesel at the same temperature and pressure (i.e., biodiesel R is more viscous than biodiesel 

S) and increases with the pressure due to the increasing molecular interactions (i.e., the 

molecules become more compacted with the pressure rise).

To model the experimental viscosities presented above we followed an approach 

similar to that previously proposed by us for the densities and speed of sound [222]. For that 

purpose two set of compounds were used to develop a correlation described by Equation 

(3.8.1)  

        (3.8.1)

with ? being the dynamic viscosity in mPa.s, P the absolute pressure in MPa, T is the absolute 

temperature in K and a and b the fitting parameters. The experimental data reported by 

Duncan et al [223] were used as the training set to adjust the values of the fitting parameters a 

and b. The validation set was the three biodiesel here studied (S, R and SR).   

The values of 1.2 and 0.84 were obtained respectively for parameters a and b with 

which the Eq. (3.8.1) predicts very well the experimental data, presenting only an OARD of 

3.0 % for the training set and of 3.9 % for the validation set in the temperature range of 283–

393 K and pressure range of 0.1–140 MPa as seen in Table 3.8.2.  

 

Table 3.8. 2. ARDs of viscosity for biodiesels at high pressure 

 

The behavior of the correlation here developed for both set of compounds can be seen 

separately in Figures 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 for the training and validation sets. The adequacy of this 

correlation to describe the pressure dependency of dynamic viscosity of biodiesels at different 

temperatures for the validation set is shown in the Figures 3.8.3-3.8.5 where the three 

biodiesels studied presented higher deviations only at the lowest temperature of 283.15 K, 

while for all other temperatures the deviations are low. This approach can be easily extended 

to predict the high pressure viscosities of any biodiesel provided that the atmospheric pressure 

values are known either experimentally or can be estimated as we proposed in a previous work 

[145].

The correlation here developed was also extended to describe mixtures of biodiesels 

with diesel. To do this, however, a separate parameter fitting of Eq. (1) was done for diesel 

using the experimental data reported by Duncan et al [224] The values of 134.5 and 1.6 were 

obtained for a and b, respectively. The viscosities of the mixtures were predicted using the 

Grundberg-Nissan mixing rules expressed by the Eq. (3.8.2)  

 

    (3.8.2) 

 

where xdiesel and xbiodiesel are the mole fractions of diesel and biodiesel in the blended fuel, 

respectively, and ?diesel and ?biodiesel are the dynamic viscosities of pure diesel and biodiesel at a 

particular temperature and pressure, respectively. Using the equations (3.8.1) and (3.8.2) 

together, the prediction of high-pressure viscosities of the blends was excellent, presenting 

only an OARD of 3.3 % as shown in Table 3.8.3. The adequacy of this model can be seen also 

in the Figures 3.8.6-3.8.8 for three representative blends (B5, B40 and B80).

Grundberg-Nissan mixing rules using the molar fraction approach. 

 

In practice, however, the informations about the blends of biodiesels with diesel fuel 

are normally given in volume fractions and sometimes there are no data on molecular weight 

and also density of diesel fuel (at different temperatures) to convert the volume fraction into 

the molar fraction to be used in the Eq. (3.8.1). So, this work tried to use directly the volume 

fraction in the Grundberg Nissan equation, instead of molar fraction, according to the Eq. 

(3.8.3) to predict the experimental high-pressure viscosities of the blends, where vdiesel and 

vbiodiesel are the volume fractions of diesel and biodiesel in the blended fuel, respectively 

 

   (3.8.3) 

 

Fortunately the results of prediction using this approach are equal to that using the molar 

fraction, suggesting that one can use it to calculate the viscosities of the blends. The ARDS of 

this approach are presented in Table 3.8.3 and its adequacy can also be seen in Figure 3.8.9 

for B80.

3.8.4.  Conclusions 

  New experimental data of high-pressure viscosity for three methylic biodiesels, 

measured at temperature from 283.15 to 393.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to 140 MPa 

were here reported and a correlation to predict the viscosities at high pressure for the 

biodiesels is proposed based on literature data. It is shown that this correlation provides good 

predictions for the viscosities of the studied biodiesels and, coupled with the Grundberg-

Nissan mixing rules, describes very well the experimental data of viscosity for biodiesel fuels 

blends with diesel, presenting OARDs of 3.9 and 3.3 %, respectively. This good description of 

the data suggests that this correlation can be extended to the prediction of the viscosity of 

other biodiesel fuels provided that experimental viscosity at atmospheric pressure is known.

3.9. High-Pressure density of vegetable oils 

 

 

 

 

This work is already submitted to the Journal of Chemical Engineering Data. 

Because there was no equipment at our laboratory for measuring the high-

pressure densities of the vegetable oils, the experimental measurement of density 

was done in Spain at the University of Vigo by Prof. Manuel Piñeiro and his 

group. The whole modeling part was done by myself.  



 

160 
 



 

161 
 

3.9.1. Introduction 

For any fluid and process, density is important as it gives enough information about the 

amount of material being processed and correlates with many other transport and acoustic 

properties such as viscosity, surface tension, volatility, and speed of sound, among others that 

are not only necessary for an efficient design, control and optimization of operation conditions 

but also for a reliable development of models. Density data is also important for the high 

pressure processing of vegetable oils as already stated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this thesis. 

Nevertheless, there is little information concerning the measurement of high-pressure density 

of vegetable oils, and much less the models to predict their behavior. Some experimental data 

are only available at atmospheric pressure.  

This work aims to provide the experimental densities of seven different vegetable oils 

at temperatures from 283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from 0.1 to 45 MPa, correlating them 

using the modified Tait-Tammann equation and using them to evaluate the predictive ability 

of the three versions of GCVOL group contribution method, the Halvorsen’s model and the 

Zong’s Fragment-Based Approach model. The development of a high pressure extension of 

these models will also be here proposed. 

 

3.9.2. Experimental details 

 

3.9.2.1. Samples and density measurement 

Oils of soybean (S), rapeseed (R), sunflower (Sf), castor (C), palm (P), Aleurites 

moluccana (Am) and Jatropha curcas (Jc) were here used. The first five oils were obtained 

from Portuguese companies (S from Bunge Ibérica Portugal SA, Sf, P and R from Sovena and 

C from José M. Vaz Pereira SA) while the last two non-edible oils were obtained by solid-

liquid extraction of the corresponding seeds in a Soxlet with n-hexane. The composition of 

fatty acids in these oils was measured by conversion of the oil into fatty esters. The fatty acid 

profiles of the biodiesel S, P, Sf and R are already presented in the section 3.2 and those of the 

two non-edible oils (Am and Jc) and the castor oil (C) are presented here in Table 3.9.1. The 



 

162 
 

conversion of these oils into biodiesels was done using the methodology of Ghadge et al [228] 

whose details are described in Chapter 5. The experimental procedure of density 

measurement is already described in Section 3.2.

3.9.3. Density models 

The modified Tait-Tammann equation [229], the GCVOL group contribution method, 

the Halvorsen‘s model [230, 231] and the Zong’s Fragment-Based Approach model [232] 

were here used to describe the temperature and pressure dependency of densities of vegetable 

oils. The first two approaches were previously applied elsewhere with success to the 

description of the experimental densities of fatty esters [151, 152] and biodiesels [128]. 

3.9.3.1. Modified Tait-Tammann correlation  

This correlation relates density (? in g/cm
3
) with temperature (T in K) and pressure (P 

in MPa) in a polynomial form, involving several fitting parameters according to the Eqs. 

(3.9.1) to (3.9.3) that are adjusted to the experimental data.

3.9.3.2. Halvorsen’s model 

This model is detailed in Halvorsen et al [230]. Shortly it combines the fatty acid 

critical properties and the respective composition to predict the density of oils using the eq. 

(3.9.4), 

    (3.9.4) 

where ?oil (g/cm
3
) is the density of the vegetable oil, R (cm

.bar/(mol.K) is the universal gas 

constant, Tr is the reduced temperature, Fc is a correction factor characteristic of the oil, xi is 

the mole fraction, MWi (g/mol) is the fatty acid molecular weight, PCi (bar) is the critical 

pressure, ZRAi is the Rackett parameter and TCi (K) is the critical temperature. 

The Tr and Fc can be estimated using the eqs. (3.9.5) to (3.9.8).

In Eq. (3.9.7), the value of the constant k is equal to 0.000082 when the molecular 

weight of the oil is greater than 875 g/mol and 0.000098 when the molecular weight is less 

than 875 g/mol. 

 

3.9.3.3. Zong’s model 

Zong et al [232] developed a fragment- based approach to estimate the thermophysical 

properties of triglyceride mixtures. In case of density, this can be calculated using the Eq. 

(3.9.9), where ?oil is the oil density and ?i the density of triglyceride i (in g/cm
3
) and wi the 

mass fraction of triglyceride i.

This approach requires the knowledge of representative triglyceride molecules. Then, 

the density of each triglyceride molecule is simply estimated from its molar volume using the 

Eq. (3.8.10), where VA
l 
is the liquid molar volume contribution of fragment A (in cm

and Nfrag,A is the number of fragment A in the oil.

According to the parameters Ai, Bi, and Ci used the GCVOL method can be divided in three 

different versions: The original version uses the parameters reported by Elbro et al [141] This 

version presents 36 different group parameters for a variety of chemical classes, such as 

alkanes, aromatic, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers, chlorides, and 

siloxanes. The extended version uses the parameters reported by Ihmels et al [142]and the 

revised version uses the parameters proposed by Pratas et al [128].

3.9.4. Results and discussions 

The experimental densities for seven vegetable oils measured at temperatures from 

283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to 45 MPa are reported in Table 3.9.2.The 

density differs between the oils according to the nature of fatty acids that compose the oil, 

following the same trends previously observed for biodiesels [128]. The unsaturated oils have 

densities higher than those of saturated oils. However the effect of unsaturation level seems to 

outweigh the effect of carbon chain length and thus, for the same level of unsaturation, the 

density of the short-chain oils is not necessarily higher than that of the longer ones. At similar 

conditions, the density of sunflower oil, highly unsaturated, is higher than that of palm oil, 

with low unsaturated content, even though this has shorter chain length than that the other.

The adequacy of this correlation to describe the data is illustrated in Figure 3.9.1 for Aleurites 

moluccana oil and by the RDs between the experimental and the correlated densities shown in 

Figures 3.9.2 and 3.9.3. The correlated results are very coherent with the experimental data 

and the deviations are shown to be pressure and temperature-independent with a maximum

The Halvorsen’s model requires the prior knowledge of the critical properties of fatty 

acids to estimate the densities of vegetable oils. So these properties were obtained directly 

from Halvorsen et al [230] for the majority of fatty acids except for the ricinoleic acid whose

critical properties were calculated apart using the Joback’s method [233]. Using these 

properties, along with the fatty acid composition, the description of densities for seven 

vegetable oils was excellent with an OARD of only 0.34% (Table 3.9.4). Nevertheless, the 

relative deviations are slightly temperature-dependent with a maximum of 1.4 %, especially 

for the castor oil, as shown in Figure 3.9.4.

The Zong’s model estimates the density of vegetable oils from that of the triglyceride 

molecules. Thus, the first step of prediction was the building up of the triglyceride molecules 

to represent the fatty acid fragments present in oils. For example, Zong et al [232] used 8 of 33 

representative triglyceride molecules to describe successfully the experimental densities of 

three Brazilian oils (buriti oil, brazil nut oil and grape seed oil) with an average relative 

deviation of less than 0.80 %. Since on this work the composition of the oil in triglycerides 

was unknown, and only the fatty acid profile was available, to use this method we defined 

pseudocompounds to describe the oil composition. The pseudocomponents were triglycerides, 

formed by three identical fatty acids, with compositions defined to match the fatty acid profile 

of the oils as reported in Table 3.9.5.

The temperature-dependency parameters of the fragments, B1,A and B2,A,were reported 

by Zong et al [232]. Based on these parameters, the Zong’s model provided a good description 

of the density of the six vegetable oils here studied, with an OARD of 1.2 % (Table 3.9.4). 

The density of castor oil was not predicted with this method because there were no values of 

parameters B1,A and B2,A for the ricinoleic acid. This model produced deviations that are 

almost stable over the range of temperatures studied, with a maximum of 2.5 % as shown in 

Figure 3.9.5.

The density prediction with GCVOL group contribution method began with the 

division of the molecule of vegetable oil into several functional groups: CH3 and CH2 to 

describe the contribution of the linear and saturated alkyl chain, CH=CH to consider the 

unsaturation of the alkyl chain, and finally CHCOO and CH2COO to take into account the 

ester contributions and CHOH to consider the alcohol contribution. This method was then 

applied in three different versions according to the values of parameters Ai, Bi, and Ci for the 

groups described above. As stated above, the original version used the parameters reported by 

Elbro et al [141]. The extended version used the parameters reported by Ihmels et al [142] and 

the revised version used the new parameters proposed by Pratas et al [128] to describe the 

unsaturation group.  

Between the three versions of the GCVOL method studied, the revised version was the 

most adequate form to describe the temperature dependency of density for oils with an OARD 

of only 1.1 % followed by the extended version with an OARD of 2.6 %. The original version 

presented a very high deviation (OARD of 6.3 %). For all cases the deviations are somewhat 

temperature-dependent with a maximum of 2.5 % for the revised version. The performance of 

the revised GCVOL method is presented in Figure 3.9.6.

An extension of the models here studied to high pressure is also proposed to describe 

the pressure-dependency of density for vegetable oils according to the Eq. (3.9.15), where ? is 

the density in g/cm

high-pressure densities of vegetable oils as they describe poorly the temperature-dependency.  

The description of the experimental high-pressure densities for all vegetable oils was 

very good for the three methods studied, presenting OARDs of 0.75, 1.04 and 0.41 % for the 

models of Halvorsen, Zong and revised GCVOL, respectively, as shown in Table 3.9.6. 

Moreover, the RDs for all methods are slightly pressure-dependent with maximum deviations 

of less than 2.0 % as seen in Figures 3.9.7-3.9.9. These models are thus adequate to describe 

the temperature and pressure dependency of the density for vegetable oils, provided that the 

fatty acid profile is known.

3.9.5. Conclusions 

The experimental data of high pressure densities for seven vegetable oils were here 

reported for temperatures ranging from 283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to 

45 MPa. These data were correlated with the Tait-Tammann equation and used to assess the 

adequacy of GCVOL group contribution method, Halvorsen’s model and Zong’s model for 

prediction of vegetable oils density. The Halvorsen’s model and Zong’s model described very 

well the temperature dependency of oil density with overall average relative deviations 

(OARDs) of 0.34 and 1.1 %, respectively. Between the three versions of the GCVOL method 

studied, the revised version was the most adequate for prediction of the densities of oils, 

presenting an OARD of 1.2 %. An extension of the models here studied to high pressure was 

also proposed. The models provided very good predictions of density with OARDs of 0.75, 

1.04 and 0.41 % for the models of Halvorsen, Zong and revised GCVOL, respectively and the 

deviations were just slightly pressure-dependent with a maximum deviation of less than 2.0 %.

CHAPTER 4 

 

 

Modeling the Thermodynamic Properties of Fatty Esters 

and Biodiesels with the Soft-SAFT EoS 

 

 
This chapter concerns the use of Soft-SAFT EoS to compute the thermodynamic properties of 

fatty esters (FAME and FAEE) and biodiesels. As these molecules are non-self-associating 

fluids, their properties were defined by only three molecular parameters: mi (chain length), ?ii 

(segment diameter) and ?ii/kB (dispersive energy between segments). The results for several 

properties of fatty esters and biodiesels like density, surface tension, speed of sound and 

viscosity are here presented both at atmospheric and at high pressure.  

The completeness of this chapter was achieved with the direct cooperation of Dr. Mariana 

Belo from our group and Dr. Felix Llovel from Matgas, in Barcelona.  The biodiesels here 

studied were the ten described earlier in Chapter 3. Other calculations were done by me.

4.1. Introduction 

So far many works have been dedicated to predict the thermophysical properties of 

biodiesels, as well as of fatty esters that compose them, to assess their quality as fuel. Accurate 

thermodynamic properties are needed over a wide range of temperature and pressure to 

optimize biodiesel production, processing and application. Unfortunately most of the available 

data do not cover wide ranges of temperature and pressure. So Chapter 3 exposes the 

experimental and predicted data for several properties of feed oils, biodiesels and fatty esters 

with an emphasis on high-pressures.   

The molecular based equations of state (EoS) are also an alternative tool to compute 

these properties.  CPA EoS, for example has been used to predict thermodynamic properties of 

some pure esters and biodiesels as density [140] and surface tensions and vapor pressure as 

already described in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively. This chapter aims at applying a variant 

of SAFT (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory), soft-SAFT, for describing the thermodynamic 

properties of fatty esters. This variant of SAFT has been used with success in many works to 

model the thermodynamic properties, phase behavior and critical behavior of alkanes [234], 

alkanols [235], perfluoroalkanes [236, 237],  ionic liquids (ILs) [238] and of several 

poly(ethylene glycol) mixtures [239]. The solubility behavior of several gases such as CO2, 

H2, and Xe in ILs [240], water [241-243], alkanes [234, 244] and perfluoroalkanes [245, 246] 

was also successfully described with this equation. There is still no work, however, addressing 

the description of fatty esters thermodynamic properties using soft-SAFT EoS. Consequently, 

this chapter will present new sets of molecular parameters capable of computing density, 

surface tension, speed of sound and viscosity of fatty esters in a wide range of temperatures 

and pressures.

4.2. The soft-SAFT EoS 

According to the type of the reference fluid adopted, there are several variant of the 

SAFT EoS, all of them based on the Wertheim’s first-order thermodynamic perturbation 

theory. The original version developed by Chapman et al [247] uses the hard-sphere fluid as 

reference fluid; the SAFT-VR developed by Gil-Villegas et al [248] uses the square-well fluid 

with a variable range; the PC-SAFT proposed by Gross et al [249] uses the hard-chain fluid 

and the soft-SAFT, developed by Blas and Vega [250, 251] and applied in this work uses the 

Lennard- Jones fluid as reference. 

The soft-SAFT is an accurate version of SAFT written, as all other versions, in terms 

of a sum of contributions to the total Helmholtz free energy of the system: [252, 253] 

 (4.1) 

Where a
res

 and a
id

 are the residual Helmholtz free energy and the ideal contribution, 

respectively. Subsequently, ref, chain, assoc and polar represent the reference term, the chain 

formation, the association and the polar interactions. 

For the reference term, soft-SAFT uses Lennard-Jones (LJ) spherical fluid which takes 

into account the repulsive and the attractive interactions of the monomers that constitute the 

chain. This term includes two molecular parameters representing the monomer: the segment 

diameter, ?ii, and the dispersive energy between segments, ?ii/kB [254]. In our approach, the 

reference term is computed using the equation of Johnson et al [255]. 

The chain and association terms derive directly from the following Wertheim’s theory 

[256, 257], 

       (4.2) 

      (4.3) 

Being ? the molecular density, T the temperature, m the chain length, xi the molar fraction of 

component i, kB the Boltzman constant and gL,J the radial distribution function at density 



 

181 
 

of a LJ spheres, with mi being the chain length parameter. The description of gL,J 

it given by the fitted computer simulation data, as a function of density and temperature, 

proposed by Johnson et al [255] Xi
??

is the fraction of pure component i not bonded at site ? 

and Mi the number of association sites of type ? in component i. Xi
??

is given by: 

       (4.4) 

 The specific site-site function, ???,ij, is described as: 

         (4.5) 

Being K??,ij the site-site bonding-volume of association and the Mayer f-function: 

        (4.6) 

The Mayer function includes the site-site association energy parameter . 

Within the soft-SAFT framework, non-self-associating molecules are defined by three 

molecular parameters: the chain length, mi, the segment diameter, ?ii, and the dispersive 

energy between segments, ?ii/kB. For associating molecules two more parameters are included 

to model the associating interactions: the site-site association energy,???,ij
HB

/kB, and the site-

site bonding-volume of association, K??,ij. 

The Density Gradient Theory (DGT) was coupled to the soft-SAFT equation to 

compute interfacial properties. DGT was first proposed by van der Waals [258] and then 

rediscovered by Cahn et al [259]. The expression for the Helmholtz energy of the system is 

given by: 

      (4.7) 



 

182 
 

where a0 ??) is the Helmholtz free energy density of the homogeneous fluid at the local density 

? and ?i  is the molar density of component i. cij is the influence parameter that is assumed to 

be temperature independent. Its value is normally regressed from interfacial tension 

experimental data. 

 Assuming a planar interface and neglecting the cij density dependence it is possible to 

derive an expression relating interfacial tensions and the square of the density gradient [260]:
 

   (4.8) 

Where ?0i and p0 are the equilibrium chemical potential and pressure, respectively, and z is the 

direction perpendicular to the interface. Further details about the implementation of the DGT 

approach into soft-SAFT can be found in previous works [261, 262]. 

The derivative properties of a thermodynamic potential function can be written in 

several ways. They can be considered as derivatives of the Helmholtz energy and the pressure, 

which are direct calculations from the soft-SAFT equation. Hence, the expressions for the 

main derivative properties calculated in this work are:

 The calculation of viscosity with the soft-SAFT EoS is normally done by coupling it 

with the Friction Theory (FT) or the free-volume theory (FVT). Both theories divide the 

dynamic viscosity into two parts according to the Eq. (4.15) but use differently the dense-state 

correction term.

R is the universal constant in J/(mol K), M is the molecular weight in g/mol and P is pressure 

in MPa. The molar density ? (in mol/cm
3
) is the only property derived from the EOS. Equation 

4.17 is an approximation of the intermolecular energy. Its first term is considered to be the 

energy barrier a molecule has to overcome to diffuse, and the second term is considered to be 



 

184 
 

the energy needed to form a vacant passage for the diffusion. E is interpreted as the flow 

energy barrier only.  

At last the application of FVT requires three additional parameters related to the 

viscosity of the pure fluid. L is the length parameter [Å], absorbing the average quadratic 

length, which is related to the structure of the molecules and the characteristic relaxation time, 

? is the proportionality between the energy barrier and the density in J m
3
/(mol kg) and B is a 

positive number characteristic of the free-volume overlap. Using a transferable approach, the 

? parameter is taken from the equivalent n-alkane, while the remaining two parameters B and 

Lv are fitted to viscosity data of the pure fluid at several isobars [266]. 

 

4.3. Results and discussion 

Several thermodynamic properties of fatty esters (FAME and FAEE) namely density, 

surface tension, speed of sound and viscosity were here computed with the soft-SAFT EoS at 

wide ranges of temperature and pressure using only three molecular parameters: the chain 

length, mi, the segment diameter, ?ii, and the dispersive energy between segments, ?ii/kB and 

some other fitting parameters like influence parameter (c) for surface tension and parameters 

??????and L for viscosity. The results for each property are described below.  

 

4.3.1. Regression of molecular parameters 

As already stated earlier, and similarly to alkanes, the fatty esters molecules are non-

self-associating fluids and so, within the Soft-SAFT EoS framework, their properties can be 

effectively defined by the three molecular parameters aforementioned. Before doing a separate 

optimization of these parameters for FAME, however, as this work is an extension of our 

previous works [251, 267] and given that soft-SAFT EoS has the ability to provide 

transferable parameters from a certain family of compounds to those of other families, we 

started the description of FAME thermodynamic properties using the molecular parameters 

correlated directly from the trend lines of alkanes [251, 266, 267] . The results, however, were 



 

185 
 

far from acceptable, i.e., the slopes of the predicted and the experimental densities did not 

match each other when depicting them in the same representation as illustrated in Figure 4.1 

for methyl caprate, methyl palmitate and methyl stearate.  

 

Figure 4 1. Density vs. temperature for FAME at atmospheric pressure. Symbols represent 

experimental data  Methyl caprate,  Methyl palmitate and  Methyl stearate. Lines are the soft-

SAFT results using the molecular parameters correlated from alkanes 

This deviation may be due to the fact that  the convergence criteria of this EoS is 

highly sensitive to the initial conditions, on the one hand, and the fluids (alkanes and esters) 

are quite different due to the presence of the ester group, on the other hand. Thereat, new sets 

of molecular parameters were regressed for FAME, at a strict reduced-temperature (Tr) range, 

using the experimental data of vapor pressure and liquid density reported respectively by Yuan 

et al [161] and Pratas et al [151, 152]. The results are presented in Table 4.1. With these 

parameters soft-SAFT is able to compute FAME densities with an OARD of only 0.047 %.

These trends are similar to those reported by Pàmies et al [234] for alkanes or at least ensure 

similar trends of all compounds in function of molecular weight, i.e., when depicting the 

molecular parameters of FAME and alkanes in the same representation, as a function of the 

molecular weight, there are similar trends easily seen, either as individual m, ?, ?/kB, or as 

m*?
3
 and m*?/kB (Figures 4.4 to 4.8). The parameter m presents a sharper gradient for the 

alkanes than for the esters due to the reasons already mentioned above.

the densities of the FAEE were very well predicted by Soft SAFT with an OARD of 1.4 %

The high-pressure densities for fatty acid esters were very well predicted with the soft-

SAFT EoS, using the molecular parameters regressed from density data at atmospheric 

pressure presenting an OARD of only 1.1 % (0.49 % for FAME and 1.8 % for FAEE) as 

shown in Table 4.3. The adequacy of this model is also shown in Figures 4.10 to 4.14 for 

methyl caprate, methyl linoleate and ethyl laurate. It can be seen that the experimental density 

temperature and pressure dependencies are correctly described, matching the predicted data 

slope with the experimental one, contrarily to what happened with other EoS [140].

Parachor’s model reported by the Knotts et al [183] at temperatures from 293.15 to 423.15

For FAEE, before calculating their own influence parameters, these were first 

calculated from the FAME trend (with Eq. 4.21), but with these values the prediction of 

surface tension of FAEE was somehow poor as seen in Figure 4.17 for ethyl myristate, 

ethyl stearate and ethyl oleate. The OARD was 6.1 % as seen in Table 4.5. So, new 

regression of the influence parameters was done for FAEE using again the experimental 

data reported by Knotts et al [183]. With the new influence parameters, the prediction of 

the surface tensions of FAEE by soft-SAFT was excellent with an OARD of only 0.53 % 

as shown in Table 4.6.The adequacy of this model to describe the FAEE surface tensions 

is seen in Figure 4.18.

4.3.2.3. Speed of sound 

Unlike the surface tension, no extra fitting parameter is required in the algorithm of 

soft SAFT beyond the molecular parameters for the estimation of speeds of sound. 

Consequently the speeds of sound of fatty esters were calculated in soft-SAFT using the 

Eq. 4.14 

The soft SAFT provides all the variables involved in the equations above except the 

Cp whose values reported in the output of soft-SAFT were only residual while the 

prediction of speed of sound needs the contribution of the ideal Cp. The ideal Cp was 

calculated using the Joback’s group contribution method [233]. The results are illustrated 

in Figures 4.19 and 4.20 for several FAME and FAEE, respectively. The high-pressure 

speeds of sound were also predicted by soft-SAFT for some esters. The results are shown 

in Figures 4.21 to 4.23e, for methyl caprate, methyl oleate and ethyl laurate. The lag 

between the experimental and predicted data is high but its magnitude is almost equal for 

the majority of esters. This deviation could be solved within the algorithm of soft-SAFT 

through a fitting parameter.

4.3.2.4. Viscosity

[266]. The predictions, however, were very poor as seen in Table 4.7

critical volume, critical temperature and acentric factor were estimated using the Joback’s

errors for FAME viscosities soft-SAFT description are shown in Table 4.8.

These parameters provide a good description of the viscosities for FAME but, 

unlike the molecular parameters, the outcoming parameters for FAEE obtained from linear 

correlations did not work to predict FAEE viscosities (Table 4.9).  

Table 4. 9. Soft-SAFT viscosity parameters deduced directly from the trend lines proposed 

for FAME viscosity parameters and correspondent ARD for FAEE viscosities at T from 

288.15 to 378.15 K.

C14:0 256.43 213.474 0.005536 0.7442 109.4 

 

Although the trend lines of these parameters are similar for all the three families of 

compounds studied (Figures 4.24-4.26), the use of any common correlation of each 

parameter can not predict very well the experimental data of viscosities, confirming thus 

the high sensibility of the model to the parameters values in terms of the convergence 

criteria.

The results presented above for biodiesels are only valid for pressure up to 45 MPa. 

At this limit the soft-line seemed to be linear, but above this value the trendline of density 

is no longer linear as seen in Figures 4.38 and 4.39 for two biodiesels (R and S). Even the 

prediction still has some degradative effect at pressure higher than 45 MPa, the curvatures 

of experimental and predicted data matched each other.

pressures from atmospheric to 140 MPa (compositions of biodiesels presented on Table 

3.2.2 in Section 3.2). The prediction was very good in the range of temperatures and 

pressures studied as seen in Figures 4.40 to 4.44. Even the deviations are large at low 

temperature and at high pressure (as occurred with the pure FAME), the trendlines of the 

experimental and predicted data coincided.

4.4. Conclusions 

  

The ability of soft-SAFT to describe and predict several thermodynamic properties 

of fatty acid esters and biodiesels was here tested. It is here shown that this model was 

capable of computing several properties of fatty esters and biodiesels using only three 

molecular parameters: mi (chain length), ?ii (segment diameter)and ?ii/kB (dispersive energy 

between segments) as these compounds are non-self-associating fluids. Using these 

parameters and some other fitting parameters like influence parameter for surface tension 

and ????? the overall average relative deviations (OARD) for FAME were 

0.49 % for the high-pressure density prediction, 2.4 % for surface tensions description and 3.7 % 

for viscosity calculations. The OARD for FAEE were 1.8 % for high-pressure density, 2.6 % for 

surface tensions and 1.4 % for viscosity description. The better description of high-pressure 

densities for pure methyl esters also reflected in a better description of high pressure 

density of biodiesels.  

The unique challenge linked to the prediction process was about the transferability 

of the parameters. First, the molecular parameters correlated from alkane’s trend lines were 

not able to describe the densities of fatty esters. Second, even with the transferable 

molecular parameters for FAME, the influence parameter and viscosity parameters were 

0.0

for FAEE correlated from the FAME trend lines were not able to compute the surface 

tension and viscosity of fatty acid ethyl esters. This situation happens due to the parameter 

values in terms of the convergence criteria. Howsoever, using all the parameters here 

studied the predictions of high-pressure density and also viscosity of biodiesel fuels were 

done with success.

CHAPTER 5 

 

 

Production of biodiesel from resources endogenous of 

Timor Leste  

 

 

 

This chapter reports the production and the study of fuel properties of biodiesels from 

several non-edible oils preferentially those with high level of free fatty acids endogenous 

of Timor Leste. Production of methylic biodiesel directly from the oils of Jatropha curcas, 

Aleurites moluccana and coffee waste was performed by me at our Laboratory with the 

yield of methyl esters obtained being superior to 93% and their fuel properties meet the 

international biodiesel standards.  

This section aims to, first, demonstrate these oils as a model for the utilization of 

bioresources in Timorese arid lands for cost-effective biodiesel production and, second, to 

asses the ability of the models described in Chapter 3 to predict the density, viscosity and 

surface tensions of these biodiesels. The models used were revised GCVOL method for 

density, revised Yuan’s model for viscosity and Mac-Sugden model with Knotts’ 

parachors for surface tension.

5.1. Introduction 

As already highlighted in the introductory chapter of this thesis, the current social and 

economic circumstances of Timor Leste ask for the development of biodiesel in the country. A 

biodiesel refinery would be an adequate solution for the problems related to lack of electricity 

and jobs and mainly to poverty and deprivation. Biodiesel development is highly 

recommended because, first, the exploration of the Timorese undersea fossil resources (oil and 

gas) has not been favorable for the population’s life (the corresponding revenues have been 

plumping the Petroleum Fund but with no positive impacts on the incomes and the living 

conditions of the population). Second, a majority of population is subsistence farmers and so 

their productions will have appropriate destinations with the existence of a biodiesel refinery. 

Third, in a country with poor technology and know-how to manage the environmental 

problems linked to the use of petroleum fuels, biodiesel is more benefic than petroleum based-

fuels due to several benefits already mentioned in Chapter 1.  

To avoid direct confrontation between food supply and biodiesel production, the 

Timorese lands offer many feedstocks for biodiesel production. Among other existing plants, 

the oleaginous plants like Aleurites moluccana (Am) and Jatropha curcas (Jc) are powerful 

sources for biodiesel production because they exist in abundance and are not used by Timorese 

people as food, even if the Am oil is edible, their seeds can provide circa 30-60 % of oil [269], 

their cultivations do not require arable lands and the harvesting of seeds is done almost twice 

per year.  

For decades Timorese people used the Am (candle nut) tree for preparing traditional 

coffins and the seeds and oil as medicinal and fuel for light. The oil has been used for treating 

burns, therapeutic massages and preventing stretch marks during pregnancy. During the 

Indonesian occupation, the seeds were sent to Indonesia for food purposes. Nowadays, the 

Acelda Company is processing them for cosmetic purposes. Howsoever, crude candlenut oil 

generally contains about 15 % free fatty acids [269]. In terms of the fatty acid profiles, the 

Timorese Am oil has a high percentage of oleic acid (18:1),  linoleic acid (C18:2) and palmitic 

acid (C16:0) [270].  



 

222 
 

Regarding Jatropha, there is plenty of information about it in the literature. It is a non-

edible plant capable of growing in very poor soils or idle lands and its seeds contain circa 30 

% to 40 % of oil. Unlike the Aleurites, Jatropha has not been used much by Timorese people. 

Howsoever, the oil contains about 14 % free fatty acid and in terms of fatty acid profiles it is 

rich of linoleic (C18:2) and stearic (C18:0) acids [271].  

Timor Leste also has abundant coffee plantations especially in the occidental part of 

the country. It has been crucial to the country’s overall economy and has served as the primary 

source of income for about 25 % of the country’s population [65]. However, some works 

already addressed the use of coffee waste oil or defective beans oil for biodiesel production 

[272, 273]. The main constituents of coffee oil are C16:0 and C18:2 [273]. This fact will value 

the Timorese coffee in the international market.  

The specific objective of this work was to synthesize biodiesels from the oils of 

Jatropha, Aleurites moluccana and coffee waste and to evaluate, on one hand, if their fuel 

properties were comparable with those established in the standards and, on the other hand, 

could be acceptably estimated using the predictive models previously proposed in Chapter 3.  

 

5.2. Production of biodiesel from oils of Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha 

curcas and coffee waste  

 

5.2.1. Experimental section 

 

5.2.1.1. Materials 

Oils of Am and Jc were obtained by solid-liquid extraction of the corresponding seeds 

in a Soxlet unit with 250 mL of n-hexane. The seeds were obtained directly from Timor Leste. 

CW oil was obtained by the same process from the wastes collected at the University of 

Aveiro. Absolute methanol (CH3OH) (99.9 % quoted purity from Lab-Scan Analytical 

Science), sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) (95 % quoted purity from Aldrich) sulfuric acid 

(H2SO4) (95 % quoted purity from Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (85 % quoted 



 

223 
 

purity from Panreac) were available at our Laboratory. The two potential feedstocks for 

biodiesel production are shown in Figure 3.1.

(right image) 

 

5.2.1.2. Determination of free fatty acids (FFA) level 

Before performing the synthesis of biodiesel, the level of free fatty acids (FFA) of the 

oils was first determined by acid-base titration in order to formulate an adequate reaction for 

biodiesel production. So 0.4 g of oil was dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol and titrated in 

duplicate with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The FFA level was then calculated using the 

equation 5.1 or 5.2

Where V is the sodium hydroxide solution consumed in the titration (mL), N is the normality 

of the potassium hydroxide solution, W is the weight of oil sample (g) and Mw the molecular 

weight (g/mol). The FFA level was expressed as oleic acid or linoleic acid because these fatty 

acids are dominant in the oils studied. The FFA levels, expressed as oleic acid, were 7.0 % for 

Am oil and 4.0 % for coffee waste oil. The FFA value of the Am oil is not as high as that 

reported by Harry et al [269], but is far above the threshold of the alkali-catalysed 

transesterification reaction, meaning that the synthesis of biodiesel must involve at least one 

step of esterification reaction.    

 



 

224 
 

5.2.1.3. Synthesis of biodiesel 

The production of biodiesel from these oils followed the methodology of Ghadge et al 

[228] as this methodology starts with at least two steps of esterification reactions in order to 

reduce the FFA level of the oil to a permissible value for the transesterification reaction. So 

the whole process occurred in three steps: two esterifications reactions and one 

transesterification reaction. The experiments were carried out in a 250 mL three necked round 

flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The flask was 

initially filled with oil and heated to the desired reaction temperature. Then the catalyst 

dissolved in methanol was added to the flask to start the reaction.  

The esterification reactions occurred at 60 ºC using of 1 % in volume fraction of H2SO4 

and 45 % (v/v) of methanol. Each esterification step took place during circa 2 h. After that, the 

reaction was stopped and the upper-phase containing the remaining methanol, glycerol and 

catalyst was removed from the mixture in a separating funnel. The lower phase was used as 

feedstock for further step of esterification reaction.  

The transesterification reaction also occurred at 60 ºC using 1 % (w/v) of sodium 

methoxide as catalyst and 35 % (v/v) of methanol during 24 h under methanol reflux. The 

reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction 

conversion. After this period, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 % (v/v) of phosphoric 

acid with 85 % of purity. The final mixture was then separated in two phases in a separating 

funnel. The upper phase (biodiesel) was then purified by washing with hot distillated water 

until a neutral pH was achieved and then dried in the oven during more than 2 h.  

Four different biodiesels were produced from oils of: Am, Jc, Am +Jc and Am+CW. 

The biodiesel production from pure CW oil was not performed due to the confusing 

visualization (black color) in the phase separation.   

 

5.2.1.4. Determination of FAME composition 

The FAME composition in biodiesel samples was analysed by gas chromatography 

following the same procedures described in Chapter 3. The yield of the FAME obtained after 



 

225 
 

the reaction was estimated using the equation 5.3 where wi is the mass fraction and mFAME is 

the mass of FAME i and mBD is the mass of biodiesel.

5.2.1.5. Measurement of density, viscosity and surface tension 

Only three physical properties were here used to evaluate the ability of the models 

described in Chapter 3 for description of density, viscosity and surface tension. Density and 

viscosity were measured in the temperature range of 288.15 to 368.15 K and at atmospheric 

pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational Stabinger Viscometer following 

the same procedure described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The surface tensions were measured at 

temperature from 293.15 to 343.15 for two pure biodiesels (Am and Jc) using a Nima 

Dynamic Surface Tensiometer, model DST9005, with a procedure described in Section 3.4.  

5.2.2. Predictive models 

The models chosen here to predict the density, viscosity and surface tension were the 

revised GCVOL method, the revised Yuan’s model and the Knotts Parachors’s model, 

respectively. Only these models were chosen to use here because they provided very good 

predictions of the experimental data of these properties for several biodiesels as highlighted in 

Chapter 3.

a)
 Biodiesel Jc + Am contains 25 mL of Jc oil and 35 mL of Am oil. Biodiesel Am + Cw contains 45 mL of Am oil 

and 15 mL of CW oil 

The FAME profiles of the oils are very similar to those reported in the literature. The 

composition of Jc oil is similar to that studied by Berchmans et al [274] and by Tiwari et al 

[271]. The composition of Am oil is also not so different from other Timorese samples studied 

by Ako et al [270] (these authors have studied the fatty acid profiles of different Am oils from 

Timor Leste). All the samples have C18:1 and C18:2 as major constituents. The slight 

differences in the composition between them may due to the rainfall, latitude or genetics and 

not due to the differences of processing procedures.  

To verify if the biodiesels here produced had acceptable fuel properties, their density 

and viscosity where compare with the values established for biodiesel standards. Table 5.2 

shows the properties of these biodiesels are within the limits.

The experimental data of density, viscosity and surface tension of biodiesels are 

presented in Tables 5.3 and 5.4. The data show that the most unsaturated biodiesel presents 

high values of density and surface tension and low values of viscosity. This result is literally 

expected because the first two properties increase with the level of unsaturation while the last 

decreases with this parameter as already shown elsewhere by Pratas et al [151, 152]. So, at the 

same temperature, it is seen that Am biodiesel, being less saturated, presents density and 

surface tension higher than those of Jc biodiesel while this presents viscosity higher than that.  

Any disagreement between the values of biodiesel surface tensions may be due to the 

experimental error.

) The measurement of surface tension was not possible for biodiesel Am+CW 

Due to the lack of information about the properties of Am biodiesel in the literature, 

only the experimental data of Jc biodiesel were used for comparative purposes. So the density 

and the viscosity of this biodiesel were compared to those reported by Veny et al [132], 

Baroutian et al [276] and Kumar et al [277]. Although the FAME composition is different for 

the Jc samples analysed, their densities are quite similar. Figure 5.2 shows the deviations 

between our data and the literature that where it is seen that the deviations are practically 

stable in the range of temperatures studied with a maximum of ± 0.4 %. Regarding the 

viscosity, the comparison was also done and our data seems to be coherent with that reported 

by Chhetri et al [227] (OARD of 6 %) but significantly different from those reported by 

Baroutian et al [276] (OARD obtained is circa 11 %).

To fulfill the objective of this work, the experimental data of density, viscosity and 

surface tension were used to asses respectively the ability of the revised GCVOL group 

contribution method, the revised Yuan’s model and the Knotts’ parachor model. The results 

show that the models predicted very well the experimental data of these properties, presenting 

only OARDs of 0.33 % for density, 3.8 % for viscosity and 1.8 % for surface tension as shown

The binary mixture of Am biodiesel with Jc biodiesel, at the same proportion, was also 

here studied. The objective of measuring its properties was to evaluate the ability of the Ideal 

mixture mixing rules and the Grundberg Nissan mixing rules for computing density and 

viscosity. The experimental and predicted data are presented in Figure 5.8 where it is seen 

that the data matched very well each other.

5.3. Conclusions 

 

Four methylic biodiesels were here produced from the oils endogenous of Timor Leste 

and their density, viscosity and surface tension were measured and predicted with the revised 

GCVOL group contribution method, the revised Yuan’s model and the Knott’s parachors 

model, respectively. The properties of biodiesels produced were within the standards and the 

predictions with the models were better for density and very acceptable for viscosity and 

surface tension.  The OARDs obtained were 0.33 % for density, 3.8 % for viscosity and 2.1 % 

for surface tension.

General conclusions 

 
The key objectives of this thesis were achieved, i.e., it was able to produce/process 

biodiesel from resources endogenous of Timor Leste and to study measurement/modeling of 

the thermodynamic properties of biodiesels, vegetable oils and alkyl esters. 

Considering the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel, the production of multiphase lipase 

fermentation of Bacillus sp. ITP-001 was done. It was possible to improve the lipase 

production using oxygen vectors and good inducers. At the optimum production conditions 

(200 rpm and 20 % oxygen vector), perfluorodecaline increased the lipase activity to circa 4-

fold, n-dodecane by about 11 % and silica A by about 29 %. Without oxygen vector, coffee 

waste oil was the best inducer. But in presence of perfluorodecaline, coconut oil was the better 

inducer.  

In the study of the thermodynamic properties, new experimental data for various 

properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure and speed of sound for 

esters and biodiesel were provided. For vegetable oils only high-pressure densities were 

measured. Howsoever, various predictive models capable of describing well these 

experimental data in a wide range of temperatures and pressures were recommended. For 

density, the revised GCVOL method is the most suitable for both biodiesel and vegetable oils. 

For the latter, the model of Zong and Halvorsen also reveal to be good. For viscosity, the 

model of Yuan is recommended as it describes very well the viscosity of biodiesels. For 

surface tension, the model of Mac-Sugden using the parachors of Knotts and the CPA model 

are recommended. For vapor pressure, the model of Yuan and CPA are the most suitable. For 

speed of sound, various models are suitable from ideal mixture mixing rules, modified 

Auerbach to Wada’s model. 

The description of density and speed of sound of biodiesels at pressures up to 200 MPa 

were also studied using a quadratic dependence of these properties on pressure. But at pressure 

up to 45 MPa, the linear approach using extensions of the models recommended above for 

these properties is acceptable. 



 

236 
 

The modeling of thermodynamics with Soft-SAFT EoS was also done with success. 

This EoS revealed to be adequate for predicting several properties of fatty esters and 

biodiesels at wide range of temperature and pressures. 

The production of biodiesel from Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas and coffee 

grounds was successfully studied. Their basic properties such as density and viscosity were 

shown to conform with the standards. The experimental data of these biodiesels plus those of 

ethylic biodiesels produced from non-edible resources were used to test the adequacy of the 

models recommended above and the results were acceptable. Models of density, viscosity and 

surface tension were able to describe the experimental data of biodiesels produced. Only the 

model of viscosity does not describe very well the viscosity of some ethylic biodiesels, but the 

magnitude of the corresponding deviations is not very different from that obtained with other 

models not addressed in this work. 



 

237 
 

Final Remarks and Future Works 

The main reason for having included the chapter 2 (production of lipase by Bacillus 

sp. ITP-001) in this thesis was to use lipase as catalyst in the enzymatic transesterification 

of biodiesel. Unfortunately, the processing of lipase did not achieve the final stage. The 

fermentation broths from bioreactor were only posteriorly purified but not dried nor 

immobilized for further use in transesterification reactions. Consequently the enzymatic 

synthesis of biodiesel was not performed. So the processing of lipase from the fermentation 

broths that includes the lyophilization and immobilization on chemical or physical supports 

can be an interesting future work in this field.  

Regarding the modeling of thermodynamic properties, many basic fuel properties 

of biodiesels were studied especially at atmospheric pressure. The calculations of heat of 

combustion of biodiesels were not concluded and could not be included in this thesis. 

These works can also be done in near future. Moreover, given the high adequacy of soft-

SAFT equation of state to describe the high-pressure densities and viscosities of biodiesel 

fuels, it is recommended to continue modeling with this EoS other properties of methylic 

or ethylic biodiesel fuels like surface tension and vapor pressure both at atmospheric 

pressure and mainly at high pressure.  

Finally, to better analyze the fuel properties of biodiesel fuel, some other properties 

beyond those already studied here must also be evaluated. The analysis of oxidation 

stability, quality of emissions and biodegradability can be a future work of great relevance. 

The biodiesels from the resources endogenous of Timor Leste were here produced and 

their properties were analysed, but, for the practical applications, the study about them 

must be extended. In the future one can blend them with diesel fuels to study the 

outcoming properties as fuel. The production plant of biodiesel can also be simulated with 

some simulation tools like Aspen.
