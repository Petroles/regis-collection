1. INTRODUCTION

The South Portuguese Zone (SPZ) represents the
southern branch of the Iberian Variscides (Figure 1). It is
almost entirely composed of Upper Palaeozoic sedimen-
tary rocks of late Devonian to the Moscovian (Late
Carboniferous) age. The following geological domains
are recognized in the SPZ (OLIVEIRA, 1990): the Pulo do
Lobo Antiform, the Iberian Pyrite Belt, the Baixo
Alentejo Flysch Group and the Southwest Portugal
(Bordeira and Aljezur Anticlines).

The boundary between the Pulo do Lobo Antiform
and the Ossa Morena Zone, a major shear zone, is in
several places underlined by the Beja-Acebuches
Ophiolite, a remnant of an oceanic realm closure. The
Pulo do Lobo Antiform is currently interpreted as a
Variscan palaeo-accretionary prism (OLIVEIRA, 1990).
The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) was part of a late Devonian

shallow siliciclastic sea that underwent crustal extention
during the late Devonian (Strunian) and the lower
Carboniferous giving rise to an impressive bimodal
volcanism. Related with this volcanism near 90 massive
sulphide deposits were formed. The Baixo Alentejo
Flysch Group (BAFG) is composed of southwestward
prograding sandy turbidites of Late Viséan to Moscovian
age that filled a foreland basin. Finally, the Southwest
Portugal Sector (SWPS) still part of the siliciclastic sea
during the late Devonian, evolved to a distal carbo-
nate/shale platform that only during the Moscovian
became part of the Variscan orogeny.

The rock succession of the SPZ attracted researchers,
particularly exploration companies, because of its famous
IPB polymetallic massive sulphides ore deposits (e.g.,
the world class Neves Corvo deposit). Geological research
was mainly concentrated on lithostratigraphy, petrology
and geochemistry. More recently, biostratigraphy, sedi-

mentary geology, physical volcanism and sediment
geochemistry deserved more attention and are now
current fields of research.

Palynological studies of the SPZ extend back to
1980s. Palynostratigraphy was for the first time tested in
several units of the SPZ as part of a mapping pro-
gramme carried out by the Portuguese Geological
Survey (OLIVEIRA et al., 1986; CUNHA &amp;amp; OLIVEIRA,
1989). At that time palynostratigraphic work was also
undertaken in the Spanish sector of the Pulo do Lobo
Antiform (GIESE et al., 1988; LAKE, 1991). In the following
years more focussed projects on the biostratigraphy were
developed.

Palynostratigraphy represents the best tool to date the
SPZ lithostratigraphic units, allowing reliable stratigraphic
correlations across the basins and giving support to struc-
tural, palaeogeographic and geodynamic interpretations.
This paper presents an overview of all results recently
achieved in palynostratigraphic research of selected
sections all over the SPZ. The palynology data has allowed
the establishment of the general chronostratigraphic
correlation chart for all the domains of the SPZ (Figure 2).

2. METHODS

The studied samples were collected in complete
outcrop sections, boreholes and occasionally spot
samples. In the IPB, where a large number of boreholes
are available, drilled by mining and exploration compa-
nies and by the Portuguese Geological Survey. Samples
were preferably collected from cores and in a few cases
samples were also collected from the mine addits (e.g.,
Neves Corvo and Aljustrel). In the SW Sector samples
were mainly collected along the costal sections of the
area.

Biostratigraphic research is based on palynomorphs
and standard palynological laboratory procedures were
employed in the extraction and concentration of the
palynomorphs from the host sediments (WOOD et al.,
1996). The slides were examined with transmitted light,
per BX40 Olympus microscope equipped with an
Olympus C5050 digital camera facility. All samples,
residues and slides are stored in the Geological Survey of
Portugal (LNEG – LGM). The miospore biozonal
scheme used follows the standard Western Europe
Miospore Zonations (after: CLAYTON et al., 1977;
CLAYTON 1996; CLAYTON et al., 2003; HIGGS et al., 1988;
HIGGS et al., 2000; MAZIANE et al., 2002; OWENS, 1996;

OWENS et al., 2004; STREEL et al., 1987; STREEL, 1996).
The choice of alternative schemes was stated by the presence
of very consistent local miospore assemblages in South
Portugal. The defined zonal taxa used for the latest
Devonian and Carboniferous of the South Portuguese
Zone are presented in Figure 2. Stratigraphically impor-
tant and typical taxa are illustrated in Plates I and II.

3. GEOLOGICAL SETTING
AND PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHIC
FRAMEWORK OF SPZ

This section deals with the stratigraphic palynology
of all sections, boreholes and spot samples studied by the
authors. Description of the new palynological data is
presented here. In case of previously published data only
a brief review is presented.

3.1. Pulo do LoboAntiform

The Pulo do Lobo Domain is an antiformal structure
located in the northern part of the SPZ, wher it is in direct
contact with the Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ). In the core
of the structure crops out the Pulo do Lobo Fm. and is
composed of phyllites, quartzites, minor felsic volcanics
and amphibolites (former basalts) with MORB-type
geochemical affinity at the lower part (MUNHÁ, 1983;
EDEN, 1991; QUESADA et al., 1994).

In the north limb of the structure, the Ferreira-Ficalho
Group (Figure 3) includes from base to top the following
units (CARVALHO et al., 1976; OLIVEIRA et al., 1986;
GIESE et al., 1988; OLIVEIRA, 1990; EDEN, 1991;
QUESADA et al., 1994): the Ribeira de Limas Fm. is
composed of phyllites, quartzwakes and minor intercala-
tions of tuffites with a tectonic deformation similar to
that of the Pulo do Lobo Fm.; the Santa Iria Fm. is made
up of greywackes, siltstones and shales, forming a
flysch-like succession; and the Horta da Torre Fm. is
composed of dark shales, impure sandstones, siltstones
and quartzite beds with strong bioturbation. The Santa
Iria and Horta da Torre Fms. are affected by a main fold-
ing phase with associated cleavage. The group thickness
is unknow, but estimated at 500 m.

The south limb of the structure is represented by the
Chança Group (Figure 3), which comprises the following
units (PFEFFERKORN, 1968; SILVA, 1989; CUNHA &amp;amp;
OLIVEIRA, 1989; OLIVEIRA, 1990; SILVA et al., 1990): the

Devonian and Carboniferous palynostratigraphy of the South Portuguese Zone, Portugal – An overview 57

Atalaia Fm. composed mostly of phyllites and quartzites,
sharing with the Pulo do Lobo Fm. the same type of
tectonic deformation; the Gafo Fm. made up of a thick
pile of greywackes siltstones and shales forming a flysch
succession, with intercalations and intrusions of felsic
and mafic volcanics showing two main episodes of NW
trending folds and related cleavages; and the Represa
Fm. which is composed of siliceous siltstones, shales,
greywackes and minor intercalations of fine volcano-
genic sediments. The group thickness is estimated at
1100 m.

The overall structure has been interpreted as an anti-
cline (SCHERMERHORN, 1971; CARVALHO et al., 1976;
OLIVEIRA et al., 2006; PEREIRA &amp;amp; OLIVEIRA, 2006;

PEREIRA et al., 2006a, b) as an accretionary prism related
to a northward dipping subduction (SILVA et al., 1990;
QUESADA et al., 1994, SILVA, 1998) and as a suspect
terrain (RIBEIRO et al., 1990).

3.1.1. Pulo do Lobo palynostratigraphy

The Pulo do Lobo Antiform units were recently
investigated for palynostratigraphy (PEREIRA et al., 2006,
Figure 2, 3). No age determinations were achieved for
the Pulo do Lobo and Atalaia Fms., probably due to the
high grade of metamorphism that affected these units,
however the sequence is older than early Frasnian. The

Ribeira de Limas and Gafo Fms. revealed the presence of
moderately preserved miospore assemblages assigned to
the BM Biozone of lower Frasnian age. The assemblage
includes Aneurospora greggsii, Chelinospora concinna,
Cristatisporites triangulatus, Cristatisporites sp. cf. C.
inusitatus, Cymbosporites sp., Emphanisporites rotatus,
Geminospora lemurata, Lophozonotriletes sp., Verruco-
sisporites bulliferus, V. premnus and V. scurrus. All
samples contain rare acritarchs and prasinophytes.

The Santa Iria, Horta da Torre and Represa Fms.
yielded well-preserved assemblages of miospores
assigned to the VH Biozone of late Famennian age
(PEREIRA et al., 2006 a,b). The assemblages include abun-
dant Grandispora echinata which indicates the base of
the biozone, together with Ancyrospora sp., Ancyros-
pora? implicata, Apiculiretusispora sp., Auroraspora
macra, Cristicavatispora dispersa, Diducites versabilis,
D. poljessicus, Emphanisporites annulatus, Grandispora
cornuta, G. famenensis, G. gracilis, Plicatispora sp.,
Punctatisporites spp., Retusotriletes planus, R. triangu-
latus, R. rugulatus, Rugospora explicata, R. radiata and
Teichertospora iberica. All samples contain very rich
assemblages of acritarchs and prasinophytes.

The early Frasnian and late Famennian ages of the
Ribeira de Limas/Gafo sequence and Santa Iria-Horta da
Torre/Represa sequences indicate they are separated of
about 14 My. This fact reinforces previous structural
interpretations that suggested the existence of an uncon-
formity between the Santa Iria/Horta da Torre Fms. and
the underlying Ribeira de Limas Fm..

The stratigraphic correlations of these units of both
limbs of this antiform suggests that these were part of
the same sedimentary basin that appears to have been
superimposed over an acretionary prism, now preserved
in the Pulo do Lobo/Atalaia Fm. (PEREIRA et al.,
2006a,b).

3.2. Iberian Pyrite Belt

In general terms, the stratigraphy of the Iberian Pyrite
Belt (Figure 4) consists of two major units, the Phyllite
Quartzite Group (PQG) and the Volcanic-Sedimentary
Complex (VSC). The PQG is dated as late Devonian age
by ammonoids, conodonts and palynomorphs (BOOGAARD,
1967, FANTINET et al., 1976; CUNHA &amp;amp; OLIVEIRA, 1989;
OLIVEIRA et al., 1997; OLIVEIRA et al., 2004, PEREIRA et
al., 2004). The PQG forms the detritic basement and is
composed mostly of phyllites, quartzites, quartzwackes

and shales with intercalations of limestone lenses and
nodules at the upper part of this unit, which as a whole
were laid down in a marine siliciclastic platform. The
thickness is in excess of 200m (base not known). The
VSC is dated as late Devonian to late Viséan age princi-
pally on palynomorphs and rare conodonts (OLIVEIRA,
1990; OLIVEIRA et al., 1997, OLIVEIRA et al., 2004;
PEREIRA et al., 2004). The VSC incorporates several
episodes of intrusive and extrusive volcanism, with
dominant rhyolites, dacites, basalts and minor andesites,
and intercalations of black shales, siltstones, minor
quatzwackes, siliceous shales, jaspers and cherts and a
purple shale member at the upper part of the complex.
The thickness is variable, from few tens of meters to
more than 1000m. The VSC was laid down in a deep
submarine environment.

Regionally the belt is divided into two branches
(OLIVEIRA, 1990): the North and the South branch
(Figure 4). The North branch extends from Palma
(Alcácer do Sal), below the Cenozoic sediments of the
Sado Basin (at the west), to Mina de São Domingos mine
(at the east) (V. OLIVEIRA et al., 1998a, b; MATOS et al.,
1998, 2000, 2003). This branch incorporates both
autochthon sections, where it is possible to identify the
VSC sequence overlain by the Freixial Fm. turbidites,
and allochthon sections composed of several tectonic
sheets that include PQG sediments and VSC volcanics
and sediments. The South branch refers to the rooted
anticlines and extends from the Pomarão Anticline (west
termination of the Puebla de Guzmán Anticline in Spain)
through the Neves Corvo-Rosário Anticline to the Lousal
region (Figure 4). Conformably above the VSC is a
turbidite succession, known as Mértola Fm. which is the
lower unit of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG).

3.2.1. Iberian Pyrite Belt palynostratigraphy

The selected lithostratigraphic sections investigated
for palynostratigraphic purposes are depicted in Figure 4.

In the Northbranch three sections were studied, i.e.,
Albernôa, Serra Branca and Mina de São Domingos.
The palynomorph assemblages were recovered mostly
from drill cores, complemented with outcrop samples.
Within the autochthon successions, moderately preser-
ved miospore assemblages were identified in shales
interbedded in the lower part of the VSC and doubtly in
shales of the PQG (Albernôa). These assemblages are
assigned to the VCo and VH Bizones of late Famennian

age. The VCo assemblage contain the zonal species
Grandispora cornuta and Auroraspora sp., Diducites
spp., Emphanisporites rotatus, Geminospora lemurata,
Punctatisporites sp., Retusotriletes planus, R. rugulatus
and Rugospora radiata. The VH assemblage is defined by
the presence of the key specie, Grandispora echinata and
includes the taxa Auroraspora sp., Diducites poljessicus,
D. versabilis, Emphanisporites rotatus, Geminospora
lemurata, Grandispora cornuta, Punctatisporites sp.,
Retusotriletes phillipsii, R. planus, R. triangulatus,
Rugospora explicata and R. radiata. All assemblages
contain abundant acritarchs and prasinophytes.

Higher in the VSC, palynomorph assemblages
obtained from black shales are assigned to the Pu Biozone
and comprises the zonal species Lycospora pusilla in asso-
ciation with Auroraspora macra, Convolutispora sp.,
Densosporites sp., D. spitsbergensis, D. brevispinosum,
Dictyotriletes castaneaeformis, Discernisporites micro-
manifestus, Knoxisporites cf. triradiatus, Vallatisporites
pusillites, V. galearis, V. verrucosus.

At the top of the autochthon grey shales, siltstones
and thin bedded greywackes of the Freixial Fm. yielded
moderately preserved miospores of the NM Biozone of
mid late Viséan. The NM biozone assemblage is defined
by the presence of the zonal specie Raistrickia nigra and
abundant taxa such as Ahrensosporites sp., Anaplanis-
porites sp., Crassispora trychera, Densosporites sp.,
D. brevispinosum, D. intermedius, Knoxisporites trira-
diatus, Leiotriletes tumidus, Lycospora pusilla,
Microreticulatisporites sp., Vallatisporites vallatus and
Waltzispora sp. In Serra Branca the NM assemblage
recovered from the Freixial Fm. also containes taxa such
as Emphanisporites rotatus, Geminospora sp., Retispora
lepidophyta, Rugospora radiata and Vallatisporites
verrucosus, which are interpreted as reworked miospores
of late Famennian age.

In the allochthon, shales ascribed to the PQG yielded
a moderately to well preserved miospore LN Biozonal
assemblage (Mina de São Domingos section) that
contains Verrucosisporites nitidus, the index species in
association with the taxa Crassispora sp., Densosporites
spitsbergensis, Geminospora lemurata, G. spongiata,
Punctatisporites sp., Retispora lepidophyta, Rugospora
radiata and Vallatisporites sp. with some rare acritarchs
and prasinophytes. Shales of the Represa Fm. contain
well preserved miospore assemblages assignable to the
VH Biozone. The assemblages contain Grandispora echi-
nata the key specie, together with the taxa Ancyrospora
sp., Ancyrospora? implicata, Aneurospora greggsii,

Apiculiretusispora sp., Auroraspora sp., A. solisorta,
Crassispora sp., Cristatisporites triangulatus, Cristicava-
tispora dispersa, Cymbosporites sp., Diducites poljessi-
cus, D. versabilis, Emphanisporites annulatus, E. rotatus,
Geminospora lemurata, Grandispora cornuta, Punctatis-
porites irasus, Retusotriletes sp., R. crassus, Rugospora
explicata, R. radiata and Spelaeotriletes sp.. All samples
enclose very rich assemblages of acritarchs and prasino-
phytes. The fact that the autochthon and the allochthon
both have VH assemblages with strong similarities
implies that were part of the same palaeogeographic realm.

In the South branch research has been concentrated
in the Pomarão anticline, Neves Corvo mine and
Lousal regions, and very recently in the Cercal anticline
(Figure 4).

The most complete palynostratigraphic study under-
taken in the Portuguese sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt
was the investigation of the Neves Corvo mine succes-
sion. All the local rock units were accurately dated, and
so concluded a long standing stratigraphic controversy
and providing a major contribution to the interpretation
of the local tectonic structure and ore genesis (OLIVEIRA
et al., 1997; PEREIRA et al., 2001; PEREIRA et al., 2004;
OLIVEIRA et al., 2004). This study allowed the following
main conclusions:

(1) The age of the PQG is late Famennian based on
moderately to well preserved miospore assemblages
assigned to the VCo and VH Miospore Biozones. The
VCo Biozone assemblage includes the type species
Grandispora cornuta and abundant specimens of
Auroraspora macra, Cristatisporites triangulatus,
Diducites versabilis, D. poljessicus, Emphanisporites
annulatus, Geminospora lemurata, Retusotriletes planus,
R. triangulatus, R. rugulatus and Rugospora radiata.
Reworked Frasnian miospores (Cristatisporites sp.,
Contagisporites optivus, Aneurospora greggsii, Verruco-
sisporites premnus and V. scurrus) are well represented
in the VCo studied assemblages. The VH Biozone is
marked by the abundant presence of Grandispora echi-
nata together with Ancyrospora sp., Auroraspora macra,
Cristatisporites triangulatus, Grandispora cornuta,
Emphanisporites annulatus, Geminospora lemurata,
Retusotriletes planus, R. triangulatus, Raistrickia vari-
abilis, Rugospora radiata, Spelaeotriletes sp. and
Vallatisporites pusillites. Acritarchs and prasinophytes
are well represented in the assemblages. Reworked
Frasnian miospores are also documented in the VH
assemblages;

(2) The age of the VSC ranges from the late Strunian
to early late Viséan. The LN, TS and NL Miospore
Biozones are identified. The LN Biozone is marked by
the presence of well preserved and abundant specimens
of Auroraspora macra, Densosporites spitsbergensis,

nata, Knoxisporites literatus, Leiotriletes struniensis,
Retispora lepidophyta, Retusotriletes incohatus, Rugos-
pora radiata, Tumulispora malevkensis, Vallatisporites
pusillites and Vallatisporites verrucosus together with
the index species Verrucosisporites niditus. Rare speci-
mens of Aratrisporites saharaensis also occur.
Acritarchs and prasinophytes are very common in the
assemblage. The TS Biozone is defined by the presence
of the key species Knoxisporites triradiatus and K.
stephanephorus. Other taxa present include Anapicula-
tisporites sp., Convolutispora nigrata, Densosporites
rarispinosus, Diatomozonotriletes sp., Dictyotriletes
propius, Hymenozonotriletes caperatus, Knoxisporites
hederatus, Microreticulatisporites concavus, Propris-
porites sp., Spelaeotriletes pretiosus, S. arenaceus,
Vallatisporites pusillites and V. galearis. Reworked
Tournaisian palynomorphs are present. The NL Biozone,
a local biozone defined by the fist occurrence of
Raistrickia nigra (see the details described in the SSP
below). Other taxa include Convolutispora sp.,
Densosporites rarispinosus, D. annulatus, Diatomo-
zonotriletes sp., Knoxisporites hederatus, K. triradiatus,
K. stephanephorus, Leiotriletes sp., Lycospora pusilla,
Microreticulatisporites concavus, Proprisporites sp. and
Vallatisporites ciliaris;

(3) The Mértola Fm. flysch sediments yielded poorly
to moderately preserved miospores assemblages assigna-
ble to the Biozones NL, SN and NC Miospore Biozones
of the late Viséan. The NL Biozone includes the guide
species Raistrickia nigra and also common specimens of
Densosporites rarispinosus, D. annulatus, Diatomo-
zonotriletes sp., Knoxisporites hederatus, K. triradiatus,
K. stephanephorus, Leiotriletes sp., Lycospora pusilla,

morphs were also determined. The SN Biozone, a local
zone, was defined by the presence of abundant
Anaplanisporites baccatus, Densosporites intermedius,
D. brevispinosus, Lycospora pusilla, Knoxisporites trira-
diatus, K. stephanephorus; Raistrickia nigra, Savitrispo-
rites nux and rare Rotaspora fracta, Diatomozonotriletes
sp. and Triquitrites marginatus. The NC Biozone is

characterized by the first occurrence of Bellispores
nitidus together with abundant species of Crassispora
maculosa, Convolutispora venusta, Diatomozonotriletes
sp., Dictyotriletes sp., Leiotriletes tumidus, Rotaspora
fracta and Savitrisporites nux. In the entire studied NC
assemblages reworked Strunian and Tournaisian
miospores are common. The Mértola Fm. also yielded
the goniatites Goniatites hudsoni and G? globostriatus of
late Viséan A age and Arnsbergites arnsbergensis,
Arnsbergites falcatus and Hibernicoceras, which indi-
cate the late Viséan B confirming the results provided by
the palynomorphs in the Neves Corvo mine region
(Oliveira et al., 2004);

(4) Three stratigraphic hiatuses are recognized,
embracing the early to middle Strunian, the Tournaisian
and the early Viséan. These hiatuses appear related to a
southwestward progressive unconformity;

(5) Precision of the biostratigraphic dating of the
massive sulphide orebodies that are intercalated in latest
Famennian (late Strunian) black shales. These age deter-
minations proved that all of the lithostratigraphic units
are involved in a pile of tectonic sheets (Figure 4).

The Pomarão anticline exposes a complete lithos-
tratigraphic section of the Portugueses Pyrite Belt
(Figure 4). Here, only shales of the lower part of the
sequence (Nascedios Member of the PQG) yielded
miospores assigned the LL Biozone of late Strunian age
(OLIVEIRA et al., 2006). Assemblage comprises mode-
rately preserved specimens of Auroraspora sp., Diducites
sp., Emphanisporites rotatus, Knoxisporites literatus,
Retispora lepidophyta and Retusotriletes sp., rare acri-
tarchs and prasinophytes are also present. The overlying
VSC is composed of three volcanic episodes and
interbedded sediments. Until now no biostratigraphic age
was obtained for VSC succession.

In the Lousal/Azinheira de Barros/Mina da
Caveira region the Pyrite Belt develops complex antifor-
mal structures. The age of the lithostratigraphic units is
still poorly constrained. Only shales of the PQG,
recovered from a road cut north of Azinheira de Barros
village provided a moderately preserved miospore
assemblage that contains Verrucosisporites nitidus, the
index species and the following taxa Crassispora sp.,
Densosporites spitsbergensis, Geminospora lemurata, G.
spongiata, Punctatisporites sp., Retispora lepidophyta,
Rugospora radiata and Vallatisporites sp. that indicate
the LN Biozone. The VSC shows two main volcanic

suites: one dominated by felsic volcanics, shales and
intrusive diabases; the other composed mostly of basic
volcanics and intrusives. The VSC suite is followed by
the Mértola Fm. turbidites that yielded a moderately
preserved miospore association Crassispora sp.,
Densosporites spp., Lycospora pusilla, Microreticula-
tisporites concavus, Proprisporites sp. and Waltzispora
planiangulata, in association to the nominal species
Raistrickia nigra. This assemblage is assigned to the NL
local Biozone of mid late Viséan.

Palynostratigraphic research in the Cercal anticline
(westernmost Iberian Pyrite Belt) is currently being studied.
The lithostratigraphic sequence is still poorly constrained
in terms of lithology and age, and only very recent and
limited data is available. The investigated Elf Aquitaine
boreholes, located in the antiform central sector, SW of
Salgadinho, revealed the VSC Cercal felsic volcanics, a
large sequence (&gt;250m) of dark grey shales, with siltitic
intercalations and minor quartzwakes and quartzites.
These shales yielded very well preserved specimens of
Grandispora echinata together with Ancyrospora spp.,
Apiculiretusispora sp., Auroraspora macra, Cristicava-
tispora dispersa, Diducites poljessicus, D. mucronatus,
D. versabilis, Emphanisporites annulatus, Grandispora
cornuta, Punctatisporites spp., Retispora macroreticu-
lata, Retusotriletes phillipsii, R. planus, R. triangulatus,
R. rugulatus, Rugospora explicata and R. radiata. This
assemblage indicates the VH Biozone of late Famennian
age. All samples studied contain rich assemblages of
acritarchs and prasinophytes. This assemblage is similar
to those described for the Neves Corvo and Mina de São
Domingos mines (Pereira 2006a,b inc. ref.). No Carboni-
ferous palynomorph assemblages have been identified
until now. This data confirm the antiform Cercal struc-
ture and will be compared with the upper sequences of
the VSC, located in the eastern and western antiform
sectors.

In the Spanish region of Gerena, in the eastern part of
the ValVerdedelCaminoAnticline, the PQG was dated
early Frasnian base on a moderate preserved assemblage
of miospores that includes Chelinospora concinna,
Cristatisporites triangulatus, Geminospora lemurata,
Retusotriletes rugulatus, Aneurospora greggsii and
Verrucosisporites scurrus (LAKE, 1991; GONZALEZ et al.,
2004; GONZALEZ, 2005). These assemblages are analo-
gous to those recovered in the Pulo do Lobo Antiform
(Ribeira de Limas and Gafo Fms.) and also the reworked
assemblage recovered in the upper part of the PQG in the
Neves Corvo mine region.

3.3. The BaixoAlentejo Flysch Group

The Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) comprises
mostly gravity flow sediments that form a continuous and
southward prograding unit (Figure 1). Sedimentological
and palaeontological data of the GFBA indicate it consists
of three formations, the Mértola, Mira, and Brejeira
Formations (OLIVEIRA etal., 1979; OLIVEIRA, 1983; OLIVEIRA
&amp;amp; WAGNER-GENTIS 1983). The stratigraphic palynology
of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group, although still very
incomplete, has been provisionally established. The
miospore ages are consistent with ammonoid data recov-
ered from all the BAFG units (KORN, 1997).

Mértola Formation

The Mértola Fm. was studied for palynomorphs in
several regions: such as the Neves Corvo mine, Mértola
town, Azenhas section in Guadiana River, Bens Farm,
and are give a late Viséan age (OLIVEIRA et al., 2007;
PEREIRA et al., 2007). Three miospores biozones of late
Viséan age are identified: the NL and SN Biozones,
defined as local Miospore Biozones (see the details
described in the SWSP below) based respectively on the
first occurrence of the index species Raistrickia nigra
and Savitrisporites nux, and the NC Biozone (recognized
only at the Neves Corvo mine region) based on the first
appearance of the key species Bellispores nitidus.

Mira Formation

The age of Mira Fm. is late Viséan to early Bashkirian,
based on the ammonoids Dombarites, Lyrogoniatites and
Cravenoceras (OLIVEIRA et al., 1979; KORN, 1997).
Palynostratigraphic data are scarce at the present time and
are only restricted to black shale samples obtained in the
Castro Marim region. These samples yielded late Viséan
NC miospore Biozone assemblages that contain the key
species Bellispores nitidus.

Brejeira Formation

The youngest unit of the BFGA is the Brejeira Fm.
The palynostratigraphic study of this unit revealed 6
miospore biozones, ranging from the Bashkirian to late
Moscovian (PEREIRA 1997; 1999; Figure 5, 6). These
miospore ages are consistent with the local ammonoid
biozonation (KORN, 1997).

64 Z. PEREIRA, J. MATOS, P. FERNANDES &amp;amp; J. T. OLIVEIRA

The base of the Brejeira Fm., in the north part of its
outcrop area indicates the FR miospore Biozone of the
mid Bashkirian age, which contains the index specie
Reticulatisporites reticulatus and the Dyctiotriletes
probireticulatus in the upper part of the zone. Further
south, miospore assemblages are successively assigned
to the following: SS Biozone characterized by the index
specie Cirratriradites saturni; Ra Biozone assemblage
containing Radiizonates aligerens; Ra/NJ biozonal
boundary was only identified in Pincho Road section and
is marked by the first occurrence of Florinites junior; the
SL Biozone was identified based on the first appearance
of Torispora securis, the presence of Cadiospora
magna and upper in the series by the incoming of the
index taxa Raistrickia aculeata; the OT Biozone is

marked by the occurrence of Thymospora psedothies-
senii, and the common presence of T. obscura and T.
thiessenii. This distribution of the palynological assem-
blages, confirms the southwestward progradation of the
turbidites. The Variscan tectonic deformation in this
sector is Kasimovian in age.

3.4. Southwest Portugal Sector (SPS)
(Bordeira andAljezurAnticlines)

The stratigraphic succession of this sector was given
in OLIVEIRA et al. (1985), OLIVEIRA et al. (1986), RIBEIRO
et al. (1987), PEREIRA (1997, 1999) and KORN (1997).
Four successive formations were identified in SPS, from

Fig. 6 – Geological Map of Aljezur and Bordeira Antiforms in SWPS (Adapt. SILVA et al., 1990).



Devonian and Carboniferous palynostratigraphy of the South Portuguese Zone, Portugal – An overview 65

base to top, the Tercenas, Bordalete, Murração and
Quebradas Formations, of which the latter three are
combined to form the Carrapateira Group (Figure 6).
Detailed palynostratigraphic research has allowed the
establishment of 12 miospore biozones, with 47 late
Devonian and more than 200 Carboniferous miospore
species documented (PEREIRA et al., 1994; PEREIRA et al.,
1995; PEREIRA, 1997; 1999). These palynostratigraphic
results correlate well with the local ammonoids biozona-
tion (KORN, 1997).

Tercenas Formation

The Tercenas Fm. (base unknown) comprises dark
marine shales with interbedded thin sandy tempestites
which grades upward to a 10m thick tidal sandstone
body. Rare clymenids, brachiopods and corals suggest a
late Famennian to early Tournaisian age for this unit
(OLIVEIRA, 1990). The palynological study reveals a
diverse well preserved miospore assemblages assignable
to the LN miospore Biozone of late Strunian age and VI
miospore Biozone of early Tournaisian age (Figure 7). The
LN Biozone is characterized by the common presence of
Densosporites spitsbergensis, Dictyotriletes fimbriatus,
Knoxisporites concentricus, Retusotriletes crassus,
Retispora lepidophyta, Rugospora radiata, Vallatispo-
rites pusillites, Vallatisporites verrucosus, Tumulispora
rarituberculata and the key specie Verrucosisporites
nitidus. All samples suited contain rich assemblages of
acritarchs and prasinophytes.

Bordalete Formation

The Bordalete Fm. is a monotonous succession of
dark grey to black shales and siltstones, which
frequently contain phosphatic nodules. Goniatites are
randomly distributed within the Bordalete Fm., and
being concentrated at certain horizons and where they
belong to only one species, Becanites algarbiensis
(PRUVOST 1914; KORN, 1998). In terms of palynos-
tratigraphy, the Bordalete Fm. allowed the identifica-
tion of the VI, HD and PC Miospore Biozones of
Tournaisian age (Figure 7). The VI miospore Biozone
(recognized in the Eirinhas-Rizada-Penedo Road
section, Monte do Penedo and Pedra Ruiva sections) is
marked by the presence of the index specie
Vallatisporites verrucosus together with the common

presence of Cyrtospora cristifera, Puctatisporites irra-
sus, Retusotriletes incohatus, Secarisporites sp. and
Tumulispora malevkensis. The base of HD biozone,
marked by the first incoming of the index taxa
Cristatisporites hibernicus, identified in the Eirinhas-
Rizada-Penedo Road section, is also characterized by the
first appearance of the distinctive species Umbona-tis-
porites distinctus and Neoraistrickia cymosa. A typical,
diverse and very well preserved PC miospore Biozone
assemblage was recovered from several sections of the
Bordalete Fm. The zone is defined by the presence of the
guide specie Spelaeotriletes pretiosus together with
Auroraspora macra, K. cf. triradiatus, Granulatisporites
microgranifer, Neoraistrickia cymosa, N. logani, Rais-
trickia clavata, Spelaeotriletes balteatus, Vallatisporites
microspinosus, V. vallatus, V. verrucosus, Verrucosis-
porites congestus, V. irregularis and V. nitidus (Figure 7).
At the top of this unit the CM miospore Biozone of late
Tournaisian age is missing, probably due to the presence
of a hiatus. These palynostratigraphic data exclude the
existence of a basal hiatus as previously suggested
(OLIVEIRA et al., 1985).

Murração Formation

The Murração Fm. is composed of two members. The
lower Pedra das Safias Member, has a thickness of 25
metres and is composed of grey shales with rhythmic
marly carbonate and dolomitic intercalations. The
member has yielded a few fragmentary macrofossils of
corals and trilobites, including large but poorly preserved
specimens of Merocanites sp., indicating an early to
middle Viséan age. The upper Vale Figueira Member has a
thickness of 32 metres and is best exposed at the Atlantic
coast, near Carrapateira village. Strongly weathered
successions of the formation also occur in the area of
Aljezur and Bordeira. However in the Quebradas beach
section, the Vale Figueira Member is well exposed and in
non-weathered conditions. Here, it is composed of
dark-grey or black shales, and nodular and sometimes
dolomitic limestones. The sucession contains scarce
benthic faunas, restricted to certain levels characterized
by rare trilobites, brachiopods, echinoderms and rugose
corals. The section is also extremely rich in goniatites
and bivalves such as Posidonia becheri BRONN, 1828, of
late Viséan age. The following goniatite zones were iden-
tified (KORN, 1997): hudsoni Zone (fauna with Goniatites
hudsoni), crenistia Zone (fauna with Beyrichoceras sp.),

spirifer Zone (fauna with Goniaitites spinifer and
Goniatites fimbriatus), gracilis Zone (fauna with Hiber-
nicoceras carraunense) and postriatum Zone (fauna with
Lusitanoceras algarviense). The Murração Fm. has been
interpreted as a deep open-marine, pelagic carbonate
platform in front (to the south) of the flysch basin
(OLIVEIRA et al., 1985; HERBIG et al., 1999).

The palynostratigraphic study of the Murração Fm.
has recognized 5 miospore biozones of Viséan age
(PEREIRA, 1999; Figure 2, 7). The study of the Pedra das
Safias Member proved to be very difficult due to the
strong dolomitization. Only in the Aljezur Anticline, in
the Marianos and Corte da Velha sections (Figure 7),
where the unit has a more shaly character, it has been
possible to identify the base of the Pu miospore Biozone,
based in the first appearance of Lycospora pusilla and the
base of TS Biozone, by the first appearance of
Knoxisporites triradiatus and K. stephanephorus. These
two miospore biozones indicate an early Viséan age for
the Pedra das Safias Member.

The Vale Figueira Member, in Praia das Quebradas
section (Figure 7) has yielded moderately preserved
miospore assemblages assigable to the NL, SN, and NC
Biozones of late Viséan age. Two zones were defined as
local miospore Biozones, the NL (Raistrickia nigra – Pro-
prisporites laevigatus) and SN (Savitrisporites nux)
based respectively, on the first occurrence of Raistrickia
nigra and Savitrisporites nux guide taxa (Figure 2).
These biozones were defined due to the absence of
stratigraphically useful taxa such as Rotaspora spp.,
Tripartites spp. and Triquitrites spp. Nevertheless, the
NL biozone can be correlated with the Raistrickia nigra
– Triquitrites marginatus Miospore Biozone of Western
Europe based in the first appearance of Raistrikia nigra
that occurs at the same level. Proprisporites laevigatus
appears together with the first R. nigra in southwest
Portugal, but in Western Europe the first record of this
specie is much higher, at the top of NC Biozone of late
Viséan to early Serpukhovian (CLAYTON et al., 1977,
CLAYTON, 1996). The SN local biozone can be corre-
lated with the VF miospore Biozone of Western Europe,
based in the first occurrence of Savitrisporites nux. In
Western Europe, in addition to S. nux, the Tripartites
vetustus Biozone is defined by the first appearance of a
group of new species which includes Tripartites vetus-
tus, Tripartites nonguerikei, Rotaspora fracta and R.
knoxi, which are not represented in the late Viséan of
southwest Portugal (CLAYTON et al., 1977; CLAYTON
1996).

The basal part of the NC Biozone is marked by the
presence of the guide species Bellispores nitidus, which
was recognized in the Quebradas Beach section. The
assemblage also contains the species Crassispora
maculosa, Microreticulatus concavus, Propisporites
laevigatus, Raistrickia nigra and S. nux.

The palynostratigraphical evidence indicates that the
entire Viséan may be represented in the Murração Fm.
(PEREIRA 1997, 1999).

Quebradas Formation

The Quebradas Fm. has a thickness of approximately
70 metres and is mainly composed of black shales with
intercalated carbonate and phosphoritic layers, lenses
and nodules (Figure 7). This unit is rich in fossils, and
several carbonatic horizons contain distinctive ammo-
noid assemblages (OLIVEIRA et al., 1985; KORN, 1997).
In a lower horizon, an indistinctive Cravenoceratoides
(?) sp. suggests an Arnsbergian age. Higher up, some of
the goniatite zones between the R1a to G2 are represented
by characteristic goniatites, including Vallites kullmanni
KORN, 1997, Reticuloceras reticulatum (PHILLIPS, 1836),
Reticuloceras coreticulatum BISAT &amp;amp; HUDSON, 1943,
Bilinguites gracilis (BISAT, 1924), Bilinguites metabilin-
guis (WRIGHT, 1927) Cancelloceras cf. crencellatum
(BISAT, 1924), Gastrioceras listeri (SOWERBY, 1812) and
Gastrioceras angustum (PATTEISKY, 1964).

The moderately preserved miospore assemblages
recovered from Quebradas Fm. are assigned to the
Bashkirian KV and FR miospore Biozones. The KV
Biozone is marked by the presence of Crassispora
kosankei. The basal pat of the FR Biozone is defined on
the first occurrence of Reticulatisporites reticulatus
together with common specimens of Crassispora kosankei,
Raistrickia fulva and S. nux (Figure 2). These results fit
well, in terms of age, with the local ammonoid biozona-
tion (KORN, 1997).

CONCLUSIONS

Devonian and Carboniferous palynomorphs are
documented from all the geological domains recognized
in the SPZ. For the first time, an assessment of all of the
palynostratigraphic records obtained in the SPZ are
compared (Figure 2). Twenty three miospore biozones
are identified in the SPZ comprising the identification of



68 Z. PEREIRA, J. MATOS, P. FERNANDES &amp;amp; J. T. OLIVEIRA

more than 150 Devonian miospores and acritarchs species
and more than 200 Carboniferous miospore species
(PEREIRA et al., 2007). Selection of the index species used
for the SPZ is based upon the consistent occurrence of
each taxon in several sections and boreholes.

A number of palynological events recognized in the
Western Europe were identified in the SPZ. These events,
generally defined as the appearance or disappearance of a
single genus or whole complexes of forms, providing
important indicators in the establishment of global zona-
tions (CLAYTON, 1985; CLAYTON, 1996; CLAYTON et al.,
2003; OWENS, 1996; OWENS at al., 2004; STREEL, 1996).
One event has local importance at the scale of SPZ (in
Portugal and Spain) and two events are locally distinct
and are correlated with goniatites control points in the
BAGF and SPS (see figures 2 and 7).

The most important events identified in the Western
Europe and recognized in SPZ are:

(1) The first appearance of Grandispora cornuta,
together with other taxa that typically occur at this level
in SPZ, that includes Retusotriletes phillipsii, Diducites
versabilis and Rugospora radiata. This event, with the
same type assemblage is recognized in Western Europe
and marks the basal part of the VCo Biozone of late
Famennian age (MAZIANE et al., 1999);

(2) First appearance of Grandispora echinata.
Assemblages in the SPZ also typically contain consis-
tently Ancyrospora sp., Cristicavatispora dispersa,
Rugospora explicata and Teichertospora iberica at this
level. It is worth noting that this assemblage is currently
only documented in the SPZ and could represent a local
event. In addition, the appearance of Grandispora echi-
nata occurs immediately before the first inception of
Retispora lepidophyta in SPZ and Western Europe, at the
late Famennian age;

(3) Extinction of Retispora lepidophyta. In Western
Europe this event is approximately at the Devo-
nian/Carboniferous boundary (PAPROTH &amp;amp; STREEL, 1972;
HIGGS &amp;amp; STREEL, 1984);

(4) First appearance of Spelaeotriletes pretiosus,
marking the middle Tournaisian age, in Western Europe;

(5) First appearance of Lycospora pusilla. In Western
Europe it is approximately coincident with the Tournai-
sian/Viséan boundary;

(6) First appearance of Raistrickia nigra, together
with other taxa that typically occur at this level in the
SPZ is Propisporites laevigatus and Densosporites spp..
This event marks the mid late Viséan in SPZ. This data is
confirmed with goniatites;

(7) First appearance of Savitrisporites nux. This
local event is equivalent to the Western Europe first
appearance of Tripartites vetustus Schemel. In the
SPZ, the other taxa that typically occur with the S. nux
are Rotaspora spp. and Grandispora spinosa of late
Viséan age;

(8) Extinction of the characteristic Viséan miospore
species, Raistrickia nigra, Grandispora spinosa, Rotas-
pora spp. and Crassispora maculosa, analogous to the
Viséan/Serpukovian bondary of the Western Europe;

(9) Appearance of the distinctive Bashkirian genus
Reinschospora and increase on Crassispora kosankei,
representative of the early Bashkirian assemblages, similar
to the Western Europe;

(10) First appearance of Radiizonates aligerens, a
type event for the late Westphalian A, in Western Europe.
It is also characterized by the increase of Laevigatos-
porites and Cirratriradites saturni;

(11) First appearance of Torispora genus, marking the
basal Westphalian C, as documented for Western Europe;

(12) First appearance of Thymospora spp. which in
Western Europe marks the basal part of the Westphalian D.

The synopsis of the SPZ palynostratigraphy obtained
from all the geological domains recognized allow the
following conclusions (Figure 2):

1. Early Frasnian miospores assemblages were
recovered from the PQG of the IPB, in Valverde
del Camino Anticline, SW Spain (LAKE, 1991;
GONZALEZ et al., 2004; GONZALEZ, 2005) and
appear as reworked assemblages at the top of this
same Group. These Frasnian assemblages are also
comparable to those found in the Ribeira de Limas
and Gafo Fms. of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform
(PEREIRA et al., 2006).

2. Late Famennian assemblages in SPZ have a
consistent presence of the miospore species
Ancyrospora sp., Cristicavatispora dispersa,
Rugospora explicata and Teichertospora iberica.
These assemblages were recovered from the PQG
and the VSC (IPB) (GONZALEZ et al., 2004;
PEREIRA et al., 2004; 2007) and from the upper
units of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform (Horta da
Torre, Santa Iria and Represa Fms; PEREIRA et al.,
2006a, b).



Devonian and Carboniferous palynostratigraphy of the South Portuguese Zone, Portugal – An overview 69

3. Analogous late Strunian miospore assemblages
were recovered from the IPB, the upper part of the
PQG (CUNHA and OLIVEIRA, 1989; OLIVEIRA et al.,
2004; OLIVEIRA et al., 2005; MATOS et al., 2006),
and the VSC in Spain (GONZALEZ, 2005) and also
from the Tercenas Fm. in Southwest Portugal
(Bordeira and Aljezur Anticlines).

4. Similarities in Upper Devonian miospore assem-
blages, strongly suggest that the Pulo do Lobo, the
IPB basin and the Tercenas Fm. (Southwest
Portugal), were part of the same palaeogeographic
realm during the late Devonian.

5. Records of Tournaisian palynomorphs from the
Bordalete Fm. in Southwest Portugal and
reworked Tournaisian associations in the VSC of
the IPB show the presence of the same taxa.

6. The VSC of the IPB yield miospores of late
Famennian to mid/late Viséan age (OLIVEIRA et al.,
1986; OLIVEIRA et al., 2004; 2005; 2006; PEREIRA
et al., 2006; 2007). Mid/late Viséan assemblages
appear to be very consistent along the SPZ as the
same assemblages are recorded from the BAFG.
