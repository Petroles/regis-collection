INTRODUCTION
In peripheral nerve injury, nervous fibers originate and grow 
from the proximal stump (1). In digital nerves injuries, the 
best outcomes after repair were found in children, showing 
the need of further nervous regeneration studies in adult 
populations(2).
Using a tube for repairing an injured nerve is not new (3). 
Tubes seem to be important for regeneration because they 
comprise neurotrophic substances that help on guiding 
axons towards their distal target (4). The great driver towards 
researches using tubes with veins emerged after experi-
ments in rats showing that the light of veins allows for nerve 
regeneration(5).
In large nervous substance losses, when a vein is used for 
filling the gap, adherences may occur. However, when a vein 
is filled with muscles, these adherences are prevented, and 
there is no fiber dispersion from proximal and distal stumps, 
also enabling the avoidance of fibrosis and blood intake 
improvement(6). 
Based on these data, the present study intended to compare 
the effectiveness of a vein-covered denaturized muscle graft, 

in Wistar rats’ tibial nerves, when compared to traditional 
autogenous graft, using counts of neurons marked with 
Fluoro-Gold®.

MATERIAL AND METHOD
The experimental protocols used in this study have been 
approved by the Committee on Medical Ethics in Research, 
Hospital São Paulo / Federal University of São Paulo, accor-
ding to the International Ethical Guidelines(7).  
Wistar race rats were used, which weighted 155 g in average, 
and kept under controlled conditions with light/dark cycle 
(12/12 h), at a temperature of  21± 2ºC, with water and food 
ad libitum, throughout the experiment period.  
In total, 29 rats were operated, but only 15 could be included 
in the study group, because the others presented compli-
cations during the performance of the various experimental 
procedures, making data quantification difficult.  
The animals were anesthetized with a solution constituted of 
chloral hydrate, magnesium sulfate, thionembutal, propylene 
glycol, ethylene alcohol and 4ml/Kg distilled water.

SUMMARY
The purpose of this work was to study nervous regeneration 
through neurons counts by comparing two surgical techni-
ques for addressing nervous gaps on 15 rats’ lower limbs. 
Initially, a 12-mm long vein tube from the left outer jugular was 
obtained, and then both lower limbs are operated, exposing 
the tibial nerve at each side and performing a resection of 
an 8-mm nerve segment, at the same time simulating a gap 
and an autogenous nerve graft. Left gap repair consisted of 
a usual conventional graft for nervous injury repair by means 
of microsurgical suture. The gap repair on right lower limbs 
was made through quadriceps muscle, treated with liquid 
nitrogen, covered with an 8-mm tube of jugular vein. After

four months, the animals were submitted to a new surgery for 
exposing tibial nerves to the Fluoro-Gold® neuronal marker. 
After 48 hours, the rats were perfused and medullar segment 
between L3 and S1 was removed and subsequently cut into 
40µm sections. Neurons on all sections were counted, and 
no statistical differences were found between both surgical 
techniques.

connecting tributaries and isolating a 12-mm long segment 
(Figure 2). The venous graft was kept soaked into 0.9% saline 
solution until its use.   
The sciatic nerve and its branches (sural, peroneal, and 
tibial) were exposed. The right tibial nerve was dissected 
and manipulated as minimally as possible (Figure 3). An 
8-mm segment was sectioned, leaving a proximal stump 
of approximately 3 mm (Figure 4). The nerve segment was 
maintained in 0.9% saline solution.  
The injury provoked to the left tibial nerve was adjusted by 
interposing the nerve graft removed from the contralateral 
limb and sutured with two epineural nylon 10-0 monofila-
ment stitches.
At the right side, 1 cm of muscle was removed, which was 
kept in liquid nitrogen for performing denaturing(8). The de-
natured muscle was sutured to proximal stump and then 
covered with a vein tube (Figure 5). Once the vein was ac-
commodated on the whole muscle segment, suturing was 
provided with the proximal and distal epineurium so that the 
vein could not be displaced from muscular graft. Muscle and 
skin planes were sutured with 4-0 nylon monofilament.  
After 120 postoperative days, the animals were submitted 
to a new surgery for exposing right and left tibial nerves 
(Figure 6) for performing the neuronal marking with 3% 
Fluoro-Gold® (Fluorochrome Inc.) for subsequent neuron 
count at the anterior spinal cord horn.

The nerve was exposed to dye for 90 minutes. After that time, 
muscle and skin planes were sutured. 
The animals, 48 hours after dye exposure, were anesthetized 
again and then submitted to a transcardiac perfusion by 
means of a port on thoracic box and heart exposure. The 
left ventricle was punctured with a needle and the infused 
solutions were drained by sectioning the right atrium.
During perfusion, the buffered solutions at physiological pH 
phosphate 0.2M and 10% sucrose 10% were used. 
Finished the perfusion, the marrow was removed with the 
aid of a microscope. Laminectomy was initiated at S2 level.

Dorsal roots of L3, L4, L5, L6 and S1 were identified, and 
the L3 and S1 roots’ path was followed up to its entry into 
the marrow, which was cross-sectionally sectioned in order 
to preserve L4, L5 and L6 segment. 

The marrow segment was submitted to a cryoprotection 
process with 20% sucrose and subsequent cutting with a 
freezing microtome, into 40µm sections.
The slides were assembled and analyzed under fluorescent 
microscope. The anterior horn of the spinal cord was asses-
sed and motor neurons were identified (Figure 7). Only the 
cells typically marked with Fluoro-Gold were assessed in 
order to avoid any misinterpretation. From the total of cells, 
the Abercrombie’s(9) adjusting criteria were used for serial 
cuts to microtome.  
As statistical evaluation methods, the following tests were 
used: the paired “t” test, the signaled Wilcoxon’s test and 
the Mann-Whitney’s test.

RESULTS
After neuron counting, results in absolute values were adjus-
ted by using the Abercrombie’s criteria(9) (Table 1).
Motor neurons counting at the anterior spinal cord horn 
For statistical analysis, the paired “t” test was used, where 
it is performed by subtracting both sides of each rat and 
removing its individual effect. Following, the average of di-
fferences reaching zero was tested, showing no difference 
between groups.

The Wilcoxon’s  test was also employed, taking the differen-
ces between each rat’s posts, and the Mann-Whitney’s test, 
working with the averages of each group’s posts, not remo-
ving rats’ individual effects. In these two tests, no statistical 
difference was found as well.

DISCUSSION
We used young (60 days old) Wistar rats because they are 
biologically well known and widely employed in experimental 
assays. That age was selected in order to avoid losing them 
by age-related diseases(10).
Fifteen out of the 29 operated rats were used at the end of 
the study, because during the experiment, some technical 
problems such as animals’ deaths by cardiac-respiratory 
failure during anesthesia, postoperative complications, 
poor fixation or cryoprotection of the tissue, among others, 
made us unable to use the remaining animals. However, as 
a large amount of cells stained in each slide were analyzed, 
this number of animals was enough to find similar data to 
literature (11,12).
The selection of the external jugular vein is because of the 
advantages it presents when compared to the femoral vein. 
Those advantages include: a) a wider diameter - which allows 
a better quality suture and covers stumps’ ends, avoiding 
the development of neuromas at the suture, b) it does not 
have valves - thus avoiding hurdles for axonal growth(13), 
c) vessel length is enough for tubing, and d) it avoids any 
significant tissue damage to rats’ legs - by a double incision 
when addressing the nerve laterally and the venous graft 
medially.  
The tibial nerve was used for two reasons: it reduces cell 
death and mimics peripheral injuries usually found in clinical 
practice. If the sciatic nerve was employed in this study, we 
would be at risk of finding some problems to the rats, typical 
of lower limbs injuries, such as: insensitive parts autophagy 
(10), skin ulcers(11) and difficult upright position stabilization 
allowing the animal to eat. The use of both limbs of the same 
animal was due to individual organic variations of each rat, 
which could compromise results reliability when comparing 
the proposed surgical procedures (10,12).
The selection of an 8-mm size for substance loss was made 
by complying with the limits described in literature, which 
reports that this measure should not exceed 10 mm (14).

Inside the vein graft, a muscle denaturized with liquid nitrogen 
was used(15), because it presents a lower size reduction rate, 
which is 42%, while microwave denaturizing is approximately 
89%(16). Denaturing rate in the muscles employed in this 
study was approximately 20%. This data was obtained by 
measuring values previously and subsequently to denatu-
rizing process.   
The established interval time of 4 months between the first and 
the second surgery is due to the fact that this time is enough 
for nerve regeneration(4), making the study to be more reliable, 
because by doing so, the nerve should not go through age-
related biological changes, thus keeping its original structure. 
Some authors, however, consider 5 months as an optimal time 
interval between procedures (17).  
After tibial nerve section, during the first surgery, the rats showed 
limping on both rear legs, while in the second procedure, they 
showed clinically well and without any atrophies. The dissection 
of the surgical plane was easier on the leg grafted with vein-
covered muscle, which is consistent to literature findings(18). It 
is worthy to highlight that this is an interesting data, enabling 
clinical application in cases where cicatricial response is im-
portant, such as for the treatment of compressive syndromes 
recurrences (19).
For nervous regeneration analysis, we used the Fluoro-Gold® 
as a retrograde neuronal marker at 3% strength, but this may 
range from 2 to 4%. This fluorescent marker enables a direct 
visualization under a microscope, not requiring chromogens 
use, which facilitates experiment reproduction(12).  This direct 
visualization is based on the presence of a marker, retrogra-
dely transported to cell body(20) thus allowing the nerve to be 
represented on marrow.
The negative aspect of using Fluoro-Gold® as a neuronal marker 
lies on the fact that by being illuminated during the analysis, 
fluorescence is progressively reduced, making a reassessment 
of the same slide impossible.  
During transcardiac perfusion, a sucrose solution was used for 
protecting the tissue against freezing aggressions, thus allowing 
a better visualization and analysis of the tissue to be assessed. 
This important step was reported by other authors(10,12).
In order to avoid counting the same cell more than once 

at different sections, the adjustment factor established by 
Abercrombie(9) was employed for 40 µm sections. The results 
were presented as absolute and adjusted values (Table 1), 
but the statistical analysis was made on the basis of adjusted 
values.  
Three statistical tests were used for determining whether 
a significant difference existed or not between employed 
techniques.  
There was no statistically significant difference between the 
methods; therefore, the denatured muscle graft covered with 
vein shows a similar number of marked cells when compared 
to the simple-graft method.   
We have not been able to compare the results of this study 
to literature data, because no correlation was found between 
muscle-and-vein graft in reviewed studies.
Oliveira(14), using a denatured muscle graft compared to a 
conventional nervous graft, found no statistical difference 
between both methods as well.  
Two of the animals employed presented a lower number 
cell count, but the differences between both sides remained 
reasonably proportional, which did not change the statistical 
analysis.   
A combination of a muscle and vain graft was used, based 
on the principle that an injured nerve produces a high amount 
of axon-regenerating substances (11) and the vein, for being 
a tube system with selective permeability, would avoid these 
substances to be spread, facilitating nervous regeneration. 
The denatured muscle would maintain basal membrane, 
acting as a support system for regenerating neurons.  

CONCLUSION
We did not detect statistical differences between the groups 
treated with conventional nervous graft and muscle graft de-
natured with liquid nitrogen covered with autogenous vein.
