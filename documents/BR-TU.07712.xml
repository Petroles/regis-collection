Acknowledgments 

 

I would like to thank Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – 

FAPESP for providing me two scholarships (Proc. FAPESP 2012/0507-6 and 

2014/13386-7) and for funding our research and courses and meetings I attended 

along these years. 

I would also like to thank my admirable advisor, Dr. Mariana Cabral de Oliveira for 

all she did for me and all she does to Brazilian science – you are a true inspiration and 

a whole model. I also thank  Dr. Suzanne Fredericq, who welcomed me in her 

laboratory at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and who made possible for me 

to live, learn and experience a lot more than I never thought I would in my whole life. 

I’ll be forever grateful for all these two great women did for me. 

Dr. Paulo Horta, for always being there for me, for guiding me in the first steps of 

this path and for being such a believer – making of us, his students, to believe too. 

Dr. Rafael Riosmena, a kind and generous soul that shared so much knowledge with 

all of us corallines enthusiastic and unfortunately left us too soon – Rest in Peace Prof 

Rafa.   

I acknowledge all my lab mates, Professors and technicians from LAM (Laboratório 

de Algas Marinhas “Édson José de Paula - University of São Paulo) from present and 

past, an extensive list of awesome people, who were very important and helped me in 

so many ways daily.  Thanks to you all! I especially thank Carolina Azevedo, 

Carolina Franco, Mariana Mungioli, Natália Guimarães, my closest friends, for all the 

emotional support along these years. 

My lab mates from Dr. Fredericq’s Seaweed Lab (University of Louisiana at 

Lafayette - ULL), Joe, Dago, Thomas, Olga, Will and Sherry, awesome people that I 

have the pleasure to meet and learn a lot from. I especially thank Dr. Joseph Richards 

(or simply Joe) for his generosity and patience, and most of all, for all the time he 

spent helping me – I will never be able to thank you enough mate; you are a true 

professor and lucky will be your future students. 

I thank all the good friends I made along the way, people that I’ve had the pleasure to 

meet during conferences, workshops and courses I had the opportunity to attend, and 

with whom I learned a lot from; they are a lot of people and I would not be able to 



 

 

 

name each one, but especially want to thank some of them: Una, Aleisha, Mauricio, 

Katrina, Laurie, Lynn and Marycruz. 

Marina Sissini and Eduardo Bastos for sending me samples; I also thank Sisbiota Mar 

for the samples they sent me. 

Dr. Pablo Riul and Ronei Sarti for helping with the maps. 

Dr. Paul Gabrielson for giving me the topotype sample of Sporolithon episporum. 

Dr. Tom Pesacreta and Mike Purpera for letting me use the SEM and the facilities in 

the microscopy center at the ULL. 

All the security guards and staff and the Professors of the Biosciences Institute, 

especially from the Botany department from the University of São Paulo, who gave 

me support in many ways. 

The University of São Paulo itself. By all means, it was an honor walking through 

this campus, these buildings, these Institutes and classrooms for the last few years. 

My parents Maria and Marcio, my sister Gladys, my brother-in-law Cyro and my 

brother Cristiano. Without them, their support and endless love I would be 

NOTHING. I’ll be forever grateful for all the sacrifices you made to raise me. Not 

everybody knows, but my parents could never actually go to elementary school, but 

they struggled and battled for their children to have a better education and here I am, 

almost a Doctor, thanks to them (and to my sister who paid for my English course, 

who taught me to read and write at the age of 4 and who kept checking my lessons 

and grades over the years). 

And finally, I thank my husband Ivan Martins, for always being by my side, for being 

the best friend and supporter somebody could ask for and for the family we are 

building together – you and our precious baby mean everything to me. Thank you for 

your love and for sharing your life with me.

Resumo 

As algas calcárias crostosas ou CCA (do inglês Crustose Coralline Algae) têm como 

principal característica a impregnação de carbonato de cálcio em suas paredes celulares. 

Este grupo é formado atualmente por três ordens, Corallinales, Hapalidiales e 

Sporolithales, cuja taxonomia é historicamente problemática por se basear na fase 

tetrasporofítica, fundamental para qualquer identificação até mesmo em nível de ordem. 

Em virtude disso, diversos estudos, principalmente nos últimos 10 anos, têm incluído 

ferramentas moleculares como auxílio à taxonomia morfoanatômica deste grupo. 

O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar a diversidade e a distribuição das CCA ao longo 

da costa brasileira, através de dados moleculares e morfoanatômicos. Para isso, foram 

utilizados quatro marcadores moleculares, UPA, rbcL-3P, COI-5P e psbA, aliados à  

imagens de microscopia óptica e microscopia eletrônica de varredura, que resultaram na 

identificação de 38 espécies entre Corallinales, Hapalidiales e Sporolithales.  

Os resultados obtidos a partir das análises de agrupamento dos quatro marcadores 

demonstraram que as ordens Corallinales e Sporolithales são monofiléticas, e 

Hapalidiales constitui um grupo não-monofilético (com exceção do marcador psbA, que 

resolveu a ordem como grupo monofilético). Os resultados também revelaram 

existência de uma grande diversidade de espécies e gêneros destas ordens no Brasil, 

além de espécies novas e ao menos um potencial gênero novo para ciência. O estudo 

também revelou relações filogeográficas entre espécies do Brasil e do Golfo do México 

e do Indo-Pacífico. Considerando as três ordens de CCA (Corallinales, Hapalidiales e 

Sporolithales), este estudo representa a primeira tentativa de desvendar de forma mais 

ampla a diversidade de espécies CCA encontradas ao longo da costa brasileira, 

utilizando dados moleculares.

Abstract 

The Crustose Coralline Algae (CCA) has as a main distinguishing characteristic the 

calcium carbonate impregnation in their cell walls.  This group currently encompasses 

three orders, the Corallinales, Hapalidiales and Sporolithales, whose taxonomy is 

historically problematic because it is based on the tetrasporophytic phase, fundamental 

to any classification, even at the ordinal level. Therefore, many studies, especially in the 

last 10 years, have included molecular tools to assist the morphological taxonomy of 

this group. This study aims to investigate the diversity and distribution of the CCA 

along the Brazilian coast, through molecular and morphoanatomical data.  In order to 

achieve this aim, four markers were used, UPA, rbcL-3P, COI-5P and psbA, allied to 

light and scanning electron microscopy, that resulted in the identification of 38 species 

between Corallinales, Hapalidiales and Sporolithales. The results of the cluster analyses 

of the four markers showed that Corallinales and Sporolithales are monophyletic, and 

Hapalidiales comprises a non-monophyletic group (with the exception of psbA, which 

resolved the order as a monophyly).  Our results also revealed a great diversity of 

species and genera of these three orders in Brazil, as well as putative new species and at 

least a new genus. This study also revealed phylogeographic relationships between 

Brazilian species and species from Gulf of Mexico and from Indo-Pacific oceans.  

Considering all the three orders of CCA, this study represents the first broad attempt 

and effort to unveil the diversity of CCA species found on the Brazilian coast using 

molecular data.

Introdução geral 

As algas calcárias crostosas ou CCA (do inglês Crustose Coralline Algae) têm 

como principal característica a impregnação de carbonato de cálcio em suas paredes 

celulares (Silva &amp;amp; Johansen 1986, Bailey &amp;amp; Chapman 1998), na sua maioria na forma 

de calcita, diferente de outros grupos, nos quais este mineral aparece principalmente na 

forma de aragonita (e. g. Halimeda spp.) (Littler 1976).  

A distribuição das algas calcárias é conhecida em todos os oceanos, dos trópicos 

às regiões polares (Littler et al.1991, Foster 2001, Konar et al. 2006), como um 

constituinte do bentos conspícuo, ou mesmo dominante, particularmente em locais de 

alta herbivoria e hidrodinamismo (Steneck &amp;amp; Paine 1986, Woelkerling 1988). Estas 

algas são comumente encontradas desde a zona entre-marés até grandes profundidades 

(Littler et al.1985, Littler et al. 1991, Foster 2001, Konar et al. 2006), sendo que sua 

ocorrência já foi reportada para aproximadamente 265 m de profundidade (Littler et 

al.1985).  

Em áreas tropicais, por exemplo, as CCA são fundamentais para o 

estabelecimento e construção dos recifes de corais, protegendo esse ecossistema contra 

a ação erosiva das ondas e possibilitando a manutenção e crescimento dos recifes 

(Steneck &amp;amp; Testa 1997, Piller &amp;amp; Rasser 1996).  

Um atributo interessante destas algas é a formação de rodolitos (algas vermelhas 

calcificadas de vida livre que crescem independentes do substrato) formando bancos 

naturais, conhecidos como bancos de rodolitos (ou maërl, ou nódulos calcários) (Irvine 

&amp;amp; Chamberlain 1994, Harvey et al. 2005, Harvey &amp;amp; Woelkerling 2007). Esses bancos 

formam um ecossistema único que abriga grande diversidade de outras algas, 

3 



invertebrados e vertebrados associados direta ou indiretamente a eles (Steller et al. 

2003, Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2008, Riul et al. 2009). A maior extensão de bancos de rodolitos 

está na costa brasileira, onde estão distribuídos em mosaicos, desde o estado do Pará até 

o estado de Santa Catarina, havendo uma concentração relevante na região do 

alargamento da plataforma que vai do sul da Bahia ao norte do Espírito Santo (Milliman 

&amp;amp; Amaral 1974, Foster 2001, Foster et al. 2013). Recentemente, o maior banco de 

rodolitos do mundo foi descoberto na região da Plataforma Continental de Abrolhos. 

Este banco ocupa uma área de mais de 20.000 km², e tem uma importância global na 

produção de carbonato de cálcio comparável aos recifes coralíneos do Caribe e à 

Grande Barreira de Corais da Austrália (Amado Filho et al. 2012, Moura et al. 2013). 

Outra recente descoberta é de um extenso recife carbonático de aproximadamente 

10.000 km² na região entre a Guiana Francesa e o Brasil, que compreende a região da 

Foz do Rio Amazonas, sendo este o primeiro recife descoberto sob a pluma de um 

grande rio (Moura et al. 2016). 

O potencial econômico destes bancos já foi apontado por alguns autores, 

principalmente para aplicações como fertilizantes e corretores de solos ácidos, ou como 

aditivos à ração animal (Oliveira 1997, Foster 2001). Outras atividades de exploração de 

recursos naturais marinhos podem ser prejudiciais aos bancos de rodolitos (Riosmena et 

al. 2010), sendo exemplos a explotação de moluscos, a dragagem e a ancoragem de 

embarcações, além da explotação de petróleo e gás que tem sido feita quase que 

indiscriminadamente (à exemplo dos bancos dos Abrolhos – Moura et al. 2013). É 

importante que levantamentos de biodiversidade sejam realizados nestes ambientes para 

que medidas de mitigação de impactos possam ser embasadas e propostas, a fim de 

preservar estes organismos que são “bioengenheiros” (terminologia Bruno &amp;amp; Bertness 

4 



2001) e provedores de micro-habitats para diversos organismos marinhos de interesse 

farmacêutico e de bioprospecção (Amado-Filho &amp;amp; Pereira-Filho 2012). 

Hoje em dia, são reconhecidas três ordens para as algas calcárias crostosas do 

filo Rhodophyta: Corallinales, Hapalidiales, Sporolithales (Nelson et al. 2015). Essas 

três ordens, juntamente com a ordem Rhodogorgonales formam um agrupamento 

monofilético definido como a sub-classe Corallinophycideae e se distinguem das 

demais Florideophyceae através evidências moleculares e celulares. Todas as ordens 

pertencentes à subclasse Corallinophycideae precipitam calcita na parede celular, 

entretanto, os membros da ordem Rhodogorgonales precipitam este mineral apenas em 

células vegetativas específicas, enquanto que as demais ordens o fazem por todo o talo.   

A distinção das três ordens de CCA se dá através da observação de sua fase 

tetrasporofítica, fase na qual os representantes da ordem Corallinales apresentam 

tetrasporângios zonados produzidos em conceptáculos uniporados sem a presença de 

tampão apical, os da ordem Hapalidiales apresentam tatrasporângios zonados 

produzidos em conceptáculos multiporados com tampão apical, já os representantes da 

ordem Sporolithales, apresentam tatrasporângios cruciados produzidos em 

compartimentos calcificados que geralmente estão agrupados em soros e apresentam 

tampão apical, (Silva &amp;amp; Johansen, 1986, Le Gall et al. 2010, Nelson et al. 2015). Uma 

descrição mais detalhadas das ordens e como se chegou à classificação taxonômica atual 

serão abordadas no Capítulo 1.  

A proposta inicial desta pesquisa era investigar a diversidade da ordem 

Sporolithales ao longo da costa do Brasil. No entanto, nas coletas em campo, na maioria 

das vezes não era possível distinguir nem mesmo a ordem à qual pertenciam as 

amostras. Apenas após o trabalho de triagem feita com base nos marcadores 

5 



moleculares em laboratório foi possível verificar o grupo taxonômico das amostras. A 

dificuldade inerente de se trabalhar com CCA, em todos os níveis, da obtenção das 

amostras em campo à análise molecular e morfológica, aliado ao limitado conhecimento 

sobre a diversidade real das espécies de CCA na costa do Brasil, fez com que este 

conjunto de amostras das demais ordens e os dados moleculares obtidos formassem um 

conjunto de informações bastante valiosas. Por outro lado, os resultados obtidos a partir 

de espécimes de Sporolithales coletados no entre marés e no infra litoral mostraram que 

a diversidade encontrada era menor que a esperada. Portanto, optamos por ampliar o 

escopo desse trabalho para incluir as duas outras ordens de CCA de forma a terem uma 

visão mais ampla sobre a diversidade de CCA ao longo da costa brasileira. 

Desta forma, no Capítulo 1, tratamos de forma mais abrangente a diversidade de 

táxons encontrados nas coletas realizadas ao longo da costa do Brasil, mas focando nas 

ordens Corallinales e Hapalidiales; no Capítulo 2, encontra-se o manuscrito já 

submetido para publicação, onde tratamos dos resultados obtidos para a ordem 

Sporolithales, incluindo a descrição de duas novas espécies para a ciência; e no Capítulo 

3, encontra-se outro manuscrito em vias de submissão para publicação que trata das 

espécies do gênero Lithothamnion do Golfo do México e que apresenta uma espécie em 

comum com o Brasil, sendo estes os primeiros resultados que serão publicados em 

parceria com a University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF CCA ALONG THE BRAZILIAN 

COAST WITH EMPHASIS ON CORALLINALES AND HAPALIDIALES  

Introduction 

 

The red algae or Rhodophyta are a distinct group of eukaryotic photosynthetic 

organisms, containing about 5,000–7,000 species of mostly multicellular, marine algae 

(De Clerk et al. 2012; Guiry &amp;amp; Guiry 2016). This form a unique group is distinguished 

from other eukaryotic lineages by a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural 

features (Cavalier-Smith 2007) such as chloroplasts that lack chlorophyll b and c and 

instead contain phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanins as accessory 

photosynthetic pigments, and the complete absence of flagella and centrioles in all life 

stages (Graham et al. 2009; Maggs et al. 2007; Saunders &amp;amp; Hommersand 2004; van den 

Hoek et al. 1995; Woelkerling 1990, Yoon et al. 2006; Yoon et al. 2010). 

Rhodophyta are a monophyletic phylum currently divided into two subphyla, the 

Cyanidiophytina (previously segregated from the phylum Rhodophyta to an upper level 

as the Cyanidiophyta proposed by Saunders &amp;amp; Hommersand 2004) and the 

Rhodophytina; the latter divided into six classes: the Stylonematophyceae, 

Porphyridiophyceae; Rhodellophyceae; Compsopogonophyceae; Bangiophyceae; and 

Florideophyceae (Yoon et al. 2006; Le Gall &amp;amp; Saunders 2007). 

The Florideophyceae is the most taxon-rich red algal class, comprising 95% of 

currently described species of Rhodophyta (Guiry &amp;amp; Guiry 2016). They are 

characterized primarily by 1) their triphasic life cycle, consisting of a carposporophyte, 

gametophyte and tetrasporophyte, 2) possesing pit-plugs between adjacent cells within 

filaments and 3) postfertilization cell-cell fusion mechanisms (Garbary &amp;amp; Gabrielson 

11 



1990). Pit connections linking neighboring cells are one of the diagnostic features 

characterizing red algal orders and diverse combinations of pit connection 

compartments (i.e., plug core with different number of cap layers and membranes) with 

molecular data have been used to define the ordinal boundaries of the Florideophyceae 

(Pueschel 1989; Pueschel 1994). 

Recent phylogenetic studies based on molecular data have resulted in a revised 

classification system that recognizes 29 orders in five subclasses: Ahnfeltiophycidae, 

Corallinophycidae, Hildenbrandiophycidae, Nemaliophycidae, and 

Rhodymeniophycidae (Saunders &amp;amp; Hommersand 2004; Le Gall &amp;amp; Saunders 2007; 

Yoon et al. 2010). The Corallinophycidae was proposed by Le Gall &amp;amp; Saunders (2007) 

to compasses the orders Corallinales and Rhodogorgonales. Subsequently, (Le Gall et 

al. 2010) revised the order Corallinales based on a reassessment of tetrasporangial 

cleavage pattern and on multigene analyses (SSU, LSU, and EF2), and erected a third 

order in the Corallinophycidae, the Sporolithales, based on the type family 

Sporolithaceae (Verheij 1993). More recently, Nelson et al. (2015) proposed that the 

family Hapalidiaceae, previously belonging to the order Corallinales, should be raised 

to the ordinal level, and thus established the Hapalidiales. Therefore, 4 orders are 

currently recognized as belonging to this subclass, the Corallinales, Hapalidiales, 

Sporolithales, and Rhodogorgonales. 

Members of the Corallinales, Hapalidiales and Sporalithales are also known as 

“corallines” or “calcareous algae”. The “corallines” are an artificial group composed of 

those multicellular red algae (Rhodophyta) that are characterized by a rigid stony thallus 

due to the presence of heavy calcium carbonate deposition in the form of calcite in their 

cell walls. Based solely in their external morphology, they can be divided in two main 

12 



groups: the crustose (or non-geniculate) and the articulated (or geniculate) corallines 

(Figures 1A, 1B). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The articulated (geniculate) corallines are upright or pendulously branched, 

bushy plants with calcified portions of the thallus intercalated with non-calcified 

portions or joints called genicula (in latin, literally little knees). Crustose coralline algae 

(CCA) may exhibit a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, along with the occurrence of 

cryptic species (Steneck &amp;amp; Adey 1976; Woelkerling et al. 1993), as is the case of many 

other groups in Rhodophyta (Hindi et al. 2015). Growth forms vary greatly among the 

CCA, and can be smooth and encrusting, discoid, shelf-forming/layered, foliose, and 

fruticose (or branched with knoblike excrescences), and all growth forms may or may 

not possess warty or lumpy surfaces (Figure 2). They are largely epilithic (i.e. growing 

directly on the rocky substratum), epiphytic (i.e. growing on other algae or marine 

angiosperms), or even epizoic (i.e. growing on animals) (Maneveldt et al. 2010). In the

absence of hard substrata, many CCA species can propagate as free-living nodules 

known as rhodoliths (literally “red stones”) (Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2013).

The CCA: Biological, ecological and geological aspects 

The CCA are distributed worldwide, ranging from polar to tropical regions and 

reaching their highest diversity in tropical reef environments. There they occupy the 

entire depth range inhabited by photosynthetic organisms, from the upper intertidal to 

subtidal depths as great as 295 m (Littler et al. 1985, Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2013). They show 

characteristic distributions (Aguirre et al. 2000; Bosence 1983): (1) Sporolithoideae, 

low latitude/mainly deep waters; (2) Melobesioideae, high latitude/shallow waters to 

14 

http://development.ioisa.org.za/CAIT/introduction/rhodolith.asp


low latitude/deep waters; and (3) Lithophylloideae/Mastophoroideae, mid to low 

latitude/ shallow waters.  

Life history  

Generally, the CCA reproduce by a triphasic life history in which the diploid 

tetrasporophyte (2N) produces haploid tetraspores (N) through meiosis of the sporangial 

mother cell, a specialized cell giving rise to the tetrasporangium. Tetrasporangia are 

borne in individual calcified compartments (in the Sporolithales), uniporate 

conceptacles (in the Corallinales) and multiporate conceptacles (in the Hapalidiales). 

Haploid tetraspores germinate to produce the male and female gametophytes. Both 

female and male gametes are borne in uniporate conceptacles (for all three orders) and 

only the male gametes (spermatia), which lack flagella, are released to the environment 

to fertilize the female carpogonium within the female conceptacle. The gametes fuse 

and form a parasitic diploid carposporophyte stage (2N) within the female conceptacle. 

Lastly, the carposporophyte produces carpospores via mitosis, and the resultant 

carpospores germinate into diploid tetrasporophytes (2N), completing this life cycle 

(Hommersand &amp;amp; Fredericq 1990; Irvine &amp;amp; Chamberlain 1994; Harvey et al. 2005; 

Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2013). A representative scheme is presented in the Fig. 3.

study and are only representative, variations may occur in different genera.

Ecological Importance 

The CCA are a conspicuous constituent in coral reefs where they play a very 

important role in cementation and building reefs, offering structure and protection to 

this fragile ecosystem (Adey 1978b, Adey 1998, Harrington et al. 2004, Littler &amp;amp; Littler 

1997). In the absence of hard substrata, many nongeniculate species can propagate as 

free-living rhodolith nodules colonizing sedimentary seafloors. Some of the attached 

crustose corallines break free from areas such as continental shelves and then continue 

to grow in three dimensions as they are tumbled by wave action and bioturbation and 

ultimately cover vast areas as free- living rhodoliths (also called nodules, rhodolites, 

maërl, red algal balls, algaliths). Rhodolith beds have been found throughout all of the 

world’s oceans (Foster 2001, Amado-Filho et al. 2012). Globally, rhodoliths fill an 

important niche in marine ecosystems, serving as transtional habitats between rocky 

substrates and barren sedimentary areas (Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2008). Under favorable 

preservation conditions, rhodoliths can be the predominant contributors of carbonate 

sediments, often forming rudstone or floatstone depositional beds consisting of large 

fragments of rhodoliths contained in grainy matrices (Corda &amp;amp; Brandano 2003). 

Although they can be rolled occasionally by infrequent tropical storms, stationary 

rhodoliths nevertheless also provide a three dimensional microhabitat to a wide variety 

of species (Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2013). Sauvage et al. (2016) recently published a study 

using rhodoliths as a new resource for environmental biomonitoring, providing a 

framework that enables the use of high throughput sequencing to accelerate biodiversity 

characterization of microbial/algal assemblages from endolithic communities found in 

coral reef and rhodolith ecosystems, emphazing the ecological importance of these 

organisms and showing the diversity of endolithic organisms (phototrophs and and other 

17 



miscellaneous groups) that a rhodolith can bear inside; serving as a “seedbank” for the 

marine community (Fredericq et al. 2014).  

Furthermore, the most important contribution of coralline algae worldwide may 

prove to be in ameliorating the greenhouse gas CO2 buildup associated with global 

climate change (Littler &amp;amp; Littler 2013), especially in Brazil, where the world’s largest 

rhodolith beds are found, and where they are major CaCO3 bio-factories (Amado-Filho 

et al. 2012). The resultant carbon stores may be among the most important in the 

biosphere as neutralizers of global oceanic acidification and as reservoirs of excess 

greenhouse CO2. 

 

Geological Importance 

Crustose coralline algae have an extensive fossil record, in contrast to most algal 

groups. The modern corallines have appeared in the early Cretaceous (100.5–145.0 

Mya) and have been important components of shallow marine communities throughout 

the Cenozoic (present-66.0 Mya), mostly showing long-term increases in its species 

richness (Aguirre et al. 2000). Fossil corallines are also widespread globally, and 

exhibited their greatest species richness during the early and middle Cenozoic (2.58-

56.0 Mya), with a collapse to a late Pleistocene (11.7-126.0 Kya). In fact, corallines 

have shown a long term overall increase in species richness throughout most of their 

history. Despite this, coralline species diversification was not sustained after the 

Miocene (5.3-23.0 Mya) (Aguirre et al. 2000) and coralline algae suffered a series of 

extinction events, each of which eliminated at least 20% of the species. During the two 

largest extinction events of the late Cretaceous (66.0-100.5 Mya) and late Miocene–

Pliocene (2.5-5.3 Mya), about 66% of all coralline species became extinct.  

18 



There are currently over 1,600 described species of crustose coralline algae 

(Woelkerling 1988) and approximately 649 fossil species (Aguirre et al. 2000). 

Paleoecological information for this group may be one of the greatest and provide a 

great proxy to understand the evolution in this group.  

Biomineralization  

All crustose coralline algae belonging in the Corallinales, Hapalidiales, and 

Sporolithales (Rhodophyta) are characterized by the presence of calcium carbonate in 

their cell walls, which is often in the form of highly soluble high-magnesium-calcite 

(Adey 1998; Adey et al. 2013; Diaz-Pulido et al. 2014; Nelson et al. 2015; Krayesky-

Self et al. 2016). Besides the Rhodogorgonales (Fredericq &amp;amp; Norris 1995), whose 

members also precipitate calcite, all other calcified red and green macroalgae deposit 

calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite (reviewed in Adey 1998, Nelson 2009).  

The calcification process in corallines begins with the first cell divisions of the 

germinating spore, giving rise to a new plant (Cabioch &amp;amp; Giraud 1986); it is a 

photosynthesis-dependnt process guided by a polysaccharide matrix. In this case, the 

calcite crystals are oriented along the direction of the polysaccharide fibrils of the 

developing cell walls. Numerous ultrastructural studies of coralline algae did not reveal 

any special features in their cell structures (in comparison with noncalcareous red algae) 

that may result in the calcification of their thalli (Cabioch &amp;amp; Giraud 1986; Bilan &amp;amp; Usov 

2001). The reasons for the mineralization in these algae may be provided by the 

polysaccharide composition of their cell walls, which radically differs from that of other 

groups of red algae (Bilan &amp;amp; Usov 2001). Recently, Krayesky-Self et al. (2016) 

observed that the vegetative cell crystals are composed of high-magnesium calcite and 

that the crystals within the empty conceptacles are comprised of aragonite in some 

Lithothamnion species. Previous studies have also shown that the more stable 

19 



carbonates, i.e., aragonite and dolomite, may be present in the thallus of coralline algae 

filling in vegetative cells and pores (Alexandersson 1974; Diaz-Pulido et al. 2014; Nash 

et al. 2011, 2015). Walker and Moss (1984) showed that aragonite is precipitated in 

between the coralline crusts and their substratum, often when a space occurs between 

them. Understanding biomineralization and mechanisms that triggers it in the CCA is an 

important and timely topic as high Mg-calcite skeleton-bearing organisms may be more 

vulnerable to dissolution in response to increasing ocean acidification compared to other 

marine calcifying organisms that precipitate aragonite (Nelson 2009; Basso 2012).   

 

Taxonomy and Phylogeny 

Worlwide scenario  

The taxonomy of the coralline algae has historically been very challenging due to 

its unique characteristics (e.g. calcified thallus) and often confusing due to 

morphological plasticity as well as cryptic diversity. Several classifications have been 

proposed based solely on comparative morphological and anatomical features (Cabioch 

1972, 1988, Johansen 1976, Silva &amp;amp; Johansen 1986, Woelkerling 1988). Subsequently, 

Bailey &amp;amp; Chapman (1996, 1998) published the first molecular phylogenies of the 

Corallinales and confirmed the evolutionary scenario hypothesized by Cabioch (1988) 

that the geniculate forms had evolved independently in distinct lineages in the order. 

Since then, molecular approaches have greatly improved the resolution of red algal 

phylogenies as a whole (e.g. Freshwater et al. 1994, Le Gall &amp;amp; Saunders 2007, Le Gall 

et al. 2010) and as a consequence, some phylogenetic relationships between the 

different lineages of CCA have been clarified.  

Presently, the CCA are divided into three different orders, the Corallinales, 

Sporolithales and Hapalidiales (Nelson et al. 2015). The Corallinales comprise one 

20 



family, the Corallinaceae with seven subfamilies (Corallinoideae, Hydrolithoideae, 

Lithophylloideae, Mastophoroideae, Metagoniolithoideae, Neogoniolithoideae and 

Porolithoideae) (Kato et al. 2011). The Hapalidiales comprise one family, the 

Hapalidiaceae, with three subfamilies (Austrolithoideae, Choreonematoideae and 

Melobesioideae) (Harvey et al. 2003). The Sporolithales comprise a single family, the 

Sporolithaceae, with two genera, Sporolithon and Heydrichia (Verheij 1993; Townsend 

et al. 1994). Table 1 summarizes most updated orders, families and subfamilies scheme 

for the CCA and related informative morphological characters.

Though previously published red algal phylogenies based on rbcL and LSU 

included the geniculate coralline Amphiroa (Freshwater et al. 1994; Freshwater et al. 

1999), crustose coralline algal phylogenies published until 2008 were inferred from a 

single marker, the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) (Bailey &amp;amp; 

Chapman 1996, 1998; Bailey 1999; Harvey et al. 2002).  In 2008, Broom et al. 

proposed the plastidial gene psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) as a 

novel marker to be used in combination with SSU data to improve the phylogenetic 

resolution within the order. Robba et al. (2006) and Walker et al. (2009) also showed 

the relevance of using a mitochondrial marker to obtain new insights into the genetic 

diversity at lower taxonomic levels using the barcode marker cox1 (5' end of COI, the 

cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) in this and other groups of red algae. Chloroplast-

encoded rbcL (large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase) is another 

informative molecular marker that can be applied to this group, and has been shown to 

have high phylogenetic resolution in the red algae as a whole (e.g., Freshwater et al. 

1994). There is a section of rbcL that has been considered as a barcoding region for 

plants (at the 3’ end) according to CBOL (The Consortium for the Barcode of Life). 

Additionally, this gene region has already been sequenced from historical type material 

(Herbarium specimens) of some CCA with the proposal to use it as an alternative DNA 

barcode for this group of algae (Gabrielson 2008; Torrano-Silva 2015).  

Clearly, the use of multiple molecular markers will change many concepts in the 

taxonomy of the coralline algae. Despite all current efforts, a lack of information 

persists in relation to the systematics and phylogeny of CCA; for example, in the largest 

database of DNA sequences, GenBank, there are approximately 3,000 sequences 

available of Corallinales, Hapalidiales and Sporolithales combined, compared to more 

than 2,000 sequences for the single red algal genus Gracilaria alone.

Brazilian scenario 

In Brazil, from 2000 to date, there are 41 species of CCA reported to the Brazilian 

coast (see Table 2 for a list). The first studies of CCA started in the middle of the 19th 

century and Melobesia mamillaris Harvey (currently Neogoniolithon mamillare 

(Harvey) Setchell &amp;amp; L.R. Mason) and M. scabiosa Harvey (currently Lithothamnion 

scabiosum (Harvey) Foslie) were described by Harvey in 1849 based on specimens 

collected by Darwin in Bahia state, during the HMS Beagle expedition. After that, other 

naturalists cited CCA species in their studies (Dickie 1875; Piccone 1886; Möbius 1889, 

1890). In 1900, Foslie reviewed specimens analyzed before by Dickie and in this same 

year he published the species Lithothamnion erubescens Foslie (currently Mesophyllum 

erubescens (Foslie) Me.Lemoine) from Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and 

posteriorly extended the occurrence for this species to São Paulo (Southestern Brazilian 

coast).  

In the 20th century many CCA species were reported for the Brazilian coast in 

floristic surveys conducted by Lemoine (1917), Taylor (1931), Setchell &amp;amp; Mason 

(1943), Joly (1965), Adey (1970), Ugadim (1970), Kempf (1970) and Câmara Neto 

(1971). Taylor (1960) also published a book referencing the occurrence of nine species. 

Yamagushi-Tomita (1976) referenced eight species of Sporolithon in her PhD 

dissertation, five of them as new combinations along the Brazilian Tropical region; 

although some of these species were misidentified, she provided a huge contribution to 

Brazilian phycology as these studies were a crucial milestone to the CCA studies in the 

country, being the first that described species in detail. One year later, Oliveira-Filho 

(1977) referenced the occurrence of 16 CCA species along the Brazilian coast, three of 

them reported as new occurrences.  

24 



Horta (2000) reported in his PhD dissertation seven CCA species for the Brazilian 

Southwestern and Southern regions (Temperate region), with three of them being 

reported as new occurrences. Figueiredo &amp;amp; Steneck (2002) reported 11 species in their 

floristic survey of the Abrolhos reefs, which are located along the Northestern Brazilian 

coast (Tropical region). Also in 2002, Horta published a study with new perspectives to 

the Brazilian CCA studies. 

Villas-Boas et al. (2005) first recorded Porolithon pachydermun (Foslie) Foslie 

from the Rocas Atoll (Northwestern Brazilian coast), emphasizing that this species is 

the major component of the shallow reefs in this area. In the same year, Tâmega &amp;amp; 

Figueiredo (2005) first reported the occurrence of Hydrolithon samoënse (Foslie) D. 

Keats &amp;amp; Y. Chamberlain and two other Corallinaceae from Buzios, in the Southestern 

Brazilian coast and Nunes (2005) reported in his dissertation the occurrence of three 

species of CCA from Bahia state (Northestern Brazilian coast), one of them being 

Lithophyllum stictaeforme (Areschoug) Hauck as the first report to the country. In 2006, 

Rocha et al. referenced three CCA species from Arvoredo Island on the Southern 

Brazilian coast, although no detailed descriptions were provided. 

During the last 10 years, the efforts to identify and describe CCA species have 

been exponentially increasing along the Brazilian coast. Collaborations with researchers 

all over the world have also contributed to establish methods and approaches regarding 

to the studies of this group. As a result, many manuscripts have already been published 

and many more investigations are currently ongoing. Most studies in these past few 

years are filled with detailed descriptions, first reports that increased the number of 

species citated for the Brazilian coast, a few synonyms proposed and a significant 

number of species new to science. 

25 



Amado-Filho et al. (2007) showed the importance of the structure of the rhodolith 

beds in the Espírito Santo state (Southestern Brazilian coast) and identified five genera 

from these rhodolith beds. Nunes et al. (2008) reported three species for Bahia state in a 

publication based on the findings from his thesis, being them Lithophyllum stictaeforme, 

Mesophyllum erubescens and Sporolithon episporum (M.Howe) E.Y.Dawson. Villas-

Boas (2008) cited in his PhD dissertation seven species of CCA to Espírito Santo state 

and as a result for these findings in 2009, Villas-Boas et al. published a study 

referencing four species of Lithophyllum, one of them new to science. Farias (2009) 

analyzed two Hapalidiaceae species for her Master’s thesis and Mariath (2009) analyzed 

ecological succession in a reef in Bahia state and identified some CCA as major 

components of that reef. 

Bahia et al. (2010) published a study about the composition of a rhodolith bed 

along depth gradients on the northern coast of Bahia state. Amado-Filho et al. (2010) 

published a recent study about rhodolith beds in Espírito Santo state and identified two 

species in the study area. Farias et al. (2010) proposed to synonymize Lithothamnion 

heteromorphum (Foslie) Foslie with Lithothamnion superpositum Foslie based on 

collections from the South Atlantic coast; Henriques (2010) investigated the taxonomy 

and composition of the deep water rhodolith beds in the central zone of the Brazilian 

exclusive economic zone. 

In 2011, Burgos wrote his PhD dissertation about the subtidal macrophytobenthic 

composition and structure from Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Pernambuco state 

(Northestern Brazilian coast); Horta et al. 2011 published a study regarding the 

morphology and reproduction of Mesophyllum erubescens on the Southern Brazilian 

coast; Bahia et al. (2011) first reported Sporolithon ptychoides Heydrich to the Atlantic; 

26 



Vieira-Pinto (2011) studied the biological, ecological and reproductive aspects of the 

genus Lithophyllum from the Southern Brazilian coast.  

In 2012, Khader studied the distribution of the CCA on the Cabo Frio 

(Southestern Brazilian coast) in an area with upwelling of cold water and reported nine 

species to this locality; Mariath et al. (2012) published a study first recording 

Pneophyllum conicum (E.Y. Dawson) Keats, Y.M. Chamberlain &amp;amp; M. Baba to Brazilian 

waters and proposed the new species, Lithothamnion steneckii Mariath &amp;amp; Figueiredo; 

Henriques et al. (2012) first reported rhodolith-forming species of CCA from deep 

waters in the Espírito Santo state. 

In 2013, Sissini wrote in her Master’s thesis about the diversity and biogeography 

of the Hapalidiaceae from the Brazilian coast; Costa (2013) wrote about the taxonomy 

of the CCA on the north coast of Bahia state (Northeastern Brazilian coast); Crespo 

(2013) studied the distribution of CCA in São Pedro and São Paulo Archipelago in a 

depth gradient; Pascelli et al. (2013) published a study about the changes in rhodolith 

beds in the Southeastern Brazilian. 

In 2014, Borges wrote her Master’s thesis about the taxonomy of epiphytic CCA; 

Bahia (2014), in his PhD dissertation wrote about the taxonomy and did a floristic 

survey on the rhodolith-forming CCA from the Brazilian coast and subsequently 

published the results, first reporting Sporolithon molle (Heydrich) Heydrich (Bahia et 

al. 2014a) and describing Sporolithon tenue R.G. Bahia, G.M. Amado-Filho, G.W. 

Maneveldt &amp;amp; W.H. Adey Bahia et al. (2014 b); Costa et al. (2014a) reported the 

occurrence of Spongites yendoi (Foslie) Y.M.Chamberlain from Bahia state; 

Woelkerling et al. (2014) described Heydrichia (?) poignatii Woelkerling, Granier &amp;amp; 

27 



Dias-Brito, a fossil species from the Creataceous found on Riachuelo Formation, 

Sergipe Basin, Northeastern Brazil. 

Also, in 2014 Riosmena-Rodrigues et al. organized and published a special 

volume in the journal Phytotaxa, focusing on the systematics and biogeography of the 

Corallinophycideae. Bahia et al. (2014c) cited Porolithon improcerum (Foslie &amp;amp; M. 

Howe) M. Howe and Mesophyllum macroblastum (Foslie) W.H. Adey for the first time 

in the Atlantic. Costa et al. (2014b) published a study with the CCA found on the 

northwestern Brazilian coast and characterized in details 5 species. Henriques et al. 

(2014a,b) published Lithophyllum, Mastophoroideae and Sporolithon species from the 

Brazilian continental shelf, additionally proposing Sporolithon elevatum M.C. 

Henriques &amp;amp; R. Riosmena-Rodriguez as a new species. Tâmega et al. (2014) described 

Neogoniolithon atlanticum Tâmega, Riosmena-Rodríguez, Mariath &amp;amp; M. Figueiredo for 

the northwestern Brazilian coast. Vieira-Pinto et al. (2014) studied the genus 

Lithophyllum in the Southern Brazilian coast and described Lithophyllum atlanticum T. 

Vieira-Pinto, M.C. Oliveira &amp;amp; P.A. Horta as a species new to science; Sissini et al. 

(2014) studied Mesophyllum erubescens from the Brazilian coast and revealed crytic 

species under this epithet; Torrano-Silva et al. (2014) studied the genus Pausilvella (an 

intermediate between CCA and the geniculate corallines) and first reported the 

occurrence of this genus in Brazil. Crespo et al. (2014) conducted a floristic survey of 

the CCA from the São Pedro and São Paulo oceanic islands. In 2015, Jesionek, in his 

Master’s thesis, studied the taxonomy of CCA in the reefs of the Abrolhos Continental 

Shelf. And finally, in 2016, Henriques completed her PhD dissertation about the 

taxonomy and phylogeny of the CCA from Campos basin and the importance of 

biodiversity management of rhodolith beds in Brazil and Moura et al. 2016 reported an 

28 



extensive coral reef in the Amazon River Mouth and in this study referred 3 species of 

CCA to the area. 

Overall, the distribution of CCA comprises the entire Brazilian coast from the 

Amazon River mouth (Bahia 2014) to Torres beach further South along the Brazilian 

coast (Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014), including oceanic islands (Rocas Atoll, Fernando de 

Noronha Archipelago, Vitória-Trindade chain, São Pedro and São Paulo islands) 

(Villas-Boas et al. 2005; Amado-Filho et al. 2012; Crespo et al. 2014; Sissini et al. 

2014) (see Table 2 and Fig. 4 for more details).

Despite all the efforts, very few studies analyzed the taxonomy and phylogeny 

based on modern techniques and fewer combined morphological and molecular analyses 

for this group of algae (Vieira-Pinto 2011; Sissini 2013; Bahia et al. 2014a; Sissini et al. 

2014; Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014; Torrano-Silva 2015; Bahia et al. 2015, Henriques 2016); 

hence, the diversity of CCA is probably grossly underestimated. 

Considering the importance of CCA and its difficult taxonomy, the present study 

aims to contribute to the knowledge of the taxonomy and phylogeny through the use of 

molecular markers and morphological analyses of the CCA on the Brazilian coast in 

order to gain a better understanding of biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, 

the effects of global climate changes, and ecological modeling.  

33 



Aims 

The main aim of this research was to elucidate the diversity of CCA species along 

the Brazilian coast, using a molecular approach coupled with alpha taxonomy 

(molecular-assisted alpha taxonomy, known as MAAT, Hind et al. 2014), in order to 

better understand distribution patterns and phylogenetic relationships between species.  

We propose to address the following specific targets in order to achieve the main 

aim of this project: 

1) To identify and describe the CCA diversity from the Brazilian coast based on DNA 

sequences and morphological and anatomical observations; 

2) To use molecular markers such as UPA, psbA, COI-5P and rbcL-3P to generate 

DNA sequences and construct matrices to compare sequences from Brazilian 

specimens to those available in the public databases; 

3) To infer the informativeness and effectiveness of the molecular markers used in this 

study; 

4) To generate, analyze and compare SEM images of vegetative and reproductive 

structures that are phylogenetically relevant to species that have already been 

described, especially for the Atlantic; 

5) To contribute to the knowledge of the CCA and their distribution along the Brazilian 

coast. 

 

Materials and Methods 

Sampling of CAA was performed along the Brazilian coast and from three 

Oceanic Islands (Fig. 5) in a total of 52 sample sites; more than 350 specimens were 

collected and will be/are being incorporated in the SPF Herbarium at the University of 

São Paulo (Thiers, 2016) (Appendix I – see the CD attached in the back cover).

Specimens were collected in the intertidal at low tide or by snorkeling and SCUBA 

diving. To collect epilithic specimens (attached to rocks) that were firmly attached to 

the substratum, a hammer and chisel were used to remove pieces of rocks or coral along 

with their attached CCA. For both rhodoliths and epilithic samples, prior to 

preservation, a careful cleaning was performed on each specimen in order to remove the 

associated fauna and flora from the samples.  

35 



After cleaning, each specimen was broken in half, with half the specimen stored in 

silica gel to preserve the DNA for molecular analyses and the other half preserved in a 

4% formalin/seawater solution for morphological and anatomical studies. Before a 

specimen was fractured in half, we looked at general morphology under a magnifying 

glass. When fertile, it was sometimes possible to tentatively identify the specimens to 

the ordinal level. For example, specimens possessing a sorus belong to the 

Sporolithales, specimens with multiporate conceptacles belong to the Hapalidiales, and 

specimens with uniporate conceptacles may or may not belong to the Corallinales 

(depending on whether the conceptacles are gametangial or tetrasporangial). We also 

took photos of the specimens’ general shape and morphological aspects. 

Morphological and Anatomical study 

In the Laboratory of Marine Algae “Édson José de Paula” at the University of São 

Paulo, the specimens were analyzed under a dissecting scope and small fragments, 

preferably fertile, were selected for anatomical studies. 

Permanent slides were prepared using Metacrilatoglicol (Leica®) resin, in which we 

embedded the sample fragments (after decalcification and ethanolic dehydration 

following Horta (2002), and after positioning them in accordance to the orientation we 

wanted the view), after that, samples were sectioned in a rotary microtome with 

thickness varying from 5-15 µm. The slides were stained in Tolouidine blue 5% and 

analyzed using light microscopy, focusing mainly on the reproductive structures when 

present. Light microscopy images were obtained with a photomicroscope.  

SEM images were obtained from portions of the thallus of dried specimens 

previously preserved in Si-gel or 4% formalin/seawater. Cross sections and longitudinal 

sections were made using a razor blade, and the resulting sections were mounted in 

36 



stubs that varied in size, using liquid graphite to glue the small fragments. Coating as 

made with 10-14 nm of gold. Specimens were viewed using a Hitachi S-3000N 

scanning electron microscope (SEM) at a voltage of 15 kV, in the Microscopy Center at 

UL Lafayette, following the manufacturer’s instructions.  

Molecular studies 

DNA Extraction and PCR protocols 

Total genomic DNA was extracted from cleaned fragments of silica gel-dried 

samples using either the Chelex resin protocol (Goff &amp;amp; Moon 1993) or the “NucleoSpin 

Plant II” kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 

instructions. In all cases DNA was extracted from the same specimens used for 

morphological analysis. Overall, we extracted DNA from 262 samples and out of the 4 

markers we used in this study, a total of 172 samples were sequenced for at least one of 

them (Tab. 3).

Table 3. List of samples extracted and successfully amplified in this study. For all specimens to which the DNA was extracted we tried to 

amplify at least UPA and COI-5P, but not always obtained good quality reads; in this table only the samples that resulted in good quality 

sequences (clean reads, passible of alignment) were marked with a “x”.

and the chloroplast-encoded gene rbcL, which encodes the large subunit of the enzyme 

ribulose-l, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and the mitochondria-

encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI). In the Table 4 we list all the primers 

used during this study, although not all of them worked well in our dataset as we show 

in the discussion section.  

PCR for UPA was performed using the primers and PCR protocol referenced in 

Sherwood and Presting (2007). PCR for psbA was performed using the primers 

referenced in Yoon et al. (2002) under the following thermal profile: an initial 

denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 sec 

(denaturation),  47 °C for 1 min (primer annealing), and 72 °C for 2 min (extension) 

followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. PCR for COI was conducted using the 

primers referenced in Table 4, with an initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 40 

cycles at 94°C for 1 min (denaturation), 45°C for 1 min (primer annealing), and 72°C 

(extension) for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR for rbcL 

was performed using the primers referenced in Table 4, with an initial denaturation of 

94°C for 4 min followed by 2 cycles at 94°C for 1 min (denaturation), 40°C for 1 min 

(primer annealing), and 72°C (extension) for 2 min then 40 cycles at 94°C for 1 min 

(denaturation), 42°C for 1 min (primer annealing), and 72°C (extension) for 2 min 

followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.).

PCR products where purified with ExoSAP-IT® (USB®) or with the llustra™ 

GTX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, 

UK). Both methods worked well in our dataset, therefore no more comments about the 

cleaning are made in the discussion section. 

Purified PCR products were subsequently cycle sequenced using the BigDye 

Terminator v 3.1 kit (Life Technologies) following the protocol specified by the 

supplier. Resulting cycle sequence reactions were purified with ETOH/EDTA 

precipitation and were either sequenced in-house at University of São Paulo campus on 

an ABI Model 3730 Genetic Analyzer or at the UL Lafayette campus on an ABI Model 

3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Resulting chromatograms were assembled using Sequencher 

5.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) or Geneious R9 

(http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et al., 2012).

Alignments 

 Consensus DNA sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W (Thompson et 

al. 1994) program in MEGA 5.2.2 (Tamura et al. 2011). In the Table 5 is a summary of 

the single-genes aligment matrices used in this chapter. The final UPA alignment 

comprised 78 sequences (370 bp), 54 newly generated in this study, 23 sequences from 

GenBank, including 1 sequences of Gracilaria cuneata as outgroup. The final rbcL-3P 

alignment comprised 100 sequences (307 bp), 47 newly generated sequences, 53 

sequences from GenBank, including 2 sequences of Rhodogorgonales as outgroups. The 

final COI-5P alignment comprised 229 sequences (604 bp), 69 newly generated 

sequences, 160 sequences from GenBank, including 3 sequences of Rhodogorgonales as 

outgroups. The final psbA alignment comprised 243 sequences (867 bp) comprised 96 

newly generated sequences, 174 published sequences and a sequence of Renouxia sp. as 

outgroup. For more information about the specimens from genbank used in all matrices, 

see Appendix II (Appendix I – see the CD attached in the back cover).

Phylogenetic and Barcoding Analyses 

The all four single-gene aligment matrices were analyzed with the NJ distance-

based method in MEGA 5.2.2 (Tamura et al. 2011) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. 

Analyses of the COI-5P and psbA were conducted using Bayesian (BI) and Maximum 

Likelihood (ML) methods, both with a GTR+I+G model of evolution partitioned per 

codon position (best-fitting model identified by PhyML-aLRT v.2.4.5 (Anisimova &amp;amp; 

Gascuel 2006) in TOPALI 2.5 (Milne et al. 2004). Bayesian analysis were conducted 

using MrBayes (Huelsenbeck &amp;amp; Ronquist 2001) also in TOPALI  2.5 consisting of two 

MCMC chains with 1 x 10
7
 generations.  Resampling was performed every 1,000 

generations. The first 10% of each run was discarded as “burn-in”, and a consensus tree 

was built with remaining data. ML analyses were conducted with the RAxML-HPC2 

program using the online server ‘The CIPRES Science Gateway V. 3.3’ (Miller et al. 

2010) with 1,000 topological searches from random restarts, and 1,000 bootstrap 

replicates.  

Species Delimitation Analyses 

 Species delimitation analyses were performed on each dataset with Automatic 

Barcode Gap Species Discovery (ABGD). The ABGD analysis run online at 

http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd (Puillandre et al. 2012) with minimum (pmin) 

and maximum (pmax) intraspecific distance priors comprised between 0.001 and 1 in 

0.01 steps, and with a relative gap width values of 1.

Evaluation of Pairwise Distance Distribution for Markers 

The numbers of pairwise differences were calculated in Geneious version R9 

(http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et al. 2012). The distribution of raw pairwise 

distances was computed for the four markers utilized in the present study in order to 

evaluate their phylogenetic informativeness. Distances were calculated by dividing the 

number of base pair differences by the alignment length. Alignments were cropped at 

their 5' and 3' ends when missing data was present and short sequences were removed as 

to not overinflate pairwise distances.

Results 

Molecular results 

Based on the combined use of four molecular markers we investigated the 

diversity of CCA found along the Brazilian coast.  The resulting tree for the markers 

COI-5P and psbA is presented split in subtrees as they are our most data-rich and taxa-

rich sets, while UPA and rbcL-3P trees are presented as single figures as they are our 

less diversity-rich taxa datasets.  

The backbones of the cluster analyses we obtained from each of the four markers 

were overall poorly resolved (Fig. 6-8 and 12; UPA, rbcL-3P, COI-5P and psbA 

respectively). Although the markers we used are not the most appropriate to address or 

infer phylogenetic relationships on their own (with the exception of psbA), we observed 

a pattern showing the monophyly of the orders Corallinales and Sporolithales with low 

bootstrap support. The Hapalidiales was not monophyletic in the analyses among 

markers, with the exception of the psbA tree that showed the Hapalidiales as a 

monophyletic lineage and Corallinales as being non-monophyletic. Numerous lineages 

in the shallow branch tips, especially in the results we obtained from COI-5P and psbA 

analyses (see next sections for the detailed lineages in zoomed-in trees) received a 

higher support in the analyses and revealed previously undocumented molecular 

diversity of CCA in Brazil. 

Unidentified species annotations are the same in all trees when specimens 

overlap among the different markers. 

 

56 



UPA 

The NJ analysis of UPA (Fig. 6) showed a diversity of 22 species on the 

Brazilian coast, based on the data generated in this study, with nine of them belonging 

to Corallinales, 10 to Hapalidiales, one to the Sporolithales; the specimens IBC1551 and 

IBC1555 from Trindade Island were isolated in two different branches separate from 

Corallinales, Hapalidiales or Sporolithales. All these 22 putative species were supported 

by ABGD analysis with the exception of IBC1526, which appears in the tree by itself as 

very closely related with other Brazilian species and which in ABGD results is clustered 

with Hapalidiaceae sp. 9 – see details further in the text. 

In the Corallinales clade, the samples IBC1527 and IBC1927 grouped with 

Lithophyllum atlanticum T.Vieira-Pinto, M.C.Oliveira &amp;amp; P.A.Horta from Brazil with no 

intraspecific variation, and IBC1928 formed a cluster with Lithophyllum margaritae 

(Hariot) Heydrich also from Brazil. Lithophyllum sp. 1 (IBC 1734) was sister to 

Lithophyllum dentatum (Kützing) Foslie from Spain with a divergence of 12.4% 

between each other; Neogoniolithon sp. 1 (IBC1202) grouped with Neogoniolithon sp. 

from Guadalupe and Neogoniolithon fosliei (Heydrich) Setchell &amp;amp; L. R. Mason from 

French Polynesia with 6.8-8.8% variation. Corallinaceae sp. 1 (IBC1247) was sister to 

Spongites sp. from Hawaii with 6.2% divergence; the sample IBC1554 was grouped 

with Lithophyllum kotschyanum Unger from Australia with 0.3% of intraspecific 

variation. Corallinaceae sp. 2 (IBC1209) and Corallinaceae sp. 3 (IBC1566) were 

clustered together with 13% divergence. Corallinaceae sp. 4 (IBC1222) comprised a 

clade that is sister to Pneophyllum conicum (E. Y. Dawson) Keats, Y. M. Chamberlain 

&amp;amp; M. Baba specimens from Hawaii (HQ421025) and Australia (KM073333). 

Specimens of Pneophyllum conicum from Genbank showed 1.9% intraspecific variation 

57 



(probably due to misapplied name), while Corallinaceae sp. 4 was 3-3.2% divergent 

from these specimens.  

In the Hapalidiales, Mesophyllum erubescens (Foslie) Me. Lemoine IBC1926 

and KM877298 from the database comprised a clade and showed 100% similarity 

between the two specimens. Lithothamnion sp. 1 cluster has three specimens (IBC1564, 

IBC1557 and IBC1704) grouped together with 0.3% intraspecific variation. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 (IBC1790) did not form a clade with any other species, neither did 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 2 (IBC1196) and Hapalidiaceae sp. 3 (IBC1207), and each of the 

three taxa were represented by only one specimen. Hapalidiaceae sp. 4 (IBC1246 and 

IBC1562) grouped with Hapalidiaceae sp. from Brazil and were 0.5% divergent. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 5 (IBC1559) did not group with any other species, neither did 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 6 (IBC1526). Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 formed a cluster with three 

specimens (IBC1188, IBC1245 and IBC1547) with no intraspecific variation. The 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 cluster was composed of seven specimens (IBC1191, IBC1558, 

IBC1560, IBC1922, IBC1923, IBC1924 and IBC1925) with intraspecific variation of 1-

1.3%. However, the ABGD analysis indicated that this may represent a complex of 

species, as it splits this clade into four different putative species. Considering we cannot 

confirm this hypothesis with other markers, we decided to treat this cluster as one 

species. 

Specimens of Sporolithales are all grouped together with an intraspecific 

variation ranging from 0.3-2%.

rbcL-3P 

The results of the ML analysis of rbcL-3P (Fig. 7) revealed a diversity of 16 

species on the Brazilian coast, based on the data generated in this study, with four of 

them belonging to Corallinales, 11 to Hapalidiales and one to the Sporolithales. All the 

groups presented in this tree are supported by ABGD analysis. 

The clade comprised of species of Corallinales shows Corallinaceae sp. 5 

(IBC1737) and Corallinaceae sp. 2 (IBC1228) were not grouped with any other 

specimen. Lithophyllum sp. 2 cluster consists of two individuals (IBC1793 and 

IBC1921) with 0.7% intraspecific variation, and is sister to Lithophyllum grumosum 

(Foslie) Foslie from the Pacific with interspecific variation of 5.3-6%. Lithophyllum sp. 

3 is also comprised of two individuals (IBC1726 and IBC1878) with 3.9% intraspecific 

variation. 

In the Hapalidiales clade, Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 (IBC1790) and Hapalidiaceae sp. 

3 (IBC1196) were nested in a cluster with a Hapalidiaceae sp. from Brazil (KP085633 

and KP085634) although they are 9 – 11 % divergent from each other. Specimens 

IBC1712, IBC1765, IBC1875 and IBC1877 were grouped with Mesophyllum 

erubescens from Brazil and Mexico with no intraspecific variation. Lithothamnion sp. 1 

(IBC1525 – annotation based on further analyses shown further) is sister to a specimen 

of Phymatholithon lenormandii (Areschoug) W. H. Adey from Canada with 12.1% 

interspecific variation. Lithothamnion sp. 2 (IBC1869 - annotation based on further 

analyses shown further) is sister to a cluster including Lithothamnion lemoineae Adey, 

L. tophiforme (Esper) Unger and L. glaciale Kjellman from Canada (3.3-3.7% 

divergence between the three species) with 8.2-8.6% divergence between Brazilian and 

Canadian species. Hapalidiaceae sp. 9, 10, 11 and 12 were nested in the same cluster in 

61 



which Hapalidiaceae species from Brazil (KP085630 and KP085631) and Hapalidiaceae 

sp. 7 (IBC1188, IBC1547, IBC1876 and IBC1882) were grouped. Hapalidiaceae sp. 

from Brazil (KP085630 and KP085631) and Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 are sister to each other 

with 8.9% divergence. Another Hapalidiaceae sp. from Brazil (KP085635) formed a 

clade with Hapalidiaceae sp. 4 (IBC1669, IBC1680 and IBC1710 – annotation 

according to further; see next sections for details) with no intraspecific variation, that 

appeared to be a separate lineage in the analyses for this marker and was more closely 

related to Sporolithales. 

Specimens of Sporolithon from the Brazilian shallow waters were all grouped 

together with 0.2% intraspecific variation and were sister to Sporolithon sp. 

(KP142785) and Sporolithon cf. ptychoides Heydrich (KP142787) both from Brazil 

with a divergence percentage of 18.5-18.8.

The Corallinales formed a monophyletic clade with no support and is shown in 

detail in Fig. 9. The Lithophylloideae formed a monophyletic clade also with no 

support. Lithophyllum sp. 4 cluster consists of four specimens (IBC1633, IBC1792, 

IBC1872 and IBC1873) with strong support (99/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively), and 

with intraspecific variation of 0.3-0.8% and in accordance with ABGD results. This 

species is sister to Lithophyllum yemense Basso, Caragnano, Le Gall &amp;amp; Rodondi 

(KP976401) from Yemen with moderate support (52/0.99/82 ML, BI and NJ 

respectively) and with a divergence of 9.5%. Lithophyllum sp. 2 consisted of three 

specimens from Brazil (IBC1793, IBC1794 and IBC1921) that formed a strongly 

supported clade (100/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with no intraspecific variation 

that was delimited as a single species in the ABGD analysis. This species is sister to 

Lithophyllum cf. bamleri from Fiji with 10.8% interspecific variation. Lithophyllum sp. 

5 (IBC1717) was sister to Lithophyllum insipidum (HQ423075 and HQ422710) from 

Hawaii with strong support (98/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and shows 9% of 

interspecific variation. Corallinaceae sp. 5 (IBC1737) was isolated in a long branch, 

sister to the Lithophylloideae clade. Corallinaceae sp. 2 (IBC1209 and IBC1228) shows 

0.3% intraspecific variation and is delimited as a single species in ABGD. This species 

was nested next to a specimen of unidentified crustose Corallinaceae from Vanuatu with 

12-12.3% of interspecific variation. Neogoniolithon sp. 1 (IBC1202 and IBC1216) was 

nested in a clade with Neogonolithoideae species that was moderately supported in the 

ML and NJ analyses (70 and 65 respectively) and fully supported in the BI analysis 

65 



(PP=1). This species has no intraspecific variation and is sister to Neogoniolithon 

brassica-florida (KM392368) from France with strong support (100/1/99 ML, BI and 

NJ respectively) and 7.6 % interspecific divergence between them. The ABGD analysis 

also delimited the two individuals of Neogonilithon sp. 1 as one species apart from 

Neogoniolithon brassica-florida (KM392368). 

The Hapalidiales was not a monophyletic order in this analysis and was split into 

two clades, shown separately for a better visualization – Hapalidiales I (Fig. 10) and 

Hapalidiales II (Fig. 11). The Hapalidiales clade I (Fig. 10) was composed of 

Mesophyllum, Phymatolithon and Lithothamnion species with no support in the deeper 

node. However, a clade formed by Phymatholithon and Lithothamnion species received 

no support in the ML and NJ analyses but did receive strong support in the BI analysis 

0.96).  

Lithothamnion sp. 2 (IBC1869) was nested in a cluster with Lithothamnion 

species and an unidentified Hapalidiaceae from Indonesia with moderate support for NJ 

(67) and no support for ML and BI. Lithothamnion sp. 10 is sister to Lithothamnion 

corallioides from UK (KC861487) and France (KC861447) with moderate support for 

ML and NJ (57 and 87 respectively) and no support for BI and 10.2% of divergence. 

Lithothamnion sp. 1 is nested in a clade with Phymatolithon species from North Atlantic 

with low to moderate BI support (0.65) and no ML and NJ support. This species is 

comprised of two individuals (IBC1907 and IBC1525) grouped with strong support 

(100/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and showed 2.7% intraspecific variation. ABGD 

also delimited both specimens of Lithothamnion sp. 1 as a single species.  

The Hapalidiales clade II (Fig. 11) is not supported in any of the analyses and is 

comprised of Mesophyllum, Lithothamnion, Melobesia, Clathromorphum, 

66 



Phymatholithon and Synarthrophyton species and also a specimen reported as 

Lithophyllum kotschyanum (Corallinales) from Spain which we believe is a 

misidentified or mislabeled specimen. Hapalidiaceae sp. 3 (IBC1207) was grouped in a 

cluster with Melobesia sp. from USA and Lithothamnion sp. from New Caledonia 

(GQ917298) with low to moderate support (68/.68/58 ML, BI and NJ respectively). 

Lithothamnion sp. (GQ917298) from Genbank grouped with the Brazilian species with 

strong support (100/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively); the ABGD analysis also 

supported the two specimens as a single species, with a 1.7% of divergence between 

them. Hapalidiceae sp. 1, sp. 2 and sp. 4 comprised a cluster with Lithothamnion sp. 

from Vanuatu, but with no support for any analyses. Hapalidiaceae sp. 4 consisted of 

seven specimens (IBC1562, IBC1657, IBC1662, IBC1665, IBC1680, IBC1804 and 

IBC1850) in a strongly supported clade (100/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with 

0.2% of divergence. Although the ABGD analysis delimited this clade as two putative 

species, (IBC1657, IBC1804 and IBC1850 as one species and IBC1562, IBC1662, 

IBC1665 and IBC1680 as a second species), we will treat them as one species in this 

study. Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 was sister to Hapalidiacae sp. 4 with no support and with a 

divergence of 11.4-12.1%. Hapalidiaceae sp. 2 shows 14.8-15.1% interspecific variation 

from Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 and sp. 4.  

Mesophyllum erubescens from Brazil (IBC1765, IBC1877 and IBC1712) 

grouped with several specimens that are reported under the same epithet and a specimen 

of Mesophyllum sphaericum in a clade with strong support for ML and NJ (97 and 94 

respectively) but no support in the BI analysis. Mesophyllum erubescens from Brazil 

grouped in a clade with strong support (100/0.95/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with 

no intraspecific variation and was supported as a single species in the ABGD analysis; 

the species is sister to Mesophyllum erubescens from Hawaii (HQ422717 and 

67 



HQ422718) with strong support in ML and NJ analyses and moderate support in BI 

(99/.79/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and showed 2.9% intraspecific variation 

between species from Brazil and Hawaii, although ABGD results suggest they are 

separate entities.  

Hapalidiaceae sp. 6, Hapalidiaceae sp. 7, Hapalidiaceae sp. 8, Hapalidiaceae sp. 

10, Hapalidiaceae sp. 11 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 12 from Brazil, Synarthrophyton patena, 

Mesophyllum sp. and a unidentified Hapalidiaceae specimen comprised a clade with low 

to moderate support for ML and moderate support for BI and NJ (0.70 and 81 

respectively). Hapalidiaceae sp. 6 (IBC1526) is sister to Hapalidiaceae sp. 11 

(IBC1865) with no support in ML and BI and low to moderate support in NJ (65) and 

showed an interspecific variation of 4.8%; species were delimited as different species in 

ABGD analysis as well. Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 comprised two specimens (IBC1188 and 

IBC1876) that showed 0.4% of intraspecific variation and strong support for all 

analyses (100/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and was supported by results of the 

ABGD analysis as a single entity. Hapalidiaceae sp. 12 (IBC1703) is sister to 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 with strong support (100/1/95 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and with 

11.4% of interspecific variation.  Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 (IBC1882 - annotation based on 

psbA analyses shown further) is sister to Hapalidiaceae sp. 10 with no support and they 

are 7.8% divergent. The two clades called Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 in this analysis are 7.8-

8% divergent. Hapalidiaceae sp. 10 comprised two specimens (IBC1685 and IBC1688) 

with no intraspecific variation. 

The Sporolithales are represented in the general tree for COI-5P; however the 

detailed results for this order will be presented in the next chapter.

psbA  

The general ML tree obtained from psbA analysis (Fig. 12) is edited to show the 

backbone and the overall diversity; black dots at the terminal tips indicate sequences 

generated in this study while red dots indicate sequences downloaded from Genbank.  

Corallinales were not monophyletic and the two clades formed were split into 

two subtrees (Figs. 13 and 14) for a better visualization. The Neogoniolithon clade is 

shown in Fig. 13 and was formed by two species from Brazil and 10 specimens from the 

database and received low to moderate support in the BI analysis (0.50), strong support 

in the NJ analysis (99) and was not supported in the ML analysis. Neogoniolithon 

brassica-florida from Spain grouped with IBC1216 in a clade with strong support 

(99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and also supported as a single species in the 

ABGD analysis; they present 2.1% of variation but because this specimen (IBC1216) 

appeared in the COI-5P tree (Fig. 9) and was named as Neogoniolithon sp. 1, we have 

kept the annotation from the previous tree. Neogoniolithon spectabile from Mexico 

grouped with our Neogoniolithon sp. 2 (IBC1585) with strong support (99/1/100 ML, 

BI and NJ respectively), although the ABGD analysis split them into two different 

entities and they are 4.1% divergent.  

The second clade containing species of Corallinaceae (Fig. 14) was not 

supported in any of the analyses. Corallinaceae sp. 6 (IBC1917) was nested in a clade 

with species of Hydrolithon from the Pacific with strong support in ML and NJ analyses 

(99 and 99) but no support for BI; the species from Brazil is sister to Hydrolithon sp. 

(GQ917475) from Fiji with strong support in ML and NJ analyses (98 and 96 

respectively) but no support for BI (probably due to missing data from the species from 

Fiji – if we consider the same length for both sequences the divergence is 0.8%); ABGD 

75 



analysis supported the two specimens as a single species. Corallinaceae sp. 7 (IBC1537) 

formed a clade with Hydrolithon onkodes from New Caledonia and is close related to 

this Hydrolithon clade I with low support for ML (50) and no support for BI and NJ; the 

two species grouped with strong support (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and 

ABGD analysis split them as separate entities; interspecific variation when the 

sequences were cropped to the same length is 4.3%. Corallinaceae sp. 2 (IBC1228) and 

Corallinaceae sp. 4 (IBC1222) were nested in a clade with no support with 

Metagoniolithon spp. and Pneophyllum spp. The two species were sister to each other in 

a clade with strong support for ML and NJ analyses (99 and 100 respectively) and 

showed 9.3% interspecific variation.  

Corallinaceae sp. 8 (IBC1798 and IBC1919) is nested in a second clade with 

Hydrolithon species also from the Pacific. This clade received moderate support in the 

ML analysis (67) and strong to moderate support in BI and NJ (.94 and 72 respectively). 

The specimens IBC1798 and IBC1919 (Corallinaceae sp. 8) clustered with strong 

support (99/1/98 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and showed only 0.3% divergence; 

ABGD also supported them as a single entity. Corallinaceae sp. 9 (IBC1752), 

Corallinaceae sp. 1 (IBC1247) and Corallinaceae sp. 5 (IBC1737) formed a clade with 

moderate to strong support (82/1/86 ML, BI and NJ respectively) although the three 

taxa represent different entities, with Corallinales sp. 1 shown as being sister to 

Corallinales sp. 5 with moderate support for ML (78) and no support for BI and NJ; the 

three species are 9.2-11.8% different from each other.  

The Lithophylloideae clade is monophyletic, but with no support; Lithophyllum 

sp. 2 (IBC1793, IBC1795 and IBC1921) comprised a strongly supported clade 

(99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with 0.2% of intraspecific variation and was 

sister to a clade of Lithophyllum sp. from USA with low to moderate support for ML 

76 



and no support for BI and NJ. Lithophyllum sp. 4 (IBC1507, IBC1872 and IBC1873) 

comprised a strongly supported clade (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with no 

intraspecific variation and was sister to a clade formed by Titanoderma sp. from USA 

with no support from ML, BI and NJ. Lithophyllum sp. 3 (IBC1726) was also nested in 

the larger Lithophylloideae clade and was sister to Lithophyllum margaritae from 

Mexico with strong support (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively); the two specimens 

are 1.9% divergent, although they are delimited as a single species by ABGD, but for 

now we are going to keep the annotation from rbcL-3P results and maintain IBC1726 as 

Lithophyllum sp. 3 in the tree. Lithophyllum atlanticum (IBC1527) was also nested in 

the larger Lithophylloideae clade and was sister to another Lithophyllum margaritae 

also from Mexico with strong support (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) but 

showed interspecific variation of 5.5%. 

The Hapalidiales in the analyses for psbA were monophyletic but there is no 

support for the deeper nodes (Fig. 15).  Hapalidiacae sp. 4 comprised a cluster with 

strong support (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) that was composed of IBC1246, 

IBC1562, IBC1662, IBC1680, IBC1710, IBC1804 and IBC1909, with intraspecific 

variation of 0.2-0.3% and supported by ABGD; the species is sister to Hapalidiaceae sp. 

1 (IBC1790) and the two species diverge 7.2-7.3%.  

Hapalidiaceae sp. 9, Hapalidiaceae sp. 13, Hapalidiaceae sp. 7, Hapalidiaceae sp. 

12, Hapalidiaceae sp. 10, Hapalidiaceae sp. 6 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 formed a strongly 

supported clade (97/0.95/100 ML, BI and NJ respectively) with Lithothamion, 

Mesophyllum and an unidentified species from the North Atlantic and Pacific. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 9 (IBC1886) grouped with Lithothamnion sp. (KJ710353) from 

France in a clade with strong support (98/1/90 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and with 

16.4% divergence between each other, although the Genbank sequence is shorter due to 

77 



missing data and when cropped to the same length, the divergence between the two 

sequences is only 0.4%; Hapalidiaceae sp. 13 (IBC1553) was sister to this clade also 

with strong support (98/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) and was 1.3% different from 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 9 (IBC1886) and 1.2% divergent (when excluding missing data) from 

Hapalidiaceae sp. from France; nevertheless, ABGD supports the three species as a 

single entity. Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 (IBC1245, IBC1547 and IBC1882) showed 

intraspecific variation of 0.1-0.2% and was sister to Hapalidiaceae sp. 12 (IBC1703) 

with moderate to strong support for ML and BI (86 and .96 respectively) and no support 

for NJ and showed 5.2% of interspecific variation. Hapalidiaceae sp. 10 (IBC1685 and 

IBC1688) is an independent clade with no intraspecific variation. Hapalidiaceae sp. 6 is 

also nested in this clade and is more closely related to Hapalidiaceae sp. 8. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 (IBC1869) grouped with Mesophyllum spp. from Spain and 

Portugal in a clade with low to moderate support for NJ (64) and no support for ML and 

BI; the four specimens in this clade were 1.2-2% divergent and ABGD supports them as 

a single entity.  

Mesophyllum erubescens (IBC1712, IBC1765 and IBC1877) grouped with a 

species from Brazil with the same epithet from Genbank (KM983046) and shows 0.2% 

intraspecific variation; ABGD also delimited them being the same species.  

Lithothamnion sp. 1 and Lithothamnion sp. 2 were nested in a clade with 

Phymatholithon spp. and Lithothamnion spp. Hapalidiaceae sp. 11 (IBC1865) was sister 

to a species of Lithothamnion from Fiji (GQ917461) with no support in any analysis, 

and with an interspecific variation of 7.2% (when missing data were excluded). 

Lithothamnion sp.1 comprised the specimens IBC1704, IBC1708, IBC1907, IBC1910 

and IBC1525 within a clade with strong support (87/1/99 ML, BI and NJ respectively) 

and with intraspecific variation of 2.3%; ABGD supported the four specimens as a 

78 



single species. Lithothamnion sp. 1 was sister to an unidentified Hapalidiaceae 

specimen (JQ896242) from Mexico with strong support (99/1/100 ML, BI and NJ 

respectively) with interspecific variation of 3.9-4.4%. 

The Sporolithales were represented in the general tree for psbA, but the results for this 

order will be presented in the next chapter; as explained previously in the COI-5P 

section.

Morphological and Anatomical results 

Here in we show the morphological and anatomical results obtained in this study. 

Most part of the SEM images was generated at UL Lafayette in collaboration with Dr. 

Suzanne Fredericq and Dr. Joseph Richards. 

All specimens analyzed in this study were non-parasitic, calcified and showed non-

geniculate thalli. The samples were first analyzed using molecular markers and 

separated in the different molecular clades (i.e. species). We tried to obtain good 

images to least one specimen of each different clade in order to cover the anatomical 

diversity of CCA along the Brazilian coast. Unfortunately, some specimens were very 

degraded, or had only one specimen (i. e. small pieces) or the images generated were 

not good or informative enough to be shown, or even all of the above; therefore for 

some species we could not show anatomical observations.

Corallinaceae sp. 2  

Specimen IBC1228 (Fig. 16A) was collected in Espírito Santo state, growing attached 

to a rock in the intertidal (for more collection information see Tab.3). Thallus  

encrusting, smooth with no protuberances forming a very thin crust; color is pale 

purple with white spots (Fig. 16A). Thallus construction consists of a multilayered 

hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments (Figs. 16B-D) with rectangular-

shaped cells growing parallel to the substratum and towards thallus surface (Figs. 16C-

D; arrows) and perithallial filaments (Fig. 16E) growing perpendicular to the 

substratum. Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Figs. 16E, 16F, 

arrows). Trichocytes present (Figs. 16E, 16F, “T”) but not found buried. Epithallial 

cells (Fig. 16H) with two layers, heavily calcified cell walls but not at the roof (roof 

sloughed-off), with short flattened-shaped lumens (Fig. 16H, arrows); initials cells 

(Fig. 16H, “i” initial cells) short but at least two times the size of the epithallial cells. 

Uniporate conceptacles (Figs. 17A-17D; arrows) were observed from surface view and 

were not possible to be interpreted as being tetrasporangial or gametangial. 

Distribution: This species was only found in Espírito Santo state (for more collection 

information see Tab.3).

Corallinaceae sp. 4  

Specimen IBC1222 was collected in Espírito Santo state in the intertidal, growing 

detached from the substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 18A) in the intertidal (for more 

collection information see Tab.3). Thallus lumpy with a few protuberances; color is 

pale purple to purple with white spots (Fig. 18A). Thallus construction consists of a 

multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments (Figs. 18B-18D) with 

rectangular-shaped cells growing parallel to the substratum and towards thallus surface 

(Fig. 18E, 18F, arrows) and perithallial filaments (Fig. 18E) growing perpendicular to 

the substratum. Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Figs. 18G, 

arrows). Trichocytes present (data not shown). Epithallial cells with one layer, heavily 

calcified cell walls but not at the roof (roof sloughed-off), short flattened-shaped 

lumens (Fig. 18H, arrows). Slightly raised uniporate conceptacles were found at the 

surface, (Figs. 19A, 19G, 19H; pore “p”), and old conceptacles were found buried 

throughout the thallus (Figs. 19A-B, arrows). Conceptacles were found usually in 

clusters of two or more (Fig. 19C, arrows). Vegetative filaments observed filling 

empty post-spore release conceptacles (Fig. 19D). Uniporate conceptacles were 

interpreted as being tetrasporangial as some of them showed zonately divided mature 

tetraspores (Figs. 19F and 19H, tetraspores “t”); single pore channel formed by 

filaments 7-8 cells long (Fig. 19H). 

Distribution: This species was only found in Espírito Santo state (for more collection 

information see Tab.3).

Corallinaceae sp. 5  

Specimen IBC1737 was collected in Bahia state in the subtidal (6m depth - for more 

collection information see Tab. 3). Specimen was found growing detached from the 

substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 20A – shows the rhodolith already broken). Thallus 

external morphology is lumpy with protuberances; color is pink with white spots (Fig. 

20A). The species possesses a thick thallus (Fig. 20B, upper white brackets) shown 

growing over another coralline alga (Fig. 20B, lower black brackets). Thallus 

construction consists of a multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial 

filaments with rectangular-shaped cells growing parallel to the substratum and some 

filaments curving upward towards the thallus surface (Fig. 20C, arrow) and others 

curving downwards to form to the contours of the substratum (Fig. 20D, arrows) and 

perithallial filaments (Fig. 20G) growing perpendicular to the substratum. Adjacent 

perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Figs. 20E, arrows). Trichocytes were 

not present. Epithallus consisted of a single layered of calcified cells with flattened-

shaped lumens (Fig. 20H, “e”-epithallial cell). Initials cells long; at least three times 

the size of the epithallial cells (Fig. 20H, “i”-initial cells). Raised uniporate 

conceptacles were found at the surface, raised (Figs. 21A-21F, “p”- pore) and were 

empty, therefore not possible to be interpreted as being tetrasporangial or gametangial; 

pore channel projects into the conceptacle (Fig. 21D, arrow). 

Distribution: This species was only found in Bahia state (for more collection 

information see Tab.3).

Specimen IBC1726 (Fig. 22A) was collected in Bahia state and specimen IBC1878 

(Fig. 22B) was collected in Espírito Santo state (for more collection information see 

Tab.3). Both specimens were collected in the intertidal, growing detached from the 

substratum as rhodoliths. Thalli smooth to lumpy with protuberances, dark red to 

purple (Fig. 22A) and smooth to warty, light pink (Fig. 22B). The species possesses a 

thick thallus (Fig. 22C) and its construction consists of a single layered hypothallus 

comprised of filaments with squared to rectangular-shaped cells (black arrows) 

growing parallel to the substratum in the z-axis and perithallial filaments growing 

towards thallus surface (Figs. 22D, black arrows). Adjacent filaments linked by 

secondary pit connections only (Figs. 22D, white arrows). Trichocytes were not 

observed. Epithallial cells with flattened or rounded lumens (Fig. 22E). Uniporate 

conceptacles were interpreted as being tetrasporangial (Fig. 22E, “t” - tetraspores); 

buried empty conceptacles present (Fig. 22A- arrow).

15m depth - for more collection information see Tab.3). Specimen was found growing 

detached from the substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 23A– shows the rhodolith already 

broken). Thallus is fruticose; color is pale purple to gray (Fig. 23A). Thallus very thick 

(Figs. 23B, 23C); construction and orientation of hypothallial filaments not clearly 

observed. Perithallial filaments (Figs. 23D-F) grow perpendicular to the substratum. 

Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 23F, arrows). 

Trichocytes present and tightly packed horizontal fields (that lack vegetative filaments 

between them) (Figs. 23G-H, “T” - trichocytes) and also found buried (Fig 23D, “T” -

epithallial cells), calcified cell walls with roofs sloughed-off, flattened or rounded-

shaped lumens (Fig. 23H, “e” – epithallial cell); initials cells short (Fig. 23H, “i” – 

initial cell). Uniporate conceptacles found at the surface, flushed (Figs. 24A-C); 

putative old conceptacles were found buried and infilled (see Fig. 24B, arrows in 

previous plate). Uniporate conceptacles were interpreted as being tetrasporangial as 

they showed mature, zonately divided tetraspores (Figs. 24A, 24B; tetraspore “t”); 

single pore channel formed by filaments at least 10 cells long (Fig. 24C). Trichocytes 

present at the surface (Fig. 24B, arrow) and buried (Fig. D, “T”- trichocytes) next to

Specimen IBC1919 was collected in Fernando de Noronha Island in the subtidal (10-

15m depth - for more collection information see Tab.3). Specimen was found growing 

detached from the substratum, as a rhodolith (Figs. 25A, 25B – shows the rhodolith 

already broken). Thallus is lumpy to warty with large protuberances; color is pale 

purple with white spots (Figs. 25A, 25B). Thallus construction not clearly observed. 

Less calcified large cells were observed forming the epithallus (Fig. 25C, upper black

26E); old conceptacles were found buried throughout the thallus (Figs. 26A and 26B, 

arrows) completely (Fig. 26A) or partially (Fig. 26B) filled with remnant cellular 

material. Uniporate conceptacles at the surface were empty and therefore not possible 

to be interpreted as being tetrasporangial or gametangial. Trichocytes found next to 

uniporate conceptacles (Fig. 26E, “T”-trichocytes; “p”-pore). Pore channel formed by 

filaments at least 7 cells long (Fig. 26F, “p”-pore).

Neogoniolithon sp. 1 

Specimen IBC1216 was collected in Espírito Santo state in the intertidal (for more 

collection information see Tab.3). Specimen was found growing detached from the 

substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 27A). Thallus is lumpy to warty with small spike-like 

protuberances; color is pale purple (Fig. 27A). Fractures throughout the thallus did not 

show thallus construction clearly. Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions 

only (Fig. 27B, arrows). Trichocytes not observed. Epithallial cells (Figs. 27C, 27D) 

with up to three layers, calcified cell walls, rounded-shaped lumens (Fig. 27D, “e” – 

epithallial cell); initials cells long; at least two times the size of the epithallial cells 

(Fig. 27D, “i” – initial cell). Uniporate conceptacles found at the surface, raised and 

round-shaped (Figs. 28A, 28C). Fractures in a spike-like branch shows uniporate 

conceptacles and it is interpreted as being tetrasporangial as it showed divided mature 

tetraspores (Figs. 28G, 28H, tetraspore “t”); single pore (Figs. 28C-28E, arrows). 

Distribution: This species was also found in a different location in the same state

Lithothamnion sp. 1 

 Specimen IBC1704 (Fig. 29A) was collected in Bahia state whereas specimen 

IBC1564 (Fig. 29B) was collected in Paraíba state, and both were collected in the 

intertidal. Specimen IBC1557 (Fig. 29C) was collected in Ceará state in the subtidal 

(8m depth). All three specimens were found growing detached from the substratum, as 

rhodoliths (for more collection information see Tab.3). Thalli fruticose with numerous 

protuberances (Fig. 29A, 29B) or warty (Fig. 29C); color dark pink to purple (Fig. 

29A, 29B). Fractures showing protuberances were composed largely of vegetative 

filaments (Figs. 30A) with radial construction. Newly formed hypothallus consisting 

of multiple layers of hypothallial filaments comprised of rectangular shaped cells (Fig. 

30B, arrow) was observed growing over the surface of the older growth layer. Newly 

formed rectangular hypothallial cells apparently cut off from cells of the perithallus in 

the older growth layer. The hypothallial filaments grow parallel to the surface of the 

older growth layer and give rise to the next layer of perithallus. Adjacent perithallial 

filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 30C, 30E, arrows). Fractures of 

protuberances show the perithallus consisted of filaments with alternating layers of 

cells with thick, heavily calcified cell walls (Fig. 30D, brackets; Fig. 30F arrows) and 

cells with thin, weakly calcified cell walls (Fig. 30D black arrow). Epithallus consists 

of short, flattened epithallial cells with heavily calcified lateral and proximal cell 

walls, a trapezoidal shaped cell lumen and a thinner, weakly calcified epithallial cell 

roof (Fig. 30F, “e”-epithallial cells); initial cells appeared to be recently divided as 

they are shorter than the cells right below them (Fig. 30F, “i”-initial cells). A single 

putative buried multiporate conceptacle was identified (Figs. 31A-B) although multi 

pore channels were not shown clearly. 

117 



Distribution: This species was also found in Espírito Santo (IBC1525) (for more 

collection information see Tab.3).

Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 

 Specimen IBC1790 was collected in Bahia state in the intertidal (for more collection 

information see Tab.3). The specimen was found growing detached from the 

substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 32A). Thallus is lumpy to warty with small 

protuberances; color is orange to dark red white spots (Fig. 32A, arrows). Surface 

view shows that the white spots are multiporate conceptacle plates (Fig. 32B, arrows). 

Fractures show thallus construction consisted of a multilayered hypothallus comprised 

of hypothallial filaments with rectangular-shaped cells (Fig. 32C, straight arrows) 

growing parallel to the substratum and towards thallus surface (Fig. 32C, upward 

arrow). Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 32D, arrows). 

Putative dinoflagellate-like round-shaped structures were observed growing inside 

perithallial cells (Fig. 32E, arrows). Epithallus consists of short flattened epithallial 

cells with trapezoidal shaped cell lumen and a weakly calcified epithallial cell roof 

(Fig. 32F, “e”-epithallial cells) that are almost sloughing-off from the thallus (Fig. 

32F, arrow).  

Multiporate conceptacles found at the surface, slightly raised to completely flushed 

(Figs. 33A, 33C, 33D). Superficial views show multiple opened pores in the 

conceptacle plates (Figs. 33A, 33B; arrows) and also plugged pores (Fig. 33B, 

arrowhead). Fractures through the protuberances show multiple pores channels in the 

tetrasporangial conceptacles (Figs. 33C-33F, arrows); pore channels formed by 6-8

Hapalidiaceae sp. 2 

 Specimen IBC1196 was collected in Espírito Santo state in the intertidal (for more 

collection information see Tab.3). Specimen was found growing on rocky substratum 

(Fig. 34A). Thallus is encrusting, smooth with sparse protuberances and also layered; 

color is dark pink to purple with few white spots (Fig. 34A). Fractures show thallus is 

composed of a thin crust (Figs. 34B-D). Aragonite infill was observed in spaces 

between substrata and thallus layers (Fig. 34E, straight arrow). Thallus construction 

consists of a multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments with 

rectangular-shaped cells growing parallel to the substratum and curving towards 

thallus surface (Fig. 34B, brackets, 34C-D, arrows) and perithallial filaments growing 

perpendicular to the substratum (Fig. 34E, upward arrow). Adjacent perithallial 

filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 34F, arrows). Perithallus consists of cells 

with thick, heavily calcified cell walls (Fig. 34F). Epithallus consists of short, flattened 

epithallial cells with thick weakly calcified epithallial cell roof (Fig. 34F, “e”-

epithallial cells) that are almost sloughing-off from the thallus (Fig. 34F, arrow). 

Putative dinoflagellate-like round-shaped structures were observed growing inside 

perithallial cells (Fig. 34H, arrows). No reproductive structures were found for this 

species. 

Distribution: This species was only found in Espírito Santo state (for more collection 

information see Tab.3).

Specimen IBC1562 was collected in Maranhão state in the subtidal (15-30m depth) 

and was found growing detached from the substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 35A), 

IBC1657 (Fig. 35B) and IBC1662 (Fig. 35C) were collected in Ceará state in the 

intertidal, both of them growing encrusting rocky substrate, IBC1804 (Fig. 35D), 

IBC1850 (Fig. 35E) were collected in Rio Grande do Norte in two different location, 

both of them were collected in the intertidal, the former was found encrusting a rocky 

substratum and the latter was found growing detached from the substratum, as a 

rhodolith (Figs. 35D, 35E, respectively) (for more collection information see Tab.3). 

Thalli encrusting, smooth with sparse protuberances, layered, lumpy and warty; color 

varied from pink, dark pink, red and purple (Fig. 35A-E). Fractures show thallus is 

thick (Fig. 36A). Thallus construction consists of a multilayered hypothallus 

comprised of hypothallial filaments with rectangular-shaped cells (Fig. 36C, arrows) 

growing parallel to the substratum (Fig. 36B, brackets) and towards thallus surface and 

perithallial filaments growing perpendicular to the substratum (Fig. 36B, upward 

arrow). Perithallus consists of cells with thick, heavily calcified cell walls (Fig. 36D). 

Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 36E, arrows). 

Epithallus consists of short, flattened epithallial cells (data not shown). Putative 

dinoflagellate-like round-shaped structures/individuals were observed growing inside 

perithallial cells (Fig. 36F, arrows).  

Multiporate conceptacles found at the surface, slightly raised to completely flushed 

(Figs. 37A, B, E). Superficial views show multiple opened pores in the conceptacle 

plates (Figs. 37A, C, D; arrows). Fractures through the protuberances show multiple 

pores channels in the tetrasporangial conceptacles (Figs. 37C-37F, arrows); pore 

127 



channels filaments were 7-8 cells long. Buried conceptacles were observed (Fig. 37C,

Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 

 Specimen IBC1876 was collected in Espírito Santo state in the intertidal (for more 

collection information see Tab.3). Specimen was found growing detached from the 

substratum, as a rhodolith (Fig. 38A). Thallus fruticose with numerous protuberances 

(Fig. 38A). Fractures show protuberances composed largely of vegetative filaments 

(Figs. 38B, E, F) with radial construction. Newly formed hypothallus consisting of 

multiple layers of hypothallial filaments comprised of rectangular shaped cells (Fig. 

38C, D, arrows) was observed growing over the surface of the older growth layer. 

Newly formed rectangular hypothallial cells are apparently cut off from cells of the 

perithallus in the older growth layer. The hypothallial filaments were observed 

growing parallel to the surface of the older growth layer and parallel to perithallus 

(Fig. 38E, upward arrow). Perithallus consists of filaments with alternating layers of 

cells with thick, heavily calcified cell walls (Fig. 38F, black brackets) and cells with 

thin, weakly calcified cell walls (Fig. 38F, white brackets). Adjacent perithallial 

filaments linked by cell fusions only (Fig. 38G, arrows). Epithallus consists of short, 

flattened epithallial cells with heavily calcified lateral and proximal cell walls, a 

trapezoidal shaped cell lumen and a thinner, calcified epithallial cell roof (Fig. 38H, 

“e”-epithallial cells); initial cells appeared to be recently divided as they are shorter 

than the cells right below them (Fig. 38H, “i”-initial cells). No reproductive structures 

were found for this species. 

Distribution: This species was also found in Paraíba (IBC1245) and Bahia (IBC1547) 

states both of them we collected in the intertidal (for more collection information see 

Tab.3).

Hapalidiaceae sp. 10 

 Specimens IBC1685 and IBC1688 were collected in Ceará state in the intertidal (for 

more collection information see Tab.3). Specimens were found growing detached from 

the substratum, as rhodoliths (Figs. 39A, 39B). Thalli smooth with sparse 

protuberances and lumpy to warty; color varies from pink to dark pink (Fig. 39A-

39B). Fractures show thallus is not very thick (Fig. 39C-E). Thallus construction 

consists of a multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments with 

rectangular-shaped cells (Fig. 39F, arrows) growing parallel to the substratum and 

towards thallus surface and perithallial filaments growing perpendicular to the 

substratum (Fig. 39F, upward arrow). Perithallus consists of cells with thick, heavily 

calcified cell walls (Fig. 39G). Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions 

only (Fig. 39G, arrows). Epithallus consists of short, flattened epithallial cells (Fig. 

39H, “e”-epithallial); initial cells appeared to be recently divided as they are shorter 

than the cells right below them (Fig. 39H, “i”-initial cells).  

Multiporate conceptacles found at the surface, slightly raised to raised (Figs. 40A-

40G). Surface views show multiple opened pores in the conceptacle plates (Figs. 40D-

40F, arrows); rosettes that surround pore channels were composed of 4-6 cells (Figs. 

40E-40H). Fractures through the multiporate conceptacles (Figs. 41A-41F) showed 

multiple pore channels in the tetrasporangial conceptacles (Figs. 41E, arrows); pore 

channels filaments 7-8cells long. Buried conceptacles were observed (Fig. 41C, 

arrows) infilled by vegetative growth. Some buried empty conceptacles (Fig. 41C, 

black arrow) were also observed to be infilled by putative aragonite crystals (Fig. 41C, 

white arrow).

Discussion 

Success of amplification and sequencing among molecular markers  

Out of 232 samples for which DNA was extracted, a total of 172 were successfully 

amplified for at least one of the four markers used in this study, therefore our success 

rate was 75% overall. We expected this number to be higher considering the markers we 

used targeted the genomes of different organelles and the primers used were universal, 

designed for red algae specifically (or for red, green, and brown algae).  However, 

considering the endophytic microalgal (see Figs. 34H, 36F component of coralline algae 

and the difficulty in obtaining clean amplicons, extraction and amplification in this 

group was relatively more problematic compared to other groups (personal 

communication from many researchers who study corallines).   

For UPA we obtained 54 sequences out of nearly 180 samples we attempted to 

amplify (30% success rate). UPA has been shown to be a marker that is relatively easy 

to amplify and sequence (Sherwood et al. 2010a), and was used here for an initial 

screening of samples despite its lower rates of variation compared to other molecular 

markers such as COI-5P (Sherwood et al. 2010b) and psbA (Vidal et al., 2003, Costa et 

al. 2012, Sissini et al. 2014, Iha et al. 2015, Torrano-Silva, 2015). We began this study 

focusing on the Sporolithales and as we advanced, UPA, which is a more conserved 

marker (Sherwood et al., 2010a, b), did not show enough signal to delimit species 

boundaries for this group. The PCR success rate was also lower than expected, which 

further limited the utility of this marker. Even after modifications of PCR conditions 

and the application of newly synthesized primers, little change was observed regarding 

the rates of success for PCR, so we decided not to continue using UPA as our primary 

142 



marker for DNA barcoding. Furthermore, we observed that after 2010, the amount of 

sequences available for comparison in Genbank did not increase much, and relatively 

few studies utilized this marker from 2011 through 2015 (Sissini et al. 2014).  

The rbcL-3P is a very important marker as some types have been successfully 

sequenced for this region of rbcL (Gabrielson et al. 2011, Hind et al. 2014). We 

attempted to amplify this region for almost 180 samples, but were successful for only 47 

sequences (25% success rate). This low success rate may be due to the high level of 

diversity of samples from different orders we were working with, making it very 

difficult to keep track of what combination of primers and PCR conditions could work 

better for which order/family/genera. In fact we tried a large amount of primer 

combinations (see Tab. 4 for more details), but overall we only obtained good quality 

sequences with the following pairs of primers: F-753/R-rbcSstart and F-993/R-rbcSstart 

(Freshwater &amp;amp; Rueness, 1994).  

For the COI-5P we obtained 101 sequences out of 232 samples (43% success rate). 

This region is considered the DNA barcode of most organisms that possess 

mitochondria (Hebert et al. 2003) and has been recommended to be used for the 

Rhodophyta (Saunders 2005) and Corallinophycideae (Walker et al. 2009). Although 

the success rate for this marker is less than 50%, the effort to obtain good quality 

sequences was justified as it has proven to be the more variable marker when compared 

to psbA, rbcL-3P and UPA (see Table 6 for more details). The most successful 

combination of primers among the ones we tested was GwsFn x GwsRi (Le Gall &amp;amp; 

Saunders, 2010) (see Tab. 4 to see the list of primers we tested). This specific marker is 

known to be difficult to amplify even for other groups of Rhodophyta as many authors 

have reported (for Gracilariales - Costa 2013, Medeiros 2013, for Hypnea - Nauer 2013, 

for Gelidiales - Iha 2014). The discrepancy in the number of good quality sequences 

143 



obtained to this marker versus the number of sequences in the matrix constructed to this 

chapter analyses is due to Sporolithon specimens, for which we generated and used 

more sequences to construct a matrix with only Sporolithales taxa (results are shown in 

the next chapter). 

For the psbA we obtained 96 sequences out of approximately 180 samples (53% 

success rate), the same set that we tried for the rbcL-3P. This marker was successfully 

applied to other groups of Rhodophyta (Seo et al., 2003; Yang &amp;amp; Boo, 2004) and to the 

CCA (Broom et al. 2008, Bittner et al. 2011, Pardo et al. 2014, Richards et al. 2014, 

Sissini et al. 2014), and although none of these studies reported the successful rates of 

amplification, most of them reported that it is an easily amplifiable marker.  

Considering that we worked with a very wide set of samples from different genera 

and orders, these resulting success rates are satisfactory. Also the use of a combination 

of different markers enabled us to obtain molecular data for a larger array of samples 

(65%) than each individual marker. 

Intraspecific and Interspecific divergence among molecular markers x orders 

We compared intraspecific variation among molecular markers and orders, with 

the exception of Sporolithales species (discussed in detail in the next chapter). 

Intraspecific variation presented in Table 6, represents the divergences found in our own 

dataset; the interspecific variation was calculated based on the species we found in 

Brazil compared to species from the same order downloaded from Genbank. In general, 

all of the interspecific divergence values we observed are in accordance to those found 

in previous studies for the Rhodophyta, including other CCA (Saunders 2005, Cassano 

2009, Broom et al. 2008, Clarkston &amp;amp; Saunders 2010, Freshwater et al. 2010, Milstein 

144 



et al. 2012, Hind &amp;amp; Saunders 2013, Iha 2014, Nauer 2013, Sissini et al. 2014, Vieira-

Pinto et al. 2014).  

In order to not overestimate the diversity of species found, we used a conservative 

approach. Therefore, some intraspecific variation values need to be taken in 

consideration carefully as the values may in fact represent the divergence between very 

closely related species, especially with UPA and psbA values, as in the case of 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 that presented 1.3% intraspecific variation for UPA, whereas 

referenced studies presents 0-0.8% intraspecific variation and 0.6-8.4% of interspecific 

variation, and Lithothamnion sp. 1 that presented 2.3% intraspecific variation for psbA, 

whereas referenced studies presents 0-0.3%intraspecific variation and 2.5-13.1% of 

interspecific variation (see Table 6 for details).  

Intraspecific divergence observed among the Corallinales in this study for UPA 

and COI-5P was in accordance to what was found in previous studies (Table 6). RbcL-

3P and psbA showed a relatively high-end intraspecific divergence (0.7% and 0.9% 

respectively) nearly overlapping with the low-end of interspecific divergences 

previously found for these markers (Table 6). Values for rbcL-3P are not well 

stablished. For example, a recent study that used this region in a single locus-analysis 

did not report any intraspecific divergence (Sissini et al., 2014), therefore it was not 

possible to evaluate if the divergence values we found for rbcL-3P among the 

Corallinales represent in fact two separate species or if it correspond to a real 

intraspecific variation.  

The intraspecific divergence observed among the Hapalidiales for rbcL-3P and for 

the COI-5P was in accordance to what was found in previous studies (Table 6). UPA 

and psbA showed the relatively high-end of divergence (1.3 and 2.3%, respectively) 

145 



overlapping or almost overlapping with the values for the low-end of interspecific 

divergences previously found for these markers. 

Unfortunately, as we did not obtain all four markers for the exact same samples, it 

is impossible to directly compare the diversity found for each marker.  

Considering the rates of success and the divergence values for each marker, the 

most applicable markers to use in a more comprehensive approach are COI-5P and 

psbA followed by rbcL-3P. These results corroborate similar previous studies that used 

COI-5P and psbA to reveal diversity among the CCA in other regions of the word (Peña 

et al. 2014 for the Caribbean, Pardo et al. 2014, for Europe). Overall, there were no 

notable differences between the orders considering the markers tested in this diversity 

survey.

Diversity of CCA along the Brazilian coast  

This study provides an assessment of the taxonomic diversity of the encrusting 

and rhodolith-forming species collected on the coast of Brazil using molecular tools and 

SEM. Our molecular analyses based on four molecular markers (UPA, rbcL-3P, COI-

5P and psbA) have revealed the occurrence of 37 different species belonging to 

Corallinales and Hapalidiales on the Brazilian coast (Sporolithales are shown in the 

chapter 2). Most importantly, very few of the sequences generated in this study matched 

publicly available sequences. This observation suggests that some species studied are 

potentially new to science, or belong to described species for which no sequence data is 

yet available. In either case, our results show that CCA is a diverse group in Brazil and 

in the Tropical Western Atlantic and will be a significant contribution to the sequence 

databases (e.g. GenBank) for this group of organisms.  

Applying specific epithets and even genus names was very challenging and most 

of the times not yet possible, mainly because for most species found in this study, we 

only collected one or few individuals. In the field, most of the time it was not possible 

to distinguish the CCA by their external morphology, and while we tried to collect an 

abundance of samples, we could not be sure of their identity even at the ordinal level 

(due to the very similar external morphology they present between orders; compare the 

similarity between Figs. 22A – Corallinales and 39A, B – Hapalidiales). Besides that, 

many of the samples were not fertile, therefore applying names correctly becomes even 

more difficult. Also, recent DNA-based studies have revealed multiple, cryptic species 

passing under a single name in the same geographic area (e.g., southern Japan, Kato et 

al., 2013; central New Zealand, Broom et al., 2008, Brazilian coast, Sissini et al., 2014), 

in part because of misapplied names. Therefore, only by sequencing type material, or 

148 



less desirably, samples from a species’ type locality, can names be applied with 

certainty (Hughey et al., 2001, Hughey &amp;amp; Gabrielson, 2012).  

In the following section we discuss some of the applied binomial and generic 

names and the putative species for each family. 

The results of the UPA analysis (Fig. 6) show three applicable names for the 

clade including Corallinales species and one for the clade containing the Hapalidiales. 

Based on this marker, we could identify Lithophyllum atlanticum and L. margaritae. 

Both species were already previously sequenced and well described for Santa Catarina 

state (Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014), therefore no morpho-anatomical investigations were 

made. The third species is Lithophyllum kotschyanum (sequence available from 

Australia, Rösler et al. 2016) that grouped with a specimen from the oceanic island 

Trindade (located 1.167 kilometers from the Brazilian coast) with a strong support in 

the NJ analysis, supported by ABGD analysis and with a low intraspecific variation 

(0.3%). Unfortunately, the Brazilian specimen was much damaged and not reproductive, 

and it was not possible to obtain good images from it. Based on the molecular evidence, 

we are going to tentatively apply this epithet and therefore this is the first record of L. 

kotschyanum for the Atlantic coast. However UPA is a less variable marker (Sherwood 

et al., 2010a, 2010b, Milstein et al. 2012) and L. kotschyanum was originally described 

from the Persian Gulf (Woelkerling et al. 2005). Furthermore, Rösler et al. (2016) in 

their multigene analysis, show several paraphyletic branches of specimens assigned to 

L. kotschyanum and morphologically related species (Pacific and Indian ocean), 

suggesting that the type needs to be sequenced to better address the relationship 

between specimens from outside the Indian ocean.

In the Hapalidiales, we could also apply a name to Mesophyllum erubescens, as 

this species grouped with the holotype in the rbcL-3P analysis (see Fig. 7 in the results 

section) and is very well described from the Atlantic (Horta et al., 2011, Costa et al., 

2014b, Sissini et al. 2014), therefore no morpho-anatomical investigations were made 

for this species. 

For three other specimens, using the UPA, we could apply a name at the generic 

rank: Lithophyllum sp. 1, Neogoniolithon sp. 1 and and Lithothamnion sp. 1. 

Lithophyllum sp. 1 grouped with other known species of this genus, but unfortunately 

the sample was non-reproductive. Based on the cell shapes and the predominant 

occurrence of secondary pit connections and absence of cell fusions (data not shown), 

we concluded that this is the appropriate genus to apply to this specimen. The specimen 

Neogoniolithon sp. 1 was fertile (tetrasporophyte - Fig. 28) and all the characters 

exhibited matched the genus description (e.g. presence of cells fusions and absence of 

secondary pit connection) and therefore we also concluded that this is the appropriate 

genus to apply to this specimen. Lithothamnion sp. 1 was identified based on further 

analyses of psbA and also due characteristic generic features of this genus (e. g. flared 

epithallial cells [i.e. with a trapezoidal lumen] – Fig. 30-F). 

Based on the data we have so far, we were uncertain of genus and species 

names, therefore all remaining species shown in this tree were named only at the family 

rank. We chose to take a more conservative approach as to not misapply any names that 

might lead readers to confusion when using these data for comparison.  

The results of the rbcL-3P analysis (Fig. 7) show four specimens to which we 

could apply a genus name. Lithophyllum sp. 2 and Lithophyllum sp. 3 grouped with 

other Lithophyllum species and we further show these specimens are nested in a large 

150 



clade of Lithophylloideae species. Also, Lithophyllum sp. 3 grouped with other 

Lithophyllym species in the psbA analysis, and its anatomy matches that of this genus. 

In the Hapalidiales clade, Mesophyllum erubescens was the only species identified as 

the specimens of this clade grouped with a holotype (voucher TRH C15-3212; Genbank 

acc. number KP050698; type locality Fernando de Noronha, Brazil – Sissini et al. 2014) 

from Genbank. Lithothamnion sp. 1 and Lithothamnion sp. 2 were identified based on 

further analyses of psbA and also due characteristic generic features of this genus (e. g. 

flared epithallial cells [ie. with a trapezoidal lumen] – Fig. 30-F for Lithothamnion sp. 1 

and data not shown for Lithothamnion sp. 2). 

All the remaining species shown in this tree were named only to family rank due 

to insufficient or lack of comparable data obtained so far. 

The results of the COI-5P analysis (Figs. 8-11) show seven specimens to which 

available names can be applied. One specimen can be identified to the genus and 

species level and six others can be identified to the genus level. In the Hapalidiales I 

(Fig. 10), Mesophyllum erubescens consisted of a clade, previously shown in rbcL-3P, 

which grouped with a holotype from Genbank (KP050698 – Sissini et al. 2014), 

therefore we were confident to apply this name to those specimens. In the Corallinales 

(Fig. 8), Lithophyllum sp. 2, Lithophyllum sp. 4 and Lithophyllum sp. 5 are nested in a 

larger clade with other Lithophylloideae species. A “Hydrolithon onkodes” (GQ917288 

– Bittner et al. 2011) is also nested in this clade, but this could be a case of a misapplied 

name as there are two other clades containing Hydrolithon species in this tree and there 

is no morphological description for this specimen (Bittner et al. 2011). Neogoniolithon 

sp. 1 is nested in a larger clade with other Neogoniolithon species with moderate 

support (70/1/65 for ML, BI and NJ respectively), and for this species we also generated 

high quality images (Figs. 27-28). The morpho-anatomical features we observed are 

151 



also in accordance with the circumscription of this genus and therefore we were 

confident to apply this genus name. Lithothamnion sp. 1 and Lithothamnion sp. 2 were 

identified based on further analyses of psbA and also due to characteristic generic 

features of this genus (e. g. flared epithallial cells [ie. with a trapezoidal-shaped lumen] 

– Fig. 30-F for Lithothamnion sp. 1 and data not shown for Lithothamnion sp. 2). 

All the remaining species shown in this tree were named only to family rank due 

to insufficient or lack of comparable data obtained so far. 

The results of the psbA analysis (Figs. 12-15) show two applicable specific 

epithets and four genus names that can be applied to Brazilian specimens. Among the 

Corallinales, the Neogoniolithon clade (Fig. 13) received moderate support in BI and NJ 

(0.50 and 99 respectively) whereas species of Neogoniolithon from different oceans, 

e.g. Pacific and North Atlantic, grouped together. Therefore, we could name 

Neogoniolithon sp. 1 and Neogoniolithon sp. 2 with confidence. Neogoniolithon sp. 1 is 

sister to N. brassica-florida from Spain, but showed 2.1% of divergence, moreover this 

species is often confused with Neogoniolithon fosliei, a species that has been referred to 

Brazil (Bahia 2014) and as our species did not present all reported features to confirm 

the identity, we applied the genus name only. Neogoniolithon sp. 2 grouped with 

Neogoniolithon spectabile from Mexico, but showed 4.1% of divergence, indicating that 

it might be a different species, and therefore we applied only the genus name for this 

specimen. Lithophyllum atlanticum was identified based on the UPA tree; sample 

IBC1527 grouped with Lithophyllum atlanticum (KP192377) from Genbank. 

Lithophyllum sp. 2, Lithophyllum sp. 3 and Lithophyllum sp. 4 are nested in the same 

clade as Lithophyllum atlanticum, and were also shown to belong to Lithophyllum in the 

other gene trees in this study, therefore we were confident to name these species at 

genus level. In the Hapalidiales clade (Fig. 15), Mesophyllum erubescens consisted of a 

152 



clade previously shown in both rbcL-3P and COI-5P, therefore we were confident to 

apply this name to those specimens. 

Lithothamnion sp. 1 and Lithothamnion sp. 2 grouped with a specimen identified 

as L. muelleri (JQ896242) in this analysis. However, the type locality of L. muelleri, 

which is the generitype of Lithothamnion, is in Australia and the specimen available for 

comparison from Genbank was collected in Mexico. Therefore, the sequence available 

on GenBank is not ideal, considering it would be better to have the type itself or at least 

a topotype to compare.  However, we have decided to tentatively apply this genus name 

in all of our previous trees, based also on the characteristic generic features that the 

species showed (e. g. flared trapezoidal epithallial cells – Fig. 30-F for Lithothamnion 

sp. 1 and data not shown for Lithothamnion sp. 2). Furthermore, we discuss more about 

Lithothamnion sp. 1 in chapter 3 (as Lithothamnion sp. I). 

All of the remaining species shown in this tree were named only to the rank of 

family, due to insufficient or lack of comparable data obtained so far.

Specimens named to rank of family 

Corallinaceae sp. 1, Corallinaceae sp. 5 and Corallinaceae sp. 9 grouped together 

in the psbA analysis (Fig. 14). Though anatomical data were generated only for 

Corallinaceae sp. 5, the results of the psbA analysis indicate the three species likely 

belong to the same genus, considering the clade they formed has a relative high support 

in all three analyses and the interspecific divergence among those three species is 7.8% 

to 10.3%. Anatomical features of Corallinaceae sp. 5 correspond with descriptions of 

Mastophoroideae genera, although is not possible to determine to which one it belongs 

as most genera differ based on spermatangial development and on carposporophyte 

features (Penrose, 1991, Penrose &amp;amp; Woelkerling, 1992, Kato et al., 2011) and no 

gametophytes were found.  

In the UPA analysis, Corallinaceae sp. 1 grouped with Spongites and in psbA 

analysis Corallinaceae sp. 1 and Corallinaceae sp. 5 are nested in a clade with other 

Masthophoroideae (Hydrolithon spp. and Pneophyllum spp.), but apart from Spongites. 

Therefore, until more sequences are generated from additional specimens and 

anatomical features from gametophytes of these taxa are documented, it is not possible 

to resolve their identity. 

Corallinaceae sp. 2 and Corallinaceae sp. 4 likely belong to the same genus, and 

based on the psbA analysis they are nested in a larger clade with other Mastophoroideae 

spp. Both species possess cell fusions and lack secondary pit connections between 

adjacent filaments. Specimens also present trichocytes and flattened epithallial cells, but 

due to the lack of gametophytes we were not able to identify both specimens to genus 

rank. 

Also based on the psbA results, Corallinaceae sp. 6 and Corallinaceae sp. 7 are 

nested in a clade with Hydrolithon species (Fig. 14 - Hydrolithon I) and Corallinaceae 

154 



sp. 8 is nested in another clade containing species of Hydrolithon (Fig. 14 – Hydrolithon 

II).  None of them were named as Hydrolithon because we could not be sure which 

clade in fact corresponds to the real Hydrolithon. Corallinaceae sp. 6 shows some 

features that matched with the Mastophoroideae circumscription (e. g. presence of 

exclusively cell fusions and lack of secondary pit connection with the adjacent 

filaments, presence of trichocytes, uniporate conceptacles), but it is most likely that it 

belongs to the Porolithon genus as it presents tightly packed trichocytes (Fig. 23 – G-H) 

which is diagnostic for this genus (Kato et al. 2011). However, we decided to not 

identify Corallinaceae sp. 6 as Porolithon sp. due to the fact that the circumscription 

and relationship between Porolithon and Hydrolithon are not well resolved and need 

further research (Kato et al. 2011, Bittner et al. 2011, Woelkerling et al. 2012). 

Regarding Corallinaceae sp. 7, it was not possible to confirm whether this species 

belongs to Hydrolithon because no images of this taxon were generated. In regards to 

Corallinaceae sp. 8, this species is nested in the clade that we called Hydrolithon II, 

including a specimen identified as H. reinboldii (GQ917484, Bittner et al. 2011), which 

is the species that typifies the genus. Although this specimen was collected in New 

Caledonia and relatively close to the type locality (Indonesia), the anatomical features 

shown by Corallinaceae sp. 8 (Figs. 26-27) are not in accordance to what is described as 

diagnostic for Hydrolithon. Harvey et al. (2006) state that species belonging to 

Hydrolithon show tetra/bisporangial conceptacle pore canals lined by cells that are 

orientated perpendicularly to the thallus surface, whereas our specimen (Corallinaceae 

sp. 8 – Figs 25 and 26) that grouped in the clade with H. reinboldii shows 

tetrasporangial conceptacle pore canals lined by cells that are orientated parallel to the 

thallus surface (Fig. 26). Therefore, we maintained our specimen as Corallinaceae sp. 8 

instead of naming it a Hydrolithon species.  

155 



As shown previously in the results section, the Hapalidiales clade was not 

monophyletic with the exception of the psbA analysis, and a lot of inconsistences and 

polyphyly were found among genera (e. g. Phymatholithon clades – Fig. 15), which 

made it more difficult to match specimens to a genus in this order. Based on psbA 

analysis, Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 4 are likely to belong to the same 

genus and both species nested in a clade with the Clathromorphum complex. But genera 

among the Clathromorphum complex are restrictively found in cold waters while 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 4 occur in the Tropical Western Atlantic 

which may indicate that these taxa are different genera. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 2, Hapalidiaceae sp. 3 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 5 were not 

successfully amplified for psbA, but they nested within the Hapalidiales in the UPA 

and/or rbcL and COI-5P analyses. For Hapalidiaceae sp. 3 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 5, no 

informative images were generated and unfortunately no more specimens of these 

species were identified in our collections. For Hapalidiaceae sp. 2, vegetative features 

were observed, but no informative characters were found. This specimen exhibited 

some structures that might be benthic dinoflagellate stages inside its cells walls (Fig. 

34H) and similar round/disk-shaped structures were observed in Hapalidiaceae sp. 1 

(Fig. 32E). Krayesky-Self (2015) documented similar structures in rhodoliths and 

reported that studying endolithic relationships between coralline red algae and 

dinoflagellates (or Haptophytes, as she found in her study) could lead to deeper 

understanding of benthic marine ecological patterns in general. Though this was not our 

focus when performing SEM on our samples, we believe it could shed light on studies 

in the future. 

In the psbA analysis (Fig. 15), Hapalidiaceae sp. 6, Hapalidiaceae sp. 7, 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 8, Hapalidiaceae sp. 9, Hapalidiaceae sp. 10, Hapalidiaceae sp. 12 and 

156 



Hapalidiaceae sp. 13 are all nested in one clade with strong support in all analyses; 

therefore we believe that they might represent a single genus that is possibly new to 

science. Between the species in this clade, the interspecific variation ranged from 3.3% 

to 13% in the psbA matrix. As we observed in the psbA tree (Fig. 15), all sequences 

from Genbank that grouped within this clade are not identified and appear as 

Mesophyllum spp. (KC819249, KC819252 and KC819269, Pardo et al., 2014), 

Lithothamnion sp. (KJ710353 – in the publication as Lithothamnion cf. ruptile, Peña et 

al., 2014) or Hapalidiaceae (GQ917460, Bittner et al. 2011). Pardo et al. 2014 

documented that these Mesophyllum species possessed anatomical characters congruent 

with Lithothamnion, though the authors concluded the specimens belonged to 

Mesophyllum because they grouped with Mesophyllum sphaericum. Peña et al. (2014) 

showed in the results of their psbA analysis that the species of Lithothamnion 

mentioned above comprised a clade separate from other Lithothamnion species. We 

obtained anatomical images only for Hapalidiaceae sp. 7 (Fig. 38) and Hapalidiaceae sp. 

10 (Figs 39-40), but unfortunately no obvious distinguishing characters were observed. 

Therefore, further DNA analyses and thorough anatomical investigations of additional 

specimens need to be done to characterize these species. DNA sequencing of the 

generitype specimen of Lithothamnion muellerii needs to be performed before we can 

confirm if this is in fact a new genus. More discussion on this clade is shown in Chapter 

3. 

Hapalidiaceae sp. 11 grouped with a sequence from Genbank of Lithothamnion 

sp. collected in Fiji, but considering this clade did not group with the other 

Lithothamnion spp., we kept this specimen as Hapalidiaceae sp. 11 instead of treating it 

as Lithothamnion.

Distribution of CCA along the Brazilian coast 

The distribution of coralline algae found in our study, despite the low number of 

specimens found for some species, is consistent with a general pattern observed in many 

taxonomic groups where a majority of species have small geographic ranges, whereas a 

few species have larger ranges (Gaston, 1996). This distribution pattern is also similar 

to what was found for rhodolith forming species in Europe (Pardo et al. 2014) and the 

Caribbean (Peña et al. 2014).  

The Corallinales and Hapalidiales species diversity found in this study is 

represented in maps where we show the species’ distributions along the Brazilian coast 

(Fig. 42 – Corallinales; Fig. 43 - Hapalidiales). In this study we could not address 

diversity or species richness in the ecological definition of these terms; by diversity we 

are referring to the number of species collected during a limited single expeditions to 

each sample site, and this should be taken in consideration when we discuss diversity 

herein.  

Considering our sampling effort and results obtained in this study, we conclude 

that members of the Corallinales are distributed from Rio Grande do Norte state 

(RN,5ºS) to Santa Catarina state (SC, 27ºS) and also in the vicinity of Fernando de 

Noronha Island (3ºS) (Fig. 42). Therefore, according to Spalding et al. (2007), we 

collected in the Tropical Atlantic with a southern limit in the Temperate South 

American realm. When we compiled the information available in the literature for the 

occurrence of Corallinales along the Brazilian coast (Table 2, Introduction section), a 

similar distribution was observed for this order; therefore we corroborate with 

molecular data that in fact the order is widespread in Brazil. We did not obtain any 

sample from Rio Grande do Sul state in this study, which is the southern limit of the 

158 



Brazilian coast (approximately 30ºS). However, a species of Lithophyllum, L. 

atlanticum, which is a member of the Corallinales, has been reported for this state based 

on morphological and molecular data (Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014). Regarding the northern 

limit, a recently published study reported a species of CCA belonging to the 

Corallinales (Hydrolithon ruprestre) from the region of the Amazon River mouth 

(between French Guiana border and Maranhão state in Brazil) (Moura et al. 2016). 

Although we obtained a few samples from a nearby area in the region, we were unable 

to successfully amplify some of the specimens and the other samples sequenced did not 

belong to Corallinales. 

The genus Lithophyllum seems to be the most widespread based on our dataset, 

with Lithophyllum sp. 2 and Lithophyllum sp. 4 being the most common ones within the 

genus. Corallinaceae sp. 8 seems to be restricted to Oceanic Islands (Fernando de 

Noronha and Trindade Islands).  

The Hapalidiales samples collected and investigated in this work are distributed 

from Maranhão state (MA, 1ºS) to Santa Catarina state (SC, 27ºS) (Fig. 43). Therefore, 

according to Spalding et al. (2007), they range from their northern limit in the Tropical 

Atlantic to the southern limit in the Temperate South American realm. Likewise, similar  

to what was observed for the Corallinales in the literature, the Hapalidiales has a wide 

distribution along the Brazilian coastline; thus we corroborate with molecular data that 

in fact the order is widespread in Brazil, including Maranhão state, which is near the 

region of the Amazon river mouth. Hapalidiaceae sp. 8 and Mesophyllum erubescens 

seem to be the most widespread species occurring from the Northeastern to the Southern 

Brazilian coastline (from 5ºS to 27ºS), corroborating the previously published data 

shown by Sissini et al. (2014), followed by Hapalidiaceae sp. 4, occurring from the 

Northern to the Southeastern coastline (nearly 0º to 12ºS). 

159 



Overall, the greatest number of Corallinales species we found in this study was 

in Bahia state (BA – 7 species) followed by Espírito Santo state (ES – 5 species). 

However, for Hapalidiales, the most species were observed in Espírito Santo state (ES – 

10 species) followed by Bahia state (BA – 6 species). This higher number of species, in 

comparison to the other Brazilian states, was not unexpected considering a similar 

pattern was shown before by Horta et al. (2001) who proposed that Espírito Santo state 

is the transition zone between the two macroalgal phytogeographic zones in Brazil (the 

tropical and the warm temperate subtropical). This transition zone encompasses Espírito 

Santo and the south of Bahia state and includes a variety of different habitats (e.g. coral 

reefs, rocky shores, rhodolith beds) (Oliveira Filho 1969, Oliveira Filho 1977; Horta et 

al. 2001) that are unique to this part of the Brazilian coast, (Nunes, personal 

communication) and this may be the explanation for the higher level of diversity found 

in this particular area.  

Comparing the number of species found for Corallinales and Hapalidiales with 

the list of previously reported species (see Tab. 2 in the introduction section), a total of 

32 species (after excluding exclusively epiphytic species, which is beyond of the scope 

of this study) of these two orders were reported for Brazil. Of these species, only nine 

were reported based on molecular studies (Vieira-Pinto 2011; Sissini 2013, Sissini et al. 

2014; Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014; Torrano-Silva 2015; Henriques 2016), and of those nine 

species only three of the sequences were deposited in public databanks (Sissini et al. 

2014; Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014). In this study, we found at least 37 putative different 

species (see Tab. 7 in this section). For the Corallinales, prior to this study, 21 species 

were reported, only six of these reports were corroborated with molecular data. In this 

study, we generated molecular data for 19 different species in this order. For the 

Hapalidiales, 11 species were previously reported, only four of which were based on 

160 



molecular data. In this study, we found 16 putative different molecular species for this 

order.  

The results found in this study corroborate our hypothesis that the diversity for 

CCA is underestimated. However, it is not clear if the species names reported in 

previous studies are applicable to specimens investigated in this study. Therefore, future 

investigations need to be performed to link the molecular data to taxonomic names. This 

study forms an important foundation for future work and is a significant contribution for 

enriching the sequence databanks for this group of algae, especially for the South 

Atlantic, from where few sequences are available. Further research will be needed, 

particularly obtaining sequences from types or topotypes, in order to fully understand 

the species and generic diversity of CCA occurring along the Western South Atlantic.  

Also, some of our specimens appear to be closely related to species from the 

Indo Pacific (i.e. Corallinaceae sp. 7, Mesophyllum erubescens, Hapalidiaceae sp. 11). 

Considering it has been previously hypothesized that a portion of the Brazilian marine 

macroflora has an Indo-Pacific origin (Horta et al. 2001), applying different markers in 

future studies could help to clarify its origin and the biogeographical pathways that led 

to the present distribution of CCA in Brazil.

Final remarks 

? Considering the informativeness and cost-benefit based on our data, the most 

suitable markers to use in comprehensive and broad studies of CCA are psbA 

and COI-5P, followed by rbcL-3P.  

? Very few of the sequences generated in this study matched publicly available 

sequences, suggesting that some species studied are potentially new to science, 

or belong to described species for which no sequence data are yet available. 

Therefore this study provides a significant contribution for enriching the 

sequence databanks for these algae, particularly for the South Atlantic, from 

where few sequences are available.  

? Our results demonstrated that the diversity might be underestimated, especially 

within the Hapalidiales. Before this study there were 32 CCA species between 

Corallinales and Hapalidiales referred to the Brazilian coast, with only nine 

based on molecular data. After this study we have generated molecular data for 

at least 35 different species of Corallinales and Hapalidiales. Before this study, 

there were 21 species of Corallinales referred to Brazil, with only six for which 

molecular data were generated; in this study we generated molecular data for 19 

different species of this order. For the Hapalidiales 11 species were previously 

reported for the Brazilian coast, with molecular data generated for only four 

species; in this study we generated molecular data for 16 different species of this 

order. 

? Applying specific epithets and even genus names was not practical for our entire 

dataset, mainly because for most species found in this study, we only collected 

one or a few individuals of which many of them were not fertile (it was 

especially difficult to find gametophytes). Therefore future investigations will be 

165 



needed to link the sequences generated in this study to the applicable names 

and/or to propose new species and genera. 

? Applying molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding, to studies of the diversity of 

CCA is fundamental and opens a new perspective in this particular group which 

has been historically difficult to study considering the challenging techniques 

and time-consuming preparations necessary to properly study their anatomy.  

? Some of our specimens seem to be closely related to species from the Indo-

Pacific. Applying different markers could help to understand this relationship 

between the flora of the Atlantic and Indo Pacific and clarify the 

biogeographical pathways that led to their present distribution.  

? Considering all the three orders of CCA, this study represents the first broad 

attempt and effort to unveil the diversity of CCA species found on the Brazilian 

coast using molecular data.

Abstract 

Sporolithon (Sporolithales, Rhodophyta) is a commonly found crustose coralline algal 

(CCA) genus. It is one of the main genera found in tropical waters forming either 

rhodoliths or crusts. The genus presents as distinguishing characteristic the development 

of spores in delicate calcified compartments. Despite efforts in the past decade to 

investigate and document the diversity of CCA as a whole along the Western Atlantic 

coast, especially in Brazil, few studies have combined molecular-based analyses with 

morphological/anatomical approaches; hence the diversity of the group is probably 

underestimated. In the present study, we combined DNA sequences (COI-5P and psbA) 

and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) anatomical characterization to identify 

Sporolithon species that occur in the shallow waters along the Brazilian coast across a 

range extension of approximately 2,000 km (from Ceará to Espírito Santo states). Based 

on the results of GMYC and ML analyses for COI-5P sequences we were able to 

distinguish two different species, both new to science that are described herein as 

Sporolithon pseudoepisporum sp. nov. and Sporolithon tomitae sp. nov., and help 

clarify the species boundaries in this genus. These results reinforce the need of using 

molecular approaches in CCA studies to reveal the true level of diversity, especially to 

closely related and cryptic species.

Introduction  

The taxonomy of the crustose coralline algae (CCA) has historically been very 

challenging and several classifications have been proposed based solely on comparative 

morphological and anatomical features (Cabioch 1972, 1988, Johansen 1976, Silva &amp;amp; 

Johansen 1986, Woelkerling 1988, Harvey &amp;amp; Woelkerling 1995). Bailey and Chapman 

(1996, 1998) published the first molecular phylogenies of the Corallinales and 

confirmed the evolutionary scenario hypothesized by Cabioch (1988) that the geniculate 

taxa had evolved independently in distinct lineages in the order. Since then, molecular 

approaches have greatly improved the resolution of red algal phylogenies as a whole 

(e.g. Freshwater et al. 1999, Le Gall &amp;amp; Saunders 2007, Broom et al. 2008, Le Gall et al. 

2010, Bittner et al. 2011, Kato et al. 2011) and as a consequence, some phylogenetic 

relationships between the CCA are being clarified. Presently, the CCA are divided into 

three orders, the Corallinales, the Hapalidiales and the Sporolithales (Nelson et al. 

2015). The Sporolithales comprise a single family, the Sporolithaceae, with two genera, 

Sporolithon and Heydrichia (Verheij 1993, Townsend et al. 1994) both presenting 

cruciately divided tetrasporangia occurring individually in calcified compartments 

rather than  in conceptacles (Verheij 1993). The family was previously included in the 

Corallinales (Verheij 1993) but was elevated to ordinal rank as the Sporolithales by Le 

Gall et al. (2010) because of its unique tetrasporangial development with a strong 

molecular argument based on molecular phylogenies that showed it is more closely 

related to the Rhodogorgonales than to the Corallinales (Harvey et al. 2002, Le Gall et 

al. 2010). 

The genus Sporolithon is characterized by possessing thick-walled epithallial cells 

that are flared at their upper margins; cells of contiguous vegetative filaments joined by 

both secondary pit connections and cell fusions; tetrasporangia produced within 

188 



calcified sporangial compartments; tetrasporocytes that undergo cruciate cleavage; 

tetrasporangial compartments that bear apical pore plugs; and the absence of an 

involucre surrounding the calcified sporangial compartments (Verheij 1993; Townsend 

et al. 1995; Harvey et al. 2002; Le Gall et al. 2010).  

Although the genus Sporolithon is generally considered a deep water (&gt;20 m) 

genus of CCA (Verheij 1993, Lund et al. 2000, Braga &amp;amp; Bassi 2007, Bahia et al. 2011, 

Bahia et al. 2014a,b), it is commonly found growing epilithically or forming rhodoliths 

in shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters (Verheij 1993, Basso et al. 2009, 

Kaewsuralikhit et al. 2012) and in Brazil it seems to be one of the major constituents in 

coral reefs along the coastline (as shown in the present study). In Brazil, the genus is 

represented by the following species: S. africanum (Foslie) J. Afonso-Carillo, S. 

australasicum (Foslie) N. Yamaguishi-Tomita ex M.J. Wynne, S. durum (Foslie) 

Townsend &amp;amp; Woelkerling, S. erythraeum (Rothpletz) Kylin, S. howei (Lemoine) N. 

Yamaguishi-Tomita ex M.J. Wynne, S. pacificum E.Y. Dawson, S. ptychoides Heydrich 

(Bahia et al. 2011; Wynne 2011; Guiry &amp;amp; Guiry 2013, Bahia et al. 2014a, Henriques et 

al. 2014), S. episporum (M.A.Howe) E.Y. Dawson (Costa et al. 2014), S. tenue R.G. 

Bahia, G.M. Amado-Filho, G.W. Maneveldt &amp;amp; W.H. Adey (Bahia et al. 2014a), S. 

elevatum M.C. Henriques &amp;amp; R. Riosmena-Rodriguez (Henriques et al. 2014), S. 

episoredion (W.H.Adey, R.A.Townsend &amp;amp; Boykins) Verheij (as S. episoredium in 

Henriques et al. 2014)  and S. yoneshigueae R.G. Bahia, G.M. Amado-Filho, G.W. 

Maneveldt &amp;amp; W.H. Adey (Bahia et al. 2015). The latter six species have been 

consistently identified based on the modern understanding of the genus and Sporolithon 

durum was reported as a new occurrence for the Atlantic Ocean (Wynne 2011); 

however, a detailed description of this record was not provided and is still needed as 

pointed out by Bahia et al. (2014a). The remaining five Sporolithon species were 

189 



reported in the doctoral dissertation of Dr. Tomita (1976), but have never been 

published. Most species were cited for depths greater than 20 meters up to 133 meters 

(Bahia et al. 2011, 2013, 2014a, Henriques et al. 2014), and only Sporolithon 

episporum was cited to shallow waters (Costa et al. 2014). From all the citations and 

descriptions for Brazilian waters, only three species were described based on molecular 

data, i.e. Sporolithon ptychoides and S. tenue (Bahia et al 2013), and S. yoneshigueae 

(Bahia et al. 2015) 

Even though the knowledge of the diversity of CCA as a whole in Brazil has 

improved recently, few studies have combined molecular analyses with 

morphological/anatomical approaches (Bahia et al., 2013, 2015; Sissini et al., 2014, 

Vieira-Pinto et al., 2014, Bahia et al., 2015); hence the diversity of the group is 

probably grossly underestimated.  

Considering the importance of revealing the diversity of CCA, our aim in this 

study was to investigate the genus Sporolithon along the Brazilian coast based on 

morphological/anatomical and molecular data. Whereas our morphological data shows a 

low diversity for this genus in the Brazilian shallow waters, and only minor anatomical 

features appear to differ from the currently known species, our molecular data revealed 

two new species proposed in this study as Sporolithon psudoepisporum T. Vieira-Pinto, 

P.A. Horta &amp;amp; M.C. Oliveira  and S. tomitae T. Vieira-Pinto, P.A. Horta &amp;amp; M.C. 

Oliveira. 

 

Material and methods 

Specimens were collected in 24 locations along the Brazilian coast. The majority of 

specimens were collected in the intertidal as rhodoliths (as loose nodules on the bottom) 

but when attached to the substrata, a hammer and chisel was used to remove samples. 

190 



For the molecular analyses, material was dried in the shade and stored in silica gel. 

Whenever possible, the samples were fractured in half and fixed partly in 4% 

formaldehyde-seawater solution to aid in preservation of the soft structures for 

morphological analysis and partly in silica gel. All specimens’ data including vouchers, 

sampling localities, collectors, dates and sequenced markers are summarized in Table 1.  

 

Molecular studies 

DNA Extraction and PCR protocols:  

Total DNA was extracted from silica gel-dried samples using the Chelex resin protocol 

(adapted from Goff &amp;amp; Moon 1993). The mitochondrial COI-5P fragment was PCR-

amplified using primer pairs GazF1/GazR1 or GWSFn/GWSRi (Saunders, 2005; 

Saunders &amp;amp; McDevit, 2012). The psbA locus was amplified using primer pairs psbA-

F1/ psbA-R2 or psbA-F1/psbA600R (Yoon et al., 2002) or psbA550R (Sissini et al. 

2014) whenever there were ambiguous bases from resulting psbA600R sequences. 

Thermal cycle profiles for PCR amplification of COI-5P and psbA fragments followed 

those in Saunders &amp;amp; McDevit (2012) and Bittner (2010), respectively. Resulting PCR 

products were cleaned with the column PCR™GTX DNA and Gel Band Purification 

Kit (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, USA), according to manufacturer’s protocol of the and 

sequenced in-house at the University of São Paulo on an ABI 3130xl or 3730 and/or at 

UL Lafayette campus on an ABI Model 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. 

 

Assembling, Alignments and Analyzes:  

Forward and reverse sequences were assembled either in Sequencher 5.0 software 

(Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) or BioEdit 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999). For each 

191 



marker, a multiple alignment excluding PCR primers was generated with Clustal W 

(Thompson et al. 1994) available in BioEdit 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999).  

The psbA matrix was constructed with 60 sequences, 33 newly generated in this 

study and 27 downloaded from GenBank, including Renouxia sp. (GQ917503) and 

Rhodogorgon sp. (GQ917504) that were used as outgroups. The matrix was cropped at 

the 5’ and 3’ ends to minimize missing data in sequences from GenBank and the final 

alignment was 832 base pairs (bp) in length. The COI-5P matrix was constructed with 

77 sequences, 65 newly generated in this study and 12 publicly available from 

GenBank, including one sequence of Rhodogorgon sp. and one of Renouxia sp. each 

used as outgroups. This alignment, which was cropped at the 5’ and 3’ ends, was 577 bp 

in length and included no missing data in any of the sequences. It included a COI-5P 

sequence from a specimen of Sporolithon episporum (M.Howe) E.Y.Dawson which was 

collected at the type locality (Bocas del Toro, Panama). Comparative analyses of the 

rbcL sequence generated from this specimen revealed it is identical to an rbcL sequence 

(data not shown) generated from the type material of Sporolithon episporum (M.Howe) 

E.Y.Dawson (personal communication with P.W. Gabrielson, manuscript in prep.) 

(Table 1). Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Maximum likelihood (ML) 

conducted in MEGA6 (Tamura et al. 2013) as well as Neighbor-Joining cluster 

analysis; Bayesian inference (BI) was generated in MrBayes (Huelsenbeck &amp;amp; Roanquist 

2001) using TOPALI v.2.5 software (Milne et al. 2008). Models of sequence evolution 

were estimated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) obtained in MEGA 5.2.2. 

Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses for the COI-5P and psbA alignments were 

performed under a generalized time-reversible with gamma+invariant sites 

heterogeneity model (GTR + G + I). The Bayesian analyses were performed under the 

same model with four Markov Chain Monte Carlo for 10 million generations, and tree 

192 



sampling every 1000 generations. Bayesian analysis was performed using Mr. Bayes 

3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012).  Two parallel analyses were conducted, each consisting of 

four MCMC chains (3 heated and 1 cool) with 1 x 10
7
 generations.  Resampling was 

performed every 1,000 generations. The first 10% of each run was discarded as “burn-

in”, and a consensus tree was built with remaining data.  

The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model was applied for the 

delimitation of species (Pons et al. 2006, Fujisawa &amp;amp; Barraclough 2013). Species 

boundaries are defined based on the ultrametric tree obtained from a Bayesian 

phylogenetic under the same model we used for the phylogenies. 

 

Morphological studies  

SEM images were obtained from portions of the thallus of dried specimens previously 

preserved in Si-gel and/or 4% formalin/seawater. Cross sections and longitudinal 

sections were made using a razor blade, and the resulting sections were mounted using 

liquid graphite and coated with 10-14 nm of gold. Specimens were viewed using a 

Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron microscope (SEM) at a voltage of 15 kV, housed in 

the Microscopy Center at UL Lafayette, following the manufacturer’s instructions. 

Identified samples, including permanent slides, were deposited on the Herbarium of 

University of São Paulo (SPF). Herbarium abbreviation follows Thiers (2016, 

continuously updated). 

 

Results 

The psbA consensus tree was generated by ML analyses (Fig. 1). The clade of 

Sporolithales comprised collections of Sporolithon and Heydrichia from Brazil, Costa 

Rica, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Using the 

193 



outgroups Renouxia sp. and Rhodogorgon sp., the Sporolithales formed a monophyletic 

group with full support (BI, ML and NJ). Members of Sporolithon also formed a 

monophyletic clade but with no support in all analyzes, while members of Heydrichia 

were basal and paraphyletic in relation to Sporolithon. Sporolithon durum from New 

Zealand formed two distinct clades that were not closely related. In one of these clades a 

specimen from Australia (DQ168023) presented a divergence of 29 bp for the psbA 

from the other specimens from New Zealand. These results show the occurrence of 

cryptic species under the name S. durum was also separated in a different clade. S. 

ptychoides from Brazil and New Caledonia also are divided in two different clades and 

presenting a difference of 36 bp, also indicating the occurrence of cryptic species. The 

clade corresponding to S. yoneshigueae from Brazil was comprised of 4 specimens with 

full support in all analyzes; S. tenue, also from Brazil, formed a clade with strong 

support (.84/100/100 for BI, ML and NJ, respectively). Representatives of Sporolithon 

from Brazilian shallow waters formed a monophyletic clade (.94/92/99 for BI, ML and 

NJ, respectively). All analyzes resolved Sporolithon episporum from Costa Rica as a 

sister taxon to Brazilian shallow waters Sporolithon with full support (1/99/100 for BI, 

ML and NJ, respectively) and genetic diversity among them are shown in Table 2.  

The phylogenetic tree obtained from the ML analysis of the COI-5P alignment 

(Fig. 2) resolved Sporolithon in a clade with strong support (1/99/97 for BI, ML and NJ, 

respectively). Species were distinguished into 7 lineages; S. ptychoides from Hawaii 

was resolved separated from S. ptychoides from New Caledonia; an unidentified species 

from Fiji grouped in a clade with species from Panama and Brazil with strong support 

(.89/95/96 for BI, ML and NJ, respectively); and finally, Brazilian shallow water 

Sporolithon was resolved into a strongly supported clade with S. episporum from 

Panama (.82/94/95 for BI, ML and NJ, respectively). The Brazilian shallow water 

194 



Sporolithon was resolved as a monophyletic clade with moderate to strong support 

(.90/84/85 for BI, ML and NJ, respectively), that was further split into two lineages with 

moderate to high support. The GMYC model fit was significantly better than a null 

model driven by coalescence only and reported 2 ML entities (represented by thicker 

branches in Fig. 2). All analyzes of COI-5P dataset were congruent in delimiting the 

Brazilian specimens as an independent lineage separated from crustose specimen of S. 

episporum from Panama, with a genetic divergence ranging from 3.2-3.9% (Table 2); 

although as shown in psbA results, the three species are very closely related. Based on 

our collections, the diversity of Sporolithon taxa in the Brazilian shallow waters is low 

(2 species), but shows us two previously unknown species.  

 

Given the molecular evidence shown above, we propose to describe two new species of 

CCA from the Brazilian coast shallow waters as follows.

Etymology: “pseudoepisporum” was named as a reference to the resemblance and close 

relation to the species S. episporum. 

Diagnosis: The new species proposed segregates from others based on its COI-5P DNA 

sequences. 

195 



Distribution: This species is widespread along the Brazilian coastline from Ceará 

(Tropical Atlantic realm) to Espírito Santo state (Temperate South American realm), 

more than 2,000 km of range extension. 

 

Description  

Vegetative features: Calcified nongeniculate thalli, exhibiting growth forms such as 

rhodoliths found loose on the sandy bottom, or crusts fully attached to the substrata 

(Fig. 3). Surfaces are warty to lumpy, protuberances 5-20 mm in diameter and 3-10 mm 

high (Fig. 3 and 4). Thallus pseudoparenchymatous with monomerous organization in 

older portions (Fig. 5 and 6). Epithallium is composed of a single layer of cells that are 

2.5-3.5 ?m high and 3.5-6 ?m in diameter with flared walls (Figs. 7 and 8). 

Subepithallial cells are 6.5-10 µm high and 3.5-8 µm in diameter. Perithallial cells 8-20 

?m high and 3.5-8 ?m in diameter. Cells of contiguous (adjacent) filaments are joined 

predominantly by secondary pit connections (Fig. 7).  

Reproductive features: Tetrasporangial sori (Figs. 9-12) are raised and present 4-5 cell 

layers above the surrounding vegetative thallus (Fig. 11). Individual tetrasporangial 

calcified chambers are uniporate (Figs. 9-12), occur mostly in clusters (Figs. 9-11). 

Tetrasporangial chambers are 80-110 ?m in height and 35-45 ?m in diameter, and are 

separated from one another by none to 2 paraphyses composed of 5-6 elongate cells 

(Fig 12). Tetrasporangial pores measure 10-15 ?m in diameter and are surrounded by 

10-14 rosette cells (Fig. 12) that are often slightly sunken towards the pore opening 

(Fig. 12 – arrow). Within sori, each chamber bears only one tetrasporangium that is 

cruciately divided or undivided when not mature (Fig. 12 - te) and measures 50–75 ?m 

in heigh and 30–40 ?m in diameter. Senescent tetrasporangial sori are sloughed off from 

the outer thallus and no scars are visible. Gametangial conceptacles are uniporate and 

196 



raised in relation to the thallus surface (Fig. 13-16), carpospores are arranged in the 

chamber floor (Fig. 15 - c); conceptacles are 120-130 ?m in diameter and 150-185 in 

heigh. Pore channel is 30 ?m in diameter and 50 ?m (or 6 cells) in heigh (Fig. 16). 

Ecological observations: Species were found as rhodoliths at 2-12 m depth and as 

epilithic crusts in the intertidal growing on rocky shores and coral reefs.

studies of the genus Sporolithon and the CCA in Brazil and South America. 

Diagnosis: The new species proposed segregates from others based on its COI-5P DNA 

sequences. 

Distribution: This species was found at a restricted area from CE to RN states in the 

Brazilian coastline (Tropical Atlantic realm). 

 

Description  

Vegetative features: Calcified nongeniculate thalli, growth forms mostly as rhodoliths 

found loose on the sandy bottom, and rarely as crusts fully attached to the substrata 

(Fig. 17). Surface smooth to lumpy, protuberances 0,5-1 cm in diameter and 0.3-0.5 cm 

high (Fig. 17). Thallus pseudoparenchymatous with monomerous organization in older 

and younger portions (growth margins) (Figs. 18-20). Perithallial cells 5-18 ?m high 

197 



and 3.5-7.5?m in diameter (Fig. 21- p). Cells of contiguous (adjacent) filaments are 

joined by mainly secondary pit connections (Fig. 21- arrows) in a ratio of 2:1. 

Epithallium is composed of a single layer of cells that are 3.5-4 ?m high and 3.5-4 ?m 

in diameter with flared walls (Fig. 22 - e). Subepithallial initial cells are 5.5-8 µm high 

and 3.5-6 µm in diameter (Fig. 22 - i).  

Reproductive features: Tetrasporangial sori (Fig. 23) are flush to slightly raised in 

relation to the thallus surface and present 5–7 cell layers above the surrounding 

vegetative thallus (Fig. 26). Individual tetrasporangial calcified chambers are uniporate 

and occur mostly in clusters (Figs. 23-26), they present a single differentiated stalk cells 

(data not shown). Tetrasporangial chambers are 80-110 ?m in height and 35-45 ?m in 

diameter (Fig. 27 - t), and are separated from one another by none to 2 paraphyses 

comprised of 5-6 elongate cells (Fig. 27 - arrows) Tetrasporangial pores measure 10-15 

?m in diameter and are surrounded by 10-14 rosette cells (Fig. 28) that are often slightly 

sunken towards the pore opening, which is raised as a halo (Fig. 28 - arrow). Senescent 

tetrasporangial sori are sloughed off from the outer thallus and no scars were observed. 

Ecological observations: Species were found as rhodoliths and as epilithic crusts in the 

intertidal growing on rocky shores and coral reefs. 

 

Discussion 

Presently, there are eight extant species of Sporolithon for which detailed taxonomic 

information exists (Bahia et al. 2015); among them seven species have been recorded 

for the southwestern Atlantic, Brazil. It can be very difficult to distinguish species 

within the genus Sporolithon as most characters used to delimit species in this genus 

can show a high degree of plasticity (Verheij, 1993, this study) and often overlap (see 

Table 3 for details). Despite these limitations, Sporolithon pseudoepisporum and S. 

198 



tomitae can be distinguished from S. yoneshigueae, S. molle, S. episoredion and S. 

ptychoides by not presenting old buried tetrasporangial compartments, but that instead 

these compartments are flaked off, although S. pseudoepisporum presents buried empty 

old gamentangial conceptacles. Both species can also be distinguished from S. 

episporum by not presenting scars of old tetrasporangial compartments throughout the 

deeper parts of the thalli like it has been extensively reported for S. episporum (Verheij, 

1993, Keats &amp;amp; Chamberlain, 1993; Bahia et al. 2015b); they can also be differentiated 

from S. elevatum by presenting a monomerous thallus organization whereas the latter 

presents a dimerous organization.  

Although Sporolithon pseudoepisporum and S. tomitae cannot be easily 

morphologically distinguished from all other species of this genus, as shown above, we 

relied on DNA barcoding technique to corroborate our findings. It is now widely 

recognized that COI-5P and psbA are useful and informative markers to resolve species 

boundaries (Yang &amp;amp; Boo, 2004; Broom et al., 2008; Le Gall et al., 2010; Bittner et al., 

2011; Kato et al., 2011; 2013; Bahia et al., 2014a; Pardo et al., 2014; Peña et al., 2014, 

2015; Richards et al., 2014, Sissini et al., 2014; Vieira-Pinto et al., 2014); the former is 

considered the DNA barcode for Rhodophyta (Saunders, 2005). Using these markers, 

we have shown that S. pseudoepisporum and S. tomitae represent distinct taxonomic 

entities separate from all other Sporolithon species currently recognized for which DNA 

sequences are available, such as S. tenue and S. yoneshigueae, species recently 

recognized for the Brazilian coast; and S. durum from Australia. Regarding genetic 

divergences, the newly proposed species, which are very closely related to S. 

episporum, show interspecific divergences of 0.6% and 0.8% for psbA from S. 

episporum, which is higher than the minimum value of interspecific divergence between 

other coralline species reported in previous studies (Broom et al. 2008, Hindi &amp;amp; 

199 



Saunders 2013); between the Brazilian species the divergence is 0.1%, a very low 

divergence that could be interpreted as a single species. Divergence values of COI-5P 

for S. pseudoepisporum and S. tomitae compared to S. episporum is 3.2% and 3.9% 

respectively (or 19 and 23 bp), and therefore congruent with interspecific divergence 

values reported in previous studies using this marker (Saunders, 2005, Robba et al. 

2006, Hind &amp;amp; Saunders 2013, Hind et al. 2014, Peña et al. 2015), and between the two 

Brazilian species divergence is 3%. Phymatholithon lamii and P. lusitanicum (Peña et 

al., 2015) showed exactly the same divergence range, which can be considered as a gray 

zone to delimit species boundaries for this marker. Phymatholithon lamii and P. 

lusitanicum (Peña et al., 2015), were segregated based on the same genetic divergence 

for COI-5P that we found in this study along with ecological observations regarding 

these species habit, such as P. lamii was only found as crusts species and P. lusitanicum 

as rhodolith-forming species. Although both Brazilian species were found as crusts and 

rhodoliths and therefore no distinction in growth form was observed, we did find a 

separate distributional pattern, in that S. tomitae has a more restricted distribution in the 

Tropical Atlantic realm and S. pseudoepisporum is widely distributed along the 

Brazilian coast from the Tropical Atlantic with a southern limit in the Temperate South 

American realm (following the Marine Ecoregions of the World - Spalding et al. 2007) 

(Fig. 29).  

 

Conclusions 

Our COI-5P analyses revealed that specimens of Sporolithon from Brazilian shallow 

waters represent two new CCA species. These specimens were resolved as taxa sister to 

S. episporum with full support, indicating that the three species share a very recent 

common ancestor. DNA barcodes proved to be essential for delimiting species within 

200 



this challenging group of nongeniculate corallines where phenotypic plasticity and 

overlapping character measurements complicate the use of conventional, morphology-

based approaches. As pointed out by Bahia et al. (2015a), recognizing, describing and 

documenting the CCA species is the first step to understanding the complexity of 

tropical habitats dominated by coralline algae. More importantly, our understanding of 

the diversity of nongeniculate coralline algae in Brazil has been improving in the past 

few years by studies that focus on combining different approaches and has great 

potential to help and provide scientific-based information to national legislation in order 

to ensure appropriate protection for marine habitats.

Abstract 

In the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico (NWGMx), subtidal rhodolith beds offshore Louisiana 

at 45-80 m depth harbor a diverse community of non-geniculate coralline algae including 

both biogenic and autogenic rhodoliths and other encrusting taxa. The coralline algal flora of 

this region has yet to be fully characterized, and identifying specimens to their correct genus 

and species is an ongoing process because many available names remain to be validated by 

comparison to historical type specimens. Here, comparative DNA sequencing (psbA, UPA, 

and COI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to assess the molecular and 

morphological diversity of the rhodolith-forming specimens belonging to the generic concept 

of Lithothamnion (Melobesioideae, Hapalidiaceae, Hapalidiales) in the NWGMx. 

Phylogenetic and barcoding analyses of the newly generated sequences from recently 

dredged specimens at Ewing and Sackett Banks offshore Louisiana revealed the presence of 

at least six species of Lithothamnion, whose SEM imaging confirmed the presence of 

characters described for the genus. More broadly, our analyses indicate the presence of at 

least eight species found in the Gulf of Mexico and at least ten species in the Western 

Atlantic Ocean for this form genus. Further comparisons with specimens from the coast of 

Brazil indicate the occurrence of a widespread Lithothamnion sp. I in the Western Tropical 

Atlantic.

Introduction 

The Northwestern Gulf of Mexico (NWGMx) offshore Louisiana, harbors subtidal rhodolith 

beds at depths of 45–80m comprising a diverse assemblage of non-geniculate coralline algae 

spanning multiple lineages (Richards et al. 2014, Fredericq et al. 2014, Krayesky-Self et al. 

2016). These rhodolith communities consist of free-living marine nodules primarily accreted 

by coralline algae precipitating calcium carbonate, or biogenic rhodoliths, and secondarily 

colonized nodules of geobiological origin, or autogenic rhodoliths (Foster 2001, Fredericq et 

al. 2014). The latter begin as calcium carbonate nodules formed by differential erosion of cap 

rock that originated from anaerobic bacteria acting on the minerals within the underlying salt 

domes, which subsequently become overgrown by a suite of encrusting macroalgae (e.g., 

members of Corallinales, Peyssonneliales, or Dictyotales) (Gore 1992, Fredericq et al. 2014). 

These rhodolith beds harbor a diverse assemblage of Bivalvia (Turgeon et al. 2009), whose 

shells provides substrata for encrusting coralline algae (Richards et al. 2014, present study). 

 Lithothamnion Heydrich (1897) is conserved against Lithothamnium Philippi (1837). 

Philippi (1837) based his genus Lithothamnium on five specimens of “rigid calcareous 

plants” from the Sicilian coast, Mediterranean Sea (Woelkerling 1983, p. 165). Four of these 

were newly described species (L. crassum Philippi, L. gracilis Philippi, L. ramulosum 

Philippi, and L. rubrum Philippi). The fifth species was L. byssoides (Lamarck) Philippi 

(Woelkerling 1983). Philippi merged the taxa Nullipora byssoides Lamarck and Millepora 

polymorphya var. globosa Esper (previously considered to be animals by Lamarck and 

Esper) into Lithothamnium. Philippi also synonymized both taxa, assigned the specific 

epithet byssoides based on priority, and assigned this specific epithet to one of the five 

specimens in his Sicilian collection (Woelkerling 1983, p. 165). Philippi’s original 

227 



 

description was later augmented by subsequent authors (Heydrich 1897b, Mason 1953, Adey 

1966) who began considering three characters as diagnostic for Lithothamnium: 1) 

multiporate tetrasporangial conceptacles, 2) a multilayered noncoaxial hypothallus (= 

hypothallium sensu Woelkerling) and 3) a single layer of “angular” epithallial cells 

(reviewed in Woelkerling 1983) which are sometimes referred to as having “flattened and 

flared outermost cell walls” (Woelkering, 1988 p. 171) or being armored (Adey et al. 2015). 

This concept of Lithothamnium, however, was not based on any material from Philippi’s 

original collection, which was found by Woelkerling in 1980 in Kützing’s herbarium 

(Woelkerling 1983). Woelkerling showed that none of the specimens in Philippi’s original 

collection possessed multiporate tetrasporangial conceptacles, and thus that all of Philippi’s 

species belonged to other generic concepts. However, because the modern concept of 

Lithothamnium had been adopted by many authors (albeit with some disagreement between 

authors in regards to how the genus is circumscribed) and many described species names had 

already relied on it, Woelkerling (1983, pp. 193-194) proposed to conserve Lithothamnion 

Heydrich 1897b, noting he was the first to establish the presence of multiporate 

tetrasporangial conceptacles as a defining character. Thus, Woelkerling established a 

lectotype specimen for the genus, Lithothamnion muelleri Lenormand ex Rosanoff (1866), 

which has a type locality near Victoria, Australia (Woelkerling 1983). 

 Few studies on Lithothamnion Heydrich have been conducted in the Gulf of Mexico 

(Dawes 1974, Minnery 1990, Mateo-Cid et al. 2014) and until recently relied solely on 

thallus morpho-anatomy rather than being integrated with additional characters such as 

molecular data (i.e. DNA sequences). Excluding taxa since transferred to other genera, 

Dawes (1974) reported a single species of Lithothamnion, L. sejunctum Foslie, from offshore 

228 



 

the west coast of Florida. Lithothamnion was reported in a preliminary investigation into the 

diversity and zonation of non-geniculate coralline algae in the NWGMx for the Flower 

Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary offshore Texas by Minnery (1990); however, no 

specific epithets were assigned with confidence to the specimens which were identified as 

Lithothamnium sp. A, B and ‘Lithothamnium sejunctum?’ (Minnery, 1990 p. 996). Mateo-

Cid et al. (2014a) reported three species, L. occidentale (Foslie) Foslie, L. sejunctum, and L. 

crispatum Hauck (Hauck), from offshore the southwestern Gulf of Mexico near Campeche 

Banks and from the intertidal zone along the Atlantic coast of Mexico. Recently, Krayesky-

Self et al. (2016) reported two unnamed species of Lithothamnion from the NWGMx and 

provided the first published psbA sequence of Lithothamnion from this location. 

Recent DNA-based studies have shown a wealth of previously undocumented 

diversity of non-geniculate coralline algae in the Northeast Pacific (Adey et al. 2015), North 

Atlantic Ocean (Peña et al. 2014a, Pardo et al. 2014), the Mediterranean Sea (Peña et al. 

2015), the Caribbean (Peña et al. 2014b), the South Atlantic (Bahia et al. 2014, Sissini et al. 

2014, Vieira-Pinto et al. 2014) as well as in the Gulf of Mexico (Mateo-Cid et al. 2014b, 

Richards et al. 2014, Krayesky-Self et al. 2016) and the Gulf of California (Hernández-

Kantún et al. 2015). These studies demonstrated the importance of integrating DNA 

sequence analyses with morpho-anatomical studies when assessing biodiversity, and 

provided a preliminary reference framework for comparison with newly generated data.  

Following the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, seven box-dredging 

expeditions conducted in NWGMx rhodolith beds for the purpose of biomonitoring led to 

comparative DNA sequencing and morphological analyses of non-geniculate Corallinales 

and Hapalidiales specimens (Fredericq et al. 2014, Richards et al. 2014, Krayesky-Self et al. 

229 



 

2016). Often non-geniculate corallines were the only visible algal species present in the 

dredges post-spill (see Fredericq et al. 2014) and a substantial portion of these specimens 

identified as members of the subfamily Melobesiodeae (Hapalidiaceae, Hapalidiales) awaited 

further investigations.  

Herein we focus on the molecular and morphological characterization of six unnamed 

Lithothamnion species from these NWGMx collections based on phylogenetic analyses of 

DNA sequence data and high magnification imaging of thallus anatomy using scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM). The diversity of specimens fitting the generic concept of 

Lithothamnion in the NWGMx is addressed in the context of newly generated and publicly 

available data. 

Material and methods  

Specimens (Table 1) were collected with an Hourglass-design box dredge using minimum 

tow periods (usually 10 minutes or less) (Joyce &amp;amp; Williams 1969) deployed by the R/V 

Pelican, the UNOLS (University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System) research 

vessel stationed at LUMCON (Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium), during seven 

post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) expeditions in the vicinity of Ewing Bank (~28
o
 

05.737’N; 91
o
 01.608’W) and Sackett Bank (~28

o
 38.019’N; 89

o
 33.262’W). Expedition 

collection dates were December 2-6, 2010; April 19-24, 2011; August 26-30, 2011; August 

24-26, 2012; November 15-17, 2012; October 17-22, 2013; and September 7-14, 2014. 

During the course of the September 2014 cruise, samples were also collected offshore Florida 

in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico in the vicinity of the Dry Tortugas. Collected specimens 

were desiccated in silica gel aboard the R/V Pelican and/or preserved in 5% 

230 



 

formalin/seawater, and deposited in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Herbarium 

(LAF). Another portion of the samples was transported to the laboratory as “live rocks” 

(Delbeek &amp;amp; Sprung 2005) and grown in 75-liter microcosm tanks prior to harvesting and 

preservation as described in Fredericq et al. (2014), Richards et al. (2014) and Felder et al. 

(2014). Exploratory DNA sequencing and SEM imaging led to the identification of eight 

specimens from the NWGMx belonging to the genus Lithothamnion. For phylogeographic 

context, additional sequences generated from three rhodolith-forming samples of 

Lithothamnion from the surrounding areas of the Gulf of Mexico (vicinity of the Florida 

Middle Grounds in the NEGMx, Campeche Banks in the SWGMx, and near the Dry 

Tortugas areas in the SEGMx) were also included as well as two samples from Pacific 

Panama and three samples from the Brazilian states of Ceará and Bahia (both in the Tropical 

region of the Brazilian coast). 

DNA Extraction and PCR protocols. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 

samples from the Gulf of Mexico and Panama according to the protocol of Richards et al. 

(2014), while Brazilian samples were extracted using the protocol of Vieira-Pinto et al. 

(2014). In all cases DNA was extracted from the same specimens used for morphological 

analysis. Overall, 17 specimens of Lithothamnion spp. were sequenced (Table 1).  

Three markers were selected for PCR: the chloroplast-encoded photosystem II 

reaction center protein D1 gene (psbA) and Universal Plastid Amplicon 23S rRNA gene 

(UPA), and the mitochondria-encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (CO1). PCR for 

psbA was performed using the primers referenced in Yoon et al. (2002) under the following 

thermal profile: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min followed by 39 cycles at 94°C for 

30 sec (denaturation), 52°C for 50 sec (primer annealing), and 72°C (extension) for 1 min 

231 



 

followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR for COI was conducted using the 

primers referenced in Saunders (2005) with an initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 40 

cycles at 94°C for 1 min (denaturation), 45°C for 1 min (primer annealing), and 72°C 

(extension) for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR for UPA was 

performed using the primers and PCR protocol referenced in Sherwood &amp;amp; Presting (2007). 

PCR products where purified with ExoSAP-IT® (USB®) or by excision on a Agarose II 

(Ameresco) TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) gel followed by digestion with GELase
TM

 (Epicentre 

®). Purified PCR products were subsequently cycle sequenced using the BigDye Terminator 

v 3.1 kit (Life Technologies). Resulting cycle sequence reactions were purified with 

ETOH/EDTA precipitation and were either sequenced in-house at the UL Lafayette campus 

on an ABI Model 3130xl Genetic Analyzer, at the University of São Paulo campus on an 

ABI Model 3730 Genetic Analyzer, or outsourced (Beckman Coulter Genomics Danvers, 

MA). Resulting chromatograms were assembled using Sequencher 5.1 (Gene Codes Corp., 

Ann Arbor, MI, USA).   

Alignment. Newly generated and previously available DNA sequences from 

GenBank (Table 1) were aligned using the CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al. 1994) program in 

MEGA 5.2.2 (Tamura et al. 2011). For UPA, a small ambiguous region was cropped to the 

nearest conserved region, and the alignment was truncated to minimize missing data at the 3’ 

end. The final UPA alignment was 352 base pairs (bp) in length and included 14 newly 

generated sequences, 12 available Hapalidiacae sequences, and two sequences of Sporolithon 

spp. as the outgroup.  PsbA and COI aligned unambiguously. The final psbA alignment (863 

bp) comprised 13 newly generated sequences, 62 available sequences and 3 sequences of the 

Sporolithales. The final COI alignment (652 bp) included eight newly generated sequences, 

232 



 

33 available sequences, and three sequences of Sporolithon as the outgroup. Alignments were 

not concatenated due to a lack of corresponding markers available on GenBank.  

Multi-gene Alignment. CO1, UPA, and psbA alignments were imported to 

MacClade 4.08 (Maddison &amp;amp; Maddison 2000), blank cells were added in place of missing 

data where needed, and exported as NEXUS files for assembly using the application 

Sequence Matrix 1.7.8 (Vaidya et al. 2011). The alignment included concatenated sequences 

from three members of the Sporolithales and 60 concatenated sequences of the Hapalidiales. 

The final concatenated alignment was exported as a PHYLIP file for analysis with RAxML 

and was 1,867 base-pairs in length including a 652 base-pair portion of COI, a 352 base-pair 

portion of UPA, and a 863 base-pair portion of psbA.  

Phylogenetic and Barcoding Analyses. The UPA alignment was analyzed with the 

NJ distance-based method in MEGA 5.2.2 (Tamura et al. 2011) with 1,000 bootstrap 

replicates to assess branch support. Phylogenetic analyses of the psbA and COI alignments 

were conducted using Bayesian (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, both with a 

GTR+I+G model of evolution partitioned per codon position. Phylogenetic analysis of the 

multi-gene alignment was conducted using ML method, with a GTR+I+G model of evolution 

partitioned per codon position. Bayesian analysis was performed using Mr. Bayes 3.2.6 

(Ronquist et al. 2012). Two parallel analyses were conducted, each consisting of four 

MCMC chains (3 heated and 1 cool) with 1 x 10
7
 generations.  Resampling was performed 

every 1,000 generations resulting in a total of 2,002 trees for both runs. The first 10% of each 

run was discarded as “burn-in”, and a consensus tree was built with remaining data. 

Convergence was determined with Tracer v1.6 (Rambaut et al. 2014). ML analyses were 

conducted with the RAxML-HPC2 program using the online server ‘The CIPRES Science 

233 



 

Gateway V. 3.3’ (Miller et al. 2010) with 1,000 topological searches from random restarts, 

and 1,000 bootstrap replicates to assess branch support.  

Species Delimitation Analyses. Species delimitation analyses were performed on 

each of the psbA and COI datasets with both Automatic Barcode Gap Species Discovery 

(ABGD) and General Mixed Yule Coalescence (GMYC). For ABGD, branch lengths were 

extracted from the psbA and COI RAxML trees with the function cophenetic.phylo of the 

package APE in R (Paradis et al. 2004, R Core Team, 2015) to produce a distance matrix as 

input. The latter was run with minimum (pmin) and maximum (pmax) intraspecific distance 

priors comprised between 0.001 and 1 in 100 steps, and with a relative gap width values of 

0.003. Alternative species boundaries hypotheses were produced with the (GMYC) model 

with the package SPLITS in R (Fujisawa &amp;amp; Barraclough 2013), with the single threshold 

method based on an ultrametric tree generated in BEAST v2.0 (Bouckaert et al. 2014) using 

a relaxed log-normal clock with a constant population coalescent as prior, and a GTR+I+G 

model of evolution partitioned per codon position. MCMC chains were run for 30 million 

generations (sampled every 1000th generations) and the quality of the run assessed in Tracer 

v1.6 (Rambaut &amp;amp; Drummond 2007) to ensure that ESS values were &gt; 200 with the default 

burnin (3000 trees).  

 Evaluation of Pairwise Distance Distribution for Three Markers. The distribution 

of raw pairwise distances was computed for the three markers utilized in the present study in 

order to evaluate their phylogenetic informativeness. Distances were calculated by dividing 

the number of base pair differences by the alignment length. Alignments were cropped at 

their 5' and 3' ends when missing data was present and short sequences were removed as to 

not overinflate pairwise distances. Distance matrices were constructed for each of the UPA, 

234 



 

psbA, and COI alignments using Geneious version R9 (http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et 

al., 2012). 

 Preparation of Material for Scanning Electron Microscopy. Portions of the thallus 

from silica gel-dried specimens were removed using a razor blade and forceps. Sections were 

made manually using a razor blade and mounted using liquid graphite and coated with 15 nm 

of gold. To ensure even distribution of the gold over the three dimensional features in the 

sections, coating was performed in two applications. First, 8 nm of gold was applied with the 

stub lying flat on the stage of the coating chamber. After the first application, the specimen 

was tilted using a coin placed underneath the stub and a second application of 7 nm of gold 

was performed.  Specimens were viewed using a Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron 

microscope (SEM) at a voltage of 15 kV, housed in the Microscopy Center at UL Lafayette, 

following the manufacturer’s instructions. 

Results 

DNA sequence Analyses. The backbones of the three phylogenies are overall poorly 

resolved (Fig. 1-3). Numerous lineages harboring specimens fitting the morphological 

concept of Lithothamnion spp. (see next sections) receive high support with both analyses 

and overall, UPA, psbA, and COI trees revealed previously undocumented molecular 

diversity found in the Gulf of Mexico, WTA, and Pacific Panama. While UPA is less 

sampled and less resolved than psbA and COI, all trees, including the multi-gene tree (Fig. 

4), demonstrate the polyphyly of specimens identified as Lithothamnion species interspersed 

among (or sister to) other genera of Hapalidiaceae. In the best sampled trees (taxa-wise, i.e. 

psbA and COI), Lithothamnion spp. are found in early branching paraphyletic lineages and a 

235 

http://www.geneious.com/


 

monophyletic lineage sister to several lineages including Mesophyllum, “Leptophytum” 

foecundum, Synartrophyton, and members of the Clathromorphum complex of genera (sensu 

Adey et al. 2015). Phymatholithon spp. are nested among early branching lineages of 

Lithothamnion spp. Several unresolved sequences labeled as Hapalidiaceae sp. branch within 

Lithothamnion clades, in psbA and COI (LBC0640, Bittner et al. 2011; E58, Hernández-

Kantún et al. 2015), and in the UPA tree especially (FLOR14925-30, Sissini et al. 2014). The 

results of the ABGD and GMYC analyses showed some discrepancies in the number of 

delimited molecular species for the entire data set, especially for psbA, 41 vs. 52 species 

(respectively, Fig. S1), whereas results for COI were more congruent, 27 vs. 28 species 

(respectively, Fig. S2). However, delimitation for the newly investigated specimens (GMx, 

WTA, Pacific Panama), reported in the psbA tree and the COI tree as Hapalidiaceae sp. A to 

J were all congruent in revealing nine of these ten separate entities found in GMx (spp. A, B, 

C, D, E, F, G, H, I) and one in Brazil (sp. I). Nonetheless, whether sister sequences to the 

above taxa that are found in other locations are conspecifics is unclear based on the present 

data set. For instance in the COI tree, Lithothamnion sp. I from the Gulf of Mexico and 

specimens from Bahia and Ceará in Brazil split in two entities with GMYC analyses, where 

ABGD delimit a single species. Likewise, in the psbA tree, LBC0640 and Hapalidiaceae sp. 

D were split in the GMYC analyses but delimited as a single species in the ABGD analyses. 

Species annotation for the newly generated specimens were transferred to the UPA, psbA and 

COI trees (Figs. 1-3) based on the above psbA and COI delimitation results and herein are 

referred to as Lithothamnion spp. A-J. The multi-gene tree was also congruent in revealing 

Hapalidiaceae sp. A to J as ten separate entities (Fig. 4). Finally, evaluation of pairwise 

distance distribution for the three markers as a proxy for these markers’ speed of evolution 

236 



 

and phylogenetic informativeness indicated that UPA is the most conserved, followed by 

psbA and the most variable, COI (Fig. 5). 

The NJ analysis of the UPA alignment shows multiple sequences labeled as Hapalidiaceae 

sp. among which our Lithothamnion spp. are interspersed. Three clades receive moderate to 

strong support (BS= 77-99%, Fig. 1, Lithothamnion spp. A-J). Six of these clades include 

specimens from the NWGMx, with one of the six (Lithothamnion sp. I) also represented by a 

specimen from the NEGMx and a specimen from Brazil. UPA sequences of specimens of 

Lithothamnion sp. I from the GMx and Brazil were 100% identical (Table S1). Two clades 

(Lithothamnion spp. D and J) each include a specimen from Pacific Panama and two clades 

each include a single specimen from the Campeche Banks and vicinity of the Dry Tortugas, 

respectively.  

The results of the psbA analysis revealed 9 clades (psbA for Lithothamnion sp. H was not 

successfully amplified). Though several lineages within the Hapalidiales received high 

support (Fig. 2), branching order in the deeper nodes was unresolved. The psbA sequence of 

Lithothamnion sp. G is sister to L. coralloides (P. Crouan &amp;amp; H. Crouan) P. Crouan &amp;amp; H. 

Crouan (97.9% similarity, Table S2) with moderately good support in the Bayesian analysis 

(PP=0.82) but low support in the ML analysis (BS= 51%). Lithothamnion sp. G and L. 

coralloides are sister to L. crispatum, which are nested with a clade of other available 

sequences of Lithothamnion spp. including a specimen identified as L. muellerii from Isla 

San Jose, Mexico and specimens of L. glaciale from the North Atlantic. Sequences of 

Lithothamnion spp. I and J were sister to each other and comprised a lineage with full 

support in both Bayesian and ML analyses. The psbA sequence of Hapalidiaceae sp. E58, 

from La Paz, Mexico, is sister to Lithothamnion sp. J from Pacific Panama with strong 

237 



 

support (PP= 0.98, BS=94%) and these sequences show high similarity (98.8%). 

Phymatolithon calcareum is sister to the lineage comprised of Lithothamnion sp. I, J, and 

E58. This node is strongly supported in the Bayesian analysis (PP=0.99) but not in the ML 

analysis. The sequence of P. calcareum differed from sequences of Lithothamnion spp. I, J 

by 7.5-8.3%. Sequences of Brazilian specimens of Lithothamnion sp. I differed from 

sequences of the GMx specimens by 3-5 base pairs (0.35-0.58% difference). Lithothamnion 

sp. E and F comprise a clade at the base of the Hapalidiales, with Lithothamnion sp. 

(LBC0642) nested in between Lithothamnion sp. E and F.   

 Lithothamnion spp. A-D includes specimens from the GMx and a specimen from 

Pacific Panama. These specimens, together with specimens identified as Lithothamnion 

(“Species1-3”) from Guadeloupe, French West Indies (FWI), an unidentified Hapalidiaceae 

specimen from New Caledonia, specimens identified as Mesophyllum sp. 1 and 2 from 

Macaronesia, and a specimen identified as Lithothamnion cf. ruptile, comprised a 

monophyletic lineage with strong support (PP= 1, BS= 99%). Within this lineage, 

Lithothamnion sp. D is sister to the unidentified Hapalidiaceae sp. (LBC0640) with strong 

support (PP=1, BS= 95%), and these sequences show high similarity (98.7%). This lineage is 

sister to the Clathromorphum-complex with moderate support in the Bayesian analysis 

(PP=0.71), but with low support in the ML analysis (BS&amp;lt;50%). The Clathromorphum-

complex formed a monophyletic lineage with strong support (PP=1, BS=97%). The lineage 

including Lithothamnion spp. A-D and the Clathromorphum-complex lineage are both sister 

in a larger clade including specimens identified as Synarthrophyton patena, sequences of 

specimens belonging to Mesophyllum, including M. lichenoides (J. Ellis) Lemoine, M. 

erubescens (Foslie) Lemoine, and M. sphaericum Peña, Bárbara, Adey, Riosmena-Rodríguez 

238 



 

&amp;amp; H.G. Choi and “Leptophytum” foecundum (Kjellman) Adey. This clade is well supported 

(PP=1, BS= 92%) but has unresolved branching order (ie. a polytomy) at the base. 

 The results of the COI analysis revealed 6 clades (COI for Lithothamnion sp. B, C, D, 

and G were not successfully amplified). The sequence of specimen LAF6970C, 

Lithothamnion sp. H (KU514416), from offshore Florida in the SEGMx, is identical to the 

sequence of the specimen identified as Lithothamnion, “Species 5 PC0144250” (KJ710337) 

published by Peña et al. (2014) from Guadeloupe, FWI. The COI tree (Fig. 3) shows the 

Hapalidiaceae lineage received full support in both the Bayesian and ML analyses, and is 

comprised of two sister lineages that are each well supported in the Bayesian analysis (PP=1, 

.99) but lack support in the ML analysis (BS&lt;50%). The clade comprised of Lithothamnion 

spp. E, F, and Lithothamnion sp. LBC0642 shows a different topology than in the psbA tree. 

This clade is sister to L. coralloides and nested within a larger clade including L. glaciale, L. 

sp., and L. sp.32 with Lithothamnion sp. H/“Species 5 PC0144250” comprising a clade at the 

base of this lineage. COI sequences of the Brazilian and GMx specimen of Lithothamnion sp. 

I differed by 2.6% (Table S3). Lithothamnion sp. I and J comprise a clade sister to 

Phymatolithon calcareum, however this lineage received only moderate support in the 

Bayesian analysis (PP=0.86) and was not supported in the ML analysis (BS&lt;50%). The COI 

sequence of P. calcareum differed from the COI sequences of Lithothamnion spp. I and J by 

12.2-12.7%. Lithothamnion sp. A, which is sister to the unidentified Hapalidiaceae sp. 

LBC0640 from New Caledonia, comprises a clade that is well supported in the Bayesian 

analysis (PP=.99) but not supported in the ML analysis (BS=&amp;lt;50%). Although sample size 

in this clade is smaller than in the psbA tree, the specimens for which both COI and psbA 

data are available, including the unnamed Lithothamnion spp. (“Species1-3”) from 

239 



 

Guadeloupe, FWI and ‘Mesophyllum’ sp. 1 and 2 from Macaronesia, show similar groupings 

in the COI tree as in the psbA tree. This clade is nested within a larger clade including three 

other branches, one comprised of a specimen identified as Synarthrophyton patena, a second 

comprised of Mesophyllum spp., and a third comprised of two specimens identified as 

Lithothamnion sp. (LBC0845 and “Species 4-PC0144248”) that were not present in the psbA 

analysis. No psbA data are available for “Species 4-PC0144248” and the corresponding psbA 

sequence for LBC0845 comprised a long branch with low support in preliminary analyses 

(data not shown) and was excluded from the final analysis. 

 The ML analysis of the concatenated multi-gene alignment resulted in a tree with a 

backbone that is more resolved overall than the individual gene trees (Fig. 4) and revealed 10 

clades of Hapalidiales within the newly generated data for this study (Lithothamnion spp. A-

J). In this analysis, Hapalidiales comprised a monophyletic clade with full bootstrap support 

(100%) and several lineages within the Hapalidiales received high support. The clades are 

overall congruent with the psbA and COI single-gene analyses (Figs. 2, 3), although in this 

analysis, the clade comprised of Lithothamnion spp., including specimens of L. muelleri, L. 

crispatum, L. corallioides, L. glaciale, L. lemoineae, L. tophiforme, and Lithothamnion spp. 

E-H, is more resolved (BS=97%) and is sister to the clade including Lithothamnion spp. I-J 

and Phymatholithon calcareum with moderate support (BS=73%). The clade including 

Lithothamnion spp. A-D, Lithothamnion and Mesophyllum species from the North Atlantic 

and Caribbean, and unidentified Hapalidiaceae species from Brazil and the Indo-Pacific, 

comprised a monophyletic lineage with strong support (BS= 99%).

Species delimitation: The ABGD analyses of both psbA and COI delimited the specimens 

LAF6521, LAF1437, SPF57882, SPF57883 and SPF57884 (Lithothamnion sp. I) as being a 

single species, whereas the GMYC analyses of psbA and COI delimited LAF6521/LAF1437 

and SPF57882/SPF57883/SPF57884 as separate species. Both ABGD and GMYC analyses 

delimited PHYKOS7249 (Lithothamnion sp. J) and Hapalidiacae sp. E58 as being separate 

species. The ABGD analyses of psbA delimited the sequence of LBC0640 as being the same 

species as specimen LAF6631 (Lithothamnion sp. D), whereas the GMYC analyses of psbA 

indicated LBC0640 and LAF6631 are different species. Both GMYC and ABGD analyses 

delimited specimen LAF6970C (Lithothamnion sp. H) and “Species 5-PC0144250” as being 

a single species. 

Morphological analysis: Scanning electron microscopy identified 16 specimens with 

characters corresponding to the genus Lithothamnion. All specimens analyzed were non-

parasitic, calcified, non-geniculate thalli forming biogenic rhodoliths or encrusting autogenic 

rhodoliths or other substrata. A non-coaxial, monomerous thallus construction was observed 

in all specimens, that consistently exhibited cell fusions linking cells of adjacent filaments 

and lacked secondary pit connections, palisade cells and trichocytes (see Table 2 for 

complete list of vegetative characters). All crustose specimens possessed dorsiventral 

orientation with a multilayered hypothallus consisting of hypothallial filaments with 

rectangular-shaped hypothallial cells that are approximately isodiametric in cross section. 

Protuberant rhodolith specimens showed radial construction in vegetative protuberances 

(sometimes interspersed by new vegetative growth layers), whereas reproductive 

protuberances possessed radial construction interspersed by conceptacles and new vegetative 

growth layers. Crustose portions of protuberant rhodoliths were not sectioned to preserve the 

241 



 

intact rhodolith as a morphological voucher specimen. All specimens displayed a single layer 

of epithallial cells with thick, heavily calcified cell walls that varied in size, shape, and 

degree of thickness of the cell walls. Large secondary interfilament crystals characteristic of 

Clathromorphum were not observed in any of the specimens examined. Considering the 

molecular and morphological data, existing names could not be assigned with confidence to 

any of the species described below.  

 Lithothamnion sp. A Specimens LAF6547 and LAF6549 are separate thalli with no 

protuberances encrusting the same autogenic rhodolith (Fig. 6A). Sections show a 

multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments (Fig. 6B, lower bracket) with 

rectangular-shaped cells growing parallel to the substratum (Fig. 6B, larger arrows) and 

arching tiers of perithallial filaments (Fig, 6B, upper bracket) growing perpendicular to the 

substratum. Adjacent perithallial filaments linked by cell fusions (Fig. 6B smaller arrows, 

Fig. 6C, F). Epithallial cells (Fig. 6C) with thick, heavily calcified cell walls and cylinder-

shaped lumens. Surface views show multiporate conceptacles (Fig. 6D, E) that are 

interpreted as being tetrasporangial. Spores were not shown in conceptacle sections (data not 

shown), and the conceptacles appeared post-spore release. Pores surrounded by 5-7 rosette 

cells (Fig. 5F). 

Lithothamnion sp. B Specimen LAF6957B possesses a thallus with some protuberances 

(Fig. 7A, black arrows) encrusting an eroded bivalve shell (Fig. 7A, brackets). Crustose 

portion loosely adhered to substratum with lobed margins (Fig. 7A white arrow). Sections 

show multilayered hypothallus comprised of filaments growing parallel to the substratum 

(7B, lower bracket), that gives rise to arching tiers of perithallial filaments growing 

perpendicular to the substratum (7B, upper bracket). Perithallus with numerous cell fusions 

242 



 

often linking only two adjacent filaments (Fig. 7C arrows). Sections show conceptacles 

which are raised with respect to the surrounding thallus surface (Fig. 7D), some becoming 

filled in with crystals from secondary mineralization (Fig. 7C black arrow). It was not 

evident if conceptacles were uniporate or multiporate. Epithallial cells with a polygonal 

outline, trapezoidal shaped lumens (Figs. 7E, F) and epithallial cell roofs that may remain 

intact (Fig. 7C circle arrow) or become collapsed (Fig. 7D circle arrow).    

Lithothamnion sp. C Specimen 6820 is a rhodolith that possesses numerous unbranched 

protuberances (Fig. 8A). Median periclinal sections show protuberances composed of 

abundant overgrown conceptacles (Fig. 8B), many with needle-like crystals of putative 

aragonite (Fig. 8C, arrow). Conceptacles are uniporate (Fig. 8C, circle arrow) and are 

interpreted to be either male or female gametangial conceptacles. Sections show conceptacles 

become overgrown by continuation of growth of the perithallial cells, aided by elongation of 

perithallial cells at the periphery of conceptacles (Fig. 8D, arrows). Cells bordering the 

conceptacles show infill with small, centripetally formed calcite crystals (Fig. 8E, F arrows). 

Small, unidentified spherical inclusions observed in cells near the empty conceptacles may 

be life history stages of unicellular organisms (Fig. 8F, circle arrows). Sections infrequently 

show newly formed hypothallial filaments consisting of rectangular-shaped cells (Fig. 8G, H, 

circle arrow, upper bracket) growing over older parts of the thallus (Fig. 8G, H, lower 

bracket). Perithallus with numerous cell fusions often fusing several adjacent filaments (Fig. 

8A, “F”). In some locations sections show intercalary meristematic cells (Fig. 8B, “M”) 

between the epithallus (Fig. 8B, upper bracket) and perithallus (Fig. 8B, lower bracket) while 

other locations show cells below the epithallus that appear to be recently divided 

meristematic cells (Fig. 8B, *). Epithallial cells with heavily calcified cell walls, which are 

243 



 

thicker at the proximal end of the cell and thinner at the distal end, a trapezoidal-shaped cell 

lumen (Fig. 8B arrows) and a thinner epithallial cell roof which may or may not remain intact 

(Fig. 8B circle arrows).  

Lithothamnion sp. C Specimen 6956B is a rhodolith that possesses numerous, sometimes 

branched, protuberances (Fig. 9C, arrow). Median periclinal sections show thallus 

construction similar to LAF6820, excepting that putative aragonite crystals which infill the 

conceptacles are in the form of spherical masses (Fig. 9D, arrows). Some portions of the 

thallus are very heavily calcified; sections show the polygonal outline of filaments where 

cells were cleaved apart from their adjacent filaments in the z-axis (Fig. 9E, black arrows) 

and reveal the cell fusions in the z-axis (Fig. 9E, “F”). Some locations in the heavily calcified 

areas show the sections of individual cells, revealing epithallial cells (Fig. 9E, F, brackets) 

with a trapezoidal shaped cell lumen (Fig. 9E, F, white arrows) and meristematic cells (Fig. 

9F, “M”) similar in size and shape to those of LAF6820.  

Lithothamnion sp. D Specimen LAF6631 possesses a thallus with no protuberances 

encrusting a small putative limestone nodule (Fig. 10A). Thallus sections show multiple 

layers of hypothallial filaments (Fig. 10B, lower bracket) that give rise to arching tiers of 

perithallial filaments (Fig. 10B, upper bracket). Perithallus with abundant cell fusions (Fig. 

10C, “F”) sometimes occurring between more than two adjacent filaments. Surface views of 

epithallus (Fig. 10D, right bracket, Fig. 10E, left bracket, arrows, Fig. 10F, arrows) show 

cells possess a polygonal outline. Partial section views show flattened epithallial cells each 

with a small lumen (Fig. 10D, arrow). Epithallial cell roofs (Fig. 10F, arrows) appear thin 

and collapsed into the cell lumen. Cells subtending the epithallial cells are not clearly 

identified as meristematic cells (Fig. 10D, E, F, *) and in some location the cells subtending 

244 



 

the epithallial cells appear as possible pairs of recently divided meristematic cells (Fig. 10E, 

F, *).     

Lithothamnion sp. E Specimen LAF5421 possesses a thallus with no protuberances, 

encrusting an autogenic rhodolith fragment (Fig. 11A, bracket). Sections show the thallus 

(Fig. 11B, upper bracket) and substratum (Fig. 11B, lower bracket). Hypothallus with 

multiple layers of hypothallial filaments (Fig. 11C arrow, lower bracket) with rectangular 

shaped cells that grow parallel to the substratum, and give rise to arching tiers of perithallial 

filaments (Fig. 11C, upper bracket) that grow perpendicular to the substratum. Sections and 

surface views show remnant, heavily calcified proximal cell walls with primary pit 

connections in the center of the walls appearing as small round structures (Fig. 11D, arrows) 

and do not show intact cells of the epithallus or clearly show meristematic cells (Fig. 11D). 

Lithothamnion sp. F Specimen LAF6882 is a rhodolith that possesses numerous 

protuberances (Fig. 12A). Median periclinal sections of protuberances show overgrown 

conceptacles (Fig. 12B, arrow, circle arrow) that in some locations become filled in with 

putative aragonite crystals (Fig. 12B, circle arrow) from secondary mineralization. Sections 

show conceptacles and older parts of the thallus (Fig. 12C, lower left bracket) become 

overgrown by new vegetative growth through the formation of a new multilayered 

hypothallus oriented parallel to the older parts of the thallus (Fig. 12C, lower right bracket). 

Hypothallial filaments give rise to the arching tiers of perithallial filaments (Fig. 12C, upper 

right bracket) that form newly developed protuberances (Fig. 12C, circle arrow) or add 

volume to existing protuberances. Perithallus with abundant cell fusions (Fig. 12C, inset, 

arrows). Intercalary meristematic cells (Fig. 12D, “M”) shown between the epithallus (Fig. 

12D, upper bracket) and perithallus (Fig. 12D, lower bracket). Epithallial cells with thick, 

245 



 

heavily calcified cell walls and cylinder-shaped lumens. (Fig. 12E, arrows) that have a 

polygonal outline in surface view and an epithallial cell roof (Fig. 12E, circle arrow) that is 

missing from cells shown in cross section. In some locations, sections show cells exhibiting 

pseudodichotomous branching at the distal end of filaments of the perithallus, near the 

epithallus, with primary pit connections linked to a distal cell and a sub-lateral cell (Fig. 12F, 

arrows). Lumens of some perithallial cells with secondary mineralization (Fig. 12F, circle 

arrow). 

Lithothamnion sp. G Specimen LAF6548 is a biogenic rhodolith with numerous 

protuberances (Fig. 13A inset). Median periclinal sections of protuberances show overgrown 

conceptacles (Fig.  13A, arrows; * denotes area magnified in Fig. 13C.) with remnant organic 

material (Fig. 13B, arrow). Sections show conceptacle overgrowth resulted from newly 

formed hypothallial filaments (Fig. 13C, arrow) that developed over the conceptacle roof and 

give rise to new perithallial filaments. Cross sections of protuberances show radial 

construction (Fig. 13D), with overgrown conceptacles showing some secondary mineral infill 

(Fig. 13D, arrow). Perithallus with abundant cell fusions (F) that link more than two adjacent 

filaments (Fig. 13E). Epithallial cells (Fig. 13F) with thick, heavily calcified cell walls and 

slightly trapezoidal shaped lumens (arrows) with a polygonal cell outline, varying between 

pentagonal and hexagonal. Section and surface views show intercalary meristematic cells 

subtend the epithallial cells (Fig. 13F, “M”). 

Lithothamnion sp. H Specimen LAF6970C is a small rhodolith with numerous 

protuberances (Fig. 14A). Median periclinal sections show protuberances composed of 

vegetative filaments interspersed by numerous overgrown conceptacles (Fig. 14B, black 

arrows). Sections show overgrowth is achieved by small rectangular cells that are cut off 

246 



 

from perithallial cells bordering the conceptacles and develop over the conceptacle roof (Fig. 

14B, C, white arrow). Sections did not show conspicuous elongated perithallial cells 

bordering the conceptacles’ periphery. Cross sections of protuberances show radial 

construction interspersed by overgrown conceptacles, with one conceptacle including an 

unidentified organism (Fig. 14D, Fig. 14D inset, white arrow) and others that become filled 

in with putative aragonite crystals (Fig. 14D, E, black arrows). Perithallus with numerous cell 

fusions (Fig. 14E, “F”) in some locations linking more than two filaments. Sections show an 

intercalary meristem (Fig. 14G, arrow) between the epithallus (Fig. 14G, upper brackets) and 

perithallus (Fig. 14G, lower bracket) with meristematic cells (Fig. 14G, H, “M”) and pairs of 

recently divided meristematic cells (Fig. 14G, H, *). Section views (Fig. 14H, black bracket) 

and surface views (Fig. 14H, white brackets) show epithallial cells possess heavily calcified 

lateral and proximal cell walls, a very small round cell lumen, and a thin, weakly calcified 

epithallial cell roof. Section views reveal the round shaped lumen in part (Fig. 14H, arrows) 

and surface views of cells lacking the epithallial cell roof reveal the round shaped lumen 

(Fig. 14H, arrow, “L”). Surface views of cells with an intact epithallial cell roof show 

primary pit connections in the center of the roof (Fig. 14H, circle arrow, “P”) appearing as a 

very small circular dark spot. 

Lithothamnion sp. I Specimen LAF6521 is a rhodolith with protuberances (Fig. 15A). 

Median periclinal sections show protuberances composed largely of vegetative filaments 

(Fig. 15B) with a single putative overgrown conceptacle (Fig. 15B, circle arrow). Sections 

show a new growth layer (Fig. 15B, arrow) over the older thallus surface. Newly formed 

multilayered hypothallus comprised of hypothallial filaments with rectangular shaped cells 

(Fig. 15C middle right bracket) that grow over the older layer of thallus (Fig. 15C lower right 

247 



 

bracket) and give rise to arching tiers of perithallial filaments (Fig. 15C upper right bracket). 

Surface views (Fig. 15C left bracket) and section views show epithallial cells (Fig. 15D) with 

heavily calcified lateral and proximal cell walls, a trapezoidal shaped cell lumen (Fig. 15D 

arrows), and a thinner, weakly calcified epithallial cell roof (Fig. 15D, white arrows). 

Sections show intercalary meristematic cells (Fig. 15D, “M”) between the perithallus and 

epithallus. Perithallus with abundant cell fusions (Fig. 15D) linking cells of adjacent 

filaments on all lateral sides, shown in the x-axis (black “F”) and z-axis (white “F”) of 

sections. Cross sections of protuberances (Fig. 15E, F) show radial construction and revealed 

the new growth layer (Fig. 15F, upper bracket, also shown in Fig. 15B, arrow) formed from 

filaments that “erupt” from the perithallus of the older growth layer (Fig. 15E, F arrow) and 

develop into a newly formed hypothallus. The newly formed hypothallus grows up and over 

the older part of the thallus and gives rise to newly formed arching tiers of perithallial 

filaments. 

Lithothamnion sp. I Specimen LAF1437 is a rhodolith with numerous protuberances (Fig. 

16A). Median periclinal sections of protuberances show numerous overgrown conceptacles 

(Fig. 16A, inset, white arrows) with aragonite infill in the form of needle-like crystals (Figs. 

16B, C, black arrows) and spherical masses (Fig. 16B, C, black circle arrows). Sections show 

conceptacles possess a single pore in the conceptacle roof (Fig. 16C, white circle arrow) 

indicating they are either male or female gametangial conceptacles. Newly formed 

hypothallus (Figs. 16C, D, white arrow, Fig. 16D, upper right bracket) develops from 

perithallial cells surrounding the conceptacle, and grows over the roof of old conceptacles 

(Fig. 16D, lower right bracket) giving rise to newly formed arching tiers of perithallial 

filaments (Fig. 16D, left bracket). Perithallus with numerous cell fusions (Figs. 16E, F, G, 

248 



 

“F”) and in some locations with abundant unidentified spherical inclusions (Fig. 16E). 

Sections show intercalary meristematic cells (Figs. 16F, G, “M”) between the perithallus 

(Fig. 16F, lower bracket, Fig. 16G, arc) and epithallus (Fig. 16F, upper bracket). Epithallial 

cells (Figs. 16F, G, H) with a trapezoidal shaped cell lumen (Figs. 16F, G white arrow, Fig. 

7H, *) and thick, heavily calcified cell walls, which are thickest at the proximal end of the 

lateral walls (Fig. 16H, horizontal arrows) and become thinner near the distal end (Fig. 16H, 

vertical arrows), and an epithallial cell roof (Figs. 16F, G, H, circle arrow) which is 

sometimes missing in sections (Figs. 16F, G, white arrows). 

Lithothamnion sp. I Specimen SPF57882 is a rhodolith with numerous protuberances (Fig. 

17A). Median periclinal sections show protuberances composed largely of vegetative 

filaments (Fig. 17B) with radial construction. Sections show a new growth layer (Figs. 17B, 

C, D, white brackets) over the surface of the older portion of the protuberance (Figs. 17B, C, 

D, black brackets). Newly formed hypothallus with multiple layers of hypothallial filaments 

comprised of rectangular shaped cells (Figs. 17C, D, arrow), apparently cut off from cells of 

the perithallus in the older growth layer, develops over the surface of the older growth layer 

and gives rise to newly formed arching tiers of perithallial filaments. Perithallus with 

abundant cell fusions (Fig. 17E, “F”) fusing cells of adjacent filaments from all lateral sides, 

shown in the x-axis (black “F”) and z-axis (white “F”) of sections. Sections of protuberances 

show the perithallus consists of filaments with alternating layers of cells with thick, heavily 

calcified cell walls (Fig. 17F, lower bracket) and cells with thin, weakly calcified cell walls 

(Fig. 17F, upper bracket). Epithallial cells (Fig. 17G, bracket) with heavily calcified lateral 

and proximal cell walls, a trapezoidal shaped cell lumen (Fig. 17G arrows), and a thinner, 

weakly calcified epithallial cell roof (Fig. 17G, circle arrows). Sections show recently 

249 



 

divided meristematic cells subtending the epithallial cells in some locations (Fig. 17G, *). 

Epithallial cells remain intact (Fig. 17H, arrow) upon being buried by newly formed 

hypothallial filaments, which appear round or square in cross section (Fig. 17H, bracket). 

Sections showed several putative buried conceptacles lacking aragonite infill (data not 

shown) but no diagnostic characters were evident to indicate if conceptacles were 

gametangial or tetrasporangial. 

Lithothamnion sp. J Specimen PHYKOS7249 is a rhodolith with numerous protuberances 

(Fig. 18A). Median periclinal sections of protuberances show overgrown conceptacles (Fig. 

18B arrows), which frequently become filled in with aragonite crystals (Fig. 18B perforated 

arrows). Newly formed hypothallus (Fig. 18C right lower bracket) develops over old 

conceptacle roofs (Fig. 18C left bracket) and gives rise to the next layer of perithallus (Fig. 

18C upper right bracket). Sections show conceptacles are multiporate, indicated by the 

presence of pores within conceptacle roofs (Fig. 18C arrows) and are interpreted as 

tetrasporangial conceptacles. Intercalary meristematic cells were identified (Fig. 18D “M”), 

as well as recently divided meristematic cells (Fig. 18D, black outline). Perithallus with 

abundant cell fusions, in some locations linking cells of two or more adjacent filaments (Fig. 

18D, “F”, circle arrow). Epithallial cells (Fig. 18D,E) with a trapezoidal shaped lumen (Fig. 

18D, white arrows). In some locations sections show recently divided epithallial cells (Fig. 

18E) with very little space between the epithallial cell roof (Fig. 18E, circle arrows) and the 

proximal epithallial cell wall (arrows). Sections show aragonite crystals (Fig. 18F, G) infill 

empty conceptacles and grow from the roof and floor (Fig. 18F, arrows). Aragonite crystals 

have two forms; spherical masses, appearing fan-shaped in cross section (Fig. 18F arrows) 

and needle-like crystals with a hexagonal outline (Fig. 18G, arrow).

Discussion 

We show the likely polyphyly of the genus Lithothamnion as recently demonstrated 

by Peña et al. (2014), and identify additional species that were previously unreported for the 

northern GMx, and more broadly the WTA. Our extensive SEM investigation of specimens 

spanning the two clades of Lithothamnion spp. (i.e. sp. A, B, C, D vs. sp. E, F, G, H, I, J) 

showed that both demonstrated characteristic generic features of the genus, but also lacked 

obvious distinguishing morpho-anatomical characters that would support their segregation 

into two genera. In light of these results, it is currently impossible to provide a taxonomic 

solution by assigning Lithothamnion sensu stricto, nor a new genus name, to any of the 

lineages depicted on the tree until DNA sequencing of the generitype specimen of L. muelleri 

is performed, or less preferably, conducted on samples collected at or near the type locality in 

South Australia.  

Currently, only two DNA sequences (one psbA and one SSU) are available from a 

single specimen conforming to the morphological concept of L. muelleri (collected from Isla 

San José, Baja California). DNA sequences generated from the lectotype specimen of L. 

muelleri, housed at CN (Woelkerling 1983), may help clarify the relationship between this 

southern hemisphere specimen and the northern hemisphere specimen identified as L. 

muelleri, and may also shed light on the relationships between other southern and northern 

hemisphere species of Lithothamnion.  

The results of the UPA analysis (Fig. 1) show that none of the newly generated 

sequences (Lithothamnion spp. A-J) in this study are closely related to the rhodolith-forming 

species Mesophyllum erubescens (Foslie) Me. Lemoine (type locality: Fernando de Noronha 

251 



 

Archipelago, Brazil). Interestingly, the recently published sequences of two unidentified 

Hapalidiaceae specimens, FLOR14925 and FLOR14926 from Brazil (Sissini et al. 2014) are 

nested within the clade comprised of Lithothamnion sp. A, B, C, D in both the UPA tree and 

multi-gene tree (Fig. 4), though no further comparisons to these specimens could be made 

due to a lack of other corresponding molecular markers and morphological descriptions.  

 The results of the psbA analysis (Fig. 2) indicate that the lineage harboring 

Lithothamnion spp. A, B, C, and D represents a well-supported lineage separate from other 

Lithothamnion spp. Included in this lineage are the specimens collected from subtidal depths 

(5-50m) offshore Guadeloupe, F.W.I investigated in Peña et al. (2014) and identified based 

on morphology as Lithothamnion spp. (tentatively assigned as Species 1, 2, and 3), L. cf. 

ruptile, as well as L. cf crispatum collected from the Mediterranean Sea. Peña et al. (2014) 

showed in their psbA analysis that these specimens comprised a strongly supported lineage 

separate from the lineage comprised of L. muellerii, L. glaciale, and L. coralloides, and noted 

obtaining DNA sequences from the type specimens of L. ruptile, L. crispatum, and L. 

occidentale may aid in clarifying relationships between this lineage and other Lithothamnion 

spp. Interestingly, sequences of specimens identified as Mesophyllum sp. 1 and 2, from 

subtidal depths in the vicinity of Macaronesia (20 and 15m, respectively) investigated by 

Pardo et al. (2014) are also nested within this lineage and comprise a clade with 

Lithothamnion spp. (Species 1, 2, and 3) from Guadeloupe. Pardo et al. (2014) reported that 

these specimens shared morphological characters with Lithothamnion spp. but concluded that 

the specimens belonged in Mesophyllum based on the results of the molecular analyses, 

which indicated that these specimens were sister to Mesophylum sphaericum Peña, Bárbara, 

Adey, Riosmena-Rodríquez et Choi with strong support. An unidentified Hapalidiaceae 

252 



 

specimen from New Caledonia is also nested within this lineage, which is sister to 

Lithothamnion sp. D, specimen LAF6631, from Pacific Panama, indicating that this lineage 

has a wide distribution. The psbA sequences of this specimen LBC0640 shows a high 

similarity with the sequence of Lithothamnion sp. D (98.7%). ABGD analyses indicated 

these specimens represent separate species while GMYC analyses delimited the specimens as 

a single species. Future collections in the tropical Pacific may aid in clarifying the 

relationship between these two specimens. The results of the concatenated ML analysis (Fig. 

4) support that the lineage harboring Lithothamnion spp. A, B, C, and D represents a lineage 

separate from other Lithothamnion spp. (E-I).  

 With a larger sample size, including the recently published sequences shown by 

Sissini et al. (2014) to correspond to the holotype of M. erubescens (Foslie) Me. Lemoine 

1928, we show here that M. sphaericum is sister to M. erubescens with strong support in the 

psbA tree (PP=0.99, BS=92%) (Fig. 3) and in the multi-gene tree (BS=98%) (Fig. 4). The 

Clathromorphum-complex comprised a lineage with full support. The branching order of 

Mesophyllum sphaericum, M. erubescens, and M. lichenoides, as well as specimens 

identified as Synarthophyton patena, was unresolved (i.e. a polytomy) in the psbA tree (Fig. 

2). In the COI tree (Fig. 3) M. lichenoides was sister to M. sphaericum and M. erubescens 

with strong support in the Bayesian analysis (PP=0.97), though this node was not supported 

in the ML analysis (BS&amp;lt;50%).  

 Lithothamnion spp. E and F show a close relationship with Lithothamnion spp. 

LBC0642 in both the psbA and COI trees (Figs. 2 and 3) and comprise a lineage that is well 

supported in both Bayesian (psbA  PP=.98, COI PP= .94) and ML analyses (psbA, BS=80%, 

COI, BS=94%). In the psbA tree this lineage comprises a clade at the base of the 

253 



 

Hapalidiales. However, the branching pattern is quite different in the COI tree, with this 

clade comprising a lineage sister to L. corallioides. Taking into account the results of the 

pairwise distance distribution analysis (Fig. 5), this may be a result of psbA being more 

conserved than COI, considering studies in other taxonomic groups have shown conserved 

genes lead to paraphyletic relationships and unresolved phylogenies (Maia et al. 2012, 

Givnish et al. 2011). The close relationship between Lithothamnion sp. G and L. corallioides 

is intriguing and psbA sequences of L. coralloides varied from the psbA sequence of 

Lithothamnion sp. G by only 2.1%. Lithothamnion sp. G and L. coralloides are nested within 

a larger group of Lithothamnion spp., including L. glaciale Kjellman, the psbA sequences of 

which have been corroborated by comparisons to the holotype specimen (Adey et al. 2015). 

 The COI tree revealed that the COI sequence of Lithothamnion sp. H (LAF6970C), 

collected from 69m depth in the SEGMx, is 100% identical to the COI sequence of a 

specimen (“Species 5 PC0144250”) collected from a deep depth (110m) offshore 

Guadeloupe, F.W.I investigated in Peña et al. (2014). In the COI tree (Fig. 3) and 

concatenated gene tree (Fig. 4) these two specimens are sister to other Lithothamnion spp., 

including L. glaciale and L. corallioides.  

 The close relationship between specimens of Lithothamnion sp. I and J and specimen 

E58 is noteworthy, as this lineage received full support in both Bayesian and ML analyses. 

Though UPA sequences of specimens of Lithothamnion sp. I from the GMx and Brazil were 

identical (Fig. 1, Table S1), considerable distance was observed in both the psbA and COI 

datasets (Figs. 2, 3, Tables S2, 3).  PsbA and COI sequences of specimens from the GMx 

varied from the specimens from Brazil by 0.35-0.58% and 2.6% respectively. ABGD 

analyses for both psbA and COI delimited the specimens from the GMx and Brazil as being 

254 



 

conspecific whereas GMYC analyses for both markers delimited the specimens from the 

GMx as being a species separate from the specimens from Brazil. These results indicate that 

the specimens comprising Lithothamnion sp. I may represent a single species, separate 

species or separate entities below the rank of species, though additional samples from other 

localities are needed to examine the range of DNA sequence variation in this clade and 

neighboring clades. The close relationship between Lithothamnion sp. J and the unidentified 

Hapalidiaceae sp. E58 (Hernández-Kantún et al. 2015) is intriguing considering Hernández-

Kantún et al. (2015) showed that the specimen E58 possessed “flared” epithallial cells. 

Phymatolithon calcareum (Pallas) Adey &amp;amp;McKibbin recently has been clarified by DNA 

comparisons with its neotype specimen (Peña et al. 2014a, Hernández-Kantún et al. 2015, 

Woelkerling &amp;amp; Irvine, 1986). The close relationship between the sequences of specimens 

comprising Lithothamnion spp. I, J, Hapalidiaceae sp. E58 and Phymatolithon calcareum - 

the generitype species of Phymatolithon Foslie (Woelkerling &amp;amp; Irvine, 1986) - indicates 

further studies of these taxa are necessary to resolve the evolutionary relationships between 

these two genera. Results of the psbA analysis (Fig. 2) are similar to the results of the psbA 

analysis presented by Hernández-Kantún et al. (2015) (see fig. 2. p. 53) with regards to the 

relationship between Lithothamnion spp., Phymatolithon calcareum, and Hapalidiaceae sp. 

E58. 

 Results of the phylogenetic and barcoding analyses, as well as the ABGD and GMYC 

species delimitation analyses, indicate that the newly generated sequences in this study 

represent at least ten species, with eight being present in the GMx. These results show that 

there are more species corresponding to the genus Lithothamnion than there are available 

names for this genus in the GMx. Lithothamnion sp. C, G, F, and I, which are all collected 

255 



 

from deepwater, unlikely conform to the species concept of L. occidentale (Foslie) Foslie, 

described from Cruz Bay, St. John Island, US Virgin Islands, and reported for the Gulf of 

Mexico (Dawes 1974, Fredericq et al. 2009, Mateo Cid et al. 2014). Images of the holotype 

specimen fragment of L. occidentale (sweetgum.nybg.org) show that the specimen possess a 

different habit, which does not have a spherical/round shape with many protuberances 

growing from all sides of this specimen, and instead appears to consist of two branched 

branches which appear to be growing erect and attached to a central branch. DNA 

sequencing needs to be performed on the type specimen of L. occidentale and the morpho-

anatomy of the specimen needs to be examined carefully before this species epithet can be 

assigned with confidence to any of the specimens examined.  

 L. crispatum, reported by Mateo-Cid et al. (2014) from the Atlantic Coast of Mexico 

in the SWGMx, may correspond to Lithothamnion spp. F, I, and J in this study. The habit of 

Lithothamnion sp. F (LAF6882) from Campeche Banks, Mexico, is similar in habit to 

specimens identified as L. crispatum studied by Mateo-Cid et al. (2014), including specimens 

collected on the same expedition to Campeche Banks. However, the psbA sequence of a 

specimen collected in the Mediterranean Sea, Spain, identified as L. cf. crispatum (Peña et al. 

2014) and the psbA sequences of the taxon identified as L. crispatum (Nelson et al. 2014, 

Smith et al. 2012) appear distantly related and are not conspecific with any of the newly 

sequenced taxa presented in this study. DNA sequencing of the lectotype specimen of L. 

crispatum, originally collected from the Adriatic Sea and housed in the Rijksherbarium (L) in 

Leiden, Netherlands (Basso et al. 2011), needs to be performed before this name can be 

applied with confidence to specimens from the GMx.  

256 



 

 Minnery (1990) reported three species of Lithothamnion for the Flower Garden 

Banks, including two unnamed species and one reported as ‘L. sejunctum?’. Lithothamnion 

sejunctum (type locality: U.S. Virgin Islands), reported by Taylor (1960) to be epilithic and 

encrusting, may correspond to Lithothamnion spp. A, B, or E. Lithothamnion sp. B, specimen 

LAF6957B from Sackett Bank, possesses lobed, white margins, a character reported for L. 

sejunctum (Taylor, 1960), but it also has a loosely adherent crust, which is in contrast to 

Taylor’s description of L. sejunctum as “strongly adherent” (Taylor 1960, p. 381). 

Lithothamnion spp. A, E possess strongly adherent crusts but do not possess lobed margins. 

DNA sequencing of the type specimen of L. sejunctum collected by Børgesen from St. Croix, 

U.S. Virgin Islands, and housed at TRH (Woelkerling et al. 2005), will help clarify if this 

species corresponds to specimens in the current study. 

 Lithothamnion ruptile (Foslie) Foslie, whose type locality is the Dominican Republic 

(Woelkerling et al. 2005) and which is also reported for the Virgin Islands is described as 

having an encrusting morphology (Taylor 1960). This species may correspond to the 

encrusting specimens Lithothamnion spp. A, B, or E. Interestingly, the specimen identified as 

L. cf. ruptile is closely related to Lithothamnion sp. A, and included in this lineage is 

Lithothamnion sp. B. However, both ABGD and GMYC analyses indicate that the psbA 

sequence of L. cf. ruptile is not conspecific with Lithothamnion sp. A or B, nor is it 

conspecific with any other taxon in the psbA tree. DNA sequencing of the holotype specimen 

of L. ruptile (basionym: Lithothamnion syntrophicum f. ruptile), collected by Bock and 

housed at TRH (Woelkerling et al. 2005), may help clarify if any of the specimens in the 

current study correspond to L. ruptile. 

257 



 

 More recently, Athanasiadis &amp;amp; Ballantine (2011) described a new shallow water 

species of Lithothamnion from the Caribbean, L. carpoklonium. This species, which 

possesses a crustose morphology and also bears protuberances, is similar in habit to 

Lithothamnion sp. B. However, L. carpoklonium was discovered growing on mangrove prop 

roots, whereas Lithothamnion sp. B was found encrusting a bivalve shell from deepwater. 

Peña et al. (2014) noted that DNA sequencing of the holotype specimen of L. carpoklonium 

may help clarify the application of species names in the Caribbean. The holotype collection 

of L. carpoklonium is a contemporary collection housed at MSM and includes air-dried 

tetrasporangial and gametangial specimens (Athanasiadis &amp;amp; Ballantine 2011). Sequencing, 

and sequences generated from these specimens may help clarify if this specific epithet can be 

applied to specimens from the GMx.   

 The close relationship between specimens from the GMx and the specimens from 

Brazil (Lithothamnion sp. I, Lithothamnion sp. A and FLOR14925/FLOR14926) indicates 

that names applied to taxa from areas in or near Brazilian waters should also be considered 

for the specimens collected throughout the GMx. Surface views of the epithallial cells and of 

multiporate conceptacles (which show depressions around each pore) of Lithothamnion sp. A 

(LAF6549) are similar to the SEM images of a specimen identified as L. crispatum from the 

northeastern coast of Brazil (Costa et al. 2014, see p. 146, figs. 9D, G, H), and surface views 

of the epithallial cells are also similar to SEM images of a specimen identified as L. 

brasiliense Foslie (Costa et al. 2014, p. 148 fig. 10C). DNA sequencing of L. brasiliense, 

collected from São Sebastiao, Brazil and housed at TRH (Woelkerling et al. 2005) may help 

clarify if this species is related to taxa from the GMx. Mariath et al. (2012) recently 

described a protuberant crustose species from Bahia, Brazil which grows in shallow water on 

258 



 

corals, Lithothamnion steneckii Mariath and Figueiredo. This specimen also shows the habit 

of Lithothamnion sp. B. DNA sequencing of the holotype specimen of L. steneckii is not 

ideal due formalin preservation (Mariath et al. 2012); however, DNA sequencing of topotype 

collections may be an informative alternative. 

 Terminology referring to the type of epithallial cells considered diagnostic of the 

genus Lithothamnion has been used inconsistently in coralline literature. These cells have 

been referred to as being “angular” (Woelkerling 1983, Johansen 1976), “flattened and 

flared” (Woelkerling, 1988), “eared” (Johansen, 1976, Johansen 1981) and “armored” (Adey 

et al. 2015). Adey (1966, p. 364) presented excellent illustrations of Lithothamnion (as 

Lithothamnium) epithallial cells and described that the uppermost portion of the lateral cell 

walls “tend to flare-out” (Adey, 1966 p. 329). The term “flared” appears to be used most 

widely in modern coralline literature (Peña et al. 2014, Oliveira-Costa et al. 2014, Mariath et 

al. 2012, Robinson et al. 2013) though not exclusively (Adey et al. 2015). Using 

transmission electron microscopy, Wegeberg &amp;amp; Pueschel (2002) corroborated the work of 

Adey (1966) showing that the “flared” appearance of epithallial cells in Lithothamnion spp. 

is the result of the trapezoidal shape of the epithallial cell lumen (p. 230-36, figs.1-13), 

formed in part by the very thick lateral and proximal cell walls, the lateral walls becoming 

thinner near the distal end of the cell. Wegeberg &amp;amp; Pueschel (2002) also showed that the 

epithallial cell roof possesses a primary pit connection and consists of a cross wall with two 

layers, one being the layer of the distal end of the intact epithallial cell and the other layer 

being a remnant of the proximal end of the previously sloughed epithallial cell.  

 Using SEM and illustrations based on light microscopy observations, Adey et al. 

(2005) documented epithallial cell morphology in three species of Lithothamnion, showing 

259 



 

high magnification images and providing excellent illustrations of L. tophiforme, L. 

lemoineae, and L. glaciale. The epithallial cell roof is sometimes absent in published SEM 

images of Lithothamnion spp. (Adey et al. 2005, p.1016, fig. 7C, Robinson et al. 2013 p.66 

fig. 3B, left arrowhead) but may remain intact (Robinson et al. 2013 p.66 fig. 3B, right, 

arrowhead) or remain intact but collapses into the cell lumen (Basso et al. 2011, p. 148, fig. 

12). Adey recently avoided using the term flared in morphological descriptions, and 

described the epithallial cells as “armored” (with heavy calcification and thick walls). Adey 

et al. (2005) also showed that epithallial cells of Lithothamnion glaciale do not show a 

pronounced trapezoidal shape in sections (p. 1014, fig. 4).   

 Surface and section views of epithallial cells of Lithothamnion sp. A (LAF6549), 

Lithothamnion sp. F (LAF6882), and Lithothamnion sp. H (LAF6548) resemble SEM images 

and illustrations of L. glaciale (Adey et al. 2005) and surface and section views 

Lithothamnion sp. G (LAF6548) resembles images and illustrations of L. lemoineae (Adey et 

al. 2005). Images of epithallial cells of Lithothamnion sp. C, I, and J correspond to 

decalcified sections of the lectotype of Lithothamnion crispatum (Basso et al. 2011) viewed 

with light microscopy and resemble SEM images of epithallial cells of specimens identified 

as L. crispatum by Basso et al. (2011). Lithothamnion sp. B, C, I, and J are also similar to 

images and illustrations of L. tophiforme (Adey et al. 2005). Images of Lithothamnion sp. D 

(Fig. 10) indicate epithallial cells are very short with a roof that collapses into the lumen of 

the cell. Desiccation during preservation in silica gel may play a role in the collapsing of the 

epithallial cell roof. Epithallial cells in Lithothamnion sp. D also appear to be covered in 

mucilage or a cuticle. Other groups of coralline algae have been reported to have epithallial 

cells that “secrete cuticular material” (Johansen 1981, p. 31). Completely intact epithallial 

260 



 

cells in Lithothamnion sp. E appear to be absent, with images showing only the calcified 

proximal cell walls with some portions of the lateral walls remaining and with primary pit 

connections in the center. Images of epithallial cells of Lithothamnion sp. H (LAF6970C) are 

quite unique (Fig. 14), showing epithallial cells possess proximal and lateral walls which are 

very heavily calcified, accounting for more than half of the volume of the cell. Cell lumens 

are small and round and epithallial cell roofs are thin and weakly calcified with a primary pit 

connection in the center. Images of this species are shown in Peña et al. (2014, p. 206 fig. 

9D) and the epithallial cells are reported as being “flared” in the figure legend (p. 205) but 

further described as having “somewhat flared outermost cell walls” (p. 205). The images lack 

proper contrast to show the primary pit connections in the epithallial cell roofs, however, the 

small circular epithallial cell roof can be seen in surface view and a single cell (second from 

the right, left of the cell indicated by the arrow) shows the small round lumen possessed by 

this species. The newly generated images of this species presented in the study indicate that 

referring to these unique epithallial cells as “flared” does not adequately describe their 

structure.  

 Krayesky-Self et al. (2016) analyzed the elemental composition of three specimens 

investigated in this study. Images of specimens LAF1437, Lithothamnion sp. I (Fig. 16) and 

PHYKOS7249, Lithothamnion sp. J (Fig. 18) illustrate the infill of needle-like crystals in 

empty, overgrown conceptacles, which was confirmed with analyses of SEM-EDS (energy 

dispersive spectrometry) and x-ray diffraction data by Krayesky-Self et al. (2016) to be 

aragonite. Alexandersson (1974) documented two forms of “aragonite cement” (i.e. aragonite 

infill) in empty conceptacles of specimens identified as Lithothamnion glaciale from the 

North Sea and referred to these forms as “aragonite needles” (see Alexandersson 1974, fig. 

261 



 

7A, 8D-F) and “aragonite spherulitic cement” (see Alexandersson 1974, fig. 7C). Specimen 

PHYKOS 7249 possesses both of these forms of aragonite (Figs. 6F-H), including a 

spectrum of sizes and morphology of aragonite needles which correspond to the sizes and 

descriptions documented by Alexandersson. Alexandersson also documented the presence of 

small, centripetally formed calcium carbonate crystals in individual cells of Lithothamnion. 

Likewise, such small, centripetally formed calcium carbonate crystals of uncertain elemental 

composition were also observed within individual cells (Figs. 8, 17). Secondary mineral infill 

appears to be a common occurrence in specimens from the GMx, and putative aragonite infill 

is shown in several other specimens in the present study (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14). This 

phenomenon has been speculated to be associated with the development of newly formed 

hypothallial filaments which grow over empty conceptacles (Krayesky-Self et al. 2016), 

which is a common development pattern in specimens investigated in the present study. 

Alexanderson (1974) speculated that formation of mineral infill in Lithothamnion specimens 

from the North Sea is associated with the metabolic activity of the living coralline alga and 

noted that dissolution of minerals within the thallus occurs if the living outer layer of the 

rhodolith dies.  

 L. carpoklonium also has protuberances comprised of overlapping conceptacles. 

However, the structure of protuberances in L. carpoklonium, which are comprised of newly 

formed conceptacles directly overlapping the conceptacles below with little vegetative 

growth in between (see p. 408, figs. 20-21, Athanasiadis &amp;amp; Ballantine, 2011), appears to 

differ from specimens from the GMx.   

 Krayesky-Self et al. (2016) also determined that no significantly detectable amount of 

aragonite was present in the thallus of LAF6521. Here, we show that the lack of aragonite 

262 



 

corresponds with a lack of empty, overgrown conceptacles embedded within the 

protuberances, and that protuberances consisted primarily of vegetative filaments. Specimen 

LAF6521, which was collected on 16.xi.2012, may have been among those rhodoliths living 

in the Gulf during and in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill event. Considering 

the fact that many rhodolith specimens observed in the field following the Deepwater 

Horizon oil spill were bleached and denuded of associated macroalgae (Fredericq et al. 2014, 

Felder et al. 2014), it can be speculated that this specimen may have been bleached after the 

spill as well. The development of the new growth layer “erupting” out of the perithallus of 

the older growth layer, which apparently began below the intercalary meristem, may 

represent a strategy that allows for vegetative regeneration following a natural disaster and 

bleaching of the intercalary meristem. However, as this phenomenon was observed only in 

this specimen, this is only speculative at this point. 

 The morphology of the intercalary meristematic cells has been reported to be one of 

the defining characters of the genus Lithothamnion, and is reported to be “as long or longer 

than their immediate inward derivatives” (Woelkering 1988, p. 171). In this study, cells 

confidently identified as meristematic cells were indeed usually as long or longer than the 

inward perithallial cells (Figs. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18). In some locations of certain 

specimens, cells that were proximal to surface cells appeared to be pairs of recently divided 

meristematic cells (Figs. 9, 10, 14, 17, 18), prior to elongation of either resulting cell. In 

other specimens meristematic cells could not be identified with confidence (Figs. 6, 7, 11).  

 Peña et al. (2014) reported that specimens investigated in their study of Caribbean 

specimens identified as Lithothamnion spp. (Fig. 2, 3) did not have meristematic cells that fit 

the description of being “as long or longer than their inward derivatives” and that the putative 

263 



 

meristematic cells were often shorter than the inward derivatives. Peña et al. (2014) 

attributed this to a possible “active cell division process in the subepithallial initials” (i.e. 

meristematic cells). Meristematic cells which are approximately the same size as the inward 

derivatives were also reported by Athanasiadis &amp;amp; Ballantine (2011) in L. carpoklonium. 

Intercalary meristematic cells are thought to divide in one of two ways; the meristematic cell 

can divide to form a proximal cell of the perithallus, with the resulting distal cell remaining 

meristematic, or the meristematic cell can divide to form a small epithallial cell distally, with 

the proximal cell remaining meristematic (Johansen 1981). However, due to the inherent 

difficulties of conducting microscopy on calcified specimens and the differences in the 

resulting images of calcified and decalcified specimens, and also considering the current lack 

of method for viewing cell division in real time, it could be speculated that different 

meristematic developmental patterns may occur and have gone unreported. Perhaps 

meristematic cells may divide, with the proximal cell remaining meristematic, while the 

distal cell also remains meristematic, dividing again without elongation, forming very small, 

flattened epithallial cells such as the cells illustrated in the current study (Figs. 7, 9, 10) and 

in Peña et al. (2014). Apart from members of the Corallinophycidae, the only other red algal 

group which possesses an intercalary meristem is the family Delesseriaceae (Ceramiales). 

Members of the Delesseriaceae possess sophisticated development at sites of intercalary 

meristematic activity, sometimes involving complex branching patterns which vary between 

groups (Jeong et al. 2016, Lin et al. 2015, Wynne 2014). Complex intercalary meristematic 

activity may also be possible in the Corallinophycidae and intercalary branching could be 

involved. Integrated studies involving multiple types of microscopy conducted on both 

264 



 

calcified and uncalcified specimens may elucidate the developmental pattern of meristematic 

activity in the Corallinophycidae.

Conclusões gerais 

? Baseados nos dados obtidos neste estudo, considerando a informatividade e a 

relação custo-benefício, os marcadores mais adequados para serem utilizados em 

estudos mais abrangentes das CCA são o psbA, o COI-5P, seguido do rbcL-3P. 

? Poucas sequências geradas neste estudo corresponderam a sequências 

disponíveis nos bancos de dados públicos, o que sugere que possivelmente 

algumas das espécies estudadas são potencialmente novas para a ciência, ou 

pertencem a espécies descritas para os quais não existem sequências disponíveis. 

Assim, este estudo contribuirá significativa para o enriquecimento dos bancos de 

dados para estas algas, especialmente considerando o Atlântico Sul, para onde 

poucas sequências estão disponíveis. 

? Nossos resultados demonstraram que a diversidade de CCA no Brasil estava 

subestimada, principalmente para as Hapalidiales. Antes deste estudo, haviam 

32 espécies CCA entre Corallinales e Hapalidiales referidas para a costa 

brasileira; apenas 10 baseadas em dados moleculares. Após este estudo, foram 

gerados dados moleculares para pelo menos 34 diferentes espécies pertencentes 

às ordens Corallinales e Hapalidiales.  

? Antes deste estudo, haviam 21 espécies referidas para Brasil pertencentes à 

ordem Corallinales, apenas seis para as quais dados moleculares foram gerados; 

neste estudo foram gerados dados moleculares para 19 espécies diferentes desta 

ordem.  

? Para as Hapalidiales, haviam sido referidas 11 espécies para a costa brasileira, 

apenas quatro para as quais dados moleculares foram gerados; neste estudo, 

foram gerados dados moleculares para ao menos 16 espécies diferentes desta 

ordem. 

314 



? Os caracteres morfológicos e anatômicos observados serão valiosos para estudos 

posteriores, servindo de base para comparação. 

? Não foi possível elencar caracteres morfológicos e anatômicos de maior ou 

menor relevância na maioria dos espécimes analisados, principalmente por se 

tratar de um conjunto de amostras de diversos gêneros diferentes. 

? Para a ordem Sporolithales, abordada no capítulo 2, sete espécies haviam sido 

citadas para a costa brasileira, três delas foram propostas nos últimos dois anos, 

sendo duas delas baseadas em dados moleculares. Após este estudo, foram 

propostas duas novas espécies para a ciência e, portanto, nove espécies desta 

ordem passarão a ser reconhecidas para o Brasil, após a publicação do trabalho 

submetido (cap. 2). Todas as espécies antes citadas foram referidas para o 

infralitoral em profundidades de 25 até 85 m, as duas espécies propostas no 

capítulo 2 são especíes encontradas no mesolitoral ou em profudindades até 15 

metros. 

? O uso de ferramentas moleculares, como a técnica de DNA barcoding, é 

fundamental e abre uma nova perspectiva para os estudos da diversidade das 

CCA, especialmente considerando as técnicas e preparações complexas e 

demoradas necessárias para estudar adequadamente a anatomia deste grupo. 

? Alguns dos nossos espécimes parecem estar estreitamente relacionados com 

espécies do Indo-Pacífico. Serão necessários mais estudos, que utilizem 

diferentes marcadores, para entender esta relação entre a flora do Atlântico e do 

Indo-Pacífico. 

? Alguns dos nossos espécimes estão estreitamente relacionados com espécies do 

infralitoral do Golfo do México, o que nos indica que os nomes aplicados à 

315 



táxons da costa brasileira devem ser considerados como possíveis epítetos para 

os espécimes desta localidade; e vice-versa. 

? No capítulo 3 tratamos da diversidade molecular, morfológica e anatômica das 

espécies de Lithothamnion encontradas no Golfo do México e no Brasil e 

mostramos que de fato o gênero é polifilético e nessas regiões está dividido em 

dois grandes clados. Ainda neste capítulo discutimos a hipótese de que as 

Corallinophycideae podem apresentar crescimento através da divisão de células 

de um meristema intercalar, porém estudos envolvendo outras técnicas de 

microscopia serão necessários para elucidar o padrão de desenvolvimento da 

atividade meristemática na nesta sub-classe.  

? Considerando as três ordens de CCA (Corallinales, Hapalidiales e 

Sporolithales), este estudo representa a primeira tentativa de desvendar de forma 

mais ampla a diversidade de espécies CCA encontradas ao longo da costa 

brasileira, utilizando dados moleculares.
