ABSTRACT 

 
FERREIRA, Gabriel William Dias, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, January, 
2017. Harvest residues management and silvicultural operations impact on soil 
physical and organic matter quality of eucalypt plantations. Adviser: Emanuelle 
Mercês Barros Soares. Co-adviser: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva.    
 

Brazil is among the world’s largest timber producers and Eucalyptus planted forests are 

responsible for a significant portion of wood products supply. Furthermore, these forests 

play an important role on mitigation of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases. The 

period between harvesting and new rotation establishment, i.e. its first two or three years, 

concentrates the major part of forest mechanical operations that may define achievable 

productivity while causing harmful impacts on soil physical and organic properties. This 

thesis is divided in three chapters that evaluated and tried to provide a better 

understanding of these operations impact on eucalypt forest dynamics and soil properties. 

The first chapter approached how the management of eucalypt harvest residues (HR) 

could alter its decomposition pattern and the dynamics of two soil organic matter (SOM) 

fractions (Particulate Organic Matter – POM, and Associated to Minerals – MAOM). The 

experiment was set up in an area where natural grasslands of Pampa Biome in the Rio 

Grande do Sul State, Brazil, have been recently converted to eucalypt forests. Removal 

of all residues (-R), only bark removal (-B) and maintenance of all residues (+B), all of 

them combined with external 200 kg ha-1 of N addition (+N) or not (-N), were simulated 

in PVC micro-plots in a 3x2 full factorial with 4 replications. A 10 % 15N-enriched 

solution was used as N source to track the role of mineral-N in the process. Whole micro-

plots were sampled at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 mo. after experiment establishment and taken to 

the lab for further analysis. All sampling times were used to build decomposition curve, 

while C, ?13C, N and 15N content associated with both SOM fractions were determined 

on 36 mo. samples in 0 -1 and 1 -5 cm soil layers. In these same layers, SOM fractions 

from 12 and 36 mo. samples were characterized with Pyrolysis associated with Gas 

Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to obtain a better understanding of 

SOM formation pathway under different HR management. Almost 80 % of HR have been 

decomposed until 3 yr. Bark (p&lt;0.05) and mineral-N (p=0.06) presence slowed down 

decomposition. Overall, changes in C and N content and ?13C due to residues presence 

were more expressive in 0-1 cm layer and POM fraction. +B tended to increase HR 

contribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Mineral-N fraction 

was always higher when HR were present, particularly in +B treatments, but its 



viii 

 

contribution to SOM fractions was always smaller than 4 %. Py-GC/MS products 

revealed a direct role of HR on POM formation, but their effect on MAOM seems to be 

indirect by altering microbial composition and its products. In summary, we showed how 

HR management drives SOM fractions chemistry and we conclude that a sustainable 

management of HR can enhance soil C accrual. In the second chapter was evaluated how 

two different harvest systems would change soil physical properties, soil C content and 

soil CO2 efflux, and initial tree growth under two different silvicultural system. To this 

end, two adjacent stands located in Estrela do Sul/MG were selected. Each stand was 

harvested and logged with a different system (Feller + Forwarder – F+F; and Feller + 

Skidder – F+S) and soil physical properties [Soil Bulk Density (Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro 

(Ma) and Total Porosity (TP), and Penetration Resistance (PR)], SOM properties [Labile-

C, C associated with Particulate (C-POM) and Mineral (C-MAOM) fractions] soil CO2 

efflux and stump mortality rate, were assessed after harvesting operations and compared 

with reference (before harvesting). Afterwards, each stand was divided in coppice and 

replanting, and we followed soil CO2 efflux after planting and one year after planting, 

when trees height (H) and SOM properties were also measured in both areas and system 

to evaluate how areas would recover from harvesting impacts. All soil variables were 

assessed at planting and inter-planting row positions. Both systems affected soil density 

and soil pore configuration, but in different ways. F+F concentrates traffic at inter-

planting row position, and therefore causes a slightly higher compaction in this region, 

while F+S does not follow traffic routes and impacts planting-row similarly, resulting in 

higher stump mortality. Harvesting operations increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma 

and TP at all layers. Soil CO2 efflux was not affected by harvesting operations. 

Differences in soil CO2 were found after planting, when it was higher in F+S system, that 

also presented higher labile-C and C-POM. One year after planting, mortality rate was 

still higher under coppice in F+S system, that also presented lower trees. In turn, trees 

were higher in replanting in this area. Soil respiration behaved similarly, i.e., higher in 

F+F under coppice and lower under replanting. Overall, after one year coppice system 

presented higher Labile-C, C-POM and C-MAOM. We concluded that each harvest 

system affects row and inter-row differently, creating different soil functional zones 

inside same area, that might be enhanced by the next silvicultural system chosen, and 

should be observed when assessing ecosystem services and site condition. Lastly, the 

third chapter evaluated the effect of land use change from natural grasslands of Pampa 

Biome to eucalypt plantations, as well as N fertilization effects on initial eucalypt growth, 

fine-root biomass (FRB) and its spatial distribution, and C, ?13C and N content associated 



ix 

 

with SOM fractions (POM and MAOM). 4 N-levels were tested (24, 36, 48 e 108 kg ha-

1 of N) on initial tree growth (until 2 yr.). Afterwards, representative trees were chosen to 

evaluate FRB until 40 cm depth, and soil samples also until 40 cm depth were collected 

for SOM evaluation. Positive effect of N on tree growth (diameter and height) was seen 

initially after fertilization, i.e., 1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. N effects were seen only at trees 

height. The FRB fitted regression showed increase of FRB until 56 kg ha-1 of N, and after 

that level a decrease in FRB was observed, and the highest N level used resulted in the 

lowest FRB. Both horizontal and vertical anisotropy in fine-root distribution were 

observed, and besides differences among N levels, we could not see a clear relation 

between N fertilization and fine-root spatial distribution. Overall, land use change to 

eucalypt plantations increased soil C content, particularly in top-soil layers. 36 kg ha-1 

resulted in higher C-POM in 0 -10, while 48 kg ha-1 resulted in higher C-MAOM in this 

layer. C and N dynamics were tightly correlated, especially in MAOM fraction. C-POM 

was positively correlated with FRB. Tillage had a strong control on soil C and N stocks, 

enhancing C deposition and turnover at row (ridge) region, most likely for favoring roots 

development in this region. Therefore, it is shown that N fertilization may alter initial tree 

growth, but its effects don’t seem to last longer. Nevertheless, N effects can be reflected 

on fine-root biomass and distribution and C and N of SOM fractions. We hope that our 

findings could guide the adoption of proper management practices in eucalypt plantations 

in Brazil, enhancing the productivity and sustainability of these forests.

RESUMO 

 
FERREIRA, Gabriel William Dias, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, janeiro de 
2017. Impacto do manejo dos resíduos da colheita e de operações silviculturais sobre 
a qualidade física e da matéria orgânica do solo em plantações de eucalipto. 
Orientador: Emanuelle Mercês Barros Soares. Coorientador: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva.    
 

O Brasil é um dos maiores produtores mundiais de madeira e plantações de eucalipto são 

responsáveis por boa parte do suprimento dos produtos madeireiros no país. Além disso, 

essas plantações desempenham papel importante na mitigação do aumento dos gases de 

efeito estufa na atmosfera. No período compreendido entre a colheita de um ciclo e o 

estabelecimento de uma nova rotação, ou seja, os seus primeiros dois ou três anos, se 

concentra a maior parte das operações florestais, que podem definir o sucesso do 

povoamento e ao mesmo tempo causar impactos negativos em propriedades físicas e 

orgânicas do solo. Esta tese, dividida em três capítulos, teve como objetivo avaliar o 

impacto dessas operações sobre a dinâmica das florestas de eucalipto e propriedades do 

solo. No primeiro capítulo foi abordado como o manejo dos resíduos da colheita do 

eucalipto pode alterar a sua decomposição e a dinâmica de duas frações (Matéria Orgânica 

Particulada – MOP e Associada aos Minerais – MAM) da matéria orgânica do solo 

(MOS). O experimento foi conduzido em área onde pastagens naturais do Pampa Gaúcho 

foram recentemente convertidas em plantios de eucalipto. Foram simuladas a remoção 

total dos resíduos (-R), a remoção apenas da casca (-B) e a manutenção total dos resíduos 

(+B), combinados (+N) ou não (-N) com a adição de 200 kg ha-1 de N mineral, em um 

fatorial 3x2 completo com 4 repetições. Uma solução enriquecida em 10 % com 15N foi 

utilizada como fonte de N para traçar o N mineral em todo o processo. Aos 0, 3, 6, 12 e 

36 meses após a instalação amostras dos resíduos e do solo foram coletadas e levadas ao 

laboratório. Dados de todos os tempos foram utilizados para construir a curva de 

decomposição dos resíduos, enquanto que os teores de C, ?13C, N e ?15N associados às 

duas frações da MOS foram determinados no último tempo nas camadas de 0 -1 e 1 -5 

cm do solo. Nessas mesmas camadas, as frações da MOS dos solos de 12 e 36 meses 

foram submetidas à pirolise associada com cromatografia gasosa e espectrometria de 

massa (Pi-CG/EM) para caracterização química e tentativa de melhor entendimento sobre 

os processos de formação da MOS sob os diferentes manejos de resíduos. Ao final dos 

três anos, cerca de 80 % de todo o resíduo tinha sido decomposto. A presença da casca 

(p&lt;0,05) e do N-mineral (p=0,06) diminuíram a taxa de decomposição do resíduo. O 

efeito dos resíduos sobre o C e N das frações da MOS foram mais expressivos na fração 



xi 

 

particulada e camada de 0 -1 cm. Em geral, a presença dos resíduos aumentou os teores 

de C e N, e diminuiu os valores de ?13C, indicando contribuição dos resíduos para as 

frações da MOS. A contribuição dos resíduos é maior na presença da casca, especialmente 

nos tratamentos -N. A contribuição do N mineral para as frações da MOS foi inferior a 4 

%, mas foi sempre maior quando os resíduos estavam presentes. Os resultados da Pi-

CG/EM indicaram contribuição direta dos resíduos para a fração MOP, enquanto que a 

influencia na fração MAM parece ser indireta pela alteração da comunidade microbiana 

e seus produtos. Concluindo, foi mostrado como o manejo dos resíduos altera a 

composição da MOS e que a manutenção dos resíduos na área acarreta em aumento nos 

teores de C da MOS. No segundo capítulo, foi avaliado como dois sistemas diferentes de 

colheita de eucalipto alterariam propriedades físicas do solo, os teores de C e a emissão 

de CO2 pelo solo, bem como o crescimento inicial das árvores após a adoção de dois 

sistemas silviculturais distintos. Para isso, dois talhões adjacentes localizados em Estrela 

do Sul/MG foram selecionados. Cada talhão foi colhido com um sistema diferente (Feller 

e Forwarder - F+F, ou Feller e Skidder - F+S) e propriedades físicas [Densidade do Solo 

(Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro (Ma), Porosidade Total (PT) e Resistência à Penetração (RP)], 

orgânicas (C lábil, e C associado às frações MOP e MAM), emissão de CO2, e 

mortalidade das cepas foram avaliadas antes e depois da colheita. Posteriormente, cada 

área foi dividida em dois sistemas silviculturais: talhadia e alto-fuste (reforma), e a 

emissão de CO2 pelo solo, frações de C do solo e a altura das árvores foram analisados 

após um ano para avaliar como cada área se recuperaria dos impactos da colheita. Todas 

as avaliações foram feitas nas linhas e entrelinhas de plantio. Ambos os sistemas de 

colheita afetaram negativamente as propriedades físicas do solo, mas de maneira 

diferente. Enquanto F+F concentra o impacto nas entrelinhas, o sistema F+S não segue 

linhas de trafego pré-estabelecidas, causando maior compactação nas linhas de plantio e 

consequentemente maior mortalidade de cepas. A colheita aumentou Ds, Mi, RP e reduziu 

Ma e PT em todas as posições, sistemas e profundidade. A emissão de CO2 do solo não 

foi alterada pela colheita. Diferenças na emissão de CO2 só foram encontradas após o 

plantio, quando foi mais elevada no F+S em ambos sistemas silviculturais, e C lábil e C-

MOP também estavam mais elevados. Após um ano, a mortalidade ainda era maior no 

sistema F+S e altura menor no sistema de talhadia. Por outro lado, as árvores no F+S sob 

reforma eram mais altas. A respiração do solo apresentou padrão semelhante, ou seja, 

mais alta em área de talhadia no F+F e mais baixa nas áreas reformadas. C lábil, C-MOP 

e C-MAM foram significativamente mais altos nos sistemas de talhadia. Conclui-se que 

cada sistema de colheita afeta linha e entrelinha de plantio diferentemente, criando 



xii 

 

diferentes zonas no talhão, que podem ser exacerbadas com a adoção de diferentes 

sistemas silviculturais. Essas diferenças devem ser observadas quando são avaliados 

impactos sobre o solo. No terceiro capítulo foram avaliados o efeito da substituição de 

pastagens naturais do Pampa Gaúcho por plantios de eucalipto e o efeito da adubação 

nitrogenada sobre o crescimento inicial, a biomassa e distribuição espacial de raízes finas 

de eucalipto, e teores de C, ?13C e N associados às frações MOP e MAM da MOS. Foram 

testadas 4 doses de N (24, 36, 48 e 108 kg ha-1 de N) e o crescimento inicial das árvores 

foi avaliado até a idade de dois anos. Posteriormente, foram selecionadas árvores 

representativas que tiveram a biomassa de raízes finas (BRF) avaliadas até a profundidade 

de 40 cm, ao mesmo tempo em que se realizaram as avaliações da MOS também até 40 

cm. Efeitos positivos da adubação nitrogenada foram observados inicialmente sobre 

diâmetro e altura, mas aos dois anos apenas a altura foi positivamente influenciada. A 

regressão ajustada para a BRF indicou aumento da BRF até 56 kg ha-1 de N, sendo que 

após esse nível a BRF diminui e a maior dose de N testada resultou na menor BRF 

observada. Foi observada anisotropia na distribuição radicular horizontal e verticalmente 

e, apesar de diferenças entre as doses, não foi possível traçar uma relação clara entre as 

doses de N e a distribuição espacial de raízes finas. Em geral, a introdução de eucalipto 

elevou os teores de C do solo. Os efeitos foram maiores nas camadas superficiais. 36 kg 

ha-1 resultou nos maiores teores de C-MOP na camada 0 -10, enquanto que 48 kg ha-1 

resultou nos maiores C-MAM nessa camada. As dinâmicas de C e N apresentaram-se 

fortemente correlacionadas, especialmente na fração MAM. Os teores de C-MOP 

correlacionaram-se positivamente com BRF. O sistema de preparo do solo influencia os 

teores de C e N no solo, aumentando-os na linha de plantio, provavelmente por favorecer 

o desenvolvimento de raízes nessa região. Assim, verificou-se que a adição de N pode 

afetar positivamente o crescimento inicial do eucalipto, mas os efeitos não parecem ser 

duradouros. Por outro lado, o efeito do N parece ser observado por mais tempo sobre a 

biomassa de raízes finas e C e N das frações da MOS. Espera-se que os resultados 

encontrados na presente tese possam ser utilizados para nortear as práticas de manejo 

adotadas em plantios de eucalipto no Brasil, trazendo maior produtividade e 

sustentabilidade à essas florestas.

I. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

It is estimated that timber world market will increase 40 % in the next 35 years. 

Considering current productivity levels of Eucalyptus, the most planted genus worldwide, 

this expected growth would require additional planting of 210 million of hectares (IBÁ, 

2015). Brazil is among the world’s largest wood producers and presents the seventh 

biggest forest planted area in the world (Colodette et al., 2014). Planted forests are 

responsible for 91 % of industrial wood production in the country. Estimates point out 

that about 7.5 million hectares of Brazilian territory are occupied by planted forests, being 

72 % of those only by Eucalyptus genus (IBÁ, 2015). Although extensive, the area 

covered by planted forest covers only 0.9 % of national territory, which places the county 

in a highlighted position in future forecasts of the world wood chain supply. Moreover, 

the country already presents the world highest average productivity (~ 40 m3 ha-1 yr-1 for 

Eucalyptus plantations) (IBÁ, 2015). The great pressure in international agreements to 

preserve native forests and mitigate increasing greenhouse gases concentration in the 

atmosphere and climate change further enhances the importance of these forest 

plantations. 

Eucalypt forests are recognized as an efficient atmospheric CO2 sink, and 

reforestation is considered as a sustainable practice by the Clean Development 

Mechanism of Kyoto Protocol and fomented by the Low Carbon Emission Agricultural 

Plan (Plano ABC) of the Brazilian National Government. The recent adoption of 

minimum tillage technique follows similar principles of no-till systems adopted in 

agriculture, that have resulted in significant increases in soil carbon (C) stock (Diekow et 

al., 2005; Lal, 2004), plays in favor of planted forests. However, these forests ability to 

long-term store C is still questionable, since they are constantly managed to obtain high 

productivity in increasingly shorter rotations, and an elevated C and nutrient export occurs 

at every harvesting (~ 7-year average rotation). An alternative would be to increase C 

transference to the soil, a larger and more stable pool (Lal, 2005, 2004), particularly by 

keeping non-or-less commercial components in the field after harvesting, as they could 

account for up to 40 % of above-ground biomass at harvesting (Gatto et al., 2010).  

Nevertheless, reforestation effects on soil C are still not a consensus, and either 

increases or decreases on soil C stock have been observed due to several factors such as 

previous land use, edaphoclimatic conditions and management practices adopted (Cook 

et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Zinn et al., 2002). The lack of sensibility 

of total soil C concentration contributes to these divergences. Hence, the use of soil 



2 

 

organic matter (SOM) fractionation methods, isotopes and molecular techniques could 

bring new insights and provide a better understanding of SOM dynamics under eucalypt 

forests. 

The period between harvesting and new rotation establishment, i.e. its first two or 

three years, concentrates the major part of forest mechanical operations and could define 

achievable productivity while may cause harmful impacts on soil physical, chemical and 

biological properties. We highlight harvesting and logging, harvest residues management, 

silvicultural system choice and fertilization as main defining operations. Studies 

addressing these operations effects on SOM are still scarce, making uncertain the real and 

potential role of eucalypt forests to mitigate climate change. These uncertainties are 

greater in new forest expansion areas, particularly in the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, 

where expansion is occurring over natural grasslands of Pampa Biome, that is a fragile 

ecosystem that has a significant portion of its soil degraded due to inadequate 

management and excessive grazing (Pillar et al., 2012; Roesch et al., 2009). 

This thesis is divided in three chapters aiming at filling some of these gaps, 

providing a better understanding on management practices effects on eucalypt forests and 

SOM dynamics. The first chapter uses a decomposition experiment to address harvest 

residues management effects on dynamics of C and N of SOM fractions. We selected a 

site in Rio Grande do Sul State where Eucalyptus afforestation over natural grassland was 

just happening and simulated harvest residues managements practices. Therefore, natural 

differences between the 13C isotope signature of C3 (new, eucalypt) and C4 (old, 

grassland) plants could be used to quantify harvest residues contribution to SOM pools. 

We also took advantage of differences between SOM and harvest residues chemistry and 

used pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to characterize 

changes in SOM overtime and elucidate SOM formation pathways under different harvest 

residues managements. 

In the second chapter is studied how different harvest systems and afterwards 

different silvivultural systems would alter soil physical properties, soil CO2 emission, C 

content in different SOM fractions and initial tree growth. We selected two adjacent 

loamy-soil sites in Minas Gerais State to compare these different systems, as loamy soils 

are more prone to physical damage. The two stands were followed over the course of one 

year from harvesting to fertilization operations.  Lastly, the third chapter assesses the 

effect land use change from natural grassland of Pampa Biome to eucalypt forests by 

changes in SOM properties, and how nitrogen fertilization would affect initial tree 

growth, fine-root biomass and spatial distribution and SOM dynamics. Trees were 



3 

 

measured over the first two years, and early changes in SOM properties were evaluated 

by SOM fractionation in two pools with different turnover time and sensitivity to land 

use change, and C and N content, and the proportion of C-derived from eucalypt (C3) 

using isotope techniques, were determined in each SOM pool.

II. CHAPTER 1 
 

Eucalyptus harvest residue management enhances SOM accrual and alters 

chemistry of SOM fractions 

 
ABSTRACT 
 
Eucalyptus forests have been considered a key low-carbon land use, efficiently sinking 
atmospheric CO2. Its non-or-less-commercial components (Harvest residues – HR) can 
account for up to 40 % of the aboveground biomass at harvesting. Keeping HR in the 
field could enhance CO2 sequestration, especially if they could be transformed into stable 
forms of soil organic carbon (SOC). We collected samples from an experiment set up in 
a new frontier of Eucalyptus forest expansion in Southern Brazil and used micro-plots of 
PVC inserted 10 cm into the soil to assess the effect of simulated management practices 
[removal of all residues (-R), only bark removal (-B) and maintenance of all residues 
(+B), all of them combined with external nitrogen addition (+N) or not (-N)] on 
decomposition rate, carbon (C) transfer and C stabilization. A 10 % 15N-enriched solution 
was used as N source to track the role of mineral-N in the process. Whole micro-plots 
were sampled five times (0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 mo. after experiment establishment). At each 
time, residues were carefully separated from soil and soil samples were divided in 0 -1 
and 1 -5 cm soil layers for analysis. We assess HR management effects on soil organic 
matter (SOM) fractions [Particulate organic matter (POM) and Mineral-associated 
organic matter (MAOM)] by changes in C and N content and changes in the natural 
abundance of ?13C, as well as changes in soil fraction chemistry by Py-GC/MS. Almost 
80 % of HR have been decomposed until 3 yr. Bark (p&lt;0.05) and mineral-N (p=0.06) 
presence slowed down decomposition. HR had great impact on SOM properties after 3 
yr. of experiment. Changes in C content and ?13C were more expressive in 0-1 cm layer 
and POM fraction. Overall, HR presence increased C content and decreased ?13C values, 
indicating a higher fraction derived from HR in SOC. +B tended to increase HR 
contribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Changes in N content 
followed the same trend observed for C. Mineral-N fraction was always higher when HR 
were present, particularly in +B treatments, but its contribution to SOM fractions was 
always smaller than 4 %. Py-GC/MS products revealed a distinct formation pathway of 
SOM fractions. HR have a direct role on POM formation, but their effect on MAOM 
seems to be indirect by altering microbial composition and its products. Lignin 
disappeared in 3 yr. MAOM – 1 -5 samples, indicating that it’s not stable even associated 
with minerals and aboveground litter it’s not efficient to keep its content below top-soil 
layer. In summary, we showed how HR management drives SOM fractions chemistry and 
we conclude that a sustainable management of HR can enhance soil C accrual.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

Brazil is among the biggest pulp and sawn wood producers in the world. Planted 

forests cover more than 7.5 million hectares in the country and reduce the pressure over 

native forests, particularly the Amazon (IBÁ, 2015). With an average productivity of 40 

m3 ha-1 yr-1 in 7 yr. rotations, Eucalyptus plantations are the main responsible for wood 

production and occupy ~ 72 % of forest planted area (Colodette et al., 2014; IBÁ, 2015). 

Sustainable management of these forests usually relies on practices that maintain or 

increase soil organic matter (SOM) stocks, since it has a major role on nutrient dynamics 

in the tropics. Plants are the major carbon (C) source for SOM and particularly in these 

forests, litter, root turnover and harvest residues (HR) are the main inputs.  

Basically, HR are non-or-less-commercial components composed by leaves, 

branches and twigs, non-commercial stem (small diameter at thinner end) and bark. 

Around 30 t ha-1 of HR are generated in an average eucalypt rotation in Brazil (Gatto et 

al., 2010). Maintaining HR in the field has proven to provide several benefits on soil 

physical (Jesus et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2007) and chemical properties (Kumaraswamy et 

al., 2014; Laclau et al., 2010b; Mendham et al., 2003), and thus tree growth (Laclau et 

al., 2010a; Mendham et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016; Versini et al., 2013). HR impacts 

on SOM stocks, though, is still debated (Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016) 

and possible effects on SOM chemistry are even less studied (Mathers et al., 2003). 

Actually, studies addressing changes in SOM quality due to Eucalyptus plantations 

introduction are scarce (Sanderman et al., 2014; Santana et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2013). 

Several authors have tried to understand the pathway of SOM formation by litter 

input (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2015; Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2014; Hatton et 

al., 2015; Mambelli et al., 2011). The presence of more complex and lignified woody 

materials among HR components might change their decomposition pattern and therefore 

their role on C cycle (Bradford et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2016; Magnússon et al., 2016). 

Management practices like changes in HR mix and increasing nitrogen (N) fertilization 

aiming at higher productivity might also affect C dynamics (Berg and Matzner, 1997; 

Souza et al., 2016; Vivanco and Austin, 2011). Particularly, the possible interaction 

between lignified compounds and tannins of eucalypt HR with N requires further 

investigation (Knorr et al., 2005; Kraus et al., 2003). 

To understand the dynamics of transference from plant-litter to SOM, separate 

SOM into different functional pools is crucial. Physical fractionation is based on the 

premises that the association with finer mineral particles (silt and clay) play a key role on 



6 

 

the turnover and stability of SOM (Dungait et al., 2012; von Lützow et al., 2007). 

Particulate Organic Matter (POM), i.e. OM not associated with minerals, may be the entry 

of plant litter into SOM pool and is characterized for fast turnover time and low stability 

(Grandy et al., 2007; Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2014), although some authors recently have 

shown a direct flow of soluble components of litter to stable mineral associated pools 

(MAOM) (Cotrufo et al., 2015; Sanderman et al., 2014). MAOM, in turn, comprises the 

major part of SOM, where the protection against microbial accessibility and/or an organo-

mineral association grant stability to this pool. Whilst POM is formed basically by plant 

inputs (Grandy et al., 2007), microbial products dominate MAOM fraction and plant 

signal, even from recalcitrant compounds, is almost absent in this fraction (Grandy and 

Neff, 2008; Klotzbücher et al., 2016). We argue if this behavior would be the same with 

more lignified inputs like HR or could more lignified materials create a breakdown 

continuum and be stabilized into stable pools (Sanderman et al., 2014)? 

In this study, we tried to understand the fate of eucalypt HR on SOM dynamics. 

We took advantage of an experimental network set up across representative areas for 

eucalypt production (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). A unique site where 

Eucalyptus afforestation over natural grassland was just happening was selected, so 

natural differences in the 13C isotope signature of C3 (eucalypt) and C4 (grassland) plants 

could be used to quantify HR contribution to SOM pools. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-

mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to create a fingerprint of SOM fractions and 

assess similarities between them in a time sequence. Treatments were applied based on 

two hypotheses: (i) residues mix, particularly bark presence, would increase HR 

complexity and C stabilization; (ii) increasing nitrogen availability would alter C 

transference to more stabilized pools either by eliminating any possible constraint due to 

eucalypt HR low N content or by suppressing lignin decomposers activity. 

 

2.  MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
2.1. Site description 

 
Experiment was carried out in Southern Brazil (30°26’S; 54°31’W), in Rio 

Grande do Sul State, near Brazil-Uruguay border. We selected a representative site in a 

region that is considered a new frontier of Eucalyptus plantation in Brazil, where an 

expansion of these forests over natural grasslands of Pampa Biome has been occurring.  

The natural grassland (C4) of selected site was replaced by Eucalyptus (C3) planted forests 



7 

 

at the same time at experiment set up, so we could use and maximize differences in natural 

isotope signature and chemistry between fresh input (C3 harvest residues) and former 

SOM. Grassland was eliminated using a non-selective herbicide (glyphosate) and 

Eucalyptus dunnii seedlings were planted at 2.2 x 3.3 m spacing. 

Site is located in a sub-tropical climate area, with mean annual temperature 

(MAT) of 18 oC and annual rainfall of 1351 mm during experiment years (Data from 

Brazilian National Institute of Spatial Research – INPE – S. Gabriel/RS station, located 

at ~17 km away from experimental site at similar altitude). Soils from the region are 

formed from sedimentary material mainly composed by arenite, siltite and argillite 

(MAPA, 1973; Roesch et al., 2009). Soil site was classified as Inceptsol (U.S. 

Taxonomy), its main properties are shown in Table 1 and SOM characterization is 

presented in Table 2.

2.2. Experimental design 

 Harvest residues used in this experiment came from a commercial E. urograndis 

hybrid stand harvested at two-year age. These are the same residues used in an 

experimental network set up across representative sites in Brazil aiming at understanding 

decomposition processes of eucalypt harvest residues under different management 

practices and its effect on soil carbon and properties (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., 

2016). Trees were separated into leaves, branches, non-commercial stem, bark, and roots. 

Residues were dried at 45 oC in a forced draft oven, chopped in smaller pieces varying 

from 4 to 8 cm (leaves were left uncut) and dry stored until experiment set up. Proportions 

of each component used to represent harvest residue and its total composition were based 

on observations of harvested commercial plantations with a mean annual increment of 50 

m3 ha-1 yr-1 (Ferreira et al., 2016). 

 Micro-plots made by PVC tubes of 15 x 15 cm (diameter x height) were used to 

study HR decomposition and C transfer to the soil. Tubes were introduced 10 cm into the 

soil between planting rows. Six lateral holes (20-mm diameter) were made in the tube 

wall to allow fauna movement and water flow. Residues were placed on soil surface inside 

the tubes and then tubes were covered after treatment application with a 1-mm mesh net 

to avoid external litter input. The use of this type of micro-plot has been proved to be 

efficient to study decomposition, minimizing some problems found in litter bag studies 

such poor contact between litter and soil, fauna exclusion, stolen or lost bags, or higher 

previous processing and litter fragmentation (Ferreira et al., 2016; Powers et al., 2009; 

Shorohova and Kapitsa, 2014; Souza et al., 2016). 

 Harvest residues composition and the effect of an external N source were studied 

in a 3 x 2 full-factorial, split-plot in time randomized block design with four replications. 

We tested the effect of residue removal (-R), removal of bark only (-B), and maintenance 

of all residues (+B), combined (+N) or not (-N) with an external N source on 

decomposition (-B and +B treatments, only) and SOM dynamics. Residues totaled an 

equivalent amount of 21.7 and 31.7 t ha-1 of dry mass, in treatments -B and +B, 

respectively. As N source, we used a solution consisted of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 (19:1) 

in an equivalent dose of 200 kg ha-1 of N. The ammonium sulphate solution was enriched 

in 15N and provided a 10 % enrichment in the solution to be used as a mineral N tracer. N 

was applied only once at experiment beginning.  

 The whole experimental unit (EU) of all replications were sampled five times 

during decomposition, i.e. 0, 3, 6, 12 and 36 months.  At each time, 24 EU were collected, 



9 

 

sealed and transported to the lab, where residues were carefully hand-picked, stripped 

from any adhered mineral particles and taken to oven at 45 oC to obtain remaining dry 

mass. Soils were carefully separated in 0 -1, 1 -5 and 5 -10 cm layers, 2-mm sieved and 

air-dried to further analysis. For this study, residues from all sampling time were used to 

build decomposition curves, and soil analysis focused on 0 -1 and 1 -5 cm layers, of 12 

and 36 mo., to investigate SOM dynamics. 

 

2.3. Soil analysis 

2.3.1. SOM fractionation 

2-mm sieved, air dried and free from visible plant material mineral soils from the 

two different depths studied here were physically fractionated in particulate organic 

matter (POM) and mineral associated organic matter (MAOM) following a similar 

protocol as described by Cambardella &amp;amp; Elliott (1992). Briefly, 5 g of soil were dispersed 

using 15 mL of a 15g L-1 solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and one small glass bed 

and shaken for 15 h at 200 rpm in a horizontal shaker. Afterwards, fractions were 

separated by a 53 µ m sieve by gently adding deionized water until the flush through the 

sieve was completely clear. All the material and water that flushed through the sieve 

(MAOM) was recovered and taken to the oven at 60 oC until completely dry.  The material 

remained on the sieve (POM) was removed by rinsing deionized water again, recovered 

in a glass and also taken to oven at 60 oC until dry. This fractionation procedure results 

in no loss of any C fraction, as all the soil, dispersing solution and water is recovered, at 

the same time that both fractions are thoroughly washed from the dispersing salt with the 

deionized water used to get a complete fraction separation. After dry, POM and MAOM 

were then weighted and finely ground with a ball mill for C, 13C, N, 15N and Py-GC/MS 

analysis. 

 

2.3.2. C, ?13C, N and ?15N  

 No carbonate presence has ever been reported for the soils in the region where 

study is located, therefore all C content obtained in samples were considered to be organic 

C (MAPA 1973; Tornquist et al. 2009). Total C, 13C, total N and 15N were determined on 

dried and finely ground soil samples from both fractions using an elemental isotope ratio 

mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS GSL 20-20, Sercon, Crewe, UK). Reference gas was 

calibrated with Pee-Dee-Belemnite (PDB) and atmospheric air N2 certified standards for 



10 

 

isotope signature calculations. The abundance in samples of 13C and 15N was calculated 

as follows: 

 

  ? ? ‰ = (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) ×                                            (1) 
 

  ?  ‰ =5 (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) ×                                            (2) 
 

where R = 13C/12C or 15N/14N ratios. 

 

 Based on ?13C and ?15N obtained, we could calculate the proportion of C in each 

fraction that is derived from residues (fCHR) and the amount of N in each fraction that is 

derived from the fertilizer (fNm) as follows: 

 

fCHR=
(? ? ? ? ?? ) (? ??? ? ? ?? )?                                      (3) 

 

where ?13Cf is the ?13C result obtained in each fraction, ?13CRef is the reference value, that 

we adopted the ?13C of the treatments without residues (-R), fertilized or not, of each 

fraction, depending on the treatment compared, and ?13CHR is the average ?13C of the HR 

used. And 

 

fNm=
(? ?5 . 66 ) (? ?5 . 66 )?                                     (4) 

 

where ?15Nf is the ?15N result obtained in each fraction for the treatments amended with 

N, 0.3663 is the reference value for N2 air, and ?15Nm is the enrichment of the solution 

used (10 %). 

 

2.3.3. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry  

 Chemical composition of SOM fractions was analyzed using Py-GC/MS. We used 

samples from time 0, 12 and 36 mo. to see SOM dynamics and chemical changes in the 

two fractions in order to test a pathway of litter transformation into SOC (Cotrufo et al., 

2015). Py-GC/MS analysis followed previously described protocols (Grandy et al., 2007; 



11 

 

Rinkes et al., 2016). Briefly, samples were pyrolyzed with a CDS Pyroprobe 5150 

pyrolizer (CDS Analytical, Inc., Oxford, PA, USA) at 600 oC for 20 s and then transferred 

to a Thermo Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, 

USA) where they were separated on a fused silica column over the course of 

approximately 60 min with a starting temperature of 40 oC and final temperature of 310 
oC. Compounds were then ionized via ion trap on a Polaris Q mass spectrometer (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific).  

 The Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS, 

V 2.65) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) compound library 

were used to analyze and identify peaks. Peaks of each sample were expressed as relative 

abundance of total sample peak area. Py-GC/MS products were grouped into eight 

classes, i.e. Aromatics, Lignin, Lipids, N-Bearing, Phenol, Polysaccharides, Protein and 

Unknown Origin.  

 

2.4. Data analysis 

Successive sampling allowed us to estimate decomposition rate in treatments 

with residues presence. Remaining mass at each time was used to fit the single 

exponential decay model (Olson, 1963) as follows: 

 ? = ? ?                                          (5) 
 

Where X0 = initial mass (%), X = remaining mass (%) at a time t, in days, and k 

= decomposition rate per day. The fitted model allowed us to estimate half-life (hl), in 

days, i.e. the required to time to decompose 50 % of initial mass, of residues in each 

treatment through the following equation: 

 ? = ln /                                       (6) 
 

Data were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test and natural log or box-cox 

transformed in cases where data for ANOVA did not meet normality assumptions. 

Afterwards, a three-way ANOVA was performed with Depth, Residues and N as main 

factors, and all interactions, for soil SOM variables, and a two-way ANOVA with 

Residues (Bark) and N was performed to compare residues decomposition in the different 

treatments.

A multivariate description of Py-GC/MS products was performed using Principal 

Components Analysis (PCA) to investigate their distribution and obtain a chemical 

fingerprint of SOM fraction at each treatment, depth and time. We calculated Euclidean 

distance matrixes from the eight classes that Py-GC/MS products were grouped to create 

PCA plot. All analysis were performed with R 3.02 (R Development Core Team, 2013).  

  

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Decomposition 

Bark notably reduced decomposition of residues (p&lt;0.05), while Nitrogen 

addition had a tendency (p = 0.0663) to slow down HR decomposition (Fig. 1). +B 

treatments showed an average hl of ~ 80 days longer than -B. +N presented an average hl 

of ~ 60 days longer than -N. +B had a higher influence in +N treatments, and N addition 

had bigger effect in +B treatments, although N x Res. interaction was not significant 

(p=0.7999).

3.2. C content, ?13C, N content and fNm of SOM fractions 

 All variables varied between the two-depth studied, except C:N ratio of both 

fractions (Table 3). Harvest residues (HR) and N had influenced SOM properties after 3 

yr. of experiment. Changes in C content and ?13C were more expressive in 0 -1 cm layer 

and POM fraction (Fig. 2). Overall, HR presence increased C content and decreased ?13C 

values, indicating a higher fraction derived from HR in SOM. +B tended to increase HR 

contribution, but its effect was more distinguished in -N treatments. Changes in N content 

followed similar trend observed for C (Fig. 3). +N showed higher N content in POM 

fraction than -N treatments, except in +B treatments where this behavior was not 

observed. Contrary, +N resulted in smaller N content in MAOM than -N treatments. 

Therefore, C:N ratio – POM was higher in -N (13.65) treatments than +N (11.49) 

treatments, and C:N ratio – MAOM was higher in +N (9.48) treatments than -N (9.07) 

treatments. Mineral N fraction was always higher when HR were present, and even higher 

when bark was kept among residues. However, mineral N contribution to SOM fractions 

was always smaller than 4 %.

3.3. Py-GC/MS of SOM fractions 

The relative abundance of Py-GC/MS products summarized in the eight classes 

are presented in Table 4 (0 -1 soil cm soil depth) and Table 5 (1 -5 cm soil depth). Depths 

were highly different in SOM chemistry (p &amp;lt;0.001), so we organized their representation 

separately to simplify the understanding of their dynamics (Fig. 4). The PCA plot 

obtained using these eight classes showed a clear separation of fractions inside both 

depths and shifts in chemistry of fractions overtime (Fig. 4). Higher contribution of lignin 

to total chemical composition was observed in treatments with HR presence in POM 

fraction of 0 -1 cm depth, particularly when bark was present. In this layer and POM 

fraction, from 1 yr. to 3 yr., Lignin drecreased from 15 % to 7 %, and from 23 % to 15 

%, in -R treatments, -N and +N, respectively (Table 4). When HR were present, it 

increased from 16 to 23 % and from 29 to 32 %, in -N treatments, -B and +B, respectively. 

In +N treatments, Lignin drecreased from 21 to 16 % and from 27 to 21 %, in -B and +B 

treatmentes, respectively (Table 4). Despite little or no lignin contribution in MAOM 

fraction in 1 -5 depth (ranging from 0 to 2 %), Lignin seems to be driving the separation 

between MAOM 1 and 3 yr., basically due to native lignin disappearance in the 3 yr. 

samples (Table 5).  

Lipid contribution is higher in POM of 1 -5 than in POM 0 -1 cm layer. In MAOM 

fraction, it seems to be similar between the two depths. Aromatics compounds increased 

overtime in POM and decreased in MAOM fraction of both depths (ranging from 10 to 

18 %). Polyssacharides and Protein showed similar behavior overtime. They seem to 

decrease in POM fraction overtime, while increase in MAOM, independently of 

treatment. In MAOM 3 yr. samples of both depths, Polyssacharides were higher in -N 

treatments, reaching more than 30 %. Protein peaked around 17 % in 3 yr. MAOM 

samples in residues presence (Tables 4 and 5). Phenol compounds were mostly absent in 

our samples.  

Treatments with N input (+N) showed a tendency of staying closer in MAOM 0 -1 

cm depth, although a good separation of treatmens happened only in POM 0 -1 depth and 

it was due to HR presence, indicating a constant flow of HR input to this fraction (Fig. 

4).

4. DISCUSSION 

 
We found a clear effect of residue mix on the decomposition rate (Fig.1). 

Although the mix composition of litter is known to influence decomposition behavior 

(Hernández et al., 2009; Vivanco and Austin, 2011), our results were the opposite from 

similar but broader studies of eucalypt harvest residues decomposition in Brazil (Ferreira 

et al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). Studying several sites in the country, the referred authors 

found out that, overall, bark presence accelerated decomposition and nutrient release from 

eucalypt harvest residues. Indeed, the site where our study is located had a peculiar 

behavior when compared to the others (Ferreira et al., 2016). They hypothesized that this 

effect was due to the high nutrient content in bark, specially Calcium, and the probable 

higher physical protection against any disturb when bark was present.  Our site is located 

in a subtropical area of the country and as it is a nutrient-rich soil, microorganism did not 

need to scavenge the material for nutrients for their processes, so this could explain why 

bark slowed down decomposition here and elsewhere (Epron et al., 2006; Hernández et 

al., 2009; Shammas et al., 2003), as it is a more complex material and presents a higher 

lignin and phenol content (García et al., 2014; Kögel-Knabner, 2002). 

As observed in the other sites, nitrogen effect on decomposition was not 

significant (Ferreira et al., 2016; Souza et al., 2016). However, +N here presented a trend 

to slow down decomposition, and its greater effect when bark was present, or the greater 

effect of +B in +N treatments, although not significant, might indicate a possible 

interaction between the tannins present in bark and N, enhancing their toxicity and 

unpalatability to decomposers or by binding with dietary proteins and digestive enzymes 

(Coulis et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2016; Kraus et al., 2003; Makkonen et al., 2012).  

Harvest residues (HR) had a positive impact on C and N of both SOM fractions, 

increasing the content and C derived from C3 plants (Fig. 2 and Fig.3). Effects of HR on 

soil C were higher on POM than MAOM fraction (Fig.2). +B particularly had greater 

impact on -N treatments than on +N treatments. This could be a result of the slower 

decomposition of this treatment, since there is less decomposed material “ready” to 

become SOM. However, considering the proportion of SOM derived from HR, we 

noticed a different behavior in -N and +N treatments, while changes in decomposition 

were not that expressive, being another indicator of possible interaction between tannins 

and N, slowing down decomposition and reducing C transfer and stabilization. Moreover, 

the reduction of +B effect on POM-N and MAOM-N content in +N treatments is 

intriguing. Changes in N of SOM fractions were similar to that happened to soil C. The 



20 

 

lack of effect +N treatments in N content, although recovery of mineral N in SOM 

fractions (Fig. 3), might be explained by C:N ratio of our soils fraction. Ratios varied 

from 9 to 14. This narrow range is not likely to offer any constraint to microbial activity 

(Manzoni et al., 2010, 2008). Therefore, little +N effect on decomposition could either be 

attributed to the optimum stoichiometric range of our soil C:N ratio or the ability of 

decomposers to decompose N-poor materials (Ferreira et al., 2016; Manzoni et al., 2008).  

Although HR and N impact on soil C happened in both layers, they were more 

expressive on 0 -1 cm soil layer. Sampling this thin layer is not usual and hard to do in 

field experiments. However, the use of micro-plots allowed us to have better control of 

sampling process and better study the dynamics of C transference from litter to soil. Albeit 

this layer might not be representative of soil C stocks and be too susceptible to impacts, 

it seems to concentrate the first steps of litter transformation (Cotrufo et al. 2015) and the 

effects on it might be reflected in deeper layers in smaller scales later (Figs. 2 and 3).  

Several authors have studied the impact of eucalypt HR on soil properties (Epron 

et al., 2015, 2006; Jesus et al., 2015; Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Mendham et al., 2003; 

Rocha et al., 2016). HR usually have a positive impact on soil physics (Jesus et al., 2015; 

Silva et al., 2007), as they protect the soil from compaction during harvesting operations; 

soil chemistry, by increasing the amount of nutrients that remain in the field and thus 

nutrient cycling (Ferreira et al., 2016; Hernández et al., 2009; Laclau et al., 2010b); and 

soil organic properties, helping to keep or increase soil C stocks (Epron et al., 2015, 2006; 

Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Rocha et al., 2016). Their effect on soil C is, however, highly 

debated (Epron et al., 2006; Kumaraswamy et al., 2014; Mendham et al., 2003). Even 

though several factors could affect soil C dynamics, especially when trying to see the 

effect of more lignified litter as HR (Magnússon et al., 2016), we hypothesize that this 

could be a matter of soil sampling depth, as transference occurs first in a thin top-soil 

layer, and the method used to measure soil C. Setting up the experiment in the beginning 

of a rotation allowed us to quantify the transference, as the gap between soil and residues 
13C signature was expressive and we believe the results here are quite representative of 

HR impact on SOM “per se”, any direct input from root was avoided using the micro-

plots here described. Indirect contribution happened due to land use change, as ?13C of 

control plots became more and more negative overtime (Table 2; Fig. 2). This 

considerable ?13C change in control plots highlights the difficulty of using isotope in 

perennial culture to study HR impact on SOM, as it could be hampered by the greater root 

input during growth until HR become available (Binkley et al., 2004; Binkley and Resh, 

1999; Christina et al., 2011; Jourdan et al., 2008). Moreover, HR effects seem to happen 



21 

 

first in the POM fraction (Epron et al., 2015), so measuring bulk soil C could prevent a 

better analysis of HR impact on soil C, especially because the major part of soil C is 

associated with minerals, and effects on this fraction seems to be indirect or take longer 

to happen. A positive impact on SOC by HR, as seen here or elsewhere, should be 

interpreted with careful, as it could be happening only in non-stable fractions of soil C. 

Using a chronosequence (0, 1 and 3 yr.) of residue decomposition, we aimed at 

understanding the pathway of SOM formation, i.e. litter becoming soil C and stabilizing. 

We tried to keep track by identifying similarities among SOM fractions with different 

turnover times, accessibility by microbes, and thus stability and role on soil processes 

(Schulze et al., 2009; von Lützow et al., 2007). Several authors have shown that SOM 

fractions have different chemistry and their formation processes are not the same 

(Buurman and Roscoe, 2011; Grandy and Neff, 2008; Schnecker et al., 2016). However, 

to our knowledge, we were the first to try this approach in a time scale. We hypothesized 

that if POM was the first step of litter transformation and it would become a stabilized C, 

3 yr. MAOM chemistry would be similar to 1 yr. POM. That could not be seen by Py-

GC/MS outputs (Fig. 4). It was seen that POM and MAOM are chemically different, and 

therefore we infer they have different formation pathways. Analyzing together changes 

in C content and C transference (?13C) and Py-GC/MS, HR were an important source to 

POM (higher lignin content), while MAOM was formed mainly by microbial products 

(Grandy and Neff, 2008). HR still had, however, some effects on MAOM, leading us to 

think that HR have an indirect, but still crucial, role on C stabilization, since it is an 

important source of C and N for the POM fraction, and this is an important source of 

energy for microbial community (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2013). Indeed, the 

importance of microbial products to SOM under Eucalyptus ecosystems has been 

highlighted elsewhere (Soares et al., 2013). 

Oliveira (2015) showed significant changes in soil community in the same 

experiment studied here through analysis of soil phospholipids fatty acids (PLFA) after 

one year of experiment. Changes happened in the amount and proportions of different 

PLFA classes with HR management. HR removal resulted in increases in Gram + bacteria 

proportion, while HR presence increased the amount of PLFA and most likely microbial 

biomass (Frostegard et al., 1996), raised the proportion of Gram – bacteria and bark 

presence caused an increase in Fungi concentrations. Changes were, however, not drastic. 

Therefore, changes in microbial products signature in MAOM fraction would take a much 

longer time to be seen and might be seen clearer once there are constant input of litter and 

HR in following rotations. 



22 

 

The fate of lignin in soils converted to Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil is still 

unclear, either decreasing (Soares et al., 2013) or increasing (Santana et al., 2015) with 

afforestation.  Comparing initial lignin content of fractions and the differences in lignin 

content from POM to MAOM after 3 yr. of only litter input (Tables 2, 4 and 5), indicates 

that root turnover and exudates inside aggregates may supply lignin to MAOM, and 

almost no lignin is directly transferred from HR to stable fractions. The almost complete 

absence in lignin of 3 yr. samples from 1 -5 cm depth of MAOM fraction (Table 5) points 

out to the fact that without a constant supply, lignin is not stable even associated with 

minerals. The idea that lignin is not that recalcitrant in soils has been growing lately 

(Klotzbücher et al., 2016; Lobe et al., 2002; Rasse et al., 2006; Thevenot et al., 2010). 

However, the idea that when associated with minerals it could remain in soils for decades 

still persists (Dungait et al., 2012; Gaudinski et al., 2001; Rasse et al., 2006; Thevenot et 

al., 2010). Our data support the idea that may not resist even few years if there is no other 

input (Grandy et al., 2007). 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

In summary, we showed that more sustainable management of eucalypt HR, i.e. 

keeping HR in the field, can enhance C sequestration in these forests. Eucalypt HR proved 

to be a significant source to particulate fraction of SOM and may be an important source 

of energy for soil microorganisms, driving microbial community dynamics (Oliveira, 

2015) therefore changing microbial products, chemistry of mineral associated fraction 

and C stabilization (Kallenbach et al., 2016, 2015). N addition, although less expressive, 

alters decomposition and reduce C stabilization of tannin-rich material (bark). SOM 

fractions chemistry differed each other, indicating distinct formation pathway for each 

fraction and different role on C cycle. Above-ground litter may not be a source for lignin 

in deeper layers and lignin may not be as stable as thought even associated with minerals.

III. CHAPTER 2 

Assessing harvest and silvicultural systems effects on soil physical properties, CO2 

efflux, soil C fractions and early tree growth in two Eucalyptus stands in Minas 

Gerais State, Brazil 

 

ABSTRACT 
 

Harvesting and logging are probably the most impactful operations in eucalypt 
forest ecosystems and may define silvicultural operations needed for a successful 
following rotation. Changes in soil physical properties are usually critic and may be 
reflected in soil CO2 efflux, soil organic matter (SOM) properties and plant development. 
In this study, we aimed at understanding the effect of two different harvesting systems 
(Feller + Forwarder – F+F; and Feller + Skidder – F+S) on soil physical and organic 
properties, soil CO2 efflux, and how these properties would be recovered and trees would 
respond in two different silvicultural systems (Coppice or replanting). Hence, two 
homogeneous and adjacent stands were selected and soil physical properties [Soil Bulk 
Density (Ds), Micro (Mi), Macro (Ma) and Total Porosity (TP), and Penetration 
Resistance (PR)] until 60 cm depth, SOM properties [Labile-C, C associated with 
Particulate (C-POM) and Mineral (C-MAOM) fractions] until 20 cm depth, soil CO2 
efflux and stump mortality rate, were assessed after harvesting operations and compared 
with reference (before harvesting). After harvesting, each stand was divided in coppice 
and replanting, and we followed soil CO2 efflux right after planting and one year later, 
when trees height (H) and SOM properties were also measured in both areas and system 
to evaluate how areas would recover from harvesting impacts. All soil variables were 
assessed at row and inter-row positions. Both systems affected soil bulk density and soil 
pore configuration, but in different ways. F+F concentrates traffic at inter-planting row 
position, and therefore caused a slightly higher compaction in this region, while F+S does 
not follow traffic routes and impacted the planting-row similarly, resulting in higher 
stump mortality. Harvesting increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma and TP at all layers. 
Effects were more pronounced on superficial (until 20 cm) layers. Soil CO2 efflux was 
not affected and presented similar values before and post harvesting. Differences in soil 
CO2 were found after planting, when it was higher in F+S system, that also presented 
higher labile-C and C-POM, probably due to greater disturbance. One year after planting, 
mortality rate was still higher under coppice in F+S system, that also presented lower 
trees. In turn, trees were higher in replanting in this area. Soil respiration behaved 
similarly, i.e., higher in F+F under coppice and lower under replanting. Changes in C-
MAOM only happened one year after planting, where it was higher in coppice systems. 
Overall, after one year coppice system presented higher Labile-C, C-POM and C-MAOM 
and we could not attribute any differences to different harvest system. We conclude that 
forest floor removal by skidding operations does not seem to be harmful to SOM 
properties in a single operation and SOM may take longer to respond to this intensive 
removal. But different harvesting systems affect row and inter-row positions differently, 
creating different soil functional zones, that might be enhanced by the next silvicultural 
system chosen, and should be observed when assessing ecosystem services and site 
condition. 

 
Keywords: Eucalypt harvest system; soil compaction; soil respiration; soil organic

1. INTRODUCTION 

Harvesting and logging are among the most expensive operations in planted 

forests and the most impactful on soil physical properties. The possible soil degradation 

due to traffic of heavy machines is a matter of concern regarding ecosystem functions and 

sustainability of future production. Mechanization of these operations is inevitable as it 

is extremely more efficient. With the advance of technology more powerful vehicles were 

developed to meet productivity increases, but at the same time, it may increase soil 

compaction due to heavier machinery carrying larger amounts of wood at a time (Horn et 

al., 2007, 2004; Vossbrink and Horn, 2004). Stresses due to compaction may be long-

lasting or even irreversible and are usually concentrated on soil bulk density and porosity, 

that are closely linked with soil and plant vital processes (Bottinelli et al., 2014; Cambi 

et al., 2015). 

Reductions in porosity and increases in soil bulk density because of compaction 

may modify water and air flow in the soil, and therefore impact plant root development 

and soil biological activity. Decreases in productivity of subsequent rotations are often 

associated with compaction caused by harvesting of previous rotations (Ampoorter et al., 

2011; Jesus et al., 2015). The extent of soil disturbance varies according to several factors 

such as machinery used, amount of wood logged, slope, number of passes in the same 

area, soil clay and organic matter content, soil compaction status and soil humidity during 

operation (Ampoorter et al., 2012, 2010; Cambi et al., 2015; Seixas and Souza, 2007; 

Silva et al., 2010). In summary, the more trafficked areas, the finer-textured soils with 

low organic matter content, the lower soil bulk density and the farthest from optimum 

moisture are the most susceptible conditions to harmful impacts.  

Clear-cut of Eucalyptus stands is usually done with Harvester + Forwarder (H+F) 

or Feller Buncher + Skidder (F+S) systems. The first is usually known as “cut-to-length” 

system, where each tree is harvested and processed in small logs individually, and pilled 

by the harvester, and then the forwarder is used for logging. It usually follows pre-defined 

routes, concentrating the compaction in these areas, and all the non-commercial 

components remain in the area, softening the impact direct to the soil and therefore 

decreasing compaction. However, it is less efficient and compaction may increase with 

the number of passes (Seixas and Souza, 2007). The second, in turn, is used in the “whole-

tree” harvesting process, where the Feller Buncher harvests a group of trees together and 

pile them, and Skidder drags them to the edge of the plot where the tree is processed with 

a harvester or a grapple saw. Albeit is a faster and lighter harvesting system, all the non-



35 

 

commercial residues and the forest floor are removed, which may have further 

implications in nutrient cycling and carbon (C) budget (Achat et al., 2015; Epron et al., 

2015). Currently, the use of Feller Buncher + Forwarder (F+F) has risen trying to obtain 

the most of both systems. Basically, the Feller would harvest a group of trees and pile 

them, that would be processed inside the plot before being logged with the Forwarder 

following the same track the Feller used. This system would create some “residues 

islands” where the trees were processed, but the consequences still need to be studied.  

As said, the choice of the harvesting system may define harvest residue 

management and therefore have directly consequences on soil C stocks. Although the 

impacts on soil C may not be immediate or short-term, it could have significant mid-or-

long-term effect on carbon cycle (Achat et al., 2015; Epron et al., 2006), and therefore 

affect the role of these planted forests in climate change mitigation as recognized by the 

“Clean Development Mechanism” of Kyoto Protocol. Hence, the use of SOM indicators 

that are sensible to soil management, such soil CO2 efflux or labile-C (Goutal et al., 2012; 

Hurisso et al., 2016), is needed to support management decisions. Likewise, the harvest 

system may define the silvicultural management adopted for the next rotation, i.e. coppice 

or high-forest (replanting), based on damage and mortality of strains. The silvicultural 

system would modify ecosystem resilience, since coppice would allow the system to 

recover itself and replanting would require further operations such as subsoiling. Tree 

growth rates are different in both systems and tillage operations might accelerate recovery 

from compaction but at the expenses of breaking down aggregates, releasing stable soil 

C (Fialho, 2016; Nouvellon et al., 2008).     

Based on this, we set up an experiment in two adjacent commercial eucalypt 

stands that were harvested with a Feller Buncher, but one was logged with a Forwarder, 

while the other was logged with a Skidder. After logging, areas were divided in coppice 

and high-forest managements. We measured soil bulk density, micro-macro-and-total 

porosity, penetration resistance, soil CO2 efflux, soil C fractions and initial tree survival 

and growth over 1 yr. to: (i) assess the effect of different harvesting system on soil 

physical and organic properties and how could this changes affect soil CO2 respiration; 

(ii) evaluate how different silvicultural management change the resilience of eucalypt 

plantation harvested with different systems; (iii) evaluate how all of these management 

combinations will impact on initial forest growth.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Study site and experimental design 

The study was conducted in two adjacent eucalypt commercial stands in Estrela 

do Sul, Minas Gerais State, Southeast of Brazil (19o01’S; 47o40’W), within the Cerrado 

(native savannah) domain. The two stands were selected based on homogeneity of 

previous operation and productivity, soil type and properties. Selected sites were covered 

by forest plantations for the last 40 years. Cerrado conversion had started with Pinus sp. 

introduction and changed to Eucalyptus sp. eight years ago. Last rotation averaged 44 m3 

ha-1 yr-1 of wood in both stands. 

Soil of areas were classified as Oxisol (U.S. taxonomy) and its properties are 

presented in Table 1. Both areas are considered flat, easy for any mechanical operations. 

Area is located in a tropical climate region (Aw, K?ppen classification), with dry winter 

and wet summer, and presented mean annual temperature (MAT) of 22 oC and average 

annual rainfall of 1410 mm during study years.

in KCl 1 mol L-1; SB: Sum of Bases: Ca2+ + Mg2+ + K+ + Na+. 

 

Both stands were harvested using a Feller Buncher (John Deere 903J), but logged 

using different machines. One was logged with Forwarder (John Deere 1710D ECOIII, 

6x6) and the other with a Skidder (Tigercat 635D). Therefore, systems differ in logging 

and wood processing, as Feller+Forwarder (F+F) system has the wood processed inside 

the area with a grapple saw, before loading the Forwarder, keeping all residues (leaves 

and branches and twigs) spread, while in Feller+Skidder (F+S) system the wood is 

processed in the edge of the area, also using a grapple saw, before loading the trucks, and 

it concentrates all residues in this edge area. 

After harvesting and logging, areas were divided in two silvicultural systems. Half 

of each area was conducted under coppice and the other half was conducted under high 

forest management, i.e. replanting. For replanting management, the inter-rows of area 

halves were subsoiled until 60 cm depth. Standard fertilization was applied in both 

systems and areas aiming at 45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 of wood yield based on NUTREECALC® 

software estimations. Operations were all mechanized.   



37 

 

2.2. Sampling and data analysis 

Areas were sampled four times: before harvesting [(Pre) – Feb./14], after 

harvesting and logging [(Post) – Apr./14], after planting and fertilizing [(AP) – Jul./14], 

and one year after planting [(1 yr.) – May/15]. Sampling were done each time aiming to 

identify changes in soil physical attributes, soil CO2 efflux, soil organic matter properties 

and plant growth. For each variable, sample occurred following different procedures that 

are detailed below. 

 

2.2.1. Soil physics attributes: Soil bulk density (Ds), Macro (Ma), Micro (Mi), 

Total Porosity (TP) and Soil Penetration Resistance (PR) 

 

Ds, Ma, Mi and TP were assessed before and post whole harvesting and logging 

operations. These properties were obtained through intact soil core samples collected in the 

planting row and in the inter-planting row. At each sampling time, five replications were 

used for each position in each area. Soil cores were collected in four depths: 0 – 10, 10 – 

20, 20 – 40 and 40 – 60 cm. 

Mass and volume of soil core sampler were obtained previously. After sampling, 

samples were tightly packed with a plastic film to avoid any possible loss of soil and sent 

to the lab. At the lab, samples were weighted to obtain current soil moisture content. Soil 

cores were placed in trays with water up to 80% of each soil cylinder height for 48 h to 

complete saturation. Afterwards they were taken to a tension table for 48 h with 60 cm of 

water column pressure and then weighted to determine microporosity. Soil core were then 

dried at 105 oC until constant weight to obtain soil dry mass.   

Soil particle density (Dp) was determined through the volumetric flask method and 

total porosity with TP = 1 – Ds/Dp equation. Macroporosity was determined by math 

difference between TP and Mi. 

PR was evaluated before and post whole harvesting and logging operations 

simultaneously with soil physics properties in a systematic way (Tavares Filho and Ribon, 

2008), at planting and inter-planting row, with 15 replications each. PR was also assessed 

in systematic way after replanting (only at replanted areas), but with 8 replications at four 

distances (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m) from subsoiling line.  

We evaluated PR with an impact penetrometer (Stolf et al., 1983) until 60 cm depth. 

PR (MPa) was calculated using the following equation: PR = (5.6 + 6.89 N) x 0.098, where 



38 

 

N is the number of impacts per decimeter of soil, proposed by (Stolf, 1991), considering 

the penetrometer specifications. 

Data from Ds, Ma, Mi and TP were submitted to a three-way ANOVA using 

SISVAR software (Ferreira, 2011), following repeated measures procedure with 

Harvesting System, Sampling Time and Depth as main factors. The effect of harvesting 

system and sampling time at each depth were compared through F test, and differences in 

soil attributes among depths were assessed by Tukey post-hoc test at 5%. 

 

2.2.2. CO2 efflux 

 

Soil CO2 surface efflux measurements were done at the four sampling times 

evaluated. During the first two sampling (pre-and post-harvesting), sampling was carried 

out in 15 replications, following a systematic distribution across the two stands, at the 

planting and inter-planting row. After silvicultural systems set up, i.e. two last sampling 

times, sampling occurred with 6 replications per system.  

For CO2 sampling, two static chambers placed at the planting (row) and inter-

planting row (inter-row) were used. Chambers consisted of 25 x 25 cm PVC tubes, 

inserted 5 cm into the soil, at least 24 h prior to the sampling. Chambers were closed for 

40 min and four sampling were performed during this period (0, 10, 20 and 40 min) to 

build the CO2 flux. Collects were performed with 60 mL syringe coupled with closure 

valves that were stored under constant temperature up to 10 days until CO2 determination. 

Simultaneously to gas sampling, soil temperature and moisture were determined with 

sensor – data logger 5 TM (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA). 

CO2 concentration at each syringe was determined in a cavity ring-down 

spectrometer (CRDS, Picarro Sunnyvale, CA). Flux was calculated through the following 

equation: 

 

? = ?Q?t  ?  ? ? ?? ? ? ? ?  
 

Where fCO2 is the flux of CO2 (mg m-2 h-1); ?Q/?t: the slope of fitted regression 

(µ g g-1 s-1); M: CO2 molecular weight (g mol-1); P: pressure inside the chamber (1 atm 

assumed); V: chamber volume (dm3); R: molar gas constant (0.08205 L atm K-1 mol-1); 

T: soil temperature (K); and A: chamber basal area (m²).  



39 

 

Analysis of data was carried out with two three-way ANOVA procedures. One 

comparing the Harvesting System (Area), Sampling Time and Position (Row or Inter-

row) effects on soil CO2 efflux and the other comparing Area, Silvicultural System and 

Position on soil CO2 efflux though F test. Box-cox and natural logarithm transformation, 

for the first and second dataset, respectively, were necessary to meet normality 

assumptions. 

 

2.2.3. Soil organic matter properties: Labile C (Clab), Particulate Organic 

Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Matter (MAOM) 

 

SOM properties were assessed in three times of the four-sampling done: before 

and post harvesting, and one year after planting. At each time, a systematic sampling 

procedure was adopted. Three composite (n=18) samples were collected before and post 

harvesting, while in the last sampling (one year after planting) three composite (n=12) 

samples were obtained per silvicultural system, for each area at each depth and position. 

SOM was evaluated at 0 – 10 and 10 – 20 cm layer. 

Labile C was oxidated with KMnO4 0.033 mol L-1 following Shang and Tiessen 

(1997) procedure and determined in spectrophotometer at 565 nm. POM and MAOM 

were determined by physical fractionation (Cambardella and Elliott, 1992). Briefly, 5 g 

of soil (air dried, 2 mm sieve) were dispersed with 15 mL of 5 g L-1 sodium 

hexametaphosphate solution by shaking for 15 h on a horizontal shaker. POM and 

MAOM were separated with a 53 µ m sieve by rinsing water and recovered in different 

glasses. Fractions were dried at 60 oC until constant weight and then finely ground. C 

associated with each fraction was determined by dry combustion C analyzer. 

 

2.2.4. Forest Inventory 

We started forest inventory after harvesting, when a survivor census of each area 

was performed to complement soil physical data. One year after replanting/coppice, tree 

height (H) and mortality were measured at plots previous established to assess harvesting 

and silvicultural systems effects on trees initial growth. 32 permanent plots were 

established in each area and system to evaluate annual forest growth. Areas and 

silvicultural systems were compared through a two-way ANOVA using average tree 

height and mortality obtained in each plot.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1.Soil physical attributes and Forest Inventory 

Areas were fairly homogeneous before harvesting operations, although area under 

F+F harvesting system presented higher density and microporosity, and smaller 

macroporosity and total porosity at the inter planting-row area (Fig. 1). Both systems 

affected soil bulk density and soil pore configuration, but in different ways. Differences 

in traffic patterns could clearly be seen by different changes in soil physical properties. 

Results from undisturbed soil sampling and PR were convergent (Fig. 1 and 2). Both 

systems affected planting and inter-planting row, being the last the most impacted. 

However, while F+F system concentrates its traffic on inter-planting row areas by 

following pre-determined traffic routes, F+S system traffics throughout the area, 

impacting planting-row region likewise. This could be more harmful depending on 

silvicultural system adopted for the next rotation, as more strains could be damaged, 

increasing the mortality rate (Ampoorter et al., 2011). The smaller damage caused to the 

strains using F+F system (Table 2) seems to facilitate strains recovery, as a smaller 

mortality rate could be seen after one year under coppice (Table 3). In F+S area, almost 

no recovery could be seen after one year.

Census of the status of the remaining strain reinforce harvesting impacts as found 

for soil physics attributes. F+S caused higher strain mortality (Table 2). This was 

probably due to major traffic intensity on planting-row, as could be observed by higher 

alterations on its physical properties (Fig. 1). One year after planting and fertilization, 

trees were much higher in coppice systems. Trees under coppice were higher in F+F 

system, while replanted trees were higher in F+S (Table 3). Coppice systems also 

presented higher mortality. Mortality was higher in F+S system under coppice and did 

not differ between areas in replanting systems.

Traffic increased Ds, Mi and PR and reduced Ma and TP at all layers. Effects were 

more pronounced on superficial (until 20 cm) than deeper layers. Compared to before 



43 

 

traffic values, F+F caused the larger alteration in Ds, that was 16 % increase at inter-row 

in the 0-10 cm layer. At planting row, a maximum increase of 10 % was seen by this 

system at 20-40 cm layer. F+S, in turn, caused an increase of 13 % at planting row in the 

0-10 cm layer and 14 % at inter-row 10-20 cm layer. This magnitude of change is common 

in eucalypt (Jesus et al., 2015; Lopes et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2007) and other forest 

ecosystems harvesting (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Labelle and Jaeger, 2011), and 

compaction usually happens in the top soil layers (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Dedecek and 

Gava, 2005; Jesus et al., 2015). 

Other properties were, though, more affected. PR achieved ~ 4.0 MPa at the 

planting row for both systems and ~ 5.0 and 7.0 MPa at inter-planting row for F+S and 

F+F, respectively. As summarized by Silva et al. (2000), these levels achieved in both 

systems might constrain root growth, since values ranging from 1.1 to 5.0 MPa are 

acknowledge to affect root growth. For eucalypt, a mean value of 3.0 MPa is accepted, 

although other authors found values around 8.0 MPa after eucalypt harvesting and still 

obtained similar productivity to non-compacted soils in next rotation (Seixas and Souza, 

2007). After subsoiling, the subsoiling line returned to levels before harvesting (Fig. 3). 

However, surrounding areas that might be used for roots exploitation remained more 

compacted and may be a matter of concern in F+S system, particularly when is observed 

high mortality rate and slower tree growth even after one year (Table 3), and this could 

still be reflected in the end of the rotation (Dedecek and Gava, 2005).

Porosity is among the most important and sensitive indices to evaluate soil 

compaction, since it is strictly related to water movement and soil aeration (Alaoui et al., 



44 

 

2011; Berisso et al., 2012; Cambi et al., 2015; Kuncoro et al., 2014).  Mi and Ma were 

more affected than Ds. A reduction of 87 % in Ma was observed in F+F system at inter-

row area in 0-10 depth (Fig. 1). This system also caused reductions higher than 50 % at 

the inter-row in other depths but 40-60 cm, where it lowered Ma in 40 %. F+S system 

happened to affect Ma more at the inter-planting row than the planting row. The biggest 

effect occurred in 0-10 cm layer and it was of 60 % of reduction. However, in the other 

depths the reductions were all lower than 50 %, being only 7 % in the deeper layer. At 

the planting row, in turn, F+S caused the higher changes in Ma. The highest decrease also 

happened in the top layer and it was of 52 %. Decreases in the other layer ranged from 27 

% to 36 %. In F+F system, the greatest reduction (42 %) was in the 20-40 cm layer. 0-10 

cm presented 35 % less Ma after harvesting and decreases in the other layers were smaller 

than 20 %.  

These reductions in Ma caused an increase in Mi, however increases were in a 

smaller magnitude than Ma decreases. They were always smaller than 20 % and more 

concentrated at the inter-row position. TP was also decreased, but were even in smaller 

magnitude, usually around 10 %. We do not know to what extent this changes in soil 

porosity would affect water movement in our study soils. However, changes observed 

here were as expressive or more than those found in other studies that related negative 

effects of compaction on soil environment and soil biological properties (Ares et al., 2005; 

Cambi et al., 2015; Frey et al., 2009). 

Our results showed that compaction happened most in top soil layer. Some authors 

have argued that sometimes this layer is not too affected due to its higher SOM content, 

which could increase aggregate stability and therefore soil elasticity, giving a higher 

protection against compaction (Braida et al., 2008).  Hence, deeper layers would reflect 

more compaction status due to traffic (Jesus et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2010). Indeed, the 

top soil layer of our soils presented higher soil C content than deeper layers (Fig. 7). 

However, this higher C content also results in lower density and higher porosity (Cambi 

et al., 2015), enhancing the susceptibility to compaction, since this layer is the one that 

receives the heavy traffic impact before it could be dissipated to deeper layers. In our 

case, this could also be highlighted due to almost total forest floor removal in F+S system 

and the non-continuous residues disposal in F+F system, that would increase the pressure 

over the soil (Ampoorter et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2007).

3.2. Soil CO2 efflux 

 

Despite affecting soil pore configuration (Fig. 1), harvesting and logging did not 

affect soil CO2 efflux (Fig. 4). Small changes happened, like increase in respiration in 

F+F system and higher inter-row respiration in F+S system. These changes were, though, 

not significant. We hypothesized that reductions in soil porosity would result in reduced 

CO2 flux, since decreases in soil aeration could increase the production of other 

greenhouse gases, such CH4 and N2O (Frey et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2014). Albeit 

this could have happened, a possible increase in soil respiration due to disturbance and 

increase SOM mineralization may have offset that and our measurement was not sensible 

to that. A small change but not significant could be seen in F+S system where inter-

planting row presented a higher respiration than planting row after traffic, probably due 

to greater changes in compaction of this system on this position. Also, average humidity 

ranged from 25 % to 28 %, after and before harvesting and logging, respectively, and did 

not vary between row and inter-row (Table S1). Considering the soil total porosity 

presented, we believe that was still enough space for aeration, therefore the compaction 

achieved may not be enough to hamper air flow. The possible change in pore 

configuration along the soil profile may have resulted in micro-sites where aeration 

shifted, however we could not detect that by measuring surface CO2 efflux. 

Effects of forest harvesting on soil CO2 are variable (Goutal et al., 2012; Yashiro 

et al., 2008) and few are the studies addressing the effects of logging or soil preparation 

in eucalypt plantations (Epron et al., 2006; Fialho, 2016; Nouvellon et al., 2008).  Epron 

el al. (2006) observed decreases in soil respiration after clear-cutting the stand in 

comparison to uncut stands. Fialho (2016), on the other hand, observed increases in soil 

CO2 efflux after harvesting. In such study, comparing Harvester+Forwarder (H+F) and 

Feller+Skidder (F+S) systems, it was observed that after harvesting soil CO2 efflux was 

higher at inter-planting row, while F+S clearly stimulated CO2 efflux at the planting row. 

The author argued that this response was due to disturbance and aggregate breakdown, 

releasing protected carbon. In the present study, even with a high degree of changes in 

soil physical properties, we could not see clear changes in the pattern of CO2 efflux. 



46

and inter-planting (inter-row) row. Same upper case in italic inside same time and position, and 
same upper case inside same area and position, and same lower case inside same area and time 
do not differ at 5% by F test. 

 

Right after planting, respiration was higher in F+S area than in F+F, independently 

of the silvicultural system adopted. More labile-C and POM-C (Fig. 6) was available in 

this area after planting, probably as result of the larger disturbance happened in the whole 

area and a small delay in the respiration could be captured in the next (after planting) 

sampling. Interestingly, subsoiling did not cause an immediate peak in respiration and 

respiration was lower than reference or even after harvesting and logging. At that time, 

respiration in coppice system was higher in F+S, while replanted areas presented a slight 

higher respiration than coppice on F+F system, but no significant differences were found 

under coppice or replanting, or between row and inter-row. As seen here, Nouvellon et 

al. (2008) did not see a clear effect of disturbing soil before planting on soil CO2 efflux. 

Fialho (2016), in turn, observed increases in CO2 emissions at the subsoiling line.  

Overall, soil CO2 efflux increased with time and one year after planting respiration 

returned to before harvesting levels, or increased, as happened in F+F area under coppice 

management (Fig. 5). Respiration in coppice areas were higher in F+F system 

independently of sampling position, respiration in replanted areas was higher at planting 

row in F+S system. We believe that a major part of this difference is heterotrophic 

respiration due to plant development as it could be seen by trees measurement at the same 

time, when bigger trees and smaller mortality were seen in F+F in coppice, compared to 



47 

 

coppice in F+S, and higher trees in replanting system were seen in F+S area, with similar 

mortality rates (Table 3).

silvicultural system and position, and same upper case inside same area and position, and same 
lower case inside same area and silvicultural system do not differ at 5% by F test. 

 

3.3.Soil organic matter properties 

Harvesting operations usually resulted in decreases in labile C. (Fig. 6). This was 

not observed only in F+S system at the planting row, where an increase in labile-C was 

seen. Particularly before harvesting, labile C was higher at the inter-planting row areas. 

F+F system impacted more negatively on labile C at the inter-row area. POM-C and 

MAOM-C presented similar behavior as labile-C. However, changes due to harvesting 

were much less expressive in MAOM-C fraction. Harvesting effects on soil C are usually 

studied following different harvest residues management and immediate or short-term 

effects are not expected in stable fractions (Cambi et al., 2015; Epron et al., 2006; Johnson 

and Curtis, 2001). However, labile fractions of soil C may be more sensitive and earlier 

indicators of disturbance. The possible breakdown of aggregates due to mechanical 

operations would release stabilized carbon inside aggregates, enhancing respiration and 

decreasing soil C. Indeed, changes occurred mostly in more labile fractions. i.e. labile-C 

and POM-C.  

One year after planting, labile C, POM-C and MAOM-C presented similar behavior 

(Fig. 7). Contents were higher at the inter-planting row. At row areas, differences regarding 



48 

 

depth were less expressive. Coppice usually presented higher C content than replanted 

areas. Differences were more expressive at inter-planting row areas, where differences 

among depths were also highlighted. Expressive increases in POM-C were observed at 

inter-planting row one year after planting. At this position, higher MAOM-C was also 

observed under coppice system. Significant shifts in MAOM-C was only observed at inter-

row position under coppice systems. Coppice systems presented the greatest amount of soil 

C overall and we argue that this is due to lesser disturbance and already stablished root 

system, which makes recovery faster and easier, and probably the higher contribution of 

root system to soil C in these systems. Possible effects of harvest system and therefore 

residue management on soil stable pool might only happen if the same management is 

adopted over consecutive rotations (Achat et al., 2015).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

Combining results from shifts in soil physical and organic properties, we could 

see that different harvesting system affect differently row and inter-row positions, that 

could drive the choice of next rotation silvicultural system, due to differences in survival 

rate after harvesting. F+F causes higher local compaction, but trafficked area is more 

controlled and limited to inter-row region. F+S, in turn, system traffics throughout the 

area, impacting planting-row region likewise, but in lesser extent, and may require more 

careful recovery operations. Although expressive effects on soil density and pore 

configuration due to harvesting, soil CO2 efflux seems to remain similar, which indicates 

that it is not a sensitive indicator to evaluate soil compaction status, since changes in soil 

physical properties may need to be harder to shift soil respiration. Labile-C and POM-C 

change rapidly and thus reflect management practices. Forest floor removal by skidding 

operations does not seem to be harmful to SOM properties in a single operation and SOM 

may take longer to respond to this intensive removal. In summary, different harvest and 

silvicultural systems create different soil functional zones, and soil preparation in 

replanting cases enhance differences between row and inter-row areas, and should be 

observed when assessing ecosystem services and site condition.

IV. CHAPTER 3 
 

Nitrogen alters initial growth, fine-root biomass and spatial distribution, and soil 

organic matter properties of Eucalyptus dunnii plantation in Southern Brazil 

 

ABSTRACT 

 
Eucalyptus planted forests are expanding in Brazil and the effects of this land use change 
are still not fully understood. Particularly, nitrogen (N) fertilization effects on Eucalyptus 
growth and the effect of afforestation on soil carbon (C) are still controversial. We set up 
a N fertilization experiment in Southern Brazil, a new frontier of eucalypt expansion over 
natural grassland, to evaluate initial tree growth and changes in soil C. We also evaluated 
fine-root biomass (FRB), its spatial distribution and relation to tillage practices (ridge 
tillage) adopted there. Four N levels (24 – Reference, 36, 48 and 108 kg ha-1 of N) as 
cover fertilization, i.e. applied when trees were 1-year-old, were tested and tree growth 
was assessed during the two first years. Afterwards, representative trees were chosen to 
evaluate FRB and its distribution, and soil samples until 40 cm depth were collected. Soil 
samples were separated in 0 -10, 10 -20 and 20 -40 cm and soil organic matter (SOM) 
was fractionated in Particulate Organic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic 
Matter (MAOM), and C and N content, and shifts in ?13C, were determined in these 
fractions. Positive effect of N on tree growth was highlighted right after fertilization, i.e., 
1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. N effects were seen only at trees height. Highest N dose resulted 
in higher diameter and height, but also higher mortality, therefore greater basal area was 
seen using 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. Increasing N until 56 kg ha-1 resulted in higher FRB, but 
after that level FRB decreased and the highest N dose resulted in the lowest FRB 
observed. N does not seem to drive fine-root spatial distribution, and both horizontal and 
vertical anisotropy in fine-root distribution were observed. Overall, afforestation had 
positive effects on soil C. Changes were more expressive in top-soil layers. 36 kg ha-1 
resulted in higher C-POM in 0 -10, while 48 kg ha-1 resulted in higher C-MAOM in this 
layer. C and N dynamics were tightly correlated, especially in MAOM fractions. ?13C of 
both SOM fractions became more negative overtime, particularly of POM fraction. C-
POM was positively correlated with FRB. ?13C-POM was more negative with depth, 
while ?13C-MAOM became less negative with depth, but changes in ?13C-MAOM were 
not significant. Tillage had a strong control on soil C and N stocks, enhancing C 
deposition and turnover at row (ridge) region, most likely for favoring roots development 
in this region. In summary, we showed that N fertilization may alter initial tree growth, 
but its effects do not seem to last longer. Nevertheless, N effects can be reflected on fine-
root biomass and C and N of SOM fractions.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The growing demand for forest products over the last years and the need for 

cleaner sources to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased the 

importance of planted forests. Brazil is among the world’s biggest sawn wood and pulp 

producers, with highest average productivity. Planted forests cover more than 7.5 million 



57 

 

hectares in the country and ~ 72 % of this area is dominated by Eucalyptus genus 

plantations (IBÁ, 2015). Southern areas in the country, particularly Rio Grande do Sul 

State, is a new frontier of Eucalyptus expansion and planted area in the state with the 

genus has increased 68 % over the last 10 years (ABRAF, 2013; IBÁ, 2015). Most of this 

area is located in the only subtropical region in the country and special attention should 

be given due to its particular characteristics (Alvares et al., 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2013).  

Low temperatures and the risk of frost damage are probably the main concerns for 

eucalypt development in the Brazilian subtropical region. Therefore, tolerance to these 

conditions is essential for a successful planting. Tolerance usually happens at the 

expenses of a higher productivity. E. dunnii showed good adaptability to Southern Brazil 

climatic conditions and is among the most planted species in the region (Floriani et al., 

2011; Gonçalves et al., 2013; Jovanovic et al., 2000). However, few are the studies 

addressing this specie in the region helping to find suitable managements to boost this 

specie productivity as happened with other Eucalyptus species in other areas of the 

country to achieve current levels (Gonçalves et al., 2008; Guimaraes et al., 2015; 

Hernández et al., 2009; Higa et al., 2000; Stape et al., 2010). 

The current high eucalypt productivity in Brazil was achieved mainly due to 

improvements in genetics and silvicultural practices. The relationship between 

productivity and fertilization is well known in agriculture and this is not different in forest 

plantations (Stape et al., 2010, 2006).  Forest growth is limited mainly by N and P in 

tropical regions. However, the response of eucalypt plantation to nitrogen (N) fertilization 

is largely discussed and contradictory in the literature (Gazola et al., 2015; Gonçalves et 

al., 2008, 2004; Jesus et al., 2012; Melo et al., 2015; Pulito et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2013; 

Smethurst et al., 2004, 2003). Some authors have shown a clear response to N fertilization 

(Gonçalves et al., 2008; Jesus et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2013), especially on initial phases 

of growth (Pulito et al., 2015), while others showed no response to N supply, suggesting 

that the organic mineralizable N is the main source and sufficient to support trees demand 

(Costa et al., 2005; Gonçalves et al., 2004; Versini et al., 2013). Regarding below-ground 

growth, studies are far more scarce associating N and root growth in eucalypt ecosystem 

(Jourdan et al., 2008). Nitrogen may also be important to sustain stable soil C formation, 

either by forming more complex compounds or increasing biomass input and turnover 

(Dijkstra et al., 2004; Moran et al., 2005; Neff et al., 2002).  

In Brazil, soil C stocks have presented different responses to afforestation (Cook 

et al., 2016; Jesus et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Santana et al., 2015) and might be 

dependent on prior land use, edaphoclimatic conditions, tree species planted and tillage 



58 

 

practices adopted (Li et al., 2012). Studies assessing the effect of afforestation on soil 

organic matter (SOM) properties in Southern Brazil are scarce (Fialho and Zinn, 2014; 

Santana et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2013) and this is particularly necessary as expansion 

are often taking place over a fragile ecosystem dominated by sandy-textured soils prone 

to wind and water erosion (Roesch et al., 2009). As sustainability of Eucalyptus forests is 

highly associated with SOM stocks, understanding the consequences of eucalypt 

afforestation on SOM of these areas is crucial (Barros and Comerford, 2002). 

  To investigate the effects of eucalypt afforestation and fertilization on initial 

growth and SOM properties, we set up a N fertilization experiment at the beginning of 

conversion of natural grasslands of Pampa Biome to E. dunnii plantations in Southern 

Brazil. We followed tree growth over the first two years, evaluating above and below-

ground growth, and assessed early changes in SOM properties by fractionation in 

Particulate Organic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Matter (MAOM), two 

pools with different turnover time and sensitivity to land use change (Cambardella and 

Elliott, 1992; Lehmann et al., 2001), determining C and N content, and the proportion of 

C-derived from eucalypt (C3) using natural differences in 13C isotope, associated with 

these SOM fractions.  

 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Site description and experimental design 

The study was located in Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil, near Brazil-

Uruguay border (30°26’S; 54°31’W). The site is within Pampa Biome, which is 

characterized by grass domain with many herbs and shrub species co-occurring with the 

grass matrix. It is a new frontier of Eucalyptus plantation expansion in Brazil (IBÁ, 2015). 

Site is located in a sub-tropical climate area (Cfa, K?ppen classification), with mean 

annual temperature (MAT) of 18 oC and average annual rainfall of 1351 mm during 

experiment years (Data from Brazilian National Institute of Spatial Research – INPE – S. 

Gabriel/RS station, located at ~17 km away from experimental site at similar altitude). 

Soils were classified as Inceptsol (U.S. Taxonomy) and properties at the beginning of the 

experiment are presented in Table 1.

Eucalyptus dunnii seedling were planted in October/2012 using a 3.3 x 2.2 m 

spacing. Before planting, soil was subsoiled until 40 cm depth and then prepared in zonal 

tillage, i.e. ridge tillage management was used at planting rows. Overall, planting row 

consisted of ~ 20 x 40 cm (height x width) ridges.  

At planting, 12 kg ha-1 of N were added as base fertilization. Using a randomized 

block design with four replications, the stand was divided in four treatments (totaling 16 

plots) that consisted of four N doses (Source: Urea), applied as cover fertilization one 

year after planting: 12, 24, 36 and 96 kg ha-1 of N, totaling 24 (Reference, commercial 

application used by forest companies in the area), 36, 48 and 108 kg ha-1 of N applied. 

Each plot contained 140 trees, divided in 20 trees for 7 different rows, occupying an area 

of ~ 1000 m2. 

 

2.2. Variables assessed 

2.2.1. Tree growth 

Trees measurement [Diameter at breast height (DBH) and Height (H)] started one 

year (1 yr. age) after planting, i.e. right before the second fertilization, and were carried 

out six months (1.5 yr. age) and one year after (2 yr. age) second fertilization. For the first 

measurement (1 yr.), DBH and H of all trees were measured. For the two other 

measurements (1.5 and 2 yr.), DBH higher than 3 cm and H of the central 20 trees plus 

dominant trees (Hd) (Assman, 1970) were measured. Remaining H were estimated using 

a hypsometric equation developed for each age. We tried the following models: Trorey 

(1932) and Curtis (1967), per treatment, and the generic models Campos and Leite (2006) 

and Scolforo (2005)  for all treatments combined. All these models have proven to be 

well fitted to Eucalyptus plantations (Ribeiro et al., 2010). The best fitted equations were 

chosen based on coefficient of determination (R2), standard error of prediction (Syx) and 

graphical residues distribution. Basal area (G, m2 ha-1) was calculated using obtained 

DBH, mortality rate and plot area.  



60 

 

During the 1.5 yr. age sampling, we also assessed leaf area index (LAI) of each 

treatment and leaf N content. LAI was measured using a Li-COR LAI2000 plant canopy 

analyzer. For each plot, 30 LAI measurements were obtained, simultaneously with the 

above canopy light measurements that were done in an open field adjacent of the eucalypt 

plantation. Leaves from average tree of each plot were collected for leaf N content. They 

were dried and finely ground before sulfur digestion for N determination by Kjedahl 

method. 

 

2.2.2. Fine-root biomass and architecture 

 

Fine-root (Ø &amp;lt;2 mm) biomass (FRB) and its architecture were sampled at 2.75 

yr. age, i.e. July 2015. After getting data from trees measurement, average representative 

trees were defined for each plot and root sampling was taken on those trees. We selected 

one average tree for plot, i.e. for each treatment and replication. Root sampling was 

carried out in a quarter of each tree area. We sampled nine points in pre-defined locations 

based on planting spacing for each tree until 40 cm depth, as almost 90 % of fine-roots 

are expected to be concentrated in shallower layers (Bouillet et al., 2002; Rodrigues, 

2013). Points were collected in three different directions: row (r), inter-row (i) and a 

diagonal (d) at 45o between r and i axis, as shown in Figure 1. A 6-cm diameter auger 

was used for sampling.

of total tree area. R: indicates row positions; I: indicates inter-row positions; and D: indicates 
diagonal positions at 45o between row and inter-row.  



61 

 

Samples were separated in 0 – 10, 10 – 20, 20 – 30 and 30 – 40 cm depth. For 

each point and depth, a soil cylinder was collected and roots gently separated from soil 

by hand. Roots were stored in plastic bags and taken to the lab further cleaning, drying 

and weighting. Roots from one replication were stored in a 20 % hydro-alcoholic solution 

to keep its fresh properties. In the lab, roots were thoroughly washed, and fine-root were 

separated from the others with a sieve and taken to the oven at 50 oC until dry to obtain 

total dry mass. Roots that were stored in the hydro-alcoholic solution were scanned at 300 

dpi resolution before being taken to the oven. We processed root image with Safira 

software (Jorge and Rodrigues, 2008) to obtain average length, average diameter, total 

surface area and therefore specific root area (SRA). 

 

2.2.3. SOM properties 

2.2.3.1. C and N associated with SOM fractions 

Soil was collected at the same time as root sampling. Soil samples were randomly 

collected in five points (n=5) per plot until 40 cm depth, divided in 0 – 10, 10 – 20 and 

20 – 40 cm. Samples were then grouped and mixed to build a composite sample per plot. 

Samples were air-dried and 2-mm sieved before further analysis. We took a 5 g sub-

sample for SOM physical fractionation (Cambardella and Elliott, 1992) in Particulate 

Organic Matter (POM) and Mineral Associated Organic Mater (MAOM), and C, 13C and 

N content associated with each fraction were determined. Briefly, 5 g of soil were 

dispersed using 15 mL of a 15g L-1 solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and one small 

glass bed and shaken for 15 h at 200 rpm in a horizontal shaker. Afterwards, fractions 

were separated by a 53 µ m sieve by gently adding deionized water until the flush through 

the sieve was completely clear. All the material and water that flushed through the sieve 

(MAOM) was recovered and taken to the oven at 60 oC until completely dry.  The material 

remained on the sieve (POM) was removed by rinsing deionized water again, recovered 

in a glass and taken to oven at 60 oC until dry.  

 After dry, POM and MAOM were then weighted and finely ground with a ball 

mill for C, 13C and N content determination using an elemental isotope ratio mass 

spectrometer (EA-IRMS GSL 20-20, Sercon, Crewe, UK). Reference gas was calibrated 

with Pee-Dee-Belemnite (PDB) certified standard for isotope signature calculations. The 

abundance in samples of 13C was calculated as follows: 

 



62 

 

  ? ? ‰ = (? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ) ×                                            (1) 
  

where R = 13C/12C ratio. 

 

2.2.3.2. Litter and tillage effects on SOM properties 

 Inside the smallest dose treatment (24 kg ha-1 of N – Reference) area, a central 

area occupied by 9 trees (~ 65 m2) was permanently covered with a net (0.5-mm mesh) 

to avoid litter input to the soil. Net was cleaned every month and fallen litter was taken 

to the lab where it was dried and weighted to obtain litter input rates. Soil was collected 

inside this area in three different points (n=3) until 40 cm depth, then grouped and mixed 

to make one composite sample per replication. C and N content and ?13C associated with 

SOM fractions were obtained using the same procedure described above. We compared 

these data with those obtained from areas not covered with the net inside the same 

treatment. 

 Soil samples were also collected inside reference dose plots at the planting row 

and inter-planting positions to evaluate any tillage effect on SOM properties. Five 

samples (n=5) until 40 cm depth were collected per position to form one composite 

sample for each position for each replication. The same SOM fractionation procedure and 

C, N and ?13C content determination described previously were adopted to see any tillage 

effect on SOM properties. 

 

2.3. Data analysis  

 Data was checked for normality and homoscedasticity for each variable and ln-

transformed in necessary cases to meet normality assumptions. We fitted linear 

regressions for each sampling time to see increasing N fertilization effects on tree growth 

(DBH, H, LAI) and root biomass. Two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student LSD test were 

used for all tree variable and SOM properties. A correlation between above and below-

ground tree variables with SOM properties was also performed. 

 Spatial distribution of fine-roots across horizontal and vertical layers was 

represented using ordinary kriging of fine-root density (FRD). This method smoothes root 

distribution representation, by estimating FRD in areas where roots were not measured, 

based on the semi-variogram of variances of measured data, considering distance and 



63 

 

direction of obtained data. The semi-variogram model was adjusted according to the 

normality, stationarity, tendency and anisotropy of the samples, and its fitness was 

evaluated by a cross validation technique. All analysis were carried out in SISVAR® and 

R 3.02 software (Ferreira, 2011; R Development Core Team, 2013). 

 

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Tree growth 

Trees presented similar growth pattern before cover fertilization (Fig. 2). 

Differences in DBH and H were not significant until 1.5 yr., when a positive effect of N 

fertilization on growth was seen. Differences were higher at 1.5 yr., whereas at 2 yr. 

differences could be seen only for H. A clear change in slope due to fertilization could be 

seen at growth curves. The highest N dose resulted in higher mortality, which explains 

the lower G, even with higher average DBH, than 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. These differences 

were though not significant. An increase in leaf N content and LAI could be seen with 

increasing N dose, however increases were also not significant at 5 % of probability 

(Table 2).

3.2. Fine-root biomass (FRB) and spatial distribution 
 

Fine-root biomass responded positively until ~ 60 kg ha-1 of N. After this dose, 

increasing N addition reduces FRB until 40 cm depth (Fig. 3). This behavior is a result of 

a positive impact of N availability on root growth until the third highest dose used, but 

the lowest root biomass was found at the highest N dose applied. 



65

indicates parameter is significant at 5 %. 
 

 

 Tillage changed root distribution along soil surface and profile (Fig. 4). Fine-root 

density showed a high heterogeneity along soil profile, and there was horizontal and 

vertical anisotropy in root distribution. Root spatial distribution varied in the different N 

doses tested and in the different regions. FRD seems to increase along soil profile at 

planting row, particularly due to 20 cm ridges created. Inter-row and diagonal position 

presented a “more natural” behavior, i.e. higher root density in soil top layers (Bouillet et 

al., 2002; Grant et al., 2012; Laclau et al., 2001; Lourenço, 2009; Rodrigues, 2013). 

Overall, in these two last position the highest root concentration happened in 10 -20 cm 

layer. This is particularly interesting due to the higher soil density of this layer in 

comparison with top-soil (Table 1). That is probably the reason why more roots could be 

found at planting row position below 20 cm depth.

Correlations among tree and soil variables are summarized in Table 3. DBH and 

H correlated negatively with FRB and positively with SRA. SOM properties had little or 

no correlation with aboveground variables (DBH, H). In turn, C-POM correlated 

positively with FRB and therefore negatively with SRA. C-MAOM only correlated with 

root length. Correlations results show a close link between POM and MAOM fractions 

and between soil C and N.

3.3. C and N associated with SOM fractions as affected by N level, litter presence 

and tillage 

Nitrogen had influence on C associated with POM and MAOM, particularly in 

the 0 -10 cm soil layer. This influence was, though, non-linear and different between 

fractions (Table 4). 36 kg ha-1 of N resulted in the highest C-POM at 0 -10 cm layer. At 

10 -20 cm layer, highest C-POM was found at 48 kg ha-1 of N dose. This dose also resulted 

in the highest C-MAOM in 0 -10 cm layer and N-MAOM in 10 -20 cm layer. In general, 

48 kg ha-1 of N was the dose that provided higher C and N contents. Increasing N dose 

had no effect on ?13C values of SOM fractions. ?13C-POM became more negative as it 

gets deeper, whilst ?13C-MAOM presented small and non-significant differences among 

depths and treatments.

Litter had no effect on C and N of SOM fractions (Table 5). Albeit slight higher 

content of C-POM and N-POM on soil top layer when litter was present, differences were 

not significant. Tillage, in turn, affected C and N content of SOM fractions (Table 5). It 

had little effect on ?13C of these fractions, although more negative values were found at 

planting row areas overall. Row position presented higher C and N content in all three 

depths evaluated. Differences were more expressive in shallower layers.

4. DISCUSSION 

4.1. Tree growth 

 Eucalypt growth response to N has been largely debated. Mineralizable N and the 

efficient internal N cycling are considered to suffice their fast growth (Gama-Rodrigues 

and Barros, 2002; Laclau et al., 2010). Seldom responses of eucalypt growth to N 

fertilization are found in literature and they are usually limited to the two first years, while 



70 

 

canopy is still in formation or under N limiting situations (Gazola et al., 2015; Gonçalves 

et al., 2008; Jesus et al., 2012; Melo et al., 2015; Pulito et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2013; 

Smethurst et al., 2004, 2003). Here, tree growth responded positively to N fertilization 

during the two years evaluated. N effects on growth was greater at 1.5 yr. age, i.e. six 

months after cover fertilization and treatment application, when DBH and H were 

positively influenced by N (Fig. 2). At 2 yr., only H was positively influenced.  

The highest N dose resulted in the highest LAI and leaf N content, although not 

significant, which could explain this higher growth (Table 2). Albeit differences in 

eucalypt LAI and leaf nutrient content due to fertilization may respond in lower extent 

than growth (Melo et al., 2015), they are considered good indicators of continuous forest 

growth (Albaugh et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2012; Smethurst et al., 2003; Stape et al., 2004). 

LAI smaller than 3 m2 m-2 as found here have already been reported for eucalypt tropical 

plantations (Binkley et al., 2002; Smethurst et al., 2003), but it still considered a low LAI 

and is expected to increase as LAI tends to peak when eucalypt forest is around 4-year-

old (Beadle, 1997).  

 

4.2.Root biomass and spatial distribution 

The highest N dose also resulted in the lowest root biomass (Fig. 3). All trees 

sampled for roots were not located side by side with dead trees, so it is more likely that 

the lower FRB found here is at least in part responsible for the higher mortality, even 

though support trees on the soil is not the major function of fine-roots. Considering the 

site soil is a shallow Inceptsol with higher density in deeper layers (Table 1), a well-

developed lateral root system would be essential to protect trees against wind. Whilst 

coarse roots are mainly located near the stump, fine and medium roots spread laterally 

and have good biomass and distribution correlation (Laclau et al., 2013, 2001; Teixeira 

et al., 2002), and may be helping lateral support of those trees, especially because roots 

until 2-mm Ø were sampled here.  

The high nutrient availability may have resulted in needless root expansion under 

the highest dose. In contrast to what we found here, Jourdan et al. (2008) found no effect 

of N fertilization on fine root growth of Eucalyptus grandis plantations in Brazil. They 

used a 120 kg ha-1 N dose and found negligible differences in FRB in the first 0 -30 cm 

of soil compared to control (0 kg ha-1 of N). Fabião et al. (1995) also found no differences 

in fine root eucalypt production due to fertilization or irrigation. Coarse roots and total 

below-ground biomass, in turn, were affected by their treatments.  



71 

 

As fine roots are specialized in acquiring water and nutrient, other variables such 

as length and SRA may be as or more important than total amount of FRB. Indeed, mean 

correlations showed that specific root area was positively correlated with tree growth 

(Table 3). FRB was negatively correlated with tree growth. This mean result needs to be 

evaluated carefully, as it was mostly obtained due to root behavior under 108 kg ha-1 of 

N dose, since FRB, DBH and H increased with increasing N in the smaller doses. So, we 

do not argue that N was limiting and trees had to choose where to allocate C.  

As observed in other studies with eucalypt roots distribution, a horizontal and 

vertical anisotropy was observed (Bouillet et al., 2002; Laclau et al., 2013, 2001), and 

this might have resulted in some fine-root clustering (Fig. 4).  Root spatial distribution 

presented a strong behavior driven by ridge tillage. Although this tillage control, total 

amount of FRB found here are in agreement to other studies that adressed eucalypt roots 

of similar age plantations (Fabião et al., 1995; Jourdan et al., 2008; O’Grady et al., 2005) 

or older (Teixeira et al., 2002; Witschoreck et al., 2003). This indicate that eucalypt fine 

root biomass may stabilize in certain age and vary in different seasons due to their rapid 

turnover (Jourdan et al., 2008; Kätterer et al., 1995; Mello et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 

2002). 

Overall, eucalypt fine roots tend to concentrate in shallower layers, and sharply 

decrease with depth (Bouillet et al., 2002; Laclau et al., 2001; Lourenço, 2009; Rodrigues, 

2013; Teixeira et al., 2002; Witschoreck et al., 2003). Here, roots growing on the ridge 

increased with depth. At planting row position, soil was subsoiled and a ridge of ~ 20 cm 

height was created that might have driven and changed pattern of root distribution. 

Moreover, trees probably invested in deeper roots in ridge area due to the elevated density 

in surrounding areas. In the other positions, FRD peaked in 10 -20 cm layer and then 

decreased. This is probably a result of obstructions found in deeper layers as plinthite and 

other cohesive structure formations were observed. Although differences in FRB among 

N-levels were observed, we could not see a pattern of root distribution being driven by N 

fertilization. 

 

4.3. SOM properties as affected by N levels, litter and tillage 

 Nitrogen had influence on C associated with POM and MAOM, particularly in the 

0 -10 cm soil layer. C and N associated with SOM fractions presented similar responses 

to N fertilization regimes, although effect on N content was less expressive (Table 4). 



72 

 

Their dynamics was tightly correlated (Li et al., 2012), particularly when associated with 

mineral soil fraction (Table 3).  

 Overall, eucalypt afforestation resulted in C and N accrual when compared to 

previous land use. Accrual happened in the top soil layer, especially in POM fractions 

and noteworthy for N-POM, whereas deeper layer (20 -40 cm) remained unchanged or 

presented lower C and N content. Both ?13C-POM and ?13C-MAOM became more 

negative, with ?13C-POM changing faster.  Interestingly, while top soil layers presented 

higher C-POM content with eucalypt afforestation, it also presented a less negative ?13C-

POM. This could be a dilution effect, since a slightly decrease of C-POM in 20 -40 cm 

layer was observed, but at the same time more eucalypt contribution (more negative ?13C) 

was observed (Table1; Table 4). This is an evidence that fresh root input may destabilize 

old deep soil C (Fontaine et al., 2007), and the overall lower root growth and slower 

turnover in deeper layer can explain this decrease of C-POM in deeper layers, since FRB 

was positively correlated with C-POM (Table 3).  

 Afforestation effects on soil C is largely debated in the literature (Binkley et al., 

2004; Binkley and Resh, 1999; Li et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2006; Santana et al., 2015). 

The positive effect of N on soil C pools showed here are in disagreement with some other 

authors who found no effect of N fertilization on soil C pools under eucalypt plantations 

(Binkley et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2012). Binkley et al. 2004 tested much higher N doses 

(300 – 1600 kg ha-1 of N) on development of first-rotation eucalypt forest in Hawaii and 

found no evidence of N altering soil C accrual because losses of old C4-derived C offset 

C3-derived C inputs throughout an 8-year rotation. Here, at 2.75 yr. rotation we observed 

a positive effect of N particularly with 36 kg ha-1 and 48 kg ha-1 of N doses for C-POM 

and C-MAOM, respectively. Although this behavior might change until the end of 

rotation, we hypothesize that effects might be even enhanced, since a nutrient-richer 

cycling is expected (Silva et al., 2013) and therefore a positive effect of combined mineral 

and organic N on soil C pools (Moran et al., 2005). 

 Litterfall exclusion had no effect on soil C and N, although some minor changes 

could be observed. Eucalypt litterfall influence on soil C is poorly studied thus making 

difficult any comparison. Litter might have a positive influence on soil C, but it should 

be restricted to the very top-soil layer (Cotrufo et al., 2015; Souza, 2012) and the 0 -10 

cm sampling used here may have hampered any possible litter effects. Litterfall 

production tends to peak when eucalypt forest is around 4-year-old (Nouvellon et al., 

2012) and may achieve up to 8 Mg ha-1 in a single year (Cizungu et al., 2014; Corrêa et 

al., 2013; Inkotte et al., 2015). The amount of litterfall produced here was around 3.7 Mg 



73 

 

ha-1 yr-1. Hence, it may even double the amount of litter entering the soil and the constant 

input throughout a rotation might alter SOM dynamics and differ from what we found 

here. 

 Differently of litterfall exclusion influence on SOM properties, the adoption of 

ridge tillage notably altered soil C and N pools. It might be a consequence of changing 

root distribution (Fig. 4) and likely breakdown of soil aggregates, changing temperature, 

humidity and therefore C and N accrual and turnover (Fialho, 2016; Oliveira, 2015; 

Williams et al., 2016a, 2016b). Higher C content was observed in row position in both 

POM and MAOM fractions and differences were remarkable especially in 0 -10 cm layer 

(Table 5). It also resulted in more eucalypt-derived C, with significant differences in the 

deeper layer (20 -40 cm), that is probably the consequence of the higher fine-root biomass 

and turnover. This result shows that adoption of a zonal management technique such ridge 

tillage is likely to create different functional zones in the area and therefore drive 

ecosystem functioning. 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

Our results showed that N fertilization alters tree growth and SOM fractions 

properties. A positive change in the slope of growth curve with N addition was observed, 

but differences do not seem to last longer. This indicate that a yearly N supply may be the 

best approach to enhance forest productivity over Inceptsols in Southern Brazil, at least 

during the first years. Differences in SOM fractions properties due to N fertilizations were 

higher, but non-linear, and were correlated with fine-root biomass production and 

turnover. Most of soil C eucalypt-derived came from roots, with negligible effects of litter 

input. Zonal tillage management, i.e. ridge tillage management adopted here, had 

significant influence on soil C and N, probably due to changes in soil aggregation, 

aeration, temperature and humidity and to be driving root distribution along soil surface 

and profile. The best results were achieved with slightly increases (12 and 24 kg ha-1 of 

N) in reference dose (24 kg ha-1), being the 48 kg ha-1 of N the dose that resulted in higher 

stand basal area, fine-root biomass and stable C and N, indicating that it is probably the 

most suitable one to be used under the evaluated conditions.

V. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 
This thesis tried to approach some existing gaps regarding the impact of forest 

operations on soil physical and organic properties, and early stand status in planted 

Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. We hope that results found here can be used to guide 

more accurate decisions regarding sustainability of eucalypt plantation, particularly in 

forest expansion areas where studies are still scarce.  

In summary, it is shown that: 

- Harvest residues (HR) sustainable management could enhance soil C stocks and 

directly alter soil organic matter (SOM) particulate fraction chemistry. HR are could also 

be an important energy source for soil microorganisms and therefore increase C 

sequestration in SOM stable pools. HR directly effects are, however, restricted to the very 

top-soil layer; 

 - The choice of harvesting system and next rotation silvicultural system should be 

done together, since harvesting impacts vary from system to system and might be harmful 

for next rotation development, requiring specific silvicultural techniques to grant forest 

success. Different harvest and silvicultural system might create different soil functional 

zones, enhancing differences between row an inter-row areas, that shall be observed when 

evaluating operations impacts; 

 - Lastly, it’s shown positive although short impacts of N fertilization on initial 

growth of Eucalyptus trees in a new forest expansion area in the country. N addition had 

also positive effects on fine-root biomass and C and N content of SOM fractions. Hence, 

the use of slightly higher N doses than the ones adopted currently may be beneficial. C 

and N content were positively correlated with fine-root biomass. Litter input had no effect 

on SOM properties. Planting operations seems to drive fine-root distribution and create 

soil favorable zones for C input and cycling.
