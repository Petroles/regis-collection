ABSTRACT 

The sea, sea salt aerosol, direct exposure to sunlight and corrosive 

fluids make oil and gas rigs hostile environments for its own 

infrastructure. Metallic pipelines and structural items are being 

progressively replaced by engineering plastics and composite materials 

with high structural efficiency and corrosion resistance. As these 

components require regular inspection and maintenance routines, 

developing non-destructive inspection techniques is required. The high 

cost associated with conducting maintenance in hazardous and difficult 

to access areas, along with the prevalence of premature failure of 

adhesive bonded joints between composite material pipes, creates a 

demand for passive long-term monitoring techniques able to act as a 

bridge between scheduled inspections. This work explores the use of 

fiber optic sensors integrated into the bonded joints as a potential long-

term solution. Several optical fiber sensors were studied and one was 

selected for testing purposes. Sensors were then integrated internally and 

externally to bonded joints between pipes with similar geometry to those 

used in oil and gas rigs. A series of non-destructive tests plus a 

destructive test were realized. Shearography and computed tomography, 

as supporting techniques, corroborate the capacity of the selected 

sensors and devised sensing strategy to detect the presence of voids and 

debondings at various stages of the pipeline’s life cycle. 

 

Keywords: Composite materials, adhesive bonded joints, fiber optic 

sensors, non-destructive testing, structural health monitoring. 
  



 

 

  



 

 

RESUMO 

O mar, a atmosfera salina, a incidência solar e a presença de 

fluidos corrosivos fazem de plataformas de prospecção de petróleo e gás 

ambientes hostis para a infraestrutura nelas instalada. Tubulações e itens 

estruturais metálicos vêm sendo substituídos por plásticos de engenharia 

e materiais compostos com alta eficiência estrutural e resistência à 

corrosão. 

Um material compósito é formado pela combinação, em escala 

macroscópica, de dois ou mais componentes com distintas 

características físicas e química, que quando combinados produzem um 

material cujas propriedades diferem das de seus constituintes. 

Visto que estes componentes também necessitam de inspeção e 

manutenção regular, tem-se a necessidade de desenvolvimento de 

múltiplas técnicas não-destrutivas de avaliação. O que levou à adaptação 

de técnicas como a termografia, holografia, shearografia, 

ultrassonografia e tomografia para a inspeção de compósitos. 

Ainda, o alto custo associado à realização de ensaios em áreas 

classificadas e de difícil acesso, conjuntamente com a prevalência de 

falhas prematuras em uniões adesivadas em tubulações de material 

composto, criam uma demanda por técnicas passivas de monitoramento 

a longo prazo capazes de atuar como uma ponte entre as inspeções 

periódicas. 

A união por adesivo é um processo testado, confiável e 

consolidado para unir substratos metálicos, plásticos, cerâmicos e 

compósitos. Apresenta como vantagens com relação às uniões 

parafusadas ou rebitadas massa reduzida, melhor distribuição de 

esforços mecânicos e melhor resistência à fadiga devido à maior 

flexibilidade e capacidade de inibição da propagação de trincas dos 

adesivos. Apesar disso são de difícil modelagem matemática, difícil 

manutenção e são consideradas como uniões permanentes. Este é o 

processo mais utilizado para unir tubulações de plástico e de compósito, 

tanto em aplicações na construção civil como na indústria. 

O presente trabalho explora a utilização de sensores de fibra 

óptica integrados às uniões adesivadas como potencial solução deste 

problema.  

Foram estudados diversos sensores de fibra óptica, como redes de 

Bragg, interferômetros de Fabry-Pérot e sensores distribuídos com base 

em deflectometria. Alguns sensores capazes de medir múltiplos 

parâmetros também são apresentados. 



 

 

Para a realização de ensaios, sensores de fibra óptica foram 

integrados interna e externamente a uniões adesivadas de tubulações de 

características similares às utilizadas em campo. Um total de doze fibras 

sensoras, contendo 3 redes de Bragg cada foram colocadas internamente 

à camada de adesivo das uniões para medir o campo de deformação 

axial no interior da união. Além disso, fibras mais longas contendo 12 

redes de Bragg foram projetadas para serem enroladas externamente ao 

longo da circunferência das uniões. 

 Uma série de ensaios não-destrutivos foram realizados, 

começando-se por testes de inserção dos sensores. Três uniões 

adesivadas foram instrumentadas, incluindo uma com defeitos 

planejados para fins de comparação. 

Por fim um dos corpos de prova foi ensaiado de maneira não-

destrutiva para avaliar se a instrumentação integrada possui impacto 

negativo nas propriedades mecânicas das uniões. O corpo de prova 

ensaiado falhou em uma região distante da instrumentada, mas mais 

testes precisam ser realizados para que se estabeleça significância 

estatística de que a instrumentação não foi deletéria. 

 Shearografia digital e tomografia computadorizada foram 
utilizadas como técnicas de apoio e corroboraram a capacidade dos 

sensores selecionados e da estratégia de medição adotada para a 

detecção da presença de vazios e falhas de adesão em várias etapas do 

ciclo de vida das uniões. 

 

Palavras-chave: Materiais compósitos, uniões adesivadas, sensores de 

fibra óptica, ensaios não-destrutivos, monitoramento de integridade 

estrutural.

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Motivation 

In applications where crucial system components are frequently 

or constantly in contact with corrosive fluids or atmosphere, such as in 

the oil and gas industry, usage of composite materials in the form of full 

composite-made components and composite fabric reinforcements has 

grown exponentially, due to low weight-to-strength ratio and high 

corrosion resistance inherent to these materials. 

Metallic produced water pipelines on offshore oil platform are 

being systematically replaced by adhesive bonded fiber reinforced 

plastic (FRP) pipelines for their lower weight and high corrosion 

resistance, generating a demand for FRP inspection techniques. 

This lead to heavy investment in adapting and developing 

inspection techniques to ensure the quality and structural integrity of 

composite components. Several NDT techniques have been adapted or 

developed on the last decades to meet this demand, including 

thermography, ultrasonography, radiography, holography and 

shearography. 

Experience acquired over the years at the Metrology and 

Automation Laboratory (LABMETRO) in the Federal University of 

Santa Catarina shows that today, in the oil and gas industry, inspection 

of composite materials is not optimally conducted.  

Access to the inspection site and to the component to be inspect is 

often difficult, as is the case of pipelines that are buried or installed in 

confined spaces on oil platforms. Available technology requires 

experienced personal to interpret measurement results, leading to higher 

inspection costs. Logistical and financial constraints result in inspection 

schedules that are seldom enough to guarantee premature failure will not 

occur. 

A promising new approach is to embed several fiber optic sensors 

into the adhesive layer of the FRP pipes bonded joints for long-term 

strain monitoring. In order to expand the coverage of NDT techniques 

on composite pipelines, this study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of 

this new health monitoring approach.  

In addition to adhesive bonded joints between FRP pipes, it is 

expected that this method can also be used for health monitoring of anti-

corrosion FRP reinforcements and FRP repairs applied to metallic 

pipelines.

1.2 Objectives 

1.2.1 General Objective 

The main objective of this work is to study, propose and evaluate 

a health monitoring solution for adhesive bonded joints between pipes 

utilizing embedded fiber optic sensors. 

1.2.2 Specific Objectives 

Specific objectives can be seen as the stepping-stones, or a set of 

requirements, that paves the road towards the fulfillment of the general 

objective. They can be listed as follows: 

 

? Select a set of fiber optic sensors to be embedded or 
otherwise integrated to the adhesive bonded joint; 

? Determine sensor placement aiming for a balance 
between intrusiveness and coverage; 

? Evaluate the capacity of the devised approach to detect 
and monitor commonly occurring defects; 

? Define procedures and elaborate recommendations to 
conduct tests on adhesive bonded joints between pipes 

with integrated fiber optic sensors. 

 

To properly address all listed objectives a series of adhesive 

bonded joints with integrated instrumentation is to be designed and 

constructed. Tomography and shearography will be used as support 

techniques to better understand collected fiber optics sensors data. 

1.3 Chapter Summary 

This work is structured in six chapters. Chapter two contains a 

brief review on composite materials. The definition of a composite 

material is presented, along with several application examples in the oil 

and gas industry. Some aspects of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) pipes 

such as fabrication, adhesive bonded joints between pipe sections and 

commonly occurring defects are detailed. 

Chapter three consists of a review on optical fibers and optical 

fiber sensors. The reader will come across fiber optics fundamentals and 

a selection of both single-point and distributed optical fiber sensors 



27 

 

capable of single or multi-parameter measurements. Emphasis is given 

to Fiber Bragg Gratings, as they are the sensor of choice in this work. 

Chapter four discusses the methodology behind the experiments 

conducted during this work. Experimental procedures, test sample 

design, instrumentation design and placement plans are detailed. 

Chapter five presents discussions based on the data obtained 

during the execution of the experiments detailed in the previous chapter. 

Sensor embedding procedure is the first discussion point, followed by 

detection of defects in the adhesive layer and the effects of the 

embedded instrumentation on the bonded joint’s strength. 

Chapter six contains the conclusions to this work. First the 

objectives presented on chapter one are compared to the results from 

chapter five to check their completion, then a series of recommendations 

for the continuation and expansion of this work is presented. The 

capabilities and limitations of the proposed health monitoring method 

are discussed as well 

1.4 Test Specimen Material 

This work originally intended to use fiberglass-epoxy composite 

pipes as test specimens. Due to time and money constraints, industrial 

grade CPVC pipes were used instead. The review on composite 

materials and piping systems has been kept as a reference for future 

works. Since this study uses relative strain measurements, it is not 

expected that the change in materials will influence the evaluation of the 

proposed method.

2 COMPOSITE MATERIALS 

Composite is a generic denomination used to describe a 

composition material whose resulting properties differ significantly 

from those of its individual components.  It is obtained by combining 

two or more constituent materials with distinct physical or chemical 

properties. [1][2] 

Differently from an alloy, in which the mixing of constituents 

occurs at atomic scale, mixing occur at macroscopic level in composites 

and so materials remain separated in the final product. [1] 

The use of composites is increasing in various engineering 

applications due to their inherent characteristics. High strength to weight 

ratio, high resistance to corrosion, oxidation and to harsh chemicals such 

as solvents, grease and oil are all examples of desirable properties. [3] 

2.1 Basic Concepts 

In general, one of the constituent materials in a composite form a 

continuous phase called matrix and the other constituents are 

reinforcements, in the form of fibers or particulates, added in to improve 

the matrix properties. Sandwich panels and laminates do not follow this 

structure but are still composites by definition. [4][5] 

Fibers can be made of light elements like carbon or boron, silica 

compounds such as silicon oxide, silicon carbide and silicon nitride. 

Organic materials (C-H-N chains) such as aramid (Kevlar) are also 

commonly used. [4][5] 

Fiber reinforcement represents the major contribution to the 

composite final toughness, strength and stiffness in fiber directions. 

Fibers can be weaved into several different fabric styles, from plain 

weave to satin weave, according to the desired directional properties and 

lay-up conformability. [4][5] 

Particle reinforcement is cheaper and allow for more flexibility in 

the production and forming of the composite. Gains in stiffness, strength 

and toughness are lower comparatively to fibers, but increase in 

hardness and abrasion resistance is unmatched. [6] 
Matrixes may be composed of polymer, metal or ceramic 

materials. It forms the shape of the component, transfers load in and out 

of the reinforcements, protect fibers from environmental harm and from 

damage from nearby fiber failure. [4] 



30 

 

Temperature and environmental resistance, longitudinal 

compression strength, transverse tensile strength and shear strength are 

properties of the composite that are matrix-dominated. [4] 

2.2 Miscellaneous Applications 

The following short list of applications clearly illustrates the 

versatility of composite materials. 

2.2.1 Composite Brakes  

Carbon-composite (CCM) and carbon-ceramic (CCB) discs have 

been used since 1980 in motorsports braking systems. CCM discs are 

made of high performance ceramic matrix composites reinforced with 

carbon fibers. CCB discs (Figure 2-1) follow the same basic structure 

but with an added ceramic friction layer on both braking surfaces. [7] 

 

 
Figure 2-1 - Automotive CCB disc. [8] 

2.2.2 Cemented Carbides 

Cemented carbides are metal matrix composites reinforced with 

carbide particles. Usually tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC) 

and tantalum carbide (TaC). [9][10] 

Originally developed for use in tungsten filament drawing for 

incandescent lamps, cemented carbides were quickly adopted in a 

number of applications for its unique combination of hardness, wear 

resistance and high temperature strength. It is often used on 

metalworking rollers cutting tools and inserts for metal cutting (Figure 

2-2). [9][11][12] 



31 

 

 
Figure 2-2 - Cemented carbide cutting inserts. [13] 

2.2.3 Sandwich Panels 

Although they do not follow the classic monolithic structure, 

sandwich panels are also composites by definition. A sandwich panel is 

composed of a core inserted between two flat plates or laminates. The 

core increases the moment of inertia of the panel with little impact on its 

mass, leading to structures that are highly efficient under axial 

compression and bending. [14][15] 

Sandwich panels are used in applications that require very high 

strength-to-weight ratios, such as aircrafts (Figure 2-3), racing cars, 

marine vehicles, prefabricated houses and optical breadboards. [15][16]

parts made out of composite materials. Adapted from [16]. 



32 

 

2.3 Composite Materials in the Oil and Gas Industry 

In the oil and gas industry, FRPs are more commonly used in the 

form of composite pipelines (Figure 2-4), localized patch repairs and 

anticorrosive patches applied to metallic pipelines, storage tanks (Figure 

2-5) and tanker ships. [17][18][19] 

 

 
Figure 2-4 – Fiberglass-epoxy pipes for marine and offshore applications. [20] 

 

Oil platform and tankers benefit greatly on FRP’s light weight, 

while their inherent corrosion resistance leads to longer lifespan for 

components in contact with oil, gas, maritime atmosphere and produced 

water.  

 
Figure 2-5 – Fiberglass-epoxy anticorrosive patch applied to the bottom of an 

oil storage tank. [17] 



33 

 

Other applications include structural items, composite risers, and 

various sorts of pressure vessels. [21][22][23][24] 

Fiberglass-epoxy pipes are the most commonly used FRP pipes in 

oil platforms, especially in produced water lines. 

2.4 Fabrication of FRP Pipes and Fittings 

2.4.1 Glass Fibers Production Process 

Figure 2-6 shows a schematic representation of glass fibers 

manufacturing process. Sand, aluminum and borax (sodium borate) are 

mixed together and continuously fed to a furnace that heats the mixture 

to 1250 ºC. Molten glass flows through a perforated platinum plate and 

is then drawn to the right diameter. The fibers are cooled with water 

sprays and directed to a treadmill or cylinder to be coated with a 

protective layer that allows posterior handling. Finally, individual 

filaments are united into strands, typically in groups of 204 filaments, 

which are wound and stored.  

 

 
Figure 2-6 – Schematic representation of a glass fiber production line. Adapted 

from [1].  

2.4.2 Filament Winding 

Filament winding is a composite materials production process 

that is greatly suited for axisymmetric components such as pipes and 

most fittings. Multi-axis machines are also available for components that 

are more complex. [4][24][25] 



34 

 

Continuous strands or filaments of fibers are bathed in resin 

before being led to a rotating mandrel, where they are laid down at high 

speed, as illustrated in Figure 2-7. 

 

 
Figure 2-7 - Schematic diagram of filament winding. [25] 

 

Fibers can be laid down with high precision in predefined paths 

by adjusting the angular velocity of the mandrel and the movement 

pattern of a moving platform, as shown in Figure 2-8. [4][24][25] 

 

 
Figure 2-8 - Winding pattern control scheme. [26] 

 

Common patterns are polar, hoop or helical (Figure 2-9). 

Winding angle, fiber tension and the amount of resin in each layer are 



35 

 

the main control parameters to ensure the desired stiffness and strength 

are obtained. [4][24][25] 

 

 
Figure 2-9 - From right to left: Polar, helical and hoop winding. Adapted from 

[25]. 

 

After winding, the composite coated mandrel is removed and 

transported to an oven, if heat curing is needed, or a clean room for 

room temperature curing. The mandrel can be removed and reused or 

remain as part of the composite after the curing process ends. 

[4][24][25] 

2.5 Adhesive Bonded Joints 

Adhesive bonding is a method for joining metals, plastics, 

ceramics and composites in which an adhesive, placed between the 

surfaces to be joined, solidifies to consolidate the union. [27] 

In comparison to classical mechanical joining methods, such as 

screwed or riveted joints, it presents a series of advantages. Bonded 

joints are lighter, cheaper and are more resistant to damage. Fewer parts 

are required to complete the joining process, there is no need to drill the 

adherends and loads are distributed over larger areas. They are more 

flexible and inhibit crack propagation on the adhesive layer, leading to a 

longer fatigue life. [27][28][29] 

Nonetheless, they are difficult to inspect with non-destructive 

methods and all surfaces in contact with the adhesive must be carefully 

cleaned and prepared beforehand. Mechanical properties may change 

due to moisture absorption and service temperature is limited by both 

the adhesive and curing cycle parameters. Since it is difficult to 

disassemble adhesive bonded joints without incurring in irreparable 

damage this is often considered a permanent joining method. [29] 
Specialized literature contains plenty of examples of adhesive 

joints suitable for all kinds of mechanical loads. Some of these 

configurations are shown in Figure 2-10. 



36 

 

 
Figure 2-10 - Several types of adhesive bonded joints. Adapted from [28]. 

2.5.1 The Bell-and-Spigot Joint 

The bell-and-spigot joint is an asymmetric junction where a 

smooth walled bell is sized to accept either a smooth or gasketed pipe 

spigot. Examples of this type of joint are depicted in Figure 2-11. It is 

widely used to join cast iron and ferroalloy pipes, vitrified clay pipes 

and plain, reinforced or asbestos cement pipes. It is also the most used 

method for joining plastic pipes. [30][31] 

 

 
Figure 2-11 - Bonded and gasketed bell-and-spigot joint. Adapted from [32]. 

 

Sealing method varies according to the pipe material and the 

operating pressure in the line. Rubber O-rings, gaskets and mortar with 
sealing rings are adequate for liquid lines pressurized up to  

1.5 MPa (15 bar) and 0.1 MPa (1 bar) for gases. For higher operating 

pressures, welded cast iron pipes or adhesive bonded composite pipes 

must be used. [30][31] 



37 

 

In adhesive bonded joints, the bell’s inner surface and the spigot’s 

outer surface can be cylindrical or conical (tapered).  

2.5.2 Tubular Single Lap Joint 

From Figure 2-11 it is evident that when both surfaces are not 

tapered, the bell-and-spigot joint is very similar to a tubular single lap 

joint (Figure 2-12), which is simpler and has been a subject of study to 

researchers in recent years. 

 

 
Figure 2-12 - Tubular single lap bonded joint. Adapted from [33] 

 

The behavior of tubular single lap bonded joints in FRP pipes to 

axial, pressure and torsional loads have been studied analytically, by 

finite elements method, and experimentally. [33][34][35][36][37] 

Das and Pradhan [33] show that the state of stress in the bonded 

joint is fully tridimensional, due to the free edges, differential elasticity 

and coupling between rotation, stretching and bending. 

Although studies performed by Das [33] and Oh [36][37] 

proposed consistent failure conditions for interfacial failure and 

adhesive failure, the mathematical equations often require the input of 

all three principal strains or up to six stress components. 

2.6 Quality Control and Non-Destructive Inspection 

When compared to metals, composites are more susceptible to 

damage and introduction of defects upon manufacturing and handling. 

In FRPs, defects are usually introduced during manufacturing, mainly 

due to wrong number of composite plies, wrong curing temperature, 

poor resin choice, foreign-body inclusions or poorly sealed vacuum 

bags. [16][38] 



38 

 

When inspecting adhesive bonded joints between FRPs, the most 

common defects are delamination and debonding. These defects have 

various causes, such as trapped air, catalyst mixed in excess to the resin, 

propagation of cracks through the FRP’s matrix and lack of adhesive. 

Commonly occurring defects, their description and most likely 

causes are summarized in [16][17][18]. 
 

Table 2-1 - Commonly occurring defects and their likely cause. [17][18] 

Defect Description Likely Cause 

Delamination Separation between 

layers of a laminate. 

Poor compatibility between 

constituent materials, excess 

use of catalyzer. 

Debonding Separation between 

components/interfaces 

that should be bonded. 

Poor compatibility between 

constituent materials, poor 

control over manufacturing. 

Inclusions Presence of foreign 

objects inside the 

material. 

Improper cleaning of the 

glued surfaces, contaminated 

resin or plies. 

Porosity Presence of numerous 

visible pores. 

Air trapped in resin, 

inclusion of volatile 

substances. 

Chipping Small broken pieces of 

the components in the 

vicinity. 

Bad handling, impact. 

Fiber breakage Presence of ruptured 

fibers. 

Overload, impact. 

Swelling Dimensional changes. Moisture absorption. 

Elongation Axial dimensional 

change 

Overload. 

Fracture Component rupture. Overload. 

 

NDT techniques are preventive tools for diagnosing component 

malfunction, deterioration and failure. Data acquisition for assessing 

structural integrity is conducted in a non-invasive way. [39] 

Despite the existence of a relatively large number of techniques, 

only a few are suitable for inspecting composites due to their 

characteristic anisotropy. In addition to visual inspection, the most used 

NDT techniques for composite are holography [39], radiography [40] 

ultrasonography [41], thermography [42], shearography [43] and 

computed tomography [44].  



39 

 

Shearography and computed tomography are complimentary 

analysis techniques used in this work. 

2.6.1 Computed Tomography 

Computed tomography (CT) is an extension of computed 

radiography. Both techniques make use of differential absorption of  

X-rays by local variations in a material’s density, thickness and/or 

composition. Both use electronic X-ray detectors, outputting digital 

images by default. [44][45][46] 

The difference between the two is that CT latter allows a full 

three-dimensional reconstruction of an object and its internal structure 

by combining multiple radiographic images taken from different angles. 

This can be achieved in two ways: by rotating the object (Figure 2-13) 

or by rotating the X-ray source and detector around the object. 

[44][45][46] 

In FRPs, tomography allows the detection of impact damage, 

crushed core (Figure 2-14) and other internal defects such as 

delamination, porosity and cracks. [44][45][46] 

In this work, CT is used to check the position of embedded 

sensors and artificially inserted defects in bonded joints of test 

specimens.

(left) exhibiting localized crushing of the honeycomb core. [46] 

2.6.2 Digital Shearography 

Shearography is a quasi-common-path laser interferometry 

technique capable of contactless measurement of strain fields. Being a 

quasi-common-path interferometry technique allows the use of short 

coherence length illumination and leads to reduced sensibility to 

environmental disturbances. This makes shearography a robust 

technique for use in the industry and in the field. [47][48] 

The name of this technique comes from its use of speckle pattern 

shearing interferometry. Laser speckle phenomenon (Figure 2-15) 

manifests from the interferometric superposition of coherent light 

scattered by a diffusely reflecting surface. [47] 

 

 
Figure 2-15 - Laser speckle pattern. [49]

Shearography measurement requires the superposition of two 

images from the illuminated surface with a slight shear between them. 

Shearing interferometers are used to simultaneously split and shear the 

reflect wavefront. Lateral shearing interferometers (Figure 2-16) are the 

most common, but is also possible to use radial, rotational and reverse 

shear interferometers. [43][47]

interferometry. Adapted from [43]. 

 

The superposition of the slightly sheared images creates a speckle 

interferogram, which has an intensity distribution directly related to the 

surface’s geometry. When the studied object (Figure 2-17) is subjected 

to a loading, its surface geometry changes and so does the intensity 

distribution (Figure 2-18) of the speckle interferogram. [43][47]

cover of the pressure vessel shown on Figure 2-17. [50] 

 

By capturing a series of speckle interferograms, it is possible to 

extract phase information from the intensity maps (Figure 2-19). 

[43][47]

Subtracting a phase map obtained before applying a load from a 
phase map obtained after a load is applied results in a fringe map 

(Figure 2-20). The fringe map is related to the change in the surface’s 

strain field in response to the applied load.  [43][47]

Internal defects in composite materials are revealed by their effect 

in the surface strain field, as shown in Figure 2-21. [43][48][51]

In this work, shearography is used to study the effects of the 

embedded sensors and artificial defects in the strain fields on the surface 

of the adhesive bonded joints of the test specimens. 

2.7 Structural Health Monitoring 

SHM in composite can be performed in many ways, including 

conventional sensors such as electric strain gages [52], or modern 

methods [53] using different types of sensors and transducers embedded 

in the composite. 

Influence of embedded sensors on the mechanical properties of 

composite components is a controversial topic. Some studies observe up 

to 70% reductions in yield strength, 20% reduction in the modulus of 

elasticity and up to 10% reduction of the performance under tensile load, 

depending on the orientation of the sensors in relation to the fibers in 

composite laminates [54]. Other studies show mixed results on the 

influence depending on size and type of sensor and the constructive 

aspects of the tested composite [54][55][56][57]. There has also been 

reports of minimal or no negative effects [58].  

Despite the mechanical degradation discussion, this approach has 

shown very promising results in several applications, such as detection 

and monitoring of debonding in adhesive bonded joints [59], monitoring 

of strain gradient in adhesive composite joints [60] and life cycle 

monitoring of curved composite parts. [61]

3 FIBER OPTIC SENSORS 

Fiber optic sensors were chosen for this study for having some 

important advantages [62] over electronic sensors, considering the 

context of composite pipelines in off-shore oil and gas rigs: 

 

i. They are small: the typical fiber sensor has an uncoated 
diameter of 125 µm and around double this value for 

coated fibers. Their small frame allows the embedding of 

sensors into delicate composite structures with minimal 

impact on mechanical properties. 

 

ii. With proper choice of coating and connectors fiber sensors 
can be made environmentally rugged, being able to 

withstand the bonded joints fabrication and off-shore 

environments. 

 

iii. They are passive sensors: not needing electrical power 
makes them safe to use in classified environments. 

 

iv. High multiplexing capabilities means simpler and less 
bulky setups. Off-shore oil and gas rigs usually have a 

great number of pipelines grouped in tight spaces. 

3.1 Optical Fibers 

Telecommunications have been revolutionized by fiber optic 

technology as mass production techniques and technical improvements 

led to superior performance and reduced costs. Now a sensing 

revolution is on the making, as engineers combine product outgrowths 

of fiber optic telecom with optoelectronic devices. [63] 

Novel fiber sensors, with the potential of replacing many of the 

existing environmental sensors and fulfilling roles where current sensor 

technology falters, are quickly being researched and developed. [63] 

An optical fiber is a dielectric waveguide capable of transmitting 
optical signals over great distances with attenuation as low as 0.2 dB/km 

[64]. The typical structure of an optical fiber is shown in Figure 3-1.  

 



46 

 

 
Figure 3-1 - Typical structure of a silica optical fiber. Adapted from [65]. 

 

The core is the waveguide itself, a solid glass rod that traps and 

conducts light by total internal reflection. It is usually made of high 

purity silicon dioxide (SiO2). Plastic fibers are also widely used. [65] 

A cladding is not strictly required for transmitting light, but it 

reduces dispersion loss due to discontinuities on the core’s surface, 

provides mechanical protection and prevents contaminants absorption 

into the core. Notice that the index of refraction ?2 of the cladding is 
greater than the index of refraction ?1 of the core. [65] 

Most fibers are coated with a plastic, ceramic or metallic buffer. 

Buffer coatings provide extra mechanical protection by isolating the 

fiber from small irregularities on adjacent surfaces, which would 

otherwise induce microbending loss. It also protects the fiber from 

scratches and abrasion. [65] 

Any light wave coupled into the fiber is heavily attenuated if it 

refracts into the cladding instead of bouncing back by total internal 

reflection. Light rays entering the core of a fiber with uniform index of 

refraction ?1, from a medium with index of refraction ? &amp;lt;?1, are 
transmitted forward as long as they belong to the acceptance cone 

depicted in Figure 3-2. [65]

refraction. Adapted from [65]. 



47 

 

From Snell’s law, total internal reflection will occur for an 

incidence angle ? that satisfies the condition presented in Equation 3.1. 
[65] 

 ???(?) ?

Working backwards from this it is easy to show that the 

maximum value for ?0 can be determined by applying Equation 3.2. 
[65] 

 ? ???(?0,???) = ??1
2 ? ?2

2   ? ?1?2?   (3.2) 

Equation 3.2 also defines the numerical aperture ?? for an 
optical fiber with a uniform index of refraction at its core. The 

parameter ? is the core-cladding index difference, as defined by 
Equation 3.3. [65] 

 ? = 1 ? (
?2

?1? ) 
 (3.3) 

 The approximation on the right side of Equation 3.2 is valid 

when ? ? 1. Typically, for a given value of ?1, ?2 is chosen such that ? 
is equal to 0.01. [65] 

3.1.2 Fiber Types 

Looking at Figure 3-2 from a ray optics perspective, it is evident 

that light entering the fiber with many different angles ?0 &amp;lt;?0,??? can 
be guided. However, the number of guided modes is finite. Solving 

Maxwell’s equation for a circular dielectric waveguide shows that only 

certain modes entering the fiber with ?0 &amp;lt;?0,??? are guided. [63] 
Fibers can be classified according to the number of allowed 

modes and the index of refraction profile in the core region. Figure 3-3 

presents a comparison between conventional optical fiber types. 

As the name suggests, multimode fibers allow a large number of 

guided modes simultaneously. A multimode step-index fiber usually 

allows around 104 individual propagation modes. The number of guided 

modes, or modal volume, ? can be approximated by Equation 3.4 for 
large ? values. [63][65] 

  ? = ?² 2
?   (3.4) 



48

profile. Adapted from [65]. 

 

Where ? is the normalized frequency, as defined by Equation 
(3.5), for a light wave of wavelength ? traveling in a fiber of core radius 
?. [65] 

 ? = (
2??

?
) ??1

2 = (

2??

?
) ??   (3.5) 

Guided modes follow slightly different paths and experience 

slightly different refractive indexes in the core, causing modal 

dispersion. This phenomenon limits the fiber bandwidth, reducing the 

amount of data transmitted per unit of time. [63] 

Multimode graded-index fibers mitigate this problem by 

changing the core index of refraction profile to make the core act as a 

series of lenses that periodically focus the light beam as it propagates 

down the fiber. This technique reduces the amount of individual 

propagation modes down to about 300 for a typical graded-index fiber. 
[63] 

The ultimate solution to manage modal noise and maximize 

bandwidth came in the form of monomode fibers. By greatly reducing 

the core diameter until it approaches the wavelength of the guided light, 



49 

 

diffraction effects dominate and light becomes constrained to propagate 

only along the waveguide axis. When ? ? 2.405 only one mode is 
allowed to propagate, this is referred to as the cutoff condition. [63] 

The monomode fiber described above is not truly monomode in a 

sense that two modes with degenerate polarization states are allowed to 

propagate. There are various solutions to remove this degeneracy and let 

a single linear polarization state propagate. Figure 3-4 shows the most 

common polarization maintaining fibers. [63] 

 

 
Figure 3-4 – Types of polarization maintaining fibers: (a) elliptical core fiber; 

(b) bow-tie stress-induced birefringent fiber; (c) stress-induced birefringent 

fiber using bars. [63] 

 

Elliptical core fibers are the simplest solution for maintaining 

polarization. If the core-cladding index difference is sufficiently high, 

light with linear polarization aligned along the major axis will retain its 

polarization state. [63] 

Fabricating a fiber with built-in stress causes stress birefringence, 

i.e., the stress induces an index of refraction difference between a major 

and a minor axis. Light propagating along the major axis preserves its 

polarization state. [63] 

There is also a type of fiber called polarizing fiber that is 

designed to induce high transmission loss for undesired polarization 

states, allowing only a single state to propagate. This kind of fiber is 

very useful in optical sensing applications that rely on the control of the 

polarization state. [63] 

3.1.3 Signal Attenuation 

There are three main attenuation mechanisms for light signals 

traveling through an optical fiber. Absorption, which is related to the 

fiber material; scattering, which is dependent on both fiber material and 



50 

 

waveguide imperfections; and radiative losses, originated from 

perturbations of the fiber geometry. [63][65] 

Total absorption is the combination of effects from three distinct 

absorption mechanisms: absorption by atomic defects in the glass 

composition, extrinsic absorption by impurity atoms and intrinsic 

absorption by basic fiber constituent atoms. [65] 

Atomic defects in the glass structure are missing molecules, high-

density atom clusters and oxygen defects. Absorption loss from atomic 

defects is negligible in comparison with the other absorption 

mechanisms under normal circumstances, but can become significant 

(Figure 3-5) if the fiber is subjected to ionizing radiation. [63][65] 

 

 
Figure 3-5 – Left: Induced absorption loss due to steady exposure to ionizing 

radiation (1 rad(Si) = 100 erg/g = 0.01 J/kg). Right: Recovery as a function of 

time after radiation exposure has ceased. Adapted from [65]. 

 

The presence of OH- (water) and transition metal ions impurities 

in the fiber is the dominant absorption mechanism. Even 1 ppm 

concentration of these impurities can lead to absorption losses up to 4 

dB/km. Improvements to the fiber fabrication process, to significantly 

reduce the presence of contaminants, were paramount in achieving the 

low-loss fibers (0.2 dB/km) in use today. Table 3-1 contains absorption 

loss information for commonly occurring impurities. [63][65] 

Intrinsic loss occurs due to absorption of photons by electronic 

and vibrational transitions in the fiber. Electronic transitions occur 

mainly in the ultraviolet for Si based fibers and its effects decrease 

exponentially as wavelength increases. Vibrational transition losses are 

stronger in the 8 to 12 ?? region of the spectrum. [63][65] 
 

 



51

transition metal impurities. [65]

Scattering loss arises from fluctuations of the index of refraction 

due to compositional fluctuations, microscopic density variations, 

structural inhomogeneities and/or defects introduced in the fiber 

manufacturing process. The index of refraction fluctuation is small 

compared with the wavelength, causing Rayleigh scattering of the 

transmitted light [63][65]. For single component glass, the scattering 

loss at a given wavelength ? can be approximated by Equation 3.6 [65].  

 ?????? =
8?3

3?4
?8?2???? ??   

 (3.6) 

Where ? is the photoelastic coefficient, ?? is the Boltzmann’s 
constant, ?? is the isothermal compressibility of the material, and the 
fictive temperature ?? is the temperature at which the density 
fluctuations are frozen into the glass as it solidifies after the fiber 

drawing process. 

Note that ?????? in Equation 3.6 is given in nepers (base e units); 
one can convert it to dB for optical power attenuation calculations by 

multiplying ?????? by 10 log ? = 4.343. [65] 
Finally, radiative losses occur due to macroscopic and 

microscopic bending. Microbending locally disrupts total internal 

reflection at the core-cladding boundary, leading to light leakage as 

shown in Figure 3-6. [63][65]  

 



52 

 

 
Figure 3-6 - Microbending loss mechanism. Adapted from [65]. 

 

Macroscopic bending leads to power loss by two distinct 

mechanisms. The first loss mechanism is similar to microbending loss, 

where the local curvature of the fiber can lead to partial reflection at the 

core-cladding interface, as illustrated in Figure 3-7. [63] 

 

 
Figure 3-7 – Bending induced loss by partial internal reflection. [63] 

 

The second loss mechanism can be explained by modal analysis 

of the propagating light wave. Light ray representation is just an 

approximation of the behavior of light in a waveguide, in reality a 

propagating mode is not fully restrained to the core of the fiber. Any 

bound core mode has an evanescent field tail in the cladding that moves 

with the field in the core and decays exponentially with the distance 

from the core. A guided mode field in a curved optical waveguide is 

represented in Figure 3-8. [65] 

From Figure 3-8 it is evident that the field tail further away from 

the center of curvature has to travel at a higher speed to keep up with the 

field in the core. At a distance ?? from the center of the core, the field 
tail has to move at the speed of light to follow the core field. Since the 

field would need to move faster than the speed of light for ? &gt; ??, 
which is not possible, the optical energy in this region radiates away. 

[65]

3.1.4 Pulse Dispersion 

As it propagates through a waveguide, a light signal not only 

experiences attenuation but it also becomes increasingly distorted. Light 

pulses get progressively wider and can superpose with adjacent pulses. 

This pulse widening is referred as pulse dispersion or pulse spreading, 

and it can be explained by examining how the waveguide affects the 

group velocity of guided modes. [65] 

Dispersion effects can be divided in three categories; intermodal 

dispersion, intramodal dispersion and polarization mode dispersion. 

Intermodal dispersion is a distortion mechanism exclusive to 

multimode fibers. Figure 3-3 illustrates that each mode propagates in a 

slightly different path inside the fiber. Some modes follow a longer path 

to get from one point along the fiber axis to another point, and thus have 

lower axial group velocity. Slower modes lag behind faster modes and 

the multimode pulse broadens. The maximum pulse broadening ??, 
which corresponds to the difference between the time the fastest mode 

and the slowest mode take to travel down a fiber of length ?, can be 
determined by Equation 3.7. [65] 

 
 

?? = ???? ? ???? =
??1

2

??2
? 

 
(3.7) 

Where ? is the fiber length and ? is the core-cladding index 
difference as defined in Equation 3.3. 



54 

 

Intramodal dispersion occurs within a single mode, it is mainly 

caused by material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. Material 

dispersion is derived from the fact that the index of refraction of the 

fiber core is a function of wavelength, and that every light source has 

non-zero spectral width. Each wavelength propagates with a slightly 

different speed, broadening the pulse. [65] 

Waveguide dispersion occurs because part of the optical power 

propagates in the cladding, as shown in Figure 3-8. Since the core and 

the cladding have different refractive indexes, light moves at different 

speeds in these regions, broadening the pulse. This effect is more 

pronounced in monomode fibers, in which the reduced core diameter 

means more light propagates in the cladding. [65] 

Polarization mode dispersion is a direct result of birefringence 

along the fiber. Birefringence can be caused by intrinsic factors, such as 

built-in stress or circularity error in the core; and extrinsic factors, like 

lateral compression, torsion or flexure. Under these conditions 

orthogonal polarization modes will undergo dispersion as they 

experience distinct refractive indexes, as represented in Figure 3-9. [65] 

 

 
Figure 3-9 - Polarization mode dispersion along birefringent fiber. Adapted 

from [65]. 

3.2 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) 

The phenomenon of photosensitivity in optical fibers, in which 

fiber gratings are based on, was first observed in 1978 during 

experiments with germanium doped silica fibers. Germanium is the 

most used dopant in low loss fused silica optical fibers to raise the 

core’s index of refraction. As it replaces silicon atoms in the glass 

structure, germanium creates structural defects. Ultraviolet radiation can 



55 

 

modify the nature of the defects, leading to changes in the local 

refractive index. [64] 

Since then fiber gratings applications on telecommunications and 

sensors has been widespread. Applications of this technology include 

stabilization of laser diodes to pump fiber light sources, repeater links in 

telecommunication lines, wavelength division multiplexing, dispersion 

compensation on long distance fiber links and a multitude of grating-

based fiber sensors. [63][64] 

3.2.1 Fundamentals 

In their 1978 study, Hill et al. [66] describe how standing wave 

patterns, from a visible argon-ion laser launched into an optical fiber 

and back-reflected from the fiber end, created a periodic modulation of 

the core refractive index that acts as a reflection filter. This laid the 

foundation for fiber reflection gratings research. 

While research on photosensitivity and reflection grating writing 

with transmitted light continued, Meltz et al. [67] demonstrated a 
reflection grating for visible light written with interfering UV beams 

external to the optical fibers, making modern compact high-reflectivity 

fiber Bragg gratings possible. 

Figure 3-10 illustrates what happens when a broadband signal 

traveling down an optical fiber passes through a FBG. The FBG acts as 

a passive narrowband reflection filter. The resulting signal can be 

analyzed from both ends of the fiber, as the main parameter of interest is 

the peak reflected wavelength or the corresponding transmission local 

minimum wavelength, usually referred as the Bragg wavelength ??. 
The value of ?? is directly related to intrinsic FBG parameters: 

the grating period and refractive index change; and extrinsic factors 

such as strain and temperature. By tracking how ?? varies to changes in 
strain and temperature it is possible to use the FBG as a sensor and 

measure these changes. 

3.2.2 Fabrication 

The grating writing method used by Meltz et al. [67] is referred 
as holographic method. An amplitude division interferometer is used to 

divide and recombine an UV beam, the resulting interference pattern 

creates a periodic modulation of the refractive index in the fiber core, as 

shown in Figure 3-11. 

 



56 

 

 
Figure 3-10 - Reflected and Transmitted Spectrum of a fiber Bragg grating. [53] 

 

 
Figure 3-11 – Typical setup for holographic writing of Bragg gratings. [64] 

 

Substitution of the classic holographic setup for a phase mask and 

a set of mirrors (Figure 3-12) resulted in a much more flexible writing 

method. By rotating and moving the mirrors, it is easy to adjust the 

grating length and period. [64] 

Grating inscription automation is available in the form of draw 
towers (Figure 3-13), a process in which fiber drawing and grating 

inscription processes are synchronized. [68]

3.2.3 Strain and Temperature Measurement 

As discussed in the previous sections, FBGs are narrowband 

reflection filters with a well-defined peak reflected wavelength ?? that 
shifts when strain or temperature varies. 

By modelling the periodic index of refraction modulation as 

multiple layers (Figure 3-14) with slight different refractive indexes, it is 

possible to derive how ?? responds to strain and temperature variations 
without resorting to complicated waveguide modal analysis. [69] 

 

 
Figure 3-14 - Multiple reflections in a multilayer structure. [69] 

 

As light traverses the layered structure of mean index of 

refraction ?0, it experiences partial reflection in each interface between 
the regions of higher and lower refractive index. These multiple 

reflections can interfere with each other and the wavelength of 

maximum reflectivity ??  will be the one with strongest constructive 
interference. It can be shown that for this model ?? is given by Equation 
3.8, where ? is the period of the refractive index modulation. [69] 

 ?? = 2?0?  (3.8) 

For an optical fiber, the only difference is that instead of ?0 each 
guided mode experiences a slightly different effective index of 

refraction ???, so Equation 3.8 can be rewritten as Equation 3.9. [69] 

 ?? = 2??? ?  (3.9) 

After partial differentiation of Equation 3.9, the change in ?? as a 
function of changes in temperature ?? and grating section length ?? is 
given by Equation 3.10. [70]

???

????

??

Equation 3.10 is then usually reduced and linearized for ??, 
transforming into Equation 3.11, where  is the strain component 

parallel to the axis of the FBG, ?? is the strain-optic tensor, ?? is the 

coefficient of thermal expansion and ?? the thermo-optic coefficient for 

the optical fiber. [70][71] 

 
???
??

(3.11) 

The coefficients in Equation 3.11 can be determined 

experimentally or derived from the properties of the fiber material. 

Typical values for (?? + ?? ) and (1 ? ??) are, respectively,  

7.64 x 10?6 ??1 and 0.769. [71] 

3.2.4 Multi-Parameter FBGs 

Equation 3.11 shows that a single FBG sensor does not 

discriminate between temperature and strain variations. Both parameters 

influence ??? directly in a non-dissociable way. 
Like regular strain gages, there are many situations where 

compensating for temperature is important. Continuous research on fiber 

grating technology and optical fiber sensors led to many solutions to this 

problem, both in the form of temperature independent and multi-

parameter sensors. 

Frazão et al. [72] and Kinet et al. [73] compiled a comprehensive 

list of multi-parameter optical fiber sensors based on grating technology. 

Many more sensor configurations can be found in specialized literature, 

but not all can be readily used in this work. Three promising (in the 

context of this work) multi-parameter configurations are discussed in the 

following paragraphs. 

Mawatari &amp;amp; Nelson [74] further explore a multi-parameter 

configuration (Figure 3-15) that uses two superposed Bragg gratings 

written in a birefringent polarization maintaining fiber. Their linear 

system model has good longitudinal strain prediction capability (error 

&amp;lt;10%) but poor transverse strain prediction capability (error of 10-

100%). The paper also details a generalized non-linear model with 

greatly improved results (measurement error &amp;lt;3%). 



60 

 

 
Figure 3-15 - Multi-parameter sensor configuration with dual Bragg gratings in 

polarization maintaining fiber. [74] 

 

 

With two gratings and the birefringence, this sensor has four 

independent reflection peaks, as illustrated in Figure 3-16. Subscripts ‘2’ 

and ‘3’ are in relation to the axis defined in Figure 3-15, while ‘a’ and 

‘b’ refers to the 1300 nm grating and 1550 nm grating respectively. 

 

 
Figure 3-16 - Quadruple reflection peaks from the dual grating birefringent fiber 

sensor. [74] 

 

The spectral shift of each peak can then be used in a linear system 

to determine temperature and strain normal to the axis q1, q2 and q3, in 

the form of Equation 3.12, where the coefficients Kij must be 

determined experimentally. [74]

(3.12) 

Valdivielso et al. [75] demonstrated a strain and temperature 

sensor using a FBG in a fiber coated with thermochromic material in 

one end (Figure 3-17). 



61 

 

The semi-transparent thermochromic material at the fiber’s tip 

acts as a partial mirror. Reflectivity of the interface with the fiber is a 

function of the thermochromic material’s refractive index, which in turn 

is temperature dependent. By measuring the optical power shift of the 

back reflection at the fiber tip (Figure 3-18), it is possible to determine 

the temperature, with an accuracy of 0.153 ºC in the range from 20 ºC to 

80 °C, and correct ??? for a pure strain measurement.

FBG and thermochromic material. Adapted from [75].

temperature on the FBG-thermochromic material system. [75] 



62 

 

Jung et al. [76] used a FBG in series with an erbium-doped fiber 

amplifier (EDFA), as shown in Figure 3-19, to discriminate between 

temperature and strain. The deviations of strain and temperature were 

18.2 ?  and 0.7 °C over ranges of 0-1200 ?  and 45-150 °C. 
 

 
Figure 3-19 - Experimental setup for simultaneous measurement of strain and 

temperature with a FBG and EDFA. [76] 

 

EDFA spontaneous emission power varies almost linearly with 

temperature, providing a solid base for measuring temperature to correct 

??? [76]. This is evident when analyzing the transmitted power of the 
EDFA/FBG system shown in Figure 3-20. Although this is a bulky 

setup, the authors later reported [77] a compact setup, achieved by 

writing the FBG in an erbium-ytterbium-doped fiber instead of using a 

separated EDFA. This setup had deviations of strain and temperature of 

55.8 ?  and 3 °C over ranges of 0-1100 ?  and 50-180 °C.

3.3 Fiber Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (FFPI) 

3.3.1 Fundamentals 

A Fabry-Pérot interferometer consist of an optical cavity 

delimited by a pair of partial reflecting surfaces [78], as depicted in 

Figure 3-21. 

 

 
Figure 3-21 - Fabry-Perót Interferometer. [78] 

 

What happens to light propagating across the Fabry-Perót cavity 

depends on the proportion between its wavelength and the cavity length. 

If the cavity length is an integral number of half-wavelengths (Figure 

3-22) the cavity is said to be resonant and light is strongly transmitted 

through. Otherwise, it is non-resonant and transmission is attenuated. 

[78] 

 

 
Figure 3-22 - Resonant Fabry-Pérot interferometer. [78] 

 

The cavity length ? can then uniquely define resonant 
wavelengths, as shows Equation 3.13, where ? is a positive non-zero 
integer. [78] 



64 

 

 ? =
2?

?
 

 
(3.13) 

By substituting ? = ?/? in Equation 3.13, where ? is the speed 
of light inside the cavity, the frequency ??  of the k-th resonating 
wavelength is given by Equation 3.14.  

 ?? = ?
?

2?
 

 
(3.14) 

And Equation 3.15 gives the value of  ??  for the (k+1)th mode. 

 ??+1 = (? + 1)
?

2?
 

 
(3.15) 

Therefore the free spectral range ??, that is, the frequency 
difference between consecutive e resonating modes (i.e. transmission 

peaks) is also defined by ? in Equation 3.16. [78] 

 ?? =
?

2?
 

 
(3.16) 

 In the same way the cavity length defines the resonating 

wavelengths, the reflectance ? of the partial reflecting surfaces 
determine how broad and well-defined transmission peaks are. A useful 

parameter to quantify this is the finesse ?, as defined by equation 3.17. 
[63] 

 ? =
4?

(1 ? ?)2
 

 
(3.17) 

Figure 3-23 shows the impact of ? in the transmission spectrum 
of a Fabry-Pérot interferometer.  

In optical fibers, FPIs can be easily made both intrinsically to the 

fiber with reflective splices, or extrinsically by inserting two separated 

pieces of fiber into an external spacer. [63] 

3.3.2 Strain and Temperature Measurement 

The most intuitive way of measuring with FFPIs is to exploit the 

relationship between transmission (or reflection) peaks and cavity 

length. [79] 



65

Then, using ? = ?/?:

(3.19) 

Finally, it is easy to get to Equation 3.20 from Equation 3.19. 

Note that it is being assumed that the refractive index difference for the 

two wavelengths is negligible and thus ? is the same for both. 

 ? =

By measuring ?? in relation to the nominal cavity length ?0, strain

3.3.3 Hybrid FFPI-FBG 

Equation 3.21 is very similar to Equation 3.11 and reveals the 

same strain/temperature discrimination problem. 

Kang et al. [71] demonstrated a solution to this problem by 

proposing a hybrid FFPI-FBG sensor. As shown in Figure 3-24, the 

FFPI comes in an extrinsic configuration. 

 

 
Figure 3-24 - Hybrid FFPI/FBG temperature and strain sensor. [71] 

 

The FBG in this hybrid sensor is insensitive to mechanical strain. 

Temperature can be measured directly with the FBG and used to extract 

mechanical strain from the FFPI’s response. 

3.4 Reflectometry Based Distributed Sensors 

3.4.1 Fundamentals 

Reflectometry based sensing extracts strain and temperature 

information along an optical fiber by analyzing backscattered light. 

 Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques are 

based on time of flight of short light pulses to determine what position 

along the fiber length is being interrogated. Although capable of 

distributed sensing, resolution is often limited to a few meters for 

OTDR, making it impractical for what this work proposes. [63] 

Alternatively, Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) 

can provide distributed sensing with spatial resolution in the order of 

tens of micrometers. [80][81] 

3.4.2 Strain and Temperature Measurement 

The typical OFDR setup uses a tunable laser source and a Mach-

Zehnder or similar interferometer (Figure 3-25) to measure the Rayleigh 

backscattering profile along the optical fiber. [80][81] 



67 

 

Varying the frequency of the laser source results in a periodic 

signal in the detector. The frequency of the generated signal is directly 

related to the distance to the source of the backscatter. The further down 

the fiber, the higher is the signal frequency. [80][81] 

The detector receives backscatter information from the entire 

fiber at once, so the frequency components of the signal must be 

separated using a Fourier Transform to calculate Rayleigh backscatter as 

a function of position along the fiber. Extracted frequency data is then 

divided in small parts, usually equivalent to a few millimeters or less of 

fiber length, to be analyzed. [80][81] 

 

 
Figure 3-25 - OFDR setup with tunable laser and a Mach-Zehnder 

interferometer. [80] 

 

As discussed earlier in this chapter, Rayleigh scattering is caused 

by small fluctuations in the refractive index of the fiber’s core due to 

imperfections or inclusions in the glass. 

When strained or subjected to a change in temperature, these 

fluctuations change slightly, causing a shift in the frequency spectrum, 

as illustrated in Figure 3-26. [80][81] 

It is evident that the behavior of the backscatter profile is very 

similar to a FBG, showing well-defined spectral shifts. In a way this 

technique uses the entire fiber as a collection of small FBGs adjacent to 

each other. [80][81] 



68 

 

An application for distributed temperature measurement with 

OFDR [80]  is shown in Figure 3-27, while Figure 3-28 shows the 

results of a strain measurement along the top of a beam subjected to a 

four point bending test [81].

fiber segment. [81]

4 METHODOLOGY 

In section 1.4 it is disclosed that fiberglass epoxy pipes were to 

be used as test specimens for the experiments. The experiments and the 

instrumentation were designed to match them, however pipe material 

and geometry had to be changed. 

This chapter details the original specimens design, based on the 

product manuals of the fiberglass-epoxy components supplier, followed 

by the experiments required to validate the CPVC substitute and 

adaptations to best utilize the fiber sensors that were acquired.  

4.1 Experiments Design 

To properly design meaningful experiments, from which useful 

data can be extracted, it is first needed to determine what stages of the 

pipeline lifecycle, on the perspective of the end user, are worth 

monitoring. 

4.1.1 Pipeline Lifecycle Analysis 

Some suppliers provide installation services, but all clients want 

assurance that the installation, either self-made or by a third-party, is 

flawless. This stage can be divided into two sub-stages: assembling 

bonded joints and assembling pipeline sections. The bonding process 

can introduce defects such as voids, lack of adhesive and debonding. 

Assembling the pipeline may introduce unwanted stress in the pipes due 

to poorly designed fixtures or excessive use of force to correct 

misalignments. Both situations can severely compromise the integrity of 

the pipeline and must be observed. 

Overloads, water hammer, material fatigue and other mishaps 

during operation can result in catastrophic failure or aggravation of pre-

existing defects. Premature failure can incur in high financial and 

environmental costs, while preventive and corrective maintenance also 

have associated costs. Long term monitoring during this stage can have 

significant impact in lowering costs and risks of running an oil and gas 

rig. 

Quality control of pipes and fittings fabrication is of interest of 
the supplier, and so will not be an object of study in this work.  

After determining that the stages of interest are joint fabrication, 

piping systems installation and operation, it is interesting to look how 

current quality control standards deal with this problem. 



72 

 

4.1.2 Preexisting Standards 

Norsok M-622, ISO 14692-4 and NBR 15921-4 standards for 

glass reinforced plastic piping systems already specify hydrostatic 

testing procedure for piping spools, prefabricated adhesive bonded joints 

and field made adhesive bonded joints. They also detail procedures and 

acceptance criteria for ultrasonic and radiographic testing of bonded 

joints. 

To keep the monitoring strategy proposed in this work as 

unobtrusive as possible, it has been decided to use the pre-existing 

hydrostatic tests as the mean to evaluate the adhesive bonding process 

with the integrated sensors. This also benefits the long-term sensing 

strategy, as loading during operation will be heavily influenced by 

operating pressure. Pipe systems assembly is therefore excluded from 

this analysis and left for a future work. 

Having decided on hydrostatic pressure tests, the number of tests 

and a few other details must be discussed. 

4.1.3 Proposed Tests 

There is a better chance of successfully detecting defects internal 

to the adhesive bonded joint if the sensors are embedded into it. Since 

this is an unconventional procedure, a few sensor embedding tests must 

be made for validation purposes. It is expected that computed 

tomography of adhesive bonded joints with embedded sensors can 

provide enough information to validate this procedure. Instrumentation 

must be allocated for at least two insertion tests. 

It is important to compare the data provided by the sensors 

embedded in a pristine joint and one with purposefully inserted defects, 

to verify how they respond to the presence of defects. This can be 

thought as defect detectability test. There is an ongoing research at 

Labmetro for the development of a digital shearography system to 

inspect composites and the latest shearography system will also be used 

during this test to compare defect detectability. 

Section 2.7 presents a discussion on how the presence of 

embedded sensors can affect mechanical properties of composites and 

adhesive bonded joints. By gradually increasing internal pressure until 
failure occurs and comparing maximum achievable pressure of joints, 

with and without embedded sensors, the impact of the fibers in the 

pressure rating can be evaluated. At least three tests for each condition 

are required for statistical significance. 



73 

 

4.1.4 Summarizing Design Decisions 

For a clearer understanding of what has been discussed in this 

section, all experiments design decisions are summarized below: 

 

? Monitoring pipeline assembly process has been left out 
in favor of joint fabrication and long-term operation 

monitoring. 

 

? Defect detectability tests and impact on pressure rating 
tests will be executed with hydrostatic loading to better 

harmonize with pre-existing quality control standards; 

 

? Two sensor embedment tests are to be performed to 
validate insertion strategy. CT scans will provide the 

needed data; 

 

? Detectability tests will consist of comparing strain 
information from a pristine joint to another with planned 

defects. Digital shearography will be used for 

comparison purposes and CT will provide additional 

information; 

 

? Six adhesive bonded joints, half with embedded sensors 
and the other half without sensors, will be pressurized 

until failure to determine the impact, if any, of the 

embedded sensors in the joint’s pressure rating; 

 

4.2 Test Specimen Design 

Fiberglass-epoxy pipes with 150 mm (6”) nominal diameter and 

adhesive bonded bell and spigot joints, such as the one in Figure 4-1, 

have been well studied before in Labmetro for the digital shearography 

research programs. 

In this configuration the spigot’s extremity is shaved to create a 
1.5 to 2.0 mm radial clearance in relation to the bell, which leaves 

plenty of space for the optical fiber sensors to be inserted into the 

adhesive layer. 



74 

 

 
Figure 4-1 - Fiberglass-epoxy pipe with adhesive bonded bell and spigot joint. 

 

This particular pipe and fittings product line is bonded using a bi-

component epoxy-based adhesive. 

Steel blind flanges, with a central threaded hole for hydraulic 

connections (Figure 4-2), are available from previous projects to be used 

with new test specimens for hydrostatic testing. 

 

 
Figure 4-2 - Steel blind flange fixed to the flanged end of a fiberglass-epoxy 

pipe. 

 

The simplest specimen design is a straight pipe section, with a 

single bell and spigot joint in the center, flanged ends and with total 

length that can fit into the available industrial CT machine. This design 

is illustrated in Figure 4-3. 



75 

 

 
Figure 4-3 - Straight 150 mm (6") pipe with a single bell and spigot joint. 

 

Considering two test specimens for sensor embedding tests, two 

for the comparison between pristine and defective joints, and two sets of 

three specimens for destructive testing, the total amount of test 

specimens is ten. 

After designing the specimen and determining how many are 

needed, the company that provided some specimens for previous 

projects, including the one depicted in Figure 4-2, was contacted and 

agreed to provide the specimens for academic research purposes in 

exchange for full test result disclosure. 

4.3 Instrumentation Design 

This study is starting a new line of research in the Federal 

University of Santa Catarina where the main objective is to evaluate the 

feasibility of using embedded optical fiber sensors for SHM of adhesive 

bonded joints in pipelines. A good approach is to start with a simple 

single parameter FBG, evaluate its strong points and shortcomings, and 

propose a better sensing element for future works. 

The reasoning behind the embedded instrumentation is that the 

presence of defects disrupts the strain distribution in the bonded joint. 

By measuring strain in various locations, compounding them into an 

approximation of the strain field and looking for spots with abnormal 

strain changes, it is possible to detect the presence of defects such as 

debonding or lack of adhesive 



76 

 

From this perspective, instrumentation was designed accordingly 

to the geometrical characteristics of the test specimens to provide good 

strain measuring coverage without employing an excessive number of 

optical fibers that could compromise the joint’s mechanical properties 

Relevant geometrical characteristics are insertion depth, which is 

the length of the spigot that is inserted into the bell, and spigot diameter, 

which defines its circumference. Geometry discontinuities in both 

extremities of the inserted section leads to regions with stress 

concentration. Figure 4-4 contains a cross-section representation of the 

spigot with those characteristics pointed out.  

Insertion length can be used to determine the length of a sensing 

fiber with FBGs embedded axially into the adhesive layer of the joint, 

while the circumference provides the circumferential separation between 

fibers for different number of fibers per joint. Accordingly to the 

supplier’s product manual, for a pipe with 6” nominal diameter, 

insertion depth is 57 mm and mean spigot diameter 166.4 mm. A mean 

diameter of 166.4 mm is equivalent to a mean circumference of 

522.76 mm.  

 

 
 

Figure 4-4 - Spigot cross-section indicating insertion depth, spigot diameter and 

stress concentration areas. 

 

The circumferential separation between two consecutive fibers is the length of 

the arc between them, as shown in Figure 4-5. Table 4-1 
Table 4-1 contains the circumferential separations values and 

number of fibers in a full circle for some separation angles. There is a 

compromise between circumferential separation and number of fibers 

per bonded joint. Smaller separation between fibers results in better 

strain sensing coverage, but more fibers raises costs and can have 

deleterious effects on joint pressure rating. Taking these factors into 

account the value of twelve fibers per joint is a good middle ground. 



77 

 

 
Figure 4-5 - Schematic representation of circumferential separation between 

optical fibers.

Higher stress in the stress concentration regions makes 

monitoring them especially important. One FBG must be placed near 

these points, but not too close to the borders or it can be damaged during 

the assembly process. 

Utilizing only one FBG at each stress concentration points would 

leave a relatively big sensing void in the middle of the inserted section, 

considering the typical grating length of about 5 mm. Taking into 

account the number of fibers per bonded joint and the total of seven 

instrumented joints, the total number of sensors increases very fast for 

each FBG included between the other two. So, considering that the 

available financial resources must cover all sensors, a single FBG was 

added between the others. 

The resulting three FBG array (Figure 4-6) is also provided with 

a 0.9 mm loose tube and a FC/APC connector. This tube is intended to 

protect the unembedded section and prevent the fiber from breaking at 

the point it leaves the adhesive.  



78 

 

The chosen buffer coating material is polyimide, as it is easily 

available on the market, can withstand the adhesive cure temperature of 

about 100 ºC and is chemically compatible with epoxy adhesives. [82] 

 
Figure 4-6 - Three FBG array with loose tube and FC/APC connector. 

 

In order to avoid confusion when embedding and interrogating a 

set of twelve fibers, each fiber in a set has three FBGs with unique 

nominal Bragg wavelength combinations. These combinations are made 

from six possible values, which is the smallest pool size that allows for 

at least twelve unique combinations: 1530 nm, 1535 nm, 1540 nm, 1545 

nm, 1550 nm and 1555 nm. The twelve combinations in each set are 

listed in Table 4-2. 

 
Table 4-2 - Nominal Bragg wavelength combinations per set of twelve fibers.

10 1530 1535 1545 

11 1535 1540 1550 

12 1540 1545 1555 

 

It is also interesting to investigate if FBGs integrated to the outer 
side of the bell and spigot joint can also detect the presence of defects.  

A sub-surface defect can produce detectable disturbances in the 

strain field at the outer surface; this effect is exploited with optical 

interferometric techniques such as holography and shearography, as 

shown in Chapter 2. 



79 

 

For this purpose, a longer chain of FBGs has been designed to be 

wrapped around the circumference of the bell’s outer surface. The bell’s 

external circumference was measured from Figure 4-1 pipe using a 

measuring tape to be approximately 600 mm. To match the number and 

position of the axial fibers, this longer fiber was given twelve FBGs 

equally spaced by 50 mm.  

The longer fiber is also polyimide coated and has a FC/APC 

connector. Its nominal Bragg wavelengths are distributed between 1530 

nm and 1557.5 nm, with uniform 2.5 nm difference between adjacent 

sensors. 

4.4 CPVC Test Specimen 

Unfortunately, just after the designed instrumentation was bought 

and delivered, the company that originally agreed to supply the test 

specimens contacted Labmetro dismissing the deal. As resources for 

acquiring new test specimens were scarce, the first alternative was to 

look for readily available low cost PVC or other similar material pipes 

that usually have bonded joints. 

The main concern was finding products with similar dimensions 

to the fiberglass-epoxy pipes, so that the sensors could still be used 

without complicated adaptations. 

A promising industrial CPVC piping systems line of products 

was then prospected. Insertion depth was 57.5 mm for 4” nominal 

diameter pipes and fittings, practically the same depth the embedded 

instrumentation was designed for. All available 6” CPVC piping 

implements had insertion depths far longer than 57 mm. 

The use of a smaller diameter is an interesting change, since 

smaller diameters lead to smaller circumferential separation between 

fibers, making for a better sensing coverage. However, the longer FBG 

chains, designed to be wrapped around the 6” joint, no longer has 

sensors matching the position of embedded fibers. 

The last problem that needed to be addressed was the 

particularities of the adhesive bonding process between PVC and CPVC 

pipes.  

PVC and CPVC adhesives are solvents, the mating surfaces must 
be dissolved into a semi-fluid and inserted with interference while they 

are still wet. This results in a joint whose surfaces are partially bonded 

and partially fused together [83], as shown in Figure 4-7.  



80 

 

This bonding process does not provide enough space for 

embedding sensors and does not produce joints that behave similarly as 

the ones in the fiberglass-epoxy systems. 

A workaround is to machine the spigot’s outer surface to create a 

1 to 2 mm radial clearance and use a compatible bi-component plastic 

adhesive to bond the spigot to the bell, simulating the adhesive bonded 

joints described in section 0. 

 

 
Figure 4-7 - Solvent bonded PVC pipe and fitting with bonded and fused 

surfaces. [83] 

 

A suitable, heavy-duty industrial methyl methacrylate based bi-

component adhesive, capable of bonding PVC substrates with up to  

4 mm gap filling was found. Chemical compatibility and bonding 

efficiency with the fibers polyimide coating was unknown and needed to 

be properly tested. As the chemical composition of CPVC is different 

from regular PVC, testing if the adhesive can provide a strong adhesive 

bond in CPVC is also required. 

4.4.1 Preliminary Tests 

A simple test was devised in order to test the compatibility 

between the adhesive, the CPVC pipes and the polyimide coating. For 

the experiment, a straight piece of 22 mm nominal diameter CPVC pipe, 

typically used for residential hot water installations, was acquired. 

Additionally, a matching cap, a threaded adaptor, a sleeve and a bottle 

of solvent adhesive were also acquired. 
The 22 mm CPVC pipe was cut in half. The solvent adhesive was 

used to bond the threaded adaptor and the sleeve to one of the halves 

(Figure 4-8). The other half had a sealing cap bonded into one end, 

while the other end was machined to create a 1 mm radial gap when 

inserted into the sleeve. 



81 

 

A sample of the methyl methacrylate adhesive, kindly provided 

by its manufacturer, was then used to bond the machined piece to the 

vacant side of the sleeve. The sample was also used to glue a single 

three FBG chain to the surface of the pipe, as shown in Figure 4-9. 

 

 
Figure 4-8 - Hot water installation CPVC pipe with one machined end 

(indicated by the yellow arrow) and solvent bonded fittings. 

 

 
Figure 4-9 - Left side of the sleeve and a single three FBG fiber (indicated by 

the yellow arrow) bonded to the pipe using the methyl methacrylate adhesive. 

The direction of strain sensitivity of the FBG indicated by the red arrow. 

 

The FBG chain was aligned along the fiber axis in order to 

measure the axial strain in response to pressure loadings, as originally 

intended for the embedded fibers. This particular fiber was selected for 

being the only one containing one poorly written FBG (Figure 4-10). 

A testing bench was assembled using spare aluminum profiles, 

steel plates, a vacuum chamber window and transparent acrylic sheets 

(Figure 4-11). The CPVC test specimen was fitted with a manometer 

and connected to a manual hydraulic pump, while the FBG chain was 

connected to a FBG interrogator using a 5 meters reinforced patch cord. 

Three hydrostatic pressure tests were executed. The first one up 

to 10 kgf/cm² (0.98 MPa) of internal manometric pressure to see if the 

methyl methacrylate bond would hold. The results of this first test are 

summarized in Figure 4-12. 

The second test (Figure 4-13) had the test specimen pressurized 

up to 20 kgf/cm² (1.96 MPa), close to its pressure rating of 2.20 MPa at 

room temperature. At this point the bonded joint did not exhibit any 

signs of imminent failure and the FBG signal had not started to degrade.

test. A poorly written FBG produces the weaker reflection peak to the left. 

 

 
Figure 4-11 - Assembled test bench. The test specimen can be seen resting 

inside and the manual hydraulic pump in the right side of the picture. 

 

To fully test the capabilities of the adhesive a third test (Figure 

4-14) was started, with the intent of keep rising internal pressure until 

the test specimen fails. The test was interrupted when internal pressure 

reached 80 kgf/cm² (7.85 MPa), still before failure occur, due to safety 

concerns. No FBG signal degradation was observed. 

Bragg wavelength shift was very linear in every test, with no 

observable hysteresis. The bonded joint’s performance was far superior 

from the expected. CPVC pipes and the methyl methacrylate adhesive 

were then considerate adequate substitutes to the fiberglass-epoxy pipes.

4.4.2 Test Specimen Design and Adaptations to Planned Tests 

The industrial 4” CPVC test specimen (Figure 4-15) is basically a 

bigger version of the one shown in Figure 4-8, with the exception of 

substituting the threaded end for a flange. 

 
 

 
Figure 4-15 - 3D model of the proposed CPVC test specimen. 

 

Sensors were embedded in the side of the sleeve facing the cap. 

All straight pipe pieces inserted into this side of the sleeve must be 

machined. Radial gap has been defined as 1.5 mm for all methyl 

methacrylate bonded joints.  

The indicated 450 mm total length from the bottom of the cap to 

the leftmost face of the sleeve is a design reference to ensure this section 

of the test specimen fits into the CT machine. To this end, the length of 

the pipe piece to be solvent bonded to the cap and adhesive bonded to 

the sleeve was set to 280 mm. 

There is no length restriction for the pipe segment solvent bonded 

to the flange, since this part would not be tested with CT. Considering 

the insertion depth of 57.5 mm into the sleeve, the length of this 

segment was set to 200 mm, keeping the specimen compact with a total 

length just short of 600 mm. 

The number of test specimens can be reduced to seven, down 

from ten at Section 4.2, by cleverly using both sides of the sleeve in the 

destructive tests. Instead of doing six separate destructive tests, three 



87 

 

with embedded sensors and three without, it is possible to have three test 

specimens where both sides of the sleeve are adhesive bonded.  

If sensors are embedded in just one side of the sleeve, and if a 

tendency for failure to occur in this side is observed, it will be 

considered a strong indication that the presence of the fibers is 

deleterious to the bonded joint. 

The number of embedded fibers remains the same. The reduced 

diameter translates into a circumferential separation reduction from 

43.56 mm to approximately 30 mm.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Before performing tests with bonded joints all acquired sensors 

and patch cords (Figure 5-1) were tested to make sure no faulty sensor 

would be used in the experiments. Only a single 3 FBG array had a 

faulty sensor. It was separated from the others and then used for the 

preliminary CPVC pipe test described in the previous chapter.  

 

 
Figure 5-1 - 3 FBG arrays, 12 FBG arrays and patch cords. 

 

The setup used to interrogate and test the sensors was basically 

the same for all the experiments detailed in this chapter. The fibers were 

connected to a 1x12 bi-directional MEMS switch (Figure 5-2), which 

was then connected to a 4-channel FBG interrogator (Figure 5-3) using a 

patch cord.  

 

 
Figure 5-2 - Fibers connected to a 1x12 MEMS switch (indicated by the arrow). 



90 

 

 
Figure 5-3 - Optical sensing interrogator. 

 

The switch is controlled by a laptop computer through a USB 

port, while the interrogator communicates to the computer using an 

Ethernet port. 

Total fiber length is less than 8 meters, with the 5 meters patch 

cords, 1 meter in/out switch ports plus sensing fiber length. The optical 

signal travels approximately double this value since the FBGs reflection 

spectrum is the one being analyzed. This is relatively very short and 

signal attenuation is not a concern considering attenuation values 

presented in Section 3.1.3. 

The specimens were prepared by first cutting the straight pipe 

pieces to the specified length. They were also machined to ensure a 

square cut and to provide the radial clearance when necessary (Figure 

5-4). 

 

   
Figure 5-4 - Cut and machined pipe pieces. 

 

Next the caps and flanges were solvent bonded to the pipe pieces. 

The caps to the longer pieces and the flanges to the shorter ones (Figure 

5-5). 



91 

 

 

       
Figure 5-5 - Solvent bonded cap (left) and flange (right). 

 

The assembly process was finished by bonding these two parts to 

a single sleeve. This is accomplished by first adhesive bonding the 

capped piece, along with the embedded sensors, to a sleeve and then 

either adhesive or solvent bonding the flanged piece to the opposite side 

of the sleeve. 

A total of three test specimens were fully assembled. Further 

details on three, instead of seven as originally planned, will be provided 

in the following sections when appropriate. 

5.1 Optical Fibers Embedding Analysis 

Analysis for the three test specimens, dubbed Specimen A, 

Specimen B and Specimen C, are presented in order.  

For Specimen A, the embedding procedure is extensively 

detailed. Adjustments made to the original procedure are discussed in 

the section corresponding to the test specimen they were implemented. 

After detailing and discussing the embedding process, results 

from the CT scans and embedded sensors are presented, compared and 

discussed. 

5.1.1 Specimen A 

Firstly, the 3 FBG arrays were pre-positioned around the pipe 

using adhesive tape, as shown in Figure 5-6. The loose tube enters 

slightly the area to be bonded, preventing the fiber from breaking in the 

point it exits the cured adhesive. 



92 

 

 
Figure 5-6 - FBG arrays pre-positioned on the pipe. 

 

Note that since this is the first attempt at embedding the sensors, 

this test specimen is using the remainder 11 fibers from the set that has 

one fiber with a defective FBG. The other two specimens have a full set 

of 12 fibers embedded into them. 

Next the tip of the fibers was glued to the pipe with a 

cyanoacrylate instant adhesive (Figure 5-7). This prevents the fiber from 

bending when the pipe is inserted into the sleeve, which could misalign 

or break the fibers. 

 

 
Figure 5-7 - Tip of the fibers glued to the pipe (orange arrows) and the direction 

of strain sensitivity of the FBGs (red arrows).

The methyl methacrylate adhesive is first applied along the length 

of the fiber (Figure 5-8). It is made in order to further fix them in place 

and to avoid moving them during the procedure to spread the adhesive 

around the tube. 

 

 
Figure 5-8 - Adhesive applied directly along the fibers. 

 

Adhesive is then applied and spread along the rest of the spigot 

until a thick layer of adhesive covers the whole section that will be 

inserted in the sleeve, as shown in Figure 5-9. 

 

 
Figure 5-9 - Thick layer of methyl methacrylate adhesive covering the spigot. 



94 

 

The sleeve is also coated with a layer of methyl methacrylate 

adhesive. 

 

 
Figure 5-10 - Methyl methacrylate adhesive layer in the sleeve. 

 

The adhesive, in the form of bi-component cartridges, was 

applied with the help of a manual adhesive gun and a plastic mixer 

nozzle (Figure 5-12). 

 

 
Figure 5-11- Adhesive gun with a loaded cartridge. Mixer nozzle detached from 

the cartridge, to the right. 

 

Finally, the spigot and the sleeve are carefully mated and the 

adhesive is allowed to cure for 24 hours. This partial assembly (Figure 

5-12) is then evaluated by means of the FBG sensors and CT scanned 

before bonding the remaining part. 



95 

 

 
Figure 5-12- Partial test specimen assembly with embedded sensors. 

 

The quality of the bonded joint can then be accessed for the first 

time by measuring the shift of ?? for all FBGs and using Equation 3.11. 
?? was measured for all sensors after pre-positioning them and then 
measured again after the 24 hours curing period. 

Room temperature was the same for both tests, so Equation 3.11 

can be simplified as follows.

(5.2) 

The strain is expected to be compressive (negative), due to 

adhesive shrinkage during the curing process. [84] 

Figure 5-13 is a 3D plot of the cure strain distribution inside the 

adhesive layer, as measured by the FBGs. The Z axis is strain in ??/?. 
X axis (0 through 11) are the fibers. Fibers 0 and 11 were purposely 

plotted with the same data to visualize the strain for the full 

circumference. The Y axis represent the three FBGs, being 0 the 

innermost FBG and 2 the FBG nearest to the outer edge of the sleeve. 

Interpolation between strain values is bilinear. 

Figure 5-14 is a 2D color plot of the same strain distribution. The 

color bar indicates the strain, in ??/?, and the X and Y axis are the 
same as in the 3D plot. Every plot from now on will use the same units, 

axis convention and interpolation as these two. 



96 

 

 
Figure 5-13 - 3D plot with color bar of the cure strain distribution in the 

adhesive layer. Test specimen A. 

 
Figure 5-14- Color plot of the cure strain distribution in the adhesive layer. Test 

specimen A. 

 

Strain distribution is evidently very disarranged. For the same 

value of Y, strain distribution along X was expected to be approximately 

uniform due to rotational symmetry but this is not observed. 



97 

 

 There is also a pack of FBGs in fibers 2 to 7 with tractive 

loading, contradicting the predicted compressive strain due to adhesive 

shrinkage during the cure. 

This is an indication that either the sensors are poorly bonded to 

the adhesive, which is unlikely considering this was not observed in the 

smaller CPVC pipe, or that many defects were unwillingly introduced 

into the bonded joint. 

The results from the CT scan corroborate the last hypothesis. 

Figure 5-15 is a 3D rendition of the scans from the bonded joint. 

Transparency was turned on in the renderer to visualize the internal 

structure of the bonded joint. Darker areas are voids in the adhesive 

layer, meaning that a large percentage of this bonded joint is lacking 

adhesive. 

 

 
Figure 5-15 - 3D rendering of the CT images. Transparency is used to observe 

the internal structure of the joint. Darker areas are voids in the adhesive layer. 

 

Cross-sectional cuts of the bonded region also clearly show the 

lack of adhesive. In Figure 5-16 the voids are contoured in white.  



98 

 

 

 
Figure 5-16 - Cross-sectional cuts of the adhesive bonded joint. Voids are 

contoured in white. 



99 

 

Unfortunately, no optical fiber is seen in any of the last images. A 

zoomed in view of the cross-section (Figure 5-17) reveals that the fibers 

are too small to produce a discernible CT signal once inside the bonded 

region. 

 

 
Figure 5-17 - Detail of the cross-section shows an optical fiber (indicated by the 

arrow) entering the adhesive bond and vanishing soon after. 

 

It is unfortunate that the CT images cannot be used to observe the 

position of the fibers in detail. Nonetheless the images still contain a lot 

of information that can be compared to the strain maps. 

5.1.2 Specimen B 

Two changes were made to the fibers embedding process to try to 

produce a good quality bonded joint. 

The first was a great increase in the amount of adhesive used. 

Each cartridge contains 50 ml of adhesive. In the first joint about 30 ml 

were used and for the second one a full cartridge was applied. 

The second change is related to the geometry of the spigot. The 

sudden change in diameter creates a large gap between the fiber and the 

spigot, as shown in Figure 5-18. In Figure 5-14 the FBGs under traction 

are the ones nearer to this gap, meaning this may be a contributing 

factor. 

 



100 

 

 
Figure 5-18 - Gap between the fibers and the spigot due to the machining done 

to the spigot. 

 

This problem was solved by cutting small grooves with a file to 

smoothly conduct the fibers into the area that will be bonded (Figure 

5-19). 

 

 
Figure 5-19 - Grooves help to conduct the fibers smoothly, eliminating the gap 

seen in the previous image. 

 

The strain field for this bonded joint, depicted in Figure 5-20 and 

Figure 5-21 has a more promising look. All sensors are experiencing 

compressive strain and the field exhibits an approximate rotational 

symmetry. 



101 

 

 

 
Figure 5-20 - 3D plot with color bar of the cure strain distribution in the 

adhesive layer. Test specimen B. 

 

 
Figure 5-21 - Color plot of the cure strain distribution in the adhesive layer. Test 

specimen B. 

 

 



102 

 

The prospect of a higher quality bonded joint is confirmed by the 

results from the CT. The 3D rendering in Figure 5-22 is quite different 

from the previous specimen. There are no big voids like before, instead 

many small pores can be observed. This is likely the result of entrapped 

volatile compounds from the adhesive, since it has a sharp exothermal 

curve and the bonded joint is an enclosed space.  

It is unlikely that a porosity free bonded joint can be 

manufactured with the available materials, but since this does not seem 

to adversely affect the response of the sensors, this will be considered as 

a good quality bonded joint for comparison purposes.  

Since a good quality joint was achieved in the second try and this 

specimen also doubles as a good instrumented joint for destructive 

testing, the total number of required specimens can be reduced from the 

original seven to six. 

 

 
Figure 5-22 - 3D rendering of the CT images. Transparency is used to observe 

the internal structure of the joint. Porosity is observed here instead of numerous 

large voids.  

 

Inn specimen B, the optical fibers remain invisible inside the 

bonded region, but it is possible to see how the grooves are producing 

the expected results (Figure 5-23). 



103 

 

    
Figure 5-23 – An optical fiber entering the adhesive layer in a test specimen 

without guiding grooves (left) and with guiding grooves (right). 

5.1.3 Specimen C 

Having perfected and validated the bonded joint assembly 

method, the next logical step is to include planned defects for 

comparison purposes. 

Three small inclusions (Figure 5-24), one circle with a diameter 

of approximately 20 mm, one square with 20 mm sides, and a 20 mm by 

70 mm rectangle were prepared. They consist of three layers of 

aluminum tape, for better visibility in the CT imagens, and one layer of 

Teflon sheet for its low adherence. 

 

 
Figure 5-24 - Artificial inclusions made of aluminum tape and Teflon. 



104 

 

The inclusions were then fixed to the sleeve (Figure 5-25) by 

applying a small amount of instant cyanoacrylate glue around their 

edges. This will simulate three debonded regions with different sizes 

and geometries. 

 

 
Figure 5-25 - Inclusions bonded to the sleeve. 

 

After the joint assembly, the FBG sensors were read. Once more 

all sensors are under compressive strain, and while the strain field in 

Figure 5-26 has an overall shape similar to the one in Figure 5-20 some 

particularities can be observed. 

This is more evident in the color plot in Figure 5-27, where the 

approximate location of the defects is overlaid to the strain field. There 

is a clear difference around the area where the larger rectangular defect 

is expected to be, which is promising. 

On the other hand, the smaller defects apparently did not produce 

a significant enough change in the strain field to be evidently noticed. 

This may be because they are overshadowed by the strain from the 

adhesive shrinkage. If this is the case they may show up in the 

hydrostatic tests in the next section. 

All three inclusions are visible in the 3D rendered model back 

from the CT (Figure 5-28). 

The exact position of the inclusions can be determined by looking 

at the cross-sectional cuts, such as the one in Figure 5-29. Their actual 

position is very close to the ones shown in Figure 5-27. The adhesive 

layer also seems to be even less porous in relation to test specimen B.

5.2 Defect Detection with Embedded Sensors 

Hydrostatic testing requires the test specimens to be fully 

assembled. Internal pressure variation will also be used in the tests 

together with the digital shearography equipment (Figure 5-30). 

 

 
Figure 5-30 - Digital shearography equipment. A 300 mW single longitudinal 

mode 532 nm laser with expansion lenses (white arrow), and lateral shearing 

interferometer with attached digital camera and objective lens (yellow arrow). 

 

Specimen B was assembled with a second adhesive bonded joint 

for the upcoming destructive test. There is no interest in performing 

destructive tests with test specimen A and C, so both had the flanged 

pipe piece solvent bonded to the vacant side of their sleeves.  

A matching blind flange (Figure 5-31), with a ¼” NPT thread for 

connecting a manual hydraulic pump, was designed and machined out of 

a 1040 steel plate to seal the test specimens.  

 

 
Figure 5-31 - Matching 1040 steel flange with 1/4" NPT thread. 



108 

 

For the digital shearography tests the sleeves were painted mat 

white and divided in four equal areas. A small structure available in the 

laboratory was used to keep the specimens in the vertical position. This 

structure and the painted sleeve can be seen in Figure 5-32. 

 

 
Figure 5-32 - Test specimen B with the sleeve painted mat white and divided in 

four equal areas. It is being kept in the vertical position by a metal structure and 

industrial fabric belts. 

 

It is important to notice that the sleeve has an internal stop at half 

the way through (Figure 5-33). Since there will not be a pipe inserted in 

this region, it is expected that this will produce a distinct fringe pattern 

in the shearography maps. 

For the hydrostatic tests, the specimens were laid horizontally, 
supported by the blind flange and the cap. Strain data will be acquired 

for various internal pressure values and all ?? maps will use the zero 

internal manometric internal pressure strain values as reference. 



109 

 

For a pristine joint, it is expected that when comparing strain 

distribution from higher pressures in relation to zero, the result is a fully 

tractive ?? map. 

 

 
Figure 5-33 – A stop inside the sleeve. 

 

Even though the maximum internal pressure during this tests will 

not exceed 8 bar (0.8 MPa) and this pipe is rated for 22 bar (2.2 MPa), a 

small protective chamber window was placed around the sleeve to avoid 

water and oil spillage on nearby electronic devices in case of premature 

failure of the bonded joints (Figure 5-34). 

 

 
Figure 5-34 - Setup for hydrostatic testing of the instrumented adhesive bonded 

joints. 



110 

 

5.2.1 Specimen A 

Strain distribution was mapped for internal manometric pressure 

from 0 bar to 7 bar, with 1 bar increments. As pressure increases, the 

shape of the strain distribution remains almost identical while strain 

values scale with the applied pressure (Figure 5-35). 

 

 
 

 
Figure 5-35 - 3D plot with color bar of ?? in the adhesive layer. Specimen A. 

Internal pressure variation: 2 bar (up) and 6 bar (down). 



111 

 

Strain distribution for specimen A is once again disarranged. No 

rotational symmetry is observed and various FBGs are experiencing 

compressive strain, which is the opposite of what was expected for a 

flawless bonded joint. 

Figure 5-36 is the 2D color plot of the ?? map for a Internal 

pressure variation of 7 bar. It has been divided in four areas that 

correspond to the ones in the surface of the sleeve for the digital 

shearography test. 

 

 
Figure 5-36 - Color plot of ?? in the adhesive layer. Test specimen A. Internal 

pressure variation: 7 bar. 

 

Area 3 has the most uniform strain distribution, which indicates a 

lack of defects. The FBGs in the upper portion of area 4 are compressed, 

hinting at the presence of a defect near the stop by the middle of the 

sleeve. Areas 1 and 2 have compressed FBGs where the fibers enter the 

adhesive layer. This result will be compared to the shearograms to 

verify if the defect indicatives match. 

Figure 5-37 shows how the shearography equipment sees the test 

specimen. The double image is a result of the lateral shearing 

interferometer. The dashed square to the right is the adhesive bonded 

region of the sleeve, with the embedded sensors. The dashed square to 

the left is the solvent bonded region. The space between them contains 



112 

 

the sleeve’s stop. The axis labeled as ‘x’ and ‘y’ correspond respectively 

to the horizontal and vertical axis in Figure 5-36. 

 

 
Figure 5-37 - Double image of area 1 as seen by the camera of the shearography 

equipment. 

 

All shearograms in this chapter will follow the conventions 

defined in Figure 5-36. 

From the fringe maps in Figure 5-38, Figure 5-39, Figure 5-40 

and Figure 5-41, it is clear that the sleeve’s stop creates a divide in the 

fringe maps, creating two distinct strain fields that must be analyzed 

separately. This distinction is necessary since the fringes around this 

area are very similar to the ones caused by an internal defect, such as the 

ones in Figure 2-20 and Figure 2-21. 

In the shearograms, the areas were disturbances in the fringe 

patterns indicate the presence of defects are delimited by red dashed 

rectangles. 

The shearograms for area 1 (Figure 5-38) and area 2 (Figure 

5-39) exhibit signs of sub-surface defects in the outermost side of the 

adhesive bonded region, in agreeance to the defect indications from the 

strain map. The fringes interpretation will be more understandable after 

reading the next section and comparing the results. 
Area 3 shearogram (Figure 5-40) has an almost uniform fringe 

pattern. A small defect that does not appear in the strain map was 

detected in the lower right region of the bonded joint.

113 

 

Area 4 shearogram (Figure 5-41) is also in accordance to the 

strain map, indicating the presence of defects in the upper half of the 

bonded region.

There is a good correlation between the strain field measured 

with the FBGs and the fringe maps. Regions with sensors under 

compressive strain also exhibit disturbances in the corresponding fringe

maps that confirms the presence of defects. The only exception is the 

small defect in area 3 that was not detected by the FBGs.

5.2.2 Specimen B 

As with specimen A, strain distribution was mapped for internal 

manometric pressure from 0 bar to 7 bar, with 1 bar increments. 

Similarly, the shape of the strain distribution remains almost identical 

while strain values scale with the applied pressure (Figure 5-42).

115 

 

In comparison to test specimen A, the strain distribution is much 

more uniform. All FBGs are under tensile strain and a good amount of 

rotational symmetry can be observed. 

 

 
 

 
Figure 5-42 - 3D plot with color bar of ?? in the adhesive layer. Specimen B. 

Internal pressure variation: 2 bar (up) and 6 bar (down). 



116 

 

A few FBGs stand out with significantly lower strain levels, this 

is more evident Figure 5-43. Looking at Figure 5-42 and Figure 5-43 it  

seems that the anomalous readings are symmetric in relation to fiber 7.  

 

 
Figure 5-43 – Color plot of ?? in the adhesive layer. Test specimen B. Internal 

pressure variation: 7 bar. 

 

This lead to the suspicion that supporting the test specimen by the 

flange and the cap introduced a flexural loading in the sleeve that 

changed due to pressure stiffening of the pipe. To test this hypothesis 

the test specimen was rotated by 90º around its axis. If the hypothesis 

hold, the perceived symmetry will shift laterally in the strain map. 

Figure 5-44 is the resulting strain distribution after the rotation, 

for a Internal pressure variation of 7 bar. The new strain map is almost 

identical to the previous, the pressure stiffening hypothesis is incorrect. 

As the results from the CT scan do not exhibit large defects it is possible 

to propose that this behavior is a result of pores near those sensors. 

The information obtained by rotating the test specimen, however, 

can still be used for an interesting analysis of the flexural strain in the 
sleeve. The plots in Figure 5-45 and Figure 5-46 were obtained by 

comparing the strain field for an internal pressure of 7 bar before and 

after the test specimen was rotated. These flexural strain maps are very 

smooth and highly symmetrical, showing no evidence of defects.

layer after rotating test specimen B.

As for the fringe maps obtained with the digital shearography 

equipment (Figure 5-47, Figure 5-48, Figure 5-49 and Figure 5-50), 

there is no indication of internal defects. They all do not exhibit 

disturbances in the fringe patterns as seen in the Specimen A 

shearograms.

5.2.3 Specimen C 

As previously, strain distribution was mapped for internal 

manometric pressure from 0 bar to 7 bar with 1 bar increments. The 

shape of the strain distribution remains almost identical while strain 

values scale increase in accordance with the applied pressure (Figure 

5-51). In comparison to previous specimens the strain distribution is the 

smoothest one, possibly a reflex of the reduced porosity.  

Two of the planned defects were clearly detected by the sensors: 

The large rectangle in area 4 (Figure 5-52) that spans from fiber 0 to 

half-way through fiber 1 and 2, and the circle that coincides with fiber 4. 

The square insert, placed between fibers 6 and 7, was not detected by 

the FBGs.  

Test specimen C was also rotated around its axis to see how the 

planned defects affect the flexural strain distribution. The large 

rectangle still produce a visible disturbance in the flexural strain map 

(Figure 5-53), but the smaller defects are not seen. 

Digital shearography (Figure 5-54, Figure 5-55, Figure 5-56 and 

Figure 5-57) also did not detect the smaller inserts. The large rectangle 

appears clearly in the shearogram of area 4 (Figure 5-57) and a small 

part of it is still visible in area 1 (Figure 5-54).

FBG chains. The 12 FBG chain specified for the 6” fiberglass-epoxy 

pipe was too long and the last two FBGs were cut out to avoid sensor 

overlap. The 10 FBG chain was bonded to the surface of the sleeve 

using the methyl methacrylate adhesive.  

Counting from the FC/APC connector, FBGs 1 and 2 are located 

by the borders of the large rectangle, while FBG 10 is directly on top of 

it after the fiber wraps around (Figure 5-58).

FBG 5 was bonded on top of the small square insert (Figure 

5-59).

direction of the strain sensitivity of the FBG is indicated by the red arrow.

The test specimen was then pressurized up to 8 bar and the 10 

FBGs were interrogated every 1 bar. To evaluate if the FBGs placed 

around the inserts could detect the internal defects based on the 

circumferential strain distribution on the outer surface of the sleeve, 

look at the strain profile at 8 bar (Figure 5-61).

The evolution of the strain profile along the 10 FBG chain can be 

seen in Figure 5-62. Non-uniformities become more evident at higher 

pressures.

FBGs 1, 5, and 10 are all close to defects and appear to be 

subjected to lower strain values. It is possible to use a hypothesis test to 

determine if they can be considered different from the other points. [85] 

The mean strain ?? of the other 7 FBGs is 500.83 ?m/m. The null 
hypothesis ?0 and alternative hypothesis ?1 can be defined as: 

 

?0: ???1, ???5, ???10 = ??  
?1: ???1, ???5, ???10 &amp;lt;?? 

 

The standard deviation ?? of ?? is 17.95 ?m/m. For a significance 
level ? of 0.05, and 6 degrees of freedom, the test statistic ? as given by 
Equation 5.3 must be smaller than the critical value ???,6 = ?1.943.  

 ? =
? ? ??

??
 

 
(5.3) 

The higher value of ? will occur for ???5 since it has the highest 
strain value of the 3 tested FBGs. Substituting the values of  ??, ?? and 

???5 = 458.27 ??/? in equation 5.3 returns ? = ?2.37. 
?0 is then rejected and all three strain measurements can be 

considered different from the mean strain value for a 95% confidence 

level. 

5.3 Instrumentation Impact on Joint Pressure Rating 

In the manufacturer’s product guide, all 4” CPVC pipes and 

fittings, except 45º elbows, have an operating pressure rating of 22 bar 

(2.2 MPa) @ 20 ºC. However, it was not disclosed that the flanges 

operating pressure rating is 150 psi (1.03 MPa). 

With such lower pressure rating, the test specimen is much more 

likely to fail at the flange. As this will probably lead to inconclusive 

experiments, no more test specimens were assembled for destructive 

testing. Only Specimen B was pressurized until failure. This concludes 

the explanation on why only three out of the originally planned seven 

test specimens were fully assembled. 

For the destructive test, specimen B was placed inside a steel pipe 

fastened to the ladder of a small bunker under Labmetro (Figure 5-63). 

 



129 

 

 
Figure 5-63 - Test specimen B inside a steel pipe fastened to a ladder. 

 

During the test, the entrance to the bunker was sealed using its 

own concrete trapdoor (Figure 5-64).  

 

 
Figure 5-64 – Concrete trapdoor sealing the entrance to the bunker. 

 

The test specimen was then pressurized until it failed at the 

internal pressure of 60 bar. The FBGs were interrogated every 5 bar. 

Upon reaching 25 bar, 40 bar and 50 bar the manometric pressure was 

brought down to 0 bar. Comparing the strain field at the zeroes can 

show the buildup of residual strain. 



130 

 

Figure 5-65 and Figure 5-66 show strain maps in the adhesive 

layer for various pressure levels. The ongoing trend of very similar 

strain distributions is still present, with a slight strain homogenization in 

the bonded joint at higher pressures.

pressure variation: 5 bar (up) and 25 bar (down).

pressure variation: 45 bar (up) and 55 bar (down). 

 

The strain maps in Figure 5-67 clearly show an increasing 

amount of residual strain when lowering the internal manometric 

pressure back to 0 bar after reaching 25 bar and 50 bar.

The test specimen failed at the adhesive bonded joint without the 

optical fiber sensors (Figure 5-68).

bonded joint without embedded fiber optic sensors. 

 

Unfortunately, since the failure did not start in the region with the 

FBGs, it was not possible to monitor its progression.

6 CONCLUSIONS 

This work proposed an integrated sensing solution to monitor the 

structural integrity of adhesive bonded joints in pipes. Differently from 

existing solutions that focus on regularly scheduled maintenance, the 

approach proposed here aims to be compatible with long-term 

monitoring. 

A simple and well known optical fiber sensor was selected and a 

sensing strategy based on ?? maps, similarly to optical interferometry 

techniques such as shearography and holography, was applied. 

The objectives set on the first chapter: studying and selecting 

sensors, elaborating an integrated sensing strategy and evaluating both 

the sensors and sensing strategy have all been fulfilled. 

The following sections summarize the capabilities and limitations 

of the method that has been proposed and tested, along with presenting 

suggestions to further develop this study. 

6.1 Performance of the Proposed Method 

From the results exposed in Chapter 5 it is evident that the 

proposed method is capable of detecting internal defects in adhesive 

bonded joints. 

While the sensors embedded into the adhesive layer could not 

detect all three defects purposely introduced into test specimen C, the 

combined approach of embedding and wrapping sensors could. 

The results obtained from the optical fiber sensors were in 

agreeance with the much more detailed computed tomography scans, 

which is a technique with severe limitations for in field applications. 

They were also on par with shearography for detecting larger defects 

and was able to detect the smaller defects that did not appear in the 

shearograms. 

Even while focusing only on joint assemble and long-term 

monitoring, the method proved itself to be effective for monitoring the 

pipeline assembly process by providing a detailed flexural strain profile. 

The sensors can be used during this stage to monitor if excessive loads 

were introduced in the joints when misalignments are corrected by 

force.  

By mapping ?? instead of absolute strain values, the method 

allows all stages of the pipeline lifecycle to be monitored independently 

by keeping strain comparisons intra-stage only. 

 



136 

 

6.2 Sensing Strategy Limitations 

It is important to know that this approach is not able to reject, or 

approve, an inspected bonded joint per the criteria defined by the 

standards cited in section 4.1.2, as the FBGs are quasi single-point strain 

sensors and the standards reject a joint based on total defect area. 

The tests with planned defects showed that the FBGs are very 

good at detecting voids and debonded areas when directly adjacent to 

them, but a defect resting between fibers can go undetected. 

A solid sensing coverage is possibly the most important aspect to 

consider when utilizing this method, otherwise defects can remain 

unnoticed. 

6.3 Suggestions for Future Advancements 

6.3.1 Tensile Testing 

The pressure rating of the plastic flanges undermined the 

execution of destructive tests. Although the failure occurring away from 

the embedded fibers is positive, only one destructive test does not bear 

enough statistical significance to conclude that the embedded sensors 

have no deleterious effects in the mechanical strength of the joint. 

One way to utilize the material already acquired for this 

dissertation is to substitute the hydrostatic test for a tensile test. The 

mechanical engineering department of Federal University of Santa 

Catarina is equipped with a 300 kN tensile testing machine, more than 

enough to lead the CPVC pipes to failure. An ASTM D2105 tensile grip 

or similar can be procured and used to fix the test specimens to the 

machine. 

6.3.2 Fibers per Joint versus Joint Strength 

With the proper means to extensively execute destructive tests, it 

would be interesting to evaluate how the number of embedded sensors 

affects the strength of the bonded joints. This information can be used to 

obtain the best sensing coverage with minimal intrusiveness.  

6.3.3 More Sensors in a Single Fiber 

For an even better coverage the number of sensors per fiber can 

be increased. Three FBGs already have produced very good results for 

an insertion depth of 57 mm. 



137 

 

From this perspective, the best may be making use of distributed 

strain sensing with OFDR. The entire fiber can be used as a cheap 

distributed sensor, with the downside of requiring a more complex 

interrogation scheme. 

6.3.4 Temperature Compensation for Field Testing 

Having an instrumented pipeline in the field can provide a lot of 

invaluable data, but a few problems must be solved before this can be 

attempted successfully. 

The most important point is temperature compensation. In the 

laboratory it is easy to make temperature a non-issue by keeping it 

constant during all tests. Without temperature compensation pure strain 

data cannot be extracted from the sensors. 

Chapter 3 already covers a few fiber optic sensors with multi-

parameter capabilities and many more can be found in specialized 

literature. From the ones cited in chapter 3, the thermochromic coating 

seems to be the easiest to adapt to the current sensing strategy. 

6.3.5 Ruggedness for Long-Term Monitoring 

Field employed sensors need to be very robust if long-term 

monitoring capability is desired. 

There is ample variety of buffer coating material available, 

including organically modified ceramics and metallic coatings that can 

provide a better protection against constant exposure to UV light and 

humidity. Rugged fiber connectors are also available, some even with IP 

68 ratings and salt mist tolerance. Armored fiber optic patch cords and 

cables are already widespread. 

Submarine optical fiber communications technology can provide 

lots of useful information and design choices for increased ruggedness. 

6.3.6 Annealing of the FBGs 

The periodic modulation of the refractive index of the FBG 

decays with time. This decay results in a change of grating reflectivity 

and nominal Bragg wavelength, which in turn will lead to measurement 

errors in long-term monitoring applications. 
Annealing is a powerful and simple technique to greatly increase 

the stability of the periodic modulation. References [86] and [87] 

provide more details on how to anneal FBGs written in regular fibers 

and in hydrogen loaded fibers.
