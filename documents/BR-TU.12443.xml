Otimização da fragmentação e dos processos de fixação 

na reprodução assexuada do coral mole Sarcophyton sp. 

 

Resumo 

 
O género Sarcophyton é amplamente conhecido pelos metabolitos secundários 

que produz, com importantes aplicações biomédicas. Como a coleta destes organismos 

da natureza não é sustentável nem prática, a aquacultura apresenta-se como a mais 

promissora alternativa. O cultivo ex situ de corais, além do maior controlo da produção, 

permite a seleção de colónias com características de maior interesse e, a possibilidade de 

reprodução assexuada por fragmentação, perpetuando estas características genéticas de 

interesse e possivelmente os mesmos endossimbiontes associados. O controlo da fixação 

e cicatrização, após a fragmentação, será crucial para a otimização da produção, pela 

diminuição da mortalidade. O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar pela primeira 

vez, em cinco experiências consecutivas, o efeito do: i) espectro luminoso – luz azul, 

branca e vermelha, ii) intensidade de Radiação Fotossintética Ativa (PAR) – 60 e 120 

µmol quanta/m2/s, iii) substrato de adesão – carbonato de cálcio e plástico, iv) processo 

de fixação – cola de etilcianoacrilato, cola de N-butil-2-cianoacrilato e elástico, e v) 

posicionamento do fragmento – tecido intacto e tecido cortado em contacto com o 

substrato de fixação. Os fatores testados foram avaliados com base na: i) percentagem de 

sobrevivência, ii) eficiência fotossintética (Fv/Fm), e iii) força de adesão (Newton/mm
2). 

A intensidade PAR de 120 µmol quanta/m2/s e o espetro de luz vermelha foram, no geral, 

os melhores tratamentos de luz. O tipo de substrato e a posição do fragmento não tiveram 

influência na sobrevivência e força de adesão dos fragmentos. A cola de N-butil-2-

cianoacrilato foi o método de fixação mais eficaz. Este estudo realça a importância dos 

métodos pós-fragmentação no sucesso da aquacultura de corais, tendo contribuído para a 

otimização dos procedimentos a adotar no processo de reprodução assexuada de corais 

moles do género Sarcophyton.

Otimização da fragmentação e dos processos de fixação

Abstract 

 
The genus Sarcophyton is well known for their secondary metabolites, with 

important biomedical applications. Since the wild harvest of these organisms is neither 

sustainable nor practicable, the aquaculture presents itself as the most promising solution. 

Ex situ coral farming aside from enabling for a greater production control, allows for the 

selection of colonies with more desirable characteristics and, the possibility of asexual 

reproduction through fragmentation, preserving these same genetic characteristics and 

possibly the same associated endosymbionts. The control of fixation and cicatrization, 

post-fragmentation, is crucial for the optimization of production, by decreasing the 

survival. The present study aimed at evaluate for the first time, through five consecutive 

experiments, the effect of: i) spectra – white, blue and red light, ii) Photosynthetic Active 

Radiation (PAR) intensity - 60 e 120 µmol quanta/m2/s, iii) substrate – calcium carbonate 

and plastic, iv) fixation process – ethyl cyanoacrylate glue, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue 

and rubber band, e v) fragment position – intact tissue and cutted tissue in contact with 

the fixation substrate. The tested factors were evaluated based on: i) survival percentage, 

ii) photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), and iii) fixation force (Newton/mm
2). PAR intensity 

of 120 µmol quanta/m2/s and red light spectrum were the overall best light related 

treatments. Substrate type and fragment position were found not to affect the fragment 

survival and fixation force of the fragments. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue was the most 

effective fixation process. This study highlights the importance of the post-fragmentation 

techniques in determining the success of coral aquaculture.

1. General introduction 

 

1.1 Biology and ecology of corals 

 

Corals, being such vital organisms of coral reefs, have long been subject to several 

biological studies (McFadden et al., 2006b; Osinga et al., 2011). Most coral species live 

in compact colonies formed by several polyps, which in turn are formed by two epithelial 

cell layers, the epidermis (or ectoderm) and the gastrodermis (or endoderm), and by an 

oral end surrounded by tentacles (Rocha, 2013). The majority of tropical coral species 

establish a mutualistic symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus 

Symbiodinium, commonly known as zooxanthellae (Glynn, 1996), that live inside 

specialized cells in the coral endoderm. Through this symbiosis, coral provides shelter 

and nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, while it receives sugars, fatty acids 

and amino acids produced photosynthetically by the zooxanthellae (Ellis and Sharron, 

1997; Glynn, 1996).  In recent studies, zooxanthellae were found to belong to eight broad 

clades (clade A to clade H) (Coffroth and Santos, 2005; Stat et al., 2006). The symbiosis 

established between different corals and specific clades of zooxanthellae are mostly 

habitat-specific, affecting corals distribution and response to extreme environmental 

conditions, with corals exhibiting a depth/light relationship with their zooxanthellae 

(depth zonation)(Baker and Rowan, 1997; Mass et al., 2010; Robison and Warner, 2006; 

Rowan and Knowlton, 1995; Ziegler et al., 2015). Zooxanthellate-coral holobiont (coral 

host and associated endosymbionts) can regulate its photosynthetic potential according to 

the prevailing environmental conditions in such a way that photosynthesis is always 

optimal for growth (photoacclimation), under a broad range of photon flux densities. They 

do so by adjusting zooxanthellae density, pigment density (Titlyanov et al., 2001),  or the 

pigment composition based on the available light spectra (Dustan, 1982). 

Corals are commonly divided in hard and soft corals, being the distinction based 

mainly in the presence or absence of a calcium carbonate skeleton to support the colony 

(Rocha, 2013). Hard corals, or scleractinian corals, being the main builders of coral reefs, 

play an important role in the ecology of these ecosystems. Soft corals have also a leading 

role as structural components and contributors to the biomass of the coral reef. Soft corals 

often equal or exceed scleractinian corals in reef total coverage (McFadden et al., 2006b; 

Osinga et al., 2011). As sessile organisms, corals have developed several defense 



2 
 

mechanisms to ensure their survival, and from these mechanisms, chemical interactions 

play a vital role (Sammarco and Coll, 1992). Coral tissues, skeleton and mucus layer 

contains dense and diverse populations of bacteria and archaea that provide support, 

nutrition and protection against pathogens (Bythell and Wild, 2011; Chen et al., 2012; 

Rocha et al., 2011; Sharon and Rosenberg, 2008). The production of secondary 

metabolites  acts as an obstacle to predation, competition (Hay, 1996a; Raveendran and 

Mol, 2009; Sammarco et al., 1985) and have displayed diverse bioactivities, promising 

for drug development (e.g., cytotoxicity, antibiotic and anticancer activity) (Dobretsov et 

al., 2015; Rocha et al., 2011). 

 

1.2 Ecological and socio-economic importance of coral reefs 

 

Coral reefs represent an epicenter of global marine biodiversity and are ranked 

among the most productive and complex ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). They act 

as home and nursery grounds for many marine species, protect coastlines, and provide 

food sources and income to people living along coastlines (Burke et al., 2011; Osinga et 

al., 2011; Van Zanten et al., 2014). It is estimated that about 10% of the world’s 

population depend on coral reefs, directly or indirectly, either as a source of food, natural 

products or as a tourism attraction (Osinga et al., 2011).  

Despite their ecological and economic importance, ecological role and ecosystem 

services, approximately 75% of coral reefs worldwide are currently threatened by a 

combination of stressors that act locally or globally (Burke et al., 2011; Dudgeon et al., 

2010). Threats like climate change (Burke et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2002), pollution 

(Ross and Hallock, 2014), the use of destructive fishing practices (e.g. dynamite or 

cyanide) (Burke et al., 2011; Calado, 2006; Hodgson, 1999; McClanahan et al., 1996; 

Olivotto et al., 2003), the intensive recreational tourism (Lamb et al., 2014), collection of 

corals for the extraction  of natural products (Faulkner, 2001; Leal et al., 2012; Rocha et 

al., 2011; Thakur et al., 2005) or for the marine aquarium trade  (Tlusty, 2002; Wabnitz 

et al., 2003).

1.3 Economic importance of corals  

 

1.3.1 Bioprospection of marine natural products 

 

Corals alongside other marine invertebrates have long been arousing interest as 

source of prototype molecules with cosmetic and pharmaceutical value (Blunt et al., 2005; 

Grosso et al., 2014; Haefner, 2003; Leal et al., 2012; Rocha et al., 2011; Sipkema et al., 

2005; Vignesh et al., 2011). About 40 years ago the first marine compounds were 

described in published reports, since then the discovery of bioactive compounds has 

progressed at a booming rate (Mendola, 2003). By 2011 around 3000 new natural 

products had been extracted exclusively from corals (Rocha et al., 2011). Nowadays, the 

screen for new natural products is still largely dependent on the harvest of wild specimens. 

This is a major constraint for the development of new marine drugs, due to two main 

bottlenecks, sustainability and replicability (Montaser and Luesch, 2012). Sustainability 

since  most marine natural compounds are mainly secondary metabolites, as such, their 

yields are very low on a wet-weight basis, requiring impracticable amounts of harvested 

biomass material to produce sufficient quantities of a given compound (Mendola, 2003). 

Replicability is hindered in wild harvesting by the environmental variability and 

community level changes to the chemical ecology of the target organisms, meaning that 

the chemical composition of individuals of the same species may vary spatial and 

temporally and therefore may not assure the supply of the target metabolite (Hay, 1996b).  

 

1.3.2 Corals in the marine ornamental trade 

 

Corals exhibit many shapes and colors making them desirable to display in captive 

reef systems. Their popularity promotes an ever growing demand for reef specimens, 

including both hard and soft corals, the majority of which are collected, sometimes 

unrelenting, form the wild. (Ellis, 1999; Green and Shirley, 1999).  

It is estimated that nearly 80% of all traded corals along with other reef organisms, 

collected from the ocean to the ornamental trade die, directly or indirectly, during capture, 

shipment, handling due to destructive fishing practices, poor handling and diseases 

(Rhyne et al., 2014; Wabnitz et al., 2003; Wood, 2001). The ornamental trade brought a 



4 
 

new and much needed source of income to coastal communities of the Indo-Pacific and 

improved access to coral reef organisms for the purpose of research and education 

(Tlusty, 2002; Tlusty et al., 2013) but, it also increased the use of destructive fishing 

practices, impacts on rare population and endemic species and the introduction of invasive 

species in foreign habitats (Calado, 2006; Gertzen et al., 2008; Olivotto et al., 2003; 

Tlusty, 2002).  

 

1.3.3 Coral reefs restoration 

 

In the face of severe degradation of reefs, active coral transplantation measures 

have become more regularly employed and recognized as a key management tool for 

rehabilitation of coral reefs, a practice meant to replace dead coral colonies and accelerate 

the reef natural recovery (Ammar, 2009; Chavanich et al., 2015; Epstein et al., 2003, 

2001). This practice involves the transplantation of whole coral colonies, coral fragments 

or seeding by planula larvae (Okamoto et al., 2012; Rinkevich, 2005; Yap, 2004). Various 

methodologies have been suggested, including the construction of in situ or ex situ 

nurseries to grow large numbers of coral fragments. Nursery-grown fragments are then 

transplanted to degrade reef sites (Epstein et al., 2001; Okamoto et al., 2012; Rinkevich, 

2005; Shafir et al., 2006).  

 

1.4 State of the art of coral aquaculture 

 

The extraction of bio-active compounds with bio-medical applications (Carlson, 

1999; Leal et al., 2013; Rocha et al., 2011), the ornamental aquarium trade (Olivotto et 

al., 2011; Tlusty, 2002; Wabnitz et al., 2003), and the coral reef restoration  (Bongiorni 

et al., 2011; Epstein et al., 2001; Shafir et al., 2006; Soong and Chen, 2003; Yap and 

Molina, 2003; Yap, 2000) have been increasing the demand for these organisms, leading 

to their massive harvesting (Castanaro and Lasker, 2003). Researchers, collectors and 

hobbyists began a worldwide effort in order to address the mitigation of the negative 

impacts caused by the harvest of these organisms from the wild (Castanaro and Lasker, 

2003; Wood, 2001) and therefore establish a sustainable approach to supply the coral 

demand (Wood, 2001). They began to focus on optimizing culture techniques to 



5 
 

maximize coral survival and growth, and reduce the associated production costs, 

contributing to the economic feasibility of coral aquaculture and offset wild specimens 

collection  (Carlson, 1999; Ellis and Ellis, 2002; Ellis and Sharron, 1997; Fox et al., 2005; 

Leal et al., 2013; Mendola, 2003; Parks et al., 2003; Pomeroy et al., 2006; Rocha, 2013; 

Sella and Benayahu, 2010; Soong and Chen, 2003). 

Coral aquaculture can be performed in situ or ex situ. Despite the low associated 

expenses, in situ aquaculture can make corals vulnerable to pathogens, predators and 

competitors (Rinkevich, 2005; Rocha et al., 2013b). On the other hand,  ex situ production 

involves higher start-up and production costs, but allows for a better production control 

of the biotic and abiotic parameters affecting coral growth (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; 

Forsman et al., 2006; Yap and Molina, 2003). Coral biomass can be continuously 

produced using homogenous environmental conditions, which is especially important for 

the purpose of extraction of natural products (Leal et al., 2013). As coral aquaculture in 

closed artificial seawater systems is being more commonly implemented, the process is 

becoming increasingly more simple and cost effective (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; 

Osinga et al., 2011). 

Coral aquaculture is a practice centered on the ability of corals to reproduce 

asexually by fragmentation (Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; Delbeek, 2001; Ellis and Ellis, 

2002; Ellis, 1999; Highsmith, 1982; Sella and Benayahu, 2010). The asexual propagation 

of hard and soft corals through fragmentation dates back to the 1960s (Delbeek, 2001), 

since then this simple and inexpensive method has been commonly used by researchers 

and aquarium hobbyists, for the mass production of corals, where it is possible to 

fragment a mother colony into several clones (Forsman et al., 2006; Rocha et al., 2013c; 

Sella and Benayahu, 2010).  Wild-collected or captive-grown colonies are used for the 

production of fragments. The latter are usually attached or glued by various processes 

until natural attachment is achieved (Delbeek, 2001). Fragmentation enables the biomass 

of a genotype to increase beyond the mechanical limit of an individual colony (Hughes et 

al, 1992), and helps maintain high growth rates (Hughes and Jackson, 1985), while 

displaying high survival rates of the frags and reduced impact on donor colonies (e.g. Fox 

et al, 2005), presenting therefore as a crucial step in most of coral production systems. 

Fragmentation can also produce large sample sizes with minimal genetic variation, which 

can be an advantage for some experimental designs (Shafir et al., 2003). 

For the success of zooxanthellate coral aquaculture it is important to consider 

multiple and interacting factors, such as light, water flow, genotype, temperature, 



6 
 

inorganic nutrients, fixation substrate or the fragmentation protocol (Ferse, 2010; Osinga 

et al., 2011; Rocha et al., 2013a,b,c ; Sella and Benayahu, 2010). Therefore, multifactorial 

culture experiments are desired, not only to maximize the productivity, but also to further 

unfold the interactions between potentially influential factors.  

Light, undoubtedly, plays a vital role in the growth of zooxanthellate corals. The 

efficiency of the photoautotrophic processes in these symbionts is largely affected by the 

light intensity and spectral quality (Al-Horani et al., 2003; Khalesi et al., 2009; Osinga et 

al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2013a,c ; Wijgerde et al., 2014, 2012) and, can affect their 

contribution to coral growth, metabolism (Apprill et al., 2007; Fitt and Cook, 2001; 

Marubini et al., 2001; Reynaud et al., 2004; Schlacher et al., 2007), physiology and 

survival (Venn et al., 2008). Light-related growth limitations are commonly caused by 

low internal pH due to low photosynthesis (Schneider and Erez, 2006), insufficient 

production (Titlyanov et al., 2001) or translocation of photosynthates (Marubini and 

Davies, 1996). However, corals exposed to high irradiance levels can also experience 

photoinhibition, which also translates in retarded growth (Iglesias-Prieto et al., 1992).  

Corals also require a solid and stable substrate for attachment and, safe and 

reliable “gluing” materials. In culture production, raising the corals off the bottom of the 

tank with small substrate blocks can reduce smothering. Several substrate types have been 

used as anchor material, including: plastic florist vials, scleractinian coral skeleton 

(aragonite), epoxy putties, ceramic tiles, fabricated blocks with sand, shell or aragonite, 

as well as fabricated plastic stands (Boch and Morse, 2012; Borneman and Loivrie, 2001; 

Ellis and Ellis, 2002; Ellis and Sharron, 1997; Forsman et al., 2006; Sella and Benayahu, 

2010; Tortolero-Langarica et al., 2014; Yap, 2004). As fixation methods, farmers and 

hobbyists commonly use rubber bands for its cost-effectiveness (Rocha et al., 2013a), 

cyanoacrylate glues for the immediate and strong bond they form (Bongiorni et al., 2011; 

Ellis and Sharron, 1997) and, more recently, n-butyl-2-cianoacrylate, which is used in 

several medical procedures  due to its lower toxicity ( Kumar and  Priyayadav, 2010).  

After fragmentation, coral fragments are more prone to necrosis and bacterial 

infection, which can result in death. The way in which a coral is cutted can have a 

significant effect on the survival of the fragment (Ellis and Sharron, 1997).

1.5 Sarcophyton sp. 

 

The species of the genus Sarcophyton (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Octocorallia: 

Alcyonacea) are ecologically important members of shallow reef communities in the 

Indo-West Pacific and Red Sea region, often found in high energy areas such as surge 

zones and tide pools, but also occurring in deeper water. (Ellis, 1999; McFadden et al., 

2006a). The incomplete knowledge regarding Sarcophyton sp.  taxonomy, caused by the 

existence of few diagnostic morphological features and by the historical lack of 

taxonomic work done on this genus, hinders their precise identification (McFadden et al., 

2006a).  Sarcophyton sp. has long been known to be a problematic taxon, as recognized 

by Verseveldt (1982): ‘‘Many investigators already pointed out the great variability found 

in this species, especially with respect to shape and size of the colony, and shape and 

dimensions of the coenenchymal sclerites in the stalk”. It is however a remarkably 

resilient genus, characterized by a distinctive bulky stalk, a mushroom shaped top called 

a capitulum, and by their sclerites shape, which are found in the interior coenenchymal 

tissue of the colony (Aratake et al., 2012). The hardiness displayed by Sarcophyton sp. 

enhances their potential as farmed coral, because they are able to survive handling stress 

during fragmentation and shipping.  

This genera is known to have many secondary metabolites, like sarcophytoxide 

(allelopatic), which are toxic and used by corals in competition for space, or as a strategy 

to inhibit growth and survival of their neighbors (Elahwany et al., 2013; Fleury et al., 

2004; Lages et al., 2006; Maida et al., 1995; Sammarco and Coll, 1992). They have been 

highly surveyed for their natural products, especially cembrane diterpenes and 

sesquiterpenes (antitumor activities) and are among the most popular and valued 

organisms in the marine aquarium trade and have (Badria et al., 1998; McFadden et al., 

2006a; Rocha et al., 2011; Rocha, 2013). For these reasons, Sarcophyton species make 

good candidates for commercial production. 

 

1.6 Objectives 

 

In this project proposed to optimize the ex situ coral production with emphasis on 

the factors affecting the success of the fragmentation process in Sarcophyton sp.. With 

that mindset several consecutive culture experiments were developed, some 



8 
 

multifactorial, to evaluate the effect of these factors and, the possible interactions between 

them. We studied three different light spectra (white, blue and red), two PAR 

(Photosynthetically Active Radiation) intensities (120 and 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1), two 

different substrates (plastic stands and calcium carbonate disks), three fixation techniques 

(rubber band, ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl)), 

two fragment positions (cut and intact side facing down) and, the interactions between 

them. Survival, fixation ratio, fixation force and photosynthetic efficiency were evaluated 

at the end of each experiment.  

 

2. Material and Methods 

 

The species employed in this study will be termed Sarcophyton sp., since recent 

studies have revealed a complex and incomplete taxonomy in this genus (Aratake et al., 

2012).  

 

2.1 Coral Husbandry 

 

A total of eighteen colonies of the soft coral Sarcophyton sp. (Figure 1), collected 

in Sumbawa, Indonesia, approximately between 5 and 15 m depth, were purchased from 

a marine aquarium wholesaler and transported to the laboratory facilities. 

The colonies were stocked in our laboratory culture system for a period of 14 days, 

with a photoperiod of 12L: 12D, to acclimatize to the experimental conditions (light 

regime, water parameters and circulation) and to detect the eventual presence of diseases 

or parasitical infections.  

Following the 14 days of acclimatization to water parameter and without any 

evidence of infection or disease, the colonies were prepared for fragmentation.  

 

2.2 Fragmentation 

 

Fragmentation was performed with a sterilized scalpel, latex gloves and a mask, 

in a board containing water from the experimental system, to discard all the mucus 

released by fragmentation. The capitulum of each mother colonies was fractionated, 



9 
 

producing fragments of similar size (approximately 1-2 cm2). After fragmentation, each 

coral fragment was attached to the respective labeled stand (Figure 2). The remaining 

colonies were kept in our laboratory system.

2.3 Experiment 1 (Light spectra) 

 

The spectral quality of light is assumed to be a parameter of outmost importance in 

any ex situ coral production, nonetheless, few studies have ever addressed this question 

(Rocha et al., 2013b; Wijgerde et al., 2014, 2012). Therefore in this experiment, the effect 

of three different light spectra (blue, white and red) on the post-fragmentation success of 

Sarcophyton sp. was studied. 

 

2.3.1 Experimental culture system (1) 

 

The system (Figure 3) was composed by three glass tanks (65L of water volume, 

0.50m L x 0.45 W x 0.31m H), both connected to a sump tank (145L of water volume, 

1m L x 0.45m W x 0.37m H). Each tank was equipped with a circulation pump (SICCE 

voyager nano, SICCE, Vicenza, Italy), which provided a water flow of, approximately, 

2000 L h?1. The sump was equipped with one protein skimmer (TMC V2Skim 1000, 

Bristol, UK), a biologic filter (composed of about 10L bio-balls), two submersible heaters 

(one Eheim Jäger 300W, Deizisau, Germany, and a SERA 200W, Heinsberg 

Germany), a UV filter (SUNSUN CUV-207 7W, Zhejiang, China) and one recirculation 

pump (Eheim 1262, Deizisau, Germany) to provide a water flow of, approximately, 1200 

L h?1 to the coral tanks. The white light tank was illuminated by two T5 fluorescent lamps 

Arcadia 24 W Marine White (Red Hill, UK), the red light tank by two T5 fluorescent 

lamps Aqualine 24 W Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany) and the blue light 

tank by two T5 fluorescent lamps REEF-SPEC™ 24 W Actinic (Red Sea, France) of 24 

W (Figure 4), with a photoperiod of 12L: 12D. The experimental system operated with 

synthetic saltwater (prepared by mixing Tropic Marin Pro Reef salt – Tropic Marine, 

Wartenberg, Germany – with water purified by reverse osmosis). Salinity was maintained 

at 35 through the daily addition of fresh water purified by a reverse osmosis system 

(Aqua-win RO-6080, Kaohsiung, Thailand). 

 



11 
 

2.3.2 Experimental design 

 

After the 14 days of acclimatization three mother colonies were fragmented (see 

2.2 Fragmentation) to produce 20 fragments each, in a total of 60 fragments.  The 

fragments were illuminated by a PAR intensity of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 and were 

secured with rubber bands to labeled plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle®, Bristol, UK) 

(Figure 6.b), as described by Rocha (2013). The fragments were distributed among the 3 

tanks of the experimental culture system, with each tank having a total of 20 fragments. 

Each mother colony contributed approximately equally to the number of fragments in 

each tank. This experiment ran for 60 days.  PAR value was measured with a Quantum 

Flux meter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor. 

 

2.3.3 Laboratorial analysis 

 

Several parameters were recorded:  the survival and fixation ratio (fragments 

fixed: fragments unfixed), the fixation force (see 2.8.1 Fixation force) at the end of the 

experiment. 

 

2.3.4 Data analysis 

 

The existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different light spectra, was tested using a 

?2 test. 

The existence of significant differences among the fixation force recorded was 

tested using a one way ANOVA and a Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of 

normality and homogeneity of variance were checked prior to the analysis through the 

Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. Tukey’s HSD test was used to determine 

differences between light treatments. Light spectra was used as the categorical factor to 

the performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 

software.

2.4 Experiment 2 (Light spectra x PAR intensity) 

 

 Light PAR intensity as a vital effect on coral photobiology, physiology and 

growth, as reviewed by Osinga et al. (2011). Furthermore, it represents one of the major 

expenses in any ex situ coral production and, for that reason, we decided to use two light 

PAR intensities in our next experiment, a low light PAR of 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 and a 

high light PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1, similar to the study of Rocha et al. (2013a). 

Spectral quality was also included (blue and red spectra).  A multifactorial experiment 

was set to study the effect of PAR intensity, spectra and their combined effect on the post-

fragmentation success of Sarcophyton sp.. 

 

2.4.1 Experimental culture system (2) 

 

The system (Figure 5) was composed by two glass tanks (218L of water volume, 

1.18m L x 0.43m W x 0.43m H), both connected to a sump tank (145L of water volume, 

1.18m L x 0.35m W x 0.55m H). Each tank was equipped with a circulation pump 

(Turbelle nanostream-6025 Tunze, Penzberg, Germany), which provide a water flow of, 

approximately, 2500 L h?1. The sump was equipped with two protein skimmers (APF-

600 Deltec, Delmenhorst, Germany), a biologic filter (composed of about 10 kg of live 

rock and bio-balls), two chemical filter bag with activated carbon, two submersible 

heaters (Eheim Jäger 150W, Deizisau, Germany), a UV filter (V2ecton 400, TMC, Bristol, 

UK) and two recirculation pumps (Eheim 1260, Deizisau, Germany) to provide a water 

flow of, approximately, 1500 L h?1 to the coral tanks. The upper tank was illuminated by 

four T5 lamps Aqualine Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany) of 54 W and, 

the lower tank by four T5 REEF-SPEC™ Actinic 22000K (Red Sea, France) of 54 W, 

providing a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 at the fragment level, under a photoperiod 

of 12L:12D. PAR value was measured with a Quantum Flux meter (Apogee MQ-200, 

Logan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor. The experimental system operates with 

artificial saltwater (Tropic Marine, Wartenberg, Germany)). Salinity was maintained at 

35 ‰ through the use of an osmoregulator (Deltec Aquastat 1000, Delmenhorst, 

Germany) which automatically compensates the evaporated water, with fresh water 

purified by a reverse osmosis system (Aqua-win RO-6080, Kaohsiung, Thailand). 



14 
 

2.4.2 Experimental design 

 

After the 14 days of acclimatization, six mother colonies were fragmented (see 

2.2 Fragmentation), producing 24 fragments each. The fragments were secured with 

rubber bands to labeled plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle®, Bristol, UK) (Figure 6 b) 

and then divided equally by the 4 treatments, for a total of 144 fragments (6 frags x 6 

mother colonies x 4 treatments). 

Each experimental tank had 72 fragments and, in each tank, half of the 72 

fragments (n=36) were placed on a 10 cm high platform (depth at which they received a 

PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1), and the other half were placed on the bottom of the 

tank (depth at which they received a PAR of 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1). PAR value was 

measured with a Quantum Flux meter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a 

submergible sensor.  This stage proceeded for 60 days. 

 

2.4.3 Laboratorial analysis 

 

The survival and fixation ratio and the fixation force (see 2.2 Fixation force) and 

photosynthetic efficiency (see 2.8.2 Photosynthetic efficiency) were recorded for each 

fragment at the end of the experiment. 

 

2.4.4 Data Analysis 

 

The existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 

test. 

The existence of significant differences among the fixation force and maximum 

photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PS II)(Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a 

factorial ANOVA and an Unequal N HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and 

homogeneity of variance were checked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks 

and Levene tests, respectively. Unequal N HSD test was used to determine differences 

between light spectra and PAR intensities. Light spectra and PAR intensity were used as 



15 
 

the categorical factor to the performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using 

the Statistica 12.0 software.

2.5 Experiment 3 (Light spectra x Substrate) 

 

Having found little research focusing on the response of coral fragments to 

different substrate types (Ellis and Ellis, 2002; Ferse, 2010) and, none carried out in ex 

situ systems, an experiment was set to address this question. The effect of a natural and 

rough substrate (calcium carbonate disks made from coral skeleton) versus a more flat 

and smooth artificial one (plastic stands, TMC Coral Cradle®, Bristol, UK), was tested, 

as described by Ellis &amp;amp; Ellis (2002) and Rocha et al. (2013a) respectively. 



16 
 

For this experiment  the spectra variable was kept, for which previous results were 

inconclusive and, therefore, stablished a multifactorial experiment to study the effect of 

substrate, spectra and their combined effect on post-fragmentation success of 

Sarcophyton sp.. 

 

2.5.1 Experimental design 

 

For this part of the experiment the same experimental conditions were used as in 

Experimental culture system 2, with the same light features and photoperiod.  

After the 14 days of acclimatization three mother colonies were fragmented as 

described before, producing 24 fragments each, which were then divided equally by the 

4 treatments (Red light x Plastic stand, Red light calcium carbonate stand, Blue light x 

Plastic stand, Blue light calcium carbonate stand), for a total of 72 fragments (6 frags x 3 

mother colonies x 4 treatments). 

Each experimental tank had 72 fragments placed on a 10 cm high platform (depth 

at which they received a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1) and, half of those 72 fragments 

(n=36) were attached with a rubber band to labeled calcium carbonate stands (Figure 6 

a), and the other half (n=36) fragments were attached to labeled plastic stands (TMC 

Coral Cradle®, Bristol, UK) (Figure 6b). PAR value was measured with a Quantum Flux 

meter (Apogee MQ-200, Logan, Utah, USA) with a submergible sensor.  This stage 

proceeded for 60 days. 

 

2.5.2 Laboratorial Analysis 

 

The survival and fixation ratio were recorded and, the fixation force (see 2.8.1 

Fixation force) and maximum photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (see 2.8.2 

Photosynthetic efficiency) of the fragments were analyzed at the end of the experiment. 

 

  

 

 

 



17 
 

2.5.3 Data Analysis 

 

The existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 

test. 

The existence of significant differences among the fixation force and maximum 

photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a factorial 

ANOVA and an Unequal N HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and 

homogeneity of variance were checked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks 

and Levene tests, respectively. Unequal N HSD test was used to determine differences 

between light spectra and substrate. Light spectra and substrate were used as the 

categorical factor to the performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using 

the Statistica 12.0 software. 

 

2.6 Experiment 4 (Fixation process x Light spectra) 

 

 Several fixation processes have been employed in coral production studies, as 

reviewed by Ellis (1999). These methods however, have not been considered as to have 

an influence on post-fragmentation success. This experiment aimed to study the effect of 

three different fixation processes (ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), Rubber band, N-butyl-

2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl)) and two light spectra (red and blue), and the possible 

interaction between them on the post-fragmentation success. 

 

2.6.1 Experimental design 

 

For this part of the experiment the experimental system applied was the same as 

for the previous experiment (Experimental culture system 2 (Figure 5)), with the same 

light features and photoperiod.  

After the 14 days of acclimatization four mother colonies were fragmented (see 

2.2 Fragmentation technical description), producing 12 fragments each, which were then 

divided equally by the 6 treatments, for a total of 72 fragments (3 frags x 4 mother 

colonies x 6 treatments). In each tank, we had 12 fragments fixed with rubber bands, 12 



18 
 

fixed with ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue (Henkel Ibérica, Bobadela, Portugal)) and 12 

fixed with n-butyl cyanoacrylate glue (B. Braun Histoacryl, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil). All 

the fragments were secured to plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle®, Bristol, UK) (Figure 

6.b) and placed on 10 cm high platform (depth at which they received a PAR of 120 ?mol 

quanta m?2 s?1). This experiment lasted for 60 days. 

 

2.6.2 Laboratorial analysis 

 

The survival and fixation ratio were recorded and, the fixation force (see 2.8.1 

Fixation force) and photosynthetic efficiency (see 2.8.2 Photosynthetic efficiency) of the 

fragments at the end of the experiment was analyzed. 

 

 2.6.3 Data Analysis 

 

The existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 

test. 

The existence of significant differences among the fixation force and 

photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a factorial ANOVA and a 

Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were 

checked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. 

Tukeys’s HSD test was used to determine differences between light spectra and fixation 

process. Light spectra and fixation process were used as the categorical factor to the 

performed analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 

software. 

 

2.7 Experiment 5 (Fragment position) 

 

With no studies found addressing the influence of fragment position (cut side or 

intact side facing down) a final experiment was performed to address this question.

 2.7.1 Experimental design 

 

For this part of the experiment the experimental system applied was the same as 

for the previous experiment (Experimental culture system 2 (Figure 5)), with the same 

light features and photoperiod.  

Using the last 2 colonies 40 fragments were produced, which were then fixed with 

N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) to the plastic stands (TMC Coral Cradle®, Bristol, 

UK)(Figure 6.b) and placed in the experimental tank, on 10 cm high platform (depth at 

which they received a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1). Half of the fragments (n=20) 

were fixed by their intact side and half by their cutted side. 

Although the experimental system was the same, it was only used the red spectra 

tank, because this spectra yielded the best results in previous experiments. The tank was 

equipped with 4 T5 fluorescent lamps Aqualine T5 Plant Grow (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, 

Germany) providing a PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1. A photoperiod of 12L: 12D was 

used. This stage lasted for yet another 60 days.

2.7.2 Laboratorial Analysis 

 

The survival and fixation ratio were recorded and, the fixation force (see 2.8.1 

Fixation force) and photosynthetic efficiency (see 2.8.2 Photosynthetic efficiency) of the 

fragments at the end of the experiment was analyzed. 

 

 2.7.3 Data Analysis 

 

The existence of significant differences among the survival and fixation ratio for 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured under the different treatments, was tested using a ?2 

test. 

The existence of significant differences among the fixation force and 

photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) recorded was tested using a one way ANOVA and a 

Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were 

checked prior to the analysis through the Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. 

Tukeys’s HSD test was used to determine differences between fragment positions. 

Fragment position used as the categorical factor to the performed analysis. Statistical 

analyses were carried out using the Statistica 12.0 software. 

 

2.8 Water Parameters 

 

The water parameters measured throughout the experiments on both systems, 

were as follows: temperature at 25-27°C, pH at 8-8.4, salinity at 35, NH3 ? 0.1mg/L, 

NO2 ? 0.1 mg/L, NO3 ? 10 mg/L, Ca ? 400-420mg/L and KH at 7-10 dKH. Partial water 

changes of approximately 10% of the total system volume were performed on weekly 

basis.

2.9 Laboratorial analysis 

 

2.9.1 Fixation force 

 

The fixation force (Newtons) was measured using a designed system (Figure 7) 

equipped with a digital dynamometer Kern FK10 (resolution of 0.005 N; bottom detection 

limit of 0.01 N; upper detection limit of 10 N). The system works as a scale: a water 

dripping system fills the cup on the right arm, which steadily increases the pressure 

exerted on the fragment, once the fragment is dislodged from its substrate the 

dynamometer on the left arm records the fixation force.  

In order to calculate the value of the fixation force it was necessary to record the 

attaching area of each fragment, through the use of milimetric paper. After displacement 

of the fragment was, it was immediately placed over the milimetric paper, and the fixation 

area was outlined. Based on this boundary it was calculated de fixation area that was used 

to calculate de fixation force, through the following formula (Santos et al., 2005):  

 

???????? ????? (
?

???
) =  

???????? ???????? ????? (?)

???????? ???? (???)

2.9.2 Photosynthetic efficiency 

 

Through Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry ((Schreiber et al., 1986) 

the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PS II) was measured within the 

endosymbiotic Symbiodinium spp., by the end of each experiment. For that a Walz Junior 

Pam (Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) (Rocha et al., 2013a) was used. Measuring actinic 

and saturating light was provided by a blue LED-lamp (peaking at 450 nm, half-

bandwidth of 20 nm), that was delivered to the sample by a 1.5 mm-diameter plastic 

fiberoptics bundle. The fiberoptic was positioned perpendicularly to the surface of the 

coral fragment, and all measurements were made at a fixed distance of 1 mm. 

Measurements were carried out at the end of the experience, 2 h after the start of the 

daylight period, to ensure the full activation of the photosynthetic apparatus. 

To determine the maximum quantum yield of PSII, coral fragments were dark-

adapted for 15 min, after which one saturation pulse (0.8 s) was applied to determine the 

minimum fluorescence, Fo, and the maximum fluorescence, Fm. Fo and Fm are then used 

to determine the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Schreiber et al., 1986), by the formula: 

??/?? = (

)

3.2.2 Fixation ratio 

 

Fixation ratio was significantly different among treatments (?2 0.05, d.f.2, P = 

0.036), being higher in the red spectra than in the blue and in the white spectra, (?2 0.05, 

d.f.1, P = 0.029) and (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P = 0.046), respectively. However, no differences 

were found in fixation force between white and blue treatments (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P &gt; 0.05) 

(Table 1). 

 

3.2.3 Fixation force 

 

Regarding the fixation force, significant differences among the different spectra 

treatments (one way ANOVA, F (2, 56) = 4.551, p = 0.015) were found. The post hoc 

analysis revealed that the fixation force was significantly higher in the red spectra than in 

the blue spectra (p = 0.014), and white spectra was no significantly different between blue 

and red spectra, (p = 0.109) and (p = 0.706) respectively. 

 

3.3 Experiment 2 (Light spectra x PAR intensity) 

 

3.3.1 Survival 

 

Overall differences between all the treatments related to survival (?2 0.05, d.f.3, P 

= 0.015) were found.  Significant differences between the tested spectra (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P 

= 0.015) were found, observing a higher survival under the blue spectra, but no significant 

differences between PAR intensities (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P &gt; 0.05). The multiple ?2 test 

comparison revealed that the Red spectra/60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 PAR treatment had 

significantly higher fragments survival than all the other treatments (Figure 8).

refer to mortality and upper case letters to fixation ratio. 

 

3.3.2 Fixation ratio 

 

There were no significant differences between all the treatments related with 

fixation ratio (?2 0.05, d.f.3, P &gt; 0.05) as well as between spectra (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P &gt; 0.05).  

However, in the case of PAR a significantly higher fixation ratio under the PAR of 120 

?mol quanta m?2 s?1 (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P = 0.012) was found. The multiple ?2 test comparison 

revealed only differences between PAR of 120 and PAR of 60 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1, under 

blue light spectra (Figure 8). 

 

3.3.3 Fixation force 

 

 In relation to the fragments fixation force a significantly influence of PAR 

intensity (Figure 9), with the factorial ANOVA test (factorial ANOVA, F (1, 102) = 

9.226, p = 0.003) was detected. Posterior Unequal N HSD post hoc comparison showed 

no significant differences between treatments.

 The one way ANOVA performed to analyze the differences between PAR 60 and 

PAR 120 under red light spectra, and PAR 60 and PAR 120 under blue light spectra 

showed that PAR treatment produced significant differences under both blue and red 

spectra, ( F (1. 45) = 4.360, p = 0.042) and (F (1. 57) = 5.188, p = 0.027), respectively. 

However Unequal N HSD post hoc comparison only revealed significant difference under 

red light spectra (p = 0.035).

 No significant differences were found in fragment survival in any of the 

experimental treatments. 

 

3.5.2 Fixation ratio 

Overall, there are significant differences among treatments (?2 0.05, d.f.5, P = 

0.003). Differences between spectra (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P = 0.001) were found, but not 

between fixation process (?2 0.05, d.f.1, P &gt; 0.05). The multiple ?2 comparison between

3.5.3 Fixation force 

 

Through a factorial analysis test significant influence of spectra (factorial 

ANOVA, F (1, 66) = 51.604, p = 0) and fixation process (factorial ANOVA, F (1, 66) = 

7.390, p = 0.001) was found. Tukey’s post hoc comparisons between treatments revealed 

that the Red light/N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) and the Red 

light/Ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue) were the treatments yielding best results in terms of 

fixation force. 

One way ANOVA’s comparisons between treatments revealed significant 

differences between spectra under all the three fixation processes used, N-butyl-2-

cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) (one way ANOVA, F (1, 22) = 16.598, p = 0.001), 

Ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue) (F (1. 22) = 23.253, p = 0) and Rubber band (F (1. 22) = 

16.838, p = 0). It also revealed significant differences between N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate 

(Histoacryl) and Rubbers bands (F (1. 22) = 11.260, p = 0.03) and, Ethylcyanoacrylate 

(Superglue) and Rubbers bands, F (1. 22) = 9.072, p = 0.006) (Figure 15).

3.6 Experiment 5 (Fragment position) 

 

In this final experiment, no survival was observed and all the fragments (n=20) 

were fixed by the end of the experiment. No significant differences were found between 

fixation force and photosynthetic efficiency of fragment position treatments, (F(1. 18) = 

0.110, p = 0.744) and (F(1.18)  = 0.001, p = 0.983).

conclusions. Red crosses represent treatments that were excluded. 

 

4. Discussion 

 

4.1 Post-fragmentation recommendations 

 

The experiments with the higher stocking densities (2 and 3) were the experiments 

were higher survival was observed and also the greater number of episodic releases of 



34 
 

mucus (data not shown). Mucus is proposed to be a defense mechanism of corals against 

environmental stressors, acting as a physical barrier and sloughing to avoid colonization 

by invasive microbes (Brown and Bythell, 2005; Bythell and Wild, 2011). These stocking 

high densities, can carry risks related to pathogen communicability, and virulence 

(Sheridan et al., 2013), increasing the incidence of diseases, thus, leading corals to 

increasing the exudation of carbon assimilated by their zooxanthellae in the form of 

mucus (Davies, 1984). These episodic releases of mucus can, to some extent, be related 

to the higher survival registered, possibly serving as an indicator of coral stress in 

response to environment. 

Fragments at this stage of post-fragmentation are more vulnerable to suffer 

necrosis, possibly by the microbiological contamination of the damaged tissues. 

Maintenance of high water quality, adequate inorganic nutrient supply and the use of UV 

filters are good practices to minimize coral survival in production. 

 

4.2 PAR intensity 

  

The survival recorded was not significantly different between the PAR intensities 

studied (Experiment 2). Similar to our work, Sella and Benayahu (2010) found no 

significant differences in survival between 35 and 130 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 in 

Sarcophyton sp. fragments cultured ex situ, but observed that extreme light PAR 

intensities (20 and 250 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1) triggered higher survival rates. All these 

evidences suggest that Sarcophyton sp. has an interval of tolerance to PAR intensity 

somewhere between these PAR values. Furthermore, we found that PAR intensity 

positively influenced fixation ratio and fixation force, with PAR of 120 ?mol quanta m?2 

s?1 yielding the best results. Our conclusion is that Sarcophyton sp. fragments have a 

better post-fragmentation performance under higher PAR intensities, within their 

tolerance range. An analogue phenomenon, known as light enhanced calcification, is well 

documented in scleractinian corals, for which an increase in light intensity within the 

tolerance values of the coral leads to an increase in growth/calcification (Al-Horani et al., 

2003; Huston, 1985; Meesters et al., 1994; Muller-Parker and D’Elia, 1997; Schutter et 

al., 2008). 



35 
 

In the face of these results, the PAR 120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1 was stablished as 

the best PAR intensity value to improve the performance of Sarcophyton sp. fragments 

post-fragmentation. 

 

A gradual light acclimatization should be performed in order to increase survival 

(Sella and Benayahu, 2010). 

 

 

4.3 Spectra 

 

Not all wavelengths are used equally by the different zooxanthellate coral species, 

which is related with ecophysiological differences among coral and symbiont species  

(Iglesiasprieto and Trench, 1994), and with selective absorption of visible light by 

seawater (Mass et al., 2010). By comparing the action spectra of zooxanthellae 

photosynthetic pigments with the wavelength emission of the white light treatment, it was 

observed an overlap in the 420-480nm range, but little in the wavelengths of 550 and 600, 

correspondent to green and yellow respectively, where the white light treatment has peaks 

of emission. Zooxanthella photosynthetic pigments can perform photosynthesis in the 

spectral range of light between 400 and 700 nm, the so called Photosynthetically Active 

Radiation (PAR) (Lalli and Parsons, 1997). However, maximum rates of photosynthesis 

are observed in the wavelength ranges of 400-550 nm (violet, blue) and 620-700 nm (red) 

(see Figure 5d, (Lalli and Parsons, 1997), as observed by Rocha et al., (2013) for the 

photosynthetic pigments of Sarcophyton cf. glaucum zooxanthella. Possibly this previous 

evidence can explain the high survival of 60% (although no statistical significant) 

observed under the white spectra treatment. A similar finding was reported in one study 

that found that Sarcophyton sp. exhibits lower growth rates under T8 fluorescent lamps 

(control group), which have a similar wavelength emission as our white light treatment 

(Fernandes et al., 2014). 

In this study, red light spectra compared to blue and white spectra yielded the 

overall best results regarding survival, fixation ratio and fixation force. Through the 

analysis of the wavelength emission of red and blue light treatment (Figure 4) it was 

observed that all light treatments had emissions on the blue wavelength range, but only 

the red light treatment exhibited emissions of low energy red light. We can therefore 



36 
 

theorize that red light may be an important sensory cue (Kinzie III et al., 1984) with a 

photophysiological enhancement effect on Sarcophyton sp. performance, which is 

plausible considering that these are shallow water corals (McFadden et al., 2006a), 

normally exposed to full PAR spectra in their natural habitats (Dustan, 1982). Due to the 

presence of some high energy blue light in the red treatments it is not clear whether red 

light has a photophysiological enhancement effect per se or if acts in combination with 

blue light. Antagonistic effect was found by Wijgerde et al. (2014), who found that red 

light represses photophysiologically the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, a coral 

with a deeper vertical range of distribution. Similarly, Rocha et al. (2013b) found that 

blue light promotes high growth performances in the Acropora formosa and Stylophora 

pistillata. Our analogue studies suggest that corals are chromatically adapted to their 

surrounding light environment, which can be explained by the minimum light 

requirements related the spectral quality of the light exhibited by the zooxanthellae (Mass 

et al., 2010). Furthermore they show how highly species-specific the effects of spectra 

can be, and highlights the need for species-specific light optimization (Wijgerde and 

Laterveer, 2013). 

The overall Fv/Fm results did not exhibit significant between treatments in any of the 

experiment employed, being generally high and close to the maximum values reported in 

the literature for corals (Kuguru et al., 2010; Levy et al., 2003; Rocha et al., 2013c; 

Winters et al., 2009, 2006). These results indicate that our fragments physiologically 

healthy under all light treatments tested, depicting the remarkable flexibility and 

adaptability of these symbionts (Apprill et al., 2007; Gorbunov et al., 2001; Iluz and 

Dubinsky, 2015; Robison and Warner, 2006; Titlyanov et al., 2001). 

Scleractinian corals are known to undergo a dynamic resource management to 

repair damaged tissues, maintaining the integral structure of the colony (Nagelkerken et 

al., 1999; Van Woesik and Jordán-Garza, 2011). This healing process happens at the 

expense of growth and reproduction (Meesters et al., 1994; Ward et al., 2002; Weil et al., 

2009). These energy trade-offs are even more complex considering that corals are clonal 

organisms that rely on zooxanthellae for energy (Van Woesik and Jordán-Garza, 2011).  

Although this phenomenon is not well understood in octocoralles, it is possible that the 

fragments had to allocate resources to repair the damaged tissues after fragmentation, 

relying on zooxanthellae to keep a positive energy balance for colony maintenance. We 

speculate this light related post-fragmentation performance, after observing that the main 



37 
 

factors affecting survival and fragment fixation identified during the course of the study 

were light related parameters (spectra and PAR intensity). 

 

4.4 Substrate 

 

Substrate type had no influence on survival, fixation ratio, fixation force or 

photosynthetic efficiency in neither of the experiments undertaken. A similar study 

corroborate these results (Schlacher et al., 2007). It is suggested that the performance of 

fragments post-fragmentation do not depend on the substrate type but rather on the 

substrate durability (Ferse, 2010). Therefore, the plastic stands were chosen as standard 

substrate type for further coral fragmentation cultures, due to its higher cost-effectiveness. 

Calcium carbonate stands are, on the other hand, more time consuming and require 

specialized machinery to be prepared. 

 

4.5 Fixation process 

 

Regarding the fixation process, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) and 

Ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue), under red light, both promoted the highest fixation force 

of all treatments. However, since N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) performed better 

than Ethylcyanoacrylate (Superglue) in terms of fixation ratio, it was chosen as standard 

method for further fragmentation procedures. 

 

4.6 Fragment position 

 

Fragment position had no influence in any of the parameters evaluated.  As such, 

fragments can be secured to the substrate with no special considerations regarding their 

position, increasing the efficiency of the procedure, thus reducing the costs of manpower.

5. Conclusions 

 

The designed experimental approach was important to identify optimum post-

fragmentation conditions in Sarcophyton sp.. It was concluded that the post-

fragmentation performance of Sarcophyton sp. fragments in ex situ culture systems was 

mainly dependent on the artificial lighting regimes used. Therefore, the light spectral 

characteristics represents a vital component of photoacclimation that should be 

considered especially during this critical period. This study provided evidence that:  

(1) Spectra plays an important role on the survival, fixation ratio and fixation force 

of Sarcophyton sp. fragments post-fragmentation, with red light spectra achieving better 

results;  

(2) Under the tolerance levels of Sarcophyton sp. holobiont, higher PAR 

intensities yield the best results for fixation ratio and fixation force, is this case PAR of 

120 ?mol quanta m?2 s?1; (3) The performance of the fragments was similar for fragments 

grafted onto calcium carbonate disks or plastic stands;  

(4) Fragment position had no influence in the success of fragmentation. Logically, 

these conditions have to be coupled with aquaculture best practices, such as the 

maintenance of top water quality throughout the growth out procedure. 

Given the continued popularity of corals and the negative impacts caused by their 

harvest from the wild, aquaculture assumes a leading role towards the sustainable use of 

marine resources by optimizing the current employed techniques for coral production.
