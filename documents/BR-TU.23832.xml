RESUMO 

 

Os depósitos de caulim que ocorrem na porção média do Rio Capim, leste da Sub-Bacia 

de Cameta, inserem-se na Formação Ipixuna, de idade cretácea superior, a qual se destaca por 

apresentar uma das maiores concentrações mundiais de caulim de excelente qualidade para a 

indústria de celulose. Um grande volume de trabalhos acadêmicos com enfoque geoquímico foi 

conduzido nestes depósitos, porém sem levar em consideração os aspectos faciológicos e 

estratigráficos, que são relevantes para entender sua origem e ocorrência. Somente recentemente, 

trabalhos sedimentológicos e estratigráficos mais detalhados destes depósitos de caulim foram 

apresentados, o que gerou uma série de novas considerações a respeito dos paleoambientes de 

deposição. Este tipo de estudo despertou interesse para se conduzir uma investigação integrada 

considerando-se aspectos sedimentológicos, estratigráficos, petrográficos e isótopos estáveis de 

hidrogênio e oxigênio, a fim de discutir os processos geológicos que podem ter influenciado na 

origem e evolução dos depósitos de caulim soft e semi-flint da Formação Ipixuna. 

A análise sedimentológica e estratigráfica apresentada neste estudo teve caráter 

complementar a investigações anteriores, tomando-se por base a presença de novas exposições ao 

longo das frentes de lavra que disponibilizaram novas informações importantes ao entendimento 

dos ambientes de deposição. Assim, a porção inferior da Formação Inpixuna caracteriza-se por 

uma unidade de caulim do tipo soft, o qual por apresentar-se com preservação das estruturas 

primárias, possibilitou melhor entendimento dos processos de sedimentação. Estes depósitos 

incluem principalmente arenitos e argilitos caulinizados formados em ambientes de canal de maré 

influenciado por sistema fluvial (associação de fácies A), canal de maré (associação de fácies B), 

planície de maré/mangue (associação de fácies C), e barra/planície de areia dominada por maré 

(associação de fácies D). Estes depósitos são atribuídos a sistema estuarino do tipo dominado por 

maré. A unidade superior, conhecida como semi-flint, é dominantemente maciça, porém um 

estudo em paralelo conduzido durante o desenvolvimento desta tese revelou a presença de lobos 

deltaicos e canais distributários. 

O estudo petrográfico e de microscopia eletrônica de varredura nos depósitos estudados 

levou à melhor caracterização textural dos tipos de caulinita presentes nas unidades de kaolin soft 

e semi-flint. Apesar da composição original fortemente modificada destes depósitos, informações 

ópticas revelaram inúmeras feições reliquiares distintas. Os depósitos de caulim soft são 



 2

caracterizados por arenitos quartzosos caulinizados e pelitos laminados ou maciços, os quais são 

compostos por fragmentos líticos de rochas meta-vulcânicas e vulcânicas félsicas, bem como 

rochas metamórficas e graníticas. Estas litologias foram fortemente modificadas durante o 

processo de caulinização da Formação Ipixuna, processo que teria obliterado a composição 

primária dos grãos do arcabouço. Durante este processo, três tipos principais de caulinita foram 

geradas, definidas com base no tamanho e textura como Ka, Kb e Kc. A caulinita Ka ocorre 

dominantemente associada aos arenitos caulinizados, sendo caracterizada por cristais 

pseudohexagonais a hexagonais, com diâmetros de 10-30 µm, podendo ocorrer na forma de 

aglomerados formando “livretos” (booklets) ou sob forma vermicular contendo até 400 µm de 

comprimento. A caulinita Kb ocorre dominantemente nos pelitos, consistindo de cristais 

pseudohexagonais a hexagonais de 1-3 µm de diâmetro, ocorrendo na forma isolada, formando 

intercrescimentos dos tipos caótico, face-a-face, paralelo a pseudo-paralelo. A caulinita Kc ocorre 

como cristais pseudohexagonais a hexagonais com diâmetros regulares de 200 nm. Sua 

distribuição é dispersa ao longo da unidade de caulim soft, aumentando em abundância em níveis 

de paleossolo que ocorre no topo da unidade. Os depósitos de caulim semi-flint são constituídos 

principalmente de grãos retrabalhados dos depósitos de caulim soft e grãos provenientes de 

rocha-fontes metamórficas e graníticas. As caulinitas da unidade de semi-flint são 

dominantemente representadas por caolinita Kc, gerada principalmente durante intemperismo 

pretérito. 

As integração de estudos faciológicos, estratigráficos, ópticos e isótopos estáveis de 

deutério (?D) e oxigênio (?18O) dos depósitos de caulim do Rio Capim permitiu melhor entender 

a gênese e evolução dos tipos de caolinita Ka+Kb e Kc. Os depósitos de caulim soft apresentam 

valores de ?18O variando de 6,04‰ a 19,18‰ nas caulinitas Ka e Kb, e de 15,38‰ a 24,86‰ nas 

caulinitas Kc. Os valores de ?D variam de –63,06‰ a 79,46‰, e de –68,85‰ a –244,35‰, 

respectivamente. Os depósitos de caulim semi-flint são caracterizados por valores isotópicos de 

?18O e ?D entre 15,08‰ e 21,77‰, e -71.31‰ e -87.37‰, respectivamente. Baseando-se nestes 

dados e na composição isotópica da água meteórica e de sub-superfície, foi possível concluir que 

as caulinitas não se formaram em equilíbrio com as condições intempéricas atuais, e sim 

representam a composição isotópica de seu tempo de formação, podendo refletir contaminações 

mineralógicas proveniente da substituição parcial e/ou total dos grãos originais do arcabouço. Os 

valores isotópicos das caulinita do tipo Kc da unidade de semi-flint são amplamente variáveis em

decorrência da variedade de fontes, incluindo caulinitas retrabalhadas dos depósitos subjacentes 

de caulim soft, bem como caulinitas formadas durante diferentes fases de intemperismo, além de 

fases tardias de caulinita geradas ao longo de fraturas.

ABSTRACT 

 

The kaolin deposits that occur in the Rio Capim area, east of Cametá Sub-Basin, are 

inserted in the Ipixuna Formation. This unit distinguishs for presenting one of the largest 

worldwide kaolin concentrations of excellent quality to the cellulose industry. Beyond the 

economic character, a great volume of academic works focusing these kaolin deposits had led to 

pedological and geochemical approaches, but without taking into account their sedimentologic 

aspects, which are important to understand their genesis. Detailed sedimentologic and 

stratigraphic studies of the Rio Capim kaolin have been increasingly carried out in the last years, 

which led to the paleoenvironmental interpretations for the Ipixuna Formation, as well as to 

discuss better the mode of formation of the soft and semi-flint kaolin units that are typical of this 

unit. These works served to motivate the integration of sedimentologic and stratigraphic data with 

optical studies combined with hydrogen and oxygen isotope geochemistry in order to discuss the 

geologic processes involved in the origin and evolution of the soft and semi-flint kaolin units. 

The sedimentological analysis consisted in a more detailed facies description and stratigraphic 

analysis of newly open quarries that were not available during previous investigations. The 

additional exposures led to a better characterization of the lower kaolin unit, known as the “soft 

kaolin”, which is well stratified, favoring facies analysis. Hence, the soft kaolin unit consists of 

kaolinitized sandstones and kaolinitized pelites that were formed in tidally influenced fluvial 

channels (Facies Association A), tidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies 

Association C), and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat (Facies Association D). These depositional 

environments are attributed to a tide-dominated estuarine system. 

Petrographic studies and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) of the kaolin deposits in 

the study area had their composition was strongly modified after sedimentation. The soft kaolin 

consists of kaolinitized quartz sandstone and either laminated or massive pelites, which are 

composed by fragments of meta-volcanic lithic and volcanic felsic rocks, as well as metamorphic 

and granitics rocks. These lithologies were strongly modified during kaolinitization, as revealed 

by the intense replacement of the framework grains by kaolinite of three types, named herein as 

Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite occurs dominantly associated with kaolinitized 

sandstones, being characterized by pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 µm in diameter, which are 

organized as booklets or vermicular forms that reach up to 400 µm in length.  Kb kaolinite

dominantes in the pelites, and consists of pseudohexagonal crystals 1-3 µm in diameter, 

occurring as isolated, face-to-face and parallel to pseudo-parallel crystals. Kc kaolinite forms 

pseudohexagonal to hexagonal crystals of 200 nm in diameter. It occurs dispersed through the 

soft unit, increasing significantly in abundance in association with paleosols at the top of the unit. 

The semi-flint kaolin deposits are constituted mainly of reworked grains derived from the 

underlying soft kaolin unit that are mixed with grains derived from metamorphic and granitic 

sources. These deposits are dominantly composed of Kc kaolinite that was formed during 

weathering.   

The deuterium (?D) and oxygen (?O) isotope analysis of the kaolin deposits from the 

study area helped to discuss better the evolution of the different types of kaolinites described 

above. Hence, the soft kaolin deposits display ?O values varying between 6.04 ‰ and 19.18 ‰ 

in the Ka+Kb kaolinites, and between 15.38 ‰ and 24.86 ‰ in the Kc kaolinite. The ?D values 

from this unit vary from – 63.06 ‰ to 79.46 ‰, and from –68.85‰ to -244.35‰ in the Ka+Kb 

and Kc kaolinites, respectively. The semi-flint kaolin deposits are characterized by ?O and ?D 

values ranging from 15.08‰ to 21.77‰, and from -71.31‰ to -87.37‰, respectively. Based on 

these data and on the isotopic composition of both meteoric and ground waters, it was possible to 

conclude that the kaolinites had not been formed in balance with modern weathering. These 

values represent the isotopic composition during the time of formation of the kaolinites, as well 

as mineralogical contamination of framework grains that are now replaced by kaolinites.

the Ipixuna Formation (Late Cretaceous-?Early Tertiary), Rio Capim Area, Northern Brazil; 

Capítulo 3 - Origin of the Rio Capim kaolin with basis on optical (petrographic and SEM) data; e 

capítulo 4 - Origin of the Rio Capim kaolinites (northern Brazil) revealed by ?18O and ?D isotope 

analysis. A análise sedimentológica consistiu nos estudos de campo incluindo-se descrição 

faciológica e estratigráfica afim de melhor definir as unidades estratigráficas inseridas no termo 

“Formação Ipixuna”, bem como sua caracterização faciológica e paleoambiental. A continuidade 

dos estudos faciológicos/estratigráficos foi realizada devido à ocorrência de novas frentes de 

lavras com características faciológicas ainda não descritas. Este fato possibilitou a coleta de 

dados faciológicos e estratigráficos adicionais que contribuíram para em melhor entendimento da 

dinâmica evolutiva do sistema estuarino anteriormente proposto. A análise óptica de 60 seções 

delgadas e complementadas pela análise de microscopia eletrônica de varredura consistiu na 

análise petrográfica dos depósitos de Caulim, a fim de discutir a origem dos diferentes tipos de 

caulinta de acordo com as litologias e estratigrafia da Formação Ipixuna. As análises de isótopos 

estáveis 1H/2H e 16O/18O em caulinita foram conduzidas baseando-se na análise faciológica e 

estratigráfica, e petrográfica no intuito de discriminação de fases mineralógicas dos diferentes 

tipos de caulinita, entender a gênese e evolução dos depósitos de Caulim da porção média do Rio 

Capim e testar a aplicabilidade do método empregado.

1 INTRODUÇÃO 

 

 

1.1 CONTEXTO GEOLÓGICO E RELEVÂNCIAS DO TRABALHO 

 

A Sub-Bacia de Cametá esta limitada pelo Lineamento Tocantins (noroeste), Plataforma 

Bragantina (norte/nordeste) e Arco Capim (leste), e compreende uma área de aproximadamente 

12.200 Km2, sendo localizada no extremo sul do Sistema de Graben do Marajó. Seu 

preenchimento sedimentar é definido com base em dados de sub-superfície, sendo representado, 

principalmente, por depósitos cretáceos, terciários e quaternários, os quais foram formados 

durante a fase de abertura do Oceano Atlântico Equatorial, iniciada no Eocretáceo (Azevedo, 

1991; Galvão, 1991) (Figura 1.1). A sucessão sedimentar cretácea inclui as formações Breves 

(Aptiano-Cenomaniano) e Limoeiro (Cretáceo Superior), formadas em ambientes variando de 

fluvial a marinho raso (Schaller, 1971; Villegas, 1994). Os estratos terciários são conhecidos 

como Formação Marajó (Paleoceno-Eoceno), e os quaternários como Formação Tucunaré 

(Quaternário), ambos atribuídos a ambientes marinho-raso a transicional (Schaller et al., 1971). 

Estas nomenclaturas estratigráficas não têm sido utilizadas para os depósitos que afloram na 

borda leste da Sub-Bacia de Cametá, os quais são representados, da base para o topo, pelas 

formações Itapecuru, Ipixuna e Barreiras, e depósitos Pós-Barreiras e Argila de Belterra. A 

Formação Itapecuru, aflorante ao longo das margens do Rio Capim, é faciologicamente bastante 

similar aos depósitos albianos da área de Açailândia (Anaisse Júnior, 1999) e Formação 

Alcântara do Grupo Itapecuru exposto na Bacia de São Luís-Grajaú (Rossetti, 1997). A Formação 

Ipixuna, de idade inferida cretácea superior-terciário inferior(?) (Jupiassú, 1970), é representada 

por estratos caulínicos, os quais foram previamente atribuídos a ambientes fluvio-lacustres (Góes, 

1981) e, posteriormente, reinterpretados como registro de depósitos típicos de ambientes 

marinho-transicional (Santos Júnior, 2002). A Formação Barreiras, de idade miocênica 

média/superior (Arai et al., 1988), tem sido atribuída a ambientes transicionais do tipo estuarino 

(Arai et al., 1988; Rossetti et al., 1989; Rossetti et al., 1990; Rossetti, 2000, Rossetti, 2001; 

Santos Júnior, 2002). Os Sedimentos Pós-Barreiras, de idade suposta plio-pleistocênica (Rossetti, 

2001), ocorrem discordantemente sobrepostos à Formação Barreiras, sendo atribuídos a 

processos gravitacionais e, em parte, eólicos (Rossetti et al., 1989). A Argila de Belterra

compreende uma cobertura sedimentar argilosa, maciça, tendo sua gênese relacionada à: a) 

formação in situ; b) transporte lateral e deposição de material saprolítico; e c)transporte vertical 

de material saprolítico por termitas (Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999). 

A correlação estratigráfica entre as unidades descritas em superfície e sub-superfície sugere que 

os depósitos da Formação Ipixuna compreendem estratos da Formação Limoeiro. Esta 

interpretação baseia-se no posicionamento estratigráfico acima de depósitos albo-cenomanianos 

correlacionáveis à Formação Alcântara da Bacia de São Luís-Grajaú, o que leva a sugerir 

possível idade cretácea superior. Isto é ainda sugerido pela ocorrência de depósitos terciários de 

idade provável miocênica médio/superior sobrepostos à Formação Ipixuna. 

A Formação Ipixuna na região do Rio Capim, leste da Sub-Bacia de Cametá, destaca-se 

por apresentar uma das maiores concentrações mundiais de depósitos de caulim de excelente 

qualidade à industria de celulose (Krebs &amp;amp; Arantes, 1973; Murray &amp;amp; Keller, 1993). Estes 

depósitos têm motivado diversos estudos de caráter científico, principalmente geoquímicos, 

enfocando os aspectos genéticos e evolutivos dos depósitos de caulim, porém sem ênfase na 

caracterização de seus aspectos sedimentológicos e estratigráficos. Somente recentemente foi 

feito um esforço no sentido de caracterização faciológica da Formação Ipixuna na Região do Rio 

Capim (Santos Jr., 2002), o qual possibilitou o estabelecimento preliminar de um modelo 

deposicional flúvio-estuarino para esta unidade, embora a evolução deste sistema através do 

tempo geológico ainda permaneceu por ser estabelecida. Os trabalhos geoquímicos propuseram 

origem in situ para os depósistos de caulim relacionados inicialmente ao desenvolvimento de 

perfil bauxítico e, posteriormente, ao intemperismo profundo ligado ao rebaixamento progressivo 

do lençol freático (Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999). Porém, estudos 

preliminares nesta região vêm demonstrando haver uma relação direta entre as diversas fácies da 

Formação Ipixuna e os tipos de caulim. Além disto, o reconhecimento de superfícies de 

descontinuidades internas a Formação Ipixuna e coincidente com a delimitação dos depósitos de 

caulim conhecidos como soft e o semi-flint levou a suspeitar da importância do siginificado 

estratigráfico no entendimento genético e evolutivo dos tipos de depósitos de Caulim da região 

do Rio Capim (Santos Jr., 2002; Rossetti &amp;amp; Santos Jr. 2003). Esta observação levou a reforçar a 

idéia que a mudança no tipo de caulim possa estar vinculada a controle faciológico/estratigráfico. 

Estudos relacionados à caracterização morfológica e estrutural dos diferentes tipos de caulinita de 

acordo com os aspectos sedimentológicos e estratigráficos da Formação Ipixuna não tinham sido

sistematicamente conduzidos até o momento. O conhecimento detalhado das variações de fácies 

sedimentares de acordo com a caracterização das espécies de caulinita representa uma abordagem 

inédita sobre o desenvolvimento evolutivo das diferentes fases de caulinita da Formação. 

O emprego de isótopos estáveis de oxigênio e hidrogênio como ferramenta para o 

reconhecimento de minerais intempéricos formados em tempos e, portanto, condições 

paleoambientais distintas podem revelar condições de equilíbrio isotópico com seu ambiente 

genético, já que uma vez formados, estes minerais retém sua assinatura isotópica, refletindo as 

condições climáticas do tempo de formação (Savin &amp;amp; Hsieh, 1997).  

 Por fim, os depósitos de caulim da área do Rio Capim são carentes de investigações 

científicas realizadas de forma integrada (p.e., faciologia, estratigrafia, petrografia e isótopos 

estáveis de O e H). Sendo assim, este trabalho se propôs à caracterização dos estratos caulínicos 

na Região do Rio Capim, procedendo-se a uma análise integrada de aspectos sedimentológicos, 

estratigráficos, ópticos (petrografia e microscopia eletrônica), mineralógicos e geoquímicos, a fim 

de possibilitar uma discussão sobre os fatores que influenciaram sua origem e evolução da 

Formação Ipixuna. 

 

1.2 OBJETIVOS 

 

Esta tese teve como objetivo caracterizar os estratos caulínicos da Formação Ipixuna na 

Região do Rio Capim procedendo-se a uma análise integrada dos aspectos sedimentológicos, 

estratigráficos, mineralógicos e de isótopos estáveis. Além disto, consistiu também no 

prosseguimento aos estudos faciológicos e estratigráficos da Formação Ipixuna, afim de melhor 

caracterizar o sistema estuarino proposto, bem como entender sua dinâmica evolutiva dentro do 

contexto de variações do nível do mar relativo. Os estudos ópticos foram conduzidos na 

finalidade de entender a gênese e evolução das diferentes fases de formação de caulinita, bem 

como caracterizar petrograficamente os depósitos de caulim de acordo com as características 

faciológicas/estratigráficas. A determinação da composição isotópica de oxigênio e hidrogênio 

dos depósitos de caulim da Região do Rio Capim foi empregada de acordo com as características 

faciológicas e estratigráficas, e petrográficas, a fim de gerar considerações paleoambientais de 

origem e evolução da Formação Ipixuna, bem como discutir a aplicabilidade do método.

1.3 MÉTODOS  

 

Neste trabalho foram adotadas a seguinte metodologia: análise faciológica/estratigráfica, 

análise óptica e geoquímica de isótopos de O e H. O estudo faciológico/estratigráfico de detalhe 

consistiu no mapeamento complementar da arquitetura de fácies deposicionais, e confecção de 

perfis/seções verticais em novas frentes de lavra observando-se os parâmetros sedimentológicos 

(p.e., estrutura, textura, mineralogia, padrão de paleocorrentes, traços fósseis e geometria dos 

corpos sedimentares). Este método foi conduzido nos depósitos cretáceos da Formação Ipixuna 

na porção média do Rio Capim, devido as novas frentes de lavra regurlamente espostas nas minas 

da IRCC e PPSA, o que representou a coleta de dados paleoambientais adicionais e contribuiu 

para o melhor entendimento da dinâmica evolutiva deste sistema estuarino.  

O estudo óptico consistiu na análise de 60 seções delgadas sob microscópio petrográfico e 

eletrônico de varredura, a fim de melhor caracterizar os principais constituintes mineralógicos e 

entender os processos sin- e pós-deposicionais que controlaram a geração dos diferentes tipos de 

caulinita. As amostras de caulim foram amostradas seguindo rígido controle faciológico e 

estratigráfico, de forma a registrar variações litológicas e de processos sedimentares, bem como 

melhor caracterizar o conteúdo mineralógico e observar os padrões morfológicos das caulinitas. 

Além disto, tomou-se cautela para se efetuar a coleta de amostras progressivamente abaixo e 

acima das superfícies de descontinuidade, de forma a possibilitar a análise de possíveis 

influências de processos associados ao desenvolvimento das mesmas na formação dos diferentes 

tipos de caulinita.  

A análise isotópica de hidrogênio e oxigênio consistiu na separação granulométrica prévia 

das frações de caulinita Ka, Kb e Kc através de decantação, as quais foram previamente 

estipuladas pela microscopia óptica. As análises de isótopos estáveis foram realizadas seguindo 

metodologia dos laboratórios especializados da Universidade de Indiana (EUA). Os dados de 

isótopos estáveis de oxigênio e hidrogênio foram obtidos através da reação de amostras de 

caulinita com BrF5 e por aquecimento a vácuo a 900ºC ou mais, após o início do outgassing, 

respectivamente. Adicionalmente foram feitas análises de isótopos da água meteórica e de 

subsurperfície para efeitos de comparação com os dados isotópicos da caulinita.

2.1 ABSTRACT 

 

Exposures along open quarries located in the eastern Cametá Sub-Basin provide an 

opportunity to assess further discussion focusing on the depositional environments of the Upper 

Cretaceous-?Lower Tertiary Ipixuna Formation. The lower part of this unit emphasized herein, 

known as the “soft kaolin”, consists mostly of kaolinitized sandstones and mudstones that exhibit 

well preserved sedimentary structures that are particularly favorable for facies analysis and 

paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The sandstones are chiefly cross-stratified, typically with 

low angle, locally reverse oriented foresets with reactivation surfaces and/or mud drapes. These 

characteristics, together with a trace fossil assemblage consisting of Ophiomorpha, 

Thalassinoids, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos, conform to deposition in a 

coastal setting influenced by tidal processes. Although a previous study has documented tidal 

processes during deposition of the soft kaolin (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003), this paper shows 

that the influence of tidal currents was much more important than initially proposed. Hence, the 

kaolinitized deposits are attributed to tidally influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A), 

tidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C), and tidal sand 

bar/tidal sandy flat (Facies Association D), all together comprising a tide-dominated estuarine 

system. 

  

Keywords: soft kaolin, Ipixuna Formation, Cametá Sub-Basin, tide-dominated estuary, 

sedimentary facies, paleoenvironment.

2.2 INTRODUCTION 

 

Several mineralogical and geochemical studies (e.g., Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; 

Kotschoubey et al., 1996, 1999; Souza, 2000) have been undertaken on the Ipixuna Formation 

(Upper Cretaceous-?Lower Tertiary), which is exposed in the eastern Cametá Sub-Basin. These 

studies have been motivated by the fact that this unit contains one of the largest kaolin reserves in 

the world, the Rio Capim kaolin, which has received particular attention due to its high 

brightness. Despite the economic interest, sedimentologic studies aiming paleoenvironmental 

interpretations of the Rio Capim kaolin quarries are still inadequate to provide a detailed 

reconstruction of its mode of deposition.  

Traditionally known as fluvial to lacustrine in origin (Góes, 1981), the Ipixuna Formation 

has been more recently related to a coastal depositional system (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003). 

Sedimentary facies described in that study were attributed to tidal processes. Thereby, several 

tidally influenced depositional environments were recognized, which collectively led the authors 

to the interpretation of a wave-dominated estuary. This interpretation was based on the presence 

of tidal delta deposits along road cuts between the towns of Ipixuna and Paragominas, which 

were considered correlative to the soft kaolin unit exposed in the kaolin quarries (Santos Jr. and 

Rossetti, 2003).  However, stratigraphic studies have revealed that this unit is more complex than 

initially thought, encompassing different stratigraphic units attributed to high-frequency 

depositional sequences (Rossetti, 2004; Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2006). Taking this into account, 

correlation of the tidal delta deposits with the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation in the Rio 

Capim area is problematic. The continuous kaolin exploitation has resulted in a series of fresh 

exposures that allow more detailed facies and stratigraphic analyses. As a result, other facies 

assemblages can be characterized, providing additional elements for a more refined 

reconstruction of the depositional model. 

The goal of this paper is to provide a more complete description of the facies and facies 

associations of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation. These are based on exposures 

recently available in two quarries, the IRCC and the PPSA in the Rio Capim area (Fig. 1), in 

order to furnish a better interpretation of both the sedimentary processes and the depositional 

environments. Based on these data, it is possible now to assay a wave-dominated estuarine model 

previously proposed for the soft kaolin.

2.3 GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 

 

The Cametá Sub-Basin, together with the Limoeiro, Mexiana and Mocajuba sub-basins, 

constitute the Marajó Graben System, located at the mouth of the Amazon River, northern Brazil. 

These structures were formed by NW–SE and NNW–SSE normal faults, as well as NE–SW and 

ENE–WSW strike-slip faults during the opening of the Equatorial South Atlantic Ocean 

(Azevedo, 1991; Galvão, 1991; Villegas, 1994; Costa et al., 2001).  

The Cametá Sub-Basin is up to 10 km thick, and includes Cretaceous and Cenozoic 

deposits (Fig. 2), which are mostly known from subsurface data. The Cretaceous succession 

includes the Breves Formation (Aptian-Cenomanian) and the Limoeiro Formation (Late 

Cretaceous), considered to be fluvial and marine transitional in origin (Villegas, 1994). The 

Tertiary and Quaternary deposits include the Marajó Formation (Paleocene-Eocene) and the 

Tucunaré Formation (Pleistocene), both formed within marine to transitional environments. 

Exposures of Cretaceous rocks in the Cametá Sub-Basin are only found in the eastern 

margin of the basin, where Albian/Cenomanian deposits are cut by a kaolinitized Upper 

Cretaceous unit referred to as the Ipixuna Formation. This unit is particularly well exposed in the 

Rio Capim Kaolin area, where it approaches thicknesses of 40 m and consists of kaolinitized 

mudstones and sandstones. Previously regarded as a single stratigraphic unit, the Ipixuna 

Formation has been recently subdivided into two intervals, bounded by a discontinuity surface 

that is marked by paleosol (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003; 2006; Rossetti, 2004). The lower part 

of the interval corresponds to the deposits referred to herein as the soft kaolin unit. The upper part 

corresponds to a hard kaolin unit, known as the semi-flint, due to the composition of flint-like fire 

clay that consist of endured kaolinite showing no plasticity when ground up. An intermediate unit 

characterized by soft-sediment deformed deposits bounded also by discontinuity surfaces occurs 

between the soft kaolin and semi-flint at some localities (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003). The 

facies analysis presented herein is focused solely in the soft kaolin unit, which bears the 

commercially exploited kaolin.

2.4 FACIES ANALYSIS OF THE SOFT KAOLIN 

 

The soft kaolin deposits of the Ipixuna Formation in the Rio Capim area correspond to a 

nearly 20 m thick, fining-upward unit, consisting of kaolinitized, locally lenticular or tabular 

sandstones, as well as mudstones, and conglomerates. Where the base of these deposits is 

exposed, an unconformity (cf. Rossetti, 2004) marked by a lag of mudstone clasts and iron-

cemented, coarse-grained to pebbly sandstones separates them from the underlying Albian to 

Cenomanian rocks (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003). The top of the soft kaolin unit is also an 

unconformity, marked by a paleosol that local displays a thin (up to 20 cm thick) interval of 

lateritic concretions overlain by the semi-flint kaolin unit (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003).  

Despite the high degree of kaolinitization, which is primarily due to replacement of lithic 

grains and detritic clay minerals, the soft kaolin is characterized by well-developed primary 

stratification, providing the basis for reconstructing the depositional processes and 

paleoenvironmental settings. Based on geometry, sedimentary structures, grain sizes, and suite of 

trace fossils, four intergradational facies associations were recognized and attributed to (Figs. 2 

and 3): 1. tidally-influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A); 2. tidal channel (Facies 

Association B); 3. tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C); and 4. tidal sand bar/tidal sandy 

flat (Facies Association D). Facies Association A, dominant in the base of the studied quarries, 

grades upward into deposits that show stronger tidal influence producing a typical fining-upward 

successions. Facies associations B and C are better developed in the PPSA quarry, whereas 

Facies Association D is more abundant in the RCC quarry.  

 

2.4.1 Facies Association A: Tidally influenced Fluvial Channel 
 

Facies association A (Fig. 3A-E) is up to 5.5 m thick and occurs at the base of the soft 

kaolin deposits, where it consists primarily of sandstones composed of abundant quartz grains. 

Intraformational conglomerates and heterolithic mudstones/sandstones are also present. This 

facies association comprises fining- and thinning-upward packages that are up to 2.5 m thick and 

are bounded at the base by erosional discontinuity surfaces. Where exposures are laterally 

continuous, the basal surface of the fining/thinning-upward successions displays a broad concave 

upward shape, up to 300 m wide (Fig. 3A-D). Trace fossils are very rare in this facies association, 

including only undetermined vertical burrows. 

 20



 21

Three facies are present in this association including, in order of decreasing abundance: 

tabular/trough cross-stratified or laminated sandstone (Facies St);  intraformational conglomerate 

(Facies Ci); and heterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht). The sandstones (Fig. 3E) are, in 

general, poorly sorted, consist of sub-rounded, coarse- to medium-grained sands, and display 

tabular and trough cross-stratification or cross-lamination (Facies St), the latter with set 

thicknesses averaging 0.3 m and less than 5 cm, respectively. The cross sets, which typically 

decrease in size upward, dip consistently at low angles (typically between 10-20o). Although they 

dip dominantly to the N/NE, oppositely dipping S/SW cross sets are common in this facies (Fig. 

3D). Additionally, reactivation surfaces are abundant and define foreset packages averaging 10 

cm thick, which are locally marked by mud drapes (Fig. 2).  

Facies Ci is dominantly confined to the base of the fining-upward successions, and 

consists of poorly sorted conglomerates composed of clasts of laminated mudstones.  These 

average 5 cm in diameter, and occur mixed with poorly sorted quartz granules. Sedimentary 

structures, where present, are incipient and dominated by crude trough cross stratification and 

normal grading.  

Facies Ht consists of interbedded, fine to very fine-grained sandstones and laminated 

mudstones that form wavy and lenticular beddings. This facies is only locally found at the top of 

some fining/thinning upward successions, where it forms beds that are less than 0.4 m thick.

 23

Interpretation: Facies Association A is attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channels. The 

presence of deposits with concave upward basal surfaces, though not exclusive to, is suggestive 

of flow confinement within channels. Where this feature is not present, the fining/thinning- 

upward facies successions are bounded by sharp, erosional basal surfaces, and attest to deposition 

during decreasing flow energy, as typical of channel fills. Facies Ci records episodes of highest 

energy, when channels were scoured into underlying muddy deposits. The muddy accumulations 

were eroded and re-deposited as lags at the channel bottom. Facies St was formed by migration of 

small to medium scale, 2D- and 3D-bedforms within channels, and Facies Ht records alternating 

sand and mud deposition formed as topset beds during channel abandonment.  

Facies Association A is attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channels formed in proximal 

estuarine areas, near the limits of the fluvial realm. Although weak, tidal currents might reach 

these inner estuarine areas and rework sediments brought from the fluvial channels. The 

recognition of this type of setting in the geological record might be problematic (e.g., Ashley and 

Renwick, 1983; Allen, 1991; Hori et al., 2001; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1992; 

Plink-Bjorklund, 2005), particularly where the distribution of the depositional environments 

throughout a proximal-distal transect cannot be observed, as in the case of the study area. 

However, the poor sorting, very coarse sand to gravel grain sizes, and scarcity or absence of 

bioturbation are features that led to claim a fluvial origin for this facies association, 

distinguishing it from other channel deposits formed under dominant tidal processes (see Facies 

Association B described below).  

Facies Association A displays features that cannot be justified exclusively by 

unidirectional fluvial flows. The bipolar paleocurrent data, coupled with the common reactivation 

surfaces and mud drapes separating packages of foresets, are features suggestive of some degree 

of tidal reworking. The dominance of foresets dipping consistently at low angles is a further 

evidence of tidal influence, as migration of 2D- and 3D-bedforms in tidal settings typically 

results in cross sets that display low angle dipping foresets (Shanley et al., 1992; Plink-

Bjorklund, 2005).  

Considering the foregoing interpretation, it is noteworthy that the position of Facies 

Association A, lying at the base of the soft kaolin unit, is a situation expected when a fluvial 

system is flooded during a transgression to form an estuarine valley (e.g., Dalrymple et al., 1992; 

Zaitlin et al., 1994). 

 23



 24

2.4.2 Facies Association B: Tidal Channel  
 

Facies Association B (Figs. 3D, 4 and 5) is up to 10 m thick and consists of : tabular and 

trough cross-stratified/laminated sandstone (Facies St) and horizontal laminated sandstone 

(Facies Sh), alternating sandstone and mudstone displaying heterolithic bedding (Facies Ht), and 

subordinate intraformational conglomerate (Facies Ci). These deposits, which are typically 

bounded at the base by broad concave upward surfaces with lengths of up to 200 m (Figs. 4A-C), 

are internally organized into fining- and thinning-upward successions averaging 3 m thick. More 

rarely, this facies association comprises entire intervals of heterolithic bedding (Fig 4B and C), 

which are cut internally by multiple erosive basal concave upward surfaces that are locally 

mantled by intraformational conglomerate.  

Facies St consists of moderately sorted, coarse- to very fine-grained, tabular and trough 

cross-stratified sandstones having grains that are mostly subangular to subrounded. The cross 

sets, up to 0.3 m thick, consistently display low angle foresets. Paleocurrent measurements 

indicate main vectors to the NNE and SSW (Fig. 3D). A typical feature of Facies St is stacked 

packages of foresets averaging 5-10 cm thick that are defined by reactivation surfaces and/or 

mudstone drapes. Facies St locally grades laterally into fine- to very fine-grained, horizontal 

laminated sandstone (facies Sh). The sandstones are, in general, moderately sorted with 

subrounded grains and form packages that are 0.1-0.2 m thick, and commonly bounded by mud 

drapes.  

Facies Ht comprises alternating layers of medium- to fine-grained sandstone and 

mudstone, forming wavy, lenticular and flaser bedding, that might dip at low angles (i.e., &gt;10o). 

Individual lithological packages are up to 20 cm thick. Thicknesses of sandstone and mudstone 

beds are not constant upwards, rather varying progressively into alternating thicker and thinner 

bundles, the latter displaying a higher concentration of mud layers (Fig. 4D and E). The 

sandstone layers are moderately to well sorted. Thicker sandstone layers are internally 

characterized by plane parallel stratification, cross stratification, or are structureless. Locally, 

cross strata display oppositely dipping foresets. The mudstone and siltstone may display parallel 

lamination or appear massive.  

Facies Ci occurs locally, typically mantling concave upward surfaces. It consists of sub-

angular to sub-rounded mudstone and sandstone intraclasts up to 20 cm in diameter. Facies Ci is 

generally massive, or displays crude trough cross-stratification and normal grading. 

 24



 25

A typical feature of Facies Association B is the abundance and variety of trace fossils, 

including Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos (Fig. 5).

 28

Interpretation: Like facies association A, Facies Association B was also formed by confined 

flows within channels, as indicated by the basal concave upward erosional bounding surface. The 

internal organization, configuring thinning- and fining-upward successions formed by the upward 

gradation from intraformational conglomerates to sandstones and into heterolithic bedding of 

sandstone and mudstones, attests to deposition during waning flow, typical of channels prone to 

lateral accretion. 

Internal features that favor channel deposition under the influence of tidal currents 

include: 1) an abundance of reactivation surfaces and mud drapes within cross sets; 2) oppositely 

dipping foresets; 3) low-angle dipping cross sets; and 4) alternating thicker and thinner packages 

of sandstones and mudstones within the heterolithic facies. Generation of all these structures 

requires fluctuating current energy, as occurs most typically in tidal settings In particular, the 

successions of alternating thicker and thinner bundles of the heterolithic facies are attributed to 

sediment aggradation under influence of tidal currents that vary in strength and duration on a 

daily and monthly basis. The alternations of sandier and muddier packages may be related to 

neap-spring tidal variations (Nio and Yang, 1991). The typical fining/thinning upward 

successions suggest that tidal channels filled up more or less continuously during rising sea level 

(Dalrymple et al., 1992).  

The proposed deposition by tidal processes in brackish water conditions is consistent with 

the ichnologic assemblage described in this facies association. The low-diversity association of 

Ophiomorpha, Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos is consistent 

with deposition in nearshore settings influenced by stressed environmental conditions (Benynon 

and Pemberton, 1992; MacEachern and Pemberton, 1994; Pemberton et al., 2001; Uchman et al., 

2004). 

Considering the proposed tidal channel interpretation for Facies Association B, the 

inclined heterolithic strata (Facies Ht) are related to lateral accretion on tidally influenced point 

bars, with sandstones and mudstones recording high and low tidal flow stages, respectively. This 

type of deposit is usually associated to the presence of channels with high sinuosity (Thomas et 

al., 1987; Smith, 1988; Fenies and Faugères, 1998; Nouidar and Chellaï, 2001; Mack et al., 2003; 

Gao, 2004; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005).  

Sedimentary and biogenic features similar to the ones recorded here have been found in 

association with many tidal channel deposits described in the literature (e.g., Clifton, 1983; 

 28



 29

Smith, 1988; De Boer, 1989; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Nio and Yang, 1991; Plink-Bjorklund, 

2005). 

 

 
2.4.3 Facies Association C – Tidal Flat/?Mangrove 
  

Facies Association C (Fig. 4A) is better developed in the PPSA quarry, is up to 5 m thick, 

and records the finest deposits of the soft kaolin unit. It consists essentially of tabular packages of 

distinctively yellow to red colored, highly bioturbated, heterolithic-bedded sandstones and 

mudstones. These deposits are laterally continuous for up to 1 km and are intergraded with facies 

associations B and D. 

This association is internally characterized by an overall fining- and thinning-upward 

succession, and consists of only two facies: heterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht) and 

mudstone (Facies M). Like Facies Association B, Facies Ht, represented mostly by linsen, is 

organized into several minor cycles of 0.3-0.4 cm. Then form packages of sandstones and 

mudstones that progressively change their thickness, varying from thicker to thinner upward (Fig. 

3). Facies M consists of thicker packages of mudstones displaying only streaks of coarse-grained 

siltstones and very fine-grained sandstones.  

Facies Association C is highly bioturbated, mainly recording traces that are comparable to 

those of the previous association. One except on is the absence of Skolithos and Ophiomorpha. 

 

Interpretation: Facies Association C is interpreted as the record of tidal flat settings, which might 

have been associated with mangroves, though root marks were not recognized probably to the 

intense kalinitization. A tidal flat is consistent with the intergrading of this facies association with 

Facies Association B (Tidal Channel) and Facies Association D (Tidal Sand Flat/Sand Bar). 

Deposition in a flat-lying area is suggested by the tabular geometry and great lateral continuity of 

the association. The mudstones indicate deposition from suspensions in low energy 

environments, while the heterolithic deposits conform to a setting with alternating traction 

sediment transport and deposition from suspensions (Collinson, 1996). In addition to a genetic 

association with other tidal deposits, the upward change in thickness of sand/mud bundles of the 

heterolithic facies attests to tidal currents as the main depositional process. 

 29



 30

 The sole occurrence of heterolithic deposits and mudstones in Facies Association C 

suggests intertidal and supratidal deposition. The progradation of heterolithic deposits into 

mudstones produces a vertical fining-upward succession, consistent with tidal flat progadation 

(Klein, 1985). The thickness of the tidal flat succession in the study area indicates a macrotidal 

regime, with a minimum paleotidal range of 5 m. 

The ichnologic assemblage is used as a further confirmation of the proposed depositional 

setting. Hence, like Facies Association B, the trace fossils are typical of estuarine environments. 

The absence of Ophiomorpha and Skolithos is due to decreases in energy, as these traces are 

more common in high-energy environments. Ophiomorpha and Skolithos are also typical of areas 

subjected to high sedimentation mobility (Zonneveld et al., 2001; Malpas et al., 2005; Savary et 

al., 2004).  

 

 

2.4.4 Facies Association D – Upper Flow Regime Tidal Sand Flat/Sand Bar 
 

Facies Association D (Fig. 6A-G), up to 5 m, is very widespread in both of the studied 

quarries, where it grades laterally and vertically into facies associations B and C (Figs. 1 and 2). 

Like Facies Association C, these deposits are laterally continuous, forming tabular packages that 

are bounded at the base by either planar or only slightly undulating (though not erosive) surfaces. 

These deposits might also be lenticular, with lenses up to 0.4 m thick and 6 m long. Fining- and 

thickening-upward cycles are present. 

This facies association differentiates from the previous association on the basis of 

predominance of horizontally stratified sandstones (Fig. 6A), with subordinate heterolithic 

deposits (Facies H). The sandstone consists of three facies: horizontal-laminated to low-angle 

dipping cross-stratified sandstones (Facies Shl), tabular- and trough cross-stratified sandstones 

(Facies St), and climbing current ripple cross-laminated sandstones (Facies Sc). These facies are 

characterized by well-sorted, well-rounded, fine- to very fine-grained sandstones, displaying high 

concentrations of heavy minerals on plane beddings (Fig. 6B). Sets in Facies Shl, which 

dominates in this association, ranges in thickness from 0.4-0.5 m, and indicates northward 

paleoflows. An interesting feature of Facies Sc is the abundance of parting lineations, which 

indicate a NE/SW azimuth for paleoflow (Fig. 6C). Other features associated with Facies Shl are 

pinch and swell structures and symmetrical (oscillation) ripple marks. In addition, undulating 

 30



 31

laminations displaying internal truncations are common and form broad scours or swales with 

either symmetrical or asymetrical geometries (Fig. 6D). Facies Sc occurs only locally, being 

characterized by tabular or highly undulating lower set boundaries. Facies St and Sc are 

subordinate, and intergrade with facies Shl. Facies St alternates rhythmically with Facies Shl, 

resulting in individual packages 10-20 cm thick. 

Heterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht), alternating with trough cross-stratified 

sandstone (Facies St), occurs as lenses averaging 0.5 m thick and 8 m long. These are interbedded 

with the tabular sandstone described above. The sandstones show well-rounded, well sorted, fine- 

to medium-grained sand, and display cross lamination and small- to medium-scale cross 

stratification. Locally, cross sets with abundant reactivation surfaces and highly undulating set 

boundaries are present. Facies Ht and St are typically arranged into coarsening- and thickening- 

upward successions.  

Trace fossils dispersed in this facies association consist of Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha, 

Skolithos, and Planolites (Fig. 6E-G).

 32



 33

Interpretation: Facies Association D is interpreted as tidal sand bar/sand flat deposits, based on 

prevalence of tabular sandstones internally displaying horizontal to low-angle dipping 

stratification. These characteristics imply deposition along a shallow flat area. The abundance of 

parting lineation in Facies Shl indicates that sediment accumulation took place during prevailing 

upper-flow-regime conditions (Reineck and Singh, 1980; Yagishita et al., 2004). The rhythmic 

alternation of Facies Shl and Facies St indicates fluctuating conditions from upper to lower flow 

regime. Considering the overall proposed depostional setting, these facies might have been the 

product of tidal processes. The presence of swell and pinch, symmetrical ripple marks, and the 

large swales indicate frequent wave reworking (e.g., de Raaf et al., 1977). In particular, scours 

similar to the ones described here (Figure 6C) are common in nearshore areas that have 

undergone periods of higher energy flow, suggesting storm wave reworking (e.g., Bourgeois, 

1980; Cheel and Leckie, 1993; Hori et al., 2001; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). The abundance of 

heavy minerals is consistent with flux and reflux.  

 The above mentioned characteristics, added to the gradation of Facies Association D with 

the other facies associations described herein support deposition in an upper flow regime tidal 

sand flat depositional setting (see also Klein, 1985; MuCubbin, 1988; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). 

The lateral gradation of tidal sand flat deposits with sandstone lenses displaying  fining- 

and thickening-upward cycles are suggestive of significant volume of sand accumulation along a 

series of tidal sand bars. Many ancient tidal sand bars are recorded by similar upward-coarsening 

lenticular sandstone bodies (Houthuys and Gullentops, 1988; Dalrymple, et al. 1992; Reading 

and Collinson, 1996; Willis, 2000; Heap et al., 2004). Tidal bars are commonly recorded in 

association with upper flow regime tidal sand flat deposits in confined areas along coasts 

dominated by high tidal velocities (Dalrymple et al., 1992; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005).  

The ichnological assemblage, represented by disperse traces of mostly Thalassinoides is 

in agreement with the proposed setting, since these traces form typically in nearshore areas 

undergone to episodic or constant environmental changes (Wightman et al. 1987; MacEachern 

and Pemberton 1992; Pollard et al. 1993; Gowland 1996).

2.5 DISCUSSION OF THE DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEM 

 

The new facies data presented herein confirms tidal currents as the main process 

responsible for deposition of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation. Evidence for tidal 

processes includes the abundance of cross sets with reactivation surfaces, commonly mantled by 

mud drapes, the local presence of tidal bundles, and reversed foresets. The ichnological 

assemblage represented by low diversity of traces, consisting of Thalassinoides, Planolites, 

Teichichnus, Taenidium, Skolithos  and Ophiomorpha, attests a nearshore setting with stressing 

water conditions due to the mixture of marine and freshwater inflows. This, together with the 

variety of facies associations interpreted above, is consistent with a tide-dominated estuarine 

model (Fig. 7).

RCC quarry; 2=profile in the PPSA quarry). 

 35



 36

A previous study of the Ipixuna Formation had tentatively suggested the action of tidal 

currents during its deposition. This paper, however, demonstrates that tidal processes were much 

more significant than initially thought, and controlled most of the sediment accumulation in all of 

the depositional environments identified in the soft kaolin unit. In addition, mapping of new 

exposures has led to a more complete characterization of the various facies associations and their 

spatial relationships.  

A proposed correlation of the tidal deposits of the Ipixuna Formation from the studied 

quarries exposed along the Road BR-010, located 60 km apart, led to the proposal of a wave-

dominated estuarine system for the soft kaolin unit (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003). The data 

presented herein, however, support depositional settings that are more consistent with a tide-

dominated estuarine model. A possibility exists, thus, that the tidal delta deposits present along 

the Road BR-010 are not correlatable with the soft kaolin unit. These tidal delta deposits might 

correspond to either an adjacent depositional system or a part of a barrier complex associated 

with the subsequent stage of the estuary evolution with increased influence of wave action.  

The genetic association of tidal-influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal 

flat/mangrove, and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat deposits, is typical of tidal dominated estuarine 

system for the soft unit (e.g., Woodroffe et al., 1989; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 

1992; Harris et al., 1992; Chappell and Woodroffe, 1994; Mulrennan and woodroffe, 1998; Hori 

et al., 2001; Heap et al., 2004; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). An abundance of tidal channel deposits 

that interfinger with sand bar and upper flow regime sand flat deposits are more commonly 

recorded in tide-dominated estuaries formed along mesotidal to macrotidal coast (Klein, 1985; 

Houthuys and Gullentops, 1988; Buatois and Mangano, 2003). Tidal bar and sand flat deposits 

had been previously recognized in the study area, but were thought to be volumetrically 

subordinate, have formed when upper flow regimes developed within channels (Santos Jr. and 

Rossetti, 2003). The newly available exposures reveal, however, that they constitute one of the 

main facies associations of the soft kaolin unit, second only to tidal deposits. 

The distribution of the studied deposits, both vertically and laterally, provides information 

for interpreting the estuary evolution. The tidal-influenced, fluvial-channel deposits (Facies 

Association A), which are dominant near the base of the kaolin unit, attest to formation in inner 

estuarine areas. These deposits characterize the transition between fluvial and tidal sedimentation, 

thus displaying characteristics that are inherent from both fluvial and tidal processes (Dalrymple

et al., 1992; Hori et al., 2001; Cooper, 2002). Features diagnostic of tidal processes, such tidal 

bundles, are scarce or even absent from such settings due to the interference of fluvial influx 

(Leckie and Singh, 1991; Hori et. al., 2001; Cooper, 2002; Heap et al., 2004). The velocity 

fluctuation of tidal currents results in highly unsteady flows, producing frequent reactivation 

surfaces with mud drapes, as observed in Facies Association A. The abundance of these surfaces 

separating foreset packages that are only few cm thick, facilitates the differentiation of tidal 

influence from other disturbances in fluvial system (e.g., seasonal fluctuations; Ladipo, 1988; 

Thorez et al., 1988). 

The overall vertical gradation from tide-influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A) 

to tidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C) and tidal sand 

bar/sand flat deposits (Facies Association D) records upward increasing tidal influence. As a 

result, features attributed to, or even diagnostic (e.g., tidal bundles) of tidal currents become 

progressively more abundant upward, as do the trace fossils Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha, 

Planolithes, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos, typical of coastal settings. The upward 

increase in tidal influence is also associated with a progressive increase in mud abundances, 

resulting in thinning- and fining- upward successions. Such facies arrangements are related to a 

rise in relative sea level during transgression. 

Inclined heterolithic stratification (HIS) in association with tidal channel deposits is 

expected in meanders of straight-meandering-straight channel segments, typically formed in 

central estuarine areas of tidal-dominated estuaries (e.g., Nichols and Biggs, 1985; Leckie and 

Singh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1992; Reading and Collison, 1996; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). The 

more frequent occurrence of tidal channel deposits in the PPSA quarry might suggest that, when 

transgression took place, this area was located closer to the central estuary. 

On the other hand, the higher abundance of Facies Association D in the RCC quarry 

suggests a location nearer to the coast, as elongate sand bars associated with upper-flow-regime 

sand flats are typical of the seaward areas in tide-dominated estuaries (Dalrymple et al., 1992). 

The common occurrence of wave-generated structures (i.e, symmetrical ripple marks and 

truncating, low-angle dipping cross lamination) in facies association D conforms to an outer 

estuarine location (Dalrymple et al. 1992).  

The soft kaolin deposits in the Rio Capim Kaolin area were formed during a period of rise 

relative sea level, with the RCC quarry recording an increased proximity to nearshore areas

relative to the PPSA quarry. The tide-dominated estuary formed along a broad WNW-ESE 

paleocoast, as proposed by the dominant NNE/SSW and NE/SW paleocurrent data obtained from 

the in-channel deposits. 

 

 

2.6 CONCLUSION 

 

The presence of sedimentary structures attributed to tidal processes coupled with trace 

fossil assemblages consisting of Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium, Skolithos 

and Ophiomorpha, suggest that the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation in the Rio Capim 

Kaolin area was formed dominantly under the influence of tidal processes. In addition to facies 

associations consisting of tidal-influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal flat/mangrove, and 

tidal sand bar/tidal sand flat, these characteristics support a tide-dominated estuarine 

interpretation. The distribution of facies associations, represented by tide-influenced fluvial 

channel deposits that grade upward into other facies associations denoting increased tidal energy, 

indicates that deposition took place during a transgression. The increased occurrence of tidal 

channel, tidal flat/mangrove deposits in the PPSA quarry, and of tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat in 

the RCC quarry reveals that the latter was located closer to the nearshore area. During the Late 

Cretaceous, the paleocoast was positioned circa 240 km landward of the present coast, as a result 

of relative sea-level rise. This depositional context must be taken into account when discussing 

the origin of the soft kaolin in the Rio Capim area.

3. ORIGIN OF THE RIO CAPIM KAOLIN WITH BASIS ON OPTICAL 

(PETROGRAPHIC AND SEM) DATA

and Dilce de Fátima ROSSETTI 

 
3.1 ABSTRACT 

 

 The Ipixuna Formation (Late Cretaceous-?Early Tertiary) exposed in the Rio Capim area, 

northern Brazil, was subdivided recently into three stratigraphic horizons, informally known as 

the lower soft kaolin unit, the intermediate kaolin unit, and the upper, endured, semi-flint kaolin 

unit. These units had their primary texture and composition strongly modified after deposition. 

Petrographic and scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) investigation revealed many remaining 

features that allow distinguishing the soft and the semi-flint kaolin deposits into two depositional 

sequences. The soft kaolin unit consists of well structured, sub-angular to sub-rounded, and 

locally angular, kaolinitized quartzose sandstones and kaolinitized sandstones that are 

interbedded with either laminated or massive pelites. These lithologies, composed by grains and 

lithic fragments related to felsic volcanic and meta-volcanic sources, as well as metamorphic and 

granitic rocks, had their texture and composition strongly modified, mostly likely during 

diagenesis, resulting deposits with an actual wacky nature. Kaolinitization produced three types 

of kaolinites, categorized according to size and texture, as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka 

kaolinite, typical of the sandstones, consists of hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 µm 

in diameter, and occurs as agglomerates of booklets or vermicular crystals that reach up to 400 

µm in length. Kb kaolinite, which dominates in the mudstones, consists chiefly of hexagonal and 

pseudohexagonal crystals averaging 1-3 µm in diameter that occur isolated, or as intergrowths of 

chaotic, face-to face or, less commonly, parallel to pseudo-parallel crystals. Kc kaolinite, which 

is abundant only in association with paleosols, displays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 

with regular sizes around 200 nm in diameter. The semi-flint is attributed to a distinctive 

depositional unit formed by sediments from variable sources, but with a significant contribution 

from the underlying soft kaolin. This is suggested by a high volume of sandstones displaying 

grains that are sub-rounded to rounded and consisting of homogeneous, dark brown masses of 

 45



 46

kaolinite that are strongly highlighted by films of iron oxides. As opposed to the soft kaolin unit, 

the semi-flint is dominated by endured Kc kaolinite, which mostly likely results from 

combination of weathering during transportation and pedogenesis acting in several phases of 

sediment subaerial exposure.

3.2 INTRODUCTION 

 

The Ipixuna Formation that occurs in the Cametá Sub-basin, northern Brazil, is a 

geological unit of great economic interest for bearing one of the largest kaolin deposits in the 

world, the Rio Capim Kaolin. This unit has been investigated by several workers, who have 

mostly emphasized its sedimentologic, stratigraphic and geochemical aspects (Góes 1981; Sousa 

2000; Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). One 

important issue still open for debate concerning to these deposits is to decipher the origin of the 

kaolinite in order to better develop exploitation methods. Previous studies have suggested that the 

Rio Capim Kaolin is a product of deep weathering related to progressive drop of ground water 

affecting a single stratigraphic unit (Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Kotschoubey et al. 1996; 1999; 

Costa and Moraes 1998; Sousa 2000). Despite these contributions, the origin of these kaolin 

deposits deserves to be further addressed considering newly available sedimentological and 

stratigraphic data (Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 

2003). According to these authors, the kaolin deposits do not conform to a single stratigraphic 

unit. An unconformity separates the Ipixuna Formation into a lower soft kaolin unit and an upper 

hard kaolin unit, the latter consisting of flint-like fire clay with no plasticity when grounds up, 

known as semi-flint. Therefore, the soft and the semi-flint kaolin units have been attributed to 

distinctive depositional sequences. Additionally, a thin package of highly deformed deposits 

attributed to syn-sedimentary seismic activity is locally found between these two sequences, 

which are bounded by discontinuity surfaces that laterally merge into the sequence boundary 

(Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003).  

 46



 47

Taking this geological framework into account, a detailed characterization of various 

types of kaolinite according to the stratigraphic horizons recognized within the Ipixuna 

Formation is required to provide new information that can serve to the purpose of further 

discussing the origin of the Rio Capim Kaolin. Two types of kaolinite have been characterized in 

this area. These consist of a finer-grained kaolinite with high structural disorder, and a coarser-

grained kaolinite with lower structural disorder, this occurring mostly as booklets (Kotschoubey 

et al. 1999). According to these authors, these types of kaolinite reflect lithological 

differences. Hence, the finer-grained kaolinites formed from replacement of clay mineral in 

muddy deposits, while the coarser-grained kaolinites resulted from replacement of feldspar grains 

in sandy deposits.  

This paper provides detailed petrographic and scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) 

descriptions of the kaolin units of the Rio Capim area (Fig. 1A) aiming to better understand the 

origin of the different types of kaolinites, as well as discuss their temporal relationships.  

  

 

3.3 GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 

 

 The Cametá Sub-basin is inserted in the eastern margin of the Marajó Graben System, 

which formed in association with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean during the Late Jurassic to 

Early Cretaceous (Azevedo 1991; Galvão 1991; Villegas 1994; Costa et al. 2001). This sub-basin 

is filled by Cretaceous and Cenozoic deposits (Fig. 1B) that are up to 10 km thick. Cretaceous 

deposits are represented by the Breves (Aptian-Cenomanian) and the Limoeiro (Late Cretaceous) 

formations, while the Cenozoic deposits include the Marajó (Paleocene-Eocene) and Tucunaré 

(Pleistocene) formations. The majority of these deposits, formed in depositional settings ranging 

from fluvial to shallow marine (Villegas 1994), occurs in sub-surface. However, exceptional 

exposures are found along kaolin quarries in the Rio Capim area, where Upper Cretaceous-? 

Lower Tertiary deposits (Jupiassú 1970) crop out, being known by the lithostratigraphic term of 

Ipixuna Formation. This formation is up to 40 m thick, and consists of a lower soft kaolin unit, an 

intermediate kaolin unit, and an upper semi-flint kaolin unit (Fig. 2A), which are bounded by 

discontinuity surfaces, some marked by paleosols (Fig. 2A and B). The intermediate kaolin unit 

occurs only locally, and reaches up to 3 m thick. These deposits pinch out laterally, resulting in 

 47



 48

direct superposition of the soft and the semi-flint kaolin units (Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003; 

Rossetti 2004).  

Despite the kaolinitized muddy nature, many workers have shown that the kaolin units in 

the Rio Capim area consist of lithologies varying from mudstones to conglomerates 

(Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Kotschoubey et al. 1996; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003, 2006; Rossetti 

and Santos Jr. 2003, 2006; Rossetti 2004). The soft kaolin unit is well stratified, mostly 

encompassing sandy and muddy sedimentary facies attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channel, 

tidal channel, tidal sand bar, sand flat and tidal flat/mangrove associated to a tidal estuarine 

system (Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003, 2006). The intermediate kaolin unit, composed of 

heterolithic deposits, as well as mudstones and sandstones, forms a horizon bounded by 

discontinuity surfaces containing a variety of soft sediment deformation (e.g., convolute fold, 

cuspide, ball-and-pillow fracture, fault) structures related to seismic activity (Rossetti and Santos 

Jr. 2003). The semi-flint kaolin unit, traditionally known as massive in nature, has been more 

recently regarded as the record of distributary channels and mouth bars associated to either a 

deltaic or wave-dominated estuarine setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). According to these 

authors, thin layers of quartzose sandstones present in these deposits are related to transgressive 

lags.

3.4 METHODS 

 

This work was based on the petrographic and SEM analysis of 63 samples of kaolinitized 

sandstone, siltstone and mudstone collected from the Ipixuna Formation exposed along two 

kaolin quarries in the eastern Cametá Sub-basin (Fig. 1A). Sampling aimed to properly record the 

three stratigraphic kaolin units, as well as their internal sedimentary facies. 

All samples were impregnated with epoxy cements before starting thin section 

preparation, given their soft, and sometimes, friable nature. After this procedure, the samples 

were cut and polished using a Logitech System. For the SEM analysis, both small fragments and 

powered samples were mounted on stubs using silver tape, in order to analyze texture and 

morphology of individual kaolinite crystals. After gold coating, the samples were analysed under 

a LEO 1450 VP electronic microscope from the Goeldi Museum, applying secondary electrons 

and backscattering. The study of SEM images was combined with EDS analysis in order to help 

identifying the various mineral species. 

 

 

3.5 DESCRIPTION OF THE KAOLIN UNITS 

 

Petrographic and SEM analyses revealed particular optical characteristics when the soft 

and the semi-flint kaolin units of the Ipixuna Formation were compared, with abrupt changes 

occurring at their boundaries. On the other hand, the intermediate unit could not be distinguished 

from the semi-flint kaolin and for this reason they will be described together herein. The 

following characterization of texture and mineralogy of the kaolin units takes into account only 

lithologies varying from sandstones to mudstones, and excludes conglomerates, also abundant in 

the upper two kaolin units. Given the high degree of kaolinitization, the lithologic classification 

provided below is far from representing a primary sediment composition. The most likely 

original sediment types are suggested in the discussions.  

 

3.5.1 Soft kaolin 
 

The soft kaolin unit is composed mainly by interbedded sandstone and pelite. The first, 

representing the main lithology, includes kaolinitized quartzose sandstones and kaolinitized 

 51



 52

sandstones. Kaolinitized quartzose sandstones (Fig. 3A-H) dominate in the lower portion of the 

soft kaolin unit. They vary from fine- to coarse-grained and are, in general, moderately to well 

sorted, with grains that are sub-angular to sub-rounded, and locally angular. Their framework 

composition (Fig. 3A) consists of quartz (about 40-60%), and secondarily muscovite, feldspar 

and lithics (&lt;5%). The remaining of the sandstones is composed by a kaolinitized “matrix”, as 

well as large, rounded kaolinitized clasts up to 2 cm in length. The quartz grains are dominantly 

monocrystalline, and have their boundaries displaying different degrees of replacement by 

kaolinite. Only relics of grains are found floating within the kaolinite masses where replacement 

was more significant. In addition to the monocrystalline quartz, there is a significant volume of 

limpid, either bipyramidal or cuneiform quartz grains with straight extinction, as well as 

numerous vacuoles and embayments filled by either kaolinite or kaolinitized mud (Fig. 3B,C). 

Muscovite grains (Fig. 3D) are often bent and show anomalous birefringence due to partial 

replacement by large kaolinite crystals. Feldspars (Fig. 3E,F) are altered and replaced by 

kaolinite. Where grains are better preserved, albite twinning was observed. The lithics (Fig. 3G) 

consist mostly of mudstones and, secondarily, a mixture of muscovite, feldspar and quartz. These 

grains, in general larger than the average framework grains, display either bipyramidal or 

cuneiform quartz crystals. These are orientated according to a main direction that matches to the 

maximum elongation axis of muscovite crystals, suggesting an incipient foliation. The interstitial 

space of the sandstones consists of a kaolinitized ‘matrix” often containing enlarged areas, as 

well as ghosts of grains that were entirely kaolinitized (Fig. 3H). Where this “matrix” is less 

common, the framework grains display punctual contacts. 

Upward in the sections, the sandstones become progressively less quartzose, given place 

to the kaolinitized sandstones. These sandstones are dominantly fine-grained, though medium and 

even coarse grain sizes are locally present. The contact between grains are punctual and, less 

commonly, concave-convex. The grains, moderately sorted and sub-angular to angular, consist 

mainly of either partly or entirely kaolinited grains (Fig. 4A, D). Quartz, feldspar, muscovite and 

lithic grains are locally present. Bipyramidal (Fig. 4E) or cuneiform quartz grains are limpid or, 

most commonly, occur as “ghosts” with only relicts of the original composition. The latter 

consists of numerous particles of a transparent mineral with low birefringence similar to quartz. 

The remaining parts of these grains are highly replaced by kaolinite. Partly or entirely 

kaolinitized grains display a bipyramidal shape similar to quartz grains (Fig. 4F). The first shows 

 52



 53

many relicts of the original mineral composition, which are alike those observed in the ghosts of 

quartz grains. A large volume of the kaolinitized grains, even those with bipyramidal shapes, 

displays numerous black inclusions (Fig. 4G) that are not present in the kaolinitized “matrix”. 

Lithic grains might display composition similar to the quarztoze sandstones described above or, 

more often, are composed by a dark kaolinitized massive material mixed with either limpid or 

partly kaolinitized bipyramidal quartz, feldspar and muscovite crystals (Fig. 4H).  

The pelites (Fig. 5A,B), which increase in volume upward in the sections, consist of 

kaolinitized siltstones and mudstones that might be laminated forming heterolithic deposits. 

Large, well-rounded areas up to 0.5 mm in diameter with same composition than the surrounding 

deposits are locally present. Siltstones from the lower portion of the sections might display a high 

volume of quartz grains that are mostly angular. They also display prismatic, bipyramidal 

kaolinitized grains (Fig. 5B). Pelites with brown kaolinites are particularly widespread in the 

uppermost portion of the soft kaolin, where many fractures filled either by iron or clear kaolinites 

(Fig. 5C). These fractured pelites grade into reworked deposits displaying rounded clasts of 

similar composition than the surrounding pelites (Fig. 5D).     

The above-described lithologies display three types of kaolinites, categorized according to 

size and texture as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite (Fig. 6A-C) consists of hexagonal to 

pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 µm in diameter that occur as agglomerates of booklets (Fig. 6A) 

or vermicular (Fig. 6B) shapes that reach up to 400 ?m in length. Either single or composite 

booklets are present, the latter being formed by a set of laterally coalescing single booklets. 

Euhedral, elongated prismatic kaolinite crystals 1-3 µm in length growth out from the booklet 

sheets (Fig. 6C). Many Ka kaolinites display anomalous birefringence and grade into muscovite 

grains. Kb kaolinite (Fig. 6D-G) consists of hexagonal and pseudohexagonal crystals averaging 

1-3 ?m in diameter (Fig. 6D) that occur isolated, as intergrowths of chaotic, face-to face (Fig. 

6E) or, less commonly, parallel to pseudo-parallel (Fig. 6F) crystals similar to the ones described 

by Pickering and Hurst (1989). This type of kaolinite occurs also arranged as booklets that are 5-

10 µm in length. Lozenge kaolinite crystals intergrow with this type of kaolinite, and crudely 

developed single rectangular booklets are common (Fig. 6G). Kb kaolinite is either distributed 

homogeneously in the thin sections, or form masses containing agglomerates of Ka kaolinites 

dispersed within them. In addition, part of this kaolinite occurs in association with bipyramidal 

crystal ghosts, as well as kaolinitized grains of the framework. Kc kaolinite (Fig. 6H) also 

 53



 54

displays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal forms, but the crystals have regular sizes around 200 nm 

in diameter.  

Amongst all the kaolinite types described above, the sandstones bear the largest volume 

of Ka kaolinites, with Kb kaolinites being subordinate, and Kc kaolinites absent or, less 

commonly, rare. Ka kaolinites often form aggregates of sand grain sizes. Part of this kaolinite is 

also dispersed in the kaolinitized “matrix” in association with Kb kaolinites. On the other hand, 

Kc kaolinites occur consistently dispersed over the other two types of kaolinites. The pelites are 

dominated by Kb kaolinites, with Ka kaolinites being either rare or absent. Kc kaolinites are more 

frequent in this lithology than in the sandstones. Its volume increases progressively upward, 

reaching a maximum in the fractured pelites with brown kaolinites that occur near the contact 

with the discontinuity surface at the top of the soft kaolin.

3.5.2 Intermediate and semi-flint kaolin units 
 

In addition to conglomerates, these units are dominated by sandstones, mudstones and 

heterolithic deposits. As previously-mentioned, the latter, restricted to the intermediate unit, 

forms either slightly undulating or highly folded deposits. Kaolinitized, well rounded, moderately 

sorted, fine-grained to silty sandstones alternate with massive mudstones, defining laminations. 

The intermediate unit is, in general, soft. It becomes harder only in its upper portion where 

paleosols are present, but even so, it is softer than the semi-flint kaolin. Its base displays Kb, and 

more rarely Ka, kaolinites, both pervasively draped by Kc kaolinites (Fig. 7A). The volume of the 

latter increases substantially upward (Fig. 7B).  

The intermediate kaolin is sharply overlain by massive, endured mudstones and 

sandstones of the semi-flint kaolin unit. The mudstones (Fig. 7C) are homogeneous and consist of 

yellowish-brown Kc kaolinite and, secondarily, Kb kaolinites, with the first increasing in volume 

upward. The mudstones from the top of the semi-flint unit might be entirely composed by Kc 

kaolinites. They also show numerous irregular fractures and fenestrae of variable sizes (Fig. 7C) 

that are filled by clear kaolinites.  

Two types of sandstones occur in the intermediate and semi-flint units: quartz-sandstone 

and kaolinitized sandstone. Quartz-sandstones, which occur only in association with layers 

attributed to transgressive lags (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006), are very friable, contrasting with 

the overall surrounding endured, kaolinitized deposits. These sandstones are moderately to well 

sorted, well rounded, and vary from fine to medium grain sizes. Kaolinitized sandstones are 

mostly moderately- to poorly-sorted, with very fine to medium grains sizes that are, in general, 

sub-rounded to rounded (Fig. 7D). The grains, which display punctual and, very rarely, concave-

convex contacts, consist of a homogeneous mass of dark brown kaolinite composed dominantly 

by Kc kaolinites (Fig. 7E), with only relicts of Kb kaolinites. Their boundaries are strongly 

highlighted by coatings of iron oxide, present even between grains. The interstitial space was 

completely filled by cement of clear kaolinite. Samples displaying this characteristic revealed to 

contain well-developed booklets of kaolinites (i.e., Ka kolinite), as well as iron oxides and 

halloysite. The iron oxides form spheres or regular size (Fig. 7F), while the halloysite forms an 

interlaced network of either tabular (Fig. 7G) or elongated, hairy (Fig. 7H) crystals. Nevertheless, 

the SEM microscopic analysis also revealed that a great part of the interstitial space consists of 

 59



 60

Kc kaolinites. Eventually, the framework grains might be fractured and filled by the clear 

kaolinite.

3.6 DISCUSSION 

 

 Taking into account the high degree of kaolinitization of the studied deposits, 

reconstructing their primary nature, as well as determining the several phases of kaolinite 

formation, are issues hard to be approached. Previous studies have proposed granitic and 

metamorphic sources throughout the kaolin deposits of the Ipixuna Formation (Nascimento and 

Góes 2005). Truckenbrodt et al. (1991) and Kotschoubey et al. (1996, 1999) have proposed that 

the kaolinite derives from replacement of feldspar grains and muddy matrix in arkosic deposits 

during progressive deep weathering.  

In general, determining sandstone provenance is one of the most problematic issues in 

sedimentary geology. This is because one must consider the influence of various factors (e.g., 

type of rock, relief, climate, tectonics, flow dynamics, depositional environment) acting in the 

source area, as well as during sediment transportation, deposition and evolution after burial (Folk 

1974; Basu 1975; Young 1975) in order to discuss sediment sources.  In addition to all these 

factors, the present location of the studied deposits in a tropical area further contributed to modify 

their primary characteristics due to weathering. Despite this high complexity, the detailed optical 

(i.e., petrographic and SEM) information presented herein, when analysed within a faciological 

and stratigraphic framework, contributes to further discuss the origin of the kaolinites in the Rio 

Capim area.  

 

 62



 63

3.6.1 Composition and genesis of the soft kaolin unit 
  

The great thickness and the well stratified nature of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna 

Formation have been used to propose an origin related to in situ alteration of feldspar grains from 

arkosic deposits, as well as clay minerals from mudstones due to deep weathering (Kotschoubey 

et al. 1996; 1999). Determining whether deep weathering or diagenesis was responsible for 

kaolinitization is an issue opened for debate. Optical observations concerning to the three 

categories of kaolinites described herein confirm an origin related to kaolinitization of various 

types of material. The enhancement of Kc kaolinite towards the top unconformity is taken as a 

good evidence of a genesis related to weathering and, possibly, soil formation. The presence of 

many fractures filled by clear kaolinite is possibly related to the action of roots.  

On the other hand, the majority of the Kc kaolinite seems to have been formed by 

replacement of Ka and Kb kaolinites, as suggested by: 1. its occurrence consistently over Ka and 

Kb kaolinites; and 2. the inverse proportion in the volume of Kc kaolinites with respect to the 

other kaolinites.  

The increased abundance of Ka and Kb kaolinites in mudstones and sandstones, 

respectively, is a good indication that the first resulted from replacement of sand grains, while the 

second is chiefly related to replacement of detrital clay minerals. These mineral transformations 

predate the formation of Kc kaolinites, suggesting that Ka and Kb kaolinites had an origin 

unrelated to weathering associated to the top unconformity, being most likely formed by contact 

with intrastratal fluids during a previous burial.  

The quartzose sandstones display regular quartz grains derived either from granitic or 

metamorphic rocks, or even both. The upward gradation from quartzose to kaolinitized 

sandstones attests to a change in sand composition. The almost complete disappearance of regular 

quartz grains upward in the soft kaolin unit is taken as further evidence to support diversified 

sediment source. The presence of monazite and topaz points to igneous contribution (Nascimento 

and Góes 2005). However, if only a granitic source would be considered, the volume of quartz 

grains should have remained constant even if the grain size decreased (Tortosa et al. 1991). 

Despite the overall increase in the abundance of finer-grained sandstones upward in the soft 

kaolin unit, the fact that many intervals with kaolinitized sandstones are of same grain size as the 

quartzose sandstones led to suspect of a possible change in sediment source. The presence of 

heavy minerals such as kyanite and staurolite confirms a metamorphic contribution for these 

 63



 64

sediments (Nascimento and Góes 2005). The domain of monocrystalline, instead of 

polycrystalline, quartz grains are more typical of high degree of metamorphism (Yong 1975). On 

the other hand, the abundance of bipyramidal quartz grains with straight extinction, embayments 

and vacuoles attests the presence of sediments derived from felsic volcanic rocks (e.g., Folk 

1974; Scholle 1979). Lithic fragments containing bipyramidal quartz crystals parallel to 

muscovites suggest either an incipient foliation or primary bedding, leading to invoke a 

contribution from either fine-grained volcaniclastics or volcanic rocks with a certain degree of 

metamorphism.  

The prevalence of bipyramidal quartz, either as grains or crystals within lithic grains, 

conforms to a great influence of felsic volcanic fragments. The kaolinitized grains displaying 

bipyramidal or cuneiform shapes similar to quartz, but which have been replaced either entirely 

or partly by kaolinite, might record grains belonging to the silica group, but of a different species 

more suitable for replacement. Ghosts of grains with bipyramidal shape led to suspect on the 

presence of cristobalite. As quartz, cristobalite is a mineral formed by sheets of tetrahedra 

pointing alternately up and down, resulting in a bipyramidal shape. In addition, this mineral is 

usually found in association with volcanic rocks (e.g., Nesse 1991), thus being consistent with the 

proposed interpretation. Unfortunately, because only relicts of this mineral are preserved, its 

optical characterization was not enough to draw any further conclusions. The numerous black 

inclusions associated to these grains are taken as residues left behind during dissolution, followed 

by replacement by kaolinite, an interpretation consistent with the fact that this type of material is 

absent in the kaolinitized matrix.  

If the foregoing interpretation is correct, then a great portion of the kaolinitized 

sandstones is formed by lithic grains of volcanic sources. In fact, it is possible that much of the 

bipyramidal quartz and cristobalite (?) of the sandstone framework are, in fact, crystals from 

lithic grains that were left behind during kaolinitization. This is suggested with basis on the 

presence of many areas of the kaolinitized “matrix” with ghosts of grains with floating crystals 

within. Thus, part of the “matrix” is in fact a pseudomatrix formed by replacement of the 

framework grains by kaolinite. Kaolinitization of the framework grains was pervasive, affecting 

not only lithic grains, but also feldspar, muscovite and, less intensely, granitic and metamorphic 

quartz.

 65

Kaolinitization of framework grains produced large kaolinite crystals as agglomerates of 

booklets, which form part of the Ka kaolinite. The crudely developed, large, rectangular booklets 

probably record kaolinitized feldspar grains. This is suggested because this shape is similar to 

many feldspar grains that are still preserved in the framework. Large kaolinite booklets resulted 

also from replacement of muscovite, which is indicated by the fact that many large booklets with 

anomalous birefringence grade into muscovites. The presence of large kaolinite crystals 

associated with both feldspar and muscovite grains are probably due to the larger volume of Al, 

as well as Si and O, available from alteration of these minerals. Lozenge kaolinite crystals 

intergrown with Ka booklets suggest a phase of kaolinite precipitation postdating the formation 

of booklets. 

Despite the fact that most of the Kb kaolinite resulted from kaolinitization of clay 

minerals from mudstones, as previously stated, this work shows that part of it was also derived 

from alteration of framework grains. This is revealed by the occurrence of this type of kaolinite in 

association with ghosts of quartz and cristobalite (?) grains and crystals from lithic fragments. In 

summary, although the largest volume of Kb kaolinite resulted from replacement of mudstone 

layers, a considerable amount of this kaolinite resulted from replacement of framework grains. In 

this case, dissolution of SiO2 provided elements that combined with Al from circulating fluids in 

order to form Kc kaolinites. 

 

 

3.6.2 Composition and genesis of the semi flint kaolin unit 
 

Hard, semi-flint kaolin deposits resembling the ones from the Rio Capim area have been 

described in association with many other kaolin deposits worldwide. The origin of these endured 

kaolin overlying soft kaolin deposits has been a matter of great debate (e.g., Bates 1964; Hurst 

and Bosio 1975; Murray and Partridge 1982; Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Murray and Keller 1993; 

Yuan and Murray 1993; Chen et al. 1997; Kotschoubey et al. 1999; Montes et al. 2002). These 

authors have often related the hard kaolin deposits to kaolinites with high degree of structural 

disorder. The action of inorganic acids and microbes in soils and weathering crusts is known to 

cause the destruction of clays, with the consequent decrease of structural disorder (Hurst and 

Pickering Jr. 1997; Hradil and Hostomsky 2002). Other workers have attributed the origin of the 

 65



 66

semi-flint kaolin to clay flocculation in the presence of alkaline seawater (Kesller 1956; Schofield 

and Sampson 1954; Pickering and Hurst 1989; Dombrowski 1993). 

The genesis of the semi-flint kaolin in the Rio Capim area has been interpreted to be 

closely related to the underlying soft kaolin, with the hard kaolin recording the uppermost portion 

of progressive downward weathering (e.g., Sousa 2000). The origin of the semi flint kaolin has 

been also related to in situ precipitation of amorphous kaolinite by descending solutions under 

influence of organic acids, combined with the action of bacterias (Kotschoubey et al. 1996). In 

the following, optical data are integrated with sedimentological and stratigraphic information 

recently available in the literature in order to propose that the semi-flint and the soft kaolin units 

had different depositional and evolutionary histories. In addition, it is stated that the Kc kaolinite, 

rather than representing in situ precipitation, resulted from multiple origins. 

It is proposed herein that a significant volume of the Kc kaolinite in the semi flint kaolin 

unit was produced by pedogenesis. Likewise the soft kaolin unit, this is suggested by an overall 

increase in the volume of Kc kaolinite relative to Ka and Kb kaolinites upward in the semi flint 

kaolin. As our unpublished work focusing on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes demonstrates that 

the Kc kaolinite has values that contrast with modern soil waters, it is proposed that this type of 

kaolinite was most likely formed under influence of the paleosol developed in association with 

the unconformity at the top of the Ipixuna Formation (Rossetti 2004). 

Despite the pedogenetic influence, it is possible that the Kc kaolinite from the semi flint 

kaolin unit had a more diversified origin. An important information to recall from previous work 

is the presence of an unconformity between the soft and the semi flint kaolin units, implying in 

distinctive depositional sequences, as previously mentioned (Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and 

Santos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). An ongoing study focusing on heavy minerals 

comparing these units attests to mineralogical assemblages having different textural 

characteristics. Hence, there is an abrupt increase in grain roundness when crossing the basal 

unconformity, which led to suspect that part of the semi-flint kaolin might have been formed by 

reworking of the underlying soft kaolin. 

A large volume of kaolinitized, mud-supported breccias and conglomerates has been 

reported in these deposits, which is consistent with intense sediment reworking (e.g., 

Kotschoubey et al. 1996; Santos and Rossetti 2003; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). In addition, 

according to the latter authors, an important part of the semi-flint kaolin encompasses deposits 

 66



 67

representative of mouth bar deposits, requesting a primary sandy composition. This study 

revealed that even the muddier hard kaolin is, at least in great part, composed by sand grain sizes, 

and not muds as originally thought. The well to moderate grain roundness, as well as the iron-

oxide coatings predating mechanical compaction, as suggested by their presence even where 

grains are in contact, conform to deposition of this kaolin as sands. It is suspected that the sands 

might have been produced by reworking of the underlying soft kaolin unit. Together with the 

heavy mineral assemblage, this is suggested because, as opposed to the underlying kaolinitized 

sandstones from the soft kaolin unit, these sandstones are formed by grains consisting exclusively 

of completely homogeneous masses of dark brown Kc kaolinites. 

As the uppermost part of the soft kaolin was exposed to weathering during development 

of a sequence boundary between the soft and the semi flint kaolin units (Rossetti, 2004), the 

formation of Kc kaolinites, represented by interlocking of crystals&amp;lt;200 nm in diameter, was 

favored. Reworking of this material in a new depositional setting (in this instance, deltaic mouth 

bars) might have resulted in sandstones composed by rounded grains of kaolin already displaying 

a certain degree of hardness promoted by the prevalence of Kc kaolinites.  

The presence of distinctive clear Kc kaolinite filling up the interstitial spaces of the 

sandstones, as well as the fractures, indicates that the semi flint kaolin was further endured due to 

cementation. The fact that the SEM analysis revealed halloysite and Ka kaolinites in samples 

displaying clear kaolinite led to argue that this cement is actually represented by a mixture of 

these minerals. In particular, it has been claimed that the presence of halloysite might contribute 

to increase significantly the hardness of kaolin deposits due to the intricate crystals intergrowth 

(e.g., Grant 1963; Bates 1964; Osborne et al. 1994). In this instance, the volume of halloysite is 

probably low, but they occur only in the semi-flint kaolin. The occurrence of this mineral as 

cement in kaolin deposits is usually related to pedogenesis (e.g., Keller 1977, 1982). Halloysite 

precipitating together with Ka and Kc kaolinites in the interstitial porosity probably have 

contributed to endure the semi-flint kaolin unit. 

In addition of a derivation from the underlying soft kaolin unit, the sediments that gave 

rise to the semi-flint had a contribution directly from metamorphic rocks. This is suggested also 

by an ongoing study that reveals the presence of euhedral staurolite and kyanite, as well as the 

occurrence of hornblende, with no evidence of dissolution, characteristics not present in the 

underlying soft kaolin unit. Furthermore, a sedimentary source is proposed for the quartz 

 67



 68

sandstones, which were related to intense reworking associated with marine flooding surfaces 

(Rossetti &amp;amp; Santos Jr. 2006).    

 

 

3.7 FINAL REMARKS 

 

The present optical study allows is consistent with the attribution of the soft and the semi-

flint kaolin units to distinctive depositional sequences. In addition to the unconformity mapped 

between these sequences, the recognition of different sediment sources is consistent with such an 

interpretation. Furthermore, the kaolinite from these deposits had distinctive origins, as great part 

of the soft kaolin represents kaolinitization of framework grains of sandstones and replacement of 

other clay minerals from mudstones. Kaolinitization was intense enough to modify most of the 

primary composition. However, detailed optical studies revealed many relicts of the original 

texture, suggesting that the kaolinitized sandstones were formed by lithic grains of felsic 

volcanic, as well as volcaniclastics or meta-volcanic rocks. Diagenesis of these sandstones 

promoted significant compositional changes, with strong kaolinitization of the framework grains. 

Lithic grains, as well as grains having a probable cristobalite composition, were more suitable for 

replacement than quartz grains. The kaolinitization process contributed to produce a deposit with 

a large volume of pseudomatrix, which gave them the actual wacky composition. The abundance 

of relicts and ghosts of grains, as well as enlarged areas between grains that appear to float in the 

matrix, however, led to the conclusion that these are artificial wackes produced during 

kaolinitization.  

The upward almost disappearance of regular quartz grains in the soft kaolin unit is 

explained by a change in both sedimentary conditions and sediment sources. This situation might 

have been favored by the estuarine nature of the depositional setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 

2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). Hence, the quartzose sandstones from the base of the 

sections might record higher energy flows associated to the initial transgression of the estuarine 

system. During this process, unstable grains have higher potential to be lost due to the strong 

reworking by tidal currents and waves, which favors deposition of sands rich in quartz grains at 

the estuary axis. As the estuary is filled with sediment, there is a greater interaction of marine and 

fluvial flows, with the latter dominating in inner estuarine areas. The deposits located in the 

 68



 69

middle and upper portions of the studied sections formed in a variety of tidal depositional settings 

typical of inner and middle estuarine areas. The sediment in these settings derived mainly from 

fluvial inflows, resulting in sandstones with composition of the framework grains that varied with 

relation to the quartzose sandstones. Diagenesis of these deposits led to an intense kaolinitization, 

but with preservation of primary structures. Burial promoted the replacement of sandstones and 

mudstones by Ka and Kb kaolinites. Kc kaolinites formed later on by replacement of Ka and Kb 

kaolinites in association with pedogenesis related to the development of the unconformity that 

bounds the top of the soft kaolin unit.  

The semi flint kaolin, on the other hand, resulted from sediments reworked from the 

underlying soft kaolin deposits, which were mixed with an additional nearby metamorphic 

source. This would have brought Kc kaolinites from the upper, slightly endured portion of the 

soft kaolin. The reworked sediment would have been reduced to sand grain sizes, adopting a dirt 

appearance during transportation, and becoming coated by iron oxide. Weathering acting during 

transportation contributed to further endure the kaolin grains. Following deposition, additional Kc 

kaolinite was formed throughout the semi flint kaolin due to pedogenetic processes associated to 

the unconformity that marks the top of the Ipixuna Formation. Further Kc kaolinite was 

introduced by cementation of sandstones and filling of fractures.  

Despite the sharp boundaries and the softer nature, the intermediate unit displays 

sedimentological features with more affinity to the semi-flint kaolin than to the soft kaolin unit. 

The intermediate and the semi-flint kaolin units also have comparable heavy mineral 

characteristics, as well as prevalence of Kc kaolinites. The data presented herein, however, was 

not enough to decide if the intermediate kaolin is the remaining of a distinctive depositional unit 

or part of the semi-flint kaolin unit, as previously pointed out (Rossetti, 2004).

REVEALED BY ?18O AND ?D ISOTOPE ANALYSIS

4.1 ABSTRACT 

 

Deuterium (?D) and oxygen (?18O) isotope data from the Rio Capim kaolin, northern 

Brazil, were combined with optical studies in order to better understand the genesis and evolution 

of the kaolinites. The results show that ?18O isotope values from a lower soft kaolin unit range 

from 6.04‰ to 19.18‰ for Ka (size ranging from 1 to 3 µm) and Kb (size ranging from 10 to 30 

µm) kaolinites, and from 15.38‰ to 24.86‰ for Kc (size&amp;lt;200 nm) kaolinites. The ?D values 

range from –63.06‰ to 79.46‰ for the Ka+Kb kaolinites, and from –68.85‰ to –244.35‰ for 

the Kc kaolinites. An upper semi flint kaolin unit, dominated by Kc kaolinites, displays ?18O and 

?D isotope values ranging from 15.08‰ to 21.77‰, and -71.31‰ to -87.37‰, respectively. 

Based on these data, and on the ?18O and ?D values obtained for the surface meteoric water and 

groundwater, it can be concluded that the kaolinites are not in equilibrium with the modern 

weathering environment, but they reflect isotopic compositions of the formation time, probably 

due to the interaction with groundwaters. However, mineralogical contaminations derived from 

replacements of framework grains also had great influence in the isotopic composition of these 

kaolinites. In addition, the isotope values of the Kc kaolinites from the semi-flint kaolin unit is 

variable, which is due to the presence of Kc kaolinites of different origins, including kaolinites 

derived from the underlying soft kaolin unit, kaolinites formed during different phases of 

paleoweathering, as well as later phases of coarse-grained kaolinites formed along fractures. Due 

to these complexities, binary diagrams contrasting ?18O and ?D isotope values, worldwide 

applied for distinguishing supergenic from hypogenic kaolinites, as well as those formed under 

weathering conditions, can not be applied to interpret the origin of the kaolinites in the Rio 

Capim Kaolin.

4.2 INTRODUCTION 

 

Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes have been increasingly applied to approach the 

environmental conditions prevailing during formation of clay minerals (Savin and Epstein, 

1970a,b; Lawrence and Taylor, 1971,1972; Savin and Lee, 1988; Zhou and Dobos, 1994; Mizota 

and Longstaffe, 1996; Savin and Hsieh, 1997; Stern et al., 1997; Gilg, 2000; Vitali et al., 2002; 

Gilg et al., 2003; Tabor and Montanez, 2005). In pedogenic minerals from weathered deposits, 

these isotopes are in equilibrium with meteoric waters (Savin and Epstein, 1970a; Lawrence and 

Taylor, 1971,1972; Mizota and Longstaffe, 1996; Savin and Hsieh, 1997; Girard et al., 2000), 

while their interaction with pore-waters and circulating hydrothermal waters takes place in burial 

and hydrothermal environments, respectively (Sheppard et al., 1969; Marumo et al., 1980; Sun 

and Eadington, 1987; Cruz and Reyes, 1998; Boulvais et al., 2000). ?D and ?18O from kaolinites 

in weathering profiles allow establishing a straight linear equation, traditionally known as the 

kaolinite line, as well as estimating the isotope fractionation factor (?) (Savin and Epstein, 

1970a). Likewise, a supergene/hypogene line (S/H) has been used to separate clay minerals 

formed under earth surface and high burial temperatures, respectively (Sherppard et al., 1969). In 

addition to kaolinite (Savin and Epstein, 1970a, Liu and Epstein, 1984; Savin and Lee, 1988; 

Zhou and Dobos, 1994; Gilg and Sheppard, 1996; Cruz and Reyes, 1998; Boulvais et al., 2000; 

Gilg, 2000; Girard et al., 2000; Gilg et al., 2003), montmorillonite, glauconite, illite and many 

other minerals have been applied in these investigations (Savin and Epstein, 1970a; James and 

Baker, 1976; Savin and Lee, 1988). Furthermore, the isotope composition of surface and near-

surface modern waters (Bowen and Wilkinson, 2002; Fricke and O’Neil, 1999; Bowen and 

Revenaugh, 2003) relative to SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water) has been used to define the 

Meteoric Water Line (Freidman, 1953; Craig, 1961; Epstein et al., 1965). All these concepts have 

been applied to discuss the environmental conditions during the deposition and post-deposition 

time of clayey deposits, particularly regarding to paleotemperature (Savin and Lee, 1988; Yapp, 

1986; Gilg and Sheppard, 1996). 

Although experiments with stable isotopes support a relationship between ?D and ?18O 

obtained from clay minerals and paleotemperature, this approach is not so straightforward, as 

other factors must be taking into account, including latitude, altitude, and distance from the 

coastline (Savin, 1977; Savin and Hsieh, 1998). Due to these complexities, further studies 

 77



 78

emphasizing ?D and ?18O isotopes must be undertaken to provide a full comprehension of the 

behavior of these values along ancient clayey deposits, particularly considering a larger volume 

of analogs that can be used as a basis for comparisons.  

The Ipixuna Formation exposed in the Rio Capim area, northern Brazil, is well known for 

its kaolin reserves, one of the largest in the world. Due to the economic interest, this unit has been 

increasingly under investigation, with many publications presented in the last years concerning to 

aspects including the depositional environment, provenance, petrography and geochemistry 

(Góes, 1981; Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999; Costa and Moraes, 1998; 

Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003, 2006; Rossetti, 2004; Sousa, 2000; Santos Jr., 2002; Santos Jr. and 

Rossetti, 2003, 2006; Nascimento and Goes, 2005). As a result of these studies, the Ipixuna 

Formation has been subdivided into two stratigraphic units, consisting of a lower soft kaolin unit, 

and an upper semi flint kaolin unit, bounded by discontinuity surfaces associated with lateritic 

paleosols. Despite the presence of these weathering surfaces, optical studies have indicated 

different types of kaolinite in the Ipixuna Formation, with a large volume appearing to be 

unrelated to surface processes. The occurrence of these weathering surfaces, combined with the 

fact that kaolinite is the major constituent in the Ipixuna Formation, favors the application of ?D 

and ?18O isotope in order to distinguish the various kaolinite generations present in these 

deposits. In addition to help better understand the genesis and evolution of the kaolinites from the 

Rio Capim area, this study attempts to contribute testing the applicability of these methods for 

reconstructing the environmental conditions involved in the kaolinite formation. 

 

 

4.3 GEOLOGY 

 

The Ipixuna Formation encompasses Upper Cretaceous-?Lower Tertiary kaolinitized 

sandstones and mudstones that are well exposed in the eastern Cametá Sub-Basin, where the Rio 

Capim Kaolin focused herein is located. The genesis of this basin, situated in the Marajó Graben 

System, is linked to the strike-slip deformation that took place along the Equatorial Brazilian 

Margin during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean (Azevedo, 1991; Galvão, 1991; Villegas, 

1994; Costa et al., 2001). The Cametá Sub-Basin displays mostly fluvial to shallow marine 

deposits recorded by a sedimentary pile up to 10 km thick comprising the Breves (Aptian-

 78



 79

Cenomanian), Limoeiro (Late Cretaceous), Marajó (Paleocene-Eocene) and Tucunaré 

(Pleistocene) formations (Fig. 1). 

The Ipixuna Formation exposed in the Rio Capim area reaches up to 40 m thick. The 

lower soft kaolin unit records an overall fining- and thinning-upward succession up to 20 m thick, 

characterized from bottom to top by tidally influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal 

flat/mangrove, and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat, attributed to an estuarine system (Santos Jr., 

2002; Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2006). Tidally influenced fluvial and tidal channels are defined by 

sharply based, locally concave up, fining- and thinning-upward successions formed by tabular to 

trough cross-stratified or laminated sandstones, as well as intraformational conglomerates and 

heterolithic mudstones/sandstones. Tidal channel deposits are distinguished from tidally 

influenced fluvial channels based on the abundance of both reactivation surfaces and mud drapes 

along cross sets, and trace fossils  including Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium 

and Skolithos. Tidal flat/mangrove records the finest deposits of the soft kaolin unit, consisting of 

tabular packages of highly bioturbated (mostly Skolithos and Ophiomorpha), heterolithic-bedded 

sandstones and mudstones. Tidal sand bars and tidal sandy flats, which contain Thalassinoides, 

Ophiomorpha, Skolithos, and Planolites, form laterally continuous, either lenticular or tabular 

packages bounded at the base by either planar or only slightly undulating (though not erosive) 

surfaces, which internally display horizontally stratified sandstones with abundant parting 

lineation that are interbeded with heterolithic deposits. As a result of these facies characterization, 

the traditional attribution to a fluvial-lacustrine depositional setting to the soft kaolin unit (Góes, 

1981) has been reconsidered in favor of an estuarine system (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003, 2006; 

Rossetti, 2004; Santos Jr., 2002; Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003, 2006). 

The upper semi-flint kaolin unit is either massive or incipiently structured, comprising 

sandstone, mudstone, intraformational conglomerate and heterolithic deposits attributed, at least 

in part, to distributary channel and mouth bar depositional environments associated to either a 

deltaic or wave-dominated estuarine setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). The distributary 

channels are characterized by concave up kaolinitized sandstones and mudstones displaying a 

basal lag of quartz sandstones. These deposits intergrade with strata displaying a series of 

inclined lines, defining lobed bodies that are locally highlighted by distinctively soft, massive 

mud layers.

Our ongoing studies reveal that the soft kaolin unit described above displays three types 

of kaolinite, categorized according to size and texture, as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite, 

typical of the sandstones, consists of hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 µm in 

diameter, and occurs as agglomerates of booklets or vermicular crystals that reach up to 400 µm 

in length. Kb kaolinite, which dominates in the mudstones, consists chiefly of hexagonal and 

pseudohexagonal crystals averaging 1-3 µm in diameter. Both kaolinites might entirely or partly 

replace grains of the framework, including quartz, feldspar, muscovite, as well as igneous (mostly 

volcanic) and metamorphic lithics. Kc kaolinite displays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 

with regular sizes around 200 nm in diameter (Fig. 2).  

The soft kaolin consists mostly of Ka and Kb kaolinites, with the first dominating in the 

sandstones and the latter in the mudstones. In addition, Kc kaolinite occurs subordinately, always 

mantling the other kaolinite types, which suggests its formation, at least in part, from the coarser-

grained kaolinites. Kc kaolinite increases significantly in abundance upward in the soft kaolin 

unit, where it is associated with a paleosol horizon linked to the unconformity that separates the 

soft and the semi-flint kaolin units. As opposed to the soft kaolin unit, the semi-flint is dominated 

by endured Kc kaolinite, though the other types of kaolinite might also occur at the base of the 

unit, as well as associated with fractures abundant in its top.

4.4 METHODS 

 

The ?18O and ?D values were measured in 113 samples using the procedures described by 

Clayton and Mayeda (1963) and Coleman et al. (1982), respectively. The samples were obtained 

from representative profiles along two quarries (i.e., IRCC and PPSA) of the Rio Capim area, 

located circa 60 km apart, and aimed to record different lithofacies, including kaolinitized 

sandstones, pelites and conglomerates from the two kaolin units described above.  

Preliminarily, three parcels were obtained from selected samples in order to record the 

three types of kaolinites (i.e., Ka, Kb, and Kc) observed by optical studies. Each kaolin sample 

was first dispersed in a solution containing distilled water and sodium hexametaphosphate. The 

samples were then carefully disaggregated ultrasonically for 10 seconds and, subsequently, 

sieved to separate the fractions &gt;64 µm, from which kaolinite booklets (Ka kaolinite) were hand 

picked under a binocular. The grain sizes&amp;lt;64 µm were separated through settling according to 

Stokes’ Law to obtain the fractions&amp;lt;200 nm, 1 to 3 µm, and 10 to 30 µm, recording the Kc, Kb 

and Ka kaolinites. The latter was added to the booklets hand picked from the&amp;lt;64 µm. Each 

fraction was purified using distilled water at least three times and concentrated by centrifugation. 

They were then heated at 100°C in a vacuum chamber oven for 24 hours in order to remove 

adsorbed water between octahedric and tetrahedrical sheets.  

For ?18O isotope extraction, 5 mg of each parcel were put in a copper tube and heated at 

100°C under high vacuum for 1 hour. Following this procedure, bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) 

was introduced to release the oxygen that was reacted with a graphite disk in an intensive light to 

produce CO2. The CO2 was trapped in a glass tube using liquid N2. To obtain the ?18O data, the 

samples were analyzed on a Finingan-MAT DELTA mass spectrometer. For ?D isotope analysis, 

1 mg of kaolinite from each parcel was inserted in a vacuum system containing He and extracted 

on-line directly from Thermo-Finnigan TCEA (thermal conversion elemental analyzer), operated 

at 1,440°C. Kaolinite (KGA), and serpentine plus kaolinite (KGA) standards were routinely 

measured together with the kaolinite samples to verify the accuracy of the ?18O and ?D data. ?18O 

and ?D values are reported in parts permil (‰) relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). 

All ?18O and ?D data were analyzed from Geological Laboratory of the Indiana University, EUA. 

 83



 84

The preliminary tests revealed that the Ka e Kb kaolinites displayed similar ?18O and ?D 

isotope values (Tab. 1), and for this reason the fractions &gt;1µm were systematically analyzed as 

one single parcel to include the Ka and Kb kaolinites. 

?18O and ?D data were also obtained from rainfall and groundwater samples collected 

during the raining season on May 2005. Four samples were collected, two from meteoric water at 

the surface and two from groundwater at depths of 60 m (IRCC quarry) and 150 m (PPSA 

quarry). The isotope values were measured using a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP isotope ratio 

mass spectrometer. For the hydrogen extraction, a HDevice inlet was applied to reduce 0.7 uL of 

water on hot chromium at 850°C for 60 seconds. For the oxygen extraction, a Gas Bench was 

used at 34°C for 12 hours aiming CO -H O equilibration. For both isotopes, the samples were 

compared to two internal laboratory standards (Boulder Water and Miami Water) with distinct 

isotopic compositions in order to calibrate the machine slope. The two internal laboratory 

standards were calibrated using international standards (VSMOW).

4.4.1 ?18O and ?D isotope data 
 

The ?18O and ?D values obtained for the soft and semi-flint kaolin units, as well as for the 

local surface meteoric and groundwater, are illustrated in Table 1 and plotted in Figures 4.3 to 

4.5.   

In general, ?18O and ?D values obtained for the soft kaolin samples from both quarries display 

similar patterns of variation. Hence, the Ka+Kb kaolinites have ?18O values ranging from 6.04‰ 

to 18.83‰, with an average of 14.83‰, and from 12.79‰ to 19.18‰, with an average of 

16.47‰, in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. For the Kc kaolinites, these values range 

from 15.38‰ to 24.86‰, with an average of 19.67‰, and 16.42‰ to 23.32‰, with an average 

of 19.29‰ for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. The ?D values for the Ka+Kb 

kaolinites of the PPSA quarry range from –63.99‰ to -73.87‰, with an average of –68.35‰, 

disregarding sample E14. These kaolinites in the IRCC quarry revealed values ranging from –

63.06‰ to –79.46‰, with an average of –70.10‰, disregarding sample E-126, which shows an 

anomalous value of –42.56‰. For the Kc kaolinite, the ?D values vary from –74.42‰ to –

221.64‰, with an average of –100.02‰, and from –68.85‰ to –244.35‰, with an average of –

114.21‰ for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. Despite these overall variable results, it is 

 84



 85

noteworthy that the Kc kaolinite from samples located at the paleosol horizon in the PPSA quarry 

(see E18-E21) displays ?D isotope values that are very uniform, between –76.13‰ and –79.42‰. 

It is noteworthy that the ?18O curve of the Kc kaolinite in the soft kaolin unit shows the same 

pattern of variation when compared to the values obtained in stratigraphic equivalent Ka+Kb 

kaolinites. 

The Kc kaolinite from the semi-flint kaolin unit displays ?18O and ?D isotope values that 

are comparably less variable than in the soft kaolin unit. Hence, ?18O values range from 18.21‰ 

to 19.88‰, with an average of 18.56‰, and from 15.08‰ to 21.77‰, with an average of 

17.47‰ in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  The ?D varies from -75.38‰ to -87.37‰, 

with an average of -80.86‰, and -71.31‰ to -90.10‰, with an average of -78.29‰ in the PPSA 

and IRCC quarries, respectively. 

The present-day meteoric water indicates ?18O and ?D values of –1.3‰ and –0.3‰, and –

4.1‰ and –1.1‰ in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. These values for the groundwater 

collected in the Ipixuna Formation at a depth of 60, indicate –4.9‰ for the oxygen and –22.5‰ 

for the hydrogen (Fig. 5).

4.5 DISCUSSION 

 

4.5.1 Evaluating the influence of the modern meteoric water  

 

A first issue to be approached before using the isotope data for tracing the history of 

kaolinite formation in the Rio Capim area is to evaluate the influence of the modern meteoric 

waters that might have been in contact with these deposits. Although the studied strata are freshly 

exposed, modern kaolinitization is possible considering the geographic location in a humid 

equatorial area, where descending waters might have an influence at several meters of depth. To 

test this possibility, the ?18O and ?D values of a kaolinite in equilibrium with the modern meteoric 

water were estimated with basis on the measured ?18O and ?D values for this water. Despite the 

fact that only one water sample for each studied locality was collected, the resulting ?18O and ?D 

values revealed to be consistent with meteoric waters obtained from other Amazonian areas (see 

Salati et al., 1979).  

Once the ?18O and ?D values from the meteoric waters are known, the isotope values of a 

kaolinite formed in equilibrium with these waters can be estimated with basis on the following 

equations of Savin and Epstein (1970a): 

 

                       1+?18Okao/1000 

??x(kao-water)=   _________________                       (1)

                       1+?18Owater/1000 

 

                       1+?Dkao/1000 

??y(kao-water)=   _________________                       (2)

                       1+?Dwater/1000 

 

Where ??x(kao-water) and ??y(kao-water) are the kaolinite fractionation factors with respect to 

oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. According to measurements considering samples collected 

from a wide geographic distribution, these authors, as well as Lambert and Taylor (1971), 

proposed that the ??x(kao-water)=1.027 and ??x(kao-water)=0.97. If these values are applied to the study 

 90



 91

area, then the ?18Okao and ?Dkao values expected to be in equilibrium with the meteoric water in 

the modern environment would be 26.69‰ and 25.25‰, and –33.98‰ and –31.07‰ in the 

PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  

To test these values, calculations of the ?18Okao and ?Dkao isotope values were also 

obtained directly applying the equations: 

 

1000 ln?(kao-water)=2.5 (106) (T-2)-2.87 for the oxygen                           (3) 

(Land and Dutton, 1978)                  

 

1000 ln?(kao-water)=-4.53 (106) (T-2)+19.4 for the hydrogen                    (4) 

(Lambert and Epstein, 1980)        

 

Where T is the modern annual mean temperature, which is 28oC (or 301oK) for the study 

area. Considering these equations, the obtained ?18Okao and ?Dkao values revealed to be very close 

to the above, i.e., 24.72‰ and 23.70‰ for the ?18O, and –34.01 ‰ and -31.10‰ for the ?D in the 

PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  

The data obtained from the two procedures presented above are comparable, and revealed 

?18O and ?D values that are much heavier than those measured from any of the kaolinite samples 

collected from the study area. Therefore, the measured kaolinite isotope data are not in 

equilibrium with the modern weathering environment.  

The Ipixuna Formation is often overlain by a Miocene and/or post-Miocene succession, 

known as the Barreiras and Post-Barreiras Formation (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003; Rossetti, 

2004). In the particular case of the studied profiles, these deposits average 25 m thick. Despite the 

porous nature imposed by the prevalence of well sorted and well rounded sandstones, it is 

presumed that this thickness, added to the presence of shales and, locally, iron cements along 

unconformities (see Rossetti, 2004), might have acted as barrier for descending waters in the 

modern environment.  

Hence, the measured isotope values of the kaolinite samples might reflect the isotope 

composition of either past meteoric or groundwaters that have been in contact with the Ipixuna 

Formation since its deposition. Alternatively, the data might be related to contaminations caused 

 91

by primary or authigenic minerals that could be not eliminated from the samples, as discussed in 

the following.    

 

4.5.2 Isotope behavior of the Ka+Kb kaolinites 

 

The basic principle used for interpreting kaolinite isotope data is that, once formed, this 

mineral remains isotopically unaltered under surface and near-surface conditions (Lawrence and 

Taylor, 1971, 1972; O’Neil and Kharaka, 1976; Savin and Hsieh, 1998). Thus, the measured 

isotope values would reflect the isotopic composition of the water during the kaolinite formation, 

unless further mineralogical transformations take place.  

As shown in the previous session, there is a wide variation of the ?18O values plotted 

along the studied profiles (i.e., 12.79‰ and 6.39‰ for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, 

respectively), though the range of variation for the ?D (i.e., 9.88‰ and 16.40‰ for the PPSA and 

IRCC quarries, respectively, disregarding samples E14 and E126) is considered negligible (e.g., 

Zhou and Dobos, 1994). Considering the plots of ?18O versus ?D values (Fig. 4.5) from both 

studied quarries, and comparing them with proposed meteoric (Craig, 1961), kaolinite (Savin and 

Epstein, 1970a) and supergene/hypogene (Shepard et al., 1969) lines, a great part of the Ka+Kb 

kaolinites would have formed supergenically, but not under influence of the paleoweathering. 

Considering this diagram, it could also be indicated that a significant amount of these kaolinites, 

particularly in the PPSA quarry, would have been related to a hypogene origin. However, under 

this condition, a more stable kaolinite polymorph would be dickite (Savin and Epstein, 1970a), 

which was not found in the studied deposits, even as traces. It seems that the hypogene origin 

suggested in this diagram is due to the large variation of the ?18O values, at the same time that the 

corresponding ?D values remained relatively constant. Therefore, the binary diagram of Figure 

4.5, worldwide used for distinguishing kaolinites of various origins, seems to be not very useful 

to understand the mode of formation of the kaolinites from the Rio Capim area. 

The relative stability of the ?D values is taken as an indication that once formed the 

Ka+Kb kaolinites of the studied area remained isotopically stable. Under isotopic fractionation at 

low temperature, the hydrogen exchange between the mineral and the associated water occurs at 

much higher rates than with the oxygen, usually negligible (O’Neil and Kharaka, 1976; Bird and 

Chivas, 1988, Longstaffe and Ayalon, 1990). Thus, the cause for the wide oscillation of the ?18O 

 92



 93

values is not related to equilibrium with interacting waters, but it reflects mineralogical 

contaminations. These issues are discussed in the following, but first one must compare the 

isotope values obtained for the kaolinite samples with ancient meteoric and ground waters. This 

is necessary in order to decipher whether the kaolinite formed during past weathering or burial 

conditions.  

As widely considered by many authors (e.g., Savin and Epstein, 1970a,b; Lawrence and 

Taylor, 1971, 1972; Mizota and Longstaffe, 1996; Janssen, 1985; Giral-Kacmarcik et al., 1998; 

Gilg, 2000; Gilg et al., 2003; Girard et al., 2000), the groundwater collected today from a given 

stratigraphic unit would keep the isotopic composition of the groundwater during the time of 

kaolinite formation. Knowing the ?18O and ?D values for the groundwater, the temperature from 

this water can be calculated through the equation: 

 

?18Owater = -11.99+0.338 T (oC)          (Yurstever and Gat, 1981)         (5) 

 

Application of this equation to the Rio Capim area indicates a groundwater temperature 

around 19.2oC. To calculate the ?18O value for the ancient meteoric water, an estimation of the 

paleotemperature at the surface must be provided. The Ipixuna Formation seems to have been 

deposited in an altitude similar to its present location. This is suggested by the altitude of the 

Ipixuna Formation in the Rio Capim, which is comparable to those areas where this unit is 

overlain by a well developed lateritic paleosol, recorded in adjacent tectonically stable terrains. 

Assuming that tectonics was negligible, a surface water temperature of nearly 17.2 oC can be 

estimated, considering a thermal gradient of circa 2oC, for a maximum burial of 60-70 m. This 

temperature is consistent with global temperature values, which estimates colder late Cretaceous 

to early Tertiary climates, characterized by temperatures ranging from 15-20oC (Savin, 1977). 

Applying the estimated ancient surface temperature to equation (5), the ?18O value for the 

surface water is –6.17‰, disregarding seasonal fluctuations. This value can be applied to the 

general equation (6) or the proposed local equation (7) in order to calculate the ?D for the 

corresponding water, as follows: 

 

?D=8 ?18O+10 (Craig, 1961)            (6) 

 

 93



 94

?D=8.1 ?18O+11 (Reis et al., 1977)      (7) 

 

Based on these calculations, the ?D values for the ancient surface water in the Rio Capim 

area are –39.41‰ and –38.97‰, respectively. Applying these values to equations (3) and (4), and 

combining with equations (1) and (2), the ?18Okao and ?Dkao formed in equilibrium with the 

ancient meteoric water would have been equivalent to 20.84‰ and –71.77‰ (-71.35‰ if 

?Dwater=–38.97‰), respectively. On the other hand, applying these same procedures, but using 

the ?18O=-4.9‰ and ?D=-22.5‰ obtained for the groundwater, the ?18Okao and ?Dkao formed in 

equilibrium with this groundwater would have been equivalent to 21.73‰ and –55.43‰, 

respectively. 

Therefore, it can be noticed from the above development that the ?18O values for the 

Ka+Kb kaolinites calculated from both the ancient meteoric water and the temporally equivalent 

groundwater are heavier than the values measured from the kaolinite samples, while the ?D 
values do not differ much. This is also shown by calculations of fractional factors using the 

isotope data measured from Ka+Kb kaolinites, considering the ?18O and ?D values calculated for 

the ancient surface water, and using equations (1) and (2), resulted in values for the oxygen of 

1.009 and 1.010 and for the hydrogen of 0.97 and 0.97 for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. 

These fractionation values are much lower than the ??x(kao-water)=1.027 expected in weathering 

environments, while for the hydrogen are coincident (Savin and Epstein, 1970; Lawrence and 

Taylor, 1971, 1972). 

Based only on the above comparisons, one cannot distinguish whether the Ka+Kb 

kaolinites formed in a diagenetic environment or associated to a paleoweathering. On the other 

hand, as previously mentioned, our ongoing studies point to formation of Ka+Kb kaolinites under 

influence of intrastratal fluids during sediment burial. This is suggested by the coarse-grained 

nature of the kaolinite crystals that are formed by replacement of framework grains. This 

characteristic, added to the good preservation of the sedimentary structures, is more consistent 

with mineralogical replacements taking place at a certain depth. Given the similarities of the 

isotopic values obtained for the Ka+Kb kaolinites with the estimated isotopic signal of kaolinites 

formed near the surface and under influence of groundwater, one can propose that the diagenetic 

environment was most likely located still under influence of the paleoenviroment, i.e., during 

early diagenesis. Under this condition, mineralogical replacements might take place at low 

 94



 95

pressure and temperature, and the intrastral waters might receive a contribution from descending 

meteoric waters, which might result in isotopic exchanges.  

Considering the isotopic equilibrium of the Ka+Kb kaolinites with shallow groundwaters, 

the wide variation of the ?18O values could be attributed to mineralogical contaminations from 

framework grains. As shown by optical studies, the soft kaolin, dominated by Ka and Kb 

kaolinites, displays horizons with quartz, feldspar and muscovite grains, in great part derived 

from igneous (including volcanics) and metamorphic rocks. These minerals, though subordinate, 

show variable rates of replacement by kaolinites. During this process, the kaolinite must go 

completely into solution in order to adopt the isotopic composition of the interacting waters 

(Jassen, 1985). It seems that not all the framework grains were completely dissolved to form the 

kaolinite. In fact, there are many examples of entirely kaolinitized quartz and feldspar grains 

preserving their original shapes, meaning they did not go completely into solution before 

kaolinite was formed. Under this condition, it is more likely that the kaolinite will retain at least 

some of the isotope composition of the parent mineral, instead of going into equilibrium with 

interacting waters. Studies performed on a large number of igneous and metamorphic rocks 

indicate low ?18O values that are usually lower relative to corresponding kaolinites (Silverman, 

1951; Taylor and Epstein, 1962; Garlick and Epstein, 1967). Therefore, it is possible that the 

lower ?18O values of the Ka+Kb kaolinites (i.e., average of 14.83‰ and 16.47‰ for the PPSA 

and IRCC quarries, respectively) relative to the calculated groundwater (i.e., 21.73‰) reflect a 

lower isotopic composition of the parent materials. As the large bulk of the minerals present in 

the framework, with exception of muscovite, do not show hydrogen in their composition, only the 

oxygen would respond to this mineralogical contamination, while the hydrogen would show 

equilibrium with the interacting water.  

 

4.5.3 Isotope behavior of the Kc kaolinites 

 

 Considering only the soft kaolin unit, the isotope data for both oxygen and hydrogen of 

the Kc kaolinite are much more variable when compared to the Ka+Kb kaolinites. As occurs with 

those kaolinites, the measured isotope data of the Kc kaolinite display lower ?18O and lighter ?D 

values than those expected for kaolinites that would have been formed in contact with the modern 

meteoric water. The isotope ?18O and ?D values measured from the Kc kaolinite are lighter than 

 95



 96

the expected values calculated above for both the ancient meteoric water and the temporally 

corresponding groundwater. In addition, the fractionation factors calculated using the same 

procedure as indicated for the Ka+Kb kaolinites, i.e., considering the ?18O and ?D values 

calculated for the ancient surface water, resulted in values for the oxygen of 1.0134 and 1.013, 

and for the hydrogen of 0.937 and 0.922 for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. Combination of 

these data led to the conclusion that the oxygen and the hydrogen are not in equilibrium, neither 

with the ancient meteoric water, nor with the corresponding groundwater. 

 The large variation of the Kc kaolinite from the soft kaolin on both isotope values (Figs. 

4.3-5) might be attributed to significant isotopic exchange after kaolinite formation. The fact that 

the ?18O curves from both of the studied quarries follow the same pattern of oscillation than the 

corresponding Ka+Kb kaolinites is taken as an indication that the Kc kaolinites originated, at 

least in part, from replacement of those kaolinites. Regardless the isotopic exchanges, the finer-

grained kaolinite seems to still keep the isotopic signature of the coarser-grained kaolinites. It is 

noteworthy that these interpretations are in good agreement with optical studies, which indicate 

formation of Kc kaolinites from Ka+Kb kaolinites, as previously mentioned on the geological 

context session. In addition, it is important to remember that our ongoing studies also reveal that 

a large volume of the Kc kaolinite in the soft kaolin unit derives directly from replacement of 

detritic clay minerals associated to muddy layers interbedded with sandstones. The presence of 

quartz, feldspar and muscovite grains in the silty fraction of these mudstones might have also 

caused isotopic contamination, as discussed for the case of the Ka+Kb kaolinites.  

However, part of the Kc kaolinite from the soft kaolin unit might have additionally 

formed during the development of a paleosol horizon related to the top unconformity. In part, this 

is demonstrated by the fact that there is a gradual upward increase in the frequency of Kc 

kaolinite near this unconformity. The paleosol is more expressive in the PPSA quarry (Fig. 4.3), 

where the more stable ?18D values obtained for corresponding samples (i.e., E18, E19 and E21) 

indicate a fractional factor of 0.97 for the hydrogen, calculated with basis on the estimated 

ancient meteoric water. This value fits perfectly with the ??y(kao-water) = 0.97 expected in 

weathering environments (Savin and Epstein, 1970; Lawrence and Taylor, 1971, 1972). Thus, it 

is proposed that as the soft kaolin unit was exposed to the surface, its interaction with ancient 

meteoric waters might have initiated an isotopic re-equilibration, with a first response on the 

hydrogen, in general more suitable for isotopic exchange.   

 96



 97

For the case of the Kc kaolinite from the semi flint unit, the isotope values are, in general, 

relatively lighter than the isotopic composition of the kaolinite calculated from the groundwater 

and ancient meteoric water (Tab. 1). Exception is the hydrogen values, which are comparable 

(i.e.,&amp;lt;10‰) to those obtained for the ancient meteoric water (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). In addition, the 

fractional factors with respect to the oxygen calculated for the ancient surface water is 1.012 and 

1.011, and for the hydrogen is 0.957 and 0.96 for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. 

Thus, only the hydrogen is in equilibrium with this water.  

 Considering that the semi-flint unit is strongly affected by pedogenesis (e.g., 

Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999; Costa and Moraes, 1998), it would be 

expected to have both isotopes in equilibrium with the calculated ancient meteoric water. 

However, the origin of the kaolinite in the semi-flint unit is complex. In part, there seems to have 

detrital kaolin derived from the underlying soft kaolin unit (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2006). These 

are mixed with kaolinite derived from a paleoweathering, which did not take place necessarily 

only in one phase (Rossetti, 2004). In addition, our ongoing studies reveal that the top of the 

semi-flint unit display fractures filled by kaolinite booklets, which could not be extracted from 

the analyzed samples. It is also noteworthy to recall that the semi-flint unit is highly 

contaminated with iron oxides. All these factors might have acted together in order to result in a 

complex isotopic signature for the Kc kaolinite.

4.6 CONCLUSIONS 

 

 The main conclusions that arise from this study are: 

 

1. The results obtained from ?18O and ?D analyses revealed values that are consistent when 

both of the studied profiles are compared. 

2. None of the isotope curves are in equilibrium with calculated values of kaolinites that 

would be formed in equilibrium with the modern local meteoric water. 

3. Tests made with different grain sizes indicated values that are similar for the Ka and Kb 

kaolinites, but these display values that are not comparable to the Kc kaolinites, even 

when samples from a same stratigraphic unit are compared. These differences in isotopic 

data are related to distinct genesis for the two analyzed kaolinite categories. 

4. Binary diagrams contrasting ?18O and ?D values, worldwide applied for distinguishing 

supergenic from hypogenic kaolinites, as well as those formed under weathering 

conditions, can not be applied to the Rio Capim Kaolin. In the case of the Ka+Kb 

kaolinites of the soft kaolin unit, this is because the ?18O values display a large range of 

variation, while the ?D is relatively constant, which results in plots of several samples 

into the hypogenic field. In addition, the corresponding Kc kaolinite for both isotopes 

display highly oscillating curves, with ?D that are anomalously light when compared with 

most of the kaolinites described in the literature. This characterizes samples recording 

isotopic exchanges after kaolinite formation.  

5. Despite these problems, optical studies, combined with comparisons of ?D isotope values 

from the Ka+Kb kaolinites, led to suggest that these reflect values expected for kaolinites 

formed in contact with the groundwater. The discrepant ?18O values are attributed to 

mineralogical contaminations imposed by the different degrees of replacement of quartz, 

feldspar, muscovite and lithics grains. The large variation of the Kc kaolinite isotopic 

values in the soft kaolin unit shows significant exchange after kaolinite formation. 

However, a similar pattern of variation of the ?18O curves on both of the studied area is 

attributed to an origin linked to coarser grained kaolinites formed in the sandstones, as 

well as detrital clays from mudstones, which also contain mineralogical contaminants 

similar to the sandstones in the silty grain size. 

 98



 99

6. Although the semi-flint contains a large volume of paleosol, the ?18O and ?D isotope 

values indicated that the corresponding Kc kaolinite is not in equilibrium with the ancient 

meteoric water. This is attributed to the fact that the origin of these kaolinites might have 

been variable, including kaolinites derived from the underlying soft kaolin unit, kaolinites 

formed during different phases of paleoweathering, as well as later phases of coarse-

grained kaolinites formed along fractures. 

7. The present investigation undertaken in the Rio Capim area led to the conclusion that the 

application of ?18O and ?D might help to substantially increase the understanding of the 

processes involved in the kaolinite formation, particularly when combined with optical 

information.
