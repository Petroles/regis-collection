Abstract 

Urbanization has deep impacts in streams affecting all aspects of the 

ecosystem. The distinctive impacts of urbanization include the increase in 

impervious surfaces which in turn alters the hydrology and geomorphology of 

streams. Thus, urbanization affects not only water quality but also habitat 

characteristics. Biological indicators may reveal spatial-temporal effects of 

stressors and their cumulative effects on stream biota and biotic indices based 

on intolerance to disturbance and taxonomic richness are effective and widely 

used to assess ecological health. However, the multiple, co-occurring and 

interacting stressors of urban streams, namely habitat alterations, may be better 

revealed by macroinvertebrate traits - the species adaptations to environmental 

conditions. The aim of this study is to compare traditional quality assessment 

approaches related to macroinvertebrate community structure and widely used 

biotic indices with information provided by the study of aquatic 

macroinvertebrate traits in order to establish the ability of species traits to 

assess ecological integrity of urban streams. The results obtained during four 

sampling occasions at four sites in Ribeira dos Covões, a small peri-urban 

stream in Coimbra revealed more temporal than spatial variability. The 

combination of five traits related to macroinvertebrate biological (duration of the 

life cycle, resistance form and feeding method), physiological (respiration form) 

and ecological (locomotion and relationship to the substrate) adaptations was 

able to separate sampling dates whose environmental variables were distinct 

but not sites. In conclusion, the use of species traits allows distinguishing 

samples that are clearly associated different environmental characteristics.

Resumo 

A urbanização tem efeitos profundos nos rios afectando todos os aspectos 

do ecossistema. Os efeitos mais distintivos da urbanização incluem o aumento 

de superfícies impermeáveis que por sua vez alteram a hidrologia e a 

geomorfologia dos rios, afectando não só a qualidade da água mas também as 

características do habitat. Os indicadores biológicos podem revelar os efeitos 

espácio-temporais das pressões exercidas sobre o ecossistema mas também 

os seus efeitos cumulativos sobre as comunidades bióticas. Índices bióticos 

baseados na intolerância à perturbação e na riqueza taxonómica são eficazes e 

amplamente utilizados para avaliar a qualidade ambiental. No entanto, a 

multiplicidade de pressões co-ocorrendo e interagindo nos rios urbanos, 

nomeadamente alterações de habitat, poderão ser melhor reveladas 

recorrendo a traits de macroinvertebrados – adaptações das espécies às 

condições ambientais. O objectivo deste estudo é comparar as abordagens 

tradicionais de avaliação de qualidade, relacionadas com a estrutura da 

comunidade de macroinvertebrados e índices bióticos correntemente utilizados, 

com informações obtidas pelo estudo de traits de macroinvertebrados 

aquáticos, a fim de estabelecer a capacidade da sua utilização para avaliar a 

integridade ecológica dos rios urbanos. Os resultados obtidos durante quatro 

amostragens em quatro locais da Ribeira dos Covões, um pequeno rio peri-

urbano de Coimbra, revelaram existir maior variabilidade temporal que 

espacial. A combinação de cinco traits biológicos (duração do ciclo de vida, 

forma de resistência e modo de alimentação), fisiológicos (modo de respiração) 

e ecológicos (locomoção em relação ao substrato) permitiu separar datas de 

amostragem cujas variáveis ambientais foram distintas mas não locais. 

Concluindo, o uso de traits permite distinguir amostras associadas a 

características ambientais distintas.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Importance and Functioning of Flowing Waters 

Fresh water is a finite natural resource that can only be replenished through 

the hydrological cycle in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and 

reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation (Corvalán et 

al., 2005). Fresh water represents only 0.01% of the world’s water but it holds 

approximately 6% of all described species; and the biodiversity decline rates of 

freshwaters are among the most concerning (Dudgeon et al., 2005). Discharge 

of toxic chemicals, over-pumping of aquifers and long-range atmospheric 

transport of pollutants are the major causes for water quality degradation 

(Bartram et al., 1996). While water quality is diminishing the world’s population 

increases, further increasing water demands for irrigation, drinking, household 

uses and industrial production (Rosegrant et al., 2005). Furthermore, water 

resources are not evenly distributed around the globe intensifying competition 

for water (Watkins et al., 2006). 

Pristine rivers shaped the development of ancient civilizations. Cities 

emerged in the fertile areas downstream where agricultural resources were 

ensured and transport costs were lowest (Algaze, 2008). Nowadays, running 

waters are shaped by human needs and subjected in a world-wide scale by a 

variety of water-management practices, overexploitation, flow modification, 

destruction or degradation of habitat and invasion of exotic species (Dudgeon et 

al., 2005), all of which affects stream ecosystems.  

Stream ecosystems are complex and, from source to mouth, a gradient of 

morphological and physical conditions shape the dominant processes and the 

biotic communities (Vannote et al., 1980). Low order streams are narrow and 

shaded by the surrounding riparian canopy, limiting primary production in water. 

Riparian vegetation plays an important role structuring the ecosystem as it 

heavily contributes to the energy flux when primary production is insufficient 

(Allan 1995, Imberge et al., 2008). The communities on those headwater 

9 
 



  

streams rely on materials coming from outside the channel, such as leaves and 

twigs (CPOM – coarse particulate organic matter), as the main energy source. 

Shredding invertebrate detritivores, by breaking leaves into smaller pieces will 

convert CPOM into smaller particles - fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), 

which is used downstream as food by other organisms, the collectors and the 

filterers. When moving downstream the stream channel widens reducing 

shading from riparian canopy, increasing the amount of incident sunlight and 

allowing for more primary production and thus more phytoplankton and algae in 

water that serve as food source for scrapers and collectors. Close to the mouth 

the influence of riparian vegetation lowers to a minimum and the 

macroinvertebrate communities are mainly composed of collectors and 

predators. (Vannote et al., 1980).   

1.2. Effects of Human Activities on Streams 

Human activities have been causing increasing alterations in surface waters 

and the hydrological cycle. Those activities include the alteration of the land 

cover of river basins, the regularization of the water fluxes, the construction of 

dams for irrigation or other purposes, soil drainage, and groundwater extraction, 

among others (Kuchment, 2004).  

Regarding urbanization, the replacement of the natural land cover by the 

urban impermeable surfaces results in the most significant alterations, greatly 

reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration, and increasing surface runoff 

(Kuchment, 2004). The removal of riparian vegetation, the decreased 

groundwater recharge and the “heat island” effect associated with urbanization 

affect stream temperature increasing the mean temperature during the summer 

while decreasing in winter (Pluhowski, 1970), altering stream ecosystem 

processes such as leaf decomposition (Webster and Benfield, 1986) and 

invertebrate life history (Sweeney, 1984). Depending on the type and extent of 

urbanization, the presence of wastewater treatment plants, effluents and/or 

combined sewage overflows, and the extent of storm water drainage, the 

chemical effects are less predictable than hydrologic or geomorphic effects 

10 
 



  

(Paul and Meyer, 2001). Therefore, all aspects of the stream aquatic habitat are 

altered by urbanization: the ‘urban stream syndrome’. The urban stream 

syndrome describes the recurrently observed ecological degradation of streams 

draining urban land, including symptoms as a flashier hydrograph, increased 

temperatures, concentration of nutrients (organic and inorganic), contaminants, 

and siltation and altered channel morphology (Paul and Meyer, 2001, Meyer et 

al., 2005).  

The responses of the macroinvertebrate communities to these alterations 

can be summarized as follows: (i) decreased biotic richness and diversity in 

response to contaminants, temperature change, siltation and organic nutrients; 

(ii) decreased abundances in response to toxins and siltation and (iii) increased 

dominance of tolerant species in response to inorganic and organic nutrients 

(Resh and Grodhaus, 1983, Wiederholm, 1984, Paul and Meyer, 2001, Meyer 

et al., 2005). Leaf breakdown can also be indirectly affected by urbanization 

when indigenous riparian species are replaced by exotic species that differ in 

quality, quantity or even seasonality (Abelho and Graça, 1996, Miller and 

Boulton, 2005, Ryder and Miller, 2005). The riparian vegetation assemblage 

may be altered due to various processes such as enrichment of riparian soils 

(Riley and Banks, 1996), drying of riparian soils following stream incision 

(Groffman et al., 2003) or simply deforestation and replanting. These alterations 

in leaf litter may affect the macroinvertebrate community (Abelho and Graça, 

1996), especially detritivore shredders, which can have bottom-up effects on the 

food web (Gulis and Suberkropp, 2003, Lepori et al., 2005) especially on low 

order streams were shredders are of crucial importance in the energy cycle. 

Agriculture effects include altered water chemistry that may result in increased 

levels of nitrates and phosphates (which may lead to eutrophication), increased 

conductivity, food web modification with increased Chironomidae densities and 

descreased Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera abundances , biocide leaching and 

increased suspended loads from soil erosion (Welch et al., 1977, Moss, 2008).

1.3. Stream Health Assessment  

The awareness that rivers supporting rich and diverse fauna are valuable 

natural resources led to an increased concern towards stream ecological health 

and to the use of ecological indicators for water quality assessment (Abel, 1996, 

Wenn, 2008). Ecological indicators integrate the condition of resources, the 

magnitude of stresses, and the exposure of biological components to stress, 

related impacts and consequences (Manoliadis, 2002).  

Conventionally, water quality was assessed by measuring chemical 

parameters, which are efficient and allow precise measurements of pollutant 

concentrations. However, water quality in flowing waters oscillates rapidly and 

chemical analysis may fail to identify peak of pollutant concentrations. Stream 

biota may respond to extremely low levels of pollutants and reflect water quality 

over an extended period of time, thus biological methods my reveal information 

that is not accessible via punctual chemical sampling (Abel, 1996, Ziglio et al., 

2006).  

To assess the ecological condition in urban ecosystems, it is vital to define a 

target condition for management. However, the complexity of restorable 

benchmarks increases where multiple stressors influence ecosystem quality 

(Davies and Jackson, 2006), such as in urban streams. In addition, restorable 

benchmarks may also vary along the river continuum where not all sites or river 

reaches have the ability to attain a pristine condition. Therefore, a continuum 

approach (Carter and Fend, 2005) that sets the realistic minimum condition for 

ecological restoration based on the level of urbanization provides a context for 

evaluating both the current condition and the potential for recovery of impacted 

waters. This context can allow for more realistic management targets and 

prioritization of sites for restoration and protection (Stoddard et al., 2006). 

Reference sites are commonly used in bioassessment studies to identify 

undisturbed or pristine conditions, as a means of comparison between 

degradation levels and therefore management targets (Hughes, 1995, Prins and 

Smith, 2007). However, the continuous urban development often results in the 

absence of reference sites in urban streams (Chessman and Royal, 2004) and 

12 
 



  

it may be thus difficult to define a target condition for restoring urban stream 

sites (Meyer et al., 2005).  

1.4. Macroinvertebrates as Assessment Tools 

In 23 October 2000 the European Parliament and the Council established a 

framework for community action in the field of water policy named The Water 

Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD). This framework overhauls existing 

policies on European water quality management, and establishes the 

requirement for ecological assessment of water quality (Bell and McGillivray, 

2006). The purpose is ‘to prevent further deterioration and to protect and 

enhance the status of aquatic ecosystems’ (European Council, 2000). Member 

states must achieve ‘good ecological and chemical status’ in all surface waters 

by 2015, where ‘good’ is defined with reference to pristine environments.  

Macroinvertebrates are one group that the WFD requires member states to 

monitor. Because macroinvertebrate families are diverse in their pollution 

sensitivity, their relative abundance is used to understand the nature, load and 

severity of contamination (MacNeil et al., 2002). As the group is heterogeneous 

it is likely that some members respond to pollution. Some members have long 

life histories which allow the observation of temporal changes in communities 

and the pollution to which they are responding (Abel, 1996, Ziglio et al., 2006). 

For instance, stoneflies (Plecoptera) are highly sensitive to organic pollution due 

to their high oxygen requirements (Mason, 2002), while mayflies 

(Ephemeroptera) are sensitive to environmental stress. However, the 

ephemeropterans Baetidae are reasonably tolerant of nutrient enrichment (Hall 

and Lenwood, 2006) and dominate in poorer environmental conditions than 

other mayflies. Caddisflies (Trichoptera) are sensitive to environmental stress, 

though some families such as Limnephilidae and Hydropsychidae are relatively 

tolerant (Hall and Lenwood, 2006). Chironomidae (Diptera) are widely tolerant 

to organic pollution, although Stuijfzand et al. (2000) claim that the success of 

this group is more related to the use of organic food sources, rather than 

“tolerance” to pollution. Aquatic worms (Oligochaeta) are extremely tolerant to 

13 
 



  

organic pollution and able to survive anoxic conditions due to the presence of 

hemoglobin (Mason, 2002). However, factors such as drift and seasonality may 

camouflage the effects of water quality on the aquatic communities in urban 

streams (Paul and Meyer, 2001, Wenn, 2008). 

1.5. Species Traits 

Traits are the attributes of species related to physiological, morphological 

and life-history adaptive features that are intrinsic to the organism and 

consequently can be measured on the individual level without making reference 

to the environment (Violle et al., 2007). Macroinvertebrate adaptations to 

environmental conditions are characterized by their species traits. 

As trait classifications are not bound to taxonomy (Menezes et al., 2010), 

trait-based assessments are not limited by the spatial-temporal specificity of 

traditional assessment methods. Instead, trait-based approaches rely on the 

commonality of traits instead of species identity (Verberk et al., 2013), offering 

advantages as (i) direct transferability to distant geographic locations, (ii) direct 

comparability of biologically determined quality standards (Statzner et al., 2001, 

2008, Horrigan and Baird, 2008), and (iii) enhanced understanding of species-

environment relationships (Kearney and Porter, 2009). Because certain traits 

influence the organism performance they also reflect the ecosystem functioning 

and therefore can be used as measures of community functional diversity 

(Petchey and Gaston, 2006, McGill et al., 2006).  

Tachet (1996) showed that the genus and even the family level are sufficient 

to describe the functional diversity (e.g., traits) of lotic invertebrate communities 

(Usseglio-Polatera et al., 2000). Species preferences and adaptations 

described by their traits can reveal certain effects of urbanization such as 

alterations on the river bed or river flow. However, species performance is a 

combination of natural selection and species sorting which do not apply on the 

level of single traits but on the whole organism carrying multiple traits. 

Therefore, is the combination, rather than single traits, that represents the 

14 
 



  

adaptive response to the environment (Stearns, 1976, Grime, 1977, 

Southwood, 1977, Winemiller and Rose, 1992, Verberk et al., 2008). 

1.6. Objectives 

The objective of this study is to compare traditional quality assessment 

approaches related to macroinvertebrate community structure and widely used 

biotic indices with information provided by the study of aquatic 

macroinvertebrate traits in order to establish the ability of species traits to 

assess ecological integrity of urban streams.  

2. Material and Methods 

2.1. Study Area 

The study stream was Ribeira dos Covões, a left tributary of the Mondego 

River located on the outskirts of Coimbra – Central Portugal (40° 12? 41? North, 

8° 25? 45? West). Ribeira dos Covões is a 4th order small peri-urban stream 

draining a 7 km2 basin (Pato et al., 2011). Its source is located at an elevation of 

177 m, it flows 4.5 km before reaching its mouth at an elevation of 22 meters 

(Pato, 2007), conferring a 3.4% gradient. In the last three decades, the area has 

been exposed to continuous urbanization. In 2001 the catchment area had an 

estimated resident population of 7000 inhabitants in an irregular distribution, 

with 25% of the basin urbanized in 2002 (Ferreira, 2008). The basin is covered 

by 55.5% forest, 13.0% farmland and 31.5% artificial surfaces (Ferreira et al., 

2011).  

The area is characterized by a humid Mediterranean climate with an 

average annual temperature of +15 ºC and with a total rainfall of 980 mm during 

an average year, with strong seasonal and inter-annual variability (Ferreira et 

al., 2011). During the study period (Table 1) mean daily temperature ranged 

15 
 



  

9.8ºC to 20.9ºC and total precipitation ranged 0 mm to a maximum of 204.6 mm 

during the heavy precipitation events of December-January.

2014; data collected at the nearest meteorological station located in Bencanta 
(Escola Superior Agrária), Coimbra (max=maximum; min=minimum).

2.2. Sampling Sites 

Four different locations along the river longitudinal profile were chosen 

based on easiness of access and on earlier studies (Ribeiro, 2004; Fernandes, 

2005; Soares, 2009). The sites were numbered 1 to 4 from source to mouth as 

L1, L2, L3 and L4. 

The first sampling site (L1; Figure 1) is located 1605 m from the source, 

below a hospital center and above a factory. There is a riparian gallery 

upstream of the sampling site, composed of shrubs and deciduous trees. The 

channel is relatively natural, with a “v” section, and the substrate is mainly 

composed of pebbles, gravel and boulders. The second sampling site (L2; 

Figure 1) is located 640 m downstream L1. The riparian vegetation is dominated 

by small shrubs and herbaceous plants with a few dispersed trees. At the end of 

the summer, the channel was covered by aquatic plants. The stream channel 

has an open “u” section, and above the sampling site there is a bridge which fell 

down during the heavy precipitation events of December. The terrains around 

the site have been profoundly modified due to the construction of roads. The 

16 
 



  

substrate is a mixture of fine sediment and gravel, the surrounding area is 

agricultural and pastures with nearby habitations. The third sampling site (L3, 

Figure 1) is located 493 m downstream L2, has a prairie on the left margin and 

a dense Mediterranean bush on the right margin which composes a closed 

riparian gallery. It is located upstream a small dam, with a wide “u” section and 

accumulates fine sand which is the only substrate. The fourth sampling site (L4, 

Figure 1) is located 790 m downstream L3, inside ESAC (Escola Superior 

Agrária de Coimbra). The construction of roads and pathways led to highly 

modified riparian vegetation that doesn’t exceed one tree in width with the rest 

being mainly annual shrubs. Upstream there is a small dam and the channel is 

mostly artificial. The substrate is composed of pebbles and gravel. The 

surrounding area is mainly for cattle and agricultural uses.

Covões catchment; Google ™) 

2.3. Sampling  

The four study sites were sampled on four occasions (11 September and 12 

November 2013, 29 January and 9 April 2014, D1, D2, D3 and D4 respectively). 

17 
 



  

On each sampling occasion, water temperature, pH, TDS, conductivity and 

dissolved oxygen were measured in situ with field instruments (pH 3110 SET 2 

incl. SenTix® 41, Oxi 3210 SET 1 incl. CellOx® 325). Water samples were 

collected, transported in an ice-chest, filtered (Whatman® Glass microfiber 

filters, Grade GF/F) and the water was analyzed to determine orthophosphate 

(PO4-P), nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonia (NH4-N) concentrations (Hach® Lange 

DR 3900).  

After sampling, channel width was measured on five transects along a reach 

of circa 10 m, depth was measured at five points along each transect and 

surface current velocity was determined by measuring the time taken by a 

floating object to travel along the reach. Discharge was calculated as the cross-

sectional area of the portion of the channel times the average current velocity. 

The physicochemical parameters of the study sites ate shown in Table 2.  

Biological sampling was carried out on all habitats using a Surber net 

(0.0929 m2, 500 ?m mesh) with the same effort for each replicate with a total of 

six replicate samples per site. Samples were collected from downstream to 

upstream at each sampling site, individually allocated to plastic bags, carried 

out in an ice-chest and refrigerated (5ºC) until processing. In the laboratory the 

content of each bag was washed through a 500 ?m sieve, placed into a tray and 

all macroinvertebrates were collected and preserved in 70% alcohol.

2.4. Identification and Trait Classification 

Identification was carried out to the lowest practicable taxonomic level using 

the identification key of Tachet et al. (2000). From the 21 species traits provided 

in this book (Appendix Table 1), five traits were selected for the study: three 

biological (life cycle duration, resistance form and feeding), one physiological 

(respiration) and one ecological (locomotion-relationship to the substrate). The 

taxa abundances per trait were calculated by summing all organisms that 

shared affinity for a certain modality of a trait. When one taxon had the same 

affinity for various modalities of a trait, its abundance was evenly distributed 

among them.  

The trait concerning life cycle duration had only two modalities, (i) ? 1 year 

and (ii) &gt; 1 year. The trait concerning resistance form had four different 

modalities represented by (i) eggs, gemmules, statoblasts, shells; cocoons; 

(ii) diapause or quiescence; and (iii) none, but there was no information for 

some of the taxa. The trait concerning feeding method had six different 

modalities represented by (i) eater of fine sediment; (ii) shredder; (iii) scraper-

grazer; (iv) filter feeder; (v) piercer; and (vi) predator. The trait concerning 

respiration form had four different modalities represented by (i) tegument; 

(ii) gill; (iii) plastron; and (iv) stigmata. Finally, the trait concerning locomotion-

relationship to the substrate had five different modalities represented by 

19 
 



  

(i) surface swimmer; (ii) swimmer in open water; (iii) crawler; (iv) burrower; and 

(v) temporary fixation. 

The community was characterized in terms of density (nº of individuals m-2), 

diversity (Shannon diversity index and Margalef community index; PRIMER® 

version 6.1.13) and eveness (Pielou’s evenness index; PRIMER® version 

6.1.13). For quality assessment purposes, %EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera 

and Trichoptera) abundance and richness, the biotic indexes IBMWP and ASPT 

were calculated (Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002).  

IBMWP is an adaptation of the original BMWP to the Iberian Peninsula 

ecosystems. The BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score is an 

index for assessing the river biological quality using macroinvertebrate species 

on a presence – absence basis, each family has as a score ranging from 1 

(tolerant) to 10 (intolerant) according to its intolerance to pollution (Alba-

Tercedor et al., 2002). The final score is the sum of the scores of all families in 

the sample (Table 3). In order to account for sample size, as larger sample 

sizes are likely to include more taxa biasing the results, the Average Score Per 

Taxon (ASPT; Table 4) can be calculated by dividing the total BMWP scores by 

the number of taxa.  

The %EPT index (Table 4) is based on the fact that macroinvertebrates from 

the families Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera have low tolerance to 

pollution and represent various functional groups: predators, scrapers and 

shredders (Lenat, 1988).

3.0 – 3.6 Poor    
1.0 – 2.9 Very poor    

2.5. Statistical Analysis  

Data was analyzed by MDS (multidimensional scaling), cluster analysis and 

ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) with the software PRIMER® version 6.1.13 

and the probability level set at ?=0.05. In MDS, the goal of the analysis is to 

detect meaningful underlying dimensions that allow explaining observed 

similarities or dissimilarities (distances) between the investigated objects. 

Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool which aims at sorting 

different objects into groups in a way that the degree of association between 

two objects is maximal if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise. 

ANOSIM provides a way to test statistically whether there is a significant 

difference between two or more groups of sampling units. 

The biological data was transformed with log(x+1) and converted to a 

similarity matrix using the Bray-Curtis coefficient before analysis. MDS achieved 

by a maximum of 500 iterations, a 0.01 minimum stress and a Kruskal fit 

scheme 1. For the cluster analysis, agglomeration was achieved with group 

averages. A two-way (sampling site and occasion) crossed ANOSIM with no 

replicates was performed with 999 permutations. The transformed matrix was 

tested with a one-way SIMPER (Similarity Percentages) analysis using the 

Bray-Curtis coefficient and a cut-off percentage of 90% to examine the 

percentage contribution of each taxon or trait to the similarity within the cluster 

21 
 



  

and to the difference between two clusters. Environmental data was 

transformed as above and normalized (the values for each variable had their 

mean subtracted and then divided by their standard deviation) before using the 

Euclidean distance to calculate the similarity matrix. A Spearman correlation 

was used to create vectors of the environmental data into the MDS spatial 

distribution of the biological data. 

3. Results

Macroinvertebrate density across all sampling occasions (Appendix Table 2) 

ranged from 119 individuals m-2 at L1 on date 3 to 66054 individuals m-2 at L4 

on date 4 (Figure 2, top). Dates 2 and 3 registered the lowest densities while 

dates 1 and 4 registered the highest. Overall, L3 attained the highest while L1 

attained the lowest density. Richness ranged from 6 taxa at L1 on date 2 to 30 

taxa at L1 on date 2 (Figure 2, bottom). Dates 2 and 3 registered the lowest 

macroinvertebrate richness while dates 1 and 4 the highest richness. Overall, 

L1 and L2 had the highest while L4 had the lowest richness.  

The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.356 at L3 on date 4 to 2.076 at 

L1 on date 4, varying both along the longitudinal and the temporal gradients 

(Figure 3, top) with no specific pattern. Globally, L1 showed the highest while L3 

showed the lowest index value. Margalef community index (Figure 3, middle) 

ranged 1.306 at L1 on date 2 to 4.655 at L1 on date 1. Dates 2 and 4 registered 

the lowest values while dates 1 and 3 the highest index values. Overall, L1 

attained the highest while L4 the lowest value. Pielou’s evenness index (Figure

3.2. Environmental Health Assessment 

3.2.1. %EPT and Biotic Indices  

The percentage abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera 

(EPT) ranged from 0.04% at L2 on date 1 to 68.42% at L4 on date 2 (Figure 4, 

top). The percentage richness of EPT taxa ranged from 3.85% at L2 on date 1 

to 33.33% at L1 on date 2 (Figure 4, bottom). EPT percentages showed both 

longitudinal and temporal variability, with higher values on dates 2 and 3 and on 

L1 and L4. Based on %EPT scores (Appendix Table 4), the sites L1 and L4 are 

classified undisturbed while L2 and L3 as heavily disturbed.

The IBMWP score ranged from 22 at L3 on date 3 to 99 at L2 on date D1 

(Figure 5, top). Dates 1 and 4 had the highest while dates 2 and 3 the lowest 

scores. Overall, L2 had the highest while L4 the lowest score. ASPT score 

ranged from 3.1 at L3 on date 3 to 4.9 also at L3 on date 1 (Figure 5, bottom). 

Globally, L2 had the highest while L1 the lowest ASPT score. According to 

IBMWP scores (Appendix Table 4), the sites L1, L2 and L3 are classified as 

very good, unpolluted or with no sensitive alterations while the site L4 is 

classified as good, with slight effects of pollution or disturbance. The ASPT 

results (Appendix Table 4) classified site L1 with moderated quality and sites 

L2, L3 and L4 as good quality.

3.2.2. Species Traits  

The macroinvertebrate community (Appendix Table 3)  was dominated by 

short life-cycles on almost all sites and sampling dates, with the exception of 

date 4 at L2, L3 and L4 where life-cycles &gt; 1 year where more abundant than 

life-cycles ? 1 year (Figure 6).  

 
Figure 6. Duration of the life cycle: percentage of macroinvertebrates with life-cycles 
? 1 year or &gt; 1 year at the four sampling sites. D1, D2, D3, and D4 refer to the 
sampling dates. 

In relation to the resistance form, the macroinvertebrate taxa using diapause 

or quiescence were the most abundant while macroinvertebrate taxa using 

cocoons as resistance forms were the least abundant (Figure 7). There was a 

tendency for the increase in resistance form using eggs, gemmules, statoblasts 

or shells along the time.  Overall, taxa using diapause or quiescence were more 

abundant at L2, taxa using eggs, gemmules, statoblasts or shells at L4, taxa 

using cocoons at L4 and taxa without a resistance form at L1.

Shredders were the most abundant feeding group followed by eaters of fine 

sediment and grazers-scrapers (Figure 8), except for L4 where grazers-

scrapers were dominant. Eaters of fine sediment tended to increase with time, 

especially at L3 and L4, while shredders and predators decreased. Overall, 

eaters of fine sediment were most abundant at L3, shredders at L2, and 

scraper-grazers and filter feeders at L4.

Gills were the dominant respiration form followed by tegument, which tended 

to increase downstream and with time (Figure 9). Respiration by tegument, gill 

and plastron were most abundant on dates 1 and 4 and by stigmata on dates 3 

and 4. Overall, respiration by tegument was most abundant at L3, by gill at L2 

and by plastron and stigmata respiration at L1.

plastron or stigmata at the four sampling sites. D1, D2, D3, and D4 refer to the 
sampling dates. 

Regarding locomotion – relation to the substrate, swimmers in open water 

were the dominant group, and were more abundant at L2 and L3 (Figure 10). 

Crawlers dominated the community on dates 3 and 4 at L1 and on dates 2 and 

3 at L4. Temporary fixation was most abundant at L4, especially on date 3 while 

burrowers and surface swimmers were most abundant at L1.

3.3. Multivariate analyses  

3.3.1. Taxa 

There were no significant differences among sites or dates (ANOSIM, 

R=0.019, p=0.388) and R=0.190, p=0.176, respectively). The MDS distribution 

shows that the macroinvertebrate community structure is more influenced by 

sampling date than by site, with samples from date 4 clustered together and 

most of the samples from date 3 also clustered (Figure 11).

Figure 11. Cluster (MDS) of the similarity matrix of macroinvertebrate abundances 
per taxon. Data was transformed with log (x+1) and the Bray-Curtis coefficient was 
used to calculate similarity between sites (Local 1, Local 2, Local 3, and Local 4) and 
sampling dates (? D1, ? D2, ? D3, and ? D4). 

3.3.2. Traits 

There were no significant differences (ANOSIM) among sites or dates for 

any of the individual traits: life cycle duration (Site: R=-0.067, p=0.618; Date: 

R=0.305, p=0.054), resistance form (Site: R=0.086, p=0.324; Date: R=0.229, 

p=0.125), feeding method (Site: R=0.057, p=0.335; Date: R=0.171, p=0.195), 

respiration (Site: R=-0.019, p=0.479; Date: R=0.314, p=0.056) nor locomotion 

and relationship to the substrate (Site: R=0.048, p=0.379; Date: R=0.162, 

p=0.198). When the five traits were analyzed together, there were no significant 

differences among sites (ANOSIM, R=-0.029, p=0.540) but there were 

significant differences between among dates (R=0.371, p=0.048). At 65% 

similarity the samples cluster around two groups (Figure 12). At 80% similarity 

three groups are formed, one containing three samples from date 4, other 

containing two samples of site 4 and another containing almost all other 

samples (Figure 12). Table 5 shows the trait modalities which contributed to at 

least 50% of the similarity among sampling dates.

Environmental data was significantly different among dates (ANOSIM, R = 

0.571, p= 0.007) but not among sampling sites (ANOSIM, R=0.19, p=0.203). 

Figure 13 shows the MDS spatial distribution. The samples were mostly 

clustered according to the sampling date and not site. Table 4 shows which 

variables contributed to at least 70% of the similarity among dates.

Figure 14 shows the Spearman correlation between the abiotic factors and 

traits in the MDS spatial distribution. Orthophosphate, nitrate and pH are more 

related to the group containing three sites from date 4; discharge, water velocity 

and dissolved oxygen are more related to the groups containing two dates from 

L4 and total dissolved solids (TDS), temperature, conductivity and ammonia are 

more related to the remaining samples.

4. Discussion 
Trait-based approaches provide clear advantages compared to the use of 

taxonomic-based approaches, such as important insights into structure and 

functioning of stream communities (Usseglio-Polatera et al., 2000) or even dual 

advantages of direct transferability to distant geographic locations and direct 

comparability of biologically determined quality standards (Statzner et al., 2001, 

2008; Horrigan and Baird, 2008). However, there are still issues needing 

clarification which difficult their application, such as the lack of adequate 

understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated (Poff et al., 2006) and 

the alternative trade-offs between traits combinations (e.g., Resh et al.,1994, 

Usseglio-Polatera et al., 2000).  

The objective of the present work was to compare trait-based results with 

those obtained with conventional tools related to community structure 

35 
 



  

(community density, diversity and evenness) and environmental health 

assessment (IBMWP, ASPT, %EPT) in order to allow some insight into the way 

how species traits may be used to identify urban stream disturbance. The 

results related with community structure indicated that the macroinvertebrate 

community was more diverse and the abundances were more evenly distributed 

at L1, the sampling site closer to the source and less modified, with a natural 

channel shape and good riparian vegetation. L2 was the second more diverse 

but one of the worst in relation to evenness, which is probably related to the 

high environmental variation observed during the four sampling occasions. In 

this site, at late summer the stream channel was filled with macrophytes while 

during winter, and especially after the heavy rains of December-January, the 

channel was filled with debris of a fallen bridge. Also, the high abundance of 

snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) contributed to the uneven abundance 

distribution. L3 was the second less diverse site and the worst in terms of 

evenness. This was related to the slower current velocity (due to the 

downstream dam), the fine sediment composing the substrate, and consequent 

high abundance of Oligochaeta, mainly Naididae. L4 was the less diverse but 

had one of the highest evenness. The low diversity is probably related to the 

fact that this is the sampling site farther away from the source and heavily 

modified both in terms of river channel and riparian vegetation. However, the 

evenness of the community suggests that, despite the habitat alterations, a 

well-established macroinvertebrate community is thriving in that environment.  

Community richness was higher at the less disturbed site (L1) and 

decreased along the longitudinal gradient – where multiple stressors contributed 

to increasingly disturbed habitats. These results show an  opposite trend to the 

ones obtained by McCabe and Gotelli (2000), who found higher richness 

disturbance treatments than in undisturbed controls, and also contradict the 

pattern predicted by the dynamic-equilibrium model of Huston’s (1979, 1994) for 

communities with the species populations growing rapidly and having high rates 

of competitive exclusion. However, the results obtained in this study seem to 

support the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis, with diversity peaking at an 

intermediate level of disturbance (L1) and decreasing with increasing 

disturbance downstream. Evidences for the intermediate-disturbance 

36 
 



  

hypothesis have been found at communities with high rates of competitive 

displacement (Huston, 1994).  

The three indexes differed on the quality classification attributed to each site. 

The %EPT showed the existence of heavy disturbance on L2 and L3 while both 

IBMWP and ASPT classified both sites as very good quality or with no sensitive 

alterations (IBMWP) or as good quality status (ASPT). L1 ranged from good 

quality (ASPT), to unpolluted with no sensitive alterations (IBMWP) and to 

undisturbed (%EPT), mainly due to the abundance of intolerant taxa. In fact, it 

was the only site where Plecoptera were found (Nemoura sp.). L2 had the best 

IBMWP and ASPT scores but %EPT abundance and richness were among the 

lowest, granting a classification of heavily disturbed. This may be related, as 

discussed above, with the drastic seasonal variation observed at this location. 

Similarly, L3 was also well classified in terms of IBMWP and ASPT scores, with 

good to moderate quality but the %EPT abundance was the lowest granting a 

classification of heavily disturbed. As discussed above, the characteristics of the 

river bed and the reduced flow might have prevented the existence of a more 

diverse macroinvertebrate community, especially the members of the EPT 

group. According to IBMWP and ASPT, L4 had moderate to good quality status 

with some slight effects of pollution or alteration but had the highest percentage 

of members of the EPT group and the second best richness among them. 

These results are in agreement with the general objectives of the indices, with 

IBMWP and ASPT mainly assessing the effect of organic pollution (Hawkes, 

1998) while several EPT members are reasonable tolerant to nutrient 

enrichment (Hall and Lenwood, 2006). 

As in other studies where taxonomic data suggested only a weak and 

inconsistent response of biodiversity to hydromorphological impact in the lotic 

environment (e.g. Feld et al., 2014, Gerisch et al., 2011), in the present study 

taxonomic data did not distinguish habitat alterations due to either temporal or 

spatial variability. The same was true for the single trait analyses which 

revealed no significant differences among sampling sites or dates. Regarding 

the feeding method, the community was dominated by shredders in almost all 

sampling dates at sites L1 to L3, revealing that although this feeding group may 

37 
 



  

be abundant in impacted streams (Tolkkeinen et al., 2013) it does not overcome 

the multiple stressors related to habitat alteration at L4.  

The combined use of the five traits allowed the separation of dates, thus 

revealing that the combination of traits is more sensitive to environmental 

variation than its individual counterparts. Environmental variability related to 

date was more pronounced than environmental variability related to sampling 

site, which explains the absence of significant differences among the four 

sampling sites – related to the inexistence of heavy distortions along the 

longitudinal gradient of the stream, and the significant differences among the 

sampling occasions – related to the high seasonal variability during the study 

period, especially regarding precipitation events and consequent effects in the 

stream habitat.  

The high precipitation events which occurred before sampling date 3 caused 

alterations in water chemistry (ammonia, nitrates and orthophosphates), as well 

as pH, TDS and conductivity, which clustered the combination of traits in the 

MDS and cluster analysis. Additionally, the occurrence of high densities of taxa 

such as Naididae sp. in only the last sampling occasion introduce a strong 

temporal rather than a spatial trend. Those highly abundant but temporally 

concentrated taxa were dominated, in terms of traits, by resistance in the form 

of eggs, gemmules, statoblasts, and shells, by feeders of fine sediment, by 

tegument respiration, and by swimmers in open water. Thus, these traits also 

contributed significantly for the separation of the data by sampling date instead 

of sampling site.  

The multi-trait MDS analysis (Figure 12) provided no insight into the relation 

of species traits and conventional community and water quality assessment 

methods, since the groups included highly variable classifications of water 

quality based on %EPT, IBMWP and ASPT and also community diversity and 

evenness. The biggest group formed by 80% similarity corresponded to quality 

classifications of the %EPT and the biotic indices ranging from poor to very 

good and to community diversity and evenness ranging from low to high. The 

second biggest group formed by three samples from date 4 (L2, L3 and L4) 

ranged from poor to moderate quality with medium to high diversity compared 

38 
 



  

and the worst abundance distributions. The group containing the remaining 

samples at 65% similarity (Figure 12) ranged poor to good quality and from 

medium to high diversity and the best abundance distribution of species. 

In conclusion, although the use of the five traits did not allow a spatial 

separation of the study sites, it clearly separated sampling dates whose 

environmental variables were also distinct. Thus, the use of traits allows 

distinguishing samples that are clearly associated to variables related to habitat 

characteristics. The lack of a pronounced quality gradient along the longitudinal 

stream profile limited the possibility of finding significant differences among 

sites. Moreover, because sampling was carried out only four times, and did not 

complete a full seasonal cycle, some of results obtained could not be attributed 

to a natural pattern or to the effect of perturbation, such as urbanization effects 

or land use. A more complete data set collected at sites with a more 

pronounced quality gradient is necessary to assess the utility of the trait-based 

approaches on the evaluation of disturbance in urban streams.
