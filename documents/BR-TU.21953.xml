ABSTRACT

The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible methods to enhance the rate of aerobic
biodegradation of hydrocarbons (ex-situ treatments). In this work, the bioremediation processes were applied
to a sandy soil with a high level of contamination originated from the leakage of a diesel oil underground
storage tank at a petrol station. Laboratory scale experiments (Bartha biometer flasks) were used to evaluate
the biodegradation of the diesel oil. Enhancement of biodegradation was carried out through biostimulation
(addition of nitrogen and phosphorus solutions or Tween 80 surfactant) and bioaugmentation (bacterial
consortium isolated from a landfarming system). To investigate interactions between optimizing factors, and
to find the right combination of these agents, the study was based on full factorial experimental design.
Efficiency of biodegradation was simultaneously measured by two methods: respirometric (microbial CO2
production) and gas chromatography. Acute toxicity tests with Daphnia similis were applied for examination
of the efficiency of the processes in terms of the generation of less toxic products. Results showed that all
bioremediation strategies enhanced the natural bioremediation of the contaminated soil and the best results
were obtained when treatments had nutritional amendment. Respirometric data indicated a maximum
hydrocarbon mineralization of 19.8%, obtained through the combination of the three agents, with a total
petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) removal of 45.5% in 55 days of treatment. At the end of the experiments, two
predominant bacteria species were isolated and identified (Staphylococcus hominis and Kocuria palustris).

INTRODUCTION

Diesel oil leakages from underground storage tanks,
distribution facilities and various industrial operations represent
an important source of soil and aquifer contamination. This fuel
is a complex mixture of normal, branched and cyclic alkanes,
and aromatic compounds obtained from the middle-distillate
fraction during petroleum separation (14).

Among several clean-up techniques available to remove
petroleum hydrocarbons from the soil and groundwater,
bioremediation processes are gaining ground due to their

simplicity, higher efficiency and cost-effectiveness when
compared to other technologies (3). These processes rely on
the natural ability of microorganisms to carry out the
mineralization of organic chemicals, leading ultimately to the
formation of CO2, H2O and biomass (12).

Strategies to accelerate the biological breakdown of
hydrocarbons in soil include stimulation of the indigenous
microorganisms by optimizing the nutrients and oxygen supply
and the temperature and pH conditions (biostimulation), and
through inoculation of an enriched mixed microbial consortium
into soil (bioaugmentation). In addition to provide these

optimum conditions, it is also important to know that the
pollutant degradation in soil is influenced by mass transfer
phenomena. Providing a way to reduce the sorption of the
hydrophobic organic contaminants to the soil matrix can increase
the rate and extent of biodegradation (26). For this purpose, the
addition of surfactants into the soil aims to enhance the
emulsification of hydrocarbons and therefore they have the
potential to solubilize hydrocarbons and increase their
bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation (20,24,25,30).

In biological treatments it is always necessary to perform
laboratory feasibility tests to determine the microbial potential
to degrade the pollutants and to evaluate strategies to optimize
the degradation rates before the design of real scale in-situ or
ex-situ (bioreactors, landfarming and others) treatments. Thus,
the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible
methods to enhance the rate of aerobic biodegradation (ex-situ
treatments) of diesel oil in soil. In this work, the bioremediation
processes were applied to a sandy soil contaminated by the
leakage of an underground storage tank at a petrol station.
Biodegradation of diesel oil was performed using laboratory
scale experiments (Bartha biometer flasks). Enhancement of
biodegradation was carried out through biostimulation (addition
of nitrogen and phosphorus solutions and Tween 80 surfactant)
and bioaugmentation (treatment with inoculation of a bacterial
consortium isolated from a landfarming). To investigate
interactions between optimizing factors, and to find the right
combination of these agents, the study was based on full
factorial experimental design. Efficiency of biodegradation was
simultaneously measured by two methods: respirometric

(microbial CO2 production) and gas chromatography to evaluate
the biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH).
Acute toxicity tests with Daphnia similis were applied to
examine the efficiency of the processes in terms of the generation
of less toxic products. The results of this study aim to contribute
towards current demands for the development of new processes
able to reduce the time usually required for bioremediation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling and Soil characteristics
Contaminated sandy soil was obtained at a petrol station

where a leak in an underground storage tank released,
approximately ten years ago, a great amount of diesel oil into
the soil and sequentially to the groundwater. The sample was
collected from the capillary fringe (depth of 1.60 m) and stored
at 5ºC. Table 1 summarizes some physicochemical characteristics
of the soil. Concentrations of heavy metals are not above the
most restricted levels established by Cetesb (São Paulo
Environmental Agency – Brazil) and by the Dutch list (11).

Soil characterization. The physicochemical analyses were
performed by the laboratory “Instituto Campineiro de Análise
de Solo e Adubo (ICASA)”, according to the methodology
proposed by Embrapa (13), except the following parameters:
total nitrogen (laboratory “PIRASOLO - Laboratório
Agrotécnico Piracicaba”, according to Embrapa (13)); grain size
distribution (1) and the moisture content (obtained by the oven
drying method).

Determination of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)
content was carried out by the “Bioagri Ambiental” laboratory
by gas chromatography with the flame ionization detector (FID)
according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
methodology SW-846/8015.

Biodegradation experiments
Batch biodegradation experiments were carried out in Bartha

biometer flasks (250 mL) used to measure microbial CO2
production (6). The influence of three variables (nitrogen and
phosphorus content (NP), addition of surfactant (S) and bacterial
consortium (BC)) on the biodegradation of the pollutants
present in the soil was assessed using the full factorial
experimental design (23) as tool, resulting in 8 experimental
conditions (Table 2).

The soil sample was homogenized by a thorough mixing
and divided into 8 aliquots, in which the amendment solutions
of each treatment were added. The nitrogen and phosphorus
correction was performed using (NH4)2SO4 (6080 mg/kg of soil)
and KH2PO4 (973 mg/kg of soil) solutions, respectively. Thus
the nutrient ratio (C:N:P) was adjusted to 100:15:1 (8). The
bacterial inoculum and the non-ionic Tween 80 surfactant were
added at a concentration of 105 Colony Forming Units (CFU)
per gram of dry soil and 0.2% (m/m), respectively. Considering
the addition of amendments, the water content of the soil
changed to 21.9%.

The biometer flasks were prepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of
soil) and incubated at 27ºC in the dark for 55 days. Produced
CO2 was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of KOH (0.2 N), located in
the side-arm of the biometer. This solution was periodically
withdrawn by syringe, and the amount of carbon dioxide
absorbed was then measured by titrating the residual KOH (after
the addition of barium chloride solution (1 mL; 1.0 N) used to
precipitate the carbonate ions) with a standard solution of HCl

(0.1 N). During this procedure, the biometers were aerated during
1.5 minutes through the ascarite filters.

At the end of the experiment, the replicates of each treatment
were thoroughly mixed together for physicochemical,
microbiological and toxicity analyses. This procedure was
necessary to provide the necessary quantity of soil demanded
by the final analyses (without replicates).

The statistical analysis of the results (biodegradation
efficiency calculated from the CO2 quantification (3 replicates))
obtained through the experimental design conditions were
performed by the software STATISTICA (version 5.0) for
Windows. Significance was considered to be at the p&lt;0.05
probability level.

Inoculum preparation. The microbial inoculum consisted of
three oil-degrading bacteria (Ochrobactrum anthropi,
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacillus cereus) that were
previously isolated and identified by Kataoka (19) from a
landfarming at the Brazilian oil refinery Replan (Petrobras S/A).
The bacteria were grown separately in liquid PCA medium (10
mL), incubated for 48 h at 35ºC. Cells were harvested by
centrifugation (8,000 rpm for 10 min) and the supernatant medium
discharged. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 5.5
mL sterile saline solution (0.85%) and the same centrifugation
procedure was performed. The cell pellets were grouped and
the final cell suspension was prepared with the addition of 5.5
mL saline solution.

Counting of bacteria. Total heterotrophic bacteria were
numbered by using the pour plate technique on plate count
agar (Acumedia, USA). Plate count of the soil bacterial
population was performed as follows: samples of 1 g of soil
were added to 9 mL of 0.85% sterile saline solution in essay
tubes and agitated mechanically for 2 minutes. After appropriate
serial dilutions, 1 mL of the suspension was spread over the
surface of duplicate Petri dishes and incubated for 48 h at 35ºC.
At time zero, the count was performed to treatments 4 (soil +
BC), 8 (soil without amendments) and to inoculum suspension.
At the end of the experiments, the counting of bacteria was
performed for all treatments.

Acute toxicity tests. As a first step to evaluate the acute
toxicity, solubilization of the soil was carried out, according to
the ABNT Standard 10006 (2), in order to extract possible toxic
substances present in the soil. Then, the acute toxicity test was
performed on the extractor (water) using Daphnia similis as the
test organism, in accordance to the São Paulo Environmental
Agency Standard L5.018 (10). At time zero, the test was applied
to treatments 6, 7 and 8 (representative of the three amendments)
and at final time to all treatments. Results were calculated based
on the Trimmed Spearman-Karber statistical method (16) and
expressed as EC50, 48 h.

Biodegradation efficiency calculation. The carbon dioxide
analyses were used to estimate the total amount of hydrocarbons
mineralized during biodegradation experiments. Assuming that
50% of the biodegraded carbon is converted to CO2 and the
other 50% is added to the soil as humus and biomass (9), the
amount of biodegraded carbon can be expressed as:

Total biodegraded carbon (µmol) = 2 . CO2
produced (µmol)

(1)

And the biodegradation efficiency (BE) as:

BE% = (Total biodegraded carbon (µmol) /
initial soil organic carbon content (µmol) ). 100

(2)

The initial soil organic carbon content for each treatment
was determined through the carbon mass balance, i.e. by
subtracting the produced carbon as CO2 from the measured
final organic carbon content (13).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The cumulative total amounts of CO2 produced by the
treated soils over 55-day incubation period and the daily CO2
production are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. There
was not lag period in the treatments, probably due to a previous
adaptation of the microorganisms to the pollutants and favorable
experimental conditions. Comparing the average rate production
of CO2 obtained during the first 20 days with that one obtained
in the subsequent period (21-55th day), the average rate dropped
approximately 45% (for treatments 1; 3; 5 and 7) and 23% (for
treatments 2; 4; 6 and 8). This variation may be caused by a

transition of carbon sources. As the labile hydrocarbon sources
(probably linear and open-chain hydrocarbons) are consumed,
their bioavailability decreases. The shortage of these sources
forces the microorganisms to adapt to more recalcitrant sources
(probably aromatic hydrocarbons with higher molecular
weight), resulting in a decrease of the CO2 production. This
behavior was more evident in treatments with addition of
nutrients (treatments 1; 3; 5 and 7), what suggests that the
beneficial effect obtained with the nutrient addition is less
pronounced in the biodegradation of more recalcitrant sources,
as observed by Hencklein (17) studying the biodegradability of
refinery oily sludge.

Based on the CO2 production, the biodegradation efficiency
(BE) was calculated using Equation 2 (Fig. 3). The biodegradation
efficiency calculated using the CO2 data refers to the complete
transformation of the hydrocarbons to CO2 (mineralization). If
hydrocarbons are partially biodegraded, the quantification of
CO2 does not take into account these incomplete processes.
Treatments with nutrient amendment (1; 3; 5 and 7) clearly
showed the best results (up to 19.8%). In Fig. 4, the Pareto
Chart, obtained through the experimental design conditions,
represents the effects of the variables tested on the
biodegradation efficiency. Effects were considered statistically
significant for a 95% confidence level, represented by the dotted
line (p=0.05). Positive values in the Pareto Chart indicate that
the variable in question has a favorable effect on the pollutant
removal efficiency. The three variables isolated, and the
combination of nutrients and surfactant (1 by 2) influenced
positively the biodegradation process.

The relatively larger effect of the nutrients amendment
indicates that nutrient availability is an important limiting factor
for natural bioremediation of the contaminated soil considered
in this work. Biostimulation with addition of fertilizers (N and P)
has been reported as an important factor to enhance soil
bioremediation (14, 8). Nevertheless, some studies reveal that

the nitrogen and phosphorus correction may have no effect on
the decontamination (17,28), or even may represent an inhibitory
effect in the biodegradation process by excessive addition
(29,31). The nitrogen, when added as ammonium salts, can be
toxic to the microorganisms due to the ammonia generation in
the soil, which can be lethal in high concentrations and some
sources of phosphorus (phosphate and ortho-phosphate) may
present diverse effects on the biodegradation depending on
their toxicity and solubility (29). According to Walworth et al.
(31), the inhibitory levels of nitrogen range from 100 to 4000
mgN/Kg of soil. These values are not in agreement with the soil
adjustment of 2090 mgN/Kg carried out in this work.

Biostimulation with the addition of Tween 80 surfactant,
intended to increase the bioavailability of the hydrocarbons to

the microorganisms, also presented positive effects in the
biodegradation efficiency, mainly in the treatments (1 and 5)
where the nutrients (principal limiting factor to biodegradation)
had been adjusted. Studies concerning the use of surfactant in
bioremediation processes present results ranging from
stimulation to inhibition of desorption and biodegradation of
polluting compounds (30). In this work, the effects of the
surfactant on the physiology of the bacteria did not cause
inhibition of growth due to a possible surfactant intermediates
toxicity neither stimulation of growth caused by a possible use
of the surfactant as a co-substrate, since the average bacterial
population in treatments with surfactant was not statistically
(ANOVA analysis) different from the others.

Biodegradation rates enhancement using the Tween 80
surfactant was also obtained by Kataoka (19), Xie (32) and
Mueller et al. (1991) apud Rouse et al. (27). According to Zheng
and Obbard (33), Tween 80 is a biodegradable polyxyethylene
surfactant and its fate and toxicity in the environment is not of
scientific concern. However, Hencklein (17) observed negative
effects when applied this surfactant, which may have increased
the availability of more toxic compounds present in the refinery
oily sludge.

The bioaugmentation with bacterial consortium isolated from
a landfarming was the variable that had the smaller positive
effect in the biodegradation rates. Comparing treatments 1 and
5, it is possible to observe that the presence of the bacterial
consortium in treatment 1 clearly improved the biodegradation
efficiency. This positive effect is also noticeable in the final
plate count of the bacterial soil population of this treatment,
which showed the higher value of all treatments (Fig. 6), but the
average bacterial population in treatments with biaugmentation
was not statistically (ANOVA analysis) different from the others,
which may be a possible evidence of the poor effect of this
variable. Some works reported that inoculation had no positive,
or only marginal effects on hydrocarbon biodegradation rates
(4,5,22). Microorganisms able to degrade organic pollutants in
cultures may fail to function when inoculated into natural
environments, because they may be susceptible to toxins or
predators in the environment. They may use other organic
compounds in preference to the pollutant, or they may be unable
to move through the soil to the contaminated site. The successful
use of microbial inocula in soils requires that the microorganisms
contact the contaminant. Physical adsorption to soil particles
or filtration through small pores may limit the transport of
organisms (23). In some studies, the bioaugmentation of the
bacterial population already present in the soil have achieved
the best performance in diesel oil degradation in soil (7).

In terms of TPH removal (Fig. 5), results showed similar
behavior to respirometric data, i.e. better treatments were
obtained with fertilizer in combination with another amendments.
Removal efficiency was clearly influenced positively by these
combinations, since treatments without combination (4; 6 and

respirometric data. Each error bar represents 1 SD of three
replicate experiments.

7) achieved results even worst than treatment 8 (without
amendments). The best total TPH (sum of all ranges) removal
efficiency of 57.8% in treatment 3 did not correspond to the
treatment with higher mineralization degree (treatment 1). This
fact indicates differences in the metabolic routes between the
microbiota present in treatments 1 and 3. In the latter, certainly,
a greater part of the hydrocarbons was transformed, however,
not achieving the maximum degree of biodegradation (CO2
production). Moreover, the difference of CO2 production
between treatments 1 and 3 may also be increased by the
presence of Tween 80, a biodegradable surfactant (33). In relation
to the TPH fractions, there were no significant differences
between biodegradation of light and heavy hydrocarbons as
observed by Bento et al. (7).

Marchal et al. (21) report that many studies performed
with soil microcosms had incomplete degradation of diesel
oil. The partial TPH biodegradation obtained in this work
(57.8%) in 55 days of treatment is in agreement with the results
obtained by Bento et al. (7) that achieved in 84 days a TPH
removal of approximately 75% with similar bioremediation
strategies.

In Fig. 6 is represented the plate count of the bacterial soil
population performed before and after treatments. In most
treatments, the microbial populations at the end of the experiment
were approximately 2 to 30 times greater than the initial cell
densities. The number of heterotrophic population was not
influenced by the bioremediation treatments (ANOVA analysis),
as well observed by Bento et al. (7). Hickman and Novak (18)
concluded that total microbial biomass was a poor predictor for
determining biodegradation potential mainly because the active
biomass may differ in species composition and in metabolic
regimes.

At the bacterial plate count performed after treatments, the
dominance of two cultures, differing by the colour (white and
yellow), was observed in terms of numbers of CFU. These cultures
were isolated and identified by 16S rDNA sequencing (analysis
performed by CPQBA/UNICAMP). The white cultures were
classified as Staphylococcus hominis and the yellow as Kocuria
palustris, both gram-positive cocci. These species have not been
previously reported in soil contaminated by hydrocarbons.
However, Gomes et al. (15) isolated Staphylococcus aureus from
samples of heavy oil.

Table 3 shows the values of pH and nitrogen and phosphorus
consumption at the end of the treatments. The pH values in
treatments without nutrient addition increased (in comparison
to the initial value of 6.7). According to Rhaman et al. (25), an
increase in pH suggests the release of by-products during
hydrocarbon degradation. This behavior was not observed in
treatments with nutrients addition because the (NH4)2SO4
fertilizer increases the soil acidity. None of the final pH values is
harmful to biological activity.

Mariano, A.P. et al.

In relation to the nutrients, the values of the N consumption
suggest a possible correlation between this nutrient and the
biodegradation efficiency (respirometric data) and the low
consumption of P in treatments without nutrient adjustment
suggests that this element, when in low quantities, was not
available for the bacterial population.

The results obtained with the acute toxicity tests are listed
in Table 4. Initially, only treatments with nutrients addition
presented some toxicity and at final time the treatments showed
different levels of toxicity independently of amendments and of
biodegradation efficiency achieved. From this observation, it is
reasonable to reject any toxic effect derived from the fertilizers
and from the Tween 80 surfactant. Since the test was based on
extracting the pollutants using water, the majority of the initial
hydrocarbons, that have low solubility constant, was poorly
transferred to the water. Thus, a possible explanation for the
toxicity increase during the microbial conversion of
hydrocarbons is the formation of intermediates (probably
organic acids) with higher water solubility.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Bioremediation strategies to enhance the biodegradation of
diesel oil in soil showed satisfactory results. During 55 days of
treatment, amendments roughly doubled the biodegradation
efficiency in terms of mineralization (19.8%) with a TPH removal
of 45.5% when all amendments were added. The shortage of
nutrients was the principal limiting factor of the process and
the increase in biodegradation efficiency with the Tween 80
surfactant suggests that this product was effective in providing
bioavailability. The minimal effect of the bioaugmentation with
non indigenous bacteria was in agreement with other studies
that recommend their use in case of more recalcitrant chemicals
or when the local microbial population is insufficient or
inadequate.

RESUMO

Estudo laboratorial da biorremediação de solo de posto
de combustíveis contaminado com óleo diesel

O objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar possíveis
métodos para aumentar a taxa de biodegradação aeróbia de
hidrocarbonetos (tratamentos ex-situ). Neste trabalho,
processos de biorremediação foram aplicados a um solo arenoso
com alto nível de contaminação ocasionada por um vazamento
de um tanque de armazenamento de óleo diesel subterrâneo em
um posto de combustíveis. Experimentos em escala laboratorial
(respirômetros de Bartha) foram utilizados para avaliar a
biodegradação do óleo diesel. Estímulo da biodegradação foi
realizado utilizando-se as técnicas de bioestímulo (adição de
soluções de nitrogênio e fósforo ou surfactante Tween 80) e de
bioaumento (consórcio bacteriano isolado de um sistema de
landfarming). Para investigar as interações entre os fatores
otimizadores, e encontrar a melhor combinação entre esses
agentes, o estudo foi baseado em um delineamento experimental
fatorial completo. A eficiência de biodegradação foi
simultaneamente medida com dois métodos: respirométrico
(produção de CO2 microbiano) e cromatografia gasosa. Testes
de toxicidade aguda com Daphnia similis foram aplicados para
examinar a eficiência dos processos em termos de geração de
produtos menos tóxicos. Resultados mostraram que todas as
estratégias de biorremediação aceleraram a biorremediação
natural do solo contaminado e os melhores resultados foram
obtidos quando os tratamentos tinham adição de nutrientes.
Dados respirométricos indicaram uma máxima mineralização de
hidrocarbonetos de 19,8%, obtida com a combinação dos três
agentes, com uma remoção de hidrocarbonetos totais de
petróleo (TPH) de 45,5% em 55 dias de tratamento. No final dos
experimentos, duas espécies predominantes de bactéria foram
isoladas e identificadas como Staphylococcus hominis e
Kocuria palustris.
