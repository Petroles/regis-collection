ABSTRACT – This experiment viewed to evaluate the physiological quality of grain sorghum seeds 
as well as to determine the respective drying curve of each of three drying methods.  The seeds 
harvested at 18.9%, 18.1%, and 18.2% of moisture content were submitted to the following drying 
methods : a) under natural conditions, b) an intermittent dryer in which the combustion of firewood 
was the source of caloric energy, and c) a stationary dryer in which the source of caloric energy 
was the burning of liquefied petroleum gas. The experimental design was a completely randomized 
one with 25 repetitions of one hundred seeds each. The water contents and weight of one thousand 
seeds were evaluated. Seeds physiological quality was evaluated by germination and vigor tests. Seed 
drying rates were of 0.11, 1.25, and 0.55 percent points per hour (pph -1) for the natural, intermittent 
and stationary drying methods, respectively. The intermittent treatment permits the highest loss of 
water in the shortest period of time, and germination and vigor remaining unchanged.

Index terms: natural drying, artificial dryer, drying speed, germination, vigor.

INTRODucTION

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench) is a very 
important crop worldwide, and today is the fifth most 
cultivated cereal in the world (EMBRAPA, 2005). In 
Brazil, sorghum was re-introduced in 1970, specially in 
western zones of the South region. Sorghum areas were then 
expanded, from the mid 1990’s onwards, as an alternative to 
soybean. The repercussion was so significant that the demand 
for regular seed volumes stimulated producers, industry 
and researchers to work together in search for new hybrids 
(CONAB, 2004).

Sorghum grains should be harvested when moisture 
content is between 18 and 20%. Seeds within this moisture 
range have to be dried in order to reduce moisture contents 
to values between 12 and 13%, since high moisture contents 
are the main reason behind losses in germination and vigor, 
(Mantovani, 2003). Natural or artificial drying methods may 
be chosen, depending on characteristics of each species, 
the amount of harvested seeds, and on weather conditions 
prevailing after seeds were harvested.

Natural seed drying is directly dependent on weather 
conditions. The disadvantage of the method lies in the 
need for intensive human labor, which in turn leads to poor 
operational performance. Nevertheless, whether conducted 
directly under de sun or in the shade, natural drying is very 
important in seed production, as it brings about consistent, 
homogeneous post-harvest seed maturation (Berti et al., 
2005).

Artificial drying methods are more often used, and 
are more easily adaptable to seed production techniques, 
affording fast and efficient removal of large amounts of 
moisture (Carvalho, 1994). Mechanical drying techniques 
may be used with the assistance of mechanical, electric or 
electronic equipment, in which air is forced through the seed 
mass. These methods afford the maintenance of seed quality, 
when conducted under technical criteria that define exposure 
times and temperatures (Ahrens et al., 2000). According to 
Cavarini et al. (1998), the main advantages of the artificial 
method are to allow the control of the temperature, the drying 
air flux, and the exposure time of the seeds to the heated air, 
fundamental factors to assure the efficiency of the process.

Several factors have to be considered when choosing 
between seed drying methods. These aspects include seed 
volumes effectively harvested, harvest speed, drying time, 
energy consumption, end purpose of seeds, apart from 
human-related aspects like technological knowledge and 
purchase power of the producer. Nevertheless, the specific 
characteristics of each product harvested as seen in the light 
of the heat transfer technique adopted may determine the best 
drying method to be used, with minimal damage to physical 

and physiological seed quality (Maia, 1995).
This study aimed to evaluate the performance of some 

seed drying methods in terms of physiological quality of 
grain sorghum seeds.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Grain sorghum seeds (cultivar DKB 599, Dekalb), were 
provided by São Domingos Seed Commerce. Seeds were 
produced in the Lagoão district, municipality of Pantano 
Grande, state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, at 126 
km from Porto Alegre. The experiment comprised three 
drying treatments: a) drying under natural conditions,  b) 
an intermittent dryer whose source of caloric energy was 
firewood, and c) a stationary dryer provided  with a perforated 
bottom in which the source of caloric energy was petroleum 
liquefied gas.

In the natural drying method, sorghum seeds 
were harvested on 03/17/2005 and transported to the 
Agrometeorological and Forage Crops Department of the 
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The 
drying procedure started on the next day and lasted 7 days 
(56 h). Seed mass weight was 300 kg, with 18.9% baseline 
moisture content. Seeds were initially sieved in a 4 mm mesh 
screen and subsequently spread as five piles of 60 kg each, 
with 10 cm thick layers spaced at 0.5m intervals under direct 
sunlight across an 8m2 concrete floor previously covered 
with woven propylene bags. Exposure time was 8 h a day 
with hourly upturns. Moisture measurements were carried 
out three times a day (at 9 am, 2 pm, and 5 pm) using a 
digital grain moisture meter Multi Grain. The average solar 
radiation observed during the drying period, measured by the 
Hydraulic Research Institute/UFRGS was 375.22 cal.cm-2.
day-1. After reaching the final moisture content of 12.6%, 25 
1.5 kg samples were collected, transferred to paper bags, and 
sent to the Seed Analysis Laboratory.

In the intermittent drying process, two driers of 
intermittent and slow seed flow (IMPASA 90) were used. 
The static capacity of each drier was of 5,400 kg. The static 
load of the drying chamber (cross-flow, tray type) was of 
10,800 kg of seeds. Seeds were lifted in a 10 m high grain 
elevator equipped with scoops and driven by a 2 HP engine. 
The system was supplied with a firewood combustion furnace 
and a 2,700 kg wooden bag silo. On 04/01/2005, 10,800 kg 
seeds with approximate of 18.1% moisture were harvested 
and sent to Engenho Moinhos, Pantano Grande, RS, where 
the seeds were discharged into a hopper and transported by 
the elevator to an air screen separator to reduce impurities 
as well as get some reduction in seed moisture content. 
After that, the seeds were transported to the drier previously 
adjusted to a 67 m3.min-1.ton-1 airflow, with initial air 



179DRYING OF GRAIN SORGHUM SEEDS

temperature of 50.3°C and maximum temperature of 60.3°C, 
and an intermittence ratio of 1:4. Temperature and relative 
humidity were measured every hour with thermometers (rod 
and probe). Likewise, grain moisture content was monitored 
every hour by digital grain moisture meter Multi Grain. 
When seeds reached the final moisture content of 12.3%, 25 
1.5 kg samples were collected, transferred to paper bags, and 
transported to the Seed Analysis Laboratory.

The stationary drying process used two driers 
models, both equipped with gas burners (Baron – circular; 
Bandeirante – rectangular), each with a static load of 2,700 
kg and a height of 1.50 m. The assembly operated in the 
Post Harvest Technology Center of de UFRGS, in the 
municipality of Eldorado do Sul, RS. On 05/03/2005, 5,400 
kg of sorghum seeds with 18.2% of  moisture were harvested 
and, in the same day, transported to the driers. Because the 
drying method was processed from the base to the surface 
of the seeds, three layers were formed: a layer with dried 
seeds (a), a transition layer (b),  and a layer with humid seeds 
(c). From each layer samples were collected and brought to 
the Seed Analysis Laboratory. Temperatures and relative 
humidities of the seed mass drying air flow were monitored 
with a digital thermometer Dry Eration, with thermocouples 
installed in the holes on the sides of the drier and of the 
plenum. Seed moisture content was measured using the 
digital grain moisture meter Multi Grain, at 1-h intervals 
throughout the drying process (Table 4).

Drying rate of seeds was calculated dividing the 
percentage of water removed from seeds by the hour count 
of the drying process. Drying curves were determined by 
adjusting the curve considering the change in seed moisture 

content and the length of the drying process.
In order to evaluate the physical and physiological quality 

of the seeds, the following tests were conducted: Moisture 
content - determined after the initial cleaning using a digital 
meter Multi Grain Wild in 100-g samples analyzed in 
triplicate, with results expressed in percentage; Purity test 
- conducted with 25 samples of each drying method, which 
were sieved three times and forced through a seed blower for 
3 min (De Leo model South Dakota), with an opening set 
at 6.5 cm; Germination test - carried out over paper as 25 
repetitions of 100 seeds each, in square plastic containers (11 
x 11 x 3 cm) placed in a germination chamber at a constant 
temperature of 25°C, for 10 days. The results were expressed 
as percentage of normal seedlings (Brazil, 1992); Weight 
of 1000 seeds – it was determined by weighing 8 samples 
of 100 seeds retrieved from the mass of pure seeds from the 
purity analysis, according to Brazil (1992); first count - the 
record of the percentage of normal seedlings as determined 
four days after the beginning of the test.

This experiment was set according to a completely 
random design. The data obtained were statistically analyzed 
by the Duncan test to compare means, at the 5% level of 
probability.

RESuLTS AND DIScuSSION

The moisture content: drying time ratio of sorghum seeds 
for the three drying methods is represented by a quadratic 
function. Seed drying occurred at a decreasing ratio, growing 
slower with time (Figure 1).

The analysis of the drying curves illustrates that the 
removal of moisture from seeds was slower in the natural 
method, and faster in the artificial drying methods (Figure 1). 
Apart from the method, several other factors added to these 
differences, such as: exposure times to drying air (heated or 
not), drying air temperature (high or low), relative humidity 
in the site (modified or not), drying air flow (natural or 
forced), and the speed with which moisture migrated from 
the inner seed structures to its surface. These observations 
are in accordance with the studies by Teixeira et al. (1980). 
Yet, Brooker et al. (1981) categorically state that drying 
depends basically on relative humidity and on airflow.

The natural drying process was slower due to the 
limitations the method imposes, with 56 h needed for the 
seeds to have their moisture reduced from 18.92% to 12.58% 
(7 days, 8h/day) (Figure 1, Table 1). The seeds averaged 
a loss of approximately 0.11 pph-1 (0.90% per 8-h day) 
(Table 2), with drying speed totally dependent on weather 
conditions. In this drying treatment, moisture loss observed 
from the 1st to the 3rd day (24h, 8h/day) was considerable, 
due to the more favorable weather conditions, but lesser 
from the 4th to the 7th day (32 h, 8h/day). For the first period, 
mean moisture loss was around 0.20pph-1, and for the second 
period 0.04pph-1. Generally speaking, temperature varied 
considerably throughout the day, and also during the whole 
drying process. The fast initial desorption (up to the 3rd day) 
only occurred at higher air temperatures (26.6°C on the 
average), 65% relative humidity, and an airflow speed close 
to 2.47 m.s-1.  The low drying rate in natural drying process 
may be harmful to the seeds. Under these drying conditions, 
microorganisms may develop, as moisture takes longer to 
be removed, apart from the fact that seeds hold moisture for 
longer than advisable. Thus, the seed mass temperature may 
change, with acceleration in respiration which causes a CO2 
release and water vapor, besides the consumption of reserves. 
This may cause a significative decrease in the physiological 
quality of seeds, although this  was not verified in this work 
(Table 5).

In the intermittent drying method, the time needed to 
reduce seed moisture from 17.3% to 12.3% was of 4 h. This 
represented a mean moisture loss rate of 1.25 pph-1 (Tables 2 
and 3). Seeds dried by the intermittent method lost moisture 
more quickly than the other methods. This result may be 
explained in the light of the combination of several factors: a) 
method used; b) shorter exposure time of seeds in the drying 
chamber and to air flow; c) adjustments in air temperature, in 
relative humidity, and in air flow; d) synchronicity between 
exposure time inside the drying chamber and equalization 

time (1:4); and e) uniformization and dissipation of heat inside 
the bag silo. The initial drying temperature of 50.3°C was 
adjusted throughout the process, but never surpassed 60.3°C. 
The temperature of the seed mass was around 43°C (Table 
3). The airflow, defined as 67 m3.min-1.ton-1 for each dryer, 
was within the limits established by Millmann (2002) (32.84 
m3.min-1.ton-1 and 72.44 m3.min-1.ton-1), which is enough to 
remove moisture from the system. The temperature rise in the 
drying air diminished relative humidity, and thus increased 
the capacity of the drying air to remove seed moisture when 
the seed mass was exposed to insufflated air (cross-flow), 
which was subsequently removed from the system, almost 
saturated with humidity. Intermittent drying allowed to adopt 
higher air temperatures, as compared to the other methods, 
without excessively increasing the temperature of seeds due 
to the equalization period, as observed in our results (Table 
3). In this treatment, seed upturn greatly influenced drying 
speed, and was intended to ensure that drying occurred 
evenly. This made easier the flow of the drying air against the 
low static pressure, thus increasing drying speed, as verified 
by the decrease of 1 pp at every turn.

In stationary drying, the time needed to reduce moisture 
from 18.2% to 13.2% was 9 h (Tables 2 and 4). The seed 
temperature was around 25ºC (beginning) and moisture 
content was 18.3%. After 5 h of drying, the seed mass 
temperature was 47.1ºC and seed moisture content was 14%. 
After this period, the cooling process and the uniformization 
of moisture content by cross-flowing air was started and after 
a 4 h period the seed temperature was 24.2ºC and moisture 
content was 13.1%.

The stationary drying method resulted in three different 
layers, a, b, and c, that is, a layer with dried seeds, a transition 
layer and a layer with humid seeds, respectively.  Drying 
speed was higher in layer a, due to the fact that seeds were 
directly exposed for a longer period to the airflow, causing 
a larger reduction in seeds moisture content. In the other 
layers (b and c), the seeds final moisture content was higher, 
requiring longer drying periods. Seed mass temperatures in 
the layer a and in part of the transition zone were above the 
recommended values (Table 4). These two layers are located 
near the air inlet, and thus dry more quickly, showing the 
fastest desorption rates. Hence the importance of knowing 
the maximum time span allowed for drying, to prevent 
temperature from rising above recommended limits. The 
efficiency of this method depends on the duct architecture, 
the air flux, and the physical characteristics of the protective 
cover of the seeds, the volume and architecture of the porous 
spaces and uniformity of the seed mass (Moraes, 2000).

TABLE 5. Moisture content, purity,  germination, first count and weight of a thousand seeds (WTS) results of grain 
sorghum seeds submitted to three drying methods.

Means followed by the same letter in one column indicate values that do not differ statistically (Duncan test; P&lt;0.05).

The natural drying method resulted in seed germination 
and vigor values lower than those observed when the drying 
method was the intermittent one (Table 5). In natural drying, 
the factors that may have led to reductions in germination 
are thought to be more closely related to the method itself 
and to the influence of weather conditions. Apart from these, 
other aspects may have influenced the results, such as: a) the 
low air flow (controlled by air speed),  b) the low heating 
power of the source,  c) the dissipation of the caloric energy 
distributed across the system, which probably reduced 
drying efficiency,  and d) the low drying speed may have 
maintained the respiration rate at high levels. This takes up 
energy reserves, and partly affects germination and vigor, 
due to the fact that bound water remains for longer periods 
inside the seed, which in turn produces gases and vapor in the 
intergranular space. Periodic upturning of seeds helped tone 
the situation down, as it homogenizes seeds and increases 
the time seeds are exposed to the drying conditions. In spite 
of its limitations, natural drying is still widely adopted in 
agriculture for being cheaper, directly or indirectly, specially 
for smaller seed volumes, as pointed out by Naum (2004). In 
the state of Rio Grande do Sul, natural drying is extensively 
chosen to dry seeds of forage species, such as rye grass (Maia, 
1995), specially in times and places affected by sudden rains. 
Due to the low local heat capacity (375.22 cal.cm-2.day-1) and 
to the low drying speed under the natural drying conditions, 
seeds were not submitted to very high temperatures. So, 
seeds apparently did not suffer any physical damage, though 
the drying method imposed a reasonable reduction in 
germination rate and in vigor (physiological aspect) (Table 
5). Apart from this, the method is inadequate due to the 
psychrometric conditions of the air, which lead to longer 
drying times, as observed in the present study.

The intermittent drying method resulted in seeds of 
higher germination and vigor (Table 5). This is explained by 
several factors, such as: a) the conduction of a pre cleaning 
stage which consisted in the elimination of large sized inert 
material and this resulted in a seed moisture drop of 1 pp,  

b) the high drying air flow, which afforded higher moisture 
removal rates,  c) lowest exposure time of seeds to air 
temperature in the drying chamber,  d) good synchronicity 
between drying time and equalization, which increases drying 
speed,  and e) seed upturn. As this method was designed to 
eliminate part of the heat used together with the moisture and 
to release it out of the system, the physiological quality of 
seeds was not really diminished, as seeds are dried in a series 
of short drying times interrupted by longer resting times.

In terms of germination and vigor, the performance of 
the stationary drying method was worse than that of the 
intermittent one, although it did not differ from the natural 
drying (Table 5). Some factors may have contributed to 
this result, such as: the absence of initial pre-cleaning; the 
difficulty to remove moisture from the farthest layers (b and 
c), even at top air flow, due to the static pressure and to the 
characteristics of the sorghum seeds; seed mass remained 
exposed to drying air for too long, which led to overdrying 
of the (a) and (b) layers thus resulting in  lower germination 
rates and vigor. The low vigor value of these seeds may 
be explained by the relationship between exposure time, 
temperature, thickness of layers, and seed structure, all of 
which are aspects that led to losses in seed quality due to 
injury. The interaction of these several factors contributed 
to the unevenness observed in drying speed inside the seed 
mass, which affected physiological quality and determined 
lower germination rate and lessened germination of seeds 
(first count). Specially in the (a) and (b) layers, the seed mass 
temperatures maintained above 43 °C for 4 h have probably 
reduced the quality (impaired germination and vigor). This 
finding confirms that it is not advisable to use values above 
those recommended by research, though the germination test 
did in fact produce satisfactory results.

The analysis of variance for the weight of 1000 seeds 
revealed statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between 
drying procedures. Natural drying of seeds resulted in lower 
weight, as compared to intermittent drying, but higher as 
compared to stationary drying (Table 5). The low weight of

seeds following stationary drying may be ascribed to the fact 
that in this method seeds were more exposed to the flow or 
drying air which led to overdrying and, as a result, to a higher 
energy expenditure of the seed, seen in the uptake of energy 
reserves (Maia, 1995). Conversely, in the intermittent drying, 
the higher weights observed are related to the intermittence 
ratio, that is, the shorter exposure time in the drier coupled to 
the longer equalization time.

Yet, the improved technical efficiency observed in 
the three drying methods is related to practical issues and 
availability of use, to the adaptation of the method to the 
drying process, and to the compatibility in terms of industrial 
automation, as reported by Millman (2002).

Considering the importance of seed drying, alternative 
drying methods should be the object of constant research. 
For instance, the combination of the methods discussed, and 
the replacement of expensive fuels by cheaper alternatives to 
decrease environmental degradation, as well as improvements 
in the existing systems. These improvements are expected to 
increase drying speed, reduction of drying costs and a more 
efficient conservation of environment resources.

Seed drying is a complex subject, and very often 
drying available facilities are those made possible by the 
circumstances, not the ideal ones. In many cases, drying 
methods are conducted outside the specifications defined, 
so that the seed treatment unit as a whole may maximize 
performance, at minimal losses.

cONcLuSIONS

The use of intermittent dryer method to dry sorghum 
seeds has afforded higher moisture removal in a shorter 
period of time, and resulted in seeds of higher germination 
and vigor.

The low drying speed of sorghum seeds as observed in 
natural drying is influenced by the limitations imposed by the 
method, which led to slow desorption and determined a very 
long drying curve, contributing to lower seeds physiological 
quality.

The used layer thickness, exposure time, and the air flow 
in the stationary dryer affect negatively the physiological 
quality of sorghum seeds, as compared to the intermittent 
method.
