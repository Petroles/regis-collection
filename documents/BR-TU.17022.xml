ABSTRACT

HUSSAIN, S. M. Simulation of groundwater flow by the analytic element method. 2017.

Groundwater studies face computational limitations when providing local detail within regional
models. The researchers are concentrated on applying the numerical models to minimize the
difference between the physical reality and the implemented numerical model by considering
the minimum computational cost. This work consists of the study of line-elements (such as
line-doublets, circles, polygons, fractures) using the Analytic Element Method (AEM) for
groundwater flow. In this work, we consider the study of two-dimensional groundwater flow in
fractured porous media by the Analytic Element Method. We develop a numerical solution based
on a series expansion for a problem with more than one fracture. Each fracture has an influence
that can be expanded in a series that satisfies Laplace’s equation exactly. In the series expansion,
the unknown coefficients are obtained from the discharge potentials of all other elements that are
related to the expansion coefficients. Sizes, locations and conductivities for all inhomogeneities
are selected arbitrarily. This work also discusses a matrix method obtained by imposing the
intern boundary conditions for the Analytic Element Method. The convergence analysis of a
Gauss-Seidel type iterative method is also discussed.

Keywords: Analytic Element Method, Fractures, Groundwater Flow, Matrix Method, Numerical
Simulations.





RESUMO

HUSSAIN, S. M. Simulação do escoamento de água subterrânea pelo método de elemento
analítico. 2017. 135 p. Tese (Doutorado em Ciências – Ciências de Computação e Matemática

Estudos de águas subterrâneas enfrentam limitações computacionais ao fornecer detalhes locais
em modelos regionais. Os pesquisadores estão concentrados na aplicação dos modelos numé-
ricos para minimizar a diferença entre a realidade física e o modelo numérico implementado
considerando o custo computacional mínimo. Este trabalho consiste no estudo de elementos de
linha (como line-doublets, círculos, polígonos, fraturas) usando o Método de Elemento Analítico
(AEM) para o fluxo de águas subterrâneas. Neste trabalho, consideramos o estudo do fluxo
bidimensional de águas subterrâneas em meios porosos fraturados pelo Método dos Elementos
Analíticos. Desenvolvemos uma solução numérica baseada em uma expansão em série para um
problema com mais de uma fratura. Cada fratura tem uma influência que pode ser expandida em
uma série que satisfaça exatamente a equação de Laplace. Na expansão da série, os coeficientes
desconhecidos são obtidos a partir dos potenciais de descarga de todos os outros elementos
que estão relacionados aos coeficientes de expansão. Tamanhos, locais e condutividades para
todas as não-homogeneidades são arbitrariamente selecionados. Este trabalho também discute
o método da matriz obtido impondo as condições de contorno do interno para o Método do
Elemento Analítico. A análise de convergência de um método iterativo tipo Gauss-Seidel também
é discutida.

Palavras-chave: Método do Elemento Analítico, Fracturas, Escoamento de Águas Subterrâneas,

INTRODUCTION

The Analytic Element Method (AEM) was developed by Otto D. L. Strack in 1989, it is
a numerical method used for the solution of partial differential equations modelling groundwater
problems. The method is based on the principle of superposition. It uses the exact solution
of the governing equations for basic fundamental features of the aquifer, such as a well, a
river, an impermeable barrier, a sink, called Analytic Elements, and combines such solutions by
superposition to approximate the solution of a much more complex real problem. The solutions
to the governing equation obtained by AEM will be exact, but the boundary conditions will be
satisfied only approximately. It does not require the specific domain to be discretized giving rise
to a grid, only the boundary conditions at infinity and the internal conditions at certain points are
required (MARIN, 2011).

Problems in groundwater flow have been an area of active research for the past few
decades. Researchers working in these areas strived along the years for developing different
numerical methods using the governing equations of the physical phenomena (MARIN, 2011;
STRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA, 1995). To model groundwater systems, mathematical representa-
tions are used. Modelling plays an important role, and is the most effective method to make such
estimations involving complexities and uncertainties which model the behaviour of the aquifer.
Numerical modelling is a practical tool for understanding complex phenomena and obtaining
information. The implementation of the numerical models is usually made on a computer, that
can lead to errors, such as truncation and approximation. In recent years, researchers concen-
trated on developing numerical models with low computational cost for the required problems
minimizing the difference between the physical reality and the implemented numerical model
(MARIN, 2011). However, one of the major difficulties to be overcome in flow of groundwater
is the problem of fractures, that has received much attention.

The problem of fractured media is complex, and difficult to obtain experimental data
(MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989). Usual groundwater simulation codes use finite element and
finite difference methods, which though capable of simulating fracture flow phenomena, suffers



30 Chapter 1. Introduction

from drawbacks such as difficulties with scale differences, dependence on domain discretization,
mesh generation and solution approximations (WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002). We
shall introduce the Analytic Element Method which is more suitable for solving the problems of
large aquifers due to computational costs.

The main objective of this work is to study AEM for an array of fractures and other
elements like line-doublets, circular inhomogeneities. The numerical solution is based on series
expansion for the solution that satisfy the governing equation exactly. The principle of superposi-
tion is then used to linearly combine the solutions with unknown coefficients. These coefficients
are then found by solving a linear system. The study of efficient numerical methods for solving
the linear system and the convergence analysis of a Gauss-Seidel type iterative method are the
main contributions of this work.

This work is organized as follows: Chapter 2 consists of some basic concepts for obtaining
the governing equations. Chapter 3 consists of the methodology for solving the problems that
is based on the Analytic Element Method. Chapter 4 consists of the problems of circular
inhomogeneities. Chapter 5 consists of the problems of fractures. Chapter 6 consists of the
problems of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-elements called line-doublets and their
comparison with the exact solutions of a circular inhomogeneity and a fracture. Chapter 7
consists of solution algorithm. Chapter 8 consists of results and its discussion. Chapter 9 consists
of conclusion and Chapter 10 consists of future work.

BASIC EQUATIONS

This chapter presents some basic equations of groundwater flow based on (STRACK,
1989).

Specific discharge: The volume of water flowing through a unit area of soil per unit time is
called the specific discharge or discharge, represented by q and is given by:

q =
Q
A
, (2.1)

with unit of [q] =
[Q]
[A]

=
m3/s
m2

= m/s, where Q denotes the total volume of water per second and

A denotes the cross-sectional area.

Velocity: The average velocity at a certain point of a porous medium is known as seepage
velocity or velocity. It is obtained through the division of the specific discharge by the fraction
of voids present in a unit area of the porous medium. The unit of velocity is also [m/s] and is
represented by v , that is:

v =
q
n
, (2.2)

where n shows the porosity of the medium, which is a constant.

For understanding the concept of specific discharge and seepage velocity, consider the
water flowing through a horizontal cylindrical tube which is filled with water and sand and is
placed in the space between the ends with caps 1 and 2 (represented by dotted lines in Figure 1).
The cylinder is also connected with two reservoirs I and II having different water levels. The
water will flow through the cylinder because of the difference in water levels. To maintain its
level, the water must be poured into reservoir I and the level of reservoir II is controlled by the
overflow. To measure the rate at which the water is poured into reservoir I, first we need to know
the total amount of water Q flowing through the cylinder per unit time. The specific discharge



32 Chapter 2. Basic Equations

of water is obtained through the division of Q by the cross-sectional area of the cylinder A
(STRACK, 1989).

Figure 1 – Schematic of Darcy’s experiment

Using eq. (2.1), the seepage velocity becomes:

v =
q
n
=

Q
nA

. (2.3)

The seepage velocity is also used to find the average time t for a water particle to travel through
the sample. If L is the length of the sample, then the time t is obtained using the following
relation (STRACK, 1989):

vt = L (2.4)

or

t =
L
v
=

LnA
Q

. (2.5)

Pressure: From the weight of the water column above a point P in a standpipe, we can find the
pressure of water at point P , whose unit is [N/m2] and is given by:

p = ? g(? ? Z). (2.6)

Consider that the elevation of P above the reference level is Z, then the height of the water
column above P is ? ? Z, where, the density of water is denoted by ? [kg/m3] and acceleration
of gravity is denoted by g[m/s2] .

Head: At a certain point P in a soil body, the hydraulic head is defined as the level to which the
water rises in an open standpipe as shown in Figure 2. The unit of head is [m] and is denoted by
? , which is given by:

? =
p

? g
+ Z. (2.7)

Therefore the head equals to the sum of the pressure head p/? g whose unit is (N/m2)/(N/m3) or
[m] and the elevation head Z.

2.1 Darcy’s Law

In 1856, the French engineer Darcy conducted an experiment from which he determined
an empirical relation for the specific discharge in terms of the heads. The original form of this
law is only applicable to rectilinear flow of a homogeneous liquid (STRACK, 1989).

2.1.1 Rectilinear Flow

Darcy’s experiment consisted of a cylinder of sand having cross-sectional area A with
two ends having cap 1 with head ?1 and cap 2 with head ?2. From the experiment he concluded
that the amount of flow through a cylinder of sand increases linearly with the difference in head
at the ends of the sample as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 – Darcy’s experiment

Source: Strack (2014).

From this picture it can be seen that the pipe connecting reservoir I to the sample can be
viewed as a standpipe. Using information from Figure 3, Darcy’s law is given by the following



34 Chapter 2. Basic Equations

equation as presented in (STRACK, 1989; BEAR, 2013).

Q = KA
(

?1 ? ?2
L

)
, (2.8)

where K is a constant known as the hydraulic conductivity. The dimensions of K are those of
velocity [m/s], Q is the discharge [m3/s], A is the cross-sectional area of the sample [m2] and L
is the length of the sample [m].

In terms of the specific discharge q using eq. (2.1), eq. (2.8) becomes:

q = K
(

?1 ? ?2
L

)
. (2.9)

By measuring the head at various points inside the sample along the x-axis, it appears to
vary linearly over the sample and becomes:

d?
dx

=
?2 ? ?1

L
. (2.10)

Hence, eq. (2.9) may be expressed as:

qx = ?K
d?
dx

, (2.11)

which gives the specific discharge in the x-direction.
d?
dx

is known as the hydraulic gradient for
flow in the x-direction, as presented in (STRACK, 1989).

2.1.2 General form of Darcy’s Law

In practical problems, the flow is rarely rectilinear and neither the direction of flow nor
the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient is known. Therefore, the simple form of Darcy’s law
defined by eq. (2.11) is not suitable for solving problems. In order to solve practical problems, it
is necessary to use a generalized form of Darcy’s law which gives a relation between the specific
discharge vector and the hydraulic gradient. The direction of the specific discharge vector will
vary with position and is in the direction of flow. The magnitude of this vector represents the
amount of water flowing per unit time through a plane of unit area normal to the direction of
flow, as described in (STRACK, 2014). In three dimensions, the specific discharge vector has
three components with reference to a Cartesian coordinate system x, y, z. For three-dimensional
flow using eq. (2.11), the general form of Darcy’s law in terms of specific discharge becomes:

qx = ?K
? ?

? x
, qy = ?K

? ?

? y
and qz = ?K

? ?

? z
. (2.12)

This is because the components of the specific discharge vector are proportional to the compo-
nents of the hydraulic gradient, with K as the proportionality constant. The specific discharge
vector with components (qx, qy, qz) is represented briefly as qi, where the index i stands for x, y



2.2. Continuity of Flow 35

or z. The partial derivatives
? ?

? x
,

? ?

? y
and

? ?

? z
represent the three components of the hydraulic

gradient. We may write the components of this vector as ?x? , ?y? and ?z? , where the ? stands for
differentiation with respect to the coordinate system (STRACK, 1989). The hydraulic gradient
can then be written as:

[?i?] =

[
? ?

? x
,
? ?

? y
,
? ?

? z

]
. (2.13)

Finally, using eq. (2.12) and eq. (2.13), the general form of Darcy’s law is:

qi = ?K?i?, i = 1,2,3. (2.14)

2.2 Continuity of Flow

Darcy’s law consists of three equations of motion having four unknowns qx , qy , qz and
? . For a complete description of groundwater flow an additional fourth equation is required,
known as the mass balance equation. The mass balance equation is valid for steady flow, where it
reduces to the equation of continuity. It results from the consideration that no water can be stored
or produced in an elementary block of soil filled with water as shown in Figure 4. According to
(STRACK, 1989), continuity of the flow is considered by the use of the concept of divergence.

Figure 4 – Continuity of flow

2.2.1 Divergence

The divergence of the specific discharge vector is defined as the net outflow per unit area
and per unit time at a point in the porous medium. The concept of divergence is not limited to



36 Chapter 2. Basic Equations

the specific discharge function, for example we could apply this concept to the velocity field of
any substance, and it is useful in such considerations as mass balance.

As described in (STRACK, 1989; STRACK, 2014) the divergence of the specific dis-
charge vector for the block shown in Figure 4 is determined. Consider that the sides of the block
are ?x, ?y and ?z, and the center is at (x,y,z). The cube is so small that the variation of the
magnitudes of the components of qi along the sides can be neglected with respect to their value
at the center of each side. The inflow through each side then is equal to the normal component of
qi multiplied by the area of the side. The net flow ?Q[m3 /s] leaving the block is obtained from
Figure 4, where only the components of qi normal to the sides are drawn:

?Q = ?y?z[qx(x +
?x
2
,y,z)? qx(x ?

?x

,y,z)]

+?x?z[qy(x,y +

?y
2
,z)]

+?x?y[qz(x,y,z +
?z
2
)? qz(x,y,z ?

?z
2
)].

(2.15)

Now dividing through by ?x?y?z, we have:

qx(x +
?x
2
,y,z)? qx(x ?

?x

,y,z)

?x

+
qy(x,y +

?y

?y
2
,z)

?y

+
qz(x,y,z +

?z
2
)? qz(x,y,z ?

?z
2
)

?z
= div(??q ),

(2.16)

where div(??q ) represents the divergence of the specific discharge vector. Taking the limit, as
?x ? 0,?y ? 0,?z ? 0, then in terms of partial derivatives eq. (2.16) becomes:

? qx
? x

+
? qy
? y

+
? qz
? z

= div(??q ), (2.17)

which is the expression for the divergence of the specific discharge vector.

The divergence of the discharge vector is zero for the case of steady flow, but also for the
special case of transient flow where both the fluid and the porous medium are incompressible.
Therefore eq. (2.17) becomes:

? qx
? x

+
? qy
? y

+
? qz
? z

= 0, (2.18)

which is the continuity equation for steady groundwater flow. The divergence of the specific
discharge vector is non-zero only if the flow is transient, and if either the porous medium or the
fluid is compressible.

The combined form of Darcy’s law and the continuity equation give four equations for
the following four unknowns qx, qy, qz and ? . By substituting values of qx, qy and qz in eq. (2.18),

?

?

?

? z2
= 0, (2.20)

which is Laplace’s equation for the head in the three dimensional case.

2.3 Basic Equations of Groundwater flow

In (STRACK, 1989), it is argued that for obtaining the basic equation of groundwater
flow, we need to introduce the discharge vector Qi to discuss about the discharge potential instead
of the specific discharge. The discharge flowing through the aquifer per unit length is found by
multiplying the specific discharge by the thickness of the aquifer, H, and is defined as Qi = Hqi.
Consider a discharge vector with two components Qx and Qy for two-dimensional flow, defined
as:

Qx = Hqx and Qy = Hqy. (2.21)

Using eq. (2.11), eq. (2.21) takes the form:

Qx = Hqx = H
(
?K

? ?

? x

)

Qy = Hqy = H
(
?K

? ?

? y

) , (2.22)

where K is the hydraulic conductivity constant. Since K and H are constants, eq. (2.22) may be
rewritten as:

Qx = ?
? (KH?)

? x

Qy = ?
? (KH?)

? y

. (2.23)

It is convenient to introduce a new variable ? (the discharge potential). The discharge potential
? is is the real part of the complex potential and is valid for both confined and unconfined
flows whose applications deal with the flow in shallow aquifers, where the Dupit-Forchheimer
assumption1 may be adopted. For confined aquifer with thickness H as shown in Figure 5 and
hydraulic conductivity K, the discharge potential is given by:

? = KH? +Cc (? &gt; H), (2.24)
1 According to Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption, the variation of the head ? in the vertical direction can

be neglected as presented in different works (STRACK, 2014; STRACK, 2003; JONG, 1960).



38 Chapter 2. Basic Equations

and for the unconfined aquifer the discharge potential is given by:

? =
1
2

K? 2 +Cu (? &amp;lt;H), (2.25)

where Cc and Cu are arbitrary constants.

Since
?Cc

= 0, using eq. (2.23) with eq. (2.24), we get:

Qx = ?

CHAPTER

3
ANALYTIC ELEMENT METHOD

This chapter describes a brief description of the Analytic Element Method, which is
based on (STRACK, 1989; MARIN, 2011).

3.1 Introduction

The Analytic Element Method (AEM) was presented by Otto D.L. Strack to simulate
groundwater flow. It uses the exact solution of the governing equations for basic fundamental
features of the aquifer, such as a well, a river, an impermeable barrier, a sink, called Analytic
Elements, and combines such solutions by superposition to approximate the solution of a much
more complex real problem. The AEM is based on analytic solutions of the groundwater gov-
erning equations and does not depend on domain discretization, being able to tackle multiscale
problems where other methods have difficulties (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989). This method
has been applied in different fields such as wellhead protection area delineation, nuclear waste
repositories, and vertical stratified aquifers (MARIN, 2011; WONG; CRAIG, 2010). In this
method, each analytic solution represents an hydrogeologic feature. The hydrogeologic feature is
discretized into simpler geometric features, like points, line segments or polygons. Each geomet-
ric feature is represented by an analytic function with unknown coefficients. The free coefficients
on these functions must be calculated to satisfy the boundary conditions imposed. In one of the
solution approaches, the coefficients are found by specifying the boundary conditions for the
coordinate points on the elements, using the collocation method. There are several approaches
to improve the numerical accuracy or decrease the computational time required to solve the
resulting system of equations (BAKKER, 2008; BAKKER et al., 1999; BAKKER; KELSON,
2009; BANDILLA; RABIDEAU; JANKOVIC?, 2009; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b). In recent
years, AEM received attention with its use for harmonically heterogeneous aquifers (CRAIG,
2009), and the use of Wirtinger calculus (STRACK, 2009a; STRACK, 2009b). Recently, Strack
(STRACK, 2014) used the Cauchy Integral formula combined with the Joukowsky transform



40 Chapter 3. Analytic Element Method

to satisfy the boundary conditions for circular inhomogeneities and line-doublets. Readers are
encouraged to read (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999) for an introductory level discussion of the
AEM.

Consider a system which consists of some wells, rivers, circular and polygonal inhomo-
geneities and fractures. By studying their groundwater flows, we will observe that influences
would occur due to the rivers, circular and polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. In order
to solve such problems, Strack in (STRACK, 1989) proposed line-elements (such as line-sinks,
line-dipoles and line-doublets), which will discuss in Chapter 6 in detail. Strack and Haitjema
used line-sinks for modelling creeks and rivers in a regional flow model, whereas the wells are
used as the places where the inflow or outflow occurs and line-doublets for fractures as described
in (STRACK, 1982; STRACK, 1989).

In the following work we shall introduce the solution for basic Analytic Elements such as
line-doublet, circle and fracture. Such elements will be used later to simulate internal boundary
condition and inhomogeneous medium. We recall that each of those solution satisfies Laplace’s
equation with special boundary condition that are akin to the problem at hand.

The complex potential in the AEM may be written by using the superposition principle
which is the sum of many complex potential components for each physical feature enclosed in a
model. The complex potential, ?(z), at point z = x + iy in the complex plane has the form:

?(z) = ?(z)+ i?(z), (3.1)

where ?(z) is the real part of the complex potential, called discharge potential, proportional to
the hydraulic head and ?(z) is the associated stream function. The gradient of the discharge
potential is orthogonal to the gradient of the stream function and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann
equations:

? ?

? z
= i

? ?

? z
. (3.2)

Lines of constant discharge potential are defined as equipotentials and lines of constant values
of the stream function are defined as streamlines. Similarly flow nets are created by plotting
contours of ? = constant and ? = constant and choosing ?? = ??. This can be seen from eq.
(3.2).

In order to work with the AEM, first of all the discharge potential ?0 at the reference
point z0 is to be calculated using an aquifer condition (like confined or unconfined aquifer). After
calculating ?0, this discharge potential may be used to calculate the constant C for solving the
problem, that takes the form:

C = ?0 ? ?
(
?T (zre f )

)
, (3.3)

where ?T is the complex potential of all the elements at refrence point z0.



3.2. Methods for satisfying the Boundary Conditions 41

3.2 Methods for satisfying the Boundary Conditions
The solution of the governing equation for each element (line-doublet, circle, fracture

etc.) have degrees of freedom which satisfy the boundary conditions, according to the type
of the element and the problem. One of the central fact about AEM is to understand how the
boundary conditions are met for each problem. For this purpose, the following two methods:
Collocation Method and Overspecification Method are widely used in the literature as described
in (HAITJEMA, 1995; MARIN, 2011; JANKOVIC?, 1997; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b;
BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; PRESS, 2007). The first was the collocation method. It uses
predefined points on the element called collocation points, where the boundary conditions are
enforced exactly. The second one is Overspecification method, where the number of unknown
coefficients representing a number of control points over the element is higher than the number
of degrees of freedom for each element, and the boundary conditions are satisfied in a least
square sense over the control points (see further detail in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a)).

3.3 Coordinates Transformation
We will discuss two-dimensional problems with complex variables, in this work. There-

fore, the functional relationship of the complex variable z and the variables x and y is given by
(MARIN, 2011):

f (z) = f (x,y). (3.4)

The use of Laplace’s equation for complex variables open the possibility of the use of
Writinger calculus. It is based on a transformation of variables and allows the direct integration
of the Laplace equation in coordinate system, as described in (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 2009a;
STRACK, 2009b). This transformation is an interesting feature of working with complex vari-
ables and plays an important role in the development of the AEM. It is actually the transformation
of a line in z-plane having length L with directional angle ? relative to the x-axis. Consider the
global coordinate system with point z, defined by:

z = x + iy, (3.5)

and the local coordinate system with point Z , defined by:

Z = X + iY. (3.6)

Let z1 and z2 be the two points in the z-plane. Then the transformation

Z =
z ?

(z1 + z2)

(3.7)

maps the line [z1 , z2] into the interval [-1,1], and the inverse transformation is given by:

z = Z

(z2 ? z1)+

(z1 + z2), (3.8)

CHAPTER

CIRCULAR INHOMOGENEITIES

This chapter discusses the problem of circular inhomogeneities and a methodology
for solving it. The proposed methodology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM)
presented in chapter 3 and more extensively at (MARIN, 2011; STRACK, 1989; JANKOVIC?;
BARNES, 1999a; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999).

4.1 Introduction
In this chapter we will deal with the problem of an aquifer compose of circular regions

whose hydraulic conductivity is different from the surrounding medium. See the Figure 7.

Figure 7 – Aquifer with circular inhomogeneities of distinct hydraulic conductivities

Circular inhomogeneities are circular regions with different hydraulic conductivities. Let
K+j be the hydraulic conductivity inside and K be the hydraulic conductivity outside the circle j,
which shows the permeability of the material. It depends upon the properties of the material like
fluid and soil. It is a material constant and is different in range for different materials like soil,
sand, clay, gravels etc. presented in (STRACK, 1989). The influence of circular inhomogeneities
are simulated by expanding the complex potential in Laurent series outside and Taylor series



44 Chapter 4. Circular Inhomogeneities

inside the inhomogeneity as presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; STRACK, 1999).
Consider the complex potential ?(z) in the form:

?(z) = ?(z)+ i?(z), (4.1)

where ?(z) is the real part of the complex potential, called discharge potential, and is proportional
to the hydraulic head, ?(z) is the imaginary part of the complex potential, called the stream
function and z = x + iy is the location of a point in the complex plane.

The complex potential for a circular inhomogeneity j having radius R j and center c j has
been presented in different works (JANKOVIC?, 1997; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN,
2011), and is defined as:

? j(Z) = ? j(Z)+ i? j(Z) =

???

j |Z| &gt; 1

, (4.2)

for which
Z =

z ? c j
R j

, (4.3)

where the coefficient a0 is real and all an are complex, z represents any position in the global
coordinate system and Z = X +iY is the local coordinate system which represents similar position
specified in local coordinates. The boundary of the circular inhomogeneity is given by:

|z ? c j| = R j, (4.4)

which may be written using the local coordinate system as (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999):

Z = ei? , 0 6 ? &amp;lt;2?. (4.5)

According to (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN, 2011), it is assumed that the
circular inhomogeneity does not meet with other elements and the stream function ? j(Z) given
by eq. (4.2) is continuous across the boundary due to ?(anein? ) = ??(ane?in? ). Therefore, the
complex potential of all the elements in the domain can be represented as:

?(Z) = ? j(Z)+ ??= j(Z), (4.6)

where ??= j(Z) is the combined complex potential of all circular inhomogeneities except j. The
continuity of ? ?= j(Z) and eq. (4.2) ensure the continuity of the stream function across the
boundary of the circular inhomogeneity. Therefore, it is sufficient for the continuity of flow
everywhere in the given domain.

4.2 Boundary Conditions
To satisfy the boundary conditions, the head must be continuous at the edge of an

inhomogeneity (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999), that is:

?
+(? ) = ? ?(? ). (4.7)



4.3. Determining the Unknown Coefficients 45

The only component that jumps across the boundary of the circular inhomogeneity is the
component of the discharge potential itself, which is the contribution from all the circular
inhomogeneities (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999). Hence, the continuity condition of the head at
the edge of an inhomogeneity can be written as:

?
+

K+j
=

?
?

K
, (4.8)

where the + sign is the internal part and the ? sign is the external part of the inhomogeneity,
whereas, K+j is the hydraulic conductivity inside and K is the hydraulic conductivity outside the
circle j. Due to the continuity of the head, the boundary can be parametrized by the angle ? , i.e.,
0 6 ? 6 2? , that leads to the relation (MARIN, 2011; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999):

?
+(? )

K+j
=

?
?(? )

K
. (4.9)

By combining the discharge potentials of all the components of circular inhomogeneities, we
get:

?
+
?= j(? )+ ?

+
j (? )

K+j
=

?
?
?= j(? )+ ?

?
j (? )

K
, (4.10)

or

K?+j (? )? K
+
j ?

?
j (? ) = (K

+
j ? K)?

?
?= j(? ) = (K

+
j ? K)? ?= j(? ), (4.11)

where ?+j (? ) is the discharge potential inside the circle j, ?
?
j (? ) is the discharge potential

outside the circle j and ?+?= j(? ) is the discharge potentail inside of all circular inhomogeneities,
whereas ???= j(? ) is the discharge potentail outside of all circular inhomogeneities except j.

Since the discharge potential generated by the other elements is continuous over the edge
of the jth circular inhomogeneity. Therefore, the boundary conditions may be written as:

K?+j (? )? K
+
j ?

?
j (? ) = (K

+
j ? K)??= j(? ), (4.12)

which is used to determine expressions for calculating the unknown coefficients.

4.3 Determining the Unknown Coefficients

The following techniques are used to determine the required expressions for calculating
the unknown coefficients.

4.3.1 Orthogonality of Fourier Series

To calculate the unknown coefficients of potential expansion for an analytical element,
the boundary condition eq. (4.7) for a circular inhomogeneity may be used. It may be calculated
using eq. (4.2) by the use of Fourier orthogonal relationship. Substituting the real part of eq.



46 Chapter 4. Circular Inhomogeneities

(4.2) in eq. (4.12), multiplying both sides by e?im? , and integrating from 0 to 2? (MARIN, 2011;
BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999), we get:

a0 =

(
K+j ? K

K

)
1

2?

? 2?
0

??= j(? )d? (4.13)

and

an =

(
K+j ? K
K + K+j

)
1
?

? 2?
0

? ?= j(? )e
?in? d? , (4.14)

where a0 is real and all an are complex. The proof is presented in Appendix A.

Using eq. (4.2) into eq. (4.14) we get an infinite linear system for the unknowns a0,a1,....
Obviously, in practice the infinite series must be truncated and only a finite number of coefficients
have to be found.

4.3.2 Least Square Approach

The unknown coefficients given by eq. (4.13) and eq. (4.14) are exact, and determined
by the use of Fourier orthogonal series. Here is another approach called least square approach, in
which the unknown coefficients can be determined by minimization techniques. Regarding this
approach we have:

a0 =

(
K+j ? K

K

)
1

M j

M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m) (4.15)

and

an =

(
K+j ? K
K + K+j

)
2

M j

M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)e
?in?m, (4.16)

where M j shows control points on the boundary of the circular inhomogeneity j. This is the
discrete form of eq. (4.13) and eq. (4.14) and its proof is presented in Appendix A.

4.4 Exact Solution for One Circular Inhomogeneity

A circular/cylindrical inhomogeneity in an uniform field with certain hydraulic conduc-
tivity will serve to issustrate the behavior of the complex potential along the boundary of an
inhomogeneity. The complex potentials in the domain for an inhomogeneity inside and outside
the boundary is denoted by ?+ and ?? as shown in Figure 8.



4.5. The Uniform Flow 47

Figure 8 – A circular/cylindrical inhomogeneity

The exact solution of the problem of a circular inhomogeneity having radius R, centred
at origin in an uniform flow field can be determined by the formulation presented in (STRACK,
2014; MARIN, 2011):

?

+ ?0 for zz &gt; R

2, (4.18)

where Qx0 is the uniform flow field intensity that is parallel to the x-axis and ?0 is a reference
point with a known head. The proof is presented in Appendix B.

4.5 The Uniform Flow

The uniform flow show the behavior of the streamlines in the domain. The definition of
the uniform flow for the global coordinate system having intensity Qu f , forming an angle ?u f
relative to the x-axis, described in (STRACK, 1989), shown in Figure 9 is given by:

?u f = ?Qu f ze?i?u f +C, (4.19)

where C is called the reference point constant and must be calculated given the hydraulic head at
a reference point. This expression is used for complex potential of the uniform flow in this work.

4.6 The Well

The complex potential for a well having intensity Qw, as decribed in (STRACK, 1989),
page 279, is given by:

?w =
Qw
2?

ln(z ? zw), (4.20)

where z represents any position and zw represents the position of the well in the domain.

According to (STRACK, 2014), we can seprate the expression for the complex potential
of a well into real and imaginary parts and may be written as:

? =
Qw
2?

ln(r), (4.21)

and

? =
Qw
2?

? . (4.22)

The flow net for a single well in an infinite aquifer is shown in Figure 10 and the values of the
stream function are shown next to the corresponding streamline. The values of the streamlines
are obtained by the use of eq. (4.22).



4.6. The Well 49

Figure 10 – Equipotentials and streamlines for a well

Source: Marin (2011).

From both the Figure 10 and the expression for ? defined by eq. (4.22), we see that
the stream function is not single-valued, at least not everywhere. Along the negative x-axis, we

obtain ? =
Qw
2

if we choose ? = ? , whereas ? = ?
Qw
2

if we choose ? = ?? . This connects
the well to infinity, called branch cut.

According to (STRACK, 2014), we can imagine that the water that flows from infinity to
the well is transferred via the branch cut back to infinity, thereby satisfying the condition that
there always must be continuity of flow. The jump in the stream function is indeed compatible
with flow from the well through the branch cut to infinity. It is noted that this is a mathematical
observation that has nothing to do with reality.

CHAPTER

5
FRACTURES

This chapter deals with the problems of fractures in an uniform flow field and methodol-
ogy for solving it. The proposed methodology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM)
described in (STRACK, 1982; MARIN, 2011).

5.1 Introduction

Simulation of groundwater flow in fractured porous media is a relevant problem in
different fields such as geologic repositories for nuclear wastes and groundwater contamination
(BERKOWITZ, 2002; NEUMAN, 2005). Groundwater flow in fractures is fundamental in this
context. It is usually present in almost all geologic formations, and can propagate groundwater
(and solutes) several orders of magnitude faster than the porous media, being a contamination
vector (BERKOWITZ, 2002). Geometry of a fracture is a key factor in the process occurring
in it. One of the basic principle is that the fracture would have an ellipsoid shape with no flow
at the ends. Fractures are usually thin and saturated with water. The walls of the fractures are
symmetric with respect to the planes through the centres of the fractures. The most common
conceptual model is that the fracture is formed by smooth and flat parallel plates, as considered
for various experiments in different woks (MARIN, 2011; BERKOWITZ, 2002; BEAR; TSANG;
MARSILY, 2012; WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002). In general, there are two common
classes to model flow in fracture networks:

5.1.1 Continuous Models

Continuous models consists of two or more continuous interacting fractures. It is applied
when a continuous network of fractures is highly connected and dense, whereas, the porous
medium can be ignored. In most cases it is complicated to assume a continuous model for
fractured system (fractals), due to the directional dependence in the flow and the influence of



52 Chapter 5. Fractures

different scales for the properties of fractures for the transport see (MARIN, 2011; NEUMAN,
2005).

5.1.2 Discrete Models

Discrete models allow to describe phenomena that they are able to incorporate explicitly
the properties of the individual fracture. These models consider each fracture independently,
describing its geometric properties and the interconnection between them (BEAR; TSANG;
MARSILY, 2012; MARIN, 2011; BERKOWITZ, 2002). Discrete-shaped fractures can be
represented by uni, bi and three-dimensional elements. Parameters such as length, aperture
and roughness are assigned to each fracture as presented in (CACAS et al., 1990; SINGHAL;
GUPTA, 2010).

Discrete fracture networks are generally generated using statistical distributions based on
the properties found in the field, such as orientation, length distribution, position, density, aperture.
One of the problem in the use of discrete network is to obtain the data. Experimental data may
not be sufficient to determine some of these parameters, for which percentage of fracture actually
conduct fluid, although the network appear to be well connected. The computational effort
required for the simulation using a discrete network can be large, and simplifications such as the
use of parallel plate models can be used to reduce such efforts, despite the various evidences that
such an approach is not sufficient to reduce the experimental results for the field or laboratory
scale (MARIN, 2011; NEUMAN, 2005; WENDLAND; HIMMELSBACH, 2002; CACAS et
al., 1990; BERKOWITZ; SCHER, 1995; BERKOWITZ; SCHER, 1997; CVETKOVIC et al.,
2010). Once the discrete network of fractures is generated then the flow in it must be determined.
The flow models are dependent on the form of the network, but are generally divided into two
classes: one considers that the flow occurs only in the fractures, and the other that there is also
the flow in the porous medium. In the first case, since the flow is contained only in the fractures,
the flow itself is simplified, and generally given by a linear relationship between the flow rate
and the head gradient, with the fracture hydraulic conductivity being the proportionality constant
(MARIN, 2011; CACAS et al., 1990).

The permeability in the fractured system is generally much larger than the permeability
of the porous medium, which leads the velocity of the fluid in the fractures to be larger and faster
carrying to solute. However, delaying effects, solute diffusion and chemical reactions can occur
in porous blocks. Thus, interaction effects between the fractured and porous medium may be
much more important for transport than the flow as presented in (MARIN, 2011; WILSON et al.,
1983; BECKER; SHAPIRO et al., 2000; POTERI, 2009; CROUCH, 1976).

Strack and Jancovic? and Barnes used an Iterative Method to solve the linear systems
resulting from the analytic elements presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). In this work,
we use the same methodology for solving different problems like circular inhomogeneities,
polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets and fractures. However, we found some



5.2. Boundary Conditions 53

cases where the Iterative Method did not converge, like the flow field with many fractures. This
motivate us to a Matrix Method to satisfy the boundary conditions in this specific problem.

5.2 Boundary Conditions

The approximate equation obtained by assuming laminar flow in an elliptical fracture
is given by Strack (STRACK, 1982) in terms of local Cartesian coordinates, where s and n are
parallel and normal to the axis of the fracture respectively. The origin of the local coordinates
system is considered at the center of the fracture. The width b of the elliptical fracture varies
with position, and the length is denoted by L, as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11 – A fracture with local coordinates s and n

Source: Strack (1982).

Assuming the width b of the fracture w.r.t. its length is small, so the head along the
fracture may be replaced by an average head. For the given two-dimensional case, the discharge
using cubic law presented in (STRACK, 1982; LAMB, 1932; MARIN, 2011) has the form:

Qs = ?? b3
? ?

? s
, (5.1)

where ? represents average head across the fracture, Qs [m2/s] represents the discharge through
the fracture and ? is defined as ? =

? g
12µ

, whereas ? is the unit mass of water (density of water),

g is the gravity acceleration and µ is the viscosity (see further detail in (STRACK, 1982)). After
transforming eq. (5.1), the linear law for the dynamics of the fracture takes the form:

Qs = ?K+b
? ?

? s
, (5.2)

where the fracture is considered to be filled with a porous material with hydraulic conductivity
K+.

where ?(s) [m/s] is the sum of the inflows from both sides, per unit length of the fracture. It can
be expressed in terms of the component qn of the specific discharge vector as shown in Figure 12,
and may be written as:

?(s) = ?

. (5.4)

Figure 12 – Viewed for flow in the fractures (left) and in the rock (right)

fracture, ? , in the transverse direction, that is:

5.2. Boundary Conditions 55

The width of the fracture is taken to be zero at the ends and the flow that passes through the
fracture in the direction s is also taken to be zero. Therefore, both Qs and ?+ ? ?? vanishes
there, and eq. (5.9) becomes:

Qs = ?(?+ ? ??), ?
L

Multiplying and dividing by K, the given equation in terms of discharge potential takes the form:

Qs = ?

? s
. (5.12)

From eq. (5.10) and eq. (5.12), we have:

? b3

K
? ?

? s
= ?+ ? ??, (5.13)

and using the linear law, eq. (5.2) may be written in the form:

Qs =
K+b

K
? ?

? s
= ?+ ? ??. (5.14)

In general, the discharge vector for an analytic element is given by the derivative of the
complex potential, that is:

W (z) = ?
d?(z)

dz
= Qx(z)? iQy(z), (5.15)

where Qx(z) and Qy(z) are the discharge vectors in the z-plane. Using the chain rule, for the
Z-plane, we get:

W (z) = ?
d?(z)

dz
= ?

d?(z)
dZ

dZ

. (5.16)

Therefore,

W (z) = ?
d?(z)

dZ

z2 ? z1
. (5.17)

The real part of the differentiated discharge potential rotating to the direction of the fracture s is
equal to the discharge vector in the fracture:

Qs =
d?(z)

ds
= ?(W (z)ei? ), (5.18)

and eq. (5.14) is therefore:

Qs =
K+b

K
?(W (z)ei? ) = ?+ ? ??, (5.19)

which shows the final expression for the boundary conditions on the fracture along its length.



56 Chapter 5. Fractures

5.3 Exact Solution for One Fracture
The space between the walls of the fracture is defined as the width b. The fracture is

ellipsoid as shown in Figure 11. So according to (MARIN, 2011; CROUCH, 1976), the parameter
b is defined as:

b = b*
?

Z2 ? 1. (5.20)

where b* is the maximum width of the fracture at the center, where X = 0. Using the local
coordinate system Z, the width b as a function of X may be written as:

b = b*
?

1 ? X 2. (5.21)

For a fracture that obey the cubic law, according to (STRACK, 1982), the given relation takes
the form:

b = b*(1 ? X 2)
1
6 . (5.22)

Calculating the expression of the width b of the fracture, using Joukowski transformation as
described in (MARIN, 2011) yields:

(ei? ? e?i? ) = 2
?

X 2 ? 1. (5.23)

2i sin(? ) = 2i
?

1 ? X 2. (5.24)

sin(? ) =
?

1 ? X 2. (5.25)

b = b*
?

1 ? X 2 = b* sin(? ) = b*
?

1 ? ?(Z)2. (5.26)

Describing the shape of the fracture using ellipsoid width, it should be noted that inside the
fracture, the shape of the fracture is given by eq. (5.26), that is described by a line, where the
boundary condition is imposed. For detail description of the behaviour of the function along
the element to obtain the term 2

?
X 2 ? 1 or 2i

?
1 ? X 2 see Appendix C or (MARIN, 2011;

STRACK, 1982).

According to Strack (STRACK, 1982), the complex potential of a fracture in local
coordinates system may be written in the form:

?(Z) = A
(

Z ?
?

(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)
)
, (5.27)

for which the dimensionless variables Z as defined in section 3.3, is given by:

Z =
z ?

1
2
(z1 + z2)

1
2
(z2 ? z1)

, (5.28)



5.4. The Complex Potential 57

where z1 and z2 are the end points of the fracture as shown in Figure 6. This function satisfies
the boundary conditions described by eq. (5.19). For the solution of the flow in a fracture in an
uniform flow field the constant A must be calculated. For this purpose, the uniform flow field as
described in section 4.4 must be converted to the local coordinate system, that takes the form:

?u f (Z) = ?
1
2

Qx0 Le
i(???u f )Z +C, (5.29)

where Qx0 is the strength of the uniform flow, L is the length, C is a constant and must be
calculated from the hydraulic head at a reference point, ? is the angle of the fracture with respect
to the x-axis and ?u f is the angle of the uniform flow with respect to the x-axis as shown in
Figure 13.

Figure 13 – Angles ? and ? relative with x-axis in an uniform flow field

Substituting eq. (5.29) in eq. (5.18), after simplification, the constant A may be written
in the form:

A =

1
2

K+b*

KL + K+b*
Qx0 L cos(? ? ?u f ). (5.30)

This proof is presented in Appendix C.
Finally, using eq. (5.29) and eq. (5.30), the complex potential from eq. (5.27) may be written as:

?(Z) =

1
2

K+b*

KL + K+b*

or

?(Z) = AZ ? A
?
(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)?

2

Qx0 Le
i(???u f )Z +C, (5.32)

which is the exact solution of a fracture as described in (STRACK, 1982).

5.4 The Complex Potential
In this section inspired by the formula eq. (5.32) for one fracture, we assume the complex

potential for several fractures given by eq. (5.27) can be expanded in series of power of (Z ?



58 Chapter 5. Fractures

?
Z ? 1

?
Z + 1). A truncated expansion can be used as a numerical approximation for the flow

field in a domain with various fractures. The complex potential of one fracture in the domain
takes then the form:

? j(Z) =
N j

?
n=1

an
(
Z j ?

?
Z j ? 1

?
Z j + 1

)n
, (5.33)

where an are real coefficients of the element j, Z is the dimensionless variable as defined by eq.
(5.28) and N is the order of the series expansion.
Similarly for more than one fracture, the complex potential takes the form:

?(Z) =
M

?
j=1

N j

?
n=1

an
(
Z j ?

?
Z j ? 1

?
Z j + 1

)n
, (5.34)

where the index j represents the complex potential of the fracture j and M represents the total
number of fractures.

5.5 Determining the Unknown Coefficients
The unknown coefficients of the potential expansion for one fracture can be calculated

using the orthogonality of the Fourier Series. Since the discontinuity occurs in the imaginary
part of the complex potential, the discharge Qs takes the form:

Qs =
N

?
n=0

an(e
?in? ? ein? ) = ?2

N

?
n=0

an sin(n? ), (5.35)

LINE-DOUBLETS AND POLYGONAL

INHOMOGENEITIES

This chapter describe the problem of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets
in an aquifer with uniform flow field and the methodology for solving it. The proposed method-
ology is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM) presented in (STRACK, 1989; MARIN,
2011).

6.1 Introduction

The line-doublets are used to model inhomogeneities bounded by closed polygons with
distinct hydraulic conductivities from that of the hydraulic medium. See the Figure 14.

Figure 14 – Aquifer consisting of polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets with different
hydraulic conductivities

In the Analytic Element Method, generally groundwater problems deals with line-
elements (such as line-sinks, line-dipoles and line-doublets). According to (STRACK, 2014), the



60 Chapter 6. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities

line-doublet is a continuous distribution of dipoles along a line having dipoles oriented normal
to the line, as shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 – Line-dipole and line-doublet

(a) A line-dipole (b) A line-doublet

Source: Strack (1989).

In order to derive the complex potential for a line-doublet, first we have to derive the
complex potential for a line-dipole. A line-dipole is the continuous distribution of dipoles along
a line. The complex potential for a dipole at z = z0 = x0 + iy0 is the complex function with
discharge potential and stream function having strength s, as presented in (STRACK, 1989) is
given by:

? =
s

2?

r
and ? = ?

s

or

?(z) = ? + i? =
s

2?
cos(? ? ?)? i sin(? ? ?)

r
=

s
2?

ei?

rei?
. (6.2)

The complex number rei? represents the vector from z0 to z, therefore, rei? = z ? z0, and hence
the complex potential for a dipole becomes:

?(z) =
s

2?
ei?

z ? z0
. (6.3)

The complex potential for a line-dipole is obtained by integrating a dipole along a line (STRACK,
1989). Therefore, by replacing s by ?µ , z0 by ? , using a line of length L, end points z1 and z2,
angle ? relative to the x-axis as shown in Figure 6, the integral of eq. (6.3) for a line-dipole is
obtained as:

?(z) = ?

6.1. Introduction 61

where µ is the discharge distribution and ? is taken to be ?
L

at z1 and
L

at z2, which are the
end points of the line-element.
The complex number ? denotes a point on the line and in terms of ? and it may be written as:

? = ? ei? +
1
2
(z1 + z2). (6.5)

It follows that d? = ei? d? . Hence, eq. (6.4) may be written as:

?(z) = ?
1

2?

z2?
z1

µ

z ? ?
d? . (6.6)

The line can be mapped into the interval [?1,1] by introducing the following dimensionless
variables:

Z = X + iY =
z ?

2
(z1 + z2)

1
2
(z2 ? z1)

and ? = ?1 + i?2 =
? ?

1
2
(z1 + z2)

1
2
(z2 ? z1)

, (6.7)

where z2 ? z1 = Lei? , Z is a position in the local coordinate system associated with the line-
element and z1 and z2 are the end points. From eq. (6.7) it is clear that Z and ? are real along the
element and are mapped onto the real axis between X = ?1 and X = 1, which shows that the
complex potential is analytic in the cut plane ?1 6 X 6 1. Therefore,

1
2
(z1 + z2) corresponds to

the center, and z2 ? z1 represents a vector from z1 to z2 having length L as shown in section 3.3,
Figure 6.

Now by introducing the function µ = µ(Z) which is analytic for all finite Z and using
the variables Z and ? defined in eq. (6.7), we get:

?(Z) = ?

The integrand in the remaining integral is analytic at Z = ? , which may be seen by expanding
µ(Z) in a Taylor series. Since the integral of an analytic function is analytic, therefore, the second



62 Chapter 6. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities

term in eq. (6.10) is also analytic for all Z and is represented symbolically as p(Z) presented in
(STRACK, 1989). Finally, the complex potential for line-dipole becomes:

?(Z) =
µ(Z)
2?

ln
Z ? 1
Z + 1

+ p(Z), (6.11)

where p(Z) can be considered as a correction function.

In the literature, the terms line-dipole and line-doublet are arbitrary used and both are
used for the isolated singularity. Line-doublets are used to model features in the aquifers where
the potential is discontinuous and the stream function is continuous. The hydraulic conductivity
jumps across the boundary of an inhomogeneity, but the head is continuous. The potential jumps,
whereas the stream function is continuous by the flow continuity (STRACK, 1989). As the
line-doublet is a continuous distribution of dipoles along a line having dipoles oriented normal
to the line. Therefore, the complex potential for a straight line-doublet using eq. (6.11), takes the
form:

?(Z) =
1

2? i

(
? (Z)ln

Z ? 1
Z + 1

+ p(Z)
)
, (6.12)

where the function ? (Z) called jump function which is a real polynomial along the element
and p(Z) is the far-field correction polynomial/function that ensures that the given expression

approaches zero as
1
Z

nears infinity (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).

From theory of approximation it is known that Chebyshev polynomials make a better
basis for representing the function to be approximated (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). The
jump function ? (Z) will be approximated by:

? (Z) =
N

?
n=0

anTn(Z), (6.13)

where an are real coefficients, Tn are Chebyshev polynomials and N is the order of the given
Chebyshev series. As the given expression is real along the element, therefore, it may be written
in the form:

? (X) =
N

?
n=0

anTn(X), (6.14)

as presented in (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). The Chebyshev polynomials are defined by
Tn(cos ? ) = cos(n? ) and may be used in the expansion of the jump function ? (X) in a Fourier
cosine series in terms of ? , where X = cos ? see (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).
Similarly, the far-field correction function p(Z) may be written in the form:

p(Z) =

, (6.15)

see (MARIN, 2011). Hence, the complex potential for a line-doublet from eq. (6.12) using eq.
(6.13) and eq. (6.15) becomes:

?(Z) =

6.2 Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions for line-doublets are similar to those of circular inhomogeneities,
in which the hydraulic head must be continuous at the interface, that is:

?
+(? ) = ? ?(? ), (6.19)

where ? +(? ) is the head inside the inhomogeneity and ? ?(? ) is the head outside the inho-
mogeneity. By definition, the only component that have a jump is the discharge potential of
the complex potential ? for the element j see (BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999). Therefore, the
continuity condition of head at the edge of the element j in terms of discharge potential can be
written as:

?
+(?l)

K+j
=

?
?(?l)

K
, (6.20)

where ?l denotes a point on the interface, the + and ? signs shows the sides of the element as
shown in Figure 16, that are considered as internal and external parts for polygons. K+j and K are
the internal and external hydraulic conductivities of bounded polygons as shown in Figure 17.

Figure 16 – A line-doublet with + and ? sides in local coordinate system Z

Source: Marin (2011).

The real part of the complex potential ? is discontinuous and the imaginary part is
continuous across the interface. Therefore, in order to create the jump in the complex potential
across the element (line-doublet), the highest order terms of the series are used whereas all the
other terms are the correction terms (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a).

ln

????? i? for ? 1 &amp;lt;X &amp;lt;1, Y = 0?
, (6.21)

where (+) shows the left side of the element when its going from the first point to the second
and (?) shows the right side. Since, all the correction terms are real along the element and do
not contribute to the discharge potential, on the element the discharge potentials for left and right
sides will become:

?(X,0+) =
1

n=0

anTn(X), (6.22)

and

?(X,0?) = ?

After simplification the jump in the discharge potential becomes:

??(X) = ?(X,0+)? ?(X,0?) =
N

?
n=0

anTn(X), (6.24)

which shows the jump function ? (X) as presented in eq. (6.14). The stream function is continuous

across the element due to the function ln
????X ? 1X + 1

????, that does not jump across the element. Hence,
eq. (6.22) and eq. (6.23) are used to determine the unknown coefficients for line-doublets.

6.3 Determining the Unknown Coefficients

This section presents similar techniques to those in section 4.3 for calculating the
unknown coefficients.



6.3. Determining the Unknown Coefficients 65

As we know ? (Z) =

jump and is real along the element. Using eq. (6.22) and eq. (6.23), the discharge potential may
be written in the form:

a0 =

??= j(? )d? . (6.33)

Multiplying both sides of eq. (6.30) by cos(m? ), we may rewrite as:

Let M j be the control points on the boundary of the line-doublet j and m = 0,1,...,M j ? 1. The
coefficients an will be determined such that they minimize the sum of the squares of the errors,
where the sum is taken over the M j control points.

6.4 Selecting the Control Points
The location of the control points is selected to avoid the singularities caused by the

function ln((Z ? 1)/(Z + 1)) that are ?1 and 1 as Chebyshev control points. Such control points
can be chosen as:

X m = cos
(

?(m ? 0.5)
M j

)
, (6.57)

where m = 1,2,...,M j. For a large number of functions the Chebyshev control Points yield near
optimal approximations (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; CHENEY, ).

CHAPTER

7
SOLUTION ALGORITHM

Different strategies have been used to satisfy the boundary conditions in the AEM. The
first was the collocation, proposed in (STRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA, 1995). It uses predefined
points on the element (such as well, line-doublet, circle, fracture etc.) called collocation points,
where the boundary conditions are enforced exactly. Each element has a fixed number of degrees
of freedom, denoting the analytic element order: a first order element strength is given by
a polynomial expansion of order one, with two degrees of freedom, and has two associated
collocation points. A system of equations is constructed requiring that the boundary conditions
must be satisfied exactly on the collocation points over the element. For example, given a section
of a river with a specified head, it can be modelled using a line-sink element with a given
contribution computed in such a way that the discharge potential of all the elements gives the
specified head value at the collocation points. This method suffers when applied to high-order
elements and has been extensively discussed in the literature, see (STRACK, 1989; HAITJEMA,
1995; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; BATISTA, 2006; NETO; FRANCA, 2008). Later, Strack
and Jancovic? and Barnes developed the idea of overspecification, where the number of control
points over the element is higher than the number of degrees of freedom for each element, and
the boundary conditions are satisfied in a least square sense over the control points presented in
(JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999).
They used an Iterative Method to solve the linear systems resulting from the analytic elements
see (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a). This method has the advantage that no matrix needs to be
constructed explicitly, saving computer memory. In general fast convergence is achieved for the
most types of elements using this method, with high order elements (up to 75) and a relative low
overspecification fold. We use the same methodology for solving different problems like circular
inhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets and fractures. However,
we found some cases where the Iterative Method did not converge, like the flow field with many
fractures (MARIN; WENDLAND; STRACK, 2012; MARIN, 2011). This motivate us to develop
the Matrix Method to satisfy the boundary conditions in this specific problem.



70 Chapter 7. Solution Algorithm

7.1 Solution Algorithm for Circular Inhomogeneities

The unknown coefficients of the analytical elements (circles) can be found from eq.
(4.14), that takes the form:

ai,n = Pi,n
? 2?

0
?(?T (?i))e

?in?i d?i, (7.1)

or

ai,n = Pi,n
? 2?

0
? ?= j(?i)e

?in?i d?i, (7.2)

which calculate the nth unknown coefficient for the circle i, where ?T is the complex potential of
all the elements. The discharge potential ??= j is the real part of the sum of the complex potential
of all other elements present in the system, including the uniform regional flow as given by eq.
(4.19). Equation (7.1) gives rise to a set of linear equations that can be solved by two distinct
techniques: The Iterative Method and the Matrix Method.

7.1.1 Iterative Method

Consider a system of circular inhomogeneities having M circles in an uniform flow field
and a well. The expression to calculate the unknown coefficients for the element/circle i using
eq. (7.1) becomes:

The coefficients a0j,m are initialized with zero. The terms on the right hand side of eq. (7.2) are
assumed to be known and are used for calculating coefficients ai,n . The updated coefficients are
then used for calculating the coefficients of the next element. This process continues until the
variation in the coefficients between the iterations is less than a certain specified value ? . This
method is described in (MARIN, 2011; JANKOVIC?, 1997; JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999b).

7.1.2 Matrix Method

Despite that the Iterative Method comes out quite naturally from eq. (7.1), is easy to
understand and implement, it sometimes fail to converge. For this reason it may be necessary to
form the coefficient matrix A of the linear system

Ax = b (7.6)

and solve it using appropriate techniques for linear systems. The matrix A is constructed from
the expansion in power series of the potential of circular inhomogeneities. The known vector b
in eq. (7.6) results from the contribution of the uniform flow and the well. After simplification
eq. (7.3) can be rewritten in the form:

ai,n

?(C)e?in?i d?i

=
? 2?

0
?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))e

?in?i d?i,

(7.7)

and is used to calculate the unknown coefficients in the Matrix Method, whereas the uniform
flow, well and the conductivity relation are the same as in eq. (4.19), eq. (4.20) and eq. (7.5).

In general, using the Matrix Method we would generate the matrix A with dimension M * Nelem +
1, i.e. A(M*Nelem+1)×(M*Nelem+1), where M is the total number of analytical elements, Nelem is the
approximate order of the series expansion of the element and the additional term is necessary for
calculating the constant. The last row and column are for calculating the constant. It is noticed
that in case of circular inhomogeneities the unknown coefficients are complex. Therefore, using
eq. (7.11) and eq. (7.12), we can get the matrix in the form A(2(M*Nelem)+1)×(2(M*Nelem)+1). This
is due to the separation of real and imaginary parts. For the case of 2 analytical elements (circles)
with an approximated series expansion of order 3, the general form of the matrix A is:

74 Chapter 7. Solution Algorithm

7.2 Solution Algorithm for Fractures
This section adopt the same methodology of solution algorithm as described in section 7.1.

The unknown coefficients of the analytical elements (fractures) can be found from eq. (5.39),
that take the form:

ai,n = Pi,n
?

?

0
?(?T (?i))sin(n?i)d?i, (7.13)

or
ai,n = Pi,n

?
?

0
? ?= j(?i)sin(n?i)d?i, (7.14)

which calculates the nth unknown coefficient for fracture i, where ?T is the combination of the
complex potential of all the elements.

Equation (7.13) also gives rise to a set of linear equations that can be solved by two
distinct techniques: The Iterative Method and the Matrix Method. The general convergence of
these methods for analytic elements has been analysed in this work. This convergence is analysed
by the use of spectral radius as presented in (GENE; CHARLES, 1996) for the Iterative Method.

7.2.1 Iterative Method

Consider a system of M fractures in an uniform flow field. The expression to calculate
the unknown coefficients for the element i using eq. (5.41), eq. (7.13) becomes:

ai,n = Pi,n
M

?
j ?=i

?
?

?(Wj(?i)e

i?i)sin(?i)sin(n?i)d?i

+ Pi,n
?

?

?((?u f (?i))e

(7.15)

or

ak+1i,n = Pi,n

?
j ?=i

?
?

?(Wj(?i)e

i?i)sin(?i)sin(n?i)d?i

+ Pi,n
?

?

0
?((?u f (?i))e

i?i)sin(?i)sin(n?i)d?i,

(7.16)

where k counts the steps of the iterative process and i shows a specific element. The regional
uniform flow ?u f (?i) is as defined in eq. (4.19) and

Pi,n = ?

7.2.2 Matrix Method

To calculate the unknown coefficients for the element i, after simplification eq. (7.13)
can be rewritten in the form:

(
?Qu f ei(?i??u f )

)
sin(?i)sin(n?i)d?i.

(7.22)

This expression is used to calculate the unknown coefficients in the Matrix Method.

Using eq. (7.22), we would generate the matrix A with dimension M * Nelem, that takes
the form A(M*Nelem)×(M*Nelem), where M is the total number of analytical elements and Nelem is
the order of the series expansion of each element. For the case of 2 analytical elements (fractures)
with an approximated series expansion of order 3, the general form of the matrix A is:

7.3. Solution Algorithm for Line-doublets 77

7.2.3 Convergence Test

Consider the matrix A and its decomposition A = D + U + L, where U is the upper
triangle matrix, L the lower triangle matrix, and D the diagonal.

1. The Jacobi matrix partition:

R = D, (7.23)

T = ?(U + L). (7.24)

2. The Gauss-Seidel (GS) matrix partition:

R = D + L, (7.25)

T = ?U, (7.26)

with the system solution obtained using the standard iterative scheme:

xk+1 = R?1Txk + R?1xk. (7.27)

This iterative scheme will always converge for any initial vector x0 given that the spectral radius,
defined in (GENE; CHARLES, 1996):

?(G) = max(|?i|), (7.28)

is less than 1, where ?i are the eigenvalues of the matrix G, where G = R?1T. In this work we
used the Gauss-Seidel matrix partition to check the convergence.

7.3 Solution Algorithm for Line-doublets

The solution algorithm in this section for determining the unknown coefficients of the
analytic elements (line-doublets) follows the same procedure as described in previous sections.
The unknown coefficients of the analytical elements can be found from eq. (6.39), that takes the
form:

ai,n = Pi,n
?

?

0
?(?T (?i))cos(n? )d?i, (7.29)

which calculate the nth unknown coefficient for line-doublet i, where ?T is the combination of
the complex potential of all the elements.
In this case eq. (7.29) gives rise to a set of linear equation that can be solved by the same two
distinct techniques:



78 Chapter 7. Solution Algorithm

7.3.1 Iterative Method

Consider a system of polygonal inhomogeneity having M line-doublets forming a closed
polygon, an uniform flow field and a well. The expression to calculate the unknown coefficients
for element i using eq. (7.29) becomes:

ai,n = Pi,n
M

?
j ?=i

?
?

0
?(? j(Z j(?i)))cos(n?i)d?i + Pi,n

?
?

0
?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))cos(n?i)d?i,

(7.30)
or

ak+1i,n = Pi,n
M

?
j ?=i

?
?

0
?(? j(Z j(?i)))cos(n?i)d?i + Pi,n

?
?

0
?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))cos(n?i)d?i,

(7.31)
where k counts the steps of the iterative process and i shows a specific element. Moreover the
elements ?u f and ?w are the same as defined in eq. (4.19) and eq. (4.20), whereas

Pi,n =

??????
?????

?

(
K+j ? K
K + K+j

)
f or n = 0

4
?

(
K+j ? K
K + K+j

)
f or n &gt; 0

. (7.32)

7.3.2 Matrix Method

This section follows the same procedure as described in subsection 7.1.2. After simplifi-
cation eq. (7.30) can be rewritten in the form:

ai,n
Pi,n

?
M

?
j ?=i

?
?

0
?(?(Z j,i(?i))cos(n?i)d?i ?

?
?

0
?(C)cos(n?i)d?i

=
?

?

0
?(?u f (?i)+ ?w(?i))cos(n?i)d?i.

(7.35)

The matrix A has dimension M * Nelem + 1 rows using eq. (7.35), where M is the total number of
analytical elements (line-doublets), Nelem is the approximate order of the series expansion and
the additional term is necessary for calculating the constant as described in subsection 7.1.2. The
general form of the matrix is:

CHAPTER

8
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results presented in this chapter were obtained by using the AEM to solve ground-
water flow problems of different complexities on domain with different geometries.

We start by presenting some tables with the parameters that define the problem and will
be used in the simulations. The length parameters are chosen in meters and all the simulations
presented in this chapter use the following data, as shown in Figure 18:

? Reference point: z0 = (0,0)

? Hydraulic reference head at reference point: ?0 = 50 m

? Background hydraulic conductivity: K = 1 m/day

? Well at point: zw = (100,100)

Figure 18 – Initial simulation parameters of an aquifer.



82 Chapter 8. Results and Discussion

8.1 Circular Inhomogeneities

The results presented in this section are for problems composed of circular inhomo-
geneities in an uniform flow field with different hydraulic conductivities and radii. All the
problems presented below were solved by both the Iterative and the Matrix Method.

8.1.1 Comparison with the Analytical Solution

This section presents comparison between the analytical and the numerical solution of a
circular inhomogeneity in an uniform flow field. The analytical solution known from (STRACK,
1989) is shown in Figure 19 and its comparison with the numerical solution is shown in Figure 20,
which is obtained with parameters given in Table 1. By comparing the analytical solution defined
in section 4.4 with the numerical solution of the problem, we found out that the relative error
(see Appendix D) is 9.5 × 10?17, which is the order of machine epsilon.

Figure 19 – Analytic solution of a circular inhomogeneity in an uniform flow field with larger hydraulic
conductivity than the background. Streamlines are horizontal and piezometric contours
(hydraulic head contours) are in the vertical direction.

The numerical solution of the problem for a circular inhomogeneity is obtained by both
the Iterative and the Matrix Method with parameters given in Table 1, which coincide, as shown
in Figure 21. This indicates that the Iterative Method, as well as the matrix solution, using
numerical integration to obtain the coefficients is able to obtain almost identical results.

8.1.2 Simulation for a cluster of Circular Inhomogeneities

Figure 23 consists of 5 circular inhomogeneities with different radii and hydraulic
conductivities in an uniform flow field. The circles parameters are given in Table 2. The uniform
flow intensity is equal to Qu f = 0.5 m/day with orientation 30? along the horizontal direction.

Figure 23 illustrates the behaviour of the streamlines and piezometric contours. Note



8.1. Circular Inhomogeneities 87

that the streamlines avoid to enter the inhomogeneities, whereas the piezometric contours do.
This occurs due to the lower hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneities. It means that the
permeability inside the inhomogeneities is lower than the medium.

The problem shown in Figure 24 consists of 5 circular inhomogeneities randomly dis-
tributed with parameters given in Table 3, and a well of discharge Qw = 100 m3/day located
at point zw instead of uniform flow in the domain. It shows that the well draws all of its water
from everywhere (infinity) and is transfered via the branch cut back to infinity as defined in
section 4.6.

In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our methods, further simulations were made
for a more complex problem consisting of 10 circular inhomogeneities distributed randomly close
to each other in the domain, with an uniform flow field and a well. The uniform flow intensity is
Qu f = 0.5 m/day along the horizontal direction as shown in Figure 25, with parameters given



88 Chapter 8. Results and Discussion

in Table 4, and the well has discharge Qw = 100 m3/day is located at point zw as shown in
Figures 25 and 26. Although these test cases are more challenging due to the proximity of
inhomogeneities (4 and 7) and a well between them, the Matrix Method as well as the Iterative
Method are able to solve adequately the expected flow field. The details demonstrate the ability
of the methods to simulate the flow field at different scales.

90 Chapter 8. Results and Discussion

All the results show the behaviour of the streamlines and piezometric contours and it
is noticed that when the hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneities is greater than the
medium, the streamlines enter the inhomogeneities whereas the piezometric contours avoid to
enter due to high permeability or vice versa. During simulations it is observed that the Iterative
Method as well as the Matrix Method gives the same results in all the examined cases.

8.2 Fractures
In this section different configurations of fracture systems submitted to uniform flow are

evaluated. The fractures present different hydraulic conductivities and the resulting system of
equations is solved both by the Iterative and the Matrix Method.

8.2.1 Comparison with Analytical Solution

We start with the case that simulates the influence of a single fracture oriented parallel
to the uniform flow. This problem has an analytical solution as proposed by (STRACK, 1982).
The uniform flow is of 0.5 m /day and the background conductivity of the aquifer is 1 m/day.
The elliptical fracture with an aperture of 0.01 meter has a hydraulic conductivity of 1000 m/day,
which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the aquifer. The order of expansion for the
numerical solutions is N = 10.

the same behaviour as the analytical one, as shown in Figure 28. The relative error, calculated as
the difference between analytical and numerical solution normalized by the hydraulic head at
each point is shown in Figure 29. By comparing the exact and numerical solutions, we found
that the maximal relative error is 7.2 × 10?05.

Although the problem is symmetric the relative error is not, since the error is normalized
by the hydraulic head, which reduces in the flow direction. Obviously the error is larger close
to the fracture, where the influence of the expansion approximation is larger. The error is also



92 Chapter 8. Results and Discussion

influenced by the fracture geometry. In the analytical solution the geometry of the fracture is
elliptic, while in the numerical expansion, the fracture presents constant width. Nevertheless
this comparison demonstrates that the numerical expansion seems to approximate well analytic
solution.

and numerical solution normalized by the hydraulic head at each point for a single fracture.

8.2.2 Simulation for a cluster of Fractures

In order to evaluate the convergence behaviour of the numerical solutions, several system
of fractures in an uniform flow were simulated with different orientations. In each case, the



8.2. Fractures 93

background hydraulic conductivity is equal to K = 1 m/day and the intensity of the uniform
regional flow is equal to Qu f = 0.5 m /day. In all the cases, the Iterative Method failed to converge
and the problem was solved by the Matrix Method proposed in this work.

In the first example we have 3 fractures parallel to each other and oriented at an angle
of 30? to the uniform flow. The fracture parameters are given in Table 5. In this case there is
no analytical solution for verification of the results. However the resulting flow field is sound
and resembles the expected streamlines behaviour. The uniform flow is disturbed by the high
conductive fractures leading the flow through its narrow widths.

oriented with an angle of 30? to the horizontal direction. The resulting flow field was obtained
by the Matrix Method with parameters given in Table 5.

In the second example we have 2 groups with 3 fractures each that are orthogonal to each
other and oriented at an angle of 30? to the uniform flow. The fracture parameters are given in
Table 6. Although this test case is more challenging due to the proximity (distance = 5 m) of
orthogonal fractures (1 and 2), the Matrix Method is able to solve adequately the expected flow
field. Again the high conductive fractures control the streamline path and hydraulic head distri-
bution. The details demonstrate the ability of the method to simulate the flow field at different
scales. Despite the short distance between orthogonal fractures (1 and 2) the piezometric contours
are continuous through the fractures and the streamlines demonstrate the mass conservation.

96 Chapter 8. Results and Discussion

Figure 32 presents a more general flow field controlled by a system of 10 fractures ran-
domly distributed in the domain. The fractures parameters are presented in Table 7. The uniform
flow is oriented 30? to the horizontal and is strongly affected by the fractures. Nevertheless the
resulting streamlines are continuous and describe adequately the expected flow in this domain.

8.2.3 Convergence Analysis

In the simulations presented in Figures 30 to 32, it was observed that the Iterative Method
diverged. The Matrix Method, using a direct solver, managed to find a suitable solution for the
flow field for a system of fractures. Following the observed behaviour a convergence analysis
has been done by the criteria presented in subsection 7.2.3 in this work.

8.2.3.1 Increasing Fracture Hydraulic Conductivity

In order to evaluate the matrix eigenvalues, 3 different geometries of fracture systems in
uniform flow were evaluated. These geometries were randomly distributed fractures (geometries
1 and 2) as well as parallel oriented fractures (geometry 3). In the first simulation all the fractures
have the same hydraulic conductivity K+ = 1000 m/day and width b = 0.01 m. The background
aquifer conductivity is 1 m/day and the uniform flow is along the horizontal direction. In the
following simulations the hydraulic conductivity of one fracture (fracture 4 in each geometry) is
successively increased.

The maximal eigenvalue obtained for the matrix in each case is presented as a function
of the growing factor P, calculated as the product of Pi,n and Gc. Pi,n is defined in eq. (7.17) and
Gc is a geometric constant, obtained from the integral function of the fractures, as defined in eq.
(7.22).

Figure 34 shows the maximum eigenvalue obtained for the proposed geometries and
increasing hydraulic conductivity. The hydraulic conductivity increased from K+ = 102 m/day
to K+ = 106 m/day only for one fracture. In the first case, P = 5 × 10?2; whereas for the last
one P = 5 × 102.

The analysis of the eigenvalues of the matrix G, presented in subsection 7.2.3, shows
that the maximum eigenvalue becomes larger than 1, even in the first case for geometry 2. This
is the reason for convergence failure of the Iterative Method.

Figure 34 also shows that all the systems depend on the internal hydraulic conductivities
as well as the orientations of the fractures.

Further analysis was done with different geometries as shown in Figure 35 by varying
fracture’s lengths. The curves for the maximum eigenvalues obtained for these geometries
are shown in Figure 36. This shows that keeping hydraulic conductivities constant increasing
fracture’s lengths decrease the eigenvalues.

The flow field was obtained by the Matrix Method. Horizontal lines are streamlines and the

8.3 Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities

The results presented in this section were obtained for problems of groundwater flow with
polygonal inhomogeneities formed by line-doublets in an uniform flow field using the Analytic

Element Method. Several problems with different parameters of hydraulic conductivities, radii,
lengths and order of series expansion were simulated by both the Iterative and the Matrix Method
for comparing the results due to the failure of the Iterative Method, as discussed in case of
fractures. This section is further divided in two subsections:

8.3.1 Comparison with Analytical Solution of a Circle

This subsection presents a comparison of the analytical solution of a circle proposed by
(STRACK, 1989), as presented in section 4.4, with the numerical solution of a circular polygonal
inhomogeneity formed by 64 line-doublets in an uniform flow field. The uniform flow is of 0.5
m/day and the background conductivity of the aquifer is 1 m/day. Figure 37 shows the results for
the streamlines and the hydraulic head for the parameters given in Table 8, which coincide.

circular polygonal inhomogeneity in the flow field shown in Figures 37, 38 and 40.

6.2 × 10?07.

Figure 40 illustrates the behaviour of the streamlines and the hydraulic head contours.
Again the streamlines enter the inhomogeneity, whereas the hydraulic head contours avoid it.
This is because, the permeability inside the polygon is higher than the background as observed in
the case of circular inhomogeneities. Figure 40b also shows the variation of the hydraulic head
values in the aquifer.

Figure 41 shows the comparison between the streamlines and piezometric contours of a
circular polygonal inhomogeneity formed by 64 line-doublets, for the parameters given in Table 8.
The problem was simulated by both the Iterative and the Matrix Method, providing the same
results. This indicates that in case of line-doublets, the Iterative Method as well as the Matrix
Method produced almost identical results, as observed in the case of circular inhomogeneities.

8.3.2 Simulation for a cluster of Polygonal Inhomogeneities

The system depicted in Figure 42 has six inhomogeneities randomly distributed around
the background hydraulic conductivity: two lower than the background hydraulic conductivity
and the others higher, with simulation parameters given in Table 9. The background hydraulic
conductivity is considered as K = 1 m/day, and the regional uniform flow has the intensity
Qu f = 0.5 m/day.

The problem depicted in Figure 43 consists of the same polygonal inhomogeneities
with parameters given in Table 9, and a well of discharge Qw = 100 m3/day located at point zw
in place of the uniform flow. It shows the same behaviour as observed in the case of circular
inhomogeneities: the well draws water from everywhere passing through inhomogeneities and
goes back to infinity through a branch cut.

8.3.3 Comparison with Analytical solution of a Fracture

This subsection presents comparison of the analytical solution of a fracture presented
in (STRACK, 1982), defined by eq. (5.31), with the numerical solution of a fracture formed by
60 line-doublets in an uniform flow field. Figure 44 shows the results of the streamlines and
hydraulic head. In this case, the internal hydraulic conductivity is taken as K+ = 100 m/day and
the order of series expansion as N = 5. By comparing the analytical and numerical solutions, we
found out that the relative error is 9.0 × 10?07. The relative error is shown in Figure 45.

8.3.4 Simulation for a cluster of Fractures

Figure 46 consists of 3 horizontal, parallel fractures each formed by 20 line-doublets
oriented at an angle of 30? to the uniform flow. The fracture parameters are given in Table 10.
The resulting flow field is sound and resembles the expected streamlines behaviour. The uniform
flow is disturbed by the high conductive fractures leading the flow through its narrow widths.

Figure 47 consists of 6 fractures: 2 groups with 3 fractures each are orthogonal to
each other and oriented at an angle of 30? to the uniform flow. The fracture parameters are
given in Table 11. Although this test case is also more challenging due to the proximity of
orthogonal fractures (1 and 2), but both the Iterative and the Matrix Methods are able to describe
adequately the expected flow field. In this case we found almost the same results as mentioned in
subsection 8.2.2, whereas the hydraulic conductivities inside the fractures is 10 times greater than
the previous ones. Again it is noticed that the high conductive fractures control the streamline
path and hydraulic head distribution.

From all the figures the behaviour of the streamlines and piezometric contours is ob-
served and it is noticed that when the hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneities is
larger than the medium, the streamlines enter to the inhomogeneities whereas the piezometric
contours avoid to enter due to high permeability or vice versa as observed in the case of circular
inhomogeneities. Moreover, after simulating the problems using line-doublets to form different
polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures, it is observed that the Iterative Method converges in all
the cases and gives the same results by comparing with the Matrix Method.

8.3.5 Error Analysis

An error analysis has been done for both the polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. It
consists of different grids which are gradually refined by twice the previous ones. This analysis



8.3. Line-doublets and Polygonal Inhomogeneities 109

was done using a single circular polygon and fracture, centered at the origin. In both cases, a
comparison was made between the line-doublets and the relative error as shown in Figures 48
and 49. The legends show the refinement of the control point in the domain.

8.4 Computational Performance

Different problems such as circular inhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities and
fractures were solved by the AEM to compare the processing time for both the Iterative and the
Matrix Method. In such cases, it is observed that the Iterative Method takes more processing
time than the Matrix Method with high order of series expansion using the same systems. In our
simulation both the Matrix and the Iterative algorithm codes are shared, with only the difference
in the system solver, so the comparison was made using only our solver for both cases.

Some comparisons were made between the processing times of both the Iterative and the
Matrix Method in this work. Figure 50 illustrate the processing time of both the Iterative and the
Matrix Method for the problem consists of 10 circular inhomogeneities as shown in Figure 25,
and Figure 51 illustrate the processing time of the Matrix Method (because the Iterative Method
did not converge for more than one fracture) for the problem consists of 10 fractures as shown in
Figure 32. After simulating the problems, it is noticed that the Matrix Method is much faster than
the Iterative Method as illustrated in Figures 50 and 51. This means that the computational cost
of the Matrix Method is lower. This is because the Iterative solver takes a large number of steps
to satisfy the convergence criterion. The matrix solver needs to fully construct the coefficients
matrix in the first step, and then need to solve the system once.

inhomogeneities shown in Figure 25, by both the Iterative and Matrix Method.

It must be noted that both the Iterative and the Matrix Method have not been optimized

can be implemented. The library solvers were also not tuned for optimal performance, so the
results shown here can still be improved by at least one order of magnitude or more.

This work proposes to simulate two-dimensional groundwater flow using the Analytic
Element Method. Several problems were simulated and described in detail such as: circular
inhomogeneities, polygonal inhomogeneities and fractures. All the simulations are programmed
in Matlab R2014a and processed on a Core i7 Intel Processor computer.

Circular inhomogeneities were simulated using both the Iterative and the Matrix Method
and almost identical results were obtained. The agreement of the numerical solution with the
exact solution was excellent, with relative error smaller than machine precision. The complex
potential for circular inhomogeneities as well as the iterative solution are known in the literature
(JANKOVIC?, 1997; BARNES; JANKOVIC?, 1999; MARIN, 2011). The implementation and
results were compared to the existing literature. The results for circular inhomogeneities served
as the basis for the comparison and verification of the polygonal inhomogeneities using line-
doublets.

Polygonal inhomogeneities were implemented using line-doublets as analytical elements.
The complex potential for the line-doublet and the implementation for the iterative algorithm
was based on (JANKOVIC?; BARNES, 1999a; MARIN, 2011). In this case, the numerical
solution of a polygonal circular inhomogeneity was compared with the exact solution of a
circular inhomogeneity, whereas a polygonal ellipsoidal inhomogeneity using line-doublets
was compared with the exact solution of a single fracture as described in (STRACK, 1982).
Such comparisons were found excellent with satisfactory results. All the systems resulting from
line-doublets were solved by both the Iterative and the Matrix Method and almost identical
results were obtained.

The complex potential for a discrete fracture system in porous medium was developed in
this work, based on the exact solution for one single fracture (STRACK, 1982). This complex
potential for one fracture was analysed and implemented by both the Iterative and the Matrix
Method and the agreement of the numerical solution with the exact solution was found excellent.



114 Chapter 9. Conclusion

However, during simulations it is observed that the Iterative Method did not converge for some
cases, as for instance the flow field with many fractures. This fact led to the Matrix Method to
solve the linear system.

The main contributions in this work are the development of the Matrix Method and the
convergence analysis of the Iterative Method. The Matrix Method was developed by imposing
the intern boundary conditions for the Analytic Element Method. This method, using a direct
solver, managed to find the correct solutions for the system of fractures. The Matrix Method
takes advantage of the results of the Cauchy’s integral, using the orthogonality of the basic
functions of the expansion of the analytical elements for the construction of the matrix.

Moreover, the divergence of the Iterative Method motivated the study of the behaviour
of the iterative solutions to the proposed problems using Gauss-Seidel partition. The spectral
radius of the Iterative system was analysed, and cases were observed where the spectral radius
is larger than 1, which indicates that the convergence of the system to an initial solution vector
is not guaranteed. The spectral radius being larger than 1 for the Iterative Method indicated
non-convergence of some systems, especially in the case of fractures, and cannot be applied to
all analytic element methods in all cases.

In general, it is common in numerical simulation and computation that there is a com-
promise between memory usage and processing time. The computational cost of the Iterative
Method is higher in processing time and less in memory use, whereas in the Matrix Method
the inverse occurs. Higher memory usage leads to lower processing costs, and vice versa. This
relation was observed in the comparison of the solution of the same problem to the Iterative and
the Matrix Method.

FUTURE WORK

In this thesis we developed a numerical solution for discrete models of fracture networks,
as presented in Chapter 5. In the series expansion, the unknown coefficients are obtained from
the discharge potentials of all other elements that are related to the expansion coefficients. The
procedure is applied to two-dimensional groundwater flow in fractured porous media by the
Analytic Element Method (AEM) and it is observed that the resulting flow field looks correct
and resembles the expected streamlines behaviour in all the examined cases. This motivates us to
work with more complex problems such as crossing fractures as shown in Figure 52.

In the literature we found some of the formulation for the crossing fractures as presented
in (STRACK, 1982). This formulation is modelled by the complex potential of the line-doublets
(line-segments). If we follow the method developed in (STRACK, 1982), we need to simulate
minimum eight line-doublets to approximate two crossing fractures as shown in Figure 52, which
will be computationally costly as observed in this thesis. Thus, we try to generalize the approach
presented in this thesis for crossing fractures using the conditions prescribed at the crossing as
described in (STRACK, 1982).

DETERMINING THE UNKNOWN

COEFFICIENTS

A.1 Orthogonality of Fourier Series
The boundary conditions for circular inhomogeneities presented in section 4.2 are:

K?+j (? )? K
+
j ?

?
j (? ) = (K

+
j ? K)??= j(? ). (A.1)

The discharge potential for a circular inhomogeneity j using eq. (4.2), assumes that:

?
+
j (? ) = a0 + ?

(
?

?
n=1

ane
in?

)
and ??j (? ) = ?

(
?

?

?
n=1

?in?

)
, (A.2)

which is the real part of the complex potential.
Let,

?
+
j (? ) = a0 +

?

?
n=1

?[(?(an)+ i?(an))(cos(n? )+ i sin(n? ))]. (A.3)

?
+
j (? ) = a0 +

?

?
n=1

?[(?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? ))+ i(?(an)sin(n? )+ ?(an)cos(n? ))].

(A.4)
By considering the real part we get:

?
+
j (? ) = a0 +

?

?
n=1

[?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? )]. (A.5)

Similarly,

?
?
j (? ) = ?

?

?
n=1

?[(?(an)? i?(an))(cos(n? )? i sin(n? ))]. (A.6)

?
?
j (? ) = ?

?

?
n=1

?[(?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? ))? i(?(an)sin(n? )+ ?(an)cos(n? ))],

(A.7)



122 APPENDIX A. Determining the Unknown Coefficients

and by considering the real part we get:

?
?
j (? ) = ?

?

?
n=1

[?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? )]. (A.8)

Substituting eq. (A.2) into eq. (A.1) gives:

K

? K+j ?

(
?

?

?
n=1

Multiplying both sides by e?im? = cos(m? )? i sin(m? ), yields:

e?im? = (K+j ? K)? ?= j(? )e

?im? .

(A.10)
Now substituting eq. (A.5) and eq. (A.8) into eq. (A.10) produces:

Ka0e
?im? + K

?

?
n=1

[
?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? )

[
?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? )

][
cos(m? )? i sin(m? )

]
= (K+j ? K)??= j(? )e

?im? .

(A.11)

If n = m, then we have the following properties:

? 2?
0

sin(nx)sin(mx)dx =
? 2?

0
sin2(nx)dx = ? (A.12)

? 2?

cos(nx)cos(mx)dx =

cos2(nx)dx = ? (A.13)

? 2?
0

sin(nx)cos(mx)dx =
1
2

? 2?
0

sin(2nx)dx = 0 (A.14)

Integrating from 0 to 2? , if m = n, eq. (A.11) becomes:

K? [?(an)+ i?(an)]+ K
+
j ? [?(an)+ i?(an)] =

? 2?
0

(K+j ? K)? ?= j(? )e
?in? d? . (A.15)

K? an + K

?

? 2?
0

? ?= j(? )e
?in? d? . (A.18)



A.2. Least Square Approach 123

Similarly integrating from 0 to 2? , using eq. (A.11), we get:? 2?
0

Ka0d? =
? 2?

(K+j ? K)? ?= j(? )d? . (A.19)

2? Ka0 = (K

a0 =

Hence,

a0 =

? ?= j(? )d? . (A.22)

and

an =

)
1
?

? 2?
0

??= j(? )e
?in? d? . (A.23)

which completes the proof, as described in subsection 4.3.1.

A.2 Least Square Approach
In this section we use the same boundary conditions as mentioned in eq. (A.1) for circular

inhomogeneities, that takes the form:

K?+j (? )? K
+
j ?

?
j (? ) = (K

+
j ? K)??= j(? ). (A.24)

Using eq. (A.5) and eq. (A.8), eq. (A.24) becomes:

Ka0 +
?

?
n=1

[
K (?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? ))+ K+j (?(an)cos(n? )? ?(an)sin(n? ))

]
= (K+j K)? ?= j(? ).

(A.25)

Let M j be the control points on the boundary of the circular inhomogeneity j:

Zm = e
i?m (A.26)

where m = 0,1,...,M j ? 1. The coefficients an will be determined such that they minimize the
sum of the squares of the errors, where the sum is taken over the M j control points, and the errors
are defined by the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of eq. (A.25),
that is, solving the problem:

M j?1

? MIN(a0,...,an).

(A.27)



124 APPENDIX A. Determining the Unknown Coefficients

Using eq. (A.27), we can write:

M j?1

(K+j ? K)? ?= j(?m). (A.28)

M jKa0 = (K

M j

M j?1

?
m=0

??= j(?m), (A.30)

which is the discrete version of eq. (A.22).
Taking derivative w.r.t. ?(ar), eq. (A.27) becomes:

[
N j

cos(r?m) = 0.

(A.32)
By exchanging the summations, we get:

]

= (K+j ? K)
M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)cos(r?m). (A.33)

If n = r, then we have the following properties:

M j?1

?
m=0

cos(n?m)cos(r?m) =
M j
2

(A.34)

M j?1

?
m=0

sin(n?m)cos(r?m) = 0 (A.35)

and eq. (A.33) becomes:

(K + K+j )?(an)
M j
2

= (K+j ? K)
M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)cos(n?m). (A.36)

Now by taking derivative w.r.t. ?(ar), eq. (A.27) becomes:

M j?1
?

m=0

[
N j
?

n=1
(K + K+j )[?(an)cos(n?m)? ?(an)sin(n?m)]?(K

j ? K)??= j(?m)

]
sin(r?m) = 0.

(A.37)



A.2. Least Square Approach 125

By inverting summation, we get:

N j

?
n=1

(K + K+j )

[
?(an)

M j?1

?
m=0

cos(n?m)sin(r?m)? ?(an)

sin(n?m)sin(r?m)

]

= (K+j ? K)
M j?1

?
m=0

??= j(?m)sin(r?m). (A.38)

Using eq. (A.34) and eq. (A.35), eq. (A.38) becomes:

(K + K+j )?(an)
M j
2

= ?(K+j ? K)
M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)sin(n?m). (A.39)

By adding eq. (A.36) and eq. (A.39), we get:

an =

)
2

M j

M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)e

which is the discrete version of eq. (A.23).
Hence,

and

2

M j

M j?1

?
m=0

? ?= j(?m)e
?in?m, (A.42)

which completes the proof, as described in subsection 4.3.2.

Similarly for an unconfined aquifer the discharge potential outside the circle j is given by:

?uc =

and inside the circle it is given by:

?1 =

2. (B.4)

Let the total discharge potential be:
? = K f (?). (B.5)

where K is the hydraulic conductivity and f (?) is some function of the head. The head is
continuous across the boundary of the inhomogeneity and therefore the condition is given by:

?
+

??
=

K f (? +)
K f (? ?)

=
K+j
K

zz = R2, (B.6)

where K+j is the hydraulic conductivity inside the circle j, K is outside and R is the radius at the
boundary. There is a jump in potential across the boundary, which we represent as ? and

? = ?+ ? ?? =
K+j ? K

K
?

? zz = R2. (B.7)



128 APPENDIX B. Exact Solution of a Circle

According to (STRACK, 2014), we can use the complex potential of an impermeable cylindrical
object in a field of uniform flow, which is similar to the case of the circular lake/inhomogeneity
to obtain the required results, that is:

? = ?Qx0
(

z +
R2

z

)
+C. (B.8)

Suppose that,

?1 = ?aQx0
(

z +
R2

z

)
if zz &gt; R2 (B.9)

and
?1 = C1 if zz &amp;lt;R

2, ?C1 = 0, (B.10)

where Qx0 is the intensity of the uniform flow along the horizontal direction, z = x + iy is the
position of a point in the complex plane, R is the radius of the circle, a and C1 are constants.
We add a second complex potential ?2 throughout the flow domain as described in (STRACK,
2014), i.e.

?2 = (a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0 ?z, (B.11)

where ?0 is the discharge potential at a reference point with a known head. The potential on the
outside is ?1 + ?2, therefore,

? = ?1 + ?2. (B.12)

Using eq. (B.9) and eq. (B.11), eq. (B.12) takes the form:

? = ?aQx0
(

z +
R2

z

)
+(a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0 for zz &gt; R

2. (B.13)

? = ?Qx0
(

z + a
R2

z

)
+ ?0. (B.14)

Now using the boundary conditions, let r = R and z = Rei? . Suppose that,

?1 = ?
+
1 ? ?

?
1 . (B.15)

Using eq. (B.9) and eq. (B.10), eq. (B.15) takes the form:

?1 = C1 + aQx0

(
Rei? +

R2

R
e?i?

)
. (B.16)

or
?1 = C1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? . (B.17)

As there is no jump in the uniform flow, therefore:

?2 = 0, (B.18)

and
? = ?1 + ?2 = C1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? . (B.19)



B.1. Exact Solution 129

At the boundary using eq. (B.7), eq. (B.14) becomes:

?
? = ?Qx0

(
Rei? + a

R2

R
e?i?

)
+ ?0. (B.20)

Let, ?? = ?? + i??. Therefore,

?
? = ?Qx0 (R cos ? + aR cos ? )?0, (B.21)

which is the real part of the complex potential.
Substituting eq. (B.21) into eq. (B.7), we get:

? =
K+j ? K

K
[?Qx0 R cos ? (1 + a)+ ?0]. (B.22)

? = ?
K+j ? K

K
Qx0 R cos ? (1 + a)+

K+j ? K
K

?0. (B.23)

By comparing the values of ? from eq. (B.19) and eq. B.23), we may write:

C1 + 2aQx0 R cos ? =
K+j ? K

K
?0 ?

K+j ? K
K

Qx0 R cos ? (1 + a). (B.24)

From eq. (B.24), we can also write:

C1 =
K+j ? K

K
?0, (B.25)

and

2aQx0 R cos ? = ?
K+j ? K

K
Qx0 R cos ? (1 + a). (B.26)

a = ?
K+j ? K
K+j + K

. (B.27)

Substituting value of a into eq. (B.14) yields:

? = ?Qx0

(
z ?

K+j ? K
K+j + K

R2

z

)
+ ?0 for zz &gt; R

2. (B.28)

Using eq. (B.10) and eq. (B.11), eq. (B.12) takes the form:

? = C1 +(a ? 1)Qx0 z + ?0. (B.29)

Since,

a = ?
K+j ? K
K+j + K

. (B.30)

a ? 1 = ?
K+j ? K
K+j + K

? 1. (B.31)



130 APPENDIX B. Exact Solution of a Circle

a ? 1 =
?K+j + K ? K

+
j ? K

K+j + K
. (B.32)

a ? 1 =
2K+j

K+j + K
. (B.33)

Substituting the values of C1 and (a ? 1) from eq. (B.25) and eq.(B.33) in eq. (B.29) we get:

? = ?
2K+j

K+j + K
Qx0 z +

K+j
K

?0 for zz &amp;lt;R
2. (B.34)

Hence,

?

K

?0 for zz &amp;lt;R
2, (B.35)

and

?

(

)
+ ?0 for zz &gt; R

2. (B.36)

that completes the proof, as presented in section 4.4.

C
THE CONSTANT FOR THE EXACT

SOLUTION OF A FRACTURE

C.1 The Constant A
This section presents the calculation of the constant A, which appears in the exact solution

of a fracture in an uniform flow field, see (STRACK, 1982).

Consider the arguments ?1 and ?2, defined as:

?1 = arg(Z ? 1) in [+?,??], (C.1)

and
?2 = arg(Z + 1) in [??,+?], (C.2)

as shown in Figure 53.
To see the behaviour of the function

?(Z) = ? + i? =
?
(Z ? 1)(Z + 1) =

?
(Z ? 1)

?
(Z + 1). (C.3)

along the real axis, assumes that:
if ?1 6 X 6 1 and Y = 0+, then for

?
Z ? 1 with Z = X + iY , we have:

Z ? 1 = X ? 1 + iY = ? ei? . (C.4)

where
? =

?
(X ? 1)2 +(Y )2. (C.5)

Therefore,
?

Z ? 1 =
?

? ei? /2. (C.6)

For Y ? 0, we get:
?

Z ? 1 = i
?

1 ? X. (C.7)



132 APPENDIX C. The Constant for the Exact Solution of a Fracture

For
?

Z + 1,
Z = X + iY. (C.8)

Z + 1 = X + 1 + iY = ? ei? . (C.9)

?
Z + 1 =

?
? ei? /2. (C.10)

For Y ? 0, we get:
?

Z + 1 = (
?

1 + X)× 1 =
?

1 + X. (C.11)

Using eq. (C.7) and eq. (C.11), eq. (C.3) becomes:

?(Z) = (i
?

1 ? X)×(
?

1 + X) = i
?

1 ? X 2, (C.12)

which is the purely imaginary.
Similarly if ?1 6 X 6 1 and Y = 0?, then

?
Z ? 1 = ?i

?
1 ? X, (C.13)

and
?

Z + 1 =
?

1 + X. (C.14)

Using eq. (C.13) and eq. (C.14), eq. (C.3) becomes:

?(Z) = (?i
?

1 ? X)×(
?

1 + X) = ?i
?

1 ? X 2, (C.15)

which is also purely imaginary.
Now if ?? &amp;lt;X 6 ?1 and Y = 0, then

?
Z ? 1 = i

?
X ? 1, (C.16)



C.1. The Constant A 133

and
?

Z + 1 = i
?

X + 1. (C.17)

Using eq. (C.16) and eq. (C.17), eq. (C.3) becomes:

?(Z) = i
?

X ? 1 × i
?

X + 1 = ?
?

1 ? X 2, (C.18)

which is real.
Similarly if 1 6 X &amp;lt;? and Y = 0, then

?
Z ? 1 =

?
X ? 1, (C.19)

and
?

Z + 1 =
?

X + 1. (C.20)

Using eq. (C.19) and eq. (C.20), eq. (C.3) becomes:

?(Z) =
?

X ? 1 ×
?

X + 1 =
?

X 2 ? 1, (C.21)

which is also real.

According to (STRACK, 1982), the complex potential for single fracture in an uniform
flow field is given by:

?(Z) = A
?

(Z ? 1)(Z + 1)+ AZ ?
1
2

qx0 Le
i(??? )Z +C. (C.22)

and the boundary conditions using the linear law is given by:

?
+ ? ?? =

2K+b
KL

? ?

? X
. (C.23)

The expressions for
? ?

? X
and ?+ ? ?? along the element using eq. (C.22) becomes:

? ?

? X
= A ?

1
2

qx0 L cos(? ? ? ), (C.24)

and

?
+ ? ?? = ?Ai

?
1 ? X 2 ? Ai

?
1 ? X 2 = ?2Ai

?
1 ? X 2 = ?2A

?
1 ? X 2, (C.25)

where ? is the real part of the complex potential, Qx0 is the uniform flow intensity, L is the length
of the fracture, ? is the angle of the fracture with respect to the x-axis, ? is the angle of the
uniform flow, C is a constant and must be calculated from the hydraulic head value at a reference
point and A is a constant.
Substituting eq. (C.24) and eq. (C.25), eq. (C.23) takes the form:

?2A
?

1 ? X 2 =
2K+b

KL

(
A ?

Hence,

which completes the proof, as proposed in section 5.3.

D
RELATIVE ERROR

D.1 Error Analysis
Groundwater flow simulations consists of a set of computational tools designed for

the solution of the governing equations modelling the physical phenomena (MARIN, 2011;
GRAND, 2003). The processing of the numerical algorithm is generally made on a computer.
Computers due to their limitations have the restriction that they only work with discrete and
finite representations of continuous quantities, like mathematical and physical models which
may include continuous and discrete quantities. This limitation is one of the origin of the error
associated to numerical models (MARIN, 2011; PRESS, 2007). Other source of the error is the
truncation error, associated to the numerical model itself. The truncation error arises from the
finite quantity of memory of a computer to use of finite series and require to compute discrete
quantities of continuous variables (MARIN, 2011; PRESS, 2007). An example of a truncation
error is the error that arises when calculating an integral, computing the function to be integrated
in a discrete set of points.

There are two ways to calculate the error: the absolute error and the relative error. The
absolute error is defined as the magnitude of the difference between the values of the exact and
the numerical solution, and is given by:

Absoluteerror = ? abs(Exactsolution(xi)? Numericalsolution(xi)). (D.1)

The relative error is defined as the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the exact value for
defined points, and is given by:

Relativeerror = ? abs
(

Exactsolution(xi)? Numericalsolution(xi)
Exactsolution(xi)

)
. (D.2)

Mapping of error values are obtained by evaluating the absolute and the relative error for the
control points of the given domain. For each point of the domain, the absolute or relative error is
calculated and the results plot by the graphs.
