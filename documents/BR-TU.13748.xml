Foreword 
 
Increased energy security and reduced greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions are the core of 

EU?s strategy for the next decades. An 80% reduction on GHG emissions by 2050 requires 
Member States and energy sectors to adopt measures that help to achieve this long-term 
objective through intermediate 2020 binding targets. 

Transport appears as the most resilient sector on this transition period, as it is highly 
dependent of one single and imported fossil energy source. Despite the achieved efficiency in 

modern vehicles, increasing patterns on private car usage urges the need to diversify its energy 
mix while reducing its environmental impact.  
The development of a prediction tool, which can evaluate the energy and CO2 well- to-wheel 

impact due to the uptake of technical and non-technical measures, constitutes a key element to 
support decision makers on finding the best future energy scenario.  

 
The research work and the obtained results were conducted and internally presented a t Toyota

Summary 
 

What is the problem? 
The need to d iversify transport?s energy matrix requires decision makers both at the political 
and industrial level to define future strategies and priorities for the transport sector. Hence, the 

need to have representative data of the current European transport situation is crucial to project 
future scenarios allowing finding a best energy-technology compromise.  
 

 
Why there is a problem? 

1. Lack of detailed European data 
2. Lack of modelling across all transport modes (air, rail, road and sea) and sub-modes 

(airplanes, metro, high-speed, bus, car, etc) 

3. The need to test elasticity 
 

Eurostat 

Representative energy data for the transport sector can be found at the Eurostat?s database 
however its scope is still limited. Understanding of the well-to-wheel contribution of the 

railways, bus or passenger car urges the need to study the transport system across all modes.  
Additionally, it is not possible to individually characterize each well- to-wheel energy and CO2 

efficiencies for each sub-mode such as metro, high-speed, bus, car and others, in terms of 
energy/km, energy/pkm, CO2/km and CO2/pkm.  
 

Tremove, Ex-Tremis 

Models such as the Tremove or the Ex-Tremis provide interesting tank-to-wheel data for the 

road and rail sub- modes but they do not match the totals provided by the Eurostat. Also, it is 
not possible to individually characterize all transport sub- modes, their energy and 
environmental efficiencies, as well as the interaction across all transport sub-modes. 

 
 

What was realized? 
A comprehensive transport model considering all the major transport means, its associated 
energy efficiencies, all related to the passenger mobility demand published by the Eurostat  

was developed. A well- to-wheel analysis is performed matching with the tank-to-wheel 
quantities provided by the Eurostat. Figure 1 shows the dissertation work sequence.

Summary 

 

4 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Several data sources were analyzed, in particular the “JEC Biofuel Programme” and the  

National Renewable Energy Action Plans from each Member State, with the objective of 
projecting a future likely situation. This allowed projecting an expected energy efficiency 

improvement, the calculation of potential biofuel blends that might be in the market by 2020, 
as well as a potential market size for electric vehicles.  
 

Using the developed model together with the expected 2020 energy situation, several 
scenarios evaluating the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of 

technical and non-technical measures were performed.  
 
 

What was concluded? 
Responsible for about 50% of the total well- to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions 

of the transport sector, the car segment presents the largest potential to reduce transport?s oil 
reliance. On a business as usual scenario for 2020, the passenger mobility?s tank-to-wheel 
CO2 emissions are projected to increase about 23% to the level of 906MtCO2, above 2007 

levels. 
 

Current capacity of the collective modes s uch as metro, normal-, high-speed and bus cannot 
absorb all the mobility demand currently performed by the car segment. The single full modal-
shift from the passenger car into those modes offers the potential of reducing in about 15% the 

well-to-wheel CO2 emissions, in the reference year. 
 

The current low capacity of the high-speed segment to absorb passengers from the aviation 
and car segments, offers a marginal 6% and 3% well- to-wheel CO2 reduction in case of a full 
shift of longer journeys, in the refere nce year. 

 
In a scenario of efficiency improvements, the passenger car is alone capable to reduce by 17% 

the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of the passenger mobility segment. An additional 5% 
reduction is possible if other modes such as aviation, bus and passenger vans also improve.  
 

The single uptake of the biofuel blend calculated on the NREAPs (11% volume bioethanol, 
12% volume biodiesel), offers the potential to reduce the we ll- to-wheel CO2 emissions by 3%, 

in the reference year.  
 
A full uptake of electric vehicles in urban areas offers the potential to reduce the passenger 

mobility?s well- to-wheel CO2 emissions by 31%, being the largest measure to reduce 
emissions. A real uptake of electric vehicles such as the one coming from the NREAPs, offers 

a potential of 5% well-to-wheel CO2 reductions.  
 
 

In which extent the model was useful? 
The developed transport model, together with the results from the N REAPs, helped Toyota 

Motor Europe to evaluate different energy scenarios and to support future business decisio ns.

1. Introduction 
 

1.1. The European energy context 
 
Enlargement, market liberalization and economy growth contributed for the continuously 

increase of EU?s energy consumption since early 1990s, while the phase out of old power 
plants, improvements on energy efficiency, the uptake of renewable energy sources together 
with the recent economic recession contributed for the decrease of CO2 emissions [1], as 

shown in Figure 2. 
Recent political crisis in Middle East and Northern Africa raised concerns about EU?s security 

of energy supply, creating uncertainties on the markets and energy prices. Ensuring energy 
security while reducing its imports dependency and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, are 
the main driving forces of the European Union policies for the decades to come.

The 2020 vision 

In March 2007, the European Union endorsed an integrated approach called “The European 

Climate C hange Package” aiming to reduce GHG emissions and increase the penetration level 
of renewable energy sources. Transform the EU into a highly energy-efficient and low-carbon 
economy was the motivation of this energy policy package. To start this process, EU Heads of 

State and Governments set a series of climate and energy targets to be met by 2020, as shown 
in Figure 3. These are [3]: 

- 20% reduction on GHG emissions below 1990 levels; 
- 20% share of renewable energy sources on final energy consumption, with a 

mandatory objective of 10% for the transport sector; 

- 20% reduction in primary energy consumption compared with projected levels, to be 
achieved by energy efficiency.

Major European climate mechanisms 

Launched in 2005, the European Emiss ions Trading System (EU ETS) is a pioneer mechanism 

to reduce industrial GHG emissions. The system is based on a “cap and trade” principle, 
which means that there is a limit on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be 

emitted by the industry players registered in the system. Within this cap, high carbon intense 
companies receive emission allowances which they can sell to or buy from one another as 
needed [4]. 

The Transport, Household and Agriculture sectors are excluded from the Emissions Trading 
Scheme, belonging to the non-ETS sector. This means that their GHG emissions cannot be 

traded creating the need to implement individual mechanisms and measures.  
 
On the transport sector, the inclusion of the aviation sector in the EU ETS by 2012 represents 

one of the main mechanisms to virtually reduce its carbon emissions. This will allow air  
companies to buy and sell emissions allowances according to their level of carbon emissions 

[5]. 
For the road transport sector, indicative emissions targets for new cars and vans sales, the 
carbon-indexed taxation for passenger cars and the road taxation for heavy duty trucks are 

some of the mechanisms now in place to reduce road carbon emissions [6]. 
It is that expected by 2020 the average new sales emissions for car OEMs should achieve a 

maximum of 95gCO2/km, and for new van sales this figure is slightly higher, 135gCO2/km 
[6]. The objective of road taxation is to input a price per km driven for heavy duty trucks in 
countries where this traffic is considerable high.

Introduction 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  9 

 

The recently published White Paper for the future of transport outlined a 60% long-term CO2 

reduction target to be met by 2050 [7]. 
 

Regarding fuels, the directive 2003/30/EC required fuel suppliers to incorporate a n average 
renewable energy source blending of 2% by 2005 and 5,75% by 2010. This should have been 
achieved through blends of bioethanol and biodiesel on gasoline and diesel, without any 

requirement specific for each biofuels type [8]. 
Also, according to the fuel quality directive (2009/30/EC), there is a mandatory objective that 

intends to reduce the carbon intensity of the supplied fuels for transport. It is required that by 
2020, average fuels supplied for road transport should be 6% less carbon intense compared to 
2010, in a well- to-wheel basis. It includes all fossil fuels, gasoline, diesel, LPG and Natural 

Gas as well as bio fuels and electricity for road [9]. 
 

 

The National Renewable Energy Action Plans 

The European Commission required each Member State to provide information on how they 

plan to meet their 2020 final renewable energy objectives, underlined in the renewable energy 
directive (2009/28/EC). Heating and Cooling, Electricity and Transport, are the three energy-

intense sectors where the European Commission wants to have a detailed picture for the years 
up to 2020. Data on energy consumption and renewable energy integration should be 
published in these reports, as well as policies and measures needed to drive national energy 

markets in those objectives. It was required from each Member State to respect the template 
provided by the European Commission where all energy data should be detailed by energy 

type, technology and year-by-year from 2010 up to 2020 [10]. 
 
 

1.2. The European transport sector 
 

The Transport sector is a crucial sector for EU?s economy. It ensures territorial cohesion, 
increases the EU?s competitiveness, brings together people and cities, and allows the transport 
of goods through all Member States. 

 
 

A major energy consumer 

Transport accounts for about 30% of EU?s final e nergy consumption with an high dependence 
on one single and imported fossil energy source: oil [11] as shown in Figure 4. O il?s high 

energy density represents a crucial advantage in all mobility solutions and an essential 
requirement for those that are more sensitive to weight and autonomy, such as aviation and 

long-distance road transport. Also, its distribution and refuelling installed infrastructure 
together with its relative cheap price compared to others energy carriers, places it in a 
dominant and stable market position.

Figure 4 – [Intro] EU’s final energy distributi on, 2007 [11]. 

 
 

The aviation sector continues relying almost entirely on kerosene with a light use of gasoline. 
The uptake of biofuels as well as other renewable energy carriers is negligible. 

The rail sector is the most energy diversified sector of all transport modes. Electricity 
produced from a variety of primary energy sources such as coal, nuclear and natural gas, and 
diesel in some applications are the main energy carriers currently used in railways. Also, the 

deployment of the renewable electricity sector makes the rail sector one of the most low-
carbon transport modes.  

 
Road transport relies almost entirely on fossil fue ls such as gasoline and diesel, 96% [11], 
contributing for its high level of carbon emissions as shown in Figure 5. LPG was the first 

alternative energy truly implemented at road transport level with a dedicated refuelling 
infrastructure however its usage remains marginal when compared to gasoline and diesel. In 

recent years, and especially in countries such as Italy and Sweden, natural gas in forms of 
compressed natural gas became popular, highly motivated by Government incentives. The 
uptake of biofuels was still marginal in 2007, when energy blends of bioethanol and biodiesel 

in gasoline and diesel reached about 1% and 3% [11], respectively.

Introduction

A major carbon emitter 

The transport sector is responsible for around a quarter of EU?s CO2 emissions being the 
second largest emitting sector, after energy. Road transport is the largest emitting mode, 

accounting for 70% of transport?s carbon emissions [11]. 
While emissions from other sectors have generally falling, those from transport have 
continuously increased since the 1990s, reaching its highest level in 2007. Recently data of 

2008 and 2009 showed for the first time a significant reduction in transport?s carbon emissions 
in two consecutive years [1]. 

Some explanations for this phenomenon are described in the literature: improvements on 
energy efficiency from new vehicles, the uptake of biofuels and the recent economic recession 
which had reduced freight transport activity mainly performed by diesel trucks [1, 7]. 

 
 

An intense activity sector 

Transport activity is largely determined by people?s location, life style patterns and 
availability of infrastructure. It is used both for people?s mobility and freight transport, for 

leisure and work purposes, within EU and at international level.  
 

The aviation sector presented the largest activity growth during the last decade, showing an 
increase of 25%, in passenger-km figures, between 2000 and 2007 [11]. Liberalization of air 
transport increased competition, lowered air fares and widened the range of choices for intra-

EU routes. However, this increase had put some strain on the available capacity – both in the 
sky and on the ground. Traffic density resulted in an increasing number of delays, saturation 

of the sky and shortages in airports capacity.  
 
Rail transport has been reducing its relevance on passenger mobility and freight transport,  

remaining with a constant volume of carried passengers and freight [11]. Recently in 2008, 
EU?s passenger mobility by rail grew about 3,5% compared to 2007, mainly driven by a 

remarkable 10% increase on passenger mobility by high-speed rail [11]. The construction of 
new high-speed lines in countries such as Germany, Spain and The Netherlands, together with 
the liberalization of their railway market operators have significantly contributed for this 

increase. 
 

Road transport is the most important transport mode in the EU accounting for more than 80% 
and 45% of EU?s passenger mobility and freight transport [11]. Passenger cars and heavy duty 
trucks appear as the most used sub- modes for these purposes. Despite a slow increase in 

infrastructures in recent years, the road transport?s popularity contributed for the continuous 
increasing in its activity, resulting in large levels of congestion, noise and air pollution.  

Recently data of 2008 showed a slight decrease on road?s passenger mobility and freight 
transport [11]. The uptake of high-speed lines might have contributed for a reduction on 
passenger car usage while the recent economic recession might justify the decrease on road 

freight transport activity.

The Automotive sector 

The European car fleet accounts with about 220million vehicles, with about 4 million being 
added each year [12]. This figure intends to increase, especially in newer Member States 

(EU12) where motorization rates are lower compared to older Member States (EU15). 
Despite the fuel efficiency achieved in modern vehicles, the car sector plays a major role in 
transport?s energy consumption, in forms of gasoline and diesel, and consequently on carbon 

emissions. Large and increasing number of vehicles, together with the increasing activity 
volumes, seems to have rapidly offset all efficiency gains.  However, in terms of fuel 

efficiency improvement of new car sales, the car industry was able to reduce its average new 
sales emissions of about 15% between 2000 and 2009, from 172gCO2/km to 146gCO2/km 
[13], as shown in Figure 6. 

 

 
Figure 6 – [Intro] Evolution of average ne w c ar sales emissions  [13]. 

 
 

Urban areas and the modal shift 

High concentration of population and economic activities in urban areas contributes for the 

continuous increase on the number of daily journeys, mainly performed by private car and 
delivery vans. Comfort, privacy and a “door-to-door” service, might explain why these modes 
are the most preferred in urban areas, in depreciation of the public and collective modes such 

as bus and metro. Here, clearly exists the potential for urban areas improvement, tackling 
actual challenges such as congestion, noise and air quality. 

The uptake and the development of a pan-European high-speed rail network provides a better 
environmental solution to replace carbon- intense passenger journeys between city centres, 
allowing also the expansion of freight trains using the remaining normal-speed lines, reducing 

road heavy duty transport.

1.3. Motivation 
 
Under the environmental strategies of the European Commission such as the European 

Climate C hange Package (ECCP) and the recently published White Paper for the future of 
transport, there are three principal objectives that are conducting the EU?s energy policy 
direction for the decades to come. These are: 

1) 20% reduction by 2020 below 1990 levels (ECCP) 
2) 10% reduction by 2020 below 2005 levels (non-ETS) 

3) 60% reduction by 2050 below 1990 levels (White Paper) 
 
Under this umbrella it is necessary for decision makers both at the political and industrial level 

to project future scenarios enabling the evaluation of the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 
impacts resulting from a technical or a non-technical shift. 

 
Identify the potential well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of 
measures such as the energy efficiency improvements, bio fuels or electric vehicles, as well as 

resulting from a modal-shift into collective transport modes requires the characterization of the 
transport sector in all of its components.  

Hence, evaluating the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency, linking with the actual 
passenger mobility and freight transport demand and also taking into account the current 
European fleet, requires the usage of actual and representative European data for the entire 

transport sector.  
 

The Eurostat provides official statistics for the European transport sector but is not enough 
detailed in all the components of the transport system. For example, it is not possible to  
individually characterize the total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 situation for the metro, high-

speed, bus or passenger car, etc, or to characterize its well-to-wheel energy and CO2 
efficiency per km or per pkm, or even the passenger mobility running in different energy types.  

 
Therefore, a comprehensive transport model that enables the characterization of a ll transport 
modes and sub- modes, its energy and CO2 performances, all used energy carriers, both for 

passenger mobility and freight transport purposes and which can be used as a prediction tool,  
is a crucial element to support decision makers on finding the best future energy and 

technological mix.

1.4. Objective 
 
The objectives of this dissertation are: 

1) To model the current well- to-wheel energy and CO2 contribution from each mode of 
transport to the total transport picture,  

2) To analyse the expected future transport energy situation at the European Union level,  
3) To develop future scenarios taking into account the expected increase on passenger 

mobility demand as well as the technical and non-technical shifts. 

 
These objectives were achieved during 3 phases along the internship as shown in Table 1.

2010 Phase 1 Phase 2    

2011           Phase 3 

 

Phase 1 

Its objective is to develop a comprehensive and detailed model for the European transport 
sector which evaluates the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 situation through the input of actual 

and representative data, such as the one coming from the Eurostat. Then it is required to 
individually study each mode of transport, each used energy carrier, each associated energy 

and CO2 efficiency, linking with the passenger mobility demand data provided by the Eurostat, 
also in a well- to-wheel basis. 
Having all categories defined, it will be possible to see the detailed contribution of each mode 

of transport for the total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 picture, using real European data from 
the Eurostat. 
 

Phase 2 

Its objective is to analyse each National Renewable Energy Action Plan that all 27 Member 

States have published to the European Commission. A detailed picture of the Electricity and 
Transport energy situation by 2020  will be provided  as well as the calculation of potential 
biofuel blends that might be in place by 2020 and market size for the electric vehicle segment.  

Having all data gathered, it will be possible to build detailed electricity and transport expected 
energy picture by 2020. 

 
Phase 3 

Its objective is to develop future energy scenarios based on selected data sources for the year 

2020, and on the passenger mobility demand analysis. 
The manipulation of parameters such as the energy efficiency, the modal shift, vehicle?s 

powertrains and energy carriers, will allow building of scenarios and to evaluate the potential 
energy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts compared to the reference case.  
Having several 2020 scenarios, it will be possible to combine all scenarios and provide a likely 

energy and CO2 situation by 2020.

1.5. Dissertation organization and content 
 
The present dissertation is divided in eight C hapters, with the additional chapters of 

References and Annexes. 
 
On the Introduction, the European energy and transport situation are characterized along a 

description of actual trends and intensities.  
On the State of Art, several articles and relevant studies on the transport modelling topic are 

presented, together with its important results for the context of this dissertation.  
On the Methodology and Model development and calibration, the methodology or the 
construction of the transport energy and CO2 model will be explained, followed by the 

presentation of the used data sources, and finally the model?s calibration process.  
On the Development of 2020 scenarios, the potential energy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts at 

the passenger mobility level will be evaluated, according to the constructed model and 
external data sources. Finally, a likely scenario for 2020 will be presented.  
Finally, on the chapters of Results, Conclusions and Recommendations for future work , the 

final results will be presented and discussed as well as the limitations of the adopted 
methodology and the recommendations of interesting future work on the topic.  

 
 
This dissertation starts to evaluate the actual contribution of each mode of transport (e.g. 

airplanes, metro, bus, car, etc) for the total well-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 
emissions, as well as it identifies the individual average well-to-wheel energy efficiency for 

each mode, in terms of MJ/km, gCO2/km, MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm, for each used energy 
carrier. 
It also makes the link with the passenger mobility and freight transport variables such as the 

occupancy rate, the volume of passenger-km and freight-km transported both by each mode 
and by each energy carrier. 

 
Then this dissertation presents the results of the manipulation of the most likely variables that 
can help the EU to reduce its transport energy consumption and CO2 emissions: energy 

efficiency improvements, increase on modal shift, high-speed rail infrastructures, uptake of 
renewable energies and new power trains. 

It analyzes relevant external data sources such as the “JEC Biofuel Programme” and the 
“National Renewable Energy Action Plans”, in order to characterize the expected 2020 
transport energy situation.  

 
Finally, it assesses the individual and agglomerate  measures and established comparisons with 

the developed reference case, in particular focus for the passenger mobility sector. As a result, 
this dissertation will provide a likely future transport energy scenario for 2020.

2. State of Art 
 
This dissertation comprehends a large variety of concepts related to the transport 

environmental and energy performance. Concepts ranging from energy and CO2 data (total 
quantities), the energy efficiency in terms of energy/km and energy/pkm, passenger mobility 
data, modal-shift impacts, electric vehicles, all on a well-to-wheel analysis, are some of the 

main examples. However, it does not mean that those concepts will be deeply analyzed in all 
of its fundaments or theoretical definitions.  

 
Here, it is important to inform that the work realized on this dissertation was previously 
organized and idealized by Toyota Motor Europe who provided the principal motivation, the 

objective and the mindset behind this job. The principal tools as well as the calculation method 
were latterly optimized. 

 
The principal used tools and the articles that were consulted during the learning and model?s 
development process are presented in the following sections. The articles were selected based 

on the importance that they had in the moment of model?s calibration as well as adequate 
methodology findings. Given the differences on the concepts, this chapter is divided in five 

sub-chapters: 
1) Transport energy, CO2 and mobility data 
2) The White Paper 

3) Technical variables 
4) Non-technical variables 

5) Addressing 2020 objectives 
 
 

2.1. Transport energy, CO2 and mobility data 
 

Information about the current and future energy, CO2 and passenger mobility situation of the 
European transport system can be found both in the Eurostat and in several European transport 
studies. 

 
The Eurostat provides current European information on the total transport energy consumption 

and CO2 emissions from the four main modes – air, rail, road and sea. Additionally, the 
Eurostat also provides information on passenger mobility and freight transport demand 
divided by its main sub- modes – airplanes, metro&amp;amp;tram, railways, high-speed rail, bus, car and 

powered-two-wheels. 
 

Studies such as the iTREN2030 project [14], and models such as the Tremove [15] and the 
Ex-Tremis [16], provide information on the actual and future energy and passenger mobility 
demand for the European Transport system, by pre senting and evaluating scenarios for the 

years up to 2030.

Regarding the well- to-wheels energy and CO2 data, the study realized by the JEC consortium 

(formed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Car 
Association EUCAR, and the European refineries association CONCAWE) represents the 

reference information for the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 calculations of the current and 
future liquid fossil fuels. 
 

 

The Eurostat 
 
The Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union which provides to the Community 
the European statistics, enabling the comparisons betwee n countries and regions. These are 

key informations for decision- makers at EU and Member State level, in business and corporate 
organisations, and on other hand to the public and media for accurate picture of contemporary 

society and to evaluate the performance of the economy.  
Each Member State?s national authorities collect their national statistics, verifying and 
analysing national data and reporting them to the Eurostat. Eurostat?s role is therefore to 

consolidate the data and ensure they are comparable, using harmonized methodology. 
Currently, the Eurostat is the only provider of statistics at European level.  

 
The Eurostat energy data 

The energy data provided by the Eurostat presents an o utline tree organization, divided in 

three categories:  
1) “Energy quantities” 

2) “Energy prices”  
3) “Energy degree-days” 

 

For purposes of this dissertation, the “Energy quantities” tab is the most important as it 
provides all energy quantities currently in use at the EU. This tab is divided in four categories: 

1) “Supply, transformation and consumption”  
2) “Infrastructures” 
3) “Imports” 

4) “Exports” 
 

Under the “Supply, transformation and consumption” tab, the Eurostat provides data on “Final 
Energy Consumption”, which is sub-divided in its main final energy consumption sectors : 

1) “Industry” 

2) “Household”  
3) “Transport” 

 
For the Transport sector, the energy data is provided in a detailed picture on final consumption 
data from its main modes – air, rail, road and sea. For each mode, it is possible to obtain 

detailed information by energy type – kerosene, diesel, electricity, gasoline, LPG, natural gas 
and biofuels. Electricity used in the rail sector as well as diesel used in road sector are two 

examples showing the level of detail of the Eurostat energy transport data.

The major European transport studies 
 
The iTREN2030 project 

 

The iTREN2030, Integrated Transport and Energy baseline until 2030, is a major study 
developed by the Transport and Mobility of Leuven, Belgium, and the Fraunhofer Institut, 

Germany. It is the result of an integrated work gathering several European energy and policy 
models such as the Astra, the Poles, the Trans- Tools and the Tremove [14]: 

1) The Astra model provides the demographic and economic framework conditions 
for the EU27 as well as scenario results for transport and energy demand, selected 
items of vehicle fleets (e.g. new technology vehicles) and of transport demand (e.g. 

slow modes) [14]; 
2) The Poles model provides an estimation of energy prices including carbon prices 

and changes of fuel taxes as well as energy demand of sectors other than transport 
and the rest of the world [14]; 

3) The Trans-Tools model provides the transport demand by mode on a link-based 

network level for EU-27 [14]; 
4) The Tremove model calculates vehicle fleets of conventional vehicles with a 

detailed technology classification, transport energy demand and transport 
emissions for EU-27+4 [14]. 

 

The iTREN2030 forecasts and assesses the capabilities of the mentioned models to the new 
policy issues arising from the technology, environment and energy fields. It individually 

studies the national Member States and agglomerates an EU27 picture [14]. 
For purposes of this dissertation, this study was considered as an important source of 
information as it provides values for passenger mobility and energy demand, and associated 

CO2 emissions for several sub-modes of transport.  
 

 
The TREMOVE 

 

The Tremove is a major European transport and e nergy model developed by the Transport and 
Mobility of Leuven, Belgium, representing one of the most complete and comprehensive 

databases for fleet composition at European level.  
It is also a policy assessment model tha t studies the effects of different transport and 
environment policies on the emissions of the transport sector. It estimates the transport 

demand, modal shifts, vehicle stock and the emissions of air pollutants, according to adopted 
policies for road pricing, public transport pricing, emission standards, subsidies for cleaner 

cars, etc. The model covers passenger and freight transport in 31 European countries and 
covers the period 1995-2030 [15]. 
 

The output of the Tremove model is divided into three categories [15]:  
1) Demand: it provides information on passenger mobility and freight transport in 

figures of passengers-km and tonnes-km, occupancy rate, fuel type; 



State of Art 

 

24 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

2) Stock: it provides information on road and rail vehicle stock per country, fuel type 

and vehicle technology; 
3) Emissions: it provides information on fuel consumption and pollutant type. 

 
Within its website it is possible to download the spreadsheet files with the data for each 
considered 31 countries however an EU27 conglomerated picture is not possible to find.  

For purposes of this dissertation, this model was considered as an important source of 
information as it provides information on rail and road fleet composition by fuel type, 

separated by passenger mobility and freight transport demand.  
 
 

The EX-TREMIS 

 

The Ex-Tremis model is a reference database on fleet and transport activity data, specific 
energy consumption, emission factors and total emissions for the non-road transport modes, 
such as maritime, rail and aviation. It covers all EU27 member states from the year 1980 and 

provides projections for their developments up to 2030 [16]. 
For purposes of this dissertation, this model was considered as an important source of 

information as it provides information on rail energy consumption for passenger mobility and 
freight transport, separated by energy type.  
 

 

The JEC Well-to-Wheels 
 
The well-to-wheel analysis conducted by the JEC consortium focus on the estimation of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption and industrial costs of all automotive 

fuels and power trains options, for the European car fleet in the period 2010-2020 [17].  
The study is an integrated research work evolving periodic updates and incorporating potential 

refining and other process improvements reported by the relevant  stakeholders (e.g. car OEMs, 
refineries, industry, etc) as well as energy and industrial policy regulators [17]. 
It should be clarified that in the case of the JEC  Well-to-Wheel report and for purposes of this 

dissertation, the well- to-wheel approach differs from a life-cycle analysis, as it does not 
consider neither the energy consumption nor the GHG emissions involved in the construction 

of the facilities, manufacturing vehicles or end of life aspects. Therefore, the JEC Well-to-
Wheel only considers the steps as [17]: 

1) Fuel production (well-to-tank) 

2) Vehicle use (tank-to-wheel) 
 

Scope and methodology 

The well-to-tank evaluation accounts for the energy expended and the associated GHG emitted 
in the steps required to deliver the finished fuel into the on-board tank of a vehicle. It covers 

all steps from extracting, capturing, producing, manufacturing and transporting the fuel into 
the pump station [17].

Milton Grácio Catarino  25 

 

On the JEC Well-to-Wheels study, the well- to-tank analysis does not consider the energy or 

the GHG emissions associated with construction or decommissioning of plants and vehicles. 
The non-consideration is explained by the JEC consortium with two main reasons: first the 

available data is often sketchy and uncertain; second the impact of these additional energy 
requirements on the total pathway balance is generally small and within the range of 
uncertainty of the total estimations [17]. 

The tank-to-wheel evaluation accounts for the energy expended and the associated GHG 
emitted by the vehicle- fuel combinations. It measures the energy consumption and GHG 

emitted when the vehicle is performing the N EDC driving cycle, as a reference for 
homologation values.  As it is described on the  Well-to-Wheels report, the results announced 
on the tables do not and do not attempt to reproduce the average European car fleet [17]. 

 
The results of the energy and GHG well- to-wheels figures combine the well- to-tank expended 

energy, excluding the energy content of the fuel itself, per energy content of the fuel (LHV 
basis), with the tank-to-wheel energy consumed by the vehicle per unit of distance covered (on 
the NEDC cycle) [17]. 

As primary energy sources, the JEC Well-to-Wheel considers oil, coal, natural gas, biomass, 
wind and nuclear; and as automotive fuels, it considers gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum 

gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), compressed hydrogen and biofuels. As power 
trains, it considers the conventional spark ignition gasoline and CNG, the compression ignition 
diesel, and fuel cell vehicles [17].

The results are divided on the two phases of the fuel chain: well- to-tank and tank-to-wheel, 

showing both the energy consumption of the vehicle (MJ/100km) and the associated GHG  
emissions (gCO2eq/km).  

The presented results do  not make any differentiation between the European refineries or the 
outside EU refineries, providing only average European values for the production and 
distribution of the fuels.  

 
For purposes of this dissertation, the JEC Well- to-Wheels was considered an important source 

of information as it provides average European va lues for the different phases of the fossil 
fuels chain. 
 

 

2.2. The White Paper 
 
One of the most relevant legislative and assessment documents at the European level is the 
White Paper for the future of Transport. Developed by the European Commission, the White 

Paper plans the policies and draws the roadmap for the transport sector expected in a period of 
10-years. In March 2011, the latest White Paper was published at the European Commission 

platform, outlining what is expected to be the transport?s planning for the next decade [7]. 
 
The White Paper first characterizes the major challenges that the transport sector is currently 

facing, and then characterizes the main measures that should be implemented to tackle those 
challenges. Additionally, it develops three different policies scenarios, assessing the individual 

impact that those scenarios have on the final transport situation both by 2020 and long-term 
vision by 2050. 
 

Major challenges  

One of the main challenges that the European Commission published in the White Paper is the 

expected increase in the transport demand, both in cases of passenger mobility and freight 
transport. The modelling projections realized by the European Commission shows that, in a no 
policy change scenario (“business as usual”), the total transport activity is expected to 

continue to grow in line with economic activity. Total passenger mobility activity would 
increase by 51% between 2005 and 2050, while freight transport activity would go up by 82%  

[7]. 
 
In the same context o f growing demand for transport, the associated final energy consumption 

is projected to increase by 5% by 2030 and an additional 1% by 2050, driven mainly by 
aviation and road freight transport. However, and in a particular segment, the energy use of 

passenger cars would drop by 11% between 2005 and 2030. Renewables would represent 10% 
of the total energy for transport by 2020, reflecting the implementation of the renewable 
energy directive 2009/28/EC. The electrification in the transport sector is projected to remain 

slow in the reference scenario, once electric vehicles are predicted to not make significant 
contributions till 2050 [7].

Milton Grácio Catarino  27 

 

As major conclusions, the White Paper says that in case of a business as usual, the EU 

transport system would remain continuously dependent on the usage of fossil fuels, in 
particular the oil products, representing 90% of transport needs. In the case of modal-shift, 

once the business as usual does not make any policy changes, the modal-shift shares would not 
drastically change compared to the reference scenario. The road sector would therefore remain 
the dominant mode in both freight and passenger transport [7]. 

 
Key measures  

The deployment of the rail segment is expected to constitute of the main changes that might be 
in place for the next decades. In particular the growing infrastructure on the high-speed rail 
segment, as well as the expected shift from road freight into rail freight for distances over 

300km, would contribute to reduce CO2 emissions. The implementation of a financial 
environmental approach for transport charges, such as the “polluter pays” and “user pays” 

principles, are also seen as key measures for regulating the profile pattern usage of the 
transport system [7]. 
 

Tackling the urban areas challenges is also foreseen as crucial for future of transport. As key 
parts of the 2050 strategy is, on one hand, the move towards the objective of phasing out the 

conventional fuelled cars in cities by 2050, with a shift into electric, hydrogen and hybrid cars, 
as well as in other hand, an increase on the modal-shift into public and collective transport 
modes. Here, the EU strategic transport technology plan (STTP) is currently giving research 

support for the deployment of lower emission transport modes for cities, intra-urban and long-
distance transport [7]. 

 
As a part of the STTP, is the development of transport audit services for Member States for 
their city planning. For doing so, the European Commission is expecting to introduce 

procedures and financial assistance for the development  of urban mobility audits plans.  This 
will provide to the interested  Member States a tool to plan their urban transport system with 

the objective of finding a best “cost-effective” solution for each city. As additional 
information, the city planning would be effective through the implementation of schemes such 
as the access restriction of polluter vehicles, congestion taxes, incentives to modal-shift, 

allowing the uptake of low emission vehicles [7]. 
 

Resume of the policy scenarios  

The European Commission de veloped different policy option (PO) scenarios: the business as 
usual (PO1), PO2, PO3 and PO4. The impacts were studied on a long-term basis, by 2050. 

The PO2 was designed to show the effect in case of relying less on performance standards 
(technological deployment), and more on managing mobility and on carbon pricing. In this 

scenario the Commission assumed that car O EMs would still perform the 95gCO2/km b y 
2020, and that the carbon pricing will reach very high levels. Here, the effect of a high carbon 
price is viewed as an equivalent effect to the restriction on the usage of fossil transport modes, 

favouring the increase in modal-shift into collective modes[7]. 
The PO3 was designed to show the effect of policies that emphasise the rapid deployment of 

new powertrains, by imposing demanding CO2 requirements for new vehicles. It can be 
viewed as a low emission vehicle policy oriented scenario (technological deployment) [7]. 



State of Art 

 

28 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Finally, the PO4 was designed to represent a medium approach from the last two scenarios 

(the PO2 and PO3). It presents intermediate low emission requirements and a carbon pricing 
only at the urban areas context [7]. 

Table 3 provides the summary of the main results from the comparison of the three scenarios.

As the Commission concluded, the table shows that from an economic view point, the PO4 

seems to be overall preferable [7].  
From a social view point, the Commission concluded that the PO4 would be the most 

desirable. Compared to the PO2, it does not affect drastically the present lifestyles and 
organisation of society and is therefore expected to have lower social costs of adaptation to 
new circumstances [7]. 

From an environmental view point, the PO2 is the most ambitious option since it covers all 
range of environmental impacts [7]. 

 
 

White Paper conclusions 

In general terms, the modelling activity realized by the European Commission showed that 
several policy instruments need to be used to put the transport system on a sustainable path, 

lowering CO2 emissions, oil dependency and congestion. It a lso showed that policy action 
needs to be very ambitious to reach the long-term 2050 objective [7]. 
As a brief comment and own estimation, the Commission discards the PO3 despite being the 

less expensive option to reach the long-term 60% reduction objective. The Commission says 
that it assumed a high degree of uncertainty associated with technological developments on 

the transport sector [7]. 
 
 

2.3. Technical variables 
 

The presentation of the state of art in what regards to the technical variables attempts to show 
the past and likely future trends on technical variables uptake. It was not always possible to 
find the average European situation for each technical variable, being therefore presented 

studies that were realized for the individual Member State reality. 
 

 

Energy efficiency 
 
In relation to the efficiency of the vehicle fleet, attention is allocation to two studies realized 
on the topic. O ne regards specifically to the Austrian automotive sector and the other regards 

to the Danish and Greek case.  
 

 
The Austrian case 

The study realized by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), analyzed the 

evolving technological profile of the Austrian passenger car fleet from the years of 1990 to 
2007. The motivation of the study was to evaluate the effect of the determinants of the 

passenger car fleet, such as the level of car ownership, the pattern of vehicle usage and the 
technical performance of the vehicle fleet, on the passenger car related CO2 emissions [18].

Despite their consideration for the same year-scope, the year of 2007, for purposes of this 

dissertation this article was considered as important since it individually analyzed both the 
gasoline and diesel car fleet. Here, the article analyses the impacts of the consumer choice of 

specific car models, behavioural aspects and technological characteristics that together shaped 
the scope of the Austrian vehicle fleet fuel efficiency.  
The author first developed an Austria fleet database with the registered car models and 

collected information on the equivalent technical charac teristics (power, engine size, weight, 
fuel consumption, by fuel type). Then, the author assessed the influence of the climate 

oriented policies on the overall fuel efficiency of the passenger car fleet.  
 
As main conclusions, the article first concluded that in parallel to the European dieselization 

trend, also in Austria the diesel passenger car fleet has been gaining relevant market shares. In 
1990, the Austria diesel car fleet represented about 14%, increasing to 54% in 2007. 

According to the calculations, the diesel car fleet showed an annual average efficiency 
improvement of 1,03%, while the gasoline car fleet presented annual efficiency improvements 
in the order of 1,56%. These two improvements amounted to a reduction in fuel consumption 

per 100km by 16% for diesels and 23,7% for gasoline cars, within the observation period 
1990-2007 [18]. 

New registration fuel efficiency use was reduced from an average of 7,1l/100km to about 
6l/100km on the diesel fleet, and from 9,1l/100km to 7l/100km on gasoline fleet. For the total 
fleet, the improvement on the new sales reduced, in average, approximately 2l/100km on 17 

years, annually 1,67%. In 2007, the average registration car fleet showed a CO2 emission of 
about 163gCO2/km,  where the diesel average was of 160gCO2/km and the gasoline of 

165gCO2/km [18]. 
 
Finally, the study also concluded that this improvement was mainly motivated by government 

policies. Favourable vehicle and fuel taxation for diesels together with the maturing of diesel 
technology from car OEMs stimulated the popularity of diesel across all market segments. The 

sustained diesel growth was thus stimulated by a successful combination of demand pull and 
supply push policies [18]. 
Due this situation, the study concluded that the diesel penetration is an excellent practice 

example for studying the market diffusion of a new combustion system and might therefore be 
considered in assisting the promotion of energy efficiency systems such as hybrids, electric 

and natural gas cars [18]. 
 
 

The Danish and the Greek case 

The study realized by the Laboratory of Industrial &amp;amp; Energy Eco nomics, School of C hemical 

Engineering and the National Technical University of Athens, analyses the decomposition of 
the changes in CO2 emissions from passenger cars in Denmark and Greece, for the period 
between 1990 and 2005. These two countries were selected based on their socio-economic 

differences and the availability of data used in the analysis. In both countries, the article says 
that passenger cars are responsible for about half of the emissions from road transport, which 

is viewed by the author as a similar profile to the EU15 member states [19].

Milton Grácio Catarino  31 

 

The article also studied the influence of factors such as the activity in terms of vehicle-km, 

annual mileage and the fuel mix on the profile transport CO2 emissions, and how it affected 
the average fuel efficiency evolution of the car fleet [19]. 

Table 4 summarizes the main results achieved on this article in what regards to the average 
fuel efficiency for the diesel and gasoline car fleet.

Gasoline cars 8,1 7,8 7,6 7,5 

Diesel cars 6,9 6,8 7,3 7,7 

 

 
The study concluded that higher average fuel consumption rates for gasoline cars of all engine 
sizes were observed in Greece, reflecting the higher share of cars with older technological 

standards. In Denmark, the study concluded that has been more penetration of new cars, which 
reached an 80% compliance with EURO standards in 2005 [19]. 

On the diesel side, the study concluded that in Greece the higher engine capacity constitute the 
majority since the 1990s, influencing thus the average fuel consumption of the entire diesel 
category of passenger cars [19]. 

 
In general terms, the average fuel consumption of the entire fleet has decreased in both 

Denmark and Greece, by 4% and 7%, respectively. In the case of Greece, there has been an 
increasing penetration of bigger cars (&gt;2.0l), in terms of engine size, however the share of cars 
with engine size more than 2.0l is still less than 4%, while the respective fraction in Denmark 

is close to 10%, increased by 6 percentage units since 1990. Here, the article concluded that 
this shift to bigger cars in Denmark is the determinant for the restrained decline of the average 
fuel intensity of the fleet, compared to Greece [19]. 

 
 

New powertrains and energies 
 

Within the most popular new powertrains that might come in a massive way for the decades to 
come are the hybrid, electric and hydrogen vehicles. The number of studies assessing on their 
energy and CO2 impact have been rapidly increasing within the scientific community.  

 
The Department of Electrical Engineering and Energy Technology from the Vrije Universiteit 

Brussel, Belgium, published an article [20] on the topic of which energy source for road 
transport. The objective of the study was to compare the battery and hybrid electric vehicles 



State of Art 

 

32 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

with conventional vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles on the basis of the well- to-wheel 

energy consumption.  
The study states that considerable research is still to be performed for improving the 

thermodynamics features of the conventional combustion engines. It also says that after 2010, 
hybrids and other alternative solutions could reach a share of 15% increasing up to 25% after 
2020 [20].  

 
On the topic of hybrid, electric and fuel cell systems, the study highlights the high energy 

consumption reduction that is possible to achieve by electric vehicles when compared to IC E?s, 
about 40-50% on a well-to-wheel basis. However, the study also highlights that this value can 
be optimized if taking the real working pattern of the electric vehicle, which influences the 

motor design and power electronic design [20]. 
On the topic of hybrid vehicles, the study says that this solution allows the usage of the engine 

in better efficiency working zones, which enables a tank-to-wheel energy reduction of about 
30%, being the reduction dependent on the grade of hybridisation (partial, mid or full hybrid ) 
[20]. 

 
On the topic of fuel cell electric vehicles, the study concluded that the tank-to-wheel energy 

efficiencies need to differentially be considered when comparing to ICE?s. On one hand, fuel 
cell vehicles using compressed hydrogen can provide a 42% tank-to-wheel energy reduction, 
while hydrogen fuel cell produced by an on-board methanol reformer can reach a reduction of 

32% [20].  
 

Despite the limitations in what regards batteries development and availability of infrastructure, 
the study also concluded that from a well- to-wheel emission point of view, the results were 
positive and in favour of the electric vehicle. The electric vehicle is viewed by the article as an 

optimum solution for urban mobility as it emits no exhaust gases. In what regards thermal-
hybrid vehicles, the study concluded that the main advantage of this combination is the 

permanent interaction between the highly efficient electric sys tem and the thermal engine. Due 
that dual function, hybrid vehicles have a longer range than electric vehicles, being able to 
offer the option of running on electricity alone in urban environments so producing locally 

zero emissions. The hybrid technology is now particularly favoured for heavy-duty vehicles 
such as city-buses and leads to 20 % reduction in both energy consumption and CO2 emissions  

[20].

2.4. Non-technical variables 
 

Modal-shift 
 
The energy and CO2 impacts resulting from a scenario where modal-shift policies would be 

put in place was recently assessed by the Energy Technology Policy Division of the 
International Energy Agency in Paris [21].  
The article assesses the modal-shift worldwide impacts on energy and CO2 at the transport 

sector level. A set of projections for the year of 2050 were developed, of which the “Baseline” 
and the “BLUE shift”. The paper described the likely energy and CO2 reduction if a shift from 

car and air travel relative to the “Baseline” will be in place by 2050. For purposes of this 
dissertation, this article was of important both from an absolute quantity view point, and from 
a conceptual and methodology view point [21]. 

 
To evaluate the modal-shift impacts, the article used the mobility model MoMo to quantify the 

energy usage and GHG emissions from the transport sector, till 2050. As a brief description, 
the MoMo model consists in a spreadsheet aimed at estimating and projecting travel indicators, 
energy consumption, pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas generated from worldwide 

mobility. The basic structure of the model calculates the energy use as a function of energy/km 
x km/vehicle x number of vehicles. Since the MoMo model contains elasticity capabilities, the 

study used those capabilities to develop “what- if” scenarios, changing travel projections and 
evaluating the energy and CO2 impacts [21]. 
 

The paper described the methodology used for each global region such as America, Asia or 
Europe, through the consultation of original databases for each region, gathering all the 
information related to vehicle characteristics, driving patterns, energy types, etc. The resulting 

base year (2005) picture for passe nger travel by mode per capita is shown in Figure 7 [21]. 
 

 
Figure 7 – [SoA] P assenger mobility per capita per  worl d region [21].

Having developed the characteristic year, the study continues to project a modal-shift scenario. 
To model the modal shifts, the study explains that a new module has been added into the 

MoMo aiming to quantify the energy use and GHG emissions. Changing modal travel shares, 
using total passenger-km per year, by mode and also by region, were the basis factors for the 
analysis. Also, absolute indicators such as the quantity of passengers-km were split into urban 

or non- urban areas, using percentage levels extracted from national surveys [21]. 
 

It will be not characterized each assumption that the study assumed for each world region, but 
only to characterize the OECD Europe, as representative of the European Union life style 
pattern. 

On the case of OEC D Europe, the study assumes an urban rail travel by 2050 to be nearly 
100% higher in the “BLUE Shift” scenario when compared to the Baseline, while urban bus 

travel was assumed to be 50% higher. For the non-urban travel, the growth in air travel is cut 
by half, doubling in the “BLUE shift” scenario rather than tripling as it does in the Baseline, 
and intercity rail travel triples when compared to 2005 and doubles when compared to the 

Baseline 2050 [21].  
Regarding specifically the passenger car sector, in both regions (O ECD and non-OECD), the 

study says that reductions in car travel were allocated partially to a reduction in vehicle stocks 
and partially to a reduction in travel per vehicle [21]. 
 

As general results from the study, the Figure 8 shows the results of a “BLUE shift” scenario 
compared to the Baseline.  

 

 
Figure 8 – [SoA] GHG e missions scenario comparison  [21]. 

 

 
As general conclusions of interest for this dissertation, the study first concluded that given a 

25% reduction in car and air travel in 2050, it could be potentially possible a 20% reduction in 
energy consumption and CO2 emissions compared to the Baseline. However, the study also 
concluded that these reductions would only be possible if strong policies would be put in place 

to guide the transport system in this modal share mix.

High-speed rail 
 
A study realized by the Division of Environmental Strategies Research from the Royal 

Institute of Technology, Sweden [22], assessed on the role of the high-speed rail segment in 
mitigating climate change. The study focused on the modal-shift from air and road travel into 
high-speed rail, both for the purposes of passenger mobility and freight transport. It assessed 

particularly to the Swedish case, saying that it can potentially be extended to the European 
reality. 

 
For doing so, the article presents two different scenarios: the “Reference” and the “HSR and 
Freight measures”. The “Reference” scenario means the scenario where no high-speed rail 

infrastructure is implemented, and the “HSR and Freight measures” means the scenario where 
the proposed high-speed line is constructed with some additional incentive measures to usage 

of the remaining conventional rail lines to freight transport. The study expects that in a general 
view point the construction of the high-speed line offers the potential for an extension of the 
conventional rail lines to increase the capacity for freight trains and regional trains [22]. 

 
In all the scenarios for 2025/2030, the study considers the likely transports journeys that the 

proposed high-speed line might serve: to Denmark, to Germany and to the Netherlands. For 
these services, the article resumes the assumptions taken in what regards the market share of 
high-speed rail in two tracks: 80% for Stockholm- Gothenburg, 65% for Stockholm-Malmo. It 

also compares to other services in Europe such as Madrid-Seville 84%, Paris- Lyon 90%. As a 
first step in the methodology, the Table 5 presents the differences between the analyzed 

scenarios in terms of passengers-km for each analyzed transport sub- mode [22]. 
 

Table 5 – [SoA] P assenger and freight de mand by scenario [22].

Train 27,1 36,8 46,4 

Truck 47,1 52,7 44,6 

Ship 35,2 38,2 36,8 

 
 

According to the original forecast, the shift from car travel to rail seems to be the highest, the 
study concluded. The study assumed that the proposed high-speed line would cause a 50% 

shift from car to rail, meaning about 15% of long-distance car travel over 100km shifting to 
rail, in line with other studies mentioned in the article [22].

As a final step and of interest for this dissertation, the study presents the specific energy use 

and greenhouse gas emissions for propulsion and fuel life cycle. The study collected external 
data sources for tank-to-wheel energy consumption for the modes of airplanes and passenger 

cars, and assumed the electric trains energy consumption own values [22]. 
 
Table 6 shows the results of the study in the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm or ton.km, 

for passenger and freight transportation.

The study concluded that the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm of electric train would be 
as about 8gCO2/pkm, compared to the 63gCO2/pkm of a passenger car, and the 

150gCO2/pkm of the considered airplane model [22].  
As an additional and important factor, the study also allowed gaining the conscience that 

biofuels are much more carbon intense in what regards the fuel product ion (well-to-tank) 
when compared to the conventional fossil fuels.  
 

 

2.5. Addressing 2020 objectives 
 
The need for a high technical deployment and shift for transport?s energy future was recently 

assessed by the Institute of Energy Economics and Rational Use of Energy (IER), from 
Stuttgart, Germany [23], which projected four different scenarios for future of energy?s sector 
(industry, household and transport). The scenarios named the “Reference” (business as usual), 

the “450ppm” (climate protection), the “OLGA” (climate protection + securit y of supply), and 
the “O LGA_NUC ” (climate protection + security of supply + enhanced nuclear energy), 
projects the likely energy and CO2 situation that might be in place by 2050.  

 
Compared to the “Reference” scenario and despite the efficiency improvements of the vehicles 

used, the final energy consumption of the transport sector will likely increase from the 
reference level of 14.620PJ to a business as usual scenario of 19.612PJ expected by 2050. The 
main driver contributing for this increase is the expected strong growth of transport services, 



State of Art 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  37 

 

especially in road freight transport and aviation. It is also expected that motorised individual 

transport will strongly increase in newer member states (EU12) in parallel with a slight growth 
in older member states (EU15). The projected disproportionately high increase in the usage of 

diesel in transport is based on the expected rising transport services in road freight transport 
while, at the same time, the replacement of gasoline cars by diesel ones. The promotion of 
alternative fuelled cars such as natural gas and LPG is seen as remaining with marginal market 

shares [23]. 
 

In the “450ppm” scenario, the final energy consumption in the transport sector resulted in few 
differences for the years until 2030 compared to the reference scenario.  In 2030, an increasing 
usage of biofuels, especially second generation biofuels can likely be observed. Here, the 

consumption of biofuels occurs basically in addition to conventional gasoline and diesel, in a 
blend mixture. For other energy carriers like hydrogen, the study expects that after 2040 it will 

become more popular as fuel cell vehicles starts to gain relevant market shares. The increasing 
use of electricity is expected to be verified, once the deployment of the electric and plug in 
hybrid vehicles segment start to spread [23]. 

In absolute numbers, the final energy consumption of the transport sector is expected to be 
reduced under the conditions of a climate protection scenario compared to the business as 

usual development till 2030. In 2050, the total final energy consumption in the climate 
protection scenario is about 14% lower (2.688PJ) compared to the business as usual one [23]. 
 

The final energy consumption till 2020 is just slightly different in the “OLGA” scenario 
compared to the others. The additional restrictions of a security of supply scenario in te rms of 

limited oil imports result in a decreasing usage of petroleum based fuels. In the other scenarios 
(excluding business as usual), the vehicle stock in 2050 is expected to be dominated by fuel 
cell and electric vehicles as well as plug in hybrids. The share of diesel vehicles restricted to 

road freight transportation and bus transport remains high [23]. 
 

In relation to the likely CO2 reductions, the study concluded that in case of a climate 
protection scenario in combination with a higher oil price, the CO2 avoidance costs could 
eventually lead, for example, for the earlier penetration of biofuels in the transport sector. It 

could be potentially possible to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in the non-ETS 
sector, albeit not enough to meet the 10% under the European C limate Energy Package. In the 

“OLGA” scenario, the non-ETS sector could reach and overtake the 10% reduction objective, 
as the study calculated a potential 22% reduction. On an “OLGA_NUC ” scenario, the study 
calculated a potential 19% greenhouse gas reduction, lower when compared to the “OLGA” 

due the reduction achieved by the ETS sector (nuclear power favours the electricity 
greenhouse gas reduction) [23].

3. Methodology 
 
The study of the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of technical 

and non-technical measures requires the development of an interactive tool, allowing the 
manipulation of several variables associated to the transport sector.  

For purposes of this dissertation, technical measures are those which refer to the energy 
efficiency, the renewable energies and new power trains; while the non-technical measures 
refers to the modal-shift into collective transport modes, including the deployment of the high-

speed rail segment. All measures should interact together and across all transport modes, 
allowing its individual manipulation leading to the assessment on the well- to-wheel energy 

and CO2 impacts. Resulting from the combination of all measures, will be possible to build a 
best future scenario for 2020.  
 

In this chapter it will be characterized the adopted model structure, the mindset and calculation 
flow, as well as the main assumptions behind the calculations.  

 
 

3.1. The model’s structure 
 
It was decided to set up a model structure based on the format of a spreadsheet bringing 

together all the technical and non-technical variables that influence the transport?s 
performance. Two spreadsheets were developed for this purpose: one for energy consumption 
and other for CO2 emissions. 

 
After several improvements and considering potential new inputs, it was decided to display on 

the left side all the transport modes, their respective sub-modes, powertrains and energy 
carriers; and on the top side the other variables such as the energy and CO2 efficiency, the 
occupancy rate, the passenger mobility and  freight transport information, all separated in a 

well-to-wheel basis. Figure 134 and Figure 135 of Annexes show the complete format.  
 

 

3.1.1. The left side 
 

On the left side of each table it is possible to visualize the divisio n into the considered  
transport modes (air, rail, road and sea), their respective sub- modes (e.g. metro, normal-speed, 

bus, car, etc), powertrains and energy carriers (e.g. gasoline, diesel, electric, etc). Figure 9 
describes the sub- modes analyzed for each transport mode.

Air sector 

In spite of the future inclusion of the air sector into the ETS by 2012, it was not required to 

deeply study its details on energy and CO2 quantities between the most used airplanes, as well 
as no differentiation on helicopters or other type of recreational craft. It was assumed that all 

air transport sub- modes are included in a general category. This decision was supported both 
by the general knowledge and by observation of the current air transport situation, which tells 
that is enough reasonable to assume that these modes represent a minimum fraction o f the total 

air energy, CO2 and passenger mobility picture.  
Figure 10 shows the way on how the air sector was divided.

Rail sector 

For the rail sector case, it was decided to c haracterize the individual contribution of the main 
rail sub- modes currently in use : metro/tram, normal- and high-speed rail, by energy type. It 

was assumed that only electricity and diesel are currently being consumed by the rail sector, 
ignoring the consumption of solid fuels, as they represent a minimum fraction on the total rail 
energy, 0,06% [11]. O n the passenger mobility and freight transport scene, it was decided that 

only normal-speed rail is currently being used for freight transport purposes, while metro/tram, 
normal- and high-speed is used for passenger mobility purposes.  

Figure 11 shows the way on how the rail sector was divided. 
 
 

 
Figure 11 – [Methodol ogy] Rail sector details . 

 

 
Road sector 

For the road sector case, the objective was to individual study the details of the road passenger 
mobility, in particular the bus and the car sub- modes, and the contribution of the road freight 
transport to the total energy and CO2 picture. The consideration of passenger sub- modes such 

as motorcycle and passenger vans was influenced by the Tremove model, as it was the base  
source used for the development and characterization of the road fleet composition.  

The analysis of the road freight transport for the total road energy and CO2 picture is grouped 
in the “Freight” category. Here, the objective was not the study of the differences between 
heavy or light duty trucks, being everything included on the same category.  

Figure 12 shows the way on how the road sector was divided.

Sea sector 

For this dissertation only the contribution to the total transport energy and CO2 picture of the 
sea sector was calculated. Here, it was assumed that all energy carriers currently used in the 

sea sector such as gasoline, diesel and residual oil fuel, are considered as diesel. Those

quantities were therefore added into a single energy category. Figure 13 shows the way on 

how the sea sector was divided.

3.1.2. The top side 
 

In order to study the differences between the energy and CO2 efficiencies, on the top side of 
each table are displayed the concepts of well- to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well- to-wheel, both in 

terms of energy and CO2 per km and per pkm. In parallel to this, the top side was also 
designed to characterize the passenger mobility and freight transport demand, and finally to 
evaluate the total energy and CO2 quantities. Figure 14 shows on how the top side is divided: 

 

 
Figure 14 – [Methodol ogy] Org anigram of the top side.  

 

 
Energy and CO2 efficiency 

The objective of this category is to evaluate the efficiency in terms of energy and CO2 per km 

(MJ/km, gCO2/km) and per pkm (MJ/pkm, gCO2/pkm), in all phases of the fuel chain: well-
to-tank (WTT), tank-to-wheel (TTW) and well-to-wheel (WTW). Figure 15 shows the table:

Additionally, two columns were introduced to evaluate and compare the energy and CO2 
efficiency differences given a certain level of renewable energies penetration. The columns 

named as “wo RE” (without renewable energy) and “w RE” (with renewable energy) can be 
visualized under each phase of the fuel chain. Figure 17 highlights both cases.

Passenger mobility &amp;amp; freight transport 

The objective of this category is to evaluate both the total volume of passenger mobility and 

freight transport demand, and the characterization of the passenger mobility distribution 
according to the driving domain: “Short”, “Medium” and “Long” distance.  Here, “Short” 

regards the passenger mobility done within the urban areas, “Medium” distance regards to the 
passenger mobility done within the rural areas and “Long” regards to the passenger mo bility 
done within the highways, at longer distances. Figure 19 shows the table.

TOTAL Energy/CO2 

The objective of this category is to evaluate the total quantities of energy consumption and 
CO2 emissions from all the transport modes and their respective sub-modes. It was initially 

designed to evaluate the individual contribution from the “well-to-tank”, “tank-to-wheel” and 
“well-to-wheel” phases, and afterwards to distinguish the differences in case of only fossil 
energy consumption (wo RE), and when renewable energies are integrated (w RE).  The 

adopted units were PJ for energy and Mt for CO2 as shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21. 
 

 
Figure 20 – [Methodol ogy] Total energy quantities. 

 
 

 
Figure 21 – [Methodol ogy] Total CO2 quantities. 

 
 

After the definition and characterization of the adopted model?s structure, the methodology 
put in place to calculate and complete the energy and CO2 tables will be explained.  

  
 

3.2. The calculation flow 
 
Building a consistent energy transport model while defining the mathematical relations 

between its parameters, can almost entirely rely on the implemented methodology and 
calculation flow. A large variety of methodologies and calculation flows can be used in 
function of the adopted structure but, for purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to 

respect the previously described structure and re stricting the calculation options to two. 
 

Under the defined structure, in one hand, it can be first introduced the energy efficiency 
factors (energy and CO2 per km) and the total annual mileage (in km), obtaining then a result 
of the total energy consumed through the multiplication of those two inputs. As an example, 

the following equation shows the concept behind this option: 
 

 Eq. 1  

 

 Eq. 2  

 



Methodology 

48 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

On other hand, the energy efficiency can be calculated on the opposite way: first introduce the 

total energy consumption and the total annual mileage, and then obtain a result to the energy 
efficiency through the division of the two inputs: 

 

 Eq. 3  

 

 Eq. 4  

 
 

Figure 22 attempts to describe the two possible calculation flows: 

 

  
 

Figure 22 – [Methodol ogy] Calcul ation flow opti ons.  

 
  

As it was explained on the State of Art, the Eurostat data on energy consumption and transport 

statistics was consider as the most representative source of data for the current European 
situation. Hence, its information on energy consumption quantities refers to the total tank-to-

wheel energy consumption and therefore  the methodology and calculation flow selected was 
the second on the previous Figure 22. 
 

Thus, the decision was to start with the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the 
Eurostat, divide it by the Eurostat passenger mobility data, and obtain a result for the energy 

efficiency, in terms of energy per pkm.

3.2.1. The need to resort to external sources 
 
For the purpose of this dissertation the Eurostat data is not enough detailed and does not allow 

by itself to complete the transport model required on this dissertation. The need to input 
external data sources is crucial and its introduction will depend on the availability of the 
Eurostat data and the detail level reached on this dissertation. 

In order to provide a better understanding of which and on where external data sources will be 
required, it will be now explained the overall calculation steps, characterized the available 

Eurostat information and referred where external sources will be introduced.  
 
 

First step 

In a first calculation phase,  if the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 data from the Eurostat 

was divided by the Eurostat passenger mobility data, this would provide a first average tank-
to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency value in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm. 
 

 Eq. 5  

 
 

Second step 

In a second calculation phase, if the previous figure of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm was multiplied 

by the occupancy rate, this would provide an average tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 
efficiency value, in terms of MJ/km and gCO2/km.  
For the purpose of this dissertation, the value of occupancy rate refers to the average number 

of passengers per vehicle (passengers/vehicle) and should be representative of the European 
average situation, per sub- mode of transport. Here, the Eurostat does not provide values  on the 

average number of passengers per vehicle for all sub- modes of transport, creating the need to 
use external sources of data. 

 

 Eq. 6  

 

 

Third step 

In a third calculation phase, if the previous figure of MJ/km and gCO2/km was multiplied by a 
ratio obtained from external sources, this would correspond to the average energy and CO2 

efficiency needed, in terms of energy and CO2 per km, for the production of the necessary 
energy to meet the previously calculated demand tank-to-wheel. Here, the Eurostat does not 
provide values of well- to-tank average energy efficiency per km and therefore external sources 

of data will be required.  
 

 Eq. 7  

 



Methodology 

50 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Fourth step 

In a fourth calculation phase, if summing the previously calculated values of well- to-tank and 
tank-to-wheel, this would provide a well-to-wheel value in terms of energy and CO2 per km. 

 

 Eq. 8  

 
 
Then, through the division of the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel values by the occupancy rate, 

build the correspondent values but now in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm. 
 

 Eq. 9  

 

 Eq. 10 

 
 

Final step 

In a final calculation phase, if multiplying each previously calculated value of well-to-tank and 
well-to-wheel (in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm) by the published Eurostat passenger 

mobility information (pkm), this would provide the total energy values both for the well-to-
tank and the well- to-wheel basis. 

 

 Eq. 11 

 

 Eq. 12 

 
 

As a remember to the reader, doing this calculation with the tank-to-wheel energy per pkm and 
the Eurostat passenger mobility data will result in the Eurostat energy and CO2 values: 

 

 Eq. 13 

 
 

Final comment 

The Eurostat does not provide all the information required for purposes of this dissertation, 
showing a lack of information on all the details associated to the transport?s activity and 

performance. Data such as the European average number of passengers per vehicle, by 
transport sub- mode and by energy type, the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency

per km and per pkm, both by transport sub- mode and by energy type, as well as the passenger 

mobility by energy type, are some of the main variables that the Eurostat does not provide and 
are required for this dissertation. 

The presented calculation flow was the general mindset used  to calculate and construct both 
the energy and CO2 tables required for purposes of this dissertation. However, in function of 
the available data and the required detail level, other methodologies will be used. In that case, 

dedicated explanations will be provided on the dedicated chapters for each sub-mode. 
 

 

3.3. Well-to-wheel scope 
 

The well-to-wheel analysis of the consumed energy by the transport sector accounts the 
energy for the extraction, transportation, refining and the delivery into the pump stations. For 

purposes of this dissertation, evaluating the energy and CO2 well-to-wheels impacts from the 
usage of electricity as energy carrier for transport was also required and hence, the differences 
on the well- to-wheel scope adopted on this dissertation need to be clarified and will be 

explained on this chapter.  
 

 

3.3.1. The JEC well-to-wheel scope 
 
As described before, the “JEC Well- to-Wheels” study [17] was considered a reliable source of 
information for the calculation of well- to-tank average energy efficiency for the common 

motor fuels. According to its definition, it considers all the steps since the extraction until the 
delivery at the pump station, such as the extraction and refinery at the source, the 
transportation of the fuels into the markets (national or regional level), and the distribution 

into the pump stations. Figure 23 shows the adopted scope on the JEC Well- to-Wheels study.

3.3.2. The electricity well-to-wheel scope 
 
The Eurostat electricity consumption data refers to the electric ity delivered on the network and 

available for final consumption. In that case, it was considered on this dissertation that the 
calculation of the well- to-tank energy consumption should consider all the steps from the 
primary energy source to the final consumption. 

It was considered that the calculation should take into account the transmission and 
distribution (T&amp;amp;D) losses from the power plant into the final consumption point,  and the 

efficiency of the EU?s electricity production system. This allows calculating the primary 
energy needed to produce the electricity at the output of the power plant as well as its energy 
losses on the grid. Figure 24 shows the adopted well-to-wheel electricity scope: 

 
 

 
Figure 24 – [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity adopte d well-to-tank scope. 

 
 

The electricity well- to-tank analysis takes into account the primary energy needed at the 
entrance of the power plant, the associated energy efficiency of EU?s power plants, and the 

energy losses at the transmission and distribution lines.  
By its side, the tank-to-wheel electricity consumption refers to the electricity consumed at the 
electricity grid level, b y the train, or electric vehicle. 

 
 

3.3.3. Scope differences 
 

There are two major differences rising up from these considerations: first the “JEC Well-to-
Wheels” study considers the energy needed in the steps of extracting, refining and transporting 
into the pump, in comparison with the no consideration of those steps on the electricity well-

to-tank analysis; second the “JEC Well-to-Wheels” study does not consider the primary 
energy itself (oil) while the considered electricity well- to-tank scope considers it.

The “JEC Well- to-Wheels” scope considers all the steps assoc iated to the extraction, 
transformation and transportation into the final consumption point (the pump station), while 
the adopted electricity well- to-tank scope considers the primary energy needed at the power 

plant, but does not take into account neither the extraction of the primary energy neither its 
transportation into the power plant?s location. This is the main difference between the “JEC” 

scope and the electricity adopted scope.  
 
For purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to use this methodolo gy under the knowledge 

that this consideration might not provide exact and accurate values. Howe ver, it was also 
considered and assumed that the steps of extraction and transportation in the case of electricity 

represent a lower percentage compared to the primary energy itself, meaning that this scope 
potentially provides an acceptable value for the electricity?s well-to-tank. 
 

 

3.3.4. Scope methodology differences 
 
As previously mentioned, it was the objective of this dissertation to provide potential energy 
and CO2 well-to-wheel contributions to the total transport picture. The used methodology to 

reproduce those potentials is explained as follows.  
 

 

Fossil liquid fuels 

 
As described before, it was considered the “JEC Well-to-Wheels” study as reference source on 
the analysis of the well- to-tank liquid fuels. According to the previously presented Table 2, the 

interesting data for purposes of this thesis is as follows:

From this table it is possible to visualize an example of the well- to-wheel energy consumption 
and GHG emissions for the common pathways of each fossil liquid fuel. Data on energy per 

km and CO2eq emissions per km is provided for the well- to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well-to-
wheel basis. 

 
On this dissertation, it was decided to evaluate the well-to-tank impacts on a simple but 
assumed as representative way. It was assumed that the ratio between the well- to-tank and the 

tank-to-wheel, in terms of %, remains constant respecting the tank-to-wheel. It means that the 
well-to-tank energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions vary in the same proportion 

as the tank-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions varies. 
 
As an example, selecting the gasoline 2002 information presented on the previous table, it is 

possible to calculate an average ratio between the well-to-tank and the tank-to-wheel for the 
energy and GHG:

These results means that 13,9% of the energy consumed on the tank-to-wheel, in terms of 

energy/km, corresponds to the well-to-tank energy/km needed to extract, transform and deliver 
the fuel into the pump station. For example, if the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of gasoline 

cars is about 2,8MJ/km, the needed well- to-tank energy efficiency is 0,39MJ/km.  
 

  

 
 

The same logic was applied to the CO2 calculation but with the respective CO2 ratio.  
 
This was the methodology adopted for the well- to-tank calculation of fossil liquid fuels. After 

calculating all ratios for the most common fuel types, it was possible to build a summary table 
with the used ratios on this dissertation.  

 
Note: in the present case the values of 2002 were used for the reference case (2007) and the 
values of 2010 for the 2020 scenarios. Table 9 shows the used ratios on this dissertation:

The higher percentage for the biofuels means the higher energy- intense associated process for 
the extraction, transformation and production compared to the common fossil fuels. It was not 
the objective of this dissertation to explain this difference but, as reference information, it 

potentially indicates the probable premature development state of the associated technologies 
for biofuels production.

The calculation of the CO2 ratios for biofuels depends on the used raw material for bio fuels 

production and the location from where they come. Here, the CO2 factors that are provided by 
the renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC were used. Table 12 shows the adopted biofuels 

CO2 factors:

According to the point number C13 of the Annex V of the renewable energy directive 
(2009/28/EC), it is written that the emissions from the fuel use (tank-to-wheel) shall be taken 

to be zero for the cases of biofuels and bioliquids. Therefore, the presented values on 
gCO2/MJ regard to the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions per unit of consumed tank-to-wheel 
energy. 

 

  

 

  

 

 
Biofuel well-to-tank energy calculation methodology 

 
The previously announced biofuels ratios (in Table 9) of well-to-tank on the tank-to-wheel 
could be directly applied in the case of using a 100% biofuel mixture. In the real and future 

situation, it is likely possible that biofuels will be used in a blend mixture with other fossil 
fuels. In that case, the calculation of the well-to-tank energy and CO2 efficiency per km 

cannot rely on those announced ratios of biofuels but rely on an average calculation between 
the fossil and the biofuels mixture. 
In this dissertation, a simple calculation was adopted in order to determine a contribution from 

the usage of biofuels and consider its energy- intense process. It was decided to consider the 
energy relative weight of fossil and biofuels in the mixture, and apply it to the previously 

calculated ratios. 
 
As an example, if all the gasoline cars consumed about 4.444PJ of energy in 2007, of which 

4.400PJ were gasoline and 44PJ were bioethanol, it means that exists a gasoline and 
bioethanol energy mixture of 99% and 1% respectively.  

 

  

 

 
Taking a tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 2,8MJ/km, the calculation of the well-to-
tank energy efficiency will take into account the percentage of gasoline (99%) and bioethanol 



Methodology 

58 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

(1%) together with the well- to-tank ratios for gasoline (13,9%) and bioethanol (164,1%). Then, 

an average well-to-tank energy value is calculated : 
 

  

 

 
The calculation of the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency is slightly different.  
 

 

Biofuel well-to-tank CO2 calculation methodology 

 
Taking the gasoline example, 202gCO2/km, it was calculated the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency 
from the usage of gasoline, through the usage of the previously calculated CO2 ratios of 

gasoline and bioethanol, together with its percentages in the mixture.  
Here is the calculation of the gasoline contribution: 

 

  

 
 

Then, it was calculated the contribution of the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency from the usage of 

bioethanol. Here, it was first calculated the well- to-tank CO2 efficiency in case of bioethanol 
blend of 100% and then apply the relative energy weight of bioethanol in the mixture. As 

shown before, it was considered bioethano l produced from sugar cane (24gCO2/MJ): 
 

  

 

 
This means that if a gasoline car with the energy efficiency of 2,8MJ/km would run with a 
bioethanol mixture of 100% (only bioethanol), it would release about 67gCO2/km on the well-

to-tank basis. Since the bioethanol mixture is not 100%, it should be calculated with the real 
mixture: 

 

  

 
 

And the final value of well-to-tank CO2 efficiency should be the sum of the gasoline and 

bioethanol contribution: 
 

  



Methodology 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  59 

 

This was a very simple way of calculation adopted on this dissertation. It was decided to take 

this methodology because it respects the limits of having 0% or 100% biofuel mixture, 
providing always the extreme energy and CO2 scenarios.  

On this way of calculation it is being assumed a linearity of energy and CO2 emissions in 
function of the mixture, what for purposes of having mathematical relations on the model, this 
was viewed as a consistent way of providing general valuable results.  

 
 

Electricity 
 
Under the scope limitations described on the previous chapter, the two concepts related to the 
energy losses on the electricity chain regards to the transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) losses, 
and the average energy efficiency of EU?s electricity production system. 

 
According to a report published by ABB Inc. [25], the typical T&amp;amp;D losses on the electricity 

network are in the range of magnitude of 6-8% [25] of the electricity tra nsferred, which 
corresponds to an efficiency of 92-94%. 
 

Regarding the average efficiency of the EU?s electricity production system, the European 
Energy Agency advances a value of 48%  [26] representative of the conventional thermal 

plants in 2007. This figure only includes the combustion thermal plants (coal, gas and oil) and 
excludes other major electricity contributors such as nuclear and hydro.  
Here, given the large contribution of nuclear and to some extend  hydro, the figure of 48% 

could be slightly different as, for example, nuclear?s efficiency can reach higher values.  
Having in mind these limitations, the value of 48% was used on this dissertation, based on the 
consideration that it likely represents the order of magnitude of EU?s situation. 

Figure 25 shows the scope with the assumed values: 
 

 
Figure 25 – [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity W TT efficiency val ues.  

 

 



Methodology 

60 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

For the calculation of the CO2 emissions, it was first necessary to analyze which data could be 

possible to use for this effect. Here, browsing on the Eurostat database, it is possible to extract 
information about the total electricity produced on the EU, and its associated CO2 emissions.  

In 2007, the EU produced 3.362TWh [11] of electricity which emitted about 1.393Mt of CO2 
[11]. With these values, it was possible to build an indicator of the CO2 emissions per unit of 
electricity produced: 

 

  

 

This means that in average, each mega joule of electricity produced within the EU emits about 
115 grams of CO2. The usage of this factor requires the calculation of the respective 

electricity produced at the output plant level, and not the electricity consumed value at the 
transmission line (final point). Figure 26 shows the mindset behind this calculation: 
 

 
Figure 26 – [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity power pl ant output.  

 
 

Imagining the case of electric trains, the calc ulation of its energy consumption at the output of 
the power plant should consider the T&amp;amp;D losses. This means that the tank-to-wheel energy 
consumption (MJ/km) obtained from the calculation on the transport model should be divided 

by 92%, in order to have the correspondent energy consump tion at the output of the power 
plant.

4. Model development and calibration 
 
The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate the construction steps used to calculate the well-

to-tank, the tank-to-wheel and the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiencies (in terms of 
gCO2 and MJ per km and per pkm), the total energy and CO2 quantities for each transport 
mode and sub- mode, and the passenger mobility by energy type also for each sub- mode of 

transport. 
Given the different available data types and the necessary approach for all calculations, 

individual analysis mode-by- mode are presented.  
 
Selecting relevant energy and passenger mobility data, as well as decid ing which assumptions 

should be considered and which assumptions should be ignored, can be viewed as an 
imprecise exercise. In fact, it should be emphasized that for purposes of this dissertation all 

assumptions and considerations are done in a way that allows discovering potential energy 
consumptions as well as potential CO2 emissions, and not to discover exact energy 
consumption neither exact CO2 emissions. It is not  the objective to provide exact values for 

each parameter but to discover potential values for each parameter of each defined transport 
category. 

Besides the fact that all used data is referenced, some assumptions and considerations are done 
under the mindset that “might represent” or „by common understanding”.  
 

 
Presentation of results 

In this chapter the intermediate calculated results for each sub-mode of transport, specifically 
the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 percentage distribution are presented. The used format for 
result presentation will be the as presented in Figure 27.

As an example, here is presented the calculated well-to-wheel CO2 distribution of the normal-

speed rail segment, both for passenger mobility and freight transport.  
 

The inner ring refers to the percentage CO2 distribution of the used energy carriers. In the case, 
32% refer to the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions from diesel, and 68% refer to the well- to-wheel 
CO2 emissions from electricity.  

The second ring refers to the CO2 distribution but separating the well- to-tank and tank-to-
wheel. For example, it is possible to conclude that the well- to-tank CO2 emissions from 

normal-speed diesel correspond to about 5% of the total well- to-wheel CO2 emissions of the 
normal-speed segment. Also, it is possible to see that the electricity CO2 emissions respect 
only to the tank-to-wheel basis, being 68% of the total normal-speed well-to-wheel CO2 

emissions. 
 

 

4.1. Air transport sector 
 

4.1.1. Overview of available and required data 
 

Table 62 on the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data ( in gray) for 
purposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the assumptions taken on this 

dissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat data is enough.  
The Eurostat provides the total energy and CO2 tank-to-wheel quantities, the total demand for 
passenger mobility and freight transport, but does not make any energy and CO2 

differentiation between passenger of freight purpose, or by energy type. It also does not 
present any data on the well- to-tank energy consumption and CO2 emissions. 
 

 

Energy data 

The energy data provided by the Eurostat for 2007 shows the almost entirely reliance of the air 
sector on kerosene (99,7% [11]), with a small amount of gasoline (0,3% [11]). For purposes of 
this dissertation, it was not required to deeply study the air sector in all of its used energy 

types, and therefore, for purposes of discovering potential energy and CO2 impacts, it was 
assumed that the air sector relies entirely on kerosene, with the remaining gasoline energy data 

being added to the kerosene energy data. Table 13 shows the data. 
 

Table 13 – [Air] Eur ostat energ y data [11].

Gasoline 7 

Kerosene 2.230 

 

 
As a limitation of the reporting statistics methodology, the kerosene data provided by the 
Eurostat corresponds to the fuel sold at the airport and does not make any differentiation to 

where this airplane is flying to. It can fly within the national member state level (domestic 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  65 

 

flights), from one member state into another ( intra-EU flights), or from one member state to 

other continent (intercontinental flights). Therefore, it is not possible to directly use the 
kerosene data from the Eurostat, as for purposes of this dissertation, the objective was to study 

the EU situation (domestic and intra-EU level). 
CO2 data 
Regarding the CO2 emissions data, the Eurostat provides a first differentiation between 

“domestic” and “international flights”, where “international flights” includes both the “intra-
EU” and the “intercontinental” flights. Again, in order to have a total EU picture, “domestic” 

and “intra-EU” flights should be considered together.  
 
 

Passenger mobility data 
Regarding the passenger mobility data, the Eurostat provides a unique value for the entire air 

sector. According to the definition [11], this value includes both “domestic” and “intra-EU” 
flights, which is the exact situation that is required for purposes of this dissertation. This value 
can be already introduced on both energy and CO2 tables, as showed in Figure 28. 

 

 
Figure 28 – [Air] P assenger mobility i nput. 

 
 

Data overview 
Table 14 summarizes the available data on the Eurostat in function of its regional scope.

Table 14 shows that only the passenger mobility data respects the scope required for purposes 
of this dissertation, being all the other data distributed through different scopes. Therefore 
there is the need to calculate both the energy and CO2 data according to the same regional 

scope.

4.1.2. The calculation flow 
 
On this chapter the calculation of all values for the air sector will be explained step by step. 

Intermediate pictures representatives of the energy and CO2 tables will be shown in orde r to 
help the reader to follow the model?s construction.  
 

1. Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities 
 

 
Figure 29 – [Air] Fi nd the TTW total e nergy and CO2.  

 

 
On the impossibility of directly using the e nergy and CO2 data from the Eurostat, it was 

decided to contact DGENER and DGMOVE in order to have EU27 pictures for energy, CO2 
and passenger mobility data. Only DGMOVE replied to the sent questions [27], providing 
useful information on the passenger mobility split between domestic and Intra-EU flights. The 

information is shown on Table 15: 
 

Table 15 – [Air] Output fr om DGMOVE e mail exc hange. 

Eurostat Domestic Intra-EU 

572bpkm 117bpkm 455bpkm 

 

 
By having the domestic situation both on CO2 emissions (22MtCO2) and passenger mobility 

(117bpkm), it was possible to create a first picture of CO2 efficiency in terms of gCO2/pkm, 
for domestic flights. 
 

 
 

 

 
There are some studies saying that the CO2 efficiency for intra-EU flights is around 
140gCO2/pkm [28, 29], while other study by the European Commission shows a value of 

200gCO2/pkm [30]. As additional information, Lufthansa says that in 2007 their average tank-
to-wheel CO2 efficiency was 109gCO2/pkm [31]. 

 
Having this variety of data, it was decided to use t he calculated value of 190gCO2/pkm, as it 
represents the result of using the data provided by the Eurostat, having in mind that other 

studies provide different values.  This value can already be introduced on the CO2 efficiency 
table, as shown in Figure 30.

Figure 30 – [Air] TTW  CO2 per pk m input. 

 

 
Multiplying the Eurostat passenger mobility data (572bpkm), by the calculated CO2 efficiency 

factor (190gCO2/pkm), it is possible to obtain the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions for the EU27 
picture. 

 

 
 

 

 

This value can already be introduced on the Total CO2 table, as showed in Figure 31. 
 

 
Figure 31 – [Air] TTW  total CO2 input. 

 

 
Having the total quantity of the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, it is possible to calculate the 

respective total quantity of tank-to-wheel energy, through the usage of a conversion factor [12].  
 

 
 

 
 

This value can already be introduced on the Total Energy table as showed in Figure 32. 

 

 
Figure 32 – [Air] TTW  total energ y input. 

 
 

Dividing this value by the passenger mobility data, it is possible to calculate the tank-to-wheel 

energy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm.

Figure 33 – [Air] TTW  energy per pk m i nput. 

 
After the calculation of the tank-to-wheel average energy efficiency, both in terms of 

gCO2/pkm and MJ/pkm, it is now objective to calculate the same figures but in terms of 
gCO2/km and MJ/km. This calculation requires the input of data on occupancy rate as showed 
in Figure 34. 

  
2. Finding the occupancy rate 

 

 
Figure 34 – [Air] Fi nd the occupancy rate.  

 
 

The data on occupancy rate needed for purposes of this dissertation is the average number of 
passengers per airplane (passengers/airplane). In this dissertation, this value was obtained via 
the multiplication between the average seat capacity of the EU?s airplanes (seats/airplane) and 

the average load factor in percentage terms % (passengers/seats) 
 

The Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, published in 
their report from 2008 that the average seat capacity of the European airplanes on 2008 was of 
137 passengers per airplane  [32]. This figure cannot be directly compared with the publication 

from the Statistical Pocketbook of the European Commission, once it indicates only the 
number of airplanes ranging between the 51-150 and the 151-250 seats per airplane [11]. 
However and for purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to use the data from the 

Eurocontrol as it gives an exact number being unnecessary the introduction of any additional 
assumptions. 

 
Having the average seat capacity of the EU?s airplanes, it is now required to find the average 
load factor of the EU?s airplanes, in terms of percentage (%). Here, the Association of 

European Airlines (AEA) provides data on the load factor of passenger airplanes on their 
annual reports, being of 77% for the year o f 2007 [33]. As additional information, this figure 

is also referred by the European Energy Agency o n its annual “Occupancy rate of passenger 
vehicles” report [34].. 
 

Having these two values it is possible to calculate the EU?s average number of passengers per 
airplane.

The calculation of the average energy and CO2 efficiency of airplanes, in terms of MJ/km and 
gCO2/km, was obtained through the multiplication between the calculated energy and CO2 

efficiency factors, in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm, and the Occupancy rate.  
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
These two values can already be introduced on the energy and CO2 efficiency tables as 

showed in Figure 37 and Figure 38.

4. Find the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per km 

 

 
Figure 39 – [Air] W TT and W TW  energy and CO2 per km input. 

 
 

Remembering the well- to-tank ratios announced on the Methodology, for purposes of this 
dissertation and under the knowledge that this might constitute an invalid assumption, it was 
assumed that the well-to-tank kerosene ratio is the same as for gasoline. This was decided 

under the consideration that these figures do not largely influence the total transport well-to-
wheel energy and CO2 quantities, providing a reasonable value.  

 
After multiplying the calculated ratios by the calculated tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 
efficiency in terms of MJ/km and gCO2/km, it is possible to build the well-to-tank energy and 

CO2 efficiency. 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

Summing up the values of well- to-tank and tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per km, 
it is possible to build the figures for the well-to-wheel analysis on energy and CO2: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 
These values can already be introduced on both the energy and CO2 efficiency tables, as 

showed in Figure 40 and Figure 41.

Dividing the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel values per km by the occupancy rate, it is 

possible to build the figures of well- to-tank and well- to-wheel but now in terms of MJ/pkm 
and gCO2/pkm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

These values can already be introduced on both the energy and CO2 efficiency tables, as 
showed in Figure 43 and Figure 44.

6. Find the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities

After having calculated the well-to-tank, the tank-to-wheel and the well- to-wheel energy and 

CO2 efficiency factors both in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm, it can be now calculated the 
total well- to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities for the air sector. Multiplying 

the two calculated factors by the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat, final values are 
obtained. 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

These values can already be introduced on both the Total energy and CO2 tables, as showed in 
Figure 46 and Figure 47.

4.1.3. Air transport results 
 

Once the air sector was not divided in any sub- mode (everything was included in one 
category), it is not possible to provide any figure for the different air sub- modes. Figure 48 and 
Figure 49 provide the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 distribution for the air sector 

respectively. 

 
Figure 48 – [Air] W TW e nergy distri bution.  

 

The inner ring shows that according to the calculations realized on this dissertation, the air 
sector relies entirely on kerosene and is divided about 12% for the well-to-tank and the 
remaining 88% for the tank-to-wheel.

4.2. Rail transport sector 
 
For purposes of this dissertation, it the objective was to analyse and comprehend how diesel 

and electricity is currently being consumed for rail passenger mobility purposes, as well as the 
importance of each sub- mode for the total well- to-wheel energy and CO2 picture. 
 

It is not the objective of this dissertation to determine the differences on energy consumption 
due the air conditioning, lightning, services, etc, or due the technical efficiency systems 

contributions such as the energy recovery breaking system, improvements on the pantographs 
etc, but to provide information of what is actually being directly consumed by the rail sector 
from the electricity network or from the diesel tank.  

 
 

4.2.1. Overview of available and required data 
 

Table 63 of the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data (gray) for 
purposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the assumptions taken on this 
dissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat is not enough.  Similarly to the air sector, also on 

the rail sector the Eurostat does not provide any well-to-tank energy and CO2 informatio n.  
 

As an example, the Eurostat does not pro vide the energy and CO2 data for the metro segment 
but provides its passenger mobility demand. It is a different detail level from the Eurostat, 
which provides the passenger mobility and freight transport demand information by sub- mode, 

but does not make any differentiation between energy and CO2 emissions.  
The electricity and diesel information corresponds therefore for all rail sectors.  
 

 

Energy data 

Table 16 resumes the energy data provided by the Eurostat which shows that the rail sector 
relies on about 34% on diesel, with the remaining 66% on electricity.  
 

Table 16 – [Rail] Eurostat energy data [11]. 

PJ  

Diesel 132 

Electricity 254 

 
 

CO2 data 
Regarding the CO2 emissions data, the Eurostat definition explains that the associated 
electricity emissions are not included in the Eurostat rail CO2 data, being only considered the  

emissions coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (diesel and solid fuels). For the year of 
2007, the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions were about 8,2Mt [11].

Rail statistics 

Regarding the passenger mobility data, the Eurostat provides a first differentiation between the 
considered sub-modes of rail transport. It separates on metro/tram, normal- and high-speed rail, 

being a very good level of detail for purposes of this dissertation. However, it does not make 
differentiation between energy types.  
On the freight transport side the Eurostat provides an agglomerate value for all rail sector. It 

was assumed in this dissertation that this figure refers only to the normal-speed sub- mode. 
Table 17 shows the passenger mobility and freight transport data: 

 
Table 17 – [Rail] Eurostat tr ans por t statistics  [11]. 

 Passenger Freight 

Metro 86bpkm 

453btkm Railways (Normal-speed rail) 395bpkm 

High-speed 89bpkm 

 
 

Once the scope is not relevant on the rail sector (no intercontinental rail trips), it is already 
possible to introduce all three values on the rail table, on the Average rows, as showed in 
Figure 50. 

 

 
Figure 50 – [Rail] P assenger mobility input. 

 
 

4.2.2. Overview and accuracy of Ex-Tremis data 
  

As explained in the C hapter State of Art, the Ex-Tremis model provides the separation 
between the energy needed for passenger mobility and for freight transport purposes, and also 
by energy type: diesel and electricity.  

Figure 51 provides an overview of the energy data provided by the Ex-Tremis model for the 
year 2007. The “hst” means high-speed train, “loc” locomotive and “rca” railcar.  
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  77 

 

 
Figure 51 – [Rail] Ex-Tre mis 2007 details. 

 
 

The Ex-Tremis model provides energy data by purposes of passenger mobility and freight 
transport, and also individually prese nts the value for high-speed trains. For purposes of this 

dissertation, the objective was not to study the energy consumption by vehic le type 
(locomotive or railcar), but to have a conglomerated value.  
 

A first comparison with the energy data from the Eurostat was made as showed in Table 18. 
 

Table 18 – [Rail] Comparison between Eurostat and Ex-Tre mis. 

PJ Eurostat* Ex-Tremis Variation [%] 

Diesel 132 114 -14 % 

Electricity 255 173 -32 % 

Total 386 287 -25 % 

 

 
The energy data coming from the Ex-Tremis is about 25% lower than the presented by the  
Eurostat. Knowing that the Eurostat was an input data on the Ex-Tremis model, as described 

on its report [16], this difference can be considered as inconsistent and out of range. On the 
diesel side, the 14% difference could be well accepted as it does not represent such a big error, 

but in the case of electricity, a difference of 32% was considered also as out of range.  
 
Having these differences on the energy quantities, it was decided to calculate the relative 

weight (in terms of %) of each energy type on the Ex-Tremis mode. Figure 52 shows the 
relative weights of each energy type by purpose, related to the total Rail energy presented in 

the Ex-Tremis model: 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

78 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 
Figure 52 – [Rail] Rel ati ve  energy weights on Ex-Tre mis. 

 

 
The relative weights are presented on the right column and shows, for example, that the high-

speed trains represented about 0,1% of the total energy for the rail sector, or 0,2% of the total 
electricity for rail. Also, it is possible to sum all the values regarding the passenger transport  
(pass_train), and conclude that 64,1% of the energy for the rail sector goes for passenger 

mobility purposes, and the remaining for freight transport.  
 

Having this variety of information, it was decided to calculate the relative energy weight of the 
passenger mobility and freight transport by energy type, and also the role of the high-speed 
rail. 

Table 19 and Table 20 show the relative weight of interest for purposes of this dissertation: 
 

Table 19 – [Rail] Resume of rele vant energy weights.

Diesel 60,3% n.a. n.a. 

Electricity 39,7% n.a. n.a.

 % Total Rail % Total Diesel % Total Electricity 

Passenger mobility 64,1% 56,0% 69,3% 

Freight transport 35,9% 44,0% 30,7% 

 

 
These results were considered as a good contribution for purposes of this dissertation. It is 
possible to conclude, for example, that 56% of the total diesel for the rail sector is being used 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  79 

 

for passenger mobility purposes, and that 31% of the electricity for the rail sector is for freight 

transport purposes. 
Having these figures, it was decided to calculate the energy for passenger mobility and freight 

transport, through the combination between the calculated relative weights, and the Eurostat 
rail energy data. 
Table 21 and Figure 53 summarize the calculation and the obtained results:

Once it is required on this dissertation to calculate all the energy and CO2 efficiency details 
for all sub- modes of the rail sector (metro, normal- and high-speed), it was first decided to 

evaluate the potential of the Ex-Tremis to be a reliable data source.  
 

 
Accuracy of the Ex-Tremis data 
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the Ex-Tremis data, it was decided to take the only sub-

mode directly provided by the Ex-Tremis model, the high-speed train (hst). It was decided to 
calculate its tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km, and test if it is in line with 

some published values for tank-to-wheel energy consumption of high-speed trains. 
 



Model development and calibration

By applying the high-speed train relative weight (0,2%) to the total tank-to-wheel rail 

electricity (254PJ) it was possible to build a total tank-to-wheel energy picture for the high-
speed rail sub- mode. The following equation shows the calculation: 

  

 

 
This value would correspond to the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumed by the high-speed 

rail sector within the EU, in 2007. Using the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat 
(89bpkm), a first figure is obtained in terms of MJ/pkm: 

 

 
 

 

 
This figure was viewed as a relatively lower value of energy consumpt ion for the high-speed 
trains. A study published by the “Institut national de recherché sur les transports et leur 

securite” (IN RETS) [35], provides several characteristics of the main high-speed rail services 
operating within the EU.  

Table 22 summarizes the relevant characteristics collected from the INRETS, for purposes of 
this dissertation: 
 

Table 22 – [High-spee d] INRETS details for high-spee d ser vices [35].

AVE Madrid-Sevilla 57,2 313 266 85,0% 

AVERAGE 68,1 468 322 68,7% 

 

 
It is possible to conclude that the average tank-to-wheel energy consumption per km was 

about 68,1MJ/km, with an average occupancy rate of 322passengers/vehicle. 
 
Having these values, it was possible to compare the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency coming 

from the INRETS study (68,1MJ/km), with the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency calculated 
from Ex-Tremis and Eurostat (0,005MJ/pkm).  

Once the values are different (one in MJ/km and other in MJ/pkm), it was necessary to use the 
occupancy rate to convert one of them. The following equation shows the calculation of the 
tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km using the value of Ex-Tremis: 

 

 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  81 

 

The figure of 1,72MJ/km should present the same order of magnitude as the 68,1MJ/km 

coming from the IN RETS study, b ut it does not. It was not the objective of this dissertation to 
justify this difference, but it might be possible that the energy database of the Ex-Tremis is 

relatively older and did not took into account the recent expansion of the high-speed lines in 
countries such as Germany, Spain or The Netherlands, which would increase the total energy 
consumption by the high speed train segment (hst).  

 
For solving this problem, it was decided to realise the opposite exercise. Instead of starting 

with the total energy consumed by the high-speed rail, it was first assumed an average tank-to-
wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km coming from the INRETS study, and then 
calculate the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption of the high-speed rail sector.  

 
 

4.2.3. The calculation flow: high-speed rail 
 
Here, and with no additional information coming from the INRETS study, it was assumed that 

the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of 68,1MJ/km was the real consumption of the high-speed 
train, and not the energy consumed directly from the network. This doubt came up because of 

the definition of the electricity energy data provided by the Eurostat, which regards to the 
electricity delivered on the electricity network. Therefore, the energy losses at the catenaries 
should be quantified.  

For information, this consideration will not provide such important results or contributions for 
the total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 transport picture, but as a question of concept 

definition, it was decided to evaluate these energy losses.  
 
According to a report published by the “European Copper Institute”, the average percentage of 

energy losses in the catenaries wires can amount to 10% [36] of the transferred electricity 
(90% efficiency). This figure regards specifically to the Dutch railway system but, for 

purposes of this dissertation, it was assumed to be the same as the European average. 
 

 
Figure 54 – [High-spee d] High-s pee d c ate nar y e fficiency.  

 
 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

82 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

The following equation shows the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency at the 

electricity network, considering the catenary losses. 
 

 

 

 

 
This value can be already introduced on the energy efficiency table, together with the 
occupancy rate. Having these figures, it is now possible to calculate tank-to-wheel energy 

efficiency per pkm for the high-speed sector, through the division by the occupancy rate.  
 

 

 

 
 

It was obtained a value of 0,24MJ/pkm as average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of the 
high-speed rail sector. According to several studies  [30] [22] [37], this value is in the range for 

the high-speed rail sector. Table 23 presents the collection of values published in some studies 
on the same topic: 
 

Table 23 – [High-spee d] Comparison of TTW energ y efficiency.

 [30](100%, 25% Occp. Rate) [0,72 – 2,85] 

[22] 0,18 

[37] 0,25 

 

 
Besides the value from the European Commission study [30] (once regards to the German 

inter-city rail), the 0,24MJ/pkm achieved on this dissertation can be considered as consistent 
when compared to the other published values. So, it was decided to proceed with the va lue of 
0,24MJ/pkm and introduce it on the energy efficiency table. 

Figure 55 shows the introduction of the already obtained values for the high-speed rail 
segment. 

 

 
Figure 55 – [High-spee d] Initi al values  input.

Milton Grácio Catarino  83 

 

The calculation of the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption comes as a multiplication 

between the average energy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm and the passenger mobility data 
provided by the Eurostat.  

 

 
 

 

 
This means that in 2007, the high-speed rail sector operating within the EU consumed about 
21PJ of energy. Figure 56 shows the introduction.  

 

 
Figure 56 – [High-spee d] TTW total e nergy input. 

 

 
1. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel factors per km and per pkm 

 
As previously described, the well-to-tank electricity value refers to the total primary energy 
needed at the power plant to deliver the electricity on the network, ensuring the tank-to-wheel 

energy consumption by the vehicle in question (electric train or other).  
Using the values previously obtained for the T&amp;amp;D losses (92% [25]) and the EU?s electricity 

production efficiency (48% [26]), the calculation of the well- to-tank energy efficiency in 
terms of MJ/km comes as: 

 

 

 

 

 
The calculation of the well-to-wheel comes as the sum of the well- to-tank and tank-to-wheel: 

 

 
 

 

 
The final step needed to evaluate the total well-to-tank and well- to-wheel energy quantities for 

the high-speed rail sector, is the calculation of the well- to-tank and well- to-wheel energy 
efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm.

The four previously calculated values should be introduced on the energy table as showed in 
Figure 57. 

 

 
Figure 57 – [High-spee d] W TT and W TW  energy efficienc y input. 

 

 
2. Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy quantities 

 
Finally, it can be calculated the well-to-tank and well- to-wheel total energy consumption: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

And their respective introduction on the Total energy table, as showed in Figure 58. 

 

 
Figure 58 – [High-spee d] W TT and W TW  total energ y input. 

 

 
3. Finding the CO2 emissions 

 
As described before, were considered zero the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from the usage of 
electricity as energy carrier for transport. Therefore, the only CO2 emissions correspond only 

to the production at the power plant. Here, the calculation of the CO2 emissions relies on the 
multiplication between the tank-to-wheel energy consumption (MJ/km) at the power plant  

level and the CO2 factor of 115gCO2/MJ.  
 
The tank-to-wheel efficiency at the power plant takes into account the T&amp;amp;D losses (92% [25]): 

 

 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  85 

 

The 82MJ/km corresponds to the well- to-tank energy consumption of the high-speed train at 

the power plant level. By applying the 115gCO2/MJ factor, it is possible to obtain the 
associated CO2 emissions: 

 

 
 

 
 

And the associated CO2 efficiency per pkm: 
 

 

 

 

 
Table 24 shows that the value of 29gCO2/pkm for the high-speed rail is in line with the study  
[38]. Therefore, it was decided to continue with the calculated values and introduce them on 

the CO2 efficiency table.  
 

Table 24 – [High-spee d] Comparison of CO2 efficienc y.  

gCO2/pkm  

Value of this dissertation 29 (69% load factor) 

[38] 30 (70% load factor) 

 
 

Via these results, it is possible to calculate the total CO2 emissions for the high-speed rail 
through the multiplication between the gCO2/pkm factors and the  Eurostat passenger mobility 

(bpkm). The value can already be introduced on the Total CO2 table. 
 

 
 

 
 
Hence the high-speed rail sector operating in the EU in the year of 2007 emitted about 3 Mt of 

CO2 for the production of about 21PJ for final consumption, which corresponds to 47PJ of 
primary energy needs. Figure 59 shows the complete CO2 table.

4. Final high-speed results 
 

 
Figure 60 – [High-spee d] W TW e nergy distri bution.  

 
The high-speed rail sector relies entirely on electricity as energy carrier. The second ring 

shows that the well-to-tank basis represented about 31% of the total well-to-wheel energy 
consumption on the high-speed rail sector. 

 

 
Figure 61 – [High-spee d] W TW CO2 distribution.  

 
Once electricity was assumed as zero on the tank-to-wheel basis, the chart confirms the entire 
usage of electricity as energy carrier as well as the entire emissions released on the well-to-

tank basis.

4.2.4. The calculation flow: metro &amp;amp; tram 
 
Having no additional data on the Ex-Tremis model for the metro or the normal-speed tank-to-

wheel energy consumption, it was decided to realise the same procedure as for high-speed rail: 
first input a value of tank-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of MJ/km, then find the 
occupancy rate and finally calculate the total energy quantities.

MJ/vehicle.km  

[39] 11,6 

[40] 10,2 

 
 

The study [39] provides the average energy efficiency of the metro services within the scope 
of the Western European Union (WEU on the report), while the study [40] refers specifically 
to the Underground of London, in a study conducted by the Department for Transport (DfT), 

London.  
For purposes of this dissertation, it was considered as a representative the value of the Wester n 

European Union, both because of its scope and the proximity with the report of the DfT. 
 
Given the absence of additional information on the report, it was not clear whether these 

figures refer to the real consumption of the metro or to the consumption at the electricity 
network. Therefore, and similarly to the high-speed case, it was used the same mindset and 

considered the energy losses o n the catenaries, with the associated assumed efficiency of 90% 
[36]: 
 

 

 

 

 
After this consideration, the methodology to find the tank-to-wheel energy consumption is the 

same as used on the high-speed rail.

2. Finding the occupancy rate 

 
The methodology for the calculation of the occupancy rate was the same as used on the air 

sector. First it was assumed an average capacity of the European metro ways and secondly the 
average load factor. 
According to the used source, the average seat capacity of t he metro ways should be increased 

by 30%, as an additional contribution representing the standing places. Table 26 shows the 
data used for the calculation: 

 
Table 26 – [Metr o] Values on seat c apacity. 

Seats/vehicle  

Average seat capacity 260%30200200  [41] 

Typical load factor 35% [34] 

 

With the previous values, it is possible to calculate the average occupancy rate: 
 

 
 

 
 

This means that about 91 persons are travelling per metro at the EU level, in an average for the 
year of 2007, all days. It is not the objective to study peak or non-peak hours, as well as week 

or weekend days, or differences according to the city, but to have an annual average European 
value. 
 

3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm 
 

With the previous figure, it is possible to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in 
terms of MJ/pkm. 

 

 

 

 

 
Finally, Table 27 compares and resumes the collected values: 
 

Table 27 – [Metr o] Comparison of TTW energ y efficiency.

[39] 0,48MJ/pkm 

[40] 0,54MJ/pkm 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  89 

 

The value of 0,14MJ/pkm is out of order when compared to the values from the other reports. 

Given that the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km was in line with the same sources, the 
only problem resides on the occupancy rate.  

To understand the problem, it was decided to calculate which should be the average 
occupancy rate if the past values would be representative of the real situation.  
 

 

 

 
 

This value would correspond to about 10% of load factor, if the average seat capacity of metro 
lines in the EU would be as 260. Or, in the other way around, given the 35% load capacity 
provided by the European Energy Agency, this would result on an average seat capacity of 76 

seats per vehicle. 
Thus, it was necessary to decide between the 260 average seat capacity or the 35% load factor 

coming from the European Energy Agency.  Here, it was decided to keep the value of 35% for 
the load factor and adapt the occupancy rate to 26passengers/vehicle. 
 

As additional information, a study conducted by the agency PriceWaterHouseCoopers to the 
European Commission advances an average value of 20passengers/vehicle for light rails, 

which could represent the short distance rail services such as metro or tramways [42]. 
However, it is not mentioned within the report if metro is included on this category. 
 

Additionally, it might be that the 260 average seat capacity provided by the other study was an 
extreme value or a specific value of a dedicated metro brand analysed, or with a specific 

number of cars however, it is not clear on the report the adopted scope.  
 
Having decided which values are going to be used on this dissertation, they can already be 

introduced on the energy table, as showed in Figure 62. 
 

 
Figure 62 – [Metr o] Initi al values  input. 

 
 

4. Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy quantity 
 
Having achieved a consistency between sources on the values for tank-to-wheel energy 

consumption per km, per pkm and the occupancy rate, it can be now applied the passenger 
mobility data from the Eurostat (86bpkm) and obtain the total tank-to-wheel electricity 

consumption for the metro&amp;amp;tram sector. 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

90 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 
 

 
This means that all the metro and tram services operating in the European Union in 2007 
consumed about 43PJ of electric ity as final energy consumption, as showed in Figure 63. 

 

 
Figure 63 – [Metr o] TTW total e nergy input. 

 

 
5. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency factors 

 
Similarly as previously realised for the high-speed rail sector, the same methodology is 
applied to find the well-to-tank energy efficiency, both in terms of energy per km and per pkm, 

and finally the calculation of the total well-to-tank and well- to-wheel energy consumption.  
The well-to-tank energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km comes as: 

 

 

 

 
 

The well-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km comes as: 

 

 
 

 
 

The similar values but in terms of MJ/pkm:

Milton Grácio Catarino  91 

 

These values should now be introduced on the ener gy table as showed in Figure 64. 

 

 
Figure 64 – [Metr o] W TT and W TW  energy efficienc y input. 

 

 
6. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel total energy quantities 

 
Once calculated the well- to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiencies per pkm, the 
calculation of the total quantities comes as: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

And their respective introduction on the energy table as showed in Figure 65.  
 

 
Figure 65 – [Metr o] W TT and W TW  total energ y input. 

 
 

7. Finding the CO2 efficiency factors per km and per pkm 
 
Similarly to the methodology used to the high-speed rail, the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions 

were considered as zero for electricity as energy carrier. The emissions regards only to the 
respective electricity production at the power plant level. Here, the calculation should take into 

account the T&amp;amp;D losses (92% [36]): 
 

 

 

 
 

And the respective CO2 emission factor per km: 
 

 
 

 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

92 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Having this, it is possible to find the well-to-wheel CO2 efficiency factor per km. Note for the 

tank-to-wheel 0gCO2/km.  
 

 
 

 

 
 

And the respective calculation of the CO2 efficiency factors, in gCO2 per pkm.  

 

 

 

 
 

These values can already complete the CO2 efficiency table as showed in Figure 66. 
 

 
Figure 66 – [Metr o] CO2 efficienc y c omplete table.  

 

 
8. Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 quantities 

 

Using the previous calculated values, the calculation for the total well- to-tank and well-to-
wheels CO2 emissions provide the final CO2 quantities. 

 

 
 

 
Figure 67 – [Metr o] W TW e nergy distri bution.  

 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  93 

 

The inner ring shows that the metro segment relies entirely on one energy carrier: electricity. 

The well- to-wheel distribution is about 69% for the well- to-tank and the remaining 31% for 
the tank-to-wheel. 

 
Figure 68 – [Metr o] W TW CO2 distributi on. 

 
The inner ring shows that the metro CO2 emissions come only from the usage of electricity as 

energy carrier. O nce it was considered the tank-to-wheel emission as zero, the chart confirms  
the 100% CO2 emissions coming only from the well- to-tank basis. 
 

 

4.2.5. The calculation flow: normal-speed rail 
 
As explained before, it was assumed on this dissertation that the normal-speed rail only 
consumes energy in forms of diesel and electricity, and is both used for passenger mobility 

and freight transport purposes.  
As calculated before, Table 28 shows the obtained results for total diesel and electricity 

consumed for passenger mobility and freight transport purposes.

1. Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities 

 

 
Figure 69 – [Nor mal-s pee d] Find the TTW  total energy and CO2.  

 
It was assumed on this dissertation that the electricity for passenger mobility was consumed by 
the rail sub- modes of metro&amp;amp;tram, normal-speed and high-speed, while in the case of diesel 

for passenger mobility, it was considered to be consumed only by the normal-speed rail 
segment. 

 
Having these values, it was not necessary to first find the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in 
terms of energy per km or per pkm, since the total tank-to-wheel energy quantities have been 

previously calculated.  
It was directly possible to introduce the value of diesel for passenger mobility (74PJ) and the 

respective CO2 emissions (5MtCO2) both on the energy and CO2 tables. Figure 70 and Figure 
71 show the introduction.  
 

 

 
Figure 70 – [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total diesel energy input. 

 

 

 
Figure 71 – [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total diesel CO2 input. 

 
 

In the case of electricity for the normal-speed rail segment, it was not needed to introduce any 
additional external data source. Since the values for total tank-to-wheel electricity for metro 
and high-speed rail was calculated before, the calculation of the normal-speed is the remaining 

value. 
 

In this case, the calculation relies only on the subtraction to the total rail electricity for 
passenger mobility (176PJ), the metro&amp;amp;tram (43PJ) and the high-speed (21PJ). The following 
equation shows the calculation: 

 
  



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  95 

 

This value would correspond to the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumption by the normal-

speed segment in 2007, and can already be introduced on the energy table as showed in Figure 
72. 

 

 
Figure 72 – [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total energy input. 

 

 
2. Finding the passenger mobility by energy type 

 
Differently from the previous rail sub- modes of metro and high-speed rail, the normal-speed 
sector relies on two energy carriers: diesel and electricity. Hence, t he Eurostat data indicates 

that the total passenger mobility travelling by normal-speed rail is 395bpkm, but does not 
make any differentiation between the passenger-km travelling on diesel from those travelling 

on electric trains. 
 
The Ex-Tremis data was useful in the sense that it provides detailed differentiation by energy 

type consumed for passenger mobility purposes, but does not make differentiation on the 
amount of passengers-km travelling on diesel or on electricity. Here, the relation cannot be 

considered as directly proportional due the different energy efficiencies associated to the 
engines of each train: diesel trains are moved with an internal combustion engine, while 
electric drive trains with an on-board electricity transformer.  

This concept definition of the different engine drive efficiencies, anticipates the conclusion 
that diesel trains are expected to be more energy intensive per passenger-km when compared 
to the electric trains.  

 
As previously described on the Chapter State of Art, the Tremove model regards specifically 

to the road fleet composition but also provides interesting details for the rail sector. In the rail 
sector, it shows the amount of passengers-km travelling on diesel and electric trains.  
For purposes of this dissertation, 2007 data is required. Although it will not bring such a big 

impact on the total picture, it was realised an interpolation between the years of 2005 and 2010 
to find the 2007 data. Figure 73 shows the data provided by the Tremove for the rail sector: 

 

 
Figure 73 – [Nor mal-s pee d] Tre move r ail passenger mobility data . 

 
 
As a brief note, the interpolation can be considered as a reliable methodology to find the 2007  

data once the Tremove does not model any extreme scenario, like a very high value happening 



Model development and calibration  

 

96 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

on 2007. Tremove?s predictions assume a linearity increase throughout the years and so 

applying an interpolation provides a value in line with that increase. 
A first comparison with the Eurostat data was realised on Table 29. 

 
Table 29 – [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison between Eur ostat and Tre move.  

bpkm Eurostat Tremove Variation % 

Diesel Non available 54 n.a. 

Electricity Non available 336 n.a. 

Rail (normal and high-speed) 484 390 -19% 

Metro 86 55 -37% 

 

 
The Tremove model does not make any differentiation between normal- and high-speed rail 

but provides a differentiation on metro. It is not the objective of this dissertation to explain the 
differences between these two values, but it might be that as the Tremove was developed in 
the past years (about 1995), and did not include  some metro and high-speed lines that recently 

appeared. Therefore it appears a 37% differences in the amount of passengers-km on metro, 
and about 20% of the normal- and high-speed rail together.  

In this case it was decided to not use directly the data from the Tremove, but to use the relative 
weights (%) and apply them to the Eurostat data.  
From the interpolated 2007 data, it was possible to calculate the ratio between the passengers-

km travelling on electricity on the total passengers-km on all passengers by train.  
 

 
 

 
 
Here, and to respect coherence on the methodology, it should be clarified that this ratio cannot 

be directly applied to the value of the Eurostat (395bpkm), as the methodology behind in the 
Tremove includes the high-speed lines at that time.  

 
For contouring this problem, an equation system was realised. It was considered that the 86% 
ratio of electricity-pkm includes both the normal-speed and the high-speed Eurostat values 

(395 and 89bpkm). Again, this calculation will not bring additional or important variations on 
the total values of passengers-km, but to respect concept definition, it was decided to account 

for this difference.  
 

 
 

 
 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  97 

 

With this equation it was found that about 328bpkm are currently travelling on normal-speed 

running on electricity. In what regards to the diesel passengers-km: 
 

  

 

 
These values should now be introduced on both the energy and CO2 tables, as showed in 

Figure 74. 
 

 
Figure 74 – [Nor mal-s pee d] P assenger mobility by energy type input. 

 
 

3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm 

 
Having the passengers-km and the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 values, the respective 

tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm can be now calculated. 
The following equations show the calculation: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
And the average normal-speed rail tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm, including both 

diesel and electricity: 
 

 
 

 
 

Regarding the sources, within the literature it was not found values specifically for diesel 
trains in terms of MJ per pkm but only for electric trains, or also as average (diesel and 
electricity combined). Table 30 shows a comparison of the found values:

[37] (new electric train) 0,31 

[37] (old electric train) 0,43 

[39] (average) 0,96 

 
 
In terms of energy per passenger-km, the energy efficiency calculated on this dissertation for 

electric trains is in line with the published sources, being an intermediate value between new 
and old electric trains. A special remark to the higher value coming from the last study, 

showing an Western European Union value of 0,96MJ/pkm, double of the one calculated on  
this dissertation. 
It can be judged the importance that the occupancy rate might have on these results. In one 

hand, if the data is compared with same load factor, in terms of %, does not have sense. The 
data should be compared on the same basis as the number of passengers per vehicle  

(passengers/vehicle) and not on the load factor in percentage terms. For example, there is a 
different seat capacity between Nordic and Southern trains which influences the load factor in 
percentage terms.  

 

 
Figure 75 – [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  energy per pk m input. 

 

 
4. Finding the occupancy rate 

 
Similarly as before, finding representative data on the European average number of passengers 
per vehicle on normal-speed rail was not an easy task to perform. Sea rching within the 

representative European or International rail associations such as the UNIFE or the UIC, it 
was not possible to find such data on their annual free reports. 

  
Once more, the methodology was to find a load factor in terms of %, multiplying it by the 
typical maximum seat capacity of a normal-speed rail, and calculating the average number of 

passengers per vehicle.  
Hence, the European Energy Agency advances a value of 36,6% [34] as an average load factor 

of the European Union for the rail sector, being not clear whether this data includes the higher 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  99 

 

load factors coming from the high-speed rail sector or not. Also, this value might be the 

average including both electric and diesel trains.  
Having these limitations in mind, it was assumed the same load factor value for normal-speed 

diesel and electric trains.  
Table 31 summarizes the maximum seat capacity from the literature: 
 

Table 31 – [Nor mal-s pee d] External data on maxi mum seat capacity.

 237 
 168 

 227 
  

[42] 356 
 400 
 180 

Average 263 

 

 
According to the operational region or country, the number of wagons, rail operator and also 
day time, the average maximum seat capacity varies from a wide range of number of seats, 

non-counting the standing places on the regional or inter-regional services. For example, it is 
highly likely to happen that a French or a German train show a much higher seat capacity 
compared to an Austrian or a Belgium train, as there are differences on the number of 

population. 
 

An average number of 263seats/vehicle was assumed to be the European average maximal 
seat capacity. At this stage of the dissertation, this figure will determine the tank-to-wheel 
energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km and gCO2/km.  

 
According to the data sources, the calculated average seat capacity applies only to electric 

trains. Here, and similarly to the previously explained load factor (%), it should be informed 
that no work was done to find the average maximum seat capacity specifically for diesel trains, 
being assumed to be the same value. The final value of passengers/vehicle comes as: 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Figure 76 – [Nor mal-s pee d] Occ upanc y r ate i nput.

5. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km 

 
Next step is the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiencies in terms of MJ/km, for 

diesel, electric and average normal-speed segment. 
The following equations show the diesel, electric and average energy/km factors:  

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
One of the main concerns that might rise up from comparing these values is that the average 
consumption for normal-speed trains is lower than for high-speed trains. It can be directly 

judged as positive and correct due the higher speeds achieved on the high-speed rail, forced to 
overtake the wind drag. Remembering the kinetic energy equation, the energy increases with 

the square of the speed.  
 
It should to be clear that these values were obtained under many assumptions, one of them 

having a large high impact: the occupancy rate. A simple calculation can indicate whether the 
order of magnitude for these tank-to-wheel energy efficiencies is correct or not.  

 
By multiplying the diesel tank-to-wheel energy efficiency by a factor of 25%, representative 
of the overall combustion efficiency, and the electric tank-to-wheel energy efficiency by 85%, 

representative of the overall efficiency of electric trains, it is possible to see that the two 
necessary energy consumptions are in line with each other: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
This calculation, whether the assumptions of 25% and 85% are representative of the average 
European Union or not, indicates that these two values can be judged as reliable on the 

necessary energy needed to move the train.  
 

Table 32 provides a comparison between other studies on the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency 
for normal-speed trains, in terms of MJ/vehicle.km.

well accepted, once it is in the range with the published studies.

6. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency factors per km 

 
For the calculatio n of the well-to-tank energy per km needed to provide the tank-to-wheel 
energy to move the diesel train, the 106MJ/km as calculated before, it was used the same 

methodology as for the airplane. Once diesel is a fossil liquid fuel, the “JEC Well-to-Wheels” 
study provides the relative weight of diesel well-to-tank on diesel tank-to-wheel: the 15,8% as 

previously shown on the Methodology. Therefore, it comes for the calculation of the well-to-
tank: 

 

 
 

 

 
The methodology for the electric trains well-to-tank was the same as for the other electric rail 
sub- modes. It was considered both the T&amp;amp;D losses (92% [25]) and the EU?s power plants 

efficiency (48% [26]): 
 

 

 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

102 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

The calculation of the average normal-speed well- to-tank includes both diesel and electric 

trains, and could be done in many different ways.  
For purposes of this dissertation, once the occupancy rate was the parameter making the  

transition between the energy per pkm and per km, it was decided to calculate the average 
well-to-tank energy per km, in function of the relative weight of the passengers-km for both 
diesel and electric passengers-km. 

The following equation shows the calculation used:  
 

 
 

 
 

It was decided to calculate like this in the basis that if more people will travel on diesel or 
electric trains, the average well-to-tank will be as much closer to the diesel or electric well-to-

tank values, following the respective percentage increase of diesel/ or electric passengers-km 
in the total normal-speed passengers-km. 
 

The calculation of the well-to-wheel is the sum of the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel, for all 
cases: 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
These values can already complete the energy efficiency table as showed in Figure 78.

7. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm 

 
The calculation of the well- to-tank and well-to-wheel in terms of energy per pkm, is the same 

as previously done. Here are presented the equations for diesel normal-speed, being the same 
as for electricity and average.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
Figure 79 – [Nor mal-s pee d] W TT and W TW e nergy per  pk m input. 

 
 

8. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel total energy quantities 
 

Finally, and similarly to the other sub-modes, here is the respective calculation of the total 

well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy consumption. Again, is only presented the one of diesel 
as energy carrier being the same methodology for the electricity.  

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

These values can already complete the energy table for the normal-speed rail, as shown in 
Figure 80.

9. Finding the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm 

 
Taking the total CO2 quantities calculated in the beginning of the Rail (5MtCO2), the first 

step is the calculation of the CO2 efficiency factors in terms o f gCO2/pkm. The following 
equations show the calculation for each tra in and the average normal-speed: 
Diesel trains: 

 

 
 

 
Electric trains: 

 

 
 

 

Average normal-speed: 
 

 
 

 

 
Regarding the average CO2 factor of 14gCO2/pkm, it is possible to compare it with other 
published studies as showed in Table 33. 

 
Table 33 – [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison of TTW  CO2 efficienc y. 

 

 
From the table, there are significant differences between the calculated average tank-to-wheel 

CO2 efficiency per pkm with the other published studies on the topic.  
As a reminder, the calculated value of 14gCO2/pkm is the result of considering about 60% of 
the total tank-to-wheel rail CO2 being emitted for passenger mobility purposes, a  figure that 

comes from the Ex- Tremis model, through the division between the Eurostat railways 
passenger mobility (395bpkm).  

 
The introduction of the Ex-Tremis model to the separation of the CO2 from passenger 
mobility and freight transport is not viewed as a potential source of errors to calculate a figure 

of 14gCO2/pkm.  

gCO2/pkm

Milton Grácio Catarino  105 

 

For example, and in order to evaluate the sensibility of this 14gCO2/pkm value, if considering 

an extreme case where all rail CO2 is emitted for passenger mobility purposes, a figure of 
about 20gCO2/pkm would result from calculation: 

 

 
 

 
 

This value means that if using the Eurostat normal-speed rail value of passengers-km and the 

published tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, it would be impossible to obtain similar values with 
the ones published by the other studies, such as 25 or 66gCO2/pkm.  

The value obtained on this dissertation seems to be lower when compared to the other studies. 
In one hand, it is not clear within the other studies if those values include also the production 
of the electricity (which would increase the CO2/pkm factor), or if they only consider the 

tank-to-wheel contribution from the diesel trains. In other hand, it is also not clear whether the  
other studies include the contribution from the high-speed rail sector (which would reduce the 

CO2 factor). 
 
Despite the differences, and since the energy values presented before were in line with other 

published sources [30] [37] [39], it was decided to continue with the value of 14gCO2/km.  
 

 
10. Finding the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km 

 

The calculation of the CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency in terms o f gCO2/km is the same as for 
the other calculations. It is used the previously calculated values per pkm and multiply them 
by the occupancy rate.  

Here is the diesel case: 
 

 
 

 
The electricity case: 

 

 
 

 

And the average case:

11. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km 

 
The calculation of the diesel well-to-tank gCO2/km relies on the methodology used before of 

applying the JEC  Well-to-Wheel ratios. Here is the diesel case using the 18,8% well-to-tank 
ratio: 

 

 
 

 

 
In the case of electricity, the CO2 well-to-tank is calculated in the same way as for metro and 

high-speed rail. First calculate the well- to-tank energy consumption at the output of the power 
plant (taking the T&amp;amp;D 92% losses [25]) and then multiply it by the CO2 electricity production 
factor (115gCO2/MJ): 

 

 

 

 
 

For the calculation of the normal-speed average well- to-tank CO2 efficiency, it is applied the 
same methodology as it was for the energy case. It is again considered the relative weight of 

the passengers-km data travelling both on diesel and electric trains. 
 

  

 
 

For the calculation of the well- to-wheel efficiency in terms of gCO2/km, it is summed the 
calculated tank-to-wheel value on the previous point (1.323gCO2/km), with the well-to-tank 
value calculated right before : 

 

 
 

 
 

12. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km 
 
Having calculated the CO2 efficiency factors per km, it remains only the correspondent values 

but in units of gCO2/pkm. 
 

 

 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  107 

 

In this case, the well- to-wheel 52gCO2/pkm factor is closer as to the 65gCO2 provided by the 

European Commission communication [30], but still the same doubt remains on the scope of 
their methodology. Despite the verified differences on the CO2 values when compared to 

other studies, given the achieved consistency on the energy efficiency table, it was decided to 
continue with the calculated CO2 values.  
 

 
13. Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 quantities 

 
The calculation of the total CO2 quantities used the same methodology as before. It multiplies 
the gCO2/pkm factors with the Eurostat passenger mobility data for the normal-speed rail 

segment (395bpkm).  
Here is the example of the well-to-tank total CO2 calculation in case of diesel trains, being the 

same for electric trains.  
 

 
 

 
All calculated values can already complete the Total CO2 table as showed in Figure 81.

The inner ring shows that the normal-speed segment relies on two energy carriers, diesel and 

electricity, in a well-to-wheel distribution o f 20% and 80% respectively. The well-to-tank 
diesel energy consumption represents about 3% of the total we ll-to-wheel energy for rail, 

compared to the electricity well-to-tank which represents about 55%.  
 

 
Figure 83 – [Nor mal-s pee d] W TW CO2 distri bution. 

 

The chart shows that the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions on the normal-speed segment follow a 
distribution of about 32% for diesel and 68% for electricity. The tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions 
resulting from the usage of diesel trains represents about 27% of the total normal-speed well-

to-wheel CO2 emissions, while the CO2 emissions on the electricity as energy carrier, 
represents about 68% and come only from the well-to-tank basis.

4.3. Road transport sector 
 
The road sector was considered on this dissertation as the most important transport mode. 

Within its sub- modes, the bus and the car segments were of special interest on this dissertation, 
given its high importance on the passenger mobility scene.  
On this dissertation, two different energy approaches will be realized: on one side, it will be 

assessed the situation where only fossil fuels are consumed, and on the other side the real 
situation where biofuels were blended. 

 
 

4.3.1. Overview of available and required data 
 
Similarly to what happened to the Rail sector, the Eurostat does not provide all the required 

details on energy consumption and passenger mobility data for purposes of this dissertation. 
As an example, it provides the gasoline consumption on the Road sector, but do not make 

differentiation between the gasoline consumed by cars, by motos or by vans. Also, it provides 
passenger mobility information on bus, but does not provide passenger mobility information 
on bus running on diesel or in natural gas.  

Table 64 of the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data (gray) for 
purposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the information required on this 

dissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat is not enough.  
 
The Eurostat provides the energy details of each energy carrier used in road transport, but does 

not provide the energy consumed by each sub- mode, as well as its CO2 emissions. O n the 
transport mobility data, the Eurostat provides interesting details for the passenger car, bus and 
motorcycle segments. 

 
To fill up the model on both the energy and CO2 tables, it was used the same methodology 

type as for the previous transport modes. O n one hand, it could be first introduced the total 
tank-to-wheel energy consumption and calculate the energy efficiency, or in other side, first 
introduce the energy efficiency and afterwards calculate the total tank-to-wheel energy 

consumption. 
 

 

4.3.2. Overview and accuracy of the Tremove data 
 
As previously described on the State of Art, the Tremove model provides one of the most 
representative European databases on road fleet composition. Within its website, it is possible 

to download the data respective to the EU15 and the EU12+2(CH+NO). On this dissertation, 
the required scope was the EU27 being necessary the re-arrangement of the Tremove?s data.

Tremove energy data 

The Tremove provides two separate spreadsheets for the EU15 and EU12+NO+CH individual 
Member States case. Therefore, it was necessary to re-arrange both tables in order to build the 

EU27 picture: add the EU15 and EU12 and subtract the NO and C H as countries.  
After re-arranging the Tremove?s data sheets, it was possible to build an EU27 picture for the 
road sector. Figure 84 provides the information on which energy data can be obtained via the 

consultancy of the Tremove model: 
 

 
Figure 84 – [Road] Tre move road energy data [15]. 

 
 

The Tremove provides detailed energy data for each sub- mode of transport, by energy type 
and up to the year o f 2030. It is possible to see, as an example, that in 2010 the car sector is 
expected to consume about 188.988ktoe of energy, which about 108.069ktoe regards to energy 

needed to power gasoline engines.  
 

The year of 2007, the reference case on this dissertation, was calculated using an interpolation 
between the years of 2000 and 2010.  
Similarly as realized in the previous chapter, the appliance of an interpolation can be judged as 

an imprecise exercise, and in fact it has the potential to be an imprecise exercise, given the 
energy context of the year of 2007. According to the published data on Eurostat, the year of 

2007 presented one of the highest energy consumption years on the road transport sector. An 
interpolation between the year of 2000 and 2010 might imply a potential risk of ignoring an 
eventual atypical year.  

 
 

 
 
 

 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  111 

 

In order to analyse the Tremove?s data accuracy, a first comparison with the 2007 interpolated 

data with the Eurostat road energy is presented on Table 34. 
 

Table 34 – [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and Tre move e nergy, 2007. 

ktoe Eurostat [11] Tremove [15] Variation (%) 

Gasoline 105.907 - n.a. 

Diesel 188.501 - n.a. 

LPG 4.804 4.217 -12% 

Natural Gas 732 268 -63% 

Bioethanol 1.183 - n.a. 

Biodiesel 6.587 - n.a. 

Gasoline+Bioethanol 107.090 127.147 +19% 

Diesel+Biodiesel 195.088 159.788 -18% 

Road 307.714 291.419 -5% 

 
 

The Tremove presents an overall road energy difference of about 5%, which was not viewed 
as such a big error for purposes of this dissertation. Large and important errors were verified 

on the discrepancies between the gasoline and diesel values.  
As explained before, the Tremove is an old model and did not predicted at that time the recent 
migration from gasoline into diesel on the private car segment and also the recent expansion of 

the diesel truck segment for freight transport. Might be that those factors explain the 
differences on gasoline and diesel from the Tremove.  

 
Analysing in particular the car sector, the gasoline consumption presented by Tremove is 
higher when compared to the total gasoline consumed by the road sector in EU: 

 
  

 
 

This situation is impossible. It is impossible that the passenger car sector consumed more 
gasoline than the entire road sector. This can be considered as one example of how out of date 
can be the Tremove?s data when compared to the real situation.  

 
 

Tremove passenger mobility data 
The Tremove also provides information on the details of passenger mobility data between road 
sub- modes, by energy type. This was a very good and useful level of information for purposes 

of this dissertation. Figure 85 provides the information that is possible to download and re-
arrange from the Tremove?s website: 

 



Model development and calibration

Figure 85 – [Road] Tre move road passenger mobility data [15]. 

 
 

The passenger mobility data provided by the Tremove model was extremely interesting for 
purposes of this dissertation. It was possible to visualize and analyze the passenger mobility 
demand for each sub-mode of road transport (similarly to the Eurostat) but by energy type 

(new information). 
A first comparison with the Eurostat passenger mobility data is shown on Table 35: 

 
Table 35 – [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and Tre move passenger mobility , 2007. 

bpkm Eurostat [11] Tremove [15] Variation (%) 

Bus 542 514 -5% 

Car 4.760 4.880 +3% 

Moto* 152 201 +32% 

Van - 303 n.a. 

Road 5.454 5.900 +8% 

* Moto includes both motorcycle and mopeds. 

 
 

Generally speaking, the Tremove provides a very good accuracy level when compared to the 
data coming from the Eurostat. Desp ite the moto sub- mode, all the other sub- modes seemed to 
be well modelled by the Tremove, having a global error of about 8%. A note for the passenger 

vans segment, as the Eurostat does not provide any statistics, but it seems to be significant 
when looking to the data provided by the Tremove.

Preliminary conclusions 

Despite the achieved consistency on the passenger mobility data, the Tremove presents a 
considerable error regarding the energy consumption data. Having the mindset used on this 

dissertation, this might have implications in one hand on the energy efficiency implicit on the 
Tremove model or, in other hand, significant variations on the occupancy rate.  
Considering that the occupancy rate does not justify such an important energy differences, the 

potential source of error might reside on the assumed energy efficiency by the Tremove model.  
It is not the objective of this dissertation to deeply study the assumptions behind the Tremove 

model, but it should be in mind that might exist a potential source of errors when interacting 
Tremove and Eurostat data. 
 

 
Evaluate the Tremove’s accuracy 

To evaluate the accuracy of the Tremove model on the energy efficiency of road transport, 
first values were built using the information provided by the Tremove, applied to the Eurostat 
information.  

Figure 86 shows the relative weights (%) of energy and passenger mobility by the Tremove 
model: 

 

 
Figure 86 – [Road] Energy and passenger mobility relati ve  weights on Tre move. 

 
 

This table shows, for example, that 36% of the consumed energy by the car sector is in forms 
of blended diesel or for example that 97% of the passenger mobility by bus is running on 

diesel.  
Given the data type provided by the Eurostat, Figure 87 shows a re-arrangement of the 
Tremove data to easier apply the relative weights to the Eurostat data. It provides the details of 

each energy type and how they are consumed by each sub-mode of road transport: 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

114 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 
Figure 87 – [Road] Relati ve weights be tween eac h energ y carrier.  

 
 
This figure shows, for example, that 45% of the diesel consumed on the road transport (incl. 

biodiesel) is currently being consumed by heavy duty trucks for freight transport; or for 
example that 92% of the road gasoline is consumed by the car sector.  

Having these relative weights, it was decided to apply them to the Eurostat road energy data. 
Figure 88 shows the result: 
 

 
Figure 88 – [Road] Result of inter acting Tre move  with Eur ostat energ y data.  

 
 

This means that the car segment could potentially have consumed about 98.878ktoe of 
gasoline (incl. Bioethanol) and also that the moto segment consumed about 4.014ktoe of 
gasoline (incl. Bioethanol). 

Performing the same exercise for the case of passenger mobility, it was possible to calculate 
the passenger mobility data for each sub- mode of road transport, by energy type, as showed in 

Figure 89. 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  115 

 

 
Figure 89 – [Road] Result of inter acting Tre move  with Eur ostat passenger mobility data.  

 
 

The table shows, for example, that the bus segment transported about 19billion passengers-km 
on natural gas, or that the car segment transported about 2.844bpkm on gasoline. This is a very 

good level of detail for purposes of this dissertation. 
 
 

Preliminary calculation of tank-to-wheel energy efficiency values 

Having data both on the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption and on passenger mobility 

for each sub-mode of transport, it was decided to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency 
values in terms of energy/pkm that would result from interacting the previous information.  
 

For each previous value of each sub-mode of transport, it was divided the e nergy consumption 
by the passenger mobility demand. Figure 90 shows the results: 

 

 
Figure 90 – [Road] Preliminary results on e nergy efficiency per pk m. 

 

 
After converting the energy values from ktoe into PJ, it was possible to calculate first MJ/pkm 
values. From this table, it is possible to visualize large differences on the energy efficiency by 

energy type within the same sub- mode. For example, it is possible to see that bus running on 
natural gas shows the double of the energy consumption when compared to the diesel ones; or 
in other hand that the natural gas cars shows the triple of the consumption when compared to 

gasoline. 



Model development and calibration

According to the mindset on this dissertation, the only factor that might be influencing these 

results is the occupancy rate. However, it is highly impossible that the occupancy rate varies in 
such a proportion allowing these differences.  

For purposes of this dissertation, the occupancy rate was viewed as a parameter that does not 
largely varies by energy type, and cannot influence the results in such errors by sub- mode and 
by energy type.  

 
From this exercise, it was concluded that the direct application of the relative weights from 

Tremove to the totals of the Eurostat energy and passenger mobility data, did not provide 
calibrated results. In that case, this methodology was discarded urging the need to use external 
sources. 

 
 

4.3.3. External sources 
 
Once the car sector was of especially interest on this dissertation, newer sources of 

information were tried to obtain in order to better characterize its 2007 situation. At that time, 
the recently published “JEC Biofuels Programme” was viewed as a reliable source of 

information due its research on road fleet composition and energy consumption. It is a 
research study conducted by the JEC consortium which analysed the details of all road fleet 
composition, its energy consumption and performance.  

 
Through the attendance of several internal meetings at Toyota Motor Europe [43], it was 

possible to have energy data for the year of 2007, specifically for the car sector. The level of 
detail is similar to the Tremove, but more representative of the actual situation. It is not 
possible to provide the detailed energy data from the “JEC Biofuels Programme”, being only 

possible to provide the approximate values.  
Table 36 shows the results of the energy data: 

 
Table 36 – [Road] “J EC Bi ofuels Programme” energy de tails  [12]. 

Mtoe Car Road Rest (Road-Car) 

Gasoline ~100 ~110 ~10 

Diesel ~60 ~190 ~130 

LPG ~4 ~4 ~0 

Natural Gas (CNG) ~0 ~0 ~0 

Bioethanol ~1 ~1 ~0 

Biodiesel ~2 ~6 ~4 

 
 

The table shows the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption by the car segment, in 2007, as 
well as the total Road tank-to-wheel energy consumption. Having these two values, it is 
possible to subtract the car energy data to the road energy data and build a „rest? tank-to-wheel 

energy data. 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  117 

 

Figure 91 attempts to show how the data coming from the “JEC Biofuels Programme” is 

similar to the one published by the Eurostat. It was so viewed as a reliable source of 
information for purposes of this dissertation. 

 

 
Figure 91 – [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and “J EC Biofuel Pr ogramme” [11, 12]. 

 

 
On the most representative energy carriers at the road transport level, gasoline and diesel, the 

JEC value is about 2% higher for gasoline and 1% lower for diesel. It was so viewed as a very 
accurate data for purposes of this dissertation. 
 

 
The passenger car sub-mode 

The “JEC Biofuels Programme ” provides also one important parameter of the passenger car 
sector performance: the annua l running volume in kilometres, about ~3.333x10

9
km [12]. 

Having this value and having the total energy consumption for the car sector, it was possible 

to build an important parameter for purposes of this dissertation: the average tank-to-wheel 
energy consumption for the car sector in terms of energy/km.  

 

 
 

 
 

The other sub-modes 

In the absence of details for the other road transport sub- modes (bus, moto, passenger van and 

freight), it was decided to use the rest of the road information and apply the respective relative 
weights from the Tremove model. Note that LPG it is only being consumed by the car sector 
and regarding CNG is both consumed by the passenger car and bus.

Figure 92 shows the rest-road relative weights coming from the Tremove model for the modes 

of bus, moto, passenger van and freight (heavy duty and light duty trucks), on gasoline (incl. 
bioethanol) and diesel (incl. biodiesel): 

 

 
Figure 92 – [Road] Result of Tre move’s relati ve weights to J EC details. 

 
 

This table means that the remaining diesel is being 78% consumed by the freight transport, 
and for example 45% of the remaining gasoline is being consumed by the passenger vans  

segment. Applying these relative weights, it was possible to build energy figures for the sub-
modes of bus, moto, van and freight. Table 37 shows those calculated figures.  
 

Table 37 – [Road] Input values on the energy table.

Gasoline - 3,0 2,4 - 

Diesel 9,8 - 17,8 95,7 

Natural gas 0,4 - - - 

Bioethanol - 0,0 0,0 - 

Biodiesel 0,3 -- 0,6 3,3 

 
 

4.3.4. The calculation flow: bus 
 

As previously explained, the road calculations will be realised on two approaches: first 
considering only fossil energy, where the biodiesel energy quantity is added on diesel; and the 

other considered the real situation, making the difference when biodiesel is blended on diesel.  
 
 

Energy and CO2 data 
Table 38 summarizes the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions that 
were used on this dissertation.

The calculation of the CO2 emissions came from the application of the conversion factor. 
These values can already be introduced on both the energy and CO2 tables, as show n in Figure 
139 and Figure 140 of Annexes. It is also possible to see the introduction of the Eurostat 

passenger mobility value.  
 

 
Passenger mobility data 
According to the Eurostat, the bus sector presented a total amount of 542bpkm [11]. This 

value includes both urban buses, rural and long-distance coach services, and both diesel and 
natural gas. Here, it was required to make the separation between diesel and natural gas on the  

bus passenger mobility scene.  
For purposes of this dissertation, the differences on the combustion efficiency between diesel 
and natural gas engine types were not taken into account, as they would not bring such 

important potential differences for the final objective of the dissertation. Therefore, it was 
assumed the same efficiency per pkm for both energy types.  

 
Therefore, under this assumption, the calculation of the diesel passenger mobility data will 
rely directly on the proportion of the diesel energy to the total bus energy: 

 

 
 

 

And the respective natural gas passenger mob ility data: 
 

  

 

These values can already be introduced on the energy and CO2 tables, for both energy type, as 
showed in Figure 93.

Figure 93 – [B us ] First values  input. 

 
 

1. Finding tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm 
 

Now it is possible to fill up the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm column, since the 
values for the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities, as well as the passenger mobility 
data by energy type is known.  

The following equation calculates the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm for the 
diesel case: 

 

 
 

 
 

The associated CO2 efficiency factor in case of only fossil diesel considered:  

 

 
 

 
 

And the CO2 efficiency factor in case of blended diese l considered: 
 

 
 

 
 

The same procedure was applied to the natural gas case. The final results for the tank-to-wheel 
energy and CO2 efficiency per pkm are as shown in Table 39. 
 

Table 39 – [Bus] Energy and CO2 efficiency per pk m.

Milton Grácio Catarino  121 

 

The same value of energy efficiency per pkm (0,81MJ/pkm) is the result from the assumption 

previously explained of non-considering the combustion efficiency differences between diesel 
and natural gas engines. The only differences resides on the CO2 efficiency factors which are  

both influenced by the presence of biodiesel in the diesel bus, and the used conversion factors 
for natural gas and diesel.  
The average value of bus is highly influenced by the large utilization of diesel bus within the 

EU level.

Table 40 shows a variety of energy and CO2 efficiency factors for bus. It might be that the 
assumed occupancy rate behind each calculation is potentially influencing the results on both 

studies. Having this variety of data, the next step should be the calculation of the occ upancy 
rate and then the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of energy/km, 
with the objective of validating the values until now. 

 

 
Figure 94 – [B us] TTW energ y per pk m input. 

 

 
2. Finding the occupancy rate 

 
Similarly to the exercise realized on the previous modes, here the required number should 
represent the European average number of passengers per bus.  

For the average maximum seat capacity of the most used bus at European level, it was 
assumed a value of 50seats/bus with the respective increase of 20% [41] due the standing 

capacity. For the European average load factor, it was used the value advanced by the  
European Energy Agency of 33,5% [34]. 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

122 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Both values combined result in an European average of 20passengers/bus, representing the 

annual average on all hours of the day. It is not the objective of this dissertation to study peak 
or non-peak hours, week or weekend days, but to have an European average representative of 

the annual situation. 
As additional information, a study conducted by “Volvo Buses Environment” also advances 
the same value of 20passengers/bus [46]. 

 
Another situation, not so important and similarly to the previously done to the normal-speed 

rail, is related with the assumption of the same number of passengers per bus both for the 
diesel and CNG (the same occupancy rate for both energy types).  
 

 
Figure 95 – [B us] Occupancy rate input. 

 

 
3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per km 

 

Similarly as previously realized, it was decided to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 
efficiencies in terms of energy and CO2 per km. Here is the case of diesel bus, being the same 

methodology for the natural gas case : 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
Table 41 summarizes the achieved values for the other energy carriers:

Using several conversion factors, for example, it results that the average energy efficiency of 

the buses at European level is about 50liters per 100km. Within the literature it was possible to 
find several values for comparison as showed in Table 42.

As previously showed in Table 40, the energy efficiency in terms of energy/pkm is in line with 
the used data sources while the energy efficiency in terms of energy/km seems to present some 
variations. The problem might be on the occupancy rate assumptions that were taken behind 

the calculation on each study. 
Despite the verified differences such as the 28l/100km co mpared to the calculated 50l/100km, 

it was decided to continue with the calculated value once there are other studies that advance  
values closer such as the 43l/100km or the 50l/100km.  
 

 
4. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 per km and per pkm 

 
The calculation of the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency factors 
followed the methodology described on chapter 3.3.4, being the last step needed to fill the 

final energy and CO2 efficiency tables. Figure 141 and Figure 142 of Annexes show the 
complete energy and CO2 efficiency tables.  
 

 
5. Finding total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel final energy and CO2 quantities 

 
The calculation of the final energy and CO2 quantities used the same methodology as before. 
It multiplies each calculated factor per pkm obtained before by the calculated passenger 

mobility demand for each energy type.  Figure 143 and Figure 144 of Annexes show the final 
values.

6. Bus results 

 
The following chart resumes the well-to-wheel energy distribution by the bus sector.  

 

 
Figure 96 – [B us ] W TW e nergy distri bution.  

 

 
The inner ring shows that about 96% of the energy consumed by the bus segment is in forms 

of blended diesel (with biodiesel), with the remaining 4% in forms of natural gas. From the 
second ring it is possible to conclude that about 14% of the well-to-wheel energy consumed by 
the bus sector refers to the case of blended diesel. 

A similar format was obtained for the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions:

4.3.5. The calculation flow: car 
 
Understanding the energy and CO2 well-to-wheel situation of the car sector was of especially 

interest for purposes of this dissertation however it was performed through a different 
methodology. Hence, it was also required to consider the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency 
differences between engine types (gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG) and the correspondent 

differences on the amount of passenger mobility by energy type.  
 

 
Energy and CO2 data 
As explained before, the “JEC Biofuels Programme” provides a very good level of detail for 

purposes of this dissertation. It was possible to directly input the total tank-to-wheel energy 
data for each engine type as well as the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency for the 

average car fleet in 2007.  
In spite of the internal and confidential matters, it is not possible to provide the detailed tank-
to-wheel energy data. Therefore, Table 43 shows the approximate data that was used on this 

dissertation for the passenger car segment: 
 

Table 43 – [Car ] “J EC Bi ofuels Progr amme” details [12]. 

 Energy PJ MtCO2 

Gasoline ~4.000 PJ ~300 MtCO2 

Diesel ~3.000 PJ ~200 MtCO2 

LPG ~200 PJ ~10 MtCO2 

CNG ~5 PJ ~0 MtCO2 

Bioethanol ~40 PJ 0 MtCO2 

Biodiesel ~100 PJ 0 MtCO2 

Annual mileage (x10
9
) ~3.333km 

Average consumption ~2 MJ/km ~200 gCO2/km 

 

 
Note: it should be clear that it is not possible to provide a ll the exact energy and CO2 

quantities from the “JEC Biofuel P rogramme” however, in all the calculations realized within 
this dissertation, the exact values were used.  
 

Similarly to the exercise realized for the bus, here it was used a scenario where there are not 
biofuels in use (only fossil) and then built a real situation considering the biofuels in use in 

2007. The calculation of the “only fossil energy scenario” is the result of summing up the 
biofuel into the respective fossil fuel:

1. Calculate the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per pkm 

 
Given the Eurostat car passenger mobility data, 4.760bpkm [11], it was possible to build an 

average energy and CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency factor. Here it was used the value of only 
fossil energy to represent the energy situation without taking into account the presence of 
biofuels. 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

Although it was decided to use the calculated values from the “JEC Biofuel Programme ”, 

Table 44 summarizes a comparison with other studies.

Value of this dissertation 1,5 110 

[29]  75 

[30] 0,57-4,65 125 

[47] 1,64  

 
 
The values were selected in such a way to provide a kind of „extreme? scenarios on the energy 

and CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency factors.  
The next step should be the characterization of the average occupancy rate in order to continue 

with the calculation of the energy and CO2 factors per km.  
  
 

2. Finding the occupancy rate 
 

The calculation of the occupancy rate was realized in a different way when compared to the 
other sub- modes. The objective was not to calculate the average maximum seat capacity of the 
European car fleet but to directly input a value of passengers per car. 

 
Here, and with the objective of having all variables mathematically related on both energy and 

CO2 tables, it was decided to not search within the literature for an occupancy rate value but 
to calculate which occupancy rate would result from the usage of the annual mileage of the 
“JEC Biofuels Programme” and the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat. The following 

equation shows the calculation: 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  127 

 

 
 

 

 
It was divided the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat by the total amount of kilometres 

travelled by all passenger cars in the EU, resulting on the average number of passengers/car.  
Comparing to other external sources, the calculated value corresponds to the range of average 
occupancy rates provided by the European Energy Agency in its publication [34]: 1,56; 1,69; 

1,53; 1,78; 1,54. 
 

 
3. Finding detailed engine type tank-to-wheel energy efficiency 

 

As described before, o ne of the objectives of this dissertation and in particular of this chapter 
was, on one hand, to attempt to reproduce the real passenger mobility situation between 

gasoline and diesel cars, given their d ifferences on energy efficienc y; and on other hand to 
mathematically relate the passenger mobility activity on the passenger car segment by energy 
type. 

To solve this problem, it was decided to build a small equation system in order to calculate the 
differences on the tank-to-wheel energy consumption which might exist between the four 

considered engine types: gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG. This equation system was used 
afterwards to calculate the individual passenger mobility for each energy type.  
The following matrix shows the mindset for this calculation:  

 
 

 Eq.14  

 
 

The “FC g”, “FCd”, “FC lpg” and “FCcng” represents the tank-to-wheel fuel consumption (FC) 
of gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG cars respectively. 
The “PKM” means the passengers-km for each energy type of gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG.  

The “JEC” means the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the “JEC Biofuel 
Programme” for each energy type of gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG.  

 
 
Mindset explanation 

 

The idea was to multiply each “FC ” factor by the correspondent “PKM” value in order to have 
the tank-to-wheel energy data provided by the “JEC Biofuels Programme”. The following 

equation shows the idea: 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

128 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 Eq. 15 

 
 
Once it was assumed that the occupancy rate does not vary with the energy type, it was 

possible to realize this exercise using the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of 
energy/pkm. 

 
As a boundary condition of the equation system, the sum of all “PKM”? should be equal to the 
value provided by the Eurostat on the passenger mobility for cars: 4.760bpkm.  

 
 Eq. 16 

 
 

Methodology explanation 

 

Having defined the equation system and its boundary conditions, the next step is to construct 
several relations that allow the replacement of variables such as the “FC ” to simplify the 
equation system and reduce the number of unknowns. 

Here, it was decided to create percentage relations between each “FC ” factor for each energy 
type, in order to represent their combustion efficiency differences. This exercise was realized 

under the methodology that assuming a reference tank-to-wheel energy efficiency for gasoline 
engines (FC g) as “x ”, all the other remaining “FC ” will come in function of the gasoline “x”. 
 

Hence, and as reported before, the “JEC Well-to-Wheels” study provides tank-to-wheel 
energy consumption data for each power train and fuel type. Within its results, it was possible 

to build four average tank-to-wheel energy co nsumptions for each engine type. The results are 
presented on Table 45 with the associated variation to gasoline.  
 

Table 45 – [Car ] Energ y efficiency variati ons (% ) to gasoline [17]. 

 JEC MJ/100km Var to gasoline % 

Gasoline 217 n.a. 

Diesel 183 -15,5% 

LPG 224 +3,5% 

CNG 225 +3,9% 

 

 
The table shows that the diesel tank-to-wheel energy efficiency is about 15,5% lower when 

compared to the gasoline one, and that the respective LPG and CNG efficiencies are about 4% 
higher.  
Having these percentage relations respecting the gasoline,  it was possible to update the 

previous equation system in function of “x”: 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  129 

 

 Eq.17  

 

 
Having the other two additional boundary conditions: 

 
 Eq. 16 

 
 Eq. 18 

 
 

It was possible to solve and calculate the final solution: 

 

  

 

 
Table 46 shows the approximate results: 

 
Table 46 – [Car ] Equation syste m results. 

MJ/pkm Values of this dissertation Other studies 

Gasoline ~1,5 1,79 [47] 

Diesel ~1,4 1,42 [47] 

LPG ~1,7  

CNG ~1,7 1,44 [47] 

 

 
Similarly to Table 44, this table also attempts to show that it is possible to find different tank-
to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm values for each fuel type. Despite, for example, the large 

difference calculated for the compressed natural gas engine, it was decided to not change the 
calculated values and use them as they were calculated. 

 
 

4. Calculate the passenger mobility data by energy type 

 
With the previously calculated factors and having the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption 

provided by the “JEC Biofuels Programme ”, it was possible to calculate the correspondent 
passenger mobility data for each energy type. Here is the example for gasoline: 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

130 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 
 

 
 

Realizing the same exercise for the other energy types, the final results are obtained and 
presented in Table 47: 
 

Table 47 – [Car ] P assenger mobility by energy type.  

bpkm Passenger mobility 

Gasoline ~2.700 

Diesel ~2.000 

LPG 97 

CNG 3 

 
Through this methodology, it was possible to individually characterize the passenger mobility 
situation on the car sector by the four used energy types, taking into account the potential 

combustion efficiency differences of each engine type. This was a very interesting level of 
detail for purposes of this dissertation. 

As a reminder note, this methodology does not provide an exact European average situation, 
but using the same data sources as for the other calculations, it was possible to build a 
potential European figure. These values can already be introduced on both energy and CO2 

tables as showed in Figure 147 of Annexes. 
 

 
5. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km 

 

Having calculated the figures of tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm, the calculation only 
requires the multiplication by the occupancy rate. Here is the example for gasoline: 

 

  

 
 

And the final results for the other engines on Table 48:

Gasoline ~2,8 

Diesel ~2,5 

LPG ~2,8

These values would correspond to the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of the car fleet 

by energy type. It is possible to conclude the higher energy efficiency of the diesel engines 
compared to the remaining energy types, which results from the assumptions taken behind 

on % tank-to-wheel energy efficiency reductions as described in Table 45. 
Within the literature, other values were found as showed in Table 49: 
 

Table 49 – [Car ] Comparison of e nergy efficiency.

6,6 l/100km (2,37MJ/km) [19] 
7,7 l/100km (2,76MJ/km) [19] 

The comparison between the calculated values and other studies on the topic leads to the 
conclusion that the calculated values are within the range of other studies. 
 

 
6. Finding well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency per km 

 

Similarly to the exercise realized for the bus, the same methodology was applied to the car 
sector to find the well- to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency factors, both for 

the case of only fossil and with biofuels.  
 
 

7. Finding total energy and CO2 well-to-wheel quantities 
 

This calculation was the result of the multiplication between the energy and CO2 efficiency 
factors in terms of energy/pkm and CO2/pkm and the calculated passenger mobility data by 
energy type calculated on the point number 4.

8. Passenger car well-to-wheel results 

 

 
Figure 98 – [Car] WTW energ y distri bution.  

 

 
The detail level reached on this calculation allowed to discover, for example, that about 6% of 

the total well-to-wheel energy consumed by the car sector refers to the total amount of well-to-
tank energy consumed by the passenger diesel car segment (second ring, green).  
 

The inner ring shows that about 60% of the total energy consumed by the car segment is in 
forms of blended gasoline (with bioethanol), followed by the blended diesel with about 38%.  

A similar format was obtained for the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions: 
 

 
Figure 99 – [Car] WTW CO2 distri bution.

4.3.6. The calculation flow: motorcycle 
 
As explained on the chapter 4.3.3, the energy data for the remaining sub- modes: moto, van 

and freight is already calculated. Table 50 shows the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption 
and CO2 emissions for the motorcycle sub- mode: 
 

Table 50 – [Moto] TTW  energy and CO2 quantities. 

 Energy PJ MtCO2 

Moto 128 9 

Gasoline 126 9 

Bioethanol 2 0 

 
 
As explained before, the transport sub-mode of motorcycle was considered to run only on 

gasoline and therefore the passenger mobility presented by the Eurostat (152bpkm [11]) would 
run only on gasoline.  The associated tank-to-wheel energy efficie ncy in terms of energy and 

CO2 per pkm is so: 
 

  

 

  

 
 

Finding the occupancy rate 

 
On the impossibility to find a representative value of occupancy rate for the European level, it 

was taken the decision of assuming 1.1. Given the low importance of this segment for the total 
energy consumption and CO2 emissions from transport, it was considered that this assumption 

would not provide important errors to the total transport picture.  
 
 

Finding the energy and CO2 final values 

 

Similarly to the previous exercises, the calculation of all well-to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well-
to-wheels values relies on the same methodology used before. Therefore, it is already possible 
to fill up all the columns in both the energy and CO2 tables as showed in Figure 148 and 

Figure 149 of Annexes. 
 

 
 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

134 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

4.3.7. The calculation flow: van 
 
As explained on the chapter 4.3.3, the energy data for the remaining sub- modes: moto, van 

and freight is already calculated. Table 51 shows the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption 
and CO2 emissions for the passenger Van sub- mode: 
 

Table 51 – [Van] TTW energ y and CO2 quantities. 

 Energy PJ MtCO2 

Van 875 62 

Gasoline 102 8 

Diesel 745 55 

Bioethanol 1 0 

Biodiesel 26 0 

 

 
As explained before, according to the Tremove model the passenger Van was considered to 

run both on gasoline and diesel. Here, and similarly to the bus segment, no differentiation was 
made between the two energy efficiencies for gasoline or diesel engines, being assumed to be 
the same. 

The Eurostat does not publish any value of passenger mobility for vans, being used for 
purposes of this dissertation the value published by the Tremove model: 303bpkm [15]. 

 
The following equation shows the simple way on how was calculated the average tank -to-
wheel energy efficiency in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm: 

 

  

 

  

 
 

This figure is slightly higher compared to the figures of passenger car, but it was assumed as 

normal once by general knowledge, vans are more energy intense than passenger cars.  
 

 
Finding the occupancy rate 

 

It was not decided to study in the details of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of passenger 
vans. In that case, only for representative matters, the occupancy rate assumed in this case was 

the same as for passenger cars: ~1,5. 
 
 



Model development and calibration  

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  135 

 

Finding the energy and CO2 final values 

 

Similarly to the previous exercises, the calculation of all well-to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well-

to-wheels values relies on the same methodology used before. Therefore, it is already possible 
to fill up all the columns in both the energy and CO2 tables as showed in Figure 150 and 
Figure 151 of Annexes. 

 
 

4.3.8. The calculation flow: freight 
 
As explained before, the evaluation of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions for freight 

transport will not be as detailed as the previous calculations. The objective of this calculation 
was only to determine the contribution from the freight transport sector for the overall 

transport well-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions. No calculation of energy 
efficiencies between truck or light duty vans were made, as well as no research on the average 
load factors for trailers, semi-trailers or other kind of support. 

Figure 100 and Figure 101 show the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities already 
calculated before, together with the introduction of the well-to-tank and well- to-wheel 

quantities.

Figure 101 – [Freight] Comple te CO2 de tails. 

 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

136 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

From the calculation, it was possible to conclude that the freight transport segment emitted 

about 356MtCO2 on the well- to-wheel basis, resulting from the combustion of about 4.005PJ 
of diesel and 140PJ of Biodiesel (considered as zero on the tank-to-wheel basis). 

 
 

4.4. Sea transport sector 
 
Similarly to the freight transport case, the well-to-wheel sea sector contribution for the total 

energy and CO2 emissions was calculated with a simple methodology. Once was not required 
to individually study differences according to the craft type, boat or vessels, it was possible to 
take directly the value from the Eurostat?s database, which represents the tank-to-wheel 

energy and CO2 emissions. Here, and differently from the road transport mode, the Eurostat 
data shows that no biodiesel is c urrently being consumed by the sea transport mode. 

 
In relation to the passenger mobility and freight transport, given the discrepancy between the 
ton-km transported compared to the pass-km announced by Eurostat, 1.679tkm vs 41bpkm, it 

was considered that the Sea sector is currently being used for freight transport purposes.  
Table 52 shows the energy Eurostat data for Sea sector: 

 
 

Table 52 – [Sea] Eur ostat energy data [11]. 

PJ  

Gasoline 13 

Diesel 177 

Residual oil fuel 81 

 

 
For simply the problem it was assumed that all energies are considered as being diesel, in a 
total amount of 6.467ktoe. Converting to CO2, this corresponds to about 20MtCO2. The 

values could already be introduced on the total tables as showed in Figure 152 and Figure 153 
of Annexes.

4.5. Driving domain study (urban areas) 
 
Resulting from the internal analysis on mobility driving patterns, it was possible to input data 

on the passenger mobility demand for the sub- modes: airplanes, metro/tram, normal- and high-
speed rail, bus, car, moto and van, according to the three defined driving domains: urban, rural 
and highway. It is not possible to describe the detailed methodology behind this calculation, 

but as a principle review, these  three main driving domains were calculated on the basis of six 
national mobility surveys fo r the member states of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the 

Netherlands and the United K ingdom, which provided data on the percentages of passengers 
travelling on those driving domains.  
 

Methodology 

 

Resulting from the analysis, it was defined that distances up to 40km were considered to be 
urban (short distance), and distances higher than 80km considered as highway (long distance), 
being Rural (medium distance) in the range of 40-80km.  

The principle behind this decision of 40km for short distance was based on the circular 
dimension of 115 European cities, where their average radio is about 20km. 40km would 

correspond to a trip in both ways, go and back. The decision for 80km as long-distance was 
based on the psychological behaviour of people which means that distances more than 80km 
corresponds to about 1h driving, which is considered as a long-distance trip for the majority of 

the people. 
 

 
Driving domain distribution 

 

The definition of short, medium and long-distance should be done for each individual sub-
mode, as it is considered as no  sense divide urban areas for airplanes, as an example. For 

purposes of this dissertation the objective was to study in relation to the road sector, and so it 
was decided to apply the same distribution for all modes and sub- modes. 
Table 53 summarizes the calculated percentages assumed on this dissertation: 

 
Table 53 – [Ur ban] – Dri ving domain percentage distri bution  [51]. 

 Urban Rural Highway 

 0-40km 40-80km &gt;80km 

Air 0% 0% 100% 

Metro 100% 0% 0%

Bus 83% 6% 11% 

Car 60% 14% 26% 

Moto 84% 16% 0% 

Van 60% 14% 26% 

 



Model development and calibration  

 

138 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 

As a limitation of the available data on the national surve ys, only the passenger transport sub-
modes such as bus, car and motos were considered. Therefore, it was assumed that the air 

sector perform trips only on longer distances (100% above 80km), the rail sector was decided 
to perform equally distributed distances (33% for each distance), the metro was considered to 
perform only distances within urban areas (100% 0-40km), and the passenger vans was 

considered to have the same distribution as cars.  
A special note on the rail sector, in the case of high-speed rail it was assumed to be only 

longer distances, and so the 33% only refers to the specific case of normal-speed rail. 
 
For example, applying the passenger car distribution to the Eurostat passenger car mobility in 

2007, the urban passenger mobility done by passenger car would be about 2.856bpkm: 
 

  

 

 
This value would correspond to the total amount of passengers-km realized on urban areas by 

passenger car according to the defined urban areas parameters.  
 
 

Driving domain results 

 

Applying the percentage distributions to each passenger mobility demand for each sub - mode 
of transport, it was possible to calc ulate and distribute all the passenger mobility for each case. 
Table 54 summarizes the passenger mobility distribution for each transport sub- mode:

The table shows that about 56% of the total passenger mobility was performed within the 

urban areas, and about 31% was performed on longer distances. Also, it is possible to calculate 
that within the urban areas the passenger car segment is responsible for about 75% of all 

mobility demand. Also, it presents a large importance at the long-distance mobility demand.  
Figure 102 attempts to provide a visual picture of the previous table: 
 

 

 
Figure 102 – [Ur ban] P assenger mobility distri bution by dri ving domain.  

 
 
From the inner ring, it is possible to confirm that urban areas are responsible for about 56% of 

all passengers-km in 2007, followed by long-distance transport with about 31%. From the 
second ring it is possible to conclude the large importance of the car segment to the total 

passengers-km, about 41%. O n the long distance, the air sector appears as the second most 
important passenger mode, representing about 8% of total passengers-km, after car.

4.6. Model results 
 
This chapter visually presents the main obtained results for the transport energy and CO2 

scene in 2007, in a well- to-wheels basis. Its objective is to detail the passenger mobility 
segment and in particular the car sector. It is also required to provide the information of the 
urban areas contribution for the total energy and CO2 picture.  

 
 

Energy and CO2 well-to-wheel 
The following chart resumes the well-to-wheel energy distribution calculated on this 
dissertation, by transport mode. 

 

 
Figure 103 – [Model] W TW energy distri buti on  by mode. 

 

 
As expected, and confirmed by the inner sing, the road sector appears as the most important 

energy consumer on the total transport scene, account ing about 84%. The aviation appears 
with a relative weight of about 9%, followed by the rail sector, 5%.  
 

From the second ring it is possible to conclude the large importance of both the passenger car 
segment and the road freight transport to the total well-to-wheel energy consumption, 47% and 

27% respectively. The aviation sector appears as the second largest energy consumer with 
about 9%, followed by the passenger van segment 6%.

The well-to-wheel CO2 distribution shows a similar format:  

 

 
Figure 104 – [Model] W TW CO2 distri bution by mode . 

 
Since all main used energy carriers relies on oil, the CO2 emissions well- to-wheel distribution 

shows a similar format to the energy one, resulting in a same top players when it regards to  
CO2 emissions: passenger car, road freight transport and aviation.  
 

 
Energy and CO2 well-to-wheel by purpose 

The following chart attempts to provide a picture of the well-to-wheel energy distribution of 
the currently used energy carriers, according to the purpose: passenger mobility and freight 
transport.

From the inner ring, it is possible to conclude that the passenger mobility segment consumes 

about 70% of the total well-to-wheel energy co nsumed by the transport sector, being the 
remaining 30% for freight transport purposes.  

From the second ring, it is possible to conclude that blended gasoline and blended diesel are 
the main energy carriers currently used for passenger mobility purposes, 30% and 27% of the 
total well-to-wheel for transport. For freight purposes, b lended diesel is the main energy 

carrier consumed, representing about 29% of the total, followed by electricity 1%.  
 

The CO2 distribution presents a similar format as showed in Figure 106. 
 

 
Figure 106 – [Model] W TW CO2 distri bution by pur pose. 

 
Here just a small remark to the percentage distribution that reduced for the passenger mobility 

segment, as a meaning of the electricity usage as energy carrier, which reduces the well-to-
wheel CO2.

domain, only for the passenger mobility segment, by used energy type.  

 

 
Figure 107 – [Model] W TW energy for passenger mobility by dri vi ng domain.  

 
 
From the inner ring it is possible to conclude that the passenger mobility realized within the 

urban areas were responsible for about 52% of total passenger mobility well-to-wheel energy 
consumption, followed by the long distance passenger mobility with about 35%.  

From the second ring, it is possible to conclude that energy in forms of gasoline and diesel are 
the mostly used within the urban and rural areas, while on the long distance kerosene appears 
as the most important energy carrier, about 13% of the total.

5. Development of 2020 scenarios 
 
This chapter can be considered as one of the most important chapters for purposes of this 

dissertation, as it finally makes use of all the work previously realized. Its objective is to make 
use of the achieved structure and data of the transport 2007 model described on the 
Methodology and Model development and calibration, to realize several technical and non-

technical changes (through the input of external data sources), and finally to calculate and to 
compare the energy and CO2 well- to-wheel impacts to the reference case.  

Here it should be clear that this exercise will be realized only for the passenger mobility 
transport modes, and did not include any particular predictions or analysis for the freight 
transport segment.  

 
On a first step, will be analyzed the non-technical measures such as the increase on passenger 

mobility, the modal-shift into collective transport modes and the expansion of the high-speed 
rail, and on a second step, the technical measures such as the improvements on energy 
efficiency, the uptake of renewable energies and electric vehicles. Finally, all measures will be 

combined in order to prospect a likely scenario for 2020.  
It is not objective of this dissertation to study all possible scenarios but, based on the used data 

sources and internal calculations, to provide one likely future scenario.  
 
 

5.1. Non-technical measures 
 

Under the non-technical measures previously mentioned is the expected mobility demand (as a 
meaning of the business as usual scenario ), the modal-shift into collective transport modes  
such as bus, metro and railways, and the deployment of the high-speed rail infrastructure 

previewed by the trans-European networks for transport (TEN-T). 
 

 

5.1.1. Business as usual 
 
As a common exercise on the majority of energy and transport studies, is the development of a 
business as usual scenario (BAU). This is often calculated to provide the likely situation that 

might exist if no external changes on the analyzed system are implemented. It means that if no 
technical or other kind of progression happens, a variation on t he usage level of a random 

system will result in a proportional variation of its output results.  
Applied to the transport sector, the evaluation of a business as usual scenario takes as 
fundamentally changes the increase on the usage of transport (passenger mobility or freight 

transport) and as output the likely increase on its released CO2 emissions. 
 

The expected 2020 value of passenger mobility demand for the sub- modes analyzed on this 
dissertation was internally calculated and therefore, it is not possible to provide the detailed 
methodology behind its calculation due confidential matters. As a general overview, the 

methodology took  into account the expected population growth in both separately EU15 and 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

148 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

EU12, the expected evolution on the motorisation rates levels and the evolution on the inland 

passenger mobility use. 
Table 55 provides the information results for the calculated 2020 passenger mobility demand:

Van* 303 352 16% 

TOTAL 6.899 8.122 18% 

* Value d irectly co ming fro m Tre move.  

 

According to the calculations, it is expected that aviation will see the largest growth for the 
decade to come, almost doubling its passenger mobility demand. The iTREN study advances a 
value of 565bpkm [14] for 2020, but it cannot be compared to this one as it only includes 

intra-EU aviation. 
In case of the rail sector, the calculations showed that by 2020 it is expected an increase of 6%, 

till the level of 512bpkm, but did not took into account the expected deployment of the new 
high-speed infrastructures. Here, the iTREN advances a value of 616bpkm by 2020 which 
includes the expected new high-speed lines [14]. 

For the bus sector, the calculation showed an increase of 10%, to the value of 595bpk m, very 
similar to the iTREN value, 598bpkm [14]. In case of car segment, the calculations showed an 

increase of 11%, to the value of 5.280bpkm, which is also very similar to the value of the 
iTREN, 5.328bpkm [14]. 
The value for the van segment appears in italic as it was not internally calculated. The figure 

comes from the Tremove model for the year of 2020.  
 
The following chart provides the calculated passenger mobility evolution from 2007 till 2020. 

Particularly for the case of high-speed rail, it was assumed the same 6% increase in its value, 
from 89bpkm to 94bpkm. 

 



Development of 2020 scenarios

Figure 108 – [Future ] Expecte d passenger mobility de mand.  

 

It is possible to see that the passenger car will continue its dominant position as the major  
passenger player. It is also expected that the aviation will reinforce its second position 
followed by the bus sector.  

It was calculated that the passenger mobility demand will increase from its level on 2007, 
6.899bpkm, to about 8.122bpkm by 2020, which represents an annual increase of about 1,4%.  

 
Replacing the 2007 passenger mobility values by the 2020 ones on the reference case model, it 
was possible to project a business as usual scenario for the tank-to-wheel energy consumption 

and CO2 emissions for the passenger mobility sector: 
 

 

 
Figure 109 – [Future ] BAU e nergy for  passenger mobility. 

 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

150 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

On a business as usual scenario, the individual percentage increase on the energy consumption 

is directly proportional to the respective percentage increase on the passenger mobility 
demand, as there are no  other external variables such as energy efficiency or other type of 

additional measure. Due the different passenger mobility increases between all sub-modes of 
transport, the global increase is influenced by the differences on the energy consumption per 
pkm. That?s why the global increase on the energy for passenger mobility is about 23%, from 

the level in 2007 of 10.420PJ to about 12.773PJ by 2020.  
 

 

 
Figure 110 – [Future ] BAU CO2 for passenger mobility.  

 
 
The same happens for the CO2 situation. Once it is a business as usual, it was assumed the 

same biofuel energy blend as in 2007 (3% biodiesel and 1% bioethanol), and also the same 
share of renewable electricity as in 2007, 16%. 

Due the expected increase on passenger mobility demand, an increase of about 23% on the 
passenger CO2 emissions was calculated, 736MtCO2 and 906MtCO2 for 2007 and 2020, 
respectively.

5.1.2. Extreme modal-shift 
 
Given the detail level of the developed transport model, it is possible to realize many and 

different energy and CO2 assessments on the modal-shift variable. For instance, it is possible 
to evaluate the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the migration of 
passengers from bus into metro, from normal-speed running on diesel into car running on LPG, 

or for example from aviation into moto running on gasoline. 
 

For purposes of this dissertation, focus was given to the passenger car segment and its energy 
and CO2 modal-shift impacts into other collective passenger transporters. It was decided to 
test extreme well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the full- migration of 

passengers travelling by car, into metro, into normal- and high-speed and into bus, according 
to each maximum seat capacity.  

 
The realization of an extreme full modal-shift scenario was considered on this dissertation as a 
meaning of the maximum energy and CO2 well- to-wheel impacts that can be achieved given 

the current European transport situation. For example, in the case of the bus segment, if no 
additional extension on the maximum seat capacity, if no increase on the daily frequencies, or 

other type of measure, the bus segment is limited to carry a maximum number of passengers 
per vehicle, which was assumed on this dissertation as 60, as described on the Model 
development and calibration. The same happens for the other sub-modes. 

 
 

Note: many different scenarios could have been developed on the modal-shift variable but for 
purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to study in particular only the case of a full 
maximum modal-shift from the passenger car segment into the collective transport modes, and 

not study other modal-shifts scenarios. 
 

 
1. Calculate the maximum passenger mobility capacity for each sub-mode 

 

To calculate the impacts from a full modal-shift it was necessary to first calculate the 
maximum value of passenger mobility that can be transported by each analyzed sub- mode, and 

understand the potential capacity that each sub-mode can absorb from the car segment. 
 
The following equation shows the calculation for the bus segment. I f in 2007 the bus sector 

transported about 542bpkm with an average load factor of 33,5%, it means that at its 
maximum load capacity (100%), it could potentially transport about 1.617bpkm.  

 

  

 

 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

152 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

This situation would represent the case that the all the bus services operating in the EU will be 

always filled up, at a 100% occupancy rate factor. O f course it is clear that this situation is 
very unlikely to happen, but for purposes of this dissertation it was required to study the 

extreme scenarios as a meaning of the maximum CO2 and energy reduction that is possible to 
achieve given the current capacity of those collective modes.  
 

 
2. Calculate the additional passenger mobility capacity for each sub-mode 

 
Having previously calculated the maximum passengers-km capacity, the additional capacity 
that the bus segment can receive is the difference between the maximum capacity and the 

current situation (2007): 
 

  

 

 
This means that the bus sub-mode has the additional capacity to receive about 1.074bpkm, 

from any other sub- mode of transport.  
 
The same methodology was applied to the other sub- modes of interest in this exercise (metro, 

normal-speed and high-speed). Table 56 summarizes the current passengers-km situation, the 
maximum passengers-km and the additional that is possible to receive.  

 
Table 56 – [Future ] Addi tional passengers -km capacity by sub-mode. 

bpkm Eurostat 2007 Maximum Additional 

Bus 542 1.617 1.074 

Metro 86 246 160 

Normal-speed 395 1.079 684 

High-speed 89 129 40 

TOTAL 1.112 3.071 1.959 

 
 

This table can confirm two main important things: first the current lower usage of the public 
and collective transport modes which implies a large additional capacity possible to be filled 
up; secondly even if all of these sub- modes of transport would be filled up (100% occupancy 

rate), they could not absorb the passenger mobility demand currently performed by the 
passenger car: 4.760bpkm.  

 
In order to provide visual information, the following chart represents the situation of the 
previous table: 

 



Development of 2020 scenarios

Figure 111 – [Future ] Current and additi onal pk m c apacity of i nland modes. 

 

 
Visually it is possible to confirm the important additional absolute capacity that is possible to 
absorb by the sub- modes of normal-speed train and bus. 

 
Finally, it is now possible to compare the well-to-wheel energy and the CO2 emissions 
variations resulting from the increase in the modal-shift from the passenger car into the 

previously calculated four sub- modes of transport. Individual and agglomerated results are 
showed in the next chart with the respective co mparison with the current (2007) passenger 

transport situation: 
 
 

 
Figure 112 – [Future ] Energy modal-shift i mpac ts from passenger car. 

 
 

On a global scale, a full modal-shift from passenger car into these four analyzed transport sub-
modes could potentially reach a tank-to-wheel energy consumption reduction of about 16%, 
from the level of 10.420PJ to 8.725PJ, and a well- to-wheel reduction of about 11%, from 

12.512PJ to 11.125PJ.  



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

154 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

The great availability of free capacity on the sub- modes of normal-speed rail and bus largely 

contributes for this reduction potential, while the current lower seat capacity of metro and 
high-speed rail does not offer such a large potential of reducing the energy consumption.  

 
In a particular scale, all these four sub- modes of transport show a lower ta nk-to-wheel energy 
consumption per pkm when compared to the passenger car, which means higher energy 

efficiency. Additionally, it should be present that as much as the number of pkm number 
increases on these fo ur sub- modes, its energy efficiency per pkm increases, always favouring 

the modal-shift. It is therefore a cyclic positive effect. 
 
 

 
Figure 113 – [Future ] CO2 modal-shift impac ts from passenger car. 

 

 
Compared to the energy effect, the CO2 reduction effect from modal-shift is even larger due 
the higher contribution from the electric modes such as metro, normal-speed and high-speed 

rail, once they present 0gCO2/pkm on a tank-to-wheel basis.  
Globally, it could be potentially possible to reach a tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction of about 

19%, from the level of 736MtCO2 to 593MtCO2, and a well-to-wheel reduction of about 15%, 
from the level of 894MtCO2 to 762MtCO2. 
Similarly to the energy situation, the same effect happens with the CO2 emissions. As much as 

the passenger mobility increases on these modes, its CO2 emissions factor per pkm reduces, 
and consequently increasing the modal-shift reduction effect.

5.1.3. High-speed rail infrastructure 
 
Under the Trans-European Networks for Transport, re- launched by the Lisbon Treaty, it is 

expected a large deployment and implementation of more high-speed lines into the European 
Union transport network  for the decade to come [52]. These high-speed lines are expected 
allowing the migration of longer journeys between city centres, mainly performed by aviation 

and passenger cars, into high-speed trains. These journeys are commonly known by long-
distances trips between city centres, at the member state or intra-EU level. 

 
 

1. Find the expected future high-speed rail infrastructure 

 
To evaluate the energy and CO2 impacts resulting from its deployment, it was necessary to 

first represent the expected future picture on high-speed infrastructure. The information of the 
new high-speed lines that are expected to be completed by 2020 was collected, and then 
predict a likely passenger mobility demand and seat capacity that potentially exist by 2020.  

To start, Table 57 shows a summary of the kilometres already constructed, on going, a nd the 
when each project will be completed.

There are 30 priority projects that are previewed by the TEN -T and are expected to be in place 

by the year of 2020-2025. From these 30, about 22 involve the construction or upgrad e of rail 
lines, and the remaining 8 refer to road motorways, motorways of the sea, or other type of 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

156 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

projects. From those 22 rail priority projects, 9 involve the construction of high-speed lines 

and are those which are presented on the previous figure.  
 

On this dissertation is not the objective to study the progression status of each priority project 
or the projects country by country, but to study the agglomerated EU picture. From the 
collection of the data, it was possible to conclude that about 6.601km of high-speed lines are 

already in function, with about 11.222km remaining to be completed by 2020. With all high-
speed projects completed, it is expected that will exist about 17.823km of high-speed lines in 

the EU, which represents an increase of 170% respecting the current situation.  
As an example, the PP2 represents one of the oldest high-speed lines in the EU, the line 
between Paris-Brussels, with its latest expansion into Amsterdam and Koln, while the PP3 

represents the Iberian high-speed line, which is expected to link Lisbon to Madrid and to the 
rest of the EU. 

 
 

2. Find the expected future high-speed rail passenger mobility 

 
For calculating the expected passenger mobility demand that might exist by 2020, a very 

simple methodology was used. It was decided to calculate a mobility- infrastructure factor 
which means the number of passengers-km per km of completed high-speed line, and then 
apply it to the expected kilometres by 2020. For the current situation, comes: 

 

  

 

 
This means that, in average, about 13 thousand passengers travelled per km and per year 
within the already constructed high-speed lines. For 2020, it was assumed to use the same 

mobility- infrastructure factor and project a likely 2020 passenger mobility demand: 
 

  

 

 
Before continuing, it should be clear that it was not taken into consideration neither the 

number of high-speed rail operators, the potential new services that might appear, or any study 
of popularity of high-speed lines according to the region or country acceptance. In the reality, 
it is likely to happen an increase on the number of high-speed services in a larger proportion 

than the increase on kilometres of lines. This exercise was realized under the assumption that 
the increase on passenger mobility could be directly proportional to the available infrastructure.  

 
 
 

 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  157 

 

Similarly to the previously exercise, the following equations shows the calculation of the 

maximum passengers-km capacity expected by 2020. It is used the current load factor of the 
high-speed lines (68,7%) and the likely passenger mobility demand by 2020 for the high-speed 

rail segment: 
 

  

 
 

This corresponds to an additional capacity of about 260bpkm: 
 

  

 
 

3. Presentation of results 
 

For the presentation of the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts res ulting from a modal-
shift into the high-speed rail segment, it was decided to study only the long distance transport 
services. It means that it was only assessed on the modal-shift from aviation, from normal-

speed long distance, from bus long distance and passenger car long distance.  
The following chart attempts to represent the potential well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts: 

 
 

 
Figure 114 – [Future ] Energy i mpacts due  more  high-s pee d lines. 

 
 

The calculation of the energy well-to-wheel impact was interesting. From the calculations, 
both due either the higher average tank-to-wheel energy consumption per pkm of normal-

speed and bus, or either the lower number of long-distance passengers-km transported, the 
tank-to-wheel effect of modal-shift from these two modes into high-speed rail is about -0%, a 
slight decrease. It means that there is no big energy reduction resulting of a modal-shift from 

those modes into the high-speed segment. 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

158 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 

On the case of higher tank-to-wheel energy consumers per pkm, such as aviation and 
passenger car, the effect is considerable high, -6% for aviation and -3% for passenger car. On 

the well-to-wheel side, it was calculated as potentially possible to reach a -5% if a modal-shift 
from aviation and -2% if from passenger car. 
 

 
Figure 115 – [Future ] CO2 i mpacts due more high-s pee d lines. 

 
 

The CO2 profile is similar to the energy one : lower reductions if modal-shift from normal-
speed rail and bus, and higher effects if modal-shift from aviation and passenger cars. O n the 

tank-to-wheel basis, a potential 7% CO2 emissions reduction is reachable if there is a 
migration from aviation into high-speed, and 4% reduction if from passenger car.  
 

These are the potential energy and CO2 effects o f a modal-shift given the current perspectives 
of high- speed lines infrastructures by 2020. O n a global scale, the potential reduction is very 

small mainly due the lower EU seat capacity of the high-speed rail sector which is not enough 
to absorb the high amount of passengers-km currently travelling on the other sub- modes. 
However, it should be remembered that the effect in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm is 

much larger.

5.2. Technical measures 
 
Under the technical measures previously mentioned is the expected improvement on energy 

efficiency, the uptake of renewable energies such as biofuels and renewable electricity, and 
the uptake of electric vehicles.  
 

 

5.2.1. Energy efficiency 
 
Within all the potential energy efficiencies that might represent a large influence on the total 

energy consumption and CO2 emissions, is the energy efficiency expected by the car segment. 
As a major energy consumer and CO2 intense sector, the car segment offers the largest 
potential to contribute with energy efficiency improvements for the global reduction of 

transport?s energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Other sub- modes of transport such as 
aviation and the bus segment also expect to reduce its average fleet energy efficiency.  

 
It was decided for the other sub- modes such as the metro, the normal- and high-speed sector, 
that its energy efficiency would not considerable improve during the period between 2007 and 

2020, based on the assumption that the long- life age of the rail fleet together with the low 
replacement rate do not allow for a considerable energy efficiency improvement. 

  
 

1. Find the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency reductions 

 
For doing so, and as similarly realized on the Model development and calibration, the “JEC 
Biofuels programme” presents their own estimations on the expected energy efficiency 

improvements for the car segment. O nce more, and in spite of the attended internal meetings  
at Toyota Motor Europe, it is not possible to provide the exact details of the expected 

improvements, being possible only to provide a gene ral value which represents the major 
message on the average energy efficiency improvements of the car fleet, considered as 
representative for purposes of this dissertation. 

 
The average energy efficiency that is required for purposes of this dissertation is not the 

average energy efficiency of the vehicle stock, but the average energy efficiency of the current 
situation, taking into account the current profile patterns usage. As an example, if only newer 
cars were running, the real average energy efficiency would be very lower when compared to 

the stock energy efficiency, which would include the older cars that are not running.  
This consideration might be out of range if is taken into account all the assumptions behind 

however, mathematically and conceptually, this difference can potentially be a source of 
influence for the results.  
 

As a brief reminder of the “JEC biofuels assumptions”, the calculation of the car fleet energy 
efficiency improvements bases itself on three main pillars: improvements on the energy

efficiency of the new car sales, the scrap rate of older vehicles, and the annual mileage 

according to the average age of cars and engine type.  
As a general result of the “JEC biofuel programme ”, it was obtained that the average car fleet 

efficiency is expected to improve about 26 % in 13 years, from 2007 till 2020, which means an 
annual improvement of about 2% [12].  
For purposes of this dissertation, it was not made any differentiation between the expected 

energy efficiency improvements according to the engine type, being assumed the same value 
of 2% for the four engine types considered in 2007 (gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG).  

 
In order for giving an energy efficiency considerations for the other relevant sub -modes of 
passenger transport, such as bus and passenger vans, an annual average energy efficiency 

improvement of about 1,45% was assumed, as described on the “JEC Biofuel programme ” for 
the heavy duty sector [12]. This means a global improvement of about 19% from 2007 till 

2020.  
In the case of the aviation sector, the International Air Transport Association expects to reach 
an annual energy efficiency improvements of about 1,5%, which means a global reduction of 

about 20% till 2020 [53]. 
 

Table 58 summarizes the annual tank-to-wheel energy efficiency improvements assumed on 
this dissertation for each fleet sub-mode:

2. Presentation of results 

 
The following charts resume the tank-to-wheel and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 effects 
resulting from the improvements on the energy efficiency. Individual and the agglomerated 

results are shown for the passenger mobility segment.

The chart confirms the large potential of the car segment to reduce the overall passenger 
transport energy consumption, which largely contributes to the scenario in case of all 
improvements. In this case, the energy reduction represents the same percentage decrease as 

the assumed percentage on energy efficiency improvement, once neither the passengers-km 
activity, neither the occupancy rate, and others, was changed.  

 
In this scenario, it could be potentially achievable a reduction from the level of tank -to-wheel 
from 10.420PJ in 2007, into a level of 7.999PJ, and well-to-wheel from 12.512PJ into 9.718PJ.  

 
The following chart presents the same profile reductions in terms of CO2 emissions.  

 

 
Figure 117 – [Future ] CO2 efficiency i mprove ments impacts. 

 
 

Once more, given the high importance of the car segment, its energy efficiency improvements 
offer the largest potential to reduce the passenger transport CO2 emissions. Globally, and after 
all energy efficiency improvements, it could be po tentially possible to reduce the tank-to-

wheel CO2 emissions from the 2007 level of 736MtCO2 into 563MtCO2, and on a well-to-

wheel basis, it could be possible to reduce the emissions from the level of 894MtCO2 into 
699MtCO2. 

 
 

5.2.2. Biofuels 
 
In order to calculate the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the single 

uptake of biofuels, it was decided to use the biofuel blend mixture that came from the analysis 
of the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs), presented in Annexes. Table 59 
summarizes the calculated country and EU blends.

Therefore, it was tested a n 11% volume blend of bioethanol (E11) in gasoline, and  a 12% 

volume blend of biodiesel (B12) in diesel. Here, the biofuel effect was tested both on the 
passenger road and passenger rail diesel, as this last one can also potentially consume 

biodiesel. 
 
As reminder information and as previously mentioned, the consumption of biofuels has the 

high potential of reducing the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions (tank-to-wheel is zero) but given 
the current lower development state of its production technology, it presents a potentially 

increase on the well-to-tank energy consumption and CO2 emissions. 
The following charts provide the comparison between the reference case of 2007 and the 
scenario if NREAPs biofuels are in place.  

 

 
Figure 118 – [Future ] NREAPs biofuels energy i mpacts.  

 
 

As a result from the assumption of no differences on the comb ustion efficiency between 
biofuels and fossil fuels, the calculations presents a 0% tank-to-wheel energy variation. O n the 
other hand, the well-to-wheel energy consumption can potentially increase from the 2007 level 

of 12.512PJ to the level of 13.296PJ, which represents a global increase of 6%. 
 

Generally, the consumption of biofuels will always provide an increase on the well- to-wheel 
energy consumption given its higher energy- intensive production process. As additional 
information, the well- to-wheel energy impact can vary according to the considered biofuel 

crop or industrial process. For instance, considering biodiesel from rapeseed will present a 
different well- to-wheel energy consumption when compared to biodiesel from soya beans [24]. 

On this dissertation, it is not the objective of individually study each well- to-wheel energy 
variation according to the crop but, given the developed prediction tool, it is also possible to 
play with these variables and study this particular effect.

Figure 119 – [Future ] NREAPs biofuels CO2 i mpac ts. 

 

 
The published biofuels predicted by the NREAPs have the potential to reduce the passenger 
transport tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from the level of 736MtCO2 to 691MtCO2, which 

represents a reduction of 6%. O n the well-to-wheel basis, the biofuels could potentially reduce 
the overall CO2 emissions by 3%, from the 2007 level of 894MtCO2 to 867MtCO2. 

 
Once more, and similarly to the energy situation, the CO2 well-to-wheel variations highly 
depends on the assumed biofuel origin or crop. For example, the bioethanol pathway assumed 

on this dissertation corresponds to the sugar cane coming from Brazil, which under the 
renewable energy directive, presents one of the lowest factors in terms of gCO2 per MJ.  

 
 

5.2.3. Electric vehicles 
 
Currently, the usage of electricity as energy carrier for transport is only being performed by 

the rail sector, in the forms of metro, normal- and high-speed rail. In spite of the recent 
popularity gained by the electric vehicles segment, it was interesting to evaluate the potential 

CO2 reductions resulting from the replacement of conventional internal combustion engines 
by electrified ones. Conceptually, the migration into electric vehicles offers a 100% reduction 
on the tank-to-wheel emissions, and a lower (between 0-100%) on the well- to-wheel 

emissions. 
 
With the deployment of the renewable electricity sector expected by the National Renewable 

Energy Action Plans, the potential CO2 reduction resulting from the usage of electricity in the 
transport sector, both in forms of the rail sector and electric vehicles, is even larger. 

Additionally, with the expected expansion on the high-speed sector, the potential absorption of 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  165 

 

passengers-km into a more renewable electricity energy carrier offers an interesting potential 

to tackle transport emissions.  
Renewable electricity 

From the analysis of the National Renewable Energy Action P lans presented in Annexes, it 
was calculated that an increase from 16% into 36% on the renewable electricity share by 2020 
is potentially achievable, which means a reduction from the factor of 115gCO2/MJ into about 

89gCO2/MJ of electricity produced.  
 

 
Figure 120 – [Future ] Expecte d rene wable electricity situati on by 2020. 

 

 
Having in mind the past results on the modal-shift from the passenger car into the electrified 

rail sector, it was considered as not such important the CO2 reductions due the deployment of 
renewable electricity, due the lower usage of electricity for passenger mobility. It is known 
that a slight increase on the CO2 reduction will happen but given its lower amount of 

passengers-km, it was decided to not reproduce newer pictures of that situation.  
In spite of this factor, the following analysis will only focus on the expected penetration of 

electric vehicles on the passenger car segment, and its potential reduction due the deployment 
of the expected renewable electricity segment by the National Renewable Energy Action Plans.  
 

 
Electric vehicles 

Resulting from the analysis of the NREAPs, the electric vehicles segment is expected to 
constitute about 9,5% of the car fleet by 2020. Table 60 summarizes the country and EU 
electric vehicle situation:

For the calculation of its well- to-wheel CO2 impacts, it was decided to replace 9,5% of the 
2007 car?s passenger mobility demand (4.760bpkm) into electric vehicles, which means about 

452bpkm. Realizing this calculation it is possible to shift 452bpkm into electric vehicles and 
calculate the respective potential tank-to-wheel and well- to-wheel energy and CO2 variation.  
 

Additionally, it is also interesting to study the individual well- to-wheel energy and CO2 
impacts if a migration from the main urban transport sub- modes such as metro, normal-speed 

and bus would be performed into electric vehicles.  
 
 

 
 



Development of 2020 scenarios

1. Electric vehicle well-to-wheel impacts with 16% renewable electricity share 
 

On a first calculation, it is realized an individual analysis between all main urban sub- modes in 
order to compare the individual energy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts resulting from a 
modal-shift into electric vehicles. Here, it should be mentioned the conditions behind this 

calculation. 
 

It was decided to always kept the same passenger mobility demand as a boundary condition of 
these calculations, as well as the 2007 passenger-km performed by the other engine types.  
Also here, once the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from electric vehicles were considered as 0 

on this dissertation, it is expectable that the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions of the passenger car 
segment will always remain the same as the 2007 in case of a modal-shift from other modes 

into passenger car electric vehicle segment.  
 
With these assumptions, it was possible to calculate the impact only due the migration of 

passengers-km into electric vehicles, fixing the rest of the other components. 
The following charts attempt to provide a potential energy and CO2 variations resulting from 

the individual migrations: 
 

 
Figure 121 – [Future ] Electric ve hicle energy i mpacts.  

 
 
For this evaluation, it was necessary to assume a tank-to-wheel energy consumption for 

electric vehicles, which was about 150W h/km [51]. After applying the methodology used on 
the Model development and calibration  for the electric drive modes, it was possible to 

conclude that the electric vehicle well-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of energy per 
pkm is about 1MJ/pkm. 
 

According to the 2007 model, the value of 1MJ/pkm appears as considerable lower to the 
value of metro (1,6MJ/pkm), but very similar to the values of normal-speed rail (1,1MJ/pkm) 

and bus (0,9MJ/pkm). This is one of the factors that influence the lower energy variatio n for 
these sub-modes of transport, together with the fact that a lower number of passengers-km are 



Development of 2020 scenarios

shifted. In the case of bus, there is a slight increase (0,1%) on the well- to-wheel energy 

consumption. 
As expected, the case of passenger car is the one that shows the largest variation, once the 

calculated well-to-wheel energy consumption per pkm was about 1,7MJ/pkm.  
 
In a scenario where the main passengers-km performed in urban areas (excluding motos and 

passenger vans) are shifted into electric vehicles, a potential 36% reduction on the tank-to-
wheel energy consumption is achievable, from the 2007 level of 10.420PJ into 6.723PJ. The 

respective well-to-wheel energy reduction can amount to 17%, from 12.512PJ to 10.538PJ.  
 
On the likely real 2020 scenario for electric vehicles, the NREAPs situation, it was calculated 

that the tank-to-wheel energy consumption could potential reduce about 5%, to the level of 
9.876PJ, with the respective well-to-wheel reduction of about 3%, to the level of 12.159PJ.  

 
The following chart provides the CO2 well-to-wheel impacts. 

 

 
Figure 122 – [Future ] Electric ve hicle CO2 i mpac ts. 

 
 
Resulting from the tank-to-wheel energy consumption previously assumed for electric vehicles, 

it results on a well-to-wheel CO2 efficiency per pkm of about 40gCO2/pkm. In this case, this 
factor is the lowest when compared to the four analyzed sub- modes of metro (63gCO2/pkm), 

normal-speed rail (52gCO2/pkm), bus (69gCO2/pkm) and passenger car (129gCO2/pkm). 
That?s why the percentage CO2 well-to-wheel impacts are higher when compared to the 
energy ones. 

 
A migration from metro into electric vehicles could potential reduce the well- to-wheel CO2 

emissions on about 0,2% (once the tank-to-wheel remains 0), the case of a migration from 
normal-speed rail it could be possible to reduce about 0,2% (due the larger amount of 
passengers-km and the diesel effect), and from bus about 4% on the tank-to-wheel and 2% on 

the well- to-wheel. 
 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  169 

 

The passenger car potential CO2 reduction is the highest, as expected. Both due the large 

amount of passengers-km on urban areas, as well as the higher CO2 efficiency factor per pkm, 
a shift into electric vehicles could potentially reduce the passengers transport tank-to-wheel 

emissions in about 40%, from the 2007 level of 736MtCO2 to 424MtCO2, and a well-to-
wheel reduction of about 29%, from the 2007 level of 894MtCO2 to 639MtCO2. 
 

A full uptake of electric vehicles in urban areas, excluding moto and passenger vans, offers the 
potential of reducing the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions in about 46% and the well-to-wheels in 

about 31%. Remember that the effect could be potentially higher if passenger vans would be 
also included. 
 

The NREAPs uptake of electric vehicles on the passenger car segment can potentially reduce 
the passenger transport tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions in about 7%, to 687MtCO2, and the 

well-to-wheels in about 5%, to 850MtCO2. 
Once this case was considered the real one for purposes of this dissertation, as it represents the 
results of the analysis of each me mber state report, it is now assessed the CO2 impacts if the 

expected renewable electricity by the NREAPs is implemented.  
 

 
2. Electric vehicle well-to-wheel impacts with 36% renewable electricity share 

 

The following chart, shows the scenarios if the renewab le electricity increases from 16% to 
36%, in the case of the extreme scenario of all urban areas shift into electric vehicles, as well 

as the NREAP scenario of 9,5% of passenger car segment.  
 

 

 
Figure 123 – [Future ] Rene wable  electricity i mpact. 

 
 

Given the current situation in 2007, the single deployment of renewable electricity from 16% 
renewable into 36%, can potentially reduce in about 1% the well-to-wheel reduction, mainly 

supported by the normal-speed sector (the largest passenger-km mode running on electricity). 
 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

170 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Theoretically, as much as the penetration of electricity as energy carrier for transport increases, 

its CO2 reduction effect also increases. O n a scenario of full uptake of electric vehicles in 
urban areas, the CO2 reduction effect resulting from the deployment of renewable electricity 

into 36% renewable, can potentially offer a n additional 5% CO2 reduction when compared to 
the case of 2007, where was about 16% share.  
In the considered real case, the N REAPs, the deplo yment of renewable electricity can 

potentially additional reduce in about 1% the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions.  
 

 

5.3. Final scenario 
 

The development of a final scenario for the passenger mobility scene will rely on six main 
pillars: the expected 2020 increase o n passenger mobility demand, the deployment of new 

high-speed rail infrastructures, the expected improvements on energy efficiency, the projected 
biofuels, the renewable electricity share and electric vehicles both from the National 
Renewable Energy Action Plans. On the case of modal-shift, no scenario was made once it is 

already being assumed the passenger mobility for each transport sub- mode. 
 

The following chart shows the well-to-wheel energy impacts resulting from the uptake of the 
most likely analyzed variables: 
 

 

 
Figure 124 – [Future ] Energy final 2020 scenario.  

 
 
Considering all the technical and non-technical variables previously mentioned, it is 

potentially possible to reduce the tank-to-wheel energy consumption by 10% compared to the 
reference case, and about 2 % in a well-to-wheel basis. The low percentage well- to-wheel 



Development of 2020 scenarios 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  171 

 

energy reduction compared to the tank-to-wheel is influenced both by the uptake of biofuels 

and an additional increase on the usage of electricity.  
 

However, the potential CO2 reductions are higher, as showed in Figure 125.  

 
Figure 125 – [Future ] CO2 fi nal 2020 scenario.  

 
 

On the CO2 perspective, a potential tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction of about 16% is likely to be 
possible to happen, together with a 12% reduction on the well-to-wheel basis. Here, the usage 

of biofuels and electricity high influence the tank-to-wheel.

6. Results and discussions 
 

6.1. Case study results 
 

6.1.1. Rail 
 

1. The accuracy of the Ex-Tremis model 
 

The comparison between the Ex-Tremis with the Eurostat data showed that are large 
differences on both the diesel and electricity consumption. The exercise of interact the Ex-

Tremis data with the one published by the Eurostat allowed also discovering that might exist 
large discrepancies and might be obtained values that are out of range when it regards to the 
tank-to-wheel energy efficiencies.  

 
  

2. High-speed 
 
For example in the case of the high-speed segment, the calculation of a tank-to-wheel energy 

efficiency from the Ex-Tremis resulted in a value of 1,72MJ/km, largely different  (variation of 
98%) from the one coming from the INRETS study. It was necessary to search within the 

literature for typical tank-to-wheel energy consumption values for the most common high-
speed rail services in Europe. This allowed a better characterization of the high-speed rail 
segment in both energy consumption and occupancy rate.  

 
 

3. Metro 
 
Other example was the calculation of the metro tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm. In 

this case, using external data sources for the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km it was 
concluded that the occupancy rate was largely influencing the results. This fact was confirmed 

when it was compared with the values for tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm coming 
from other studies on the topic, which said that the occupancy rate should be different.  
 

 
4. Normal-speed 

 
The construction of the normal-speed rail details was realized on the opposite way as for the 
metro/tram and high-speed.  

Once it was already calculated the total tank-to-wheel energy for the passenger rail segment, 
the energy for metro/tram and high-speed was subtracted, resulting in the remaining quantities 

for the normal-speed segment, being not necessary the introduction of the tank-to-wheel 
energy efficiency per km or per pkm.  



Results and discussions 

 

176 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Also as opposition to the other rail modes, the reliance of the normal-speed segment in two 

energy carriers, diesel and electricity, did not help in dividing the Eurostat passenger mobility 
by energy type.  

It should be clear that these factors were a very potential source of errors in what regards the 
validation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km and per pkm.  
 

The input of the Tremove?s passenger mobility rail details was the considered way to use a 
representative European model for transport to help dividing the passengers-km from diesel to 

electricity.  
As a result, it was obtained that the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm was in line with 
several studies on the topic, which was a very good result in terms of validating the rail 

segment. However, the calculation of the occupancy rate with the objective of validating the 
tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km was also a delicate step. 

 
It should be very clear that the calculation of an average European occupancy rate for the 
normal-speed segment was not an easy task to perform. Introducing a value that represents the 

average European number of passengers per train needs to be carefully considered as it will 
largely influence the validation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km.  

 
In other hand, the current data on this matter is very critical in what regards data protection, 
confidentiality matters, policy restrictions, etc. When searching for values on occupancy rate, 

the major representative associations such as the International Union of Railways (UIC), the 
European Rail Industry (UNIFE), clearly announced the need to pay a certain amount of 

money to consult their annual reports and have data.  
In that case, it was decided to search for other studies on the topic. It was decided to collect 
values in such a way that allowed the definition of potential boundaries and to have a 

representative average value. For example, whether Wikipedia is a reliable source or not, it 
announces average seat capacity of 800seats/train, which was out of order (+200%) when 

compared to the used sources (average 263seats/train).  
 
 

5. Conclusions 
 

Once the rail segment was completed and with all mathematical relations defined, it was 
possible to test the influence of main problematic assumed values on the remaining ones. Once 
the model is mathematically related in all of its components, changing the major problematic 

values will result on a change in the other related values.  
 

For example, one of the doubts firstly found was the average occupancy rate of the metro or its 
tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm.  
In the way that the model was developed, changing the metro occupancy rate will directly 

influence the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumption of the normal-speed segment, which 
will influence its average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm and per pkm.  

 



Results and discussions 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  177 

 

Increasing the metro?s occupancy rate from 26 to its initial value of 91passengers/vehic le 

(+250%), resulted in an increase of the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumed by the 
normal-speed from 112PJ to 143PJ (+28%), and its respective tank-to-wheel energy efficiency 

per km from 33 to 42MJ/km (+31%). This happens since it was considered as constant the 
tank-to-wheel energy per km.  
There is therefore a potential influence on the rail segment. Here, and once the calculated 

tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of 32M/km was in line with the sources, the normal-speed 
occupancy rate would theoretically reduce from 96 to 74 (-23%). 

 
 

6. Results 

 
All the assumptions and calculations allowed discovering that the normal-speed segment is 

responsible for about 79% of the total well-to-wheel energy consumption by the rail sector, 
which amounted to about 977PJ. The metro and the high-speed segments were responsible for 
the remaining 14% and 7%, respectively.  

 
 

 
Figure 126 – [Results] Rail WTW energ y distri bution.  

 
The inner ring shows that the normal-speed segment is responsible for abo ut 79% of the total 

well-to-wheel energy consumption calculated on this chapter, with the remaining 14% for 
metro and 7% for the high-speed rail segment.  
From the second ring, it is possible to visualize the large importance of the normal-speed 

electricity consumption on the well-to-tank basis (44%), followed by the normal-speed tank-
to-wheel (19%), and by the normal-speed diesel tank-to-wheel (14%).

Figure 127 – [Results] Rail WTW CO2 distri bution.  

 
 
The inner ring shows that about 82% of the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions on the rail sector are 

emitted by the normal-speed segment, followed by the metro with 12% and 6% for the high-
speed rail segment. 

From the second ring, it is possible to see the large contribution both form the normal-speed 
diesel tank-to-wheel (22%) and the normal-speed electricity well-to-tank (55%). 
 

 

6.1.2. Road 
 

1. The accuracy of the Tremove model  
 

The Tremove model is one of the most complete road fleet databases at the European level. It 
provides detailed fleet composition in what regards to number of vehicles, by age, by power 

engine, by energy type, etc, by the sub-modes of bus, car, passenger van, moto and freight 
transport. Also, it provides information on the total ta nk-to-wheel energy consumption divided 
by the passenger mobility demand.  

 
In spite of its development year, about 1995-2000, it presents several negative points in what 

regards its accuracy. Large differences on the individual quantities of gasoline and diesel when 
compared to the Eurostat, which influences the gasoline differences on the car segment 
consists in a big error if it is required to study the road mode and its sub-modes.

2. The need to use the “JEC Biofuel Programme”  

 
The need to better characterize the road segment lead to the consultation of the “JEC Biofuel 

Programme”. Its energy quantities were considered as highly representative once they were 
the result of an integrated work from the vehicle fleet composition development, annual 
statistics on total travel mileage, as well as fuel consumption. Additionally (and of especial 

interest on this dissertation), the JEC quantities are in line with the ones coming from the 
Eurostat, with a global error of about 1,5%.  

This allowed the consideration of the “JEC Biofuel Programme” as a very reliab le source. 
 
 

2.1.Car 

 

Once coming from the “JEC Biofuel Programme”, the car tank-to-wheel energy quantities 
were accepted as they were received.  
The characterization of the energy and CO2 efficiencies at the car segment relied on the 

equation system that was developed to find the energy efficiency differences, as well as the 
passenger mobility demand by energy type.  

This methodology was developed in such a way to mathematically relate all variables and, for 
example, to project individual higher improvements on one vehicle powertrain compared to 
other. Additionally, and not studied in this dissertation but as motivation behind, it was 

developed to test the influence of the number of vehicles per powertrain with the respective 
improvements on energy efficiency. That would allow the single manipulation of each 

parameter and test the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 impact.  
 
The calculation of the value of occupancy rate as a result from the Eurostat?s passenger 

mobility and the “JEC ” annual mileage in km was viewed as the correct and exact way to 
mathematically relate these two quantities. It resulted in an average occupancy rate for  the 

European Union level in the same value as the European Energy Agency publication.  
 
 

2.2.Remaining road energy 

 

The remaining road total tank-to-wheel energy quantities resulted from the subtraction of the 
car total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the total road energy consumption. This step 
allowed the creation of several energy quantities that were distributed into the remaining sub-

modes of bus, moto, van and freight segment. Hence, the Tremove model was used to separate 
those quantities through the usage of relative weights (%).  

This methodology was viewed as enough representative with the objective of constructing a 
potential picture for those remaining sub- modes of transport.

2.3.Bus 

 
On the bus sector it was considered the same energy efficiency per pkm for the diesel and 

natural gas bus (0,81MJ/pkm) as a result of equally dividing the previously calculated energy 
for bus. This method allowed the establishment of mathematic relations between the energy 
quantities with the passenger mobility demand. This was viewed as a valid methodology to 

test the well-to-wheel impacts on future scenarios.  
Once the average tank-to-wheel energy per pkm as well as the occupancy rate was in line with 

other studies, was strange how the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km resulted in a higher 
value. The value of 16,4MJ/km seemed to be the upper value of the range of values found 
from other studies. 

Imagining that the bus would have a tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 13MJ/km (-
20%), it would increase the remaining rest-road-diesel energy quantity in about 7%. From this 

view point, this assumption is not viewed as having an important contr ibution for the 
remaining tank-to-wheel diesel, and would not influence the developed scenarios.  
 

 
2.4.Van 

 
It was calculated an average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 4,9MJ/km for both 
diesel and gasoline vans, resulting from the assumption of ha ving equal energy efficiencies.  

From the technical view point that is an invalid assumption.  
Remembering the JEC tank-to-wheel energy efficiency variations to gasoline, a diesel engine 

is about 15% more efficient than the gasoline one. That would reduce the total diesel for van 
in about 15%, with the respective increase on the available diesel for the rest-road-diesel in 
about 3%. As similarly to the bus case, a 3% increase would not bring additional influences 

for the developed future scenarios.  
 

The same happens for gasoline. Considering the extreme case of having a 15% higher value 
compared to 4,9MJ/km, it would result in the 15% increase on the gasoline consumption from 
van, and the respective reduction in about 12% on the total gasoline available for rest-road-

gasoline. Once the remaining gasoline goes only for the moto segment, it would correspond to 
a reduction of about 12% in the available energy for moto.  

 
 

2.5.Motorcycle 

 
Continuing the previous calculation, the 12% reduction of the tank-to-wheel gasoline for moto 

would reduce the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km from 0,92MJ/km to 0,81MJ/km.

3. Biofuels well-to-tank 

 
Once of the delicate points behind the model development might be the characterization of the 

well-to-tank biofuel contribution both at the energy and CO2 level.  
 
The used methodology was designed in such a way that allows the calculation of extreme 

scenarios, such as the 100% or 0% biofuel blend. Once the calculation takes into account the 
energy blend of the biofuels in the blended mixture, the well-to-tank will vary in the same 

proportion. That will always provide the results and not an error value (e.g. dividing by zero).  
 
Here, the big impact is the consideration of both the crop and the pathway.  

  
As described by the “JEC Well-to-Wheels” study, if it is being considered an ethanol coming 

from Wheat produced in a CHP plant using wood as fuel, it corresponds to a 194% ratio of the 
well-to-tank energy respecting to the tank-to-wheel. As opposition, if considering bioethanol 
produced from Wheat in a CHP using natural gas as fuel, the ratio would reduce to  about 

105%. The same happens for biodiesel.  
 

For the CO2 case, it was decided to use the default values published by the renewable energy 
directive for the most popular (assumed) biofuel pathways and crops.  
It was taken for example the ethanol coming from sugar cane from Brazil as well as the 

biodiesel from rapeseed, with the respective factors of 24 and 52gCO2/MJ. Similarly to the 
energy case, the big impact is the consideration of the crop and the pathway.  

For example, considering ethanol from wheat produced in a CHP plant using lignite as fuel, 
the factor would increase facto r from 24 to 70gCO2/MJ (+191%).  
The same happens for the biodiesel case. If instead of conventional rapeseed  would be 

considered the biodiesel produced from palm oil, it would increase the CO2 factor from 52 to 
68gCO2/MJ (+31%). 

 
The origin of the crop as well its production process and used fuel, largely influences the well-
to-tank energy and CO2 and by consequence the well-to-wheel. The consideration of average 

values for all situations provides also average energy and CO2 potential variations.  
It is possible to test these independent variations  with the developed model however they were 

not analyzed on this dissertation. 
 
 

4. Results 
 

The following chart resumes, in a simple way, the well- to-wheel energy distribution for the 
road transport sector between all analyzed transport sub-modes, both for passenger mobility 
and freight transport purposes. It has resulted to an energy quantity of 15.121PJ.  

All the sub- modes do not have the respective legend in order to simplify the chart, being only 
presented the relevant energy consumptions.

Figure 128 – [Results ] Road W TW  energy distributi on.  

 
 

It is possible to visualize that 67% of the actual well- to-wheel energy consumption on the road 
sector is for passenger transport purposes, being the remaining 33% for freight transport. The 
tank-to-wheel energy consumptions by the passenger car and the freight segment are largely 

contributing for these figures. It was interesting to conclude that the tank-to-wheel from bus 
(diesel) and van (diesel) presented the same order of magnitude as the well- to-tank for freight 

diesel and car gasoline.  
The CO2 well-to-wheel distribution presents a similar profile to the energy one, amounting to 
a total of about 1.095MtCO2.

6.1.3. Urban areas 
 
The internal input of the driving domain percentages, allowed to the characterization of the 

urban areas to the total passenger mobility picture. The following chart provides the well-to-
wheel energy distribution by energy type in function of the driving domain.  
 

 

 
Figure 130 – [Results] Dri ving domain W TW e nergy distri bution.  

 
Within the total well-to-wheel energy consumed for passenger mobility purposes (12.512PJ), 

about 52% are consumed within the urban areas, being the remaining 12% for rural and 35% 
for long distance.  
Within the urban areas, gasoline as energy carrier presents an importance of about 50%, 

followed by diesel with 44%. In long distances, kerosene is responsible for about 37% of the 
energy consumed, followed by gasoline (31%) and diesel (26%).

6.2. National Renewable Energy Action Plans 
 
The general analysis of the final energy consumption from the National Renewable Energy 

Action Plans did not require a special methodology or calculation for its evaluation. The 
presentation of the results at the European Union level was a result of the collection of the data 
from each national report.  

However, in the particular case of the transport sector, it was necessary to adopt a dedicated 
methodology for the calculation of potential biofuel blends as well as the potential market size 

of electric vehicles.  
Table 61 shows the principal results calculated from the N REAPs.

6.2.1. Biofuels 
 
Methodology 

 
Separating the rail+road energy data coming from each NREAP, with the road split into all 
energy carriers, were the major steps in this calculation.  

 
Calculating the rail total energy was viewed as correct exercise once it was used the renewable 

electricity absolute quantity and share published on the NREAP, as well as the electricity 
share in the rail sector provided by the Ex-Tremis model. 
 

The separation of the road energy into its major details such as gasoline, diesel and biofuels 
can be viewed as not exact. In fact, it is not exact once it was not considered on this 

dissertation the contribution of LPG and CNG. However, for e valuating the potential biofuel 
blends, the calculation of the LPG and CNG would not bring additional contributions.  
Evaluating the importance of gasoline and diesel in road was the used methodology to project 

future gasoline and diesel consumptions for each member state.  
 

 
Results 

 

Once the European Union did not require to the Member States to follow any specific 
roadmap for transport, the calculations showed the independent approach from all member 

states to the biofuel question. It resulted in about 27 different biofuel blends at European level, 
one by country. 
 

It was also interesting to conclude that the countries where the biofuel blends were low were 
generally countries where the relevance of electric vehicles was higher. It means that those 

countries decided their strategy to meet the target for renewable energy for transport in electric 
vehicles, instead of biofuels.  
In this case, there was a direct relationship between the countries with higher renewable 

electricity shares with the countries with low biofuel blend. For example Austria, Denmark, 
Italy, Latvia and Portugal, announced renewable electricity shares of 71%, 52%, 30%, 60% 

and 55% respectively, and a biofuel blend of E7-B7, E8-B7, E9-B9, E6-B4 and E3-B12, lower 
when compared to the EU avera ge blend of E11-B12.

6.2.1. Electric vehicles 
 
Calculating a potential number of electric vehicles in road by 2020 relied on the methodology 

of finding the total expected electricity to be consumed by 2020, and the expected annual 
electricity consumed by one electric vehicle.  
The calculation of the total electricity was viewed as a correct exercise once it consider the 

renewable electricity published by the NREAP, as well as its announced renewable electricity 
share by 2020.  

The expected annual electricity consumption by an electric vehicle came from an internal 
value and was considered as a potential reliable value for purposes of this dissertation. 
 

A potential European market size of about 20million EVs corresponding to about 9,5% of the 
automotive fleet seems to be a very high value when comparing to what is currently being 

announced by most of the Member States, about 2-3% by 2020 [54] [55]. 
Looking at the member state level, countries such as Austria and Ireland expect about 1million 
of electric vehicles which correspond to about 20% and 40% of its automotive fleet, 

respectively. That seems also impossible in the current context.  
 

Additionally, countries such as Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Slovakia 
and Spain expects to have about 10-15% of its automotive fleet in electric vehicles. This is 
also higher when compared to the European average.  

In absolute terms, the major contributors for the EU figure are the countries of Belgium (2M), 
France (4M), Germany (2M), Italy (4M), Spain (3M) and the United K ingdom (1M).  

 
Motivated by the electricity mix,  national economy, or Government incentives,  countries for 
example such as Austria, France, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Spain expects a large contribution of 

electric vehicles.  
Making the comparison between the electricity mix on these countries, there is a large 

tendency of the countries where hydro power is important to adopt the incentives for electric 
vehicles. More recently, new technologies such as wind power are motivating countries such 
as Denmark and Germany on the areas of electric vehicles and renewable electricity.

6.3. Final scenarios 
 
Resulting from the likely technology situation that might be in place by 2020, a potential 10% 

energy reduction compared to the reference case of 2007 is likely to happen.

On the CO2 case, a potential 16% tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction is likely to be reachable, 
followed by the 12% in the well-to-wheel.

From all the developed scenarios, those which present the largest potential to reduce energy 

consumption and CO2 emissions are the full modal-shift into collective modes, the energy 
efficiency improvements and the uptake of electric vehicles.  
 

 

Full modal-shift 

This was a theoretical exercise to test an unlikely situation: if happens a full modal-shift from 
passenger car into collective transport modes. Door-to-door service as well as comfort and 
privacy will keep key factors in retain this shift. Also, might be that in an extreme scenario of 

increasing the oil price into historic levels, the use of public transport will be chosen in 
depreciation of the usage of the private vehicle as concluded by the White Paper. 
 

 

High-speed rail infrastructure 

The lower energy and CO2 well-to-wheel efficiency per pkm of the high-speed segment 
compared to the aviation and private cars, offers the potential to largely reduce the energy 

consumption and CO2 emissions from longer journeys. However, the low deployment state of 
the high-speed infrastructure results in a low capacity to absorb passengers from aviation and 
passenger car. Therefore, in the short term the high-speed segment does not provide important 

energy and CO2 reductions, but offers an interesting potential for the long term.  
 

 

Electric vehicles 

The full uptake of electric vehicles that allows the replacement of all urban distances currently 

performed by IC E cars represents the best measure to reduce the overall well-to-wheel CO2 
emissions and energy consumption. However, from the analysis of the announced policies on 
the NREAPs for the major countries, it does not seem that the member states will favour the 

purchase of such quantity of electric vehicles. Both due the economic crisis as well as due the 
low charging infrastructure development, it does not seem that the expansion of the electric 

vehicle segment will have a full shift. 
Also resulting from the NREAPs, a 9,5% uptake of electric vehicles appears as the reality 
calculation case. The announced measures by each member state to the purchase of electric 

vehicles as well as low emission vehicles favour the smooth uptake of electric vehicles. Also, 
some Member States such as the Netherlands support also the construction of charging 

stations. 
 

 

Energy efficiency improvements 

One of the measures that allow for a large reduction in energy consumption and CO2 
emissions is the improvements on energy efficiency. This appears as one the most probable 

measure for the decade to come as it would not drastically change the social-transport habits 
(as the full modal-shift case) and also no need to have a special charging infrastructure (as the 

case of electric vehicles).  
From the NREAP?s measures, the purchase of energy-efficiency vehicles is also motivated 
and is under the „low-emissions? strategies of most of the countries.

7. Conclusions 
 
The need for decision makers to project future energy scenarios for the transport sector 

required the development of an interactive prediction tool allowing the manipulation of all 
parameters that are associated to the transport energy and environmental performance. Hence, 
it is highly recommended that the development of a reference case relies on data representative 

of the actual situation such as the one coming from the Eurostat. The need to characterize the 
expected 2020 transport energy situation with reliable and trustable data, lead to the analysis 

of external data sources such as the “JEC Biofuel Programme” together with each 27 Member 
State National Renewable Energy Actio n Plans. 
 

The methodology for the development of the 2007 reference case was designed in such a way 
to fit with the total quantities published by the Eurostat. This was the major condition behind 

all the methodology and calculations for each transport sub- mode. Summing up all the  
calculated tank-to-wheel energy, CO2 and passenger mobility quantities on this dissertation 
resulted in the published quantities by the Eurostat.  

 
 

Application of percentage energy weights 

The concept of using percentage weights o f energy quantities respecting to a total energy was 
the methodology used to transfer information present in both the Ex-Tremis and Tremove 

models, into the European reality. With this methodology it was possible to respect the energy 
distribution profile and apply it to any energy absolute quantity.  

In the absence of any additional specific type of information, data source or detailed model, it 
was decided to use this methodology for the characterization of different tank-to-wheel energy 
consumptions for some transport sub- modes. It was decided to consider as more important the 

profile information coming from the relevant European models such as Ex-Tremis and 
Tremove and to export and apply that profile to the Eurostat reality.  

 
 
Well-to-wheel scope differences 

One of the points of this dissertation that might be critical is the difference between the fossil 
liquid fuels and the electricity well-to-wheel scope. 

 
The JEC well-to-wheel scope accounts for the steps of extraction, transport into the refinery, 
refining and transport till the final consumption point, while the electricity adopted scope 

accounts for the primary energy needed to produce the electricity, and the transmission losses 
at the electricity grid to deliver the electricity at each final point (electric train or electric 

vehicle). 
In other hand, the electricity well-to-wheel adopted scope accounts for the primary energy 
needed at the power plant, and misses the energy needed for extraction, for transport into the 

power plant as well is eventual process or refinery.  
 

 



Conclusions 

 

192 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 

Well-to-wheel methodology differences 

The application of energy and CO2 ratios coming from the “JEC Well- to-wheels” was viewed 

a correct method to calculate the potential well-to-tank energy consumption and CO2 
emissions from the usage of fossil and liquid fuels. It was considered that there are no large 
variations according to the intensity of the tank-to-wheel energy or CO2 per km that might 

largely influence this value.  
 

On the electricity methodology, it was applied the average efficiency of European power 
plants, as well as the efficiency related to the transmission and distribution losses. In this case, 
it is viewed as respected the adopted scope.  

 
 

The JEC Biofuel Programme 

The “JEC Biofuel Programme” was the basic energy data source for having the total tank-to-
wheel energy and CO2 quantities. In the absence of any better representative and trustable 

data, the JEC appears as the most complete and actual European road energy data.  
After the input of the passenger car details coming from the study, building the car sector as 

well as the remaining sub-modes became a relative easy task to perform.  
 
 

The need to resort to external data sources 

Having representative average European data was the most difficult task to solve. The lack of 

data in what regards for the characterization of the average European transport situation seems 
both to be protected for confidentially matters or by non-statistics collection of data.  
Having for example the average number of passengers per vehicle, or its average energy 

efficiency, or its characterization by energy type, were some of most relevant difficulties of 
this dissertation. 

The absence of data lead to the search of studies dedicated for each topic allowing the 
assumption of variables with posterior calibration.  
 

 
Key achieved figures 

This dissertation allowed concluding that the transport sector consumed about 18.095PJ of 
energy and emitted about 1.288Mt of CO2, in a well-to-wheel basis.  
Road transport sector was the most important mode, respo nsible for 84% of the total energy 

consumption and 85% of the total CO2 emissions. Here, passenger cars were the most 
important transport sub-mode, representing about 47% of the total energy consumption and 

48% of the total CO2 emissions.  
 
The air transport sector was the second most important energy consumer and CO2 emitter, 

accounting to about 9% and 10% respectively, followed by the rail transport sector which 
accounted to about 5% of the well- to-wheel energy consumption and 3% on the well- to-wheel 

CO2 emissions. The remaining 2% were allocated to the sea sector.  
 



Conclusions 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  193 

 

Within the rail transport sector, the normal-speed segment is the most important player both at 

the energy consumer and passenger mobility transporter. It accounted for 79% of the rail?s 
well-to-wheel energy consumption, and 82% of the rail?s well- to-wheel CO2 emissions.  

 
This dissertation also concluded that the passenger transport segment was responsible for 
about 70% of the total transport?s well-to-wheel energy consumption, with the respective 69% 

on total CO2 emissions, being the remaining 30% energy for freight transport purposes.  
Under the passenger mobility segment, this dissertation concluded that urban areas are 

responsible for about 52% of the total well-to-wheel energy consumption, be ing the remaining 
12% consumed in rural areas and 35% on long passenger services. Once more, passenger cars 
are the most representative mode in both urban and rural areas, being the second player on 

long distance passenger mobility, after aviation (13%). 
 

From the analysis of the 27 National Renewable Energy Action Plans, it was possible to 
establish a better characterization of the future?s energy and transport situation by 2020.  
It resulted that by 2020, the electricity will come as 36% from renewable ene rgy sources, 

presenting a strong expansion of the wind sector. 
On the transport sector, the biofuel calculations for all EU resulted in a bioethanol blend of 

11% in volume and a 12% volume biodiesel blend. The electricity consumed in road 
announced by all Member States, allowed to a calculation of a potential market size for 
electric vehicles, which was calculated as 9,5% of the automotive fleet in 2007.  

 
Considering the expected passenger mobility demand by 2020, the expected energy efficiency 

improvements for the aviation, bus, passenger car and passenger van segments, the calculated 
NREAPs biofuel blends and electric vehicles by 2020, and finally the expected high-speed 
lines by 2020, it was possible to conclude that a 10% tank-to-wheel energy reduction is 

potentially achievable compared to 2007, together with a 2% well-to-wheel energy reduction. 
On the CO2 emissions case, a reduction of 16% and 12% tank-to-wheel and well- to-wheel 

respectively, is potentially achievable.  
 
  

The importance of the results 
The development of a detailed and comprehensive transport model allowed the well- to-wheel 

characterization of all of its main sub- modes, evaluating all the energy and CO2 contributions.  
Analysing each member state National Renewable Energy Action Plan from a car OEM 
perspective allowed the characterization of the potential biofuel and electric vehicle situation 

by 2020, identifying critical or opportunity markets that might affect future business.  
The projection of future scenarios based on the developed reference case through the input of 

the relevant sources of data constituted in a key tool for Toyota Motor Europe future business 
decisions.

8. Suggestions for future work 
 
From a theoretical view point, each parameter calculated on this dissertation would provide a 

potential and individual research work. Finding the average situation for each sub - mode of 
transport, as well as its variation by energy type requires the deep analysis of the European 
situation. 

 
The developed transport model can be further updated if the external input data or newer and 

more representative information comes up. The following organigram attempts to reproduce 
this idea. 
 

 
Figure 133 – [Conclusions] Potential data updates. 

 
 

This scheme suggests the different approaches that is possible to think about in order to update 
the transport model.  

 
 
Preliminary study: metro and high-speed

and the high-speed segments, it could be interesting to develop a study that collects the

number of services of each mode, then project likely energy consumption from those services, 

allowing the comparison of the gross energy impact.  
As a gross message, it could be interesting to see how many services and annual km are 

currently being performed both by the metro and high- speed. 
 
 

Preliminary study: occupancy rate 

 

It could be potentially interesting realize a research on the average occup ancy rate for all the 
metro and normal-speed services in the EU. For example, collecting information relative to all 
countries and build a EU picture.  

 
 

Preliminary study: bus energy efficiency 

 
It could be interesting to collect all the information related to bus services in the EU and 

characterize its average energy efficiency, and compare with the one of this dissertation to see 
if there are large discrepancies or not.  

 
 
Preliminary study: peak and non-peak hours 

 
Given the differences on energy consumpt ion profiles and on patterns on passenger mobility 

demand, the link between an energy transport model and the peak and non-peak hours study 
demand could be very interesting to perform. With this study, it could be potentially possible 
to study the best energy-on-time for the passenger mobility-on-time demand. Imagining in a 

hypothetical scenario, for any decision of passenger mobility demand, it could be selected 
which should be the energy to be used in that moment (or for that travel) to minimize impacts.  

 
 
Preliminary study: well-to-tank 

 
As an external and totally independent exercise, it could be interesting to analyze the total 

electricity produced at the EU and to separate all of its destinations. For example, some of 
them go to household, other to ind ustry and other for transport (rail), in a smaller amount. That 
type of analysis would provide another type of value that would be compared to the one of this 

dissertation.  
 

Also, on the “energy refineries” category of the Eurostat, it could be realized t he same 
exercise. Divide the released CO2 emissions into its details such as fuel for electricity 
production, fuel for household and fuel for transport. It is a hard but potentially interesting 

exercise, not only for purposes of this dissertation, but since other perspectives.

10.1. The National Renewable Energy Action Plans 
 

Article 4 of the renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC required member states to submit 

national renewable energy action plans by 30 J une 2010. These plans, to be prepared in 
accordance with the template published by the Commission, provide details roadmaps of how 
each Member State expects to reach their binding 2020 objectives for the share of renewable 

energy in their final energy cons umption. 
Member States must set out the sectoral renewable energy targets, the expected technology 

mix to have in place, trajectory and measures that they will undertake to drive their national 
energy markets into the deployment of renewable energy. The NR EAPs provide an overview 
of the three main energy sectors: heating and cooling, electricity and transport, in the uptake of 

renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption.  
 

For purposes of this dissertation, the electricity and the transport sector were considered as the 
most important ones. According to the template, Table 1 of each NREAP should describe the 
final energy consumption quantities of the three sectors, Table 10 should report the expected 

renewable energy consumption, and, on the transport sector, Table 12 should provide 
information on the expected renewable energy consumption by energy type.  

 
 

Final energy consumption 
 
Gathering all the information from the 27 Member States, it is expected that by 2020 the EU 

will have a final energy consumption of about 1.117Mtoe, essentially driven by the energy 
consumption on heating and cooling, which represents about 46% of EU?s final energy 
consumption. The electricity and the transport sector are expected to represent about 26% and 

28%. 
 

 
Figure 154 – [NREAP] EU’s final e nergy c onsumption.  

 



Annexes 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  217 

 

 

It is expected that by 2020, the European Union will present the same level of final energy 
consumption as in 2005 (when Bulgaria and Romania were not members) with a marginal 

increase of 0,3%. Within the three sectors, the heating and cooling is expected to decrease 
about 5% while the electricity and the transport sector are expected to present an increase of 
about 8% and 4% respectively.  

 
The deployment of the renewable energy sector within the final energy consumption is on 

track to reach the 20% of renewables by 2020. From the collection of the data from all 
Member S tates, the EU is expected to reach a level of 22% of renewable energies in its final 
energy consumption by 2020, presenting an expected renewable energy consumption of about 

247Mtoe. The heating and cooling and the electricity sector are the largest contributors for this 
increase, about 86%, while the transport sector contributes with a lower amount of renewable 

energy, 14%. 
 
 

 
Figure 155 – [NREAP] EU’s rene wable energ y share by sector.  

 

 
On a sectoral basis, it is expected that by 2020 the electricity will come as 36% from 
renewable energy sources, followed by the heating and cooling sector wit h about 21% and the 

transport sector with about 11% (under the RED methodology). Here, the transport sector is on 
track to meet its 10% renewable energy objective underlined on the European C limate C hange 

Package.

Renewable energy 
 

1. European Union 

 
The focus of the EU on the energy policy was well understood from the Member States 
community, which showed and committed itself to strongly help the EU in its objectives. The 

collection of the renewable energy data from all Member States showed a large increase on the 
renewable energy consumption for the years up to 2020 in all three main sectors.  

 

 
Figure 156 – [NREAP] EU’s rene wable energ y e volution by sector .  

 
The consumption of renewable energy within the EU is expected to increase about 155% 

above 2005 levels, reaching a level of 247Mtoe. The negligent usage of renewable energy 
sources in 2005 allows to the transport sector to present the highest growth of 763% within the 

same period. The heating and cooling and electricity sectors are expected to increase its 
renewable energy consumption by about 110 and 150% respectively.  

 

 
2. Country overview 

 
On a country basis, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United K ingdom are expected to 
contribute with about 58% of all renewable energy consumption in the EU by 2020. Countries 

such as Austria, Finland and Sweden also expect to have a large importance on EU?s 
renewable energy consumption, accounting with about 16%.

As resumed on Table 67 of Annexes, all member states predicted to reach their national final 

energy objectives by the year of 2020 underlined on the renewable energy directive 
(2009/28/EC), with some countries expecting to exceed.  

Countries as Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain and Sweden expected to exceed their final 
renewable energy objectives on more than 1%, as showed in Figure 158.

Focus to Sweden as committed to achieve a 50% final renewable energy objective by 2020 

which is the largest within the EU. Countries such as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Latvia and 
Portugal present also higher objectives as they committed themselves to achieve more than 

30%, overtaking the EU?s average (calculated 22%).  
In the opposite way, countries such as Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and 
Malta are the countries where the final renewable energy share is expec ted to be the lowest, 

not reaching the 15%.  
 

 

10.2. Electricity 
 

Table 10 of the NREAP?s template requires all member states to provide detailed information 
on the evolution of their renewable electricity market. Expected renewable electricity 

consumption should be characterized on a year-by-year basis, for the technologies of hydro, 
geothermal, solar, tide wave and ocean, wind and biomass, up to 2020.  
Gathering all the information provided in each national report, it was possible to build the 

expected final electricity picture for the years up to 2020.  
 

It is expected that by 2020 the final electricity consumption will be as 8% above 2005 levels, 
reaching the level of 289 Mtoe. Renewables are expected to reach the level of 105Mtoe, which 
means an increase on the share of renewable energy sources on electricity from 16% by 2005 

to 36% by 2020.

Renewable electricity 
 

1. European Union 

 

Globally, the renewable electricity consumpt ion within the EU is expected to growth about 
150% between the years of 2005 and 2020, from a level of 41.910ktoe to 104.778ktoe. Wind 

energy is expected to be the largest contributor for this increase, from a level of 6.050ktoe in 
2005 to 42.525ktoe in 2020. Hydro is expected to be the second largest contributor for the 

total renewable electricity consumption up to 2020.  
 
 

 
Figure 160 – [NREAP] EU’s rene wable electricity consumpti on by technology.  

 
 
The renewable electricity consumption from hydro power is expected to remain stable within 

the EU, showing a growth of about 9% between 2005 and 2020. It is expected that wind power 
will pass hydro power on the main renewable electricity type, overtaking the value of 31Mtoe 

by 2017. It is expected that hydro power will keep its important contribution of representing 
30% of EU?s renewable electricity, while wind power will reach the level of 41% by 2020. 
Focus also to the biomass contribution of about 19% to the total EU?s renewable elect ricity. 

Despite the record growth of solar renewable electricity consumption (7.000% between 2005 
and 2020), its contribution to the total renewable electricity will remain low, about 8%. Tide, 
wave and ocean power will remain marginal.

2. Country overview 

 
Varying according to the region, Government direction or national economy, the renewable 

electricity technology mix varies from country to country and does not follow the same profile 
as the EU. The following chart provides an European overview of the renewable electricity 
profiles for each Member State. 

 

 
Figure 161 – [NREAP] Re ne wable electricity mix by c ountr y.  

 
 

Countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden rely on 
more than 50% on hyd ro power for their renewable electricity consumption, while on other 
side, wind power is expected to be responsible for about 50% of the renewable electricity 

consumption on countries such as Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Malta, The 
Netherlands and the United K ingdom.  

In other hand, countries such as Belgium, the C zech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg and Poland expect to largely rely on Biomass to address its renewable electricity 
objectives, about more than 40%.  

 
Similarly to the final energy consumption, also France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United 

Kingdom are expected to be responsible for about 61% of the renewable electricity 
consumption at the EU level.

10.3. Transport 
 
Under the European C limate C hange Package each Member State should achieve a mandatory 

objective of 10% renewable energy in the transport sector. According to the methodology 
described on the renewable energy directive (2009/28/EC), the 10% is calculated with all 
renewable energies used in the transport sector, divided by all petrol, diesel and electricity 

used in road and rail (including biofuels). CNG, LPG are excluded from the denominator, but 
biogas is included in the numerator (considered as biofuel).  

 
The renewable energy directive required the adoption of a methodology to calculate the 
energy share of renewable energies in transport. It says that biofuels in accordance with the 

Article 21(2) (made from industrial or municipal wastes) will count twice towards the 
objective while renewable electricity used in road transport will count 2.5 times.  

 
On the NREAPs, each Member State published the roadmap that they want to put in place in 
their national territory to reach their objectives. Each Member State filled up the table 1 with 

Road+Rail transport energy consumption, and an additional row if aviation exceeds 6.18% of 
the final energy consumption; Table 12 should mention the bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable 

hydrogen, renewable electricity in road and non-road, and also others (such as biogas and 
vegetable oils) energy expected consumption.  
 

 

 
Figure 164 – [NREAP] EU’s r ail+road energy consumpti on.  

 
 

It is expected that by 2020 the Road and Rail transport energy will present an increase of 5% 
above 2005 levels, where renewable energy is already included, reaching a level of about 

312Mtoe by 2020. This value includes all forms of energy consumed in rail and road transport, 
such as electricity and diesel used in rail, gasoline, diesel and biofuels used on road transport.

Renewable energy for transport 
 
As a conglomeration of all results and without taking into account the renewable energy 

factors described by the renewable energy directive (RED) methodology, biodiesel is expected 
to be the largest renewable energy consumed in transport, accounting about 66% of all 
renewable energies, fo llowed by bioethanol which is expected to represent about 22%. 

Renewable electricity in transport is expected to have a smaller contribution, about 9%, while 
„Others? is expected to be marginal 2%.  

 
  

 
Figure 165 – [NREAP] EU’s rene wable energ y consumpti on in tr ans port.  

 

 
In 2005 the consumption of renewable energies in transport almost entirely relied on the 

renewable electricity consumed in the rail sector, with also a considerable amount of biodiesel 
on road sector. In 2005, the renewable energies in road+rail reached the level of about 4Mtoe, 
where about 2Mtoe were in forms of biodiesel.  

 
By 2020, the agglomerated data provided by the NREAPs predict a large expansion on the 

usage of renewable energies in transport, when compared to 2005 levels (+685%). Renewable 
energies in forms of bioethanol and biodiesel are expected to be the most used sources.  
Bioethanol is expected to suffer the largest growth, about 1.300% but only representing about 

22% of all renewable energies in transport, while biodiesel is expected to be the largest 
contributor for the renewable energies transport sector representing about 66%. The 
deployment of renewable electricity in the road sector is expected to start from a negligent 

level on 2005 (~1ktoe), to about 667ktoe.

The share of renewable energies in transport will be of about 11,4% calculated in accordance 

to the renewable energy directive methodology. The following equation shows the formula to 
calculate the RED share:

After realizing the calculation with all the agglomerated data provided on all the 27 NREAPs, 

it was possible to represent the annual evolution on the renewable energy share on transport, 

by energy type. The following chart provides the year-by-year: 

 
 

 
Figure 166 – [NREAP] Evoluti on of RES -T share in Tr ans port.  

 
 
Bioethanol and biodiesel are expected to be crucial in helping the EU to meet its 10% 

renewable energy objective, representing a global energy share of 2,4 and 7,4%, respectiv ely. 
Biofuels under the article21 of the renewable energy directive are expected to contribute with 

1,6% to the total transport energy demand while renewable electricity on road is expected to 
contribute with about 0,5%.  
It is also possible to see that for the period between 2014 and 2020, the annual growth rate 

starts to quickly increase.

Country overview 
 
As detailed described on the Table 67 of Annexes, almost all of the member states expect to 

reach the transport objective of having at least 10% of renewable energies in transport. 
Bulgaria, C yprus and Estonia clearly mentioned their non-expectation of meeting the 10% 
objective. Countries such as Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden expect to exceed the 10% 

objective, with high focus of Finland which expects an objective of 20% of renewable in 
transport. 

 

 
Figure 167 – [NREAP] Re ne wable transport objecti ves by me mber state.  

 

 
The European Commission did not put in place any individual roadmap to advise each 

Member State on how to address their national 10% renewable energy transport objective, 
giving freedom to each Member State to decide the renewable energy mix that they want to 
put in place in their national markets.  

Once it was collected all member states individual data, it was possible to characterize the 
individual transport mix. The following chart provides the obtained results:

Generally, most of the member states do expect a large penetration of biodiesel in their 

transport markets, both in forms of first or second generation biodiesel. In opposition, 
countries such as Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Sweden and the United K ingdom expect 

also a large introduction of bioethanol, in both forms.  
Focus for example for Austria and Sweden as they expect to rely significantly on renewable 
electricity to reach its national objective, both in road and non-road transport.  

 
Note: This exercise was realized in accordance to the methodology described on the 

renewable energy directive however, some of the calculated energy objectives (%) do not 
match with the published objectives on each national action plan. Some incoherencies on the 
calculations were found when compared to the published national reports but, for purposes of 

this dissertation, those differences are not explained neither analyzed.  
 

As an example, Malta provided an energy consumption of renewable electricity on non-road 
transport which is about 30% of the total transport consumption, largely influencing the final 
transport renewable energy objective. The previous figure is therefore not the correct one for 

those countries. Also, Romania did not provide any details on renewable energy consumption 
in transport once Table 12 of the report was empty.  

 
In order to provide an example vision of the different approaches from each member state to 
the transport renewable energy question, five countries were selected as representative of five 

different approaches: 
 

 

 
Figure 169 – [NREAP] Different rene wable  energy appr oac hes for trans por t.  

 
 

Here are presented five countries where the renewable energy approach for transport was 
different. On the Austrian side, it is expected that about 39% of the renewable energy 



Annexes 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  229 

 

consumption in transport will come from renewable electricity, in a distribution of 18% for 

road and 21% for non-road transport. For example for bioethanol, Greece is the country which 
largely rely on bioethanol, about 65% of its re newable energy for transport, while Denmark 

can be example on the usage of second generation bioethanol, which represents about 33% of 
its renewable energy for transport. On the biodiesel side, Germany can be example of a large 
usage and importance of biod iesel, about 70% of its renewable energies for transport. O n the 

others case, Sweden is the country where it has a larger importance, about 19%, driven by an 
increase on the biogas segment.  

 
 

Potential biofuel blends 
 
One of the objectives of this dissertation and in particular of this chapter is to identify potential 

biofuels blends that might come in the future years at the EU community and member state 
level. For purposes of this dissertation, the biofuel volume blending was calculated according 
to the following equation: 

 
 

biofuelfossilfuel

biofuel

VolumeVolume

Volume
 Eq. 140 

 
 
The equation allows calculating the percentage in volume of a biofuel in a blend with the 

correspondent fossil fuel.  
 

The need to find the values for the volume of gasoline and diesel expected by each member 
state, lead to the construction of a past history on gasoline and diesel consumption for each 
member state and project a likely future gasoline and diesel consumptions for 2020 based on 

the data provided by each N REAPs.  
 

As described before, each NREAP provides energy data quantities for the agglomerate energy 
category of Rail+Road transport. Here, in order to find the details of Road transport, the 
energy data of Rail+Road data need to be first separated in Rail and Road, then using the 

“Road” separated into the gasoline, diesel and biofuels: 
 

1. Separate rail from road 
2. Separate road by ene rgy type

Methodology for separating Rail and Road 

 

In order to construct independe nt values for Rail and Road energy consumption, it was 
decided to first use the renewable electricity for non-road transport information provided on 

Table 12, divide it by the renewable electricity share announced by the member state, and 
calculate a final value of electricity consumed by the rail transport:

Then, through the consultation of the Ex-Tremis model, it was possible to characterize the rail 
energy sector for each member state, namely the share of diesel and electricity on each 

national rail market. With the share of electricity in the rail sector for each member state, it 
was possible to calculate a potential total rail energy consumption.

After calculating the total rail energy consumption, it was used the Rail+Road energy coming 

from each 27 member state N REAP, and calculate a dedicated value for Road energy 
consumption for each member state.

Having the total road energy consumption, it wa s required to split into its most used fossil 

energy carriers (gasoline, diesel, LPG, CNG and biofuels).  
In order to have a representative value for the fossil road energy, it was first subtracted the 
contribution of the biofuels for the road energy consumption: 

 
 

energyroadfossilbiofuelsnconsumptioenergyRoad ....  Eq. 144 

 
 
With this equation, it was calculated the value for fossil road energy that is undertaken in each 

27 Member States. 
Having this value, it was necessary to separate the fossil road energy into gasoline, diesel, 

LPG and CNG. Here, it should be mentioned that it was not made any differentiation between 
LPG and CNG both due its lower relevance to the total road energy and considering that will 
not bring additional information on calculating potential biofuels blends.  

 
From the consultation of the Eurostat, it was possible to build a past history on gasoline and 

diesel energy consumption, allowing the creation of a share of gasoline and diesel in road.  
Here is the example for Austria: 
 

 

 
Figure 171 – [NREAP] Austrian e xample for g asoline and diesel history [11]. 

 
 
From the example, it is possible to visualize the evolution for the considered past period 2005-

2008 for both gasoline and diesel consumption.  
With these values, it was possible to calculate a past tendency on the share of both gasoline 

and diesel in road. Here is the Austrian example: 
 
 



Annexes 

232 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

 
Figure 172 – [NREAP] Austrian e xample for g asoline and diesel road share.  

 
 

By watching past tendencies on those shares, it was considered that until 2020 no radical 
changes on the gasoline and diesel shares were expected. Therefore, it was assumed a decrease 

of about 2% on the gasoline share from 2008 until 2020, with an increase on diesel 2%. As an 
example, if on 2008 the gasoline share was of 35%, by 2020 it was assumed to be 33% and the 
same logic to the diesel case. Here is the Austrian example: 

 
 

 
Figure 173 – [NREAP] Austrian future projections of gasoline and diesel road shares.  

 
 
Having defined future gasoline and diesel shares, it was decided to apply those shares to the 

calculated fossil road energy. Here is an example for gasoline, which represents the same logic 
for diesel.

After having both road gasoline and diesel expected consumptions for each Member State, it 

was possible to build final tables for each member state and European level. Figure 176 and 
Figure 177 show the results for all Member States. 
 

 
Biofuel blend country results 

 
Having both fossil and biofuels values, it was decided to convert them into volume. This 
exercise was realized through the usage of several conversion factors.  

After realizing all the calculations, a fina l table with the calculated potential biofuels blends by 
2020 for each Member State was built.

As a conglomeration of all results, it was possible to see that all Member States had different 
approaches regarding biofuels blending. Countries such Austria and Latvia presents the lowest 

biofuels blends, in opposition for example to Finland, Germany and Hungary which present 
higher biofuels blends.  
As an average European calculation, it was calculated that by 2020 the average European 

Union blending would be 11% for bioethanol and 12% for biodiesel. In that case, only Finland 
and the Netherlands would be close to the bioethanol blend, while Bulgaria, Portugal and the 

United K ingdom would be in line with the average biodiesel blend.  
 
Countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United K ingdom are expected to 

drive the Europe?s average, accounting for more than 60% of gasoline and 65% of diesel

consumption. On the biofuels side, also they are leading the market accounting for 60% of 

bioethanol and 69% of biodiesel expected consumption.  
 

These figures do not expect the introduction and deployment of protection grade fuels, neither 
the introduction of mass fuels neither the usage of niche fue ls. These values would represent 
the average fuel blend that might be in place by 2020, taking into account all current fleet and 

not making any differentiation on compatibilities of engines, age of vehicles, etc.  
This is therefore the gross message coming from each member state NREAP.  

 
This was the result of a very simple calculation, and of course these figures rely on the 
assumptions behind all calculations, but even so the potential biofuels blending is there and 

those values were considered as highly representative for purposes of this dissertation.  
 

 

Potential market size for electric vehicles 
 

The renewable electricity that is published on Table 12 of each NREAPs is an indication of 
both the usage of electricity as transport?s energy carrier and the amplitude of the renewable 

electricity share expected in that Member State. 
 
For the calculation of the potential market size for electric vehicles, the total amount of 

electricity that is expected to be consumed in road transport was calculated, and then divided it 
by a likely annual electricity consumption from one single electric vehicle. In this way, it is 

possible to calculate a potentia l number of electric vehicles that will consume the calculated 
total amount of electricity. Here is the mindset:

1. Calculation of the total electricity for road transport 

 

The exercise was realized considering the renewable electricity for road transport published on 
Table 12 and the renewable electricity share expected by each member state for the year of 

2020. 
 
The following equation shows the calculation used for each Member State to calculate the 

expected electricity consumption on road transport:

2. Calculation of the annual electricity consumption for an electric vehicle 

 
It was assumed that an electric vehicle would consume about 0,15kWh/km and would have an 

average annual mileage of 7.500km/year. That would result on an annual consumption of 
1.125kWh/year.vehicle. These general values came from internal analysis of Toyota?s energy 
research group.  

 
 

3. Calculation of the total amount of electric vehicles 
 
Having both the total electricity expected to be consumed in road transport and the annual 

electricity consumption by one electric vehicle, finally the calculation of the potential number 
of electric vehicles is reached:

This figure would correspond to the total number of electric vehicles needed to be on road by 

2020, to consume the expected electricity published by the NREAPs. 
As results for each Member State, the following table summarizes the calculation of the 
number of electric vehicles for the countries which provided data for this calculation:

As an aggregate value for all Europe, an amount of around 20million electric vehicles would 

be needed to consume such a number of expected electricity for road transport. Focus on 
countries such as France, Italy and Spain which expect a large number of electric vehicles in 
their markets. 

It should be mentioned that the figures of renewable electricity for road transport provided by 
the NREAPs might include all forms of electric road transport such as electric vehicles, 

electric vans, electric buses, motorcycles, etc. However, for purposes of this dissertation and to 
have a potential market size for electric vehicles, it was considered as most representative the 
consumption from the electric vehicles segment and discard all the other consumptions from 

other electric-road transport modes. 
 

 

Transport policies 
 

Chapter 4.5 of each N REAP provides information on measures and policies forecasted by each 
Member State in order to meet the published renewable energy objectives. As a result from the 

collection of all the data, it was possible to conclude that all the measures could be divided in 
three main groups: fuel tax incentives, new vehicle purchase incentives, energy/GHG quotas 
for fuels. For example, it can be tax benefits for biofuels, price incentives for low-emissions 

vehicles purchase, quota for biofuels, greenhouse gas reduction, etc.  
 

Not all the 27 Member States were analyzed because at that time the English translation was 
not available. Therefore English translation was required for countries of special on this 
dissertation being only analyzed the countries of Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 

Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United 
Kingdom. 

Recently the European Commission published the English translation of t he NREAPs in its 
platform however, due the recent time of its publication, the remaining countries were not 
analyzed on this dissertation. As a note, it was concluded that the analyzed countries could be 

considered as valuable and representative informatio n for all European Union and might be

that the analysis of the remaining countries would not bring additional information on the 

expected measures.  
 

 

Country overview 
 

Austria [56] 

 

In Austria, the “NoVA programme” is one payable tax which is due on initial registration of 
private motor vehicles. Its subject is being revised in order to promote the uptake of low 
emissions vehicles such as electric vehicles, hybrid, natural gas cars. Under this mechanism, a 

new variant was created, the “NoVA greening”, which objective is to give a bonus purchase 
price to low emission vehicles (&lt;120gCO2/km), electric vehicles as well as E85 vehicles.  

Other mechanism is the “MotV programme”. The MotV regulates the insurance tax for 
automotive vehicles and is currently being revised to change from engine power to carbon 
emissions indexation. This means that low emission vehicles will receive an insurance bonus 

on their annual taxes.  
Under a major Austrian mechanism, the “K lima”, there is the “K lima aktiv mobil” which 

objective is to help the conversion of installed infrastructure or automotive fleets into more 
sustainable and low carbon ones. This range from the conversion of current engines into 
biofuel capable (e.g. E85, biogas or vegetable oils), the promotion and marketing of 

sustainable transport modes in urban areas or, for example, the promotion and integration of 
public transport systems with other modes such as bicycling, etc.  

In Austria, there is also the UFI, “Environmental Assistance in Austria”, which is another 
mechanism to promote the uptake of renewable and low carbon technologies. Under this 
mechanism, there is the support for the construction and modification of filling gas stations 

into alternative fuels capable such as E85, b iogas or vegetable oils.  
According to Austrian NREAP, it is expected that by 2013, bioethanol 10% (E10) will be 

introduced on the market as well as biodiesel 10% (B10) by 2017, both depending on the 
availability of the European fuel standards.  
 

 
Denmark [57] 

 
Under the “Denmark 2020” strategy, focus to the tax exemption for electric vehicles which 
was extended until 2015. Here, the Danish Government is on the way to prepare a research 

and demonstration program for electric vehicles and second generation biofuels ca lled “the 
Centre for Greener Transport”, supervised by the Transport Ministry.  

After 2017, it is expected that the taxation from car ownership will be indexed to car usage. 
This is expected to make more attractive the energy efficiency vehicles.  
Under the “Energy Technology Programme”, there was available about DKK200M for 

research and demonstration on second generation biofuels from 2007 to 2010. Recently, this 
programme was extended after 2010 and until 2013, with new projects such as electric 



Annexes 

 

Milton Grácio Catarino  239 

 

vehicles being included on the programme. This new programme is called “A green transport 

policy”. 
 

 
Finland [58] 

 

Finish national renewable energy action plan was very poor on transport policies and did not 
include the chapter 4.5. 

 
 
France [54] 

 

Since 2007 that France had in place scrap incentives for the renewal of older cars by more 

efficient ones. These scrap incentives were realized under the condition that a vehicle with 
more than a certain age would be valued in €1.000 or €700 in case of exchanging for a new car. 
By the end of 2011, this scrap incentive is due to exit. 

Currently, and since 2009, bioethanol in a mixture of 10% (E10) is already available at the 
pump stations. By 2017, it is expected that lingo-cellulosic biofuels will come into market, 

despite their lower quantities. This means that still first generation biofuels are expected to 
remain the largest contributors on the period after 2017.  
By 2011, a new eco-tax is expected to be introduced to reduce transport?s carbon intensity. 

This tax is due to promote the usage of non-road and non-aviation transport modes into rail 
ones. This measure is linked with the new expected urban planning for French urban areas. It 

is expected to invest up to 2020 in the building of new rail lines as well as automatic drive 
metros in the region of Ille-de-France, Paris. 
As additional information, France expects to have in road by 2020 about 2M electric vehicles.  

 
 

Germany [55] 

 
Germany has in place quotas for biofuel incorporation into fossil fuels from the year of 2007 

up to 2020. Those quotas are calculated on an energy basis up to 2014 and between 2014 and 
2020 on greenhouse gas reduction. For example in 2010 is expected that bioethanol will be 

blended in 2,8% on energy content in gasoline and 4,4% biodiesel in diesel, while after 2014 
the quota moves from energy based to greenhouse gas reduction. As an example, by 2020 is 
expected that the transport fuels used in transport should reduce the greenhouse gas emissions 

by 7% when compared to the fossil fuel.  
In relation to the biofuel taxes, since 2001 and up to 2015 Germany is giving tax benefits for 

the usage of second generation biofuels, biogas and alternative fuels such as higher blends of 
ethanol (E85).  
Since August 2009 is in place the “German Elektromobility Plan” promoting the uptake of 

electric vehicles. Under this plan, Germany expects to have about 1M electric vehicles on road 
by 2020.

Greece [59] 

 
Since 2009, the four Greek refineries are allowed to incorporate a maximum biodiesel volume 

blending of 7%, which standard was approved by the State C hemical Council (SCC).  
Under the strategies for promoting low emission vehicles, hybrid, electric and other types of 
low-emission vehicles are exempted from the fuel consumption tax, the additional special tax, 

the circulation tax and the registration tax. Also, there is in place a differentiation on the 
incentives according to the engine technology. For example, there is exclusion of hybrid cars 

from the traffic restrictio ns in the city of Athens.  
Aiming the definition and better understanding of future transport technologies, there is now 
in place a programme to define the technical specifications of energy efficient vehicles, clean 

vehicles, public procurement based on fuel economy labelling, trainings on eco-driving, etc. 
 

 
Ireland [60] 

 

Ireland did not provide much information on the transport measures up to 2020. In spite of the 
Government target of 10% electric vehicles by 2020, it started this year (2011) and is up 2012 

an electric vehicle registration scheme to incentive the purchase of electric drive vehicles. This 
also includes plug- in hybrid vehicles which also receive an additional exemption on the 
registration tax. 

 
 

Italy [61] 

 
Under a benefited contingent of €3,8M and €0,1M, the use of bioethanol can receive a special 

rate for the years of 2010 and 2011, however it is not mentioned which are the conditions for 
those special rate.  

The usage of higher biodiesel b lends such as B25 is currently being revised and measures are 
being studied for usage only on captive fleets.  
The mechanism for the promotion of biomethane as transport energy motion is being extended 

for further years, while its introduction on the natura l gas mix is currently being supported by 
the Italian Government.  

 
 
The Netherlands [62] 

 
Similarly to the Austrian, the Dutch Government started in 2008 a mechanism to support the 

construction of new alternative filling stations. The mechanism called „TAB? provides 
incentives ranging according to the alternative fuel: for natural gas (€60.000 to €80.000), E85 
(€20.000 to €28.000) or B30 (€13.000 to €19.000). Also the conversion of older filling 

stations into newer ones such as E85 or B30, receive incentives from €7.500 to €10.000.  
Regarding alternative fuels, focus for the promotion of E85 as vehicle fuel, which is taxed on 

an energy content basis and it taxed in such way that its price is always lower when compared 
to conventional gasoline.

Since 2009, the support scheme for electric mobility is not yet clear and defined. Recently, the 

Ministry of Transport and Waterways and Economic Affairs produced the “Plan of Approach 
of Electric Driving”. O ne of the main objectives of this program is to transform the 

Netherlands into the most international test area for electric driving between 2009 and 2011.  
 
 

Poland [63] 

 

Between the years of 2010 and 2011 it is expected the introduction of new measures and 
incentives for the promotion of biofuels. Most of the incentives will be related to fuel taxation 
in function of the level of blending.  

There is also the objective to introduce restricted areas for public transport which should run 
on alternative fuels. The programme called “Multi- Year Programme” requires the replacement 

of conventional diesel engines by LPG, CNG, electric or hybrid. Under the same programme, 
Government entities, public bodies and local authorities should adapt and replace their fleets 
to the usage of alternative energies.  

Currently it is possible the usage of several dedicated blends such as E85, B20 or B100 but 
only for captive fleets. It is objective to introduce in the future the blends of E10 and B10 and 

make it accessible to the entire market.  
By 2020 it is objective to start a nd develop the production of second generation bioethanol and 
biodiesel, and also the deployment of biohydrogen for the years between 2020 and 2025.  

 
 

Portugal [64] 

 
The Mobi.E is the programme that manages the electric mobility in Portugal. It aims to 

transfer passengers into electricity for its energy carrier. By 2020, it is objective that about 
10% of road transport energy is electricity. Incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles are 

ranging from €5.000 or €6.500 if with the scrap of old conventio nal cars (&gt;8years).  
By 2011, it is objective to conduct and develop a pilot-project within 25 cities equipped in 
total with 1.300 slow charging and 50 fast charging points. The project aims to develop and 

create know-how on the management of electric vehic les and its energy consumption profile. 
Under the same project, there is the objective of implementing a pilot project of a smart city in 

Évora, where it is expected to be possible to study the integrated management of the 
decentralized energy production, the intelligent charging systems for electric vehicles and the 
consumption management using smart meters.  

 
 

Spain [65] 

 
Between the years of 2010 and 2020, is expected the large deployment of electric vehicles, 

aiming a 10% of the car fleet on electric vehicles.  
It is expected the introduction and deployment of an “eco- labelling” system. This system is 

due to compare the carbon efficiency of different car categories in order to promote the uptake 
of low carbon vehicles.  



Annexes 

242 Milton Grácio Catarino  

 

Under the biofuels strategies, it is expected the introduction and generalization of E85 and 

B30 as fuel for captive fleets and their introduction into the Spanish fuels directive.  
There is also the objective of changing the current biofuel legislation to allow the usage of 

biogas as transport fuel, in similar conditions as bioethanol and biodiesel.  
It is also expected to adapt before 2013 the public authority fleet into capable of running in 
higher biofuel blends such as E85 and B30. This should reach a level of 50% adaptation of the 

public administration fleet. 
By 2013, it is expected to generalize the usage of E10 and B10 as mass market fuel, with the 

possible disappear of the gasoline protection grade.  
In what refers to the biodiesel under the article 21, the Spanish analysis showed the 
hypodissertation that in the end of the period 2011-2020, there is the possibility to reach a 

share of utilization of around 2/3 of vegetable oils.  
According to the Spanish NREAP, between the “other” biofuels, those which have more 

possibility to play an autonomy role are the biogas for transport, the HVO (hydrotreated 
vegetable oils) and the Bio-SPK (Bio-derived synthetic paraffinic kerosenes)  for aviation. 
Under this category, there is also a national programme to support the technical development 

in the sector of second generation biofuels as well as biorefineries.  
 

 
Sweden [66] 

 

Since 2005 there was in place an incentive for the purchase of low emission vehicles for 
public authorities.  

The government is currently revising and soon will be introduced the legislatio n to allow the 
incorporation of 10% bioethanol into gasoline and 6% biodiesel (FAME) into diesel.  
Currently there is support for the introduction of biogas cars and for the extension of the 

infrastructure for the distribution of biogas as vehicle fuel. On August 2010, the Swedish 
government together with the Energy Authority developed an inter-sectoral long term strategy 

to contribute for the increase use of biogas as vehicle fuel.  
Several financial measures and legislations are already in place to support fuel and vehicles. 
As an example, there are incentives for the establishment of pumps for usage of renewable 

fuels, vehicle tax (private and company cars), road traffic tax law, environmental cars for state 
purchase, parking benefits for low emissions vehicles, congestion taxes, investment support 

for biogas. Here, after 2011, the vehicle taxes for car will start to be carbon indexed.  
Sweden is also promoting the energy research on renewable technologies. For example, there 
is a budget allocated to researc h on large scale renewable electricity production, its integration 

in the electricity network, electric drive and hybrid vehicles, and biofuels. Also, budget is 
expected to be allocated to the demonstration and commercialization of new technologies such 

as the second generation biofuels, solar cells and biogas.  
It is expected that by 2030, Sweden has an automotive fleet which is independent of fossil 
fuels and presents zero net greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

The case of United K ingdom was one example of the non presentation of specific measures 

applied to the transport system, biofuels or electric vehicles.  
 
 

Annual overview 
 

After having a general overview of the main transport policies across the analyzed member 
states, it was decided to create a picture of the incidence of the number of measures along the 
time. The following chart provides an overview of the number of announced measures 

according to the time scale, in units.  
 

 
Figure 175 – [NREAP] Annual e vol ution of the number of measures. 

 
 
It is possible to see that the agglomerate data for the analyzed countries shows a great 

incidence of measures for the period between 2008 and 2013, and a lack on the definition of 
their policies and measures for the years after 2014/2015.  

However there is no information on this, but might be that the lack of information for the years 
after 2014 is linked with the intermediate evaluation of the NREAPs progress that is required 
to be realized by 2014 by each Member State. By 2014 it is expected that all Member States 

should report into the European Commission the deployment and progress status of their 
published National Renewable Energy Action Plans, comparing that was announced in June 

2010 to the actual situation by 2014.  It should be reported the level of the compliance with the 
announced strategy in 2010 and the need to reform or update their national strategy in order to 
meet their announced 2020 objectives.  

 
Having this lack of transport information for the period between 2014 and 2020, the 

development of future scenarios for the transport sector appears as a crucial tool in supporting

that the Member States are on track to reach the announced national objectives.
