RESUMO 

A ocorrência de vírus entéricos no ambiente (água, solo) e em 

alimentos é bem documentada e tem sido associada a diversos surtos de 

gastroenterite de origem não bacteriana.  Diversos patógenos virais 

foram identificados nestes surtos, incluindo norovírus (NV), vírus das 

hepatites A e E (HAV e HEV, respectivamente), astrovírus (AstV), 

poliovírus (PV), poliomavírus (PyV), adenovírus (AdV) e rotavírus 

(RV). Padrões de qualidade da água, tanto para consumo quanto para 
recreação, ainda se referem aos coliformes totais e termotolerantes e 

esse fato tem sido cada vez mais questionado pela comunidade científica 

e autoridades sanitárias no mundo todo.  

Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o nível de contaminação por 

vírus em amostras de água e sedimento coletadas em duas regiões da 

ilha de Florianópolis em Santa Catarina, sul do Brasil: Rio Sangradouro 

(amostras de água de superfície e sedimento) e Lagoa do Peri (água de 

superfície, distintas profundidades de coluna de água- 0.9, 5.5 e 8.0 

metros e sedimentos). Os vírus avaliados foram: adenovírus humano 

(HAdV), vírus da hepatite A (HAV), rotavírus grupo A (RVA), e 

colifagos somáticos. Para mimetizar a influência da radiação solar na 

estabilidade dos vírus montou-se um microcosmo em condições naturais 

de claro/escuro (dia e noite) e totalmente no escuro ambos em escala 

laboratorial e utilizamos  AdV recombinante (rAdV) e norovirus murino 

(MNV-1) como modelos de vírus de genoma DNA e RNA (Capítulo III 

da tese). Os ensaios envolveram técnicas moleculares de PCR em tempo 

real (HAdV, HAV, RVA) para quantificação de genomas e técnicas de 

infecção  celular in vitro (HAdV, rHAdV e MNV-1), além de técnicas 

microbiológicas clássicas (colifagos) para estudos de infecciosidade 

viral . Capítulo I: No ano de 2013 foram coletadas e analisadas um total 

de 96 amostras de água e sedimento. Para as amostras de água, HAdV 

foi detectado em 70,8% das amostras de verão, sendo que 82,4% dessas 

continham vírus infecciosos; a frequência do HAdV no inverno foi de 

62,5% e nenhum deles continham vírus infecciosos. Para as amostras de 

sedimento, a frequência de HAdV foi de 37,5% nas amostras de verão, 

com 66,7% desses contendo HAdV infeccioso; a frequência HAdV no 

inverno foi de 37,5%, e nenhuma amostra continha vírus infecciosos. 

RVA foram detectados em 20,8 e 45,8% das amostras de águas 

superficiais coletadas no verão e inverno, respectivamente, e em 8,3 e 

12,5% das amostras de sedimentos coletados no verão e inverno, 

respectivamente. Genomas de HAV foram detectados apenas em águas 

de superfície, com 54,8 e 12,5% de positividade em amostras de verão e 

inverno, respectivamente. Capítulo II: No ano de 2014 foi avaliada a 



distribuição espacial de vírus em diferentes profundidades da coluna de 

água bem como sedimento. Um total de 84 amostras de água e 48 

amostras de sedimentos foi analisado. Foi observado que, 64% e 48% 

das amostras de água e sedimento foram positivas para HAdV, 

respectivamente, sendo que 76% e 83% dos amostras respectivamente, 

continham vírus infecciosos. RVA estava presente em 33% e 18,75% 

das amostras de água e sedimento respectivamente e 25% das amostras 

de água foram positivas para HAV. Colifagos somáticos puderam ser 

detectados em 42% e 18,75% das amostras de água e sedimento, 

respectivamente. Os dados apontaram para uma variação de prevalência 

vírus de acordo com as diferentes profundidades da coluna de água. 

Capítulo III: As taxas de decaimento (K) e T90 para rHAdV e MNV-1 

na água e sedimentos foram calculadas usando um microcosmo em 

escala de laboratório. Foram calculadas as unidades infecciosas de 

rHAdV e MNV-1 por microscopia de fluorescência e ensaio de placa de 

lise, respectivamente ao longo de um período de 85 dias. O curso do 

decaimento natural de rHAdV e MNV-1 foi similar sob luz solar natural 

nos microcosmos  onde o T90 para rHAdV foi de 7,7 e 7 dias em água e 

sedimentos, respectivamente. O T90 para MNV-1 foi de 6,7 e 6,4 dias na 

água e sedimento, respectivamente. Nos microcosmos mantidos 

completamente no escuro observou-se uma estabilidade maior tanto para 

o rHAdV em água (T90 = 20,9 dias), quanto em sedimentos (T90 = 22 

dias) sendo que para MNV-1 a estabilidade foi T90 = 12 dias e T90 = 18 

dias em água e em sedimento, respectivamente. Estes resultados 

demonstraram a presença dos vírus entéricos potenciais causadores de 

doenças no principal manancial de água doce da Ilha de Santa Catarina e 

no Rio que corta muitos bairros dessa região e desemboca na Praia do 

Matadeiro, muito frequentada por banhistas e surfistas durante todo o 

ano e também a adsorção e estabilidade dos vírus aos sedimentos que 

são ressuspendidos pela ação dos ventos e chuvas, voltando às colunas 

de água. Esperemos que, no futuro, essas áreas sejam mais protegidas 

pelas autoridades e que a população se conscientize de seu papel na 

proteção dos recursos hídricos, fundamentais à manutenção da vida no 

planeta terra.

ABSTRACT 

 

The presence of enteric viruses in the environment (water, soil) and in 

foods is well documented and has been associated with several 

gastroenteritis outbreaks of non-bacterial origin. Several viral pathogens 

were identified in these outbreaks, including Norovirus (NV), hepatitis 

A and E viruses (HAV and HEV respectively), astrovirus (AstV), 

poliovirus (PV), polyomavirus (PyV), adenovirus (AdV) and rotavirus 

(RV). Water quality standards, both for consumption and for recreation, 

still refer to the total and fecal coliforms and this fact has been 

increasingly questioned by the scientific community and health 

authorities worldwide.  

This study aimed to assess the level of viral contamination in water and 

sediment samples collected from two regions: Rio Sangradouro (surface 

water and sediment samples) and Peri Lagoon, representing the main 

freshwater reservoir of the island of Florianopolis in Santa Catarina, 

southern Brazil, (surface water, different depths of water-column: 0.9, 

5.5 and 8.0 meters and sediment). Evaluated virus were: human 

adenovirus (HAdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), rotavirus group A (RVA), 

and somatic coliphages (Chapters I and II of this thesis). To mimic the 

influence of solar radiation on the stability of the virus it was set up a 

microcosm in natural conditions of light/dark (day and night) and totally 

in the dark both at laboratory scale and used recombinant AdV (rAdV) 

and murine norovirus (MNV -1) as models for DNA and RNA genome 

viruses (Chapter III of this thesis). The assays involved molecular PCR 

techniques in real time (HAdV, HAV, RVA) for quantification of 

genomes and cell culture techniques in vitro (HAdV, rHAdV and MNV-
1) in addition to classical microbiological techniques (coliphages) for 

studies of viral infectivity. Chapter I: We collected a total of 96 

samples of water and sediment during the summer and winter of 2013. 

For water samples, HAdV was detected in 70.8% of the summer 

samples, 82.4% of those with infectious virus; the incidence of HAdV in 

winter was 62.5% and none were infectious. For sediment samples, the 

incidence of HAdV was 37.5% in the summer samples, with 66.7% 

containing infectious HAdV; the incidence HAdV in winter was 37.5% 

and none were infectious. Genomes of RVA were detected in 20.8 and 

45.8% of surface water samples collected in summer and winter, 

respectively, and 8.3 and 12.5% of the samples of sediment collected in 

summer and winter, respectively. Genomes of HAV were detected only 

in surface waters, with 54.8 and 12.5% positivity in summer and winter 

samples, respectively. Chapter II: The spatial distribution of the 



evaluated viruses in different depths of the water column was evaluated. 

A total of 84 samples of water and 48 samples of sediment were 

analyzed. After analysis, 64% and 48% of water and sediment samples 

were positive for HAdV, respectively 76% and 83% respectively 

infectious. RVA was present in 33% and 18.75% of the samples of 

water and sediment respectively and 25% of water samples were 

positive for HAV. Somatic coliphages could be detected in 42% and 

18.75% of water and sediment samples, respectively. The data indicated 

a variation in the virus prevalence according to the different depths of 

the water column. Chapter III: The decay rates (K) and T90 were 

calculated for rHAdV and MNV-1 in water and sediments using a 

microcosm in a laboratory scale. The infectivity was measured by 

infectious units of rHAdV and MNV-1 by fluorescence microscopy and 

plaque assay, respectively, over a period of 85 days. The course of 

natural decay of rHAdV and MNV-1 was similar under natural 

condition in microcosms where T90 to rAdV was 7.7 and 7 days in water 

and sediment, respectively. The T90 in NVM-1 was 6.7 and 6.4 days in 

the water and sediment respectively. In microcosms completely in the 

dark condition it was observed an increased stability for rHAdV in water 

(T90 = 20.9 days) and in sediment (T90 = 22 days) as well as for MNV-1 

with T90 = 12 days and T90 = 18 days in water and sediment 

respectively. These results demonstrate the real presence of enteric 

viruses which cause diseases, in the main fresh water source of the 

island of Santa Catarina and the Sangradouro River that crosses many 

districts of this region and flow into Matadeiro Beach, which is used by 

swimmers and surfers throughout the year. Also we realize the 

adsorption and stability of the viruses to the sediments that are 

subsequently resuspended by wind and rain, returning to the water 

columns. Hopefully, in the future, these areas will be more protected by 

the authorities and the population will be aware of its role in the 

protection of water resources, essential to the maintenance of life on 

planet earth.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

1. PRESENTATION 

This section will provide a brief literature review regarding the 

subject of this thesis. 

 

1.1 WATER QUALITY IN BRAZIL 
According to a report released on the occasion of the World Water 

Forum in Mexico, 2006, 57 million of the 6 billion people in the world 

lack safe drinking water. Brazil is one of the richest countries in the 

world in water resources, with about 13% of all fresh water in the 

planet. However today, the water distribution in Brazil meets more to 

agro-business interests than the people's needs. According to the 

Brazilian National Water Agency (AGÊNCIA NACIONAL DAS 

ÁGUAS-ANA) which is responsible for the National Water Resources 

Policy and creates the National System for Water Resources 

Management, the biggest water consumer in the country is the agro-

business (72%), which has targeted production to export soybeans, beef 

and pork. For example, only in 2013, agro-business spent 200 trillion 

liters of water, equivalent to 200 full container systems. This is followed 

by industries with 22% while the household represent only 6% of water 

consumption in the country (AGÊNCIA NACIONAL DAS ÁGUAS-

ANA, 2014) 

According to ANA Brazilian Federal Law 9.433, from January 8, 

1997, the term of water sources refers to surface water, underground 

water, flooding, or potentially usable waters for the public water supply, 

and the priority use is for human consumption and for animals drinking; 

Water resources management should always assure the multiple uses of 

water and the management of water resources should be decentralized 

and include the participation of public authorities, users and 

communities. 

However, the water sources have been challenged with 

anthropogenic influences, and the pollution can be caused both by 

natural sources and humans, mainly through discharge of human, animal 

and industrial wastes. As this contaminated water can be reused in the 

field of agriculture uses such as irrigation, this can lead to degradation 

of food, soil quality and also will affect the quality of ground water 

(TUCCI et al., 2001). The non-collected and the collected but non-

treated sewage are disposed in soils and water bodies, producing 

pollution. The sewage is the major cause of water pollution in Brazil. 



34 

For these reasons, sanitation and hygiene facilities are considered one of 

the most important concerns all over Brazil, to prevent or even reduce 

the risks of diseases related to release these contaminants into the 

aquatic environment (IBGE, 2008). Although, wastewater treatment 

processes are considered the most unsafe service in Brazil (IBGE, 

2010). 

According to the latest estimates of the WHO/UNICEF Joint 

Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), 32% of the 

world’s population – 2.4 billion people – lacked improved sanitation 

facilities, and 663 million people still use improper drinking water 

sources, in 2015 the vast majority living in India, China and Africa. As a 

result of inadequate access to safe water and sanitation services, 2.2 

million deaths annual (mostly children under the age of 5) occur because 

of sanitation-related diseases and poor hygienic conditions (WHO; 

UNICEF, 2009 &amp;amp; 2015).  

In Brazil, according to the National Survey of Improved Sanitation, 

known by the acronym PNSB there is a variable frequency survey 

according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 

Only 55.16% of the Brazilian municipalities have sewage collection 

network for services and, regarding Santa Catarina state, only 28.5% of 

the population have sewage treatment services (IBGE, 2008) as shown 

in Fig. 1.

Brazilian state and hydrographic basins. Brazil, 2000 (IBGE, 2008).

35 

Currently the city of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina state, regarding 

the collection and treatment of sewage system, covers a total of 44% of 

the resident population (PLANO MUNICIPAL INTEGRADO DE 

SANEAMENTO BÁSICO – PMISB, 2008). This means that 56% of the 

resident populations are exhibited to the risk of water related diseases 

because of the possible route of aquatic system contamination by 

sewage disposal. In 1997 a real system of Wastewater Treatment Plant 

(WWTP) located in the south of the island, established by CASAN-

Catarinense Company for Water and Sanitation (CASAN, 2011). 

CASAN is a mixed capital company, established in 1970 by the State 

Law No. 4547 and incorporated on July 2, 1971, whose mission is to 

provide clean water collection and treatment of sewage. The company is 

present in 201 municipalities of Santa Catarina. Currently the services 

provided by CASAN cover almost the entire state of Santa Catarina, 

disposing of three water treatment plant (WTP) system called North, 

South and East Coast, Integrated in Florianópolis (PMISB, 2008). 

CASAN serves a population of 2.5 million people with treated water 

supply and 319,000 with sewage collection. Surface and ground water 

are used by CASAN as sources for water, treatment and distribution to 

the population. The water treatment process consists of: clarification 

(coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration), final treatment 

(disinfection, fluoridation and pH correction), reservation and 

distribution. In relation to sewage treatment consist of storage in 

Stabilization Ponds, Activated Sludge (oxidation, aeration) and 

Biological filters (CASAN 2011). 

Quality and safety of water bodies in Brazil classified for human 

uses, according to Brazilian regulation, (THE NATIONAL 

ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL-CONAMA 2000) are evaluated according 

to bacteriological parameters which analyse only total and fecal 

coliforms (E. coli) as indicators for faecal contamination, which is 

required by Brazilian legislation (Portaria/MS 2.914/2011). However, 

there is no relationship between bacteria presence and other pathogens 

such as protozoa and virus detection because these last pathogens are 

more resistant to the most conventional treatment step either in water or 

wastewater treatment systems (FONG; LIPP, 2005). For these reasons, 

the Brazilian Association of Sanitary Engineering, known by the 

Portuguese-language acronym ABES (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA 

DE ENGENHARIA SANITÁRIA), suggested to include other 

microorganisms in the evaluation of water quality, including waterborne 

human viruses (ABES, 2010). 



36 

Contamination of coastal and estuarine waters by faecal pollution 

can lead to serious human health risks. According to the World Health 

Organization, about 1.8 million deaths from diarrhea occur each year; 

largely caused by unsafe water consumption (WHO, 2013). Coastal 

lagoons occupy around 13% of the coastal areas worldwide (KJERVE, 

1994). These ecosystems are considered social, ecological and 

economically important due to their intensive use by humans and 

animals as water resources, sanitation tools and areas for swimming and 

recreation (SPAULDING 1994). Unfortunately, Brazilian coastal 

lagoons are subjected to several types of anthropogenic uses and 

influences due to population pressure (HENNEMANN; PETRUCIO 

2011).  

The lack of adequate sanitation in these ecosystems in coastal areas 

is a problem since in Brazil, one third of the population inhabits these 

regions (MINISTÉRIO DO MEIO AMBIENTE-MMA, 2007). As 

coastal communities grow, sewage can become a threat to local 

waterways: demand often exceeds available sewage treatment, and 

much of the sewage is dumped without being treated. Bathing in or 

ingesting sewage-contaminated water can cause infections and transmit 

diseases. 

Sediments have their own hidden community of tiny inert and living 

components such as roots of living plants as well as populations of 

microorganisms and animals (VORONEY, 2007). Sediment covers 

more than 2-3 times of the earth’s surface. There are two basic origins of 

the particles composing marine sediment 1) created in situ from the 

dissolved components, 2) carried by the water body through land or 

atmosphere. 

The sediment is the result of soil erosion, and it was suggested to act 

as reservoir of pathogens from which can be released again into the 

water column as a result of natural or artificial phenomenon (ALM et al. 

2003). Due to the high capabilities adsorption and accumulation 

phenomenon, their concentrations become several orders of magnitude 

greater than the corresponding overlaying water column. 

Sediments are considered the only refuge for solid-associated viruses 

from the water column to settle in at the water’s bottom, which may 

enhance the survival of these pathogens by reducing exposure to various 

stressors such as sunlight; it has been proven that viral abundance in the 

sediment exceeds that in the water column by an order of magnitude 

(DANOVARO et al., 1999; DANOVARO; SERRESI 2000; 

DANOVARO et al., 2002; DANOVARO; MIDDELBOE, 2010). 

Particles shed in fecal material in soil at low temperatures or in sediment 



37 

underwater will survive the longest and may be detectable for months or 

years (PERCIVAL et al., 2004). Recent studies suggested that sediment 

plays an important role in pathogen contamination by acting as a 

reservoir from which these pathogens can be re-released into the water 

column as a result of natural or artificial phenomena such as wind or 

swimming activity (SMITH et al., 1978; SCHAIBERGER et al., 1982; 

BOSCH, 1998; TOZE, 1999; SUBEKTI et al., 2002; ALM et al., 2003; 

SEARCY et al., 2006; SALVO; FABIANO, 2007). 

 

1.2 Enteric viruses 

The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in water generally 

results from pollution from human and animal faeces, from urban and 

rural wastewater (GONZALEZ et al., 1982). Whereas most waterborne 

pathogens have in common their origin in the faeces of sick individuals, 

a condition for assessing the microbiological quality of the water is the 

examination of indicators of faecal contamination (AMARAL et al., 

2003). The most common microorganisms used as indicators are thermo 

tolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (ORTEGA et al., 

2009). Unfortunately as we mentioned before, these bacteria cannot 

always be related to the presence of the virus, because they are also 

more persistent and stable than bacteria (PINA et al., 1998; LEES, 

2000). 

Enteric viruses enter into the environment by the wastes excreted by 

infected humans and animals. The aquatic ecosystem may also be 

contaminated as a result of sewage discharge or run-off from agriculture 

activities. (FONG; LIPP, 2005). Once introduced into coastal waters, 

they can easily absorb to solid particles, thereby protecting themselves 

from inactivating factors and may result in unpredictable resuspension 

to water column again due to natural or artificial sediment disruption 

(GERBA et al., 1977; SOBSEY et al., 1980). 

The contamination of surface water by enteric viruses is one of the 

major public health concerns in relation to water resources used for 

drinking due to the health risks caused by these viruses. The destiny of 

these pathogens in the aquatic environment is controlled by sorption-

desorption processes after they are being released to surface water 

(WONG et al., 2012 &amp;amp; 2013). Due to their size, these suspended 

particles seem to be the most important natural vehicle for these 

colloidal viruses in water column as a result of this phenomenon 

(GERBA et al., 1988; SCHWARTZBROD, 1995).  

Recent studies suggested that sediments play an important role on 

pathogens spreading acting as reservoirs from which these pathogens 



38 

can be released again on water column as a result of natural or artificial 

phenomena such as wind or swimming activities (BOSCH, 1998; ALM, 

et al., 2003; SALVO; FABIANO, 2007; SEARCY et al., 2006).  

Enteric viruses are major agents of gastroenteritis and hepatitis 

outbreaks in humans. Some of these viruses have been detected in water 

and sediment: human adenovirus (HAdV) which cause various diseases 

including gastroenteritis, upper and lower respiratory system infections, 

and conjunctivitis (WONG et al., 2013; JIANG et al., 2006; CALGUA 

et al., 2011, VERHEYEN et al., 2009, MIURA et al., 2009), rotaviruses 

(RVA) which is the major viral agent of severe diarrhea in children 

(GREEN; LEWIS, 1999; LE GUYADER et al., 1994) and hepatitis A 

virus which cause hepatitis (LE GUYADER et al., 1994; 

JOTHIKUMAR et al.,  2000).  

 

1.2.1 Adenovirus  

Adenovirus constitutes a large group of DNA viruses that infect 

humans among other species (PEREIRA, 1963). The virus was first 

discovered in 1953 by Rowe and colleagues (ROWE et al., 1953) where 

they reported a viral agent causing degeneration of epithelial-like cells 

from tonsils and adenoids surgically removed from children. After 

Hilleman and co-workers isolated related agents from military personnel 

with respiratory illness in the United States (HILLEMAN et al., 1954). 

The viruses were first called adenoid degeneration (AD), adenoid-

pharyngeal conjunctival (APC) and acute respiratory disease (ARD) 

agents, but in 1956 they were named adenoviruses (ENDERS et al., 

1956). Adenoviruses were then associated with respiratory disease, 

acute hemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis and epidemic kerato 

conjunctivitis (EKC). However, in 1962 it was demonstrated for the first 

time that adenovirus type 12 could induce malignant tumors in rodents 

(TRENTIN et al., 1962). Other serotypes (including Ad5) were found to 

be non-oncogenic.  

All Adenoviruses belongs to the family Adenoviridae, with 
icosahedral viral capsid which is divided into five genera: 

Mastadenoviruses infecting mammals, Aviadenovirus infecting birds, 

Siadenovirus infects birds and frogs and finally Atadenovirus infecting a 

broad range of hosts including avian, reptile and marsupial host 

(BENKO et al., 2000). A possible fifth genera infecting fishes has been 

proposed to be called Ichtadenovirus (BENKO et al., 2002) as shown in 

Fig. 2.  

The genera are separated primarily on the basis of difference in 

immunological properties of the virions. There are fifty-six human 

http://aem.asm.org/search?author1=Jens+Verheyen&amp;amp;sortspec=date&amp;amp;submit=Submit


39 

adenovirus serotypes and they have been distinguished on the basis of 

their resistance to neutralizing by antiserum to other known 

adenoviruses (DE JONG et al., 1999; CDC-National Center for 

Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2015).  

Human adenoviruses cause infections of various severities. They are 

associated with different clinical syndromes which are caused by 

cytopathogenic effect on cells in the infected organs. Subgroup C which 

includes Ad type 5 is associated with respiratory illness (HORWITZ, 

2007) and it is suggested that the disease is transmitted via aerosol. 

Other subgroups are associated with pharyngoconjunctival fever, 

epidemic keratoconjuntivitis, and gastroenteritis. These infections are 

suggested to be transmitted either via poorly chlorinated pools eye-to-

hand-hand-to-eye contact (AZAR et al., 1996) and fecal-oral routes 

(WADELL, 1988; HORWITZ, 2007).

shape of the icosahedral viral capsid with their hexons and pentons, b) and 

fimbriae internal content of the viral capsid (genome and protein monitoring).

HAdV causes many diseases such as gastroenteritis, urethritis, 

cervicitis, pharyngitis, acute respiratory diseases, conjunctivitis, and 

meningoencephalitis (FONG; LIPP, 2005). Of 56 serotypes of HAdV 

reported in the literature, replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and 

therefore can be excreted in high concentrations in feces (10

particles / gram) (BANYAI et al., 2009). Since they are DNA viruses,

which promotes more resistance to environmental degradation, such as 

UV radiation, temperature, chlorine concentration and pH variation, 

including sewage treatment procedures (PINA et al., 1998, CARTER, 

2005; LECHEVALLIER; AU, 2004; FONG; LIPP, 2005). Furthermore, 

HAdV have been described in drinking water (FONG et al., 2005; 

RIGOTTO et al., 2010; GARCIA et al., 2012), in recreational waters 

(MIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; SINCLAIR et al., 2009; FONGARO et 

al., 2012), associated with disease outbreaks in swimming pools 

(PAPAPETROPOLOU; VANTARAKIS, 1995; HARLEY et al., 2001), 

and in polluted waters (PINA et al., 1998; LAVERICK et al., 2004; LEE 

et al., 2004; MIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; WONG et al., 2009; 

RIGOTTO et al., 2010; MORESCO et al., 2012). Moreover, HAdV 

were found to be more prevalent than other enteric viruses in different 

aquatic environment (WONG et al., 2009; WYN-JONES et al., 2011; 

GARCIA et al., 2012; FONGARO et al., 2012; MORESCO et al., 

2012). All together, these characteristics may provide a useful index of 

human faecal pollution and human viral contamination. Among other 

enteric viruses, adenovirus is considered a high priority emerging 

contaminant present in drinking water, candidate parameter 

contamination of the aquatic environment (USEPA, 2009). 

The hexon is the largest capsid protein. The molecular mass is 

approximately 360kDa consisting of three identical subunits with 

120kDa each (ATHAPPILLY et al., 1994). The hexon surface loops 

display the highest variability between adenovirus serotypes and contain 

most of the type specific epitopes (EBNER et al., 2005). 

All Adenoviruses genomes are double stranded DNA of 

approximately 36Kb. After infection, the transcription of AdV has two 

mainly phases namely early (occur before replication) and late phases 

(occur after replication). 

The entire adenovirus genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA of 

approximately 36Kb. There are approximately 2 phases of adenovirus 

transcription, named early and late phases, which occur before and after 

replication. The early-transcribed regions are E1, E2, E3 and E4. E1 

include two gene products, E1A and E1B which are involved in the 

replication of this virus inside host cell. E2 acts as machinery for viral 

DNA replication and late genes transcriptions. E3 plays an important 

role in modulating the immune response of infected cells. E4 promotes 

virus DNA replication and shut-off synthesis of protein for the host cells 

(GRAHAM et al., 1977).

1.2.2 Rotaviruses 

Rotavirus is the most common cause of viral diarrheal disease in 

both developed and developing countries worldwide, where they 

constitute a major cause of mortality among the young children. More 

than 500,000 children under five years of age still die from rotavirus 

infection each year (KAPIKIAN et al., 2001). Human rotaviruses were 

discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron 

micrograph images (BISHOP et al., 1973). Rotavirus is a genus of 

double-stranded RNA virus within the family Reoviridae. Rotaviruses 

are icosahedral 65-70 nm particles, non-enveloped (resistant to lipid 

solvents), and the capsid contains all enzymes for mRNA production 

(KAPIKIAN et al., 2001). 

There are eight species of this virus, referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, 

G and H. Rotavirus A, the most common specie, causes more than 90% 

of rotavirus infections in humans. The rotavirus genome contains 11 

segments of dsRNA, which have a size range of 0.6 to 3.3 kilobase pairs 

each (MATTION et al., 1994). These viruses are transmitted by faecal- 

oral route. In infected persons, after an incubation period of about two 

days, rotaviruses damage the cells that lining the small intestine and 

cause severe gastroenteritis. Symptoms often start with vomiting 

followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Symptomatic 

infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and 

decrease in adults due to immunity that they acquired in their childhood. 

Transmission happens by contact with contaminated water, food, and 

surface or even by contact with contaminated persons. Rotavirus is very 

stable in the environment and may remain viable in the environment for 

weeks or months if not disinfected (WILDE et al., 1992; ABAD et al., 

1994). Rotavirus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract prior to onset 

of diarrhea has been well documented in the literature (LUDIN et al., 

2003). 

Zoonotic nature of rotavirus is reported in some cases worldwide. 

The segmented nature of the RV genome allows for gene reassortment 

upon co-infection of a single cell with 2 different RV strains and this 

may highlight the role of animal as a source of rotavirus infection to 

humans (NAKAGOMI; NAKAGOMI, 1993). Rotaviruses have been 

detected in raw or treated sewage (KARGAR et al., 2013). 

There are six viral proteins (VPs) that form the virus particle (virion) 

as shown in Fig. 3. These structural proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, 

VP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition to the VPs, there are six nonstructural 

proteins (NSPs), which are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. 

These are called NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6.  The 



42 

glycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease-sensitive 

protein VP4 defines P serotypes (KIRKWOOD, 2010). 

The virus is composed by three concentric shells that enclose 11 

gene segments. The outermost shell contains two important proteins 

VP7, or G-protein, and VP4, or P-protein. VP7 and VP4 define the 

serotype of the virus and induce neutralizing antibody that is probably 

involved in immune protection. G1 [P8] genotype is the world's most 

prevalent, accounting for over 70% of RV-A infections in North 

America, Europe and Australia, but only 30% of RV-A infection in 

South America and Asia, and 23% in Africa (TATE et al., 2010).

viral protein of the respective layers: VP2 (internal), VP4 (external) VP6

Animal and human RVs in vitro cultivation has been done by using 

of primary and transformed monkey kidney cells (HASEGAWA et al., 

1982; SATO et al., 1981; WARD et al., 1991; WARD et al., 1984; 

WYATT et al., 1983; WYATT et al., 1980) Cultivation is achieved by 

pretreatment of virus with trypsin as a proteolytic activation (5 to 10 

µg/mL). Many cell lines are used for isolation of rotavirus from the 

clinical samples such as simian MA104 rhesus monkey kidney cells and 

continuous human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (CaCo-2 and HT-29) 

but at the same time there are many rotavirus out of group A proven to 

be quite fastidious and difficult to grow on cell lines (LI et al., 2009). 
In the United States alone, 2.7 million cases of rotavirus 

gastroenteritis occurred yearly before initiation of the rotavirus 

vaccination. Rotavirus infections occur primarily during cool, dry 

seasons and the seasonal distribution of rotavirus infection has been 

extensively reported in many studies worldwide (KAPIKIAN et al., 



43 

2001; MORESCO et al., 2012, RIGOTTO et al., 2010, SATO et al 

2010; FONGARO et al., 2012). 

Since 2006, two oral rotavirus vaccines have been licensed and 

available in North and South American, European and Eastern 

Mediterranean countries, where they have significantly reduced the 

burden of rotavirus-induced diarrhea. 

In 2006, a live, oral, human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine 

(RotaTeq®, produced by Merck and Company, Whitehouse Station, 

New Jersey) was recommended for routine vaccination of US infants. 

Three doses of this vaccine are recommended to be administered at ages 

2, 4, and 6 month. RotaTeq® contains five reassortant rotaviruses 

developed from human and bovine parent rotavirus strains that express 

human outer capsid proteins of five common circulating strains (G1, G2, 

G3, G4, and P[8] (subgroup P1A)) 

In 2006, an attenuated monovalent G1,P[8] human rotavirus strain 

Rotarix® (produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, 

Belgium), and is recommended by the manufacturer to be orally 

administered in 2 doses to infants at ages 2 and 4 months. In Brazil, 

attenuated G1P [8] vaccine, was included in the Immunization Program 

since 2006 (FUMIAN et al., 2011). 

In 2014, Rotavac was licensed by the Drugs Controller General of 

India (DCGI). The vaccine originated in India from an attenuated 

(weakened) strain of rotavirus that was isolated from an Indian child 

(WHO, 2014). 

 

1.2.3 Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 

Feinstone and co-workers in 1973 (FEINSTONE et al., 1973) were 

identifies HAV by immune electron microscopy of infected persons 

feces. In 1979 the first trial for cultivating HAV in cell culture done by 

Provost and Hilleman (PROVOST; HILLEMAN, 1979). HAV is a 

member of Picornaviridae family, and is the only member and type 

species of the genus Hepatovirus. HAV is a nonenveloped virus, 27 to 

32 nm in diameter with an icosahedral capsid (HOLLINGER; 

EMERSON, 2001) as shown in Fig. 4. Virion RNA is plus sense, single 

stranded and 7,478 nucleotides in length. An icosahedral capsid formed 

by several copies of three or four VP1 protein, VP2, VP3 and VP4, and 

the latter one, play an important role in the formation of the viral particle 

(HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2001; PINTO et al., 2010). HAV has only 

one serotype and seven different genetic groups (four humans and three 

simian) (CRISTINA; COSTA-MATTIOLI, 2007). 



44 

Transmission of HAV may be occurring by ingestion of 

contaminated water and food or even by contaminated shellfish with the 

transmission via the fecal-oral. Following ingestion, HAV enters the 

bloodstream through the epithelium of the oropharynx or intestine and 

go directly to the liver, where it multiplies within 

hepatocytes. Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool with 

large concentration after about 11 days from symptoms appearance. 

 
Figure 4: Diagram of the picornavirus structure of the hepatitis A virus (HAV). 

The icosahedral capsid is made up of four viral polypeptides (VP1 to VP4). 

Inside the capsid is a single-strand positive sense RNA that has a genomic viral 

protein (VPg) on the 5'end.

HAV adapted in fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line (FRhk 4), but 

HAV did not show any morphological changes on the infected cells. In 

1978, MATHIESEN and co-worker (MATHIESEN et al., 1978) succeed 

to demonstrate HAV replication by direct immunofluorescence analysis. 

However, HAV is usually difficult to adapt and grow in vitro scale. 
The clinical course may vary from asymptomatic, acute self-limiting 

hepatitis in patients with unapparent or subclinical hepatitis to life 

threatening acute liver failure (ALF) which occasionally develop 

fulminant hepatitis and die (HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2001). 

Poor sanitary conditions and regional socio-economic conditions are 

the main sources for outbreaks caused by HAV (VILLAR et al., 2006). 

HAV consider being endemic in Brazil and this is confirmed by many 
epidemiological data that show that 90% of Brazilian people have anti-

HAV antibodies (CARRILHO et al., 2005). 

Uncooked bivalves such as oysters and clams which harvested from 

water contaminated with sewage are responsible for many outbreaks 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharynx
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virions


45 

worldwide and this fact due to these shellfish able to filter large amount 

of water (contaminated by human sewage) per hour over a short period 

during their feeding where HAV can be concentrated at least 100-fold 

and persist for about 7 days (ENRIQUEZ et al., 1992; SÁNCHEZ et al., 

2002; VILLAR et al., 2006).  

Many studies have shown the presence of HAV in aquatic 

environment including water treatment systems, lagoon and surface 

water since it has a chemical-physical characteristics that ensure their 

strength, it is not susceptible to degradation by detergents, relatively 

resistant to temperatures up to 60°C and inactivated partially when 

incubated for a period of 10 to 12 hours at this temperature and may still 

remain infectious for days or months in contaminated water (Cuthbert 

2001; HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2007). 

There are two types of vaccines against HAV, the first one 

containing inactivated HAV (Havrix) and another containing a live 

attenuated virus (VAQTA) (IRVING et al., 2012). The vaccine protects 

against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years. The 

vaccine should be given in the muscle of the upper arm and be given in 

two doses for the best protection. An initial dose provides protection 

starting two to four weeks after vaccination; the second dose, given six 

to 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years and the proven 

efficiency of vaccination, since there is only one serotype of HAV 

current worldwide (IRVING et al., 2012). 

 

1.2.4 Norovirus (NVs) 

Norovirus was identified in 1972 by Kapikian and colleagues 

(Kapikian et al., 1972), using immune electron microscopy. Noroviruses 

belong to Caliciviridae family, RNA single-stranded positive sense, 

non-enveloped with a diameter of approximately 27 nm. Contain three 

open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein 

which is cleaved at six other important proteins involved in viral 

replication, like the viral polymerase. ORF 2 encodes the structural 

protein VP1 and VP2 which are important for the ORF 3 protein. 

(ATMAR, 2010) as shown in Fig. 5.

(http://viralzone.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/194.html, 2016) 

 

Norovirus is a very contagious virus. It can be transmitted via 

dealing with infected persons, contaminated water or food, even by 

eating uncooked shellfish. Infection by norovirus can lead to serious 

gastroenteritis especially for young children and older adults. 

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. 

The most common norovirus strain (genogroup II genotype 4) is a major 

cause of outbreaks worldwide with an estimated 23 million cases in the 

United States of America each year, is transmitted by the fecal-oral 

route and by aerosol (SUFFREDINI et al., 2012; MESQUITA et al., 

2011; TERIO et al., 2010; GENTRY; VINJE; LIPP, 2009). 

Until this moment there is only one publication in the literature done 

by JONES et al., (2014) which describes the possible culture and 

replication of human norovirus in vitro with the presence of enteric 

bacteria that express antigens HBGA (histo-blood group antigen). 

However, the murine norovirus (NVM) was the only norovirus that 

showed in vitro replication capacity in cell culture (WOBUS; 

THACKRAY; HERBERT, 2006). 

Murine norovirus (MNV-1) which was used in the fourth chapter of 

this work, has been widely used as a substitute and surrogate for human 

norovirus, it belongs to the same family and has great structural 
similarity and transmission route (CANNON et al., 2006). Murine 

norovirus has the ability to infect in vitro murine macrophage cell line 

RAW264.7, causing a clear cytopathic effect in about 36 h. The lysis 

assay plate is well standardized, providing information on viral viability 

http://viralzone.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/194.html


47 

within 48 h (GONZALEZ-HERNANDEZ; CUNHA; WOBUS, 2012; 

PREDMORE; LI, 2011). 

 

1.3 Coliphage as indicator for fecal pollution 

Although enteric bacterial indicators have been used as acceptable 

tools to estimate the microbiological quality of environmental waters, 

many waterborne pathogens that cause illness and diseases in humans 

are enteric viruses. Microbial indicators such as total coliforms, fecal 

coliforms may be unreliable indicators for predicting enteric virus 

presence in contaminated water and the associated human health risks. 
Compared to bacterial indicators, enteric viruses have shown higher 

survival rates during wastewater and drinking water treatment and 

greater persistence in environmental waters (CONTRERAS-COLL et 

al., 2002; DURAN et al., 2002; HARWOOD et al., 2005; MOCE-

LLIVINA et al., 2005; JOFRE et al., 1995).  

Due to higher persistence and resistance of waterborne enteric 

viruses compared to bacterial indicators, water which is defined as safe 

based on bacterial indicator measurement may still cause disease or 

illness to consumers due to the enteric viruses still present (DORE et al., 

2000; FORMIGA-CRUZ et al., 2003). Therefore, bacterial indicators 

alone do not provide a complete assessment of microbiological water 

quality. By using at least one or two viral indicator for prediction the 

presence of enteric viruses in the aquatic environment will help us to 

better assessment of water quality and provide more confidence on 

water safety.  

There are several candidate viral indicators to predict virus 

contamination in environmental waters. Many studies advocated phages 

infected enteric bacteria as a potential viral indicator to estimate the 

microbial contamination in the water environment, also as indicators of 

water treatment process efficacy (HAVELAAR, 1993). Bacteriophages, 

specifically phages of Escherichia coli (Coliphages) are proposed 

candidate indicators of human enteric viruses in water. They are present 

in human and animal feces and some are small, icosahedral and non-

enveloped viruses, making them structurally similar to enteric viruses. 

There are two main types of coliphages: somatic and the male-specific 

(F+).  

The somatic coliphages are DNA viruses which are able to infect E. 
coli by attaching to specific sites on the outer cell membrane, such as 

lipopolysaccharide. The male-specific coliphages are single-stranded 

RNA and DNA viruses that infect the cell via the pili appendages 

present on the surface of male strains of the bacterium. Many studies in 



48 

the literature documented that male-specific coliphages play as viral 

indicators depending on their investigations (DORE et al., 2000; COLE 

et al., 2003; COLFORD et al., 2007; LOVE; SOBSEY, 2007). However, 

their infrequent presence in human feces, their relative scarcity and their 

rapid decay rates in high temperature waters (LOVE et al., 2007) limit 

their usefulness as indicator viruses. Somatic coliphages also have been 

proposed as fecal indicators of human enteric viruses in studies of 

sewage, source water for drinking water and marine waters (MOCE-

LLIVINA et al., 2005; MUNIESA et al., 2007; JOFRE, 2008), and real-

time monitoring of somatic coliphages as fecal indicators has been 

suggested by previous investigators (ARAUJO et al., 1997; SKRABER 

et al., 2004, GARCIA-ALJARO et al., 2008). So we include in this part 

of the work the detection and enumeration of somatic coliphage (PHI-X-

174) as indicator of enteric viruses to try to make a possible correlation 

between them and the presence of the studied enteric viruses (HAdV, 

RVA, HAV).

This chapter will present and discuss the results regarding the enteric 

viruses assessment in water and sediment samples collected at 

Sangradouro River and beach of Peri Lagoon by real time PCR (qPCR) 

and also by cell culture techniques. These results were published in 

Journal of Water and Health.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

The general experimental design to perform the present work 

consisted in two stages: 1) monitoring enteric viruses (HAdV, RVA and 

HAV) during the summer and winter seasons of the year 2013 as well as 

the physical-chemical parameters in surface water and sediment samples 

of Sangradouro River and Peri Lagon; 2) evaluating HAdV infectivity 

for all positive samples detected by qPCR. 

 

2.1 Description of the study area 

2.1.1 Peri lagoon  

The Peri Lagoon is a small coastal lagoon, located in southern Brazil, 

in Santa Catarina state, in the southeastern portion of Santa Catarina 

Island (27
?
44´S and 48

?
31´W), Florianópolis. The Peri Lagoon 

environment has suffered over several decades, a strong environmental 

degradation with an increasing population occupying their surroundings 

and landfills. Dumping of sewage is one of the most common forms of 

pollution coastal areas and the population living in the surrounding areas 

that are contaminated is affected, since many people use this 

environment as their source of livelihood and recreation. Furthermore, 

the contaminants released together with the sewage may accumulate in 

the sediment, including bacteria and viruses pathogens that cause risks 

to health (LEES, 2000; MUNIAN-MUJIKA et al., 2000) (Fig. 7).  

The Peri lagoon has a surface area of 5.7 km
2
, is surrounded by 

mountains, and currently constitutes the main source of drinking water 

for the island inhabitants because it has no direct seawater influence. 

Waters of the lagoon are drained into Sangradouro River in a 

unidirectional sense that extends towards the south of the island, 

crossing areas of urban occupation and emptying into the ocean to the 

east between the beaches of Armação and Matadeiro. The river waters 

are used to deposit illegal sewage discharge from neighborhood 

residences. The climate in the area is subtropical, with rainfall well 

distributed throughout the year (1.85 mm annual rainfall), although 

rainfall is more frequent during the summer months than during the 

winter (CECCA, 1996 and 1997). The lagoon was the first point of 

water collection as shown in Fig. 6 (a, b). 

The second collection site, comprised of points 2 through 6, was in 

Sangradouro River. Points 2 and 3 had sediment that consisted of 

mainly sand and probably sewage, while points 4 and 5 had sediment 

that consisted of sand, silt, gravel, and probably sewage. Point 6, at the 

fourth sample collection area located at the end of Sangradouro River, 

was the collection point closest to the beach of Armação, and the 



70 

sediment of this point consisted of mainly sand and probably sewage as 

shown in Fig (7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12)

2.2 Sampling 

2.2.1 Water and sediment  
A total of 48 surface water samples (about 10-15 cm in deep, 2 L 

each) were collected from the six points of collection during the summer 

and winter of 2013 year. Four collections were done for each season, 

with summer collections occurring during March/April 2013 and winter 

collections occurring during July/August 2013. Additionally, a total of 

48 sediment samples (20 g was taken from each collection for analysis) 

were collected in parallel with the water samples at each collection point 

using Petersen grab samplers (provided by LAPAD- Laboratório de 

Biologia e Cultivo de Peixes de Água Doce) as shown in Fig. 13.  

The samples were transported to the laboratory on ice in sterile 

containers and were immediately processed. A sum of 96 samples was 

collected from 6 sites during one year.

2.3 Physical-chemical analysis  

Water temperature (WT), conductivity (Cond), pH, salinity (Sal.) 

and dissolved oxygen (DO) were immediately measured in situ with 
specific probes (WTW-Multi350i) after collection, as is outlined in the 

standard methods for examination of water and wastewater (APHA, 

1998).  

For sediment samples, the total solid, volatile solid, fixed solid and 

humidity were measured, according to APHA (2012). (These analyzes 

were carried out in partnership with the Water Ecology Laboratory 

Continental, Department of Ecology and Zoology at the Federal 

University of Santa Catarina, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello 

Petrucio). 

 

2.4 Viral concentration in water samples 

Determination of viral concentrations in the surface water samples 

was performed using the protocol described by KATAYAMA et al., 

(2002). Briefly, water samples were filtered in a vacuum system 

provided with negatively charged membrane (Nihon Millipore
®
, Tokyo, 

Japan) with a pore size of 0.45 µm and a diameter of 142 mm (Fig. 14), 

with a flow of 200 mL / min. Prior to filtration, the pH was adjusted to 

7.5-8.0 with the addition of 25 mL of MgCl2 [2M] so, the viral particles, 

naturally negatively charged, were turned positive after the addition of 

the cationic Mg
2+

 ions, allowing the adsorption of these positively 

charged viral particles on the negatively charged membranes during the 

filtration process. The membrane was further washed with 350 mL of 

H2SO4 solution [0.5 mM] pH 3.0 to ensure retention of viral particles in 

it and remove other biosolids present. Then, the membrane was removed 

from the filter and, in sterile glassware; the viruses were eluted, by the 



74 

addition of 11 mL of NaOH [1 mM] pH 10.5, kept in constant contact 

with the membrane by stirring during 10 min. The eluate was 

neutralized by adding 50 ?L of H2SO4 solution [50 mM] and 50 ?L Tris-

EDTA buffer solution [100X] 1 mM pH 8.0. After this step, the samples 

were ultra-filtrated by using a Centriprep Concentrator 50
®
 system 

(Nihon Millipore
®
, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain a final volume of 

approximately 5.0 mL. The concentrated samples were stored at ?80°C 

until further analysis.

2.5 Viral concentration from sediment samples 
Determination of viral concentrations in the sediment samples was 

performed according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 

1992) guidelines, with minor modifications as described by 

SCHLINDWEIN et al., (2010).  

Briefly, 0.05 M AlCl3 solution was added to 20g of wet sediment 

diluted with the addition of an equal volume of phosphate buffer (PBS), 

and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with 5 M HCl. To dislodge viruses, 

samples were then subjected to sonication on ice 3 times, each for 30 
sec. followed by a centrifugation step at 2,422 ?g for 15 min. at 4 ºC. 

The resulting pellet was suspended in 10 mL Glycine buffer 0.25M, pH 

9.5 and stirred during 1 hr, followed by another centrifugation step at 

7,656 ?g for 30 min. at 4ºC. For viral concentration, PEG 6000 

precipitation was employed as described by LEWIS; METCALF (1988). 



75 

The supernatant was transferred to another tube containing 8% PEG 

6000, pH 7.2 and stay on the stirring for about 2 h 4ºC. A final 

centrifugation step was done at 7,656 ?g for 90 min. at 4ºC. The pellet 

was suspended in 10.0 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2). Decontamination 

step was carried out adding chloroform (1:3) followed by centrifugation 

at 7,656 ?g for 15 min. The upper (aqueous) phase was recovered, 

aliquoted and stored at ?80°C until further analysis. 

 

2.6 Evaluation of viral recovery in surface water samples by 

adsorption-elution method  
Water samples from the sampling sites were artificially inoculated 

with a known amount of the HAdV (2x10
6
 PFU/mL). The samples were 

concentrated as described above and the viral recovery was determined 

by plaque assay and also by integrated cell culture RT-qPCR reaction, 

preceded by enzymatic treatment (ICC-et- RT-qPCR) (FONGARO et 

al., 2012). 

 

2.7 Evaluation of viral recovery in sediment samples using 

Glycine/PEG buffer method compared with beef extract method 
This experiment was designed to determine the efficiency of virus 

recovery after the concentration of the samples using the methods 

described by SCHLINDWEIN et al., (2010) and KATZENELSON et 

al., (1976) as described in section 2.5 and to decide which one would be 

used for the field samples, according to their performances. Two 

experiments were conducted in duplicate to evaluate the viral recovery 

rates from sediment samples. Murine Norovirus (MNV-1) and Simian 

Rotavirus (RV-SA11) were used as model viruses to seed the samples. 

Sediment samples from the sampling sites were artificially inoculated 

with a known amount of these viruses (2.6x10
9
 GC/mL for MNV and 

8.0x10
6
 GC/mL for RV-SA11). The samples were concentrated 

separately by Glycine/Polyethylene buffer as described in section 2.5 

and beef extract method which was done briefly as following: sediment 

sample (300g) diluted in beef extract 3%, and then stirring step was 

done for 30 min. to form flocs. After a centrifugation step at 1,914 ?g 

during 30 min. at 4ºC the supernatant was recovered and the pH was 

adjusted to 3.5 using 5M HCl and stirred again for more 30 min. Then a 

centrifugation step at 1914 ?g for 15 min. at 4ºC was carried out and the 

pellet was suspended in 10 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 9). 

Decontamination step was carried out as described above in section 2.5 

using chloroform. Then, MNV and SA-11 RV recovery from the 

respective samples was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using a 



76 

TaqMan technique, as previously described by BAERT, et al., (2008) 

and ZENG et al., (2008). The calculation of the RVA-SA11 recovery 

percentage (in number of genome copies) was accounted for the original 

number of viruses seeded in the experiment. 

 

2.8 Extraction of viral nucleic acids 
Nucleic acid extraction was performed using a QIAamp MinElute

®
 

Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Brazil), following the manufacturer’s 

instructions. Briefly, the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit simplifies 

purification of viral DNA and RNA with fast spin-column filled with a 

silica-based reagent based on the protocol already described by BOOM 

et al., (1990). The starting sample volumes were 0.2 mL and this 

technique combines the selective binding properties of the nucleic acids 

to the  silica columns with a flexible elution volumes of around 60 ?L 

followed by storing at -80 °C prior to analysis. 

 

2.9 Quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) 

Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as described 

by HERNROTH et al., (2002); JOTHIKUMAR et al., (2005); ZENG 

et al., (2008) and Baert et al., (2008) for amplification of HAdV, 

HAV, RVA and MNV, respectively, using primers and probes as 

shown in Table 1. The Taqman Universal qPCR Master Mix 

(Applied Biosystems) was used for HAdV and the Kit QuantiTect 

probe RT-PCR (QIAGEN) was used for HAV, RVA, and MNV.  

All amplifications were performed in a StepOne Plus
®
 Real-Time 

qPCR System (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in 

duplicate. To avoid inhibition of the enzymatic assay, the nucleic 

acids were prior diluted at 1:10 before their addition on the qPCR 

reaction. A standard curve was generated for all of the viruses using 

a 10-fold serial dilution of the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, USA) 

containing the target region appropriate for the virus type. Triplicate 

samples were used for each dilution point, and a standard curve was 

run for each set of assays. Ultrapure water was used as the non-

template control, and non-amplification controls were included in 

each run.

2.10 Viral integrity test  
This study aimed to identify intact adenovirus particles (HAdV) 

through enzymatic assay in order to degrade possible free viral genomes 

present in the sample matrix and compare the total genomes detected 

with the genomes from intact viral particles. 

To study the presence of undamaged HAdV particles, the samples 

were treated with DNAse I. Briefly, the reaction was performed by 

adding 1 U of DNAse I (a sufficient quantity to degrade 100% of DNA 

added), 1X buffer and 170 ?L of nuclease-free water as a negative 

control for each concentrated sample, and the reaction was then 

incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the enzyme activity 

was inactivated by adding EDTA at final concentration of 25 mM and 

incubation for 10 min. at 70°C. This was done to check the integrity of 

the viral capsid, because genetic material that was not protected by the 

viral capsid would be degraded by this nuclease (NUANUALSUWAN; 

CLIVER, 2002). All samples positive for HAdV in the real time PCR 

assay were subjected to a DNAse I degradation reaction following the 

manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma–Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) to 

degrade all free viral DNA present in the samples, as described by 

VIANCELLI et al., (2012). All treated samples were subjected to 

nucleic acid extraction and qPCR, as described in section 2.9. 

 

 

 



78 

2.11 Study of the infectivity of HAdV in surface water and sediment 

samples 

This study aimed to identify infectious/viable particles of HAdV that 

were previously detected by qPCR, by inoculating samples in cell 

culture and perform the plaque assay which was used to assess the viral 

infectivity. 

 

2.11.1 Cell Line 
The cultivation of the cell line A549 (epithelial cells derived from 

human lung carcinoma and permissive to most human adenoviruses 

kindly provided by Dr. Rosina Gironès from the University of 

Barcelona, Spain) was carried out in cell culture flasks (75cm
2
), using 

minimal essential medium containing Eagle's salts (MEM) 

supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum [(FBS) Gibco], 1% 

antibiotics and antifungal [(PSA-penicillin G Cultilab 100U/mL/100 g 

streptomycin sulfate/mL /Amphotericin B 0.25 g / mL. 

 

2.11.2 Cytotoxicity assay  

The cytotoxicity of concentrated surface water and sediment samples 

were evaluated on A549 cells. These cells were propagated in cell 

culture using 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10
5
 cells per well, as 

described on section 2.12, but without addition of FBS, 24 h before 

conducting the tests. 

Environmental samples concentrated as described section 2.4 and 

2.5, were pretreated with 1% antibiotic/antifungal (100 U penicillin G / 

mL / streptomycin 100?g /mL amphotericin B 0.25?g /mL) and diluted 

in 1X MEM in the following proportions: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4. An inoculum of 

100 ?L of each dilution in triplicate were placed in contact with the cells 

for 1h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and uniform mixing every 15 

min. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed and 1 mL of MEM 

containing 1% PSA was added to the cells, two cell controls were 

maintained and these cells contained only medium. The plates were 

incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and the cell monolayer was 

monitored for seven days. 

Cells containing inoculated test samples were compared with control 

cell under a light microscope. Sequentially, cells were fixed and stained 

with 300?L of Naphthalene Black solution (0.1% Naphthalene Black, 

5% Acetic Acid, pH 2.3-2.4). The cell monolayer was stained and 

examined for the non-cytotoxic dilution, for each of tested samples in 

order to be furthered used for infectivity assays. 

 



79 

2.11.3 Plaque Assay for HAdV  

To quantify the presence of infectious HAdV in environmental 

samples, all of the water and sediment samples testing positive for viral 

genome presence (as previously detected by qPCR) were treated with 

antibiotics (10 U/mL penicillin, 10 ?g/ mL streptomycin and 0.025 ?g 

/mL amphotericin B). For all tested samples, a non-cytotoxic dilution 

was then selected and inoculated (0.2 mL) into A549 cells, in triplicate. 

These cells were previously cultivated in 24-well tissue culture plates at 

a density of 3.0 × 10
6
 cells / well and were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 

for 24 h as described by FONGARO et al., (2013); CROMEANS et al., 

(2008); and RIGOTTO et al., (2010).  

Briefly, the cells were incubated during 1h at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 

were gently rocked every 15 min for viral adsorption. The inoculated 

cells were then carefully washed once with pre-warmed PBS and 

overlaid with warm high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 

(2x), 0.6% warm Bacto-agar containing 5% FBS, 0.1 mM sodium 

pyruvate, 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 ?g/mL streptomycin and 26 mM 

MgCl2. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 7 days. One 

week post-infection, the agar overlay was removed gently, and the cells 

were stained with 20% Gram’s crystal violet. The cell monolayer was 

examined microscopically, and plaques were counted and expressed as 

PFU/mL. 

 

2.12 Statistical analyses 
To evaluate the possible correlation between viral detection in 

samples from each point of collection, a Pearson correlation and linear 

regression test, a two way ANOVA test and a Student’s t test were 

performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (USA); data were considered 

statistically significant at a P-value ? 0.05. 
 

3. RESULTS 

3.1 Physical-chemical analysis 
The means of the physical-chemical parameters measured for all 

samples from each collection point in both summer and winter 

collections are presented in Table 2. According to these data, the 

averages of sample temperature, pH, salinity, and conductivity during 

summer and winter, were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05), while the 
mean dissolved oxygen for each point of collection during the summer 

and winter was statistically significant among points of collection 

(P?0.01).  



80 

Regarding the sediment analysis, the averages of the total solids, 

fixed solids, volatile solids and humidity of the samples were not 

statistically significant among the points of collection either in the 

summer or winter periods (P&gt;0.05), as shown in Table 2. As we can 

observe on Fig. 15, the percent of dissolved oxygen at each point was 

different but this difference during summer and winter was not 

statistically significant (P&gt;0.01).

3.2 Viral recovery assay for water and sediment samples  

The HAdV recovery rate, as determined by FONGARO et al., (2013) 

using qPCR (GC units), was approximately 10% (total of 8 × 105 

GC/mL) for water samples. For sediment experiment; the recovery of 

MNV was 7.7% (total of 2.02 × 10
8
 GC/mL) for sediment and 68% 

(total of 1.77 × 10

 GC/mL) for sediment and 87% for MilliQ water (total of 2.3 

× 10
9
 GC/mL) using the beef extract method described by 

KATZENELSON et al., (1976). For RV-SA11 the recovery using 

Glycine/PEG method was 46% (total of 3.7 × 10
6
 GC/mL) for sediment 

and 70% (total of 5.6 × 10
6
 GC/mL) for MilliQ water, while using the 

beef extract method was 0.06% (total of 5.3 × 10

 GC/mL) for sediment 

and 68% (total of 5.4 × 10
6
 GC/mL) for MilliQ water as shown in Fig. 

16.

undamaged viruses were infectious by plaque assay. The mean results 

for HAdV GC for each point were statistically significant for both the 

summer and winter collections (P&lt;0.05), as shown in Fig. 17 (a,b).  
For sediment samples collected in the summer, the HAdV incidence

GC GC-DNAse treatment PFU

 

The difference between the total genome and the intact HAdV was 

statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) in all cases. The log difference was 

performed by: [log10 (GCtotal/GCundamaged)]. The general mean of the log 

difference in surface water samples during summer and winter was 

0.81±0.56 and in sediment samples was 1.27±1.59, as shown in Fig. 18. 

This log reduction was calculated using the following formula: log10 

reduction = log10 (GCt/GCu), where GCt is the total number of HAdV 
particles (GC/L) and GCu is the number of undamaged HAdV particles 

(GC/L) (P&lt;0.05).

RVA-sediment samples HAV-water samplesRVA-water samples

 
The overall mean percentages of enteric viruses detected in our study 

in surface water and sediment samples from summer and winter 

collections showed that HAdV was the most frequently detected enteric 

virus, followed by RVA and then HAV, as shown in Table 3.  
 

 

 

 

 



88 

Table 3: Prevalence of HAdV, RVA, and HAV in surface water (wat.) and 

sediment (sed.) samples for each point of collection during the summer and 

winter seasons. 

 

 
 

As shown in Fig. 20, the overall mean percentages regarding the 

seasonal occurrence of the three viruses’ shows that RVA was more 

frequently detected in both surface water and sediment during the winter 

season. In contrast, the frequency of HAV detected in summer samples 

was higher than in winter samples, but only for surface water. HAdV 

was the most prevalent virus during summer and winter and showed no 

difference in seasonal prevalence. However, the seasonal distributions of 

these viruses were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05).

CHAPTER II 

 

1. INTRODUCTION  
This chapter will present and discuss the results obtained during the 

second year of collection (2014) from the water sources (Peri Lagoon) 

and different depths of water column by real time PCR and also by cell 

culture technique for the detection of the human viruses and somatic 

coliphages. Two liters (2 L each) of water and 20 g of fluffy sediment 

samples were collected monthly in each of the pre-selected locations as 

further described. These results are under revision in International 

Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1 Description of study area 

As described before in Chapter ? Peri Lagoon is fed mainly by two 

waterfalls:  Cachoeira Grande and Ribeirão Grande; this Lagoon is 

widely used for recreational activities (swimming and fishing) and 

stands out for participating in the System East-Coast-South Water 

Treatment Plant, supplying about 110,000 inhabitants of Florianópolis 

in the districts of Barra da Lagoa, Lagoa da Conceição, Campeche, 

Morro das Pedras, Armação and Ribeirão da Ilha.  

 

2.2 Sampling 
Due to its importance we selected four points in Peri Lagoon for 

water and sediment sampling collections as collection sites 1) located at 

the center of Lagoon and this site was composed by 4 collection points 

of water samples [surface water (100% light penetration), 0.9 meter in 

deep (10% light penetration), 5.5 m in deep (1% light penetration), 8 m 

in deep (0% light penetration)], and one sediment sample as shown in 

Fig. 22; site 2) located in waterfalls Cachoeira Grande as shown in Fig. 

23; site 3) located in waterfalls Ribeirão Grande as shown in Fig. 24; 

site 4) located in the beach of Lagoon as shown in Fig. 25;. Surface 

water and sediment samples were collected monthly from January 2014 

until December 2014, 7 water samples (include: 4 samples collected 

from surface water in different sites and 3 water samples collected from 

different depth of water column), and 4 sediment samples / collection, 

totaling 132 water and sediment samples). As shown in Fig. 21. 

Sediment samples were collected using Petersen grab samplers as 

mentioned before in Chapter ?. 

Note: The collection of the samples at Peri Lagoon were possible 

due to a partnership established with Continental Water Ecology 

Laboratory from UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina), 

coordinated by Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello Petrucio, who we thank very 

much for this important collaboration.

2.3 Evaluation of physical-chemical parameters and nutrients for 

water samples 
The evaluations of the physical-chemical parameters were taken in 

four micro-environments (MAs) of Peri Lagoon. For this, in each 

collection, the following physical-chemical parameters were assessed in 

situ by means of Multiparameter probe (YSI-85): water temperature 

(TA), conductivity (Cond.), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). For the 

analyzes of nutrients were done only for samples taken from site 1 

(center of Lagoon), water samples from each collection site, were taken 

to the laboratory to determine the amount of nitrite (N.NO2-) 

(GOLTERMAN et al., 1978), nitrate (N.NO3-) (MACKERETH et al., 

1978), ammonia (N.NH4 +) (KOROLEFF, 1976) and for phosphorus 

(these analyzes were carried out in partnership with the Laboratory of 

Continental Water Ecology, Department of Ecology and Zoology at 

Federal University of Santa Catarina, under the coordination of Prof. Dr. 

Mauricio Mello Petrucio). 

 

2.4 Coliphage propagation 

Typified strains of somatic coliphages used as positive controls in 

this study:  PhiX174 (Microviridae), phages and their respective 
bacterial hosts were provided by Prof. Dr. Maria Elisa Magri (UFSC, 

Dept. of Environmental and Sanitary Engineering). 



95 

 

2.5 Detection and enumeration of Bacteriophage somatic 

coliphage in surface water and sediment samples 

Bacteriophages were quantified by a double agar layer technique 

following the ISO 10705-2 standard (ISO 2000) for enumeration of 

somatic coliphages (SOMCPH). The volume of water tested for each 

phage was 10 mL. The detection limit (DL) as detected by serial dilution 

for somatic coliphage was 10 PFU/100 mL. E. coli ATCC 13706 was 

used as the host for somatic coliphage detection according to ISO/FDIS 

10705-2. Briefly, the water samples were filtered through a cellulose 

ester membrane filter, with 0.22 µm pore size and 47 mm diameter. In 

case of sediment samples, they were diluted first with peptone water 

(1:10) and then filtered through a cellulose ester membrane filter. E. coli 

C strain ATCC 13706 were grown in modified Scholten’s broth (MSB) 

was used in the quantification of somatic coliphages. To each culture 

tube, 1 mL of the original water sample (diluted in case of sediment) 

was added to 1 mL of inoculum culture and 2.5 mL of semi solid 

Modified Scholtens Agar (ssMSA) heated at 47°C. The solution was 

mixed carefully avoiding the formation of air bubbles and poured on a 

layer of complete solid Modified Scholtens Agar (MSA) prepared 

previously in a 9 cm Petri dish pre-warmed at room temperature. After 

solidification on a horizontal, cool surface, the plates were incubated 

upside-down at 36±2 ºC for 18±2 h. The results were expressed in 

PFU/L. 

 

2.6 Viral Concentration 

2.6.1 Water samples 

Viral concentrations in the surface water samples were performed 

using the protocol described by KATAYAMA et al., (2002) as 

described in chapter ?. 

 

2.6.2 Sediment samples 
Viral concentrations in the sediment samples were performed 

according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 1992) 

guidelines, with minor modifications as described by SCHLINDWEIN 

et al. (2010) as described in chapter ?. 

 

 

 

 

 



96 

2.7 Extraction of viral nucleic acids 

 Nucleic acid extractions were performed using a QIAmp MinElute 

Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions as 

described in in chapter ?. 

 

2.8 Quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) 
Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as described in 

Chapter ? and according to HERNROTH et al., (2002); JOTHIKUMAR 

et al., (2005); and ZENG et al., (2008) for amplification of HAdV, HAV 

and RVA. 

 

2.9 Statistical analyses 

To evaluate the possible correlation between viral detection in 

samples from each point of collection, a Pearson correlation and linear 

regression test, a two way ANOVA test and a Student’s t test were 

performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (USA); data were considered 

statistically significant at a P-value ? 0.05. 

 

3. RESULTS 

3.1 Evaluation of physical-chemical parameters and nutrients 

Surface water samples from the Peri Lagoon area were assessed 

monthly over a year, for the following physical-chemical parameters: 

water temperature, conductivity [Cond.], pH and dissolved oxygen [DO] 

and nutrients for site 1, Center of Peri Lagoon [Ortho-Phosphate, Total 

Phosphate, nitrite (N.NO2-), nitrate (N.NO3-), ammonia (N.NH4 +), and 

total Nitrogen (TN).  

The means of the physical-chemical parameters measured for all 

samples from each collection point along one year collections are 

presented in Table 4 and as shown in Fig. 26 (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and 

j) and in Fig. 27 (a, b, c, and d).  

According to the complete analysis of these parameters, no one 

showed any significant spatial or temporal variation, except DO. For 

this parameter,  in the collections of site 1 at different depths, DO was 

correlated positively among each point at different depths [surface 

water, 0.9 meter in deep, 5.5 m in deep, 8 m in deep] and this correlation 

was statistically significant (P?0.0001) (Pearson test-ANOVA).

3.2 Detection and enumeration of somatic coliphages in water and 

sediment samples 
Along one year of collection, 84 water samples and 48 sediment 

samples were collected monthly at Peri Lagoon. Infectious somatic 

coliphages were detected in 43% (36/84); while in sediment samples 

only 18.75% (9/48), contained infectious somatic coliphage and it was 

clear from the results that somatic coliphages were prevalent in winter 
and spring as shown in Fig. 28 (a, b) and Fig. 29.

3.3 Detection of HAdV genome copies in water and sediment 

samples  

A sum of 84 water samples and 48 sediment samples were analyzed 

for the presence and quantification of HAdV genomes and divided as 

following: for water samples, 48 were collected in the center of Lagoon 

(site 1) divided by 12 samples for each depths ([surface], [0.9 meter], 

[5.5 meters], [8 meters]), 12 water samples were collected in site 2 

(Cachoeira Grande), 12 water samples were collected in site 3 (Ribeirão 

Grande), and 12 water samples were collected in site 4 (beach of Peri 

Lagoon). HAdV GC was detected in 64.3% (54/84) of the samples. For 

sediment samples a total of 48 sediment samples were analyzed for the 

presence and quantification of HAdV genomes and divided as 

following: 12 samples were collected monthly in the center of Peri 

Lagoon (site 1), 12 samples were collected in site 2 (Cachoeira Grande), 

12 samples were collected in site 3 (Ribeirão Grande), and 12 samples 

were collected in site 4 (beach of Peri Lagoon). HAdV GC was detected 

in 47.9% (23/48) as presented in details in Table 5, which summarizes 

the results obtained by quantitation of HAdV present in the collected 

samples, monitored for one year. The values correspond to the range of 

the number of genomic copies per liter of water (minimum and 

maximum values), as well as the overall average of viral genome copies 

in each collection site.

Table 5: HAdV genomic copies in water samples collected during one year of 

collection (minimum and maximum with the medium). 

 

 
 

As showed in Figure 30 (a, b, and c), which presented the complete 

profile of HAdV as detected in water and sediment samples at each 

point of collection during one year (2014) where the percentage of 

HAdV GC in the collected water samples was: site 1 point 1 (surface 

water), 75% (9/12); from site 1 with different depth (0.9 m), 58.3% 

(7/12); from site 1 (5.5m), 66.7% (8/12); from site 1 (8 m), 50% (6/12); 

For sediment samples collected from the same site 1, 58.3 % (7/12); 

water samples collected from site 2, 66.7% (8/12) sediment samples 

collected in this site 2, 33.3% (4/12); water samples collected from site 

3, 58.3% (7/12) sediment samples, 50% (6/12) ; water samples collected 

from site 4, 75% (9/12) and sediment samples, 50% (6/12).

A positive correlation between HAdV and HAV was noted in all 

depths of water column. Number of detection times for each virus 

(HAdV, RVA, HAV, and SOMCPH) over one year surveillance at 

different depths of water column was completely different as shown in 

Fig. 34. Also average concentrations of HAdV, RVA, HAV, and

3.6 Seasonal variation for HAdV, RVA, HAV, and SOMCPH  
The overall mean percentages for the seasonal occurrence of the four 

viruses showed that these viruses have a seasonal trend where HAdV 

and HAV were more frequent in summer (81% and 52%, respectively) 

in water samples. Regarding to sediment samples, HAdV was also 

prevalent (66% for HAdV) while HAV was not detected in all sediment 

samples. Contrary, RVA and SOMCPH were more frequent during 

winter (62% and 76%, respectively) in water and (33% and 25%, 

respectively) in sediment, respectively. HAdV was the most prevalent 



109 

 

virus detected in our study. However, the seasonal distributions of these 

viruses were not statistically significant (Student’s t-test, P&gt; 0.05) as 

shown in Fig. 35.

3.7 Correlation of physical-chemical parameters with presence of 

HAdV 
Physical-chemical data (temperature, pH, DO and cond.) for all point 

of collection and nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, phosphorus, ammonia, 

nitrogen, and total phosphate) for site 1 of collections of Peri Lagoon, 

were submitted to the t-test , two-way ANOVA and correlation Pearson 

test with the HAdV. By applying t-test we found that there are no 

correlation between any of physical-chemical parameters with the 

presence of HAdV GC (P&gt;0.05) (Pearson test-ANOVA) (r ranged from 

0.01 to 0.3). 

 

3.8 Correlation of SOMCPH with presence of HAdV 
Presence of SOMCPH and HAdV in either water or sediment 

samples for all sites was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) by using 

Tow way-ANOVA test. Also by applying Pearson correlation test for 
these results we found that, there is no positive correlation between the 

presence of SOMCPH and HAdV (either for genome or infectious units) 

(r = -0.23).

4. DISCUSSION OF CHAPTERS ? and ?? 

Waterborne viral infections are among important causes of human 

morbidity, and related diseases continue to pose public health threat and 

socioeconomic implications worldwide. According to existing reports in 

the literature, there are hundreds of different types of human viruses 

present in human sewage, which can become a source of contamination 

of drinking and recreational water. In many countries, water quality is 

evaluated according to bacteriological standards, even though bacterial 

contamination is not correlated with the presence of human enteric 

viruses and other pathogens (FONG et al., 2005). 

Most of waterborne diseases are due to unsafe water supply and 

inadequate sanitation. Drinking and recreational water are the main 

ways of human viral contamination, which can be responsible for 

multiples diseases. Water-related human pathogenic viruses include 

HAdV, HNoV, rotaviruses, astroviruses, HAV and HEV (BOFILL-

MAS et al., 2013). Drinking and recreational waters, such as swimming 

pools and seawater are also contaminated and outbreaks of HAdV 

infection are frequently described in day care centers, hospitals and 

other public places (MENA; GERBA, 2008). 

Coastal lagoons are important environments for water suppliers and 

sanitation processes and are considered an important contributor to 

underground water. Contamination of lagoons with enteric viruses due 

to the illegal discharge of domestic sewage represents a significant risk 

to public health (MORESCO et al., 2012; ASLAN et al., 2011). In this 

study, we investigated the presence of human viral pollution (in the 

form of HAdV, RVA and HAV) in surface water and sediment over two 

year period (2013, 2014) in order to investigate the role of sediments as 

reservoirs for these pathogens and also to see the possible influence of 

seasonality in the presence of these viruses.  

Real-time PCR was applied to quantify the presence of HAdV. 

HAdV proved to be the most prevalent virus in this study during the two 

years of collection, both in surface water and sediment samples with an 

indicated peak in summer collections. 

These results corroborated with other studies, which found that 

HAdV is the most prevalent virus in different environmental matrices; 

HAdV was detected in 75% of lagoon water samples tested by 

RIGOTTO et al., (2010) using nested PCR. Additionally, other studies 

have reported the high incidence of HAdV in different aquatic 

environments (HUNDESA et al., 2006; CHOO; KIM, 2006; 

MIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; MORESCO et al., 2012; FONGARO et 

al., 2012 and 2013). The lower number of HAdV positive sediment 



111 

 

samples may be due to some obstacles in the method for viral elution in 

these matrices. These methods can interfere with the enzymatic 

amplification of the nucleic acids in these samples due the presence of 

inhibitors (such as humic acids, proteins, organic and inorganic 

compounds) that inhibit amplification of the viral genome target (SANO 

et al., 2003; ALBINANA-GIMENEZ et al., 2009; SIDHU; TOZE, 

2009; ROCK et al., 2010). 

However, for the positive sediment samples, the number of HAdV 

particles (GC) was two or three logs higher than in water samples 

(chapter ?), while the number of HAdV particles (GC) was one or two 

logs higher than in water samples (chapter ??). However this difference 

in logs may be due to that Sangradouro River has an illegal dumping of 

sewage, from surrounded population. HAdV tends to adsorb onto the 

suspended particles due to its high sorption capacity and its size, which 

has an effect on the interaction processes with the environmental 

colloidal particles (DOWD et al., 1998; WONG et al., 2013).  

Detection of infectious viruses in environmental samples requires the 

use of adequate susceptible cell lines in which the viruses can propagate 

and produce cytopathic effects (CPE) (RODRÍGUEZ et al., 2009). As 

the presence of the viral genome does not provide information on 

infectivity, a viability assay was performed to detect the infectious 

HAdV particles in the samples containing HAdV nucleic acid. 

 In Sangradouro River (chapter ?), the majority of HAdV positive 

samples from the summer collection did contain infectious particles, but 

any infectious units were detected neither in the surface water nor in 

sediment samples from the winter collection from the collection of the 

first year (2013). The degradation of the viral particles may be due to 

various factors, such as pH or U.V. light incidence, in addition to other 

environmental components, such as the presence of proteases, (such as 

RNAses, and DNAses), which can influence the resistance and 

inactivation of viruses in aquatic environments by causing 

conformational changes in the viral capsid (WARD et al., 1986; 

BATTIGELLI et al., 1993; CARTER, 2005, FONG; LIPP, 2005, CHOI; 

JIANG, 2005, FONGARO et al., 2013). The infectivity test is important 

when quantitative microbial risk assessment is the goal. To assess 

possible damages to the HAdV capsid, which results in a lack of 

protection for the nucleic acids, the DNAse pre-treatment of samples 

prior to nucleic acid extraction was applied to all samples analyzed in 

the present work. Previous studies have reported this enzymatic 

technique as a simple alternative technique to give inferences about 



112 

potential viral infectivity without using laborious cell culture techniques 

(RODRÍGUEZ et al., 2009; VIANCELLI et al., 2012; FONGARO et 

al., 2013). 

This assay allows for differentiation of undamaged viruses (with 

protected genomes) from damaged viruses (with unprotected genomes) 

or even free viral genomes. This assay nevertheless is unable to 

differentiate inactivated virus with genetic material that is still protected 

by viral capsid (RODRÍGUEZ et al., 2009; FONGARO et al., 2013).  

This limitation was proved in this work, because not all samples 

containing undamaged HAdV as detected by qPCR were infectious by 

plaque assay. The notable differences among these results highlight the 

critical importance of combining, whenever possible, molecular and cell 

culture techniques during the monitoring of viruses in the aquatic 

environment.  

In Peri Lagoon (chapter ??) HAdV was found to be more prevalent in 

water and sediment samples (64%, and 48%, respectively) than other 

enteric viruses detected by qPCR in different aquatic matrices (water 

and sediment). High diversity of HAdV in water samples was 

documented recently by OGORZALY et al., (2015) by using a Next-

Generation Amplicon Sequencing (NGS) Approach. This virus proved 

to be prevalent in the water samples collected during the first one year 

of monitoring with an indicated peak in summer collections which 

coincides with summer holiday period and a high increasement of the 

fluctuant population. These results corroborated with other studies from 

our and other groups (GENTHE et al., 1995; WONG et al., 2009; 

RIGOTTO et al., 2010; MORESCO et al., 2012; FONGARO et al., 

2012; GARCIA et al., 2012). The viral load in water samples ranged 

from 10
5
 GC/L to 10

7
 GC/L. The detection frequency found in the 

present study was nearly equal in comparison to previous studies related 

to surface water: done by FONGARO et al., (2012) (10
6
 to 10

8
 GC/L), 

and by GARCIA et al., (2012) (average of 10
7
 GC/L). However, other 

studies reported viral loads lower in 2 or 3 logs from those presented 

here in surface water: YE et al., (2012) (10
2
–10

4
 GC/L), CHOI and 

JIANG (2005) (10
2
–10

4
 GC/L), HARAMOTO et al., (2010) (10

3
–10

5
 

GC/L), JURZIK et al., (2010) (10
3
–10

5
 GC/L). 

In Peri Lagoon (chapter ??), a higher positivity of infectious HAdV 

was noted in sediment samples than in water samples (83% and 76%, 

respectively). The viral load for HAdV was almost the same in both 

matrices (water and sediment) ranging from 10
2
 to 10

4
 PFU/L and 10

2
 to 

10
3 

PFU/Kg, respectively. HAdV load detected by STAGGEMEIER et 

al., (2015) was 3 times higher in sediment samples than in water and this 



113 

 

difference may be due to the detection technique used (ICC-RT-qPCR) 

which is more sensitive than plaque assay and able to detect HAdV as 

low as 1?×?10
2
 genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in 

the environmental water samples according to FONGARO et al., (2013) 

and this reinforce the idea about the combining of molecular and cell 

culture technique during the monitoring of viruses in the aquatic 

environment to maintain a reliable result for public health. 

HAdV have been indicated as potential marker of viral 

contamination in water (CALGUA et al., 2008; BOSCH et al., 2011; 

WYN-JONES et al., 2011; WYER et al., 2012) since this virus has 

DNA genome, which confers more resistance to environmental 

stressors, such as UV radiation, temperature, chlorine concentration and 

pH variation, including sewage treatment procedures 

(LECHEVALLIER; AU, 2004; FONG; LIPP, 2005), moreover, HAdV 

were found to be more prevalent than other enteric viruses (WONG et 

al., 2009; WYN-JONES et al., 2011; GARCIA et al., 2012, FONGARO 

et al., 2012; MORESCO et al., 2012). 

On the other hand, there are several candidate viral indicators to 

predict virus contamination in environmental waters. Several studies 

indicate that bacteriophages could serve as viral indicator for estimating 

enteric viruses in water (HAVELAAR, 1993). Three groups of 

bacteriophages have been proposed as potential viral indicators for 

estimating sewage contamination and human enteric viruses in water 

based on their similarities to human enteric viruses in morphology, 

nucleic acid composition, sources and occurrence in contaminated 

water: F-specific RNA coliphage, phages of Bacteroides fragilis, and 

somatic coliphages. 

In chapter ??, we investigated the presence of somatic coliphages in 

water and sediments over one year monitoring, to see the possible 

influence of seasonality in the presence of these viruses and also to 

show a possible correlation between them (somatic coliphage and DNA 

&amp;amp; RNA viruses in this study).  

In our study (chapter ??), somatic coliphage proved to be prevalent 

during the winter and spring seasons along one year of collection and it 

was completely absent during the summer season. This may be due to 

the concentration of environmental phage populations. Several authors 

have unsuccessfully tried to isolate phages through direct methods, and 

others, although occasionally successful, but did not publish their 

findings (ACKERMANN, 1997). 



114 

All of the positive samples for somatic coliphages by double agar 

layer method showed to be positive for the presence of E. coli. However 

there is no positive correlation was found between human adenoviruses 

quantified by real-time PCR or by plaque assay and culturable 

coliphages, indicating that the detected adenoviruses might be originated 

by human feces and respiratory secretions while coliphages might be 

generated by other natural sources such as birds, animal feces, and/or 

regrowth in nutrient-rich soil (DESMARAIS et al., 2002). Our data 

confirm findings from other studies made in different regions of the 

world; JIANG et al., (2001) reported the presence of HAdV (by nested 

PCR) and culturable coliphages in coastal waters of Southern California 

in four site of collection and they noted that the presence of human 

adenovirus was not significantly correlated with the concentration of 

coliphage; GRIFFIN et al., (1999), detected human enteric virus 

(polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A 

viruses, Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses) in 95% of 

samples collected from Florida coastal water by PCR whereas a few or 

no coliphage was detected in their samples; while CHUNG et al., (1998) 

reported a significant association of F-specific phage with human enteric 

viruses in oysters and their harvest waters. By using real time PCR, 

CHOI; JIANG (2005) made a study on two urban rivers in California 

and JURZIK et al., (2010) made a study on river Ruher, Germany and 

they found no significant correlations between HAdV and culturable 

coliphages. 

The RVA was present in 33% of water and 19% of sediment samples 

collected in Peri Lagoon and 33.2% of water and 10.4% of sediment 

samples collected in Sangradouro River, suggesting a cross 

contamination with human sewage in both environments. Rotavirus is 

the most common cause of severe diarrheal diseases in infants and 

young children worldwide causing &gt; 600,000 deaths each year under 5 

years of age and can be shedding in high concentration in the feces of 

infected persons (&gt;10
10 

virus particle/g) with a small infectious dose 

&lt;100 virus particles. Many studies demonstrated a high prevalence of 

RV in different matrices as following, in the sewage: MELEG et al., 

(2008) (91%); RODRIGUEZ-DIAZ et al., (2009) (67%), FUMIAN et 

al., (2010 and 2011) (47%, 100%); in the river contaminated with 

sewage: RODRIGUEZ-DIAZ et al., (2009)(83%); in stream waters: 

MIAGOSTOVICH et al., (2008) (44%); in the surface water of river and 

lagoon: HAMZA et al., (2009) (90%), JURZIK et al., 2010 (64%), 

FONGARO et al., (2012) (65%),and in fluffy sediment: RAO et al., 

(1986) (40%). 



115 

 

However, the low incidence of these RNA viruses in sediment 

samples may be due to their weak absorption on sediment particles or 

due to their quick inactivation in sediments. Previous studies that 

reported the incidence of rotavirus in sediments done by CHUNG; 

SOBSEY (1993) and GREEN; LEWIS (1999) also demonstrated a low 

incidence (12.5%) and suggested that the viral adsorption to sediment 

may inactivate this virus. However, these authors reported a high 

incidence of HAV in sediment samples contaminated by wastewater 

(87.5%). Other studies regarding HAV incidence in Brazil have also 

shown a low incidence in environmental samples (RIGOTTO et al., 

2010).  

In Brazil, attenuated G1P[8] vaccine, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline, 

Rixensart, Belgium), was included in the Immunization Program since 

2006 (FUMIAN et al., 2011). However a recent study done by 

GUERRA et al., (2015) noted that G2P[4] was the predominant RV 

strain circulating in Belém, Brazil and detected in 57.2% of circulating 

strains over their whole study period (three years) which suggests a shift 

in genotype distribution since 2006 (CARVALHO-COSTA et al., 2009, 

GUERRA et al., 2015). These data make the continuous RV genotyping 

monitoring is needed for discovering others shifting. 

Other reports demonstrated a low incidence of HAV in different 

environmental samples in lagoon water:  RIGOTTO et al., (2010) 

(17%), FONGARO et al., (2012) (12%); in sewage: FORMIGA-

CRUZ et al., (2005) (20%); in raw and treated sewage in Brazil: 

VILLAR et al., (2007) (32%). However in one study done at the Buffalo 

River, South Africa by CHIGOR; OKON (2012), HAV was the most 

prevalent detected viruses with 43% of positivity. Our results suggested 

that there is a possible contamination route via human sewage for Peri 

Lagoon (the present studied area) or even this contamination can be due 

to recreational activities such as bathing in these areas during vacation 

period. Moreover, no samples have been found positive for HAV in 

sediments.  

The detection and quantification of enteric viruses in matrices 

reported in these chapters support the idea related to solid-associated 

viruses and its importance to take in consideration during a routine 

monitoring of the aquatic environment to reduce the risk of illness from 

enteric viruses. Many authors in the literature found that viral abundance 

in sediment exceeds that in the water column by an order of magnitude 

(DANOVARO et al., 2002; DANOVARO; MIDDELBOE, 2010). Also 

Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlations between the 



116 

physicochemical parameters with the presence of these viruses and these 

finding were confirmed by other reports in the literature (LEE et al., 

2013; VECCHIA et al., 2015). 

The high prevalence of HAdV in the surface water and sediment 

samples along two years of monitoring indicates that there was no 

seasonal difference. So, the prevalence of HAdVs is ubiquitous in the 

environment all year round, a result that has been confirmed by other 

studies done by FORMIGA-CRUZ et al., (2005) and RIGOTTO et al., 

(2010). This high incidence may be due to the high stability of HAdV in 

the aquatic environment and its sporadic shedding in the faeces of most 

adults (WYN-JONES et al., 2009). Regarding somatic coliphage we 

noted a higher incidence during winter months along our study in the 

second year of collections.  

RVA showed a marked winter seasonal peak in water (45.5% in 

[chapter ?], 62% [chapter ??]) as well as sediment samples (12.5% 

[chapter ?], 33% [chapter ??] ), which has also been reported in previous 

studies (COOK et al., 1990; LEVY et al., 2009; PAYNE et al., 2011, 

CHIGOR; OKOH, 2012). Some authors had demonstrated higher levels 

of RVA during the cold, drier months (STEELE; GLASS, 2011), while 

others suggested that this seasonal pattern may vary according to the 

RVA serotype (SARKAR et al., 2008; JAGAI et al., 2012). 

However, the seasonal prevalence of these viruses was not 

statistically significant. In the present study, HAV displayed a higher 

incidence during the summer (45.8% [chapter ?], 52% [chapter ??]). 

However, CHIGOR; OKOH, (2012) reported higher detection of HAV 

in South Africa during the winter and spring seasons (43%). Another 

study performed in Brazil by RIGOTTO et al., (2010) documented a 

seasonal pattern for HAV during the spring and winter seasons, with a 

high incidence during the months of October and July. Another study 

done in Rio de Janeiro by VILLAR et al., (2002) reported a peak of 

HAV incidence during hot and rainy months. However, we must take 

into consideration the fact that many cases are underreported and others 

are asymptomatic.  
Distribution of aquatic microbial organisms in the water column can 

be varied depending of varies factors such as: their velocity of settling 

and wind, suspended solids in water column, presence of anaerobic or 

aerobic predators and also for the intensity of natural sunlight through 

the water column. HAdV was detected in the present study in the 

surface water and in all depths of water column (0.9m, 5.5m, and 8m), 

this may be due to nucleic acid nature of this virus that increase 

its resistance to various environmental factors such as UV radiation and 



117 

 

temperature which are known to cause conformational changes in the 

viral capsid (SIRIKANCHANA et al., 2008; EISCHEID et al., 2009). 

While RVA, HAV, and somatic coliphage were shown to have a high 

increase with depth from the surface towards while they have a slightly 

presence in the surface water of the centre of Peri lagoon. Therefore, the 

lagoon centre deep offers stable environments for some microbial life 

throughout water layers. While the other three collections sites in the 

present study we could see this difference because of maximum deep is 

around 1.5m. The vertical patterns observed in this study for the 

detected enteric viruses imply that throughout the depths of water 

column the loss of these pathogens should be low because of the 

darkness and lower temperature (MURRAY; JACKSON 1993; HARA 

et al., 1996; COLOMBET et al., 2006). However, there is no 

information available in the literature about the presence and 

distributions of enteric viruses throughout different depths of water 

column. But these results forced us to make a prospective study using 

different microcosm seeded artificially by different enteric viruses in 

different realistic exposure conditions for natural sunlight and dark 

condition.

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 

-The results showed that in the Island of Florianopolis, recreational 

waters and lagoons, which are the main resources for drinking water, are 

being contaminated by enteric viruses, either by sewage runoff or by its 

streams and interconnections.  

 

-This study highlighted the importance of HAdV as viral indicator 

parameter in addition to bacteriological parameters in the monitoring of 

recreational water microbiologically. Also RV, HAV, HAdV and 

SOMCPH should be indexed for human fecal pollution in estuarine 

sediments as the only refuge of solid associated viruses, 

 

- SOMCPH in our study, did not shown a good performance as  

indicator for the presence of viral contamination in water samples,  

 

-The results highlighted the importance of evaluating the ecosystem 

interconnections of Sangradouro River in order to enhance the safety of 

water as a drinking and recreational resource in this environment. This 

water may otherwise pose a threat to the population that is mainly 

responsible for the degradation of its quality in this lagoon and 

neighborhood.  

 

-The HAdV integrity test by enzymatic treatment (DNAse I) is a less 

laborious method than cell culture technique and proved to be feasible to 

detect potentially infectious viral particles; 

 

-The sediments also proved to act as shelter for enteric viruses, 

increasing their concentrations and being responsible for the return of 

these pathogens to the water column when resuspended.

CHAPTER III 
 

STABILITY OF HUMAN ADENOVIRUS AND MURINE 

NOROVIRUS IN WATER AND SEDIMENT SAMPLES USING 

LABORATORY MICROCOSM SCALE 

 

 

 

 

 

 



132 

CHAPTER I?? 

 

1. INTRODUCTION  
This chapter will present and discuss the results of HAdV and MNV-

1 stability in laboratory scale microcosms kept under two conditions: 

natural condition receiving natural sun light and full dark condition. To 

prepare the microcosms we used surface water and sediment samples 

catched at Peri Lagoon.  

 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1 Collection of samples 
Surface water and sediment samples were collected at the center of 

Peri Lagoon (site 1 as described in Chapter ??), Florianopolis, Santa 

Catarina State, Brazil (July, 2014). 

 

2.2 Physical-chemical analysis 
Water temperature (WT), conductivity (Cond), pH, and dissolved 

oxygen (DO) were measured in situ with specific probes (WTW-

Multi350i) for all of samples after collection, as outlined in the standard 

methods for the examination of water and wastewater described by the 

American Public Health Association (APHA, 1998). Water samples 

were taken to the laboratory to quantify Ortho-Phosphate (PO4), Total 

Phosphate (TP), Nitrite (NO2.N), nitrate (NO3.N), ammonium nitrogen 

(NH4.N), and total Nitrogen (TN) were determined in filtered water 

samples using a Millipore AP40–47 mm glass fiber (GOLTERMAN et 

al., 1978; KOROLEFF, 1976) (these analyzes were carried out in 

partnership with the Laboratory of Continental Water Ecology, 

Department of Ecology and Zoology at the Federal University of Santa 

Catarina, under the coordination of Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello Petrucio). 

 

 

2.3 Recombinant Adenovirus as a model for DNA enteric viruses  
Recombinant human adenovirus (rHAdV) which was used in this 

chapter is related to serotype 5 but has some modification in its genome 

region. E1 gene (E1A and E1B) was removed and replaced by the gene 

of green fluorescent protein (GFP). HEK 293A (cell line of human 

embryonic kidney) was genetically transformed to express the viral 

protein E1 as shown in Fig. 36, thereby this cell line is susceptible and 

permissive to rAdV. Therefore when rAdV replicate, GFP is transcribed 

along with the virus genome emitting a green fluorescence that can be 

easily detected by fluorescence microscope (DAN et al., 2010; 



133 

 

WEAVER; KADAN, 2000). By using this model of recombinant 

adenovirus, there is no need for further immunologic methods making 

this model more rapid, inexpensive, and more specific (LI, HE, JIANG, 

2010). However in the literature there are few studies related to the 

stability and infectivity of HAdV in the aquatic environment using 

rHAdV. (GARCIA et al., 2015; NASCIMENTO, et al., 2015).

2.4 Cell lines and preparation of viral stock of rHAdV, and MNV-1 

for seeding experiment in water and sediment samples  
The cell lines HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and RAW 264-7 

(Mus musculus, mouse macrophages), permissive to rHAdV and MNV-

1, respectively were used for the experiments. Both were cultivated in 

sterile cell culture flasks (75cm
2
), with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential 

Medium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal 

bovine serum (FBS) and 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence (24 

h, 37 ºC, and 5% CO2). Then the growth media was removed and 1.0 

mL for each viral suspension was inoculated separately in each cell 
culture flask. After 1h for viral adsorption at 37°C, 20 mL of cell 

maintenance media were added consisting of the same growth medium, 

but with 2% FBS. Cell cultures were always monitored and compared 

with an uninfected control cell for checking the appearance of 



134 

cytopathic effect (CPE). In case of rHAdV, the cells were monitored 

every day, and observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope 

which allowed the visualization of cells with green fluorescence (GFP) 

due to transcription and translation of GFP protein, which means viral 

replication. In case of MNV-1, the cells were observed under inverted 

microscope until reach 100% of cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized 

by rounded cells and even detachment from the surface, destroying the 

cell monolayer. 

The cell culture flasks that contain infected cells with rHAdV or 

MNV-1 were then frozen at -80 °C and thawed at 25°C three times for 

cell lysis. Then, the virus suspension was transferred, separately to a 

tube and centrifuged at 3,500 ?g for 4 min. at 4°C to remove the cells 

debris and separate the supernatant. The supernatants were then used to 

infect other flasks with the appropriated cells in order to expand the 

amount of virus stocks to be used for the further experiments.   

 

2.5 Cytotoxicity assay  

The cytotoxicity of surface water and sediment samples were 

evaluated either on HEK 293 or in RAW 264-7 cells. These cells were 

propagated in sterile 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10
5
 and 1× 10

6
 

cells per well, respectively. Surface water and sediment samples were 

pretreated with 1% antibiotic/antifungal (100 U penicillin G / mL / 

streptomycin 100 ?g /mL amphotericin B 0.25 ?g /mL) and diluted in 

1X DMEM in the following proportions: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8. An inoculum 

of 100 ?L of each dilution in triplicate was placed in contact with each 

type of tested cells for 1h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere and 

uniform mixing every 15 min. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed 

and 1 mL of DMEM containing 1% PSA was added to the cells, two cell 

controls were maintained for each plate and these cells contained only 

medium. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 

the cells monolayer was monitored for 3 days in case of RAW 264-7 

cells and only one day in case of HEK 293. 

Cells containing inoculated test samples were compared with control 

cell under a light microscope. Sequentially, cells were fixed and stained 

with 300?L of Naphthalene Black solution (0.1% Naphthalene Black, 

5% Acetic Acid, pH 2.3-2.4). The cell monolayer was stained and 

examined for the non-cytotoxic dilution, for each of tested samples in 

order to be further used for infectivity assays. 

 

 



135 

 

2.6 Monitoring the infectivity of rHAdV in surface water and 

sediment samples by Fluorescence microscopy (FM) 

These cells were previously cultivated in 48-well tissue culture plates 

at a density of 2.5 × 10
5
 cells / well, with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential 

Medium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS 

and 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence and were incubated at 

37°C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then 100 µL viral fluids as a positive 

control or sample were tested using non-cytotoxic dilutions. The 

samples were serially diluted (10 fold) previously as following: for viral 

fluid 50 µL viruses were diluted in 450 µL of DMEM 1X until 10
-5

. 

Regarding the samples, 50 µL were diluted with 450 µL of 1X DMEM 

with 1% PSA and serially diluted until 10
-5

. In the cell control wells 

(negative control) was added only DMEM 1X. After 1h at 37°C under 

5% CO2, 0.4 mL of maintenance medium was added per well (1X 

DMEM, 2% FBS, 1% HEPES and 1% PSA) to 48 plate wells. After 24 

h the cell supernatant was aspirated and the plate was visualized directly 

under inverted fluorescence microscope. The number of fluorescent 

cells in the highest possible dilution was counted and the viral titer 

expressed in focus forming units (FFU/mL) according to the following 

formula: 

 

 N. of fluorescence cell (average of triplicate) x Reciprocal 

dilution 

 

Volume of inoculum in each well (mL) 

The detection limit of the technique was established according to the 

highest dilution where it was possible to count the infected cells. 

 

2.7 Study of the infectivity of MNV-1 in surface water and sediment 

samples by plaque assay 

These cells were previously cultivated in 6-well tissue culture plates 

at a density of 1 × 10
6
 cells / well, with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential 

Medium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal 

bovine serum (FBS) and 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence and 

were incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. The plaque assay for the 

MNV-1 was based on the protocol described by BAE; SCHWAB, 

(2008). Briefly, 400 µL of viral fluid or sample in non-cytotoxic dilution 
were inoculated and incubated for viral adsorption as described above.  

The inoculum was removed and added the cell culture maintenance (2x 

MEM), diluted in melted agarose 3% (SeaPlaque Agarose low melting 

point, Lonza, CA, USA) in order to prevent the virus from spreading, 



136 

limiting the infection only to neighboring cells that were primarily 

infected. Cells were incubated for 48h at 37°C. After this period, 1.0 mL 

of a 0.1% solution of neutral red dye was overlaid on the agarose layer, 

which enabled the visualization of lysis plaques and its count after 3h as 

shown in Fig. 37 (a, b). The number of plaque units in the highest 

possible dilution was counted and the viral titer expressed in plaque 

forming units (PFU/mL) defined by the following formula:  

 

 N. of plaques (average of duplicate) x Reciprocal 

dilution 

 

Volume of inoculum in each well (mL) 

The technique detection limit was established according to the 

highest dilution where it can perform plate count.

2.8 Microcosm design and sampling 
Experiments were set-up in microcosms in a glass container 

(NADER-Brazil, 50 mL) filled with a sediment layer of 5 cm and an 

overlying water column of 5 cm as shown in Fig. 38. The microcosms 

were stored in two conditions: i) Dark environment (24 h dark); ii) 

Natural environment (+/-12 h of natural sunlight/+/-12 h of dark moon 

light). The microcosms were kept until 85 days starting at 19, September 

2014 and finishing at 13, December 2014. Microcosms were sampled in 

triplicates at period’s intervals for up to 85 days as shown in Fig. 38. 

Also triplicate samples were taken for each microcosm. Infectivity 

studies were undertaken with rAdV, and MNV-1 and the tests were 

revealed by fluorescence microscopy and plaque assay, respectively.

2.9 Inoculation of microcosms 

Stock viral suspensions were prepared as mentioned before either for 

rHADV (2 × 10
7
 FFU/mL) or MNV-1 (5 × 10

6
 PFU/mL). One milliliter 

from each viral stock was inoculated in each microcosm jointly and 

mixed during 5 min for homogenization and 1h for proper settling. Then 

half numbers of the microcosms were placed in dark condition (24 h) 

and the other half were placed in natural condition (+/-12 h of natural 

sunlight/+/-12 h of dark moon light). Three microcosms were used to 

determine the initial titer of inoculated viruses before start the 

experiment, 1 h after inoculation. 

Both sediment and water from the microcosm were analyzed on days 

0 (1 h after initial inoculation), 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, 70 and 85 days. Three 

microcosms were removed per time point with triplicate samples 

assayed from each as shown in Fig. 39. 

For each analysis, overlying water was removed and going directly 

for analysis with non-cytotoxic dilution. While sediment samples were 

obtained by first removing the remaining overlying water and going for 

elution step as already described. Temperature was taken for each 

collection sample during the experiments. 

The decay rate constant (k), that means, the decrease in viral 

concentration over time, was calculated as the slope of the line when 

log10 (Nt / N0) was regressed against time, where Nt is the number of 

each virus at time t and N0 is the number of virus at time 24 h The decay 



138 

rate constant value (k) could then be used to calculate T90 value, which 

are the times required for a 1 log10 reduction in viral concentration.

2.10 Direct elution of viruses from sediment samples 
After removal of water samples from each microcosm, the sediment 

was gently diluted in 20 mL of modified Eagle's minimal essential 

medium (E-MEM) (pH=11.5) as described by STAGGEMEIER et al., 

(2014). The solution was homogenized by vigorous agitation (vortex) 

for 1 h and then centrifuged at 2.000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant 

was then used for further investigation. In case of water samples, they 

were used directly without any concentration or elution methods. Also 

all water and sediment samples that were collected from Peri Lagoon 

were concentrated as described in Chapter ? to assess the presence or 

absence of HAdV genome copies by qPCR before starting the set-up of 

the microcosms. 

 

2.11 Statistical analyses and modelling 
All analyses were undertaken in triplicate and expressed as the mean 

± standard deviation. Slopes of the lines from linear regression (The 

time for a decimal reduction of viruses, T90) were calculated considering 

linear regression curves, using Microsoft Excel. Statistical two-way

analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to evaluate differences 

between viruses concentrations in the overlaying water compared with 

the sediment layer for microcosm experiments. The Pearson correlation 

was applied to evaluate positive or negative correlations between viral 

infectivity and light or dark condition (GraphPad Prism 5.0). The critical 

P-value for the test was set at&amp;lt;0.05.

3.3 Cytotoxicity assay for water and sediment sample using RAW 

264-7 and HEK 293 
This assay was performed to assess the non-cytotoxic lowest dilution 

for all samples types used in microcosm. Water and sediment samples 

(after elution method as described above) were diluted serially and 

inoculated on cell lines. Dilution 1:4 either for water or sediment 

samples showed no morphological changes in cell lines when compared 

to the control cell (only cell and medium). Thus this dilution (1:4) was 

the minimum dilution which was used in all samples inoculated in cell 

lines during microcosm experiments. 

 

3.4 Infectivity reductions in human viruses 

3.4.1 Recombinant Human Adenovirus (rHAdV) 

The time course of decay in natural system for rHAdV are shown in 

Fig. 40 (a), where, as expected, effect of temperature and natural UV 

light on viral stabilities was observed. Temperature index along the 

laboratory scale microcosm was measured as shown in Fig. 41. After 15 

days, rHAdV lost its infectivity in about 2.2 log10 (2.13 × 10
2
 FFU/mL) 

in overlaying water, about 2.6 log10 (4 × 10
2
 FFU/mL) in sediment, after 

30 days we could not detect any fluorescent cells in both matrices (water 

and sediment).   

In dark system, for sediment, rHAdV decay rates were lower and 

decreased along the time course. We could detect infected fluorescent 

cells until 70 days with a log reduction of about 2.8 log10 (2.7× 10
2
 

FFU/mL) for sediment. While in overlaying water column, the viral 

reduction was 2.5 logs10 (1.2× 10
2
 FFU/mL) after 60 days; after 70 days 

we could not detect any fluorescent cells (below of detection limit). The 

log10 reduction values were taken based on virus concentration detected 

after 24 h of settling process for virus after inoculation as shown in Fig. 

40 (b).

3.4.2 Murine norovirus (MNV-1) 

The time course of decay in natural environment for MNV-1 is 

shown in Fig. 42 (a). After 15 days, MNV-1 infectivity lost about 3 

logs10 (7.5× 10
1
 PFU/mL and 5.9× 10

1
 PFU/mL) either in water or 

sediment, respectively. After 30 days, we could not detect more 

infectious units by plaque assay in both matrices. These results pointed 

to the effect of temperature and natural U.V. light on viral stability and 

infectivity. 

In dark system, in water column we could detect an average of 1.4 × 

10
3
 PFU/mL of MNV-1 (about 1.7 log10 reduction) after 30 days and the 

infectivity was lost completely after 60 days. Contrary, MNV-1 was 

detected in the sediment along the time course of experiment until only 

70 days with logs reduction of about 2.7 log10. The log reduction values 



143 

 

were analyzed based on virus concentration detected after 24 h of 

settling process for virus after inoculation as shown in Fig. 42 (b).

To estimate the required time to inactivate 90% of virus (T90) in 

water and sediment either in natural or full dark environment, the 

obtained results from microcosms were adjusted. Linear regression was 

used for modeling (Microsoft Excel) as shown in Table 8. 

All experiments exhibited a similar pattern of rHAdV viral settling 

over the initial 24 h after direct inoculation (P&lt;0.05) as shown in Fig. 
43. However, we could not note a clear settling for MNV-1 in both 

matrices as shown in Table (9).

3.5 Sunlight effect on virus inactivation 

From our results, it was confirmed that, under natural condition, 

there was a decay effect on viral stability and infectivity for both studied 

DNA and RNA viruses (rHAdV, and MNV-1), T90-natural condition 

(predicted number of days to achieve a 1-log10 reduction) for rHAdV 

and MNV-1 were 7.7 and 6.7 days, respectively in water matrices. In 

sediment, T90-natural condition was 7 and 6.4 days, respectively. 

Contrary, T90-full dark condition for rHAdV and MNV-1 in water 

column was 20.9 and 12, respectively. While in sediment, T90-full dark 

condition was 22.7 days for rHAdV as shown in Fig. 44 (a, b), and 18.6 
days for MNV-1 as shown in Fig. 45 (a, b). Linear regression was used 

for modeling (Microsoft Excel, 2010) as shown in Table 8.

4. DISCUSSION 

This study examined the decay of two types of enteric viruses’ 

rHAdV, and MNV-1 in dark and natural condition. Over 85 days of 

microcosms sampling period, we monitored the decay rate for two types 

of viruses rHAdV and MNV-1 (representing DNA and RNA genomes 

enteric viruses) that had been artificially inoculated with different initial 

concentrations at the same volume (1mL): 2 × 10
7 

FFU/mL and 5 × 10
6
 

PFU/mL for rHAdV and MNV-1, respectively. For rHAdV, all 

experiments exhibited a similar pattern of settling over the initial 24 h 

after direct inoculation; while for MNV-1 the settling process was not 

uniform. This difference may reflect the intrinsic differences between 

adsorption processes for DNA and RNA viruses which rely on many 

factors such as size and shape of virus, surface charge and hydrophobic 

interactions, which may lead to variation in settling velocities and/or 

association with sediment particles (Wong et al., 2012). 

Our results using microcosms, illustrated the extended persistence of 

viruses in sediments compared with overlaying water column in dark 

conditions. In the natural conditions, after the initial peak of settling, the 

concentration of rHAdV in the water and sediment decreased 

dramatically in a relatively short period of time 15 days which decreased 

by 2.2 and 2.6 orders of magnitude, respectively. After 30 days we 

could not detect more rHAdV infectious particles, since the FFU for 

rHAdV was below the limit of detection until the end of the experiment 

using fluorescence microscope. 

The same happened for MNV-1 which decreased about 3 orders of 

magnitude after 15 days. After 30 days we also could not detect more 

MNV-1 infectious particles where PFU for MNV-1 was below the limit 

of detection until the end of the experiment using plaque assay. 

However, in dark conditions, a similar time course of viral decay has 

been observed for rHAdV and MNV either in water or sediment 

samples, where infectious particles for rHAdV was detected until 60 and 

75 days in water and sediment, respectively with log10 reduction 

decreased by 2.5 and 2.8 orders of magnitude in tested matrices, 

respectively. The FFU for rHAdV was no longer detectable after 70 and 

85 days either in overlaying water or sediment, respectively. However, 

the reduction in infectivity of rHAdV reached 4.5 and 5.2 log10 in 70 

and 85 days in both matrices (water and sediment), respectively. 

While infectious particles for MNV-1 was detected only until 30 and 

75 days in water and sediment, respectively. This decreased was 1.7 and 

2.7 orders of magnitude in tested matrices, respectively. The MNV-1 

PFU was no longer detectable after 60 days in water and after 85 days in 



149 

 

sediment where the reduction of infectivity of MNV-1 reached 4.8 log10 

in each of them. 

 It is well known that viruses with a DNA double-stranded genome 

are more stable than those whose genome are RNA single-stranded like 

MNV-1 (ESPINOSA et al., 2008).  However, the stability of MNV-1 

which is ss-RNA, nonenveloped norovirus was comparable with 

stability of rAdV in current study (until 15 days of collection). A study 

done by KATPALLY et al., (2008), has reported that MNV may 

undergo a capsid maturation process, where the mature state may be 

more stable, which may account the stability of  MNV-1 in the present 

study until 15 days in overlaying water and sediment samples with only 

0.4 log10 reduction. Many studies in the literature are described 

regarding the stability of enteric viruses in different aquatic environment 

with conflicting results. Ground water: OGORZALY et al., (2010) they 

detected adenoviruses-2 throughout 120 days, the reduction of 

infectivity reached 2.4 log10 (T90=35days) and 0.7 log10 (T90=132days) 

at 20°C and 4°C (controlled temperature), respectively.  CHARLES et 

al., (2009) they realized a rapid decrease in the infectivity of AdV-2 in a 

laboratory scale microcosm (4.2 log10 over the initial 21 days) during 2 

years studies were undertaken on spiked groundwater at 12ºC 

nevertheless, they also observed that infectious HAdV-2 could still be 

detected over a total 364-day period (2 years). These differences with 

our results may be due to type of collection sample where OGORZALY 

and CHARLES depend on their studies on in situ groundwater 
microcosms, which considered to have a more stable composition and a 

higher microbial quality than those of surface waters that we used in the 

current study (Peri Lagoon-laboratory scale microcosm) and also due to 

the slow filtration of the water through different layers of soil and 

sediments, removing pathogenic microorganisms and many chemical 

compounds in case of ground water. 

ENRIQUEZ et al., (1995), detected infectious HAdV serotypes 41 

and 40 in artificially seeded tap, primary and secondary wastewater 

effluents that were kept in a Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 

incubator at either 4 or 15°C. In the case of tap water held at 4°C, after 

55 days, the HAdV 41 and HAdV 40 lost nearly 0.5 and 1.0 log10, 

respectively, with an estimated T99 value of 304 and 92 days for HAdV 

41 and HAdV 40, In contrast, at 15°C, these agents lost almost 2 log10 at 

the same period. In primary wastewater, after 50 days at 4°C, HAdV 41 

and HAdV 40 diminished about 2 and 2.5 log10 with an estimated T99 

value of 44 and 48 days for HAdV 41 and HAdV 40. While at 15°C, 2.6 



150 

and 2.8 log10 for HAdV 41 and HAdV 40 with an estimated T99 value of 

40 and 43 days for each respectively. In secondary sewage at 4°C for 50 

days, the enteric adenoviruses 41 and 40 lost nearly 1.9 and 2.2 log10, 

respectively with an estimated T99 value of 47 and 58 days. However, at 

15°C after 60 days, these agents (HAdV 41 and HAdV 40) lost almost 

2.9 and 2.4 log10, respectively with an estimated T99 value of 45 and 43 

days. Although, we believed that the viral survival studies in the 

literature are difficult to compare, as they are carried out under different 

conditions. 

In general, the decay rates (K) for rHAdV observed in microcosms 

(containing overlaying water and sediment) that were exposed to 

sunlight in the natural condition (k =0.129 &amp;amp; 0.142; T90= 7.7 &amp;amp; 7 days, 

resepectively) was higher than that observed in microcosms in the dark 

condition (k =0.046 and 0.018; T90= 20.9 &amp;amp; 22.7 days) for water and 
sediment, respectively. The same was observed for MNV-1, where 

decay rates (K) in natural condition for water and sediment (k =0.151 &amp;amp; 
0.157; T90=6.7 &amp;amp; 6.4 days, respectively) was higher than that observed 

in case of dark condition (k =0.089 &amp;amp; 0.05; T90=12 &amp;amp; 18.6 days). One 

possibility is that there is an interaction of temperature and U.V. 

sunlight leading to an increased rate of degradation in the open 

environment. 

These results highlight the effect of sun light and direct temperature 

on the inactivation of these viruses in overlaying water and sediment. In 

this study we noticed that the decay rate for both viruses (rHAdV, and 

MNV-1) was rapid in the natural condition due to high temperatures 

noted along the experiment that occurred from September, 2014 to 

December, 2014. The results of this study corroborate with another 

previous study done by SIDHU; TOZE (2012), where they detect the 

decay rate for adenovirus in a laboratory microcosms established using 

50-mL sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes and incubated in the dark 

at 20°C in a refrigerated incubator using a groundwater samples, they 

noted a fastest rate of inactivation (k =0·047/day; T90=21) of seeded 
adenovirus in the laboratory microcosms. 

A study done by WATTS et al., (1995), reported the photocatalytic 

inactivation for survival of poliovirus 1 in secondary wastewater 

effluent using Batch reactors consisted of Pyrex glass dish. They 

concluded that the time required for two-log inactivation of poliovirus 1 

was approximately 30 min under laboratory lights and sunlight. 

According to DAVIES-COLLEY et al., (1999) there are three 

independent mechanisms involved in sunlight-induced virus 

inactivation: direct photobiological damage, exogenous photooxidation 



151 

 

and endogenous photooxidation all of these mechanisms are catalyzed 

by photosensitizer (substances that initiate or catalyze photochemical 

reactions). 

Natural organic matter (NOM) may act as a protective agent for 

viruses in the overlaying water, by which viruses can be adsorbed on it 

and also by attenuating the effect of natural sunlight by absorbing 

shorter wavelength (KELBLE et al., 2005). However SUN et al., (2016) 

showed that the presence of Natural organic matter in the aquatic 

matrices (NOM) may play a role on enhancing viral inactivation 

depending on its composition and concentration in the matrices. NOM is 

natural photosensitizer in surface waters which can contribute in the 

production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), However HAdV has the 

ability of DNA repair after damaged but this later (ROS) could damage 

the HAdV capsid protein without the possibility to repair (CANONICA 

et al., 1995; SILVERMAN et al., 2013). 

However, it should be taken in consideration that, unlike in the 

current study using microcosms as a model considers only dark and 

natural light effect, the natural environment is not static and many 

factors such as turbidity because of suspended solids associated with 

storm water events and winds, concentration of microorganisms and 

tidal movement, all of these factor may significantly reduce the 

penetration of U.V. sunlight exposure in overlaying water and will 

influence in microorganism decay rate. Our finding agreed with another 

study done by PEDLEY et al., 2006 which demonstrated that the 

stability of infectivity in viruses is known to be greater in specific 

conditions: low temperatures, no light and limited predatory 

populations. Regarding to the microbiota, WETZ et al., (2004) 

demonstrated the poliovirus survival rate in unfiltered and filtered 

seawater, where they noted that poliovirus survive more in filtered water 

than in unfiltered water. 

Though, nature of samples is an important issue that could influence 

the activity of the indigenous micro-organisms, and their virucidal 

activity as well as production of ROS, which ultimately influence decay 

rates of enteric virus independently of natural sunlight effect.

5. CONCLUSION 

 

-In general, these results showed that the prolonged survival of viruses 

in overlaying water and sediment in specific conditions, proved by 

infectivity assays, can indicate a health hazard, 

 

-The presence and persistence of these viruses in sediment layer 

(particularly in sediments consisting of small particle size and high 

organic carbon as detected in this study) may indicate an increased risk 

of infection because of the persistence and possible resuspension of 

these pathogens during natural turbulence or human activity, 

 

-The results indicated that natural UV sunlight (UVA/visible light) 

could directly cause virus inactivation.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
 

1- Analysis of water and sediment samples from the Peri Lagoon and 

Sangradouro River revealed that this region is under anthropogenic 

impact of human sewage discharge, and there is a possible 

contamination even by the human sewage or by the normal human 

activities in this area. This contamination poses a threat to the 

population because the Peri Lagoon is the only water source used by 

CASAN to supply drinking water for local population, 

 

2- It was clear from this work that sediment plays an important role as a 

reservoir for viruses with high concentrations, 

 

3-  The lack of studies related to detection and survival of enteric viruses 

in sediments make this work relevant to push the decision makers to 

consider combined analyses of water and sediments for reliable public 

health risk analysis of recreational and lagoon waters, 

 

4- None of the physical-chemical parameters showed sufficiently 

consistent significant correlations with the presence or infectivity of 

viruses,  

 

5- Due the wide distribution of HAdV in water and sediment samples 

during our study along two year of surveillance, we can easily say that 

HAdV should be viewed as an index for the presence of human enteric 

viruses and other human faecal pollution for better protection to the 

public health, 

 

6- Somatic coliphage showed no positive correlation with the presence 

of other enteric viruses either in water or sediment samples, so we can 

say that it is not a good indicator or surrogate for the presence of  enteric 

viruses in the aquatic ecosystem, 

 

7- Infectivity assay for these viruses (HAdV in present study) must be 

addressed for a good and comparable estimation of the risk associated to 

the consumption of contaminated water and food irrigated with 

contaminated water, 

 

8- It was clear, from the laboratory scale microcosm, that the persistence 
of these infectious viruses are prolonged in the aquatic environment,

9- Also our study supports the idea about the photodegradation of 

viruses either adsorbed to sediment particle or suspended in the 

overlaying water column. However, the dark condition in deep water 

can play an important role in the prolonged infectivity of these viruses 

in the aquatic environment, 

 

10- At all, transmission of these human enteric viruses is linked directly 

to insufficient treatment of sewage waste by wastewater treatment 

facilities so it must be taken in consideration.

PROSPECTS 

The results obtained from the present study provided an important focus 

on the fate of these pathogens in the aquatic environment especially in 

sediment as a main refuge for these pathogens based on the processes of 

virus-solid adsorption and settling. Also, the importance of U.V. 

sunlight as an alternative method for disinfection of these pathogens in 

water in addition to chlorine, ozone and other traditional methods.
