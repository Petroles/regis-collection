Abstract 

Compelling evidence on environmental and species distribution changes due to global 

climate change have greatly increased over the last decades and extreme events like 

marine heatwaves (MHWs) (concurrent high temperature and low nutrient)  are 

increasing in frequency, duration and intensity. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) 

C.A. Agardh forms dense marine forests serving as a foundation species in ecosystems 

that are of great ecological and economic importance. Thus, the objective of this study 

was to test for evidence of local adaptation to conditions representative of MHWs stress 

in the field on a regional level, encompassing areas with different oceanographic regimes 

and genetic groups. Adult blades from two depths and four regions of the Northeast 

Pacific were exposed to simulated nutrient and thermal stress conditions. The results 

clearly showed that M. pyrifera populations at the southernmost limit displayed greater 

thermal tolerance in their photosynthetic physiology. Compared to the other regions, 

surface blades from the South suffered reduced impact on the photosynthetic apparatus, 

with Fv/Fm values at 24ºC 15.5% higher than the regional mean. Thermally-sensitive 

parameters governed mainly by enzymatic processes (rETRmax and Ek) were unaffected 

over the 15 - 24ºC range in the southernmost region, suggesting adaptation to local 

environmental conditions. Amongst the bottom blades collected at depth, photosynthetic 

responses to stress were rather similar among different regions. The F1 juvenile 

generation grown in vitro from parental source material did not exhibit a significant 

reductions in Fv/Fm under the moderate stress temperature used (21ºC), but rETRmax and 

Ek remained significantly higher in the Southern regions. Consistently poor 

photosynthetic responses to thermal stress were observed in the North-Center region 

(Santa Barbara) in all experiments, suggesting genetically-based fitness reduction. Our 

results also highlighted the need for further research on the synergistic effects of low 

nutrients availability and high thermal stress considering different life stages of M. 

pyrifera.  

 

Key-words: Giant kelp, foundation species, climate change, thermal stress, local 

adaptation 

 

 

 



 

 

Resumo 

 

Evidências científicas de alterações no ambiente e distribuição de espécies devido a 

mudanças climáticas de caracter global, tem aumentado largamente nas últimas décadas. 

Eventos como as ondas de calor marinhas, têm aumentado a sua frequência (em cerca de 

38%), duração e intensidade, ameaçando vários ecossistemas marinhos como recifes de 

coral, pradarias marinhas e florestas marinhas, assim com espécies de grande relevância 

económica. Espécies como as lagostas e as amêijoas foram afetadas através da redução 

do habitat e por stress térmico, o que resultou num aumento da mortalidade, na redução 

do tamanho dos indivíduos e da sua taxa de reprodução. 

O Kelp gigante, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh é o kelp com maior distribuição 

nos oceanos que forma extensas florestas marinhas, com uma canópia densa na superfície 

resultando numa grande produção primária a qual alimenta diretamente organismos 

herbívoros mas maioritariamente detritívoros. Devido a sua densidade e dimensão, as 

florestas de M. pyrifera são capazes de alterar as condições ambientas locais, 

nomeadamente reduzindo correntes e luz, criando um habitat heterogéneo, abrigando um 

grande número de espécies. Assim, funciona como uma espécie fundadora do ecossistema 

apresentando grande relevância ecológica e económica.  

A fotossíntese é influenciada pela temperatura que regula as taxas de reações e 

movimentos de solutos dentro das células das algas tendo sido utilizada com sucesso 

noutros estudos, para quantificar o efeito de aumento de temperatura em kelps. Um dos 

métodos mais comuns para medir respostas fotossintéticas em eco-fisiologia é o 

fluorómetro (PAM), pois é capaz de determinar eficientemente as taxas fotossintéticas 

em laboratório e também no campo. 

A utilização de técnicas de deteção remota como boias e satélites em estudos 

oceanográficos, permite obter dados a uma grande escala e com grande regularidade 

possibilitando a análise de padrões e fatores relevantes como por exemplo oscilações da 

temperatura da superfície do mar (SST) ou movimentos da camada de gelo polar. Esta 

técnica pode também ser utilizada para gravar eventos a uma escala temporal mais curta, 

como blooms de fitoplâncton e processos de afloramento costeiro. Dado que a macroalga 

M. pyrifera forma uma canópia densa à superfície da água do mar, a utilização de dados 

de satélite (capazes de detetar a fluorescência da Clorofila a). Esta ferramenta tornou-se 



 

 

essencial na análise da distribuição, padrões sazonais de crescimento e correlação das 

florestas de kelp gigante com fenómenos ambientais como furacões ou eventos como o 

El Niño. A análise de climatologias, resumos de uma ou mais variáveis (SST ou Clorofila 

a) em escalas temporais grandes, utiliza modelos de fluxos atmosféricos e oceanográficos 

com enormes bases de dados e capacidade de processamento dos mesmos (como por 

exemplo o sistema de reanalise de dados oceanográficos ORAS4). Estes aumentam a 

quantidade e qualidade dos dados utilizáveis para estudar os fatores ambientais que 

afetam a espécie em estudo e permitem a criação de cenários de hipotéticos de alterações 

na distribuição destas espécies. 

 O objetivo deste estudo foi procurar evidências de adaptação local a condições 

representativas de stress relacionado com ondas de calor marinhas (temperaturas altas e 

baixa concentração de nutrientes) a um nível regional numa área que engloba regimes 

oceanografias diferentes, assim como diferentes grupos genéticos.  

Em 2015, lâminas de M. pyrifera adultas amostradas a duas profundidades e provenientes 

de quatro regiões do Pacifico Noroeste foram expostas a um gradiente de água do mar a 

3 temperaturas (15, 20 e 24ºC) e nutrientes (meio não enriquecido e enriquecido com 

Provasoli (PES)) replicados (x3), simulando condições similares fenómenos com o El 

Niño. Tanques de 30L contendo água do mar filtrada foram equipados com termostatos 

para regular a temperatura, bombas de circulação de água e aparelhos de registo de 

temperatura para registar o seu perfil. As condições de cultura foram: salinidade a 35ppm, 

ciclos de 14:10 luz:escuro a 80 ?E· m-2·s-1 e os tratamentos com adição de nutrientes 

foram enriquecidos com 20 mL·L-1 PES. 

Os resultados das experiências revelaram, com grande expressividade, que as populações 

de kelp gigante do limite sul da distribuição geográfica no hemisfério norte, expressavam 

na sua resposta fotossintética uma maior tolerância ao stress. Comparada com as outras 

regiões, as lâminas da superfície da região Sul, demonstraram uma menor perturbação no 

aparelho fotossintético com os valores do parâmetro Fv/Fm 15.5% superiores à média 

regional, nos tratamentos a 24ºC. Também na região Sul, os parâmetros relacionados com 

os processos fotossintéticos de enzimas termo sensíveis (rETRmax e Ek) foram mais 

elevados a 24ºC comparativamente com os tratamentos a 20ºC, o que não sucedeu nas 

outras regiões. Nas lâminas amostradas junto ao fundo, as repostas fotossintéticas ao 

stress apresentaram maior semelhança entre regiões. Esporófitos juvenis crescidos em 



 

 

laboratório, a partir do tecido reprodutivo recolhido nas mesmas populações amostradas 

para as lâminas adultas, não exibiram uma redução significativa do parâmetro Fv/Fm, 

provavelmente devido à temperatura máxima utilizada (21ºC) a qual não foi 

suficientemente alta para causar stress térmico. No entanto, os parâmetros rETRmax e Ek 

foram significativamente mais altos na região Sul. A região Norte-Centro (Santa Barbara, 

Califórnia) revelou os níveis mais baixos de resposta fotossintética ao stress em todas as 

experiências, incluindo nos esporófitos F1. Este facto aponta para uma possível redução 

de fitness devido a fatores genéticos. Os nossos resultados realçam também a necessidade 

de futuras investigações nos efeitos sinérgicos de baixa disponibilidade de nutrientes, 

associada a elevadas temperaturas considerando diferentes etapas no ciclo de vida de M. 

pyrifera.

Introduction 

Temperature is a major physical factor that defines the biogeographic distribution of species 

in the marine environment (Adey &amp;amp; Steneck, 2001; Poloczanska et al., 2007; Wernberg et 

al., 2016). Species range distributions are usually associated with a center where conditions 

are optimal and the edges where those conditions are no longer met (Lomolino et al., 2006). 

Thermal limits occur where organisms can no longer tolerate continuous temperature 

conditions in the environment or their fluctuations (Garrabou et al., 2009; Mohring et al., 

2014). While temperature change across the latitudinal range can be broadly contiguous, 

environmental factors such movement of air masses, ocean currents, hurricanes, upwelling 

and internal waves provide extreme complexity to the marine environment resulting in great 

spatial (from meters to hundreds of kilometers) and temporal (from hours to decades) thermal 

variability (Adey &amp;amp; Steneck, 2001).  

Compelling evidence on environmental and species distribution changes due to global 

climate change have greatly increased over the last decades (Selig et al., 2010; Wernberg et 

al., 2012a; Rosenzweig &amp;amp; Neofotis, 2013; Caputi et al., 2015). In a decadal review of 

scientific experiments related to climate change on marine organisms, Wernberg et al., 

(2012b) found that virtually all experiments showed significant effects of stress related to 

increased temperatures. The frequency of high seawater temperature anomalies on nearshore 

ecosystems has increased 38% (Lima &amp;amp; Wethey, 2012) resulting in a mean temperature 

increase of 0.5-1ºC (Hawkins et al., 2003; Ridgway, 2007). Thus, extreme events like marine 

heatwaves (MHWs) characterized by a sudden significant increase of seawater temperature 

(but see Hobday et al., 2016 for a recent detailed and hierarchical definition) are increasing 

in frequency, duration and intensity (Perkins, 2011; Hobday et al., 2016). Examples of such 

events are the northern Mediterranean Sea marine heat wave (MHW) of 2003 (Garrabou et 

al., 2009) or the 2014 positive temperature anomalies on the NE and equatorial Pacific that 

led to the extreme magnitude of the 2015/16 El Niño (Bond et al., 2015; Levine &amp;amp; Mcphaden, 

2016). MHWs are caused by the interaction of atmospheric and oceanographic processes that 

can encompasses different geographical (local, regional and global) and temporal (seasonal, 

yearly, decadal) scales (Trenberth, 2012; Hobday et al., 2016).

These events are also affecting larger areas of the globe, threatening several marine 

ecosystems and key species (Lima &amp;amp; Wethey, 2012; Wernberg et al., 2012a). Coral reefs are 

among the most sensitive ecosystems to anthropogenic related environmental changes 

(Halpern et al., 2007) and recent extreme MHWs caused extensive bleaching and disease 

(Selig et al., 2010; Smale &amp;amp; Wernberg, 2012b). Seagrass meadows (e.g Posidonia oceanica) 

also responded negatively after the two extreme MHWs events (2003 and 2006) in the 

Mediterranean when shoot mortality rates exceeded recruitment (Marbà &amp;amp; Duarte, 2010). 

Similar results were obtained in a laboratory experiment mimicking an ocean warming 

scenario on the seagrass Zostera noltii, with reduced photosynthetic performance and shoot 

density (Repolho et al., 2017). Species with great economic relevance such as lobsters and 

scallops were also affected by the loss of habitat and direct thermal stress resulting in 

increased mortality, individual size reduction and reproductive rates (Mills et al., 2013; 

Caputi et al., 2015). Kelp forests and fucoid beds have also registered negative effects caused 

by rising seawater temperature events on fundamental processes such as growth, 

reproduction, recruitment and resilience to disturbances  (Ladah &amp;amp; Zertuche-González, 2007; 

Pearson et al., 2009 ; Wernberg et al., 2012a; Nicastro et al., 2013; Jueterbock et al., 2014; 

Mota et al., 2015) 

Photosynthesis is greatly influenced by temperature (Raven &amp;amp; Geider, 1988; Kirk, 2011) 

which regulates the rate of enzymatic reactions and solute movements within algal cells 

(Raven &amp;amp; Geider, 1988; Davison, 1991; Tamburic et al., 2014) and has been successfully 

used to quantify the effects of temperature increase on kelps (Henkel &amp;amp; Hofmann, 2008; 

Wernberg et al., 2010). While low temperatures reduce photosystem 2 (PSII) activity (Baker, 

1991), high temperatures can result in protein denaturation and damage to the membrane 

systems of the photosynthetic apparatus (Daniel et al., 1996). Thus, photosynthesis is often 

used as an indicator for algal stress response to temperature (Hurd et al., 2014). As 

photosynthesis depends on the electron transport rate (ETR) in order to maintain cellular 

redox balance, metabolic homeostasis, and energy production (ATP) for the organism, this 

system is highly conservative in response to environmental (e.g temperature oscillations) and 

physiological changes (McDonald et al., 2011). The other facet of photosynthesis, i.e., the 

Calvin cycle biochemical pathway through which inorganic carbon is fixed, is temperature 

dependent via effects on enzyme activity. Moderate temperature increase may enhance 



3 

 

photosynthesis by increasing maximum rates of enzymatic activity, beyond which further 

temperature increase may reduce the maximum rate (Vmax) and/or substrate affinity (Km) of 

key enzymes such as RuBisCO. Limitation of photosynthetic process by inorganic carbon 

availability, carbonic anhydrase activity, diffusion and active transport of CO2 across the 

chloroplast membrane may also occur at higher non-acclimated temperatures, contributing 

to declining photosynthetic rates (Davison, 1991). 

One of the most commonly used methods to measure photosynthetic responses in 

ecophysiological research is the Pulse Amplified Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, as it can 

efficiently determine photosynthetic rates in laboratory and field conditions (Beer et al., 

1998; Ralph &amp;amp; Gademann, 2005; Roleda et al., 2009; Terada et al., 2016). These instruments 

generally have built-in software routines allowing efficient measurement of the maximum 

quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), or the effective quantum yield of PSII under illumination 

(?PSII). ?PSII together with information on illumination can be used to construct 

photosynthesis-irradiance curves, often as “rapid light curves” (RLCs) when illumination 

steps are given briefly (over several seconds). Declining Fv/Fm  values imply a reduction in 

the maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and therefore disturbance (short term 

photoacclimation) or damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Lichtenthaler et al., 2005).  

RLCs are a powerful tool that provide more detailed information on the maximum electron 

transport rate (ETRmax), while the initial slope (?) of the RLC provides information about the 

relative efficiency of (PSII) photochemistry and the minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) 

reveal the dominance of photochemical quenching (Ralph &amp;amp; Gademann, 2005) and can be 

used as a photoacclimation indicator (Sakshaug et al., 1997).  

The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh is the most widely distributed kelp 

taxon in the oceans, distributed through the northeast and southeast Pacific Ocean, in the 

southwest Atlantic Ocean, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and also around most sub-

Antarctic Islands (Graham et al., 2007)). It has an heteromorphic life cycle in which the 

microscopic haploid gametophyte (male and female) alternates with a micro and macroscopic 

diploid sporophyte (Ladah &amp;amp; Zertuche-González, 2007; Graham &amp;amp; Halpern, 2008). M. 

pyrifera forms dense forests with thick canopy at the water surface where the majority of the 

sporophyte biomass is located (Nyman et al., 1993; Graham et al., 2007), resulting in high 



4 

 

net primary production (NPP) between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass m-2 y-1 (Graham &amp;amp; 

Halpern, 2008). While this productivity feeds secondary production via direct grazing, most 

of this carbon follows the detrital pathway or is exported (Graham, 2004;  Dean et al., 1984). 

Due to their size, density and primary production, M. pyrifera forests are able to modify the 

local environmental conditions providing a heterogeneous habitat which can harbour a high 

number of species (Santelices &amp;amp; Ojeda, 1984; Graham, 2004). Therefore, this species serves 

as a foundation species in ecosystems that are of great ecological and economic importance 

(Lee et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Byrnes et al., 2011). 

Due to the great importance of M. pyrifera as a structuring species in the Northeast Pacific, 

several studies have been conducted in recent years to understand the oceanographic 

processes affecting geographical range and genetic diversity of this species (Alberto et al., 

2010, 2011; Bell et al., 2015; Johansson et al., 2015). Across the broad latitudinal distribution 

of M. pyrifera in the Northeast Pacific, regionally heterogeneous environmental conditions 

raise the hypothesis that populations may be locally adapted. In general, adaptive genetic 

responses to the environment can occur on a time scale of years to hundreds of years (Crispo 

et al., 2010). Examples of local adaptation to warmer and nutrient limited sea-water were 

already described for example in Fucus serratus (Jueterbock et al., 2014); but see Pearson et 

al (2009) for potential mal-adaptation in the same species)  and coral reef endosymbionts 

(Howells et al., 2012). 

The use of remote sensing techniques such as oceanographic buoys and satellite data has 

greatly increased our knowledge of the marine environment as continuous observations allow 

for pattern analysis of relevant factors (e.g. sea surface temperature (SST) oscillations, ice 

shelf movements) and can record short-lived events (e.g. phytoplankton blooms, upwelling 

event) (Joint &amp;amp; Groom, 2000; Paolo et al., 2015). Because M. pyrifera forms dense canopies 

at the water surface where most of the adult sporophyte biomass is located (Nyman et al., 

1993; Graham et al., 2007) remote sensing by satellite data analysis has become a 

fundamental tool to assess kelp forest distribution, seasonal growth and correlation with 

environmental phenomena like hurricanes or El Niño events (North et al., 1993; Graham et 

al., 2007; Cavanaugh et al., 2013). The analysis of climatologies (long-term summary of a 

single or multiple variables (e.g. SST, Chl a), ocean models, atmospheric forcing fluxes and 



5 

 

oceanographic observations by data integration in reanalysis systems (e.g. ocean reanalysis 

system ORAS4) provide improved quality controlled data sets that can be used to assess how 

environmental conditions affect target species and  provide plausible scenarios concerning 

species range distribution shifts (Lee et al., 2009 ; Balmaseda et al., 2013) 

Understanding the physiological responses of M. pyrifera to stress conditions will help to 

predict and possibly minimize reductions in range distribution. Although several studies have 

focused on the response of M. pyrifera to thermal stress (North &amp;amp; Zimmerman, 1984; 

Deyseher &amp;amp; Dean, 1986; Rothausler et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2013) a regional comparison 

between population responses that encompass areas with different oceanographic regimes 

and genetic groups has yet to be performed. 

 

Objectives: 

This study aims to test for evidence of local adaptation to conditions representative of heat 

waves in the field (i.e., concurrent high temperature and low nutrient [inorganic N] stress) in 

populations of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera at its southern limit in the northern 

hemisphere, in a region that encompasses distinct genetic groups and biogeographic thermal 

barriers, by comparing southern limit populations with those near the center of the range. 

This aim is approached by comparing ecophysiological responses of adult blades and F1 

juvenile sporophytes from eight populations representing four distinct genetic regions.

Materials and Methods 

In all tasks, the model used was the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the northeast Pacific 

between Baja California, Mexico and central California, U.S.A., an area covering around 

1300 km of coastline that includes major biogeographic and thermal transition zones (Fig 1).

Common-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1) 

On June 18, 2015, adult M. pyrifera blades were simultaneously sampled by SCUBA diving 

from two populations within each of 4 regions in the northeast Pacific: 1) north (N) (Santa 

Cruz), 2) north-center (NC) (Santa Barbara) - both in the U.S.A, and 3) south-center (SC) 

(Ensenada) and 4) south (S) (Punta Eugenia) in Baja California, Mexico (Fig. 1, see Annex 

I for coordinates). Populations within a region were not very distant, but direct gene flow is 

expected to be low based on gaps in habitat continuity between populations (Alberto et al., 

2010). From each population, 54 blades were sampled from the surface and 54 blades near 

the bottom (at depth 15-20 m). In addition, 10 reproductive blades (sporophylls) were 

sampled for subsequent spore release. Blades were cleaned of epiphytes using paper towels, 

then packed in moistened paper towels and wrapped in aluminum foil. All blades were 

transported to Ensenada in cool-boxes packed with ice for the laboratory experiment and 

arrived within 24 h of collection. Samples from the Ensenada area were collected, prepared 

and stored in a similar way, to avoid transportation effects. Immediately on arrival at the 

laboratory, adult sporophyte blades were acclimated for 24h at 15 ºC in 20 mL·L-1 Provasoli 

seawater (SW) medium (PES; Provasoli, 1968) (Anderson, 2005). 

The experimental design consisted of a replicated (×3) gradient of SW temperatures (15, 20, 

24 ºC) and nutrients (non-enriched or enriched SW with PES SW medium), simulating a 

range of environmental conditions including El Niño (Fig. 2).  

 

 

Figure 2: Experimental design. Acclimation for 24 h (15 ºC, with nutrients) followed by transfer of blades to 3 

replicates of each of 3 temperature treatment (15, 20, 24ºC) with enriched and non-enriched seawater with PES. 

For each treatment condition (temperature and nutrients) a total of 3 blades per population (8 populations) x 2 

depths (surface and bottom) were used.

Tanks containing 30 L filtered SW were equipped with thermostats to regulate temperature, 

pumps for water circulation and temperature loggers to record thermal profiles. Culture 

conditions were 14:10h light:dark cycle, 80 ?E· m-2·s-1 and treatments with nutrients were 

enriched with 20 mL·L-1 PES (Anderson, 2005) at 35 ppm salinity. Blades were placed inside 

large open-mesh (1 cm) bags to allow individual identification throughout the experiment 

while not significantly reducing light and water circulation reaching the blades. Three blades 

per population (and from each depth within that population) were placed in each treatment 

tank. The maximum temperature (24ºC) was selected based on climatology analysis of the 

sites and thermal limits reported on literature (Hernandez-Carmona et al., 2001; Ladah &amp;amp; 

Zertuche-González, 2007; Rothausler et al., 2009) 

The following physiological measurements were taken using a pulse amplified modulated 

(PAM) fluorometer (Diving PAM, Waltz, Germany) during the course of the experiment to 

allow a continuous assessment of the condition and stress responses of the algae: Fv/Fm (the 

maximum yield of photosystem 2 (PSII) photochemistry), and rapid light curves 

(photosynthesis versus irradiance curves from relative electron transport rates [rETR], 

calculated from PSII yield [?F/Fm] at each irradiance level). Fv/Fm measurements and 

observation of blade condition were performed every 24h (starting at 12h) to determine if 

sampling was required due to tissue degradation (at higher temperatures). If so, rapid light 

curves were performed and tissue from each individual blade was sampled for gene 

expression. Tissue samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and later lyophilized in order 

to preserve tissue for RNA extraction. Diving PAM settings for the RLCs were the following: 

light curve intensity (LC-INT = 2), duration of each step (LC-WIDTH = 10seconds) and 

actinity light list for each step (1, 19, 45, 70, 94, 138, 219, 278 and 444). These settings 

allowed a plateau in the rETR curve to be reached (i.e., saturated photosynthesis and in some 

cases photoinhibitory decline at the highest irradiance (Ralph &amp;amp; Gademann, 2005). RLC 

calibration was performed prior to the experiment using separate M. pyrifera blade samples.

Oceanographic data: 

We analyzed local oceanographic features of each region prior to and during the sampling 

event for evaluation in light of the physiological results. Ocean temperature data were 

compiled on a daily basis at two depths (surface and 20 m) for each region. Data were derived 

from the Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis ECMWF ORAP5.0 (1979-2013), which uses a 

3D model (NEMOVAR) with a bias correction scheme that combines satellite data and in 

situ measurements, for a spatial resolution of 0.25 degree x 75 depth levels (Balmaseda et 

al., 2015; Zuo &amp;amp; Balmaseda, 2015; Zuo et al., 2015). Bilinear interpolation was used to 

estimate the temperatures of each sampling site (e.g., Assis et al., 2016).  An anomalously 

warm event (heat wave) was defined similarly to Hobday et al. (2016) as five or more days 

of temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile of a historical baseline climatology, which 

in our study was considered for the period 1993-2015. The climatology was defined relative 

to the time of year, using all data within an 11-day window centered on the time of year from 

which the climatological threshold was calculated. The high percentile threshold (e.g. 90%) 

was used rather than an absolute value above the climatological value as the magnitude of 

variability across a range of timescales varies considerably by region (Hobday et al., 2016). 

 

Effect of blade removal on physiological responses: Comparison of entire individuals vs 

excised blades (Experiment 2) 

In adult Macrocystis pyrifera sporophytes, photosynthesis is mostly performed at the canopy 

surface and the resulting products (mannitol and aminoacids) are translocated downwards to 

the youngest blades, meristems, holdfasts and sporophylls (Schmitz &amp;amp; Grant, 1979). As 

translocation in M. pyrifera is not fully understood, an experiment was designed in order to 

understand if individual responses to thermal stress (i.e. entire individuals, in this case small 

juveniles due to logistic constrains) differ from those of juvenile and adult excised blades. A 

total of 24 juveniles (smaller than 40 cm), 40 juvenile blades and 40 adult bottom blades from 

M. pyrifera sporophytes were collected from the Campo Kennedy population, in the South-

center region. Two temperatures (16 and 24 ºC) and nutrients concentration (non-enriched 

and enriched PES-enriched SW) were used with 2 × replicates per treatment. We used a lower 



10 

 

number of juveniles to minimize any population impact caused by the removal of young 

sporophytes. Culture conditions were replicated from the first experiment (see above) and 

Fv/Fm measurements were taken every 12h using the diving PAM fluorometer using the same 

settings as in the first experiment. 

 

Control of environmental carry-over effects: Comparison of F1 generation juvenile 

sporophytes (Experiment 3) 

A third experiment was designed in order to assess the ecophysiological responses of first 

filial (F1) generation sporophytes to thermal stress given a common growth history in vitro. 

Gametophytes developed from spores released from 10 fertile sporophylls per population 

used in Experiment 1were grown vegetatively in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 4 mL·L-1 

of PES (Anderson, 2005) without iron, 35 ppm salinity, 20 ?E· m-2·s-1 red light (LEE filters, 

#026 bright red) and aeration at 15ºC. 

On February 2017 a gametophyte mass from each population was manually separated into 

the smallest pieces possible using forceps. The fragments were seeded onto a spool of cotton 

filament and left for 2h in air under cool (15ºC) and humid conditions to allow attachment. 

Seeded spools for each population were then placed separately into 20 L tanks with aerated 

seawater (SW) and weekly increasing concentrations of PES (6, 10, 15, 20 mL·L-1) 

containing iron.  Incubations proceeded under white light (20, 40 60 80 ?E· m-2·s-1) and 14:10 

h light:dark cycle. Seawater and tanks were changed/cleaned weekly to maintain optimal 

culture conditions. When sporophytes were ca. 1 cm length they were gently removed from 

the line using forceps and grown detached with aeration (see Westermeier et al., 2006) in the 

same 20 L tanks. When sporophytes reached 6 to 10 cm they were transferred to the 

experimental setup. This constituted a temperature gradient (15, 17, 19 and 21ºC) in PES-

enriched SW, with 3 replicates of 5 sporophytes per final temperature. A 24 h ramp between 

each temperature increase was used to avoid excessive stress on the small juvenile 

sporophytes. All individuals were initially at 15ºC, at 24 h all individuals were transferred to 

17ºC except the 15ºC treatment, and so on up to 21ºC. 



11 

 

Rapid light curves (RCLs) were performed every 24 h for 5 days using a diving PAM. 

Experimental conditions were: 10 L tanks with aeration, SW with 20 mL·L-1 PES with iron, 

80 ?E· m-2·s-1 white light and 14:10 h light:dark cycle. Diving PAM settings for the RLCs 

were adjusted for the lower light conditions in the laboratory: light curve intensity (LC-INT 

= 2), duration of each step (LC-WIDTH = 10 s) and actinity light list for each step (0, 5, 18, 

30, 42, 69, 97, 133 and 195 µmol.m-2.s-1). All individuals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen 

after 120 h. An additional 15 individuals were also flash-frozen at the beginning and another 

15 at the end of the experiment for a transcriptomic baseline. Due to sporophyte growth 

problems in one of the NC populations and no sporophyte recruitment in one of the S 

populations, these two regions only had one replicate population. The 17ºC treatment and the 

NC region at 24 h were removed from the data analysis as temperature fluctuations were 

recorded in the 17ºC culture chamber, resulting in inconsistent ecophysiological responses 

and potentially compromising the data analysis and interpretation. 

 

Statistical analyses of experimental data 

In order to assess ecophysiological responses to temperature and nutrients in M. pyrifera 

from different regions, generalized linear models were used (GLMs; McCullagh &amp;amp; Nelder, 

1989). 

Experiment 1) - Adult blades: Four levels of the factor “Region” (N, NC, SC, and S), three 

levels of the factor “Temperature” (15, 20 and 24ºC), two levels of the factor “Nutrients” 

(PES-enriched and non-enriched SW) and two levels of the factor “Depth” (surface and 

bottom) were used as fixed effects. The response variables were minimum saturating 

irradiance (Ek), maximum potential relative ETR (rETRmax) and the photosynthetic rate in 

light-limited region of RLC (?), and the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm).  All 

parameters were estimated from the rapid light curves (computed with rPackage phytotools 

(Silsbe &amp;amp; Sairah, 2015, CRAN repository), by fitting the model of Platt et al (1980). Analysis 

of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc tests (Tukey Honest Significant differences (HSD)) were 

used to analyze the differences amongst treatments using R software (R Development Core 

Team, 2008). Fv/Fm and ? were square root transformed to approximate residuals to a normal 

distribution.  Since only a short acclimation period was possible, and to minimize any effects 



12 

 

of transportation on physiological responses, data from the RLCs were analyzed at the end 

point of the respective temperature treatments. 

Experiment 2) - Entire individual vs removed blade: ANOVA and post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) 

were used to analyze the difference between treatments using Fv/Fm as the variable for two 

levels of factor “Temperature” (16 and 24ºC), two levels of the factor “Nutrients” (PES-

enriched and non-enriched seawater) and three levels of factor “Tissue” (juvenile, juvenile 

blade and adult blade). Fv/Fm was square rooted transformed and the GLMs fitted using the 

Gaussian family (highest AIC) and resulting residuals were approximate to the normal 

distribution. 

Experiment 3) - F1 generation juvenile sporophytes: Four levels of the factor “Region” (N, 

NC, SC and S), three levels of the factor “Temperature” (15, 19 and 21ºC) and two levels of 

the factor “Nutrients” (PES-enriched and non-enriched SW) were used as fixed effects with 

the response variables ?, Ek, ETRmax (estimated by the Diving PAM software Win-Control 

3, Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) and Fv/Fm. GLMs were fitted using the Gaussian family 

distribution for all variables (selected by AIC comparison with the available distributions for 

R). The variable Fv/Fm was square root transformed and residuals were approximate to the 

normal distribution. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey (HSD) were used to analyze 

the differences amongst treatments using R software (R Development Core Team, 2008). For 

the first and third experiments, we used populations within the same region as a replicate for 

that region.

Results 

 

Common-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1) 

Our results showed that Macrocystis pyrifera blades from all regions performed well at 15ºC 

and 20ºC but were rapidly stressed at 24ºC. At this temperature, more than 88 % of the blades 

had lower mean Fv/Fm values compared with the other treatments. At 24ºC there was tissue 

degradation (e.g. necrotic tissue and loss of pigmentation) and mucilage production. 

Therefore, the experimental treatments at this temperature had to be terminated earlier while 

at the other temperatures the blades remained in culture in good condition. Rapid light curves 

(RLCs) parameters (?, Ek and rETRmax) and Fv/Fm measured at the end point of each 

temperature treatment confirmed that 24ºC treatment rapidly stressed M. pyrifera blades (Fig. 

3). Since no main effect or interactions involving nutrients were detected, non-enriched and 

PES-enriched treatments were combined for the plots in Figure 3.

Figure  3: Maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), photosynthetic rate in light-limited region of RLC (?), 

relative maximum electron transport rate (rETRmax) and minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) mean values (± 

mean standard error) for 3 temperatures (15, 20, 24ºC) and 4 regions (North, North-Center, South-Center and 

South) of adult blades over time. Different letters indicate significant differences among temperatures within 

each region and variable using Tukey HSD. 

 

Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) 

Decreasing values of Fv/Fm can provide a rapid indication of stress affecting PS II in the dark-

adapted state. With Fv/Fm as response variable, ANOVA indicated signification interactions 

due to Region x Temperature, Temperature x Depth and Region x Depth (Table 1). 

The interaction between Region x Temperature revealed significant differences between 

regions in the response to thermal stress: In the N, NC, and SC regions, Fv/Fm was lower at 

24ºC than at either 20ºC or 15ºC (and attributable mainly to stress in surface blades), but in 

the S region significantly lower Fv/Fm was only detected between 24ºC and 15ºC (p = 0.040). 

The region differences were clear when responses at 24ºC between regions at 24ºC were 

considered; Fv/Fm was higher at 24ºC in the S versus either SC or NC regions (p = 9.5 x 10
-5 

and 2.3 x 10-6, respectively), but was marginally insignificant between S and N regions (p = 

0.066).  

Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) indicated that the interaction between Temperature x Depth (i.e., 

surface and bottom blades) was due to greater resilience of Fv/Fm in bottom blades at 20ºC 

and 24ºC (p = 0.001929 and p &amp;lt;0.0001, respectively), while in 15ºC control conditions no 

differences in blade sampling depth were detected (p &gt; 0.25).  

Finally, the interaction between Region x Depth was due to significant contrasts involving 

surface blades between regions; more specifically Fv/Fm in NC surface blades was lower 

overall than in all other regions (NC &amp;lt;N, p = 0.00136; NC &amp;lt;SC, p = 0.00027; NC &amp;lt;S, p = 

8 x 10-7). In addition, bottom blades had significantly greater Fv/Fm than surface blades in the 

N and NC regions, but not in the SC or S (Fig. 3). 

 

 



16 

 

Light-limited photosynthetic rates (?) 

Analysis of ? values revealed a significant interaction between Region x Temperature x 

Depth and post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) highlighted that regional differences regarding the 

response to thermal stress (24ºC) were due to significantly higher ? values on the S region 

surface blades compared to NC and SC regions (p = 7.19 x 10-5 and p = 2.82 x 10-5, 

respectively) as other interactions were non-significant (p &gt; 0.275). The response to thermal 

stress of the S region surface blades showed surprising stress tolerance, as all post-hoc tests 

between surface blades at 24ºC and either 15 or 20ºC temperatures were non-significant (p &gt; 

0.742), indicating that ? was little affected over this temperature range. The same contrasts 

were significant for all other regions (p ? 0.00023 in all cases). Also all regional comparisons 

between the 24ºC treatments for the bottom blades were non-significant (p ? 0.698). The 

effect of the 24ºC surface blades on the interaction was also attested by the  analysis of the ? 

values between and within the 15ºC control and 20ºC that showed no significant differences 

between or within depths considering all possible  regional combinations (total 120 

combinations) with only one residual significant value (p = 0.046) . Because both ? and Fv/Fm 

represent aspects of photosynthetic efficiency (Kirk, 2011), the values reported were quite 

similar among temperatures within each region (Fig. 3). 

 

Maximum electron transport rate (rETRmax) 

Blades from all regions (exception for the S region surface blades) followed the same pattern 

in both depths as rETRmax values were higher at 20ºC, indicating increased photosynthetic 

performance when exposed to 20ºC and photosynthetic inhibition by thermal stress when 

exposed to 24ºC (Fig. 3).The post-hoc analysis of the interaction Region x Depth indicated 

that the significant regional differences were cause by significantly lower values in NC 

surface blades compared to other regions from the same depth (NC &amp;lt;N, p &amp;lt;0.001; NC &amp;lt;SC, 

p = 0.002; NC &amp;lt;S, p &amp;lt;0.001); no significant contrasts were found between regions when 

analyzing the blades collected from the bottom (p &gt; 0.257). Treatment temperatures (e.g. 15, 

20 and 24ºC) differed significantly, with 18.5% and 29.5% higher rETRmax values in blades 

at 20ºC, when compared to 15ºC and 24ºC, respectively (p &amp;lt;0.001) and 11% higher at 15ºC 



17 

 

than at 24ºC (p &amp;lt;0.001). Again, the S region surface blades showed tolerance to thermal 

stress (i.e. 24ºC) with no significant differences in rETRmax compared at 24ºC compared with 

20ºC and 15ºC (Fig. 3) (p = 1.000). 

 

Minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) 

The ANOVA analysis of Ek for adult blades showed a significant main effect for 

Temperature, and a significant interaction between Region x Depth (i.e., blade type). The 

patterns of the response were similar to ETRmax with a clear peak at 20ºC for the majority of 

the regions (Fig. 3). The Region x Depth interaction (Table 1) resulted from significantly 

lower Ek values in NC surface blades (96.3) compared to the N (130.4407), SC (124.069) 

and S (134.25) regions (all p ? 0.001) and no significant differences were found between 

surface blades for the other 3 regions (p &gt; 0.824). Regional comparisons for Ek in bottom 

blades were non-significant (p &gt; 0.438). At 20ºC, Ek values were 19.6% and 20.8% higher 

overall compared to 15ºC and 24ºC, respectively (p &amp;lt;0.001 for both comparisons), while no 

significant differences were found between 15ºC and 24ºC (p = 0.783). This result clearly 

demonstrates the thermal dependence of Ek with a peak near 20ºC in N, NC, and SC regions. 

In contrast, Ek for S region surface blades was temperature independent across the thermal 

range tested, with no significant differences detected (all p = 1.000; Fig. 3). The thermal 

dependence of both Ek and ETRmax is expected, since they are governed by the rate of 

enzymatic processes, and our results suggest that S region blades were better able to adjust 

photosynthetic rates across a broad temperature range between 15-24ºC, in contrast to surface 

blades from more northerly regions. 

The overall picture that emerged was that the NC region (Santa Barbara, Southern CA) was 

particularly sensitive to thermal effects on Fv/Fm, particular for surface blades.  Overall, 

bottom blades showed greater resilience than surface blades. There was also a clear tendency 

in the S region towards thermal stress resilience, followed, surprisingly, by N regional 

populations (Santa Cruz, Central CA).

Oceanographic data 

Short term climatology (2.5 months centered on the sampling day) showed a latitudinal 

gradient of temperature increase towards the south but with only small differences between

collected from the Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis ECMWF ORAP5.0. 

 

Previously to our sampling, the S region registered a continuous high temperature while the 

remaining regions presented a pattern of increasing temperatures. The NC region actually 

had higher temperatures than the SC region over several days prior to sampling, especially 

at 20m depth. Seawater (SW) temperatures at 20 m depth showed lower values when 

compared to the surface. On the sampling day, cooler 20 m SW had a mean difference to the 

warmer surface of between 2 and 3ºC. During the months following the sampling, a persistent 

pattern of water temperature increase was predominant in which 25ºC was reached in the S 

region by mid-September.

Comparison of entire individuals vs excised blades (Experiment 2) 

The photosynthetic response (Fv/Fm) over time for three different types of blades (entire 

juveniles, excised adults and juvenile blades) to thermal and nutrient stress is shown in 

(Fig. 6).

seawater, over time.  

 

 



24 

 

As in the previous experiment, blades and entire individuals at 16ºC showed rather constant 

Fv/Fm over time while exposure to 24ºC resulted in a rapid decrease, indicating a severe 

decline in PSII energy conversion efficiency. The ANOVA showed an interaction between 

Temperature x Nutrients and a significant main effect for the factor Tissue (Table 3). The 

post-hoc analysis (Tukey HSD) on the factor Tissue (i.e. juvenile, excised juvenile and adult 

blades) indicated no significant differences between the entire juvenile and the juvenile blade 

(p = 0.995), supporting the experiment design using excised blades in Experiment 1. Also in 

this analysis, significantly higher Fv/Fm values were found for adult blades (0.766) when 

compared with entire juvenile (0.737) and juvenile blade (0.736) (p = 0.0000065 and p = 

0.0000001, respectively). Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) indicated that the interaction between 

Temperature x Nutrients was due to higher temperature as tissue at 24ºC in enriched SW had 

significant lower Fv/Fm values than 16ºC non-enriched and by nutrients when temperatures 

were at 24ºC (see Annex II for mean values and p-values). The only exception was between 

16ºC enriched and 16ºC non-enriched where differences in Fv/Fm were non-significant (p = 

0.848). This experiment supports the use of excised blades as surrogate for entire individuals 

for M. pyrifera and that high temperature (24ºC) in conjugation with low nutrients availability 

affects this species ecophysiological response, while having no effect at lower (non-stressful) 

temperatures (16ºC), at least for 72h.

Comparison of F1 generation juvenile sporophytes (Experiment 3) 

F1 generation juvenile sporophytes of M. pyrifera grown in vitro and exposed to a thermal 

gradient over a 5-day simulated heat wave (15, 19 and 21ºC) showed few region-specific 

patterns of stress induced by temperature increase, based on photosynthetic response 

parameters (Fv/Fm and the RLCs parameters ?, ETRmax and Ek; Fig. 7).

differences among regions within each sampling time (00, 24, 48, 72 and 96h) for each temperature using Tukey 

HSD. North-Center region data at 24h on 19 and 21ºC was removed due to values inconsistences. 



26 

 

 

Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) 

Values for  Fv/Fm in F1 juvenile sporophytes increased with increasing temperature as by the 

last sampling time (96 h) sporophytes at 21ºC had higher Fv/Fm  (0.725) when compared with 

the control (15ºC) (0.671) although this increase was only significant for the SC region (p = 

0.006) (Fig. 7). The interaction Region x Temperature (Table 4) was analyzed with post-hoc 

tests (Tukey HSD), which showed that within the same temperature, significant regional 

differences were only found at 21ºC, in which the S region had significant lower Fv/Fm values 

(0.670) compared to N (0.721) and SC (0.749) regions (p = 0.021 and p = 0.0000042, 

respectively), but was not significantly different to the NC region (0.719; p = 0.087). 

 

Light-limited photosynthetic rates (?) 

The photosynthetic efficiency of juvenile F1 sporophytes as assessed from the initial slope 

of ETR vs. irradiance curves (?). With ? as response variable, post-hoc tests on the interaction 

Region x Temperature reveled significant differences within  temperature treatments, but in 

contrast to Fv/Fm no differences were found at 21ºC (all p &gt; 0.252), but only at 19ºC and 15ºC. 

At 15ºC ? values from the N region sporophytes (0.260) were significantly lower than either 

the NC (0.273) or SC (0.277) regions (p = 0.00043; p = 0, respectively), while SC had 

significantly greater ? than the S region (0.266, p = 0.0097456). All regions showed a 

significant increase in ? values at 21ºC compared with controls at 15ºC (S &gt; 9%, p = 0.001; 

SC &gt; 4.9%, p = 0.011; N 11.2%, p = 0) except for NC region (&gt; 1.1%, p = 0.999). 

 

Maximum electron transport rate (rETRmax) 

An increase of ETRmax values with temperature and also time was observed during the 

experiment (Fig. 7). The analysis of the interaction Region x Temperature indicated a 

significant increase of regional differences with increasing temperature within the same 

region as ETRmax values were significantly higher at 21ºC compared to the 15ºC control (N 

&gt; 33.4%; NC &gt; 17.9%; SC 43%; S &gt; 42%) (p &amp;lt;0.0000322). All regional contrasts at 21ºC 



27 

 

differ significantly (p &amp;lt;0.044) except for S-SC regions (p = 0.972) but at 15ºC significant 

differences were only found between NC region and the N and SC regions (p = 0.034 and 

0.014, respectively). At 21ºC the sporophytes from S and SC regions showed significant 

higher ETRmax (24.01 and 22.96, respectively) compared with NC and S regions (17.55 and 

19.79, respectively) (p &amp;lt;0.004).  

 

Minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) 

F1 sporophyte Ek values followed a similar pattern to ETRmax as the Region x Temperature 

interaction pointed again to significant contrasts at higher temperatures, with tissue within 

each region at 21ºC showing Ek mean values 31% greater overall than 15ºC control (all p ? 

0.002). Regional differences were also higher at 21ºC as northern regions showed 

significantly lower Ek values (N = 68.8 and NC = 63.88) compared with the southern regions 

(SC = 79.49 and S = 82.40; all p ? 0.001). No significant differences were found within the 

groups (N-NC, p = 0.836 and SC-S, p = 0.999).  At 15ºC, a strong reduction in Ek was 

observed at 96 h, but interestingly S region sporophytes Ek values continued to increase, 

being at least 32.33% higher than the other regions.

Discussion 

 

Regional differences and potential for local adaptation 

The results of our common garden experiment clearly showed that populations of M. pyrifera 

at the southernmost limit of the species distribution in the northern hemisphere displayed 

greater thermal tolerance in their photosynthetic physiology. This suggests an important 

effect of the highly selective thermal conditions of the southernmost kelp habitat. This better 

performance of South (S) region populations was more clearly seen in the blades collected at 

the water surface, which were able to maintain similar maximum electron transport rate 

(ETRmax) values at temperatures between 15-24ºC, and in contrast to more northerly 

populations. The rather clear patterns of thermal tolerance in the S region surface blades was 

much less evident in blades from deeper waters (bottom blades), the responses of which were 

rather similar between regions.  

Given the constraints of the experiment, in particular the short pre-acclimation period, these 

differences can either be attributed to intrinsic (i.e., genetically-determined) variation, or to 

plasticity induced by an environmental history of higher temperatures in southern surface 

waters (up to 20ºC; Fig. 4). Wave height increase might also have impacted the kelp forests 

of the south region as the hurricane Blanca, the second of the season, moved near the 

populations two weeks before our sampling campaign. In the field, the southern population 

(Bahia Tortugas) had a lower canopy cover (sparse distribution of individuals) and showed 

signs of greater stress (lower pigmentation, damaged tissue) compared with populations in 

more northern regions. The differences observed between the S and SC regions are all the 

more intriguing given that genetic analysis with microsatellites (neutral genetic markers) 

indicated that these two regions form a single genetic cluster (Johansson et al., 2015). We 

conclude that, while the results are consistent with local genetic adaptation, this hypothesis 

will require further analysis and confirmation via the transcriptomes extracted from the 

individuals across the experiments, particularly those derived from the F1 generation cultured 

in vitro from parental reproductive material.  



29 

 

Individuals from the North-Center (NC) region showed a consistently poor photosynthetic 

response to thermal and nutrients stressors compared with other regions using both 

acclimated field-collected blades (Experiment 1) and in vitro F1 sporophytes (Experiment 

3). As F1 juveniles were grown in common-garden laboratory conditions, the effects of 

environmental history can safely be excluded (assuming no or limited carry-over across 

generations and life-history phases). It can therefore be concluded that the NC populations 

are intrinsically less able to cope with stress conditions due to genetic factors. A possible 

reason might be elevated levels of self-fertilization and inbreeding in NC populations. 

Previous studies in the Santa Barbara bay area showed that self-fertilization greatly reduced 

M. pyrifera fitness (survival to adulthood, zygote production, development of reproductive 

structures and fecundity) (Raimondi et al., 2004) . The study of Johansson et al., (2013) 

reported a high self-fertilization rate (32-44%) and strong correlation between inbreeding 

depression and mortality. Although this hypothesis requires an objective study and analysis 

at the regional level, our results suggest that reproductive strategies and constraints such as 

inbreeding and self-fertilization may be important factors regulating regional differences 

underlying local population dynamics. 

The North (N) and South-Center (SC) regions adult blades showed similar intermediate 

photosynthetic responses to stress conditions with no significant differences between them 

(Table 1, Fig. 3). N region blades from both depths were in very good conditions, with almost 

no tissue damage or mucilage production and good pigmentation which might reflect local 

field conditions prior to our experiment as SW temperatures were below 15ºC in the area. 

The good ecophysiological conditions might have contributed to the increase of 

photosynthetic efficiency of surface blades (?) compared to the other regions but Fv/Fm and 

ETRmax were lower than the S region, suggesting greater stress on the photosynthetic 

apparatus. The N region kelp forests are located ~ 300 km north of the phylogeographical 

break of Point Sal (Johansson et al., 2015), 50Km north of the biogeographic break of Point 

Conception, a boundary characterized by a 5ºC north-south temperature gradient caused by 

the interaction of the cold California current with the California Eddy (Burton, 1998; Eberl 

et al., 2013). The mean surface temperature during a MHW over the last 22 years is 15.447ºC 

± 0.958 in this region. This suggests that these populations are not exposed to the same level 

of thermal/nutrient stress experienced by the southern regions, and may putatively be less 



30 

 

able to cope with such stresses. Our regional analysis did not, however, show a clear 

latitudinal gradient of ecophysiological response of the giant kelp to thermal and nutrient 

stresses, which could be due to several factors:  heterogeneity of oceanographic/atmospheric 

processes (Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), El Niño and La Niña, California current, 

California Eddy, upwelling areas, internal waves) (Burton, 1998; Fram et al., 2008; Ladah et 

al., 2012 ; Newman et al., 2016; Jacox et al., 2016)   , or, as suggested by other authors, or 

by more local processes that interact at a smaller (population) scales such as competition, 

dispersal and reproduction, wave exposure, dispersal, forest depth and density (Dayton, 

1999; Edwards, 2004; Edwards &amp;amp; Hernández-Carmona, 2005; Cavanaugh et al., 2011; 

Cavanaugh et al., 2013; Johansson et al., 2015). Thus, in order to understand and predict 

possible implications of climate change on M. pyrifera forests on a regional level, further 

studies should focus on understanding the fundamental processes that act locally and how 

they interact with larger scale processes. 

 

Thermal limits 

This study showed that at 24ºC adult blades from almost all regions of Macrocystis pyrifera 

studied showed a strong decline in ecophysiological responses. However, the exception was 

surface blades from the southernmost region, which did not follow general trends with 

respect to temperature-sensitive photosynthetic parameters Ek and rETRmax. While Fv/Fm and 

the slope of electron transport rate with increasing irradiance (?) showed a similar pattern of 

photosynthetic rate decrease with increasing temperature, rETRmax and Ek increased from 15 

to 20 ºC followed by a decrease at 24 ºC. This temperature trend is typical of rate-limited 

enzymatic processes in, e.g., Calvin cycle enzymes such as RuBisCO (Kirk, 2011). When 

temperature was increased to 24ºC the thermal optimum for photosynthesis was exceeded 

and the entire network was affected. The exception to this pattern was the S region surface 

blades in which ETRmax an Ek did not differ between 15 and 24ºC, suggesting either pre-

acclimation or adaptation to local conditions with warmer SW temperatures. 

 It appears that the thermal limits of photosynthetic performance were not exceeded in 

Experiment 3 using F1 juvenile sporophytes, in which 21ºC was the maximum exposure 

temperature. It is also possible that the use of gradual thermal ramping may have alleviated 



31 

 

the effects of thermal stress in this experiment (2ºC increments per 24 h up to the target 

temperature), compared with the direct shock used in the 1st and 2nd experiments. As a result, 

F1 sporophytes showed increasing ETRmax and Ek with increasing temperature, particularly 

in the SC and S regions. We decided on this approach based on the results and observations 

of the last two experiments, as well as published experiments showing that juveniles under 

stress conditions survive less well than adults (Dean &amp;amp; Jacobsen, 1984), the small size and 

thickness of the F1 sporophytes and the necessity to avoid sampling necrotic tissue that would 

jeopardize further transcriptomic analysis. Although F1 sporophytes were not subjected to 

substantial disturbance to the photosynthetic apparatus, e.g., decline in Fv/Fm at higher 

temperatures, it was nevertheless significant that differences in thermally-sensitive 

enzymatic processes (Ek and rETRmax) could be distinguished between S/SC (higher 

performance) and N/NC (lower performance) regions. However, further experiments will be 

required to explore the effects of higher temperatures on the upper thermal limits for 

photosynthetic performance and other (e.g., growth) responses.  

Climatology data for the months prior to our sampling showed that the central regions (NC 

and SC) shared similar thermal regimes, while the N region dominated by the cold California 

current had lower temperatures and S region was already experiencing high SW temperatures 

(Fig. 4). The low canopy cover of the southernmost populations may have reflected the 

prevailing thermal conditions, in addition to which local populations composed of juveniles 

and small adult sporophytes were still regrowing after they disappeared during the summer 

of 2014 (personal communication by the local fisherman). This information is supported by 

the 22 y climatology data of the S region (Fig. 5) which showed a great increase in MHW 

frequency in the summer of 2014 and spring of 2015. Selection pressure for 

acclimation/survival of individuals more adapted to higher temperatures prior to sampling is 

therefore clearly possible. Our data also showed an unprecedented increase frequency, 

duration and intensity of MHWs that for the first time in 22 years occurred for two 

consecutive years (2014-15) (see also Table 2); phenomena reported on the study area by 

several other authors (Bond et al., 2015 ; Jacox et al., 2016; Levine &amp;amp; Mcphaden, 2016; Reed 

et al., 2016; Cohen et al., 2017). While temperature itself can directly impact the vital 

processes of the giant kelp, including photosynthesis, SW temperature increase is inversely 

related to nutrients concentration and indeed has been widely used as a proxy for nutrient 



32 

 

concentration (Kamykowsk, 1977; Dugdale et al., 1989; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Kremer, 1984; 

Switzer et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2016). 

 

Nutrient effects 

The nutrient treatments tested in Experiment 1 (enriched and non-enriched SW with PES) 

did not showed clear effects on the photosynthesis rates of the adult blades. This lack of effect 

was evident as the RLCs parameters and Fv/Fm showed no significance on the Nutrients and 

no interaction was found with the other factors (Table 1). A likely reason is that even though 

M. pyrifera adult sporophyte nutrient and photosynthate storage capabilities are considered 

to be small (only 2-3 weeks) (Gerard, 1982) the short duration of the experiment (max. 72 h) 

did not result in significant depletion of reserves. Another reason might be that the nutrient 

concentration on the SW used on our experiment was already above non-limiting 

concentrations, even though it was collected from stationary reservoirs where the SW is 

stored for several days at relatively high temperatures. The analysis of the water sampled 

during the experiment 1 from each treatment was not available by the writing of this thesis 

but will certainly be used to clarify our results in future publications. On the other hand, 

significant nutrients effects and interaction with temperature were observed in experiment 2 

(Table 3). Our results showed that at higher temperatures (i.e. 24ºC) photosynthetic rates 

(Fv/Fm) were significantly lower in the non-enriched treatments compared to the PES-

enriched treatments, although no significant differences were found at 16ºC control. This 

illustrates a positive relationship between nutrient availability and thermal stress tolerance to 

warmer temperatures. Our results are in agreement with a recent study on another Kelp, 

Saccharina japonica, where nutrient availability significantly increased growth rates and 

survival of juveniles and adults (blade discs) at warmer temperatures (Gao et al., 2017). In 

two separate field experiments using nutrient fertilization, M. pyrifera  responded positively 

to thermal stress (warm seawater periods) when nutrient availability was increased, resulting 

in reduction of adult canopy loss (North, 1983) and increase of juvenile survival (Hernandez-

Carmona et al., 2001). Thus our further research will also include a non-enriched treatment 

(using controlled artificial SW) in order to understand the possible synergistic effect of 

nutrients at warm SW temperature on the F1 juvenile sporophytes.  



33 

 

Depth effects 

Consistent differences in the photosynthetic rates between surface and bottom blades were 

found, with surface blades showing a lower mean Fv/Fm and RLC parameters (?, rETRmax 

and Ek) but also higher variance within these values, especially at 24 ºC. Previous studies 

have found that the maximum photosynthetic and ETR rates of M. pyrifera blades decreased 

with depth and were mainly controlled by the vertical distribution of PAR in the water 

column (Colombo-Pallotta et al., 2006). In that study, surface blades were found to be 

adapted for high photosynthetic production with high values of Fv/Fm and rETR and protected 

from the high light intensity by UV-absorbing compounds and protective carotenoids while 

bottom blades had lower photosynthetic rates and were responsible for the nutrient uptake. 

This makes sense as an adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baja 

California warmer months: a stratified water column with an oligotrophic warm surface layer 

that is breached by deep cold, nutrient rich waters pulsed by upwelling and internal waves 

events (Ladah, 2003; Ladah et al., 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2016). In another study, old surface 

blades were found to have lower Fv/Fm values and higher variability compared to bottom 

blades but also strong diurnal variability photosynthetic performance (Edwards &amp;amp; Kim, 

2010). During our experiment, surface blades from all regions also showed lower Fv/Fm 

values, lower pigmentation and were visibly more damaged than bottom blades. It is then 

safe to assume that the continuous exposure to UV, wave motion, higher temperatures and 

photosynthesis workload on surface blades resulted in higher cellular and external damage. 

The exposure to the experimental temperatures (24 ºC) above the algae thermal optimum 

resulted in more rapid degradation of the surface blades. On the other hand bottom blades 

were in much better physiological condition and showed higher stability between regions for 

all RLCs parameters compared to the surface blades, a pattern also reported previously for 

M. pyrifera (Edwards &amp;amp; Kim, 2010).

Conclusions  

Our findings suggests that populations of M. pyrifera from the southernmost region of the 

species distribution in the northern hemisphere, exhibit resilience to warmer ocean conditions 

compared to cooler, more northern regions. At the southern limit, higher photosynthetic rates 

under thermal stress were observed in field sampled adult blades acclimated and tested under 

common garden conditions.  Importantly, with respect to mainly enzyme-limited 

photosynthetic processes (rETRmax, Ek), greater tolerance was seen in vitro F1 juveniles from 

the S and SC regions, suggesting that populations in these regions are locally adapted to the 

prevailing warmer ocean conditions. Despite the greater resilience to thermal stress, observed 

increasing frequency and intensity of MHWs and other disturbances such as hurricanes might 

result in a cumulative effect on the M. pyrifera forests, reducing the overall resilience of the 

ecosystem (Wernberg et al., 2010).  

We also observed a generally poor photosynthetic response to thermal stress in the NC 

region, which also carried over to the F1 generation. Climatological data showed a thermal 

regime in the NC region around Santa Barbara to be at least as warm as the SC area of Baja 

California. Therefore our experimental observations suggest some underlying genetic basis 

leading to reduced fitness (e.g., possible inbreeding; Raimondi et al., 2004) in this region, 

which forms a distinct genetic group (Johansson et al., 2015).  

Our experiments also demonstrated that thermal stress tolerance of M. pyrifera might be 

enhanced by nutrient availability and highlights the need for future studies on this subject. 

Finally, the use of excised blades as a valid surrogate for entire individuals was verified for 

M. pyrifera juveniles, at least for short experimental periods (24-72h). Our further research 

will focus the analysis of the transcriptomes extracted from the adult blades and F1 juveniles 

in order to evaluate putative regional local adaptation and assess the synergy of nutrients and 

temperature stress on F1 sporophytes.
