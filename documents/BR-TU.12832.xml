AGRADECIMENTOS 

A l'issue de mon doctorat, je suis convaincu que la thèse est loin d'être un 

travail solitaire. En effet, je n'aurais jamais pu réaliser ce travail doctoral sans le 

soutien d'un grand nombre de personnes dont la générosité, la bonne humeur et 

l'intérêt manifestés à l'égard de ma recherche m'ont permis de progresser dans cette 

phase délicate de « l'apprenti-chercheur ». 

J’exprime toute ma reconnaissance à Jöelle Léonil et à Sylvie Lortal pour 

m’avoir accueilli au sein du STL? et permis de mener bien ce projet dans 

d’excellentes conditions humaines et professionnelles. 

Je voudrais remercier mon jury de thèse, Dr. Martine Decloux, Dr. Joël Scher, 

Dr. Guillaume Delaplace, Dr. Bernard Cuq, Dr. Antônio Fernandes de Carvalho, Dr. 

Romain Jeantet, et Dr. Bernard Rémond. Votre présence le jour de ma soutenance 

ainsi que le temps dédié à l’appréciation de mon manuscrit de thèse ont été un grand 

honneur pour moi. 

Je remercie mon encadrant et chef, Pierre Schuck, que je considère plutôt 

comme un ami. Pour moi Pierre est un exemple de professionnalisme et de 

gentillesse. Il était gratifiant de travailler en sachant qu'en cas de doute ou de 

problème, Pierre me conseillerait avec le sourire. Merci Pierre pour ta patience, tes 

conseils, tes enseignements, pour ton exemple d’engagement sérieux, et pour ta 

façon positive de voir les problèmes. Merci beaucoup papa Schuck. 

S'il y a une personne qui m'a toujours soutenu, cru en moi et aidé avec tout 

ce dont j'avais besoin, c'est sans doute le Professor Antônio Fernandes de Carvalho. 

Merci pour l’encouragement, la confiance et le soutien qui n’ont jamais cessé dès 

lors que nous avons commencé à travailler ensemble. 

Merci à Romain Jeantet de m'avoir encadré et d’avoir joué le rôle de relecteur 

final de mes travaux scientifiques. Romain tu es un exemple pour moi d’un excellent 

ingénieur et scientifique. Un grand merci à toi pour toute la rigueur scientifique que 

tu m’as apprise.

Je suis heureux d'avoir eu la chance de travailler et d'être officieusement 

encadré par Gaëlle Tanguy. Merci pour ta relecture enrichissante de toutes mes 

publications, pour la relecture scrupuleuse de mon manuscrit de thèse et tes 

suggestions toujours avisées. Tu m’as permis Gaëlle de clarifier mes pensées 

parfois embrouillées. Tes remarques très pertinentes ont fait avancer ma réflexion 

d'un point de vue scientifique. 

Je tiens à remercier deux messieurs sans qui les résultats de mes travaux 

scientifiques ne seraient jamais arrivés à la moitié d'où ils en sont aujourd'hui. Merci 

Serge Méjean et Laurent Fromont, j’ai appris beaucoup, beaucoup avec vous. Vous 

m’avez aidé non seulement avec la partie technique de mon sujet de doctorat, mais 

aussi appris à ne jamais laisser tomber, à persévérer, à toujours trouver une solution 

aux problèmes insolubles. Merci Laurent d'avoir partagé tes connaissances de 15 

ans de marine et d'avoir toujours été disponible pour me dépanner quand j’avais 

besoin. Merci Serge pour le partage de tes connaissances sans fin dans le domaine 

de la concentration et du séchage. Merci d’être toujours prêt à m'aider et souriant. 

Merci à tous les gens qui travaillent sur la plateforme Lait. Merci de m’avoir 

supporté pendant ces années de travail à vos côtés. Merci pour la superbe ambiance 

et pour toute l’aide et la compréhension dont vous avez fait preuve avec moi. Merci 

à vous ?adine, Gilles et Bénédicte. Merci Benoit (Benolé) pour l’amitié et les 

moments drôles partagés pendant ces années. 

Merci Rachel Boutrou, d’avoir aidé tous les jeunes chercheurs du STL? avec 

ton merveilleux travail. Merci d’avoir élargi le champ de ma vision scientifique. Merci 

de t'être préoccupée et de m'avoir aidé avec la vulgarisation scientifique. 

Pendant mes quatre ans au sein du STL? j’ai aussi eu la chance de partager 

le bureau avec des personnes que je respecte et admire profondément. Merci à 

Gwenollé Gernigion pour la compagnie, les discussions scientifiques, l'aide pour les 

premières démarches scientifiques au sein du STL? et pour l’apprentissage de la 

culture bretonne. Merci à Peng Zhu pour ton amitié et pour être un exemple de 

professionnalisme pour moi. Je dois maintenant remercier ma maman française, qui 

mérite un paragraphe entier.

Merci à l’équipe Carinhosos. Je tiens à vous vraiment très très fort. Marilia, 

Samira et Gui, les soirées, voyages et le temps passé avec vous sont inoubliables 

et épiques. Merci Samira pour les câlins, le respect et les conseils. Merci Marilia 

d’être toujours sympa et réceptive, tu donnes envie de rester à tes côtés, avec toute 

ton énergie très captivante. Merci à Gui d’être présent dans ma vie depuis si 

longtemps et d’être mon compagnon de trajet scientifique. 

Heureusement que mes parents et mes frères sont là pour me changer les 

idées. Ils ont tous cru en moi et ouf ! Maintenant j’y suis ! Alors merci à mon papa 

Hélcio Caldas Silveira et à ma maman Maristela Pereira Silveira, malgré toutes les 

difficultés rencontrées vous m’avez  laissé rêver grand et avez fait tout le possible 

et même l’impossible pour que je réussisse. Merci à mes frères Arcanjo Caldas

ABSTRACT 

 

 

SILVEIRA, Arlan Caldas Pereira, D.S., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, October, 
2015. Thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the vacuum 
evaporation process during concentration of dairy products in a falling film 

evaporator. Adviser: Antônio Fernandes de Carvalho. Co-advisers: Ítalo Tuler 
Perrone and Pierre Schuck. 

 

Falling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical, refrigeration, 

petroleum refining, desalination and food industries. In the dairy industry FFE is 

applied for the concentration of solutions prior to the drying step. Despite the 

economic importance of the vacuum evaporation process in the manufacture of dairy 

dried products, the knowledge about the process is mostly empirical. Research 

aiming to improve the efficiency of the process is therefore necessary. The objective 

of this PhD project was to characterize experimentally a FFE during the 

concentration of dairy products by means of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic 

approaches, in order to study the interactions between the products properties and 

the operating parameters. A pilot-scale, single-stage falling film evaporator that 

describes the same process as that of an industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point 

of view was instrumented and used to establish the mass and energy balances. The 

evaporation rate and the overall heat transfer coefficient were calculated from the 

experimental data to follow up the process. A methodology for the determination of 

the experimental residence time distribution (RTD) functions was developed. RTD 

functions provide global information about the flow of the products during 

concentration in a FFE. Increasing of the concentration of skim milk, mass flow rate 

and the distance covered by the product resulted in an increase in the dispersion of 



 

xxii 

 

the products particles. The experimental RTD functions were modelled by a 

combination of two perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series. From the interpretation of 

this model, two different flows, a main and a minor flow, were identified. The RTD 

methodology developed on skim milk was applied to sweet whey and lactic acid 

whey and the study was extended to the formation of fouling during a 5-hour 

concentration. The mean residence time was more sensitive to identify fouling than 

the overall heat transfer coefficient and the evaporation rate. This study emphasized 

the crucial role of process characterization to improve the performance of FFE and 

product quality.

RESUMO 

 

 

SILVEIRA, Arlan Caldas Pereira, D.S., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, outubro de 
2015. Caracterização termodinâmica e hidrodinâmica do processo de 
evaporação a vácuo durante a concentração de produtos lácteos em um 

evaporador de película descendente. Orientador: Antônio Fernandes de Carvalho. 
Coorientadores: Ítalo Tuler Perrone e Pierre Schuck. 

 

 

Os evaporadores de película descendente (EPD) são amplamente utilizados nas 

indústrias químicas, de refrigeração, de refino de petróleo e de alimentos. Nas 

indústrias de laticínios, os EPD são mais comumente utilizados para a concentração 

de soluções antes do processo de secagem por spray-dryer. Apesar da importância 

econômica do processo de evaporação a vácuo na produção de produtos lácteos 

desidratados, o conhecimento do processo é essencialmente empírico. Estudos 

visando a otimização do processo são portanto necessários. O objetivo deste 

projeto de doutorado é o de caracterizar experimentalmente um EPD durante a 

concentração de produtos lácteos, utilizando de abordagens termodinâmicas e 

hidrodinâmicas afim de se estudar as interações entre as propriedades dos produtos 

e os paramêtros operacionais. Um evaporador de película descendente, simples 

efeito, em escala piloto, que descreve o mesmo processo em escala industrial de 

um ponto de vista hidrodinâmico, foi instrumentado e utilizado para a determinação 

dos balanços de massa e de energia. A capacidade evaporativa e o coeficiente 

global de transferência de calor foram calculados a partir dos dados experimentais. 

Uma metodologia para a determinação experimental da função de distribuição dos 

tempos de residência (DTR) foi desenvolvida. As funções DTR fornecem 



 

xxiv 

 

informações essenciais sobre o escoamento dos produtos durante a concentração 

em EPD. O aumento da concentração, da vazão mássica e da distância percorrida 

pelo produto, provocam um aumento na dispersão das partículas do fluxo. Estas 

funções foram modelados por uma combinação de reatores em cascada, 

perfeitamente agitados. De acordo com a interpretação deste modelo, dois fluxos, 

um primário e um secundário, correspondendo a duas camadas de produto que 

fluem sobrepostas através dos tubos de evaporação, foram propostos. A 

metodologia para o cálculo das funções DTR foi aplicada a diferentes produtos 

lácteos (leite desnatado, soro de leite doce e ácido), e o estudo foi estendido para 

a formação de fouling durante a concentração por evaporação a vácuo. O tempo de 

residência médio real foi mais sensível para identificar a formação de fouling que o 

coeficiente global de transferência de calor e do que a capacidade evaporativa. Este 

estudo enfatizou o papel crucial da caracterização do processo de evaporação a 

vácuo para a otmização de EPD e da qualidade dos produtos oriundos dessa 

tecnologia.

GE?ERAL I?TR?DUCTI?? 
 

Overall cow’s milk production and consumption grew by approximately 15% from 

2005 to 2014. With the uneven distribution of milk production at the global level, the expected 

growth in the world population and the rise in standards of living (in particular in developing 

countries), the dairy market will be confronted with even more massive changes in the next 

decade. The world market for dairy powders is expanding considerably. The investment in 

new vacuum evaporators and spray driers is therefore being reported throughout the world 

to secure outlets. The vacuum evaporation process is mainly used in the dairy industry prior 

to drying. Moreover the quality of the concentrates influences the final powder quality. 

This context clearly drives researches in order to improve the efficiency and control 

of the vacuum evaporation process. However, few research groups are interested in this 

topic. The dairy industry has acquired empirical expertise in the vacuum evaporation 

process, and the research centers in dairy powder are interested, until then, in drying 

technology (spray dryer). Study of vacuum concentration of dairy products is therefore a 

challenging for research in food processing engineering. 

The goal of this PhD project was to characterize experimentally a falling film 

evaporator during the concentration of dairy products, by means of thermodynamic and 

hydrodynamic approaches, in order to study the interactions between the products 

properties and the operating parameters. A prototype pilot-scale, single-stage falling film 

evaporator was therefore used to tackle these issues. This equipment was designed to 

describe the same process as the industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point of view. 



 

2 

 

This work was therefore divided into three research parts: one on the instrumentation 

and characterization of a pilot-scale falling film evaporator, another part on the 

hydrodynamic profile of the vacuum evaporation process, and a third part on the application 

of the approaches previously developed to other dairy products. 

To state the scientific and economic context of the project, a chapter about the trade 

development of dairy powders and vacuum evaporation research trends (Chapter 1), and a 

literature review on vacuum evaporation process during concentration of dairy products 

(Chapter 2) are presented. These chapters are followed by the description of the 

experimental strategy of the PhD project (Chapter 3). The second part of the thesis 

presented materials and methods, results and discussion regarding the process of vacuum 

evaporation of different dairy products. This includes the description of the pilot-scale single 

stage falling film evaporator used in this study (Chapter 4), the thermodynamic and 

hydrodynamic characterization of this equipment (Chapter 5, and 6, respectively) and the 

application of these approaches to other dairy products (Chapter 7). Finally, the main 

contributions and potential research opportunities are drawn together in the conclusion and 

in the outlook sections.

1.1. Key dairy market statistics 

1.1.1. Milk Production 

 

The worldwide production of milk is forecast to grow by as much as 2% in 2015, a 

rate similar to previous years, and should reach 805 million tons. Asia is expected to account 

for most of the increase, but production is projected to rise in all regions (FAO, 2015). The 

main milk producers are Europe, India, The United States of America, China and Brazil, 

which have had high production rates over the last 5 years (Fig. 1.1). 

 

Figure 1.1. Main milk producers (USDA NASS, 2015). 

Note: 2015: forecast. 

The worldwide production of milk should continue to grow in coming years, reaching 

a level of 880 million tons in 2020 (Fig. 1.2) (OECD-FAO, 2015).

Figure 1.2. Evolution of worldwide production of milk from 2013 to 2020. (2015 to 

2020: forecast) (OECD/FAO, 2015). 

France is the second highest producer of milk in Europe and the seventh in the world, 

with 25.3 million tons of milk per year. In France, about 40% of the milk produced is 

processed and exported (CNIEL, 2015), product manufacture representing a turnover of 

27.2 billion euros and generating about 250,000 jobs (CNIEL, 2015). Dairy products to the 

value of 6.9 billion euros were exported in 2013, with a trade surplus of 3.6 billion euros, an 

increase of 71% in 10 years. 

Brazil is among the five largest producers of milk in the world and has achieved a 

significant role in the global dairy market. Brazil came from production of 7.3 million tons of 

milk in the 70s to 35 million tons in 2014 (IBGE, 2015). This year the country is expected to 

reach the third place as worldwide producer of milk, surpassing Chinese production (FAO, 

2015).

1.1.2. World market for dairy powders 

The popularity and increasing range of dairy products and the westernization of diets 

continue to be key factors driving the worldwide dairy market. Among dairy products, the 

global milk powder market is expanding considerably (Fig. 1.3), e.g. in France around 19% 

of processed milk volume is transformed into different dairy powders (CNIEL, 2015). This is 

due to an increasing demand for milk products from countries with milk shortages, in 

particular emerging countries.

importer of dairy products, with a negative balance of nearly 0.3 million tons in the 90s. From 

2004 to 2008, it was an exporter of dairy products (Fig. 1.4). However, with a growing 

consumption of dairy products, large world supply and depreciation of the dollar, since 2008 

Brazil has again become an importer of dairy products. 

 

Figure 1.4. Trade balance of Brazilian dairy products from 2001 to 2014 (in milk 

equivalent) (EMBRAPA, 2010; Milkpoint, 2014). 

Due to the country's economic issues and lower GDP growth rate, the consumption 

of dairy products in Brazil was slowing in 2014. However, in 2014 Brazil increased its 

turnover of dairy exports by 254.3% compared to 2013 (MDCI, 2014) (Table 1.1). The 

Brazilian export of dairy products had a favorable scenario in this year.

With changes in agricultural policy (such as the implementation of a quota system 

and the dissolution of the price support system), the dairy industry has improved the use of 

surplus milk production and by-products resulting from cheese and butter production (whey, 

buttermilk). The development of filtration technology (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, 

nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) has allowed the production of valuable milk protein 

fractions (Schuck et al., 2013). Used either as nutritional or functional ingredients, most of 

these proteins are marketed in dehydrated form. In the last ten years, the nature of dairy 

powders has changed to more specific intermediate dried products, and powders have been 

developed as techno-functional ingredients according to their expected functional properties 

such as gelation, foaming and emulsification. Many new uses of these constituents have 

appeared with the manufacture of formula products, substitutes and adapted raw material. 

Dairy powders are therefore used in the development of a wide range of products. 

1.1.3. French and Brazilian dried dairy product markets 

About 56% of dairy powders produced in France are exported, mainly to the 

European Union, Asia and the Middle East. The French production of milk powders accounts 

for approximately 10% of the total world production (IDF, 2013) (Table 1.2).

Dairy dried products are highly significant in the Brazilian dairy market. The domestic 

demand for dairy products (mainly milk powders) is expanding, as well as global demand. 

Dairy powders corresponded to 69.6% of Brazilian dairy imports in 2013, 49.4% being skim 

and whole milk powders, 19.6% whey powder and 0.6% infant formulae (MDCI, 2014). 

1.1.4. Developments and investments involving concentrated and dried dairy 

products 

Investment in new spray driers and vacuum evaporators are being reported 

throughout the world to secure outlets. Indeed, investments of more than 2.5 billion euros 

are currently predicted for dried dairy products, involving 46 companies, 53 projects and 28 

countries (CNIEL, 2012). Over the last two years, 400 million euros of investment were 

announced or implemented on French territory to produce milk or whey powders (CNIEL, 

2015). Fig. 1.5 shows investments of more than 100 million US$ announced and/or finalized 

in Europe and in America.

A combination of newly developing markets for dairy products, particularly in South-

East Asia, and the emergence of new entrant countries with rapidly expanding milk 

production are changing the dynamics of the world dairy industry. With a projected increase 

in world milk production, it is to be expected that dairy powders will continue to play an 

important role in facilitating trade of milk solids on an international scale. Vacuum 

evaporation and spray drying along with existing and novel techniques will continue to be 

important contributors to ingredient innovation. Increasing intellectual property protection

defense purposes, and also to exploit commercial opportunities on international markets 

(Kelly, 2006). 

1.2. Worldwide research involving “falling film vacuum evaporators” 

Evaporation is the most often used technique in the food industry for concentrating 

solutions or crystallizing solids from solutions. Of all the existing technology for evaporation 

of a solution in dairy industries, the falling film evaporator is currently the most frequently 

used, mainly due to its ability to treat heat-sensitive products. 

Considering the economic importance of vacuum evaporation in the production of 

concentrated / dehydrated dairy products, research aiming to improve the efficiency of the 

process is necessary. However, few research groups are interested in this topic (Fig. 1.6). 

The dairy industry has acquired empirical expertise in the vacuum evaporation process, and 

the research centers in dairy powder are interested, until then, in drying technology (spray 

dryer). Study of vacuum concentration in dairy products is therefore a challenging and a 

fertile area for research in food processing engineering.

Chapter 2 
LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter aims to provide a literature background on the use of falling film 

evaporators in the dairy industry, and the characteristics of this process (energy 

consumption, product flow, fouling etc.). Many factors contribute to the dynamics of the 

vacuum evaporation process. In general this process involves heat and mass transfer. Other 

factors are related to the design of the evaporator (falling film, rising film, plate evaporators, 

etc.) and to product characteristics (viscosity, composition, surface tension, etc.). The 

physicochemical characteristics of milk and different designs of evaporators used in the 

dairy industry are described. The characteristics of dairy concentrates (viscosity, specific 

heat, enthalpy, etc.) and their flow during concentration in a falling film evaporator are also 

reported. Finally, the factors influencing fouling during vacuum evaporation are described. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The main aims of this chapter are to: 

- summarize the main characteristics of milk and dairy concentrates 

- introduce falling film evaporator equipment 

- describe the factors that contribute to the dynamics of the operation of FFE

2.1.   Transformation of milk to concentrated dairy products 

2.1.1.   Classification, composition and structure of milk 

Milk is a fluid secreted by mammalian females in order to satisfy the nutritional 

requirements of their neonates. It constitutes, therefore, a source of energy provided by 

lipids, lactose, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and water. It also has an important 

physiological role as it contains enzymes, hormones, antibacterial compounds, proteins and 

peptides (Fox and McSweeney, 2003). A wide range of factors can intervene in the 

composition of milk such as race, stage of lactation, health of the animal, season, animal 

feeding, etc. (Mahaut et al., 2000). Table 2.1 shows the average composition of bovine milk. 

Table 2.1. Average composition of bovine milk (Walstra et al., 1999). 

Component 
Average concentration 

(g·kg-1) 

Water 871.0 

Fat 40.0 

Proteins 32.5 

     Caseins 26.0 

     Whey proteins 6.0 

Lactose 46.0 

Minerals 7.0 

Organic acids 1.7 

Others 1.5 

 

The average pH value of bovine milk at 20°C is about 6.6 - 6.8. The substances 

dissolved in milk provide an average water activity of 0.995. Milk density (around 1029 kg·m³ 

at 20 °C) varies mainly due to the fat content. Although its viscosity is twice that of water, it 

behaves as a Newtonian fluid (Walstra et al., 2006). 



 

21 

 

The nitrogen content of milk is about 34.0 g·kg-1, divided into three groups: caseins, 

whey proteins and non-protein nitrogen. Casein and whey proteins differ according to their 

solubility at pH 4.6 (Croguennec et al., 2008). 

Casein represents 80% of the total milk proteins (Cayot and Lorient, 1998; Fox and 

Brodkorb, 2008; Horne, 2003). Casein in milk exists as large colloidal particles called “casein 

micelles” (Fox and Brodkorb, 2008). Casein micelles have a relatively wide size distribution, 

from less than 50 nm to more than 500 nm, with an average diameter of approximately 200 

nm (Horne, 2003). In their native state, casein micelles are hydrated particles containing 

several thousand ?S1-, ?S2-, ?- and ?-casein molecules as well as minerals, mainly colloidal 

calcium phosphate (CCP) (de Kruif, 1999; Panouillé et al., 2005). In milk at pH 6.7, casein 

micelles are electronegative, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.7. Caseins in the micelle 

structure are held together by hydrophobic interactions and by the presence of CCP. In 

physiological conditions, a “hairy layer” of the hydrophilic parts of ?-casein (about 10 nm 

thick and located at the surface of casein micelles) is responsible for steric and electro-

repulsive stabilization of casein micelles, thus producing a balanced colloidal system 

(Panouillé et al., 2005). 

In contrast to caseins, whey proteins are soluble at pH 4.6 in their native form. These 

proteins are heat-sensitive. The major whey protein constituents are ?-lactoglobulin (?-lg) 

and ?-lactoglobulin (? -lg). ?-lg is a globular protein with a molecular mass of 18.3 kDa that 

has a very compact structure due to the presence of many ? sheets. In milk at pH 6.7, ?-lg 

is in the form of a dimer held together by non-covalent interactions. This protein has a free 

sulfhydryl group that is not accessible in the native form of the protein. ?-la is a compact 

globular protein with a molecular weight of 14.2 kDa. This protein has an excellent amino 

acid profile, being rich in lysine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan and cystine (Kinsella and 



 

22 

 

Whitehead, 1989). Other minor whey proteins are also present in the soluble phase of milk, 

in particular bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins and lactoferrin.

Whatever the origin, milk consists of three phases: lipid phase; protein and mineral 

fraction in the colloidal state and a dispersing aqueous phase containing lactose, soluble 

proteins, minerals and vitamins (Croguennec et al., 2008). Fig. 2.1 (a) shows a transmission 

electron microscopy image of raw milk at room temperature in which these three phases 

can be identified: the lipid phase bounded by a membrane (milk fat globule membrane), 

casein micelles in suspension and the aqueous phase. The diameter of milk fat globules is 

between 0.1 µm and 10 µm. The average diameter of the fat globules (about 7 µm) is much 

larger than that of casein micelles (~ 120 nm) as shown in Fig. 2.1. Fig. 2.1 (b) shows the 

casein micelles (dark grey) and aqueous phase (light grey). 



 

23 

 

 

Figure 2.1. Raw milk at ambient temperature observed by transmission electron 

microscopy, (a) where fat is present  and (b) in the absence of fat (Tamine et al., 2007). 

The ability of milk to be processed into a variety of products is mainly due to the 

physicochemical characteristics of its proteins that confer various tecnofunctional properties 

(gelling, foaming, emulsifying, etc.) (Croguennec et al., 2008). Finally, milk is a system under 

dynamic equilibrium and several changes may occur on modifying its composition and 

structure. These changes may be physical (foaming), chemical (oxidation, lipolysis, 

proteolysis) and microbial (production of acid lactic). 

2.1.2.   Cracking of milk 

Milk is a constituent of many food products. If the milk components are available 

separately a wider range of functionalities properties such as foaming, emulsifying, etc., can 

be used for new applications. Fractionated milk components provide a more constant quality 

of consumer products and the development of new products, such as bio-active peptides. 

Milk fractionation therefore leads to a more efficient and diverse use of milk. Furthermore, 

working with concentrated streams may reduce the cost of transport significantly and also 

have environmental advantages. Membrane separation technology seems a logical choice 



 

24 

 

for the fractionation of milk, because many milk components can be separated on size (Fig. 

2.2). Membranes are already well established for the processing of whey and are gaining 

popularity in other dairy applications (Daufin et al., 2001). These processes lead to the 

fractionation of dairy components, i.e. the “cracking” of milk (Fig. 2.3) and whey (Fig. 2.4). 

Progress is still being made on the extent of fractionation of milk and whey using more 

specific combinations of membrane filtration and other separation techniques 

(electrodialysis, ion exchange, and chromatography) and/or chemical treatments (such as 

acidification or hydrolysis).

Once the component of interest has been extracted, the solution is very often 

concentrated and spray dried. The vacuum evaporation process is widely applied in the food 

industry for the concentration of solutions (Fig. 2.5). Although more energy expensive than 

membrane concentration processes (Table 2.3), this process yields more viscous products, 

which is not possible with membrane techniques.

The vacuum evaporation process is currently used before drying for production of 

dairy products (Gray, 1981) (Fig.2.5). According to Jebson and Iyer (1991), the cost of the 

energy required for the evaporation of milk is a major factor determining the production cost 

of milk powder.

2.2.   Vacuum evaporation 

Evaporation is a process used to remove a liquid from a solution, suspension, or 

emulsion by boiling off some of the liquid. It is thus a thermal separation or thermal 

concentration process. The evaporation process is defined as one that starts with a liquid 

product and ends up with a more concentrated, but still liquid and still pumped concentrate 

as the main product from the process (Kessler, 1981). There are in fact a few instances 

where the evaporated, volatile component, is the main product, but these are not discussed 

in this work. In the food domain evaporation is used for product concentration, volume 

reduction, water / solvent recovery and crystallization (Bimbenet et al., 2007). 

In the field of thermal separation / concentration technology, evaporation plants are 

widely used for concentration of liquids in the form of solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. 

The major requirement in the field of evaporation technology is to maintain the quality of the 

liquid during evaporation and to avoid damage to the product. This may require the liquid to 

be exposed to the lowest possible boiling temperature for the shortest period of time. In the 

food industry evaporation is performed at absolute pressures in the order of 0.02 MPa to 

0.09 MPa (pressures below atmospheric pressure). The term "vacuum" is therefore used to 

classify this process. 

In the dairy industry, vacuum evaporation is a process used for the production of final 

(sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.) (Gänzle et al., 2008), and intermediate 

products before any further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, coagulation or 

drying (infant formulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Schuck, 2002; 

Zhu et al., 2011). 



 

29 

 

2.2.1.   Evaporators 

An evaporator is the device or set of devices used to achieve evaporation. The 

destination of the vapor emitted is essential in the study of an evaporator. Even if there is 

no potential use, it is necessary to condense such vapor. The vapor to be condensed is 

generally used to heat the incoming products. This preheating serves to improve the energy 

use, and the functional operation of the evaporator, since the liquid enters the evaporator at 

a temperature close to its boiling temperature (Jeantet et al., 2011). 

For vacuum evaporators, the vapor emitted is aspirated into the condenser by a 

condenser pressure (Pc) lower than the evaporation pressure (Pev). Pc is controlled by the 

liquid-vapor equilibrium that exists within the condenser. This means that the lowest 

pressure that can be obtained in an evaporator is imposed by the temperature of the 

condensation of the product vapor in the condenser. The vacuum pump connected to the 

condenser is only responsible for evacuating the air out of the plant and for removing the 

incondensable gases. The amount of gases to be evacuated depends on the amount of gas 

dissolved in the product and especially of the quality of the vacuum tightness of the system 

(including pipes, pump seals, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007). 

There are two main types of condenser (Fig. 2.6): mixture condensers (the vapor 

emitted is cooled by mixing with cold water) and wall exchange condensers (tubular heat 

exchanger) (Kessler, 1981). The vapor can also be condensed by mechanical refrigeration 

(as in lyophilization) but this very expensive technology is justified only in special cases, i.e. 

flavor recovery in coffee (Bimbenet et al., 2007). 



 

30 

 

 

Figure 2.6. Diagram of: (A) mixture condensers, and (B) wall exchange condenser. 

While the design criteria for evaporators are the same regardless of the industry 

involved, two questions always exist: is this equipment best suited for the purpose and is 

the equipment arranged in the most efficient and economical way? As a result, many types 

of evaporator and many variations in processing techniques have been developed to take 

into account different product characteristics and operating parameters. The most common 

types of evaporators used currently are: 

? Rising film evaporators 
? Forced circulation evaporators 
? Plate evaporators 
? Falling film evaporators 

Other types of evaporator, include the inclined tube evaporator, forced-circulation 

evaporator, wiped film evaporator, etc. (Leleu, 1992).

2.2.1.1.  Rising film evaporators 

These evaporators operate on a "thermo-siphon" principle. Feed enters at the bottom 

of the heating tubes and as it heats, vapor begins to form (Fig. 2.7). The ascending force of 

this vapor produced during boiling causes liquid to flow upwards. At the same time vapor 

production increases and the product is pressed as a thin film on the walls of the tubes 

(Smith and Hui, 2008). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.7. Rising Film Evaporator (www.niroinc.com). 

This co-current upward movement has the beneficial effect of creating a high degree 

of turbulence in the liquid. This is advantageous during evaporation of highly viscous 

products. A large temperature difference is need between the heating and boiling sides of 

this type of evaporator, otherwise the energy of the vapor flow is not sufficient to convey the 

liquid and to produce the rising film. The length of the boiling tubes will typically not exceed 

7 meters. This type of evaporator is often used with product recirculation, where some of the

B: Vapor 

C: Concentrate 

D: Heating Steam 

E: Condensate 



 

32 

 

concentrate formed is reintroduced back to the feed inlet in order to produce sufficient liquid 

loading inside the boiling tubes. 

2.2.1.2.  Forced circulation evaporator 

Forced circulation evaporators (Fig. 2.8) are used if boiling of the product on the 

heating surfaces is to be avoided due to fouling or crystallization. The flow velocity in the 

tubes must be high, and high-capacity pumps are required. The circulating liquid is heated 

when it flows through the heat exchanger and then partially evaporated when the pressure 

is reduced in the separator, cooling the liquid to the boiling temperature (Smith and Hui, 

2008). 

 

Figure 2.8. Forced circulation evaporator (www.niroinc.com). 

The liquid is typically only heated a few degrees for each pass through the heat 

exchanger, which means the recirculation flow rate has to be high. This type of evaporator 

is also used for crystallizing applications because no evaporation and concentration take 

place on the heat transfer surface. Evaporation occurs as the liquid is flash evaporated in

the separator / flash vessel. In crystallizing applications this is then where the crystals form, 

and special separator designs are used to separate crystals from the recirculated crystal 

slurry. The heat exchanger can be arranged either horizontally or vertically depending on 

the specific requirements in each case. 

2.2.1.3.  Falling film evaporators 

The need, for an evaporator capable of functioning with a very small temperature 

difference between heat steam and product, imposed by shorter process times and 

operating economy led to the application of the falling film evaporation principle (Gray, 1981). 

With this arrangement the product is made to flow downwards in a film over the heating 

surface. The principal driving force is gravity. In contrast to the climbing film evaporators, 

high heat fluxes and temperature differences are not required to establish the desired flow 

conditions. The heat transfer surface may be in the form of either tubes or plates, but 

capacity limitations of the falling film plate evaporator have led to the tubular version being 

much more widely applied (Gray, 1981). The falling film tubular evaporator is currently the 

standard type used in the dairy industry. 

In falling film evaporators (FFE) (Fig. 2.9), liquid and vapors flow downwards in 

parallel. The liquid to be concentrated is preheated to boiling temperature. An even thin film 

enters the heating tubes via a distributor system in the head of the evaporator, flows 

downward at boiling temperature, and is partially evaporated. This gravity-induced 

downward movement is increasingly augmented by the co-current vapor flow.

However, falling film evaporators must be designed very carefully for each operating 

condition; sufficient wetting of the heating surface by liquid is extremely important for trouble-

free operation of the plant (Morison et al., 2006). Due the low liquid holding volume in this 

type of unit, the falling film evaporator can be started up quickly and changed to cleaning 

mode or another product easily. The fact that falling film evaporators can be operated with 

small temperature differences makes it possible to use them in multiple effect configurations 

with very low energy consumption.

2.2.2.   Energy efficiency 

To become even more energy efficient the vapor produced in one falling film 

evaporator can be used to heat another evaporator operating at a lower pressure and 

temperature. The first evaporator thus acts as a "boiler" for the second. Similarly, the second 

serves as a condenser for the first (Fig. 2.10). This way of recycling the water vapor 

continuously in series is often termed multi-effect evaporation. With n evaporators added in 

series to recycle the water vapor for use in the next evaporator, the energy usage can be 

decreased by approximately 1/neffects.

costs (IC); the consumption costs (CC) of heating steam, water, electricity, etc.; and the staff 

cost (SC). These various costs vary with the number of effects n (Fig. 2.11).

numbers of effects. IC = investment cost; CC = cost of consumption; SC = staff costs and 

TC = total cost = IC + CC + SC (Jeantet et al., 2011). 

The curve of the total cost (Fig. 2.11) passes through a minimum for a given n value. 

This number rounded to the nearest whole number, is the optimum number of technical and 

economic effects. 

In order to reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact, it is important 

that evaporators operate at their maximum capacity, which is highly dependent on the 

overall heat transfer coefficient. This parameter cannot be considered as an intrinsic 

characteristic of the evaporator, since it also depends on the nature of the product and on 

their flow conditions (Mafart, 1991). The factors that control heat transfer in the evaporator 

tubes are important for close monitoring of the evaporation process and for the calculation 

of the evaporators dimensions (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991).

2.2.2.1.  Heat transfer coefficient 

Knowing the heat transfer coefficient is essential to monitor the evaporation process 

closely. In most dairy factories the total energy usage is known, but often information on the 

quantities of energy used for individual processes is lacking (Jebson and Chen, 1997). 

For all types of evaporator, the evaporation rate depends on the heating power (Q?), 
which depends on the overall heat transfer coefficient (U), the heat exchange area (A), and 

the temperature difference between the heating steam and the boiling liquid, ??, Eq. 2.1: 

Q? = ? ·  A · ?? Eq. 2.1 
The design, optimization and investment costs of the unit are thus strongly 

dependent on the predicted value of this variable (Prost et al., 2006). 

The inverse overall heat transfer coefficient (1/U) for a given effect is resistance 

resulting from four resistances in series: the resistance of the heating steam side (1/hv), the 

resistance of conduction through the wall (em/?m), the resistance of an eventual fouling layer 

(Rfouling) and the resistance of the product (1/hp) (Fig. 2.12, Eq. 2.2).

The heating steam condenses to form a film condensate along the external wall of 

the evaporator tube. The steam heat transfer coefficient is in the order of 5,000 W·m-2·°C-1 

to 15,000 W·m-2·°C-1. hV-1 can be calculated by equations based on the Nusselt number (Eq.

2.3) (Adib et al., 2009), eventually adjusted to take into account of the shape and 

arrangement of the heating surfaces, the speed of the heat steam, the presence of non-

condensable gas, the surface condition of the wall, etc. (Bouman et al., 1993). 

N? = ?.6?? ? R????  Eq. 2.3 
where 

N? = ?????? ? ????????? Eq. 2.4 
where hv is the heat transfer coefficient of the condensing steam (kW·m-2·°C-1), Re 

the Reynolds number (-), ? the viscosity of the condensate steam (Pa?s), ? the density of 

the condensate steam (kg·m-3), and g the gravity acceleration (m·s-2) 

The heat transfer coefficient through the wall, (
????), is easier to calculate, because 

the thermal conductivity coefficients of the materials constituting the exchange surfaces are 

known, as well the wall thickness. These coefficients are generally high, in the order of 10 

kW·m-2·°C-1 to 20 kW·m-2·°C-1, which corresponds to a low thermal resistance, that can often 

be disregarded. 

The potential fouling layer must be taken into account in the calculation of the overall 

heat transfer coefficient. Fouling of heat transfer surfaces is one of greater problems in heat 

transfer equipment. 

Generally the product heat transfer coefficient, hp, is the most difficult to predict, and 

often it is the limiting factor for the heat transfer, especially for viscous concentrates. The 

heat transfer coefficient for pure water evaporated at ?? = 10°C is in the order of 6 kW·m-

2·°C-1 to 15 kW·m-2·°C-1. According to many authors (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Miranda and 

Simpson, 2005; etc.), hp depends on several factors such as physical properties of the 



 

40 

 

treated product (viscosity ?p, surface tension jp, density ?p, etc.); process conditions (heat 

flux, temperature difference ??, boiling temperature ?p); and nature and geometry of the 

heating surface, (roughness R, etc.). These factors are summarized in Eq. 2.5. 

h? = f???, ??, ??, C?? … ??, R, etc. ? Eq. 2.5 
where jp is the product surface tension (N·m-1) and Cpp the product specific heat    

(kJ·kg-1·°C-1)In this work, only the overall heat transfer coefficient U (kW·m-2·C-1) (Eq. 2.1) is 

discussed. For falling film evaporators this coefficient are in order of 1 kW·m-2·°C-1 to 8 kW·m-

2·°C-1 (Bimbenet et al., 2007). 

2.3.   Thermo-physical properties of dairy concentrates 

Estimation of U in all chemical engineering formulas currently available in the 

literature is connected to thermo-physical properties of products. These thermo-physical 

properties (?p, ?p, ?p ...) generally vary with the concentration and temperature of the product, 

and possibly also as a function of shear rate in the case of a non-Newtonian fluid. 

2.3.1.   Viscosity of dairy concentrates 

The rheological behavior of dairy concentrates changes during the evaporation 

process due the changes in the product concentration and temperature. It can be modified 

by the shear rate, expressed by the velocity gradient, ?? (s-1): 
 ?? = ???? Eq. 2.6 
Therefore the apparent viscosity, ?a, is used to represent and classify the flow profile 

of dairy concentrates. This defined as: 

?? = ??? Eq. 2.7 



 

41 

 

where ? is the shear stress (Pa) 
According to the relationship between the shear stress and the shear rate presented 

in Eq. 2.7, two types of rheological behavior can be distinguished (Fig. 2.13). 

 

Figure 2.13. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. 

For Newtonian fluid the viscosity only depends on the temperature and concentration. 

On the other hand for the Non-Newtonian fluids the viscosity depends on the shear rate in 

addition to the temperature and concentration. 

2.3.2.  Thermal properties of dairy concentrates 

Some thermal properties of dairy concentrates can be used for the estimation of heat 

transfer coefficients and enthalpy balances for an evaporator. These properties are: 

• Specific heat Cp (kJ·kg-1·°C-1) 

Shear thinning 

Newtonian 

Dilatants 

Non-Newtonian 

? (Pa) 



 

42 

 

At temperature ?, Cp is the amount of heat (in kJ) to be supplied to 1 kg of product, 

to raise its temperature by 1°C. 

• Specific enthalpy: (kJ·kg-1) 

The specific enthalpy of a solution depends on its temperature and composition. For 

a solution composed of sugars, salts, proteins and lipids, such as dairy concentrates, the 

specific enthalpy can be calculated according to Rahman, 2009: 

H? = C? ? ?? Eq. 2.9 
The specific enthalpy of the water vapor emitted at temperature ?p of the concentrate 

is given by the following equation: 

H??? = ?.?? ? ???? + ?H? Eq. 2.10 
• Enthalpy of vaporization: ?Hv (kJ·kg-1) 

The enthalpy of vaporization, also known as the latent heat of vaporization or heat 

of evaporation, is the energy required to transform a given quantity of a substance from a 

liquid into a gas at a given pressure. For example the ?HV for pure water at 100°C = 2258 

kJ·kg-1. 

For a food product, the binding of water on the solute will result in a boiling point 

elevation, i.e. a saccharose solution at 700 g·kg-1 of total solids has a boiling point elevation 

around 2.7°C when concentrated at 80°C (Bimbenet et al., 2007). 

• Thermal conductivity ? (W·m-1·°C-1): 

Thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat. It can be defined 

as the quantity of heat transmitted through a unit thickness of a material - in a direction 



 

43 

 

normal to a surface of unit area - due to a unit temperature gradient under steady state 

conditions. The skim and whole milk thermal conductivity is around 0.563·10-3 kW·m-1·°C-1 

and 0.537·10-3 kW·m-1·°C-1, respectively. 

 

2.4.   Flow in falling film evaporators 

In FFE a complete film should be maintained inside the tubes over the process time. 

This requires that the liquid is first distributed to all the tubes to provide sufficient flow. The 

film must then be maintained down the tubes. Film breakdown (Fig. 2.14) will decrease the 

efficiency of the process and may cause excessive fouling (Paramalingam et al., 2000). 

 

Figure 2.14. Film breakdown (Hartley and Murgatroyd, 1964; Morison et al., 2006). 

In an industrial evaporator a distributor system is installed above the top tube sheet. 

A falling-film distributor (Fig. 2.15) is a critical component in the evaporator, which makes 

the liquid flow evenly inside the tube and affects the production capacity and service life of 

the evaporator. Unfortunately, industrial liquid film distributors have certain shortcomings, 



 

44 

 

such as structural complexity, large area, high requirement for production and processing 

precision, poor uniformity and wettability of falling film (Anurjew et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011). 

 

 

Figure 2.15. Plan of a typical distributor system for a falling film evaporator tube 

(www.gea.com). 

The flow in falling film evaporators is often characterized by using dimensionless 

numbers. The most important parameter is the film Reynolds number (Ref), which measures 

the extent of the inertia relative to viscous effects. 

Re? = ? ?? Eq. 2.11 
where ? is the mass flow rate per unit circumference of the tube (kg·m-1·s-1) and ? 

the apparent viscosity of the product (Pa·s). 

? is measured according to equation 2.12: 



 

45 

 

? = ???? Eq. 2.12 
where m? is the concentrate mass flow rate (kg·s-1) and D the inner diameter of the 

tube (m). 

There are many different classifications of falling film flows in the literature. 

Grossman and Heath (1984) divided the flow into three regimes, smooth laminar, transition 

region and fully turbulent flow, where the transition region can in turn be divided into different 

regions. Numrich (1992) divided the flow into only two regions, the laminar and the turbulent. 

Bird et al. (1960) established the flow profiles in three regions: laminar, laminar with waves 

and turbulent. What varies between these different classifications is how the transition from 

laminar to turbulent flow is handled. 

2.4.1.  Residence time distribution functions 

The residence time distribution (RTD) of fluids passing through a food processing 

plant can be important for public safety and product quality reasons. It is often assumed for 

design purposes that either a laminar or plug flow regime exists and that the residence times 

can be calculated from volume and flow rate (Janssen, 1994). Moreover, in falling film 

evaporators the product flows in a thin layer in the evaporations tubes, thus making it difficult, 

to determine plant volume accurately. For such situations, it is necessary to measure the 

plant RTD directly. 

The mathematics and techniques for RTD determination were developed in the field 

of chemical engineering (Danckwerts, 1953). The most common technique is injecting an 

inert tracer into the feed stream and measuring the concentration in the product stream over 

time (Fig. 2.16). 



 

46 

 

 

Figure 2.16. Diagram of measurement of tracer for calculation of residence time 
distribution. 

Each element of fluid takes a different route and time through the processing unit. 

The distribution of these times at the outlet of the unit is called the E-curve or age distribution 

function, E(t), which characterizes the residence time distribution (RTD) of the process. The 

simplest way to obtain the E(t) is by the pulse experiment, where a small amount of a non-

reactive tracer is injected simultaneously at the unit inlet and its concentration is 

continuously recorded at the outlet C(t) (Fig. 2.16). The E-curve is then obtained from Eq. 

(2.13), where C0 is the total tracer concentration (Levenspiel, 1999). 

E?t? = ???????? ??????? ????  Eq. 2.13 
? E?t?dt = ???  Eq. 2.14 
Since the pioneering work of Danckwerts (1953), the RTD theory has been widely 

developed and is nowadays used in a more general context in order to determine a 

population balance model (Villermaux, 1982), where the basis of this model is that the 

number of entities with certain properties in a system is a balanceable quantity. Such 

properties include size, mass, and age. RTD theory is also used to optimize the process in 

terms of capital and operation costs (Malcata, 1991). The latter represent an essential step 

in managing and controlling the quality of food products. Burton et al., (1959) applied the 

concept of RTD to food engineering in order to calculate the sterilizing effectiveness of a 

Tracer injection

UHT apparatus for milk processing. Baloh (1979) showed that the loss of sugar in 

pasteurization and evaporation processes of various processing schemes in the sugar 

industry could be significantly lowered by reducing the mean residence time of sweet juice. 

Thor and Loncin (1978) established the mechanisms of rinsing (e.g. mass flow rate and 

shear stress) of a plate heat exchanger by the measurement of RTD, and thereby laid down 

the basis for optimizing the rinsing of equipment in food engineering. Jeantet et al. (2008) 

calculated and modeled the RTD for different sections of a spray-dryer tower for skim milk, 

and described the heat treatment that the product was subjected in this process. 

For tube flow, the RTD is associated with the velocity profile and the dispersion flow 

of the product. Determination of the product RTD is an overall and experimental approach 

which provides valuable information about the product flow profile in the evaporator, 

according to the operating conditions. It does not provide a good physical understanding of 

the operation as computational fluid dynamics does but it integrates the product and process 

complexity fully. 

2.4.2.  Residence time distribution models 

Ideal flow models such as plug flow, and perfectly mixed tank and laminar flow rarely 

reflect a real system with enough accuracy. Non-ideal models are usually derived from ideal 

models to account for deviations implicit in real systems (Torres and Oliveira, 1998). Models 

with one parameter, such as the well-known dispersion model, are usually more appropriate 

to represent tubular systems (Levenspiel and Bischoff, 1963). In this section, two single 

parameter models are presented which have mainly been used to fit the experimental RTD 

data for food reactors. The dimensionless E-curves of these models are illustrated in Fig. 

2.16 and 2.17, where the effects of the model parameter can be observed. 



 

48 

 

2.4.2.1. Axial dispersion 

The axial dispersion model can be used to represent small deviations from plug flow, 

as well as other non-ideal flow patterns in tubular systems. It has been widely applied to 

describe the flow in tubes and is the most frequent choice to model flow in holding tubes in 

aseptic processing (Torres and Oliveira, 1998). The model parameter is the Peclet number, 

which is defined for tube flow as: 

P? = L ? ??a? Eq. 2.15 
where L is the tube length (m), ? the mean velocity (m·s-1) and Dax the axial diffusion 

coefficient (-) 

This dimensionless number represents the relation between advection (flow) and 

diffusion. When Pe approaches infinity, negligible dispersion is observed (ideal plug flow). 

When Pe approaches zero, wide dispersion is observed (perfectly mixed tank) (Fig. 2.17).

2.4.2.2. Extended tanks in series 

The extended tanks in series model are based on a series of perfectly mixed tanks 

and can be used to represent deviations from plug flow and to represent real stirred tanks. 

The E function for this model is presented in Eq. 2.17, where the parameter being modeled 

is the number of tanks, N.

distribution model (Villermaux, 1993). 

2.5.  Fouling in falling film evaporators 

Fouling is defined as the formation of deposits from the product on heat exchange 

surfaces which impede the heat transfer. In FFE a fouling layer accumulates on the inner 

wall of the evaporator tubes during processing (Jeurnink et al., 1996) leading to a decrease 

in the heat transfer coefficient, increased pressure drop, and the formation of a biofilm, thus 

impeding the optimal functioning of the evaporator equipment (Langeveld et al., 1990; Visser 

and Jeurnink, 1997). 

Due to fouling that decreases the heat transfer coefficient, most evaporators do not 

have a constant production capacity. In petrochemical industries, pipe cleaning is carried 

out once a year, whereas in food-processing industries, it has to be done at least once a 



 

51 

 

day (Ozden and Puri, 2010). The high frequency of cleaning periods results in a shorter 

production time and higher consumption of water and cleaning agents, leading to high 

economic costs and ecological problems (Jimenez et al., 2013). 

Milk fouling can be classified in two categories (Burton et al., 1959; Changani et al., 

1997; Visser and Jeurnink, 1997): Type A (protein) where fouling takes place at 

temperatures between 75°C and 110°C, and the deposits are white, soft, and spongy (milk 

film); and type B (mineral) where fouling takes place at temperatures above 110°C. Type B 

deposits are hard, compact, granular in structure, and gray in color (milk stone) (Table 2.4). 

Table 2.4. Composition of the two milk fouling categories (modified from Bansal and 

Chen, 2005). 

Composition 
Milk fouling  category 

Type A Type B 

Proteins (g·kg-1) 500 to 700 150 to 200 
Minerals (g·kg-1) 300 to 400 700 to 800 

Fat (g·kg-1) 40 to 80 40 to 80 

 

Vacuum evaporators can be considered as heat exchangers in a first approach, 

where the main mechanism factors likely to generate fouling during the heat treatment of 

milk are: the formation and subsequent deposition of activated whey protein molecules; the 

precipitation of minerals as a result of the decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates with 

increasing temperature; and the temperature difference between the heating surface and 

the liquid to be heated (Lalande and Tissier, 1985; Paterson, 1988). 

During heat treatment, fouling is particularly problematic with concentrated products. 

Schraml and Kessler (1994), found that fouling during pasteurization of whey products 

increased to a maximum concentration of 250 g·kg-1 of total solids (TS), after which 



 

52 

 

deposition decreased. The decrease was thought to result from two competing mechanisms: 

aggregation of whey proteins and crystallization of salts (Fryer et al., 2011). 

In general, the ability to transfer heat efficiently remains a central feature in the 

production of dairy products. Much attention has therefore been paid to improving the 

understanding of heat transfer mechanisms and the development of suitable correlations 

and techniques that may be applied to the design of vacuum evaporation. On the other hand, 

relatively little consideration has been given to the problem of surface fouling in FFE. Most 

of studies of the fouling and cleaning in the food engineering domain have focused on 

pasteurization and sterilization processes, where the temperatures are higher than 70°C. 

Chen and Bala (1998) showed that surface temperatures need to be above 70°C for 

significant surface fouling of milk to occur, but most milk evaporators parts operate below 

this temperature (Morison, 2015). Therefore, most of the fouling occurring in milk 

evaporators should not be assumed to be the same as that occurring in sterilizers and 

pasteurizers.

Chapter 3 
AIMS AND STRATEGY OF THE PHD PROJECT 

This chapter describes the aims and the strategy of this PhD project. Based on the 

progress in dairy powder technology, and the importance of the vacuum evaporation 

process in terms of energy consumption and final powder quality, this part sets out the 

research area and outlines the research questions of the project. This study focused mainly 

on the performance of falling film evaporators during concentration of different dairy products, 

including skim milk, whole milk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey, at different concentrations. 

The innovative aspect of this project is the use of a pilot-scale, single-stage falling film 

evaporator that describes the same process as that of an industrial scale from a 

hydrodynamic point of view, and the development of a methodology for the calculation and 

modeling of the residence time distribution functions. The effectiveness of evaporation, the 

heat transfer coefficient, the extent of fouling formation, the flow behavior and the dispersion 

of the residence time could thus be identified over the processing time. This PhD project has 

benefited from close collaboration with GEA (Process Engineering - France), AgroParisTech 

(Massy – France), Federal University of Viçosa (Brazil) and INRA STLO (Science and 

Technology of Milk and Eggs) Research laboratory. 

 

 

 

The main aims of this chapter are to:  

- define the PhD research area and outline the research questions 

- introduce the innovative hydrodynamic characterization methodology 

- highlight the multidisciplinary aspects of this research

3.1.   Context of the PhD project 

The vacuum evaporation process has an important role in the economic aspects of 

the world market for dairy powders, which has been considerably expanding as previously 

stated (Fig. 1.3). Indeed, this process is quasi systematically applied in the dairy industry for 

the concentration of solutions prior to the drying step: dairy products must be concentrated 

to a maximum total solids content around 500 g·kg-1 to 550 g·kg-1, 550 g·kg-1 to 600 g·kg-1, 

and 200 g·kg-1 to 250 g·kg-1 for skim milk, whey and whey protein isolates, respectively, as 

below this value the concentrated product cannot be atomized in the spray-dryer (Schuck, 

2002). Besides, the energy used in multi stage evaporators is about 10 times less than that 

used in a spray-dryer, and evaporation is therefore used to remove the maximum amount 

of water from the product, while maintaining the physicochemical and microbiological quality 

of the liquid.  

The evaporation process has a major influence on the final powder quality, e.g. an 

increase in the concentrate viscosity will lead to a decrease in the powder bulk density, and 

an increase in powder solubility, porosity and wettability, etc. (Fergusson, 1989). However 

the increase of the concentrate viscosity leads to an increase in the powder bulk density 

according to Minton (1986). The milk powders properties is also affected by the thermal heat 

treatment during the evaporation process, as in the spray dryer the thermal effects on the 

product can be disregarded due to the very low residence time and temperature. The 

evaporation process can also cause issues with microbiological powder quality, since 

thermoduric bacteria tend to grow during the vacuum evaporation process (Crossley and 

Campling, 1957; Murphy et al., 1999). 

The control of vacuum evaporators operation is still a challenge due to the complexity 

of their closed geometry and process - product interactions (e.g. fouling of tubes). The dairy 

industry already knows the key operating parameters which must be controlled to obtain a 



 

57 

 

concentrate with a specific composition and how to identify irregularities in the production 

line (e.g. fouling in the evaporation tubes). However, this knowledge is usually obtained 

empirically, and therefore there is a lack of information regarding the energy consumption 

of the vacuum evaporation process, the product flow profile during concentration, the optimal 

effectiveness of evaporation and which operating parameters need to be monitored to obtain 

final products of controlled composition. This is why a better understanding of the 

thermodynamic and hydrodynamic phenomena is needed to determine which operating 

parameters need to be monitored to improve the performance of evaporators and to control 

the final properties of the concentrates. Finally, it appears necessary to improve 

understanding of the effects of the interaction of the product and operating parameters on 

the performance of falling film evaporators. 

It is of note that, there are few scientific papers related to the vacuum evaporation 

process despite its wide use in the dairy industry. The few available papers focused mainly 

on calculation of the heat transfer coefficient of different solutions (Ali Adib and Vasseur, 

2008; Chun and Seban, 1971; Monnier et al., 2012; Prost et al., 2006), on evaporation 

process was carried out with industrial equipment, and therefore the initial composition of 

the product and the operating parameters were not fully controlled (due to large-scale 

production) (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Jebson and Chen, 1997). Others 

used laboratory-scale falling film evaporators, where the hydrodynamic profile of the fluids 

is not the same as that found on an industrial scale (Adib et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2011; 

Monnier et al., 2012; Park et al., 2004; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012). 

An equipment representative of the same process as the industrial scale was 

therefore needed to study the vacuum evaporation process and to improve understanding 

of the effects of the operating parameters on the process performance and product quality. 

These issues are the basis for this PhD framework.

3.2.  Aims, objectives and strategy 

The main aim of the PhD project was to provide some answers regarding the 

performance of evaporators during the concentration of dairy products, by means of 

thermodynamic and hydrodynamic approaches relating the interactions between products 

properties and operating parameters. 

A prototype of a pilot-scale, single-stage falling film evaporator was therefore used 

to tackle these issues. This equipment was designed according to specifications established 

by INRA STLO (Science and Technology of Milk and Eggs) Research laboratory, to describe 

the same process as the industrial scale from a hydrodynamic point of view. As it is possible 

to perform evaporation at a constant temperature with this pilot evaporator (whereas in 

industrial scale evaporators temperature evolves over time), the time / temperature / 

concentration triplet was simplified to a binomial time / concentration approach. 

The first stage of this PhD project was therefore to characterize the pilot vacuum 

evaporator, with instrumentation of the pilot (choice and positioning of the different sensors) 

and setting of the thermodynamic balances. This information allowed the determination of 

the operating process range for maximum effectiveness of evaporation of pure water, skim 

and whole milk (Chapter 5). 

After the thermodynamic characterization of the evaporator, hydrodynamic 

characterization was undertaken (second stage of this PhD project). The hydrodynamic 

profile of water and skim milk were determined using Reynolds number and residence time 

distribution (RTD) functions. In addition to provide important information relating to the 

product flow profile in the evaporator, RTD functions also provided the time that the product 

spent in the evaporator. As the product temperature in this equipment may be kept constant, 



 

59 

 

the profile                       time / temperature can be accessed. These RTD functions were 

modeled and a physical interpretation of the model was obtained (Chapter 6). 

The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the evaporation process 

was performed with other dairy products such as sweet and acid lactic whey. These 

approaches indicated the fouling formation during concentration in a falling film evaporator 

(Chapter 7). 

3.3.  Originality of the research project 

The PhD project has had to combine fundamental and experimental information on 

the “concentration phenomenon” and aspects related to the flow profile during concentration 

of different dairy products in a falling film evaporator. The project consisted of an 

experimental study, where the results of which could be used to improve process 

performance, control and quality in the dairy industry. A prototype pilot vacuum evaporator 

was characterized and instrumented, which are essential steps for further studies of the 

interactions between product and process, and process performance as regards the 

processing time and cleaning efficiency. 

Methodology was developed for the measurement of residence time distribution 

functions of real products in a falling film evaporator. To date this approach has been used 

in cases where the product composition remained constant before and after the process 

(e.g. pasteurizers) or with model solutions, which do not represent the complexity of a real 

solution, such as skim milk. The difficulty for calculation the RTD in the vacuum evaporator 

equipment is the changes occurring in the product throughout the process, due to increase 

in the concentration. The product properties and their interactions with the evaporator 

equipment therefore change over the process time. An approach was also proposed for 

modeling these RTD functions. Due to thorough understanding of the process, a physical 



 

60 

 

interpretation of the RTD is proposed, which provides important information related to the 

flow of different dairy products, such as skim milk, sweet whet and lactic acid whey during 

its concentration in a falling film evaporator.

4.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator 

A pilot scale, single stage falling-film evaporator (GEA Process Engineering, St 

Quentin-en-Yvelines, France; Fig. 4.1) was used for the characterization of the vacuum 

evaporation process. From the hydrodynamic point of view, the working of this equipment is 

close to that used in the dairy industry, i.e. the product falls in a trickling film along the inner 

wall of the evaporator tube, with indirect counter-flow contact with primary steam. The 

equipment consists of three evaporation tubes connected in series (Fig. 4.1), whose the 

dimensions are shown in Table 4.1.

The inlet product, concentrate and condensate are circulated by means of five 

circulation pumps (Fig. 4.1 - CP) (Pompes AB, Maurepas, France) with the same 

characteristics (centrifugal type, 0.7 kW). 

Each evaporation tube is thermally insulated and has an independent electrical 

heating system (Fig. 4.2) that provides the vaporization energy. As the vapor emitted by the 

product (secondary vapor) is not used for heating the product in the next tube, this pilot is a 

single stage evaporator. A level sensor (Fig. 4.2) is used to inject water at maximum 

temperature of 20°C into the heating systems when the level of water is below the sensor. 

The aim of this sensor is to ensure that the electric resistances are always immersed in 

water. The production of steam in this equipment is therefore discontinuous, because from 

the moment that water is inserted the temperature of the steam side decrease and therefore 

steam production ceases. The steam production is reestablished when water is heated to 

steam vaporization temperature. Water can be inserted manually or automatically through a 



 

67 

 

water injection electro valve (Burkert, Triembach au Val, France). When automatically 

injection was set the time of water injection is around 30 min of the process time, against 

around 60 min of process time for manually injection. 

Concentration of the solutions was performed at a total heating power of 25.20 ± 

0.05 kW (8.40 ± 0.02 kW for each tube), corresponding to the maximum heating power of 

the equipment. 

 

Figure 4.2. Evaporation tube with independent electrical heating system. 

The secondary vapor of the three evaporation tubes are separated in a separator 

with an integrated indirect condenser (coil-type heat exchanger) (Fig. 4.3). As the secondary 

vapor (product vapor) is condensed in the condenser, the pressure in the system is reduced

(Ptotal &amp;lt;0.1 MPa), which leads to a decrease of the evaporation temperature. The 

experiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa and thus the 

evaporation temperature (?ev) was maintained at 60°C throughout the three tubes. This 

temperature was the most commonly used for concentration of milk in the first stage of 

industrial vacuum evaporators. The temperature is controlled by the mass flow rate of the 

cooling water (ranging between 300 kg·h-1 to 800 kg·h-1) at a maximum temperature of 20°C. 

A vacuum pump (Fig. 4.3) (liquid ring type, 1.1 kW power consumption) connected to the 

condenser is required for the starting phase and to extract the non-condensable gases, 

which would otherwise accumulate in the condenser.

4.2.1.  Acquisition 

The initial configuration of the pilot had fifteen temperature probes, one pressure 

sensor and three flowmeters, as well as one data acquisition system (Endress Hauser, 

Huningue, France). Fig. 4.4 shows the position of these sensors.

Temperature probes (Endress Hauser, Huningue, France) were used to record the 

temperatures of the product at the bottom of each tube, inlet and outlet steam, condensate 

steam, and inlet and outlet cooling water. The flow rate of the inlet product, concentrate and 

cooling water were measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter (Krohne, Romans Sur Isere, 

France). The pressure was measured with a pressure sensor (Endress Hauser, Huningue, 

France) in the condenser, which has the same pressure inside the evaporator tubes. 

The product enters at the top of the evaporator tubes and it is dispersed by a plate 

distributor (Fig. 4.5). The aim of this piece is to ensure that a complete film, with thickness 

around 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm, is maintained inside the tubes throughout the process time.

4.2.2.  Additional instrumentation 

Some modifications were made on the pilot to improve its instrumentation and to 

obtain more data about the working of the equipment. Two flowmeters (electromagnetic type 

- Krohne, Romans Sur Isere, France) and three conductivity probes (Endress Hauser, 

Huningue, France) were added. A cone-shaped concave distributor system (Fig. 4.6) was 

also built (to ensure that a complete film was maintained inside the tubes at all times), and 

a heat exchanger was added in the product inlet line. Fig. 4.7 shows the first evaporator 

tube with all installed sensors. Aside from the preheater, the other two tubes have the same 

sensors in similar positions.

4.3.   Calibration of the vacuum evaporator sensors 

Temperatures, conductivity probes and flowmeters were calibrated when these 

sensors were installed. The temperature probes were calibrated at two temperatures, 0°C 

and 80°C. The difference between the reference and the acquisition temperatures was 

always less than 0.5°C. For calibration of the flowmeters, the volume flow rate of water 

measured by the control panel system was compared with the mass flow rate measured 

with a graduated test tube and a chronometer. As the conductivity of the solutions studied 

was in the order of 0.01 mS·cm-1 to 100 mS·cm-1, the conductivity probes were calibrated 

with a standard solution (Hanna Instruments, Inc., Tanneries, France) with conductivity 

between 0.05 and 200 mS·cm-1. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the measured and 

the calculated flow rate and conductivity was greater than 0.99. 

4.3.   Experimental runs 

Experimental runs were carried out with water, skim milk, sweet whey and lactic acid 

whey. 

Skim milk was reconstituted from low heat skim milk powder (Lactalis ingredients, 

Bourgbarré, France). Fresh concentrated sweet whey and lactic acid whey were obtained 

from an industrial cheese manufacturer in Brittany (France). Before entering the evaporator 

the products were preheated to the evaporation temperature in a jacketed tank, at the initial 

evaporator configuration, and in a tubular indirect preheater (Fig. 4.7) after the additional 

instrumentation. When desired, after passing of the entire product through the three 

evaporation tubes (Fig. 4.1) (first run – 1R), the entire volume of the product obtained at the 

end of the first run (still at the evaporation temperature) was reintroduced into the equipment 



 

74 

 

and re-concentrated a second time, again passing through the three evaporation tubes 

(second run – 2R). This operation could be performed once more (third run – 3R). 

The vacuum evaporator was divided in four different sections (Fig. 4.8). ? 
corresponds to the section from the feed to the bottom of the first tube; ? the section from 
the bottom of the first tube to the bottom of the second tube; ? the section from the bottom 
of the second tube to the bottom of the third tube; and ? the section from the feed to the 
evaporator outlet.

4.4.   Physicochemical analyses 

4.4.1.  Total solids 

The feed and final total solids content (TS) were calculated according to weight loss 

after drying 5 g of each sample with sand in a forced air oven at 105 °C for 7 h. 

Due the low pressure of the process, it was not possible take a sample of the product 

at the bottom of the first and second tube without affecting the process parameters 

(decrease in the pressure process, product flow rate, temperature, etc.). Therefore the TS 

were calculated at these two points (mass balance) as: 

TS???? = ??i?i ·??i?i?????i  Eq. 4.1 
where m???i  is the inlet mass flow rate of the product in tube i, TS??i corresponding to 

the total solids of the inlet product at the bottom of tube i, and m????i corresponding to the 
outlet mass flow rate of the product in tube i.  

4.4.2.  Viscosity measurement 

Viscosity measurements were obtained at the evaporation temperature with a 

Physica MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) using a coaxial aluminum cylinder 

(inner radius 23.05 mm; outer radius 25 mm; height of rotor 30 mm; gap 5 mm). Shear rates 

between 10·s-1 and 1000·s-1 at the evaporation temperature were used for rheological 

determinations. As the solutions studied behave as a non-Newtonian fluid at high 



 

76 

 

concentrations, apparent viscosity at a shear rate of 100·s-1 (?100) was used to make 

comparisons between the different products. This shear rate value was chosen because it 

is representative of the value reached in agitation, flow in tubes and other industrial 

operations (Steffe, 1996). As it was not possible to take samples at the bottom of T1 and T2, 

calibration curves of apparent viscosity were obtained (?100) as a function of product total 

solids (Fig. 4.9). 

 

Figure 4.9. Skim milk apparent viscosity (?100) measured at 60°C in function of total 

solids contents. 

4.4.3.  Density measurements 

A Mettler-Toledo densimeter DE40 (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, USA) was used to 

determine the density of the products at 60°C. The product density was used to convert the 

liquid flow rate (measured by the flowmeters) to mass flow rate.

4.4.4.  Conductivity 

The conductivity of the product was measured and recorded every second at the 

bottom of the three tubes (Fig. 4.7 (SP)) by conductivity-meter (Endress Hauser SAS, 

Huningue, France).  

4.4.5.  Protein composition 

Non-casein nitrogen (NCN) and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) fractions were 

determined by the Kjeldhal method (IDF, 1993). Nitrogen content was converted into 

equivalent protein content using 6.38 as converting factor for NCN and NPN content, 

respectively. Whey protein content (WPC) was calculated as WPC = NCN·6.38 ? NPN·6.38. 

4.4.6.  Ash content 

Ash content was determined by incinerating 5 g of the product in a muffle furnace at 

550°C for 5 hours (IDF, 1964). 

4.4.7.  Calcium concentration 

Calcium concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian 

220FS SpectrAA, Les Ulis, France) (Le Graët and Brulé, 1993). 

4.5.  Mass and enthalpy balance 

Fig. 4.10 provides a diagram representing the mass flow rate and the physical 

characteristics of the fluids in the evaporator. Each fluid is characterized by its mass flow 

rate (m? in kg·h-1), temperature (? in °C), pressure (P in MPa) and enthalpy (H in kJ·kg-1).

As seen in Fig. 4.10, the overall mass balance was calculated as: 

m????  +  m??i?  + m???i? =  m?P???  +  m???  +  m???  + m??????  Eq. 4.2 
In this pilot equipment steam is produced in excess. A part of steam is therefore not 

used for energy exchanges. This excess of steam goes to the condenser where it is 

condensed and exits the equipment by the condensates line. The mass of water inserted in 

the heating systems, therefore used to steam production, may be measured. After working 

during a given process time without adding water in the heating systems, the mass of 

remaining water was calculated. The difference between the mass of water inserted and

remaining in the heating system is therefore the mass of steam produced in excess. This 

part of steam is not used to the energy exchange, and it is therefore not taken into account 

in the mass and energy balances. Thus the mass of the excess steam is not reported in this 

thesis. The non-condensable gases from the steam (Fig. 4.1) were transferred to the 

condenser where they were removed from the system. The mass flow rate of non-

condensable gas was considered to be negligible, and therefore it was not taken into 

account in the calculation of mass and energy balances. 

At the outlet of the evaporator, the inlet mass flow rate of the product was a 

combination of the mass flow rate of product concentrate and the mass flow rate of 

secondary vapor that was finally converted in product condensate (Fig. 4.10). 

m??i? =  m?P??? +  m???  [4.3] 
As the condenser was an indirect heat-exchanger, there was no mixing of the 

condensate and cooling water. Therefore: 

m???i?  = m??????  [4.4] 
As the steam entering the evaporator tubes was saturated, it is supposed that its 

condensation was complete and that all the steam was transformed into the condensate at 

saturation temperature. Therefore: 

m???? =  m???  [4.5] 
Thus, only the latent heat of vaporization was exchanged: 

?H? =  ?H??? ?  H??? [4.6] 



 

80 

 

where  H???  and H??  are the enthalpy of evaporation (kJ·kg-1) of steam and its 
condensate, respectively. 

The heating power Q (kW) applied to the three tubes was used to the production of 

saturated steam according to: 

Q? =  m????  ?  ?H? [4.7] 
Equation [4.7] thus makes it possible to calculate the mass flow rate of the steam, 

whose pressure and temperature are known, as well as the heating power generated by the 

boilers. Expressing heat loss as q??, the enthalpy balance can be written: 
?m????  ?  H????  +  ?m??i?  ?  H?i? ? + ?m???i? ? H??i? ? =  ?m?P???  ?   HP??? ? +  ?m???  ? H?? ? +  ?m???  ?  H???  + ?m?????? ? H????? ? +  q?? [4.8] 

Where q??  comprises the rate of energy losses and error of measurements and 
calculation. 

By substituting Equations [4.4], [4.5] and [4.6] in Equation [4.8]: 

m????  ? ??H?? = ?m?P???  ?   HP???? +  ?m???  ?  H??? ? ?m??i?  ?  H?i? )  
                                                            +m??? ? (H????? ? H???? )   +      q?? [4.9] 

The left term of equation 4.9 corresponds to the heating power Q provided by the 

steam, i.e. the energy provided by the heating system of the evaporator. 

4.6.  Overall heat transfer coefficient 

The overall heat transfer coefficient for each tube was calculated as: 



 

81 

 

Q = ? · A · ??            ? = Q A? = ? ? ??         ? = ? ???  Eq. 4.10 
where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, kW·m-2?°C-1; Q the heating power 

transferred to the product, kW; A the heating surface, m2; ?? the mean temperature 

difference between steam and product concentrate, °C; and ? the heat flux, kW·m-2. 

The inlet steam temperature and the product temperature (Fig. 4.7 (TS0, TP)) were 

used to the measurement of the ??. 

4.7.  Assessment of process efficiency 

The energy consumption for evaporation is a key parameter used to assess the 

efficiency of a plant. As in drying, it can be evaluated from the Specific Energy Consumption 

(SEC; kJ?kg-1 of water evaporated) (Bimbenet et al., 2007), and from the energy efficiency 

(EE; % - w·w-1), that is the ratio between the amount of water evaporated and the amount 

of steam, expressed as a percentage. EE can also be represented as the ratio between the 

latent heat vaporization of the steam and of the product. Due to the gradient of temperature 

between the steam and the product the ratio will not be equal to 1. In an adiabatic process 

without energy losses EE value is of the order of 99%. SEC and EE are defined by the 

following equations: 

SEC =   ????? ? ?H?????  Eq. 4.11 
and 

EE = ?????????  Eq. 4.12 
4.8.  Characterization of the flow 



 

82 

 

Flow was characterized using an experimental Reynolds number of the film (§ 2.4), 

and the classification defined by Bird et al. (1960) that established the flow profiles for the 

falling film in three regions was used: 

? Ref &amp;lt;25: laminar flow; 
? 25 &amp;lt;Ref &amp;lt;1000: laminar flow with waves (wavy-laminar); 
? Ref &gt; 1000: turbulent flow. 

As Ref was always measured at the bottom of the evaporation tubes, the 

characterization of the flow behavior in sections ? and ? was always the same, as both 
were measured at the bottom of T3. 

The maximum flow velocity, corresponding to the velocity of the first fluid elements 

that arrived at the bottom of the evaporation tube, was calculated according to equation 4.13. 

???? = ?????? ?? ? ????????i?i?  Eq. 4.13 
where ???? is the maximum flow velocity and t???? the time that the first particles of 

tracer take to cross a section of the evaporator equipment (Fig. 4.8). 

4.9.  Residence time distribution functions 

4.9.1.  Measurement of residence time distribution 

RTD were determined experimentally by injecting an inert chemical, molecule or 

atom, called a tracer, into a reactor at some time, t = 0, and then measuring the tracer 

concentration in the effluent stream as a function of time. In this study, RTD characterization 

was based on the follow-up of the concentration of sodium chloride added to the product. 

The product with 10 g·kg-1 of sodium chloride was injected into the evaporator for 30 seconds 



 

83 

 

(Fig. 4.11). The NaCl remains soluble at the concentration used in this study (maximum 

concentration of 20 g·kg-1) and its concentration did not affect the product viscosity 

(Huppertz and Fox, 2006), which is the main parameter related to the product flow behavior 

(Ali Adib and Vasseur, 2008; Monnier et al., 2012; Park et al., 2004). The time that the 

sodium chloride molecules and the product fluid elements took in the evaporator equipment 

was therefore considered to be the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.11. Tracer injection x(t) and output signal at bottom of T1 (y1(t)), T2 (y2(t)) 

and T3 (y3(t)). 

As the pilot operates as a continuous process, the products with and without the 

tracer were put in two different tanks connected to the feed line with a three-way valve, which 

allowed rapid change in the nature of the feed product. Using this technique the shape of 

the injection signal could be considered to be a square.

The outlet sodium chloride concentration, measured indirectly by conductivity, was 

calculated at the bottom of the three evaporation tubes. Calibration curves of product 

conductivity in relation to product concentration were performed (Fig. 4.12). This was done 

for all products in all concentrations obtained in this study. It was then possible to plot the 

sodium chloride concentrations in the effluent stream as a function of time, (yi(t)) (Fig. 4.11).

milk at 200 g·kg-1 of total solids, B: Sweet whey at 363 g·kg-1 of total solids and C: lactic acid 

whey at 364 g·kg-1 of total solids. 

The RTD signal (Ei(t)) was determined in the four different sections of the vacuum 

evaporator (Fig. 3.8) by numerical deconvolution of the outlet signal (i.e. outlet concentration 

of NaCl) by the injection signal (i.e. inlet concentration of NaCl). Due to the complexity of the 

calculations performed, the MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release software (2014b, The 

MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) was used. 

E?(t) was calculated by numerical deconvolution of y1(t) with the injection signal 
(x(t)). The sodium chloride concentration measured at the bottom of T1 (y1(t)) was the 

injection signal for calculating E?(t). E?(t) was therefore calculated by numerical 
deconvolution of y2(t) with y1(t). For E?(t) the injection signal was y2(t), and thus E?(t) was 
calculated by numerical deconvolution of y2(t) with y3(t). (Eq. 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16). The 

overall RTD from the inlet to the outlet of the evaporator (E?(t)) was calculated by numerical 
deconvolution of yT3(t) by the injection signal (x(t)) (Eq 4.17). 

yT1(t) = x?t? ? E?(t) Eq. 4.14 
yT2(t) = yT1(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.15 
yT3(t) = yT2(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.16 
yT3(t) = x(t) ? E?(t) Eq. 4.17 

Having determined Ei(t) for the different sections of the vacuum evaporator, it was 

then possible to determine both the residence time of each fluid element and the time at 

which a certain fraction of the material entering at t = 0 was no longer present in the 



 

86 

 

equipment. The mean residence time, ?, corresponded to the time when 50% of the material 

entering at t = 0 passed through the equipment. In other words this parameter corresponded 

to the time for recorded 50% of the inlet sodium chloride molecules at the outlet of the 

equipment. 

4.9.2.  Model of the residence time distribution functions 

Different models were tested to model the RTD functions for the four different 

sections of the falling film evaporator. Due to the changes in product composition during the 

vacuum evaporation (i.e. increase in product viscosity and changes in the flow profile), the 

dispersion of the particles in the equipment was more pronounced than in plug flow systems. 

Therefore the RTD functions were modeled by a set of perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series 

in order to take into account the flow profile in the evaporator. Each reactor set includes Ni 

reactor tanks in series, and can be characterized by a mean residence time (ki). Its own RTD 

function is defined by: 

E??t? = ?Ni?i ?Ni · ?iNi??· ??? ?Ni· ?i ?i? ??Ni???!  Eq. 4.18 
The number of tanks in series, Ni, provides information about the dispersion of the 

fluid elements: a high N value indicates low dispersion of the particles in the reactor 

(Gutierrez et al., 2010). 

Different arrangements of perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series were studied. For 

this study the model of two reactor sets in parallel (Fig. 3.13) was the most effective to model 

the experimental RTD functions. The product therefore was considered to pass through two 

reactor sets, A and B, characterized by two RTD functions Ea(t) and Eb(t). Reactor set C was 

a combination of these two reactor sets (Fig. 4.13). It was characterized by the function Ec(t), 

which describes the experimental RTD of the falling film evaporator (Eq. 4.19).

where a refers to the fraction of feed flow rate going into reactor set A. The three 

parameters of each reactor set (ai, ?i and Ni) were adjusted step by step in order to fit the 

modeled curve to the experimental curve.

Chapter ? 
PILOT SCALE INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF 

EVAPORATION OF SKIM MILK, WHOLE MILK AND WATER 

The aim of the work reported in this chapter was to compare the effectiveness of a 

pilot scale single stage falling film evaporator in the evaporation of water, skim and whole 

milk. Using the acquisition instrumentation of the pilot and an inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg·h-

1, initially no significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency 

for two runs with skim milk were found, but the values were higher than those obtained with 

the experiments with water. The heat transfer coefficient did not differ according to the 

product and this result does not explain why the evaporation of SM was more effective than 

that of water. The results of this Chapter were published in Dairy Science and Technology1. 

After additional instrumentation of the pilot, some problems were identified with the 

water level sensor of the heating systems and the distributor system of the evaporator tubes. 

After solving these problems and using the same operating conditions, the difference 

between the effectiveness of evaporation of water, skim and whole milk was studied. No 

significant variations were found (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency 

for the experiments with water, skim milk (two runs – 83.0 g·kg-1 to 471.0 g·kg-1 of total 

solids), and during the first run of whole milk (114 g·kg-1 to 265 g·kg-1 of total solids), but the 

values were lower in the second run of the whole milk experiments (265 g·kg-1 to 545 g·kg-

1 of total solids), where a poor wetting rate was identified in the evaporator tubes. The 

experiments were then performed at an inlet mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1. No significant 

variations were then found (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate or in the energy efficiency for 

all runs and products. 



 

89 

 

The appropriate instrumentation of the vacuum evaporation process allowed 

identification and correction of the process problems and was necessary to keep an efficient 

working of evaporators.

Capítulo 5 
INVESTIGAÇÃO EM ESCALA PILOTO DA CAPACIDADE DE EVAPORAÇÃO DE 

LEITE DESNATADO, LEITE INTEGRAL E ÁGUA 

O objetivo do trabalho descrito neste capítulo foi o de comparar a capacidade 

evaporativa da água pura, leite desnatado e leite integral durante a concentração em um 

evaporador piloto, único efeito, de película descendente. Utilizando a instrumentação da 

aquisição do piloto e uma vazão mássica de alimentação de 50 kg·h-1, nenhuma diferença 

significativa (p &amp;lt;0,05) na capacidade evaporativa ou na eficiência energética para as duas 

passagens de leite desnatado foram identificadas. No entanto esses valores foram 

superiores aos obtidos pelos experimentos realizados com água pura. O coeficiente de 

transferência de calor apresentou o mesmo valor para todos os produtos estudados, sendo 

que este resultado não explica por que a capacidade evaporativa do leite desnatado foi 

superior ao da água pura. Os resultados apresentados neste capítulo foram publicados na 

revista Dairy Science and Technology1. 

Após a instrumentação adicional do piloto foram identificados problemas com o 

sensor de nível de água dos sistemas de aquecimento e com o sistema de distribuição de 

produto no topo dos tubos de evaporação. Após a reparação destes problemas e utilizando 

os mesmos parâmetros operacionais, a diferença entre a capacidade evaporativa da água 

pura, leite desnatado e integral foi novamente estudada. Não houve diferenças significativas 

(p &amp;lt;0,05) entre a capacidade evaporativa e entre a eficiência energética para os 

experimentos realizados com água, leite desnatado (duas passagens - 83,0 g·kg-1 a 471,0 

g·kg-1 de sólidos totais), e durante a primeira passagem do leite integral (114 g·kg-1 a 265 

g·kg-1 de sólidos totais), mas esses valores foram inferiores na segunda passagem dos 

experimentos realizados com leite integral (265 g·kg-1 a 545 g·kg-1 de sólidos totais), onde 



 

91 

 

uma molhagem ineficiente dos tubos de evaporação foi identificada. Os experimentos foram 

então realizadas a uma vazão mássica de alimentação de 70 kg·h-1. Nenhuma diferença 

significativa foi encontrada (p &amp;lt;0,05) na capacidade de evaporativa ou na eficiência 

energética para todas as passagens e para ambos produtos utilizados nesse estudo. 

A adequada instrumentação do processo de evaporação a vácuo permitiu a 

identificação e correção de problemas no processo de evapoção e foi necessária para 

manter um funcionamento eficaz do evaporador. 

 

 

 

 

  

Os principais objetivos deste capítulo são: 

- demonstrar como os parâmetros operacionais do processo podem ser utilizados para 
caracterizar o processo de evaporação a vácuo 

- estudar a capacidade evaporativa da água, leite desnatado e leite integral 

- descrever os balanços entálpicos do processo de evaporação a vácuo

5.1.  Introduction 

Evaporation is a process through which a liquid is brought to its boiling point by 

external heating, transforming the solvent into vapor that escapes from the surface of the 

liquid. Such thermal concentration is commonly used for liquid foods (i.e. milk, fruit juice and 

sugar solutions) to manufacture products such as sweet condensed milk (Gänzle et al., 

2008), “dulce de leche” (Hentges et al., 2010), beet or cane sugar, fruit juice (Tonelli et al., 

1990) and tomato sauce concentrates (Runyon et al., 1991). Above all, it is an intermediate 

process in the production of milk, buttermilk and whey powders (Schuck, 2002), infant 

formula (Zhu et al., 2011), protein isolates (Onwulata et al., 2006), etc. 

In order to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, it is important that 

evaporators operate at their maximum capacity, which is strongly dependent on the overall 

heat transfer coefficient. This parameter cannot be considered as an intrinsic characteristic 

of the evaporator, since it also depends on the nature of the product and on their flow 

conditions (Mafart, 1991). The factors that control heat transfer in the evaporator tubes are 

important for close monitoring of the evaporation process and for calculating the dimensions 

of evaporators (Bouman et al., 1993; Jebson and Iyer, 1991). 

As boiling and concentration take place inside the falling-film evaporator, the study 

of the mechanisms is complex, because both occur simultaneously (Li et al., 2011; Pehlivan 

and Ozdemir, 2012). Some studies of the evaporation process reported in the literature were 

carried out on industrial evaporators. In this case, operating conditions such as the 

configuration of the equipment and the quality of the raw materials were not controlled 

(Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Jebson and Chen, 1997). In contrast, other studies on laboratory 

and pilot scales were carried out using model solutions (water, sucrose solutions, etc.) (Luo 

et al., 2011; Prost et al., 2006) and evaporation systems whose design had been modified 

from industrial evaporators in order to separate phenomena and facilitate their 



 

94 

 

understanding (Adib et al., 2009; Bouman et al., 1993). There is, therefore, only limited 

information on evaporator performance, i.e. the performance of real evaporators working 

with real products over real concentration steps. 

The aim of this study was to compare heat and mass balance using a pilot scale, 

single stage vacuum falling film evaporator composed of three tubes in series, for the 

evaporation of skim milk and water. This equipment was designed to study both phenomena 

(boiling and concentration) occurring during the evaporation of dairy products. The 

experimental effectiveness of evaporation were compared to theoretical effectiveness with 

no energy loss. The investigation also involved calculation of the energy used by the 

evaporator, the overall heat transfer coefficient for each run, and study of the factors 

influencing the evaporation rate of skim milk compared to water. 

5.2.  Materials and methods 

5.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator and experiments 

The experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling-film 

evaporator equipped with the acquisition sensors (described in Chapter 4.1). 

All experiments were performed at the product inlet temperature of 60 °C, an 

absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus the evaporation temperature (?ev) was 

maintained at 60 °C throughout the three tubes. These experiments were taken in triplicate 

at ambient temperature. 

5.2.2.  Experimental runs 

Experimental runs were carried out with water (maximum hardness of 80 mg 

CaCO3·kg-1) and skim milk at two different initial concentrations. All experiments were 

performed at an inlet mass flow rate of 50.0 ± 0.7 kg·h-1 and the results analyzed after 30 



 

95 

 

min of process time. This short process time was chosen to evite fouling formation. The 

value of inlet flow rate was provided by the evaporator manufacturer as a good flow rate for 

milk concentration. It was therefore used to characterize thermodynamically the evaporation 

process. 

Skim milk was prepared at 100.0 g·kg-1 of total solids (TS) from dairy powder (Societé 

Mayenne, Mayenne, France). It was heated to 60 °C before evaporation. The total process 

time was around 60 min to avoid fouling formation from 200 kg of product. After the first run 

(1R) through the evaporator, skim milk was concentrated from 100.0 g·kg-1 TS to 240.0 g·kg-

1 TS. This product, still at 60 °C, was reintroduced into the evaporator where it was re-

concentrated (second run (2R)) from 240.0 g·kg-1 TS to 520.0 g·kg-1 TS (Table 5.1).

5.2.3.  Physicochemical analyses 

Viscosity and total solids were measured as described in chapter 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, 

respectively. 

5.2.4.  Enthalpy characterization 

Mass and enthalpy balance, overall heat transfer coefficient and assessment of 

process efficiency were calculated as described in chapter 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. 

5.2.5.  Statistical analysis 

Data were analyzed by regression analysis of variance using SAS (2008) software, 

at the 0.05 level of significance. 

5.3.  Results and discussion 

5.3.1.  Mass balance 

The initial and final product concentrations before and after the run in the evaporator 

are presented in Table 5.1. The viscosity of these solutions was also measured (Table 5.1). 

The viscosity of water remained constant during evaporation, whereas the viscosity of skim 

milk increased from 1.0? mPa?s to 2.?3 mPa?s during the 1R, and its behavior was 

Newtonian, i.e. its viscosity remained constant whatever the shear rate. In the 2R run the 

viscosity increased from 2.?3 mPa?s at 240.0 g·kg-1 of TS to 23.?1 mPa?s at ?20.0 g·kg-1 of 

TS. At this concentration, the product had a shear thinning behavior, i.e. its viscosity 

decreased with increasing shear rate. This behavior can be explained as a consequence of 

increasing the shear rate which induces the asymmetric dispersed molecules to align 

themselves within the shear planes, causing the frictional resistance to diminish (Tung, 1978; 

Velez Ruiz and Barbosa Canovas, 1997). The mass balance of the process was effective 



 

97 

 

for all experiments, with a maximum error of 4.6 %, representing the difference between the 

inlet and outlet mass flow rates (Eq. 4.2). The evaporation rate was calculated by subtracting 

the inlet flow rate of the product and the outlet flow rate of the product concentrate. This 

parameter reflects the amount of water evaporated from the product. There was no 

significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the evaporation rate for the two runs carried out with skim 

milk, and it was higher than that obtained for the experiments carried out with water. To 

explain these results, the enthalpy balance was calculated and the process efficiency 

assessed (Table 5.2). 

5.3.2.  Enthalpy balance 

To calculate the energy balance, the vacuum evaporation process was considered 

as a single system (Fig. 4.10). In other words, we took into account the average temperature 

of the steam measured in the three tubes (Fig. 4.4 (TSin)) and the sum of the mass of steam 

condensed on the three tubes. The temperature of the outlet steam (Fig. 4.4 (TSout)), 

remained constant at 75 °C for all experiments. In this case, it was assumed that all energy 

exchanged between the steam and the product corresponded to latent heat, and 

consequently the steam temperature was the same as for the steam condensate (75 °C).The 

pilot scale evaporator could thus be considered as a full latent heat exchanger. 

The enthalpy balance data for the experiments performed with skim milk and water 

are given in Table 5.2. There was no significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the enthalpy balance 

error for the experiments. The difference between the inlet and outlet enthalpy values 

represented the heat losses q?? (Eq. 4.3) by radiation and convection to the surrounding air. 
Such loss is variable and difficult to measure, depending on factors such as the nature of 

the steel (state of polish), the temperature difference between the surfaces of the evaporator 

and ambient air, etc. In industrial single stage evaporators, an allowance is made for heat 



 

98 

 

losses up to 1% (Jebson and Iyer, 1991) but with this pilot scale evaporator, these energy 

losses were expected to be greater as the scale was reduced.

Legend: SEC: specific energy consumption; EE: energy efficiency. 

 

As previously explained, SEC (Eq. 4.11) is a parameter used to evaluate the 

economic aspects of concentration: the higher the SEC, the greater the cost of the operation. 

With a single stage evaporator operating at the evaporating temperature used in this study, 

an optimal value of SEC of about 2358 kJ?kg-1 would be expected without energy loss. For 

the experiments with skim milk, there was no significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the SEC and 

Inlet mass flow rate = 50 kg·h-1

this value was lower than the values obtained with water (Table 5.2), in agreement with the 

evaporation rate (Table 5.1). Energy efficiency was calculated to provide a better evaluation 

of the process yield (Eq. 4.12). This parameter can be interpreted as the percentage of 

energy gained from the steam which is used for evaporating 1 kg of product. As expected 

from the SEC results, there was no significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the energy efficiency 

(EE) for the experiments with skim milk, and it was higher than the values obtained for the 

experiments with water. The average values of the EE were close to 80 % for experiments 

with skim milk and 70 % for experiments with water (Table 5.2), the difference from 100% 

(in a theoretical one stage vacuum evaporator) corresponding to the environmental heat lost, 

product elevation boiling point, wall thermal resistance, etc.. Experiments conducted with 

water at other heat fluxes showed similar energy efficiency values, demonstrating that the 

energy from the steam is always produced in excess in this pilot evaporator, thus leading to 

a lower energy yield. 

5.3.3.  Overall heat transfer coefficient 

To complement and confirm the results obtained, the overall heat transfer coefficient 

for each tube and for all three products was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5.3.

The heating power used in this process was 8.40 ± 0.02 kW for each tube. The 

diameter of the first tube was greater than the other two (36 mm versus 23 mm). The heat 

flux in the first tube, calculated according to Eq. 4.10, was therefore lower than in the other 

tubes. The temperature difference between the steam and the product was the same for all 

the products (p &amp;lt;0.05). This temperature gap was greater than that applied industrially, 

which is generally less than 10 °C (Adib et al., 2009). 

The overall heat transfer coefficient (U), calculated according to Eq. 4.10, was the 

same (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the first tube for all products (Table 5.3), i.e. an average value of 1.24 

kW·m-2·°C-1, whereas it was close to 1.96 kW·m-2·°C-1 in the other two tubes. Jebson and 

Chen (1997) obtained values of U between 0.8 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 3.08 kW·m-2·°C-1 for whole 

milk measured from several milk powder factories; Jebson and Iyer (1991) found values of 

U between 2.00 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 3.50 kW·m-2·°C-1 for skim milk concentrated in five-effect 

evaporators; Prost et al. (2006) reported values of U between 2.08 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 2.40 

kW·m-2·°C-1 for water evaporated in the first effect of a third-effect evaporator. 

In these experiments, the heat transfer coefficient was the same for the same 

operating conditions (?, ??, Pabs) whatever the product. This result does not explain why the 

evaporation rate of skim milk was greater than that of water (Table 5.1). It is emphasized 

Inlet mass flow rate = 50 kg·h-1 
Heating power= 25.2 kW 



 

101 

 

that the inverse of U is overall resistance resulting from the addition of four resistance levels 

in a series, where the limiting resistance is generally the value on the product side between 

the wall and the evaporated liquid, especially at high concentrations (Jebson and Iyer, 1991; 

Jebson and Chen, 1997). This value depends on several factors: 

? Physical properties of the product treated (viscosity, ?p, density, ?p, surface 
tension, jp, etc.), 

? Process conditions (heat flux, ?, temperature difference, ??, boiling 
temperature, ?p...) 

? Nature and geometry of the heating surface, (roughness R, etc.). 

These three types of parameter influence the values of the heat transfer coefficient 

of the product side and therefore the values of U. 

Thus the behavior of a product and the efficiency of the evaporation process (SEC, 

evaporation rate, etc.) cannot be predicted with only its overall heat transfer coefficient. 

It should be remembered that the evaporation rate is related to the operation 

conditions (e.g., distribution system, heat flux, etc.) (Morison et al., 2006) and product 

characteristics, such as viscosity and surface tension (Morison et al., 2006; Paramalingam 

et al., 2000; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012). Moreover, product viscosity has an impact on the 

thickness and the residence time distribution of the thin falling film. The flow behavior of the 

product throughout the evaporator is modified according to its viscosity: a thicker and slower 

thin film should be formed at the end of the skim milk concentration process compared to 

water. Therefore the higher level of viscosity might result in a longer residence time of the 

product in the evaporator and thus a longer time when the product would receive the 

evaporation energy, thereby increasing the evaporation rate. 



 

102 

 

5.4.  Additional information 

An additional instrumentation of the evaporation pilot was performed to improve 

characterization and understanding of the evaporation process (§ 4.2.2.). The pilot 

equipment could thus be divided into four different sections (Fig. 4.8), where the evaporation 

rate of each tube could be assessed (since the inlet and outlet product flow rate of each tube 

could be measured). With the new information some problems were identified in performing 

the experiments, such as a lower wetting rate of the tubes and poor regulation of the water 

level sensor of the heating system. 

5.4.1.  Distributor system 

The plate distributor system (Fig. 4.5), located at the top of the evaporator tubes, did 

not disperse the water homogeneously (Fig. 5.1 (A)), and therefore a film breakdown (Fig. 

2.14) occurred. Since product film formation did not take place uniformly throughout the 

evaporator tube, the efficiency of the process decreased. The poor wetting rate of the tubes 

led to the formation of dry patches in the tubes (Fig. 2.14), and this phenomenon thus 

contributed to loss in the heat transfer surface. The plate distributor system was then 

changed to a cone-shaped concave distributor (Fig. 4.6). The water dispersion was more 

effective with the new distributor system (Fig. 5.1 (B)). Dispersion of skim milk with the plate 

distributor was better than water dispersion (Fig. 5.1 (C)), possibly related to differences in 

product properties, especially surface tension and viscosity.

(C) cone-shaped concave distributor with water. 

5.4.2.  Water level sensor of the heating tubes 

The water level sensor of the three heating systems (Fig. 5.2) was poorly regulated. 

A delay of a few seconds in closing the water injection electro valve occurred when fills the 

heating systems and an excess of water was therefore injected into the heating system. This

excess flowed to the steam side of the evaporator tubes, thus decreasing the heat transfer 

surface (Fig. 5.2). This problem occurred mainly in the first evaporator tube. 

 

Figure 5.2. Evaporator tube showing the water sensor level and the loss of heat 

transfer surface due the excess water injected into the heating system. 

The experiments with skim milk and water were always performed on the same day, 

in order to retain the same ambient conditions (same room temperature) and always with 

water prior to milk. The heating systems were filled with water at the beginning of the 

experiments and, due to the problem with the water level sensor, a loss of heat transfer 

surface occurred (Fig. 5.2).

As steam is always produced in excess in this pilot equipment, a part of the steam 

goes to the condenser (Fig. 4.1). This mass was calculated experimentally as 1.77 kg·h-1 of 

excess steam produced by each heating system, i.e. not used to exchange energy. This 

steam mass was not used in the calculation of the energy balance. The steam produced in 

excess was thus condensed in the condenser and extracted by the condensate evacuation 

pump (Fig. 4.1). A decrease in the water level in the heating system and an increase in the 

used heat transfer surface therefore occurred over time. The evaporation rate thus 

increased in relation to the process time, and the heat transfer surface for skim milk 

experiments was greater than for water experiments (since the experiments with milk were 

always carried out after water experiments). 

These two factors, i.e. poor distribution of water in the evaporator tubes and higher 

heat transfer surface for skim milk experiments, together explain the lower evaporation rate 

of water compared to skim milk. 

5.4.3.  Investigation of the effectiveness of evaporation after 

improvement of the pilot vacuum evaporator 

After regulation of the water level sensor, change in the distributor system and use 

of manual injection of water into the heating systems, a new characterization of the 

evaporator process was undertaken. Solutions of water, fresh skim milk and whole milk (26 

g·kg-1 fat content) were studied to validate the difference in the effectiveness of evaporation. 

The effects of the inlet mass flow rate of the product at 50 kg·h-1 and 70 kg·h-1 were also 

studied. All other operating parameters of the evaporation process were kept constant. 

The initial and final product concentrations before and after the runs in the evaporator 

are presented in Table 5.4.

For the experiments performed at an inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg·h-1, skim milk (SM) 

and whole milk (WM) were concentrated in two runs in the evaporator, reaching final 

concentrations of 471 g·kg-1 and 545 g·kg-1 of TS, respectively. 

There was no significant difference (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the evaporation rates between the 

first and second runs of skim milk, the first run of whole milk, and water experiments. 

Nonetheless the second run of whole milk presented a lower evaporation rate (p &amp;lt;0.05) 

compared to the other solutions and runs studied.  



 

107 

 

The water evaporation rate calculated before and after the additional instrumentation 

of the pilot evaporator increased from 23.5 ± 0.7 kg·h-1 to 26.9 ± 1.5 kg·h-1 (at the inlet mass 

flow rate of 50 kg·h-1), reaching similar values to those of the skim milk experiments (27.2 ± 

1.5 kg·h-1) under the same operating conditions. These results demonstrated that the 

difference in the evaporation rate between water and skim milk, calculated before the 

additional instrumentation and configuration of the equipment, was due to the problems with 

the water sensor level and the distributor system. The inlet steam temperature for the first 

and second run of skim milk, water and first run of whole milk were 65 ºC for T1 and 68 ºC 

for T2 and T3. The steam inlet temperature for the experiments performed at 70 kg·h-1 are 

shown in Fig. 5.3.

There was no significant variation (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the enthalpy balance error (Table 4.5) 

for the experiments performed with water, the two runs of skim milk and the first run of whole 

milk, although the value was higher in the second run of whole milk experiments. The lower 

evaporation rate of the second run of whole milk might be explained by the poor wetting rate 

of the tubes, which might cause a film breakdown (Fig. 2.14) and increase in energy loss.

An increase in the inlet steam temperature was observed in the second run of whole 

milk experiments (Fig. 5.4). A poor wetting rate of the inner surface of the tubes, and 

therefore dry patches and fouling formation (§ 2.4) might be related to the temperature 

increase. The inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg·h-1 was thus not sufficient to ensure a minimum 

wetting rate for the surface of the tubes when the solution to be concentrated had a high 

viscosity/total solids values. 

 

Figure 5.4. Inlet steam temperature in function of the process time for the 

experiments with whole milk at inlet mass flow rate of 50 kg·h-1. 

To ensure a minimum wetting rate of the three evaporation tubes the experiments 

were performed at an inlet mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1, where the solutions of skim and whole 

milk were concentrated in three runs in the evaporator. As the heating power was constant 

for the two inlet mass flow rates studied (25.20 ± 0.05 kW), the evaporation rate for all 

solutions and runs at 70 kg·h-1 was the same (p &amp;lt;0.05) (27.4 ± 0.5 kg·h-1) as that of skim 

milk in the two runs, whole milk in the first run and water at 50 kg·h-1.

Since there was no difference in the evaporation rate of any of the solutions studied 

at the inlet mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1, the increase in the inlet mass flow rate (50 kg·h-1 to 

70 kg·h-1) was effective to ensure a good wetting rate of the evaporator tubes. 

The energy loss, SEC and EE were constant, (8.5 ± 1.2 %, 2795 ± 32 kJ·kg-1 and 89 

± 1 %, respectively), for all solutions and runs conducted at 70 kg·h-1. 

5.5.  Conclusion 

The effectiveness of a pilot scale single stage falling-film evaporator for the 

evaporation of water and skim milk was studied, for which a wide range of information was 

required, i.e. information related to the operating conditions as well as information related to 

the product. 

It was first demonstrated that the evaporation rate of skim milk was greater than that 

of water in the same operating conditions. Certain conclusions were drawn to explain this 

phenomenon, such as influence of product viscosity, product dispersion in the tubes, 

residence time etc. 

Some modifications were performed on the pilot evaporator to improve the 

understanding of its working. These modifications revealed that there was no difference in 

evaporation rate between the first and second runs of skim milk, water and first run of whole 

milk. The second run of whole milk showed a lower evaporation rate, where a problem in 

the wetting rate of the tubes was identified. 

At the mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1 there was no difference in the evaporation rate, 

energy loss, SEC and EE for any of the solutions studied. This inlet mass flow rate showed 

sufficient efficiency to ensure a good wetting rate of the evaporator tubes.

Improve understanding of the process combined with suitable instrumentation of the 

vacuum evaporator equipment proved to be effective in identifying and solving problems in 

this process. Further studies of the evaporation process are needed to investigate the 

influence of the product residence time distribution and the flow profile in order to improve 

the working and understanding of evaporators.

Chapter ? 
FLOW REGIME ASSESSMENT IN FALLING FILM 

EVAPORATORS USING RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION 

FUNCTIONS 

The aim of this chapter is to describe the flow regime, and characterize and model 

the residence time distribution (RTD) functions of a falling film evaporator (FFE). 

Experimental runs were carried out with skim milk at 60 kg·h-1, 70 kg·h-1 and 80 kg·h-1 and 

water at 70 kg·h-1 of feed mass flow rates. Flow was characterized using experimental 

Reynolds number (Ref). The RTD function in the FFE was measured in four sections of the 

vacuum evaporator equipment. These RTD functions were modeled by a combination of 

perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series. In this study, the turbulent and wavy-laminar flow 

regime had the same mean residence time, otherwise when the flow regime changed from 

wavy-laminar to laminar, the mean residence time increased. The flow was analyzed as a 

main and a minor retarded flow, where two layers of product flowed through the evaporator 

tubes. The future of this work consists of extending the RTD approach to other products and 

operating conditions in the evaporator device. The results of this chapter were published in 

Journal of Food Engineering1.

DETERMINAÇÃO DO REGIME DE ESCOAMENTO EM EVAPORADORES 

DE PELÍCULA DESCENDENTE UTILIZANDO FUNÇÕES DE DISTRIBUIÇÃO 

DOS TEMPOS DE RESIDÊNCIA 

O objetivo deste capítulo é descrever o regime de escoamento e de caracterizar e 

modelar as funções de distribuição dos tempos de residência (DTR) de um evaporador de 

película descendente (EPD). Ensaios experimentais foram realizados com leite desnatado 

a vazão mássica de alimentação de 60 kg·h-1, 70 kg·h-1 e 80 kg·h-1 e com água a 70 kg·h-1. 

O escoamento foi caracterizado usando o número de Reynolds experimental (Ref). A função 

DTR foi medida em quatro diferentes seções do equipamento de evaporação a vácuo. Estas 

funções foram modelizadas através de uma combinação de reatores em tanques 

perfeitamente agitados em série. Neste estudo, o regime de escoamento turbulento e 

laminar-ondulado tiveram o mesmo tempo de residência médio, no entanto quando o 

regime de escoamento alterou-se de laminar-ondulado para laminar o tempo de residência 

médio aumentou. O escoamento foi analisado como sendo duas camadas de produto 

fluindo uma sobre a outra através dos tubos de evaporação. As perspectivas deste trabalho 

consistem em estender a abordagem de DTR para outros produtos e condições 

operacionais do equipamento de evaporação. Os resultados deste capítulo foram 

publicados na revista Journal of Food Engineering1. 

 

 

  

Os principais objetivos deste capítulo são: 

- determinar experimentalmente as funções de DTR de um evaporador de película

- modelar as funções de DTR 

- identificar o regime de escoamaento durante o processo de evaporação a vácuo

6.1.  Introduction 

Concentration by vacuum evaporation is used to decrease the volume and weight of 

the product, which subsequently reduces the cost of packaging, storage and transport and 

facilitates the conservation of the concentrate by lowering the water activity ( Bouman et al., 

1993; Prost et al., 2006; Bimbenet et al., 2007). This process is used for the production of 

final (sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.) (Gänzle et al., 2008), and 

intermediate products before any further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, 

coagulation or drying (infant formulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Schuck, 2002; 

Bimbenet et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). 

Falling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical and food industries 

for their ability to process heat-sensitive products. The evaporator device is called "falling 

film" because the liquid falls in a trickling film along the inner wall of the tube. This type of 

device allows higher heat transfer coefficients, therefore lower residence times can be 

achieved in comparison with other designs of evaporator (Bimbenet et al., 2007). However, 

industrial control of this process often relies on an empirical understanding of the 

phenomena involved, which then results in a time and cost consuming development phase 

to establish optimal operating conditions when the final product quality must be changed or 

a new type of product processed. 

As boiling and concentration occur simultaneously inside the FFE, the study of the 

mechanisms is complex (Li et al., 2011; Pehlivan and Ozdemir, 2012); indeed, the rates of 

enzymatic and chemical changes depend on solute concentration, product temperature and 

time, and it is therefore necessary take into account these three parameters in order to 

control thermal damage of constituents and process-dependent properties (product 

physicochemical properties and product end-properties). 



 

117 

 

Moreover, the few scientific papers available on the topic of vacuum evaporation in 

food and chemical domains mainly focus on the calculation and optimization of the heat 

transfer coefficient (Chun and Seban, 1971; Mafart, 1991; Jebson and Iyer, 1991; Bouman 

et al., 1993; Chun and Park, 1995; Jebson and Chen, 1997; Silveira et al., 2013), and there 

is a lack of research and information concerning the characterization of the flow regime and 

of the residence time distribution (RTD) functions of the product, E(t), during concentration 

in FFE. Moreover, RTD is a powerful approach to characterizing the mixing phenomena and 

flow regime in chemical reactor systems, which allows comparison with ideal reactors. 

Determination of the product RTD is an overall and experimental approach which 

provides valuable information about the product flow regime in the evaporator, according to 

the operational conditions. It does not provide a good physical understanding of the 

operation as computational fluid dynamics does but, on the other hand, it integrates the 

product and process complexity fully. 

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allow study of the consequences of 

modifications in operating conditions (temperature, flow rate) and process configuration with 

regard to particle characteristics (temperature, water content) and trajectories in the dryer 

(Ducept et al., 2002; Verdurmen et al., 2002). Nevertheless a numerical simulation of a real 

evaporator process is not accessible in practice: complex geometry (evaporation tubes, 

pipelines, pumps, etc.), presence of water and vapor, pressure alterations, etc. The 

experimental CFD is too complex, and hardly representative of the evaporation process. 

The experimental RTD allows, in a relatively simple way, to have valuable information about 

the product and process complexity fully. 

Since the pioneering work of Danckwerts (1953), the RTD theory has been widely 

developed, and is nowadays used in a more general context in order to determine a 



 

118 

 

population balance model (Villermaux, 1982), where the basis of this model is that the 

number of entities with certain properties in a system is a balanceable quantity. Such 

properties include, size, mass, and age. RTD theory is also used to optimize the process in 

terms of capital and operation costs (Malcata, 1991). The latter represent an essential step 

to managing and controlling the quality of food products. Burton et al., (1959) applied the 

concept of RTD to food engineering in order to calculate the sterilizing effectiveness of an 

UHT apparatus for milk processing. Baloh (1979), showed that the loss of sugar in 

pasteurization and evaporation processes of various processing schemes in the sugar 

industry could be significantly lowered by reducing the mean residence time of sweet juice. 

Thor and Loncin (1978), established the mechanisms of rinsing (e.g. mass flow rate and 

shear stress) of a plate heat exchanger by the measurement of RTD, and thereby laid down 

the basis for optimizing rinsing equipment in food engineering. Jeantet et al. (2008), 

calculated and modelled the RTD for different sections of a spray-dryer tower for skim milk, 

and described the intensity of the heat treatment that the product was subjected to during 

this process. 

No studies have been published on the characterization and modeling of RTD in 

falling film evaporators for concentration of food products. Understanding both RTD and 

kinetics of product temperature along its flow in the equipment should pave the way for 

further prediction of chemical changes (e.g. protein denaturation) that occur during this 

processing step. The aim of this study was first to characterize RTD functions of a pilot falling 

film evaporator experimentally, and then to model these RTD functions and identify the flow 

regime of the process. 

6.2.  Materials and Methods

6.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator 

The experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling film 

evaporator with the additional instrumentation (described in Chapter 4.2.2) without the 

preheater. The product was heated at the evaporation temperature in a jacketed tank before 

entering the equipment. 

All experiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus 

the saturation temperature of evaporation was maintained at 60 °C throughout the three 

tubes. 

6.2.2.  Experimental runs 

Experimental runs were carried out with skim milk at three different feed mass flow 

rates (60 kg·h-1, 70 kg·h-1and 80 kg·h-1). 

Skim milk was recombined at 100 g·kg-1 of total solids (TS) from skim milk powder 

(Lactalis ingredients, Bourgbarré, France). It was concentrated in three runs in the 

evaporator equipment. The inlet and outlet TS of skim milk concentrates at the bottom of the 

three evaporations tubes for the three feed mass flow rates and runs studied are shown in 

Table 6.1. The total process time was around 60 min to avoid fouling formation from 200 kg 

of product. 

The conductivity of skim milk concentrates exceeding 520 g·kg-1 of TS could not be 

measured reliably due to their high viscosity. Therefore, for the feed mass flow rate of 60 

kg·h-1, the TS of the product exiting the second run at 389 g·kg-1 (Table 6.1) were diluted to 

283 g·kg-1 of TS and re-introduced into the evaporator for the third run. This dilution was 

undertaken to limit the concentration to 520 g·kg-1 of TS at the end of the third run. 

In total, 27 experiments were performed, at three feed mass flow rates and in three 

runs. The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 6.1.

6.3.  Results and Discussion 

6.3.1.  Product and flow characterization 

Although the mass flow rate of product was higher in T1 compared to the other two 

tubes, the value of ? at the bottom of T1 was always lower than those at the bottom of T2 

and T3 for the same feed flow rate because of a higher inner diameter (0.036 m for T1 

instead of 0.023 m for T2 and T3 (Table 4.1)). As tubes T2 and T3 had the same diameter, 

? at these points depended only on the mass flow rate of the product (Eq. 3.12). Due to 

evaporation, the mass flow rate of the product at the bottom of T2 was always higher than 

that at the bottom of T3: ?T2 &gt; ?T3. For the experiments conducted at 80 kg·h-1, the ? 

increased from 0.170 kg·s-1·m-1 to 0.177 kg·s-1·m-1 at the bottom of T1 / 1R and T1 / 3R, 

respectively (Table 6.1), evidencing a decrease in the evaporation rate when the 

concentration of the inlet product increased from 108 g·kg-1 to 254 g·kg-1 of TS. Compared 

to other tubes and runs, the increase in the product concentration caused an increase in the 

?, and therefore a decrease in the evaporation rate, as the concentrate mass flow rate 

increased. These results are in agreement with those of (Morison and Broome, 2014). 



 

123 

 

The concentration of the product at the bottom of the three evaporation tubes for the 

three feed mass flow rates and runs studied is shown in Table 6.1. At 80 kg·h-1 the skim milk 

concentration at the end of the third run of the evaporation process was 350 g·kg-1 compared 

to 434 g·kg-1 and 516 g·kg·g-1 at feed mass flow rates of 70 kg·h-1 and 60 kg·h-1, respectively. 

As the evaporation parameters, and in particular the heating power, were kept constant 

(except for the feed mass flow rate) the energy transferred to the product was the same, 

and therefore the concentration of the product at the bottom of the evaporator tubes 

increased according to the decrease in feed mass flow rate. 

Density increased proportionately with TS of the skim milk concentrates, whereas 

viscosity increased exponentially from approximately 365 g·kg-1 of TS, which is consistent 

with the results of (Chong et al., 2009). The apparent viscosity, ?100, of skim milk concentrate 

at 516 g·kg-1 of TS was 68.3·10-3 Pa·s. This value, that was higher than that found by 

(Silveira et al., 2013), might be explained by the time that the product remained at 60°C 

before measurements. Indeed at higher concentration, the viscosity of the milk concentrate 

increased with time, a phenomenon known as age thickening (Westergaard, 2004). Thus 

the residence time of the product during concentration in the FFE may affect the viscosity of 

the concentrate (Baldwin et al., 1980). Viscosity is an important parameter to be monitored 

for optimal atomization in a spray-dryer (Schuck, 2002; Westergaard, 2004). 

The values of Ref are shown in Table 6.1. Ref varied between 971 and 8, points 

corresponding to the maximum and minimum flow rates and product concentration at 80 

kg·h-1 at bottom of T1 / R1 and at 60 kg·h-1 at the bottom of T3 / 3R. In this study, Ref 

decreased as the product passed through the evaporation tubes, decreasing its flow rate 

and increasing its viscosity. These two factors thus led to a lower Ref at the bottom of the 

third tube compared to the first and second tubes for the same feed mass flow rate. 



 

124 

 

The flow regimes at the bottom of the evaporation tubes are presented in Table 6.2. 

Almost all products presented a wavy laminar profile, except T3 / 3R at 70 kg·h-1 and 60 

kg·h-1 for which a laminar flow was deduced from Ref.

6.3.2.  RTD characterization 

To improve understanding of the path of the skim milk fluid elements in the 

evaporator, and thereby improve the characterization of the flow in the FFE, the residence 

time distribution (RTD) function was maintained. The RTD curves in the third run at a feed 

mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1 are presented in Fig. 6.1. All curves had the same surface area. 

The experimental RTD curves at 80 kg·h-1 and 60 kg·h-1 presented similar shapes. For all 

feed mass flow rates and runs studied, a more highly concentrated product led to a lower 

peak on the curves and greater dispersion of the fluid elements.

The times that the first fluid elements took to arrive at the bottom of the evaporation 

tubes (tmin) after tracer injection are shown in Table 6.2 for the different sections studied. tmin 

was the same for each section and feed mass flow rate, wherever the run. Only the feed 

flow rate and the distance covered by the product in the evaporator influenced this parameter. 

The distance covered by the product of section ? was greater than section ?, which in 
turn was greater than section ?. Section ? represented the sum of the other three (Figure 
4.7). The product flow velocity was lower in section ?, as the product flow decreases due 
the evaporation. 

The maximum flow velocity, ?max, defined as the ratio of the length of a section over 

tmin for the product cover the section and calculated at the bottom of the tubes, is shown in 

Table 6.2. ?max was 0.33 ± 0.01 m·s-1, 0.31 ± 0.00 m·s-1 and 0.26 ± 0.01 m·s-1, for T1 in the 

experiments conducted at 80 kg·h-1, 70 kg·h-1 and 60 kg·h-1, respectively. ?max was 0.31 ± 

0.00 m·s-1, 0.23 ± 0.00 m·s-1, 0.22 ± 0.00 m·s-1 at 70 kg·h-1 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively, 

and ?max of section ? represented approximately the mean maximum velocity (0.25 m·s-1) 
of the three sections. In this study, ?max decreased as the product passed through the 

evaporation tubes. This was mainly due to the reduction in the mass flow rate due to product 

evaporation. 

The mean residence time, ?, for a given section was the same for experiments 

conducted at a feed mass flow rate of 80 kg·h-1. At 70 kg·h-1and 60 kg·h-1, ? was higher in 

R3 for sections ? and ?. The increase in ? was assumed to be associated with a higher 
viscosity of the product, which in turn, is a key parameter for determining the flow regime. 

Higher liquid film dispersion contributed to a higher mean residence time of the product. 

When the flow regime changed from wavy-laminar to laminar flow, ? was increased. For the 

experiments conducted in this study, the laminar flow regime has a mean residence time 

above that of wavy-laminar flow, hence the lower mean velocity. 



 

128 

 

The evaporation rate decreases due the increase in the energy losses, possibly due 

to an increase in the product concentration, a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient, a 

change in flow regime, a boiling delay phenomenon (i.e. product having a high boiling point 

due to greater concentration of solutes), etc. When the evaporation rate decreased, the 

mass flow rate of the product concentrate decreased less compared to high evaporation 

rate, which also increased the flow velocity and therefore decreased the residence time of 

the product. Measurement of the mean residence time was not sensitive to detect a 

decrease in the mean residence time when the evaporation rate decreased very slightly. 

It is of note that, one dimensionless number, Ref was used for determining the flow 

regime. In this work Ref described not only the flow regime, but also the mean residence 

time of the product in the FFE. Where Ref &amp;lt;25, in sections ? and ?, in 3R at 70 kg·h-1 
and 60 kg·h-1, the flow behaviour changed from wavy-laminar to laminar flow and the mean 

residence time of the product increased from 73 s to 77 s, 186 s to 196 s, 94 s to 106 s and 

231 s to 246 s, compared with 2R in the same section, where Ref &gt; 25. In these experiments, 

to minimize heat treatment (time/temperature), which is an important factor in controlling 

final product quality, the flow regime of skim milk in FFE should be in the wavy-laminar 

region, Ref &gt; 25. This can be achieved by changing the operational parameters, i.e. mass 

flow rate, heating power, etc. In a recently work Gourdon et al. (2015) showed that the flow 

behavior of whole and skim milk in FFE, was affected by total solids contents, flow rates and 

driving temperature differences. 

All experimental RTD curves for section ? presented shoulder areas at the end of 
passage through the FFE. These shoulders were also observed from section ? in the 2R 
at a feed mass flow rate of 80 kg·h-1 and 70 kg·h-1, and from section ? in the 2R, at a feed 
mass flow rate of 60 kg·h-1.

Fig. 6.2 shows the models and experimental curves for the 3R of experiments 

conducted at a feed mass flow rate of 60 kg·h-1. For modelling the results of RTD, two reactor 

sets were used in parallel. This model represents two different flows, where a main and 

minor flow was represented by the reactor set A and B, respectively. The parameters used 

for modelling each reactor set and the standard deviation between model and experimental 

RTD for all sections, runs and feed mass flow rates are presented in Table 6.3.

The accuracy and reproducibility of the model was satisfactory, considering the very 

low standard deviations obtained (Table 6.3). 

In this model, Ea(t) describes the path of between 94.0 % and 99.9 % of product fluid 

elements. Na could therefore be used to describe the dispersion in the residence time of the 

skim milk in FFE. A more highly concentrated product required a smaller number of tanks in 

series, corresponding to greater dispersion of the product. Among the 27 skim milk 

concentrations studied, the product with the lowest concentration, located at the bottom of 

T1 / 1R at 80 kg·h-1, had a value of Na = 14. This value decreased when the product was 

concentrated. The value of the product with greater concentration at the bottom of T3 / 3R 

at 60 kg·h-1, was Na = 6. Function Eb(t), described a small fraction of the fluid elements and 

served to explain the shoulder curves in the experimental RTD functions (Figures 6.2 and 

6.3). 

When the shoulders in the RTD curves did not occur, 99.9% of the product fluid 

elements passed through reactor set A, and the values of ?i and Ni were the same for both 

reactor sets. From the moment that the shoulders were observed, the product fluid elements 

going to reactor set A decreased and Nb and ?b increased, showing an increase in the fluid 

elements that passed through reactor set B. These fluid elements represented 0.9 % to 7 % 

of total skim milk fluid elements that entered the evaporator. At a feed mass flow rate of 80 

kg·h-1, the fluid elements that passed through reactor set A decreased from 99.1 % to 96.0 % 

at T1 / R2 and T3 / R3, respectively. For section ? at T3 / R3, 4.0 %, 4.5 % and 5.0 % of 
fluid elements passed through reactor set B for the feed mass flow rates of 80 kg·h-1, 70 

kg·h-1 and 60 kg·h-1, respectively.

model to detecting a small quantity of the fluid elements passing through reactor set B. The 

quantity of product passing through reactor set A decreased from 96 % to 92.5 % for section ?, at T3 / R3 at feed mass flow rates of 80 kg·h-1 and 60 kg·h-1, respectively. Comparison 
of different sections showed that the fluid elements going to reactor set A decreased when 

the product concentration increased, and thus an increase in the shoulders at the end of 

RTD curves was observed. 

As mentioned before, the model used in this study takes into account a main and a 

minor flow. For the experiments when the shoulders in the RTD curves were noted, the 

minor flow should be considerate as a retarded flow (Fig. 6.3), due to the high mean 

residence time presented. These two different flows possibly flow in two layers: 

• One representing a small proportion of the fluid elements, demonstrated by 

reactor set B, where the layer of product flows in contact with the walls of the evaporation 

tubes; and 

• One layer flowing over the first, in the center of the evaporation tubes, 

representing a greater proportion of the product fluid elements, demonstrated by reactor set 

A. 

Increased viscosity in the FFE results in increased film thickness (Gray, 1981), that 

could be caused by an increase in the flowing fluid elements in contact with the surface of 

the evaporation tubes. This layer would be decelerated by friction forces, surface tension, 

viscosity, etc. and thus present a longer residence time. On the other hand, the majority of 

the product may flow in a superimposed layer, where the above deceleration forces have a 

minor influence, thus contributing to a higher flow velocity and shorter residence time.

6.4.  Additional information 

The RTD functions of water during the process of vacuum evaporation in FFE were 

also measured. 

The tmin and vmax (Table 6.4) of the experiments conducted with water had similar 

values (37 s, 52 s, 60 s and 149 s, for sections ?, ?, ? and ?, respectively) to those 
obtained in the experiments conducted with skim milk in the same operating conditions (inlet 

mass flow rate of 70 kg·h-1), demonstrating that the viscosity did not influence these 

parameters. 

The experiments with water had a higher value of Ref in comparison with skim milk 

experiments (Table 6.1 and 6.4). This increase in the values of Ref may have been due to 

the low viscosity of water (0.46·10-3 Pa·s – Table 5.1), since the evaporation rate and 

therefore the flow rate at the bottom of the tubes remains constant for the experiments with 

water and milk (§ 5.4.3). The flow profile for water experiments was therefore characterized 

as turbulent (Ref &gt; 1000 – § 4.8). 

The mean residence time of the water particles in the evaporator equipment had the 

same values as that of skim milk experiments when compared to the same section in the 

1R and 2R. This parameter only changed when the flow profile changed from wavy-laminar 

to laminar flow. Therefore only the laminar flow profile affected the mean residence time of 

the particles during concentration in the FFE.

6.5.  Conclusion 

The Ref provided information about the mean residence time of the skim milk flow in 

the FFE. The mean residence time of the product was higher when the flow regime was 

characterized as laminar flow. The flow behavior of water experiments was characterized as 

turbulent flow. The flow velocity in wavy-laminar and turbulent conditions was the same, but 

this parameter was higher than in the laminar conditions. For the same operating parameters, 

water experiments in turbulent flow had the same mean residence time that skim milk flowing 

in wavy-laminar conditions 

The RTD approach provided greater understanding of the flow in FFE. The 

concentration affected the dispersion of flow in the FFE but not the time required for the first 

particles to exit from the evaporator: the more concentrated the product, the greater the 

dispersion of its particles. The change in tmin was affected by the mass flow rate and section 

(distance covered by the product). 



 

137 

 

Some RTD curves exhibited shoulders at the ends. This phenomenon characterized 

a part of the product that followed another path in the FFE. The flow is comprised of two 

different flows. The minor flow represented by reactor set B, was in contact with the inner 

surface of the tube and had a longer mean residence time. The second flow, demonstrated 

by reactor set A and representing the main fraction of product, flowed over the first layer, 

and had a shorter mean residence time compared to the first layer. 

The model with two reactor sets in parallel was effective in modelling the RTD curves. 

This model allowed calculation of the amount of product that took different paths in the FFE, 

and helped to improve understanding of the flow of skim milk in FFE. 

The future of this work involves combining the RTD approach with different products 

and operating conditions in the evaporator. These parameters can be accessed either by 

modelling or by measurement, and will make it possible to describe the time/temperature 

history of the product, and to establish further correlations with changes in constituents and 

operating parameters.

Chapter 7 
APPLICATION OF RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION 

APPROACH TO DIFFERENT DAIRY PRODUCTS TO INDICATE 

FOULING DURING CONCENTRATION IN A FALLING FILM 

EVAPORATOR 

The aim of this chapter is to use the residence time distribution approach to indicate 

fouling caused by the concentration of dairy products in a falling film evaporator (FFE), such 

as skim milk (SM), sweet whey (SW) and lactic acid whey (LAW). The extent of fouling was 

determined by measuring the heat transfer coefficient (U), energy efficiency, outlet mass 

flow rate and mean residence time of the concentrates. The heat transfer coefficient and the 

mean residence time of the SM concentrate did not change during the 420 min experiment. 

However, these two parameters gradually decreased with time for the experiments with SW 

and LAW. When fouling occurred, both the heat transfer coefficient and the mean residence 

time decreased, due to a decrease in the evaporation rate. No significant loss of SM 

components was identified after evaporation. However, a decrease in mineral content was 

observed for SW experiments over the processing time. This chapter demonstrates how to 

apply RTD on different dairy products and relate several operating parameters, such as 

steam and product temperature, product flow and conductivity, etc., to indicate fouling 

formation in a falling film evaporators. The results of this Chapter will be submitted at Journal 

of Dairy Science1. 

 

 

The main aims of this chapter are to: 

- Use the RTD approach to indicate fouling in falling film evaporators 

- Relate the operating parameters to dairy fouling

APLICAÇÃO DA METODOLOGIA DE DISTRIBUIÇÃO DOS TEMPOS DE 

RESIDÊNCIA NO MONITORAMENTO DO FOULING DURANTE A 

CONCENTRAÇÃO DE DIFERENTES PRODUTOS LÁCTEOS EM UM 

EVAPORADOR DE PELÍCULA DESCENDENTE 

O objetivo deste capítulo é usar a metodologia do cálculo da distribuição dos tempos 

de residência para monitorar a formação de fouling causados pela concentração de 

produtos lácteos em um evaporador de película descendente (EPD), tais como leite 

desnatado, soro de leite doce e soro de leite ácido. A extensão da formação do fouling foi 

determinada através do cálculo do coeficiente de transferência de calor, eficiência 

energética, vazão mássica e tempo de residência médio dos concentrados no evaporador 

a vácuo. O coeficiente de transferência de calor e o tempo de residência médio do leite 

desnatado não se alteraram durante todo o tempo de processamento (420 min). No entanto, 

estes dois parâmetros diminuiram gradualmente em função do tempo para os experimentos 

realizados com soro de leite doce e ácido. Quando ocorre a formação de fouling, tanto o 

coeficiente de transferência de calor quanto o tempo de residência médio diminuem, devido 

a uma diminuição na capacidade de evaporação. Não foram identificadas perdas 

significativa dos componentes do leite desnatado antes e após a evaporação. No entanto, 

uma diminuição na composição mineral do soro de leite ácido foi observado. Este capítulo 

demonstra como aplicar DTR a diferentes produtos lácteos e como relacionar vários 

parâmetros operacionais, como temperatura do vapor primário e do produto, vazões 

mássicas e condutividade dos produtos, etc., para indicar a formação de fouling em 

evaporadores de película descendente. Os resultados do presente capítulo será enviado 

em outubro de 2015 para publicação no Journal of Dairy Science1. Os principais objetivos deste capítulo são: 

- usar a metodologia de DTR para indicar a formação de fouling em evaporadores de pelicula 
descendente 

- relacionar diferentes parâmetros operacionais ao fouling de produtos lácteos

7.1.  Introduction 

Falling film evaporators (FFE) are widely used in the chemical, refrigeration, 

petroleum refining, desalination and food industries (Kouhikamali et al., 2014). Their appeal 

is mainly due to the high heat transfer coefficient, low evaporation temperature and small 

temperature differences between the product and the steam (Silveira et al., 2015). FFE is a 

commonly used method in the dairy industry for the production of final (sweetened 

condensed milk, evaporated milk, etc.; Gänzle et al., 2008) and intermediate products before 

any further operations such as crystallization, precipitation, coagulation and drying (infant 

formulae, whey and milk powders, etc.) (Bimbenet et al., 2007; Schuck, 2002; Zhu et al., 

2011). Unfortunately a fouling layer accumulates on the inner wall of the evaporator tubes 

during processing, impairing optimal functioning of the equipment (Jeurnink et al., 1996), 

and resulting in a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient, an increased pressure drop and 

the formation of a biofilm (Langeveld et al., 1990; Visser and Jeurnink, 1997). 

Because of the decrease in the heat transfer coefficient that results from fouling, 

most evaporators do not have a constant production capacity. In petrochemical industries, 

pipe cleaning is carried out once a year, whereas in food-processing industries, it has to be 

done at least once a day (Ozden and Puri, 2010). The high frequency of cleaning periods 

results in shorter production times and higher consumption of water and cleaning agents, 

increasing economic costs and need to address ecological issues (Jimenez et al., 2013). 

Vacuum evaporators are heat exchangers, in which the major factors likely to 

generate fouling during the heat treatment of milk are the formation and the subsequent 

deposition of denatured whey protein molecules, the precipitation of minerals as a result of 

the decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates with increasing temperature, and the 

temperature difference between the heating surface and the liquid to be heated (Lalande 

and Tissier, 1985; W. R. Paterson, 1988). 



 

143 

 

Fouling during heat treatment is particularly problematic with concentrated products. 

Schraml and Kessler (1994) reported that during pasteurization of whey products, fouling 

increased to a maximum concentration of 250 g·kg-1 of total solids (TS), after which 

deposition decreased. The reason for the decrease was thought to result from two 

competing mechanisms: aggregation of whey proteins, which is a second order reaction and 

crystallization of salts, manly calcium phosphate (Fryer et al., 2011). 

Most studies on fouling and cleaning in the area of food engineering relate to 

pasteurization and sterilization processes, where temperatures are greater than 70°C. Chen 

and Bala (1998) showed that surface temperatures need to be above 70°C for significant 

surface fouling of milk to occur, but most milk evaporator parts operate below this 

temperature (Morison, 2015). Most of the fouling in milk evaporators should therefore not be 

assumed to be the same as the fouling reported in the case of sterilizers and pasteurizers. 

The progress made towards the reduction of fouling in FFE has been largely 

empirical. The aim of this study was therefore to demonstrate how to monitor the formation 

and extent of fouling in FFE using operating process data and how the formation of fouling 

contributes to modification of the process parameters and product quality. 

7.2.  Materials and Methods 

7.2.1.  Pilot vacuum evaporator 

The experiments were performed with the pilot scale, single stage falling film 

evaporator with the additional instrumentation (described in Chapter 4.2.2). 

All experiments were performed at an absolute pressure (Pabs) of 0.02 MPa, and thus 

the saturation temperature of evaporation was maintained at 60 °C throughout the three 

tubes. 



 

144 

 

7.2.2.  Experimental runs 

Experimental runs were carried out from a single experiment with concentrated 

solutions of skim milk (SM), sweet whey (SW) and lactic acid whey (LAW), at a feed mass 

flow rate of 70 kg·h-1. 

SM was reconstituted at 235.1 g·kg-1 of total solids (TS) from skim milk powder 

(Lactalis ingredients, Bourgbarré, France). Fresh concentrated SW and LAW were obtained 

from an industrial cheese manufacturer in Brittany (France) at 252.2 g·kg-1 and 257.7 g·kg-

1, respectively. The products were heated at 60°C in a preheater (Fig. 4.7) before entering 

the evaporator. 

The outlet concentrates were collected and analyzed after 30 min, and then every 

90 min (120 min, 210 min, 300 min and 390 min) during the evaporation process. For SM 

experiments the total process time was 420 min. For LAW and SW experiments, due the 

high levels of fouling deposits on the temperature and conductivity probes, the evaporator 

had to be stopped for manual cleaning of the probes. After cleaning the probes, the 

evaporator was re-started, and the operating conditions reestablished before resubmitting 

the product. Two stops of 60 minutes each were made for SW experiments, and one of 60 

minutes and another of 30 minutes for LAW experiments. 

7.2.3.  Chemical composition 

The feed and final total solids (TS), whey protein and ash content were determined 

according to section 4.4.1, 4.4.5 and 4.4.6, respectively. 

7.2.4.  Enthalpy characterization 

The overall heat transfer coefficient (U) was used to predict the extent of fouling in 

the last tube of the evaporator equipment. This parameter was calculated only for the last 

tube because the mass flow rate of the product was lowest at this point, leading to a lower 



 

145 

 

wetting rate of the tubes and higher concentration, viscosity and resistance to heat transfer 

(Morison et al., 2006). It could therefore be expected that the formation of fouling should be 

greater than in the other two tubes. 

Mass and enthalpy balance, overall heat transfer coefficient and assessment of 

process efficiency were calculated as described in chapter 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. 

7.2.5.  Measurement of residence time distribution 

Residence time distributions functions were calculated and modeled for the inlet to 

the outlet of the evaporator equipment (section ?) as described in 4.9.  

7.3.  Results and Discussion 

The total heat transfer coefficient was used to estimate the extent of fouling in the 

FFE, as described in Bermingham et al. (1999). Fig. 7.1 shows the evolution of U as a 

function of time for the three concentrated solutions studied. The blanks in the values of U 

for SW and LAW experiments corresponded to stops during the evaporation process to 

clean the conductivity and temperature probes (Fig. 4.7) and restarting of the evaporator.

At the beginning of the process (time = 0) the evaporator was clean and therefore 

the U values corresponded to the heat transfer coefficient for a clean surface. The values of 

U, calculated according to Eq. 4.4, were: 2.33 kW·m-2?°C-1, 2.52 kW·m-2?°C-1, and 2.11 kW·m-

2?°C-1, for SM, SW and LAW, respectively. Jebson and Chen (1997) obtained values for U 

between 0.8 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 3.08 kW·m-2·°C-1 for whole milk measured in several milk 

powder factories; Jebson and Iyer (1991) found values for U between 2.00 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 

3.50 kW·m-2·°C-1 for skim milk concentrated in five-effect evaporators. The small difference 

between the values of U for the three solutions studied at t = 0 may therefore be considered 

negligible on the scale of the experimental reproducibility. Moreover, the U values at the 

beginning of the process were similar whatever the dairy product to the mean value of 2.00 

kW·m-2·°C-1 reported by Silveira et al. (2013) for the same equipment. 

The value of U for the SM experiments remained constant during the 420 min of the 

evaporation process, which indicated that no fouling was present. Reconstituted milk results 

in less fouling than fresh milk, possibly explained by the fact that the materials which are 

responsible for forming the deposits on the heat exchanger surface has been partially 

removed during powder manufacture or are less active (e.g. denatured proteins already 

aggregated, or calcium phosphates already precipitated) after this step. For example, 

calcium concentration and ion activity is reduced by 9% and 11%, respectively (Jeurnink et 

al., 1996). Each of these factors may have contributed to the absence of fouling in SM 

experiments. 

For SW and LAW experiments, U gradually decreased over time, indicating the 

progressive formation of fouling. This decrease was more pronounced in LAW experiments. 

SW resulted in more fouling than SM due to the absence of casein micelles. Indeed, caseins 

hinder the transport of whey protein aggregates to the surface, and affect the association of 

whey proteins with calcium ions, thus resulting in aggregates less prone to fouling (Jeurnink 



 

148 

 

et al., 1996; Jeurnink, 1995; Varunsatian et al., 1983). LAW showed the highest fouling 

formation over time. As the pH of this concentrated solution is closer to the isoelectric point 

of whey proteins, leading to less electrostatic repulsion, the increased fouling formation 

could be due to greater probability of adsorption of whey proteins to the protein layer 

deposited and thus complexation of minerals for the protein layer. 

Table 7.1 shows the enthalpy balance values for the three dairy products studied. 

The EE decreased when fouling was identified. The EE was constant (77 ± 3 %) for SM 

experiments, since there was no fouling. The EE decreased from 73 % to 62 % and from 

75 % to 62 %, for SW and LAW experiments, respectively. This decrease was due to the 

increase in the heat transfer resistance between the steam and the product due to the fouling 

layer on the evaporator walls. However, the energy losses, q??, calculated according Eq. 4.3, 
remained constant and equal to a similar value (7 ± 1 %) to that found by Silveira et al. (2013) 

whatever the product. As q?? corresponds to the energy dissipated toward the evaporator 
environment, its value was not affected by fouling.

constant throughout the process time (43.7 ± 0.6 kg·h-1). As no fouling was identified for this 

product, the evaporation rate (26.5 ± 0.5 kg·h-1) and the TS content (379. ± 11.7 g·kg-1) of 

the outlet concentrate remained constant.

The evaporation rate decreased from 26.6 kg·h-1 to 18.7 kg·h-1 for the LAW 

experiments. However, the evaporation rate was constant for the SW experiments (25.3 ± 

0.4 kg·h-1), although U of the third tube decreased throughout the processing time. The small 

decrease in U during SW experiments was not sufficient to affect the evaporation rate. 

As discussed above, the formation of a fouling layer on the evaporator wall 

decreased the heat flow from the steam for the product, resulting in a decrease in the 

evaporation rate. Fouling thus caused a decrease in the concentration of the outlet product, 

from 398.5 g·kg-1 to 389.7 g·kg-1 and from 414.2 g·kg-1 to 351.2 g·kg-1 for the SW and LAW

experiments, respectively. This decrease is more important to LAW due to a higher fouling 

formation presented by this product. 

Table 7.3 shows the mean residence time, ?, of the three dairy products studied, 

calculated at different process times. As the operating parameters did not change for SM 

experiments, its ? was the same, 298 ± 1 s, throughout the process. However, ? decreased 

throughout the process for SW and LAW experiments. It decreased from 298 s at t = 30 min 

to 264 s at 210 min (Table 7.3) for LAW experiments. An increase in the outlet concentrate 

flow rate, and therefore in the flow speed of the product in FFE, was observed with fouling 

formation, in accordance with the decrease in the mean residence time determined here. 

The mean residence time thus decreased with fouling formation. However, the outlet mass 

flow rate of SW concentrates did not alter until 210 min, but nevertheless ? decreased. This 

shows that ? is not only influenced by the mass flow rate, but by other factors such a product 

concentration, flow profile and product interactions with the wall of the evaporator, etc. 

(Silveira et al., 2015). These findings indicate that ? expresses the extent of fouling in a more 

accurate way than the mass flow rate of concentrate.

The composition (%) of the products before and after evaporation are shown in Table 

7.4. The composition of the SM product remained constant before and after evaporation, as 

fouling was not evidenced for this experiment. For the SW experiments, a decrease in 

minerals was identified at 210 min: ash content values decreased from 6.1 % to 5.3 % 

between t = 120 min and t = 210 min, respectively. This may have been due to mineral 

precipitation contributing to the formation of mineral deposits on the wall of the evaporator 

tubes. A high fouling rate was identified for the LAW experiments (Fig. 7.1), although the 

composition of the product before and after evaporation remained constant. This 

phenomenon contradicts the loss of product components due to deposit formation. This may 

be explained by the high concentration of minerals in the LAW products (14.6 % in dry 

matter), especially calcium and phosphate. Even with a loss of minerals in the deposit 

(fouling formation), this loss (mass deposited on the wall of the evaporator tube) was much 

lower than the mineral content in the product, and was therefore not identified. The SW 

product presented a smaller quantity of minerals than LAW, and thus a small loss of mineral 

content caused a decrease in the mineral content in the final product, which could then be 

identified.

7.4.  Additional information 

The study of the extent of fouling formation presented above was related to the third 

evaporator tube (T3). However, this study was also performed for the first and second 

evaporation tubes (T1 and T2, respectively). Fig. 7.2 shows the evolution of U as a function 

of time for the three concentrated solutions studied in T1 and T2. As explained above, the 

blanks in the values of U for SW and LAW experiments corresponded to stops during the 

evaporation process to clean the conductivity and temperature probes and restart the 

evaporator. Fig. 7.3 shows the fouling found in the conductivity probes just after stopping 

the process.

Figure 7.3. Conductivity probe of the third evaporator tube after the first process stop. 

The U values for SM and SW measured in T1 were constant over all process times 

(3.2 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 2.5 kW·m-2·°C-1, respectively), indicating that no fouling formation 

occurred during the evaporation process. However, U values decreased over time for LAW 

experiments (Fig. 7.2 - A), thus indicating progressive fouling formation in T1. The U values 

for the three concentrated solutions studied remained constant over the process time in T2 

(2.5 kW·m-2·°C-1, 2.7 kW·m-2·°C-1 and 2.2 kW·m-2·°C-1 for SM, SW and LAW, respectively), 

therefore no fouling formation was detected in these tubes during the process. 

For SW experiments, fouling was identified only in T3 (Fig. 7.1), where the higher 

concentration and the lower flow rate of the product (end of the evaporation process) may 

have been the cause. For LAW experiments, fouling was identified in T1 and T3 (decrease 

in U over time) (Fig. 7.1 and 7.2 – B). Even with a higher concentration and lower product 

flow rate in T2 than in T1, fouling was not identified in this tube. This result shows that the 

LAW particles in the concentration range studied, which were more susceptible to the 

formation of fouling, attached to the wall of the evaporator tube more rapidly when submitted 

to a temperature difference (between heat steam and product evaporation temperature), 



 

156 

 

thus producing a fouling layer on the wall of this tube. The fouling identified in T3 must be 

due at a higher concentration and a lower mass flow rate of the product at this point, leading 

to a lower wetting rate of the tube and a higher heat transfer resistance in T3 than in the 

other evaporator tubes. 

Table 7.5 shows the operating parameters of the vacuum evaporator process and 

the physical-chemical properties of the three products studied at different process times for 

T1 and T2. As no fouling formation was identified in T1 and T2 for SM and SW experiments, 

the evaporation rate in these tubes remained constant. The evaporation rate was 8.5 ± 0.3 

kg·h-1 and 9.2 ± 0.3 kg·h-1 for T1 and T2, respectively.

beginning of the process (time = 30 min), and when compared to the same evaporator tube, 

the evaporation rate was the same regardless of the product. This result was similar to those 

found and discussed in Chapter 5, where the evaporation rate between different products 

(in process conditions without fouling) had the same values. 

For the experiments performed with lactic acid whey, the evaporation rate in T1 

decreased over the process time (8.3 kg·h-1, 5.7 kg·h-1 and 2.7 kg·h-1 at 30 min, 120 min 

and 210 min, respectively). This decrease in the evaporation rate was due to the high fouling 

formation in the evaporator tube and in the preheater (installed at the equipment inlet (Fig. 

4.7)), which increased the resistance of heat exchange between the hot fluid and the product. 

The lactic acid whey thus entered the equipment at a temperature below the evaporation 

temperature. As consequence part of heat exchanged by the steam in T1 was used to heat 

the product until its evaporation temperature (60°C) and not to evaporate it. This 

phenomenon, combined with the fouling formation in T1, contributed to a low evaporation 

rate in the first tube for lactic acid whey experiments. 

The values presented above (Table 7.3) correspond to the mean residence time of 

section ? (inlet to the outlet of the evaporator equipment). Table 7.6 shows the mean 

residence times for SM, SW and LAW in the vacuum evaporator equipment calculated at 

different process times and sections ?, ? and ?. The mean residence time, measured 

in the same section, was constant for the SM experiments during all processing times. The 

mean residence time for SW experiments only changed in section ? and after t = 120 min. 

This result was similar to that found in section ? (Table 7.3), indicating that the formation 

of fouling in the SW experiment occurred only in the last evaporator tube (T3). 

The mean residence time for LAW experiments decreased over the evaporation 

process for section ?. Therefore in section ? at t = 30 min this value was the same as 



 

158 

 

that of the SM and SW experiments. This result also shows that at t = 30 min, the formation 

of fouling in T1 was not sufficient to decrease the evaporation rate of the LAW experiments. 

The mean residence time in section ? for LAW experiments was constant until t = 120 min 

(56 s), decreasing at t = 210 min (52 s), although no fouling was detected and the 

evaporation rate was constant in this section (9.3 kg·h-1). This result was due to a lower 

evaporation rate in the previous evaporation tube (2.7 kg·h-1 – Table 7.5), thus causing an 

increase in product flow rate in sections ? and ? (T2 and T3). The increase in the product 

flow rate led to a decrease in the mean product residence time.

7.5.  Conclusions 

The residence time distribution approach was used to indicate fouling in a falling film 

evaporator during concentration of skim milk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey. Fouling was 

monitored by the calculation of the overall heat transfer coefficient, the energy efficiency, 

the evaporation rate and the mean residence time. During the concentration of sweet and 

lactic acid whey a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient, evaporation rate and 

energy efficiency occurred over the processing time. These phenomena were related to the 

formation of fouling deposits on the walls of evaporator tubes. The mean residence times of 

the products in the falling film evaporator were calculated. A decrease in this parameter was 

observed as a function of time. This phenomenon was related to the increase in the flow 

rate, due the fouling formation and therefore an increase of the product flow velocity, which 

in turn contributed to a low mean residence time. This parameter was more sensitive to 

identify fouling than the other operating parameters used in this study. 

The composition of the three concentrated dairy products was measured before and 

after concentration in the equipment. No significant loss of skim milk components was 

identified after evaporation. A decrease in mineral content was observed in the sweet whey 

experiment. Despite the high fouling rate identified in the lactic acid whey experiment, the 

composition of this product remained constant before and after evaporation. This 

phenomenon was related to the higher concentration of minerals in the lactic acid whey. The 

loss of this component in the deposits formed was much lower than the mass of minerals 

present in the product, which was therefore not identified. 

As these results were obtained from a single experiment, they need to be confirmed 

by further experiments. The work will be then submitted in the Journal of Dairy Science.

GE?ERAL C??CLUSI?? 
 

In the current context of intensification of global exchange, concentration and drying 

techniques are crucial for the dairy industry and this warrants investment in new types of 

concentration and drying research. Despite the fact that falling film evaporation is a widely 

used technique prior to the drying process, some essential aspects of the process such as 

product flow regime, residence time distribution, or key factors controlling product properties, 

etc., are not yet fully understood, thus resulting in variability of concentrate quality and 

process performance. As the concentrate properties contributes to the powder properties, 

the understanding of the vacuum evaporation process, especially with regards to 

modifications of the product by the process operating parameters, needs to be improved in 

order to predict the final product techno-functional properties. 

This thesis reviewed experimental thermodynamic and hydrodynamic studies based 

on the falling film evaporation of various dairy products. The study focused first on the 

evaporation of water, as a model solution (Newtonian behavior), then on skim milk, whole 

milk, sweet whey and lactic acid whey, which are involved in the elaboration of several dried 

dairy products, such as infant formulas and fitness products (e.g. Whey protein isolates). 

The first part of this PhD project aimed to instrument and characterize a pilot scale, falling 

film evaporator (FFE) that would, from a hydrodynamic point of view, describe the same 

process as the industrial equipment. The choice and position of the sensors used for the 

instrumentation of this pilot equipment, as well as the calculation of energy consumption and 

process performance, can be applied to industrial scale evaporators.  

Several operating data such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, conductivity, etc. 

were measured and recorded for the characterization of the vacuum evaporation process. 



 

161 

 

The sensors used for these measurements were positioned at different points in the 

equipment, in order to achieve thermodynamic balances and to monitor product dry matter 

during its concentration. The thermodynamic balances of the process made it possible to 

identify some limitations of the original equipment, such as poor distribution of certain 

products at the top of the evaporator tubes, barely regulation of the water sensor valves of 

the heating systems and lower wettability rate of the evaporator tubes for the products with 

higher total solids content, which resulted in a decrease in the evaporation rate. A cone-

shaped concave distributor system was designed, the heating regulation was improved and 

the inlet flow rate of the product was adjusted in order to overcome this limitations and to 

provide a sufficient wettability rate of the evaporator tubes for products with higher 

concentrations. 

Only the operating parameter (heating power, inlet product flow rate, etc.) modified 

the evaporation rate. Indeed, the evaporation rate calculated for given operating parameters 

values was constant, regardless of the product. It is of note that the heat transfer surface of 

this pilot (1.03 m2) is much lower than industrial scale evaporators considering the scale 

reduction applied. The results of the effectiveness of evaporation showed that suitable 

instrumentation (choice and siting of the sensors in the vacuum evaporation equipment) can 

result in good thermodynamic balance and identification of possible problems, thus 

improving the process performance. 

The second stage of this PhD project involved a hydrodynamic characterization of 

the vacuum evaporation process. Residence time distribution functions were used to 

characterize the flow profile of skim milk at three different total inlet solids and feed mass 

flow rates during its concentration in the three different sections of the FFE, and for the entire 

FFE (from the inlet to the outlet of the equipment). Methodology for the calculation of the 

experimental RTD curves, as well a model and the physical interpretation of this were also 



 

162 

 

developed. A combination of two perfectly mixed reactor tanks in series (reactor sets A and 

B) was developed to model the experimental RTD functions. Flow was characterized using 

experimental film Reynolds numbers (Ref). The results showed that the mean residence 

time of the product increased when the flow behavior changed from wavy-laminar to laminar 

flow. Increasing the concentration of skim milk and the distance covered by the product 

resulted in an increase in the dispersion of the particles. 

The model with two reactor sets in parallel was effective to model the RTD curves, 

in view of the very low standard deviations obtained. From the model interpretations, a main 

and a minor flow, consisting in two layers of product flowing through the evaporator tubes, 

were proposed. The minor flow would flow in contact with the inner surface of the tube and 

had a longer mean residence time. The main flow, which represented most of the product 

particles, would flow over the first layer, and had a shorter mean residence time. 

The last part of this PhD thesis consisted in the application of the thermodynamic 

and hydrodynamic approaches used to characterize the vacuum evaporation process. A 

study on the fouling during the concentration of skim milk, sweet and lactic acid whey during 

concentration in a FFE was performed. The results confirmed that lactic acid whey presented 

the greatest degree of fouling formation, followed by sweet whey. No fouling formation was 

identified for the skim milk experiment over the processing time of 420 min. However, this 

time may not have been sufficient for formation of skim milk fouling. 

The formation of fouling deposits on the walls of the evaporation tubes contributed 

to a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient, due to a greater resistance to be 

crossed by the heat flow. Therefore, an increase in the concentrated flow rate was observed 

with the increase in fouling formation due to a decrease of the evaporation rate. The 

evolution of these operating parameters thus caused a change in mean residence time, i.e. 



 

163 

 

a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient (U) leading to a decrease in the product mean 

residence time (?). However and despite the decrease of mean residence time, U and 

product mass flow rate remained almost constant whatever the processing time and the 

fouling deposit. This means that ? is not only influenced by the mass flow rate, but by other 

factors such as product concentration, flow profile and product interactions with the wall of 

the evaporator. These findings also indicate that ? variation due to fouling is more sensitive 

than the heat transfer coefficient and evaporation rate changes, it is another tool to fouling 

detection. 

Besides, no significant loss of skim milk components was identified after evaporation. 

However, a decrease in mineral content was observed over the processing time in the sweet 

whey experiment. Despite the high fouling rate identified in the lactic acid whey experiment 

related to the higher concentration of minerals in the lactic acid whey, the composition of 

lactic acid whey remained constant before and after evaporation. Even with a loss of 

minerals in the deposit (fouling formation), this loss was minor compared to the mineral 

content of the product, and could not therefore be identified. The sweet whey product 

presented a smaller quantity of minerals than lactic acid whey, and thus a small loss of 

mineral content caused a decrease in the mineral content in the final product, which could 

then be identified. Several operating parameters, such as steam and product temperature, 

product flow, conductivity and mean residence time were used to indicate the fouling 

formation of different dairy products in a FFE. 

Finally, the main innovative result of the PhD project was to highlight the impact of 

appropriate instrumentation combined with the understanding provided by process 

engineering that resulted in good characterization of the falling film evaporation process, 

which is an important operation in the dryer dairy industry in terms of energy consumption 

and final powder quality. This study emphasized the crucial role of process characterization 



 

164 

 

to improve the performance of FFE and product quality. Characterization of the evaporator 

process thus represents a potential way to tune process performance and thus achieve the 

anticipated functional properties of a concentrate.

FUTURE ?UTL??K 
 

The initial framework of this PhD project comprised a study of the vacuum 

evaporation process performed in a falling film evaporator. Despite being an important 

operation used to concentrate solutions in the food industry, there are few scientific papers 

concerning the concentration of dairy products in falling film evaporators. The industry has 

achieved expertise in this domain in an empirical way. This study presents approaches to 

thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of the falling film vacuum evaporation 

process, which is an essential step for studies of the interactions between product and 

process. The main focus of the future outlook is therefore modifications of the product during 

its concentration in a falling film evaporator. Considerable effort will be required in order to 

integrate understanding of the vacuum evaporation process into concentrate quality control 

and process performance. Specific development of new products will depend on the final 

application of the concentrate and therefore on its physicochemical and microbiological 

properties (protein denaturation, flavor, color reactions, nutritional aspects, etc.). 

Overall, this PhD project is an investigative study which demonstrated that good 

characterization of the process can provide valuable information on the optimal performance 

of the process and on final concentrate properties. From this starting point, various 

investigations can be proposed, in order both to consolidate any hypothesis developed in 

the PhD project and to extend understanding of modifications of product properties during 

vacuum evaporation and their likely influence on the performance of the process. Three key 

points emerged: i.e. control of product quality during the vacuum evaporation process, 

fouling formation and cleaning procedures. 



 

166 

 

Control of product quality during the vacuum evaporation process using residence 

time distribution functions 

As it is possible to calculate the residence time distribution function (RTD), and 

therefore the exact time that a given proportion of product particles takes to pass through 

the evaporator, the temperature profile of the product can be calculated during concentration 

in the vacuum evaporation process, because the evaporation temperature in such pilot 

equipment can be kept constant. 

The residence time distribution of a product in the vacuum evaporator equipment 

depends, among other things, on the operating parameters, such as the flow rate, 

evaporation temperature, heating power, etc. Study of the influence of the operating 

parameters on the RTD of different products will therefore provide elements to create models 

for prediction of changes in the minimum, mean and maximum product residence times. 

This information, combined with the temperature profile of the product, can thus be used to 

monitor some characteristics of the product during its concentration such as the rate of 

protein denaturation, destruction and / or growth of microorganisms, destruction of vitamins, 

Maillard reaction rate, etc. This information will make it possible to produce products with 

specific nutritional and techno-functional qualities, such as gelling properties and water 

binding capacity, and to optimize sensory properties (aroma, taste, and mouth-feel). Another 

application of the RTD function is in the study of fouling formation and cleaning procedures 

of the falling film evaporator. 

Fouling formation 

The extent of fouling formation of different dairy products during concentration was 

studied in a falling film evaporator. It was shown that fouling formation throughout the 

process time in the same operating conditions depends on the composition of the product. 



 

167 

 

The mass of the deposit formed for different products and operating parameters should 

therefore be measured and its composition determined. This requires methodology that 

ensures the complete removal of the deposit formed on the inner walls of the evaporator 

tubes. 

A device for collecting the deposit formed was developed (Fig. 1). This device is 

inserted at the bottom of the evaporator tubes and it is then removed from the top. It thus 

scrapes the inner wall of the evaporation tube, allowing collection of the deposits (Fig. 1 – 

B). However, this device collects deposits throughout the tube, i.e. in a qualitative way. It is 

therefore not possible to collect the deposit from a given section of the evaporation tube (e.g. 

only the deposits formed at the bottom or at the top of the tube). As the product properties 

change during passage through the tubes, the composition of the deposits must also change. 

Study of the composition of the deposits formed in different sections of the evaporator tube 

is therefore necessary. This information will provide the responses to questions such as how 

does the nature of the product influence fouling formation, what is the nature of product 

components deposited on the wall of the tube, and what is the best cleaning procedure to 

remove these deposits?

Vacuum evaporator cleaning procedures 

Evaporator cleaning procedures in the dairy industry are not standardized. Each 

industry has its own way of conducting the evaporator cleaning process, i.e. process time 

before cleaning, circulation time, order and concentration of the cleaning agents, etc. In 

other words, there are as many evaporator cleaning procedures as products to be 

concentrated. By optimizing the cleaning procedures, a reduction in energy costs and use 

of cleaning agents by 50% and 25%, respectively, can be achieved (Jeurnink and Brinkman, 

1994). The cleaning procedures of the falling film evaporator should be studied on the basis 

of measurement of product RTD in the vacuum evaporator and therefore the possibility of 

calculation of the time that different solutions take to pass through the equipment. The aim 

of such study is to optimize the cleaning and rinsing times, and the concentration of chemical 

cleaning agents used (nitric acid and sodium hydroxide). Moreover, a choice of a tracer or 

a solution property, such as conductivity, concentration, etc., should be established for 

A B 



 

169 

 

calculation of the RTD functions of the cleaning solutions. This should decrease the time, 

and therefore the cost, of rinsing and cleaning operations, which should also contribute to 

decreasing the costs of the vacuum evaporation operation and improvement of the 

sustainability of the process. Another stage in the study of cleaning procedures is the 

development of different strategies for cleaning the evaporator, such as determination of the 

best order of use of cleaning solutions (alkaline + acid or acid +alkaline) and their 

concentrations. The previous study of the nature of the deposits should therefore be useful 

to improve cleaning procedures.
