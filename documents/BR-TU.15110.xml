ABSTRACT

Most information on catfishes of the genus Aspidoras has focused species kept in aquaria, in non-natural
conditions. Biotic and abiotic parameters of environment inhabited by Aspidoras fuscoguttatus, associated
ichthyofauna, as well as strategies involved in the successful occupation of different microhabitats in a first
order stream, located in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo State, were investigated. Data collection was monthly
performed at three segments (headwaters, middle course, and mouth) from August 1999 to July 2000. The
greatest values of water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, width, depth, and current velocity
were obtained in the rainy season. Dissolved oxygen levels showed significant differences among three
segments in all sampling months, except for September. Substrate composition was predominantly sandy,
followed by silt and clay in middle course and mouth in rainy as much as in dry seasons. In headwaters a
large increase of the sandy fraction occurred in the rainy season. In the marginal and aquatic vegetation 30
species of macrophytes and 5 of macroalgae were identified. The fauna included tadpoles of Anura and
macroinvertebrates (Mollusca, Crustacea, Arachnida, and 8 orders of Insecta). A. fuscoguttatus was found
throughout the entire stream in sympatry with 6 fish species. In middle course, cluster analysis revealed an
association between A. fuscoguttatus immatures and low depth, suggesting a probable function of depth in
that stage of ontogenetic development of catfishes. The results indicate that A. fuscoguttatus present plasticity
in terms of microhabitat, including air breathing behavior in hypoxic conditions, previously unknown in
genus Aspidoras.

Key words: ecology, stream, microhabitat, Aspidoras fuscoguttatus, Callichthyidae.

RESUMO

Ecologia de um riacho da bacia do alto rio Paraná habitado por Aspidoras fuscoguttatus
Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker, 1976 (Siluriformes, Callichthyidae)

A maioria das informações disponíveis sobre cascudos do gênero Aspidoras é proveniente de observações
em aquário. No presente estudo, foram investigados aspectos da ecologia de Aspidoras fuscoguttatus em
um riacho de primeira ordem na região de São José do Rio Preto, SP, incluindo caracterização do ambiente,
levantamento da ictiofauna associada e análise de estratégias utilizadas na ocupação dos diferentes micro-
habitats do riacho. Os dados foram coletados mensalmente em três pontos (nascente, curso médio e
desembocadura) no período de agosto de 1999 a julho de 2000. Os maiores valores de temperatura,
condutividade elétrica, turbidez, alcalinidade, largura, profundidade e velocidade da água foram obtidos
na estação chuvosa. As concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido apresentaram diferenças significativas entre
os três pontos e em todos os meses amostrados, exceto setembro. Na composição do substrato, houve
predomínio de areia, silte e argila no curso médio e na desembocadura, tanto na estação chuvosa como na

seca. Na nascente ocorreu considerável aumento da fração arenosa no período chuvoso. Foram identificadas
na vegetação marginal e aquática 30 espécies de macrófitas e 5 de algas. Quanto à fauna, foram encontrados
girinos de Anura e invertebrados dos grupos Mollusca, Crustacea, Arachnida e 8 ordens de Insecta. A.
fuscoguttatus foi encontrado em todo o riacho em simpatria com 6 espécies de peixes. No curso médio, a
análise de agrupamentos revelou associação entre imaturos de A. fuscoguttatus e baixa profundidade,
evidenciando provável função da profundidade nessa fase do desenvolvimento ontogenético. Os resultados
indicam que essa espécie apresenta plasticidade em termos de microhabitat, incluindo comportamento de
respiração aérea em condições de hipóxia, inédito no gênero Aspidoras.

INTRODUCTION

The Neotropical fish fauna contains the largest
number of species in the world. However, knowledge
about the ecology and systematics of its fish com-
munities is relatively incomplete and geographically
restricted (Böhlke et al., 1978; Lowe-McConnell,
1999). The main groups of Neotropical freshwater
fishes include Characiformes, Siluriformes, Gymno-
tiformes, Cyprinodontiformes and Cichlidae (Britski
et al., 1999). Siluriformes constitutes one of the
dominant groups, with 15 families (Nelson, 1994).
One of them, the Callichthyidae comprehends small
armored South American catfishes characterized by
the presence of two lateral and longitudinal series
of body plates, three pairs of barbels and anterior
mouth. This family has approximately 165 species,
8 genera and 2 subfamilies: Callichthyinae (Callichthys,
Dianema, Hoplosternum, Lepthoplosternum and
Megalechis) and Corydoradinae (Aspidoras,
Corydoras and Brochis) (Reis, 1998).

In Callichthyinae some biological aspects have
been investigated as feeding (Saul, 1974) in
Callichthys callichthys (Linnaeus, 1758); repro-
duction (Ramnarine, 1995), behavior (Andrade &amp;amp;
Abe, 1997) and ontogenetical development (Ma-
chado-Allison, 1986) in Hoplosternum littorale
(Hancock, 1828), and ecology (Mol, 1996) in H.
thoracatum (Valenciennes, 1840). In Corydoradinae
few studies were made regarding spatial occupation,
feeding and reproductive period (Aranha et al., 1993)
in Corydoras aeneus (Gill, 1858) and Corydoras

gr. carlae Isbrücker, 1983, and populational
dynamics (Bervian &amp;amp; Fontoura, 1994) and
reproductive behavior (Pruzsinszky &amp;amp; Ladich, 1998)
in C. paleatus (Jenyns, 1842).

Most information available on catfishes of
the genus Aspidoras are restricted to the species
kept in aquaria, in non-natural conditions (Burgess,
1989). According to Britto (2000), almost all 17
Aspidoras species occur in limited areas of some
higher Brazilian river drainages, suggesting strong
endemism (Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker, 1976). Ecological
studies on this genus, in natural environment, are
scarce in Brazil. The only contribution dealing with
Aspidoras fuscoguttatus Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker, 1976
is that of Garutti (1988), analysing the longitudinal
distribution of fish fauna in a stream from
northwestern region of São Paulo State.
Furthermore, there are still relatively few papers
containing an ecological characterization of
headwaters and streams from plateau areas
inhabited primarily by small size fish species as
A. fuscoguttatus, including main aquatic biotic and
abiotic parameters.

Keeping this in mind, the aims of this work
were: 1) to describe the aquatic environment
occupied by A. fuscoguttatus (Fig. 1) focusing its
main biotic and abiotic characteristics; 2) to make
a survey of the fish species that occur in that
environment; and 3) to investigate the possible
strategies involved in the successful occupation by
A. fuscoguttatus of different microhabitats in a small
stream.

ECOLOGY OF A STREAM INHABITED BY Aspidoras fuscoguttatus 365

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study area
The field work was carried out in a nameless

stream situated in Engenheiro Schmidt, a district of
São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo State,  20o52’06”S-
49o16’40”W. It is a first order stream according to
Strahler (1957), typical of plateau region, draining
into a larger stream (Cedro Stream), which in turn
is a tributary of Preto River, draining into the Turvo
River. The Turvo River basin is part of the large
Grande River drainage basin, which belongs to the
Paraná River basin.

The regional topography is gentle and the relief
is undulated and relatively uniform. Total slope is
relatively small, the highest altitude reaching 550
m and the lowest 350 m. The soils are sandy and
result from rock decomposition of Bauru Formation,
with predominance of the sandy portion and a lower
contribution of the finer (silt-clay) portion (Arid et
al., 1970).

The original vegetation in the region of São
José do Rio Preto is almost entirely restricted to
the semi-deciduous marginal forests along the rivers
or stream courses. A recent survey made by the
Secretaria de Agricultura, São Paulo State, showed
the following proportions of the land use in that
region: 63% pastures, 6.4% annual cultured areas,

20% permanent cultured areas, 8% forests, and
2.6% unused or reforested areas.

The regional climate is the warm-moist tro-
pical type (Arid et al., 1970). The mean annual
temperatures are always higher than 25ºC, whereas
the mean of the coolest months (June and July) is
about 20ºC, and of the warmest months (January
and February) is about 30ºC. Annual rainfall range
from 1100 to 1250 mm, with a high concentration
(85%) from October to March, the rainy season, and
a low concentration (15%) from April to September,
the dry season (Arid &amp;amp; Barcha, 1973).

Sample collection
All material was monthly sampled at three stream

segments (headwaters, middle course, and mouth) from
August 1999 to July 2000, except for January. Sampling
was performed in the morning, between 7:10 and 11:40
am, in order to avoid diel variation of water physical
and chemical parameters. Preliminary observations
and collecting were undertaken from February to July
1999. Temperature was measured directly in the water
at a depth of 10 cm using a mercury thermometer
(–10ºC to 110ºC). Specific conductivity was determined
with a Crison field conductivimeter, model 524. Water
samples were collected and transported to the laboratory
for measurement of pH, turbidity, alkalinity, and
dissolved oxygen.

February 2000.

Measurements of pH were determined with
a Mettler Toledo digital pH-meter, model MP 220.
Dissolved oxygen (mg L–1) was determined by
Winkler method (Golterman et al., 1978). Alkalinity
(mg L–1) was analysed by potentiometric titration
according to Golterman et al. (1978). Turbidity
(FTU) was measured with a Micronal turbidimeter,
model B 250. All laboratory analyses for chemical
and physical variables were performed on the same
collection day with only one measurement, except
for dissolved oxygen which was measured in three
repetitions. Rainfall data were obtained from Es-
critório de Desenvolvimento Rural, Coordenadoria
de Assistência Técnica Integral, São Paulo State,
situated in Cedral, a town at a distance of 4 km from
the sampling site.

Fishes were collected with sieve (0.3 x 0.3
mm), casting net (0.9 x 0.9 mm), hand net (0.5 x
0.5 mm) and fish line. Vascular plants (terrestrial
and aquatic macrophytes), macroalgae and substrate
were sampled manually and with the aid of a small
spade.

The fishes were fixed in 10% formaldehyde
solution and after 48 hours transferred to 70%
ethanol solution for permanent storage. Algae were
preserved in 4% buffered formaldehyde. In the
laboratory, total length (TL) was taken with a calliper.
Voucher specimens were deposited in the fish
collection of Departamento de Zoologia e Botânica,
UNESP, São José do Rio Preto (DZSJRP 4414 to
4434 and 4436 to 4457).

For the microhabitat characterization, width
and depth (measured with tape-measure), current
velocity (estimated by the method of dislocation of
a floating object), marginal and aquatic vegetation,
and associated fauna (tadpoles and macroinver-
tebrates) were recorded. Two substrate samples,
collected in May 1999 (dry season) and February
2000 (rain season), were analysed according to
particle size classes by Allan (1995).

Statistical analysis
Differences in means for values of dissolved

oxygen among the stream segments (headwaters,
middle course and mouth) were tested by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent mean
separation by Tukey’s test with a 0.05 significance
level (Sokal &amp;amp; Rohlf, 1981). The value relative to

January 2000 (not sampled) was estimated by the
mean between anterior and posterior months. The
analyses were performed with the Minitab statistical
software (1996). Due to constant occurrence of some
variables (biotic and abiotic) only in middle course
along the study period, associations among these
variables and sampling months were assessed by
cluster analysis using Jaccard’s similarity coefficient
and unweighted group average method (UPGMA)
from the Fitopac 1 software (Shepherd, 1995).

RESULTS

Stream characterization
Seasonal fluctuations in temperature,

conductivity, pH, turbidity, alkalinity and rainfall
in three stream segments are given in Fig. 2.
Temperature ranged from 15ºC in headwaters
(winter) to 27ºC in mouth (summer). The lowest
temperatures were recorded from July to August,
while the highest values were observed from
December to March. Conductivity was higher in
February (rainy season) and lower in April (early
dry season). pH showed a narrow variation around
neutral in middle course and in mouth and lightly
acid in headwaters. Turbidity demonstrated a
remarkable seasonality with lower values during the
dry period and higher in the rainy period. Alkalinity
revealed maximum values in February and minimum
from August to December and from April to July.
Rainfall data presented high concentration (913.8
mm) from December to March (rainy season) and
low (60.9 mm) from April to July (dry season).

The lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations
were observed from August to March in head-
waters, while the highest were found from October
to February in middle course. ANOVA indicated
significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.001) for oxygen
among the three stream segments in all sampling
months, except for September. Tukey’s test
revealed significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) between
headwaters and middle course throughout the
study period, except for September and March.
Between headwaters and mouth, there were no
significant differences in September, December,
May and July, while between middle course and
mouth, the differences were not significant only
in September and June (Table 1).

Environmental parameters for microhabitat
characterization of each stream segment sampled
are summarized in Table 2. Substrate composition
in middle course and mouth during both seasons
was predominantly sandy, followed by silt and clay,
while in headwaters a considerable change in com-
position from dry to rainy season was verified
(Table 3).

Marginal vegetation in headwaters and middle
course showed open areas dominated by herbaceous
plants as Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Zingiberaceae,
Scrophulariaceae, Asteraceae, Polygonaceae,
Lamiaceae, Begoniaceae, Leguminosae, Lithraceae
and Commelinaceae, while near to mouth, shrubby-
arboreous shaded by riparian canopy were noted
as Melastomataceae, Boraginaceae, Hydrophyllaceae,
Leguminosae and Myrtaceae. Aquatic vegetation

in headwaters and middle course included filamen-
tous green algae (Spyrogira sp. 1, Spyrogira sp. 2,
Oedogonium sp., Microspora floccosa) and blue
algae (Phormidium cf. retzii), macrophytes as
Pontederiaceae (Heteranthera reniformis) and
Onagraceae (Ludwigia aff. suffruticosa, L. caparosa,
L. octovalvis, L. elegans). Adjacent vegetation
throughout the entire stream was represented mainly
by Poaceae.

Besides fishes, tadpoles of Hyla albopunctata
and macroinvertebrates as Mollusca (Planorbidae),
Crustacea (Macrobrachium sp.), Arachnida
(Araneae) and 8 orders of Insecta including Odonata
(larvae), Coleoptera (adult), Heteroptera (adult),
Diptera (larvae), Trichoptera (larvae), Hymenoptera
(adult), Lepidoptera (adult), and Phasmodea (adult)
were also registered.

ECOLOGY OF A STREAM INHABITED BY Aspidoras fuscoguttatus 369

Ichthyofauna
A total of 661 fish specimens, belonging to

6 families, 7 genera and 7 species were collected
at headwaters, middle course, and mouth of the
tributary stream of Cedro Stream (Table 4) of which
651 (98.5%) were sampled with sieve and 10 (1.5%)
with hand net, casting net and fish line.

Among the species reported, Aspidoras
fuscoguttatus and Gymnotus carapo occurred in
the three stream segments. The species with the
greatest number of collected individuals were A.
fuscoguttatus with 544 specimens (82.3%), P.
reticulata with 54 (8.2%) and G. carapo with 42

(6.4%). The spatial distribution of the fish species
showed a remarkable vertical stratification. Among
the 7 species sampled, immatures and adults of A.
fuscoguttatus were found in shallow (0.04 m) and
deep (0.23 m) stretches, respectively. P. reticulata
explored the water surface. G. carapo was captured
in deep and shadow pools, among the submerged
branches and roots of the marginal vegetation. H.
ancistroides was found in the bottom of pools. S.
marmoratus was captured in the macrophyte roots
(Ludwigia caparosa). O. pintoi and A. altiparanae
were encountered swimming actively at mid-water
of slow flowing areas.

Cluster analysis of biotic and abiotic variables
revealed four groupings in the middle course of
stream (Fig. 3). Group 1 includes two variables (A.
fuscoguttatus immatures and low depth) (87%) not
associated only in October and co-occurring in seven
months (August, September, March to July). Group
2 contains two aquatic organisms (Heteranthera
reniformis and Planorbidae) (83%) co-existing in
ten months (September, November to July). Group
3 presents three variables (tadpoles of H.
albopunctata, A. fuscoguttatus and low depth) (71%)
registered in five months (September, April to July).
Group 4 comprehends four variables represented
by Clorophyceae, H. albopunctata, A. fuscoguttatus
and low depth (58%) found in only four common
months (April to July).

DISCUSSION

During the study period, the stream occupied
by A. fuscoguttatus showed a remarkable seasonality,
with the highest values of water temperature,

conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, width, depth and
current velocity obtained in the rainy season.
Substrate composition presented a notable alteration
in headwaters probably due to stream dumping
provoked by the high amount of rain in February
(190.9 mm). The influence of these factors in water
quality associated with the changes in aquatic and
marginal vegetation and fauna accentuates the
importance of the microhabitats formed among the
aquatic macrophytes after the rainfall. Considering
the representatives of fauna hereby recorded, such
microhabitats may be contributing as refuge, source
of food, protection against predators and site of
reproduction for aquatic organisms.

The highest percentage of fishes sampled with
sieves was similar to that of other works. Pavanelli
&amp;amp; Caramaschi (1997), studying the composition of
the ichthyofauna of two streams (also in the Paraná
basin), captured more specimens (85%) with sieves.
Uieda (1984) investigating the seasonal, spatial and
temporal distribution of fish fauna in a stream in the
same basin also had more success with the use of sieves.

ECOLOGY OF A STREAM INHABITED BY Aspidoras fuscoguttatus 371

 In the present research, the low depth, small
size of specimens and abundant aquatic macrophytes,
especially during the rainy season, probably
contributed to achieve satisfactory results with sieves,
because the efficiency of sampling methods depends
on habitat features and biology of species (Uieda &amp;amp;
Uieda, 2001). The Neotropical ichthyofauna presents
the most diversified and richest freshwater
ichthyofauna of the world (Böhlke et al., 1978).
However, most studies focus mainly large rivers and
more commercially important species, while the
small size fishes (mostly less than 12 cm in standard
length), usually inhabiting streams and shallow
waters at the side of rivers, are restricted to few
investigations (Lowe-McConnell, 1999).

Garutti (1988) studying the ichthyofauna of
Barra Funda Stream, Preto River basin (approximately
14 km of length), recorded the same species found
in the present investigation, including A. fuscoguttatus,
found in this study in all sampling months and in the
three stream segments. Garutti (op. cit.) also verified
that the main characteristic in the longitudinal
succession was the addition of species, progressing
from the headwaters toward the mouth. Besides size
differences, addition of species was also evidenced
in this work, with 2 species occurring in headwaters
(A. fuscoguttatus and G. carapo), 5 in middle course
(A. fuscoguttatus, G. carapo, H. ancistroides, P.
reticulata, S. marmoratus), and 6 in mouth (A.
fuscoguttatus, G. carapo, H. ancistroides, P. reticulata,
O. pintoi, A. altiparanae).

Cluster analysis showed an ecological group
of A. fuscoguttatus immatures and low depth in the
middle course indicating a probable function of this
abiotic parameter in that stage of ontogenetic deve-
lopment. The association between the macrophyte
Heteranthera reniformis (Pontederiaceae) and the
mollusc Planorbidae also showed constancy along
the study period. According to Correa-Soares (1985),
H. reniformis constitutes source of food for
Biomphalaria tenagophila (Planorbidae) during all
months of the year.

The fish species composition encountered in
the tributary stream of Cedro Stream indicates that
in this stream some species are successful as A.
fuscoguttatus, which demonstrated a plasticity in
terms of microhabitat, pH and dissolved oxygen.
In headwaters, specimens were captured in pools
or among macrophytes roots (Brachiaria sp.)
throughout sampling months; in middle course,

immatures were collected in low depth and in the
macrophyte Heteranthera reniformis, while adults
were found in deep and shallow stretches, and in
mouth, the catfishes were sampled in pools or riffles.
Such plasticity can be reinforced by a preliminary
sampling performed in February 1999, when it was
observed an air breathing behavior for this species
in headwaters with a dissolved oxygen concentration
of 1.0 mg L–1. Some representatives of the subfamily
Callichthyinae exhibit air breathing as Hoplosternum
thoracatum (Gee &amp;amp; Graham, 1978), H. littorale and
Callichthys callichthys (Carter &amp;amp; Beadle, 1931),
and Megalechis personata (Mol et al., 1999). In
Corydoradinae there are evidences only for Brochis
splendens (Gee &amp;amp; Graham, 1978) and Corydoras
aeneus (Kramer &amp;amp; McClure, 1980). Therefore, based
on indicators above mentioned, there is a hypothesis
that must be tested aiming to know if A. fuscoguttatus
is the first recorded species of the genus with air
breathing as an adaptation to hypoxic waters.

Pronounced differences among dissolved
oxygen concentrations along the study period were
found. The lowest oxygen levels were obtained in
headwaters as verified by Necchi (1992) also in the
region of São José do Rio Preto. Besides the
characteristics inherent to each stream segment, the
variation in the amount of oxygen in the three
sampling sites suggests adaptative strategies that
enable A. fuscoguttatus to inhabit the whole stream
with its distinct microhabitats. Thus, considering
that some Aspidoras species are very appreciated
in aquaria as A. fuscoguttatus (pers. obs.), A.
pauciradiatus and A. menezesi (Pinkerton, 1987),
A. raimundi (Schindler &amp;amp; Staeck, 1996), ecological
data obtained in natural environment, as did in this
study, can contribute to the production of these
ornamental fishes in artificial conditions, reducing
the irregular and predatory extraction made in the
Brazilian hydrographic basins.
