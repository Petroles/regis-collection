ABSTRACT: We present new U-Pb zircon ages and Sm-Nd-Pb 
isotopic data for volcanic and hypabyssal acid rocks from the north-
ernmost exposure of the Acampamento Velho Formation in the NW 
portion of the Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield, Brazil. The first volcanic 
episode, grouped in the high-Ti rhyolites from the Tupanci hill, 
shows age of 579 ± 5.6 Ma, which is in agreement with the post-colli-
sional Acampamento Velho Formation volcanism in the Bom Jardim 
Group of the Camaquã Basin. A poorly constrained age of 558 +/- 
39 Ma was obtained for rhyolites from the low-Ti group at the Pica-
dos Hill, which may indicate a younger acid volcanism, or a greater 
time span for the volcanism of the Acampamento Velho Formation in 
southernmost Brazil. Regarding magmatic sources, Sm/Nd isotopic 
data coupled to Pb isotopes and a review of trace element geochem-
istry indicate different amounts of Paleoproterozoic (Dom Feliciano, 
Pinheiro Machado Suite) to Neoproterozoic (Rio Vacacaí terrane) 
lower crust melting. Our data, coupled with literature data, contrib-
ute to a better understanding of the stratigraphic evolution for the 
Neoproterozoic post-collisional volcanic successions of the Camaquã 
Basin in the Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield.

RESUMO: Novas idades obtidas por meio do método U-Pb em zircão e 
dados isotópicos Sm-Nd-Pb são apresentados para as rochas vulcânicas e hi-
pabssais ácidas da exposição mais setentrional da Formação Acampamento 
Velho na porção NW do Escudo Sul-Rio-Grandense, Brasil. O primeiro epi-
sódio vulcânico, agrupado nos riolitos alto-Ti do Cerro Tupanci, possui ida-
des de 579 ± 5,6 Ma, o que está de acordo com dados da literatura para o 
vulcanismo pós-colisional da Formação Acampamento Velho na Bacia do 
Camaquã. Idades de 558 +/- 39 Ma foram obtidas para o grupo de riolitos 
baixo-Ti no Cerro dos Picados, o que pode indicar um episódio vulcânico 
mais recente ou um período de tempo maior para o vulcanismo da Forma-
ção Acampamento Velho no Sul do Brasil, embora o grau de incerteza nos 
dados seja alto. Em relação às fontes magmáticas, os dados isotópicos de Sm-
-Nd acoplados a isótopos de Pb e uma revisão da geoquímica de elementos-
traço indicam diferentes graus de fusão de crosta inferior paleoproterozoica 
(Suíte Dom Feliciano, Pinheiro Machado) a neoproterozoica (Terreno Rio 
Vacacaí). Os dados apresentados neste estudo, quando analisados em con-
junto com dados da literatura, contribuem para a melhor compreensão da 
evolução estratigráfica das sucessões vulcânicas neoproterozoicas pós-colisio-
nais da Bacia do Camaquã no Escudo Sul-Rio-Grandense.

INTRODUCTION

The Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield (SRGS) in southernmost 
Brazil is constituted by rocks related to the Brasiliano/Pan-
African orogenic cycle emplaced in a Paleoproterozoic met-
amorphic basement (Hartmann et al. 1999, Soliani et al. 
2000, Nardi et al. 2008). The magmatism in this era was 
developed in two main phases: arc-related environment, 
with ages from 850–700 Ma; and post-collisional environ-
ment (Liégeois 1998), with ages from 650–535 Ma, marked 
by magmatism along transcurrent shear zones (Fernandes 
et al. 1995, Babinski et al. 1997, Bitencourt &amp;amp; Nardi 2000, 
Chemale Jr. 2000, Hartmann et al. 2000, 2007, Nardi &amp;amp; 
Bitencourt 2009). 

The post-collisional stage in the eastern portion of the 
SRGS is marked by a shear belt with voluminous granitic 
magmatism in the Pelotas Batholith (Philipp et al. 2000). 
General aspects of this extensive granite production episode 
in the Pelotas Batholith include syn-transcurrent, high-K, 
calc-alkaline and peraluminous granites that evolve to sho-
shonitic affinity and late to post-transcurrent, dominantly 

metaluminous alkaline granites (Philipp &amp;amp; Machado 2005). 
Excluding the leucocratic peraluminous granites, all granitoid 
types have basic magmatic rocks associated, normally repre-
sented by mafic microgranular enclaves and dykes in com-
mingling systems (Bitencourt &amp;amp; Nardi 2000). Western and 
northwestern portions of the SRGS represent less deformed 
areas, with volcano-sedimentary sequences associated with 
the Camaquã Basin (Fig. 1). Magmatism in the W and NW 
portion of the SRGS developed mainly between 650–530 Ma 
and shares a similar geochemical evolution as observed in 
the eastern part of the SRGS, with the presence of high-K, 
calc-alkaline granitoids, shoshonitic and tholeitic pluto-
no-volcanic sequences (Nardi et al. 2008). The sedimen-
tary sequences in the Camaquã Basin evolve from shallow 
marine in the Maricá Formation to lacustrine and alluvial 
in the Bom Jardim and Camaquã groups (Paim et al. 2000).

Magmatism in the Bom Jardim Group is related to the 
Lavras do Sul Shoshonitic Association, which is plutonic 
and volcanic basic to acid rocks mainly with ages between 
610–590  Ma (Lima &amp;amp; Nardi 1985). Volcanism in the 
Bom Jardim Group (Fig. 1) was established predominantly

Geochronology of high-silica volcanism at the Tupanci, RS



under subaerial conditions and has been described in detail 
by Wildner et al. (2002) and Lima et al. (2007). The first 
volcanic episode was between 585–590 Ma (Janikian et al. 
2008) and is dominantly characterized by intermediate 
rocks with shoshonitic affinity (Bom Jardim Group, Hilario 
Formation). This volcanic episode is followed by a bimodal 
volcanism with sodic mildly alkaline volcanism (Bom 
Jardim Group, Acampamento Velho Formation) and ages 
between 560–550 Ma at the Ramada Plateau (Matté et al. 
2016, Sommer et al. 2005a) and 574 Ma at the Passo do 
Salsinho Region (Chemale Jr. 2000, Janikian et al. 2008). 
The Acampamento Velho Formation (AVF) is the extrusive 
counterpart of the voluminous granitic magmatism, mostly 
metaluminous with minor peralkaline components, gener-
ated in the Brasiliano–Pan African cycle (Nardi &amp;amp; Bonin 
1991). This episode is mainly exposed in volcanic plateaus 
and ridges composed mostly of acid effusive and pyroclas-
tic rocks with minor intermediate and basic components 
(Sommer et al. 2005a, Wildner et al. 2002, Almeida et al. 
2002). Eruptive periods were initiated with explosive epi-
sodes and closed by effusive events (Sommer et al. 2006). 
The best exposures of this volcanic sequence are in the 
Ramada Plateau (Vila Nova do Sul City), Taquarembó Plateau 
(Dom Pedrito City), Bugio and Perau Hills (Caçapava do 
Sul area, Santa Bárbara Hill), besides the Tupanci region, 
the northernmost exposure of this volcanism in the SRGS. 
Although some research has been developed in the depos-
its of the Tupanci region (Menegotto &amp;amp; Medeiros 1976, 
Roisenberg et al. 1986, Leitzke et al. 2015), integrated and 
detailed geochemistry, geochronology and isotopic data are 
scarce for this area. 

Therefore, this paper focuses on dating and isotope sys-
tematics of acid volcanic rocks from the AVF in the Tupanci 
region, Brazil. We present new zircon U-Pb geochronological 
data for the high-silica volcanic successions, which coupled 
with Sm-Nd-Pb isotope systematics, and whole-rock geo-
chemistry from literature data, enabled to better constrain 
the magmatic source and genesis of acid volcanic associations 
that occur in neoproterozoic post-collisional tectonic settings.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The SRGS (Fig. 1) is the southern portion of the 
Mantiqueira Province, located in the Rio Grande do Sul 
state, Brazil (Almeida et al. 1981). This shield includes 
rocks related to Brasilian–Pan African neoproterozoic oro-
genic cycle and a metamorphic basement of paleoprotero-
zoic age, constituted by remaining fragments of the Rio 
de la Plata Craton (Teixeira et al. 2004). Well-preserved 
volcano-sedimentary sequences linked to magmatism in 

the collisional and post-collisional stages of the Brasilian 
orogenic cycle (Sommer et al. 2005a) are grouped in the 
Camaquã Basin (CB).

The CB is a retroarc basin that includes a set of preserved 
sedimentary and volcanogenic units, which were deposited 
between 620 and 535 Ma (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1991, 
Gresse et al. 1996, Brito Neves et al. 1999, Chemale Jr. 
2000, Fragoso-César et al. 2000, 2003, Paim et al. 2000, 
Sommer et al. 2006, Janikian et al. 2008, 2012). The base-
ment of the CB is heterogeneous and ranges from paleopro-
terozoic granulitic complex to associations of metamorphic 
and deformed igneous rocks related to the Brasiliano–
Pan-African orogeny (Paim et al. 2000, Lima et al. 2007). 
The evolution of the CB includes an alternation between 
accumulation periods, with the predominance of volca-
no-sedimentary sequences and erosional periods. The sedi-
mentary sequence of CB is represented (Borba et al. 2007) 
from base to top by: 

 ? Maricá Formation, with marine and coast deposits; 
 ? Bom Jardim Group, with alluvial deposits intercalated 

with andesites, acid effusive and pyroclastic rocks (Hilário 
and Acampamento Velho formations); 

 ? Camaquã Group characterized by fluvial, lacustrine 
and aeolian continental deposits (Santa Barbara and 
Guaritas formations). 

These stratigraphic units evolved mainly in continental 
environments and the volcanism under subaerial conditions 
(Wildner et al. 2002). 

Volcanic cycles in the CB occurred during a transition 
between a collisional and post-collisional period devel-
oped from the Neoproterozoic III to the Early Cambrian 
during the Brasiliano–Pan-African orogeny. The magmatic 
source of these rocks is probably related to partial melting 
of a lithospheric mantle previously chemically affected by 
a subduction process (Nardi &amp;amp; Bonin 1991, Wildner et al. 
1999, 2002, Nardi &amp;amp; Lima 2000, Almeida et al. 2005, 
Sommer et al. 2006). Sommer et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2006) 
suggest that these volcanic cycles represent preserved portions 
of a typical evolutionary sequence from a post-collisional 
magmatism (from Liégeois 1998), with shoshonitic affin-
ity rocks in the early stages, chemically affected by subduc-
tion-related processes, followed by silica-saturated bimodal 
volcanic sequences, with sodic-alkaline affinity and finally 
by tholeitic rocks.

of the SRGS (Fig. 2). Acid igneous rocks occur as shallow 
intrusions (hypabyssal rocks) at the Tupanci Hill and as 
lava flows (porphyritic rhyolites) and pyroclastic deposits 
(ignimbrites) at the Picados Hill. In this section, we will 

summarize the main petrographic and geochemical features 
of both occurrences, which were studied in detail by Leitzke 
et al. (2015) and are necessary for the interpretation of new 
isotopic data reported in this study.

Geochronology of high-silica volcanism at the Tupanci, RS



Summary of facies analysis, 
petrography and whole-rock geochemistry

Picados Hill area
Volcanic rocks in the Picados Hill area (Fig. 2) have effu-

sive and explosive origin. The rhyolitic rocks are porphyritic, 
and the best outcrops are dominantly in the north-central 
portion of the hill. Pyroclastic rocks have a high degree of 
welding and predominate in the southern portion of the 
area. In this region lapilli-size fragments, with abundant 
lithic fragments, predominate. Predominantly, reomor-
phic portions are less abundant, being mostly ash-size crys-
tal-rich fragments. 

The effusive regime is characterized by porphyritic rhy-
olites with phenocrysts of quartz and sanidine set in an 
aphanitic glassy matrix (Figs. 3A-3D). Igneous flow foliation 
is mainly sub-horizontal and shows some autobrecciated 
portions (Fig. 3E). Microphenocrysts of opaque minerals, 
zircon and apatite occur as accessory minerals. Mafic min-
erals are predominantly biotite and chlorite, possibly orig-
inated by alteration of amphiboles. The biotite grains are 
subhedral, with diameter from 0.5–1 mm, ranging from 
brown to green and poikilitic texture. Biotite aggregates 
associated with chlorite has almost entirely replace amphi-
bole crystals. The very fine matrix consists of a micro to 
cryptocrystalline quartz-feldsphatic arrange. Devitrification 

processes are common and several stages are observed, 
with spherulitic, axiolithic texture and granophyric inter-
growths (Fig. 3F).

Explosive volcanism in the area is characterized by poorly 
selected ignimbrites with fragments ranging from ash to 
lapilli size, consisting of rock, crystal and glass fragments 
(Fig. 4). The ignimbrites are strongly welded and have rhy-
olitic composition. These rocks may be divided into two 
facies: lithic-rich ignimbrites (IgL); and rheomorphic crys-
tal — rich ignimbrites (IgnReo). 

The IgL corresponds to poorly selected brownish to 
pink color rocks with predominance of lapilli size fragments 
(Fig. 4A) immersed in a tuffaceous matrix. Lithic fragments 
are common and constituted by fragments of rhyolites and 
ignimbrites. Fragments of pumice (Fig. 4) occur in various 
sizes in the matrix and as lapilli fragments (Fig. 4). They are 
devitrified to a quartz-feldpathic granophyric arrangement 
with a low degree of flatenning, even though in some por-
tions of the rock it is possible to identify an incipient eutax-
ithic texture. Alteration processes leave a reddish-brown 
clay-rich layer over the fragments. Quartz and alkali-feldspar 
crystal fragments are few. These mineral phases also occur as 
phenocrysts, with similar sizes, subhedral to euhedral and 
some of them preserved within the pumices. The matrix is 
extremely fine and supported by shards with spike geome-
try, with lengths smaller than 0.5 mm (Fig. 4B).

Figure 3. Summary of macro and microscopic features of representative effusive rocks at the Tupanci and Picados 
Hill (cf. Leitzke et al. 2015): (A) porphyritic rhyolite with glassy matrix; (B) fractured sanidine phenocryst in

(F) spherulites showing evidence for high-temperature devitrification of the matrix.

Rheomorphic ignimbrites in the area are characterized 
by high degrees of welding (Fig. 4C) and a great amount 
of crystal fragments (phenocrysts and fragments) in a very 
fine-grained eutaxithic and often parataxithic matrix. 
These factors can be used to characterize them as “lava-like” 
ignimbrites (Ekren et al. 1984). Pyroclastic fragments are 
predominantly represented by quartz and alkali feldspar and 
stretched/deformed pumices (Fig. 4D). The lithic fragments 
are rare and, when observed, have rhyolitic composition. 
Pumice fragments are flattened (fiamme) and devitrified to 
quartz-feldspar aggregates. 

Tupanci Hill area
The Tupanci Hill area comprises a N-S elongated subvol-

canic body with a dominant NE-SW fault pattern. The main 
lithology is represented by porphyritic rhyolites with phe-
nocrysts of sanidine and quartz surrounded by an equi-
granular-fine-grained to aphanitic quartz-feldspar matrix, 
with a strong flow foliation on border regions, where phe-
nocrysts are substantially smaller in size. Spherulites occur 
in the matrix or around phenocrysts, showing evidence for 
high-temperature devitrification processes (Logfren 1971). 
Microphenocrysts of opaque minerals (pyrite), zircon, apatite 
and altered mafic minerals occur as accessories. Mafic miner-
als are rare and occur altered to chlorite. Small (? 0.05 mm) 
acicular crystals of late crystallization sodic amphibole 
(arfvedsonite) occur in the matrix, suggesting a peralkaline 
affinity. Fragments of sedimentary wall rocks of the Maricá 

Formation occur as xenoliths. Microfolded portions, rotated 
and fractured crystals (microbreccias) are also observed on 
the border of the intrusion, generating “tuff-like” textures 
similar to eutaxitic and parataxitic textures in pyroclastic 
rocks (Manley 1995), common in rhyolitic systems due to 
the high viscosity of the flow (Figs. 4E and 4G). 

Whole-rock geochemistry
The geochemical features of both groups of rocks were 

described in detail by Leitzke et al. (2015) and are simi-
lar for major elements, but show distinct aspects regard-
ing trace elements. The rocks have high contents of SiO2 
(73 to 77 wt.%), alkalis (Na2O+K2O &gt; 8.4 wt.%) and FeOt/
(FeOt+MgO) (&gt; 0.9); with low contents of Al2O3, CaO and 
MgO; and  agpaitic index close to the unity (&gt; 0.9). At the 
Nb/Y versus Zr/TiO2 classification diagram, these rocks are 
classified as rhyolites, which are confirmed by the Zr/TiO2 
versus SiO2 diagram, in which some samples are classified 
as alkali rhyolites (Fig. 5). Major and trace elements data 
allowed the identification of two different evolutionary trends: 
low and high-Ti, related respectively to the effusive/pyroclastic 
rocks of the Picados Hill and subvolcanic rocks of Tupanci 
Hill (Leitzke et al. 2015). The same behavior is observed 
for trace and rare earth elements (REE) in multi-element 
variation diagrams. Zr contents are higher than 500 ppm 
for the high-Ti group that indicates, according to Leat et al. 
(1986), a peralkaline affinity for these rocks. On the other 
hand, the low-Ti group has Zr contents not higher than 
420 ppm. Ba and Sr contents are &gt; 70 and 8 ppm in the 
high-Ti group and &amp;lt;16 and 6 ppm, respectively. Rb dis-
plays high contents in both groups, but concentrations are 
much higher in the low-Ti group (&gt; 170 ppm) than in the 
high-Ti group (&amp;lt;100 ppm). Nb, Y and Ga behave in a sim-
ilar way, with higher contents for the low-Ti group (&gt; 50, 
130 and 25 ppm) compared to the high-Ti group (&lt; 30, 
70 and 26 ppm). High contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga and Rb 
and low contents of Ba and Sr for rocks of both groups 
(cf. Leitzke et al. 2015) are characteristic of acid magma-
tism with alkaline affinity (Pearce et al. 1984, Whalen et al. 
1987, Nardi 1991). 

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

This work presents a new isotopic dataset (zircon U-Pb, 
Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb) obtained on volcanic and hypabyssal 
rocks from the Tupanci area, which are coupled to whole-
rock geochemistry data (Leitzke et al. 2015) to provide a 
better understanding of the evolution of the Acampamento 
Velho volcanism in the SRGS. Two samples of the Tupanci 
Hill (TH), which belong to the high-Ti group and consist

of porphyritic rhyolites, were selected for isotope analysis 
and one for zircon U-Pb dating (CT-38). In the Picados 
Hill (PH), three samples of the low-Ti group were selected 
for isotope determination. Additionally, a porphyritic rhy-
olite (sample CT-66) was selected for zircon U-Pb geochro-
nology. Location of selected samples for the U-Pb zircon 
separation and isotopic measurement are given in Figure 2. 
Isotopic analyses were conducted at the University of São 

Paulo (USP) and at the Federal University of Rio Grande 
do Sul (UFRGS), and are described in detail in the follow-
ing sections.

Zircon U-Pb geochronology 
(U-Pb LA-ICP-MS)

Approximately 0.5 kg of sample material was crushed, 
pulverized and sieved for zircon separation. The zircon grains 
were concentrated using conventional magnetic and heavy 
liquid techniques, after which more than 300 grains were 
handpicked and mounted in epoxy resin. From this popula-
tion, 13 grains were analyzed from the high-Ti group (sam-
ple CT-38) and five grains from the low-Ti (sample CT-66). 

The mount was polished using different granulomet-
ric pastes of diamond to expose the internal surfaces of the 
zircon. For the dating, the zircon grains were imaged using 
backscattered electrons and cathodoluminescence to deter-
mine their internal structures and crystallization phases. Only 
zircon grains without imperfections, fractures, and min-
eral inclusions were selected for isotopic analyses. All U-Pb 
isotopic analyses were performed at the Geochronological 
Research Center of the Geoscience Institute, USP, using a 
Thermo Fischer Scientific Neptune inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and a 193 nm excimer 
laser ablation (LA) system (Photon Machines - Redmond, 
Washington, USA).

The details of the ICP-MS configurations and the laser 
parameters used during the analyses are available in Oliveira 
et al. (2015). The analytical procedure of the U-Pb method 
included the analysis of the materials in the following 
sequence: two blanks, two synthetic glass NIST standards , 
three external reference materials, 13 samples, two external 
reference materials, and two blanks. Each experiment con-
sisted of 40 cycles of 1 s/cycle. The 204Hg interference for 
204Pb was corrected using 202Hg, in which 204Hg/202Hg = 4.2. 
Both NIST glass and external reference material were used 
to normalize the 207Pb/206Pb ratio, whereas the external ref-
erence material was used to normalize the 238U/206Pb ratio. 
The standard GJ-1 (602 ± 4.4 Ma; Elhlou et al. 2006) was 
used as the external reference material. Zircon typically con-
tains low concentrations of common Pb. Thus, the reliability 
of the measured 207Pb/206Pb and 238U/206Pb ratios critically 
depends on accurately assessing the common Pb compo-
nent. The residual common Pb was corrected based on the 
measured 204Pb concentration using the known terrestrial 
composition (Stacey &amp;amp; Kramers 1975).

External errors were calculated using error propagation 
for the individual measurements of the standard GJ-1 and 
the individual zircon sample measurements (spots). The ages 
were based mainly on 238U/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb ratios and 
calculated through Isoplot software version 4.0 (Ludwig 2008).

Sm-Nd and Pb isotopic measurements
Isotopic analyses of Sm, Nd and Pb were carried out at 

the Isotope Geology laboratory of the UFRGS by thermal 
ionization mass spectrometry using a VG Sector 54 mul-
ticollector mass spectrometer. Whole rock samples were 
powered in agate mortar in order to get fraction lower than 
200 mesh. Then, the samples were digested together with 
a 149Sm/150Nd spike through concentrated HF-HNO3 and 
HCl in 7 mL teflon vials in a hot plate for seven days. After 
complete digestion, the samples were dried down and redis-
solved in 2.5 N HCl, and the REE were separated by using 
standard cation exchange chromatography with a DOWEX 
AG 50X8 resin (200–400 mesh) using 6 N HCl. Nd and 
Sm were separated from the other REE by using HDEHP 
LN resin (50–100 mm) and collected after elution with 0.18 
N HCl for Nd and 0.5 N HCl for Sm. Pb was separated 
using DOWEX AG 1X8 resin (200–400 mesh) with 0.6N 
HBr and 6 N HCl. The isotopic analyses were carried out 
in static mode. Sm and Pb were run on Re single filaments, 
while Nd isotopes were loaded on Ta-Re-Ta triple filaments. 
Sm, Nd and Pb were deposited with H3PO4, and the latter 
was also deposited with silica gel. Nd isotopic ratios were 
normalized to 146Nd/144Nd = 0.7219 and repeated measure-
ments of La Jolla Nd reference material furnished a mean 
143Nd/144Nd value of 0.511848 ± 0.000021 (1s; n = 100). 
Pb was corrected from a mass discrimination effect of 0.1% 
amu-1 based on 38 analyses of NBS-981 reference material. 
The total procedure blanks were lower than 500 pg for Sm, 
150 pg for Nd, and 100 pg for Pb. Typical analytical errors 
for 147Sm/144Nd and 206,207,208Pb/204Pb ratio were equal or better 
than 0.1%. Nd-TDM model ages were calculated according 
to De Paolo (1981). The decay constants recommended by 
Steiger and Jäger (1977) and Wasserburg et al. (1981) were 
used. The error for all isotopic data were lower than 25 ppm 
for Sm/Nd; 20 ppm for 143Nd/144Nd; and lower than 0.0020 
(SD absolute) for Pb isotopic analyses. 

RESULTS

Zircon morphology and U-Pb results
The zircon populations comprise elongate, prismatic, 

subrounded grains, rarely showing well-preserved bipyra-
midal faces. These grains show low length-to-width ratios 
from 2:1 to 14:1 (with the average of 5:1), which are char-
acteristics for deep-seated and slowly cooled intrusions 
(Corfu et al. 2003). Such morphological features suggest 

that zircon grains selected for the analysis are magmatic. 
Cathodoluminescence (CL) images of selected zircon grains 
(Fig. 6) from each sample allowed the recognition of inclu-
sions and fractures and metamictic domains, which were 
avoided during the analyses, whenever possible. Some zir-
con grains display darker cores developed during magmatic 
crystallization. Zircon crystals from sample CT-66 show 
clear signs of alteration (Fig. 6) and high contents of com-
mon lead (14 to 59%), which affected negatively on the 
ages obtained for this group of analysis. 

High-Ti rhyolite (sample CT-38)
Zircons from this sample are bright when analyzed 

through CL, although a few zircons exhibit either dark rims 
or dark cores (Fig. 6A). The U-Pb analytical data are pre-
sented in Table 1 and plotted in Concordia diagram (Tera 
&amp;amp; Wasserburg 1972), based on 207Pb/206Pb versus 238U/206Pb 
(Fig. 7A). All the zircon crystals have very high contents 
of U (1,679–4,296 ppm) and Th (1,089–4,086 ppm), 
but common Pb is still very low. Thirteen analyzed zircon 
yield a range in the 206Pb/238U ages from 559 to 605 Ma 
and all the analytical points are concordant. Therefore a 
Concordia age of 579 ± 5.6 Ma (mean square weighted 
deviation - MSWD = 0.16) has been calculated using these 
zircons (Fig. 7A), which is interpreted as the crystalliza-
tion age of this sample.

Low-Ti rhyolite (sample CT-66)
Zircon grains from this sample are invariably dark with 

many inclusions and no discernible zoning. When com-
pared to the sample CT-38, these zircons are not as clear, 
which reflect hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 6B). A few zir-
cons exhibit locally either dark rims or dark cores (Fig. 6B). 
The U-Pb analytical data are presented in Table 1, and plot-
ted in the conventional Concordia diagram (Whetherill 
1956) based on 238U/206Pb versus 207Pb/235U (Fig. 7B). 
The five analyzed fractions yield a range in the 207Pb/206Pb 
ages from 553 to 588 Ma and are discordant. A Discordia 
(Fig. 7B) using the five fractions yields an upper intercept 
at 558 ± 39 Ma with a low MSWD (0.70). This high error 
is due to the small number of crystals used for dating asso-
ciated with the high content of uranium, which may have 
been lost due to alteration and deterioration of the crys-
talline reticulum. 

Sm-Nd isotopic results
For Sm-Nd whole-rock determination and TDM age cal-

culation, five samples were selected: 

 ? Two from the high-Ti rhyolites of the Tupanci Hill 
(CT-37A, CT-37B); 

 ? Three samples from the low-Ti rhyolites of the Picados 
Hill (CT-47A, CT-49A, CT-50A). 

Table 2 shows the Sm-Nd isotopic results as well as 
the initial eNd values calculated at the time of emplace-
ment, which is yielded by the zircon U-Pb ages obtained 
in this study. For the high-Ti samples, a crystallization age 
of 579 Ma is assumed, while the age of 558 Ma is assumed 
for the emplacement of the low-Ti rhyolites. 

The set of results provided TDM model ages of 1.83 and 
2.22 Ga and more negative present day eNd(0) values of -17.47 
and -18.00 for the high-Ti rhyolites, while the low-Ti rhyolites 
exhibit negative eNd(0) values from -10.43 to -9.60. The eNd(t) 
of the high-Ti samples are of -12.15 and -11.15, while low-Ti 
samples show eNd(t) ranging from -11.21 to -10.09. The high-Ti 
rhyolites displayed homogeneous 147Sm/144Nd ratios of 0.125 
and 0.104, which are within the 0.080–0.120 range, usu-
ally considerable acceptable for TDM age calculation. On the 
other side, the samples of the low-Ti rhyolites have unusually

high 147Sm/144Nd ratios of 0.205–0.207, which is close to the 
value of depleted mantle (147Sm/144Nd = 0.225) and normally 
found in mafic rocks, which led to difficulties in interpreting 
model ages. The uncertainty in the age increases dramatically 
as the 147Sm/144Nd ratio of the samples approaches that of 
the depleted mantle. In this study, therefore, following the 
work of Harris et al. (1994) and DePaolo (1981), model ages 
obtained from samples with high 147Sm/144Nd ratios (&gt; 0.15) 
were not considered because they are unrealistic. 

Pb isotope systematics results
The high-Ti rhyolites show present-day Pb isotope compo-

sitions of 15.971?16.141 for 206Pb/204Pb; 15.113?15.128 for 
207Pb/204Pb, and 37.009?37.089 for 208Pb/204Pb. The low-Ti 
rhyolites display slightly lower Pb isotope ratios compared to 
the high-Ti rocks, although the 206Pb/204Pb ratios are within 
the same range. The ratios are 15.830?16.006 for 206Pb/204Pb; 
15.062?15.097 for 207Pb/204Pb; and 36.567?36.862 for 
208Pb/204Pb (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Timing and emplacement of volcanic 
episodes of the Acampamento Velho 
Formation in the NW of the SRGS

Recent geochronological literature data provided ages between 
549 and 573 Ma (Tab. 3) for the volcanic rocks of the AVF. 
At the Passo do Salsinho region, U-Pb SHRIMP zircon anal-
ysis in rhyolitic lavas revealed ages of 573 ± 18 Ma (Chemale 
Jr. 2000). Similar and more precise results of 572 ± 3 Ma were 
obtained through Pb/Pb isotopic ratio in zircon grains from 
granitoids of the Leões Ring Complex (Gastal &amp;amp; Lafon 2001). 
These granitoids are genetically associated with the volcanic rocks 
of the Taquarembó Plateau. U-Pb zircon analysis in volcanic 

rocks of the Ramada Plateau provided the age between 549 and 
560 Ma to the AVF volcanism, which suggests a greater time 
span for this volcanic episode in the SRGS (Sommer et al.

2005b, Matté et al. 2016). Analysis of two rhyolitic pebbles 
from the conglomeratic fluvial deposits of the basal portion 
of the AVF provided zircon U-Pb ages of 579 ± 13 Ma and 
569 ± 2.4 Ma (Janikian et al. 2012). However, these authors 
proposed the individualization of a new younger acid volcanic 
unit related to reactivation of extensional structures identified in 
Taquarembó Plateau, for which the crystallization age, obtained 
by U-Pb LA-ICP-MS method in lapilli-tuffs previously con-
sidered as part of the AVF, is 544.2 ± 5.5 Ma (Wildner et al. 
1999, 2002, Sommer et al. 2006). This was correlated with 
the U-Pb zircon SHRIMP age of 549.3 ± 5 Ma obtained by 
Sommer et al. (2005a) in hypabyssal rhyolites of the Ramada 
Plateau. The new age of 579 ± 5 Ma of the high-Ti rhyolites 
from the AVF obtained in this study is in agreement with those 
ones previously obtained in the literature (Chemale Jr. 2000, 
Janikian et al. 2005, 2008, Gastal &amp;amp; Lafon 2001, Sommer et al. 
2005a, 2006). For the age of 558 ± 39 Ma obtained in the 
low-Ti group, the high uncertainty associated with the data 
may indicate an overlap with the ca. 570 Ma event of the AVF, 
or suggest a younger volcanic episode at the Camaquã Basin 
(cf., Janikian et al. 2012, Matté et al. 2016).

Trace element geochemistry indicates that rocks from 
the high-Ti group were likely generated in a post-collisional 
setting, while those ones of the low-Ti group were gener-
ated in a progressive post-collision to intraplate setting (cf. 
Leitzke et al. 2015). Assuming this, it is expected that our 
geochronological results are coherent with the tectonic envi-
ronment, and, therefore, show distinct ages between both 
groups. Nevertheless, the poorly constrained age for the 

low-Ti group still does not allow to confirm the tectonic 
environment distinction between both groups. Regarding 
whole-rock trace element patterns, both high and low-Ti 
groups have high contents of HFSE (Zr, Nb, Y), Ga and 
Rb, together with lower contents of Ba and Sr (Fig. 8A), 
characteristic of acid magmatism with an alkaline affinity, 
typical of final stages of orogenic cycles, with sources previ-
ously affected by subduction-related metasomatism (Pearce 
et al. 1984, Whalen et al. 1987, Nardi 1991, Sommer et al. 
2005a). The magmatism of the AVF has been recognized 
to be produced from subduction-modified mantle sources, 
likely of EM1 type, during the final stages of Brasiliano–Pan-
African cycle (Wildner et al. 2002). Moreover, the origin 
of the rhyolitic liquids has been modelled to be fractional 
crystallization of plagioclase+alkali feldspar+pyroxene+-
magnetite from trachytic magmas, which, in turn, are pro-
duced by differentiation of mildly alkaline basaltic magmas 
(Sommer et al. 1999, Matté et al. 2012). Shellnutt et al. 
(2009) use the Th/Ta ratio to indicate to which extent the 
interaction crust-mantle was present during the petrogen-
esis of an igneous association of rocks. This ratio should be 
around 2.0 produced exclusively by mantle partial melting, 
while it should be greater than 6.9 to the ones originated 
by crustal partial melting. In our high-Ti group (CT) Th/
Ta &gt; 6.9 predominates, while at our low-Ti group (CP) the 
values range between 6.9 and 4.2, indicating crustal contri-
bution to their origin. According to Eby (1990, 1992), the 
fractionation of “A” type magmas has little effect on the Y/
Nb ratio, which could also be used to indicate the source

of the magmatism. Mantle-derived magmas would have Y/
Nb &amp;lt;1.2, while those of crustal origin should have it &gt; 1.2. 
These geochemical criteria would indicate crustal origin for 
both groups of acid volcanic rocks in this study, in which Y/
Nb ranges from 1.6 to 4.1 (cf. Leitzke et al. 2015).

In both groups, REE are present in moderate to high con-
centrations (?REE = 198–694 ppm). The fractionation between 
light rare-earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements 
(HREE) is low for the low-Ti (CP) group (LaN/YbN = 1.7–6.9) 
and higher for the high-Ti (CT) group (LaN/YbN = 3.48–17.64). 
In general terms, the fractionation of LREE is more pronounced 
than HREE, with LaN/SmN (1.6–5.1) higher than TbN/LuN 
(1.2–1.5). In all samples, there is a strong negative Eu anom-
aly (Eu/Eu* = 0.01–0.19), related to its bivalent character and 
consequently previous fractionation into feldspars. As already 
observed for the AVF at the Ramada Plateau, the high-Ti rhy-
olites are enriched in REE, mainly LREE, when compared to 
the low-Ti group (Fig. 8B). These characteristics were also iden-
tified in other occurrences of the AVF at the SRGS (Sommer 
et al. 2005b, 2006), where low and high-Ti groups of basalts and 
rhyolites were identified. The magmatic source of these groups 
and their petrogenetic correlation are still not well constrained.

When compared to tectonic environment (Fig. 9) trace 
element patterns (cf. Pearce et al. 1984), the samples are 
divided accordingly to their group, with high-Ti rhyolites 
showing a post-collisional settings pattern, while the low-Ti 
are more likely related to intraplate granites, which is coher-
ent with the increase of peralkalinity. In the granitoids clas-
sification diagram (Whalen et al. 1987), all the samples are 
classified as “A” type granites, which are by definition alka-
line and anorogenic. This classification is confirmed by the 
(104*Ga)/Al &gt; 2.6, Ce+Y+Nb+Zr &gt; 500 ppm and FeOt/
FeOt+MgO &gt; 0.9, as proposed by Nardi and Bitencourt 
(2009) for the post-collisional granitic magmatism at the 
southern portion of Brazil. Nevertheless, when compared 
to other occurrences of the AVF, the rocks from the high-Ti 
group (CT) of the Tupanci area have lower contents of Rb, 
Nb, Y and higher of Zr and Ce when compared to the low-Ti 
group (CP), suggesting a different evolution for this group.

The new ages for the AVF at the Tupanci region, coupled 
with trace element content of the two volcanic sequences 
(Leitzke et al. 2015) are coherent with the tectonic envi-
ronment expected for the different groups, suggesting that 
the high-Ti group was generated in a post-collisional set-
ting, while the low-Ti group was generated in a progressive 
post-collision to intraplate setting. Our new ages for the 
high-Ti group at the Tupanci area agrees well with previous 
studies, while the age obtained to the low-Ti group, although 
with high uncertainty, may be related to different episodes 
of the Acampamento Velho volcanism in its northernmost 
exposure SRGS (cf. Janikian et al. 2012).

Constraints for the magmatic sources of 
the AVF volcanism based on Sm-Nd and 
Pb-Pb isotope systematics

The significance of negative ?Nd and differences in the 
147Sm/144Nd observed in acid lavas can be addressed to 
crust-derived lavas, or to crustal contamination of basaltic 
lavas during differentiation or metasomatic rocks (Almeida 
et al. 2005). According to the isotopic results, the high-Ti 
group would also represent a fraction of these volcanic epi-
sodes that had a greater component of crustal contamina-
tion, since it presents a slightly more negative ?Nd.

TDM model ages (DePaolo 1981, 1988) ranging from 1.83 to 
2.22 Ga for the high-Ti rocks are in agreement with the ones pre-
viously obtained (Chemale Jr. 2000, Almeida et al. 2005, Janikian 
et al. 2012), suggesting a contribution of paleoproterozoic basement 
in the source of these magmas (Fig. 10). Isotopic data obtained 
from rocks of the neoproterozoic plutono-volcanic alkaline asso-
ciation at the Taquarembó Plateau, that also belongs to the AVF 
(Wildner et al. 1999), suggest an EM1-type mantle source (Hart 
1988). Chemale Jr. (2000) reported ?Nd (t = 570 Ma) values 
between -15 and -17 and 87Sr/86Sri ratios close to 0.7045, which 
are similar to the results obtained by Gastal and Lafon (1998) for 
intrusive rocks of alkaline associations in the SRGS, correlated to 
the Taquarembó Plateau magmatism. When coupled with major 
and trace elements geochemistry, our data suggest that the source 
of the Tupanci magmatism may also be a lithospheric mantle pre-
viously affected by subduction metasomatic processes. The eNd 
versus time diagram (Fig. 10) compares the Nd isotopic evolution 
of the investigated rocks with distinct crusts (Rio Vacacaí Terrane, 
Santa Maria Chico Complex and Dom Feliciano Belt) from the 
SRGS (cf. Janikian et al. 2012). In this context, it is clearly seen 
that studied samples of the AVF show paleoproterozoic TDM 
ages from Rhyacian to Statherian and plot in an intermediate 
position between the neoproterozoic (Rio Vacacaí Terrane) and 
the paleoproterozoic crusts (Dom Feliciano, Pinheiro Machado 
Suite and Encantada Gneisses). 

The Pb isotope data (Fig. 11) of the studied samples suggest 
a significant crustal contribution with lower paleoproterozoic

crust melting related to the Dom Feliciano Complex. The high 
147Sm/144Nd ratios of the low-Ti rocks coupled to the REE-
chondrite normalized pattern observed is a feature produced 
in ultra-evolved silicic magmas attributed to magmatic frac-
tionation, which may lead to an erroneous estimate of the 
Nd model age of the low-Ti rocks. Another possible expla-
nation for the high 147Sm/144Nd in the low-Ti group could 
be related to a local source control, mineral sorting, with 
fractionation of minerals such as monazite, or hydrothermal 
alteration (Verma et al. 2005). Nevertheless, the similarity 
between ?Nd(t) for both rhyolite groups suggest a similar 
source, which may be a paleoproterozoic crust, as evidenced 
by the 143Nd/144Nd vs. time diagram.

CONCLUSIONS

New U-Pb ages obtained in zircon grains from high-Ti 
rhyolites from the AVF at the NW portion of the SRGS 
indicate an event at 579.1 +/- 5.6 Ma and are in good agree-
ment with reported ages for the time span of the AVF vol-
canism in the Bom Jardim Group of the CB (cf. Chemale 
Jr. 2000, Janikian et al. 2005, 2008, Gastal &amp;amp; Lafon 2001). 
A second U-Pb age of 558 Ma was obtained for rhyolites 
from the low-Ti group at the Picados Hill, although with a 
high uncertainty associated (+/- 39 Ma) probably due to the 
high degree of alteration of the zircon grains. Nevertheless, 

more precise geochronological data reported recently in the 
literature may be used to indicate a younger acid volcanism, 
or a greater time span for the AVF volcanism in southernmost 
Brazil (Janikian et al. 2012, Matté et al. 2016), although the 
high uncertainty obtained in this study does not allow this 
issue to be conclusive. Regarding magmatic sources, Sm/Nd 
isotopic data coupled to Pb isotopes and trace element geo-
chemistry of these rocks indicate variable amounts of paleop-
roterozoic lower crust melting, in a progressive post-collisional 
do intraplate environment. The high values for 147Sm/144Nd 
ratios of rocks from the low-Ti group are probably related to 
the fractionation of minerals or hydrothermal alteration of 
the samples. Our new data allows to better understand the 
stratigraphic evolution of the neoproterozoic post-collisional 
volcanic successions of the CB in the SRGS and the evolution 
of magmatic cycles during the late stages of the Brasiliano–
Pan-African orogeny in southern Brazil.
