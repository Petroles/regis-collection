RESUMO 

 
Sendo o resultado da combinação de dois ou mais materiais, os materiais 

compósitos possuem características únicas e são usados em sistemas de 

engenharia que necessitam alto desempenho e propriedades altamente 

específicas, como, por exemplo em aeronaves e equipamentos 

esportivos. Materiais compósitos podem ser produzidos pela "tecnologia 

do pó", na qual basicamente o pó metálico e/ou cerâmico é compactado 

e, por fim, sinterizado. A sinterização é um processo de densificação, 

onde ocorre a consolidação do material e é a etapa responsável por 

conferir força e resistência à peça. Assim, nota-se que o controle dessa 

etapa é determinante para se atingir as propriedades desejadas à peça 

final. Em paralelo, simulações numéricas do processo de sinterização 

são uma alternativa em relação a custosos e longos experimentos físicos. 

Uma metodologia de simulação numérica muito promissora é chamada 

de Método dos Elementos Discretos (DEM – Discrete Element Method). 

Diferentemente dos métodos contínuos de simulação, o DEM considera 

cada partícula do sistema como um elemento distinto e é ideal para a 

simulação de meios granulares, como é o caso da sinterização. Assim, 

esse projeto tem por objetivo simular e analisar o processo de 

sinterização em estado sólido de materiais compósitos utilizando o 

Método dos Elementos Discretos. O software utilizado foi o MUSEN, 

desenvolvido na Universidade Tecnológica de Hamburgo (TUHH - 

Alemanha). Os materiais do compósito utilizado nas simulação são 

níquel (metal) e alumina (cerâmico). Especificamente, esse trabalho visa 

investigar a influência de diferentes proporções de metal/cerâmico em 

amostras monomodais (apenas um tamanho de partícula) durante a 

sinterização. Além disso, a influência de partículas maiores de metal em 

amostras bimodais também foi analisada. Entre as análises conduzidas, 

foi avaliado o crescimento do raio de contato das partículas entre os 

diferentes tipos de contatos: metal-metal, cerâmico-cerâmico e metal-

cerâmico. O número de coordenação das partículas com esses 3 tipos de 

contato também foi investigado. Finalmente, a influência de diferentes 

parâmetros no comportamento de densificação foi analisada e 

correlacionada com o crescimento de raio de contato e número de 

coordenação entre as partículas. A partir dos resultados, foi possível 

confirmar que a modelagem modificada foi capaz de simular a 

sinterização de compósitos, mesmo para estruturas interpenetrantes. Os 

resultados das amostras monomodais foram divididos em três diferentes 

comportamentos de sinterização: controladas pelo metal, controladas 



 

pelo cerâmico e estruturas interpenetrantes. As amostras controladas 

pelo metal apresentaram as maiores taxas de densificação e atingiram as 

maiores densidades relativas ao final da simulação. As partículas de 

metal (neste caso níquel) possuem um potencial maior para sinterizar 

mais rápido que a alumina devido ao seus parâmetros cinéticos e energia 

superficial. Também foi observado que a adição de uma segunda fase 

com uma menor atividade de sinterização (alumina) reduz a densificação 

global em comparação com o puro metal e leva mais tempo para atingir 

a mesma densidade relativa. As estruturas interpenetrantes apresentaram 

as menores densificações globais dentre todas amostras devido à 

densificação independente da fase metálica e cerâmica. Esse 

comportamento conduziu à formação de muitas fissuras e rachaduras ao 

longo da amostra e a estrutura inicial foi perdida, formando na verdade 

uma estrutura porosa. Os resultados das amostras bimodais mostraram 

um crescimento mais lento do raio de contato para partículas maiores de 

níquel, como é esperado. Entretanto, a densificação global foi maior 

para amostras com maiores partículas de níquel. Esse comportamento 

não era esperado, porém pode ser explicado pela configuração das 

partículas em estruturas interpenetrantes. Nessas estruturas, não existe 

uma fase “matriz”, a fase metálica e cerâmica formam redes contínuas 

de partículas, chamados de caminhos de percolação. Quando partículas 

menores estão presentes nessas estruturas, elas apresentam maior força 

de sinterização, rapidamente se atraem, formam longos aglomerados de 

partículas e a densificação global praticamente não ocorre. Por outro 

lado, partículas maiores induzem menores forças de sinterização. Assim, 

as forças viscosas entre contatos alumina-níquel são suficientes para 

manter esses contatos unidos e, consequentemente, a densificação global 

pode ser observada.

ABSTRACT 

 

Composite is a class of material made by the combination of two or 

more materials, which produces a third one with unique characteristics. 

For this reason, composites have a wide range of engineering 

applications, such as spacecrafts and sports’ equipment. Composite 

materials can be suitably produced by Powder Metallurgy. In this 
manufacturing process, the blend of different powders is shaped and 

later sintered at high temperatures for consolidation of the part. Thereby, 

sintering is considered a densification process, which is responsible for 

providing strength and stiffness to the material or composite. Moreover, 

its control is essential to reach the desired properties of the final part. In 

addition, numerical simulations of the sintering process represent an 

alternative procedure in relation to the lengthy and costly physical 

experiments. A well-known simulation technique is the Discrete 

Element Method (DEM). In contrast to continuum methods, DEM 

considers every particle of the system as a single element and it is 

recommended to simulate granular media, such as sintering. Thus, the 

general purpose of this project is to simulate and analyze the solid-state 

sintering process of composite materials when both materials are 

sintering using DEM. The software used is the MUSEN system, 

developed at TUHH – Germany. The materials chosen for the composite 

are nickel (metal) and alumina (ceramic). Specifically, the present work 

aims to investigate the influence of varying contents of metal/ceramic in 

monosized samples during sintering. These contents range from metal 

volume fraction of 0.9 to 0.1, and include pure metal and ceramic 

bodies. Furthermore, the effect of larger metallic particles in the sample 

is also investigated for a constant metal volume fraction of 0.6. Among 

the analyses carried out, the contact size growth was evaluated 

considering the interfaces metal-metal, ceramic-ceramic and metal-

ceramic. The coordination number of the particles within these three 

contacts is also analyzed. Finally, the influence of the varied parameters 

on the densification behavior is investigated and correlated with the 

contact size growth and coordination number evolution. The results have 

shown that the special modeling was capable to simulate sintering of 

composites even in case of interpenetrating structures. The simulation 

results of the monosized packing can be divided in three different 

sintering behaviors: metal-controlled, ceramic-controlled and 

interpenetrating structures. The metal-controlled samples have shown 

the highest densification rates and relative density evolution, as one 



 

might expect. The nickel particles have higher potential to sinter faster 

than alumina due to their kinetic parameters and surface energy. Hence, 

metal particles induce high forces to shrink the system and indirectly 

transfer forces to the sintering of ceramic phase. Interpenetrating 

structures have shown the lowest overall densification due to 

independent densification of metal and ceramic phase. It has led to large 

cracks through the samples and the initial structure has been lost. The 

results of bimodal packings have shown a slower growing of the contact 

radius for larger nickel particles, as expected. However, the global 

densification has been higher for samples with larger nickel particles. 

This unexpected behavior can be explained due to the particle 

configuration and distribution of forces in the interpenetrating structures. 

Smaller particles induce higher forces, quickly agglomerate themselves 

and are not capable to drive a global densification. On the other hand, 

larger particles induce weaker sintering forces. Thereby, the resistance 

force between nickel-alumina contacts is high enough to keep these 

contacts attached and, consequently, a global densification can be 

observed.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The current need for highly efficient materials with very 

specific properties to be used in engineering systems has stimulated the 

development of new composites. This class of materials is made by the 

combination of two or more materials, which produces a third one with 

unique characteristics if compared to the materials separately. For this 

reason, composites have a wide range of engineering applications, such 

as spacecrafts, airplanes, automobiles, boats, sports’ equipment, bridges, 

buildings and others [1].  

Composite materials, mainly particulate composites, can be 

suitably produced by Powder Metallurgy. In this manufacturing process, 
the blend of different powders is shaped and later sintered at high 

temperatures for consolidation of the part. During sintering, the particles 

of the powder create solid bonds between each other in order to reduce 

the total surface energy of the system so that the porosity of the body is 

decreased during the process. Hence, sintering is considered a 

densification process, which is responsible for providing strength and 

stiffness to the material or composite. Moreover, its control is essential 

to reach the desired properties of the final part [2]. 

In addition, numerical simulations of the sintering process 

represent an alternative procedure in relation to the lengthy and costly 

physical experiments, so that time and costs may be reduced. Moreover, 

if the simulations are well dimensioned, not only the scientific aspects of 

the physical phenomena are addressed, but also industrial aspects may 

be incorporated into the models in order to make process more efficient 

in terms of energy and costs. Thus, the main goal of simulation 

developments in powder metallurgy is to describe analytically the 

complete process chain from the powder filling into the die to the final 

in-service behavior, in order to optimize material and process properties 

further [3].  

A well-known simulation technique is the Discrete Element 

Method (DEM). In contrast to continuum methods, DEM considers 

every particle of the system as a single element, which interacts by 

modeling of forces. Continuum methods are based on phenomenological 

models that rely on empirical assumptions about the macroscopic 
behavior of materials. Thereby, they neglect effects due to the 

microstructure of materials such as heterogeneities and anisotropy. In 

DEM, these microstructural effects are naturally taken into account. 

Particularly for sintering simulation, DEM can also be used to 



30 

 

investigate the contact size between particles, coordination number 

(number of contacting particles), particles rearrangement, particles size 

distribution, cracks formation, among others. Furthermore, macroscopic 

behavior such as densification can be analyzed conveniently.  

DEM has been used to simulate solid-state sintering in three 

dimensionally system in the last ten years, including the works of Martin 

et al. (2006) [4] and Henrich et al. (2007) [3]. Considering DEM 

simulation of powder mixtures, only few references can be found in the 

literature [5,6]. In such works, the authors have considered the ceramic 

phase as hard inclusions, which do not sintering. Therefore, no work 

was reported so far, in which both metallic and ceramic materials are 

sintering. 

In this context, the general purpose of this master thesis is to 

simulate free solid-state sintering process of composite materials when 

both materials are sintering using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The 

material parameters used in the simulations are related to nickel (metal) 

and aluminum oxide (alumina; ceramic). As free solid-state is the 

sintering technique simulated, neither liquid phase nor pressure is 

considered. The sintering temperature used through the simulations is 

below the melting point of both materials, but high enough for both 

ceramic and metal sinter.  

Specifically, the present work aims to investigate the influence 

of varying contents of metal/ceramic in monosized samples during 

sintering. These contents range from metal volume fraction of 0.9 to 0.1, 

and include pure metal and ceramic bodies. In order to investigate 

whether the lack of periodic boundary conditions affect the simulation 

results, a simulation of samples with higher number of particles is also 

performed.  

Furthermore, the effect of larger metallic particles in the sample 

is also investigated for a constant metal volume fraction of 0.6. Among 

the analyses carried out, the contact size growth was evaluated 

considering the interfaces metal-metal, ceramic-ceramic and metal-

ceramic. The coordination number of the particles within these three 

contacts is also analyzed. Finally, the influence of the varied parameters 

on the densification behavior is investigated and correlated with the 

contact size growth and coordination number evolution.

2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
 

This chapter is divided into four topics. First of all, composite 

materials are described and their classification is presented. Secondly, 

the theory of sintering and the main features of powder metallurgy are 

described. The phenomena that take place during sintering as well as the 

parameters which influence the sintering behavior are discussed. In third 

place, the discrete element method is introduced and some important 

works in the literature are presented. Finally, the mathematical model 

that described the sintering phenomenon is presented. 

 

2.1 COMPOSITE MATERIALS 
 

Composites are a class of materials formed by the combination 

of two or more different materials that are mechanically or 

metallurgically bonded together. The material components in 

composites can be metals (titanium, nickel, etc.), ceramics (aluminum 

oxide, tungsten carbide, etc.) and organics (epoxy, PMMA, etc.). The 

key advantage of composites is that they usually exhibit the best 

qualities of their components or constituents and often some properties 

that neither component possesses. Such properties depend on the 

application that the composite is designed for and they may be a 

combination of stiffness, weight, strength, high-temperature 

performance, corrosion resistance, hardness, conductivity, among others. 

Hence, composite materials can reach a performance required by both 

engineering advanced systems and domestic applications where very 

specific properties are needed [1].  

The origin of the distinct discipline of composite materials is 

reported since the beginning of the 1960s. However, the use of 

composite materials is much older. For example, medieval swords and 

armor were constructed with layers of different metals. In the latest 50 

years, the demand for materials with specific properties and high-

performance system has increased substantially in several fields as 

aerospace, energy and civil construction. Airplanes represent a typical 

application, where one material must exhibit light weight, high strength, 

stiffness and fatigue resistance [1]. 

 

 

 



32 

 

A common classification of composite materials is related to 

their structural constituents as: 

? laminar or layered composites; 

? fiber-reinforced composites; 

? particulate composites. 
 

Laminar composites consist of layers of at least two different 

materials that are bonded together. They are used to provide properties 

such as reduced cost, enhanced corrosion resistance or wear resistance, 

electrical insulation or conductivity, unique expansion characteristics, 

lighter weight, improved strength or altered appearance. Safety glass is 

an example of this category in which a layer of polymeric adhesive is 

placed between two pieces of glass and serves to retain the fragments 

when the glass is broken [7].  

Fiber-reinforced composites comprise continuous or discontinuous 

thin fibers that are embedded in a matrix of another material. The matrix 

supports and transmits forces to the fibers, protects them from the 

environment and provides ductility and toughness, while the fibers carry 

most of the load and impart enhanced stiffness. Glass-fiber-reinforced 

resins represent an important example of fibrous composites. With them 

it is possible to produce lightweight materials with high strength and 

high stiffness. In such a case, glass fibers about 10 µm in diameter are 

bonded in a variety of polymers, generally epoxy or polyester resins. 

Current uses of glass-fiber-reinforced plastics include sporting goods 

(snowboards), boat hulls and bathtubs [7].  

Particulate composites are made of discrete particles of one 

material surrounded by a matrix of another material. The particles can 

be either metallic or nonmetallic, as well as the matrix. Concrete is a 

classic example, consisting of sand and gravel particles surrounded by 

hydrated cement, where the particles are rather coarse. Another example 

are gridding and cutting wheels, which are often formed by bonding 

abrasives, such as aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, cubic boron carbide, 

or diamond, in a matrix of glass or polymeric material. The purpose of 

particulate composites can be also to increase the toughness, by addition 

of cemented carbide in a metal matrix of cobalt. Combining tungsten 

powder and powdered silver or copper produces high conductivity and 

resistance to wear [7].  

Even though the most common kind of particulate composites 

consist of particle-matrix composites, there is another sort of structure 

for particulate composites. When the volume fraction of the particulate 



33 

 

 

phase exceeds a certain amount, the particles start to form a continuous 

network of particles. This kind of structure is called percolation 
network. The volume fraction limit depends on the particle size 

distribution width. For a wide particle size distribution, the limit value is 

about 10% of the volume fraction, whereas for monosized particles its 

value is about 30% [5]. In such a case, the particle and matrix phase 

cannot be distinguished from each other, and this definition is not valid 

anymore. Therefore, this sort of system is called interpenetrating 

structures, where both phases form continuous network in different 

directions through the sample and distinct properties may be developed 

due to this new sort of structure.  

Composite materials, particularly particulate composites, may 

be conveniently produced by powder metallurgical techniques. In this 

case, the main advantage is that metal and ceramic powder can be mixed 

homogeneously and in varying amounts in order to obtain different 

structures and properties. Moreover, the technique versatility allows 

producing parts with a wide variety of shapes and sizes [7].  

 

2.2 POWDER METALLURGY 
 

Powder metallurgy is a process in which fine powdered 

materials are blended and pressed into a desired shape (compacted). The 

compacted part is called green body. Then, the green body is heated 
(sintered) to establish desired properties. This process has expanded 

rapidly due to the recognition of the distinct advantages in terms of 

materials utilization, ease of components manufacturing, cost/energy 

saving and other factors. Through the manufacturing process, sintering 

is an essential step, where the compacted material is heated in a 

controlled atmosphere and temperature to obtain the required density 

and strength [7]. Figure 2.1 shows a general processing pattern to 

produce sintered parts [8]. Every step through the process has great 

influence on the sintering behavior and consequently in the shape and 

properties of the end product.  

The technique used to produce the powder (chemical reduction, 

electrolytic deposition, precipitation from solution, etc.) has influence on 

the size, size distribution, shape and agglomeration of the particles. For 
instance, smaller particles present higher surface energy and would 

increase the sintering rate [9].  

  



34 

 

Figure 2.1: General fabrication pattern of sintered parts [8]. 

 
 

Additives used during powder preparation can change the 

shaping and/or sintering behavior, such as lubricants that reduce the 

friction between particles and improve their rearrangement during 

compaction [9].  

Die compaction, isostatic pressing and slip casting represent 

some possible techniques to be used in the shaping or forming step. 

Depending on the compaction technique employed, varying initial 

densities (so-called green density; initial density of the sample that will 
be sintered) may be obtained. The green density of a compact has direct 

influence on the densification behavior and hence on the strength of the 

product [9].  

Although such steps before sintering are very important for the 

overall process, they are out of scope of this work and are not discussed 

in details. For instance, Richerson’s book [9] explores the topic deeply. 

 

2.3 FUNDAMENTALS OF SINTERING 
 

Sintering is a processing technique used to manufacture density-

controlled materials and components from metal or/and ceramic 

powders by applying thermal energy. Sintering belongs to powder 

manufacturing technology and represents a crucial step for reaching the 

desired mechanical and other properties. Their application fields range 

from firing ceramic pots to fabrication of complex, high-performance 

shapes, such as medical implants and gas turbines [10]. 

In fact, sintering is one of the oldest human technologies, 

originating in the prehistoric era with firing of pottery to add strength. 

Ancient Incas used this technique to produce jewelry and other artifacts 

from precious metal powder. Many other sintered ceramic structures can 

be found around the world in ancient civilizations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, 

etc), such as bricks, porcelains, vessels, etc. [11].  

The process has been used through the centuries for several 

purposes, but scientific understanding and controlled experiments have 

only been developed in the 20
th
 century. One of the earliest controlled

experiments was conducted by Muller in 1935. He sintered compacts of 

NaCl powder for a variety of times at several temperatures and 

evaluated the degree of sintering by measuring the strength of fracture 

[9].  

Ever since, remarkable developments have been done. The 

application of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron 

microscopy, and lattice imaging has allowed the investigation of 

microstructure changes at different stages of sintered parts, as well as 

the density and shrinkage evolution may be plotted as function of time 

[9]. Figure 2.2 shows the empirical curve of the bulk density of fused 

silica prepared by solid-state sintering method as function of sintering 

time [12].

as function of sintering time [12]. 

 
 

2.3.1 Sintering Process Overview 
 

According to German [2], “Sintering is a thermal treatment for 

bonding particles into a coherent, predominantly solid structure via 
mass transport events that often occur on the atomic scale. The bonding 

leads to improve strength and lower system energy.” 
During sintering, a consolidation of loose or weakly bonded 

powder (green body) occurs by heating the material in a sintering 

furnace at temperatures below its melting point but high enough to 

permit solid-state diffusion. Typical sintering temperatures, for example, 



36 

 

can range between 750-1000 °C for copper and 1350-1450 °C for 

cemented carbides [7].  

The main driving force for sintering is the reduction of the free 

surface energy of powdered compacts, due to the elimination of internal 

surface area associated with the pores. In the beginning of the process, 

contacting particles start to create connections (necks). As sintering 

proceeds, the high temperatures allow atoms to move and the neck 

grows, forming solid bonds between particles. Figure 2.3 shows a 

scanning electron micrograph of bronze particles after sintering at 800 

°C, where necks between particles can be observed clearly [10].  

 
Figure 2.3: Scanning electron micrograph of the sintering necks formed 

between bronze particles after sintering at 800 °C [10]. 

 
 

Throughout sintering process, the pores reduce in size, whereas 

the density increases and product dimensions change (shrinkage). As a 

result, the sintered part may have its strength, stiffness, ductility, 

toughness, and electrical and thermal conductivities increased if 

compared to the green body [7].  

There are different sintering techniques and the phenomena that 

take place during the process change depending on the technique 

applied. Figure 2.4 shows a general categorization of sintering 

techniques.  

As the first differentiation, sintering can be carried out with or 

without an external pressure (pressure-assisted and pressureless, 

respectively). Most industrial sintering is performed without an external 

pressure. Pressureless sintering is divided into liquid phase sintering or 



37 

 

 

solid-state sintering. Liquid phase sintering occurs when at least one 

material melts during the process and a liquid is present in the system. 

Solid-state sintering occurs when the powder compact is densified 

wholly in a solid state at the sintering temperature. In solid-state, single 

phase is considered when only one material is sintered. Mixed phase 

occurs when a mixture of at least two kinds of powders is sintered to 

form composites and alloys [2].  

 
Figure 2.4: The taxonomy of the sintering technique [2]. 

 
 

The scope of the present work is the mixed phase in solid-state 

sintering (black part in Figure 2.4). Therefore, the following sections 

introduce the concepts and phenomena related to this technique. Liquid 

phase and pressure-assisted sintering are not considered nor their related 

phenomena. 

A wide variety of parameters affects sintering and they may be 

divided into two categories: material and process variables. Table 2.1 

shows the main variables that influence the behavior during sintering 

[8].

The process parameters are mostly thermodynamic variables 

and have great (and complex) influence in the sintering kinetics and the 

final properties of the sintered part. For example, higher temperatures 

induce higher sintering rates and can improve the final properties though 

increase the expense and complicate the process control.  

The variables related to the material are also of fundamental 

importance to the process. For example, smaller particles have higher 

total surface energy and then higher driven force for sintering. Either it 

means that faster sintering (lower sintering time) or lower sintering 

temperatures can be applied. For compacts containing more than two 

kinds of powder, the homogeneity is of prime importance to result in a 

sintered part with homogeneous and isotropic properties [8]. 

 

2.3.2 Thermodynamics of Sintering  
 

From the thermodynamic point of view, sintering is an 

irreversible process in which surface energy of the particles plays the 

fundamental role. Surface energy induces some phenomena and it is 

important to distinguish them [8].  

In order to reduce the total surface energy of the system, the 

main phenomena that take place during sintering are densification and 

grain growth. The total surface energy of a powder compact is expressed 

as ???, where ??  is the specific surface energy and ? the total surface 
area of the compact. The reduction of the total surface energy of the 

system can be expressed as [8]: 

s ?(???) = ???? + ???? (2.1) 

Then, the change in surface energy ??? is due to densification, whereas 
the change in the surface area ?? is due to grain growth. 

On the other hand, for the neck formation and growth (and 

consequently densification and grain growth) a mechanism for matter 

transport must be present. The specific energy and curvature of the 

particle surface provide an effective stress on the atoms under the 

surface. For a curved surface with principal radii of curvature ??  
and ??, this stress ? is proportional to the surface energy ?? and is given 
by Laplace’s equation [10]:  

 

s ? = ??(
?

?? 
+

?

??
) (2.2) 

 



39 

 

 

Because the stress in the neck region is different from the 

neighboring region, atomic motion occurs to remove this gradient. 

Usually, atomic motions take place often via diffusional solid-state 

mechanisms. The high temperatures at which sintering are normally led 

are essential to allow the atoms to move. Such mechanism will be 

discussed in details further on. 

 

2.3.3 Stages of Solid-State Sintering 
 

Solid-state sintering is often divided into three overlapped 

stages: initial, intermediate and final stage. They are related to the 

sequence of physical changes that occur as particles bond together and 

the porosity disappears. Figure 2.5 shows a representation of those 

stages as sintering proceeds [10]. Figure 2.6 shows a typical 

densification curve of sintering versus time [8], which represents the 

three stages and their relative density.

changes in pore structure during sintering [10].

Figure 2.5 a) shows particles as a loose powder with a relative 

density (green density) defined by the compaction technique used [10]. 

Figure 2.5 b) represents the initial stage in which is characterized by the 

rearrangement of particles and the initial neck formation at the point of 

contact between particles. The rearrangement consists of slight 

movements of adjacent particles to increase the number of points of 

contact. This mechanism can partially heal voids and defects present 

along the sintered part. Normally curvature gradients inherent to the 

powder dictate the sintering behavior. As it is observed in Figure 2.6, the 

contribution of this stage on the compact shrinkage is only 2-3% at the 

most within a negligible time if the total sintering time is considered [8].  

In the intermediate stage (Figure 2.5 c), the size of the necks 

grows and the center of the original particles moves closer together. This 

results in shrinkage and the porosity decreases, so that the relative 

density can reach up to ~93%, as shown in Figure 2.6. During the 

second-stage, the pores are tubular and interconnected (open porosity) 

[10].  
 

Figure 2.6: Schematic showing a typical densification curve of a powder 

compact and the three stages of sintering [8]. 

 
 

The final stage of sintering (Figure 2.5 d) corresponds to the 

elimination of the last ~7% of porosity, in which the pores are no longer 

interconnected and become isolated. At this stage, grain growth plays a 

fundamental role in pore removal and porosity reduction. As observed in 

Figure 2.6, this stage is the slowest one and grain growth must be well 

controlled to achieve maximum removal of porosity. For example, if 



41 

 

 

grain growth is too rapid, the grain boundaries can move faster than the 

pores and leave them isolated inside a grain. As the grain continues to 

grow, the pore becomes further separated from the grain boundary and it 

has a lower chance to be eliminated [9].  

 

2.3.4 Kinect Mechanisms of Solid-State Sintering  
 

The reduction of the total surface energy of the system as 

driving force for sintering induces some kinetic mechanisms for matter 

transport. There are two main mechanisms in sintering: surface transport 

and bulk transport [10]. Surface transport, such as surface diffusion, 

vapor transport and lattice diffusion from the particle surface, results in 

neck growth without promoting shrinkage or densification of the system. 

In this case, atoms come to the neck from the particle surface. It means 

the atoms are rearranged along the surface and the interparticle distance 

is not reduced [8]. 

On the other hand, in bulk transport mechanism the mass comes 

from the particle interior to be deposited at the neck, resulting in 

approximating the particles centers. Hence, this class of mechanism is 

responsible, beyond the neck growth, for densification and shrinkage of 

the system. Bulk transport includes grain boundary diffusion, lattice 

diffusion from grain boundary (also called volume diffusion) and 

viscous flow [8]. Table 2.2 lists the major mechanisms for matter 

transport and their related parameters. Figure 2.7 shows a schematic 

representation for two sintering particles including the matter transport 

paths listed in Table 2.2.

Throughout sintering process, the dominant transport 

mechanism acting on the particles depends on temperature, kind of 



42 

 

material and stage of sintering. Relatively to the melting temperature of 

the material, bulk transports are dominant at higher temperatures, 

whereas surface transports are dominant at lower temperatures [10]. 

Amorphous materials, such as glasses and polymers, sinter in a 

distinct way if compared to crystalline materials, since amorphous 

materials lack grain boundaries. These materials sinter by viscous flow 

(path 6 in Figure 2.7) involving the deformation of particles and the path 

along which matter flows is not clearly specified. Viscous flow is driven 

by capillarity. This mechanism is well described by continuum 

conservation laws for momentum and mass. Particles coalesce at a rate 

that depends on the particle size and material viscosity. If the 

temperature increases, the material viscosity decreases and sintering 

occurs more rapidly. Thus, sintering temperature plays a fundamental 

role in sintering of these materials [10]. 

 

Figure 2.7: Schematic representation of the paths of sintering mechanisms 

for a system of two particles [8]. Numbers are related to the mechanisms in 

Table 2.2. 

 
 

Sintering of polycrystalline materials such as metals and 

ceramics cannot be described by viscous flow because extremely high 

stress is needed for matter flows in such structures. The primary 

mechanism for polycrystalline materials is diffusion, which is related to 

the movement of atoms under a difference in vacancy concentration in 

the lattice structure. Usually, more than one kinetic mechanism takes 



43 

 

 

place simultaneously during this process, as described by the paths 1 to 

5 in Figure 2.7.  

Vapor transport, represented by path 3 in Figure 2.7, usually 

occurs in materials with high vapor pressure. A weight loss of the part 

during sintering can indicate that this mechanism is taking place. 

However, for most materials the contribution of this mechanism is small 

and can be neglected [10]. 

Surface diffusion takes place through the defects on the surface 

of crystalline materials, as shown by path 1 in Figure 2.7. This 

mechanism is already active during the heating-up step of sintering 

because its activation energy is less than other mechanisms. Its 

contribution to the initiation of sintering is recognized for almost all 

materials. The influence of surface diffusion decreases as the defects are 

consumed and the available surface area is lost to the neck growth [10]. 

Lattice diffusion (volume diffusion) involves the motion of 

vacancies through the crystalline structure of the solids. Its rate depends 

on the temperature, particle size and composition. There are two ways 

for this kind of mechanism, as pointed by the paths 2 and 5 in Figure 

2.7. When vacancies flow from the neck to the particle surface (path 2) 

lattice diffusion does not contribute to densification. Although treated 

theoretically, there is little evidence for this occurring at significant 

levels. On the other hand, when vacancies come from the neck to the 

grain boundary (path 5), the center-to-center approach of two particles is 

induced and leads to system shrinkage. 

Considering that the volume diffusion is active for most 

materials only at high temperatures (high activation energy), this is not 

the dominant mass transport during sintering, especially for small 

powders [10]. 

Grain boundary diffusion (path 4 in Figure 2.7) is relatively 

important for sintering of most materials. Indeed, it is the leading 

mechanism in many cases. The defective character of the grain boundary 

allows mass flow along the boundary with an activation energy that lays 

usually between surface and volume diffusion. As surface area is 

consumed and surface diffusion declines in importance, the 

simultaneous emergence of new grain boundaries increases the role of 

grain boundary. On the other hand, grain growth reduces the importance 
of grain boundary diffusion [10]. 

Regardless the transport mechanism, once the neck size reaches 

a thermodynamic equilibrium among surface energy, dihedral angle and 



44 

 

grain boundary energy, further neck growth only occurs due to the grain 

growth [10]. 

Therefore, it is clear that mass transport rates, and their 

influence on neck growth and pores and grain size, are a key factor to 

understand the sintering process. Models for solid-state sintering usually 

take into account surface diffusion (prevailing mechanism during initial 

stage) and grain boundary diffusion (dominant for intermediate stage). 

Modeling of the final stage of sintering must consider grain growth to be 

realistic [10]. 

 

2.4 DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD 
 

Several industrial processes as well as many phenomena in 

nature involve particulate media. The discrete character of the medium 

results in a complex behavior due to the dynamic interaction between 

particles and their interaction with surrounding gas or liquid and walls 

[13]. Traditional theoretical and experimental investigations of the 

mechanical behavior of granular materials are restricted by the limited 

quantitative information about what actually happens internally in those 

systems [14]. Alternatively, numerical simulations using particle length 

scale is possibly the most powerful tool to understand and reproduce the 

behavior of such systems. 

Cundall and Strack [13] have developed in 1979 a simulation 

method, originally to study rock mechanics, known as Discrete Element 

Method (DEM). This technique takes into account the granular nature of 

the material by treating every grain as a distinct element (particle). 

Every particle interacts with the neighbors by means of contact and non-

contact (body) forces, and can move translationally and rotationally. 

Newton’s equations of motion describe the particles dynamics. Thereby, 

DEM simulations can provide dynamic information, such as trajectories 

of particles and transient forces acting on individual particles, which is 

extremely difficult to obtain by physical experimentation at this stage of 

development [15].  

In contrast to the continuum methods, the discrete element 

method offers the advantage to have access to coordination number 

(number of contacting particles) and contact area of every grain. 
Continuum methods use phenomenological models that do not take into 

consideration the microstructure of the material [16], such as effects due 

to grain rearrangement, of local heterogeneities and anisotropy. As 

example, Figure 2.8 shows the particle mixing pattern induced by the 



45 

 

 

passage of a single bubble through two initially completely segregated 

layers of particles of different colors. For comparison issues, 

experimental data are presented in Figure 2.8 (a), discrete method in (b), 

and continuum method in (c). Differences in the distribution of density 

can be easily noted. The discrete model shows a good correspondence 

with the experimental observations, whereas the continuum model 

overpredicts the mixing [17]. 

In recent years, DEM has been rapidly extended to study several 

fields of engineering due to multiple efforts in the simulation technique 

and computational technology evolution. Examples of application are 

vibratory sphere packing [18], ball milling [19], sintering process [4], 

and even for fluidization, where DEM may be coupled with 

computational fluid dynamics [17]. A good review of DEM applications 

and findings has been done by Zhu et al. [15]. 

 
Figure 2.8: Mixing patterns of a colored under-layer of particles induced by 

a single bubble: (a) experiment; (b) discrete method; (c) continuum method 

[17]. 

 
 

Application of DEM to simulate sintering in three-dimensional 

systems has become more frequent in the last decade. One of the first 

works, Martin et al. (2006) [4] have simulated the sintering of copper 

powder at varying temperatures and proposed a grain-coarsening 

scheme. Prior to sintering, the samples were compacted isostatically or 

uniaxially in order to analyze whether the compaction technique can 

influence the sintering behavior. They have found that uniaxially 



46 

 

compaction induces anisotropy in the sample during sintering. The 

simulations have shown a good accordance with the experimental data, 

mainly when coarsening scheme has been included. 

Henrich et al. (2007) [3] have simulated free and pre-assisted 

solid-state sintering of powders with special attention to the grain 

rearrangements during sintering. The authors have described in details a 

method for generating a realistic initial configuration of particles. It has 

been found that the densification rate is enhanced by grain 

rearrangements, whereas bulk and shear viscosity are reduced. Grain 

rearrangement has also affected the crack formation. When a coefficient 

of friction has been included (imposing a resistance to the 

rearrangements), cracks have formed along the sample. 

Such findings concerning evolution of cracks have been 

confirmed by Martin et al. (2009) [20]. The authors have investigated 

deeper the evolution of defects (cracks) during sintering in the 

unconstrained and constrained sample, with varying coefficient of 

friction between particles. The authors’ main conclusion has been that it 

is necessary to have some form of constraint to nucleate and/or grow 

cracks. Defects may nucleate and grow from localized heterogeneities 

(at the length of few particles) and the green density can influence in the 

defect growth. 

Wonisch et al. (2007) [21] have used DEM to study the stress-

induced anisotropy through sintering of alumina samples. The authors 

have found that intergranular pores are preferentially orientated along 

the compressive loading axis in accordance with their experimental 

observation and with Martin et al.’s work [4]. 

The effect of particle size distribution on sintering has been 

studied by Wonisch et al. (2009) [22]. The authors have simulated 

samples with normal, lognormal and bi-modal size distribution, in which 

varying width distribution was used. The main finding has been that the 

densification rate declines when the distribution width increases, 

although particle rearrangement is enhanced.  

The effect of a substrate on the sintering of films has been 

studied by Martin and Bordia (2009) [23]. The interaction between 

particles and substrate has been modelled by viscous drag (friction). 

Their work has shown that the substrate can induce heterogeneity and 
anisotropy along the film thickness in which was initially homogeneous 

and isotropic. The degree of anisotropy depends on the value of the 

viscosity at the interface. 

Rasp et al. (2013) [24] has investigated the influence of varying 

initial coordination number but similar green densities on the sintering 



47 

 

 

behavior. Their simulations have shown that the densification is strongly 

retarded in the case of low initial coordination numbers. 

Considering sintering of composites using DEM simulations, 

just few works can be found in literature. In the earliest works aimed in 

this topic, Jagota and Scherer (1993) [25, 26] have studied the sintering 

of monosized composites by varying the fraction of hard spheres and 

assuming that all contacts follow a linear viscous law. These authors 

have concluded that there is an inclusion fraction limit (hard spheres) 

above which the apparent viscosity of the packing increases drastically 

depending on the nature of the contact between inclusions.  

Later on, Olmos et al. (2009) [5] have investigated the sintering 

of mono-sized copper/alumina composites by varying the volume 

fraction of alumina inclusions (between 5% and 30%) and compared 

with experimental data. Sintering has been carried out at temperature of 

1000 °C, which is reasonable to treat alumina particles as hard spheres. 

The experiments have shown that the densification rate decreases as the 

fraction of inclusions increase. For the case of 30% alumina, the sample 

barely has sintered since inclusions can form a continuous network 

(percolation) above this solid volume content, which hinders sintering. 

Overall, the simulations have shown a good agreement with the 

experimental data. 

Yan et al. (2013) [6] have investigated the effect of volume 

fraction, size and homogeneity (agglomerates) on the sintering behavior 

of ceramic/metal composites. Metal particles have been treated as soft 

spheres, and ceramic particles as hard spheres (sintering temperature at 

800 °C). The authors, in accordance with Olmos et al. [5] and Jagota and 

Scherer [26], have found that the densification rate is reduced as the size 

of inclusions decrease. Furthermore, the simulations have shown that the 

densification rate decreases as inclusion size decrease for a given 

volume fraction. The same behavior has found for agglomerate of 

inclusions. The authors claim that agglomerates of fine inclusions may 

be considered as larger particles of agglomerated total size. 

In such works of composites sintering, the authors have used 

models considering one of the materials as rigid inclusions. It means that 

just one material sinters and the other follows, for example, an elastic 

law. However, whether sintering is carried out at a high enough 
temperature, both materials can sinter and be treated as soft spheres.

2.5 MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF DEM 
 

In the DEM scheme, the interactions of spherical particles are 

accounted by modeling the evolution of the packing as a dynamic 

process. The particles are described by their individual vectors: 

position  ??? ?, velocity ???? ? and angular velocity ????? ?, and scalars: mass ??, 
moment of inertia ??, and radius ??. These vectors are shown in Figure 
2.9, which represent two overlapped particles on a vectorial plane. This 

Figure represents the soft sphere approach in which the normal force ???? ? 

and the tangential force ???? ? can be observed. The overlap ? between 

particles and the forces are discussed in the next chapter.  
 

Figure 2.9: Two overlapped particles on a vectorial plane showing their 

vectors.  

 
 

Figure 2.10 shows a flowchart that represents the DEM 

algorithm for the temporal evolution of the particles. As observed, in 

each simulation time step ?t, firstly the number of neighbors in contact 
of every particle is determined (Figure 2.10 a), where the Verlet-

Neighbor List Method [27, 28] may be used. A pair of particles is 
considered in contact if the distance between their centers is less than 

the sum of their radii. An example may be observed in Figure 2.9, where 

| ??? ? ? ??? ?|  &amp;lt; ?? + ??, thus particles are considered in contact.

Then, after the neighborhood calculation, the algorithm goes 

through every particle (Figure 2.10 b). The forces between neighboring 

particles are calculated (c) depending on a given force law (these forces 

are described in the next section). With the total force acting on the 

particle and using the Newton’s second law, it is possible to obtain the 

new velocity and position [3]. The time evolution of the particle 

positions is governed by Newton’s equation of motion, which provides 

the balance of forces and moments, as follows:

2.6 CONTACT MODEL FOR SINTERING 
 

DEM simulations need a mathematical model that describes 

properly the interaction forces between particles. Equation 2.8 shows the 

Newton’s second law and forces that might act on ith particle [30]:

 (2.8) 

The force ???? ?
?
 results from the particle-fluid interaction, such as 

drag force or due to the pressure gradient. In solid-state sintering, this 

sort of force does not exist due to the absence of fluid. The term 

???? ?
?
 represents gravitational forces acting on the particles. Even though 

gravity is present during sintering, most works do not consider its 

contribution [3, 4].  

???? ??
??  results from the non-contact force acting on particle ith by 

the interaction with particle kth, such as the van der Waals or 

electrostatic forces. Van der Waals forces play an important role to keep 

the particles together in the green body, but do not affect the sintering 

behavior.  

???? ??
?  represents contact forces that result when particle ith is 

physically contacting particle kth. Examples of contact forces include 

frictional forces, spring force and air resistance force. In DEM 

modelling, this sort of forces acts on the point of contact between two 

particles. Figure 2.11 shows a representation of two soft particles 

interacting with an overlap ? and such point of contact is shown by the 
dotted line.  

In sintering, as discussed in the previous chapter, the mass 

transfer for neck formation and densification only takes place at the 



51 

 

 

contacts of particles. Hence, a contact model that predicts realistically 

the sintering behavior is necessary.  

 
Figure 2.11: Contact geometry between two overlapped particles. 

 
 

In this work, whose purpose is to simulate sintering of 

composites, a special approach is proposed based on Bouvard and 

McMeeking's model [31] and the observations of Olmos et al. [5]. The 

metal material is nickel (Ni) and the ceramic one is alumina (Al2O3). 

Three types of contacts coexist through the samples and are treated in a 

different way (see Figure 2.12):  

? between metal particles (Ni-Ni); 

? between ceramic particles (Al2O3-Al2O3); 

? between metal and ceramic particle (Ni-Al2O3). 
 

Figure 2.12: Contact geometry between two overlapped particles. 

 

 
 

The three contacts have two different behaviors. Briefly, the Ni-

Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts are the sintering ones (Figure 2.12 a) and 

c)), described by a sintering-viscous model. The Ni-Al2O3 is a non-

sintering contact (Figure 2.12 b) and follows a viscous model (described 

in details as follows).

52 

 

The contact model for sintering is based on Bouvard and 

McMeeking's model [31], which considers grain boundary and surface 

diffusion as the main mechanisms of mass transport. As the simulations 

are carried out with a constant temperature  ?, the diffusion coefficient 
for vacancy transport in the grain-boundary with thickness ?? is 
described by Equation 2.9. ?? is the activation energy, ?? the ideal gas 

constant and ??? pre-exponential factor. Diffusion coefficient is used to 
calculate the diffusion parameter (Equation 2.10), where ? is the atomic 
volume and ? the Boltzmann constant. 

 

s ?? = ?????? (
???
???

) (2.9) 

s ??=  
? 

??
 ???? (2.10) 

 

As the simulations are carried out at 1220 °C, metal-metal and 

ceramic-ceramic contacts are sintering. For such a case, given a system 

of two particles of identical radius ?, and an overlap ?, the normal force 

 ???? ? (see Figure 2.9) acting at the contact is described by:  
 

s ???? ? =  
???

?

????,?
 ???? ???,? ? ? ?

?

?
????,? (2.11) 

 

where ??,? is the surface energy and ??,? diffusion parameter of the 
material, depending on which kind of contact is taking place. Contact 

radius ?? can be observed in Figure 2.11.  
The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 2.11 may be 

considered as a normal resistance that opposes the movement. Its value 

can be either compressive or tensile, depending on the particle-particle 

relative velocity in the normal direction  ???? ???,?. The second term relates 
to a sintering tensile force due to the surface energy ??. The vector ? ? is 
the unit vector in the normal direction to the contact area between two 

particles. This vector is necessary to convert the sintering term from a 

scalar into a vector. Note that the viscous term depends on the size of the 

contact radius  ?? to the power of four, thus leading to very large 
resistance for large overlaps [20].  

The parameters ? and ? depend on the ratio of the grain-
boundary ???? diffusion to the surface diffusion ???? [23], in the 
following relation: 



53 

 

 

 

s ? =
????
????

 (2.12) 

 

where for a pair of particles ? = ? may be used for all values of  ?. The 
parameter ? = ?/? is used for ? = ?, ? = ? for ? = ?. ?, and ? =
?/? for ? = ?. ??. In other words, it is possible to choose which 
mechanism would be the dominant throughout the simulation only 

changing the parameter ?. As grain boundary diffusion is the most 
important mechanism to promote densification during sintering (see 

Section 2.3.4), it was chosen ? = ? (grain boundary twice more influent 
then surface diffusion). Then, in the present work the used parameters 

are ? = ?/? and ? = ?. 

The tangential contact force ???? ? represents a viscous resistance 
against sliding and opposes the particle-particle relative velocity in the 

tangential direction  ???? ???,?, is given by [32, 33]:  
 

s ???? ? = ??????  
???

???

????,?
 ???? ???,? (2.13) 

 

where ????? is a viscous parameter with no dimension. This coefficient 

can be considered as a friction parameter for the sliding of particles, 

where surface rugosity and shape of the particles may affect its value. 

Even though its value is difficult to quantify experimentally, it has been 

shown to be of primary importance for the macro defect initiation [20]. 

Martin and Bordia [23] suggest that the value of the viscosity ????? 
should be&amp;lt;1, because the normal viscosity term in Equation 2.11 should 

be of the same order or larger than the tangential viscosity term 

(Equation 2.13) when the normal and tangential relative velocities are of 

the same order. Martin et al. [20] have investigated different values of 

the viscosity parameter. They have found that for ????? &gt; ?. ??, the 

rearrangements of particles are very restrict and crack formation can 

occur along the sample even without preexisting defects. For  ????? =

?. ??, sintering has taken place with heterogeneous densification and 
without formation of large cracks. This value, as an intermediary value 
of viscosity, is used in this work. 

The contact radius ?? is calculated by Coble's model [34]: 

s ??
? = ??? (2.14) 



54 

 

which is dependent of the overlap ? between the particles. It is 
important to point out that Coble’s model considers the mass transfer to 

the growing of the neck when two particles are approaching and 

overlapping each other. In other words, the contact radius  ?? calculated 
takes into account the conservation of mass, as represented in Figure 

2.11. 

For the contact between metal-ceramic (Ni-Al2O3), it is 

considered that no sintering takes place. The normal force for them has 

been adapted by the observations of Olmos et al. [5]. The authors have 

studied experimentally the sintering with a mixture of copper and 

alumina. One of their results is that during sintering, at temperatures 

typical for the metal phase but not sufficient for alumina, the metal 

particles exhibit viscous deformation in the contact region to an alumina 

particle. The shape of the contact region is, thereby, comparable to a 

sintering neck. To consider this viscous effect at the Ni-Al2O3 contacts, 

the normal force is given solely by the viscous term in Equation 2.11, 

resulting in: 

 

s ???? ? =  
???

?

????,?
 ???? ???,? (2.15) 

 

where ??,?  is calculated from the mean value between ceramic and 
metal diffusion parameters.  

Friction is also considered in metal-ceramic contacts and is 

calculated by the tangential force in Equation 2.13, where  ????? = ?. ?? 

as well. 

In order to study the effect of varying size of particles in the 

packing, samples with bimodal packings were generated and an 

equivalent radius  ?? is defined between two particles of radius ?? 
and ?? [23]: 

 

s ?
? =

?????
(??+??)

 (2.16) 

 

where ? in Equation 2.11 and 2.13 can be replaced by ??. Many authors 
[20, 22] have used this generalization, which has its origin in elasticity 

and plasticity theory. Moreover, this is in good quantitative agreement 

with numerical simulations carried out by Pan et al.[35] and Parhami et 

al. [36] on sintering behavior of two-spheres systems with size ratio of 

up to four.

3 SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS 
 

As first part of this project, this chapter presents the adjustments 

and developments done on the software MUSEN [37] in order to enable 

it to simulate sintering. The topics include a short description of the 

software MUSEN, the main assumptions for sintering, the validation of 

the sintering behavior with a system of two particles and a method 

proposed to calculate the density evolution.  

 

3.1 SOFTWARE MUSEN 
 

Software MUSEN, developed by Dosta [37, 38], is a Graphical 

User Interface (GUI) with implemented DEM equations, which can be 

used to simulate the sintering process with some adjustments. 

The MUSEN system has an algorithm that generates packing of 

particles with random distribution. The algorithm produces packings 

inside the simulation box, which is defined as a three dimensional space 

with a specified geometry (cubic, spherical or cylindrical) where 

periodic boundary conditions could be implemented to act on their 

borders. The algorithm to fill the simulation box is a dynamic method 

and works basically in three steps. Firstly, the number of particles is 

calculated from the porosity required and the simulation box’s volume. 

Secondly, this amount of particles is filled into the box occupying 

random sites and a small overlap is allowed between particles. Thirdly, 

the particles are displaced on a dynamic way, in order to attain a better 

arrangement of the particles and reduce the overlap between them. Then, 

it is possible to manipulate the packing, for example to delete particles 

or change their positions.  

A mathematical model for diverse purposes can be implemented 

in the language C++ and loaded into the software. Different material 

properties may be loaded and used for simulations. As output data, the 

software provides a txt file with the particle’s vectors position, velocity 

and force for each saved time step. On the graphical interface, the 

behavior of the sample throughout the time can be observed in such a 

way that it allows observing crack formation, rearrangement of particles 

and densification.  

The features previously described are just some of the available 

tools in the software. Moreover, new developments and adjustments can 

be done in order to improve the software capabilities. To enable the 

sintering simulation, the main adjustments developed for this project 



56 

 

have been the calculation of the coordination number (CN) (number of 

neighboring particle in contact with each particle), the average contact 

radius (ACR) evolution and the density evolution. For this purpose, it 

has been developed an algorithm in Matlab® which reads the output txt 

file with the particle vectors along the simulation provided by the 

software and calculates the CN and the ACR evolution throughout the 

simulation. In addition, the particles can be colored by the coordination 

number on the graphical interface. For the densification calculation, a 

new method has been developed and implemented into the software, as 

described in details in the next section. 

Figure 3.1 shows a chart resuming the input and output data 

(mostly related to the sintering parameters) of software MUSEN. The 

DEM algorithm (gray part) refers to the algorithm described in Section 

2.5 (Figure 2.9). Figure 3.2 shows a screenshot of MUSEN’s interface 

with a packing of copper particles. As is observed in this figure, the 

software allows coloring particles by different characteristics, such as 

velocities, angular velocity, diameter, material and coordination number.

3.2 ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE SINTERING SIMULATION  
 

The first part of this project consisted to define the basic 

assumptions to simulate the sintering process. As any simulation work, 

it is important that the assumptions simplify the problem but, at the same 

time, do not affect the physical reality of the process. 

For sintering, a usual assumption mentioned in many works [4, 

5] is to neglect the rotational motions of the particles. Martin et al. [39] 

have stated that the rotational motions can be neglected for packings 

with particle coordination number between 6 and 10. Such a value of 

CN is found in the sintering packings since its relative density is about 

64%. Thus, the torque and angular velocity calculation (Equations 2.4 

and 2.7) are deactivated in the software MUSEN during sintering 

simulation.  

Software MUSEN allows generating packings with typical 

relative density of green body from 55% to 64%. Hence, it is not 

necessary to compact the sample and the sintering simulation can be 

carried out as soon as the packing is generated. Furthermore, the 

simulations have been performed at sintering constant temperature of 

1220 °C. 

Grain growth is not considered in this work because the model 

used (see Section 2.6) does not predict such behavior. For this reason, 

the authors of most works [22, 23] have stopped their simulations at 



58 

 

relative density of 0.90; for that grain growth has a limited influence on 

the process. In addition, a basic assumption of DEM simulations is that 

two neighboring contacts of one particle must not interact. Figure 3.3 

represents such situation, where particles A and C start to interact after 

some simulation time due to the large overlaps developed with particle 

B. In other words, when the overlap between two particles attains a 

certain maximum value, the simulation is not valid anymore. This 

maximum value of overlap also corresponds at relative density about 

0.90. Those authors have used such limiting relative density because 

they have simulated only one material with one densification kinetics. It 

means that all overlaps (and the contact radius) between particles follow 

the same kinetic.  

 
Figure 3.3: Representation of two neighboring particles interacting.  

                               
 

However, for this work in which two materials with two 

different kinetics are used, the limitation must be related to the contact 

radius evolution between these two phases (nickel-nickel contact and 

alumina-alumina contact) instead to the relative density. In order to find 

out at which average contact radius the simulations should be stopped, a 

calibration has been done relating the normalized average contact radius 

to the relative density evolution as shown in Figure 3.4.  

The contact radius has been normalized by the particle radius to 

be independent of the particle size. As observed, the normalized average 

contact radius that corresponds to relative density of 0.90 is equal to 

0.65. Therefore, the limiting normalized contact radius is 0.65 and the 

simulation must be stopped at this point. It is important to point out that 

this evolution is neither dependent on the material nor on the number of 

particles in the simulation box. It is essentially a geometric evolution 

and then can be used for both alumina-alumina and nickel-nickel 

contacts.

3.3 NUMERICAL EXAMPLE WITH A TWO-PARTICLE 
SYSTEM 

 

In order to investigate the correct behavior of the calculations 

provided by the software MUSEN according to the used contact model, 

Figure 3.5 shows a numerical example with two particles of radius 0.05 

µm before simulation (a) and after 60 seconds of simulation (b) at 
temperature of 1200 °C. For such example, typical alumina parameters 

[20] have been used and the time step equal to 10
-4

 s. Table 3.1 shows 

all simulation parameters for this example. It should be pointed out that 

the contact diameter shown in Figure 3.5 (b) (white arrow) is not the 

contact diameter used for the calculations. Instead of that, it is used the 

contact diameter given by Equation 2.14 (contact radius), which 

considers the conservation of mass during the process.

As simulation proceeds (Figure 3.5), some parameters of the 

two particles change (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). Figure 3.6 (a) shows the 

forces evolution, and Figure 3.6 (b) shows the evolution of the relative 

velocity in normal direction. As expected from Equation 2.11, in Figure 

3.6 (a) the sintering force presents a constant value through the entire 

simulation, whereas the viscous force presents a more complex 

behavior. As discussed previously, this latter force is dependent on the 

relative velocity in the normal direction   ????,? and, since the particles 
are initially stopped, it starts from zero. The curve of velocity in Figure 

3.6 (b) presents a similar behavior of the viscous force in (a).

after 60 s of simulation (b). 

 

Simulation time

61 

 

 

To explain such behavior, it is necessary to analyze Equation 

2.11. In the first time step, since viscous force is zero, the only force 

acting on the particles is the tensile sintering force. Hence, there is a 

large total force attracting the particle, leading the development of high 

velocities for the next time step. Then, such high velocities results in a 

great increase of the viscous force. On the other hand, the viscous force 

developed will offer a resistance to the motion of the particles, which 

ends up decreasing the velocities. In other words, the viscous force 

induces influences and simultaneously it is influenced by the particle 

velocities. This explanation may be supported by observing Figure 3.6 

(b), where the relative velocity attains a maximum velocity at the same 

time when the viscous force is maximum in (a). Moreover, it is observed 

that the velocity does reach neither a constant value nor zero. For this 

reason, it can be considered that the particles attain a ‘virtual’ 

equilibrium. 

Figure 3.7 (a) shows the displacement of the particles as 

simulation goes on and (b) shows the evolution of the contact radius 

between the particles. A great part of the total displacement occurs in the 

beginning of the simulation, when the particles velocity is higher as it 

was in Figure 3.6 (b).  

In Figure 3.7 (b), contact radius rises nearly similar to the 

displacement and it is in accordance with Coble’s model in Equation 

2.14. 

 
Figure 3.6: The evolution of sintering and viscous force (a) and relative 

velocity in the normal direction (b) of the pair of particles as simulation 

proceeds. 

 
 

These results in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 are quite similar to those 

obtained by Nosewicz et al. [16], where the graphs of force, velocity and 

displacement have shown basically the same trend. Since the authors 



62 

 

have used the same contact model, it is a proof that the implementation 

of the contact model in the system has been done successfully.

the pair of particles as simulation proceeds.  

 
 

3.4 DENSIFICATION CALCULATION THROUGHOUT THE 
SIMULATION 

 

Sintering process is also known as a densification process. 

Thus, it is extremely important to know how the evolution of the relative 

density occurs as simulation proceeds. For this reason, a method has 

been developed to calculate the densification curve throughout the 

simulation. 

Density ? is defined by  
?

?
, where ? is mass and ? is volume. 

For a particulate system, the relative density ?? of a specific volume ?? 
may be calculated by the following equation: 

 

s ?? = ??
????

??
 (3.1) 

 

where ?? is the number of particles inside the volume, ?? is the 

material density of the particles and ?? is the volume of each particle. 

The great difficulty of this approach is to calculate the exact volume ?? 
of the system, since during sintering simulation the particles can move 

in an inordinate way due to the heterogeneities of random packings. 
Furthermore, symmetry is not present in many kinds of studied systems. 

To solve this problem, an alternative has been proposed as 

follows. First of all, a spherical volume ?? with radius ?? and position 
vector ?? is defined, where the density will be calculated. Figure 3.8 (a) 
shows a cubic packing of particles generated by the software, whereas 



63 

 

 

(b) is the same cube but cut in the central plane (the particles are hidden) 

and such spherical volume ?? can be seen with the gray lines.  
Secondly, an algorithm goes through every particle ith in the 

system with a radius ?? and position vector ?? and checks whether the 
particle is inside, outside or within the border of the spherical volume. 

For the calculation, the following geometrical cases must be considered: 

 

Case 1) particle is outside the sphere:          |?? ? ??|  ?  ?? + ?? 

Case 2) particle is inside the sphere:            |?? ? ??| + ?? ?  ??  

Case 3) particle is within the border and: 

Case 3.1) particle’s center outside the border: 

?? &amp;lt;|?? ? ??|  &amp;lt; ?? + ?? 

Case 3.2) particle’s center inside the border: 

?? ? ?? &amp;lt;|?? ? ??|  &amp;lt; ?? 

 

Figure 3.8: Random cubic packing of particles (a) and the same sample but 

cut in the central plane and with a spherical volume defined by the gray 

lines where the density is calculated (b). 

 
 

Case (1) and case (2) are more trivial to be solved. In case (1), 

the particle is not considered. In case (2) the total volume of the particle 

is taken into account for the density calculation. Case (3) is more 

complex to deal with because the particle’s partial volume inside the 

spherical volume must be calculated. For such a case, a solution 

regarding the intersection between two spheres has been used. Figure 

3.9 represents the spherical cap with height ? of a sphere with radius ?.

densification correctly.

4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
 

Before proceeding with the simulations, the packing of particles 

shall be generated and it should match some initial criteria: 

homogeneous and isotropic random packing of spheres, realistic 

coordination number and relative density for a green body. 

The numerical samples for this work have been generated by the 

software MUSEN’s algorithm of packing generation (see Section 3.1), 

which produces samples that satisfy the previous requirements. For all 

samples, a simulation box with a spherical geometry has been chosen, 

and the particles are randomly distributed through the packing. The 

maximum number of particles has been established to about 4000 

particles. Unfortunately, a limitation of DEM is the number of particles 

simulated, which could lead to a prohibitive computational time. 

However, Henrich et al. [3] have stated that few thousands of particles 

are enough to have a good compromise between acceptable computing 

time and reliable results.  

A common configuration used in DEM works are the periodic 

boundary conditions on the simulation box. This configuration allows an 

infinite lateral length to be represented, in which a particle that reaches 

the boundary of the simulation box will interact with the particle on the 

opposite side. However, due to the complexity of this configuration, it 

has not been implemented for the presented simulations. Thereby, a few 

simulations with a larger number of particles in the sample have been 

carried out in order to proof that the lack of periodic boundary 

conditions do not affect the overall results. 

 

4.1 NUMERICAL SAMPLES 
 

The numerical samples are divided into two groups:  

? monosized packing; 

? bimodal packing. 
 

The monosized packings have been generated in order to investigate 

the influence of varying volume fractions of each material (alumina and 
nickel) on the sintering behavior. Thus, eight numerical samples with 

particle diameter of 100 nm have been produced with varying 

compositions. Table 4.1 describes these samples. Packings composed by 

pure alumina and pure nickel have been also produced to be used as 

reference. There are three kinds of structures among the samples and 



68 

 

they are shown in the last column: matrix system (pure material), 

matrix-particulate system and interpenetrating structures.  The initial 

relative density of these packings is equal to 0.62. This relative density 

is below the random close packing limit of 0.64 [22] and it is a typical 

value for initial relative density used in DEM simulation of sintering [3, 

4]. Figure 4.1 (a) shows a screenshots of the initial spherical packing 

generated by software MUSEN with 80% of nickel volume fraction and 

(b) shows the numerical sample with nickel volume fraction of 40%. 

Note that blue particles represent alumina and gray represent nickel.

In order to investigate the influence of larger nickel particles 

during sintering, four numerical samples have been generated with 

varying nickel particles diameter. Table 4.3 shows the data related to the

60% and alumina particles diameter of 100 nm have been kept constant 

for all samples. The spherical simulation box size has been also kept 

constant. Hence, the total number of particles reduces as the nickel 

particle diameter increases. In fact, the number of nickel particles 

reduces, since the nickel particles increased their diameter.  

Wonisch et al. [22] state that the maximum value of relative 

density attainable for the random packing of particles is higher when 

packing with different particle sizes is used. For this reason, the initial 

relative density increases slightly as the particle diameter increases. 

Figure 4.3 (a) shows a screenshot of the initial spherical packing 

generated by MUSEN with nickel particle diameter 1.5 times larger, and 

(b) shows the numerical sample with nickel particle diameter 3.0 times 

larger.

4.2 SIMULATION PARAMETERS 
 

To simulate the sintering process for composites properly, real 

physical parameters for the materials chosen must be used. The metallic 

material chosen for this work was nickel, whereas the ceramic one was 

alumina. These materials have been chosen because their physical 

parameters are available in literature [5, 20] and, in fact, it is not easy to 

obtain them experimentally. Parameters such as activation energy for 

grain-boundary diffusion would need methods more complex to 

calculate them, for example quantum mechanism. The estimation of 

these parameters is out of scope of this project. 

Table 4.4 lists the physical parameters [5, 20] for both materials 

required by the contact model used (Equations 2.9; 2.10; 2.11 and 2.13).

The simulations have been carried out at constant sintering 

temperature. For the present work, the temperature has been chosen at 

1220 °C. Nickel and alumina particles in this size can sinter at this 

temperature, even though nickel has a higher potential to sinter whether 

compared to alumina. This conclusion may be justified at Table 4.4, 

because the nickel melting point is lower than alumina. It leads to a 

better atomic motion for nickel at the sintering temperature (diffusion 

parameter; see Equation 2.9 and 2.10). Moreover, nickel has a higher 

value of surface energy that results in larger values for sintering force in 

Equation 2.11.  

Table 4.5 lists other parameters related to the simulation, such 

as time step, saving time step and sliding friction coefficient (discussed 

in Section 2.5, Equation 2.13).

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

In this chapter we present the main results obtained along this 

project, as well as their interpretation. The results are divided into three 

parts. In the first part we show the simulations results of the monosized 

packing samples. Secondly, the results of the bimodal packings are 

exposed. The third part consists in a short presentation of the results 

with packings of larger number of particles. 

 

5.1 MONOSIZED PACKINGS
1
 

 

In this section we present and discuss the results about the 

simulations of the monosized packings with the varying contents of 

nickel and alumina. Firstly, it is presented the average contact radius 

evolution of the three kinds of contacts (nickel-nickel, alumina-alumina 

and nickel-alumina). Then, the average coordination number evolution 

is presented for the three kinds of contacts. Lastly, the global 

densification curves of all samples are shown and discussed. In order to 

clarify and support some explanations given along this section, some 

images of the samples after the simulation are also exhibited. 

Before starting to present the results, it is important to recall the 

concept of interpenetrating systems and matrix-particle systems (see 

Section 2.1.1) in order to explain the different structures present in the 

samples. For particulate systems with monosized packings, matrix-

particle structures are considered when the volume fraction of one 

material is less than 30%. The particles are either isolated or form small 

agglomerates, and can be treated as inclusions. Contents higher than 30 

vol.% form a percolated network of particles that are called 
interpenetrating structures. Thus, in the samples with 90 vol.% and 80 

vol.%, the nickel particles may be considered as the matrix phase and 

the alumina particles as inclusions. The samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.% 

can be considered as interpenetrating structures. The samples with 20 

vol.% and 10 vol.% alumina particles can be considered as matrix and 

the nickel particles as inclusions. Thereby, it is possible to expect 

different behaviors from these different structures as sintering proceeds.

5.1.1 Average Contact Radius Evolution 
 

As discussed in Section 3.2, the simulations must be stopped 

when the normalized average contact radius of particles attains 0.65 of 

the particle radius. However, due to the different sintering kinetics of 

nickel and alumina, the contact radius evolution of nickel-nickel, 

alumina-alumina and nickel-alumina contacts should be analyzed 

separately. All graphs concerning average contact radius (ACR) shown 

in this section are normalized by particle radius (?) to provide 
generality of the simulation results. The samples are referred by their 

volume fraction of nickel (%). 

 

? Nickel-Nickel contacts 
 

Figure 5.1 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-nickel (Ni-Ni) 

contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, 

80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% over the simulation time. First of all, a 

quite similar behavior of all samples over the time is clearly observed. 

At the time zero (before the simulation), the ACR of all samples is about 

0.003/?. Then, within the first time steps of simulation, there is an 
abrupt increase of the ACR. After ?? = 0.02?, the ACR growth is 
smoother and with an asymptotic behavior it reaches 0.65/? at about 

 ?? = 0.40?.  
It is possible to observe a small difference between the curves 

of 100 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, to the others. In these samples, 

alumina particles are treated as inclusions. Due to the lower sintering 

potential of alumina phase, its addition in metal-matrix composites tends 

to retard sintering and, consequently, delays Ni-Ni contact radius 

growth.  

Other important aspect of this work is the simulation time 

shown in ? axis. Indeed, this time is the “real time”, the time that these 
samples would take to sinter in real life. One might say that 0.4 seconds 

is quite fast to sinter any sample. However, it is important to observe the 

sintering conditions. The particles have 100 nm of diameter. Within this 

size range, they have a very high surface energy and high potential to 

sinter [40–43]. Moreover, the samples have less than 4000 particles. It 

means that the total sample diameter has few ?m of diameter, i.e., it is a 

very small sample, which would take few seconds to be sintered. In 

addition, it is important to observe that when the simulation starts, the 



75 

 

 

temperature is at the highest sintering temperature. There is no heating 

up phase for such situation. Therefore, at time zero the sintering 

temperature is the highest one for the process and equal to 1200 ºC. This 

temperature is quite high to sinter nickel, since its melting point is equal 

to 1455 ºC (see Table 4.4, Section 4.2), and could be expected that 

nickel sinters quite fast. 

 
Figure 5.1: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle 

radius) for nickel-nickel contacts of the monosized packings over time. The 

samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. 

 
 

? Alumina-Alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.2 shows the ACR evolution for alumina-alumina 

(Al2O3-Al2O3) contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 

90%, 80%, 60%; 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% (pure alumina) over the 

simulation time. Initially, these samples have the ACR about 0.003/?. 
Then, most of the ACR increase occurs within the earliest time steps and 

then it follows a smoother increase until attains about 0.3/? at  ?? =
0.40?.  

Along the simulations, the curves behavior for all samples is 

nearly the same and the alumina content only influences the sample 90% 

and 80%. In fact, the sample 90% has a more apparent increase. The 
high content of metal phase in this sample promotes high forces pulling 

the system to shrink and ends up transferring forces to sinter alumina 

particles.  



76 

 

Likely, the same behavior takes place for the sample 80%. 

However, the forces provided by nickel particles are more distributed 

through alumina ones and its effect is less pronounced. These 

affirmations are discussed in more detail in the next sections.

radius) for alumina-alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time.

? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius 
evolution 
 

Comparing Figure 5.1 and 5.2, a noticeable difference is 

observed in the ACR growth between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. 

The ACR for Ni-Ni contacts is more than twice the value of Al2O3-

Al2O3 contacts at  ?? = 0.40?. As stated in Section 4.2, this behavior 
might be expected since nickel has a higher value of surface energy and 

diffusion parameter if compared to the alumina ones. These parameters 

lead to higher forces attracting Ni-Ni contacts and the contact radius 

grows faster. Therefore, an important conclusion is that ACR growth of 

Ni-Ni contacts is the limiting point for the simulations, since Ni-Ni 

contacts reach 0.65/? before Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Consequently, the 
simulations are not valid after  ?? = 0.40? and all simulations shall be 
stopped at the point where Ni-Ni contacts reached value of 0.65/?. 

Another implication of the higher ACR growth of Ni-Ni 

contacts is that nickel particles induce higher sintering forces through 

the system and faster densifications. This conclusion is discussed in 



77 

 

 

more detail in the next sections and can be confirmed by the 

densification curves in Section 5.1.4 further on.  

Furthermore, it is possible to observe a slight variation in ACR 

growth of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts only for the samples 80% and 

90%. These samples are characterized as nickel-matrix composites and 

the alumina particles (with lower sintering potential) are considered 

inclusions. Then, alumina particles tend to retard the growing contact 

radius of Ni-Ni contacts. On the other hand, the nickel phase tends to 

densify the system with a high sintering force and, as consequence, to 

transfer forces to the alumina particles due to the particulate nature of 

the system.  

For the samples of nickel volume fraction of 60%, 40%, 20% 

and 10%, the Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts are not affected by the 

other phase. It means that nickel and alumina phases sinter separately 

from each other in these samples. 

 

? Nickel-alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.3 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-alumina (Ni-

Al2O3) contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 10% to 

90% over the simulation time. Moreover, the nickel-nickel contact 

evolution of pure nickel sample (100%) and alumina-alumina contact of 

pure alumina sample (0%) are also plotted for comparison criteria.  

Analyzing the Ni-Al2O3 contacts evolution in Figure 5.3, all 

samples show an ACR growth within the first time steps. From about 

?? = 0.01? on, the Ni-Al2O3 contacts start showing the ACR evolution 
dependent on the nickel content. For the samples 90%, 80% and 60%, 

the ACR growth increases as the nickel volume fraction increases. The 

effect of the nickel content shows stagnation for the sample 40%, 20% 

and 10%, whose ACR evolution follows that of the pure alumina Al2O3-

Al2O3 contacts. Comparing to the pure nickel Ni-Ni contact, the Ni-

Al2O3 contacts of all samples show slower ACR growth. 

To explain the behavior of Ni-Al2O3 contacts, it is necessary to 

remember Equation 2.15 that defines the normal force acting between 

these contacts. As discussed in Section 2.5, there is no sintering force 

attracting Ni-Al2O3 particles. The normal force is defined only by 
viscous force that acts to oppose the current motion of the particles. 

However, the whole system is shrinking due to the sintering force acting 

between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Then, Ni-Al2O3 particles tend 

to approximate and overlap each other as an indirect effect of the 



78 

 

sintering force shrinking the sample. At the same time, the viscous force 

between Ni-Al2O3 contacts acts to hinder the approximation motion of 

these particles.  

 
Figure 5.3: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle 

radius) for nickel-alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time. 

The samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. The alumina-

alumina contacts from the sample 0% and nickel-nickel from sample 100% 

are shown as reference. 

 
 

Furthermore, it was stated previously that nickel particles 

induce higher sintering forces to the system due to the faster ACR 

growth than alumina. From this conclusion, one may consider that there 

is a higher total force pulling the system to shrink when a higher content 

of nickel is present in the sample. Thus, higher nickel volume fraction 

results in higher total force shrinking the system and the effect of the 

viscous force between Ni-Al2O3 contacts are less pronounced. In other 

words, the effect of the viscous force between Ni-Al2O3 contacts is 

reduced as the nickel content increases. This occurs due to the higher 

total forces promoted by higher nickel contents in order to shrink to 

system.  

This explanation can be easily understood mainly for the 

samples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%. In these samples, the alumina particles 

are essentially isolated particles and surrounded by nickel particles. 
Thus, the Ni-Al2O3 contacts suffer higher influences from the nickel 

behavior (higher densifications). For the samples 40 vol.%, 20 vol.% 

and 10 vol.%, the higher alumina content promotes weaker sintering 

forces through the system and the Ni-Al2O3 contacts essentially follow 



79 

 

 

the ACR growth of the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. Even though the sample 

60 vol.% is considered as an interpenetrating structure, the higher nickel 

content influences slightly the Ni-Al2O3 contacts and its ACR growth is 

a bit higher than the samples 40 vol.%, 20 vol.% and 10 vol.%.  

Once again, it is important to remember that this explanation 

above is supported by the densification curves further on. 

 

5.1.2 Average Coordination Number Evolution 
 

Coordination number (CN) of each particle is defined as the 

number of neighboring particles in contact. As sintering proceeds, due to 

the shrinkage of the system and the rearrangement of the particles, CN 

tends to increase along the process. For a mixture of two materials, CN 

is an important parameter, which is related to the homogeneity of the 

particle distribution. Thus, CN of the three kinds of contact shall be 

analyzed separately since their evolution along sintering is not the same.  

It is important to point out that the average CN presented in this 

work shows slightly smaller values if compared to those presented in 

some works in literature [20, 22]. This is because no periodic boundary 

conditions were implemented for the numerical samples. Thereby, the 

particles on the packing border have lower CN and this reduces the 

average. Furthermore, in order to confirm that the lack of boundary 

conditions is not affecting the results, few simulations with a larger 

number of particles have been carried out and are presented in a section 

forward. 

 

? Nickel particles with nickel contacts 
 

Figure 5.4 shows the average coordination number (ACN) 

evolution for nickel particles with nickel contacts (Ni?Ni) of the 

samples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 

20% and 10% over the simulation time. Before the simulations, ACN of 

all samples is smaller than 3.5 and it decreases as the nickel content 

decreases. Once the sintering has started, ACN increases along the 

simulation, as expected. Overall, ACN growth is higher as the nickel 

content increases. 
 

  



80 

 

Figure 5.4: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles 

with nickel contacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples are 

referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. 

 
 

For the samples 20 vol.% and 10 vol.%, there is a small ACN 

growth within  ?? = 0.02? and then the curves are virtually constant 
until the end of the simulation. Within the first time steps, every Ni-Ni 

contact close to each other is formed and this configuration continues 

due the low nickel content. 

For the samples 40 vol.% and 60 vol.%, there is a sudden ACN 

growth within  ?? = 0.02? and then the curves grow slightly until the 
end of the simulation. This behavior is due to the interpenetrating 

structures. Even though the nickel particles have a limited number of 

nickel neighbors in such structures, the continuous network of particles 

allows the development of new Ni-Ni throughout the whole process. 

For the samples 80 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 100 vol.%, an abrupt 

ACN growth takes place within  ?? = 0.02?. Thereafter, it continues 
clearly increasing as the simulation proceeds. This increase is higher as 

the nickel content increases. Such a behavior is rather different if 

compared to the sample with nickel content lower than 80 vol.%. As 

nickel particles are considered the matrix for these systems, many new 

Ni-Ni contacts are developed along the whole sintering process. 

 

? Alumina particles with alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.5 shows the ACN evolution for alumina particles with 

alumina contacts of the samples with nickel volume fraction of 90%, 

80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% over the simulation time. Initially, 



81 

 

 

the sample 0 vol.% has ACN of 3.4 and the value decreases as the 

alumina content decreases. As the simulation proceeds, ACN of all 

samples naturally increases. This increase is higher as the alumina 

content increases.  

For the sample 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, the alumina particles are 

essentially isolated and have a limited number of neighboring alumina 

particles to develop new Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. ACN increase for these 

samples is very small during the whole process.  

For the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%, ACN increase of 

Al2O3-Al2O3 is more noticeable due to the continuous network of 

alumina particles.  

 
Figure 5.5: Average coordination number of alumina particles with alumina 

contacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples are referred to 

by the volume fraction of nickel. 

 
 

For the samples 20 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 0 vol.%, the alumina 

particles represent the matrix phase, which have many neighboring 

alumina particles to develop new Al2O3-Al2O3 contact through the 

whole simulation. Nevertheless, most of the ACN increase occurs within 

about  ?? = 0.05?. After that, the ACN increase is very slight. 
 

? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 coordination 
number evolution 
 

Comparing Figures 5.4 and 5.5, it is possible to realize some 

similarities and some differences. In general, the increase of ACN for all 



82 

 

sample of both Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 have the highest increase within 

the earliest simulation time. This is because there are higher forces 

pulling the system to shrink in the beginning of the process. Thus, most 

of the possible contacts are developed with neighboring particles in the 

beginning. 

First of all, a comparison is made for ACN evolution of isolated 

particles (Al2O3-Al2O3 of 90 vol.% and Ni-Ni of 10 vol.%; Al2O3-Al2O3 
of 80 vol.% and Ni-Ni of 20 vol.%). For both pair of samples, the 

behavior is practically the same. It means that these four samples can 

really represent matrix-particle systems. 

For the interpenetrating systems, ACN growth is also essentially 

the same, when comparing Ni-Ni contacts of the sample 60 vol.% with 

Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the sample 40 vol.% and Ni-Ni contacts of the 

sample 40 vol.% with Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the sample 60 vol.%. 

On the other hand, visible distinction may be observed when the 

ACN evolution of the matrix phase is compared. The ACN growth of 

Ni-Ni contacts when nickel is the matrix phase (samples 100 vol.%, 90 

vol.% and 80 vol.%) is higher than Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts when alumina 

is the matrix (samples 0 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 20 vol.%). It means that 

more Ni-Ni contacts are developed along the process when nickel is the 

matrix if compared to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts when alumina is the 

matrix. This is another effect and confirmation that nickel particles 

promote higher sintering forces and faster shrinkage of system.  

 

? Nickel particles with alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.6 shows the ACN evolution of nickel particles with 

alumina contacts (Ni?Al2O3) for the samples with nickel volume 

fraction of 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% over the simulation 

time. The ACN evolution of Ni-Ni contacts for pure nickel sample 

(100%) and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact for pure alumina sample (0%) are also 

plotted by comparison issue. Note that it is being analyzed in Figure 5.6 

the average number of alumina particles contacting each nickel particles. 

It is not the same than ACN of alumina particles with nickel contacts. 

The results would be completely different. For this reason, this 

parameter is referred as Ni?Al. 
Considering Ni?Al2O3 contacts, ACN increases as the alumina 

content increases. It means that there are more alumina particles 

surrounding (and contacting) the nickel particles when higher alumina 

content is present in the sample. ACN increase for all samples is quite 



83 

 

 

smaller than for both Ni-Ni contacts of pure nickel sample and for 

Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of pure alumina sample. 

 
Figure 5.6: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles 

with alumina contacts of the monosized packings over time. The samples 

are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. The alumina-alumina CN 

from the sample 0% and nickel-nickel CN from sample 100% are shown as 

reference. 

 
 

For the samples 10 vol.% and 20 vol.%, ACN increase is more 

noticeable within about  ?? = 0.15? and then its increase is smoother. As 
in these samples the nickel particles are mostly surrounded by alumina 

particles, several contacts may be developed by nickel particles with 

alumina. 

For the samples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%, ACN increase is very 

slight during the whole simulation and can be considered constant for 

such a case. The few alumina contacts of the nickel particles are already 

formed in the beginning of the process and the low alumina content does 

not allow new Ni?Al2O3 contacts to be developed. 

Even though the number of interfaces between nickel and 

alumina should be higher for the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%, ACN 

increase of Ni?Al2O3 does not follow a behavior that one might expect. 

This occurs due to the interpenetrating structures of the phases and its 

effect during sintering. The nickel and alumina phase densify 

independently from each other for the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%. It 

means that nickel particles tend to approach other nickel particles and 

the same happens with alumina. This situation is more pronounced for 

the sample 60 vol.% where only few new Ni?Al2O3 contacts are 



84 

 

developed. Due to the higher alumina content in sample 40 vol.%, more 

Ni?Al2O3 contacts are developed during the simulation, although the 

behavior described before is also present. 

 

5.1.3 Visual Analysis of the Monosized Samples  
 

In order to visualize the different sintering behaviors discussed 

in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, Figure 5.7 shows screenshots of the sample 

80 vol.% (matrix-particles structures) and 60 vol.% (interpenetrating 

structures). Figure 5.7 (a) shows the sample 80 vol.% before the 

simulation and (b) after the simulation. Figure 5.7 (c) shows the sample 

60 vol.% before the simulation and (d) after the simulation. In these 

screenshots, a cross section of the samples is shown at the middle of axis 

? (see the coordinate axes) to visualize inside the packing. The gray 
particles represent nickel, whereas blue particles represent alumina. Note 

that the green lines represent the initial size of the spherical simulation 

box.  

In Figures 5.7 (a) and (b), it is possible to observe that the 

whole sample of 80 vol.% shrinks along the simulation. The edges of the 

sample move away considerably from the initial simulation box size. 

Indeed, this is a qualitative (visual) confirmation that this sample is 

densifying. Furthermore, as nickel is the matrix phase for such a case, 

the nickel phase probably controls the densification throughout the 

sintering process.  

On the other hand, the sintering behavior of the sample 60 

vol.% in Figure 5.7 (c) and (d) is rather distinct. The final distance of the 

sample borders to the initial simulation box size is less pronounced than 

in the sample 80 vol.%. It is observed that nickel particles are highly 

densified with large contact radius developed between Ni-Ni contacts 

through the continuous network of particles. Meanwhile, the alumina 

particles are barely densified and the Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius is quite 

small. This is in agreement with the average contact radius evolution for 

Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts shown in Section 5.1.1.

initial and final configuration of the sample 80 vol.% of nickel; (c and d) 

initial and final configuration of the sample 60 vol.% of nickel.  
 

 

 

 
 

 

Still in Figure 5.7 (d), several empty spaces can be seen among 
nickel-alumina interfaces due to the high attraction between Ni-Ni 

particles. This supports the low increase of the ACN for Ni?Al2O3 

shown in Figure 5.6 for the sample 60 vol.%. Moreover, grain growth 

should occur among nickel particles from that point of the simulation on

(?? = 0.40?) to simulate the process realistically, as discussed 
previously.  

These qualitative statements about Figure 5.7 are supported 

quantitatively by the densification curves in the next section. 

 

5.1.4 Global Densification  
 

Figure 5.8 shows the global relative density (RD) evolution of 

the monosized samples with nickel volume fraction of 100%, 90%, 80%, 

60%, 40%, 20%, 10% and 0% over the simulation time. It is observed 

that RD increases for all samples along the process. However, RD 

increase for the samples with nickel volume fraction lower than 80% is 

very small and completely different whether compared to the samples 

100 vol.%, 90 vol.% and 80 vol.%. 

 
Figure 5.8: Global relative density evolution of all monosized samples over 

time. The samples are referred to by the volume fraction of nickel. 

 
 

Observing Figure 5.8, the relative density evolution of the 

whole sample is highly dependent of sample composition. The sample 

with pure nickel (100 vol.%) shows the highest RD increase among all 

samples. As there are no alumina particles to retard the densification, the 

sample follows the nickel sintering kinetics.  

Comparing the samples of pure nickel (100 vol.%) and pure 

alumina (0 vol.%), the nickel shows a faster densification evolution than 

alumina. It confirms that the nickel parameters lead to higher total forces 

to shrink and densify the system during sintering. 



87 

 

 

Comparing the samples 90 vol.% and 80 vol.% with the sample 

100 vol.% (nickel-matrix composite), the RD growth is reduced as the 

alumina content increases. As discussed previously (see Section 2.5), 

nickel and alumina contacts are not sintering and solely viscous forces 

describe their contacts. Thereby, alumina particles offer a resistance for 

the shrinkage of the system and this resistance is higher as the alumina 

content increases. Moreover, it should be recalled that the samples 90 

vol.% and 80 vol.% represent matrix-particle system, where nickel is the 

matrix phase. For this reason, the nickel particles are able to drive the 

shrinkage of the whole system and proceed with the densification. 

For the samples 60 vol.%, 40 vol.%, 20 vol.%, 10 vol.% and 0 

vol.%, RD evolution is very slight and virtually the same. RD of these 

samples increases only from 0.62 to about 0.66 at  ?? = 0.4?. The 
densification of these samples is essentially controlled by the alumina 

kinetics. 

This statement can be more easily understood for the samples 

10 vol.% and 20 vol.%. These two samples are considered matrix-

particle system, where alumina phase is the matrix. Thus, the alumina 

phase drives the shrinkage of the packing. The resistance imposed by the 

nickel particles is very slight and can be neglected for such a case. 

As discussed in the last sections, the nickel and alumina phase 

sinter separately from each other through the interpenetrating structures 

(samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.%). Furthermore, it was shown that the 

average contact radius growth (see Section 5.1.1) of nickel is rather 

faster than the alumina one, resulting in different densification kinetics. 

Thus, while the continuous network of nickel particles is in advanced 

stage of the sintering, the alumina one is many steps back. Thereby, 

globally the samples 60 vol.% and 40 vol.% shall present the 

densification of the system basically controlled by the slowest kinetic 

step. In this case, this is the alumina phase. 

The findings described in this section are in line with those 

presented in the sections about average contact radius evolution, average 

coordination number evolution and qualitative analysis of the sample 

(Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, respectively).  

 

5.1.5 Samples with Higher Number of Monosized Particles 
 

Simulations of monosized samples with larger number of 

particles have been carried out in order to proof that the lack of periodic 

boundary conditions is not affecting the simulation results and the main 



88 

 

conclusions. The nickel volume fraction is the same of the smaller 

samples (pure nickel, nickel volume of 90, 80, 60, 40, 20 and 10% and 

pure alumina) but the number of particles is four times higher (~16,000 

particles in each sample). 

Figure 5.9 shows global relative density evolution of all larger 

monosized samples over the simulation time. Note that the simulation 

time is longer than for the smaller samples. Thus, it is possible to 

conclude that the trends are valid even for longer simulation times. 

 
Figure 5.9: Global relative density evolution of all monosized samples with 

16,000 particles over time. The samples are referred to by the nickel volume 

fraction. 

 
 

Comparing Figures 5.9 and 5.8 (RD evolution of the larger and 

smaller samples, respectively), it is confirmed that the boundary 

conditions do not affect the overall results. The trend of the curves are 

essentially the same, in which pure nickel shows the highest RD 

evolution, followed by the sample of 90 and 80 vol.%. In addition, one 

may realize the retarded densification of samples 60 and 40 vol.%, 

which is slightly more pronounced here.  

 

5.1.6 Discussion of Monosized Packings  
 
The monosized packing results presented along this chapter can 

be divided into two categories. Firstly, some general trends are 

discussed. The highest growth of the average contact radius and the 

coordination number occurred within the beginning of the simulation, 

regardless the type of contact (Ni-Ni, Al2O3- Al2O3 or Ni-Al2O3). Such a 



89 

 

 

behavior is explained by the high potential of the particles to sinter at the 

initial step, when no viscous forces exist to provide a resistance for 

sintering. This was explained in Section 3.4 (Figures 3.6 and 3.7), in 

which high forces were observed pulling the particles together and 

resulting in high velocities. Therefore, simulations of metal-ceramic 

composites are also following this expected behavior of samples with 

one phase. 

Due to the substantial difference between sintering potential of 

nickel and alumina material, it was needed to outline which phase would 

define the stopping point for the simulation. Nickel particles have higher 

surface energy and diffusion parameter and sinters quite faster than 

alumina particles. Ceramic particles barely densified as metal particles 

already reached the final relative density of 90% (represented by the 

contact radius of 65% of the particles radius). This is clearly observed in 

ACR charts (Figure 5.1 and 5.2). Thus, nickel particles define when the 

simulation must be stopped. 

Beyond these general behaviors found for all samples, there are 

some related to the content of metal and ceramic phase. From this point 

of view, the results can be divided into three groups: metal-matrix 

composite, ceramic-matrix composite and interpenetrating structure.  

For the nickel-matrix composites (samples 80%, 90% and 100% 

volume of nickel), the sintering is driven by the nickel kinetics. It is 

important to remember that in matrix-particulate composite materials 

within this range of content, ceramic phase is added as hard inclusions 

and has the purpose to reinforce the composite [7]. Typically, ceramic 

phase (such as alumina) has lower sintering activity than the metal one 

and, thereby, its addition into metal-matrix sample as inclusions retards 

densification [5]. From this knowledge, the densification curve (Figure 

5.8) shows the pure metal sample with the highest densification rate and 

it decreases as the alumina content is increased.  

Additionally, the sample of 90 vol.% shall be analyzed 

individually. In this volume content (10%) the alumina particles are 

essentially isolated particles. This content is enough to reduce the 

densification, even though the final relative density is comparable to the 

pure metal sample. These findings are in line with the simulation results 

of Martin et al. [20] and experimentally derived results of Olmos et al. 
[5] as well as of Nakada and Kimura [44]. Those authors claim that rigid 

particles in a matrix retard the sintering leading to longer sintering time 

but still comparable relative densities.  



90 

 

When the ceramic content is increased to 20%, the alumina 

phase is not isolated as inclusions anymore. Here, they form small 

aggregates and agglomerates (see Figure 5.7 a). As shown in Figure 5.4, 

the coordination of Ni-Ni is reduced and, consequently, the sintering 

potential is restrained as well. Once again, this result is in agreement 

with Yan et al.’s work [6], in which the authors varied the content of 

inclusions.  

Nevertheless, the alumina agglomerates in the sample 80% are 

sintering as well. Analyzing the evolution of ACR for the Ni-Al2O3 
contact (Figure 5.3), one can recognize a relatively high value for 

nickel–matrix composites. This evolution of ACR between nickel and 

alumina particles is promoted by forces acting on these contacts. As the 

nickel particles drive the system and promote densification, they 

develop new contacts with other nickel particles as well as with alumina 

particles. Because of the particulate structure of the system, the sintering 

forces are distributed to all contacting particles. 

The second group of results is the alumina-matrix composites, 

which considered samples with nickel volume of 10%, 20% and pure 

alumina (sample 0%). As exposed previously, alumina has a lower 

sintering activity than nickel and the global densification of them is very 

small (only ~4%). Indeed, sintering of alumina particles occurs only 

slightly. One might say that the sample is just creating necks but not 

densifying. This observation is in agreement with experimental 

observations of sintering of submicron alumina particles at 1200 ºC [45]. 

At the temperature used in the simulation (1200 ºC), it would be 

necessary much longer simulation time to reach comparable relative 

densities for such samples. One possible suggestion would be to increase 

the time step. However, this alternative is not valid here because the 

nickel parameters defined the maximum time step for the simulation and 

its increase would lead to numerical instability.  

The last group is the interpenetrating structure (samples nickel 

fraction 40 and 60 vol.%). The global densification of them is very small 

and basically follows the alumina kinetics. Looking at Figures 5.7 c) and 

d), it can be observed that the nickel and alumina phases form a 

continuous network of particles. The densification of each phase occurs 

separately. As the metal particles already reached the densification of 
90%, alumina particles are only at 66%. Since there are many contacts 

between metal and ceramic phase, several defects (cracks) are developed 

through the sample and the initial configuration is destroyed.  

 



91 

 

 

5.2 BIMODAL PACKINGS 
 

In this section, the results concerning the simulations of the 

packings with varying nickel particle size are presented and discussed. 

The first part shows the average contact radius evolution for nickel-

nickel, alumina-alumina and nickel-alumina contacts. Then, the 

coordination number evolution is presented for the three kinds of 

contacts as well. Finally, the global relative density evolution for all 

bimodal samples is presented and compared. Beyond the bimodal 

packings, the monosized packing with nickel volume fraction of 60% 

(the same content than the bimodal packings) is also presented along this 

section for comparison criteria. This sample is referred to as particle size 

ratio 1.0. 

It is important to recall that the nickel volume fraction is equal 

to 60% for all samples, which means that they are interpenetrating 

structures. Furthermore, the simulation box size has been kept constant 

and it leads to the reduction of the number of nickel particles as the 

nickel particle size increase (see Table 4.2 in Section 4.1).  

 

5.2.1 Average Contact Radius Evolution 
 

The average contact radius (ACR) is the limiting point for the 

simulation of bimodal packing as well as it was for the monosized 

packing. The three kinds of contacts (nickel-nickel, alumina-alumina 

and nickel-alumina) are analyzed separately due to their different 

evolution. Their respective particles radius ? normalizes the ACR of 
each sample. The bimodal samples are referred to by the ratio of their 

nickel particle radius to the alumina particles radius.  

 

? Nickel-nickel contacts 
 
Figure 5.10 shows ACR evolution for nickel-nickel (Ni-Ni) 

contacts of the samples with particle radius ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 

3.0 over the simulation time. First, a noticeable influence of the particle 

radius is observed on the ACR growth. Note that the simulation time in 

this Figure is rather longer (?? = 5.0?) if compared to that one used to 
simulate the monosized packings (?? = 0.40?). 

Analyzing Figure 5.10, ACR growth of Ni-Ni contacts is clearly 

slower as the particle size increases. This behavior is quite well 

theoretically established since smaller particles have higher total surface 



92 

 

energy and induce higher driven force for sintering (see Section 2.3.1.2). 

Moreover, such a behavior can be also understood by the normal force 

acting between Ni-Ni contacts (Equation 2.11 in Section 2.5). The 

sintering term in this equation increases linearly as the particle radius 

increases. On the other hand, the viscous term increases as the contact 

radius increases in the fourth power. As larger particles develop larger 

contact radius, the viscous term (resistance) opposing the approximation 

motion of these particles is higher. Therefore, the normal force acting to 

attract a pair of particles is smaller for larger particles.  

 
Figure 5.10: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle 

radius) for nickel-nickel contacts of the bimodal packings over time. The 

samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

As consequence of these different kinetics caused by the 

particles radius, the simulation time to attain the limiting point (0.65/?) 
increases as the particles radius increases. While sample 1.0 (monosized 

packing 60 vol.%) reaches the limiting point at ?? = 0.4?, the bimodal 
sample 1.5 does at about ?? = 1.8?. The samples 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 do not 
reach the limit contact radius within the simulation time carried out of 

?? = 5.0?. The final ACR reached by these samples is higher as the 
particle radius ratio decreases. It should be pointed out that the increase 

in time is not linear due to the relation in the fourth power of the contact 
radius, as stated previously. 

 

 

 



93 

 

 

? Alumina-alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.11 shows the ACR evolution for alumina-alumina 

contacts (Al2O3-Al2O3) of the samples with particle radius ratio of 1.0, 

1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. 

 
Figure 5.11: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle 

radius) for alumina-alumina contacts of the bimodal packings over time. 

The samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

No difference is observed in Figure 5.11 in ACR growth of 

Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts for these samples, as expected. Since the alumina 

particles have the same size in all samples, the growth kinetic of ACR is 

the same. Furthermore, as the number and size of alumina particles are 

the same in the monosized and bimodal samples, these curves are in 

accordance with those obtained by the ACR growth of Al2O3-Al2O3 
contact for the monosized packing (Figure 5.2 in Section 5.1.1).  

 

? Comparison between Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius 
evolution 
 

In order to compare the ACR growth of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 

contacts, Figure 5.12 shows the curves of both contacts. Only one curve 

of Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts is plotted (sample 3.0) since these contacts are 

essentially the same for all samples (see Figure 5.10). 

 

 



94 

 

Figure 5.12: Comparison of the average contact radius evolution 

(normalized by particle radius) of Ni-Ni and Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts of the 
bimodal packings over time. The samples are referred to by the nickel-

alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

Analyzing Figure 5.12, ACR growth of Ni-Ni contacts reduces 

and tends to approximate to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts curve as the nickel 

particles size increases. However, the ACR growth of the largest nickel 

particle (sample 3.0) is faster than the alumina one. Nevertheless, one 

may expect that for a certain nickel particle size, the ACR growth of Ni-

Ni contacts would became slower than alumina. This proposition could 

be tested for further works with the particles size ratio at most 4.0 times 

larger. This is because the generalization used in this work (see Equation 

2.16 in Section 2.5) for bimodal pair of particles is valid up to this limit. 

Therefore, it is concluded that nickel has the fastest sintering 

kinetic and determines the limiting point of the simulations for the size 

ratio used in this work. 

 

? Nickel-alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.13 shows the ACR evolution for nickel-alumina (Ni-

Al2O3) contacts of the samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 

2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. The Al2O3-Al2O3 evolution of the 

sample 3.0 is also plotted by comparison criteria.  

Observing the ACR growth of Ni-Al2O3 contacts, one might 

realize a certain tendency. Considering the sample 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, the 

increase of ACR is slower as the nickel particle size increases. The 



95 

 

 

evolution for the samples 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 are quite similar and can be 

neglected for such a small variation. 

 
Figure 5.13: Average contact radius evolution (normalized by particle 

radius) for nickel-alumina contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The 

samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

The behavior of the samples 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 can be an effect of 

the weaker forces promoted by larger nickel particles, which was 

discussed previously in this section. Thus, the total force shrinking the 

system is smaller when larger particles are present and the effect of the 

viscous forces acting between Ni-Al2O3 (see Equation 2.13 in Section 

2.5) is more pronounced. 

When compared to the Al2O3-Al2O3 contact radius evolution, 

Ni-Al2O3 contacts with particle size ratios larger than 2.0 show slower 

ACR growth. It means that the global influence caused by larger nickel 

particles is less pronounced. 

 

5.2.2 Average Coordination Number Evolution 
 

The coordination number may show a substantial variation due 

to the particle size increase. Thus, the average coordination number 

(ACN) of the bimodal samples is analyzed separately for each kind of 

contact: nickel particles with nickel contacts, alumina particles with 

alumina contacts and nickel particles with alumina contacts. 

 

 



96 

 

? Nickel particles with nickel contacts 
 

Figure 5.14 shows the ACN evolution for nickel particles with 

nickel contacts (Ni?Ni) of the samples with particle size ratios of 1.0, 

1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. Note that the highest value 

of the ACN is 5. As expected, ACN increases for all samples and it 

occurs within the earliest simulation times.  

 
Figure 5.14: Average coordination number evolution for nickel particles 

with nickel contacts of the bimodal packing over time. The samples are 

referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

Comparing the samples 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5, it is possible to 

observe a tendency. The increase of ACN is smaller as the particles size 

increases. The reason for such a behavior is the reduction of the total 

number of nickel particles as the particle size increases (see Table 4.2 in 

Section 4.1). As discussed previously, in order to keep the simulation 

box size constant and at the same time increase the nickel particle size 

(for the same volume fraction), it is necessary to reduce to number of 

nickel particles. Thus, larger nickel particles have less nickel neighbors 

to develop contacts and the ACN decreases.  

However, the sample 3.0 does not follow the behavior 

previously described in Figure 5.14. This sample shows an increase of 

ACN higher than the sample 2.0 and 2.5, and close to the sample 1.5. 

Likely, this is because the nickel particles are not so homogeneously 

distributed through the sample 3.0, as it can be seen in the cross-section 

of this sample in Figure 5.14. This sample has only 92 nickel particles. 

For such a small number of particles, any small heterogeneity 



97 

 

 

(unavoidable in random packing of particles) might cause these 

differences in the coordination number.

? Alumina particles with alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.16 shows the ACN evolution for alumina particles with 

alumina contacts of the samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 

2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. Once again, the highest value of 

the ACN is 5.  

In Figure 5.16, ACN increases for all samples as simulation 

proceeds and it occurs within the earliest simulation times. This increase 

is higher as the nickel particle size increases, though the differences are 

very slight. The reason for this behavior is related to the spatial 

distribution of nickel and alumina volumes through the bimodal 

samples. As already reported, the nickel particles size has been 

increased to the same volume fraction. Hence, the same nickel volume 

that was widely spread through the monosized sample is in turn 

clustered in the larger particles. In other words, the nickel volume spatial 

distribution decreases as the particle size increases. Meanwhile, alumina 

particles are also more clustered as the nickel particle size increases and 

have more neighboring alumina to develop more Al2O3-Al2O3 contacts. 

This explanation is supported by the samples screenshots in the next 

section.

? Nickel particles with alumina contacts 
 

Figure 5.17 shows the ACN evolution for nickel particles with 

alumina contacts (Ni?Al) of the samples with particle size ratios of 1.0, 

1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over the simulation time. In this case, the highest 

value on the ACN is 15.  

Looking at Figure 5.17, large differences can be observed for 

the ACN evolution of Ni?Al2O3 along the simulations. The increase of 

ACN is higher as the nickel particle size increases. Indeed, the distance 

between pairs of close curves is higher as the particle size increases. The 

explanation for such a behavior is due to the ratio between the particles 

size. Larger nickel particles have larger surface area. It means that they 

have superficial space to develop larger number of contacts for a given 

size of alumina particles. This behavior is rather evident and it should be 

expected. Nevertheless, it is important to note that it is shown the 

average of the coordination number. If the total number of Ni?Al2O3 

contacts was presented instead the average, it would be smaller the 

larger nickel particles.  

In fact, this behavior related to the ACN of Ni?Al2O3 is very 
important to the overall sintering behavior. It may explain an unexpected 

behavior found in the global densification, which is explored in the next 

sections.

5.2.3 Visual Analysis of the Bimodal Packings 
 

Figure 5.18 shows screenshots of the bimodal samples before 

and after the simulation in order to analyze the samples qualitatively. 

The smallest and the largest particles size ratio are shown. Figure 5.18 

(a) shows the sample of ratio 1.5 before the simulation and (b) after the 

simulation (?? = 2.0?). Figure 5.18 (c) shows the sample of ratio 3.0 
before the simulation and (d) after the simulation (?? = 5.0?). These 
differences in the final simulation time are due to the difference contact 

radius growth in these samples (see Figure 5.10 in Section 5.2.1). The 

screenshots show a cross section of the samples at the middle of axis ? 
(see the coordinate axes) to visualize inside the packing. The gray 

particles represent nickel whereas blue particles represent alumina 

particles. Note that the green lines represent the initial size of the 

spherical simulation box. 

In Figure 5.18 (a) it is observed that the sample of ratio 1.5 has 

nickel and alumina particles well distributed all over the packing. 

Comparing to the sample of ratio 1.0 (monosized samples 60 vol.% in 

Figure 5.7 (c) in Section 5.1.3), it is possible to notice the spatial 
distribution of volume changes in ratio 1.5 due to the larger nickel 

particles, as discussed in the last section. In Figure 5.17 (b), the edges of 

the sample move away slightly from the initial simulation box size. 

Hence, small densification should be expected.

initial and final configuration of the sample with particle size ratio 1.5; (c 

and d) initial and final configuration of the sample with particle size ratio 

3.0.  

 

 
 

When the ratio 3.0 is analyzed in Figure 5.18 (c), the variation 
in the spatial distribution of volume is even more pronounced. The 

alumina particles are clearly clustered since the same nickel volume is 

distributed through larger particles. Moreover, a higher number of 

alumina is observed surrounding larger nickel particles, as exposed in 

the coordination number of Ni?Al2O3 contacts (see Figure 5.16). The

sample after the simulation (d) shows a noticeable distance of edges 

from the simulation box size. It means that the sample is shrinking 

during the simulation.  

Comparing the samples 1.5 and 3.0 (Figure 5.18) to the sample 

1.0 (Figure 5.7 (c) and (d) in Section 5.1.3), some substantial differences 

can be observed. The sintering behavior changes even though the nickel 

content is identical. While nickel and alumina particles sinter 

independently from each other in the sample 1.0, the densification can 

be noticed in a global manner in the samples 1.5 and 3.0. Those big 

empty defects (cracks) formed in the sample 1.0 throughout the 

simulation are not present in the final samples 1.5 and 3.0. As discussed 

in Section 5.2.1, smaller nickel particles have higher forces attracting 

each other. Thereby, larger nickel particles do not develop such high 

forces to cluster themselves and then alumina particles can keep 

attached by means of the viscous forces. Therefore, larger nickel 

particles densify more slowly but at the same time are able to “carry” 

alumina together and promote the densification globally. 

These conclusions are supported by the quantitative analyses in 

the following section. 

 

5.2.4 Global Densification  
 

Figure 5.19 shows global relative density (RD) evolution of the 

bimodal samples with particle size ratio of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 over 

the simulation time.  

As expected, RD increases for all samples along the process. In 

the beginning of the simulation a great portion of the densification 

occurs due to the rearrangements and low viscous forces between pairs 

of particles. This behavior is in accordance with the sintering theory (see 

Section 2.3.3). The densification curves in Figure 5.19 are similar to 

those in Figure 2.6. 

Furthermore, it is possible to notice a tendency in Figure 5.19. 

The increase of the relative density is higher as the particle size 

increases. Indeed, this tendency can be in the other way around than one 

might expect. As it was stated and demonstrated previously, smaller 

particles have higher sintering activity to promote densification (see 
Section 5.2.1 about contact radius evolution). Then, larger particles 

should decrease the densification rate.

time. The samples are referred to by the nickel-alumina particle size ratio. 

 
 

However, the behavior found in the densification results can be 

explained by the microstructural nature of interpenetrating structures 

and by the large difference between the kinetic parameters of metals and 

ceramics. This is discussed in detail in the next section. 

 

5.2.5 Discussion of Bimodal Packings  
 

The investigation of bimodal packing of composites has led to 

two different conclusions, which are not theoretically expected.  

The first discussion regards the microanalysis of the samples 

with average contact radius and coordination number results. It has been 

found that larger particles have taken longer to attain the final ACR 

(65% of the particle radius), as observed in Figure 5.10. This is in 

agreement with the sintering theory, in which larger particles have lower 

surface energy and, thereby, less sintering activity. Therefore, the 

simulations of larger particles have demonstrated that sintering of pair of 

contacts is following the expected behavior. 

On the other hand, the global densification results (Figure 5.19) 

do not show the same tendency described before. The samples with 

larger particles have reached higher relative density at the final of 

simulation. To explain such behavior, it is needed to recall two 

important facts. Firstly, the nickel volume fraction chosen to simulate to 

bimodal packings is 60% and, thereby, they are interpenetrating 

structures. Still, it is pointed out that for the monosized sample with 60 

vol.% the metal and ceramic phase sintered independently from each 



103 

 

 

other and, as a consequence, it has shown the slowest densification 

among the samples (see section 5.1.3, 5.1.4 and 5.1.5). Many defects 

have been developed through the sample because the metal phase 

sintered too fast compared to the ceramic phase and they formed clusters 

of nickel particles. In other words, the monosized packing with 60% 

volume of nickel barely densified globally due to the great difference 

between the sintering kinetics of the materials. 

In parallel, the simulations with bimodal have not shown 

development of such defects (cracks). As explained in Section 5.3.1, the 

sintering force attracting larger nickel particles is weaker and it is not 

enough to cluster them, as observed in the monosized sample. Moreover, 

the viscous forces (see Section 2.5), which act always against the 

movement, have an absolute value more significant for these lower 

sintering forces. Therefore, the alumina particles in the bimodal packing 

can keep attached to nickel ones and nickel particles are able to drive the 

densification of the whole sample.  

Thus, composite materials characterized as interpenetrating 

structures and composed by two phases (metal and ceramic) with large 

differences in sintering potential, larger metal particles can drive more 

homogenous densification and fewer defects can be developed through 

the samples. Consequently, higher relative densities can be reached if 

compared to smaller metal particles due to the difference in the forces 

distribution.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 

The software MUSEN has been used to simulate the sintering 

process after implementing a suitable contact model. It is possible to 

have access to the particles position, velocity, force, coordination 

number, as well as to see the shrinkage of the sample on the software 3D 

interface. Using the position over simulation time, it was possible to 

calculate the evolution of average contact radius between particles. 

Additionally one can observe particle rearrangement, crack development 

and calculate the relative density inside a specified volume of the 

sample. From the relative density calculation, it is possible to plot the 

densification curve of the process. 

The special modeling approach proposed in this work has 

shown to be capable to simulate sintering of composites even in case of 

interpenetrating structures. The simulation results of the monosized 

packing can be divided in three different sintering behaviors: metal-

controlled, ceramic-controlled and contact retarded sintering.  

The metal-controlled samples have shown the highest 

densification rates and relative density evolution, as one might expect. 

The nickel particles have higher potential to sinter faster than alumina 

due to their kinetic parameters and surface energy. Hence, metal 

particles induce high forces to shrink the system and indirectly transfer 

forces to the sintering of ceramic phase. Therefore, the sintering of 

ceramic particles is supported by the metal phase. These interactions 

between metal and ceramic phase are important in densification of 

composites when materials with large differences of sintering kinetic are 

used.  

Moreover, the addition of a second phase with low sintering 

activity (in this case alumina) reduces the overall densification in 

comparison to the pure metal and it takes longer to reach the same 

relative density. This result is in line with those found in the literature 

and confirms the correctness of the proposed approach.  

The contact retarded sintering has been found for the samples 

characterized as interpenetrating structures. They have shown the lowest 

overall densification due to independent densification of metal and 

ceramic phase. It has led to large cracks through the samples and the 
initial structure has been lost. For this reason, it is recommended to use 

materials with similar diffusion parameters to achieve homogenous 

densification of an interpenetrating metal-ceramic composite. This 

investigation might be a topic for further works. 



106 

 

The simulation of bimodal packing with larger nickel particles 

and metal volume fraction of 60% has shown results that are more 

debatable. Individual analysis of particles, through the contact radius 

evolution, has shown slower growing for larger nickel particles, as 

expected. However, the global densification is higher for larger 

particles. This might be explained by the particle configuration in 

interpenetrating structures, in which metal and alumina form continuous 

network of particle and the distribution of forces throughout the system. 

Since smaller particles have higher forces attracting each other, the 

metal phase sinters quickly and forms long agglomerates of particles and 

the global densification barely take place. When larger nickel particles 

are present, the forces promoted by them are weaker. Thereby, the 

viscous force between nickel-alumina contacts is enough to keep these 

contacts attached and, finally, a global densification is observed.  

Therefore, composite materials characterized as interpenetrating 

structures and composed by two phases (metal and ceramic) with large 

differences in sintering potential, larger metal particles can drive more 

homogenous densification and fewer defects can be developed through 

the samples. Consequently, higher relative densities can be reached if 

compared to smaller metal particles due to the difference in the forces 

distribution.  

To confirm the correctness of the present modeling approach 

for bimodal packing, it is suggested for further works to carry out 

simulation of metal-matrix composites, instead of interpenetrating 

structures, with varying of the size of metal particles. Other suggestion 

for future work is to use samples with a distribution of particle size, 

which would make the simulation closer to reality. Still, it would be 

interesting to use nickel and zirconia as materials of the composite for 

further works. These materials have more similar sintering parameters 

and it would lead to more homogenous densification.
