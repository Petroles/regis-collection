It´s been a long road, but here I am at the end, but there are so many 

people to whom thanks I extend. 

First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Dra. 

Sabrina Carvalho, who has supported me though out my thesis with her 

patience and knowledge whilst allowing me the room to work in my own way. 

Great mentorship, good advices, thanks you very much for the precious time! I 

attribute the level of my Master´s degree to her encouragement and effort and 

without her this thesis, would not have been completed or written. One simply 

could not wish for a better or friendlier supervisor. 

My utmost gratitude goes to my Portuguese supervisor Prof. Dra. Berta 

Gonçalves, for her moral support and helped me to maintain the focus during 

this year. 

To Prof. Dr. Maarten Schrama, thank you very much for the big smile every 

day in the greenhouse, expert guidance and lab-work help, and all the 

knowledge shared. 

To Maaike Van Agtmaal, Angela Straathof and Levi Bin thank you for the 

partnership and good advices. 

I am grateful to Prof. Dr. Wim Van der Putten, who gave me the 

opportunity to work in NIOO-KNAW. 

To my grandmother, you were the best example of life that I could have 

known. My warrior, companion and above all thank you for the support you 

gave me when I risked and went to live in the Netherlands. 

To my parents, for all the support, love, patience, thank you for everything. 

What I am is because of you two.  

To my brother, you have shown me how to dream big and to believe. 



iii 

 

To my aunt Gi, thank you were a key in this process you have nurtured my 

learning, my enthusiasm, supporting always my dreams! 

For all my colleagues in NIOO, who made my everyday a nice day. 

For all, that helped me in this thesis anyhow.

Soil and soil biodiversity are the driving force of all the terrestrial 

production systems and ecosystem services. The intensification of agriculture 

production and shifts from extensive crop rotation have, regularly, a profound 

negative effect on soils and their biodiversity. Biodiversity losses result in less 

complex soil communities. The increasing demand of soil ecosystem implies the 

improvement of soil and crop management, and it’s a key opportunity for 

supporting sustainable economic development. The sustainable management 

of any ecosystem requires, amongst other information, a thorough 

understanding of plant-soil feedback attempting to describe natural patterns 

and relations between the plants and their environment. 

Plants produce organic substances by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis 

depends upon the absorption of light by pigments, as chlorophyll-a among 

other accessory pigments, in the leaves of the plants. Therefore, leaf optical 

properties are influenced by the concentration of the photosynthetic pigments, 

metabolites, water content, leaf structure and leaf anatomy. Hyperspectral 

reflectance in remote sensing has gained scientific and commercial importance 

but still remains underdeveloped despite its potential. Vegetation remote 

sensing is a great tool, as it can extrapolate to synoptic scales and time 

sequences can be acquired. It is increasingly used for measurements of 

agricultural crop condition and also for plant-soil interactions. It is known that 

reflectance signal is sensitive to abiotic changes, but concerning biotic changes, 

there are still several limitations. 

Therefore, was conducted a 9 weeks greenhouse bioassay with two 

different crops, Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and Corn (Zea mays), three different 

types of soil management and six different treatments were applied. The 

treatments applied were: the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, the nematode 

Pratylenchus penetrans, the Gamma radiation, the nutrients, the R. solani with 



v 

 

nutrients and a control treatment. The types of management were the Biologic, 

the Artificial Fertilizer and the Manure. In total were 3650 plants. 

Spectral reflectance data were collected with an ASD Fieldspec 3 

spectrometer with an ASD plant-probe and leaf-clip device attached. One of 

the objectives of the measurement was to monitor the differences between leaf 

reflectance over time. The spectral data was analyzed using vegetation indices. 

The effects of soil biota were analyzed in a multivariate ANOVA analysis with 

plant species, soil regime and soil treatment.  

The total biomass of the pathogens increase with a more intensive 

agriculture and shoot biomass in both plant species increased with disposal of 

the nutrient supply in the Biologic soil. The application of manure compost that is 

rich in nitrogen may have reduced soil-borne diseases. The lowest biomass was 

found in the sterilized treatments suggesting that the soil biota has influenced 

the plant performance. The best soil management had positive effect in growth 

of the plants. Disease suppression can be influenced by management practices. 

It was demonstrated that plant spectral signatures changes due induced stress 

and soil type. The best soil regime overall in this study case was considered the 

Biologic type. 

 

Key words: Soil biodiversity; Sustainable management; Hyperspectral 

reflectance; Plant-soil interactions.

O solo e a sua biodiversidade são o motor de todos os sistemas de 

produção terrestres e serviços de ecossistemas. A mudança na produção 

agrícola de extensiva para intensiva tem um efeito negativo profundo nos solos 

e na sua biodiversidade. A perda de biodiversidade resulta em comunidades 

do solo menos complexas. Com o aumento da procura dos serviços dos 

ecossistemas, como o solo, existe a necessidade da melhoria da gestão dos 

solos e das produções agrícolas. Esta melhoria pode trazer vantagens a nível do 

desenvolvimento de práticas mais sustentáveis que contribuem para um 

desenvolvimento económico sustentável. A gestão sustentável de qualquer 

ecossistema requer, entre outras informações, uma compreensão completa da 

interação solo-planta para tentar descrever padrões naturais. 

As plantas produzem substância orgânica através da fotossíntese. A 

fotosíntese depende da absorção de luz pelos pigmentos fotossintéticos 

presentes na folha. Portanto, as propriedades óticas da folha são influenciadas 

pela concentração dos pigmentos fotossintéticos e metabolitos, do seu teor em 

água e da estrutura e anatomia da folha.  

A reflectância hiperspectral tem ganho importância comercial e 

científica, contudo, permanece ainda subdesenvolvida apesar do seu 

potencial. A deteção remota da vegetação é uma boa ferramenta, pois pode 

extrapolar escalas de tempo, e é cada vez mais utilizada para perceber 

interações planta-solo. Sabe-se que o sinal de reflectância é sensível a 

mudanças abióticas e bióticas, mas ainda há um longo caminho a percorrer.  

Consequentemente, foi realizado durante nove semanas um bioensaio 

com duas culturas diferentes, a Beterraba (Beta vulgaris) e o Milho (Zea mays). 

Foram plantadas em três diferentes tipos de gestão do solo e aplicados seis 

tipos de tratamentos. Os tratamentos aplicados foram: o fungo Rhizoctonia 

solani, o nemátode Pratylenchus penetrans, a radiação gama, os nutrientes, e 



vii 

 

o fungo R. solani  com nutrientes e um controlo. Os tipos de gestão que foram 

aplicados foram o solo Biológico, os fertilizantes artificiais e Fertelizantes 

orgânicos. No total foram consideradas 3650 plantas. 

Os dados da refletância espetral foram obtidos com um espectrómetro 

de campo ASD plant-probe e clip-foliar. Um objetivo deste estudo consistiu em 

monitorizar a refletância espetral das folhas das duas espécies durante o 

período experimental. Os dados espetrais foram analisados utilizando índices 

de vegetação. Os efeitos do biota do solo foram analizados numa análise 

multivariada ANOVA com os fatores, espécie de planta, tipos de solo e 

tratamentos. 

A biomassa total de patogénicos tende a aumentar quanto mais 

intensiva for a prática agricola. No solo Biológico observou-se uma 

intensificação da cor verde da planta nas duas espécies, com o aumento da 

disponibilidade de nutrientes. A adição de fertelizante pode ter influenciado a 

resistência das plantas às doenças do solo. A menor biomassa foi encontrada 

no tratamento com radiação gama (estéril), sugerindo que o biota do solo 

influenciou o desempenho da planta. O melhor tipo de gestão do solo teve um 

efeito positivo no crescimento das plantas. As melhores práticas agricolas 

permitem uma supressão das doenças inoculadas. Foi demonstrado que o 

espetro da planta difere quando é induzido stresse e também consoante o tipo 

de gestão do solo. A melhor gestão agrícola foi considerada a Biológica.

Soil and soil biodiversity are the motor of all the terrestrial production 

systems and ecosystem services (e.g. food, biofuel, drinking water, carbon 

storage and fibers). The intensification of agriculture production and shifts from 

extensive crop rotation have a profound negative effect on soils and their 

biodiversity (changing land use management) (Scherr and McNeely 2008; Hol 

and Hedlund 2010; Hedlund 2012). Biodiversity losses often result in a less 

complex soil community with frequently inhibited functions leading to a higher 

exposure to pathogens and natural enemies resulting in frequent disease 

outbreaks (Peterson et al. 1998; Folke et al. 2004; Garbeva et al. 2004; Neher 

2010). Soil organisms are mostly unseen but have a huge variety both in function 

and taxonomy. They interact in complex belowground foodwebs and feedback 

into above-ground plant performance as well (e.g. due to their feeding 

activities belowground)(Van der Putten et al. 2009; van Dam and Heil 2011). The 

increasing demand of soil ecosystem services implies improving soil 

management as a key opportunity for supporting sustainable economic 

development, prevent species loses and promote soil biodiversity (Tilman et al. 

2002; Zhang et al. 2007). Accurate knowledge of plant species distribution and 

foodweb interactions is a critical component for soil management and 

preservation of biodiversity (Brussaard et al. 2007; Tylianakis et al. 2008). Hence, 

the sustainable management of any ecosystem requires, amongst other 

information, a thorough understanding of plant-soil feedback to try to describe 

natural patterns and relations between the plants and their environment. It 

becomes, therefore, essential to improve our monitoring and management of 

soil quality and crop production. 

Remote sensing sensors are increasingly used for measurements of the 

agricultural crop condition or also for plant soil interactions (Schmidt and 

Skidmore 2003; Mutanga and Skidmore 2004; Beck et al. 2008; Knox et al. 2010;

Ramoelo et al. 2011). It is known that reflectance signal is sensitive to abiotic 

changes (Wessman et al. 1988) but for the biotic changes there is a long way to 

go (Carvalho et al. 2012). In this way this technology can also provide an 

automatic and objective alternative to visual disease assessment of plant 

diseases (Hillnhütter and Mahlein 2008; Mahlein et al. 2012). However,  leaf 

optical properties are influenced by the concentration of the photosynthetic 

pigments, biochemicals, water content and leaf structure (de Boer 1993), which 

are themselves, influence by soil biotic communities and pathogens (Bever et al. 

1997; Hedlund et al. 2003; Wardle et al. 2004; de Vries and Bardgett 2012) as 

each stress can elicit cellular and molecular changes (Herms and Mattson 1992). 

Remote sensing is the major source of spatial information of the earth’s surface 

cover from the local region to the globe (Graetz 1990). Hyperspectral remote 

sensing has gained scientific and commercial importance but still remains 

underdeveloped (Schmidt and Skidmore 2003) despite its potential (Myers et al. 

1970; Thenkabail et al. 2000; Hillnhütter et al. 2011). In this thesis we aim at the 

study of these changes, using spectral data in a non-destructive method that 

has the potential to be use in soil management and to monitor crop production 

in future approaches for precision agriculture.

Soil biodiversity is defined as the variety of life found in soil, such as 

invertebrates and microorganisms, soil flora, mammals, birds, reptiles and 

amphibians. Soil communities are among the most species-rich areas in 

terrestrial ecosystems (Giller et al. 1997; Bardgett 2005; Brussaard et al. 2007). 

Most of the organisms inhabiting soil ecosystems are found within the top 10 cm 

of the soil profile, and there are many abiotic and biotic factors that influence 

this diversity (Connell 1961; Wall and Moore 1999; Wardle et al. 2004). Some 

known abiotic factors are the soil structure, soil texture, organic matter while 



|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |

main biotic factors are the interactions between organisms, their pathogens and 

symbionts. 

Soil texture, organic matter and structure highly influence the biodiversity 

of plants and animals living on the soil. Soil texture is defined by the proportion of 

sand, silt and clay particles bound together by organic matter (Parton et al. 

1987; Bronick and Lal 2005). The percentage of organic matter found in soil has 

a large influence on the adjacent biodiversity as it impacts soil fertility, soil 

structure, workability and water holding capacity (Doran et al. 1996; Weil and 

Magdoff 2004). Soil biota has the function to degrade organic matter which will 

be fixed by primary producers and the cycle of nutrients will flow (organic 

matter is processed and the nutrients will be release into the environment 

becoming available again for the primary producers)(Witkamp 1971; Lavelle 

and Berhe 2005). While degrading organic matter soil microbial biota activity 

produces and consumes gases - carbon dioxide, methane, among others. - and 

sequestrates carbon into the soil maintaining the physical properties of the soil 

(Linn and Doran 1984; Lal 2004). Soil structure affects the stability of soil and its 

resistance to degradation under pressure. Resistance is defined as the capacity 

of a system to continue to function without change through a disturbance 

(Pimm 1984; Peterson et al. 1998; Folke et al. 2004; Garbeva et al. 2004). Another 

 Figure 1 Graphical and mathematical description of resistance and resilience (Herrick and Wander 1998).

important of soil is resilience, defined as  the recovery of the functional integrity 

of a system following a disturbance (Pimm 1984) or catastrophic disturbance 

(Holling and Meffe 1996) relative to its original state (Fig. 1). Structure is 

influenced by texture, organic matter, compaction and biological activities. 

In its biotic conditions, soil communities have the invertebrates and 

microorganisms as the majority of their biomass (Anderson et al. 1977; Ghilarov 

1977; Allen et al. 1979; Pimentel et al. 1980) . These include bacteria, fungi, 

protozoa, nematodes, mites, collembola, oligochaetes (earthworms), myriapods 

(millipedes and centipedes), mollusks and insects (ants, termites, beetles). Soil 

biodiversity communities are more resistant to changes in surrounding biotic and 

abiotic conditions (Elliott and Lynch 1994) as redundancy in an ecosystem is 

high. High redundancy allows one species to substitute another, such that 

functions are continuously achieved, even with the loss of one species (Mouillot 

et al. 2013). With increased redundancy, soil ecosystems also have higher 

resistance to disturbances and are resilient to subsequent disturbances. As such, 

the diversity of species found in soil communities impact soil quality and 

functioning, providing essential services in the stability of the abiotic 

components of the soil. 

In fact soil biodiversity is increasingly proposed as an integrative indicator 

of soil environmental quality, food security and economic viability, and it can be 

an ideal indicator of sustainable land management (Parr et al. 1992; Carter 

2002; Brussaard et al. 2007). In this thesis was considered the definition of 

sustainable management as “The capacity of a specific kind of soil to function 

within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain biological 

productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and animal

Plant disease development is a 

dynamic process involving living entities 

(the plant host and the pathogen) and 

the environment (biotic and abiotic 

components) with high impact in 

agriculture. The interaction between (a) 

biotic factors in the soil can cause a 

disease to break-out. This interaction can 

be summarized in the “disease triangle” 

concept (Stevenson 1960) (Fig. 2). 

Pathogens are the biological agents causing disease or illness in the host. 

The soil borne pathogens can be defined as the pathogens that cause diseases 

via inoculum (biological object, spore, mycelium, cells) that comes to the plant 

via the soil (Koike et al. 2003). The most common symptom of soil borne 

pathogens in plants is root rots that affect belowground tissues and vascular wilts 

initiated through root infection (Grau et al. 2004). Sometimes presence of a 

pathogen can be visible (mycelial growth, nematode cysts), or while, in other 

situations, there are just symptoms visible but not the pathogen itself (root decay, 

crowns rot, wilting foliage). So the manifestation of the symptoms caused by the 

pathogen is the disease (Campbell and Madden 1990; Blok et al. 2000; Bailey 

and Lazarovits 2003). Soil biodiversity performs a number of vital functions that 

regulate the soil ecosystem, including decomposition of litter and cycling of 

nutrients such as nitrogen, carbon, among others (Coleman et al. 1993). These 

renewal processes and ecosystem services are mainly biological, thus, their 

persistence depends upon maintenance of biological diversity (Altieri 1999). The 

same biodiversity soil may generate “pathogen suppressive” conditions and 

greater resistance to invasion. Pathogen control is another key ecosystem 

service underpinned by biodiversity (Cardinale et al. 2012); it is greatly

determined by the abundance of natural enemies of the pathogen species 

involved. Improved pest control is dependent on a diversity of natural enemies 

of pests, and non-crop habitats are often fundamental for the presence and 

survival of these biological control agents (predators, parasitoids)(Zhang et al. 

2007).  

There is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers protection against 

soil-borne diseases, despite crop, soil type and management also playing a role 

(Brussaard et al. 2007). Therefore, natural pest regulation is considered an 

important service of biodiversity (Altieri 1999; Schläpfer and Schmid 1999; Wilby 

and Thomas 2002b, a; Fiedler et al. 2008). Soil borne plant pathogens can 

significantly reduce yield and quality in vegetable crops (Abawi and Widmer 

2000). These pathogens are particularly challenging because they often survive 

in soil for many years and each crop may be susceptible to several species. 

Infections occurring at the same time from multiple soil-borne pathogens can 

result in a complex disease that can further damage the crop. Almost all soil-

borne pathogens are difficult to predict, to detect and to diagnose (Koike et al. 

2003). The soil environment is extremely complex, making it more difficult to 

understand the interaction between soil and diseases caused by this soil-borne 

pathogens (Garbeva et al. 2004). They can broadly be divided into soil 

inhabitants, the one able to survive in soil for a relatively long time and soil 

invaders those who are able to survive in the soil but for a short time. Many of 

these pathogens can also live in the soil as non-pathogenic under certain 

conditions (Chapter 6 – 6.1- Major soil pathogens).

Crop stress can be related to living factors (biotic) as diseases, predators, 

competition, insects’ outbreaks, fungi, bacteria, and nematodes. Or they can 

be related to nonliving factors (abiotic) that including changes in pH, 02 

availability, rainfall, light intensity, soil properties, among others. Disturbances 

often break the normal function of the system causing dynamic growth patterns 

and different patches on habitat level (Hooper et al. 2000; Van der Putten et al. 

2001). In natural systems the plant community reorganization after stress or 

disturbance can take a long time to stabilize and is dependent of spatial 

heterogeneity or dispersal rates. Usually we refer to “disturbance” as a short term 

event (Tobor?Kap?on et al. 2006) and the equilibrium state can be reached 

similar to the one before. When a factor of disturbance persists is called “stress”. 

If the plant populations are capable to handle this kind of stress, the equilibrium 

reached might be different from the original one, because of the presence of 

the stress factor, that continuously affect the energy budget of the organisms. In 

agriculture, the soil biodiversity is reduced, most likely due to frequent 

disturbance, and stability may depend on management regime. Organically 

managed soil usually is more stable than the intensively managed soil (Grayston 

et al. 2001; Griffiths et al. 2001) and also depends on the type of stress, 

disturbance or the combination of these factors. Therefore, and even though 

resistance against outbreaks or stress of pests, diseases and resilience from 

disturbance is of particular importance in agriculture, still a lot of these processes 

are unknown (Brussaard et al. 2007). A soil is considered suppressive when, in 

spite of other favorable condition for the disease, it does not establish or persist 

with little to no damage to crop yield (Baker and Cook 1974; Janvier et al. 2007). 

In contrast, conductive (non-suppressive) soils are prone to disease. Soil 

supressiveness is related to fertility level and nature of the soil itself, as well as its 

microbiological community activity. The better the abiotic conditions and more

biodiversity a soil is the more suppressive it can be (Cook and Baker 1983; 

Garbeva et al. 2004). Supressiveness has been further defined into general 

supressiveness and specific supressiveness. General suppression is the result of 

high total microbial biomass and biodiversity which creates unfavorable 

conditions to the development of plant diseases. Specific suppression, on the 

other hand, is due to the effects of individual or selected groups of 

microorganisms during particular stages of the pathogen life cycle (Cook and 

Baker 1983). 

In agriculture, different type of management can have different effects 

on disease rate, as mentioned before. These effects can be positive or negative 

depending on the mechanisms (Litterick et al. 2004; Bonanomi et al. 2007; 

Bonanomi et al. 2010) which can involve toxic substances, promoting mutualism, 

plant chemistry defences , among others (Van der Putten et al. 2001). The 

importance of soil biodiversity in crop systems is still little understood, but a study 

in semi-natural systems has shown that biodiversity promote healthier crops (Van 

der Putten and Van der Stoel 1998). But threats to soil biodiversity can alter soil 

community structure and internal food web interactions, resulting in damaging 

impacts on the ecosystem’s self-regulation properties and favours pests and 

diseases. Biological pest control promotes primary production, what will bring 

more efficiency to the system and healthier crops (Altieri 2002; Turbé et al. 2010). 

Particular types of weeds, for example, can harbour and support 

beneficial arthropods species capable to fight pest populations (Boatman 1994). 

In general, the more diverse and stable the agro-system, the more stable the 

insect community. A diverse agro-ecosystem has a balance that hinders the 

development of pests and invasive species, as the species present cover all the 

available ecological niches and the resources available in an optimal way. Thus, 

keeping a high bio-diverse ecosystem is an important part for a good defensive 

strategy of agricultural management at least for generalist pest species.

Integrated management of soil biota, biodiversity and agricultural 

ecosystems is a holistic process that relies largely on locally available resources, 

climate, and socioeconomic conditions. Above all, the direct involvement of 

farmers and stakeholders is a key to identify and adapt management practices 

to their specific context. So, the conservation of the biodiversity, the 

development of farming systems with greater reliance on ecosystem services 

should increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems (McLaughlin and Mineau 

1995; Pretty 1995; Altieri 1999; Robertson and Swinton 2005; Young et al. 2005; 

Klein et al. 2007).

During the last decades the intensification and specialization of crop 

production has been a major trend in agricultural systems. To this is associated 

an increased use of fossil fuel energy due to the intensive use of agrochemicals 

(fertilizers and pesticides), mechanization and irrigation. As a consequence of 

intensification and specialization, there has been an increase in soil erosion rates, 

a decrease in soil organic matter content and associated losses of soil structure 

and water holding capacity (Matson et al. 1997; Cassman 1999). The pest and 

crop disease problems have increased, while soil biodiversity reduces and an 

increase in vulnerability to climate change and related extreme disturbances is 

expected (Dogliotti 2003; Altieri and Toledo 2011; Reich et al. 2012). According 

to Millennium Ecosystem Assessment many farming systems have a high 

dependence on fossil energy and suffer from the deterioration of their 

ecosystem services (Provisioning services, Regulating services, Cultural services, 

Supporting services). So it is urgent to improve systems by optimizing the use of 

water and energy including the internal ecological cycles to achieve long term 

sustainability goals (Altieri et al. 2012).

Sustainable agricultural systems depend on the maintenance of the soil health 

(a soil to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality and 

promote plant and animal health) (Doran and Zeiss 2000). A healthy soil has the 

capacity to provide resistance to external stresses, for example, the suppression 

of disease spread can be seen as a manifestation of soil health, (Van Bruggen 

and Semenov 2000; Berkelmans et al. 2003; Schmidt and Skidmore 2003). 

However, it should be taken into account that for different types of soils different 

kinds of agricultural management systems are probably needed in order to 

improve or maintain soil health (Abawi and Widmer 2000)(fig. 3). A general 

measure of soil quality and health is organic matter content. The soil organic 

matter is generally known to reduce the incidence and severity of soil borne 

disease in crop systems by inducing its suppression (Baker and Cook 1974). 

Numerous cultural practices like cropping sequences, green manures, cover 

crops, mulches, composts and animal manures affect soil organic matter and 

consequently pathogens. The incorporation of compost (Lewis et al. 1992; 

Hoitink and Boehm 1999; Darby et al. 2006), crop residues and biological soil 

disinfestation (Blok et al. 2000; Gamliel et al. 2000) is commonly reported to

reduce soil-borne diseases. Yet monitoring large scale intensified crop systems is 

challenging. For this reason, remote sensing is a great tool to understand this 

dynamic above-below ground interaction. It has been showed that when plants 

are exposed to different stress or disturbance factors have intra-specific plant 

chemical variation. These differences can be analysed by the plant canopy 

when plant is expose, and also can be linked with soil fertility (Wessman et al. 

1988; Ferwerda et al. 2005; Knox et al. 2010; Skidmore et al. 2010; Asner and 

Martin 2011; Carvalho 2013). Certain chemicals compounds can be associated 

with certain stresses and by hyperspectral reflectance this can be measured 

(Curran 1989). It means that soil organism can influence plant responses 

aboveground through chemicals changes (Kostenko et al. 2012; Carvalho 2013) 

and this changes can been seen through spectral reflectance patterns. 

Furthermore, it is known that abiotic changes can also be recognized by 

spectral measurements (Wessman et al. 1988; Asner and Martin 2011).

The spectral properties can be defined as a response of the material to a 

sinusoidal component (waves) which can vary in frequency (Gates et al. 1965). 

Spectroscopy is the part of physics concerned with the production, transmission, 

measurement and interpretation of electromagnetic spectra. All types of 

materials have a specific radiation that can be reflected, transmitted or 

absorbed. This interaction is dependent on the materials’ constitution and its 

physical properties (Suits 1983). Reflectance is a common measurement in 

spectral sensors. Reflectance is defined as the ratio of the amount of 

electromagnetic radiation reflected from a surface to the amount originally 

striking the surface. Any illuminated surface reflects and the most important 

characteristic is its independence from the amount of the radiation reaching 

the surface of the material(Monteith and Unsworth 2013). The reflectance

spectra is however sensitive to specific chemical bonds present in the materials 

(Colwell 1983). It has the potential to detect the presence or absence of certain 

compounds, such as nitrogen, chlorophyll ,among others (Ollinger et al. 2008). 

Many spectral vegetation indices (SVI´s), have the potential of monitoring 

biomass, phenology and physiological conditions of the plants (Peñuelas and 

Filella 1998). 

The potential yield of agricultural and horticultural crops worldwide is 

affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic stress factors. These factors can play 

a role in plant chemical dynamics through time. Spectroscopy can measure 

these chemical or physical properties in a non-destructive method (West et al. 

2010). The plant interaction with biotic and abiotic factors has also been 

reported in spectral measurements (Jackson 1986; Graetz 1990), since the 

biophysical to the biochemical plants change (Mahlein et al. 2012). The 

spectroscopy and other new technology are a great tool to develop new 

techniques in sustainable agriculture management. The new technology can 

prevent losses between 18 to 32% caused by pests, excluding also the losses 

because of the fungi, bacteria and viruses (Oerke and Dehne 2004).  

The occurrence of diseases in plant growth (even more in early stages) in 

the field is heterogeneous in time and space (Waggoner and Aylor 2000). 

However, traditional agricultural management considers the crop field as a 

homogeneous site, so most of the times the input of nutrients or pesticides don’t 

fit the dynamic demand (Steiner et al. 2008). This will have an impact on soil 

health and in the economic value of crops. Therefore remote sensing 

techniques could be a reliable technique for accurate estimate of diseases, 

predict yield loss, monitor and forecast epidemics and understand biological 

processes. 

The use of such innovative technologies in agriculture has been 

summarized as “precision agriculture” where the main focus is to optimize the 

agricultural production of crops, reducing damage and waste into the

environment. This concept takes spatial and temporal variability within the field 

into account, instead of the traditional management based on a hypothetical 

average (Pierce and Nowak 1999). The site specific management is expected 

to change the yield and the quality of the production, lead to a better use of 

the resources, while preserving the quality and the quantity of the agricultural 

soils and products (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010). A recent example is 

reported by (Mahlein et al. 2013) as they develop specific spectral indices (SDIs) 

for the detection of diseases in crops in order to improve disease detection, 

identification and monitoring in agricultural systems. The potential of the remote 

sensing techniques for agricultural purpose has been showed several times, 

especially in fungal diseases (Thenkabail et al. 2000; Steddom et al. 2005; 

Hillnhütter and Mahlein 2008; Galvão et al. 2009; Oppelt, 2004 ; Hillnhütter et al. 

2011). The precise disease control is a demanding challenge within precision 

agriculture but can offer a good prospective to decrease the costs of fungicide 

use and its environmental impact (Steddom et al. 2005; Hillnhütter and Mahlein 

2008; Bock et al. 2010; Nutter Jr et al. 2010). In this I will study the difference 

between the biotic and abiotic factors influencing disease attack on crops 

using spectral data.

1.7.1 General objective 

 

Abiotic stress factors such as heat, cold, drought, salinity, and nutrient 

stress have a big impact on world agriculture, and it has been suggested that 

they reduce average yields by more than 50% for most major crop plants 

(Hammond-Kosack and Jones 2000). Furthermore, plants must defend 

themselves from attack by a vast range of pests and pathogens, including fungi, 

bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and herbivorous insects (Herms and Mattson 1992). 

Since each stress can elicit plant cellular and molecular changes (de Boer 1993), 

leaf optical properties are influenced by the concentration of the biochemicals, 

water content and leaf structure (Gueymard 2004). 

In this thesis we will try to study above-below ground interactions through 

plant spectral reflectance and this potential to be applied in different 

agricultural regimes, aiming to improve crop monitorization and management in 

future approaches for precision agriculture. 

 

1.7.2 Specific objectives 

 

? Determine the influence of 3 different soil regimes in the plant growth and 

their spectral patterns; 

? Test greenhouse spectroscopy to estimate plant and soil properties via the 

plant spectral signatures; 

? Study the temporal evolution of crops using spectral pattern changes.

2.2.1 Plant (crop) species 

The Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and Corn (Zea mays) 

 

Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris var. altissima Döll) belongs to the 

family Chenopodiaceae (OECD) and it is a typically biannual plant. The tuber is 

the storage organ of the sugar beet plant, and the tuber is as large as 90% of 

the plant’s biomass, while the crown represents the rest of its biomass (Elliot and 

Weston 1993; Gonzalez Garcia et al. 2006). 

The tuber contains high concentration of sucrose and is mainly used for 

the sugar extraction, as well as for bio-ethanol and bio-gas production (?ezbová 

et al. 2013).  

Since the Napoleonic wars the sugar beet crop has had an upsurge in 

production in Europe and in the USA. Breeding increased the total content of 

sugar from 1.6 to 20 %, increasing the value of the sugar beet crop (FAO 2009a). 

However, the production and the price of sugar beet have recently decreased 

in the EU due to political decisions related to agricultural subsidies and due to 

strong competition with sugar from sugar cane. Today the EU, the USA and the 

Russian Federation are the biggest sugar beet producers with an overall 

harvested area of 1.5 million ha (FAO 2011), being an important crop in the 

Netherlands. Thus, 73000 ha were grown in 2013 in the Netherlands (Statistiek 

2014). 

Corn (Zea mays L.) derives its name from the Arawak mahizi which literally 

means ‘that which sustains life’ (MacCann 2001). Zea mays is an annual grass of 

the Poaceae family.  

One main difference between corn and other cereals is that it tolerates 

seed heads, ears that are larger than any other grass. Corn has a higher yield of 

food per unit than any other grain, being this productivity is one of the main

contributing factors of corn’s appeal to farmers. Corn is generally cultivated 

throughout the world, occupying 159 million ha, with a yield of over 5 ton/ha 

(FAO 2009b),but the US produces 40% of the total world’s harvest that in 2009 

was 817 million tones. 

Sugar beet and maize are frequently grown in the same crop rotation. The 

proportion of cultivated maize in several European sugar beet growing areas is 

expected to rise due to a projected increase in demand for renewable 

resources over the next few years (Kluth and Varrelmann 2010).  

 

2.2.2 Soil pathogens 

 

As soil pathogen attack treatment we will use two of the most common 

soil pathogens that affect crops: the fungus Rhizoctonia solani (Kühn, 1858) and 

the nematode Pratylenchus penetrans (Cobb, 1917).  

Rhizoctonia solani is a very common, soil-borne fungal pathogen of crops 

grown throughout the world and it has a great diversity of host plants. It’s a 

complex fungus composed of genetically isolated populations called 

anastomosis groups (Ogoshi 1987). In this experiment we will use AG 2-2IIIB  

which causes root and crown root in sugar beet and root rot in Corn (Sumner 

and Bell 1982) .  

It is estimated that Pratylenchus causes 77 billion dollars of damage 

worldwide each year as they are migratory endoparasites responsible for root 

lesion. The usual sign of disease is plant root necrosis (Abawi and Widmer 2000), 

but they can also introduce more pathogens as secondary infections (Perry and 

Moens 2006). Both diseases are difficult to monitor by farmer due to their main 

effects being belowground.

Vredepeel is located in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands (51°32’N, 

5°52’E)(van der Linden and van der Pas 1998). It is part of the Applied Plant 

Research facilities as a field station for long-term experimental farming. Long-

term agricultural experiments are essential to provide empirical data necessary 

to evaluate sustainability of agricultural systems (Geng et al. 1990; Barnett et al. 

1995). This field station is used to conduct research into arable farming, 

multifunctional agriculture and field production of vegetables.  

The soil has been classified as a mesic Typic Haplaquod (De Bakker 1979) 

and it consists of 30 cm dark colored sandy topsoil overlying non-calcareous 

Aeolian sand. The organic matter content of the top of the soil is approximately 

4.8%, and the underlying sand around 0.2%. The clay content of the soil is less 

than 3% (Ritsema et al. 1998). 

This location had been chosen because it is a long term experiment with 

different kinds of soil management (Biologic treatment, artificial fertilizer 

treatment, and manure treatment) (Tab. 1). The soil has been part of a 25-year 

organic amendment trial. The annual amendment treatments were either 25 

ton/ha manure, 50 ton/ha composted municipal organic waste, or a control 

which received mineral fertilizer (300 kg ha-1 KAS) and no organic matter (OM), 

to see more about the field site see (Korthals et al. 2014). The Biologic, Artificial 

Fertilize and Manure type of soil had respectively 4.56%, 4.05% and 3.98% of OM 

in the beginning of the experiment (Tab. 1)(Bin 2014). 

Soil was collected on 25th September 2013. In each soil treatment we 

made two parallel transects with one meter of distance from each other. From 

each treatment approximately 190 kg of soil were collected in 12 kg sterile 

plastic bags.

Each sampled bag was collected at a distance of 20 steps between 

each sample to approximately 15 cm depth. All soils were sieved with a 5mm 

mesh size to homogenize any spatial variation without obliteration of the soils 

‘biotic characteristics’ (FAO 2011; Carvalho et al. 2012). Afterwards each soil 

was divided into bags of 2.75 kg to standardize the amount of soil to put in each 

pot and stored at 4oC.

2.4.1 Treatments setup 

 

It has been shown in several studies that greenhouse bioassay results 

correlate well with field responses (Chaerle et al. 2004; Hillnhütter et al. 2010). 

Therefore, we conducted a bioassay to measure the effect of different kind of 

soil pathogens in sugar beet and corn and monitor the stage of the plant 

through time. 

The pots were rectangular (80cm x 8cm, 3cm high) and they were 

separated with a metal bar to have two sides, they were filled with 2, 75 kg of

soil each side with an initial moisture content of ± 20% (v/w). A row of 25 sterilized 

seeds were sown 1, 5 cm apart and 0.5 cm deep (for sugar beet) or 1 cm deep 

(for corn). Over 9 weeks all plants were growing in a greenhouse under 24-22°C 

with a 16h photoperiod and 80% relative humidity (Mendes et al. 2011). The 

plants were watered weekly with demineralized water and 2 times during the 

experiment with standard Hoagland solution (macronutrients only)(Mendes et al. 

2011). All pots were maintained at a soil water hold capacity (WHC) of 60%. To 

minimize spatial variance, the pots were ordered using a completely 

randomized design, which was re-randomized after four weeks. In order to 

mend observed nutrient deficiencies in the crop plants, 20 mmol NH4NO3 and 13 

mmol KH2PO4 were added per pot in two application steps (on 28 October and 

3 November), using 50 ml of a 200 mM NH4NO3 and 130 mM KH2PO4 solution per 

application step. On 25 November 2012, 54 days after the planting of the sugar 

beet seeds and corn seeds, the experiment was terminated by harvesting the 

plant, and the biomass was calculated after drying all the plants at 70°C for two 

days. 

The experiment setup consisted of two plant species × seven soil treatments 

(X – Control, R – Rhizoctonia, P – Pratylenchus, N – Nutrients, G – Gamma-

radiation, E – Empty, NR – Rhizothonia+Nutrients). 

? X - Field soil with plants but no treatments; 

? R - Field soil with plants and Rhizoctonia solani AG2.IIIB inoculated; 

? P - Field soil with plants and Pratylenchus penetrans inoculated; 

? N - Field soil with plants with Nutrients added (WHC realized with Hoagland 

solution during planting); 

? G - Gamma radiated soil with plant + Rhizoctonia (60 kGray, Isotron, The 

Netherlands); 

? E - Field soil without plants; 

? NR - Field soil with plants, nutrient treatment + R. solani;

Of the treatments X, R, P, N and NR, there were 5 replicates and 3 replicates 

for E, G and L. In total resulted in 146 pots with 25 plants in each bioassay in a

Rhizoctonia solani 

Introduction of the fungi into the pots 

 

After 10 days of the seedling growth, the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia 

solani (anastomosis group AG2-2IIIB) was placed just underneath the soil surface 

1 cm from the first seedling, with the mycelial side towards to the plant. The 

culture was introduced in an agar plug of 5 mm of a one week-old potato 

dextrose agar (PDA). The spread of R. solani was evaluated at regular time 

intervals by scoring the distance between the inoculum and the most distal 

plant suffering from damping-off.  

 

Pratylenchus penetrans 

Pratylenchus  

Introduction of the nematodes into the pots 

 

The nematodes were introduced 7 days after sowing the seeds, after 

watering each pot. They were inoculated at the base of the first plant in a whole 

0.5 cm deep, 0.5 cm wide. We introduced 18000 individuals of P. penetrans in a 

500 ml solution and we introduced them using a 5 ml pipet into the whole (5 ml 

a 180 ind/ml). We made the same procedure for the control plants, but used 

demineralized water instead of nematode solution.

2.6.1 Extraction of active nematodes from the soil, the Oostenbrink elutriator 

method  

(Oostenbrink 1960; Verschoor B.C. and R.G.M. 2000; BÜTtner et al. 2004; Knapp-Lawitzke 

et al. 2014; Korthals et al. 2014) 

 

This equipment has been developed for an efficient and consistent 

recovery of active nematodes from soil. This method is used in many laboratories 

and is suitable for samples from 100 - 1000 ml. The separation of nematodes and 

soil particles is achieved in 3 steps and is based on the weight, the shape and 

the activity of the nematode. 

We separate 4 samples from each type of soil with 100 ml each in total 12 

glass jars. We start to fill the elutriator with clean water to the outlet of the funnel 

pipe. When is full we open the constant upward water stream which enters the 

base of the elutriator through a perforated pipe (flow set 1000 ml/min). We 

placed the moist soil sample in the top sieve and washed it into the elutriator via 

the funnel with the baffle plate until 2/3 of the column is filled up. We turned off 

the top nozzle and reduce the upward stream of water to 6000 ml/min, in order 

to fill at a constant water stream. As such the heavier particles in the suspension 

settle, the nematodes, the particles of the same weight and lighter float. After

Afterwards  cm, 0.385 mm

in a shallow tray filled containing around 100 ml of tap water. One day later we 

removed the sieve with the filters from the extraction dish and the final 

suspension was store in the 4 °C fridge for analyzes.

2.6.2 Cold Staining of root material 

 (OECD) 

  

Staining simplifies microscopic detection of nematode root infections and 

we will use this technique in order to count the root parasitic nematodes. This 

method is commonly used maintaining the condition of the nematodes 

extracted from the roots  good to identify at high magnification (FAO 2009a). 

After we carefully washed the root material with water we cut off a small 

part of the root of Sugar beet and Corn from the nematode infected and the 

control treatments. In a fume hood we inserted the small roots with forceps in a 

lacto phenol solution and stored in a cold chamber at 4 ºC for two months. The 

nematodes will stain blue while the plant tissue will not be colored. After two 

months we wash off the excess stain with water and the root material was 

transferred to pure lactophenol, afterwards in order to observe them under the 

microscope the rots were transferred to a petri dish filed with glycerin/water 1:1 

for more information about the protocol see (Van Bezooijen 2006).

Spectral reflectance data were collected with an ASD Fieldspec 3 

spectrometer with an ASD plant-probe and leaf-clip device attached (ASD Inc., 

Boulder CO, USA). The instrument has a spectral range between 350 and 2500 

nm with 3 nm spectral resolution in the 350 nm – 1000 nm and 10 nm between 

1000 nm and 2500 nm wavelengths. The plant-probe was designed for non-

destructive data collection from live plants using a heat sensitive halogen light 

bulb (color and temperature 2901 ±10º% K). It has a spectral measurement spot 

size of 10 mm radius. The leaf clip has a gentle gripping system designed to hold 

the sample in place without inflicting damage or removing the sample. Since

we were interested in reflectance measurements the black panel background 

of the leaf-clip was used in each measurement (Carvalho 2013). 

One of the objectives of the measurement was to monitor the differences 

between leaf reflectance over time, so we had chosen for corn 10 out 25 plants 

per pot to measure (plants 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21). To monitor the 

differences overtime in the Corn leaves through spectral reflectance we collect 

data 5 times during the experiment (10/10/2013 - 17/10/2013 – 25/10/2013 - 

30/10/2013 - 08/11/2013). For each point of time we got 625 measurements. 

For Sugar beet the measurements were different as the seedlings were too 

small to measure the leaves in the first weeks. As such we measure only 2 time 

points during the experiment (05/11/2013 – 14/11/2013) trying to follow the same 

sequence of plant has we did with Corn. 

 

2 . 8  S p e c t r a l  d a t a  p r o c e s s i n g  
 

All the spectral measurements were offset corrected with software 

ViewSpec Pro 5.6.10 (ASD Inc. Boulder, USA). The 350-359 nm spectral range was 

removed after visual inspection because they were highly noisy (MacCann 

2001). The spectral range used for all the analysis was equal for all leaf samples 

in order to ensure that the models and band selection could be compared 

within reflectance measurements.   

 

2 . 9  S p e c t r a l  d a t a  a n a l y s i s  
 

The spectral data was analyzed using vegetation indices. The indices 

were chosen according to the literature (Tab. S6). The indices for further 

discussion and analyzes were chosen with a PEARSON correlation test to avoid 

autocorrelation statistical issues, often found between indices (Tab. S7). Were 

selected the Normalized Vegetation index (NDVId) (Tucker 1979; Gamon et al.

the difference between the initial time of the experiment and the harvest time 

was calculated.

The effects of soil biota were analyzed in a multivariate ANOVA analysis 

with plant species (Zea mays, Beta vulgaris), soil regime (AF, B, M) and soil 

treatment (gamma radiation, nutrients, nutrients + R. solani , R. solani , Penetrans, 

control) as fixed factors. The normality test was analyzed.  Shoot dry weight and 

vegetation indices were used as dependent variable in the ANOVA for all the 

analysis. Post-hoc Tuckey tests were performed to analyze which groups were 

significantly different from each other. Pearson Correlation test between 

spectral indices was done to avoid autocorrelation statistical issues. The ANOVA 

analysis and Pearson correlation was performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for 

windows 8.

The studied parameters (soil, treatment and species) had a significant 

influence on the total plant biomass. The soil type (Tab. 2, P= 0. 003), species 

(Tab. 2, P&amp;lt;0. 001), and treatment (Tab. 2, P&amp;lt;0. 001), significantly influenced 

plant biomass, but, regarding interactions of the factors, the three-way 

interaction (soil*species*treatment), the soil*treatment did not result in a 

significant effect (Tab. 2, P&gt; 0. 05). On other hand, the treatment*species (Tab. 2, 

P&amp;lt;0. 001) interaction resulted in significant effects on the total average plant 

biomass (Tab. 2). The total biomass in the Corn was always higher than the sugar 

beet (Fig. 5).

Plants grown in Artificial fertilized (AF) soil were significantly smaller than 

plants from Manure (M) and the Biologic (B) type of soil, however there were no 

significant differences in the average total biomass between Manure and 

Biologic soils independently of the species studied (Fig. 5). In both plant species 

the fertilization treatment significantly increased shoot biomass when compared 

to the other treatments (Fig. 5, P&amp;lt;0. 001), however, in both species, Nutrients (N) 

and Nutrients + R. solani (NR) treatment did not have a significant difference 

between each other (Fig. 5, P&gt; 0. 05). In the Manure soil type, the total biomass 

of the Corn species was higher in the treatment P. penetrans (P), R. solani (R) 

and Control (X). In the same species in the treatment Gamma (G), Nutrients (N)

and Nutrients + R. solani (NR) in the Biologic soil type had a higher biomass than 

the other types of soil. The Artificial fertilizer type of soil had always a lower 

biomass when compared to others types of soils, with the exception in the R. 

solani treatment, where the lowest biomass was in the Biologic soil. In the Sugar 

beet the Gamma treatment the Manure type of soil had higher total biomass 

than the Biologic type of soil (Fig. 5). In the same species there was increment on 

total biomass in the Biologic type of soil when was added nutrients in the R. 

solani treatment. 

In both plant species shoot biomass was significantly affected by the 

different types of soil (Tab. 3, P= 0. 015) and different treatments (Tab. 3, P&amp;lt;0. 

001). No interaction was found between the plant species, type of soil and 

treatment was not significant (Tab. 3, P&gt; 0. 05). Manure type of soil had 

significant differences from the Artificial fertilizer (Fig. 6, P&amp;lt;0. 001) but not from 

the Biologic (Fig. 6, P&gt; 0. 05) in both plant species. There were no significant 

changes in shoot biomass between the treatments with P. penetrans, Gamma 

radiation, R. solani and Control (Fig. 6, P&amp;lt;0. 001). Significant differences were 

found between the P.penetrans treatment and Gamma radiation, Nutrients, 

and Nutrients + R. solani (Fig. 6, P&amp;lt;0. 05). In Corn, this difference resulted in less 

biomass in the Gamma treatment when compared to the Nutrients, Nutrients + R. 

solani and P. penetrans treatment. Furthermore, in the same species, the 

P.penetrans treatment had less biomass than Nutrients and Nutrients + R. solani 

in the Biologic soil type. In Corn species, the Control, R. solani , P. penetrans and 

Gamma treatment in Manure type of soil higher than in the other treatments 

was found, with the exception of Nutrients and Nutrients + R. solani   treatment, 

where the Biologic soil had higher shoot biomass (Fig. 6). The Artificial Fertilizer soil 

type had always lower shoot biomass than the other types of soil. The Control 

treatment had lower shoot biomass values when compared to disease 

treatments (R. solani and P. penetrans treatment) in the same species in the 

Manure type of soil. The Gamma treatment had the lowest shoot biomass in this

species (Fig. 6). In Sugar beet the significant differences are in the higher shoot 

biomass of the Nutrients + R. solani and Nutrients treatment both in the Biologic 

soil type (Fig. 6). As in Corn species, the Artificial Fertilizer type of soil had always 

the lowest shoot biomass (Fig. 6). The treatment Gamma, R. solani, and Control 

had no significant differences in this species. The shoot biomass was always 

higher than the roots biomass, independent of treatment or species (data not 

shown). In general the total biomass was higher in the first segment of the pot 

(Fig. 5). The highest shoot biomass was found in the Corn Biologic type of soil, 

which was 10 times larger if compared to Corn grown in the Manure soil type 

(Fig. 6). The highest root biomass was found in Corn species, R. solani treatment 

of the Manure soil type which was 30 times bigger than in the Artificial Fertilizer 

soil type in the Gamma treatment. The lowest root biomass was in R. solani 

treatment in Sugar beet species, in the Manure type of soil (data not shown).

In this analysis we focused in three Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVI´s) the 

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Plant Stress index (PSa) and 

the Modified Red Edge Position (mREP). All other indices were correlated with 

the three selected (Tab. S7).  

The soil factor was a significant factor influencing mREP (Tab. 4, P= 0. 01), 

while treatment factor influenced NDVIc (Tab. 4, P= 0. 02), mREP (Tab. 4, P= 0. 

001) and Psa (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001). Species were significantly different (P&amp;lt;0. 001). 

Indeed, the tested factors influenced all of the analyzed indices, with the 

exception of DSWI (Tab. 4). The interaction between factors also resulted in 

significant effects in the chosen indices. The three-way interaction 

(soil*species*treatment) did not influenced the SVI´s chosen (Tab. 4, P&gt; 0. 05), 

while two-way interactions had effect in the SVI´s chosen. The interaction 

between treatment and species resulted in significant effects in NDVId (Tab. 4, 

P&amp;lt;0. 001), MCARI (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001), mREP (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001) and Psa (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;

0. 001). The interaction of the soil factor with treatment and species influenced 

three of the analyzed indices. In the first case (soil*treatment), a significant 

higher effect was detected in NDVId (Tab. 4, P= 0. 003), while in the second 

case (soil*species) the affected indices were NDVId (Tab. 4, P= 0. 03), Psa (Tab. 4, 

P= 0. 05) and mREP (Tab. 4, P= 0. 04), with less effect in the Psa index.  

The Manure type of soil was significantly different from the Biologic and 

Artificial fertilizer (Fig. 7- a). In the Corn species the NDVI decreased in the 

Biologic comparing to the others soil types (Fig. 7- a), with less effect in the 

P.penetrans treatment. In the same species Gamma-radiation treatment there 

was a significant increase in the NDVI in the Artificial fertilizer soil (Fig. 7- a). The 

NDVI increased in the Manure type of soil in the treatment P. penetrans, R. 

solani , and Control and decreased in the Biologic type of soil (Fig. 7- a). In the 

Sugar beet species, the soil type with higher positive NDVI effect was the 

Manure in all the treatments and the Biologic soil was always lowest positive 

effect. Treatment wise Gamma had a significantly more NDVI effect while the 

less effect outcome was in the Biologic type of soil in the R. solani treatment.  

In the Plant Stress index (PSa) significant effect of species and treatment 

(Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001) were found. The Manure and the Biologic types of soil were 

significantly different from each other in both plant species with a significant 

increase of Psa in the Biologic type of soil (fig. 7- c, P&amp;lt;0. 001). In the Corn species 

the PSa was always higher in Biologic soil than in the other types of soil especially 

in the R. solani treatment (Fig. 7- c).  Treatment wise PSa was always higher in P. 

penetrans, R. solani and Control treatments than in the Gamma radiation 

treatment (Fig. 7- c). In both species Nutrients + R. solani treatment had a 

significant increase in Psa index in the Biologic type of soil. In the Control 

treatment and in the Pratylenchus treatment the positive trend in effect was 

from Biologic to Artificial fertilizer and to Manure types of soil. The lowest Psa 

effect in Corn species was in the Artificial fertilizer type of soil, especially in 

treatment Gamma (Fig. 7- c). In the Sugar beet species the lowest Psa effect

was found in the R. solani  treatment in the Manure type of soil and the highest 

Psa effect in Biologic soil in the same treatment (Fig. 7- c).Also in this species the 

Psa increased in  the Nutrients + R. solani  comparing to the R. solani  treatment. 

The analyses of the Modified Red Edge Position (mREP) index showed 

significant differences between species, soil types and treatments (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 

05). There was a highly significant interaction between treatment and species 

(Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001). In corn species Gamma treatment there was a significant 

increase in mREP from Biologic to Manure to Artificial fertilizer (Fig.7- b). There 

was a significant decrease in mREP in the P.penetrans treatment in Biologic soil 

type comparing to the other types of soil. The Control treatment and the 

diseases treatments (R. solani and P. penetrans) increase the mREP trend from 

Manure, to Artificial Fertilizer to Biologic type of soil. In the Sugar beet there was 

an increase the mREP effect in the Control treatment of the Manure soil type 

comparing to all the others treatments. And there was a decrease in mREP 

effect in the R. solani treatment of the Biologic soil comparing to the other 

treatments (Fig. 7- b). In the Gamma treatment mREP had a significant increase 

from Artificial Fertilizer to Biologic to Manure (Fig. 7- b). The treatment Control, R. 

solani and P. penetrans increase the mREP trend from Manure, to Artificial 

Fertilizer to Biologic type of soil. In the sugar beet species the mREP increased in 

the Nutrients treatment comparing with Nutrients + R. solani treatment (Fig. 7- b).

Species were significantly different in the NDVIs temporal analyzes (Tab. 4, 

P&amp;lt;0. 001). There was a two-way interaction between species*treatment, 

soil*treatment and species*soil (Tab. 4, P? 0. 003). The effect of treatment or type 

of soil alone was not significant (Tab. 4, P&gt; 0. 05).In Corn species the Gamma 

radiation treatment in the Artificial fertilizer soil the mean NDVI temporal 

difference was approximately null, while there was a positive NDVI temporal 

difference in the other two soil regimes. In the same species P.penetrans 

treatment showed an increase in NDVI temporal difference, especially in the 

Biologic soil, when compared to other treatments and soils (Fig. 8- a).  In the 

Corn species Biologic soil had a significant increase in NDVI temporal difference 

when compared to the other soils type (Fig. 8- a). The only exception was the R. 

solani treatment in the Artificial fertilizer soil which had a superior positive NDVI 

temporal difference (Fig. 8- a). While in Corn species the Nutrients + R. solani  

treatment, had always a positive NDVI temporal difference, in Sugar beet the 

NDVI temporal difference was always negative (Fig. 8- a). The Biologic type of 

soil showed the highest negative NDVI temporal difference in the R. solani 

treatment, the lowest negative NDVI temporal difference was in Gamma 

radiation treatment in Sugar beet species. In sugar beet, the lowest negative 

NDVI temporal difference was found in Manure type of soil (Fig. 8 – a). This 

temporal difference is especially notorious in Control and pathogen treatments. 

The NDVI temporal difference in the Artificial Fertilizer soil was lower in the 

Gamma treatment.  

The treatment (P&amp;lt;0. 001) and the species (P&amp;lt;0. 001) significantly 

influenced the temporal differences in the Psa index. Regarding the interaction 

of the factors, the tree-way interaction (soil*treatment*species) did not result in 

a significant effect (P &gt;0. 05), neither the interaction between treatment*soil

(Tab. 4, P &gt;0. 05). Thus, the two-way interaction species*soil (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 05) and 

treatment*species (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001) did result in an effect in the temporal 

differences. There was no significant effect of soil type into PSa temporal 

differences (Tab. 4, P&gt; 0. 05). In the Corn species the temporal differences were 

always in the negative range with the higher Psa negative temporal difference 

in the Gamma radiation treatment and lower Psa negative temporal difference 

in the R. solani  treatment both in the Biologic soil (Fig. 8- c).The Biologic soil had 

always the higher Psa negative temporal differences. On the other hand, Sugar 

beet plants had the Psa temporal differences in the positive range; the Biologic 

type of soil had the higher Psa positive temporal difference in the R. solani , P. 

penetrans and Control treatment, the smaller Psa temporal difference in the R. 

solani  treatment, in the Manure soil (Fig. 8- c). In sugar beet species Gamma 

radiation treatment had an increase in Psa positive temporal difference from 

Manure, to Artificial fertilizer, to Biologic (Fig. 8- c). 

In the mean temporal difference in the mREP index treatments (Tab. 4, P 

=0. 001), soil type (Tab. 4, P =0. 007) and species (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 001) affected the 

index. Concerning the interaction of the factors, the tree-way interaction 

(soil*treatment*species) did not result in a significant effect (P &gt;0. 05), neither the 

interaction between treatment*soil (Tab. 4, P &gt;0. 05). The soil *species interaction 

was found (Tab. 4, P&amp;lt;0. 004) between initial and harvesting time. There was also 

a significant effect in two-way interaction between treatment and species. In 

mREP there was an increase in mREP temporal differences in the corn grown in 

biologic soil when compared to the others agricultural regimes where the 

differences were lower (Fig. 8). Treatment wise, Nutrients and R. solani treatment 

had an increase in the mREP temporal difference when compared to the other 

treatments in Corn species. The comparison between the treatment Nutrients 

and Nutrients + R. solani showed a significant positive mREP temporal difference 

between them, from Nutrients to Nutrient + R. solani (Fig. 8- b, P&amp;lt;0. 001). In Corn 

species Gamma treatment had a decrease of mREP temporal difference from

Biologic to Manure, to Artificial fertilizer. In Sugar beet species all the mREP 

temporal differences were in the negative domain (Fig. 8- b). In the same 

species R. solani treatment had a highly decrease of mREP temporal differences 

from Artificial fertilizer, to Biologic, to Manure. In the other hand Gamma 

treatment had the lowest decrease of mREP temporal difference in the Biologic 

type of soil (Fig. 8- b). There was no effect of nutrient fertilization in the R. solani 

infected treatment (i.e. Nutrients + R. solani vs R. solani).

Soil supports a diverse community of organisms, both functionally and 

taxonomically that interact in a complex belowground foodweb. In 

agroecosystem, biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services beyond 

the production of food, including recycling of nutrients, regulation of 

microclimate and local hydrological processes, suppression of undesirable 

organisms and detoxification of noxious chemicals(Altieri 1999; Collins and 

Qualset 2010). These above-belowground interactions are the main focus in this 

study, and how the plant spectral properties can change in relation with the 

different agricultural regimes. 

Land use and management can change the soil as habitat, influencing 

the soil food web and consequently soil biodiversity and productivity in different 

ways. In general, intensification leads to the decrease of  soil organisms 

abundance and biomass, specially the soil organisms that drive  processes of 

the C and N cycling (Vitousek and Walker 1989; Bardgett and Wardle 2003). 

Nevertheless, groups as pathogenic fungi and nematodes can benefit with the 

intensification of the land use, as R. solani and P. penetrans. The total biomass of 

these pathogens increase with a more intensive agriculture, in accordance with 

Van de Putten and coworkers (2001). The right choices of the agricultural 

practices and management, that promote net carbon accumulation, have 

been considered as an important mitigation option to the global warming 

(Freibauer et al. 2004; Gelfand and Robertson 2015; Kontopoulou et al. 2015).  

The impact of soil biota feedback on plant biomass interacts with soil nutrient 

availability, generally in a positive way (Van der Putten and Peters 1997; Wardle 

2002; Reynolds et al. 2003; De Deyn et al. 2004). Therefore, the shoot biomass in 

both plant species studied increased with disposal of the nutrient supply 

(Fertilization treatment) in the biologic soil. In the fertilized and infected 

treatment the biomass was also high with no soil pathogen effect in the plant 

biomass independent of the species. This lack of pathogen effect is known to

occur, as high nutrient concentration reduces soil biota effects in plant biomass 

(Van der Putten and Peters 1997; Carvalho et al. 2012). Troelstra et al. (2001) 

concluded in several greenhouse experiments, with sterilized dune soils, that 

ectoparasitic nematode species affect negatively plant growth. When 

comparing the infected and control treatments, no losses in biomass due to 

infection were found in the Manure regime. The application of manure compost 

that is rich in nitrogen may have reduced soil-borne diseases effects by releasing 

allelochemicals generated during soil storage and subsequent microbial 

decomposition (Lazarovits et al. 1999; Bailey and Lazarovits 2003). This 

accumulation of nitrogen and carbon also stimulate the increment of soil 

microbial diversity, also conferring protection against soil-borne diseases(DOC 

15.88, table1) (Conn and Lazarovits 1999; Kumar et al. 2012). It was also 

recognized that manure composts have an acid pH (HA =8.5/FA=3.55, table1), 

helping biotic control activity, such as antifungal activity due to the formation of 

nitrous acid (Tenuta and Lazarovits 2002; Timmusk 2003) but crop, soil type and 

management also play a role (Hoitink and Boehm 1999; Brussaard et al. 2007). 

The soil sterilization, using Gamma radiation amendment was used to show soil´s 

pathogenic potential in several studies (Oremus and Otten 1981; Maas et al. 

1983; Van der Putten et al. 1988; Putten and Troelstra 1990; De Rooij-Van der 

Goes et al. 1995; Zoon 1995; Troelstra et al. 2001). In this study the lowest biomass 

was found in the sterilized treatments suggesting that the soil biota has 

influenced the plant performance(Wardle et al. 2004) in this experiment.  

The Biologic type of soil had the highest shoot biomass which was, in some 

cases, 10 times larger the than in the Manure type of soil. The fact that biological 

type of soil had the highest organic matter content (Bin 2014)suggests once 

again that the organic materials also has impact on plant health and crop 

productivity (Magdoff et al. 1997). In contrast with several studies where

experiment we did not see this reduction. Birkhofer et al. (2008)and van 

Diepeningen et al. (2006) compared two different types of soil management: 

the Organic and the Artificial fertilizer. Concluding that Organic systems are 

more efficient in crop growth, soil quality and pest resilience. In contrast, the 

artificial fertilizers and herbicide/pesticide application affects the potential for 

top-down control of aboveground pests negatively reducing the organic 

carbon levels as well of both nitrate and soluble nitrogen in the soil. The worst 

plant performance was found in the Artificial fertilizer type of soil which supports 

earlier results. This demonstrates that this type of management is not the most 

suitable to grow Corn or Sugar beet, because of the high level of pathogen 

attacks of these two species. One of the tested hypotheses was that the best 

practice in soil management would have a positive effect in the growth of the 

plants, in our case, the Biologic type of soil management. The biological 

management had a significant interaction on species biomass even within the 

fungus attack treatment.  

In our hypothesis the best soil management would lead to lower peak in 

the visible region from 400 to 700nm in the spectral signature, because of the 

lower plant stress. Plant stress results in lower chlorophyll concentration with an 

increment of the reflectance in the visible region of the spectra (Adams et al. 

1999; Pinter et al. 2003).  Hillnhütter et al. (2011) showed that NDVI is a suitable 

index for the assessment of the symptoms caused by R. solani  in Sugar beet 

plants under controlled conditions. In this experiment, the infection due R. solani 

was detected with the decrease of NDVI in biologic type of soil. This did not hold 

for the other types of soil management at the initial time. However, all the Sugar 

beet plants in the other types of soil management were already in severe 

conditions and not measured due to lack of living tissue. In the Biologic soil with 

the R. solani treatment the plants were less stressed than in the other types of 

soils as lower mortality rate occurred (personal observation). Accordingly with 

Garbeva et al. (2004) the microbiota in a “rich” soil tend to reduce the severity

of the attack of soilborne pathogens (general disease suppression). So disease 

suppression can be influenced by cropping and management practices (Huber 

and Watson 1970).  

The pathogen treatment P.penetrans increase the NDVI difference 

between initial and final time, especially in Biologic type of soil in Corn species. It 

suggests that at the initial point the plant was in less stress than in the harvest 

time, supporting that the in plants biological managed resist longer to the 

infection. In Sugar beet species the NDVI negative temporal difference 

indicates that the Artificial Fertilizer had more stress in the plant due the 

pathogen. However, the lack of stress in the Sugar beet might be an artifact of 

the Sugar beet mortality rate. Plants that died were not possible to measure in 

the subsequent spectral measurements. As a result, plants that survive infection 

may indicate a lack of stress while what we find is a higher mortality. As such 

further tests need to be done in order to overcome this side effect. This condition 

has the effect of broadening the green reflectance peak, increasing visible 

reflectance (Adams et al. 1999). 

Ollinger (2011) showed that plants grown without nutrient addiction 

revealed a different reflectance pattern than plants with nutrients addiction, as 

our experiment. During the experiment was seen physical modification in this 

treatment in plant vigor. The Fertilization treatment when applied with the 

pathogen R. solani in Biologic type of soil resulted in lower temporal differences 

suggesting the system responded positively to the addiction of nutrients. 

The temporal differences of the Corn species in NDVI and mREP were 

positive, and in the Sugar beet were negative differences. In the other hand the 

Psa temporal differences in Corn were negative and in Sugar beet positive. This 

result shows that the temporal differences with SVI´s can have disadvantages 

only living plants can be analyzed.

It was possible to detect the symptoms of pathogenic soil borne diseases 

on plant spectral analysis through Spectral Vegetation Indices. The temporal 

data was as informative as the harvest time, and could lead to better 

understanding on plant disease spread and dynamics. It allowed to see the 

difference between the stress in the beginning of the experiment and in the end, 

especially in the Biologic type of soil where less stressed occurred at the 

beginning than in the harvest time. The biological soil higher temporal variance 

suggested a better resilience to pathogen attack and was considered the best 

type of soil for plant quality. It was also found that changes in nutrient supply 

can decrease disease symptoms or damage by pathogens in greenhouse 

experiment. 

I propose that further studies are needed to develop this method for use 

at the field scale as part of a strategy to detect early development of soil-borne 

diseases. It also can improve this study, the understanding of the interactions 

and synergisms between plant and soil with hyperspectral sensing method, using 

time series experiments on host-pathogen interactions and synergism as well as 

in screening systems for crop resistance. 

The root nematode collecting methods could also be revised, since we 

failed to detect live nematodes after the cold staining root method. This method 

might be little effective.

6.1.1 Plant parasitic nematodes and fungal pathogens 

 

The soil borne pathogens are a diverse group. Fungi are considered the 

most important pathogen group with a great diversity. A fungus is a Eukaryote 

(cells having true nuclei), spore-forming (reproduction), heterotrophs organisms 

(obtain their carbon and energy from other organisms) and most of the true 

fungi are filamentous and branched(Hogg 2013). They digest food externally 

and they absorb nutrients directly through its cells walls. Some fungi obtain their 

nutrients from a living host – biotrophs, others obtain from dead host – 

saprotrophs, and some infect a living host, but they kill host cells in order to 

obtain their nutrients – necrotrophs (Deacon 2005).  

Over 20,000 species of fungi are parasites and cause disease in crops and 

plants. All plants are attacked by one species or another of phytopathogenic 

fungi. Individual species of fungi can parasitize one or many different kinds of 

plants. Plant fungal pathogens can be divided into five main taxonomic classes 

based on morphological and biological characteristics: 1- 

Plasmodiophoromycetes, endoparisitic slim mold – e.g.: Plasmodiophora 

brassicae, causing club root of crucifers - Spongosphora subterranean, causing 

powdery scab of potato tubers; 2- Oomycetes, water molds. They cause several 

kinds of diseases including seedling blights, damping-off, root rots, foliar blights 

and downy mildews.  Some notable diseases are the late blight of potato, 

downy mildew of grape vine, sudden oak death and root and stem rot of 

soybean, with some important pathogens including Aphanomycetes, Bremia, 

Phytophthora and Pythium; 3- Ascomycetes, phytopathogenic fungal diseases 

such as peach leaf curl (Taphrina sp.), powdery mildew (Podosphaera, (apple), 

microsphaera (azalea) and vascular wilt diseases (Verticillium, Fusarium). 

Normally these diseases are recognize by signs and symptoms in leaf illnesses, 

fruit and vegetable rots, root, stem and soft rots, brown rot (Monilinia, cancers,

anthracnose); 4- Basidiomycetes, which are club and mushroom fungi, that 

cause smut fungi, corn smut, loose smut of barley, bunt of wheat, hollyhock , 

cedar-apple, white pine blister, needle rusts, cereal rusts. Some of the species of 

Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes grow another type of spore that is asexually 

generated, which put them in a different class called 5- Fungi Imperfecti. The 

most known pathogens in this group are Fusarium, Rhizocthonia, and Verticillium. 

Most of the soil borne fungi persists in the soil for a long term period; usually they 

produce resilient survival structures like a melanised mycelium, clamydospores, 

oospores and sclerotia. The ones that just produce the thin mycelium usually just 

survive for short periods. 

Nematodes are small, non-segmented roundworms. Soil borne plant-

parasitic nematodes spend the greatest part of their lives in the soil. Usually in soil, 

plant parasitic nematodes have three ways of living, either freely, as an egg or 

as a durable cyst. They can be external feeders on plant roots, or residents inside 

roots. This group of plant parasitic pathogens disturb crops by decreasing plant 

vigour and growth. In the field we can see some differences in the infection, 

some plants are severely infested and others don’t. Therefore, in the global yield, 

crops will mature irregularly and the quality of the production will decrease. Root 

knot nematodes in general cause the drop in vigour, consequently severe 

distortions and swellings of roots can affect the marketability of the root crops. 

Cyst nematodes can survive for long periods of time, the female body dries in 

the form of cyst, protecting the eggs within. Needle nematodes can feed at the 

tips of the roots, affecting root tips to swell and causing roots to fork or branch 

out. On the other hand, stubby root nematodes reduce the length of the roots. 

In this experiment we used two different plant pathogen, as a nematode the 

Pratylenchus penetrans and as Fungi the Rhizoctonia solani.

The primary source of energy for numerous biological processes of plants 

is the solar radiation. This radiant energy is essential in order to photosynthesize, 

grow and develop during its 

ontogeny and keep the 

thermodynamic balance in 

relation to the environment. So 

the interaction between solar 

radiation and plant is divide in 

three categories: 1) thermal 

effects, where more than 70% 

of the solar radiation is 

affected by the plants’ 

temperature and transpiration 

processes (Gates 1965; Boyer 

1967; Gates 1968)j; 2) 

photosynthetic effects, as 

photosynthetically active 

radiation is used to transform 

simple inorganic compounds 

such as water, carbon dioxide, 

minerals, salts in complex 

organic compounds like 

sugars, fats, proteins and 3) 

photomorphogenic effects, where the solar radiation plays an important role 

regulating and controlling the growth and development. Influencing many 

changes in plant morphology, physiology and biochemistry(Schmidt and 

Skidmore 2003). The optical properties of the leaves depends, therefore, on a 

number characteristics such as chlorophyll, carotenoid content and water,

cellulose and lignin and leaf internal structure, among others (Ross 1981; Schmidt 

and Skidmore 2003).The radiation incident upon the leaf surface may be 

reflected, absorbed, transmitted and scattered by leaf tissues, cells and their 

organelles. As such, the quantity of  reflection, absorption and transmission 

depends on the wavelength of radiation, angle of incidence, surface, optical 

properties and biochemical content of the leaf(Schmidt and Skidmore 2003).  

In this study the focus will be in the features of leaf reflectance patterns 

which can be subdivided in four main spectral regions (Ollinger 2011): Visible, 

red-edge, near infra-red and mid-infrared. 

 

6.2.1 The visible region 

 

Most of the radiation emitted by the sun appear in the range of 200 to 

2500 nm (Belward 1991; Carvalho 2013). Roughly half of the energy in incident 

radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface is in the visible wavelengths (Fig. 2). As 

such, plants adapted their foliar pigments to use the energy in the visible region 

for photosynthesis (Kumar et al. 2002). This pigment influence in reflectance 

patterns is mostly due to chlorophyll as it is around 5 to 10 times greater than 

others pigment, such as carotenoids or xanthophyll. Green vegetation pigments 

use electron transitions (Kumar et al. 2002; Ollinger 2011), as mechanism to 

absorb the radiation. The energy resulted from this electron transition will be 

used for photochemical reactions. 

 

Thus, some pigments adapted in this direction to be more effective in the 

use of radiation and the wavelength of absorbed light depends upon the 

specific pigment. We know that the lowest reflectance in the visible portion of 

the spectrum is between 400-700nm due to the normally called spectral 

absorption maxima of Chlorophyll around 420, 490 and 660nm (Knipling 1970; 

Belward 1991; Verdebout et al. 1994; Kumar et al. 2002; Belward and Valenzuela

in higher plants and their absorption maxima.

6.2.2 The red-edge 

 

Red edge refers to the region of rapid change in reflectance of 

vegetation in the near infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum 

between the 690-720nm. The red edge is a unique characteristic feature of the 

living plant spectral patterns because it results from two special optical 

properties of plant tissue: high internal leaf scattering causing large near infrared 

reflectance and chlorophyll absorption giving low red reflectance. It is often 

related to the stress responses of vegetation and it is the most studied feature in 

the spectral curve (Collins 1978).  

 

6.2.3 Near-infrared region 

 

The near-infrared region (NIR) is in the electromagnetic region between 

the 700 -1300nm. In contrast with the visible region, plants have a high 

reflectance and transmittance in this region. The energy levels in near infrared 

region are not enough for photochemical reactions and some studies 

demonstrate that white and green leaves have the same reflectance in this 

region, confirming that the pigments do not affect infrared (Billings and Morris 



|  M o n i t o r i n g  t h e  i m p a c t  o f  s o i l  m a n a g e m e n t  o n  p l a n t  s p e c t r a l  r e f l e c t a n c e  a n d  s o i l - b o r n e  d i s e a s e  r e s i s t a n c e  -  M L |

1951; Knipling 1970; Maas and Dunlap 1989; Sims and Gamon 2002; Gitelson et 

al. 2003). The main factor controlling the spectral responses in the near infrared 

region is the internal structure of the leaf(Gates et al. 1965; Sinclair et al. 1971) as 

each cell acts like an elementary corner reflector. The distribution of the air 

spaces, size, shape and arrangement of the cells affects the passage of the 

light in the leaf and the spectra in this region changes with the development, 

growth and senescence of the leaf (Jacquemoud and Baret 1990). 

 

6.2.4 Mid-infrared region 

 

In the Mid-infrared region (1300-2500nm) the reflectance is much lower 

than in Near Infra-red region (NIR). This area is characterized by strong water 

absorption features (Peñuelas et al. 1993; Schmidt 2003). The increase of water 

content in leaves will reduce the reflectance pattern not just in water 

absorptions bands but also in other regions. This phenomenon of water 

absorption is caused by transitions in the vibrational and rotational states of the 

water molecules within the leave (Belward 1991). This region is also known for 

absorption features of specific foliar biochemical lignin, cellulose, starch, 

proteins and nitrogen but usually they are camouflaged by water absorption in 

the fresh leaf spectra. 

 

6.2.5 Vegetation indices 

 

Vegetation indices are mathematical transformations of the original 

spectral reflectance signature. They are designed to diminish the additive and 

multiplicative errors linked with atmospheric effects, soil background effects, 

solar illumination, and sensor viewing geometry (Liang and Fang 2004). The 

different vegetation responses create different spectral signatures in diverse 

spectral regions, which have been used to develop several arithmetic formulae,

61 

 

commonly known as spectral vegetation indices (SVI´s). With the disposal of 

hyperspectral data and reflectance for a great number of spectral bands, 

several new vegetation indices have been developed. 

Over recent years, many indices vegetation have been developed for 

crop biophysical parameters estimation, to detect stress in plants, based on 

chlorophyll and water content (Peñuelas et al. 1993), pigment estimation 

(Penuelas et al. 1995; Blackburn 1998; Gitelson et al. 2003), and leaf area(Rouse 

et al. 1973). Zarco-Tejada et al. (2001) described chlorophyll content as a 

potential indicator of vegetation stress because of its direct role in the 

photosynthetic processes of light harvesting and initiation of electron transport 

and its responsiveness to a range of stresses. Knipling (1970) also specified that 

stress-induced alterations of spectral reflectance in the visible spectra result from 

the sensitivity of leaf chlorophyll concentrations to metabolic disturbance.  

Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) have been shown to be useful for an 

indirect detection of plant diseases (Thenkabail et al. 2000; Hatfield et al. 2008). 

Efficient use of spectral reflectance measurements for disease detection relies 

on the identification of most significant spectral wavelength, highly correlated 

to a specific disease. Mahlein et al. (2013) are trying to develop specific spectral 

disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. This kind of indices 

can improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision 

agriculture applications (Mahlein et al. 2010). 

Table 6 (extra information) gives a synoptic overview of spectral 

reflectance indices as developed and tested by different authors. 

 

6.2.6 Ratio indices (RI) 

 

Ratio indices are defined as quotients between measurements of 

reflectance in distinct parts of the spectra. These ratios are known to be 

effective in enhancing information, when there is an inverse relationship

between two spectral responses to the same biophysical occurrence. Though, 

an intrinsic weakness of these indices is the loss of uniqueness in information due 

to the fact that different leaves can have diverse spectral responses, however 

they have band ratio values that are similar (Delalieux et al. 2009).
