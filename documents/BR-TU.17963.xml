ABSTRACT

Holocene beachrocks of the Jaguaribe beach, State of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, consist of horizontal,

cemented layers approximately 40 cm thick. The cement shows three textural varieties: (a) calciferous,

surrounding siliciclastic grains, (b) micritic, with an acicular fringe; and (c) cryptocrystalline calcite in pores.

Early cementation took place at the water table below beach ridges, where geochemical, hydrodynamic and,

perhaps, also microbiological conditions favored rapid precipitation of aragonite and/or high-Mg calcite. ?13C

values range from –1.8 to +1.5?/?? for dissolved carbonate in interstitial water and from +0.2 to +2.1?/?? for
bioclastic components. ?18O values range from –2.8 to +0.5?/?? for seawater, freshwater and interstitial
water. ?13C values and diagenetic features suggest that cementation occurred in meteoric-vadose and/or

marine-phreatic water by loss of CO2 during evaporation of the interstitial water. Locally, superimposed low-

Mg calcite cements point to subsequent freshwater influence. Total-rock cement composition of vertically

stacked beachrock beds at the Jaguaribe beach shows that the highest beachrock bed is older than the one

(of same petrographic composition) situated at the current groundwater level. This implies a downward

progression of cementation, which probably followed the sea-level fall after a local high stand.

Key words: beachrocks, early diagenesis, O and C isotopes, Holocene.

INTRODUCTION

Beachrocks are a common feature along the north-

eastern coastline of Brazil and have demanded a

number of studies because of their role in the in-

terpretation of coastal dynamics. Generally they

are found parallel to the coastline as narrow, lin-

ear ridges (two or more) separated from each other

by sand and/or mud depressions. They consist of

sandy deposits, cemented by carbonate and of vari-

able length and extent, regarded to represent ancient

coastline. The beachrocks are considered as a ‘‘roof

ridge’’ of sandstone and younger beachrocks, rep-

resenting carbonate precipitation (a common fea-

ture of tropical beaches) during the last 20 years,

have also been identified on the basis of low degrees

of diagenesis, organic activity, and human artifacts

(Chaves et al. 1995, Chaves and Sial 1999, Chaves

1996, 2000).

In the studied area (Fig. 1), Jaguaribe beach,

situated to the north of Recife city, close to the Ita-

maracá Island, Pernambuco, beachrocks occur in the

shallow subtidal zone, and are very good examples

of early beachrocks. This locality was chosen for

detailed study because factors that control the dis-

tribution and rate of formation of these cemented

zones are important in understanding early carbon-

ate diagenesis. The coastal erosion locally excavates

these beachrock beds, and slabs from them accumu-

late on the beach. Trenches and pits have been dug

to follow beachrocks under beach.

The aim of this study is to illustrate the com-

plexity of beachrock cementation and to discuss its

relation to sea level, and to synthesize their sedi-

mentological and geochemical characteristics in or-

der to model their depositional environment. The

conclusions derived here have been substantiated by

stable-isotope geochemistry.

FACIES AND STRATIGRAPHY

Beach sediments at the studied localities are com-

posed mainly of quartz sands that also contain shells

of bivalves and gastropods, foraminifera, and frag-

ments of calcareous algae (Halimeda and Litho-

thamnium). Coarse- and fine-grained sand layers

alternate to form beach lamination dipping slightly

seaward. Coarse-grained layers usually are rich in

bioclasts; and the predominating fine-grained lay-

ers contain mainly opaque minerals. Keystone vugs

occur locally and indicate the upper beach facies.

The beach deposits overly a medium-grained

facies composed of sands and some bioclasts. Some

bioclasts are also found reworked in the beach fa-

cies. Roots rarely penetrate sediments below the

vegetated beach. This facies succession implies a

progradation of terraces over beach deposits.

Cemented beds occur exclusively in beach fa-

cies. The highest beachrock bed has been found

(Fig. 2) about 40 cm above the beach face corre-

sponding to low tide while the lowest cemented lay-

ers are situated at the water-influenced area. Beach-

rocks contains 60-80% quartz grains, up to 10% bio-

clastic fragments, and 2-10% (locally up to 20%)

cement. Porosity is around 45%.

At the studied locality, incipient beachrocks are

still found inland some 50 m from the beach, about

40 cm above the beach face. The beachrocks beds

are 15-20 cm thick, some are continuous and can be

followed over tens of meters along the beach where

erosion has exposed them; others consist of isolated

nodules (Fig. 2).

The surface of the cemented beds is usually

slightly undulated and smooth and the lower sur-

face can be very irregular and bumpy. Up to six

vertically stacked beachrock levels have been

observed, separated from each other by loose

sands (Fig. 2). Apart from the cements, the petro-

graphic composition of beachrocks beds and encas-

ing, non-consolidated beach sediments is the same.

The primary sedimentary structures (beach lamina-

tion, keystone vugs, root traces) are preserved in the

beachrocks.

CARBONATE CEMENTATION

The most common cement in the studied beach-

rock consists of calcite (determination of mineral-

ogy by EDAX and Feigl’s solution). Crystals usu-

ally are very small, but may locally reach 0.1 mm

in length. They are very elongate and pointed or

display broader, lath-like shapes.

Aragonite typically occurs as acicular crystals

forming fringes that are normally oriented to the

grain surfaces (Chaves 2000; Fig. 3A,B). In many

cases the cement fringe is isopachous, i.e. of equal

thickness, indicating marine phreatic precipitation

where pores were constantly water-filled. Asym-

metric cement fringes and thicker underside of

grains, concentrated at grain contacts (Chaves 2000;

Fig. 3C,D), are recorded in some beachrocks, and in-

dicate precipitation in the marine vadose zone (e.g.

Taylor and Illing 1969).

High- and low-Mg calcite usually forms mi-

critic cement coating grains or filling pores (Chaves

2000; Fig. 3E,F). Micritization of grains is common

in the beachrocks. If the meteoric groundwater is

high in the backshore area, then low-Mg calcite ce-

ments may be precipitated in beachrocks in the upper

intertidal zone.

Aragonite platelets occur locally and the ara-

gonite crystals commonly form isopachous rims

around the grains, thus implying cementation in

water-filled pores of a marine-phreatic diagenetic

environment (Longman 1980). In many cases, a

black layer covers the grain surfaces and forms the

base of the aragonite cement. Such layers have

been described from various other beachrocks (e.g.

Davies and Kinsey 1973, Strasser and Davaud

1986). Davies and Kinsey (1973) suggested that

they originated from organic mucus in which mi-

critic carbonate was precipitated and trapped, and

which then served as nucleation site for the arago-

nite crystals.

Marine-phreatic aragonite cements are found

in all studied samples, except in those of trench.

Some samples contain high-Mg calcite (35-40 mol%

MgCO3) displaying scalenohedral crystal forms.

High-Mg calcite occurs together with aragonite, ei-

ther growing between the needles and platelets, or

replacing them laterally. The magnesium-rich cal-

cite cements display an isopachous disposition and

indicate a marine-phreatic environment (Longman

1980). They occur in outcrop and pit, but are not

associated with a particular level of beachrock.

Micritic cements (aragonite and/or high-Mg

calcite) form meniscus bridges linking the particles

together (thus indicating the vadose zone; Longman

1980), or fill the pores completely.

Calcified organic filaments are rarely present

and suggest participation of algae and/or fungi in the

consolidation of the beachrock. Micrite cements are

locally associated with aragonite or calcite crystals.

Micritic cementation occurs in several samples and

are the dominating types, and beachrock of hole 1

is cemented entirely by micrite cement.

Several samples show large crystals of low-Mg

calcite invading and growing over pre-existing arag-

onite and/or high-Mg calcite cements. They formed

in a freshwater diagenetic environment and are lim-

ited to beachrock beds above the water table or ex-

posed on the beach, where rainwater could percolate.

Locally, the cement covers organic filaments.

Rapid cementation was probably favored at the

vadose/phreatic interface, i.e. at the continental wa-

ter. There, carbonate precipitation may be stimu-

lated by evaporation of interstitial water (Taylor and

Illing 1969) and/or CO2 degassing (Hanor 1978).

Water percolation, and thus tidal pumping, may en-

hance supply of ions. It has been shown by Given

and Wilkinson (1985) that percolation rate influ-

ences mineralogy and crystal morphology of the

precipitated carbonate cements. Good permeability

of the well-washed beach sands also explains why

cementation occurs preferentially there. Mixing of

marine and fresh water at the water table can equally

lead to cementation. Furthermore, the metabolic ac-

tivity of bacteria, algae and fungi living in the sedi-

ment may influence pH and Eh conditions, and cer-

tain organic substances can selectively precipitate

aragonite or calcite (Kitano and Hood 1965).

Minor and trace elements (Table I) in beach-

rocks cements demonstrate that, in the case of Jagua-

ribe beach, the relatively low strontium contents

(1.69 to 1.77 ppm) and iron in the beachrock ce-

ments could (at least partly) be explained by assimi-

lation of these elements by algae and bacteria. Low

Sr indicates that calcite cement was precipitated ini-

tially as aragonite in meteoric water environment

according to Baker et al. (1982). Adsorption of

organic matter on carbonate crystal surfaces (Suess

1970) and fixation by cementation locally leads to

black beachrock layers, which, when eroded, break

into black pebbles (Strasser 1984). At site, where

black beachrock is formed, abundant organic mat-

ter is furnished by marine plants (Cymodoceans),

which are washed onto the beach during storms and

then decay.

The large variety of parameters controlling

beachrock cementation may explain the complex re-

lationships and irregular distribution of the various

types of cement. Superposition of different cements

indicates changing of parameters through time and

space. Early consolidation is dominated by marine

(phreatic or vadose) cements precipitating at or close

to the water table.

Beachrock situated above the water table un-

dergoes freshwater diagenesis. Percolating rainwa-

ter locally dissolves unstable aragonite and high-

Mg calcite cements and precipitates low-Mg calcite.

Percolation rate is high along root shafts or in the

holes left after their decay. This leads to cemented

protuberances at the bottom of the beachrock beds

where the roots penetrated. Freshwater cementation

seals primary porosity and hardens the beachrock

significantly. Once exposed by erosion beachrock

may superficially be further cemented by freshwater

diagenesis or by carbonate precipitation from ma-

rine spray waters (Scoffin 1970).

Coexistence of various types of cement

in beachrock is common (e.g. Stoddart and Cann

1965, Taylor and Illing 1969, Beier 1985, Strasser

and Davaud 1986, Pirazzoli 1991). Fine-grained

beach sediment has to be stabilized by burial in order

to allow cementation. Roots and organic filaments

may enhance stabilization. Blocks of beach con-

glomerate on the other hand can be heavy enough to

resist constant dislocation by waves and cementation

can well occur without previous burial (Montaggioni

and Pirazzoli 1984 in Pirazzoli 1991). Sediment

trapped in fissures of exposed beachrock or between

pebbles of beach conglomerate will equally be in-

corporated. Fragments of beer bottles cemented into

beachrock demonstrate that carbonate precipitation

can be very rapid (Scoffin 1970).

DIAGENETIC FACIES

Beachrocks from the Jaguaribe beach look identi-

cal to any other in the littoral of Pernambuco. The

inclusion of recent artifacts in many of these de-

posits demonstrates that they are continuously be-

ing formed today. Petrographically, rare aragonite

cement micritized grains and micritic envelopes all

of which are products of marine-phreatic diagene-

sis characterize this beachrock. Carbon and oxy-

gen isotopic compositions of beachrock cement and

uncemented sand are nearly identical; ?13C varies

between –2.0?/?? and +3.6?/?? and ?18O between
–2.1?/?? to +1.3?/?? .

Carbon-isotope values for seawater, freshwa-

ter, interstitial water and primarily carbonates, of

beachrock samples, show a general depletion in 13C

and 18O relative to carbonates precipitated in equi-

librium with seawater (Table II). The cement has

a wider range of ?13C values than marine cements

owing to the mixing of carbon from soil gas and

dissolved carbonate sediment (Gross 1964). Block

low-Mg calcite has 13C/12C ratios closest to those

of marine cements suggesting that most carbon in

precipitation fluids is derived from dissolution of

metastable carbonates (e.g. present-day aragonite).

In these beachrocks, carbon-isotope ratios

of whole-rock samples vary according to the pro-

portion and isotopic composition of vadose and

meteoric-phreatic cements. One whole-rock sample

that is very enriched in 12C suggests that some ce-

ment may be even lighter than those analyzed. Iso-

topic exchange during recrystallization of allochems

may also contribute to 12C enrichment of whole-

rock samples. The oxygen-isotope composition is

also the result of diagenetic alteration by meteoric

water and is controlled by ?18O of local rainfall,

which is 16O-enriched relative to seawater (Allan

and Matthews 1977).

Many beachrock allochems are partially to

completely micritized. Micritization of grains most

extensive at and in some cases limited to grain

boundaries and results in development of a micritic

rim or envelope around each grain. In some in-

stances aragonitic cement is also micritized. Mi-

critic cement is most strongly depleted in 13C owing

to increased organic activity.

There is an extensive evidence of organic ac-

tivity. Small (10-20 µm in diameter) pits and tubes

are abundant on beachrock surfaces. The exclusive

presence of aragonitic cement in this rock suggest

that lithification of beach sediments was predomi-

nantly a marine process. There is no petrographic

evidence of meteoric interstitial influence in the pre-

cipitation of these beachrock cements and therefore

no need to invoke seawater/interstitial mixing mod-

els to explain the cementation process. The iso-

topic composition also indicates precipitation from

mixing sea/meteoric water. The rapid growth of

aragonite crystals in beach sediments is readily ac-

counted for in terms of seawater supersaturation and

enhancement of conditions for precipitation by el-

evated temperature evaporation and by fluctuations

of the pH and PCO2 due to photosynthesis by algae

living in and on the beach sand.

The algae are also responsible for micritization.

The formation of micritic cement has long been at-

tributed to the filling algal borings with minute crys-

tals of secondary calcium carbonate (Bathurst 1966,

Alexandersson 1972a, b).

This beachrock exhibits other assemblages of

diagenetic features that include equant low-Mg cal-

cite cement. Neomorphic transformation of arag-

onite cement and micritic low-Mg calcite. These

contain abundant coarse crystals of equant low-Mg

calcite cement. This sparry calcite completely fills

intergranular voids in some cases thus greatly re-

ducing porosity. The cement is partly originated

from neomorphism of marine aragonitic cement and

partly from direct precipitation in voids. Some cal-

cite crystals adjacent to grain boundaries are ori-

ented normal to the grain surface suggesting an orig-

inally fibrous texture; crystals in the center of the

pores lack such orientation. Locally aragonite and

block calcite cement coexist where neomorphism is

incomplete.

The large size of spar crystals suggests precipi-

tation from water-filled pores in a meteoric-phreatic

environment (Land 1970). The distribution of spar

cement is however patchy suggesting that precipita-

tion of spar may have occurred in a microphreatic

environment within vadose zone.

CONCLUSIONS

Several conclusions can be drawn from the study of

contemporaneous beachrock on the Jaguaribe beach

that may also be relevant for beachrock occurrences

in other areas and other geological epochs:

(1) Beachrock forms through cementation of beach

sediment, which generally has been stabilized

by burial and in many cases also by filaments

of algae and fungi. Primary sedimentary struc-

tures such as beach lamination, keystone vugs

or root traces are commonly preserved.

(2) The phreatic/vadose interface at the groundwa-

ter table offers geochemical and hydrodynamic

conditions, which may be favorable for rapid

precipitation of calcium carbonate. Microbio-

logical activity may further stimulate cemen-

tation. Sediment above and below the active

zone of cementation is not consolidated.

(3) Juxtaposition and superposition of various

types of cement suggests that geochemical hy-

drodynamic and/or microbiological parameters

changed through time and space. After a first

stage of cementation leading to consolidation

the beachrock may be further cemented in the

vadose or phreatic zones or during exposure on

the beach after erosion.

(4) Some particles can be relict and older than the

final beach sediment. On the other hand ce-

mentation starts some time after sedimentation

and may still go on after a long time. Total

beachrock ages are therefore maximum ages

for the beginning of cementation.

(5) As beachrock cementation probably starts at or

close to the interstitial water its stratigraphic

and topographic position may indicate the po-

sition of sea level at the time when cementation

began.

(6) Coastal erosion and wave action however fre-

quently undercut and break off beachrock beds

and slabs of beachrock accumulate in the inter-

tidal or shallow subtidal zones. Such fragments

can be easily identified and used to approxi-

mately situate ancient sea levels.

The diagenetic cements of intertidal beachrock

indicate sediment alteration in a variety of diage-

netic environments. Relict aragonite-needle and mi-

critic cement although rare indicate early diagene-

sis in a marine-phreatic environment. Blocky spar

cements are characteristic of meteoric-phreatic di-

agenesis. This environment must have developed

after early diagenesis in the marine-phreatic zones

because neomorphic calcite replaces aragonite ce-

ment. The isotopic composition of the vadose fea-

tures indicates that they were not precipitated from

the same water, as the spar cement and. therefore

the precipitation of spar cement was not contempo-

raneous with formation of the vadose features.

The following model for a progressive diage-

netic sequence is proposed that pass through a cycle

of local sea level changes.

The first diagenetic stage is typified by rock

like that of the Holocene beachrock facies. Arag-

onite cement is evidence that marine-phreatic pro-

cesses are dominant in the intertidal zone and that

lithification occurs in this zone. The even coating

of aragonite cement on sediment grains indicates

that these crystals precipitated from pores filled with

normal seawater. Colonization by algae and subse-

quent micritization of cement alter the newly lithi-

fied beachrock and result in the formation of well

micritic cement around each grain.

As long as the beachrock occupies the intertidal

zone growth of aragonite cement and organic activ-

ity will continue. New sand composed by corals

fragments and other debris are cemented onto the

beachrock surface. Large slabs of beachrock may

be dislodged during marine transgression or storms

and re-cemented into the intertidal deposits building

ancient beachrocks lines. In this earliest stage of

diagenesis, grazing intertidal organisms commonly

erode beachrocks surface.

In the second stage a lowering of sea level

moves the shoreline seaward leaving to that of their

deposition. Here, the beachrock would most likely

become buried by marine deposits (terraces) as evi-

denced by burial beach sediments. During this inter-

val, the sediment is in contact with meteoric intersti-

tial water. The meteoric water probably contained

in a local phreatic environment within the vadose

zone rather than an extensive interstitial lens as evi-

denced by the discontinuous distribution of the spar

cements. The most important process in this stage

is a neomorphic replacement of early aragonite ce-

ment by larger crystals of low-Mg calcite and pre-

cipitation of low-Mg calcite in pores. Reduction

of porosity is greatest in this stage because low-Mg

calcite completely fills some pores.

With further lowering of sea level the beach-

rock deposits are left even farther inland. In this

environment interference by organic process by ter-

restrial plants (coconut trees). The extent of va-

dose and freshwater diagenetic features indicates

that the more ancient beachrock had occupied an

inland position for a relatively long time and, there-

fore, this beachrock was possibly deposited during

the Holocene.

RESUMO

Os recifes de arenito holocênicos da praia de Jagua-

ribe, Pernambuco, Nordeste do Brasil, consistem de ca-

madas de areias de praia dispostas de forma horizontal,

cimentadas por carbonatos, com aproximadamente 40 cm

de espessura. O cimento ocorre sob três tipos: a) cal-

cítico, circundando os grãos siliciclásticos, b) micrítico,

com uma franja acicular; e c) preenchendo os poros na

forma de calcita criptocristalina. A cimentação, precoce,

aconteceu ao nível freático abaixo da crista praial, onde

condições geoquímicas, hidrodinâmicas e, talvez, micro-

biológicas favoreceram uma rápida precipitação de ara-

gonita e/ou calcita magnesiana. ?13C varia de –1.8 a

+1.5?/?? para carbonato dissolvido em água intersticial
e de +0.2 a +2.1?/?? para componentes bioclásticos.
?18O varia de –2.8 a +0.5?/?? na água do mar, água doce
e intersticial. ?13C e feições diagenéticas sugerem que a

cimentação ocorreu em água meteórica-vadosa e/ou mari-

nha-freática, por perda de CO2 durante a evaporação da

água intersticial. Localmente, cimento calcítico pouco

magnesiano superimposto sugere influência de água doce

subseqüente. A composição do cimento das camadas de

recifes de arenito empilhadas verticalmente na praia de

Jaguaribe mostra que a camada do topo do recife de are-
