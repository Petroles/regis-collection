OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ultrasound sensitivity and reproducibility as compared with magnetic resonance
imaging as the gold standard in the detection of splenic siderotic nodules in schistosomal patients. MATERIALS
AND METHODS: Initially, 21 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and diagnosed with splenic siderotic
nodules by magnetic resonance imaging were ultrasonographically evaluated for determining the method
sensitivity. In a second phase, the method reproducibility in the detection and quantification of siderotic nodules
(A: 1–5 nodules; B: 6–20 nodules; C: &gt; 20 nodules) was evaluated in 30 patients who were submitted to
ultrasonography blindly and independently assessed by two observers. Interobserver agreement was measured
by kappa statistics. RESULTS: Ultrasound sensitivity was 95.2% (95% confidence interval [77.3%; 99.2%]).
Intermethod agreement in the detection of siderotic nodules was 96.7% (95% confidence interval [82.8%;
99.9%]). For classification of nodules according to their quantification, the kappa test demonstrated a
statistically significant interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.67). CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography is highly
sensitive and accurate in the assessment of splenic siderotic nodules in schistosomal patients.
Keywords: Schistosomiasis mansoni; Ultrasonography; Spleen – ultrasonography.

OBJETIVO: Medir a sensibilidade e a reprodutibilidade da ultra-sonografia na detecção de nódulos sideróti-
cos esplênicos em pacientes esquistossomóticos, tendo a ressonância magnética como padrão de referên-
cia. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Na primeira fase do trabalho, 21 pacientes portadores de esquistossomose na
forma hepatoesplênica com diagnóstico de nódulos sideróticos à ressonância magnética foram submetidos
a avaliação ultra-sonográfica para a determinação da sensibilidade do método. Na segunda fase, com o ob-
jetivo de avaliar a reprodutibilidade da ultra-sonografia na detecção e na quantificação de nódulos sideróti-
cos (A: 1–5 nódulos; B: 6–20 nódulos; C: mais de 20 nódulos), outros 30 pacientes esquistossomóticos
foram submetidos a avaliação ultra-sonográfica de forma cega e independente por dois observadores. A re-
produtibilidade foi medida por meio da concordância entre os observadores e do teste kappa. RESULTA-
DOS: A sensibilidade da ultra-sonografia foi de 95,2% (intervalo de confiança a 95% [77,3%; 99,2%]). A
concordância entre ultra-sonografia e ressonância magnética para a detecção de nódulos sideróticos foi de
96,7% (intervalo de confiança a 95% [82,8%; 99,9%]). Para a classificação dos nódulos conforme a sua
quantificação, o índice kappa demonstrou concordância interobservador substancial (kappa = 0,67). CON-

hepatosplenic phase of the disease charac-
terized by portal hypertension secondary to
the development of periportal fibrosis(4–6).

Siderotic nodules, or Gamna-Gandy
bodies, consist in small fibrotic nodules
impregnated with hemosiderin, resulting
from focal micro-hemorrhages in the
splenic parenchyma caused by vascular
congestion in this organ. Portal hyperten-
sion is the most frequent cause of splenic
siderotic nodules(7).

Gamna-Gandy bodies may be evaluated
by different imaging methods(8), but pres-
ently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)m
especially with gradient-echo sequences is
considered as the method of choice in the
detection of these nodules(9,10). The US
value in the assessment of Gamna-Gandy
bodies has been discussed in the literature
with controversial results and sensitivity
ranging between 12% and 70.6%(10,11).

As regards diagnostic tests, a decisive
parameter to be taken into consideration is
the method accuracy that can be evaluated
by means of its reproducibility. No study is
available in the current literature evaluat-
ing the US reproducibility based on the
measurement of interobserver agreement
for detection of splenic siderotic nodules.

The present study was aimed at measur-
ing the sensitivity and reproducibility of US
in the detection of splenic siderotic nodules
in comparison with magnetic resonance
imaging as standard method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients’ selection

In the first phase of the present study, 20
patients with hepatosplenic schistosomia-
sis (11 men and nine women in the age
range between 23 and 87 years, mean age
= 44 years), diagnosed with siderotic nod-
ules at MRI and submitted to ultrasono-
graphic evaluation in a term of less than
three months for determining the sensitiv-
ity of the method. MRI studies were uti-
lized as a reference standard in the research,
and evaluated in consensus by two experi-
enced observers with more than five years
of practice in abdominal radiology.

The second phase of the study was
aimed at evaluating the US reproducibility
in the detection and quantification of sid-
erotic nodules in other 30 patients diag-

nosed with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis
(15 men and 15 women with ages ranging
between 25 and 68 years, mean age = 45
years) submitted to ultrasonographic evalu-
ation. All of the US studies were performed
by two observers with four-year residency
in imaging diagnosis and previously trained
to identify and quantify splenic siderotic
nodules.

All of the selected patients were above
18 years of age and being followed-up in
the departments of Clinical and/or Surgi-
cal Gastroenterology at Hospital São Paulo
– Universidade Federal de São Paulo. Ex-
clusion criteria were the following: contin-
ued utilization hepatotoxic pharmaceuti-
cals, positive serology for hepatitis B or C
viruses, and history of chronic alcoholism.
The present study was previously approved
by the Committee for Ethics in Research of
the Institution and a term of free and in-
formed consent was signed by all of the
patients.

MRI evaluation

MRI studies were performed in high
magnetic field (1.5 tesla) Magnetom Sym-
phony™ system (Siemens; Erlangen, Ger-
many), with multiplanar (axial and coro-
nal), turbo spin-echo and gradient-echo T1-
and T2-weighted sequences, before and
after intravenous paramagnetic contrast

injection. The diagnosis of siderotic nod-
ules was defined by the presence of small
foci of low-intensity signal on all of the
sequences, especially on gradient-echo
T2*-weighted sequences without signifi-
cant enhancement after contrast injection
(Figure 1)(9,10). The MRI studies analysis
was performed on a Leonardo (Siemens)
workstation.

Ultrasonographic evaluation

Ultrasonography studies were per-
formed on an EnVisor™ (Philips Medical
Systems; Bothell, WA, USA) equipment
coupled with a convex, multi-frequency
transducer.

The diagnosis was considered as posi-
tive for siderotic nodules in the presence of
dispersed, hyperechogenic, parenchymal
foci non-attributable to thickened vessels
walls in the spleen (Figure 2). Siderotic
nodules identified were classified accord-
ing to methodology already proposed(12), as
follows:

– Category A: a transverse section of the
spleen demonstrating &amp;lt;5 nodules (focal);

– category B: a transverse section of the
spleen demonstrating 6-20 nodules (scat-
tered);

– category C: a transverse section of the
spleen demonstrating &gt; 20 nodules (dif-
fuse).

The evaluation of the US reproducibil-
ity in determining the presence of siderotic
nodules in the 30 patients included in the
present study demonstrated an interob-
server agreement of 96.7% (confidence
interval at 95% [82.8%; 99.9%]). The re-
producibility of the classification of sid-
erotic nodules into categories according to
their quantity, demonstrated a substantial
interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.672;
confidence interval at 95% [0.374; 0.970]).

DISCUSSION

US is considered as the method of
choice in the evaluation of schistosomal
patients, considering its wide availability,
excellent cost-benefit ratio, and non-inva-
siveness(6). Sonographic alterations de-
tected in these patients have already been
described and currently are widely utilized

hyperechogenic foci (crossed

erotic nodules (category C).

Statistical analysis

The interobserver agreement was mea-
sured by means of kappa index, an useful
test for classifying the variability in the
interpretation of different data sets includ-
ing categorical variables(13). Kappa indices
were classified as follows: non-significant
(0.0–0.2), median (0.21–0.40), moderate
(0.41–0.60), substantial (0.61–0.80), and
almost-perfect (0.81–1.00).

RESULTS

Twenty of the 21 patients with siderotic
nodules detected by MRI were correctly
evaluated by US, whereas in only one pa-
tient ultrasound could not detect these nod-
ules, giving the method a sensitivity of
95.2% (confidence interval at 95% [77.3%;
99.2%]).

both for evaluating the hepatic involve-
ment, determining the level of portal hyper-
tension and characterizing splenic siderotic
nodules(4,6,14). However, for establishing
the validity of a diagnostic test, it is impor-
tant to define, besides its efficacy, its accu-
racy, which can be determined by calculat-
ing the method reproducibility. The present
study has been driven particularly by the
absence, in the medical literature, of a sys-
tematic evaluation of the US reproducibil-
ity by means of the measurement of
interobserver agreement as regards the de-
tection of splenic siderotic nodules.

Siderotic nodules, or Gamna-Gandy
bodies, were firstly described by Marini, in
1902, but this entity became actually
known with the studies developed in 1905
and 1921 by Charles Gandy and Carlo
Gamna, giving rise to the eponym(9). Sid-
erotic nodules consist in small fibrotic nod-
ules impregnated with hemosiderin and, in
some cases with calcifications resulting
from focal micro-hemorrhages in the
splenic parenchyma, generally related to
congestive splenomegaly (Figures 3 and 4).
Most rarely, siderotic nodules may be
found in other tissues such as thymus,
lymphonodi, liver, heart, and in conditions
such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobi-
nuria, leukemia and lymphoma(7,15–19).
However, portal hypertension is the most
frequent cause of these nodules, which are
present in about 9% to 12% of patients with
portal hypertension for causes unrelated to
schistosomiasis(9,10).

The relevance of detecting the presence
of splenic siderotic nodules by means of
imaging methods is related to the fact that
these nodules represent a morphological
evidence of a long lasting portal hyperten-
sion process(20).

Currently the relevant role of MRI as a
reference method in the detection of sid-
erotic nodules is a consensus in the litera-
ture(8–10,20–23). MRI is extremely sensitive to
paramagnetic contrast agents; hemoglobin
products (for example, hemosiderin) have
a paramagnetic effect, being easily detected
on RM images (especially the high field
ones), were they appear like low-signal
intensity nodules or absent signal on spin-
echo and especially gradient-echo T1- and
T2-weighted images(8,9,20) (Figure 1). These
nodules also can be evaluated by other
imaging methods such as computed tomog-
raphy (CT) and US. On US images, the
nodules appear as small, punctate hy-
perechogenic foci sparsely scattered in the
splenic parenchyma, with or without pos-
terior acoustic shadowing, non-attributable
to small vessels walls(7) (Figure 2).

The incidence of these nodules initially
described in the literature for schistosomal
patients in the hepatosplenic phase, was of
7% in studies utilizing US as imaging
method(14). Most recently, studies utilizing
MRI have found a much higher incidence
of siderotic nodules (84.2%) in schistoso-
mal patients(21). In the present study, the
frequency of detection of siderotic nodules
by US and MRI in patients with hepato-
splenic schistosomiasis was also very high,
ranging between 96.6% and 100%.

Ultrasonography sensitivity in the de-
tection of siderotic nodules also has been
discussed. Differently from previous stud-
ies developed in the eighties, reporting sen-
sitivities between 10.5% and 25%(9,10), the
current literature describes a high diagnos-
tic accuracy for this method, with 70.6%
sensitivity, 78.9% specificity, and 85.7%
positive predictive value(11). The results of
the present study surpassed these latter,
with 95.2% sensitivity. This discrepancy in
relation to the US frequency and sensitiv-
ity in detecting siderotic nodules can be
attributed to the utilization of observers
specifically trained for researching these
nodules, and, also, to the technological
developments of US systems over the last

two decades, with an expressive improve-
ment in their images resolution.

Apparently, in cirrhotic patients, the
presence and number of siderotic nodules
are associated with their level of portal
hypertension(20). The quantification of
these nodules and their classification into
categories according to the number of nod-
ules found had been already proposed for
the liver(12), but had not been utilized for the
spleen yet. The present study found a high
interobserver agreement as to the overall
presence or absence of siderotic nodules
(96.7%). Regarding the US reproducibility
for the quantification and classification of
siderotic nodules into categories, the kappa
index showed a substantial interobserver
agreement (0.67). Additional studies are
required for determining the significance of
this quantification and its actual correlation
with the level of portal hypertension.

In addition, in the present study, a ten-
dency towards a higher interobserver
agreement was observed in relation to pa-
tients with a higher number of siderotic
nodules (category C). In the patients with
lower number of siderotic nodules (espe-
cially in those of category A), the main dif-
ficulty found by the observers was the dif-
ferentiation between true nodules and small
vessels walls; color Doppler US may be
useful in this differentiation. In the present
study, however, color Doppler US could
not be utilized, considering that this previ-
ously unforeseen difficulty occurred only
with some patients evaluated late in the
development of the study.

Amongst the differential diagnoses for
splenic siderotic nodules observed at US,
tuberculotic calcified granulomas should
be considered. These granulomas tend to be
larger and more hyperechogenic than sid-
erotic nodules, besides presenting an evi-
dent acoustic shadowing, a feature that is
not present in the case of non-calcified si-
derotic nodules(9), which represented the
majority in the present study. Additionally,
because of the paramagnetic effect of he-
mosiderin products, siderotic nodules are
clearly visualized on T1- and T2-weighted
images as small foci of low-intensity or
absent signal and without contrast-en-
hancement after intravenous gadolinium
injection(9,10). Conversely, non-calcified
tuberculotic nodules tend to present a vari-

able signal on T1- and T2-weighted im-
ages, and most frequently with hyper-in-
tense signal and ring-shaped contrast-en-
hancement after gadolinium injection(24).
Calcified siderotic nodules may not be dis-
tinguishable from different types of calci-
fied granulomas, like those resulting from
tuberculosis and histoplasmosis (9).

Amongst the limitations of the present
study, it is important to note the restricted
number of patients included in the sample,
as well as the absence of a control group
which would allow the addition of other
useful information (for example, specific-
ity, positive and negative predictive values)
for determining the US diagnostic accuracy
in the detection of these nodules. Certainly,
MRI cost and availability represent a lim-
iting factor for the further expansion of the
sample. Notwithstanding, it is important to
note that the group of patients included in
the present study reflects the reality of our
institution, as it may be evidenced by other
studies in this same research line(25,26).
Considering the lack of previous experi-
ments, the quantitative classification of
splenic siderotic nodules was adapted from
a classification proposed for hepatic sid-
erotic nodules in cirrhotic patients(12), and
that was not previously validated in schis-
tosomal patients. Another type of classifi-
cation could demonstrate results different
from the ones in the present study.

Finally, just as demonstrated by other
authors(4), the present study demonstrated
that ultrasonography, besides being a low-
cost, non-invasive and widely available
imaging method, is highly sensitive and
reproducible in the evaluation of splenic
siderotic nodules in patients affected by
schistosomal portal hypertension.
