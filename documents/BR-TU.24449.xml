ABSTRACT

System for hydrological forecasting and alert running in an operational way are important tools for floods impacts reduction. The present 
study describes the development and results evaluation of  an operational discharge forecasting system of  the upper Uruguay River 
basin, sited in Southern Brazil. Developed system was operated every day to provide experimental forecasts with special interest for 
Barra Grande and Campos Novos hydroelectric power plants reservoirs inflow, with 10 days in advance. We present results of  inflow 
forecasted for floods occurred between July 2013 to July 2016, the period which the system was operated. Forecasts results by visual 
and performance metrics analysis showed a good fit with observations in most cases, with possibility of  floods occurrence being well 
predicted with antecedence of  2 to 3 days. Comparing the locations, it was noted that the sub-basin of  Campos Novos, being slower 
in rainfall-runoff  transformation, is easier forecasted. The difference in predictability between the two basins can be observed by the 
coefficient of  persistence, which is positive from 12h in Barra Grande and from 24h to Campos Novos. These coefficient values also 
show the value of  the rainfall-runoff  modeling for forecast horizons of  more than one day in the basins.

RESUMO

Sistemas operacionais de previsão hidrológica e alerta são ferramentas úteis para a redução de impactos das inundações. Este estudo 
apresenta o desenvolvimento e uma avaliação dos resultados de um sistema de previsão de vazão operacional para a bacia do alto rio 
Uruguai, localizada no sul do Brasil. O sistema foi operado diariamente para fornecer previsões experimentais com interesse especial 
nas afluências dos reservatórios das usinas hidrelétricas de Barra Grande e Campos Novos, com antecedência de 10 dias. Aqui são 
apresentados resultados das previsões de afluências para as principais cheias ocorridas entre julho de 2013 e julho de 2016, período no 
qual o sistema foi operado. Os resultados das previsões por análise visuais e de métricas de desempenho mostraram um bom ajuste 
com observações na maioria dos casos, prevendo a possível ocorrência de inundações com 2 a 3 dias de antecedência. Na comparação 
entre as duas bacias notou-se que um a sub-bacia de Campos Novos, por ser mais lenta na transformação chuva-vazão, é mais fácil 
de ter suas vazões previstas. A diferença na previsibilidade entre as duas bacias pode ser observada pelo coeficiente de persistência, 
que é positivo a partir de 12h em Barra Grande e a partir de 24h para Campos Novos. Estes valores de coeficiente também mostram 
a importância da transformação chuva-vazão para a previsão de horizontes de mais de um dia nas bacias.

Evaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts

INTRODUCTION

Floods events are one of  the several natural disasters 
occurring on the world that cause severe impacts to populations 
in socioeconomic terms (MOORE; BELL; JONES, 2005). 
The occurrences of  floods observed recently in Brazil has been 
followed by an increasing interest from sectors of  society in 
measures that allow to anticipate these events, reducing their 
impact in terms of  lives and property damage (FAN; PAIVA; 
COLLISCHONN, 2016). In this sense, alert systems are one of  
the most effective measures (ALFIERI et al., 2012).

Early warning systems have main purpose of  predict 
the future possibility of  a river floods occurrence and its related 
characteristics at vulnerable sites with time advance and acceptable 
accuracy, to issue warnings to those responsible for civil defense, the 
water consumers, the local population and the hydraulic structures 
operators in the region (FAN et al., 2016; ALFIERI et al., 2012; 
MOORE; BELL; JONES, 2005; TACHINI, 2003). The main 
component of  any early warning system is a system for flood 
forecasts.

Flood forecasting systems are especially important for basins 
having fast runoff, a characteristic behavior of  several brazilian river 
basins, mainly those located in the South region. One of  them is 
the upper Uruguay river basin (see Figure 1), located in the Serra 
Geral geological formation, a region dominated by basalts soils 
and rocks (NARDY et al., 2002). The basin geological framework 
provides a very fast response to rainfall events that, consequently, 
may produce unexpected floods. Summed to this, the absence of  
precipitation seasonality allows the occurrence of  sudden river 
discharge increases at any time of  the year.

In addition, researches related to forecasting systems 
evaluation are important to show potential benefits of  tested 
techniques and products and to allow a better understanding of  
the modelled systems. Based on the forecasts, developments can 
be planned to improve accuracy (ALFIERI et al., 2014). Also, in 
the context of  operational use, investigations help to highlight the 
current system problems, whose must be considered when forecast 
results are to be used for decision making (PAGANO et al., 2014).

Some examples of  streamflow forecasting studies focusing 
on its results verifications can be found in recent literature: Bergh 
and Roulin (2010), Thiemig et al. (2010), Schellekens et al. (2011), 
Bao et al. (2011), Addor et al. (2011), Boucher et al. (2011), Bourdin 
and Stull (2013), Alfieri et al. (2014), Pagano (2014), Fan et al. 
(2014, 2015a,c), Siqueira et al. (2016a) and Casagrande et al. (2017).

From these cited references, the work of  Bergh and Roulin 
(2010) presented the forecasting systems from the Belgium Royal 
Meteorological Institute (RMI) for rivers Meuse and Scheldt 
(in Europe, with areas ranging from 590 to 2440 km2) with 9 days 
of  forecast horizon. Results of  the model were evaluated for a 
hindcasting experiment between February 2006 and March 2009. 
The authors concluded that the forecasts perform well until the 
most distant forecast horizon and that it has economic value added 
through a specific evaluation metric.

Thiemig et al. (2010) evaluated the feasibility of  forecasts 
with up to 10 days horizon in two locations in East Africa, one 
site in the Juba River Basin (166,000 km2) and one in the Shabelle 
River Basin (207,000km2). Basically, the experiment consisted 
of  reproducing the EFAS system technology (THIELEN et al., 
2009) for the African basins. Results showed that the forecasting 
system could predict about 85% of  the flood cases evaluated 
with good accuracy.

The work of  Addor et al. (2011) shows an assessment of  a 
forecasting system for the Sihl river basin (336 km2), which flows 
through Zurich (Switzerland) and has been operational since 2008. 
Data from the COSMO-7 and the COSMOLEPS meteorological 
models are considered as a forcing in the hydrological model. 
The results of  several metrics used by the authors indicated benefits 
in the use of  predictions from COSMOLEPS. The authors also 
found that the two major rainfall events in the basin during the 
evaluation period were generally underestimated.

In the paper of  Schellekens et al. (2011), the authors 
evaluated the performance of  the regional forecasting system 
called MOGREPS (Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble 
Prediction System) for flood prediction in the Thames River 
basin in the United Kingdom. The MOGREPS version used 
has a resolution of  24 km and a forecast horizon of  three days.

Fan et al.

The hydrological model used was the TCM (Thames Catchment 
Model), with a procedure of  output corrections. As conclusions, 
the authors cite that MOGREPS predictions resulted in good 
flood forecasts across the Thames region. The frequency of  false 
alarms in the evaluated period was low, and the smaller events 
(below alert limits) were also well predicted.

In the study by Bourdin and Stull (2013) the authors 
present a verification of  forecasts of  inflows to a hydroelectric 
plant reservoir in the Cheakamus river basin (721 km2) in Canada. 
The forecasting system used multiple meteorological models connected 
to multiple hydrological models through different downscaling 
schemes. The major goal of  such a complex forecasting system 
was to sample all possible uncertainties in the process, and include 
them in the results. The authors concluded that the inclusion of  
all uncertainties increased the resolution and the capacity of  event 
discrimination of  the system, and that the removal of  bias allowed 
to use the maximum potential of  the system.

Alfieri et al. (2014) presented a complete evaluation of  
the flow forecasts from the EFAS (European Flood Awareness 
System) to various locations in Europe. According to the authors, 
the performance metrics showed that the forecasts have dexterity for 
medium and small basins for up to ten days in advance. For smaller 
and mountainous basins, the results are still not very suitable.

Pagano (2014) presents an evaluation of  the historical 
record of  flood forecasts runned in an operational way by the 
Regional Flood Management and Mitigation Center (RFMMC) of  
the Mekong River Commission (Southeast Asia). The RFMMC 
issues daily deterministic forecasts of  river height with 1 to 5 days 
in advance throughout the wet season (June-October) for 
22 locations of  interest. Results evaluated by skill scores shows a 
good performance of  the forecasts, mainly in regions presenting 
a strong seasonal cycle and a narrow natural range of  variability. 
On the other hand, a moderate probability of  detection of  48% 
and 31% at 1 and 5 days ahead, respectively, and false alarm rate 
of  13% and 74% at 1 and 5 days ahead, respectively were observed 
in the forecasts results evaluated from a categorical “crossing 
above/not-crossing above flood level” perspective.

More recently, the study from Siqueira et al. (2016a) aimed to 
assess both the quality of  ensemble flood forecasts on Taquari-Antas 
(RS, Brazil) basin and its potential to provide additional information 
to a local Flood Alert System. On a single event evaluation, the peak 
discharge was reasonable well predicted by at least one ensemble 
member, in nearly all forecasts, with a good prediction of  the 
flood timing for the considered lead times. An overall tendency of  
underestimation was also identified, since most of  the observed 
values was between the higher ranks of  the ensemble. Results 
suggest that there is a benefit in having hydrological ensemble 
forecasts, which can be used as a complementary information to 
a local Flood Alert System supporting pre-alert issues and Civil 
Defense internal planning actions.

In general, all these studies provide useful insights of  
the forecasting systems performances. They present assessment 
studies of  pre-operational or operational forecasting systems and 
contribute to the current knowledge about methodologies and 
hydro-meteorological forecasting performances at multiple locations.

Considering the exposed above, the present study describes 
the development and results evaluation of  an experimental 

operational discharge forecasting system of  the upper Uruguay 
River basin, which is based on a large-scale distributed hydrological 
model. The hydrological model is used to estimates river discharges 
forced by observed and predicted rainfall as inputs. The system may 
provide experimental deterministic forecasts at several locations 
of  the basin. The present study case could be operationally 
useful because the information generated could be considered, 
for example, for better operations of  two hydropower plants 
(HPP) reservoirs: Campos Novos HPP; and Barra Grande HPP 
(Figure 1). Although the basins are located close to each other, 
the complexity of  inflow forecasting generation to the dams 
differs due to regional hydrological features, which interacts with 
meteorological uncertainties.

The system was operated in operational mode once a day 
from July 2013 to July 2016. The following sessions contain a 
description of  the main features of  the developed system and the 
results of  forecasts of  reservoirs inflows for the largest floods 
occurred during the operational period.

As the referenced commented studies, this work also 
aimed to contribute to the current knowledge about forecasting 
performances, especially related to understanding the operational 
feasibility of  the techniques applied and the data used for basins 
such as those studied. In addition, it is done a comparative 
analysis of  how sub-basins close in space may present different 
performances. The hypothesis of  the study is that the developed 
system is suitable for forecasts in the region, which is evaluated 
by an analysis of  the forecasts performed. In the presented case, 
accurate forecasts can be translated into improved decisions 
relating to energy generation, dam safety and flood control through 
hydraulic structures operation.

FORECASTING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Rainfall and discharge data from telemetric gauges spatially 
distributed within the basin are used by the forecast system of  
the upper Uruguay river basin. The system also uses Quantitative 
Precipitation Forecasts (QPF) from meteorological models as 
input data to provide streamflow forecasts ten days in advance at 
multiple locations in the basin. If  necessary upstream boundary 
conditions can also be used, as the programmed outflow of  Dams. 
Figure 2 presents an illustrative workflow of  the forecasting 
system. All data is processed in the MGB-IPH hydrological model 
(COLLISCHONN et al., 2007; FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; 
PONTES et al., 2015, 2017) described in the following section.

Using the system requires rainfall data recorded by a 
telemetric gauges network for a recent past. All rainfall information 
is interpolated by the inverse distance weighted method to assess 
the spatial patterns of  rainfall across the basin before be used in the 
hydrological model as input information. Also, at defined locations 
within the basin, the streamflow time series for the recent past 
are derived using the estimative of  water levels from telemetric 
gauges and its respective rating curves to generate streamflow time 
series for the recent past. These series area used through a data 
assimilation scheme implemented in the MGB-IPH (described later 
in this paper). Table 1 presents the name and location (geographic 
coordinates) of  all telemetric gauges used in the presented system, 
they are used to measure both rainfall and water levels.

Evaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts

The streamflow forecasting process also needs data about 
the future rainfall, over the forecasted lead times. For research 
purposes, in the present study, it was used Quantitative Precipitation 
Forecasts (QPF) from the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) 
model Eta-15km. The Eta-15km, which has 15km of  grid 
resolution, provides future rainfall predictions over all South 
America. The Eta model data have a forecast horizon of  7 days 
and are available twice a day by the webpage of  the Brazilian 
meteorological center CPTEC (“Centro de Previsão de Tempo e Estudos 
Climáticos”, in Portuguese).

The system results were daily monitored by a research 
team that included the system developers. The total lead time of  
the distributed hydrological forecasts by the system was ten days 
(240 hours). The first 7 days of  the forecasting horizon used the 
CPTEC Eta-15km rainfall forecasts as inputs, and the last 3 days 
considered a null precipitation over the watershed area.

MGB-IPH HYDROLOGICAL MODEL 
DESCRIPTION

The MGB-IPH (Modelo de Grandes Bacias – Instituto de 
Pesquisas Hidráulicas) is a large-scale hydrological model that 
calculates the hydrological processes into a catchment through 
climate variables, physiographic data and soil and land type data 
(COLLISCHONN et al., 2007; FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; 
PONTES et al., 2015, 2017).

The MGB-IPH is a distributed hydrological model and 
the basin is subdivided into minor units (catchments) using 
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools in a stage of  
data pre-processing (SIQUEIRA et al., 2016b). The model runs 
with daily or hourly time step, although some internal calculation 
processes, such as streamflow routing always uses a smaller time 
steps. Most of  the MGB-IPH applications have been used a daily 
time step (FAN; COLLISCHONN, 2014; PONTES et al., 2015). 
In the present work, we applied the hydrological model for flood 
forecasting with an hourly time-step since 2013.

The spatial variability of  the relief  is considered using a 
Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The spatial variability of  vegetation, 
land use and soil type within the basin are considered using the 
Hydrological Response Classes (HRC) approach. The HRC’s are 
areas of  similar hydrological behavior, defined by the combined 
land use and soil type maps (FAN et al., 2015b). Combining 
the HRC map with each catchment generates the Hydrological 
Response Units (HRU), where the vertical hydrological balances 
are processed.

Soil water balance is performed using a method based on 
the surface runoff  by excess of  soil capacity storage that uses a 
probabilistic relationship between soil moisture and the fraction 
of  saturated soil area. Evapotranspiration is estimated by the 
Penman-Monteith equation.

Fan et al.

Streamflow generation in the basin and its propagation to 
the river network is performed in two steps. First streamflow is 
generated inside each catchment and then routed to the stream 
network using three linear reservoirs (representing base flow; 
subsurface flow and surface flow). The output streamflow of  
those reservoirs is summed and routed along the river network 
using the Muskingum-Cunge flow routing method.

The MGB-IPH model parameters were first set for the 
Uruguay river basin based on the parameters used by Andreolli et al. 
(2006) to simulate the basin, and later were refined in the context 
of  a research and development project (BELTRAME, 2012). 
Calibration performance to the upper Uruguay river basin is 
presented at Table 2. Used performance metrics were: (i) Discharges 
Nash Sutcliffe coefficient NS (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, 1970); 
(ii) Discharges Logarithm Nash Sutcliffe coefficient NSlog; and 
(iii) volume error (mean discharge error).

In general words, calibration was considered good enough 
for forecasting purposes in the basin. The median values of  NS, 
NSlog and Volume Error performance metrics were 0.6, 0.7 and -2%.

In the context of  real-time forecasting, the model includes 
a method of  data assimilation, when it is said that the model works 
in “update mode” or operating “on- line”. The data assimilation 
method in the MGB-IPH model is conducted through an empirical 
method that uses real time observed flow rates to update the 
initial conditions of  the MGB-IPH model, represented by the 
flow calculated along the drainage network and the volume of  
water stored in the catchments reservoirs (MELLER; BRAVO; 
COLLISCHONN, 2012; FAN; MELLER; COLLISCHONN, 2015).

For the application in the Uruguay river basin the data 
assimilation method of  the MGB-IPH model was activated and 
used in the system operation.

OPERATIONAL FORECASTING ASSESSMENTS 
AND DISCUSSIONS

The daily Uruguay forecasting system predictions were 
recorded since July 2013 until July 2016 for the system evaluation. 
In the following sections is presented the results obtained until the 
end of  the system operation. All results are inflow assessments.

First, is showed a visual assessment of  some of  the past 
floods forecasted. Second, the system performance is evaluated by 
comparing forecasts with observed discharges using performance 
metrics commonly used in hydrological modelling studies: (i) Nash 

Sutcliffe coefficient NS (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, 1970); (ii) Persistence 
Coefficient (PC); (iii) Mean Absolute Error (MAE); and (iv) Root 
Mean Square Error (RMSE).

The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (Equation 1) allows a 
comparison between the results predicted and the mean of  all 
observed streamflows. The closer its value is to one the better 
are the results of  forecasts. On the other hand, negative values 
indicate that using the averaged observed value as the predicted 
value provide a better results.

The PC shown in Equation 2, allows a comparison between 
forecasted results and a hypothetical model that predicts, for all 
time intervals over the forecast horizon, the last observed value 
(hence the name “persistence”). It is also known as “today is equal 
to yesterday” model. The forecasts results are better as closer the 
PC value is to one. When PC values are less than zero, using the 
last observed value performs better than the prediction value.

The Mean Absolute Error (Equation 3) measures the 
average absolute difference between the predicted and observed 
values. The results of  forecasts are better as closer the MAE 
value is to zero. Finally, the Root Mean Square Error (Equation 4) 
measures the root mean square difference between the forecasted 
and observated values. Again, the closer its value is to zero, the 
better the results of  forecasts. Compared to the MAE, the RMSE 
helps to understand the distribution of  the errors in the forecast, 
since it gives greater weight to larger deviations.

line. The red line is the inflow threshold value operationally used 
as a reference for floods occurrence in the dams (1500m3/s).

Both graphs shown in Figure 3 are for the same flood event. 
This event had its observed peak of  2000m3/s at 20 October 2014, 
as marked on the hydrographs. As can be observed, the Barra 
Grande HPP basin flood peaks are fast, growing from 500m3/s 
to 2000m3/s in nearly 24 hours. The graph of  Figure 3a shows 
the forecast issued in the morning of  13 October, i.e. seven 
days before the peak that actually occurred. The second graph 
(Figure 3b) shows the forecast issued on 15 October, i.e. five days 
before the peak that actually occurred. It can be observed that 
the forecast issued in 13 October correctly predicted the high 
flow event occurrence only with an error of  some hours in the 
timing of  the event. Two days later, the forecast of  15 October 
still correctly shows a streamflow peak, although the value of  the 
peak was not perfect, the forecast was very persistent on indicating 
the event occurrence.

The second event (Figure 4) corresponds to a flow peak 
of  approximately 6000 m3/s occurred at 09 October 2015. 
The possible occurrence of  a high flow at this day was predicted 
two days in advance by the forecast issued in 07 October 2014, 
presenting a flow peak near to that observed value. The flow 
peak was persistently predicted by the system one in advance, at 
08 October 2015.

The third analyzed event (Figure 5) was another inflow 
peak of  approximately 6000 m3/s occurring at 22 October 2015. 
In this case, the system alerted for possible elevated inflow events 
five days in advance (forecast issued at 17 October 2015) to the 
occurrence of  the inflow peak. The event was persistently forecasted 
in the sequence of  forecasts, as an example, at 18 October 2015, 
although with some timing lag.

The cases presented in Figures 3, 4 and 5 shows forecasts 
with reasonable quality. However, as shown in Figure 6, this pattern 
was not always observed.

Figure 6 shows a sequence of  two forecasts issued in 
respectively at 13 and 14 July 2016, both not predicting the flow 
peak of  6800 m3/s at 15 July 2016. At least at both forecasts 
the attention threshold was identified by the system, minimizing 
eventually damages related to the situation to be considered normal.

We believe that these unsuccessful forecasts were due to 
a combination of  facts: (i) the real spatial rainfall over the basin 
was not well surveyed by the existing rain gauging stations; (ii) the 
NWP model did not shows a precisely prediction of  the amounts 
of  rainfall over the basin for different lead-times; (iii) the Barra 
Grande HPP basin is very sensitive to rainfalls location, and 
possibly the forecasted rainfall was not over the most rainfall 
sensitive region of  the basin, where it truly occurred (spatial bias).

Figure 7 and Figure 8 present forecasts for two cases at 
the Campos Novos HPP. The first case (Figure 7) is a high flow 
event with 2500m3/s peak at 02 October 2014, as marked on the 
hydrographs. The first graph (Figure 7a) shows the forecast issued 
in the morning of  29 September 2014, i.e. four days before the 
peak actually occurred. The second graph (Figure 7b) shows the 
forecast issued at 02 October 2014, i.e. one day before the peak 
actually occurred. It can be seen that both forecasts persistently 
issued the occurrence of  the high flow event, with an increasing 
quality of  the recent forecasts for the peak value.

The second case (Figure 8) is part of  a sequence of  events 
with a peak inflow of  3600m3/s at 23 October 2015. The first 
graph (Figure 8a) shows the forecast issued in the morning of  
17 October 2015, with the correctly indication of  a flood over the 
threshold six days prior to the event. The second graph shows the 
forecast issued at 22 October 2015, when the inflow was already 
elevated, the flood volume occurrence was well forecasted, but 
with some overestimation in terms of  peak value and timming.

Metrics assessments

Figure 9 and Figure 10 present an analysis of  the lead time 
performance of  the hydrological forecasting system, performed 
using the metrics explained.

Regarding the results presented in Figure 9 (Barra Gande 
HPP), for lead times lower or equal to 160 hours (6,5 days) the 
NS coefficient values were positive, indicating that using model 
results as the predicted value is better than using the average of  
the observed data set until this lead time. The PC results indicate 
an important characteristic of  fast-response river basins, such 
as the upper Uruguay one, that is not very convenient use as 
a prediction the last observed values for longer than 10 hours. 
Due to this fact, auto-regressive models usually perform poorly 
in this region. The basin has a very fast response to rainfall, and

Nash Sutcliffe coefficient for flows (NS), Persistence Coefficient (PC), Mean Absolut Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error 
(RMSE).

one can have wrong forecasts if  relying only in the last observed 
flow values. This is shown by the positive values of  the PC metric 
after 10h lead times, as presented in Figure 9. By the point of  
view of  a rainfall-runoff  forecasting system, this result suports 
the developed system importance, being considered very positive.

Analysis of  the Mean Absolute Error shown in Figure 9 
(Barra Grande HPP) indicates errors lower than 310m3/s. These 
errors values can be considered low if  compared to the magnitude 
of  flooding’s, that are presented in the visual assessments 
(up to 6000m3/s). For the root mean square error, the interpretation 
of  results in terms of  lead time is similar to MAE. Also, if  we 
compare the values and behavior of  RMSE with EMA it is possible 
to say that the errors are well distributed among the forecasts and 
lead times, since they have similar curves behaviors, there are no 
greater discrepancies highlighted by the RMSE.

Regarding the results presented in Figure 10 (Canoas HPP), 
values of  the NS coefficient were positive over all lead times. 
These results showing that the model is always better than using 
average of  the observed data set, as predicted value. The results 
obtained for the PC also indicate that using the last observed 
values as the prediction is not very appropriate from 22h lead 
times ahead, in comparison to the forecasting system, since PC 
values from this lead time are always above zero.

Analysis of  the Mean Absolute Error shown in Figure 10 
(Campos Novos HPP) indicates errors lower than 255m3/s.

Figure 10. Lead time performance analysis of  the hydrological forecasting system for Campos Novos HPP using four different 
metrics: Nash Sutcliffe coefficient for flows (NS), Persistence Coefficient (PC), Mean Absolut Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square 
Error (RMSE).

Over, these errors values can be considered low if  compared 
to the magnitude of  flooding’s, that are presented in the visual 
assessments. For example, 255m3/s is less than 10% of  the flood 
peaks assessed previously. Also, this error has a relationship with 
the uncertainty of  observations that are very noise due to water 
balance back calculation in the reservoir. For the root mean square 
error, it is again possible to say that the errors are well distributed 
among the forecasts and lead times, since both metrics have similar 
curves behavior in comparison to the MAE, there are no greater 
discrepancies highlighted by the RMSE.

What are the differences and similarities within the 
forecasted systems?

Although both studied river basins are located at Uruguay’s 
headboard, they have different hydrological behavior. Regarding the 
differences on relief, the Campos Novos HPP basin has floodplain 
areas at its upper region. Regarding soil profile differences, Barra 
Gande HPP basin has less capacity of  water storage. These feature 
makes the Campos Novos HPP basin runoff  response slower 
than the Barra Grande HPP one, thus, the flood forecasting in the 
Campos Novos HPP basin usually has better results. This hypothesis 
is confirmed when we analyzed the system performance metrics 
and by the visual assessment as well.

Furthermore, rainfall forecasts play an important role on 
system performance. Since CPTEC ETA-15 km is a deterministic 
model, several forecasted rainfalls may present unknown uncertainty 
about an event magnitude and/or occurrence and about the spatial 
position of  the event within the basin. These errors were shown in 
Figure 5. This is especially important for Barra Grande HPP basin, 
because it is more sensible to rainfall spatial and temporal errors.

This kind of  analysis elucidates that in a hydro-meteorological 
forecasting system the watershed component plays a very important 
role in the forecasting performance. Even two very near regions, 
such as the ones studied here, can have a noticeable different 
performance.

Despite this, we believe that the forecasting system had 
acceptable performances during the analyzed period (since July 
2013 until July 2016) for both watersheds. The Barra Grande 
HPP and Campos Novos HPP have low MAE compared with the 
inflow floods magnitude and positive NS for longer lead times. 
CP values also shows that a forecasting system that includes 
rainfall forecasts is important due to the basin low dependency 
of  las observed values.

In comparison to analogous studies presented in the 
literature we consider that the Barra Gande HPP and the Campos 
Novos HPP forecasts have a performance like other results. 
Non-detection of  thresholds or peak values are also reported 
by Thiemig et al. (2010), Alfieri et al. (2014), Pagano (2014) and 



RBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 22, e37, 2017

Evaluation of  upper Uruguay river basin (Brazil) operational flood forecasts

Siqueira et al. (2016a) . In terms of  metrics, Pagano (2014) found 
for 1-day ahead NS values of  0.99 and CP for 1-day ahead forecasts 
typically around 0.4-0.8 and for 5-day ahead forecasts typically 
around 0.1-0.7. Those values are in the same order of  the ones 
found in the present cases, with elevated NS values at initial lead 
times, and CP values greater than zero over almost all lead-times.

CONCLUSIONS

This study showed an assessment of  results of  an 
experimental operational flow forecasting system of  the Upper 
Uruguay River basin, located in southern, Brazil. To evaluate the 
forecasting system were used the predictions produced daily from 
the model since the beginning of  its operation, in July 2013 until 
the end, in July 2016.

For the Barra Grande HPP inflow, visual assessments 
showed that the predictions have good agreement with observed 
inflows estimative, predicting the possible occurrence of  floods 
with 2 to 3 days in advance, which is normally confirmed by the 
predictions issued with smaller lead times. This is consistent with 
the performance lead time analysis, where we showed that the best 
performance of  the model is for these lead times.

For the Campos Novos HPP inflow, the results assessments 
show that the system predictions have an adequate performance 
to almost all lead times. This performance is better than the one 
observed to the Barra Grande HPP.

We would like to give highlights to results obtained with 
the persistence coefficient, which showed the importance of  
considering the rainfall-runoff  transformation in the forecast, 
what is related to the rapid response of  the basin to rainfall events. 
Also, we would like to highlight that even being very spatially 
near river basins, forecasted inflow performances are noticeable 
different between Campos Novos HPP basin and Barra Grande 
HPP basin. This gives a reference about the importance of  the 
hydrological modelling component of  the hydro-meteorological 
system.

Regardless of  the overall good results obtained, the visual 
analysis also showed that flow forecasts may result in an error. 
Based in the system operation experience, we attribute this mainly 
to the non-perception of  rainfall by the existing gauges in the 
basin and due to uncertainties at the forecasted rainfall from 
meteorological model.

To improve the shorter-term parts of  forecasts, we believe 
that one solution would be: To increase the rainfall telemetric 
gauges and using rainfall from a radar system. This would also 
need the recalibration of  the hydrological model to consider the 
new datasets.

To enhance the longer-term flow predictions a probabilistic 
forecasts test based on ensembles of  rainfall forecasts could be 
carried out using different meteorological models, each of  them 
running with different initial conditions, such the ones presented by 
Meller, Bravo and Collischonn (2012), Fan et al. (2014), Fan, Ramos 
and Collischonn (2015), or Siqueira et al. (2016a).

As well, improvements in the hydrological model and 
data assimilation schema may be useful. These suggestions will 
be the subject of  attention for forthcoming research related to 
the hydrological forecasting system of  the Uruguay River basin.
