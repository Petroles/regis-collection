.

The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-
established fact to well-established fact, never being in?uenced
by any unproved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is
made clear which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no
harm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they
suggest useful lines of research.

Acknowledgments

First of all, I want to register here my love for my family. Their kindness and
love, specially during my PhD, helped (a lot) to struggle through and live the
adventure of a thesis. I know they fought as hard as me against all the mixed
feelings between my arrivals and departures during my nomad life.

Secondly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to both my supervisors,
Ass. Prof. Pascal Dupont and Prof. Geraldo de Freitas Maciel. They encour-
aged me and my project since the begging until the very last moment, constantly
inspiring me with self-trust and scienti?c valors.

I am very grateful to all members of the jury, from both sides of the Atlantic
Ocean, Res. Dir. Alexandre Valance, Ass. Prof. Edson Del Rio, Ass. Prof. Luigi
Fraccarollo, Prof. Edith Beatriz Camano Schettini, Res. Ass. Philippe Frey,
Prof. Ana Luiza de Oliveira Borges and Ass. Prof. Erick de Moraes Franklin,
who accepted to participate and contribute to this defense.

I reserve a special thanks for my friends and colleagues Wendy, Alexandre,
Amandine, Matias, Nino, Ilham, Saly, Jianhua, Davood, Sambath, Mustapha,
Layachi, Paul, Anh Duc, Deborah, Fabiana, Evandro, André, Larissa, Juliana,
Ter, Augusto, Leticia, Cinthia, Leticia, Felipe and everybody else that at some
point exchanged some words of support and ordinary daily life with me. For their
support, patience and, above all, their friendship, my sincere thanks. Without
them I don't think I would be able to endure and persevere in front of every
obstacle that have crossed my path. And I know I'm not easy guys... ;-)

I cannot leave all sta? from the PPGEM, LGCGM &amp;amp; GCU without my deep-
est thanks. Nathalie, Emmanuelle, Jacqueline, Jean-Luc, Jean-Yves, Raphael,
Anne, Carole, Etienne, Christian, Franck, Onilda, Marcia, Graciele, Rafael, all
of them participate in this whole process and for their professional support (et
aussi pour les précieux moments de papotage/e também pelos momentos de jogar
conversa fora) they hold my gratitude.

I thank also the researchers and professors from PPGEM, LH2, LGCGM and
IPR, for their open minds and for sharing their knowledge. That's how I believe
Science is done.

At last, but not least, I'm very grateful to every chaotic event in the Universe
that allowed me to get this far.

3.2 Example of discontinuous transport and anomalous di?usion of mass
due to non-constant stress applied. Sediment transport can only
happen if ?ow applies enough stress to overcome particle submerged
weight, represented by a threshold velocity uc. Turbulent ?uctuations
can interfere with continuous state of transport when mean ?ow is
close to particles threshold velocity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43

Abstract

On unsteady open-channel flows:

a contribution to non-stationary sediment transport in

runoff flows and to unstable non-Newtonian mudflow

studies

This thesis was motivated by the need to better understand time-dependent fea-
tures related to mud?ow evolution on natural sloped channels. Basically, the
research is focused on events that are con?ned in channels formed due to the
topography. The rain, source of the liquid discharge, generates the runo? ?ow
which is responsible for wetting the soil surface, promoting reduction of soil co-
hesiveness and erosion of small particles such as clay and sand. From this point,
the sediment transport can increase as small water ?ows merge and form greater
streams. The scenario keeps its evolution until it reaches high concentration of
particles in the ?uid mixture.

In the ?rst part, to study the non-permanent feature of sediment transport, an
open-channel experiment was designed for simulating runo? ?ow over a mobile
bed. A measurement system was designed and constructed to instantaneously
inspect the solid discharge of particles and the ?ow friction at the bed. This
apparatus is further used to explore the in?uence of free-surface waves on the
sediment transport. Hydraulic properties of ?ows are qualitatively and quantita-
tively studied and data are used to correlate characteristics of ?ow and sediment
transport. A set of experimental runs is presented and explored. Analysis of
results shows that for ?xed ?ow conditions, waves induce an overall smaller quan-
tity of transported sediment.

In a second part, the dynamics of high concentrated ?ows is addressed and
this thesis attempts to apply a ?rst-order roll-wave model for Herschel-Bulkley
laminar ?uid ?ow to a registered natural event. Results presented point out that
roll waves could have occurred during this already published case-study event.
Simulations could predict wave heights within 8% on uncertainty with respect
to the mean amplitude of measured waves. Finally a new theoretical solution
for the velocity pro?le is proposed taking into account the porosity of the bed.
Results are then compared with numerical simulation performed in FLUENT. A
parametric analysis is employed and the case-study is once again evaluated.

As general conclusion, the non-permanent phenomena that can appear during

the evolution of a mud?ow event a?ect the overall dynamics of the coupled system

(hydraulic-sediment transport) in comparison to the steady and uniform case.

Verifying that such phenomena could appear should indeed be an important part

in hydraulic engineering projects, especially when dealing with lives, which is the

case of mud?ows.

Resumo

Escoamentos não-permanentes de superfície livre : uma

contribuição para o estudo do transporte não estacionário

de sedimentos em escoamentos superficiais e para

instabilidades em corridas de lamas

Dentro da temática de riscos naturais, mais precisamente no contexto das corri-
das de lama, esta tese surge da necessidade que existe na literatura em melhor
se conhecer as características temporais destes eventos. A chuva, fonte da vazão
liquida, conduz aos escoamentos super?ciais, responsáveis pela redução da co-
esão do material sedimentar do solo (areia e argila) e seu consequente transporte.
Em locais de topogra?a íngreme, de montante a jusante, a vazão sólida do es-
coamento principal pode, eventualmente, evoluir devido às contribuições laterais
de pequenos escoamentos, alterando não só as propriedades reológicas do ?uido
e dinâmicas do escoamento, como se manter até que o transporte sólido atinja
elevada concentração na composição do ?uido.

Na primeira parte desta tese, um experimento de superfície livre foi projetado
para reproduzir escoamentos super?ciais sobre um fundo móvel, com o objetivo de
estudar propriedades não-permanentes do transporte de sedimentos. Um sistema
de medição foi projetado e construído com o intuito de medir quase instanta-
neamente a vazão solida e suas correlações com as propriedades hidráulicas do
escoamento. Este aparato é também utilizado para observar a in?uência de in-
stabilidades de superfície livre sobre o transporte. Um conjunto de resultados
é apresentado e analisado e mostra que a presença de ondas pode, em média,
reduzir a quantidade total de sedimentos transportada.

Na segunda parte desta tese, a dinâmica de escoamentos com elevada concen-
tração de sedimentos é estudada. Neste trabalho, executa-se a aplicação de um
modelo de primeira ordem de roll waves para ?uidos de reologia Herschel-Bulkley
para simular um evento natural registrado na literatura. Os resultados apresen-
tados mostram que roll waves poderiam, de fato, ser identi?cadas no evento e
que a amplitude média observada poderia ter sido estimada com 8% de incerteza.
Assim, um modelo mais complexo para a solução do per?l de velocidade é pro-
posto, adicionando a porosidade do solo ao problema. Resultados do modelo são
comparados com simulações numéricas. Uma análise paramétrica é efetuada e o
caso de estudo é novamente avaliado.

Como conclusão geral do trabalho, a presença de fenômenos não-estacionários

durante a evolução escoamento super?cial ? corrida de lama afeta a dinâmica

global do sistema acoplado hidráulica-transporte de sedimentos, quando com-

parado ao caso permanente e uniforme. Assim, a veri?cação de que tais fenô-

menos podem aparecer deve constituir parte de projetos engenharia, especial-

mente quando estes, em situações de catástrofes, envolvem danos a infraestru-

Des écoulements instationnaires à surface libre:

contribution aux études du transport instationnaire de

sédiments en écoulement ruisselant et des instabilités de

coulées de boue non-newtonienne

Aperçu général

Chapitre 1 - Les écoulements naturels et les risques associés

Les catastrophes naturelles peuvent être décrites comme le résultat de
l'interaction défavorable entre un événement naturel et une communauté
vulnérable. Elles sont le résultats de la convolution des paramètres météo-
rologique, géologique/géomorphologie et anthropique. Cette thèse, ?nancée
par le gouvernement brésilien, se situe dans ce contexte général lié aux
risques naturels. Dans les dernières années, le Brésil a été l'hôte de nom-
breux événements naturels tels que des inondations et des glissements de
terrain (Pinho et al., 2013). A la saison des pluies, entre les mois de décem-
bre et de février, la région de la Serra do Mar, une région montagneuse
à forte déclivité appartenant aux départements du Sud-Ouest brésilien, a
subi un type d'événement naturel qui est souvent la cause de catastrophe:
les coulées de boue. Les catastrophes qui y ont eu lieu sont considéré par le
gouvernement brésilien comme les plus grandes qu'est subi le pays. A titre
d'exemple, nous faisons appel aux événements de la région cotière du dé-
partement de Rio de Janeiro en 2011 (Guidugli et al., 2012) et de São Paulo
(voir Figure 1.1). Dans cette thèse, des aspects de ce type de phénomène
sont étudiés.

Les coulées de boue peuvent avoir di?érentes évolutions, mais deux mé-
canismes principaux sont mis en avant:

• déstabilisation de la pente saturé d'eau, et liquéfaction abrupte du
sol, ce qui forme un front de masse à haut débit ?uide;

• incorporation graduelle de matière sédimentaire au sein de l'écoulement,
qui peut, selon la géométrie, augmenter dû à l'union des a?uents,
jusqu'à ce que le ?uide devienne très chargé en sédiments.

xxii



Résumé étendu

Dans le cadre de cette thèse, nous nous intéressons au deuxième cas,
que nous appelons les coulées de boue graduellement développées. Ce type
d'évolution d'un événement peut alors être décrit par quatre étapes (voir
Figure 1.2):

I précipitations de forte intensité sur la topographie escarpée. La satu-
ration rapide du sol conduit au ruissellement sur la zone;

II le ruissellement sur les régions concaves du bassin érode peu à peu le
sol, produit des ravines, et transporte de la matière sédimentaire vers
l'aval et les a?uents plus importants;

III quelque part, les ruissellements aboutissent un débit intermédiaire
important capable d'éroder de plus en plus de sédiments;

IV très en aval, au pieds de la montagne, les a?uents se rejoignent et
constituent un écoulements très chargé en sédiments qui peut être
désormais appelé coulée de boue.

D'après les théories de la mécanique des ?uides, les ruissellements com-
pris dans les étapes II et III peuvent être étudiés comme des écoulements
turbulent d'eau claire avec transport de sédiments. Le problème primor-
dial dans ce cas est de connaître la quantité de sédiments transporté par
l'écoulement. Cette mesure indiquerait la vitesse auquel le processus

d'évolution se passerait (graduelle augmentation de l'entrainement de
sédiments), et à quel moment l'étape IV serait aboutie. Cependant, la
prédiction de cette quantité est toujours un sujet actuel dans la recherche
scienti?que. En d'autres termes, le transport de sédiments n'est pas encore
un phénomène totalement dévoilé. Étant donné la nature turbulente de ces
écoulements, plusieurs source de non-stationnarité peuvent être présentes.
Ces instabilités et leur e?ets induisent des incertitudes sur les modèles de
masse solide transportée.

Parallèlement, l'étape IV est caractérisée par un écoulement plus dense,
où les propriétés visqueuse du ?uide diverge de celles de l'eau. Sur la con-
?guration de coulée de boue, l'écoulement est normalement laminaire et son
évolution peut être établi d'après des lois du mouvement plus simples. Par
contre, le problème qui se pose est de connaître les propriétés de la mixture
eau-sédiments, un problème fortement étudié dans la littérature (Coussot,
1994; Ancey, 2007). Par ailleurs, certains types d'instabilités de surface
libre peuvent apparaître dans ce cas. La présence d'instabilités au sein de
l'écoulement va augmenter la variabilité spatio-temporel de l'événement et

tels que les hauteurs de l'écoulement ou ses vitesse.

Cette thèse développe deux études indépendantes, participants à améliorer
deux aspects du phénomènes de coulée de boue: une étude expérimentale
du transport sédimentaire d'écoulements ruisselants en régime turbulent
et présence d'ondes ; et une étude théorique-numérique sur les coulées de
boue en régime laminaire instable. Le but est de comprendre comment
les phénomènes instationnaires vont intervenir dans l'évolution potentielle
coulée de boue.

Chapitre 2 - Cadre théorique général

Les écoulements à surface libre peuvent être modélisés mathématiquement
avec les lois de conservation de masse et de quantité de mouvement. Le
tenseur de contrainte dans le ?uide est adapté en fonction de la concen-
tration en sédiments dans la mixture ?uide-sédiments. Par conséquence,
la dynamique de l'événement, turbulent ou laminaire, est fortement in?u-
encé par les conditions du problème étudié et la capacité de l'écoulement
à entraîner des sédiments. Des grandeurs adimensionnelles telles comme le
nombre de Reynolds, de Froude et de Shields sont utilisées pour représenter
ces dynamiques ?uides et sédimentaires.

Le ruissellement (écoulement mince, turbulent, à faible concentration
de sédiments) et les coulées de boue (écoulements laminaire à forte con-
centration de sédiments) peuvent être mis sur le même diagramme ou les
paramètres en jeu sont le taux de déformation et la concentration de solide
au sein de la mixture (voir Figure 2.2, d'après Coussot and Ancey (1999)).
Pourtant, le diagramme ne prévoit pas le passage d'un type d'écoulement à
l'autre. L'une des questions initiales à l'origine de cette thèse est l'existence
d'un passage/évolution continu entre ces deux régimes. Ce passage semble
possible grâce à la pente du chenal. D'après Berzi and Fraccarollo (2013),
la distribution vertical (concentration) de sédiments est contrôlée par la
déclivité du chenal, paramètre qui joue un important rôle sur la stabilité
de l'écoulement. En fonction des caractéristiques géométriques, du débit
et du ?uide, les écoulements à surface libre peuvent être susceptibles à de
développer des phénomènes d'instabilités de surface. Parmi les instabilités
possibles, un type particulier est souvent relié aux événements de mou-
vement de masse: les roll waves. Il s'agit d'un train d'ondes de grandes
amplitudes qui se forme lorsque les conditions sont favorables. Ces ondes
viennent a?ecter la dynamique du transport (Davies, 1990; Colombini and

ruissellement

Chapitre 3 - Introduction

Plusieurs travaux de recherche trouvés dans la littérature montrent que
les phénomènes instationnaires ont un e?et important sur la dynamique
du transport. Les ruptures de barrage (Fraccarollo and Capart, 2002),
l'imminence du transport (Ancey et al., 2006), les structures du lit mobile
(Colombini and Stocchino, 2005) et les ondes de surface libre (Kranen-
burg et al., 2013) sont quelques exemples de phénomènes variables dans le
temps et dans l'espace qui sont déterminants. Pour étudier ces problèmes,
l'approche expérimentale constitue un outil puissant, capable de donner des
indices utiles à la compréhension des phénomènes physiques. Les mesures
nécessaires pour développer l'étude du transport instationnaire de sédiments
doivent être capables de donner des informations temporelles à la fois sur
l'écoulement et sur transport lui-même, à l'échelle du ruissellement. Une
estimation rapide de ces échelles du problème permet de comprendre les
enjeux techniques de l'exécution de ce travail (Amir et al., 2014).

Chapitre 4 - La méthode expérimentale

Un banc de ruissellement a été conçu et construit lors de ce thèse. Ce
banc permet la génération des écoulement ruisselants et la mesure de ses
propriétés (hauteur d'eau, débit massique). Le chenal a une section rectan-
gulaire et un fond rugueux ?xe où l'écoulement turbulent se développe et
atteint un régime uniforme. A la ?n de ce fond ?xe, un lit mobile est in-
stallé, où le sédiment-test est disposé. L'écoulement turbulent établi arrive
ainsi au lit mobile et transporte les grains vers l'aval, où un piège est placé.
Ce piège permet la capture des grains et leur visualisation de manière à
quanti?er le transport.

Les mesures plus ?nes des propriétés de l'écoulement et du transport
solide sont faites à l'aide des techniques d'imagerie. Un système de ve-
locimétrie à partir des images de traceurs (Particle Image Velocimetry
? PIV) permet l'obtention des caractéristiques de l'écoulement et la valida-

Résumé étendu

tion de ses propriétés turbulentes. Un système de suivi de particules (Par-
ticle Tracking Velocimetry ? PTV) au niveau du piège horizontal fournit
les informations de débit solide au cours du temps. Le système PTV a été
conçu en prenant comme base les expériences rapportés dans la littérature
par Frey et al. (2003). La méthodologie PTV permet obtenir la vitesse des
particules piégées et ainsi le débit solide (voir équation 4.20 et 4.24). Pour
étudier les écoulements perturbés (écoulements où il y a le passage d'ondes
de surface libre), un système de batteur a été installé en amont du chenal,
il permet la génération de perturbation à des fréquences contrôlées. Une
analyse des résultats de la méthode est présentée pour valider la qualité des
résultats obtenus. L'in?uence des propriétés des grains, de la qualité des
images et du signal obtenu sont évalués.

Chapitre 5 - L'e?et de la turbulence sur le transport de sédiments

Une série de résultats expérimentaux est présentée où les caractéristiques du
transport solide sont mise en avance. Trois études principales sont menées:
le débit moyen en fonction du nombre de Shields; les distributions spectrales
de puissance des signaux; l'intensité des ?uctuations du transport solide.

L'intensité des ?uctuations du transport solide montrent le même type
de loi empirique que celle utilisée pour le débit solide moyen quand on les
relie aux intensités de ?uctuations de la vitesse de frottement. la dernière
analyse portée sur les ?uctuations de débit solide, illustré par la ?gure 5.11,
permet de conclure que loin du seuil de mise en transport (Sh &gt; 4Shc),
le niveau de ?uctuations est à peu près constant et suis les propriétés de
l'écoulement moyen.

L'analyse sur les propriétés moyennes montrent que les mesures sont
en accord avec des lois empiriques classiques de la littérature (Meyer-Peter
and Müller, 1948; Wong and Parker, 2006) (voir Figure 5.10). Une analyse
des densités spectrales de puissance (PSD) permet trouver de mettre en
évidence la sensibilité du transport aux propriétés de l'écoulement proche
de la paroi. Pour les écoulements proches du seuil de mise en mouvement
(Sh &amp;lt;2.5Shc), on aperçoit une loi de décroissance des PSD à la puissance
?1 avec la fréquence. Ce résultat serait en concordance avec d'autres de la
littérature qui prévoyaient que le transport par charriage est contrôlé par
les structures turbulentes proches de la paroi (qui ont cette même loi de
décroissance ?1). En revanche, la loi de décroissance passe à la puissance
?5/3 pour les écoulements à nombres de Shields plus forts pour lesquels

xxvi



Résumé étendu

les perturbations tridimensionnelles du lit mobile sont plus fortes (voir ??).
Même si le transport solide se fait par charriage, ces résultats montrent
que, lors de la présence des structures morphologiques du lit, la dynamique
turbulente contrôle les ?uctuations du transport solide.

Chapitre 6 - Écoulement perturbé

A l'aide du batteur placé en amont, une perturbation de la surface libre
est générée et les mesures sont analysés de la même façon qu'au chapitre
précédent. L'analyse de la quantité moyenne de masse transportée indique
qu'il y a une diminution de la capacité de transport de l'écoulement ().
Pour un nombre de Shields donné, l'écoulement perturbé a un débit solide
moyen moins important que l'écoulement stationnaire non perturbé. Nous
discutons les possibles causes de ce phénomène en s'appuyant sur résul-
tats dans la littérature pour le pro?l de frottement d'un écoulement avec la
presence des instabilités de surface libre type roll waves. Nous montrons le
frottement moyen lors du passage d'une onde décroit et est plus faible que
ce de l'écoulement moyen. Les densités spectrales de puissance ne présen-
tent aucun changement signi?catif par rapport aux intensités et aux loi de
décroissance trouvées pour l'écoulement pas perturbé. Elles corroborent les
résultats précédents.

Deuxième Partie - Les écoulements non-Newtoniens sur

un sol naturel

Chapitre 7 - Introduction

Dans cette deuxième partie de la thèse, un travail d'ingénierie est initiale-
ment engagé pour appliquer un modèle mathématique à la prévision d'un
événement naturel. On se servira d'un modèle constitué préalablement (Ma-
ciel et al., 2013) pour estimer les caractéristiques des ondes de surface libre
type roll waves au sein d'un écoulement boueux (mixture eau et sédiments)
de propriétés non-Newtoniennes type Herschel-Bulkley. Une étude de cas
est faite à partir d'un événement mesuré et décrit dans la littérature par
Berti et al. (1999, 2000).

Résumé étendu

Chapitre 8 - Application d'un modèle mathématique à un
événements naturel: l'étude de cas de Acquabona

Dans ce chapitre, le modèle pris en considération est brièvement décrit.
Dans ce modèle, les équations de conservations sont manipulés en prenant le
modèle rhéologique Herschel-Bulkley pour le ?uide. Les principaux paramètres
caractéristiques de l'écoulement sont rappelés comme, par exemple, la vitesse
moyenne, la vitesse super?cielle et la hauteur de plug. La méthodologie
d'utilisation du modèle est systématiquement présentée (voir ?gure 7.1).
Une étape importante consiste à véri?er que l'écoulement respecte quelques
conditions: le régime doit être laminaire; les hypothèses d'eau peu profonde
doivent être applicables; l'écoulement doit être instable. L'obtention des
paramètres d'entrées est l'une des tâches les plus importantes. Vu qu'il
s'agit d'un modèle laminaire, les caractéristiques du ?uide vont avoir une
importance cruciale sur les résultats. Le site d'Acquabona est décrit en
mettant l'accent sur les propriétés qui seront décisives pour la bonne ob-
tention des paramètres d'entrée.

Une fois les paramètres d'entrée estimés, les instabilités de surface li-
bre sont simulées et comparées avec les résultats présentés par Berti et al.
(2000). La sensibilité aux propriétés rhéologiques est évalué. Comme les
ondes mesurées par les auteurs représentent un phénomène naturel et que
le modèle mathématique correspond aux propriétés d'une onde en régime
permanent et uniforme, une comparaison directe n'est pas possible. Ceci
dit, l'amplitude moyenne des ondes mesurées est comparée au modèle, ce
qui donne une di?érence de valeurs de 8%. Ce résultat montre une ro-
bustesse du modèle à prévoir une valeur caractéristique de l'événement na-
turel. Dernièrement, un diagramme a été produit (voir Figure 7.7) pour ex-
pliciter l'importance de considérer un modèle mathématique pour la prévi-
sion d'un tel événement naturel de mouvement de masse.

Chapitre 9 - La recherche d'un modèle plus complexe

Après avoir véri?é la qualité des résultats d'un modèle établi dans la lit-
térature, nous avons poursuit la recherche d'un modèle mathématique plus
complexe. Cela nous a mené à intégrer l'e?et de la porosité dans le prob-
lème, étant donné que la solution mathématique d'un écoulement à surface
libre d'un ?uide non-newtonien type Herschel-Bulkley sur un fond poreux
n'était pas encore complètement dé?nie.

xxviii



Résumé étendu

Le modèle proposé par Beavers and Joseph (1967) pour un ?uide new-
tonien est utilisé comme base. Grâce au travail de Chevalier et al. (2013), les
conditions limites pour l'écoulement d'un ?uide type Herschel-Bulkley dans
un milieu poreux ont pû être mieux comprises. D'autres études comme
celles de Chhabra et al. (2001), Rao and Mishra (2004) et Pascal (2006)
pour les ?uides qui présentent des lois rhéologiques de type loi de puissance
ont permis d'adapter les conditions limites exigées par le problème. Dans
ce cadre, le modèle mathématique est développé et détaillé. La solution
analytique pour le problème posé est ainsi donnée. Le pro?l de vitesse,
donné par l'équation 8.17, véri?e les solutions obtenues auparavant pour les
?uides de rhéologie moins complexes.

Chapitre 10 - Simulations numérique

Pour valider la solution analytique obtenue, des simulations numériques
sur FLUENT ont été faites. Les simulations ont respecté la con?guration
géométrique utilisée par Prinos et al. (2003) et Chan et al. (2007). Les ?u-
ides test utilisés avaient des propriétés réels qui reproduisaient les mixtures
de Carbopol utilisés expérimentalement par Roberts and Barnes (2001) et
Leite (2009) (voir tableaux 9.2).

Les résultats obtenus numériquement montrent que la vitesse dans le
milieux poreux est du même ordre de grandeur que celle prévue par le
modèle. En ce qui concerne la solution du pro?l de vitesse de l'écoulement
au-dessus du fond, le modèle mathématique est capable de reproduire les
valeurs caractéristique de vitesse de plug (u(z = z0)) et de vitesse au fond
(u(z = 0)) avec un écart faible de 1 et 5%, respectivement. Des analy-
ses mathématiques faites à posteriori illustrent les e?ets du paramètre de
porosité sur la solution, ainsi que l'e?et combiné entre la porosité et les
propriétés rhéologique du matériau.

Chapitre 11 - Retour à l'étude de cas d'Acquabona

Finalement, après avoir étudier comment la porosité peut modi?er l'écoulement,
l'étude de cas d'Acquabona est à nouveau traité. Les paramètres de porosité
sont assumés à des valeurs classiques et la courbe h0 X q0 est complétée. Vis-
à-vis des e?ets de porosité assez faible pour le cas d'Acquabona, les résultats
montrent une légère di?érence, qui serait négligeable si l'on considère les in-
certitudes des paramètres d'entrée du modèle.

Natural flows and risks

Debris ?ows (also referred to as mudslides, mud?ows, or de-
bris avalanches) generally occur during intense rainfall on wa-
ter saturated soil. They usually start on steep hillsides as soil
slumps or slides that liquefy and accelerate to speeds as great as
35 miles (56 km) per hour. Multiple debris ?ows that start high
in canyons commonly funnel into channels. There, they merge,
gain volume, and travel long distances from their source.

1.1 Introduction

Natural hazards, generally speaking, can be described as the result from
the interaction between natural phenomena and vulnerable human societies.
They are the convolution of meteorological, geological/geomorphological ef-
fects with anthropic actions leading to damages perceived by society. They
emerge as worldwide events, result as the interaction between many factors
such as global warming, landscape usage and misguided urban management,
which happens to a?ect every part of the globe (Burton, 2005). More specif-
ically, in Brazil, people have confronted successive natural events such as
?oods and landslides year after year during the rainy season (Pinho et al.,
2013). In South and Southeast regions, another kind of mass movement
event also takes place: mud?ows. It usually happens during the rainy sea-
son and over Serra do Mar, the mountain range that extends along the shore
(Guidicini and Nieble, 1984). According to Brazilian Ministry of Science
and Technology, landslides and mud?ows are the greatest cause of death

among all Brazilian natural hazards.

As matter of meteorological phenomena, on the Southeast Region of
Brazil, a particular one takes place during the warm season called South
Atlantic Convergence Zone - SACZ (Zona de Convergência do Atlântico
Sul), which is often responsible for hazardous events in the country. It
appears mostly late spring and during summer and is responsible for high
precipitation levels, around 200 mm in a couple of hours. This phenomenon
is represented by a local maximum level in cloudiness and precipitation
across an elongated axis oriented in a Northwest-Southeast manner over
South Amazônia, Southeast and West-Center Brazilian regions reaching
the Atlantic Ocean.

Figure 1.1: Photos from Brazilian largest natural hazards.

The topography of the region a?ected by SACZ helps maintaining the
strength of the event, mainly on the Southeast region where a mountains
range called Serra do Mar blocks the passage of clouds. Exactly in this
region we ?nd the Rio de Janeiro's state mountain region where a massive
hazard took place in 2011. Heavy rains (200 to 300 mm in just few hours)
considerably reduced cohesiveness of the thin layer of soil, allowing an enor-
mous volume of muddy material to ?ow down the hills and devastate areas
downstream. Clearly, the mis-occupation and anthropic action were impor-
tant factors for the dramatic consequences. According to statement released
by Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro State, on January 28th, 8.777 homeless,
more than 20 thousand dislodged, 950 dead and 430 missing people were
estimated (Guidugli et al., 2012). This last event is now considered as the
largest Brazilian natural hazard since the event of Caraguatatuba city, in

1.1. Introduction

March 1967. At that time, São Paulo state northern coast faced a long
rainy period; rivers over?owed and were strong enough to drag trees and
civil constructions in ?ooded zones; mud and rocks fell down the hills on
successive landslides burying entire houses. The event resulted in great
?nancial losses and death of 500 people (Rebello et al., 2012), thus point-
ing out the importance of researching such matter in order to avoid such
disastrous consequences from happening again. Both events are shown on
Figure 1.1. Correctly developing models and predicting evolution of such
events might help stakeholders to better estimate risks and ?nd more argu-
ments to develop more e?cient policies.

Mud?ows are mass movement events that are triggered by intense rain-
fall and usually start in the upper part of mountains where slopes are
stronger. One important feature from ?owing ?uid is that it is basically
composed by water with high concentration of sediments (thus di?erent
viscous properties). The source material that constitute the ?owing mate-
rial comes from the soil, basically sediment from di?erent origins (silt, clay
and sand in di?erent concentrations). The mixture have then high density
which combined with strong slopes, leads to an extremely rapid ?ow with
high kinetic energy and considerable high velocity (mean velocity 5 m/s (18
km/h), up to 10 m/s (36 km/h) (Hungr et al., 2001) ).

As far as it is known, gravity-driven mass movement are far to be com-
pletely understood by scienti?c community. The knowledge of such kind of
?ow is clearly necessary to enhance prevention tools for Engineering when
applied to modeling natural events such as mud?ows, mud ?oods and de-
bris ?ow. Two main scenarios for mud?ows generation can be described
(Oliveira and Brito, 1998; Chambon et al., 2010):

• sudden ?uidi?cation of saturated soil after complete fail of slopes,
leading to a massive discharge of solid material at once;

• gradual incorporation of soil into tributaries from the watershed, from
upstream to downstream the basin, which can join greater streams and
increase in discharge and erosion, thus gradually leading to a stream
of muddy material.

The ?rst, which we should call here suddenly developed mud?ow, can be
analogously compared to a dam-break event in which a ?uid is suddenly
released and moves rapidly downstream. The second, gradually developed
mud?ow have a slower evolution, maturing along the watershed, incorporat-
ing sediment material and changing its dynamics. In this work, the second

5



1. Natural flows and risks

scenario is explored. As a hydro-geological process, three main features can
be identi?ed in the study of mud?ows formation:

• rainfall duration and intensity;

• soil characteristics;

• topography.

Rainfall is the triggering mechanism for mass movements such as mud-
?ows, lahar ?ows, and landslides. For landslides, for example, a stable soil
layer saturates with water during a rainy event, acquiring a certain level
of ?uidity. Eventually, if the ?uidity level is high enough, the soil will fail
and move. This kind of event could be present during a suddenly devel-
oped mud?ow, contributing to the increase in sediment concentration in
the ?ow. Rainfall also relates to runo? discharge, directly related to ?ow
capacity of transporting sediments in soil. For such scenario, there is an
increase in momentum, therefore kinetic energy, related to the ?ow which
is established over a saturated soil, as veri?ed by Iverson et al. (2011). In
any case, natural vegetation cover and land use (arable ?elds, pastures, soil
sealing, etc.) also a?ect ?ow friction laws, becoming a great issue in regions
without proper sustainable environmental management.

1.2 Phenomenological description

The gradually developed mud?ow event scenario can be separated in four
main stages:

I high intensity rainfall over a steep topography. Increased water ab-
sorption by soil and fast saturation of it leads rapidly to runo?;

II initial runo? is established in concave areas from the watershed and
erodes its way down in gullies, transporting ?ne materials down-
stream, reaching greater tributaries;

III intermediary runo? continuously erode the soil, increasing in solid
concentration and discharge, forming sometimes ravines and/or creeks;

IV rainfall peak is reached and the result of the uni?cation of tributaries
forms of a main stream with increased discharge and high sediment
concentration, achieving the status of mud?ow.

1. Natural flows and risks

From a mechanical approach, the runo? ?ow established during the ini-
tial and intermediary stage can be de?ned, in most of the cases, as turbulent
?ow of almost clean water. Sometimes, in the presence of vegetation, con-
striction of paths and even topography (convex areas), the ?ow can be thin
and/or narrow, creating a thin layer of ?ow with intermediary dynamic be-
tween laminar and turbulent (Strahler, 1952). Due to the increased slope,
mean ?ow velocities are su?ciently strong to have considerable capacity of
transporting ?ne sediment material.

Depending on ?ow dynamics and sediment properties, transport mode
of sediment in such ?ows can achieve di?erent forms: sediment can rest in
contact with the bottom (bed load), eventually jump and/or project itself
into the ?ow (saltation), or completely be carried away by ?ow (suspension).
For runo?, transport mechanisms of ?ne sediments are mainly bedload and
saltation, sometimes praising suspension when ?ow occurs over clayey soil.
However, as ?ow discharge in gullies are relatively small, volume concen-
tration of solid in ?uid do not exceed 8% in the composition of the ?uid,
thus keeping it as a Newtonian ?uid (Graf and Altinakar, 2000).

In the last stage, the established mud?ow usually diverge its viscous
properties from the initial stage, since the increase in discharge made pos-
sible to carry more sediments along with ?ow. Despite the relatively high
velocity achieved in such ?ows, they are usually laminar, with a completely
di?erent dynamic from the initial and intermediary stage (Coussot, 1994;
Coussot and Piau, 1994).

Some questions may arise when dealing with those natural event such
as:

• mud?ow success of generation, i.e. whether the three main features
said before (rainfall, soil and topography) convolute to lead to a so to
speak mud?ow event;

• once the event is established, what would be the properties of ?nal
stage event (?ow and ?uid properties);

The ?rst addressed question can sometimes be answered for suddenly
generated events if quanti?ed values are obtained for the three main fea-
tures involved in the mud?ow generation (precipitation, soil and topogra-
phy). With su?cient information about the soil, one can determine how
much water will ?ow over the surface and how much will be the seepage of

8



1.2. Phenomenological description

water through the soil. Given the topography, it is possible to run models
of stability and determine whether dislodge volume of solid and water will
form a ?continuous? ?ux of mud along the basin (Luna et al., 2011; Gomes
et al., 2008; van Asch et al., 2007).

However, the gradually generated events scenario is theoretically ?weaker?,
with a ?ow that has a hypothetic maximum capacity of transport sediment
material (Graf and Altinakar, 2000). Thus, the sediment transport during
runo? has to be properly estimated to allow correctly prediction on how
fast ?ow dynamics would change (from turbulent clean water to laminar
muddy ?uid ?ow). Of course this matter also depends on topography and
increase in discharge (so ?ow capacity of transport would increase), but
predictions on sediment transport for free surface ?ows are still a matter
of discussion in the scienti?c community and this work takes part on such
matter and addresses the e?ect of ?uctuations of ?ow dynamic properties
on the transport.

In the other hand, ?ow and ?uid properties in the ?nal stage of the
event should be the major data required. One can relate ?ow properties
(such as height and velocity) with energy level and thus destructive capac-
ity of events (Zeng et al., 2015) although few works seem to develop such
approach. However, ?ow properties only make sense as long as we know
what ?uid we are dealing with. In fact, ?uid properties generally indicate
how ?ow will behave, thus pointing out that they must be primarily quan-
ti?ed to estimate ?ow properties. We must recall that ?uid properties of
mixtures must be studied from a rheological point of view which shows
that such muddy material behave very di?erently from water. Apart from
the ?uid itself, the geometry of the channel and its properties also play an
important role to determine ?ow properties. Nevertheless, ?ow properties
are not restrict to mean values. Usually in natural events, many types of
unsteady phenomena can have place during the event.

For the initial runo? stage, given the turbulent nature of the ?ow, many
are the sources responsible for non-stationary phenomena and unsteadi-
ness. The turbulent ?uctuations present in such ?ows are themselves an
important source of time and spatial variations of velocity property. It is
known that sediment transport occurring due to steady and uniform turbu-
lent ?ows do present variability of solid discharge (Frey et al., 2003; Ancey
et al., 2008). Free surface ?ows such as those can be easily disturbed (by
topography, rain, etc.) and lead to formation of surface instabilities (i.e.
variation of ?ow properties along time and space). Di?erently from empiri-

9



1. Natural flows and risks

cal laws established for steady and permanent ?ows, transport phenomenon
doesn't happen the same way, as signi?cant variations of stress applied over
grains are identi?ed and grains develop horizontal acceleration. Conversely,
recalling the suddenly developed mud?ows, it is possible to model it as a
dam break ?ow, in which an abrupt variation of ?ow properties is propagate
downstream.

Specially, a particular kind of free surface instability can appear in both
scenarios, runo? and mud?ow. This instability, usually called roll wave, is
de?ned as steep periodic surges, propagating downstream in stabilized form,
i.e. with constant wave properties (amplitude, wavelength and propagation
velocity). Such waves appear naturally if ?ow conditions are favorable and
random disturbances applied to ?ow by environment are inside a proper
range. Low/high disturbances are ampli?ed/damped until permanent con-
?guration is reached, after traveling a certain channel length. Such waves
receive a particular name called roll waves.

From the hydraulic perspective, regarding turbulent ?ows, these waves
appear like hydraulic jumps, i.e. transitions between ?uvial to torrential
?ow. Widely known, such structure is highly dissipative and could in-
duce many di?erent levels of risks depending on nearby civil infrastructure.
When present in runo?, less is known about roll waves, whether they appear,
if they contribute to the sediment transport, or how they interact in the for-
mation of gullies and ravines. They can be perceived as non-constant ?ow
but how such feature interacts with the mobile bed structure still rests not
completely understood. Much more is known about roll waves in mud?ows.
Zanuttigh and Lamberti (2007) for example summarizes much of what is
found in the literature about such events. The challenge however is: ?rst,
approximate models to the realistic problem, given its complexity; second,
associate its presence with risks incurred by endangered societies. Despite
of the fact that no proof of roll waves appearance have been noticed on
Brazilian territory, other countries like New Zealand, China, Switzerland
and Italy have already con?rmed presence of surges and wave trains on
mud?ows over mountain regions (Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007).

1.3. Objectives

1.3 Objectives

The question addressed in this research is an issue that interest not only
Brazilian Government1 but world communities: how unsteady ?ow dy-
namical properties (from turbulence or roll waves) would change
the evolution of one potential mud?ow? Upstream, when runo? takes
place, how turbulent properties a?ect the variability found in total amount
of sediment transport? Furthermore, how would surface instabilities (spe-
cially roll waves) change (or not) sediment transport dynamics? And down-
stream, where mud?ow is developed, can we satisfactorily predict roll waves
properties based on the most realistic scenario? The answer to these ques-
tions should help understand how important are such hydraulic instabilities
for a precise evaluation of a potential mud?ow event. From an Engineer-
ing perspective, the better we know about a problem and time-dependent
phenomena that are related to it, the more precisely we can predict those
events characteristics and thus optimize process, design structures, and re-
duce social and ?nancial losses.

This thesis brings a work that will try to answer these questions by two
di?erent approaches on two di?erent stages of an event:

• a laboratory experiment for turbulent open-channel ?ow over a mo-
bile bed of sediments, looking for the source of sediment transport
variations and trying to understand what happen when surfaces in-
stabilities are present;

• a second approach will study roll waves main properties from a the-
oretical approach, based on the mud?ow con?guration, ?owing down
an inclined porous bed, and will try to verify the validity of such
model based on in situ measurements.

This thesis brings then two parts concerning each of the approaches pre-
viously explained. The ?rst part will detail the experimental methodology
used in this work in order to obtain ?ow and sediment transport properties

tions that could be gathered from the site, we show that it is possible to
assess the amplitude of roll waves instabilities that could have been devel-
oped on that natural environment with a certain margin of error. A more

Physical and mathematical review

2.1 Introduction

As addressed in the introductory part, when looking for gradually developed
mud?ows, two di?erent scenarios are at stake during its evolution: the
runo?, where initial sediment transport is observed; and mud?ow, a ?ow
of aqueous mixture of solid sediment particles. Considering the following
geometry for the channel in both scenarios:

• rectangular cross-sectional;

• slope angle of ? degrees;

• long waves approximation - longitudinal characteristic length L0 is
much greater than cross-sectional l0 or vertical h0 ones (L0 ? l0 ?
h0);

• negligible friction on the lateral walls1 - cross-sectional characteristic
length l0 is much greater than vertical one (l0 ? h0);

Schematically, the representation of such ?ow would be as shown in Fig-
ure 2.1. Characteristics properties of ?ow are: ?ow discharge Q (m3s?1);
mean ?ow height h0 (m); mean ?ow velocity u0 (ms

?1); speci?c ?ow dis-
charge (m2s?1),

q = Q/l0 = h0u0. (2.1)

1This hypothesis requires that channel width should be at least 20 times much larger
than ?ow height.

xi; t is the time variable; ui are components of velocity ?eld; Fi are com-
ponents of body forces; ?ij represents the components of the stress tensor;
and ? is the ?uid density.

Since dealing with open-channel ?ows, the only body force acting on
the problem is the gravity, represented by its acceleration gi. The in?u-
ence of gravity on each direction depend on the slope. Fluid is considered
incompressible. The stress tensor, symmetrical, can be separated on nor-
mal and shear stress components. The former is represented by pressure
P (scalar), that acts uniformly on every direction. The latter, by the vis-
cous forces, represented by ?ij which vary depending on the ?uid rheology.
Mathematically:

?ij = ?P?ij + ?ij, (2.3)

where ?ij is the Kronecker delta (unit tensor) such that ?ij is 1 if i = j and
0 if i 6= j.

Fluid density and viscous stress tensor should depend on the volumetric
concentration of particles ?v in the ?uid mixture, so that ?(?v) and ?ij(?v),
but then again, ?v is constant during a process. At this point, we should
remember the Reynolds number, which represents the ratio between inertial
forces (represented by mean ?ow velocity u0) and viscous forces, opposing

the ?uid movement. The Reynolds number should assume di?erent forms
depending on the rheological approach given to the ?uid. Then, the two
scenarios at stake can be di?erentiated based on two main features: con-
centrations of particles in the ?uid; and ?ow shear rate, ?? = ?ui/?xj. Such
categorization is summarized in the work from Coussot and Ancey (1999)
by Figure 2.2. For the runo? stage, concentration of particles should be
low (?v &amp;lt;1%), than the viscosity is the viscosity of the interstitial ?uid
(water, ? 10?3 Pas). High shear rate is noticed (?? ? 102 s?1)2, thus ?t-
ting into region (D). For mud?ow stage, high concentration of particles will
change ?uid rheology and ?ow dynamics, increasing viscous e?ects, reduc-
ing shear rate (?? ? 100 s?1), thus ?tting to region (B). Many e?ects are
neglected in the approach undertaken in this work such as the presence of
colloidal substances, temperature gradient, and hard suspensions (promi-
nent particle-particle interactions). Both regions of interest here, (B) and
(D), are governed by ?uid mechanics laws such as Equations 2.2a and 2.2b,
previously presented. The evolution of properties from a ?ow from region

2combination of low viscosity and high shear rate leads to great Reynolds number -
Turbulent ?ow.

15



2. Physical and mathematical review

(D) to region (B) however is not quite well understand. Many e?ects could
be present during a natural event that can change the path of transition.
For example, the ?ow capacity of transport is related to the ?ow discharge
and characteristics of soil particles. Any variation of geometry and/or ?ow
discharge would change the overall ?ow capacity, thus also changing the
particle entrainment rate. Nevertheless many time-variable e?ects appear
which somehow are supposed to a?ect the ?ow dynamics and its interac-
tion with sediment transport. Such kind of events require a more speci?c
approach. One among them is the roll waves instabilities, which are con-
sidered in this work, as will be shown.

Using the hypothesis presented before (incompressibility of ?uid and
?ow) and the form stress tensor (Equation 2.3), the conservations equations
can be rewritten as:

To summarize the evolution of a gradually developed mud?ow, one
should assume for example a longitudinal line from watershed, as illus-
trates 2.3(a), starting one end at the beginning of the runo? stage and the
other end at the consolidated mud?ow stage. Following this line, discharge
in the stream will continuously increase. Consequently, ?ow erosion ca-
pacity will also increase and so the quantity of solid sediments entrained.
What could be observed, schematically, would correspond to the 2.3(b). A
clear water ?ow, turbulent and Newtonian, where particles initiate their
movement, that continuously su?ers increase of discharge and transport ca-
pacity (a?ecting particles entrainment/transport), incorporating sediment
material on the ?uid (changing ?v), until reach a maximum concentration
of particles in the ?uid mixture for the conditions at stake. Such change in
concentration could be able to lead to a change in ?uid rheological proper-
ties and consequently in ?ow dynamics (Coussot and Meunier, 1996; Graf
and Altinakar, 2000). If this evolution is successful, the ?ow would now be
laminar and non-Newtonian.

In the speci?c literature for mass movements, the rheological classi?ca-
tion of an event would depend basically on the fraction of ?ne sediments to
the total volumetric concentration of solid sediments (Figure 2.4), as pro-
posed by Coussot and Meunier (1996). Then, when ?ow capacity Celik and
Rodi (1991) is low, sediments are entrained close to the bottom. Two-phase

?ow is established and sediments are transported in bedload discharge. As
?ow discharge increases, more and more particles are entrained and in-
corporated to mixture, especially ?ne sediments which are easily washed
downstream. This would change the overall dynamics of the ?uid, and ?ow
is frequently modeled as equivalent one-phase ?ow.

2.2 Turbulent ?ow and sediment transport

On open-channel hydraulics, sediment transport is a matter of study that
have great interest due to its importance to the environment. Informations
such as quantity of solid material transported by ?ow and properties of
bedform structures are the main concerns of that matter of study.

Flows occurring over large surfaces, with a small ?ow height, are a com-
mon scenario where sediment transport is established. Rain pouring over
sedimentary or non-sedimentary soils induce the formation of preferential
?ow paths, usually of small height (&amp;lt;10 mm), even when compared to its
width. This kind of ?ow is called runo? and is one of the most common
?ow of water cycle on Earth surface. As shows Figure 2.5, such kind of ?ow
is present in many environments, arti?cial or natural, changed or not by
human interference.

2.2.1 Flow hydraulics

Runo?s are usually turbulent, composed by water with very small con-
centrations of particles, and have a considerable capacity of transporting
sediment material and pollutants. Depending on ?ow dynamics and sed-
iments grain size distribution, transport mode of sediment can vary from
bed load (for coarse and ?ne sands), praise saltation and reptation regimes
(for ?ne sands and silt) and even reach intrinsic suspension mode (for clay
and pollutants).

For runo? ?ows, shallow clear water ?ow occurs over a mobile bed. The
?uid being Newtonian, the viscous stress tensor is:

?ij = µ

(
?ui

, (2.5)

where µ is the ?uid dynamic viscosity3.

where u?i represents the statistical mean value over time and u
?
i the ?uctu-

ations. In permanent and steady conditions, further simpli?cations of the
problem can be performed through the boundary layer theory (Schlichting,
1979). The problem is solved and the law of the wall (Von Kármán, 1930)
is reached so that we obtain ?ow velocity pro?le u?(y), with a negligible
mean vertical velocity and a mean longitudinal velocity depending on the
vertical component y. In that theory, two di?erent zones are presented: one
where the drag comes mainly from ?uid viscosity (viscous sublayer - small
scale/molecular), close to the walls; and another far from the wall where
viscosity is negligible and only turbulent dissipation can be considered (log-
law region). The problem is scaled to the speci?c velocity u? called friction
velocity where

u? =

?
?b
?
, (2.9)

and ?b is the shear stress applied to the walls/bottom. When in steady and
permanent con?guration for a ?at bed, hydrostatic conditions are reached.
The bottom shear stress can be written as function of the water column:

?b = ?gh0 sin ?. (2.10)

The scaling is done as:

u+ =
u

u?

y+ =

.
Then the velocity pro?le present the behavior illustrated on Figure 2.6.

The ?ow velocity pro?le u(y) assumes di?erent form depending on each
zone of the boundary layer. For the viscous dominant, velocity depends
linearly on the vertical coordinate

u+ = y+, (2.12)

and for turbulent dominant region (log-law region), it follows

u+ =
1

?
log y+ + B, (2.13)

where ? = 0.41 is the von Kármán constant and B is an adjustment coe?-
cient depending on the channel wall roughness.

2.2.2 Sediment transport

Wall roughness is given based on the type of sediments that are distributed
in the bed, their mobility and the subsequent bedform presence. Bed sed-
iments are characterized depending on their density ?s and their size (di-
ameter) D. Depending on shear rate applied by ?ow on bed particles, or
more precisely ?ow friction at the bed, ?ow is capable to overcome static
state of particles, and then to transport sediment material along with it.
This threshold state is related to particles geometry and submerged weight
(Shields, 1936) (see ?gure Figure 2.7) and threshold is often related to
a minimum stress value or critical value ?c (or a critical friction velocity
u?c (Armanini and Gregoretti, 2005)). The relation between kinetic energy
available on the ?ow and sediments potential energy is given by the Shield's
number Sh (Equation 2.14):

Sh =
?b

(?s ??)gD
&gt; Shc, (2.14)

The minimum Shield's number is represented by Shc.

One of the factor that is included into the critical shear velocity concept
is the sedimentation velocity vs, which represent the particles weight. The
relation between friction velocity and sedimentation velocity relation is also

called movability number and can also be used to understand the imminence
of movement. Recent works (Paphitis, 2001; Beheshti and Ataie-Ashtiani,

empirical equation proposed by Paphitis (2001) that covers a large range of
dimensionless grain diameter was found based on many experimental runs
collected from the literature:

mean threshold curve estimated by those authors. The lower and upper
limits shown in Figure 2.7 are:

Shc =

0.7 + 1.2D?
+ 0.03(1 ? 0.57e?0.02D?), (2.17a)

Shc =
0.380

+ 0.07(1 ? 0.57e?0.02D?), (2.17b)

respectively. These limits should be used to estimate the uncertainties of
measurement.

22



2.2. Turbulent ?ow and sediment transport

Depending on particle-?ow interaction, di?erent kind of transport modes
can appear. During their movement, particles will eventually fall back to
bed with velocity vs which depends on ?ow dynamics and particles them-
selves:

v2s =
?

3

(s? 1)gD
Cd

, (2.18)

where s = ?s/? and Cd is the drag coe?cient of the particle. Simpler and
empirical relations have been studied for practical purpose such as the one
reached by (Zhiyao et al., 2008) based on experiments from the literature:

vs =
?

D
D3?
[
38.1 + 0.93D12/7?

]?7/8
. (2.19)

If particles sedimentation velocity is much greater than friction velocity,
particles will be stuck in the bed, and will not be transported. If friction
velocity is greater enough to surpass the critical value, particles will stay in
contact with the bed, making small displacement, characterizing the bed-
load transport. For greater shear stress applied to the bottom, particles
will be able to make higher jumps (saltation regime), and eventually being
suspended (suspended load) and carried away by ?ow (Bagnold, 1966) (Fig-
ure 2.8). The relation between sedimentation velocity and shear velocity
can be used to identify how transport will happen.

Considering for example a poly-dispersed mobile bed, i.e. very broad
grain-size distribution. For vs/u? &gt; 1, the sedimentation velocity is high
enough so smaller sediments will move rolling, sliding or jumping in small
hops. For vs/u? &amp;lt;1, particles make long jumps, eventually falling back to
the bed, but travel more time along the ?ow, sometimes even reaching the
?ow surface. This particle transport mechanism is called inhomogeneous

suspended load, presenting a concentration pro?le that decreases with ver-
tical coordinate. For vs/u? small enough, the ?ow stress applied into the
mobile bed is great enough to make small particles travel along the ?ow,
characterizing the intrinsic suspended load or wash load and the concentra-
tion pro?le becomes almost a constant. The Rouse number:

Ro =
vs
?u?

, (2.20)

sometimes is also used to relate the same behavior:

• Ro &gt; 2.5 - bedload transport;

• 1.5 &amp;lt;Ro &amp;lt;2.5 - up to 50% suspended load;

• 0.8 &amp;lt;Ro &amp;lt;1.2 - up to 100% suspended load;

• Ro &amp;lt;0.8 - intrinsic suspended load.

So, for a ?xed mono-dispersed grain-size distribution (particles with a
Gaussian distribution centered at a speci?c diameter D), the proportional-
ity between shear rate and Shield's number allow us to identify regions of
transport modes inside the regions (B) and (D) from Figure 2.2:

• at low shear rate, bed load transport takes place. A thin sheet of
particles moves close to bed. Fluid keeps its original properties and
small in?uence is perceived by ?ow. Flow capacity is usually limited
to values smaller than packing concentration ?c and no ?uid variation
is perceived along vertical coordinate.

• For intermediate shear rates, suspended transport mode takes place.
Particles concentration become better distributed along vertical coor-
dinate. Quasi-Newtonian rheologies could be still employed on ?uid
representation as their presence might change ?uid viscosity.

• at higher shear rates, sediments concentration can become more equally
distributed in y. Concentration might reach relatively high values,
sometimes reaching minimum packing value ?c, and then changing
?ow regime.

Parallel to the one presented on Figure 2.4, considering water-sediment
mixture, Graf and Altinakar (2000) de?ne the type of sediment transport as
function of the concentration of sediment particles, which can also change
?ow dynamics, as shown on Table 2.1.

• Flow mixture will behave as Newtonian if the volume concentration
of particles (sediments) is very low, i.e. ?v ? 1%. Bed and suspended
load are characterize by this level of concentration and are the most
frequent type of ?ow on water streams.

• Flow mixtures will behave as quasi-Newtonian solutions if the con-
centration is still low, ?v &amp;lt;8%. Concentrated suspended load and
turbidity streams are characterize by concentrations of this magni-
tude.

• Finally, ?ow mixture will behave as non-Newtonian if ?v &gt; 8%. Non-
Newtonian ?uids have completely di?erent behavior from Newtonian
ones and change ?ow dynamics drastically, included friction. Parti-
cles will rest suspended for long time and sedimentation velocity will
be in?uenced by the concentration. Sediments transport in hypercon-
centrated solutions characterize mud ?ows and also hyperconcentrated
turbidity streams. It can be generate by a great discharge rate of ?ne
sediments on a low steep water open-channel ?ow, which usually can
be seen on rainy season. Another possibility are the formation of tor-
rential lavas on very steep channels, ? &gt; 15?, that are composed by a
vast domain of particles, from cohesive ?ne particles to large blocks
of rock (? 1 m3), and are considerably fast.

particles in the vertical coordinate, and thus its in?uence on the mixture
overall behavior (Figure 2.9). In this way, increasing the steepness, higher
concentrations could be achieved.

the bed slope for plastic particles in water. In the up-right corner, sketch of the
?ow con?guration with the frame of reference and a generic concentration pro?le
(Berzi and Fraccarollo, 2013). The degree of saturation is the ratio between mean
?ow height and maximum height of transported particles jumps. For such ratio
equals to 1, particles trajectories cover all position in the ?ow height.

2.3 Laminar ?ow and non-Newtonian ?uids

Mud?ows are often characterized as saturated ?ows, aqueous mixtures with
high concentration of solid material. The variability found on solid-liquid
fraction composing the mixture contribute to the complexity of the ?uid
which could acquire cohesive or non-cohesive behavior, depending on the
material in suspension, specially for natural environments (Malet et al.,
2003; Remaître et al., 2005). For mixtures where sediment concentration
is high and the energy dissipation is mainly viscous, the mixture behavior
can be characterized by an equivalent ?uid model, employing a rheological
model, which sums up contributions of particles and ?uid interactions. The

26



2.3. Laminar ?ow and non-Newtonian ?uids

main feature of such models is the presence of a yield stress, thus pointing
out non-Newtonian rheological behavior of ?uid.

To our knowledge, ?ows of complex ?uids are yet to be completely un-
derstood by scienti?c community. Present in many branches of technologi-
cal and scienti?c matters, the knowledge of such kind of ?ow, and even of
complex ?uids, is clearly an open task that interest all community. From
complex ?uids, one should understand ?uids that present a non-Newtonian
rheology, where shear stress and shear ratio are not linearly proportional
by a constant ?uid viscosity (µ).

2. Physical and mathematical review

Particularly, Herschel-Bulkley ?uids show yield and also non-linearity
between shear rate and shear stress. Polymer mixtures (gels), water mix-
tures of solid particles (cement, mud), emulsions, sols and many others are
classical examples of such ?uids (Balmforth et al., 2014), as illustrates Fig-
ure 2.10. When dealing in simple shearing conditions, those ?uids can be
represented by the following model,

?xy = ?0 + Kn

(
?u

?y

)n
, for ? &gt; ?0, (2.21)

where ?0 represents the yield (formally ?uid yield stress), Kn is called con-
sistency index, and n is the power-law index for ?uid, which gives the non-
linearity between shear stress and shear ratio. When dealing with water-
solid mixtures in isothermal conditions, these three parameters depend ex-
clusively on the sediment properties: concentration, geometry, density, etc
(Mueller et al., 2009). From the mathematical perspective, such model is
rather interesting since it can be used to represent less complex ?uids by
simple manipulation of parameters: for n = 1, Bingham ?uids are repre-
sented; for ?0 = 0, power-law ?uids are ?t; for n = 1,?0 = 0, Newtonian
?uids can also be represented. Even though research about modeling of
yield stress still continues (Barnes, 1999; Rajagopal, 2006; Ovarlez et al.,
2013), the model gives interesting insight and practical results about many
kind of ?uids.

For such kind of ?uid, the Reynolds number have to be adapted to a
more generic form (Haldenwang et al., 2002; Burger et al., 2010, 2015) to
better ?t the set of parameter used to de?ne the rheological properties of
the ?uid:

At this point it is also important to de?ne a dimensionless number that
relates yield stress with ?ow height, which gives the idea on how important

This dimensionless number is analogous to the Bingham number (for
non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows in pressure driven ?ows). It is the ratio between
the ?uid yield and the driven force, represented by the shear stress.

2.4 Free surface instabilities - Roll waves

Free surface instabilities are phenomena that inspire researches on many
di?erent subjects related to open-channel ?ows. From breaking waves and
tidal bores, to roll waves instabilities (Figure 2.12), the interest on such
phenomena lies in the fact that their appearance change the steady and
permanent con?guration of ?ow, sometimes a?ecting ?ow interaction with

Shore erosion due to waves (van der A et al., 2013; Kranenburg et al.,

in coastal engineering nowadays. When studying instabilities such as roll
waves, which can appear not only on clean water turbulent ?ow but also
on non-Newtonian ?ows at high steepness, there are yet questions to be
answered.

When studying surface instabilities, their properties are the target. Pro-

ering that ?ow could assume temporal and spatial variations, the hyperbolic
nature of governing equations give the particular physical problem that is
called roll waves. For a given set of special conditions, shock gravitational
waves can be developed on the free surface of open-channel ?ows (Figures
2.12(c) and 2.12(d)). The basic feature to understand their appearance is
the Froude number Fr, which relates ?ow and gravity waves velocities:

(2.29)

2. Physical and mathematical review

The slope is the main factor that drives the behavior of such waves. From
the classical works from Vedernikov (1945); Chow (1959); Ponce (1991),
roll waves might appear in every stage of mud?ows evolution, presenting
di?erent conditions, represented by the Froude number, summarized by
Table 2.2. Nevertheless, another important factor on such instabilities gen-
eration is the channel length. They required a minimum length to develop,
considering an in?nitesimal disturbance applied to permanent and uniform
?ow (Montuori, 1961, 1963). Given a random source of disturbances, it must
exist a minimum channel length necessary for roll waves to completely de-
velop. The amplitude and frequency of the disturbance are important to
de?ne such length. Since the solution of roll waves problem can be obtained
from a second-order ordinary di?erential equation, the eigenvalues give the
stability points and roll waves solution are an attractor of periodic solution
established around one of those points. This means that the closer the ini-
tial condition (or disturbances) is to the periodic solution, the faster it will
converge to it (Hwang and Chang, 1987; Needham and Merkin, 1984). Ex-
perimentally this have been observed by Fiorot (2012); Fiorot et al. (2015)
for laminar Newtonian ?ows.

Although detailed observations on roll waves were ?rst presented in 1910
by Cornish (1934), Je?reys (1925) was the ?rst to analyze the waves in
clean water turbulent ?ows. The work determined the generation criterion
for the problem as a speci?c value of the Froude number Fr &gt; 2; below
this value, roll waves cannot appear. This value was then further adapted
by Vedernikov (1945) to di?erent channel con?gurations. Searching for
more quanti?ed data, Dressler's model (Dressler, 1949) tried to represent
the wave pro?le. His formulation was peculiar because the solution of his
equation presented an intermediate value for the wave height, at which no
solution was possible. Applying the Rankine-Hugoniot shock condition, he
was able to remodel the equation and construct the wave pro?le based on
the monotonic solutions of the equation tied together by the shock point.
Dressler's model simplify previous Equations 2.25 and 2.26 since the turbu-
lent dissipation of second order is not considered (?t = 0). Also, parameter
? = 1 meaning fully turbulent pro?le, no sheared zone, and f (u,h) = u2/h:

with good agreement to experimental results (Brock, 1967), as shows Fig-
ure 2.14. Even though roll waves subject have been largely studied, inter-
actions between roll waves and sediment transport are still not completely

understood. Usually when solving two-phase problems, where we have ?ow
and sediment transport, the solution can be reached through de-coupled
systems of equations. However, when in roll waves regime, an interac-
tion between both phases seems to takes place and proper numerical so-
lutions can only be obtained through if equations are coupled (Colombini
and Stocchino, 2005). Wave of sediments were also observed experimentally
(Davies, 1990; Armanini and Recchia, 2006), but no precise mechanism has
been de?ned. On the other hand, recent research from Balmforth and Vakil
(2012) shows that particular structures on the mobile bed called cyclic steps
can appear when in roll waves regime, but they usually end up stabilizing
the ?ow, thus working as a feedback to surface instabilities. Some simi-
lar conclusions were found by Zhao et al. (2015) concerning the feedback of
solid particles concentration on ?ow to waves properties. For a channel with
?xed geometry, those researchers observed that ?ow would not be prone to
roll waves generation as soon as a threshold solid concentration of sediment
was reached. These examples prove that there are interaction e?ects be-
tween ?ow dynamics in roll waves regime and sediments transported which
cannot be simply addressed.

When studying ?ows in laminar regime, Ishihara et al. (1954) showed
through linear stability analysis that instabilities are prone to appear when
?ow Froude number is greater than a speci?c value Frmin = 0.5774..., and
further con?rmed by Julien and Hartley (1986). In the past 10 years, sev-
eral mathematical models have been developed on mud and debris ?ows,

considering the laminar approach, adding up complex features such as ar-
bitrary topography, non-Newtonian ?uid rheology and assuming unstable
conditions of the free surface (van Asch et al., 2007; Balmforth and Man-
dre, 2004; Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007). Using the same idea as Dressler
(1949) but now adding some complexity in ?uid rheology, Ng and Mei (1994)
constructed the permanent wave pro?le for laminar power-law ?uid ?ows
as nonlinear waves connected by shocks. A linearized stability analysis
showed an update of Ishihara's generation criterion, where the dependence
of the minimum Froude number with the ?ow index (n) is highlighted,
Frmin = n/(2n + 1)

recovered thus reassuring this method.

Ng and Mei's model brought not only ?ow height but also mean verti-
cal velocity and bottom shear stress as informations, as shows Figure 2.15.
The last parameter is rather interesting when evaluating erosive capacity
of such ?ows. Even though the power-law rheological model includes some
non-Newtonian e?ects, that model is not the best choice to represent muddy

materials such as water-clay mixtures. Through a large experimental ap-
proach, Coussot (1994) proved that the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model
best ?ts the pro?le of this type of material because it uses three parameters
to represent the ?uid behavior: yield stress (?0), ?ow index (n), and consis-
tency index (Kn). The same conclusion was obtained by Maciel et al. (2009)
for Brazilian clay mixtures with water; the behavior of the mixture shows
the strong presence of a yield stress value. Coussot (1994) also performed
linear stability analysis and obtained a threshold value for Froude number
that depends on the ?uid rheological parameters; he was also able to qual-
itatively evaluate that below that value, no instabilities were observed in
his experimental bench. The work of Maciel et al. (2013) extends the do-
main of validity of previous works (Ishihara et al., 1954; Ng and Mei, 1994),
corroborating the results found by Coussot (1994), using a more complex
rheological model, the same as Coussot (1994), as presentes Figure 2.16.
The ?gure shows also how the non-Newtonian properties control the stabil-
ity domain, increasing possibility of roll waves appearance.

Nevertheless, other e?ects had to be also investigated to better approx-
imate theoretical predictions to what is observed in a natural environment.
The e?ect of topography, as mentioned before; porosity of bed; bed scour;
and so on. The mobile bed that usually constitute the bottom of natural
channels are porous and non ?at, composed by rocks and sediments from
di?erent sizes. Pascal (2006) was able to revisit the model from Ng and
Mei (1994) and rede?ne stability criteria based on a porous bed parameter

Chapter 3

Introduction

Surface runo?s are turbulent ?ows composed by water with small concentra-
tions of particles entrained. In those ?ows, sediments like sand are usually
transported in bedload. Even though no unifying physical model is able to
describe the movement of sediment particles in a ?uid ?ow, studies from the
last century (Einstein, 1950; Bagnold, 1977) are still used as valuable refer-
ences for recent works. Despite of the well-posed problem of measuring the
solid discharge and di?culties concerning the representativeness of physical
phenomenon, scienti?c e?orts employed so far have led to a vast set of em-
pirical relations. The seemingly reasonable semi-empirical relations broadly
used help the understanding on how sediment transport happens in terms
of mean values during steady ?ow con?guration.

However, can those empirical laws be directly applied on time-variable
problems (non-stationary phenomena) such as tidal bores, dam-break and
surface instabilities? In those cases, the level of stress applied to the bottom
is not accurately known and should be di?erent depending on the ?ow itself,
thus indicating a non-uniform transport. Taking for example the case for a
dam-break, as shows Figure 3.1 from Fraccarollo and Capart (2002). Sim-
pli?ed empirical laws would not be capable to capture the shock wave e?ect
on the mobile bed, and even more the erosional bore formed by directly
applying the formulas. They are transitory e?ects that should be solved in
time, thus rendering steady-like formula not easily applied. Another exam-
ple of such di?culty is given by Ancey et al. (2006), as illustrates Figure 3.2.
When close to the imminence of transport, ?uctuations of ?ow could lead to
intermittent transport, thus a non-zero net solid discharge, even though the
mean bottom shear stress would not be able to produce sediment transport.

Most of the time, the empirical relations employed for steady and uni-

form ?ow aren't able to satisfactory represent how sediment dynamics would
be a?ected by non-stationary phenomena. One could guess that time-
dependent e?ects such as horizontal accelerations, phase lags, and some-
times even ?ow velocity ?uctuations should not be ?t to that approach.
Nevertheless, the same empirical relations can be sometimes adapted into
numerical solvers. Through discretization of conservation equations, time
and spatial numerical solutions can be considered steady and uniform as-
sumptions at time steps/discretization cells. The solution of solid and liq-
uid phase are usually computed separately (Colombini and Stocchino, 2005;
Siviglia et al., 2008) using Saint-Venant equations for the liquid phase and
Exner equation for the solid phase. Recently the coupling between both

due to non-constant stress applied. Sediment transport can only happen if ?ow
applies enough stress to overcome particle submerged weight, represented by a
threshold velocity uc. Turbulent ?uctuations can interfere with continuous state
of transport when mean ?ow is close to particles threshold velocity.

phases solution started to be explored (Audusse et al., 2012; Balmforth and
Vakil, 2012), pointing out that a strong interaction between ?ow and sedi-
ment are at stake in some cases.

Hydraulic instabilities represent a vast set of classical Engineering prob-
lems where steady and uniform conditions can't be considered. Their pres-
ence might di?cult or mis-lead the computation of solid discharge. Re-
searchers from Oceanography have dealt with such problem on shore ero-
sion and have been adapting the semi-empirical laws to their problems.
Researcher usually modify the empirical functions of sediment transport to
employ wave friction, phase lag between waves and sediment transport and
other features to better estimate solid discharge (van Rijn, 2007; Kranen-
burg et al., 2013).

Another example of hydraulic instabilities are roll waves which are fast-
moving steep waves with ?xed wavelength and amplitude (See chapter 2).
Their in?uence on sediment transport rate is still not well understood
but have already been experimentally studied (Davies, 1990). On highly-
concentrated ?ows, Davies (1990) have perceived that such waves changed
how transport occurred, generating sediment waves and increasing mean
discharge (Figure 3.3(a)). Similar observations have also been made for
low-concentrated ?ows (Armanini and Recchia, 2006). Numerical simula-
tions show that when these hydraulic instabilities appear, ?ow and sediment

dynamics can no longer be solved separately (Colombini and Stocchino,
2005). Figure 3.3(b) shows the stability diagram for the coupled system
(mobile bed-?ow), presenting the superposition of bed and ?ow instabilities
for low wavenumbers and high Froude. Even though total discharge seems
to change by roll waves presence, neither experiments nor numerical sim-
ulations have reached any speci?c relation and/or value to quantify their
e?ect. The logical conclusion is that there must exists a physical interaction
between roll waves and transport sediment that is not taken into account.

between roll waves instabilities and sediment transport. 3.3(a): Picture from
Davies (1990) illustrating how roll waves and sediment waves interact; 3.3(b):
stability plot showing that anti-dunes instabilities from mobile bed can appear
together with roll waves ?ow instability (Colombini and Stocchino, 2005).

Considering, for example, the open-channel ?ow represented on Fig-
ure 3.4 by the dark line: an incompressible Newtonian ?uid with density ?
and kinematic viscosity ? ?ows down a channel, with width l0 and charac-
teristic length L0, inclined of ?. The ?ow established is steady and uniform,
with characteristics as mentioned in section 2.2. In this case, turbulent
dissipation is much greater than viscous one so that the last can be ne-
glected, far from the walls. In the bottom of the channel lies a mobile bed
of sediments with density ?s and mean diameter D. The capacity of ?ow to
transport sediment is related to the average stress applied to the bottom, ?b,
or friction velocity u? (Equation 2.9), or Shields number (Equation 2.14).

44



Figure 3.4: Sketch of open-channel ?ow con?guration over mobile bed. Dark line
represent free surface in steady and uniform conditions. Dashed line represent
free surface instabilities propagating downstream.

Common sediment transport formulas rely on steady and uniform ?ow
informations to estimate the mean value of solid discharge (Meyer-Peter
and Müller, 1948; van Rijn, 1984; Wong and Parker, 2006). For bed-load,
for example, a representative way of expressing the relation between the
solid discharge, represented by q?, and Shields number is:

q? ? A(Sh ? Shc)B, (3.1)

where q? is the dimensionless solid discharge also known as Einstein bed-
load parameter q? = qs/(?s

?
(s? 1)gD3) with qs being the bedload solid

discharge in weight per unit width per second; and A and B are constants
calibrated on ?ow and mobile bed properties (8 and 3/2 for Meyer-Peter
and Müller (1948) and 4.93 and 8/5 for Wong and Parker (2006), respec-
tively).

Nevertheless, it is di?cult to apply Equation 3.1 when non-stationary
?ow properties are important. For example, given a ?ow with constant
discharge q, consider the two following situations: an observer ?xed in a
position (x0,y0) inside the ?ow so that 0 &amp;lt;y0 ? h0; an observer ?xed
at the free surface (x0,h0) when surface instabilities are present (dashed
line in Figure 3.4). For the ?rst case, depending on the ?uctuations scales
from turbulence, a certain degree of friction velocity variation would be
perceived; for the second one, free surface would culminate in the variation
of mean ?ow characteristics. In both conditions, ?ow parameters vary with
time, implying that bottom shear stress and friction velocity also vary (?b(t),
u?(t), respectively). A ?rst approach that can be done to deal with such
problem can be performed by simply inserting a time dependent friction
velocity u?(t) (Nielsen and Callaghan, 2003; van der A et al., 2013) into

45



3. Introduction

Equation 2.14. The classical formulas represented by Equation 3.1 should
now read:

q?(t) ? A(Sh(t) ? Shc)B, (3.2)

where both solid discharge and Shields number are time-dependent.

The discharge q?(t) is estimated by a nonlinear function to Sh(t) (thresh-
old value Shc and with B 6= 1). Small variation on q?(t) are noticed when
Sh(t)/Shc ? 1 what implies that it might be di?cult to identify variations
on mean sediment discharge through classical formulae and common mea-
surement systems (gravimetric, p.e.). On the other hand, for Sh(t)/Shc ? 1,
a strong nonlinear e?ect is at stake and sediments can be taken from its
inertial non-movement state to movement with an in?nitesimal increment
of Sh(t) (Ancey et al., 2008). This e?ect would be averaged over time
through commonly used measurement systems, thus changing the expected
mean value (to respect mean ?ow properties) and con?rming the di?culty
in measuring such interaction (Recking et al., 2009; Ancey et al., 2006). Ex-
perimental investigation from Recking et al. (2009), for example, show that
when Sh/Shc &amp;lt;2.5 sediment transport shows high variations with time,
presenting peak values of solid discharge which are much higher than the
mean value. Once again the problem is to measure those variations of bot-
tom shear stress, specially for low Shields number and runo? ?ows where
the desired precision for stress measure would be in order of 10?2 Pascals
(Amir et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, this measurements have
not yet been performed/disclosed.

To make such kind of study further possible, two main actions should be
undertaken: identify ?uctuations of bottom shear stress and/or friction ve-
locity; and identify ?uctuations of solid discharge. Despite great e?orts that
have been undertaken by the scienti?c community, it seems that there is no
systematic evidence from measurements that prove strong relation between
time-variable bottom shear stress and solid discharge. Works that follow
Kuhnle and Southard (1988) approach, for example, try to study the source
of time variability found in the discharge signal, but since the time-scale
is considerable high (? minute), relating those phenomena to turbulence
(that have also much smaller time scales) might be biased. More recently,
image analysis have often been used to explore time features from ?ows and
?uctuations on bed load discharge, as it has been explored by Frey et al.
(2003). Those authors found that poly-dispersed sediments show greater
?uctuations, which were not observed for mono-dispersed materials.

46



Based on the problem exposed, the aim of this work was to present a
set of experimental methods that could allow measurement of both ?ow
dynamic features and solid discharge over time when sediments are trans-
ported close to bed (bed load and saltation regime) for low and moderate
Shields number.

To study ?ow dynamics, a Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV) was
employed and a special relation was constructed to obtain friction velocity
over time (Ould Ahmedou et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2009; Radice et al.,
2009). For the sediment transport, a horizontal sand trap was employed,
based on experiments from Ho et al. (2012); Guignier (2014). The method-
ology here presented could then be used to better understand origins of
solid discharge ?uctuations.

On chapter 4 the experimental set-up developed is detailed as well as the
measurement systems employed to characterize ?ow dynamics and sediment
discharge. Section 4.2 brings a critical analysis of measurements and meth-
ods employed which allowed the validation of results presented. chapter 5
the results from a set of time-dependent sediment transport experiments
were explored using three main analysis: mean value of solid discharge;
spectral analysis of the signal; ?uctuations intensities of solid transport.
The same chapter presents results for solid discharge experimental runs
when disturbances were applied to the ?ow.

Experimental method

4.1 Materials and methods

4.1.1 Experimental ?ume

A small Plexiglas ?ume (0.2 m wide - l0, 2.0 m long) was installed over a
tilting desk (Figure 4.1). Water ?ow was employed in a closed system using
a constant level reservoir to control discharge (Q = 0.4 l/s maximum).
Inlet ?ow was subdue to a set of nylon grids where undesired large-scale
turbulent structures were signi?cantly reduced. In order to impose ?xed
turbulent properties to the ?ow, cylindrical obstacles (10 mm in diameter,
2 cm long) were placed after the grids. Downstream the inlet section, ?ow
passed through several parts (Figure 4.1): a ?xed bed of 1.35 meter long
with test sediment attached; a test zone, where ?ow measurements were
collected in the ?nal 2 cm of the ?xed bed; a mobile bed of Lb = 0.38 meter
long ?lled with glass beads evenly spread (porosity p = 0.39); a horizontal
sand trap 0.30 meter long (Lt) where sediment discharge was recorded; and
the outlet section.

4.1.2 Flow measurements

Two measurement system were installed in the test zone: A graduated
contact needle (CN) and a Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV). The
contact needle was used to measure mean free surface height at di?erent

Mean ?ow height measured h0CN indicated the mean ?ow dynamics, thus
measurements derived from this method are called global measurements.

Global measurements - Contact needle (CN)

Global properties of ?ow were calculated combining two measures:

50



4.1. Materials and methods

• measure of ?ow discharge Q - through a bucket, precision balance and
a chronometer;

• mean ?ow height through contact needle h0CN;

The ?ow discharge was constant and then known, with precision eQ
at ±1 ? 3%. Mean ?ow height measurements showed precision ?h0 =
±0.25mm. These two values combined give the mean ?ow velocity u0CN:

u0CN =
Q

l0h0CN
, (4.1)

with precision eu0 = ±1 ? 7%.
For a steady and uniform ?ow, in shallow water conditions, pressure is

hydrostatic. Then, the bottom shear stress reads:

?b = ?gh0CN sin ?, (4.2)

and ?nally the friction velocity can be found using Equation 2.9. The pre-
cision of u? depends on the slope and mean ?ow height precision and varies
between eu?CN = ±1?20%. Global measures were further used to calculate
the dimensionless numbers that characterize the ?ow: Reynolds (Equa-
tion 2.6), Shields (Equation 2.14) and Froude (Equation 2.29) numbers,
previously de?ned.

Local measurements - Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV)

The PIV measurement gave information of ?ow velocity ?eld through an
intense double-pulsed laser sheet and a high-speed camera. Such equipment
produced a pair of images that was then used to calculate the displacement
of packs of seeding particles dispersed in the ?ow for sub-zones inside the
image, called regions of interest (ROI). The calculated displacement was
then used to calculate the velocity based on the time between each laser
pulse (Time Between Pulses - TBP). The velocity of particles was then as-
sumed equal to ?ow velocity (Figure 4.3).

Taking into account the global aspect ratio of the ?ow, PIV measure-
ments employed a rectangular ROI (64 x 16 or 128 x 32 pixels, depending on
seeding quality). The e?ective area of measurement was 1664 x 1280 pixels,
corresponding to 11.12 mm x 9.03 mm. The open-channel ?ow was seeded
with silver-coated hollow glass spheres with a diameter around 10 µm. The
particles were illuminated by the thin laser sheet created by a single-head
Laserglow laser coupled to a cylindrical lens. The laser was operated at a

A double-pulsed laser sheet crosses a ROI of the ?ow, which then is recorded

wavelength of 532 nm and double-pulsed at 7 Hz, with each pulse delivering
approximately 5-15 mJ of energy, su?cient enough to illuminate the seeding
particles. The scattered laser light from seeding particles was recorded with
a 2048 x 2048 pixel CCD camera from Dantec Dynamics, during 100-300
µs of exposure time, depending on estimated mean ?ow velocity. The time
separation between the laser pulses (TBP) was also adjusted according to
global mean ?ow velocity u0CN.

Cross correlation was then ?rstly applied to images (Keane and Adrian,
1993) by software DynamicStudio (Dantec Dynamics A/S). Secondly, peak
and range validation of vectors were employed. The minimal signal/noise
ratio used was 1.2. Range validation of vector were based on estimative of
mean ?ow velocity u0CN. Then, for longitudinal velocities, the range ac-
cepted varied from ?0.20u0CN to 1.75u0CN and for vertical velocities from
?0.50u0CN to 0.50u0CN. To avoid statistical bias, only valid vectors were
used for ?ow velocity ?eld (u,v), with u = u(x,y,t) the longitudinal com-
ponent and v = v(x,y,t) the vertical velocity component. For each run, we

52



4.1. Materials and methods

acquired at least 1000 images, and the total amount of valid vectors used for
each position in y was approximately 3000. Precision of PIV measurements
ePIV was calculated based on equipment characteristics, as suggests (Lazar
et al., 2010). For our equipment and mounting, ePIV = 4.5%.

Since the ?ow produced was preferentially in the longitudinal direction
x, the velocity pro?le that should have established depended mainly on
vertical coordinate y. Each velocity component (u,v) was separated in
mean and ?uctuating components through data processing in Matlab:

u(x,y,t) = u?(x,y) + u?(x,y,t); (4.3)

v(x,y,t) = v?(x,y) + v?(x,y,t); (4.4)

u?(x,y) =
1

Nt

?

u(x,y,t); (4.5)

u?(x,y,t) = u(x,y,t) ? u?(x,y); (4.6)

where Nt is the number of valid vector from initial to ?nal time step. Af-
terwards, the average pro?le of mean ?ow velocity ?u??(y) was calculated
averaging through longitudinal coordinate x:

?u??(y) =
1

Nx

?

u?(x,y), (4.7)

which can then be also used to calculate the average pro?le for standard

uRMS(x,y). (4.9)

The same procedure was applied to vertical component of velocity. Mean
?ow height and velocity can be estimated based on velocity pro?le through
integration of ?u??(y) and ?ow discharge (Equation 2.1), thus giving h0PIV

and u0PIV.

The ?ow average velocity ?u??(y) was transformed in wall coordinates
(Equations 2.11b and 2.11a) using the global value for friction velocity
u?CN. Then, the pro?le was ?tted to the universal solution for turbu-
lent ?ows (Equation 2.13) and the value for the friction velocity u?PIV was
re?ned. Quality of ?uctuation ?eld was veri?ed by turbulent intensities
u+RMS(y) = ?uRMS?(y)/u?PIV and v

+
RMS(y) = ?vRMS?(y)/u?PIV, compared to

experimental results from the literature.

Since the proposal of this work was to study sediment transport over
time, friction velocity also needed to be determined as function of time.
A method derived from Ould Ahmedou et al. (2007) was here adopted
which consisted in founding a relationship between the ?ow velocity at
some point and mean friction velocity. Ould Ahmedou et al. (2007) work
proves that, for eolian sediment transport, the discharge is correlated with
the instantaneous velocity in an arbitrary position close to the bed. In this
way, based on ?u??(y), a vertical coordinate y0 was chosen and values from
the velocity ?eld ?u?(y0, t) were correlated to the average friction velocity
u?PIV. This methodology is further evaluated on section 4.2.

4.1.3 Sediment transport measurement

Test-sediment used during experimental tests were glass beads with mean
diameter D50 = 200µm (dispersion between 150 and 250 µm) and density
?s of 2430 kg/m

3. These particles have terminal fall velocity vs ? 0.02
ms?1. Figure 4.4 shows results from particles grain size distribution made
through laser di?raction method on two samples: brand new particles; and
used particles. Histograms show that no substantial di?erence is noticed
on particles distribution size. Critical value for Shields (Shc) calculated
through empirical values from the literature (Paphitis, 2001) points out a
value of 0.062 (u?c = 0.013 m/s) and lower and upper limits equal to 0.057
and 0.088 (-9%; +40%) respectively.

For the sediment discharge measurement, two measurement system were
also employed: a ?ltering fabric positioned at channel output; and the hor-
izontal trap (Figure 4.5). The horizontal trap was designed based on wind
tunnel experiments from Ho et al. (2012) and internal water ?ow from Guig-
nier (2014) where such kind of trap was used to study sediment transport in
saltation regime. This method is quite interesting because it evaluates not
only sediment discharge but also their scattering in space allowing di?er-

entiation of transport modes. This method was here adapted and allowed
basically the same informations to be acquired with an extra temporal de-
scription.

alization, illustration represent a longitudinal cut following the trap.

Global measurements - Total mass weighting (W)

The global measurement of solid discharge consisted on weighing the sed-
iment mass transported during the experimental run. From the ?lter in-
stalled at channel outlet, particles transported and not trapped were col-
lected. Adding the trapped mass to such value, the global mean discharge

55



4. Experimental method

Q?sW was estimated dividing the mass by the total time of the experimental
run.

4.1.4 Local measurements - Particle Tracking Velocimetry System
(PTV)

The horizontal trap had a small width (4.1(b), lt = 3.9 mm), which rep-
resented part of the total solid discharge. In this way, measurements from
the trap were local. Particles not trapped were transported downstream
where the ?ltering fabric was installed allowing to capture all transported
particles. Particles move over mobile bed by rolling, sliding or saltating,
with trajectories that depend on the transport mode (as explained in chap-
ter 2. Minimum sand trap length was designed based on particles longest
displacement along x, i.e. the deposition length Ldep, which is related to
particles highest jumps during their entrainment. In the general case, par-
ticles maximum height is proportional to the mean free surface. So,

Ldep ?

vs
h0. (4.10)

However, for bed load transport, particles vertical movement scales with
particles diameter D (Fourrière et al., 2010) which leads to the following
relation:

Ldep ?
u0
vs
D. (4.11)

Considering a mean ?ow velocity u0 = 0.2 ms
?1, the maximum deposition

length is roughly 2 mm, meaning that no drawback should be noticed by
the measurements performed in the trap (Lt = 0.30 ? Ldep = 0.002 m).

Particles entrained by ?ow reached the trap, fell through the honey-
comb and arrived in the visualization chamber. They were illuminated by
a di?used light source positioned in the opposite side of the camera. Shad-
ows from particles were recorded with a 2048 x 2048 pixel CCD high-speed
camera sampling at 100 frames per second, which gave a time between
each frame of ?t = 10 ms. Exposure time was settled at 1 ms. Raw im-
ages were recorded in grayscale as shown on Figure 4.6. Images were then
processed through a Particle Tracking Velocimetry program developed in
Matlab (PTV) to compute solid discharge.

Images obtained at the counting chamber were processed with Matlab
image processing toolbox. The method here employed was similar to the

one used by Frey et al. (2003). Original images were cropped into an image
I0 to eliminate undesired features from experimental set-up. Since di?erent
experimental runs can have di?erent light properties, images were enhanced
to standardize images contrast and optimize particle detection algorithm.
To do so, a linear adjust of contrast was performed using the background
image B (when no shadows of particles are present) as:

I1 = I0 ?B, (4.12)

I2 =
255

max(I1) ? min(I1)
(I1 ? min(I1)). (4.13)

After image enhancing, images were transformed into binary using Canny
edge detection ?lter (Canny, 1986). For the threshold required in the edge
?lter, Otsu's threshold method (Otsu, 1979) was applied following indica-
tion of Fang et al. (2009). Morphological operations were performed on the
binary image. Firstly, the operation of closing was performed using a struc-
tural binary element that allow optimal closing of particles shadow edges.
Those edges were then ?lled and consecutive operations of erosion and di-
latation were performed to eliminate spurious objects and dust particles.
Examples of raw, enhance and binary image are shown in Figure 4.7.

For each image k taken from the experimental run, each particle pki was

Di?erent methods can be employed to calculate the particles discharge
and each one of them is somehow related to the other (Heyman, 2014). Two
di?erent methods based on particles velocity can be de?ned: one based on
average fall velocity; and another based on individual particle velocity. In
this work, only the second one was used due to grain-size distribution.

image. The total mass per image M(tk) is given by:

M(tk) =

where Np is the total amount of particle on image in time tk. The discharge

4.2 Critical analysis of measurements

4.2.1 Sediment transport test

To evaluate the PTV methodologies described in subsection 4.1.4, a set
of binary images was constructed, where the size of ?particles? and their
velocities were imposed. In those images, as exempli?es Figure 4.10, only
two dimensions are considered, so the volume of particles is equal to their
surface. For sake of simplicity, for the tests that will follow density is taken
as ?s = 1 (mass = volume).

Figure 4.10: Arti?cial image created to test PTV methodology for solid discharge
calculation.

In?uence of ?yROI

The transformation of discrete sediment discharge to continuous domain
would required in?nitesimal scales of time step ?t and ROI. Such trans-
formation is limited by sediment itself (discrete particles with ?nite size).

61



4. Experimental method

To determine the e?ect of ?yROI, a numerical analysis was conducted to
see how transport rate would change as this parameter grows as function
of particles mean displacement length vs?t.

To evaluate how ?yROI a?ected the results, time series of constant im-
ages were constructed, each series presenting a di?erent size image with the
same pattern of particles. Figure 4.11 shows one example of such series at
intervals of one second (?t = 1 s). Particles had the same size (12 pixels)
and velocity (20 pixels/s). The sequence looks like a freeze video, but in
fact particles velocity are constant, and their trajectory are vertical and
straight. The discharge can then be intuitively calculated as 2 particles per
second enter the ROI, then q = 24 pixels/s.

(a) tk. (b) tk+1 = tk + ?t. (c) tk+2 = tk + 2?t.

Figure 4.11: Arti?cial sequence type A created to test PTV methodology depen-
dence on ROI size.

Making the ?ROI vary for a well-behaved event, it can be observed that
there is a minimal ROI necessary for computed discharge to be equal to the
correct value1. We de?ned then a minimum size for images equal to three
times the mean displacement of sediment particles (?yROI &gt; 3vs?t) given
the time between each image acquired ?t. Using data from an experimental
runs (gb1-3), the same behavior was detected, although ?uctuations were
perceived using the method explained in subsection 4.1.4, thus increasing
the minimum size of the images (?yROI &gt; 10vs?t). The results are shown
on Figure 4.12.

As the ROI size increased, more particles could be counted and the
e?ect that was perceived was a smoother signal of solid transport, as can
be observed in Figure 4.13. In this work we chose ?yROI ? 12vs?t.

4.2.2 Grain-size distribution through images

Quality of geometric properties from particles detected through image tech-
nique can be evaluated comparing results to the typical grain-size distribu-
tion for test-sand. The probability density function of particles diameter

(Figure 4.14).

The image processing techniques may present bias during the process
which cannot be easily controlled. Depending on the lightning conditions
and on the image processing technique employed, a halo might appear
around the contour of a particle, which produce a particle with a greater
diameter, as shows Figure 4.15. As a result, this feature produces a PDF2

which is displaced, as can be observed in Figure 4.14. To correct such bias,
we estimated the mean value of particles diameter computed through image
processing technique, and subtracted that value from all particles diameter,

Figure 4.16: Solid discharge for experimental run gb2-2 as function of time. Signal
is sectioned following the classi?cation described in subsection 4.2.3.

In every experimental run, up to four stages of solid transport can be
identi?ed:

I Experimental initiation (no substantial transport). This stage is present
in most of the experimental runs and corresponds to the initialization
of the run, where both acquisition system (PIV and PTV) are turned
on, and the downstream dam is released. For small discharges and
slopes, ?ow takes time to reach uniform and permanent con?gura-
tion thus leading to an usually short time where no considerable solid
transport happens.

II Dam-break transport (?rst surge of sediments). This stages corre-
sponds to the abrupt change in friction induced by the release of the
dam. Depending on the ?ow discharge and channel slope, this wave
can be considerably important, as shows Figure 4.16.

III Steady transport - qIIIs . Usually, after the ?rst wave, the sediment
transport can be assumed "steady". During this part of the signal,
we consider that the mobile bed is ?at. In this way, the bottom shear
stress should be approximately the same to the one found at the ?xed
bed. Mean and ?uctuated values can be calculated at this point. The
time duration of this part can vary depending on the Shields number.
For high Shields, this part should be smaller in time, and sometimes
cannot be identi?ed.

65



4. Experimental method

IV Non-stationary transport (bedform) - qIVs . Flow condition dictate
whether bedforms should appear in the mobile bed and how fast they
will travel. This will lead dunes and ripples to fall inside the trap,
drastically changing the solid discharge measured. For low and mod-
erate Shields number, this stage can be identi?ed after the part III,
when bedforms start to reach the trap. For high Shields number, the
separation between the parts III and IV is not clear, and then only
the part IV is considered after part II.

As it is, the ?rst stage could be detected by simple observation of the
given solid discharge signal. The other three stages could be found quali-
tatively but using a cumulative value for the mean transport can improve
the judgment:

qsc(t) =
1

qs(t). (4.26)

The section was done choosing two time stamps and observing the be-
havior of two cumulative mean values: one starting from the initial time
(positive direction of time); and another from the end time (negative di-
rection of time). The uncertainty of the equipment was plotted as a shade
zone around qsc. If both signals qsc cross, this means that initial and end
time stamp chosen select a qIIIs zone of solid transport. Figure 4.17 shows
an example using original initial and end timestamps.

It is possible to inspect the image and identify that between 10 and
30 a constant value was reached. In the remaining signal there would the
possible e?ects of bedforms into the transport. So, changing the initial
and end timestamps, qsc could be inspected until satisfactory results were
achieved as shows Figure 4.18. Zone II was identi?ed between 15 and 25
seconds, and zone IV from 25 seconds forward. Finally, as time stamps were
found, signal was broken apart in the stages mentioned before, as presents
Figure 4.16.

4.2.4 Measurements of mean solid discharge

To inspect the quality of solid discharge measurement, we compared the
local and global values (from gravimetric and PTV methods), as presented
in Figure 4.19. Such relation however depends on the quantity of sediment
in the ROI.

Figure 4.19: Comparison between di?erent transport rate measurements: qsW
represented the total weighted mass of particles displaced during the experimental
run; qsP T V represented the measured solid discharge through PTV method. The
dashed line represent the solid discharge limit value where particles quantity can
start to a?ect the solid discharge assertiveness. The solid line indicate the relation
between both measured solid discharges under the limit of assertiveness.

To properly explore such information, the limitations of the system (Fig-
ure 4.20) must be understood:

A - whenever particles fall side by side, only one shadow is perceived on
images. This lack of information leads to a reduced discharge rate by
counting less particles, thus smaller mass, and smaller ?ux;

B - when particles numbers are high, one particle might come across the
path of another. This might lead to the computation of a smaller
particle velocity, thus a smaller ?ux.

To estimate the number of particles in the image where the e?ects A and
B can a?ect the measurement, we calculated particles mean displacement,

??r = v?s?t, (4.27)

where v?s is the mean particle free fall velocity inside the trap (vs ? 4 cm/s).
When in bedload, particles are concentrated in the ?rst 5 mm of the trap
(?xROIsb = 5 mm). Considering an organized distribution of particles in
the ROI, the limit number of particles in the image should be:

Nplim =

The limit discharge Qslim is proportional to that number:

For our case, qslim ? 3.26 gm
?1s?1, as indicate the dashed line in Fig-

ure 4.19. This value is indicated in Figure 4.19 by the vertical dotted line.
Finally, ?tting a curve for the solid discharges smaller than qslim, we ob-
tained the function:

qsP T V = 1.576qsW , (4.30)

with correlation coe?cient R2 = 0.94. To correct the mean value for time-
dependent discharges beyond the limit qslim, one can simply use:

q(t)corrected = 1.576

This simple methodology allows the correction of mean value, but do
not assure proper ?uctuation of solid discharge.

Measurements of unsteady sediment

transport

5.1 Flow hydraulics of steady conditions

Experimental runs were set by the ?ow discharge Q and the slope ? (see
table 5.1). For each run (Q; ?) two sets of data were collected from ?ow
properties: one through contact needle method and another through PIV
measurements. Results shown on table 5.1 point out discrepancy between
friction velocity calculated by each method. For each run, sediment trans-
port was measured.

5.1.1 Base ?ow

Each set of measurements was individually studied to evaluate its accu-
racy and relevancy to our goals. To ?nd the set of data that would bet-
ter represent ?ow dynamics, an experimental inspection of critical Shields
number Shc was performed. Firstly, ?ow discharge and channel slope were
?xed with low Shields number to assure that no sediment transport was
observed; slope was then gradually increased until su?cient movement of
grains was detected in the counting chamber. These investigation proved
that u?CN was in agreement with u?c calculated through Paphitis (2001)
semi-empirical relation. So, despite greater uncertainties, measurement of
mean ?ow properties based on contact needle method better represent the
?ow global dynamics, so that:

h0 = h0CN; (5.1)

u0 = u0CN. (5.2)

5.1. Flow hydraulics of steady conditions

These values are used to obtain dimensionless ?ow numbers (Fr, Sh and
Re = 4u0Rh/?, where Rh = h0l0/(l0 + 2h0) is the hydraulic radius).

However, since the methodology requires a time-dependent friction ve-
locity u?(t), data obtained from PIV were still needed. A linear correlation
was established between both methods of friction velocity measurement (lo-
cal and global) (Figure 5.1), which allowed to correct u?PIV and to use it
to estimate ?uctuations of u? as shows.

Figure 5.1: Correlation between friction velocity computed through both methods
u?CN and u?PIV. Solid line represent linear relation between both methods for
friction velocity calculation. Dashed line represents equality u?PIV = u?CN.

The linear correlation is represented by the function

u? = u?CN = 1.08u?PIV ? 0.006, (5.3)

with a correlation coe?cient R2 = 0.961.

1R2 is the coe?cient of determination that represents the goodness of the ?t. The
closer to 1 indicates that the better the function ?ts the data.

5.1.2 Turbulent properties

PIV Measurements pointed out that mean vertical velocity ?eld can be
neglected since |?v??(y)| ? 0.001 m/s &amp;lt;ePIV (see subsection 4.1.2), as shows
Figure 5.2. So, only longitudinal component u?(x,y) was considered in this
study. However, inspection of ?uctuating ?eld consider both components
de?ned by Reynolds separation (Equations 4.5 and 4.6). Pro?les for ?u??(y)
and ?uRMS?(y) are plotted on Figure 5.3 and show expected behavior for
turbulent ?ow pro?les. For all tests, we remark that maximum value of
?uRMS?(y) is achieved close to bed below 1 mm in accordance with the
turbulent production by friction.

Through inner coordinates transformation, it is possible to obtain re-
?ned friction velocity and re?ned vertical position to ?t the experimental
velocity pro?le with the universal pro?le (Schlichting, 1979) (Equation 2.13)
as shows Figure 5.4. However, inside the viscous sublayer, precise results
from our experiments could not be achieved for distances smaller than sed-
iment particle diameter.

Since experimental runs have moderate Reynolds number (2000 &amp;lt;Re&amp;lt;
6000), the pro?les could be a?ected by modi?cations on channel relative
roughness (ratio between sediments ?xed to the bed and mean ?ow height)
and presence of wakes (Bergstrom et al., 2001; Bigillon et al., 2006; Agelin-
chaab and Tachie, 2008). Turbulent intensities were veri?ed based on An-

As can be seen on Figure 5.5, the pro?les for standard deviation in both
direction followed the relations given by the referenced work from (Antonia
and Krogstad, 2001) with a noticeable discrepancy. For the longitudinal
?uctuations (5.5(a)), the shape identi?ed obey to the empirical law used,
although the experimental results show greater intensities than those ex-
pected. Conversely, the opposite behavior is noticed for the vertical ?uctu-
ations (5.5(b)): experimental values are lower than the empirical law here
used as reference. Such results allowed us to speculate that even though full
agreement was not achieved, the precision on the obtained velocity ?elds is
su?cient to measure the ?uctuations of the velocity due to the turbulent
vortices, as shows Figure 5.6. It is very likely that the lack of accuracy on
vertical velocities is due to the aspect ratio of the ROI.

5.1.3 Friction velocity

Based on the methodology explained on section 4.1.2, the position y0 was
chosen slightly above where the maximum value for ?uRMS? is found, far

from the viscous sublayer. From those values, a linear ?t is applied be-
tween ?u??(y0) and u?PIV to obtain the function F between both variables
from base ?ow con?guration, as shows 5.7(b). The following linear relation
(Equation 5.6):

u?PIV = F{?u??(y0)} = a?u??(y0) + b, (5.6)

where a = 0.0703 and b = 0.0048, shows good representativeness, with a
correlation coe?cient R2 = 0.99.

To estimate instantaneous friction velocity, we postulated the hypothesis
that the function F can be applied in any given instant of time. Then,
a time-dependent series for frictional velocity is obtained u?(t) based on
?u?(y0, t):

u?(t) = F{u(x,y0, t)} = a?u?(y0, t) + b. (5.7)

Constants a and b follow the lookup Table 5.2.
In order to check the validity of the hypothesis, the mean value for

and should be equal to u?PIV. When comparing both results, the hypothesis
is consistent with measurements, since u?F ? u?PIV with correlation coe?-
cient is practically 1.

So, the function F could be considered as the linear relation between
an instantaneous measured velocity at a given vertical coordinate y0. Then
frictional velocity imposed at the bottom could than be calculated as func-
tion of time u?(t). The Figure 5.8 shows an example of the signal obtained
for u?(t) using such relation.

Physically speaking, the assumption made before seemed correct. When
turbulent coherent structures passes and velocity varies, forces felt by sedi-

ments should also vary following the stress applied by those vortices. Obvi-
ously this simple linear relation would not represent some of the complex-
ity taking place in the boundary layer, specially for ?ows with low kinetic
energy, where this relation should not stand (since function F isn't zero
crossing.).

Having a friction velocity that depended on time, we then explored the
power spectral density (PSD) (Oppenheim and Schafer, 2009) of the signal
u?(t) to identify its frequency content

2. The PSD is a mathematical tool
that helps to identify the distribution of energy in the time-scales present
in a discrete signal. For turbulent ?ows, this energy distribution follows a
cascade of energy from the larger scale vortices (low frequencies) to small
vortices (high frequencies), until reach the molecular scale, where dissipa-
tion by viscosity occurs. Applying a dimensional analysis (Chassaing, 2000),
this decay of energy with the frequencies would follow a power-law function
to the exponent ?5/3 with the frequencies (wavenumber) of vortices.

From our equipment, the closest position to the wall where we could
obtain velocity information without compromising the quality of measure-
ments corresponded to y0 = 0.46 mm. Figure 5.9 shows the PSD for u?(t)
using two di?erent values for y0: one close to the bottom and another far
from it. The energy decay explained before (?5/3) is obtained for isotropic
turbulence, when ?ow is fully turbulent and developed. It is known that
close to the walls such decay might change to ?1 (Radice et al., 2009).

indicates ?1 slope; blue line ?5/3 slope. Re = 5625; Fr = 0.87; Sh = 0.060.

Figure 5.9 shows that in both cases, the most part of the ?ow energy is
transported by large scale vortices, with low frequencies. The energy decay
represented by the blue dotted line shows the ?5/3 decay, thus roughly
verifying those scales ?ow correspond to fully turbulent structures. Due to
the equipment precision, frequencies higher than 2 Hz might be considered
as noise as a constant level of energy is achieved. However we can observe a
slightly di?erent behavior between both PSDs. Around 1 Hz, for y0 = 0.46
mm (= 2.25D), we see that the decay smooths and tends to the ?1 decay
while for y0 = 1.85 mm (= 9.3D) the decay keeps the ?5/3 decay until
reach noise level. Then, it might be possible to assume that as closer we
get to the wall, the energy decay decreases, increasing the energy for larger
eddies with low frequency. This observation is important as in the sub-
section 5.2.2 we explore close to wall ?ow ?uctuations to understand solid
discharge ?uctuations.

5.2 Turbulence e?ects on sediment transport

In this chapter we focus on the understanding of general features of the data
acquired and correlate them to ?ow properties. This should give enough
information to be able to di?erentiate the results from those obtained in
pulsating ?ows. The reference case is then the sediment transport by a
turbulent runo? ?ow without superimposed waves.

5.2.1 Mean solid discharge

The ?rst aspect that we explored in this context is how well the solid dis-
charge is represented by the classical empirical formulas that can be found
in the literature. First of all, after de?ning di?erent zones from each exper-
imental run (subsection 4.2.3), some remarks must follow:

• for low and intermediate Shields numbers, up to two mean values of
transport q?s can be calculated, one for each zone q

III
s and q

IV
s ;

• for high Shields numbers, only one zone is identi?ed in the signal
partitioning, and then only qIVs is kept;

• for high Shields number, the solid discharge measured is corrected as
explained in subsection 4.2.4, using Equation 4.31.

Seven experimental runs were used and summarized in subsection 5.2.1.
The results from subsection 5.2.1 show that ?uctuation intensity of solid

transport are greater than the measurement system precision, thus qualify-
ing the measurement of q?sPTVRMS. The Figure 5.10 shows the results from
subsection 5.2.1 in logarithmic and linear axis. It is possible to identify the
uncertainties from the estimation of Sh ? Shc are more relevant than those

for q?sPTV. The ?t represented in the Figure 5.10 by the purple dotted line
have the following equation:

q? = 7.93(Sh ? Shc)1.8, (5.9)

and shows good agreement with Wong and Parker (2006) empirical relation
(represented by the blue line). Nevertheless, uncertainties of Shc ?ts the
results in between the empirical law given by Wong and Parker (2006) and
the one given by Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948).

5.2.2 Fluctuations intensities in solid discharge

Following the idea that near bed ?uctuations directly a?ect sediment en-
trainment, we investigated how ?uctuation intensity of friction velocity cor-
related to the ?uctuation intensity of solid discharge. Following the empir-
ical law F (Equation 5.6), we obtained the friction velocity ?uctuation
intensity u??RMS. To assure minimum quality of measures, we inspect u? at
the position y0 = 0.70 mm.

A simple reasoning can be developed based on classical empirical for-
mulas to corroborate such observation. Considering the following classical
law of transport employed to mean ?ow and mean transport:

q? = A(Sh ? Shc)B = A?(u2? ?u

This simple expression indicates that close to the imminence of transport
(Sh ? Shc) ?uctuations of transport goes to in?nity. On the other hand for
su?cient high Sh the ?uctuations of transport will be proportional to the
turbulent intensity of the velocity ?eld. For well-behaved turbulent ?ows
where the ?uctuation intensity follows a constant proportion of mean ?ow
properties, q??RMS/q?? should be a constant:

The data show that solid discharge ?uctuations are relatively greater for
?ow Sh ? Shc than Sh ? Shc. This observation is in agreement with the
Equation 5.15, represented by the blue solid line. Works from the literature
for close to threshold bedload transport discuss about the intermittency of
solid discharge in those conditions and high ?uctuations of the transport
(Einstein, 1950; Ancey et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2014).

84



5.2. Turbulence e?ects on sediment transport

For high Sh, Sh &gt; 0.2, ?uctuations of transport fall into the shaded zone
illustrated in Figure 5.11. From the expression 5.15, we estimated that for
Sh ? 4Shc, ?ow would provide enough shear stress to lead transport ?uc-
tuations into the shaded zone.

5.2.3 Spectral properties of time dependent solid discharge

As the intensity of ?uctuations have already been discussed in the previous
section, here the normalized power spectral density (PSD) of the solid dis-
charge signal q(t) is employed to explore the frequency content of the signal.
This analysis should provide information comparable to those obtained for
?ow friction measurements.

Firstly we established a base test where we could explore the features
that we should look for in the other cases. The test that is ?rst explored is
the experimental run gb1-4, for qIIIs as presents Figure 5.12.

On Figure 5.12, in gray the part of the PSD (f &gt; 10 Hz), the level of en-
ergy is low, two order of magnitude smaller than the energy present in small
frequencies. We than consider that this part of signal would not present any
signi?cant information for the work here performed. We perceived that for
low frequencies, the decay of energy approximates the ?1 slope (red line)
and the high levels of energy were present. Around 1 Hz the behavior seems
to change, adopting ?5/3 decay (blue line). These could be an indication
that for low Shields number the relevant energy present in solid discharge
have the same expected dynamic for the friction velocity ?uctuations (see
subsection 5.1.3). Two other experimental runs for low Shields number were
studied to verify that possibility. Their PSD are shown in Figure 5.13.

The same observations made for experiment gb1-4 were applicable to
gb1-2 and gb1-3. For Sh slightly above Shc, particles are entrained in con-
tact with the bed. So, near to bed ?ow turbulent structures would be
responsible for particles entrainment. In this way, ?ow turbulent structures
transfer their dynamics to particle, and both have the same energy decay
?1. However, looking more closely to experiment gb1-2, 5.13(a) shows that
the de?nition of the ?5/3 slope is not clear. While low frequency ?uc-
tuations still seem to present ?1, for frequencies between 0.2 and 3 Hz
(yellow shaded region) the decay of energy does not ?t any of the expected
behaviors, almost presenting a constant level of energy distribution. For
frequencies higher than 3 Hz, spectral density seems to adopted the ?5/3

respond to a spectral gap, as mentioned by Singh et al. (2009), that could
be used to separate di?erent contributions of turbulence.

For a same experimental run with intermediate Shields number, when-
ever solid discharge can be sectioned (subsection 4.2.3), two di?erent PSD
can be analyzed. From the literature (Guignier, 2014), there are evidences
that when bedforms are formed in the mobile bed, they change how the
sediment is entrainment. On Figure 5.14 both PSD from qIIIs and q

Increasing even more the Shields number, now also reaching very high
Froude numbers (Fr &gt; 2), bedforms in our experiment could not be visu-
alized. This could result of insu?cient mobile bed length (bedforms could
not develop); or plane-bed con?guration was reached. Looking to the PSD
of experimental run gb4-1, we observed that the same behavior from inter-
mediate Shields number. Finally, the major conclusion is that the PSD of
the transport signal exhibit a cascade of energy with a power law between
?1 and ?5/3 similar to the PSD of the friction velocity presented in sub-
section 5.1.3.

5.3 Pulsating ?ow

As mentioned in subsection 4.1.5, the frequencies used to disturb the runo?
?ow depended on the mean ?ow velocity, between 2 and 2.5 Hz. Frequen-
cies were chosen so that at least two wavelengths (? ? 15 cm) ?t inside the
mobile bed length. The same results presented in the chapter before are
presented for the pulsating ?ows, so a direct comparison can be made. The
results from solid transport in disturbed ?ow are summarized in section 5.3.

When looking into the results from mean solid discharge obtained, a ?t can
be seen in results which follows the same exponent as the results shown by
the steady ?ow, as shown by the red dashed line in Figure 5.16. When com-
paring the results found with those from undisturbed ?ow, a behavior can
be noticed (Figure 5.16), showing that mean solid discharge for pulsating
?ows is smaller than those in steady ?ow and the relation between q? and
Sh is now

5.3. Pulsating ?ow

In order to understand this transport reduction, velocity ?uctuations
with or without free surface disturbances are presented on Figure 5.17. On
the one hand, PIV results (Figure 5.17) show that ?uctuation intensities
increase close to the free surface for disturbed ?ow. On the other hand,
close to the bottom, no considerable variations of ?uctuation intensity was
detected. Another way to verify this is to evaluate u?F , which represents the
mean friction velocity calculated based on u?(t), for disturbed ?ow. Figure
5.18 shows variations of u?F for disturbed ?ow in the order of 2% away from
the bed, and around 5% when close to the bed.

Figure 5.17: Fluctuation intensity of velocity ?eld for steady and pulsating ?ow.
Steady ?ow experiments are represented by black symbols and disturbed ?ow by
gray ones.

A phenomenon that could explain the decrease in bottom shear stress
is the shape of waves propagating on the free surface. Works from the lit-
erature (Ng and Mei, 1994; Toniati et al., 2015) present the variation of
bottom shear stress for roll waves in laminar ?ows. Results presented in
the ?gures 2.15 and 5.19 show waves height, mean ?ow velocity and bot-
tom shear stress over the wavelength. The images are dimensionless and
the value 1 in the vertical axis denotes base ?ow properties. We can then
see that waves induce a small period of friction increase and a long period of
reduced friction generating a global reduce of the average friction ( &amp;lt;1), a

behavior that is observed for the simulations shown in ?gures 2.15 and 5.19.
Considering a mean value of bottom shear stress in the period of wave, val-
ues are below the mean base ?ow shear stress. In the same way, this e?ect
could also be present in turbulent ?ows, thus explaining the reduction of
solid transport observed when ?ow is disturbed.

5.3.2 Fluctuations intensities in solid discharge

Following the observations from the ?uctuation ?eld Figure 5.17, we know
that the disturbances applied to the ?ow are not capable to modify the
?uctuation intensities close to the bed. So, the empirical relation F can
be applied. Such hypothesis allow the same analysis from chapter before
to be applied, which gives us then the results in Figure 5.20. For sake of
comparison, results from steady conditions are also plotted.

sented the same behavior. The shaded zone indicates the region delimited
by Equation 5.19, considering high Shields number. The red solid line rep-
resents Equation 5.15 for u??RMS/u? = 17%. We can see again that the
Equation 5.15 represents the behavior observed from solid discharge results
but overestimates the ?uctuations. This might be an e?ect of the signal
constructed for u?(t) and the noise from the PIV measurements.

5.3.3 Spectral properties

The PSD from sediment transport signal with a disturbed ?ow (Figure 5.21)
shows again the behavior noticed from steady ?ows: for low Shields (5.21(a)),
energy decay follows the ?1 slope for low frequencies; for higher Shields
number, energy density follows ?5/3 slope. In those PSD we detected a
frequency range where energy decay is kept constant (yellow shaded zone).
The disturbance frequency applied to ?ow (between 2 and 2.5 Hz) is not
noticed in the solid discharge spectrum.

Introduction

From a mechanical point of view, the representation of mass-movement can
be done through many physical approaches (Iverson, 1997). Choosing a
speci?c model over another relies on the representativeness of that model
to the target phenomenon. Among mass-movements events, mud?ows are
natural events well represented by hydraulic approaches. From this last
perspective, ?uids in mud?ows are usually modeled as an equivalent non-
Newtonian ?uid, mixtures of water with high concentration of sediment
(Graf and Altinakar, 2000).

It is important to remark that the correct representation of ?uids in this
kind of phenomena requires attention. The variability found on solid-liquid
fraction composing the mixture contribute to the complexity of the ?uid
which could also present cohesive or noncohesive behavior, depending on
the material in suspension. Then, to exactly quantify shear ratio su?ered
from ?uid due to stress applied is not usually possible. Mud?ows are mix-
tures which sediment concentration is high and can be characterized mainly
by the presence of a yield stress and viscous interactions. Moreover, when
dispersive turbulent stress are remarkably noticed and grain to grain con-
tact is important, those become the main mechanism of energy dispersion,
thus characterizing mud ?oods and granular debris ?ow events (Coussot
and Meunier, 1996). As have been shown on Figure 2.4, the classi?cation
of the event depends on the ratio between liquid and solid fraction in the
mixture, and also on particles grain size distribution. Such classi?cation is
important to properly quantify the boundary dissipation and the friction
factor, so ?ow properties can be determined.
The topography and natural landscape on mountain regions may have fa-
vorable conditions for roll waves generation. In the past 10 years, several
mathematical models have been developed on mud and debris ?ows, adding

up complex features such as arbitrary topography, non-Newtonian ?uid rhe-
ology and assuming unstable conditions of the free surface (van Asch et al.,
2007; Balmforth and Mandre, 2004; Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007), to op-
timize the prediction of natural events such as those. the validation and
application of such models to practical problems is an important task for
scienti?c and engineering communities which is not easily performed, as
illustrated in this thesis. Lack of reliable data of natural events and proper
representation of physics involved are some of the factors responsible for
such di?culty.

The Acquabona event from 1998 is one the events registered in the lit-
erature where the presence of surges in the mud-debris ?ow event can be
observed. It was classi?ed by Berti et al. as a debris ?ow event, although
they have not quanti?ed the dispersive turbulent term. The problem rests
open for a di?erent read of the event as a mud?ow, accordingly to Coussot
and Meunier (1996); Coussot (1992). As shown in Figure 6.1, mud and
debris ?ow present the same behavior, shear-thinning yield stress ?uids,
which can be represented by Herschel-Bulkley rheological model, for exam-
ple. Identify the most indicated rheological behavior based on the concen-
tration sometimes is not su?cient. For complex rheological ?uid behaviors,
not only concentration plays an important role, as well as geometry of parti-
cles themselves (Mueller et al., 2009) and their chemical and organic nature.

The objective of the following chapters of this thesis was to evaluate how
good an existing model is to predict a natural events, and then to study
how adding another control parameter (porosity) would change the model
representativeness. The event from August 17th, 1998, at Acquabona creek
related by Berti et al. (1999, 2000) was chosen as the case study to analyze
the validity of the model proposed by Maciel et al. (2013). The waves pre-
sented long period and fast propagation velocity and seemed constitute a
wave train at some point, thus inducing us to think that roll waves could
have been generated during the event. Then, a more complex analytical
model was searched considering that the channel bottom was porous. We
found a deterministic solution for the velocity pro?le of non-Newtonian ?u-
ids in an open-channel in presence of a porous bed.

To verify the theoretical solution, numerical simulations on FLUENT
were performed. The characteristic present in ?ows over porous medium
is the presence of a slip velocity at the interface between ?ow and bottom
channel, thus reducing bottom shear stress. The problem is summarized in
validating the boundary condition adopted for the deterministic solution.

of ?ne content and solid fraction. The exact limits between the di?erent parts of
the diagram should be determined for each material and may slightly vary with
?ow characteristics. (From Coussot (1992).

A parametric study was performed on the mathematical solution to deter-
mine how non-Newtonian ?uid properties interact with the porosity e?ect
of the bed. It was observed that the in?uence of bed porosity was smaller
the more non-Newtonian the ?uid.

Application of mathematical model to

natural events: the Acquabona creek

7.1 Mathematical and numerical modeling of roll waves

The 2D mathematical model for roll waves (Maciel et al., 2013) employed in
the present work gives, as result, the free surface pro?le over the longitudinal
coordinate as well as wave properties. To obtain such results, a complete
set of dimensionless input parameters must be determined, namely base
?ow properties and ?uid rheology (see Figure 7.1). Usually when dealing
with measurements obtained from natural events, the necessary parameters
cannot be determined, thus requiring a pre-processing step to be performed
before solving the roll wave model.

Figure 7.1 shows the two stages necessary to the successful utilization
of the mathematical model. To the left, the preprocessing stage also called
parameters gathering: an iterative method performed to solve the constitu-
tive equations of the problem and to ?nd the proper set of input parameters
based on available data for a speci?c event. To the right, the roll waves sim-
ulation procedure, where the set of dimensionless parameter is input into
the mathematical.

To obtain the roll waves equation, which is a ?rst-order nonlinear dif-
ferential equation, the conservation equations, mass and momentum, are
manipulated (Equations 2.23a, 2.23b and 2.23c). Same conditions as men-
tioned on section 2.3 are considered.

The Herschel-Bulkley rheological model (Equation 2.21) is used in the

ered laminar (Re &amp;lt;2000), in shallow water conditions, steady and uniform,

mean ?ow velocity u0 and rheological properties as shown in Equation 7.1:

, (7.1)

where y0 is the limit between sheared ?uid layer and plug zone (y0 = h0(1?
C?)). This pro?le (Figure 7.2) shows that for such a non-Newtonian ?uid,
there is a ?uid layer that assumes constant maximum velocity (plug zone).
Looking to the y0 &amp;lt;y &amp;lt;h0, we can identify a simple relation between free
surface velocity u? = u(y = h0) and mean velocity which can be useful
given by Equation 7.2:

u? =

(
2n + 1

n + 1 + nC?

)
u0 (7.2)

Finally, the velocity pro?le can also be represented by its vertical dis-
tribution through the momentum distribution coe?cient ?:

. (7.3)

This dimensionless parameter can assume values between 1 and 1.2. The
closer this value is to one, the greater the plug zone; for Newtonian ?uids,
this parameter assumes the value 1.2, classic value in the literature for a
parabolic velocity pro?le distribution.

The conservation equations are then vertically averaged by mean values
for ?ow height (h0) and velocity (u0). Through this methodology, a dimen-
sionless system is reached (see Maciel et al. (2013) for further details), a

To obtain the roll waves equation, dimensionless conservation equations are

The system is then manipulated, culminating in the ?nal form of roll

This equation is then numerically solved using Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
numerical method. After solved, wave properties are obtained: amplitude
?h; wavelength ?w; and celerity c.

However, such solution only exists when Froude number is greater than
a threshold value Frmin, found through linear stability analysis (Trowbridge,
1987; Coussot, 1994; Maciel et al., 2013):

Frmin =

where:

? = n(1 ?C?); (7.8a)

? =

. (7.8b)

Note that Frmin depends on ?uid rheological properties. The roll waves
equation does not allow a unique solution to be found. So, a supplemen-
tary step must be executed to search for the most indicate solution to the
problem. Usually, one parameter between wavelength ?w or amplitude ?h
must be imposed to ?nd the other. Many authors have chosen wavelength
imposition as it allows spectral analysis of generated waves (Dressler, 1949;

106



7.2. Site description

Ng and Mei, 1994; Liu and Mei, 1994; Pascal, 2006). On this work, we
adopt the maximum wave amplitude imposition as it allows a more di-
rected association to hazard intensity at stake. All steps and details of this
mathematical model can be found in Maciel et al. (2013).

The model accuracy depends on the correct estimative of input parame-
ters and on rheological properties of ?uid, as will be shown. Sometimes not
every parameter can be found/measured thus requiring the pre-processing
stage (iterative method) to be performed before calculating all dimension-
less input parameters. This preliminary iterative method is implemented
so that data available is used to calculate all necessary input parameters
through constitutive equations (Equations 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.5, as shown
on the left side of Figure 7.1.

7.2 Site description

Berti et al. (1999, 2000); Genevois et al. (2000) did a vast work relating
the characteristics of the site and from di?erent mass movement events in
the Dolomites region. In this section, we should focus on describing the
site where the mass movement event happened following the observations
published by those researchers who worked on the event and the site.

The Acquabona channel is localized on the Dolomites mountains, North-
east Italy, Southeast from Cortina d'Ampezzo city, having downstream the
Boite river valley. Morphopedologic properties of region are prone to mass-
movement natural events that occur almost every year during rainy season.
The channel was equipped to allow data acquisition in three di?erent zones,
as shows 7.3(a), and for this reason is explored by Italian scienti?c com-
munity. The upstream region (region 1) is composed by a limestone rock
basin, presenting 30? steepness. Along the channel (region 2), the super-
?cial soil is composed by rock and gravel presenting mean inclination of
18?. Downstream (region 3), the channel reaches Boite river, crossing road
Roma, and presents 7? steepness. The total length of the channel is 1632
meters.

The mixture that formed during the mass movement changed as it ?owed
down the channel. The ?uid behavior is given by the aqueous solution of
gravel (with mean diameter between 2 and 20 mm) and ?ne sediments (sand
and clay - diameter less than 2 mm). The ?ow is capable of dislodge rocks
and boulders up to 2 meter in diameter. Fluid fraction of rock with diam-

107

eter greater than 20 mm can reach 28% of total mixture mass in the body
of the event, away from the surges front.

During ?ow evolution from upstream to downstream, an erosion process
is remarked by ?uid samples taken from past events (Berti et al., 1999,
2000) which can be explained by soil composition of intermediate part of
the channel that is more susceptible to be eroded. Upstream, roughly 60%
of ?uid mixture was made by gravel while rough sands (from diameter be-
tween 65 µm and 2 mm) and ?nes (silt and clay with diameter smaller than
65 µm) have 35% and 5% of its composition, respectively. At intermediate
length, ?ne sediments quantity are greater, reaching 20% in volume of ?uid
mixture. Downstream, ?ne sediments reach 30% of mixture, pointing out
channel erodibility, as shows 7.3(b).

Data collected praised pluviometry, wind speed, waves velocity (geo-
phones), ?ow height (ultrasonic devices), ?ow super?cial velocity (image
processing) and pressure gauges. In the present work, we manipulated
these data to estimate ?uid rheological properties and ?ow dynamics (?ow
discharge). This new information, along with the reported site topography,
should constitute all necessary data input for model.

108



7.3. Event sample

7.3 Event sample

During the summer of 1998, on August 17th, a large debris ?ow event oc-
curred on Acquabona channel and data were collected and published by
(Berti et al., 2000). This data is used here as a test case to verify the rep-
resentativity of the mathematical model presented before.

Measurements from pluviometer at inlet station showed that the rain
that initiated the event reached 25 mm during 30 minutes and that the a
?rst surge happened after 45 minutes of rain, when rainfall reached 20 mm.
The total volume displaced estimated was 8000-9000 m3.

Startup mechanisms of bed mobilization were elucidated and discussed
by the authors in details. However, in this work we identi?ed a particular
feature in the event of August 17th, 1998: the mass movement registered
present a roll waves-like free surface evolution. More than 15 surges (as
mentioned by (Berti et al., 2000)) of mud and debris were identi?ed during
35 minutes after the ?rst surge, as shows Figure 7.4. The idea that will be
pursued in this work is that the referenced sequence of surges could have
formed a roll waves-like pattern.

From a practical point of view, the stage where the wave train is detected
seems random and waves with di?erent amplitude, celerity and wavelength
are measured. However, roll waves are a permanent free surface instabili-
ties. They are generated by spatial-temporal disturbances (Di Cristo and
Vacca, 2005) in the ?ow which can be regular or random. In this case, we
deal with a natural phenomenon where a broad set of frequencies could have
disturbed the system. This could explain the variability of wave patterns
noticed and the unsteadiness of waves, being more like a transitional regime.

To make an application of a mathematical model possible, we should
identify a well-behaved set of waves which could be a good example of a
roll waves formation in quasi-steady con?guration. In this way, we gathered
the results, calculated mean values of them, which allowed us to acquire the
necessary input parameters for the simulation of a typical case, which could
be representative of the natural waves measured. The waves identi?ed by
A, B, C, D and E on Figure 7.4 present a relatively well-behaved amplitude
and wavelength when compared to others waves. We identify the end of the
wave train at 1308 seconds.

ultrasonic equipment on August 17th, 1998, related by Berti et al. (2000). High-
lighted wave train identi?ed as possible roll wave formation.

7.4 Parameters gathering

For the speci?c event of Acquabona creek, some necessary parameters re-
quired for roll waves model was missing, namely the mean ?ow height and
velocity (h0 and u0 respectively), and also ?uid rheological properties. The
data shown and analyzed in this section is part of the pre-processing stage,
referenced on Figure 7.1. First of all, results collected from pressure trans-
ducer showed that ?uid pressure was equal to the bottom normal stress,
thus leading to the conclusion that hydrostatic conditions is applicable.
This observation allows employment of the model presented before.

Qualitative observations and data collected from soil showed that ma-
terial density (from rocks, gravel and sands) should be around 2000 kgm?3.
Then, from mass concentration ?m = 60% (Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007),
we can compute volume concentration ?v as 43% and mixture density 1430
kgm?3. For the compounded mixture (water + clay or water + ?ne sand
+ clay) investigated in this work, rheometric studies from Coussot (1994),
Piau (1996), Huang and Garcia (1998), Santos (2003), Maciel et al. (2009)
and many others proved that neglecting sedimentation e?ects, ?uid rheol-
ogy can be described by the Herschel-Bulkley non-linear rheological model,
in permanent simple shearing conditions. As explained by Ancey (2007),
mixtures mainly composed by clay (colloidal mixtures) have strong non-
Newtonian behavior and yield stress exponentially increase with material
concentration. Based on experimental rheological studies (Coussot and
Piau, 1994; Remaître et al., 2005; Ancey, 2007; Maciel et al., 2009), yield
stress (?0) is roughly estimated around 200 Pa. Concerning index ?ow,
some results show that it stabilizes around 0.30, which is not far from 1/3

7.4. Parameters gathering

calibrated for French torrential lava by Coussot (1994). Although di?culty
to predict rheological parameters, consistency index Kn can be estimated
from 50 to 1000 Pasn by the same works.

Freestream velocity u? was recorded by Berti et al. (2000) through
video and image processing. Values obtained after the ?rst surge and be-
fore the wave train (t &amp;lt;900 s) suggest that mean freestream velocity was
about 3.46 ms?1. Wave celerity and amplitude are related on left side
of Table 7.1. Measurements of water depth from ultrasonic device is not
completely reliable, since the channel was eroded during the event (chan-
nel bottom reference is lost). The iterative method (previously explained
on section 7.1) was then applied using the other parameters found (?uid
characteristics, free surface velocity and wave celerities) to calculate such
information. Using the available data, the iterative method was performed
using equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.5. Values for u0 and h0 were found for each
wave, as shown in the right side of Table 7.1. Mean values were also cal-
culated, as shown in the last line of Table 7.1, using mean values for waves
celerities and amplitudes. The method was initialized assuming u0 = u?
and ? = 1. Calculations follow in loop until all parameters have values that
have converged.

To assume a typical or expected roll waves pattern to travel along Ac-
quabona creek, the mean values from Table 7.1 should be taken as reference
to perform one single simulation which was here called ?expected? wave. As
explained in section 7.1, this analysis gives the maximum expected wave
properties for a given scenario. All input parameters for expected waves

7.6. Non-Newtonian e?ect on maximum wave prediction

The ?rst evidence is that simulations do not present satisfactory ampli-
tudes for each wave separately. However, when comparing to mean ampli-
tude of wave train selected, the model would be rather capable to identify
the proper scale of waves amplitude presenting di?erence of 8%. To under-
stand the variability of results and a possible source of discrepancies, we
evaluated the e?ects of non-Newtonian properties on results in the following
section 7.6.

7.6 Non-Newtonian e?ect on maximum wave prediction

Rheological properties of ?uid play an important role on waves properties.
Based on typical results given by the model, we evaluated how would wave's
amplitude change with rheological parameters. The assumption that sedi-
ment concentration would change along the channel as bed erosion advanced
is plausible and veri?ed by (Berti et al., 1999, 2000).

As can be observed in Figure 7.5, for weak non-Newtonian e?ects (smaller
yield stress and greater index ?ow), waves amplitude decrease. Conversely,
for strong non-Newtonian e?ects (greater yield stress, and smaller index
?ow), the opposite is noticed.

Choosing two extreme cases, as discriminates Table 7.4, waves amplitude
can vary depending on non-Newtonian e?ects, yield stress and index ?ow.
Given the set of parameters, a less non-Newtonian ?uid would generate
roll waves amplitudes 20% smaller than the expected case, . The opposite
happens for more non-Newtonian ?uids, as they increase roll waves am-
plitudes in 6% in comparison to expected waves amplitude, as illustrates
Figure 7.6. Then, the variation in time of ?uid composition could explain
the observed scattering of wave height data reported by Berti et al. (2000).
Qualitatively, we noticed that ?uid rheological properties can also a?ect
wavelength/period, as shows Figure 7.6.

7.7 Roll waves modeling as a risk assessment tool

From an Engineering point of view, relation between speci?c discharge and
the mean ?ow height allows further identi?cation of risks at stake during
an event. The employment of a proper friction law is, most of the time,

indicates prediction of mean ?ow height using cases from Table 7.4, for less and
more non-Newtonian ?uids.

One important feature to notice is the minimum discharge for roll waves
to be prone to be generated. For turbulent inviscid ?ows, low discharge
would be required, since the channel have high slope. For Fr &gt; 2, qRWCh &gt;
0.002 m2s?1, then most of the inviscid-turbulent curve shown in Figure 7.7
represent a favorable domain for roll waves appearance. Such value would

increase for laminar ?ows: qRWN &gt; 1.07; and qRWNN &gt; qmin = 0.35 m
2s?1.

This fact indicates that roll waves could have appeared for speci?c discharge
much lower than qacqua. Since turbulent inviscid approach would fail to
properly predict the mean ?ow height, we evaluated roll waves for the two
other cases. The roll waves domain for viscous laminar ?ows present waves
that have smaller amplitudes than those for the non-Newtonian domain.
This results points out that, in any case scenario, in addition to the non-
Newtonian rheology, roll waves model should be considered to predict the
event of Acquabona creek in 1998.

8.1 Introduction

One problem in ?uid mechanics that recently has been more addressed is
the dynamics of Herschel-Bulkley ?uids in presence of a porous medium.
Even though non-Newtonian ?uids have been largely studied on that matter
(Sabiri and Comiti, 1995; Sochi, 2010), the presence of yield is not easily
assigned. The kernel of the problem resides in the interaction between the
nature of the ?uid (mixture, suspension, etc.) and the void geometry that
constitutes the porous medium. When dealing with suspensions, for exam-
ple, particles can be clogged inside the voids by many capture processes,
which then would change the porosity of the medium over time (Herzig
et al., 1970), thus completely changing the problem itself. However, when
dealing with oil industry problems and polymers, yield non-Newtonian ?u-
ids can sometimes interact with porous boundaries.

The problem that is undertaken in this chapter is how dynamics of a non-
Newtonian ?uid ?ow presenting Herschel-Bulkley rheology would change
due the presence of a permeable medium as boundary condition. Open-
channel ?ow was considered, so that the permeable medium, or porous
medium, was found in the bottom of the channel. The porous medium is
composed by ?xed particles of diameter D, arranged randomly. This prob-
lem could somehow not only be related to technical and industrial issues
but also be related to natural ?ows, where conditions allow.

Here again, the conditions announced on section 2.3 are valid. The con-
servation equations are represented by the system of equations 2.23a, 2.23b
and 2.23c. The di?erence that is present in this problem is that ?uid is

119



8. Search for a more complex model

allowed to ?ow inside the medium that composes the bed, which now is
?xed1. The bed have a porosity p, i.e. void space in bed material su?cient
permeable for ?ow ?uid to ?ll them in. At this point, we should have what
is called a Darcian-like ?ow, as illustrates Figure 8.1. For the steady and
uniform case, velocity and free surface height are both constant values u0
and h0, respectively. Inside the porous medium a ?ow is also established
with velocities up and vp.

Figure 8.1: Schematic representation of ?ow. The non-Newtonian ?uid is now
?owing inside the porous bed.

8.2 Mathematical development

8.2.1 Boundary Condition

It is required to ?nd the relationship between pressure drop on porous
medium and Darcian velocity (up,vp) to properly assume the boundary
conditions on the interface bed-?uid. A large review on the subject is
presented on Chhabra et al. (2001) where dynamics of non-Newtonian ?uids
(power-law ?uids) on di?erent porous media are related. In that work, the
authors made clear that ?uid properties greatly change its dynamics inside
tortuous paths a?ecting the macro behavior, which is summarized by a
Darcy's Law type relation. Following previous works from Beavers and
Joseph (1967) and Rao and Mishra (2004), we assumed continuity of shear

deposition, and bed is plane; or ?ow erosional capacity is no longer su?cient to entrain

rate on the interface through the following boundary condition:

????
y=0

=
?

k

n+1

(u?up). (8.1)

where ? is a form factor of voids inside the porous medium and k is the
permeability of the porous medium.

The shearing conditions exhibited by equation 8.1 can be assumed as the
non-Newtonian e?ect from yield stress is comprised by means of longitudinal
Darcian velocity up. The other boundary condition is related to the normal
velocity in the porous medium which, on the interface, should not vary once
it is inside the boundary layer. So:

vp = v, for y = 0. (8.2)

Recalling the recent work from Chevalier et al. (2013), those authors
present an adaptation of Darcy's Law to Herschel-Bulkley ?uids based on
experimental data for a polymeric solution of Carbopol ?owing through a
porous medium. Chevalier et al. advised that the relation between pressure
drop and Darcian velocity should have the form

?

kI

kK

unp, (8.3)

where kI and kK, de?ned in this thesis, are porous medium parameters
relating shape, dispersion of material inside the pores and voids of porous
medium. Both parameters correspond to the permeability used to de?ne
properties of porous medium. The ?rst parameter kI we call here inertial
permeability. It represents how the structure of the porous medium coupled
to the non-Newtonian rheology opposes the movement of the ?uid. The
second one we call kinematic permeability: its understand as the classical
permeability coe?cient, and it measures the ability of the porous material
to allow ?uids to ?ow through it. Following the work previously mentioned
(Chevalier et al., 2013), both variables should be function of the shape of
the porous medium, although the second one also depends on the ?uid
rheology, as shows Equations 8.4 and 8.5 for a ?xed porosity:

kI =

kK =

which is called in the present work as inertial and kinetic permeability,
respectively. For a variable porosity, Equation 8.5 could be represented as

The concepts here presented, adapted from Darcy's Law for Newtonian
?uids, can only be guaranteed for non-Newtonian ?uids as long as ?uids do
not present special interactions with the medium. Filtration and clogging,
for example, which have been taken into account during experiments from
Chevalier et al. (2013) do not properly ?t when solid particles with con-
siderable size are in suspension. Particles in suspensions must have mean
diameter much smaller than pore space, so that no clogging of microchan-
nels happens, and porosity is kept constant. Then, adapting Darcy's law
for a Herschel-Bulkley ?uid,

where Pp represent total pressure in the porous medium and Pp = P for
y = 0. Hydrostatic pressure is assumed, and scales between ?ow over and
inside the bed are estimated. Then, pressure gradient inside porous medium
is the same as in the ?ow thus leading to the pressure scale

as shows Equation 8.16.

where y0 = h0 ??0/(?g sin ?) is the plug ?ow height which can be rewritten
as y0 = h0(1 ?C?).

An important feature introduced by a porous bottom is that the inter-
face allows ?ow to ?slip? on the interface (Chen and Zhu, 2008). At the
bottom (z = 0),

8.3 Veri?cation of solution for less complex conditions

The solution can be veri?ed for ?xed beds (non-porous) by making ? = 0.
Also, for less complex rheologies simple substitution of parameters can be
used to reach less complex solutions.

8.3.1 Bingham rheology

For a Bingham-type rheology, ?uid presents yield but there is a linear rela-
tionship between shear rate and shear stress. In simple shearing conditions
the rheological model is:

? = ?0 + µB

(

?y

)
, for ? &gt; ?0, (8.23)

where µB is the Bingham plastic viscosity and ?0 the yield stress, as we
know. Comparing Equation 8.23 with Equation 2.21, we see that n = 1.

8.3.2 Power law rheology

tionship is observed between shear rate and shear stress. In simple shearing
conditions the rheological model is:

? = µn

, (8.26)

where µn is the plastic viscosity and nis the power law ?ow index. Com-
paring Equation 8.26 with Equation 2.21, we see that ?0 = 0.

Chapter 9

Numerical simulations

To verify the mathematical solution proposed in chapter 8, numerical simu-
lations were carried in FLUENT c©1 using experimental data of carbopol so-
lutions from the literature. Numerical schemes used to solve equations were
based on ?nite volume method for steady laminar ?ow (Patankar and Spald-
ing, 1972; Versteg and Malalasekera, 1995). For the pressure-velocity cou-
pling, semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations-consistent (SIM-
PLEC) method was applied (VanDoormal and Raithby, 1984). Pressure in-
terpolation was conducted using the pressure staggering option (PRESTO)
routine. For the convective terms, a second order user-de?ned scalar was
used and for the free surface computation, the implicit volume of ?uid high
resolution interface capturing (HRIC) scheme was chosen (Ubbink and Issa,
1999). Two-dimensional domain was meshed using non-uniform trilateral
polygons. The re?nement level of the meshing depended on the proximity
to the objects composing the bed. The mesh was dense (? 10?4m cross-
sectional length for cell grids) for the carbopol phase (inside the porous
medium and in free ?ow) and sparse for the air phase ((? 10?2m).

The non-Newtonian rheology is implemented in the software using Pa-
panastasiou (1987) Herschel-Bulkley rheological model:

? = ?0

)

where the exponent m is responsible for the growth rate of stress to respect

. Such exponent is set given mesh conditions.

9. Numerical simulations

9.1 Numerical modeling

The model test chosen was based on previous studies from Prinos et al.
(2003) and Chan et al. (2007). The porous bed is modeled as a macroscopic
porous medium composed by 2D disk of diameter D, uniformly spaced in
the domain between impermeable wall at y = 0 and y = hp, as shows
Figure 9.1. l1 is the vertical distance between ?rst disk and impermeable
wall and l2 is vertical distance between disks. The porous bed element
shown has length Lp and is periodic along channel length. The porosity is
then calculated by total porous bed element domain (Sp = hpLp) and wall
disks surface (Sw) as p = 1 ?Sp/Sw.

Figure 9.1: Schematic illustration of computational element of the porous bed.
The element repeats its pattern along the total length of computational domain
where the bottom impermeable wall is the loer boundary of the domain.

Geometry of bed and test-?uid properties are ?xed constant following
parameters shown on tables 9.1 and 9.2, respectively. The ?uid chosen for
simulations was based on Leite (2009) and Roberts and Barnes (2001)'s
experiments. Carbopol solutions are versatile ?uids that have been largely
employed on non-Newtonian ?uid experiments. Gravity and inlet discharge
were then controlled to obtain di?erent experimental runs described Ta-
ble 9.3. The index Q on test run identi?es the inlet discharge, I the slope
and F the ?uid.

9.2 Numerical results

Flow height is detected where the isocontour for 0.5 is observed. Velocity
?eld is then analyzed and used to compute a mean ?ow velocity pro?le
and mean ?ow velocity. These results are then used to compute dimen-
sionless numbers that help understand ?ow regime (Reynolds number -
Equation 2.22; Froude number - Equation 2.29; and C? - Equation 2.24).

An example of the solution obtained for ?ow can be observed on Fig-
ure 9.2 for the numerical run Q1I3F3. Expected behavior of the solution is
observed. In the Figure 9.2, the ?ow inside the porous bed is negligible as
velocity is approximately zero. On the interface between porous bed and
open-channel ?ow (channel bottom line), a non-zero velocity is obtained.
Flow plug zone is observed in the upper region of the pro?le, characteristic
of yield ?uids.

Numerical results point out that Darcian velocity measured inside the porous
medium (upnum) had relatively greater scale than the one predicted by the-

eter ? from Equation 8.18 is properly estimated. For a internal ?ow (no
atmospheric pressure), such value can be estimated based on the geometry
of porous medium, in our case, the disposition of rods in our porosity com-
putational element. As well for on open-channel ?ows, this value should
vary depending on the complex interaction between ?ow and porous geom-
etry. To obtain such value, the maximum correlation between discharges
from both results was sought, varying ? parameter on Equation 8.18. A
mean value ? = 0.191 was found, which seems in agreement with previous
works (0.1 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;4) (Beavers and Joseph, 1967; Pascal, 2006).

Then, the velocity pro?le can be compared, as shows 9.4 numerical runs
Q1I3 and Q1I4. When comparing velocity pro?les between tests with the
same discharge (Figure 9.5), its possible to identify that behavior of curves
is similar thus pointing out that theoretical relation also represent those
results. These results clearly show that the slip velocity, or bottom velocity
uB = u(y = 0) should depend on ?ow and/or ?uid and/or porous medium
parameters, as expected (Equation 8.20).

Apart from mean ?ow velocity, two other characteristics velocities can
be used to evaluate agreement between results and mathematical model:
bottom slip velocity uB; and plug ?ow velocity uy0. The ?rst one presents
a 4.8% standard deviation around 1, towards equivalence. For the second
on, a standard deviation is found to be 0.3% around 0.99, thus presenting
a tendency of underestimating plug ?ow velocity. For bottom velocity, no
systematical evidence was found that could relate standard deviation and
?ow/porous parameters (as shows Figure 9.6). The source of such variations

9.2.3 Boundary conditions veri?cation

To understand the discrepancy observed between theoretical and numerical
values for the bottom velocity uB, we looked upon the dimensionless form
of the boundary condition obtained in the mathematical modeling in sub-
section 8.2.1, given by Equation 8.15.

As can be seen on Figure 9.7, for the numerical runs here performed,
greater values for (1 ?C?)?1??1 points out a less representative boundary
condition. For small yield stress (small C?) considerable e?ect of porosity
(great ?), the curve ?ts the boundary condition. This could indicate that
the boundary conditions adopted would require further improvement to bet-
ter ?t the characteristics of the ?ow here explored. Other e?ects might as
well contribute to the discrepancy observed as the geometry of the ?ow, for
example.

9.3 Mathematical analysis

The velocity pro?le u(y) is studied to respect the plug velocity u(y0) which
corresponds to the freestream velocity (free surface velocity), and the ver-
tical coordinate y to respect y0 thus scaling the problem, as shows equation
9.3.

where Y = y/y0. It's also valuable to de?ne the free surface height which
should be equal to H0 = h0/y0 = 1/(1?C?). Mean ?ow velocity Um is then
calculated as

. (9.4)

The e?ect of the porous bed over the velocity can be summarized as the
promotion of a slip velocity on the interface between the bed and the ?ow.
Figure 9.8 shows that for a solid bed (? = 0), interface velocity U|Y =0 = 0.

135



9. Numerical simulations

However, the smallest increase in bed porosity leads to a non-zero velocity
at the interface. For shear thinning ?uids (n &amp;lt;1), the interface velocity
increases more rapidly with porosity.

When in presence of a yield stress, the same behavior is noticed. This
e?ect lead to a mean ?ow velocity Um which is closer to freestream velocity
the higher yield stress parameter C?, as shows ?gure 9.8. This observa-
tion is in agreement with the plug zone which is greater as the yield stress
increases, thus leading to a quasi-constant velocity distribution over the ver-
tical coordinate. Numerical and, most importantly, experimental validation
of the velocity pro?le should be employed to assure hypothesis adopted in
this work. When dealing with ?uid composed by sediment particles, per-
colation e?ect can hardly be avoided, thus obstructing the proper use of
such mathematical development. However, for homogeneous ?uids such as
emulsions and gels, these assumptions should be reasonable and could be
veri?ed experimentally.

Supposing the same discharge (q = u0h0) entering a non-porous bed
(? = 0), Equation 9.4 can be used to calculate the mean ?ow velocity
in these conditions U?|?=0, and compared to the one when a porous bed is
present. Figure 9.9 shows that a signi?cant increase in mean ?ow velocity is
obtained when ?uid have low yield stress level. However, high level of yield
indicates that a greater plug zone is formed, thus diminishing the in?uence
of the slip velocity, therefore the in?uence of porosity, as we can see in the
last picture from Figure 9.9. These observations, especially concerning the
increase of velocity, corroborate the in?uence of the porous bed.

Chapter 10

Revisiting Acquabona

Based on the model presented on the chapter before, the Acquabona test
case presented on chapter 7 can revisited. The relation found between the
mean ?ow velocity and ?ow height can give a new insight of the Acquabona
event of 1998.

10.1 Parameter gathering

In order to correctly employ the mathematical model proposed in chapter 8,
the proper input parameters should be found. When considering the porous
bed, some properties are needed: porosity of the bed p; mean particles di-
ameter that compose the bed D50; a form factor ? for the voids that would
have been formed in between the sediment material in the Acquabona re-
gion.

As elucidated in Kasenow (2001), the porosity found in the dolomites
are between 0.191 and 0.327. However, as the event takes place in a slope
deposit region downstream the dolomite region, we consider that the soil
was mainly composed by gravels and sedimentary material. We arbitrarily
choose p = 0.4, and will evaluate how the same parameter could a?ect the
prediction of the results.

It is understood that the natural channel formed in the Acquabona re-
gion was carved by successive mass movements. In this way, we can consider
that the bottom of that channel is composed by past events. Then, events
reported before the event or even later events can inform the mean sed-
iment size of particles diameter. (Gregoretti and Fontana, 2008) related

139



10. Revisiting Acquabona

many events in the Acquabona region and a particular measure was done
in August 2000 (after the event here studied). The measures all point out
that the mean particle size can be chosen as D50 = 0.137 meter.

The void shape factor ? is the most uncertain parameter among all.
Its value is often ?xed between 0.1 and 4 in the literature, but no precise
method to determine its value have been developed yet. The assessment
of ? in?uence will be a part of the evaluation of the results here presented.
For the ?rst simulation that will be shown, we adopted ? = 0.25.

10.2 Recalculating Acquabona event

Using the parameters gathered before and solving the equations, the com-
parison can be made using the last ?gure from chapter 7 using now also
a curve for the non-Newtonian rheology ?uid ?ow when in presence of a
porous bed (Figure 10.1).

It is observed that given the same speci?c discharge q0, for a same ?uid
type, ?ow height is smaller when in presence of the porous bed. This is due
to the reduced friction on the bottom (smaller sheared zone) induced by the
slip velocity in the boundary between the bed and the ?ow. Close to the
speci?c discharge qacqua where ? = 0.03, the di?erence measured for mean
?ow height is about 5% from porous to ?xed bed. Since less resistance is
felt by ?ow, the velocity should be greater when in presence of a porous
bed. Such reasoning was explored in chapter 10. We can construct the
same kind of ?gure for the mean ?ow velocity as shows Figure 10.2, where
the variation of velocity is around 5%.

Both ?gures presented before can be summarized by means of the pa-
rameter ? (Equation 8.18). As bed porous properties are kept constant
and speci?c discharge is increased, h0 increases so leading to a smaller ?
parameter.Figure 10.3 presents the same results from Figures 10.1 and 10.2
now using the ratio between mean ?ow properties for non-Newtonian ?uids
?owing over a porous bed and those for ?xed bed (? = 0).

The dimensionless parameter of porosity ? would vary from 0.02 to 0.2,
depending on the ?ow discharge rate which promoted variations on mean
?ow properties of approximately 7%, as shows Figure 10.3. Such variations
could be in the same order of magnitude as measurements uncertainties,
thus rendering their e?ects unnoticeable. As elucidated on chapter 10, the

porosity dimensionless parameter ? would only present signi?cant e?ect
(considering the scale we are currently dealing with) for great values. Since
that parameter is a function of the soil properties ?, p and D50, we should
understand how it could change the values, consequently changing mean
?ow properties.

Observing now only u0, we explored the in?uence of parameters ? and p
on the mean ?ow velocity as presents Figure 10.4. From both graphics, we
note that varying values from those parameters inside an acceptable range,
the e?ect of ? can be somehow increased for highly porous media (high p,
than high kK) and for low form factor, reaching higher velocities, up to 16%

Discussion and conclusions

In this work we have investigated unsteady phenomena on open-channels
?ows that are related to the natural hazards named as mud?ows. We have
focused the research on two main stages of the development of a potential
mud?ow: the surface runo? and the mud?ow itself.

For the ?rst stage, an experimental approach was considered and the
main idea was to inspect the time properties of the solid transport, com-
posed by a mean value and ?uctuations. The methodology here employed
was developed and tested for some test cases and seems to be a powerful
tool for sediment discharge study in time. A simple method for ?ow friction
measurements was adapted from aeolian transport experiments and proved
to be a reasonable method to understand the energy distribution in ?ow
friction due to turbulent structures.

Experimental runs were performed and their results were studied regard-
ing mean, ?uctuation and spectral behaviors. It was shown that ?uctuations
of solid transport depend almost instantaneously on ?ow ?uctuations fol-
lowing the relation between averaged transport and averaged friction. As
free-surface instabilities were applied to the ?ow, it seems that the mean
solid discharge is reduced. Conversely the ?uctuations intensities of solid
transport increase. This would constitute a result that could give directions
for practical Engineering purpose, pointing out that instabilities presence
actually diminish erosion and sediment entrainment..

For the second stage, a ?rst-order mathematical model for roll-waves
free surface instabilities was used to simulate a natural mass movement
event registered in the literature. The properties of the ?uid were found
to greatly in?uence the predictability of the model, an observation greatly

11. Discussion and conclusions

mentioned in the literature. However, the model seems to work well and
to give coherent insight on the waves properties, even for a highly ran-
dom event. We highlight that such use of the model would have practical
applications in Engineering for risk assessment and control of risk zones, al-
though it might be required more validation based on in situ measurements.

In order to understand how the complexity of the problem would change
as porosity e?ect is added to the problem, a mathematical model was pro-
posed for non-Newtonian ?uids ?ow over a porous medium. Given the
analytical solution, numerical simulations were performed to explore the
compatibility with the mathematical results. Good agreement was found
between both, although it seems that the boundary condition used would
require further investigation. The test-case used to analyze the roll waves
mathematical model was then reevaluated to check whether the porosity
e?ect would change the overall prediction.

11.1 Runo? ?ows and time-variable transport

11.1.1 Experimental method

The experimental method employed to assess a time-variable value for fric-
tion velocity, rather intuitive, have proven its capacity to understand the
?ow energy distribution in the spectral domain. The drawback in our case
comes from the fact that ?ow and transport measurements were performed
in two separate set of experiments. It allowed a statistical analysis of the
relations between mean and ?uctuating quantities but not a real time rela-
tion between simultaneous values of them. However, since the ?uctuations
of the velocity ?eld showed good agreement with results from the literature,
conclusions on instantaneous relation could be postulated.

The methodology employed to measured the solid discharge has proven
its usefulness and allowed many analysis to be performed. One main tech-
nical issue found during experiments was that the light source used in ex-
periments should be as uniform as possible and ?uid should be clean. Such
combination gives a good contrast level in images between ?uid and shadow
from particles. If no good contrast is found, images will require further im-
age processing, which might induce noise and error in particles detection.
At this point, the enhancing technique developed works in most of the times,
and only results that were proven to be generated from properly detection

148



11.1. Runo? ?ows and time-variable transport

have been studied.

Some corrections must be applied to the signals depending on the mor-
phological characteristics of particles detected since the model uses the in-
dividual mass and velocity of each particle to calculate the solid discharge.
Those corrections are explained and are corroborated by the results pre-
sented.

11.1.2 Time-dependent solid discharge in turbulent permanent ?ow

We developed three main analysis in the solid discharge signals: mean solid
discharge against Shields number; ?uctuation intensities of solid discharge;
and spectral properties of non-stationary solid discharge.

The ?rst analysis based on the mean sediment transport allowed to eval-
uate the quality of the results when comparing to classical empirical laws
from the literature. For the experimental runs presented in steady solid
discharge, results are congruent with the empirical laws of (Meyer-Peter
and Müller, 1948) and (Wong and Parker, 2006).

To understand the role of ?uctuations of friction velocity to the sediment
transport, we derived an expression from the averaged transport, that re-
lates both of them. This relation present a strong non-linearity when close
to threshold ?ows (Sh ? Shc). Scaling the ?uctuation intensities of trans-
port with its mean value, we observed that ?uctuations are high when close
to the imminence of transport (Sh ? Shc) and they reach a constant value
for Sh &gt; 4Shc. We show then that ?uctuations of transport are related to
?uctuations of ?ow. The constant value reached for su?cient high Shields
number is related to the intensity of turbulence in ?ow, which should be
constant given ?xed geometry and ?ow discharge. The increase in ?uctu-
ations when close to threshold is related to the non-linearity of transport
behavior due to the threshold of movement. Both e?ects are captured by
the empirical law derived in the present work.

The power spectral density allows the observation on how sediment
transport energy distribution is made. We detected that two factors can
a?ect the way sediment transport happens in time:

• bedforms;

• turbulent ?uctuations;

149



11. Discussion and conclusions

The PSDs show that sediment transport energy is distributed accord-
ingly to a turbulent ?ow: low frequencies have high energy and high fre-
quencies have low energy. Whenever only turbulence seems to a?ect the
bedload transport, close to bed turbulent structures are responsible for the
?uctuations found in the solid discharge. Low frequencies (thus large time
scale structures) present an energy decay to high frequencies equals to ?1.
This slope would correspond to the decay of energy of turbulent structures
close toe bed. However, when bedforms appear, they seem to homogenize
?ow turbulence and the energy decay assumes the ?5/3 exponent. This de-
cay of energy would rather represent isotropic turbulent ?ow, which could
only be present away from the walls (Radice et al., 2009). This fact could
be an evidence on how the bedforms can alter the kind of transport mode,
making turbulent structures have more in?uence on particles dynamics.
Such observations have also been made by Guignier (2014) in experiments
in closed channel ?ow, where they observed that mean solid discharge in-
crease whenever bedforms starts to develop.

11.1.3 Time-dependent solid discharge in pulsating ?ows

For the unsteady transport when ?ow disturbances were applied, the ?rst
analysis shows a decrease in solid transport. Given the same ?ow conditions
(Re, Fr and Sh), disturbing the system clearly decrease the mean solid dis-
charge, i.e. ?ow capacity of transporting sediments. However, the empirical
correlation keeps its power law form, conserving the exponent between 1.5
or 1.8, as present the results.

The ?rst logical assumption is that ?ow mean friction velocity has been
reduced. Since the friction velocity is related to the turbulence level of the
?ow, we have observed the intensities of ?uctuation ?eld. Horizontal ?uc-
tuation intensities showed greater values close to the free surface, but not
?uctuations close to the bed where they kept the same magnitude, and did
not presented any signi?cant reduction that could explain the decrease ob-
served in solid transport. The explanation could lie in the waveform of the
free instabilities. As observed for roll waves mathematical solutions (Noble,
2004; Ng and Mei, 1994; Toniati et al., 2015), the bottom shear stress follows
the shape of the free surface, sometimes presenting a lag. The shape, like a
wave train, have a trough period greater than the peak period. Such e?ect
would make the mean bottom shear stress to be reduced when compared
to the uniform and steady ?ow. Another possible explanation relates the
elements of energy dissipation for a given averaged ?ow discharge allegedly

kept constant (Figure 11.1). If energy dissipation is partitioned between
mean and ?uctuating dissipations, the presence of waves increases the ?uc-
tuating component (which do not change mean values). This would indicate
that mean ?ow would have less dissipation, thus inducing a reduced wall
friction (related to D on Figure 11.1) responsible for the sediment transport.

The ?uctuation intensities of solid discharge show an interesting aspect.
Based on the results shown in Figure 5.20, we see that applying a distur-
bance into the free surface of the ?ow induces an increase in solid discharge
?uctuations. As we proved, solid particles in movement follow the ?ow char-
acteristics in the same way: mean solid transport are related to mean ?ow
properties; ?uctuation of solid transport are related to ?uctuation intensi-
ties of ?ow. Free-surface instabilities do not seem to change the in?uence
that u??RMS have on the ?ow as shown Equation 5.15 and Figure 5.20.

The power spectral density of the signals of solid transport do not bring
any new information and instead corroborate what have been already dis-
cussed: for low Shields number, the ?1 decay of energy is noticed; for in-
termediary and strong Shields number, the ?5/3 decay takes place. Some
spectral gap zones can sometimes be perceived (Singh et al., 2010), but since
we are not able to direct correlate them with ?ow velocity ?uctuations, it is
not possible to con?rm its origin. No evidence was found in the PSD that

151



11. Discussion and conclusions

the disturbance applied had direct in?uence on the solid discharge since no
peak on waves frequency was observed. Such conclusion seems plausible as
we look into ?ow ?uctuation intensities: the e?ects of the disturbance on
the ?ow appear only close to the free surface away from particles trajecto-
ries (close to bottom). Then, no direct in?uence should be perceived.

11.2 Mathematical models for free surface instabilities in

mud?ows

11.2.1 Acquabona test-case

One of the greatest issues in the geophysical scienti?c community is the
de?nition of limits for characterization of di?erent mass movement phe-
nomena (Hungr et al., 2001). As the citation used in the ?rst chapter of
this thesis shows, even the USGS (United States Geological Survey), one
of the greatest institutions in this ?eld, does not de?ne so straightforward
mass movement. The fundamental characteristic that di?erentiate mass
movements is the ratio water/solid sediment and their velocity propaga-
tion. Such ratio for the Acquabona creek event (chapter 6) is not well
de?ne by researchers that collected the samples. So, the proper and cor-
rect de?nition of the event is compromised. Nevertheless, debris and mud
?ows are not distant from a rheological point of view and then allowed this
research to happen and to test the mathematical model. To quantify the
turbulent dissipation contribution during the event would possibly increase
the uncertainties within the input parameters set to the model, rendering
it less reliable.

The model used for Acquabona creek simulations has proven its useful-
ness when predicting mean wave properties. A relatively small discrepancy
of 8% is found between predicted and mean value from measurements for
waves amplitudes. The origin of such discrepancy could be explained in
di?erent ways. One possible explanation could be the di?culty to precisely
quantify the rheological properties of the ?owing material. The represen-
tation of such complex mixture by a rheological model implies intrinsically
a limitation as rheology models average mixture behavior. As size of par-
ticles in ?uid matrix may vary from dust and clay (? 1 µm) to rock and
boulders (? 1 m), their dynamics in ?uid matrix are completely averaged
into simpli?ed shearing laws. Even though, assuming the Herschel-Bulkley
rheological model, we were able to evaluate the e?ect of ?uid rheological

152



11.2. Mathematical models for free surface instabilities in mud?ows

parameters. Such matter was discussed in section 7.6 where variations of
rheological properties led to a variation range of possible roll waves ampli-
tudes of 30% for the Acquabona event.

11.2.2 More complex model for non-Newtonian ?ows in natural
environment

One of the possible reasons for the approximative results of roll waves model
when compared to ?eld studies is that the model does not yet represent all
the complexity and variability of the natural environment which could mis-
lead the results. Then, one approximation that could enhance the results
is the assumption of a porous ?xed bed in the bottom of the channel. At
this time, ?uid is allowed to ?ow in between the voids present in the bed,
created by the rocks and sediments. In this way, the ?ow would change and
present a bottom slip velocity. No bedforms are considered, so bed is ?at.

In this work it was presented a mathematical solution for velocity pro?le
of laminar free surface ?ows of non-Newtonian ?uids presenting Herschel-
Bulkley rheology over a porous bed. Additional numerical simulation showed
that the mathematical solution is in agreement with the simulated one. A
discrepancy is found between the boundary condition imposed in the math-
ematical model and numerical results, which leads to errors in the order of
10% on the bottom velocity uB. The identi?cation of form factor ? still
rests empirical as no consistent methodology is able to determine how prop-
erly estimate such parameter.

The mathematical solution proves that general ?ow properties (h0 and
u0) are a?ected by the bed. It is noticed that the index ?ow n is and im-
portant parameter for proper estimation of the bottom slip velocity, and
this index ?ow can signi?cantly change ?ow dynamics close to the bottom.
Nevertheless, yield stress ?0 acts in a di?erent way reducing the overall in-
?uence of bottom on the mean ?ow velocity. An interesting observation is
the e?ect of bottom velocity (non-zero due the presence of a porous ?ow)
with rheological parameters. The presence of such velocity at the interface
between channel bottom and ?ow decreases proportionally the size of the
sheared region, thus increasing the proportion of plug zone and the mean
?ow velocity. This seems a rather typical behavior and in?uence of porous
medium walls to the general ?ow dynamics. However, the importance of
porous bed decreases as ?uid become more and more non-Newtonian (in-

153



11. Discussion and conclusions

creasing yield or decreasing index ?ow). Such observation is rather direct,
but since the ?ow discharge is considered constant, some changes in the
?ow height should be noticed when comparing the non-porous bed when
dealing with open-channel ?ows.

When using the new proposed model to establish the relation ?ow dis-
charge and ?ow height for the Acquabona test-case, we veri?ed that for a
natural environment, with a highly non-Newtonian ?uid ?ow, the poros-
ity does not have a signi?cant importance in terms of ?ow height predic-
tion. Since the non-Newtonian parameters play a role much more important
than the porosity (when both are combined), engineering projects would be
much more safe predicting with accurate values of the rheological param-
eters (thus decreasing their uncertainties) than considering the additional
e?ect of porosity. What still rests unknown is how roll waves domain of
generation would be altered. Following the literature (Pascal, 2006), we
expect that the domain of roll waves generation would increase, i.e. roll
waves would be capable to appear for lower Froude numbers. This might
as well be an important factor for predicting the ?ow height, as it has been
already discussed during the thesis.

Finally, all these observations should be veri?ed experimentally as they
would change, for example, the correct interpretation or prediction of ?ows
by dimensionless number such as Reynolds and Froude numbers, which de-
pend on characteristic ?ow variables. More numerical simulation should
also be performed to better verify the boundary conditions employed in the
mathematical problem. The comprehension of this kind of ?ow dynamics
is crucial when dealing with industrial and civil structures dimensioning
which relies upon such informations.

Perspectives

This work gives some perspectives on how further investigations would help
to understand the phenomena here studied and to improve the research on
the domain.

12.1 Part I - Sediment transport in runo? ?ows

From the experimental point of view, even though the method employed
proved its e?ciency for studying sediment transport, further improvements
should be sought to improve quality of results and further data analysis.

12.1.1 Technical improvements

A PIV system coupled with the PTV and with higher acquisition rate (in
the same order of magnitude of the solid transport) would help further
cross-correlation studies and to precisely detect how ?ow and sediment
entrainment are related to each other. In this way, smaller scales might
be understood, and further explanation on ?uctuation of transport bet-
ter explained based on ?ow characteristics. Simultaneous measurements of
friction and transport would allow cross-correlation analysis and a better
inderstaing on the validity of the transport law in timescale description.

Concerning the solid discharge method, we think that di?erent image
processing techniques might give di?erent results which would have to be
treated di?erently before the calculations ofn the information required. A
parallel method was tested during this PhD and shown that quality of

155



12. Perspectives

results should depend on the quality of signal treatment (images), and not
only on the images themselves.

12.1.2 Statistical analysis of particle counting events

PTV method proved to be a reasonable method for calculating the solid
discharge ?simpler? methods might give the same results with less infor-
mation. The data available from this work should have, for example, an
statistical exploration from the counting signals, ignoring particles mass and
velocities, in order to understand the dynamics of particles arrival events.
Preliminary results were performed during this thesis and showed promising
results. The method could be employ using di?erent statistical approaches
(following renewal or renewal-reward theories, for example) to explore dif-
ferent information from the signals.

12.1.3 Mathematical model bottom shear stress on roll waves regime

A proper mathematical approach of the e?ects of roll waves into the bottom
shear in presence of a mobile bed seems still missing in the literature. The
development of a simple formulation capable to describe how the friction
change depending on ?ow parameters and bed characteristics would be use-
ful to compare with the experimental results here presented. This project
is already under development in the Brazilian research group RMVP where
this PhD candidate have been working.

12.2 Part II - Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows over natural

environments

12.2.1 Mathematical modeling and validation

The mathematical model employed in this work to study a natural event
is yet to be completely reliable. It was shown that for the Acquabona test
case it has been able to give the order of magnitude of the problem. Toi
guarantee its utility from an engineering perspective, others text cases have
to be employed to satisfactorily prove its functionality. Mass movements
events all across the globe have been registered in the literature and must
be carefully explored to verify the robustness of the results given by the
mathematical approach.

156



12.2. Part II - Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows over natural environments

Turbulent dissipation should be also inserted inside the stress tensor of
the mathematical system so its representativity range would increase. Not
only on the mathematical approach but also numerical and experimentally
non-Newtonian ?uids with turbulent dissipation should be explored. This
would assist the evaluation of the preponderant e?ects in a natural event
like the ones here studied.

12.2.2 Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ow over porous medium

In this work, the analytical solution found for the velocity pro?le of a non-
Newtonian ?uid ?ow over a porous medium was tested against some numer-
ical simulations where the ?uid and ?ow conditions (discharge and slope)
where varied. However, the e?ect of the geometry was not tested, thus de-
manding further work.

Numerical simulations would allow a better veri?cation of the bound-
ary condition adopted for the analytical model. Experimental runs on this
would also be an important work in this matter so the boundary condition
for yield ?uids ?owing over a porous bed could be completely validate or
discarded, if so.

The next stage on the mathematical modeling would be insert the veloc-
ity pro?le into the shallow water equations for a Hershcel-Bulkley ?uid ?ow
and obtain the roll waves equation for this problem. This would culminate
on a more complex model for roll waves and veri?cation of validity of waves
parameters and domain of stability.
