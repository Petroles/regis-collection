RESUMO 
 

A aquicultura é um dos tipos mais modernos de agricultura praticada no Mundo, 

sendo uma das respostas para a crescente demanda por produtos de origem animal e 

seus derivados. Devido à baixa diversidade de espécies produzidas na Europa, surgiu 

a necessidade de diversificar os produtos atualmente produzidos, com a 

implementação de novas espécies passíveis de serem criadas a um nível industrial. 

Nesse contexto, foi proposta a implementação da criação e produção de corvina 

(Argyrosomus regius), por apresentar características necessárias a uma produção 

sustentável: requisitos biológicos facilmente atingíveis (crescimento, fecundidade e 

criação em cativeiro), requisitos tecnológicos (índice de conversão apropriado, ciclo de 

vida bem conhecido) e requisitos de mercado (penetração de mercado, alto valor 

comercial e disponibilidade anual), que, em conjunto com um custo de produção 

reduzido, podem competir com as espécies já cultivadas. 

A corvina faz parte da família Sciaenidae, sendo uma das maiores famílias de 

peixes roncadores, incluindo 270 espécies dentro de 70 géneros. São peixes 

roncadores, porque emitem sons durante a época de desova. Possuem uma ampla 

distribuição entre as regiões temperadas e tropicais do Mundo, incluindo Portugal, de 

Norte a Sul. Atualmente já existem sete espécies cultivadas a nível comercial e/ou 

experimental, das quais a corvina faz parte. A corvina é um peixe teleósteo, sendo um 

dos maiores membros da família Sciaenidae. Pode crescer mais de 180 cm de 

comprimento total e peso superior a 50 kg. Tem uma ampla distribuição, estando 

presente nos mares Mediterrâneo e Negro, na costa Atlântica da Europa e costa oeste 

africana, onde vivem em estuários e águas costeiras, próximo do fundo ou perto da 

superfície (profundidades variam de 15 a 200 m). A qualidade da carne é de alto valor 

nutricional, dando origem ao seu nome latino regius, para qualidade “real” da sua 

carne. O ciclo de vida já está fechado, com muitas “hatcheries” espalhadas por toda a 

Europa, sendo a engorda feita com sucesso em jaulas ou tanques (prática realizada 

nos países do Mediterrâneo, como Grécia, França, Itália, Espanha e Egito). Apesar 

das técnicas para as diferentes fases de criação estarem bem estabelecidas, a 

produção ainda não atingiu o seu potencial pleno, principalmente devido aos 

protocolos alimentares, uma vez que estes são os mesmos utilizados em outras 

espécies, com requisitos bem conhecidos em termos de nutrientes. É um peixe 

carnívoro, que, com a alimentação apropriada, consegue atingir 1 kg em menos de um 

ano (cultivo em jaulas), pelo que um rácio proteína:lípido apropriado será a resposta 

para esse elevado crescimento.  

Relativamente à formulação de uma dieta apropriada, o valor de proteína 

alimentar deverá ser superior a 45%, e o valor de lípidos não superior a 17%, em 

termos de ração total. Os aminoácidos e os ácidos gordos essenciais fornecidos nas 

rações permitem criar balanços energéticos que irão sustentar o rápido crescimento da 

corvina. Os ácidos gordos são colocados nas rações através de óleos de peixe, que 

contêm ácidos gordos saturados, monoinsaturados e polinsaturados, sendo estes 

últimos aqueles que possuem efeitos benéficos para o ser humano – ómega-3. Os 

ácidos eicosapentaenóico (EPA) e docosahexaenóico (DHA) são os principais ácidos 

gordos fornecidos pelos óleos de peixe, e essenciais a todos os peixes. Hidratos de 

carbono são utilizados na formulação das rações, servindo como uma fonte de uso 



 

III 

 

limitada para produção de energia, bem como para dar forma e estabilidade às rações. 

Minerais e vitaminas também são introduzidos nas rações, para suplementar 

deficiências a esse nível. 

Para averiguar quais os níveis ótimos de proteínas e lípidos a incluir nas rações 

de corvina, e averiguar como esses nutrientes são utilizados, foi realizado um ensaio 

experimental, com duração total de 12 semanas. 

Cinco dietas isoenergéticas (21,92±0,57 MJ/kg) (média±desvpad) foram criadas, 

com variações nos níveis de proteína (44% e 50%) e lípidos (12%, 15% e 18%), sendo 

denominadas de 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 e 50L18. O ensaio decorreu desde 

Setembro/2011 a Dezembro/2011 (63 dias), com um número inicial de 945 peixes 

(63,66±2,78 g), distribuídos aleatoriamente por 15 tanques de fibra de vidro (volume 

total de 1500L), em grupos triplicados. Os peixes foram aclimatados durante uma 

semana, e o ensaio começou posteriormente. Os peixes eram alimentados 

diariamente, às 9h00 e às 16h (dias de semana) e às 9h e às 13h (fins de semana), 

sendo a alimentação feita à mão, ad libitum (até à saciação). 

Foram realizadas quatro amostragens: uma inicial, duas intermédias, e uma final. 

Em todas houve verificação do peso corporal e tamanho, sendo que na final foram 

sacrificados 12 peixes, dos quais 6 foram usados para a análise corporal proximal, e 

outros 6 para análise do conteúdo lipídico das amostras de músculo e fígado (lípidos 

totais e perfil de ácidos gordos). A análise estatística foi realizada com recurso ao 

software STATISTICA 11.0, onde os dados foram sujeitos à análise de variância 

(ANOVA), com p&amp;lt;0,05 e quando normalidade e homocedasticidade eram cumpridas. 

Caso contrário, testes não paramétricos – análise de variância Kruskal-Wallis – eram 

realizados para averiguar diferenças. 

No geral, e tendo em conta os parâmetros de crescimento calculados, a dieta 

50L18 apresentou o melhor desempenho, quando comparada com as outras dietas, 

uma vez que possui os níveis desejados de proteína e de lípidos, com proteína &gt; 45% 

e lípidos ? 17%. Por outro lado, a alimentação 50L12 teve o pior desempenho, 

principalmente por causa dos baixos níveis de lipídios na dieta. As taxas de SGR (taxa 

de crescimento específico) devem ser maiores do que 1% / dia, situação alcançada 

com as dietas 50L15 e 50L18 que possuíam os SGR mais elevados, de 0,99±0,04 e 

1,21±0,00, respetivamente. Dentro do grupo com 50% de proteína, a dieta 50L18 

apresentou a maior Taxa de Crescimento Diário (DGI): 1,78±0,03 %, a maior Eficiência 

da Ração (FE): 0,97±0,04, e o maior Rácio de Eficiência Proteica (PER): 2,33±0,09, 

possuindo o menor valor médio de Rácio de Conversão Alimentar (FCR): 1,04±0,04. O 

valor de DGI obtido é devido aos elevados valores de proteína e lípido presentes na 

ração, que acabaram por se refletir num peso final superior aos outros tratamentos. O 

valor de PER está relacionado com valores elevados de FE, bem como de peso final 

elevado, situação que se confirmou com esta dieta, visto que os peixes que cresceram 

mais foram aqueles que se alimentaram mais. O FCR ao ser mais baixo que nas 

outras dietas indica que, com a mesma quantidade de alimento, a conversão da dieta 

50L18 em elementos bio disponíveis é feita com maior eficácia. A dieta 50L18 também 

foi aquela que apresentou os valores médios mais elevados para a retenção de 

proteína (42,24±2,50 %) e energia (26,98±0,47 %), bem como para os valores médios 

de ganho diário de nitrogénio (N) (334,56±8,26 mg/kg/dia) e energia (0,71±0,04 

kJ/kg/dia). Com estes valores, fica confirmado que dietas com valores aproximados de 



 

IV 

 

50% proteína são essenciais para o crescimento da corvina. A dieta 50L12 apresentou 

o pior valor de ganho diário de energia (0,51±0,16 kJ/kg/dia), o que indica que não 

será apropriada para o cultivo de corvina, inclusive por apresentar uma retenção de 

lípidos (17,65±13,01 %) bastante inferior aos outros tratamentos. 

Relativamente à composição proximal dos peixes alimentados com cada dieta 

experimental, em termos de matéria seca, a dieta 44L18 foi a que apresentou o menor 

valor médio de proteína (64,97±2,32 %) em oposição à dieta 50L12 (69,94±3,11 %), 

sendo o valor de lípidos o que mais influencia o valor de proteína presente. A dieta 

50L12 apresentou o menos valor médio de lípidos (16,78±2,86 %), sendo ainda menos 

do que o inicial (19,63±0,14 %), o que indica a má performance desta dieta. Em 

termos de matéria fresca, as dietas do grupo de 50% proteína possuíram melhor 

performance que a dieta 44L18, sendo que esta, numa base de matéria fresca de 

lípidos e de energia, obteve os valores médios mais elevados (6,53±0,94 % e 

6,44±0,29 % respetivamente), visto possuir uma elevada concentração de lípidos e um 

valor mais reduzido de proteína. 

Em termos de deposição lipídica, o conteúdo lipídico do fígado foi maior no 

tratamento 50L18 do que no 50L12 (63,11±3,98 % vs. 53,01±7,61 %), mas semelhante 

ao tratamento 44L18 (58,26 ± 10,05 %). Os valores de lípidos musculares não são 

significativamente diferentes entre os cinco tratamentos, possuindo um valor médio de 

2,3 %. O perfil de ácidos gordos (AG) dos diferentes tratamentos não exibe diferenças 

significativas, possuindo valores médios de AG saturados ?32%, AG monoinsaturados 

?20%, de AG polinsaturados ?43% e a relação (n-3)/(n-6) ?4,2, sendo valores muito 

bons. Estes resultados, juntamente com os baixos índices aterogénico e 

trombogénico, prova que a corvina é uma excelente fonte de ómega-3, essenciais 

param uma condição cardíaca saudável. 

Não obstante que a proteína é o ingrediente mais caro na formulação de rações, 

uma dieta apropriada para a criação de corvina a um nível comercial deverá possuir 

aproximadamente 50% de conteúdo proteico, e possuir entre 15 a 18% de conteúdo 

lipídico, sendo estes valores uma boa abordagem para uma dieta ideal que poderia 

maximizar o crescimento e baixar custos.

ABSTRACT 

This study investigates the effects of dietary lipid and protein levels in the growth, 

feed utilization and body composition of meagre (Argyrosomus regius). Triplicate 

groups of 945 juvenile fish (63,66±2,78 g average weight±SD) were fed for 63 days five 

isoenergetic diets (21,79±0,17 kJ) containing 44 and 50% of crude protein, and 12, 15 

and 18% of crude lipids, named 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 and 50L18. Mean values 

of fishes fed diet 50L18 were significantly higher than all other treatments, regarding 

final body weight (136,09±1,00 g), specific growth rate (1,21±0,00 %), daily growth 

index (1,78±0,03 %) and protein efficiency ratio (2,33±0,09), with the %crude protein in 

the feed to affect the last to parameters. Voluntary feed index of fish was affected by 

the %crude lipid in the feed, with diet 44L18 to have significantly higher values 

(1,28±0,11 %) than diets 44L15 and 50L12. Fish fed diet 50L18 had significantly higher 

values of food conversion ratio (1,04±0,04) than all diets, except diet 50L12. The 

retention of dry matter and protein had significant differences, with diet 50L18 to have 

the highest values (27,60±0,98 % and 42,24±2,50 %, respectively), and to also 

possess the highest daily gain of nitrogen and energy. No significant differences were 

found in the values of lipid and energy retention, and in the daily gain of lipid. 

Significant differences were found between the mean lipid deposition on liver, but not 

on the muscle samples. The fatty acid profile was not significantly different between 

treatments, and neither were the Atherogenicity and Thrombogenicity indexes. Overall, 

the results indicated that the best growth performance was observed in fishes fed the 

50L18 diet, but with excessive mesenteric fat deposition in the abdominal wall. In 

conclusion, meagre feeds should have around 50% crude protein and between 15 to 

18% crude lipid.

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Aquaculture - present situation and trends: 

 

Aquaculture is one of the most modern types of farming practiced in the World. It 

started around 2000-1000 B.C., with the Chinese being the first ones to put the knowledge 

into practice (Rabanal, 1988). Nowadays, due to the huge increase in human population, 

demand for animal products and its derivates is increasing drastically, where aquaculture 

represents one of the most important forms of supplying the World with food.  In 2002, China 

was the world biggest producer of aquaculture products, in spite of the majority where 

freshwater products (Brugère and Ridler, 2004), followed by India and Indonesia. It’s 

noteworthy that the main producers are found in Asia, and not the developed countries. 

These countries produce low value fish rather than high value finfish (Brugère and Ridler, 

2004), which is accordingly with the low income of the population. In 2008, the aquaculture 

industry accounted for 45,7 % of the world’s fish food production for human consumption 

(FAO, 2012), almost half of the world needs, which demonstrates the great growing potential 

of this industry. 

When we talk about the number of species that are produced by aquaculture, the big 

growth happened within the countries mentioned above, that produced mainly inland water 

species (Table 1):

The small increase of marine and diadromous fishes demonstrates the difficulties of 

growing new species, being necessary to study their complex biology, the feeding habits, 

reproduction cycles and environmental needs, for artificially grow them in aquaculture 

systems.  

In Europe, the main aquaculture producers are Norway, Spain, France, UK and Italy 

(FAO, 2012; Zampogna, 2009). The marine and diadromous fishes grown are very well 

known, with extensive studied biology and optimized feeding protocols, such as Atlantic 

salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla 



 

2 

 

anguilla), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 

(Zampogna, 2009). Due to the relative small diversity of marine fishes grown in Europe, 

there are proposals of trying to introduce new species in the commercial circuit of 

aquaculture (Quéméner, 2002; Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), preferably ones 

that comply with biological (growth, fecundity and growing in captivity), technological 

(appropriate conversion index, life cycle well known) and market (decline in commercial 

catches, market breadth, high commercial value and annual availability) favorable 

characteristics, that, together with a reduced production cost, can compete with the species 

already cultivated (Iglesias and Sánchez, 2008; FAO, 2012). 

 

1.2 The Sciaenidae family: 

 

The Sciaenidae is among the largest families of sonic fishes, including 270 species 

within 70 genera (Chao, 1986). They are sonic fishes, because they emit sounds during the 

spawning season (primarily), composed of bursts of knocking, drumming or crocking sounds 

(Jiménez et al., 2005; Ueng et al., 2007; Cárdenas, 2010). With a wide distribution among 

the temperate and tropical regions of the world (Jiménez et al., 2005), the great 

representation of the sciaenids occurs in the Indo-Pacific region, with around 65 species 

(Leis and Trnski, 1989), in the Caribbean, with 17 genera (Randall, 1983), and the 

temperate waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans – 2 species are present in the Amazon 

basin and 5 within the Mediterranean sea (Fischer, Bauchot and Schneider, 1987). 

According to Cárdenas (2010) and references there in, there are seven species 

being farmed in a commercial and/or experimental level:  

? Japanese meagre (Argyrosomus japonicus) (Temminck and Schlegel, 1843) in 

Australia (Silberschneider and Gray, 2008), South Africa (Bernatzeder and Britz, 

2007; Musson, 2009), and Taiwan (Ueng et al., 2007); 

? Corvina drum (Cilus gilberti) (Abbott, 1899) in Chile (Aburto, 2005; Augsburguer, 

2006; Cárdenas et al., 2009); 

? White croaker (Micropogonias funieri) (Demarest, 1823) in Uruguay (García-Alonso 

and Vizziano, 2004); 

? Brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) (Linnaeus, 1758) in Greece (Chatzifotis et al., 

2006) and Turkey (Claki et al., 2006); 

? Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (Linnaeus, 1766) in China (Xu et al., 2007), 

European Union (Henderson-Arzapalo, 1995; Holt, 2000), Ecuador (Rajoy, 2003), 

Israel, Martinique (Dao, 2003; Gardes et al., 2000; Soletchnik et al., 1989), Mexico 

(García-Ortega and Lazo, 2004; Goffings, 2010) and Taiwan (Liao and Chang, 

2001); 

? Shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa) (Linnaeus, 1758) in Cyprus (Mylonas et al., 2000), 

Spain (Arizcun et al., 2009), Greece (Mylonas et al., 2004), Italy (Barbaro et al., 

2002) and Turkey (Basaran et al., 2009); 

? Meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801) in Spain (Mateos, 2007), Egypt, France, 

Italy, Morocco and Turkey (Jiménez et al., 2005).

1.2.1 Japanese croaker (Argyrosomus japonicus) (Temminck and 

Schlegel, 1843): 

 

A. japonicus is a widely distributed sciaenid fish, being present in the waters of South 

and Central Australia, from Queensland until Western Australia, where it is known as 
mulloway, from Hong Kong northwards along the Chinese coast to southern Korea and 
Japan, and is found in the northern Indian Ocean, from Pakistan to the northwest coast of 
India (Griffiths and Heemstra, 1995; Bernatzeder et al., 2010). It is also present in the 

African southeast coast, from Cape of Good Hope to southern Mozambique, where it is 
known as dusky kob (Griffiths and Heemstra, 1995; Jiménez et al., 2005), living until 30 
years old and 2 meters of total length (Jiménez et al., 2005). In Taiwan, fishermen from the 

Penghu Archipelago culture this species in saltwater net cages, where the maturation occurs 
at the 5-6 years of age and body length of 70-80 cm, with A. japonicus starting to emit 
sounds at the age of 6 months (Ueng et al., 2007). Adults spawn in the near-shore marine 

environment (until depths of approximately 100 m) and early juveniles (&gt;20 mm TL) recruit 
into estuaries and migrate to the upper reaches where salinity ranges between 0 and 5 ppm. 
Early juveniles (&lt;150 mm TL) appear to be restricted to the upper reaches, whereas larger 
juveniles (&gt;150 mm TL) migrate into the middle and lower reaches of estuaries, into the surf 
zone and eventually out to sea (Griffiths, 1996; Bernatzeder et al., 2010). 

The commercial production started in 1992, in the state of New South Wales (Australia) 
and since then a large number of fingerlings were successfully produced using pond 
fertilization techniques (Jiménez et al., 2005). According to the NSW Fisheries (2003), 

between 2001 and 2002, were produced 120.000 fingerlings, with a unit price of 0.56 euro 
(Jiménez et al., 2005). A. japonicus grows at a very good rate in floating cages, around the 

Sydney area, attaining a size of 45 cm (around 1,1kg) after 26 months of feeding, at 
environmental temperature, but the commercial size is between 500 and 700 grams 
(Jiménez et al., 2005). 

 

1.2.2 Brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) (Linnaeus, 1758): 

 

Brown meagre is a demersal species living at depths of 0 to 200 m, with a wide 

distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean (Chao, 1986). It 

exhibits nocturnal behavior and occupies bottom caves and sea beds covered with 

vegetation (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Cakli et al., 2006). Growth is considerably repressed 

during low temperatures in winter but accelerated from spring until autumn when the water 

temperature rises. Females grow faster than males. The sexually mature fish spawn from 

May to July producing pelagic eggs. Feeding is reduced during gonad maturation and brown 

meagre may use as an energy source hepatic lipid reserves accumulated during the sexual 

resting period (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Cakli et al., 2006).  

Turkey is the fourth largest producer of farmed fish in the Mediterranean region, having 

in 2007, a fishery production of 772,471 tons and an aquaculture production of 140,021 tons, 

being the biggest producer of the 4 Candidate Countries to the EU (Zampogna, 2009). 

Aquaculture of new commercial species, like common dentex, sharpsnout seabream, brown 

meagre and red sea bream, began in 2000 with few farms and is still a successful activity 

(Cakli et al., 2006). The culture of brown meagre, which is being done in small-size 

operations, is a new pilot activity. For that reason, no studies about the quality of wild of 

cultured forms of this species exist in Turkey (Cakli et al., 2006). The species Sciaena 



 

4 

 

umbra has great potential for aquaculture in Turkey and Greece, where the Aegean 

aquaculture industry is looking for alternative species to culture in sea cages. According to 

fish sellers, brown meagre obtains high prices because it is one of the preferred fish in 

Turkey (Cakli et al., 2006). Knowledge of the nutritional requirements of brown meagre is 

scarce and the only available information refers to its dietary habits in the wild, but its 

nutritional requirements are similar with the other Sciaenidae species (Chatzifotis et al., 

2006; Cakli et al., 2006). 

 

1.2.3 Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (Linnaeus, 1766): 

 

The distribution of red drum ranges from Cape Cod in the north-western Atlantic Ocean 

to Tuxpan, Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico. Red drum or redfish (as this species is also 

commonly known), usually inhabit coastal and estuarine waters. They have a characteristic 

red-orange color that can vary from grey to red-bronze and one or more black spots near the 

base of the caudal fin. Red drum are eurythermal and euryhaline, carnivorous and of 

considerable commercial value (Lazo et al., 2010). Early juveniles feed primarily on bottom-

dwelling invertebrates and later stages feed on fish, shrimp and crabs (Jiménez et al., 

2005). Juveniles are found in bays and estuaries until sexually mature, except in their more 

northerly range, where they move offshore or south in the winter to warmer waters. Red 

drums are not tolerant to cold temperatures and death results below 10°C (Lazo et al., 

2010). Sexually mature adults of 3–5 years of age (4–5 kg) migrate to offshore waters and 

spawning takes place in shallow coastal waters during the evening from August to 

November. The maximum age documented is 56 years (1250 mm fork length, FL) for males 

and 52 years (1346 mm FL) for females (Lazo et al., 2010). 

Its aquaculture started in the 70’s, when the adults of this species were induced for the 

breeding in captivity, with the manipulation of the photoperiod and temperature, and the 

concomitant development of the larval rearing (Jiménez et al., 2005), being the first of the 

Sciaenidae to be farmed in a commercial way. This species adapts easily to captivity, laying 

eggs in laboratory conditions, without the use of hormones, mainly due to good acceptance 

of artificial feeds and fast grow out, reaching 500 g within 9 months (Jiménez et al., 2005). 

The production is made in several states along the Gulf of Mexico and south-eastern Atlantic 

in the USA, as well as in Taiwan, China, Mexico and several other countries in Latin America 

(Lazo et al., 2010). 

 

1.2.4 Meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801): 

 

Meagre, Argyrosomus regius (Asso, 1801) is a teleost fish species that belongs to the 

Sciaenidae family, being one of its largest members (Chao, 1986). Can grow more than 180 

cm in total length and weight more than 50 kg (Quéméner, 2002; Prista et al., 2009). Has a 

wide distribution, being present in the Mediterranean and Black seas, Atlantic coast of 

Europe and west coast of Africa, living in inshore or coastal waters, close to the bottom or 

near the surface (range depths from 15 to 200 m) (Cabral and Ohmert, 2001; Poli et al., 

2003; El-Shebly et al., 2007). For a few years that it’s being proposed as a candidate for the 



 

5 

 

Mediterranean aquaculture diversification (Quéméner, 2002; El-Shebly et al., 2007; 

Chatzifotis et al., 2011), due to its fast growth, flesh quality and high nutritional value (regius 

for royal quality of flesh) (Poli et al., 2003; Piccolo et al., 2008; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). 

 

 

 

Figure 1.1 – Morphological characteristics of meagre. In Monfort (2010). 

 

In terms of fisheries, the largest ones were recorded in Africa, where Mauritania, 

Morocco and Egypt are responsible for around 80% of the 10 000 t world annual catch 

(Quéméner, 2002; FAO, 2009; Prista et al., 2009). In Europe, annual values of meagre 

landings are bellow 500 t, and in Portugal, has a secondary importance (FAO, 2009; Prista 

et al., 2009), only being very appreciated in the south region Algarve. Nevertheless, meagre 

is a large sized fish, can attain high ex-vessel prices and high seasonal availability (Quéro 

and Vayne, 1987; Prista et al., 2009), making it a species of great interest for the 

aquaculture production (Quéméner, 2002; Jiménez et al., 2005; Prista et al., 2009). Adding 

to those characteristics, it’s a specie that tolerates wide ranges of salinity, temperature and 

can be reared in brackish water ponds (El-Shebly et al., 2007), being ideal for the 

aquaculture industry. 

Nowadays, the life cycle is already closed, with many hatcheries spread throughout 

Europe, and successful grow out in cages or ponds in Mediterranean countries like Greece, 

France, Italy, Spain and Egypt (Poli et al., 2003; El-Shebly et al., 2007; Chatzifotis et al., 

2011).

Figure 1.2 – Production cycle of meagre. In Monfort (2010). 

 

In spite of rearing techniques for the different stages are well established, production 

has not yet reached its full potencial (Martínez-Llorenz et al., 2011), mainly because of the 

feeding protocols, since the techniques used are the same for others species,  with well 

known needs in terms of nutrients. 

Meagre is a carnivorous species and in the wild, it feeds on Mysidacea, Decapoda and 

Teleostei (Quéro and Vayne, 1987; Cabral and Ohmert, 2001; Jiménez et al., 2005; 

Chatzifotis et al., 2011), but under culture conditions, the feeding protocols used nowadays 

are based on the pelleted diets used for sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass 

(Dicentrarchus labrax) (Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011; Martínez-Llorenz et al., 

2011), being inaddequate for this species. Since the necessary dietary requirements for 

lipids and proteins, that allow to attain the high grow rates for meagre, around 1 kg in less 

than 1 year in cages (Quéméner, 2002; Jiménez et al., 2005; Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis 

et al., 2011), are not well know, there is the need of further study to establish the ratio 

protein:lipid, creating new feeds and feeding protocols (Roo et al., 2010), that may be able to 

fulfill the propose of maximizing growth with the optimum feed, putting a less and less 

monetary effort on feeds and making possible to reach the full grow potential of this species. 

In terms of market value, Argyrosomus regius can attain a price from 6 to 10 €/Kg for 

whole fish (Jiménez et al., 2005; Monfort, 2010) and 10-15€/kg for fillets (Monfort, 2010), 

making it a very desirable commercial product (Hernández et al., 2009). The more versatile 

a fish can be, in terms of processing and forms of sale, makes it more profitable and worth 

investing (Figure 1.3). Meagre stands for “low fat fish” (from the French maigre = slim) 

(Monfort, 2010), and the amount of muscular fat is very low, compared with other 



 

7 

 

aquaculture species (Poli et al., 2003), making possible the fillet preservation under 

refrigeration for longer periods of time, meeting the new lifestyles habits among people: less 

time to cook and preference for processed products (Hernández et al., 2009). Many other 

forms are possible, like smoked fish and sushi, since meagre has a firm white flesh, that 

keeps it shape after cooking, and with the appropriate marketing, the future looks promising 

(Monfort, 2010).

consumers’ prices categories. In Monfort (2010).

(Cárdenas, 2010) (Table 1.2), but little information exists about the exact interval of dietary 

requirements for lipids and proteins that can be used for the formulation of specialized diets 

for this species. It is established that the level of protein should be superior to 45% and the 

level of lipids should not exceed 17% (Cárdenas, 2010), with many authors researching 

within or close to this range of values (Poli et al., 2003; Chatzifotis et al., 2011; Grigorakis 

et al., 2011; Martínez-Lorenz et al., 2011). Woolley et al. (2010) refer that the level of 

protein to be included in feeds should be from 42% to 46%.

These macronutrients provide the required energy, the essential amino acids and the 

essential fatty acids for growth (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). Their relative inclusion in diets 

determines fish growth and the economic performance of aqua feeds, as the proper energy 

to protein ratio in the diet contributes to the effective utilization of dietary proteins, through 

the protein sparing effect on fish (Watanabe, 1982; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). The level of 

dietary lipids that fish can use is limited, and beyond the point of optimal lipid intake, growth 

may be retarded, due to reduction in feed consumption, and body fat may increase, affecting 

the carcass quality (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). The lipids are mainly supplied through the 

inclusion of fish oils that contain the necessary amount of fatty acids. 

 

1.3.1 Macronutrients 

1.3.1.1 Proteins: 

 

Proteins are the most abundant compounds in living organisms and have fundamental 

roles in all biological processes. They are organic molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, 

oxygen, nitrogen and frequently sulfur. The basic composition of most proteins is very 

similar, with varying percentages of its components: 50-55% carbon, 20-23% oxygen, 15-

18% nitrogen, 6-8% hydrogen, and from 0 to 4% sulfur (Jobling, 1995), being composed of 

up to 20 ?-amino acids linked into chains by peptide bonds. The chains are cross-linked by 

disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds, and Van der Waals forces (NRC, 1993). The amino acid 

content of proteins, particularly feed proteins, may differ markedly, so the protein nutritional 

quality derives from the content, proportion and availability of amino acids (Becker, 2007). 

In the context of animal feeding, protein generally refers to crude protein (CP); that is, 

N × 6.25, a definition based on the assumption that proteins contain 16% N. The requirement 

for dietary protein has two components: 

1. a need for indispensable amino acids that the fish cannot synthesize either at all 

or at a rate commensurate with its need for protein deposition or commensurate 

with the synthesis of a variety of other compounds with metabolic functions and 

2. a supply of either dispensable amino acids or sufficient amino nitrogen to enable 

the fish to synthesize them. 

Insofar as synthesis of dispensable amino acids requires expenditure of energy, 

feeding dietary proteins that most nearly meet the needs of fish for both indispensable and 

dispensable amino acids, will result in the most efficient growth by the fish (Thoman et al., 

1999; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). Dietary protein constitutes one of the primary nutrient costs 

of the feed and is the initial source of nitrogen waste products entering a culture system. 

Consequently, optimization of dietary protein levels along with increasing nutrient retention 

by the fish could reduce nitrogen loading and positively influence production costs (Mohanta 

et al., 2007), both from an economical and an environmental perspective. To minimize feed 

costs, it is important to optimize both dietary protein level and utilization by the fish (Thoman 

et al., 1999), and include carbohydrates and lipids. 

The amount of protein to be included in a fish diet is influenced by protein to energy 

ratio (P:E), protein digestibility and amount of non-protein energy in the diet (NRC, 1993; 

Mohanta et al., 2007). When insufficient non-protein energy is available in the feed, dietary 



 

9 

 

protein is delaminated in the body to supply energy rather than being used for tissue growth 

and protein synthesis. The liver plays a major role in directing the various nutrients to specific 

organs and tissues to be metabolized for energy (Li et al., 2012). The same basic metabolic 

pathways for converting amino acids, carbohydrates and lipid into energy have been 

observed in fish as in terrestrial animals (NRC, 1993). It is preferable for dietary 

carbohydrates or lipid to be metabolized for energy so that protein (amino acids) can be used 

for tissue synthesis. To ensure this, there must be a proper balance of dietary protein to 

energy to optimize fish growth and lean tissue accretion. Energy-to-protein ratios ranging 

from 8 to 10 kcal of digestible energy/g (DE/g) of protein (33 to 42 kJ/g) are optimal for 

various fish species (Gatlin III, 2010).  

Considering this, much research has been conducted to investigate the protein-sparing 

potential of lipids and carbohydrates in fish diets. In their natural environment, fish have 

limited access to carbohydrates and are better adapted both at digestive and metabolic 

levels to utilize protein and lipids than carbohydrates as energy sources (Li et al., 2012). So, 

a supplementation of lipids rather than carbohydrates as a non-protein energy source is 

generally a more effective method to increase dietary energy level because lipids are energy-

dense nutrients and are readily metabolized by fish (NRC, 1993). In meagre, the protein-

sparing effect can be investigated through the optimization of the dietary ratio protein:lipid.  

 

1.3.1.2 Lipids: 

 

Lipids constitute a heterogenic family of compounds with diverse structures. Their 

common and defining feature is their insolubility in water and solubility in organic solvents 

(ether, acetone, mixture of chloroform-alcohol). The terms "fats" and "oils" are used to define 

mixtures of lipids, respectively solids or liquids at room temperature (Nelson and Cox, 

2004). 

The lipids present in teleost fish species may be divided into two major groups: the 

phospholipids and the triglycerides (Gunstone et al., 2007). The phospholipids make up the 

integral structure of the unit membranes in the cells; thus, they are often called structural 

lipids. The triglycerides are lipids used for storage of energy in fat depots, usually within 

special fat cells surrounded by a phospholipid membrane and a rather weak collagen 

network, being formed by the combining of glycerol with three molecules of fatty acids. The 

triglycerides are often termed depot fat. A few fish have wax esters as part of their depot fats 

(Huss, 1995). 

The phospholipids are all contained in membrane structures, including the outer cell 

membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and other intracellular tubule systems, as well as 

membranes of the organelles like mitochondria. In addition to phospholipids, the membranes 

also contain cholesterol, contributing to the membrane rigidity. In lean fish muscle cholesterol 

may be found in a quantity of about 6 % of the total lipids (Huss, 1995; Chatzifotis et al., 

2010). The fat cells making up the lipid depots in fatty species are typically located in the 

subcutaneous tissue, in the belly flap muscle and in the muscles moving the fins and tail 

(Huss, 1995). 

Fat depots are also typically found spread throughout the muscle structure. The 

concentration of fat cells appears to be highest close to the myocommata and in the region 



 

10 

 

between the light and dark muscle (Huss, 1995). The dark muscle contains some 

triglycerides inside the muscle cells even in lean fish, as this muscle is able to metabolize 

lipids directly as energy. The corresponding light muscle cells are dependent on glycogen as 

a source of energy for the anaerobic metabolism (Huss, 1995; Chatzifotis et al., 2010). To 

best fulfill the needs in lipids for optimal development and growth, oils derived from fish are 

used. 

 

1.3.1.2.1 Fish oils: 

Fish oils contain a wide range of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated 

acids (Table 1.3), but fish fatty acid (FA) composition is generally cited in terms of the major 

acids only. Such oils are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (mainly myristic and palmitic), 

monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) covering the range of hexadecenoic through 

docosenoic, and omega-3 (n-3) C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Gunstone 

et al., 2007). These last are very important acids for which fish oils are the largest source, 

supplying eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. The fish oils vary in 

the level of combined PUFA’s and also in the distribution between EPA and DHA. This is 

important when selecting a fish oil as a source of one or other of these PUFA for 

enhancement and when seeking a dietary source rich in one of these acids, but not in the 

other. 

 

Table 1.3 – Fatty acids identified in fish oils. Adapted from Gunstone et al. (2007).

Polyunsaturated 16:2-4, 18:2-4, 20:2-5, 21:5, and 22:3-6 

Note: Many of the unsaturated acids occur in several forms. 

 

Fish oils contain materials with valuable dietary and pharmaceutical properties as well 

as having physical properties that make them useful as moisturizers. Until the 1960s, fish 

liver oils were used in Europe and the U.S. mainly for their vitamins A and D, but high-quality 

fish oil is now used as a source of long-chain (n-3) fatty acids (Simopoulos, 2002; 

Gunstone et al., 2007; Chatzifotis et al., 2010). 

 

1.3.1.2.2 Fatty acids: 

Fatty acids are simple organic compounds constituted by carbon, hydrogen and 

oxygen with long hydrocarbon chains of various lengths (4 to 36 carbons long) (Christie, 

1989; Gunstone et al., 2007). Each molecule of fatty acid has in the end of its chain a 

carboxylic group and in the opposite a non-functional methyl group. Fatty acids are divided 



 

11 

 

into groups according to chain length, number, position and configuration of their double 

bonds, and the occurrence of additional functional groups along the chains (Christie, 1989). 

Fatty acids systematic name is derived from the name of its parent hydrocarbon substituting 

the end e with oic. For example, the C18 saturated fatty acid is called octadecanoic acid since 

the parent hydrocarbon is octadecane. A C18 fatty acid with one double bond is called 

octadecenoic acid; with two double bounds ("di"), octadecadienoic acid; with three double 

bonds ("tri"), octadecatrieenoic acid (Simopoulos, 2002) (Table 1.4). 

 

Table 1.4 - Structure, systematic, trivial, and shorthand names of some common fatty acids, 

with (n-3) FA marked in red and (n-6) FA marked in blue. Adapted from Gunstone et al. 

(2007). 

 

 

 

The n- or “omega” nomenclature is used to describe fatty acids by the general formula 

X:Yn-z, where X is the carbon chain length, Y is the number of ethylenic/double bonds, and 

n-z (or ?z) denotes the position of the first double bond relative to the methyl end of the fatty 

acid. Thus, 16:0 denotes a saturated fatty acid containing 16 carbons and no double bonds 

(all carbons saturated with hydrogen), and 18:1n-9 (18:1?9) designates a monounsaturated 

fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and a single double bond that is nine carbon atoms from the 

methyl end. Many freshwater fish can elongate and desaturate 18-carbon linolenic acid with 

three double bonds to longer chains (20 and 22 carbons) of more highly unsaturated fatty 

acids (HUFAs) with five or six double bonds. In contrast, most marine fish must have HUFA 

in the diet (Gatlin III, 2010). In the body, HUFAs are components of cell membranes (in the 

form of phosphoglycerides, or phospholipids), especially in neural tissues of the brain and 

eye. They also serve as precursors of steroid hormones and the highly active eicosanoids 

produced from 20-carbon HUFAs. Carbon atoms 2 and 3 are often referred to as ? and ?, 

respectively, and the methyl carbon atom at the distal end of the chain is called the ?-

carbon. (Christie, 1989; Gunstone et al., 2007) Fatty acids are named as saturated fatty 

acids (SFA) when they do not contain double bonds and monounsaturated fatty acids 

(MUFA) when they contain one double bond. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) possess 



 

12 

 

more than one double bond. Many may be present at levels exceeding 10%: SFAs (14:0, 

16:0), MUFAs (16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1) and (n-3) PUFAs (20:5, 22:6). Many minor fatty acids 

are also present (Gunstone et al., 2007). 

 

1.3.1.2.3 Saturated fatty acids: 

SFAs form a homologous series of monocarboxylic acids (CnH2n+1COOH). Naturally 

occurring saturated acids are mainly of even chain length between C4 and C24. Odd chain 

acids are usually minor or trace components of plant and animal lipids (Christie, 1989). 

Palmitic acid (16:0) is the most abundant and widespread natural SFA, present in plants, 

animals, and microorganisms. Levels of 20 to 30% are common in animal lipids, 10 to 40% in 

seed oils (Das, 2006). Stearic acid (18:0) is also ubiquitous, usually at low levels, but is 

abundant in cocoa butter (around 34%) and some animal fats, e.g., lard (5 to 24%) and beef 

tallow (6 to 40%) (Gunstone et al., 2007). 

 

1.3.1.2.4 Monoenoic fatty acids: 

Straight-chain, cis-monoenoic acids with an even number of carbons are common 

constituents of many lipids and commodity oils. Trans- monoenes are rare components of 

natural oils and fats. The cis (Z) double bond is usually inserted by a ?9-desaturase enzyme 

into preformed saturated acids; this may be followed by two-carbon chain extension at the 

carboxyl end. Starting with 16:0, this results in (n-7) monoenes, while desaturation of 18:0 

leads to the (n-9) family (Christie, 1989; Gunstone et al., 2007). The most common 

monoene is oleic acid (18:1 9c) (Figure 1.4).  

 

 

Figure 1.4 – Oleic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). 

 

Oleic acid is found in most plant and animal lipids and is the major fatty acid in olive 

oil (70 to 75%) and several nut oils, e.g., macadamia, pistachio, pecan, almond, and hazelnut 

(filbert) contain 50 to over 70%. Palmitoleic acid (16:1 9c, (n-7)) is a ubiquitous minor 

component in animal lipids, somewhat more abundant in fish oils. C20 monoenes (9c and 11c) 

isomers are found in fish oils (Das, 2006). 

 

1.3.1.2.5 Methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated acids: 

Marine fish contain large amounts of 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids of 

their cellular membranes. Marine fish can neither biosynthesize 22:6(n-3) de novo nor from 

shorter chain precursors such as 18:3(n-3). Therefore, 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) are essential 

dietary constituents for marine fish (Sargent et al., 1999). Most unsaturated fatty acids with 

two or more double bonds show a characteristic methylene interrupted pattern of 

unsaturation, with one CH2 between cis double bonds. This pattern results from the operation 

of a few specific desaturases and chain-elongation enzymes. Plants generally insert double 



 

13 

 

bonds at the ?9, ?12, and ?15 positions in C18 fatty acids, giving (n-9), (n-6), and (n-3) 

compounds, respectively (Das, 2006). Animals can also insert double bonds at the ?9 

position, but not at ?12 or ?15; instead, further double bonds are introduced between the 

carboxyl group and the ?9 position by ?5 and ?6 desaturase enzymes and the chain can 

then be extended in two carbon units at the carboxyl end of the molecule (Gunstone et al., 

2007). The resulting (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes are shown in Figure 1.5:  

 

 

Figure 1.5 - Biosynthesis of (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes (D = desaturase, E = elongase, -2C = 

two-carbon chain shortening). In Gunstone et al. (2007). 

 

The step leading to DHA is usually the net result of two elongations, a ?6 desaturase 

and subsequent two-carbon chain shortening. Along with a few saturates (mainly 16:0 and 

18:0, but also 10:0 to 14:0) and oleic acid, the (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes make up the fatty 

acids found in most plants, animals, and commodity oils and fats (Das, 2006). 

Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)) (Figure 1.6) is present in most plant oils and is abundant 

(&gt;50%) in corn, sunflower, and soybean oils, and exceeds 70% in safflower oil (Gunstone et 

al., 2007). 

 

 

 

Figure 1.6 – Linoleic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). 



 

14 

 

Arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4(n-6)) (Figure 1.7) is present in animal tissues, but do 

not usually accumulate at significant levels in storage fats, being the precursor of the PG2 

prostaglandin family (Gunstone et al., 2007). 

 

 

Figure 1.7 – Arachidonic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). 

 

Alfa (?) - linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3(n-3)) is ubiquitous in plant leaf lipids and is present 

in several commodity seed oils: 8 to 10% in soybean and canola, &gt;50% in linseed oil, and 65 

to 75% of perilla oil (Gunstone et al., 2007).  

 

 

 

Figure 1.8 – ?-linolenic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). 

 

The (n-3) long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid 

(EPA, 20:5 – CH3CH2CH=CH(CH2CH=CH)4CH2CH2CH2COOH) (Figure 1.9), and 

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 – CH3CH2CH=CH(CH2CH=CH)5CH2CH2COOH) (Figure 

1.10), are important nutritionally and are mainly obtained from oily fish and fish oils where 

they are present at levels from 5 to 20% (Das, 2006). EPA is the precursor of the PG3 

prostaglandin series (Gunstone et al., 2007).

Sometimes the total level of (n-3) EPA and DHA is important and on other occasions it 

is desirable to have high concentrations of only one of them. Sometimes it is desirable to 

have these acids at higher concentrations than is provided naturally or to enrich one of them 

at the expense of the other. Alternatively, it may be desired to incorporate one or both of 

them into an oil rich in medium-chain acids (Das, 2006; Gunstone et al., 2007). The 

American Heart Association recommends combined intakes of EPA and DHA of 1 g/day for 

patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) and 0.5 g/day for individuals without 

known CHD (Simopoulos, 2002; Das, 2006; Gunstone et al., 2007). The characteristic fatty 

acids of the fat of fish possess antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory characteristics, justifying 

a lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in fish-eating populations (Simopoulos, 2002; 

Das, 2006). In human nutrition, FA such as LA and ALA are regarded as essential since they 

cannot be synthesized by the organism. In marine fish, these fatty acids constitute only 

around 2 % of the total lipids, which is a small percentage compared with many vegetable 

oils (Simopoulos, 2002). However, fish oils contain other PUFAs which are "essential" to 

prevent skin diseases in the same way as LA and ARA (Das, 2006). As members of the 

linolenic acid family (first double bond in the third position, (n-3) counted from the terminal 

methyl group), they will also have neurological benefits in growing children (Huss, 1995; 

Das, 2006; Simopoulos, 2002). Poli et al. (2003) determined that the flesh of meagre has a 

fatty acid profile similar to other Mediterranean marine fish (Cárdenas, 2010) (Table 1.5). 

Because of these fatty acids contents, meagre possesses anti-atherogenic and 

antithrombotic properties, measured by indexes. These indexes reflect quantitatively the 

potential of fats to increase aggression in the vascular endothelium, to produce thrombosis or 

embolism in subjects sensitive to these conditions. These indexes in meagre are much lower 

than those posed by ground meat (lamb, beef, pork) (Poli et al., 2003; Piccolo et al., 2008).

The main difference between mammalian lipids and fish lipids is that fish lipids include 

up to 40% of long-chain fatty acids (14-22 carbon atoms) which are highly unsaturated. 

Mammalian fat will rarely contain more than two double bonds per fatty acid molecule while 

the depot fats of fish contain several fatty acids with five or six double bonds (Huss, 1995; 

Simopoulos, 2002). The percentage of PUFA with four, five or six double bonds is slightly 

lower in the PUFA of lipids from freshwater fish (approximately 70%) than in the 

corresponding lipids from marine fish (approximately 88%) (Huss, 1995). However, the 

composition of the lipids is not completely fixed but can vary with the feed intake and season.

Maintaining high levels of (n-3) PUFA, as well as low levels of (n-6) fatty acids, in farmed 

fish, is considered desirable to provide a high nutritional value product for human 

consumption (Das, 2006; Martins et al., 2007). 

 

1.3.1.3 Carbohydrates: 

 

Carnivorous species, such as meagre, are very efficient using dietary protein and lipid 

for energy but less efficient at using dietary carbohydrates (Li et al., 2012). The feeds that 

carnivorous species eat contain little carbohydrate, so they use this nutrient less efficiently. 

Fish do not have a specific dietary requirement for carbohydrates, but including these 

compounds in diets is an inexpensive source of energy (Gatlin III, 2010).  Carbohydrates 

may serve as precursors for the dispensable amino acids and nucleic acids, which are 

metabolic intermediates necessary for growth (NRC, 1993). The ability of fish to utilize 

dietary carbohydrates for energy varies considerably; many carnivorous species use them 

less efficiently than do herbivorous and omnivorous species. Some carbohydrates are 

deposited in the form of glycogen in tissues such as liver and muscle, where it is a ready 

source of energy. Some dietary carbohydrates are converted to lipid and deposited in the 

body for energy (NRC, 1993; Gatlin III, 2010). Since fish can’t digest complex carbohydrates 

(cellulose and other fibrous carbohydrates), the amount of crude fiber in fish feeds is usually 

less than 7% of the diet, to limit the amount of undigested material entering the culture 

system. Cereal grains serve as inexpensive sources of carbohydrates for warm-water fish, 

but their use in cold-water fish feeds is limited (NRC, 1993). 

Soluble carbohydrates such as starch are primary energy reserves found in seeds, 

tubers and other plant structures. Animal tissues such as liver and muscle contain small 

concentrations of soluble carbohydrate in the form of glycogen, which is structurally similar to 

starch (Gatlin III, 2010). This glycogen reserve can be rapidly mobilized when the body 

needs glucose. Prepared feeds for carnivorous fish usually contain less than 20% soluble 

carbohydrate, while feeds for omnivorous species usually contain 25 to 45%. In addition to 

being a source of energy, starch in fish feeds also gives pellets integrity and stability and 

makes them less dense (NRC, 1993). Because carbohydrates are the least expensive 

source of dietary energy, the maximum tolerable concentration should be used with regard to 

the fish species.  

 

1.3.2 Micronutrients: 

1.3.2.1 Vitamins: 

 

Fifteen vitamins are essential for terrestrial animals and for several fish species that 

have been examined to date (Table 1.6).  

 

 

 



 

17 

 

Table 1.6 – Vitamins and some of their major functions as established in fish. In Gatlin III 

(2010). 

 

 

 

Vitamins are organic compounds required in relatively small concentrations to support 

specific structural or metabolic functions. Vitamins are divided into two groups based on 

solubility (NRC, 1993). Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamin A (retinol), vitamin D 

(cholecalciferol), vitamin E (?-tocopherol) and vitamin K. These fat-soluble vitamins are 

metabolized and deposited in association with body lipids, so fish can go for long periods 

without having these vitamins in the diet before they show signs of deficiency (Gatlin III, 

2010). Water-soluble vitamins include ascorbic acid (vitamin C), biotin, choline, folic acid, 

inositol, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, thiamin and vitamin B12. They are not 

stored in appreciable amounts in the body, so signs of deficiency usually appear within 

weeks in young, rapidly growing fish (Gatlin III, 2010). Most of these water-soluble vitamins 

are components of coenzymes that have specific metabolic functions. Vitamin premixes are 

now available to add to prepared diets so that fish receive adequate levels of each vitamin 

independent of levels in dietary ingredients. This gives producers a margin of safety for 

losses associated with processing and storage. The stability of vitamins during feed 

manufacture and storage has been improved over the years with protective coatings and/or 

chemical modifications. Therefore, vitamin deficiencies are rarely observed in commercial 

production (Gatlin III, 2010).

1.3.2.2 Minerals: 

 

Minerals consist of inorganic elements the body requires for various purposes. Fish 

require the same minerals as terrestrial animals for tissue formation, osmoregulation and 

other metabolic functions. However, dissolved minerals in the water may satisfy some of the 

metabolic requirements of fish (Gatlin III, 2010). Minerals are typically classified as either 

macro- or microminerals, based on the quantities required in the diet and stored in the body. 

Macrominerals are calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, chloride, sodium, potassium and 

sulfur. Dietary deficiencies of most macrominerals have been difficult to produce in fish 

because of the uptake of waterborne ions by the gills (Gatlin III, 2010). However, it is known 

that phosphorus is the most critical macromineral in fish diets because there is little 

phosphorus in water. Because excreted phosphorus influences the eutrophication of water, 

much research has been focused on phosphorus nutrition with the aim of minimizing 

phosphorus excretion (NRC, 1993; Li et al., 2012) Phosphorus is a major constituent of hard 

tissues such as bone and scales and is also present in various biochemicals. Impaired 

growth and feed efficiency, as well as reduced tissue mineralization and impaired skeletal 

formation in juvenile fish, are common symptoms when fish have diets deficient in 

phosphorus (Gatlin III, 2010). Chloride, sodium and potassium are important electrolytes 

involved in osmoregulation and the acid–base balance in the body. These minerals are usu-

ally abundant in water and practical feedstuffs. Magnesium is involved in intra- and 

extracellular homeostasis and in cellular respiration (Gatlin III, 2010). It also is abundant in 

most feedstuffs. The microminerals (also known as trace minerals) include cobalt, chromium, 

copper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc (Table 1.7).  

 

Table 1.7 – Trace minerals and some of their functions. In Gatlin III (2010). 

 

 

 

Impaired growth and poor feed efficiency are not readily induced with micro mineral 

deficiencies, but may occur after an extended period of feeding deficient diets (Gatlin III, 

2010). Copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc are the most important to supplement in 

diets because practical feedstuffs contain low levels of these microminerals and because 



 

19 

 

interactions with other dietary components may reduce their bioavailability (Gatlin III, 2010). 

Although it is not usually necessary to supplement practical diets with other microminerals, 

an inexpensive trace mineral premix can be added to nutritionally complete diets to ensure 

an adequate trace mineral content. 

 

1.4 OBJECTIVES: 

 

Nowadays, there are no specific feeds for meagre. A 12 weeks feeding trial was 

undertaken to assess the effect of controlled dietary changes in terms of protein:lipid ratios 

on the growth performance, nutrient utilization and whole-body composition of juvenile 

meagre. Moreover, the effect of the various dietary treatments on fat deposition (liver and 

muscle) and the fillet fatty acid profile was also characterized.    

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1 Experimental diets: 

 

Five isoenergetic (21.92±0.57 MJ/kg mean gross energy) extruded diets were 

formulated by SPAROS, Lda. (Loulé, Portugal), a commercial feed company, to provide two 

dietary protein levels of 44% and 50%, and three dietary lipid levels of 12%, 15% and 18%. 

According to those levels, the feeds were named 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 and 50L18, 

with first number being %crude protein and second number %crude fat. Ingredients and 

proximate composition (Table 2.1) of the experimental diets were assessed by SPAROS,

The major protein sources were from marine-derived ingredients (Fishmeal LT 

(Peruvian) and Fishmeal 60/9), while fish oil was the main fat source. All feeds, and 

according to the value of crude protein and/or crude fat, had approximated values for 

essential amino acids and fatty acids (Table 2.2), to avoid any undesired unbalance. All 

ingredients were finely ground, mixed and extruded (3 mm pellets) by means of pilot-scale 

twin-screw extruder (CLEXTRAL BC45, France) with a screw diameter of 55.5 mm and 

temperature ranging 108-114ºC. Upon extrusion, all batches of extruded feeds were dried in 

a convection oven (LTE OP 750-UF, England) for 4 hours at 50ºC. Following drying, pellets 

were allowed to cool at room temperature. Subsequently, the fish oil was applied by coating 

in a vacuum mixer (DINNISEN, PG-10VCLAB, The Netherlands). During the trial, all 

experimental diets were stored at room temperature, but in a cool and aerated emplacement.

2.2 Experimental fish and feeding trial: 

 

Manipulations of fish were carried out in compliance with the Guidelines of the 

European Union Council (EU/63/2010) and Portuguese legislation for the use of laboratory 

animals. All animal protocols were performed under license of Group-1 from the Direção-

Geral de Veterinária, Ministério da Agricultura, do Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas 

(Portugal). 

The trial was conducted at the Aquaculture Research Station of IPMA in Olhão 

(Portugal), from September 2011 to December 2011 (63 days), with meagre juveniles bred in 

captivity at the station. 945 fish (63.66±2.78 g) were randomly distributed into fifteen 1500 L 

fiberglass tanks (64 fish per tank and each treatment in triplicate) and allowed 1 week for 

acclimation to experimental conditions before the beginning of the trial. The water was 

supplied in a flow-through system, with continuous aeration, and physicochemical 

parameters were measured and registered daily, until the end of the trial (36 g L-1 salinity, 

oxygen saturation &gt; 80% and average temperature of 19.8±0.29 °C). Each tank had a stock 

density of 2.67 Kg/m
3
 and received 24 hours of light (dim and natural). The light intensity was 

measured using the light meter TES 1335, at 11h15, on the first day of the trial, and all tanks 

had similar values of light intensity. Triplicate groups of fish were hand fed until apparent 

satiety (ad libitum), twice daily (09h00 and 16h00 weekdays, 9h00 and 13h00 weekends), 

and the feed consumption was recorded daily.  

 

2.3 Sampling methods: 

 

A total of four samplings were made: one in the beginning of the trial, two intermediate, 

and one final. 

In the initial one, all fish were individually weighed and measured, and then returned to 

the tank of origin. At the beginning of the trial, 15 fish (one from each tank) were sacrificed, 

individually weighed and stored at ? 80 °C for subsequent whole body composition 

determination (moisture, protein, lipid, energy and ash). For quantification of food intake, and 

during the week before the intermediate and final samplings, all the feeds that fish wouldn’t 

eat were collected and weighed, so waste could be quantified. The excess food was 

collected from the bottom of the tank through suction and two hours after the last feeding. 

The collected feeds would be hydrated, so a correcting factor was applied (Table 2.3). To 

obtain the correcting factor, 5 replicates of 20 g of each feed were immersed in 1 L of water 

(temperature equal to trial tanks) for 2 hours. Applying the correcting factor to the daily 

registered values of feed consumption, subtracted by the non ingested feed, would give the 

daily feed consumption per tank.

22 

 

After the week where collection of hydrated feeds took place and prior to the 

intermediate samples, fish were fasted for 24 h, and then, in groups of 10 from each tank, 

they were counted and weighed individually, and then returned to the tank of origin. 

At the end of the trial and after the fast of 24 h, twelve fish from each tank were 

randomly chosen and anesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol (0,15 ml.L
-1

). All 12 fish were 

sacrificed, measured and weighed individually (bench scale Kern &amp;amp; Sohn Gmbh, model ITB 

35K1IP, readout 1 g). From those 12 fish, six were stored at -20 °C for whole body 

composition; from the other six fish, liver and viscera weights were recorded for 

hepatosomatic and visceral index determination, and frozen at -80 °C, such as muscle fillet 

samples (area from head to pelvic fin). To avoid the oxidation of the lipid content in the 

samples of liver, viscera and muscle, and since they will be used for determination of the lipid 

content and fatty acid composition profile, all were lyophilized during 48h (Heto PowerDry 

LL3000). 

 

2.4 Analytical methods 

2.4.1 Proximate analysis of diets and fish tissues 

 

For determination of the proximate chemical composition of the experimental diets and 

freeze-dried whole body of fish the following procedures were used: dry matter by drying at 

105 °C, for 24 h in a P-Selecta 207 oven; ash by combustion at 550 °C for 12 h in a muffle 

furnace; crude protein (N×6.25) by the Kjeldahl method after acid digestion; crude fat after 

petroleum ether extraction by the Soxhlet method and a SOXTEC System HT6 extractor; 

gross energy in an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Werke C2000, IKA, Staufen, Germany). 

Amino acids profiles of diets were obtained after hydrolysis in 6 M HCL at 108 °C over 24 h 

in nitrogen-flushed glass vials. A Waters Pico-Tag reversed phase HPLC system, using 

norleucine as an internal standard, was used. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed 

with Breeze software (Waters, USA). Tryptophan was not analyzed since it is destroyed by 

acid hydrolysis, while glutamine and asparagine are converted to glutamate and aspartate, 

respectively, during acid hydrolysis. 

 

2.4.2 Growth performance 

 

Biological evaluation of feed ingredients and finished feeds involves feeding fish and 

analyzing some aspect of fish performance and/or diet digestibility. Therefore, several 

indices should be calculated, to assess the performance of feeds, their retention in the 

carcass, and the values of nutrients that fish gain through the trial. At the end of the trial, to 

assess the performance of feeds, indices were calculated – Specific Growth Rate (SGR), 

Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR), Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER), and Voluntary Feed Index 

(VFI) – retention, in which the deposition of a nutrient in the carcass over a short time is 

measured, and gain, was calculated for protein, fat and energy.  

Accurate prediction of the growth potential of a fish stock, under given husbandry 

conditions, is an inevitable prerequisite to estimate the energy or feed requirement (e.g., 



 

23 

 

weekly ration). The formula most commonly used for fish growth rate expression is the 

instantaneous growth rate, known as the Specific Growth Rate, which is based on the 

natural logarithm of body weight, and can be used to compare growth on a daily basis: 

 

      
                   

    
       

In this formula, FBW is the final mean body weight (g); IBW, the initial mean body 

weight (g); and D, the number of days. The SGR has been widely used by most biologists to 

describe the growth rate of fish, being dependent on the IBW, with comparisons of growth 

rates among groups made with similar IBW. 

One of the most important ratios is the Feeding Conversion Ratio, being the quantity 

of feed fed divided by fish weight gain over a specific time period, with values typically 

ranging from 1.5 to 0.8 in intensive fish culture (0.8 is a better ratio). The true FCR includes 

wasted feed and mortalities. The ratio, usually expressed as a true ratio (i.e. 1:1.5) is often 

quoted as a "rate" (1.5). FCRs of less than 1:1 are possible with commercial diets, as the 

pellet being fed is a "dry" diet, and a high percentage of weight gained by the fish, is water 

trapped in the tissues and cells. Feed conversion ratios with commercial "dry" diets are 

typically in the region of 1:0.8 to 1:1.5. Ratios with wet diets are higher than this, and can be 

as high as 1:10. FCR varies according to several factors, including the nutritional and 

physical quality of the aquafeed; environmental variants, such as temperature; the intensity 

of production (and therefore the availability or not of ‘natural’ feed); and other factors, 

including genetics (New and Wijkström, 2002). The basic principle is to feed the fish right 

up to the point of fullness. If they are totally satisfied, fish will not be in stress and will provide 

quality food for human consumption. This requires that the aquiculture technician has the 

ability to accurately judge the amount of food to be provided in each situation. With the 

technological development of aquaculture, many devices have been developed to assist in 

determining the amount of food to provide for obtaining optimal feeding regimens. The 

formula for FCR is defined as: 

 

      
                 

                      
 

A useful method to compare protein sources in a single experiment is the Protein 

Efficiency Ratio, a measure of the weight gain per unit protein fed. There is a standard PER 

method (AOAC, 1998) involving rats. In this method, proteins are compared at a suboptimal 

dietary level. This ratio can tell the balance efficiency between protein and energy (protein 

sparing effect), and can measure the deposition of lipids by the same sparing effect. The 

PER is calculated as follows: 

 

      
                 

                                        
 

In this ratio, the crude protein intake in related to the percentage of protein present in 

the feed, to accurately calculate the efficiency of retention of the protein present in the feed. 



 

24 

 

Finally, a measure of feed intake, by weight, and by day, is calculated through 

Voluntary Feed Intake, standing as a percentage, is calculated by: 

 

      
                 

            
      

This formula gives a notion of the percentage of feed that fish consume to increase 

their weight, on a daily basis. Temperature, diseases, light, and many others factors, that 

unbalance the respective comfort-zone, will have an increase or reduction on feed intake, 

varying VFI. If fish get satiated with feeds that have a good efficiency (and they are fully on 

their comfort-zone), their VFI would be lower, since they need to intake less feed to grow and 

maintain their balance.  

The retention of specific nutrients or energy in the whole body of fish over a specific 

time period is a useful way of evaluating the availability and balance of amino acids and the 

availability of some essential elements and other nutrients as well. Based on data from feed 

intake and whole-body composition of fish, nutrient and energy retention (expressed as 

percentage of intake) as well as daily nutrient gain were calculated as follow:  

 

                  
                                                                   

               
 

The livers were removed and weighed and expressed as percentage of body weight 

and used to calculate hepatosomatic (HSI) index: 

 

           
            

           
       

The HSI provides an indication on status of energy reserve in an animal. In a poor 

environment, fish usually have a smaller liver (with less energy reserved in the liver).  

 

2.4.3 Total lipids 

 

Lipid content of liver and muscle tissue was determined using two different protocols, 

to assess differences: a modified Folch et al. (1957) method and petroleum ether extraction 

by the Soxhlet method using a SOXTEC System HT6 extractor (AOAC, 1998). The lipid 

percentage was then calculated by gravimetric analysis. It includes the weight of all lipid 

components, including glycerol, soluble in the solvent system.  

 

2.4.3.1 Fatty acid profile 

 

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared according to Lepage and Roy 

(1986). The FAMEs preparation was carried out using 0.1 g of freeze dried material and 5 ml 

of acetyl chloride:methanol mixture (1:19, v/v). The esterification was carried out at 80°C 



 

25 

 

over an one hour period. The organic phase was collected, filtered and dried over anhydrous 

sodium sulfate. Solvent was removed under nitrogen and the FAMEs dissolved in 0.1 ml of 

n-heptane.  

The analysis was performed in a gas chromatograph Varian CP-3800 (Walnut Creek, 

CA, USA) equipped with an auto-sampler and fitted with a flame ionization detector at 250°C. 

Separation was done in a polyethylene glycol capillary column DB-WAX with 30 m in length, 

0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 ?m film thicknesses from J&amp;amp;B Scientific (USA). The column was 

subjected to a temperature program starting at 180°C for 5 minutes, heating at 4°/minutes for 

10 minutes, and held up at 220°C for 25 minutes. The temperature of the injector (split ratio 

100:1) was kept constant at 250°C during the 40 minutes analysis. The quantification was 

done using the area of the C21:0 internal standard. All analytical determinations were done 

in triplicate. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparison with the retention times of 

known mixtures of standards (Supelco, FAME 37 and PUFA 3). 

To measure the propensity of meagre to influence the incidence of coronary heart 

disease (CHD), two indices, the Index of Atherogenicity (IA), as a measure of fat deposition 

in arteries, and the Index of Thrombogenicity (IT), that measures the potential of fatty acids 

to provoke thrombosis, were calculated according to Ulbricht and Southgate (1991) 

equations:  

 

      
                       

                            
 

 

     
                    

                                                      
 

 

Two ratios related with fatty acid content were also calculated: (n-3)/(n-6) and 

PUFA/SFA, in order to allow comparisons with the United Kingdom Department of Health 

recommendations (UKDH, 1994). 

 

2.5 Statistical analysis 

 

Statistical analyses followed methods outlined by Zar (1999). All data is expressed as 

(mean±SD). Data concerning dietary treatments were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with 

STATISTICA 11.0 software package (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Since the experimental 

design was not orthogonal, a one-way ANOVA was used to identify differences between the 

2 dietary protein levels and the 3 dietary lipid levels, at p&amp;lt;0,05, and their weight in the data. 

When these tests showed significance, pair-wise comparisons (Tukey's HSD) were used to 

determine the differences between means. If the data did not meet the assumptions of an 

ANOVA (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk’s test for normality), a 

non-parametric one-way Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used to compare means at p&amp;lt;0,05.

3 RESULTS 

3.1 Proximate analysis of diets 

 

Survival rate of the fish in different experimental tanks varied between 95,2 and 100% 

with no significant difference (p&amp;lt;0,05) in fish mortality among different diet groups. 

The proximate chemical composition of the five experimental diets is presented in 

(Graph 3.1). Comparing these values (obtained in the beginning of the trial) with the values 

assessed in the formulation of the feeds (Table 2.1), there are no differences, in terms of 

nutrients. The amounts of protein and lipids remain the same, the diets are isoenergetic, and 

the amount of phosphorus is equal. 

 

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Composition of the five different treatments. Mean values of dry matter (DM), 

protein, lipid and phosphorus are in %, and energy values are in MJ/kg.  

 

3.2 Proximate analysis of whole body composition 

 

The values obtained, on a dry matter basis, between the tissues of fish fed the different 

feeds and the initial ones, differ significantly (Figure 3.2). Treatment 50L12 had the highest 

value of protein (69,9±3,11 %) and the lowest values of energy (21,8±0,71 MJ/kg) and lipid 

(16,8±2,86 %), being the lipid value lower than the initial one (19,6±0,14 %). Treatment 

55L18 had the lowest value of ash (14,5±0,99 %), compared with the highest value 

(15,0±0.85 %) of treatment 50L15. Treatment 44L18 presented the highest values for lipid 

(22,6±2,91 %) and DM (28,8±0,65 %).

3.5 Total lipids 
 

The assessment of total lipids and its deposition was made through the analysis of the 

liver, digestive tract and muscle. Digestive tract was analyzed according to Folch et al. 

(1957) protocol, and liver and muscle samples were analyzed through Soxhlet method. As 

stated in Figure 3.9, fishes fed the treatment 50L18 had the highest mean percentages for 

lipid deposition in liver (63,11±3,98 %), digestive tract (23,64±3,00 %) and muscle 

(2,86±1,43 %). Fishes fed diet 44L18 had the lowest mean percentage of muscle lipid 

deposition (1,96±0,57 %), the ones fed with 50L12 had the lowest mean percentage of lipid 

deposition on liver (53,01±7,61 %), while the ones fed with treatment 50L15 had the lowest 

mean percentage of lipid deposition on the digestive tract (17,56±1,73 %). 

 

 
 

Figure 3.9 – Lipid deposition in liver, digestive tract, and muscle. Bars with different subscript 

letters differ significantly (p&amp;lt;0,05) and standard deviations are represented by vertical bars. 

Vertical axis is represented as log2(Y). 

 

In Table 3.4 are represented the mean percentages of lipid deposition in the liver, 

digestive tract and muscle, per treatment. Since the data didn’t meet the requirements for the 

one-way ANOVA (normality and homoscedasticity), a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was performed. 

Regarding the mean values of liver lipids, fishes fed the experimental feed 50L18 had 

significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0,05) mean values than 50L12, and fishes fed the treatment 44L18 

had significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0,05) mean values of digestive tract lipids than fishes fed the diet 

50L15; there were no significant differences (p &gt;0,05) between the mean values of muscle 

lipids. The dietary lipid level is significantly different (p&amp;lt;0,05) between the means of liver 

lipids and digestive tract lipids, per treatment. Dietary protein does not statistically affect 

(p &gt;0,05) the lipid deposition.

3.6 Fatty acid profile 

 

The fatty acid profile of meagre fed the five different diets is showed in Table 3.5. 

There were no statistically differences (p&amp;lt;0,05) between the fatty acid profiles. Fishes fed 

treatment 50L15 had a significant content of muscle SFA (34,49±5,83 %), due to high 

content in palmitic (16:0 - 23,47±4,78 %)  and stearic (18:0 - 8,07±0,70 %) acids, having the 

lowest contents in MUFA (18,52±1,27 %), DHA [22:6(n-3) - 20,47±4,88 %] and PUFA 

(41,39±5,60 %). Muscle samples from fishes fed treatment 50L12 had the lowest content in 

SFA (30,35±3,00 %) and EPA [20:5(n-3) - 7,69±0,48 %], but had the highest content in 

MUFA (21,58±2,96 %), mainly due to the high percentage of oleic acid (18:1(n-9) - 

11,95±0,82 %) and the presence of 22:1(n-11) (1,01±0,23 %). Treatment 50L18 presented 

the highest percentage of muscle EPA (20:5(n-3) - 9,12±0,23 %), while treatment 44L15 had 

the highest percentage of muscle DHA [22:6(n-3) - 23,04±4,61 %] and PUFA (44,26±6,22 

%).  

The highest and lowest content of muscle (n-3) fatty acids was, respectively, found in 

treatment 44L15 (36,14±6,20 %) and treatment 44L18 (32,75±1,30 %), mainly due to 

differences in DHA content. The sum of (n-6) fatty acids showed that fishes fed the diet 

50L12 had the highest content (9,50±0,57 %), while fishes fed diet 44L15 had the lowest 

content (7,26±0,07 %) in (n-6) fatty acids. The highest (n-3)/(n-6) fatty acids ratio was 

recorded in fishes fed diet 44L15 (4,98±0,01 %), and the lowest in diet 50L12 (3,52±0,01 %), 

which also presented the highest PUFA/SFA ratio recorded (1,45±0,23 %).

3.7 Feeding behavior 

Meagre adapts very easily to captivity, nevertheless, some measures had to be taken. 

Since it gets “scared” with ease, each fiberglass tank was covered with protection nets 

(Figure 3.12), to prevent fishes from jumping outside the tanks. They are sensitive to shades 

and noises, and can get stressed with no difficult. Since meagre fish possesses a voracious 

appetite, feeding follows a pattern. When feeds are on the top of the water, and after 

hydration, they start to dive towards the bottom, meagre prefers to feed mostly in the middle, 

and less preference for the bottom of the tank.

deaths. 

 

4 DISCUSSION 

 

There is a very limited knowledge on dietary nutrient requirements of meagre. The 

assessment of a optimum dietary protein:lipid ratio is essential to maximize production output 

and reduce costs. In a culture environment, the replication of wild conditions is made with 

ease, but feeds still represent the most important variable. With low dietary protein available, 

growth of meagre may be retarded, and with high content in dietary protein, feed will become 

very expensive and nitrogenous waste would be produced (NRC, 1993). The same stands 

for dietary lipids – deficiency makes the other nutrients (mainly protein) to be used for body 

maintenance and energy production, retarding growth, while excess of lipids may result in 

excessive fat deposition in visceral cavity and tissues. Many authors have found this 

excessive lipid deposition when studying the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hipoglossus) 

(Martins et al., 2007), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) (Craig et al., 1999), brown meagre 

(Sciaena umbra) (Cakli et al., 2006; Chatzifotis et al., 2006) and dusky kob (Argyrosomus 

japonicus) (Bernatzeder et al., 2010; Woolley et al., 2010). 

Studies argue that sciaenids grow faster in cages than in tanks (Ortega and Gándara, 

2007; Piccolo et al., 2008; Cárdenas, 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), so growth 

parameters must be calculated and compared, to assess the efficacy of treatments. In 



 

39 

 

general, feed 50L18 presented the best performance when compared with the other 

treatments, since it is within the desired levels of dietary protein (DP) and dietary lipid (DL), 

referred by Cárdenas (2010): DP&gt;45% and DL?17%. On the other way, feed 50L12 had the 

worst performance, mainly because of the low levels of dietary lipids. The reference levels for 

DP and DL were used in many studies (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Woolley et al., 2010; 

Chatzifotis et al., 2011; Martínez-Llorens et al., 2011). The compliance with those values 

allows SGR rates to be higher than 1%/day, with feeds 50L15 and 50L18 showing the 

highest SGR’s (0,99±0,04 and 1,21±0,00, respectively), which are comparable to the values 

obtained by Woolley et al. (2010), Chatzifotis et al. (2011) and Martínez-Llorens et al. 

(2011). Within the 50% DP group of treatments, 50L18 showed the highest PER (2,33±0,09), 

and the lowest FCR (1.04±0,04), showing that high values of DP and DL makes meagre to 

grow more (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), making the efficiency of feeds to be higher.  

The increase of dietary lipid within the 50% DP group appears to have a spare protein 

effect (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), but when analyzing the 44% DP group, it is notable that the 

increase in dietary lipids (from 44L15 to 44L18) actually diminishes PER means values, so 

the protein sparing effect by the increase of dietary lipids cannot be confirmed. High values 

of PER are related with high values of feed efficiency and high weight increase (Thoman et 

al., 1999), situation confirmed with treatments with 50% DP, when compared with 44% DP 

treatments.  

The values of FCR are correlated to the amount of food ingested versus the fish 

weight. With similar amounts of ingested feed, treatment 50L18 allowed fishes to grow more, 

and therefore, to present lower FCR than the other treatments. Chatzifotis et al. (2010) and 

Martínez-Llorens et al. (2011) obtained similar results with feeds having the same values of 

group 44% DP, having poor growth together with high feeding rates, making mean values of 

FCR being higher than 1,38, which is according to the values obtained in this trial.  

Finally, the high levels of dietary lipid inclusion make feeds more palatability acceptable 

(Estévez et al., 2011), and that fact could be confirmed by the high VFI recorded in diets 

44L18, 50L15 and 50L18. 

The retention values of dry matter (DM), protein and energy were higher in fishes fed 

treatment 50L18, accompanied by high daily gain mean values of nitrogen (N) and energy. 

The high amount of protein present in the 50% DP group allowed fishes to retain more 

protein than the 44% DP group, showing that feeds for meagre should have around 50% of 

crude protein in their formulation (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), which also allows fishes to retain 

more N per kg of body weight.  

All feeds were isoenergetic, and retention of energy was not different among 

treatments, with similar results being recorded by Woolley et al. (2010). On a daily gain 

basis, diet 50L18 allowed fishes to gain more energy, opposite with diet 50L12, which 

presented the lowest value (0,51±0,16 kJ) recorded. An absence of energy gain could be 

interpreted as a diet poor in nutrients (especially dietary lipids) allied with a very low feed 

intake.  

The retention of dietary lipids was not statistically different among treatments, mainly 

due to the big variation among the data set, but some approximations may be inferred. The 

balance of dietary protein with dietary lipid in each diet influences the percentage of lipids 

that are retained, showing that the level of 12% DL is not appropriated for meagre 



 

40 

 

(Chatzifotis et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), so diet 50L12 should not be used in 

formulation of commercial feeds. 

Similarly to what has been found in other cultured species, the proximate composition 

of meagre is affected by endogenous factors such as fish size and exogenous factors such 

as diet composition (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). On a whole body composition basis, and 

regarding dry matter values, feeds 44L15 and 44L18 presented high mean values for DM, 

mainly due to its lower content in DP, when compared with the 50% DP group.  

The value of dry matter protein was lower with treatment 44L18, since the interaction 

between an high level of DL and a low level of DP makes the levels of DP in fishes to be 

lower. The dry matter lipid was higher in the 44% DP group, since both DP and DL levels 

influence the amount of lipids present in fishes, with treatment 50L12 to have the lowest 

mean values, mainly due to the low lipid retention recorded. Its value is even lower than the 

initial one, what can be interpreted as the bad performance of this feed.  

When on a fresh matter basis, moisture values of 50% DP group were higher than 

44L18, mainly due to the low protein content in treatments 44% DP. Moisture and lipid values 

tend to have an inverse correlation (Cakli et al., 2006), and that was notable in the level of 

lipid in fishes fed diet 44L18 (6,53±0,94 %), opposing with fishes fed diet 50L12 (4,57±0,90 

%), and when accounting moisture values, the ones of diet 50L12 (72,85±0,75 %) were 

higher than 44L18 (71,16±0,65 %), being these values similar to ones obtained by 

Chatzifotis et al. (2010).  

Regarding energy levels, diet 44L18 presented higher value when compared with 

50L12, mainly due to the different lipid content in the feeds, since high amounts of lipids 

could be used as an energy resource (Chatzifotis et al., 2006). Values of ash and protein 

were similar between all treatments, and in accordance with the study made by Chatzifotis 

et al. (2010). 

The lipid content of liver was higher in treatment 50L18 (63,11±3,98 %) than in 

treatment 50L12 (53,01±7,61 %), but similar to treatment 44L18 (58,26±10,05 %). The 

values of muscle lipid are not significant different between treatments, with an average value 

of 2,3%. These values are much higher than the ones obtained with brown meagre and red 

drum (Chatzifotis et al., 2006), regarding the lipid content of liver, but similar to the values 

obtained for muscle fat, confirming that meagre is a low fat fish. These findings prove the 

minor role of muscle as an energy depot, but liver still is the main energy central that fulfills 

meagre energy needs. Nevertheless, when dissecting fishes from treatment 50L18, there 

were fat mesenteric depots within the abdominal wall, so fat was being accumulated in two 

places, and that it is not desirable. 

The obtained digestive tract fat percentages, ranging from 17,56±1,73 (%) to 

23,64±3,00 (%), were abnormal, and can only be due to errors in the dissection of the 

viscera. Since the viscera does not represent a fat storage depot, no conclusions could be 

made with the obtained data. 

The HSI between treatments showed no differences, but the mean value was 2,45, 

being higher than the ones obtained in the studies made by Piccolo et al. (2008) and 

Chatzifotis et al. (2010), mainly due to the high lipid content of livers, but no correlation was 

made between HSI and dietary nutrient levels (Woolley et al., 2006). 

The fatty acid profile of the different treatments presented no significant differences, but 

the mean values of SFA (?32%), MUFA (?20%), PUFA (?43%) and the ratio (n-3)/(n-6) 



 

41 

 

(?4.2), are in accordance to the values referred by Poli et al. (2003), Cárdenas (2010), 

Grigorakis et al. (2011) and Martínez-Llorens et al. (2011). The values for the (n-3)/(n-6) 

ratio in this trial are better than the ones obtained by Lenas and Nathanailides (2011), when 

working with wild sea bass, with meagre presenting more omega-3. These findings, together 

with the low AI and TI, proves that meagre is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, 

essential to a good heart condition and overall health benefits. 

5 CONCLUSION 

The main purpose of experimental trials within aquaculture is to create new techniques 

and feeding protocols, minimizing costs and maximizing production. The five experimental 

feeds had differences that may argue that some are not appropriate for the breading of 

meagre. Feeds with low dietary lipid, such as diet 50L12 should not be used for meagre 

aquaculture, since it doesn’t supply fishes with the necessary protein and lipids for a 

optimum growth. Since the balance of dietary protein and dietary lipid is essential for an 

optimum growth, diet 50L18 was the best one for the meagre growout, but its value of dietary 

lipid should be rearranged, since some fishes would gain unwanted mesenteric fat. Diet 

44L18 had a good performance, but its low level of dietary protein is a drawback for the 

rearing of meagre. Diet 50L15 had similar values to diet 50L18, not possessing significant 

differences, and without the problems with mesenteric fat deposition. 

In a future study, diets should take in account the value of 50% dietary protein, and 

values between 15% and 18% of dietary lipid. Nevertheless, protein is still the most 

expensive ingredient when formulating feeds, but these values seem to be a good approach 

for an optimum diet that could maximize meagre growth.
