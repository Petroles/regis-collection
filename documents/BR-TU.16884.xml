Abstract  

Resumo

Commercial coal production in the southern region of Brazil has been occurring since the beginning of the twentieth century. Due to the geologi-
cal characteristics of the region, large amounts of solid wastes are generated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of coal waste to 
produce concrete paving blocks. A procedure to process the coal waste with the purpose of reducing the sulfur content and changing the particle 
size distribution of the material to meet the specification of fine aggregates was developed. The methodology considered the following steps: (a) 
sampling of a coal mining waste; (b) gravity separation of the fraction with specific gravity between 2.4 and 2.8; (c) comminution of the material 
and particle size analysis; (d) technological characterization of the material and production of concrete paving blocks; and (e) acidity generation 
prediction (environmental feasibility). The results showed that the coal waste considered in this work can be used to replace conventional sand 
as a fine aggregate for concrete paving blocks in a proportion of up to 50%. This practice can result in cleaner coal production and reduce the 
demand for exploitation of sand deposits.

Keywords: coal waste, environment, fine aggregate, concrete, paving.

A produção de carvão mineral na região sul do Brasil vem ocorrendo desde o início do século XX. Devido às características geológicas da região, 
grandes quantidades de resíduos sólidos são gerados. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a utilização de rejeito de carvão para a produção de 
blocos de pavimentação de concreto. O rejeito de carvão foi beneficiado com o objetivo de reduzir o teor de enxofre e ajustar o tamanho das 
partículas do material para as especificações de distribuição granulométrica de agregado miúdo. A metodologia considerou os seguintes passos: 
(a) amostragem do rejeito de carvão mineral; (b) separação gravimétrica da fração com densidade entre 2,4 e 2,8; (c) cominuição do material e 
análise da distribuição granulométrica; (d) caracterização tecnológica do material e produção de blocos de concreto para pavimentação; e (e) 
predição da geração de acidez (viabilidade ambiental). Os resultados mostraram que o rejeito de carvão utilizado neste trabalho pode ser utilizado 
para substituir a areia convencional como um agregado miúdo na produção de blocos de concreto para pavimentação numa proporção de até 
50%. Esta prática pode colaborar com a produção mais limpa de carvão mineral e reduzir a demanda de exploração de jazidas de areia.

1. Introduction

Commercial coal production in the southern region of Brazil (com-
prising the Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul states) 
has been occurring since the beginning of the twentieth century. 
Specifically in the Santa Catarina State, the production occurs at 
the “Irapuá”, “Bonito”, and mainly “Barro Branco” seams. These 
Gondwanic coals are classified for the major part as a high-vol-
atile bituminous in rank. The thickness of the Barro Branco seam 
ranges from 1.66 to 2.27 m, with an average value of 1.80 m. How-
ever, net clean coal thickness is reduced to 0.47–1.48 m, due to 
the presence of alternating layers of impure coal (shaley coal and 
coaly shale), carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and sandstones. Py-
rite lenses that are several centimeters thick are also common [1].
Currently, the run-of-mine coal (ROM) is gravimetrically concen-
trated and almost entirely used for electricity generation. Due to 
the geological characteristics of the region, large amounts of solid 
wastes are generated.  It is estimated that more than 300 million 
metric tons of coal waste exist in the south of Brazil, generating 
environmental impacts and economic costs. Regarding the San-
ta Catarina Coalfields, about 60%–65% of the ROM coal is dis-
charged at dump deposits as waste [2]. These wastes can lead to 
the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD), a source of groundwa-
ter and surface water pollution [3]. 
Through gravity concentration processes of coal waste from Barro 
Branco seam, it is possible to produce three output streams: (i) a 
low-specific-gravity material composed of shaley coal and carbo-
naceous shale; (ii) an intermediate material composed of siltstone 
and sandstone; and (iii) a high-specific-gravity material that is rich 
in pyrite. Presently, there are some initiatives in Brazil to reprocess 
some coal waste deposits to recover part of the carbonaceous 
materials for energy production and, alternatively, to concentrate 
the pyrite for sulfuric acid production. However, the intermediate-
density material still remains, which represents 50%–60% in mass 
of the coal waste deposit and can be considered as a material for 
possible use in civil construction [4]. Mining wastes has been con-
sidered worldwide as a material for aggregate production [5,6,7], 
including coal wastes (colliery spoil) [8].  
Concrete paving blocks can be used in a large range of applica-
tions. The conventional source of fine aggregates for paving blocks 
are river sand or, alternatively, artificial sand obtained by crushing 
rocks [9]. However, previous research has shown that it is pos-
sible to use some wastes to produce concrete paving blocks, for 
example, gasification residues [10], construction and demolition 
waste [11,12], ceramic tile production wastes [13], marble pro-
duction wastes [14], recycled glass [15], polypropylene fiber [16], 
crushed brick [17], electric-arc furnace dust [18], red mud [19], and 
fly ash [19].
According to the Brazilian standard NBR 9781 [20], the compres-
sion resistance of concrete blocks for paving should meet the mini-
mum of 35 MPa for pedestrian and commercial vehicles and 50 
MPa for heavy-duty vehicles.  The same limit of 35 MPa is used 
by Thailand [21]. Other countries allow lower resistances, like India 
(30 MPa) [22], Sri Lanka (15 MPa for pedestrians) [23], and Indo-
nesia (20 MPa) [24], or require higher resistances, like USA (55.2 
MPa) [25] and UK (49 MPa) [26]. 
Thus, the aim of this work was to study the use of coal waste to 
produce concrete blocks for paving. A procedure to process the 
coal waste with the purpose of reducing the sulfur content and 

changing the particle size distribution of the material to meet the 
specification for fine aggregates was developed. Additionally, the 
coal waste aggregate was characterized in terms of its chemical 
and physical properties. The article evaluates the main technical 
and environmental parameters that are involved in recycling part of 
the coal waste and aimed at turning it into a useful product.

2. Materials and experimental program

Coal waste was collected from the coal dump deposit of the 
“Verdinho mine,” Santa Catarina State, Brazil, which extracts the 
Barro Branco seam. The material was submitted to a laboratory 
dense medium separation processing, using organic liquids, which 
aimed at obtaining a fraction with relative density between 2.4 and 
2.8 [27]. This fraction was crushed in a roller mill and sieved to 
reach the particle size distribution required for fine aggregates in 
concrete, according to NBR 7211 [28]. The mineral-processing 
steps to produce the coal waste fine aggregate from coal mining 
tailings are presented in Figure 1.
Quartz river sand was obtained from Jacuí River, Rio Grande 
do Sul State. Technological characterization of both materials 
included particle size distribution, density measurements, vi-
sual observation in a petrographic magnifying lens, and mineral 
phase determination by x-ray diffraction. Determination of sul-
fate and chloride ions was conducted following the procedure

Mineral processing and characterization of coal waste to be used as fine aggregates for concrete 
paving blocks 

described in NBR 9917 [29]. Elemental analyses of the fine 
aggregates were carried out by x-ray fluorescence (for Si, Fe, 
Al, Ca, and K) and high-temperature decomposition in a CHNS 
analyzer (for C, H, N, and S).  The main characteristics of both 
materials are summarized in Table 1.
Concrete paving blocks were produced in a vertical shaft con-
crete mixer. The reference trace used 5.36 kg of cement (CP-V-
ARI-RS), 6.26 kg of coarse granitic aggregate, 14.18 kg of river 
sand aggregate, and a water/cement ratio of 0.35. Chemical 
properties of the cement are presented in Table 2. Coal waste 
was used as a substitute for river sand aggregate, considering 
the following volumetric levels of substitution: 0%, 25%, 50%, 
75%, and 100%. For each level of substitution, the water/ce-
ment ratio was reestablished to provide the same consistency 
of concrete [30]. The concrete blocks were molded in manual 
press equipment with a production capacity of six blocks per 
cycle. The blocks were molded in the “unipaver” shape with 
the following dimensions: 22.5 cm length, 12.0 cm width, and 
8 cm height (Figure 2). The technological characterization of 
the paving blocks included resistance to compression, abrasion 
resistance and water absorption. It was produced 90 blocks for 
compression resistance, 10 blocks for abrasion resistance, and 
10 blocks for water absorption tests. The results of compression 
resistance are the average of six test results (n= 6 for each level 

of substitution and each curing period) and the curing periods 
were 7, 28, and 90 days. Abrasion resistance and water absorp-
tion were carried out in two concrete blocks (n=2) resulting from 
each level of substitution at a curing period of 28 days. The 
effect of the experimental parameters on these properties was

evaluated statistically by using analysis of variance (ANOVA, 
significance level of 95%) and the Tukey test. 
Compression resistance and water absorption were carried out 
in accordance with the Brazilian Standard Procedures NBR 9780 
[31] and NBR 9778 [32], respectively. Abrasion resistance was 
determined according to the CIENTEC method. The procedure 
consists of dividing a paving block specimen into two pieces with 
a diamond saw. Each piece is placed to a rotatory machineand 
submitted to a constant pressure of 0.06 MPa in the presence 
of an abrasive powder (silicon carbide). The aim is to simulate a 
pathway of 500 m. The width of the paving block was measured 
before and after the experiment in five positions of each paving 
block piece. The wear rate result, expressed in millimeters, is the 
mean of 10 measurements.
The acid generation potential of the raw waste, coal waste fine ag-
gregates, and blocks with 25% and 50% substitution of river sand 
by coal waste fine aggregate at 28 days was measured by the 
traditional method of accounting for acids and bases (ABA) [33]. 
The objective was to determine the balance between the minerals 
that produce acidity (acidity potential - AP) and the minerals that 
consume acidity (neutralization potential - NP). The determination 

of acidity potential (AP) was carried out from the analysis of total 
sulfur using a CHNS analyzer. AP was calculated by the following 
conversion factor: 

(1)AP = 31.25 × %S

To determine the neutralizing potential (NP), the procedure con-
sisted of subjecting the sample to an acidic solution followed by 
titration of the acid solution with sodium hydroxide (with the same 
concentration as that of the acid) to pH 7.0. The net neutralization 
potential (NNP) was calculated from the difference between NP 
and AP:

(2)NNP = NP – AP

A sample is classified as acid forming when it has NNP values 
less than -20 CaCO3/t and non-acid forming when it has NNP val-
ues greater than +20 CaCO3/t. Samples are classified as uncertain 
when their values range from -20 to +20 CaCO3/t.
A kinetic test in humidity cells following the ASTM D 5744-96 [34] 
method was carried out to evaluate the chemical stability of the 
samples. The test consisted of placing 500 g of the material, with 
particle size between 6.3 mm and 2.0 mm, in a column with an 
internal diameter of 5 cm and a height of 30 cm. The test was car-
ried out with the raw waste, coal waste fine aggregate, reference 
block, and block with 50% substitution of river sand by coal waste 
fine aggregate. During the seven-day cycle, dry air was passed 
through the column for the first three days and humidified air for the 
next three days. On the seventh day, the sample was rinsed with 
500 mL of distilled water. The leachate was collected and analyzed 
for the AMD typical parameters: pH, Eh, acidity, alkalinity, concen-
tration of metals (Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, and Ca), and concentration of 
sulfate. The procedures followed the Standard Methods for the 
Examination of Water and Wastewater [35] and the results were 
expressed in terms of average values of twenty weeks (n=20).

3. Results and discussion

Figure 3 presents particle size distribution of the coal waste fine 
aggregate as well as the river sand. Both materials have their size 
distribution from 0.15 to 4.0 mm.  However, the D50 (grain diameter 
at which 50% of the mass sample is retained or passed by the 
sieve) of the coal waste fine aggregate was 0.4 mm and the D50 of 
the river sand was 1.0 mm. So, compared to the river sand used 
in this work the coal waste fine aggregate has a higher amount of 
finer particles. It can be also observed that both materials, sepa-
rately, fit in the applicable zone, but not completely in optimal zone. 
However, the mixture composed by 50% coal waste and 50% river 
sand allows a particle size distribution entirely inside the optimal 
zone as prescribed by NBR 7211 [28].
The x-ray pattern of coal waste and the river sand applied in this 
work are depicted in Figure 4. The mineral fine aggregates pro-
duced from the coal waste have quartz as their major crystalline

phase. The presence of kaolinite, illite, and gypsum was also de-
tected as well as amorphous components. River sand aggregate 
is basically composed of quartz. The particles of coal waste are 
angular in shape, due to the rock fragmentation procedure, and 
grayish in color. In contrast, river sand particles are rounded/sub-
rounded and yellowish in color (Figure 5).
The concentration of sulfate ions in the fine coal aggregate was 
determined to be 1.00%, whereas in the river sand it were not 
detected (&lt;0.01%). Chloride ions were not detected in fine coal 
aggregate and river sand. Sulfate is considered to be harmful for 
concretes, and it is  recommended that the values of sulfates and 
sulfides in aggregates for concrete production should not exceed 
the value of 1% (mass) [36,37]. The concentration of sulfates was 
sufficiently low to be used for paving blocks production. However, 
the concentration of total sulfur was determined as 1.9%. Thus, 
for safety reasons, the fine aggregate produced from coal tailings 
should be applied in levels of river sand substitution of no more 
than 25% or 50%.
The preparation of concrete with coal waste in all levels of substi-
tution was simple. Coal waste particles mixed properly with river 
sand and allowed a mixture without sights of bleeding and seg-
regation. However, increasing the amount of coal waste particles 
in the fine aggregate, more water was necessary to maintain the 
same consistency of fresh concrete. It was expected because coal 
waste particles are more angular in shape and smaller in size.  
Table 3 shows the main technological properties of concrete blocks 
for paving, while considering the different levels of substitution. It 

is possible to observe that, increasing the level of substitution, 
there is an increase in the water/cement ratio and a decrease in 
the cement consumption. It can be observed that concrete blocks 
produced with substitution levels of 25% and 50%, at 28 days, sta-
tistically present behavior similar to the reference blocks (0% sub-
stitution) in terms of compressive resistance, abrasion resistance, 
and water absorption.
In terms of compression resistance, most of the blocks manufac-
tured with 0%, 25% and 50% substitution attained the minimum 
value of 35 MPa established by NBR 9781 [20] for commercial 
standard vehicles. The blocks produced with substitution levels of 
75% and 100% did not reach the required compression resistance. 
The loss in compression resistance in paving blocks with increas-
ing levels of substitution of river sand by alternative aggregates 
has been observed in other situations, including crushed clay brick 
[11], ceramic tile waste [13], waste marble [14], and demolition ma-
terials [12]. It was also observed a small decrease, but statistically 
significant, in compression resistance from 28 to 90 days in the 
paving blocks with any amount of coal waste. 
Increasing the level of substitution the abrasion resistance de-
creases. However, according to statistical analysis, the results 
were the same for the levels of substitution of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 
75%. Blocks with 100% substitution of river sand presented sig-
nificant difference compared to the others and, therefore, unsat-
isfactory results. Waste utilization in concrete production can be 
beneficial or harmful to abrasion resistance. The use of Class F 
fly ash [38], waste foundry sand [39], ceramic sanitary ware waste

[40] and shredded PET bottle waste [41] increased abrasion re-
sistance while fly ash [42,43,44] and bottom ash [45] decreased 
abrasion resistance.
In terms of water absorption, it was observed an increase with 
the substitution of river sand by coal waste. However, the in-
crease of water absorption for blocks with 25% to 50% coal 

waste is very low. The values of water absorption in reference 
blocks and with levels of substitution of 0%, 25% and 50% are 
statistically the same while blocks with levels of substitution of 
75% and 100% are statistically different. The same behavior 
was observed when using bottom ash [45] and recycled fine ag-
gregates from construction and demolition waste [46]. However,

the opposite effect was observed in marble aggregates [47] and 
slag aggregate [48]. 
With respect to acid generation (Table 4), the material collected 
from the coal waste deposit presents a high sulfur content of 7.0%. 
The result is an AP of 218.8 kg CaCO3/t, a NP of 0.0 kg CaCO3/t, 
and a NNP of -218.8 kg CaCO3/t. The fraction used for fine ag-
gregate production, with a density between 2.4 and 2.8, exhibited 
a reduced acid generation potential, with a sulfur content of 1.9%, 
an AP of 60.8 kg CaCO3/t, a NP of 0.0 kg CaCO3/t, and a NNP of 
-60.8 CaCO3/t. The paving blocks produced with 25% and 50% 
substitution of river sand by coal waste fine aggregate presented 
a NNP that was positive and higher than 400 kg CaCO3/t. These 

Figure 5 – Pictures showing the morphological characteristics 
of coal waste fine aggregate and river sand

results showed that the manufacture of paving blocks provided an 
alkaline environment and prevented acid generation.
A twenty weeks period test in humidity cells was carried out to con-
firm this. It can be observed in Figure 6 that the raw waste and the 
coal waste fine aggregate generate an acid leach. The pH ranged 
from 3.3 to 1.3 for the raw waste and from 4.0 to 2.6 for the coal 
waste fine aggregate. For the concrete blocks, in all situations, the 
water pH remained neutral or slightly alkaline, with the following 
pH ranges: 11.8 and 8.3 for the reference blocks and 10.3 and 
7.0 for blocks with 50% substitution. These results confirm that the 
procedure of separation of the material rich in pyrite, followed by 
the encapsulation of the fine aggregate in a concrete matrix, is a

successful procedure to avoid acid generation. The encapsulation 
of some remaining pyrite grains into the paving blocks avoids their 
contact with atmospheric oxygen and water, inhibiting pyrite oxida-
tion reactions. Table 5 presents the average values of chemical 
parameters analyzed on the leachate considering raw coal waste 
particles, coal waste fine aggregate, paving blocks with 50% substi-
tution, and reference paving blocks (100% river sand).  The leach-
ate of raw coal waste has a low pH and a very high concentration 
of metals and sulfates. This is what happens in sulfide mining sites 
and it is typically named “acid rock drainage”. The procedure ap-
plied to prepare the coal waste fine aggregate by density separa-
tion, allowed to reduce in 73% the concentration of pyritic sulfur. So, 
in this case, the leachates were less intense in terms of medium 
acidification and the release of metals and sulfate. Incorporating 

the coal waste in concrete in a proportion of 50%, acidification was 
avoided as well the metal leaching. Comparing the leached water 
of the concrete produced with 100% river sand with the concrete 
produced with coal waste in a level of 50% substitution, the results 
were quite similar. However, in the latter was observed a higher 
amount of calcium and sulfates. Calcium and sulfate leaching can 
generate empty spaces in concrete structure, and therefore affect 
adversely compression resistance in long term.
Analyzing the results, coal waste brings benefits to adjust the par-
ticles size of the fine aggregates and the presence of quartz as the 
major crystalline phase reinforces coal waste as an inert material 
with weak potential for hydraulic activity. However, the presence 
of the amorphous phase as well as the minerals kaolinite, illite, 
gypsum, and pyrite (even at low concentrations) could affect the

long-term behavior of the paving blocks. The amorphous structure 
can lead to alkali-aggregate reactivity causing expansion of the 
aggregate in hardened concrete structure [30]. Illite can also cause 
expansion and cracking of concretes in such a manner that ap-
peared analogous to alkali-silica reactivity. Expansion by illite was 
suggested to occur by swelling and followed by de-dolomitisation 
by the cement alkalis [49]. Gypsum presence in aggregates can 
produce false set in freshly mixed concrete and pyrite can oxi-
dize and release sulfates. Sulfates can react after the concrete 
has hardened, causing expansion and cracking [30,50,51]. As 
mentioned before, the same water/cement ratio used in refer-
ence concrete could not be kept in concrete produced with coal 
waste fine aggregate. The presence of clays in a cement mixture 
reduces the amount of water available for the hydration reactions, 
decreases its workability, and alters the course of the pozzolanic 
reactions [52,53,54]. Problems with increased water demand with 
clay minerals including kaolinite and illite were observed in other 
works [55,56]. These comments are in agreement with other stud-
ies about coal waste (colliery spoils) as aggregates for concrete 
production. Those studies highlighted excessive wear, expansive 
behavior and pyrite oxidation as the main drawbacks for its use 
as aggregate in civil construction [7,8].  Kinnuthia et al. applied 
colliery spoil as fine and coarse aggregates in low and medium 
strength concretes [8].
Finally, with a level of substitution of 25% the demand of coal waste 
fine aggregate was estimated to be 12.1 kg/m2 of paved area. Con-
sidering a run-of-mine coal production of 40,000 t, 60% of the ma-
terial is discharged as waste, and 50% of this fraction is separated 
between the relative densities of 2.4 and 2.8, it is possible to pro-
duce about 12,000 t of fine aggregates, which is sufficient to attend 
a paved area of about 1 km2.

4. Conclusion

The results showed that it was possible to process the coal waste 
from the carboniferous region of Santa Catarina and obtain a re-
cycled fine aggregate that can be used in civil construction. The

waste material should be submitted to a gravity separation process 
(with cut densities between 2.4 and 2.8 to remove the carbona-
ceous and pyritic fractions), which is followed by crushing in a roll 
mill. The material, composed mainly of siltstone and sandstone, 
presented a low concentration of sulfur, about 1% of sulfate, and 
a particle size distribution that met the specification for fine aggre-
gates. Concrete blocks for paving produced with 25% and 50% of 
recycled coal waste, substituted for river sand, presented satisfac-
tory results in terms of compression resistance. The use of coal 
waste as a fine aggregate for concrete block paving manufacture 
presents technical viability and environmental benefits. The de-
mand for sand deposits can be minimized and a part of the coal 
tailings can be used, reducing the volume in coal waste deposits. 
We believe that this procedure can be applied to minimize the en-
vironmental problems posed by coal production in Brazil.
