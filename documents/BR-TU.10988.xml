Resumo 

 

Os combustíveis fosséis, carvão, petroléo e gás natural, constituem a maior parte das fontes de 

energia primária a nível mundial. Sendo a energia essencial ao bem-estar da população e ao 

desenvolvimento da sociedade, produzir e utilizar energia de forma sustentável é vital para a 

humanidade. Porém, a dependência de combustíveis fosséis é demasiado elevada e sendo esta 

uma fonte limitada na natureza, é necessário contrariar o seu uso nos diversos setores. Na 

Indústria Aeroespacial a utilização de painéis solares é uma alternativa executável. 

Esta Dissertação de Mestrado inclui um plano concetual de um sistema propulsivo elétrico, 

destinado a um UAV com uma envergadura de 4,5 m e um peso de aproximadamente 52 N. A 

construção deste sistema é particularmente diferente dos métodos convencionais de propulsão, 

pelo que o seu projeto e dimensionamento dependem especialmente da energia disponível 

armazenada na bateria, e da potência gerada pelos painéis solares. 

Devido à variação da intensidade de radiação solar em diferentes zonas do país e do ano, foi 

elaborado um plano de testes experimentais para verificar a viabilidade do sistema. Estes testes 

demonstram que a potência disponível é especialmente influenciada pelo eixos vertical e 

longitudinal, dados por arfagem e pranchamento. Embora seja uma aeronave de pequenas 

dimensões, a asa para além da sua função aerodinâmica, possui uma zona adequada aquando a 

colocação das células solares, deste modo, recorrendo uma diferenciação de segunda ordem é 

demonstrado que esta colocação seria ideal a 1,5 cm do bordo de fuga.  

Ainda, uma simulação da missão foi realizada no Túnel de Vento da Universidade da Beira 

Interior atingindo o seu propósito com sucesso. Portanto, é estudado o posicionamento 

apropriado dos módulos solares, desenvolvido um método de fixação à Estrutura Alar e 

projetado o circuito elétrico de modo a realizar um voo sustentável.

Abstract 

 

Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, are the worldwide primary energy resources. 

Energy is essencial to the peoples’ well-being and society development, as it is known today 

and expected in the future to produce and use energy in a sustainable way is vital to our 

civilization. However, dependence on fossil fuel is awfully high and it is necessary to hinder 

their use in several industries as it is a limited resource. In the Aeroespace Industry solar 

energy has been gaining widespread development, becoming the solution to many negative 

factors.  
This Master Thesis includes a conceptual design of an electric propulsion system for a UAV with 

a wingspan of 4.5 m and a weight of approximately 52 N. The construction of this system is 

different from conventional propulsion methods, so the design and sizing rely on the available 

energy stored in the battery and the power generated by the solar panels. As solar radiation is 

different throughout the year, a plan for experimental tests was drafted to verify the system 

viability. Experiments show that exact azimuth orientation is not critical, vertical axis given by 

pitch and roll, have a more important effect on performance. Although it is a small aircraft, 

the wing beyond its aerodynamics function, has a proper zone where solar cells should be 

placed. Appealing to a second order differentiation it is possible to determine that solar panels 

should be placed at 1.5 cm from the trailing edge affecting as little as possible the airfoil. 
A mission simulation was done to understand the propulsion system feasibility. Although, the 

eight hour sustainable-flight was not possible to replicate the motor still ran for 5 hours, being 

the battery charged during cruise phase as pretended.  Therefore, proper solar cells placement, 

development of a mounting method and electrical circuit design are carried out in order to 

allow the UAV to achieve a sustainable-flight.

Introduction 

1.1 Motivation 

Solar Energy is very important in various industries since it is a clean energy extracted by 

Solar Radiation. In the Aerospace industry, this is the key to many negative factors such as 

environmental pollution, noise and the dependence of fuel witch is a limited resource in 

nature.  

The main motivation comes from the environmental challenges that the planet is going 

through. Since global warming until the lack of natural resources. The commercial aircraft 

today use a large amount of fuel which has a negative impact on the atmosphere due to 

release of carbon. One way to solve this problem would be to eliminate fossil fuels and finding 

an alternative, as hydrogen or biofuels, however that may also be depleted over time. Thus, 

a propulsion system using solar energy not only can be successful, as may also be the future 

and the solution to all the environmental problems in aviation. 

1.2 Objectives  

Initially it is necessary to select the type of mission and the energy requirements that are 

needed. Once the mission is chosen it follows the design propulsion system with all the details 

to achieve a sucessful mission. So the leading goal is to project a propulsion system that 

provide a sustainable-flight.The requirements include:  

1. Definition of the propulsion system architecture; 

2. Size photovoltaic cells and solar arrays; 

3. Desgin an attachament system for the solar panels; 

4. Design and assemble the electronic circuit. 

5. Develop a solar panel experiments guideline; 

6. Assemble the system.  

 

1.3 Structure of the Document 

This master thesis first starts with a theoretical background related to the main work done, 

where a brief history of solar-powered aircraft is discussed as well as other UAV studies.It 

then continues with the specification of the mission and the necessary energy requirements 



2 

 

to provide a sustainable-flight. Once the mission and the energy requirements are selected it 

follows the Propulsion System Architecture, in which, each different component of the solar 

powered system is described. On a following stage, it is studied the appropriate position of 

the solar cells on the wing and a found a method to mount them. 

 As it is expected, solar radition is different throughout the year, for this reason some 

experimental tests are conducted and reported. The results from the experiments are then 

compared with solar cells values concebed in a laboratory environment. This chapter enable 

to determine the solar cells efficiency and validate the propulsion system.  

To finish, the conclusions will be stated at the end of this document as well as some 

considerations about future work.

Chapter 2 

 

State-of-art 

The achievement of a solar powered aircraft capable of continuous flight was still a dream 

some years ago, but this great challenge has become feasible today. In fact, significant 

progresses have been realized recently in the domains of flexible solar cells and high energy 

density batteries. In this section, a brief history of solar-powered aircraft will be discused, as 

well as other UAV studies that have been done over the last 40 years.To understand the history 

of solar- powered flight, a discussion of solar cells is also required.  

2.1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 

According to the Department of Defense of the United States of America1 an unmanned 

aerial vehicle is defined “as powered, aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, 

use aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, 

can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. Ballistic or 

semi-ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles are not considered UAV by 

the DOD definition. UAVs are either described as a single air vehicle (with associated 

surveillance sensors), or a UAV system, which usually consists of three to six air vehicles, a 

ground control station, and support equipment.” 

2.2 Solar Energy 

The most plenteous energy resource that exists in the world is Solar Energy. Surely, the fee 

at which solar energy interceps the Earth is about 10,000 2  times greater than the speed at 

which the humankind uses energy. Although not all countries are equally gifted with solar 

energy, it is possible for nearly all, a meaningful contribution from a combination of energy 

from direct solar radiation. The conversion of solar energy is a large family of different 

technologies to please a range of needs for energy services. Solar technologies can provide 

heating, cooling, natural lighting and electricity for a variety of applications. 

2.2.1 The Photovoltaic Effect  

On 1839 a french physicist first observed the physical phenomenon responsible for 

converting light to electricity, his name was Edmund Becquerel. He noted that a voltage 

acted when one of two indentical electrodes in a weak conducting solution was 



4 

 

illuminanetd. The PV effect was primarily studied in solids, such as selenium (1). Selenium 

is capable to convert light in the visible part of the sun’s spectrum and for then quickly 

adopeted by the then-emerging field of light- measuring devices.  Selenium cells cost is 

too high relative to the insignificant amount of power they produce so they have never 

become pratical as energy converters. Meanwhile, work on the physics of PV effect has 

expanded and a main step forward in solar-cell technology took place on 1940 when the 

CZ (for more information go to Annex Appendix A) technique was developed for 

producing highly pure crystalline silicon.  

According to “Basic Photovoltaic Principles and Methods” 3, “the Photovoltaic effect is 

the basic of conversion of light to electricity in photovoltaic or solar cells.Described 

simply, the PV effect is as follows: Light, which is pure energy enters a PV cell and 

imparts enough energy to some electrons (negatively charged atomic particles) to free 

them. A built-in-potencial barrier in the cell acts on these electrons to produce a voltage 

(the so-called photovoltage), which can be used to drive a current through a circuit” as 

can be seen on Figure 2.1.    

 

Figure 2.1- Photovoltaic Solar Panel Working Principle 4. 

 
  

                                                 
(1) Selenium – a nonmetallic element chemically resembling sulfur and tellurium, occurring in several allotropic forms, 

as crystalline and amorphous, and having an electrical resistance that varies under the influence of light. Symbol:

Charge carriers like electrons and holes are generated when sulingh raids a solar cell. 

The holes are drawn into the positive, p-layer, and the electrons are drawn into the 

negative,n-layer, both are separated by the internal fild produced by junction. When a 

circuit is made, the free electrons have to get through the load to recombine with the 

positive holes, thus producing current from the cells under illumination.  

 

2.2.3 Photovoltaics Industry 

The PV industry is rising, with rates of 30 % 5 per year over the last decade. This progresss 

has been determined by the market development programs to accelerate the deployment 

of sustainable energy options and rapidly increasing fossil fuel prices.This proves, if need 

be, that solar photovoltaics is on the way to becoming a major part of the eletricity system, 

delivering clean, safe and affordable energy to the greater number all around the globe.  

2.2.3.1 Solar Cells Evolution 

a)  1st  Generation Solar Cells ,  Crystalline Silicon PV techonolgy (c-Si) 

Silicon-based technology is the leading technology in the commercial production of solar 

cells, accounting for about 85% of the solar cell market. It is technically proven and has 

succeed in achieving market penetration, primarily in off-grid remote areas and lately in 

grid-connected applications. There are however, several limitations to this 1st generation 

technology from the onset. Silicon wafers are very fragile and the process involved in the 

manufacturing is difficult and labor intensive, therefore high cost. There are two types 

of crystalline, or wafer-based silicon PV: monocrystalline and multicrystalline. 

Monocrystalline semiconductor wafers are cut from single-crystal silicon ingots. 

Multicrystalline semiconductor wafers are cut from directionally solidified blocks or 

grown in thin sheets. Monocrystalline ingots are more difficult, energy intensive, and 

expensive to grow than simple blocks of multicrystalline silicon. However, 

monocrystalline silicon produces higher- efficiency cells.

Figure 2.2- Production process for typical crystalline silicon solar cells 6. 

The rated efficiencies of standard c-Si PV modules are about 14 % to 16 % for commercial 

scale and module efficiencies of about 17 % to 21 % for a laboratory scale 7. 

b) 2nd Generation solar cells : Thin-Film technology solar cells  

In order to cut down the manufacturing costs, thin-film solar cells appear as alternatives. 

The technology earns from the low processing temperature. Thin-film PV cells consist of 

a semiconductor layer a few microns (µ?) of thickness, which is about 100 times thinner 

than current ?– ?? cells. Most thin films are direct bandgap semiconductors, which means 

they are capable of absorving energy contained in sunlight with a much thinner layer 

than traditional ?– ?? PV. The most common thin-film semiconductor materials are ????, 

?– ?? and ????.  

The main disadvantage of ?– ?? solar cell is the degration of their performance under 

light exposure over time. Another notable concept of ?– ?? solar cells is hydrogenated 

amorphous silicon ?– ??: ?combined with microcrystalline silicon µ? ? ??: ? forming the 

multi-junction thin-film silicon solar cell.  The advantage of µ? ? ??: ? is that it absorbs 

light from the red and near infrared part of the spectrum, thus increasing the 

efficiency.The potential drawbacks of ???? and ???? solar cells are materials availability 

for long-term use and issues with toxicity (????) and mass production has been proven 

to be difficult (????). The efficiency of the second generation solar cells varies from 11% 

to 20 % for laboratory scale and 9 % to 12 % for commercial scale7.

c) 3rd Generation solar cells 

Research for improving solar cell performance by enhancing its efficiency has led to 

the development of the third generation solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells use dye 

molecules absorbed onto a nanostructured substrate and immersed in a liquid to 

absorb solar radiation and have demonstrated laboratory efficiencies as high as 

11.1 %. OPV solar cells, established on polymers or small molecules with 

semiconductor properties, have demonstrated laboratory cell efficiencies above 8 %. 

Organic modules have the potential for low-cost manufacturing using existing printing 

and lamination technologies.  

There are significant challenges to the commercialization of solution-processed 

organic solar cells and dye-sensitized, due to the stability of the materials against 

oxygen and water ingress. This limits the lifetime of these devices to anywhere from 

a few hundred hours to 2 years. This issue is being addressed through efforts to 

develop improved, yet cost-effective, encapsulants. In addition, organic and dye-

sensitized solar cells use dyes that have been shown to degrade when put in direct 

sunlight for long periods of time, a significant issue to have in a solar cell7. 

 

d) Concentrating PV 

CPV uses mirros or lenses made out of low-priced materials such as glass, steel, and 

plastic to focus sunlight onto a relatively small semiconductor area. This technique 

have several significant advantages. First, it reduces the amount of active 

semiconductor material needed to produce a given amount of electricity. On an area 

basis, the active semiconductor material is the most complex and expensive 

component of many PV modules; this is particularly true for MJ cells. MJ cells are 

capable of much higher efficiencies than single junction silicon or thin-film cells. 

This is because each junction of a MJ cell is designed to collect a different part of 

the solar spectrum: MJ cells are typically a load of three different cells on top of one 

another. This higher efficiency comes at an increase in manufacturing cost, and thus 

MJ devices are too expensive to use in terrestrial applications without concentration. 

The downside to CPV, especially for higher concentration levels, is that, in order to 

maintain the concentration of sunlight on the cell, the module must accurately follow 

the sun throughout the day. Tracing results in a more complex and expensive 

installation. Recent improvements to MJ PV cells have produced cell efficiencies of 

43.5 % in the laboratory7.

2.4 NREL’s world wide best research in laboratory 

The Chart shown on figure 1, summarizes the world wide research effort over the last 40 

years. These solar cells are concebed in a laboratory environment and their area is not 

often larger than 1 square centimeter. 

 

 

Figure 2.3- World Wide Best Research cell efficiencies over the last 40 years in laboratory 8.  

The devices included in this plot have efficiencies that are confirmed by independent, 

recognized test laboratories and are reported on a standardized basis. The measurements for 

new entries must be according to standard test or reporting conditions (STC).  As can be seen 

on Figure 2.2, cell efficiency results are provided with diferents families of semiconductors 

as well as some 26 different subcategories. These diferents familes of semiconductors are 

indicated by distinctive colored symbols.  The purple colored, Multijunction and Single 

Gallium Arsenide cells markers, represents the III-V technology (a combination of group III and 

group V, called III-V semiconductors), based on single, double and triple junctions and have 

efficiencies ranging from 26 % up to 44 % under concentrated light conditions.  The blue lines 

and dots represente the crystalline silicon technology based on monocrystalline and 

multicrystalline silicon which record efficiencies range from 20.4 % to 27.6 %.  The inorganic 

thin-film techonologies, like thin-film silicon, ???? and ???? are indicated by the green 

markers and their record effiencies range from 13.4 % up to 20 %.  The red colored lines and 

markers indicats the emerging PV techonologies like organic solar cells.  It is necessary to 

take into account that these are laboratory results of a very small area of solar cells and this

chart does not tells us anything of the long term stability of some PV techonologies, certainly 

not the one indicated in red9. 

 

2.5 History of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  

The first aircraft flight powered by a solar propulsion system took place on the 4th of 

November 1974 at Camp Irwin in California. Sunrise I, flew 20 minutes at an altitude of 100 

m throughout its inaugural flight. It had a wingspan of 9.76 m, weight of 12.25 kg and a 

power output of 450 W from 4096 solar cells .Regrettably, Sunrise I was seriously damaged 

when caught flying in a sand storm. An improved version, Sunrise II, was built and tested on 

the 12th of September 1975. With an equivalent wingspan, its weight was reduced to 10.21 kg 

and the 4480 solar cells were capable of delivering 600 W. After many weeks of testing, this 

second version was also damaged due to a failure in the command and control system. 

Despite all, the history of solar flight was engaged and its first demonstration was done10. 

 

 
 

Figure 2.4- Sunrise II, 1975 11. 

High Altitude Long Endurance Platforms and Eternal flight 

The US government gave funding to AeroVironment Inc. to study the feasibility of long 

endurance solar electric flight above 19 000 km. As a result they patronized the Pathfinder 

project which accomplished it first flight at Dryden in 1993. When funding for this program 

ended, the 30 m wingspan and 254 kg aircraft became a part of NASA’s ERAST program that 

started in 1994. In 1995, he exceeded Solar Challenger’s altitude record for solar-powered 

aircraft when it reached 15 392 m and two years later he set the record to 21 802 m. In 

1998, Pathfinder was modified into a new version, Pathfinder Plus, which had a bigger 

wingspan and new solar aerodynamic propulsion and system technologies. The main 



10 

 

objective was to validate these new elements before building its successor, the Centurion 

10. 

 

 
 
      Figure 2.5- Pathfinder in Flight over Hawaii 12.  

 

 

 

 
       Figure 2.6- Pahtfinder- Plus in flight over Hawaii13.  

Centurion, which had a double wingspan compared to Pathfinder, was conceived to perform 

a flight powered by solar energy that coud stay airborne for weeks or months. Its goal was 

to achieve scientific sampling and imaging missions or serving as telecommunications relay 

platforms. It was capable to transport 45 kg of remote sensing and data collection 

instruments for use in scientific studies and also 270 kg of sensors, telecommunications and 

imaging equipment that could go up to 24 400 m of altitude.It would also have a lithium 

battery that could provide enough energy for two going up to five hours flight after sunset, 

but insufficient to fly whole night. 10

Figure 2.7- Centurion, 1997-1999 14.  

Helios was the last prototype built. For NASA, the two main objectives were to demonstrate 

sustained flight at an altitude near 30 480 m  and a continued flight for at least 24 hours, 

including  14 hours above 15240 m, at least. In 2001, Helios achieved the first goal near 

Hawaii with an unofficial world-record altitude of 29 524 m and a 40 minutes flight above 

29 261 m. But unfortunately, it never reached the second objective as it was destroyed when 

it fell into the Pacific Ocean on June 26, 2003 due to structural failures10.

The Official World Record time for longest duration Unmanned Flight  

Two Zephyr aircrafts were first trialed in New Mexico in December 2005 by a British company 

called QinetiQ, achieving a maximum duration of 6 hours and reaching an altitude of 7 

925 m. After an 18 hours of flight in July 2006, one of the aicrafts developed by QinetiQ 

exceeded the official world record time for the longest duration unmanned flight with a 54 

hour flight in New Mexico on the 10th of September 2007, reaching a maximum altitude of 

17 786 m. Weighting only 30 kg for 18 m wingspan, the aircraft used solar power for the 

ascent, reverting to lithiumsulphur battery power as dusk fell. QinetiQ expects in the future 

flight duration of some months at an altitude above 15 240 m16.

A Remarkable Project  

One of the most remarkables projects of solar energy is Solar Impulse, which is a long range 

solar powered aircraft manned. It is headed by Bertrand Piccard, who co-piloted the first 

balloon to circle the world non-stop, and André Borschberg.  

According to Solar Impulse “The goal of the project is to fly around the world with zero 

fuel. This challenge will be undertaken by Solar Impulse’s second generation aircraft, HB-

SIB, which is currently under construction. It will be fully assembled in the spring of 2014 

and will fly around the world a year later.”  

The first Flight was executed on 2010 and at the same year they reached a long-duration 

flight of 26 hours, 10 minutes and 19 secondes. Solar Impulse in its inaugural flight 

accomplished three record: maximum altitude, endurance and gain height, 9235 m, 

26h10m19s, 8744 m, respectively. The second Solar Impulse, HB-SIB construction started on 

2011 and first flown on 2014. As André Borschberg said "It is the first aircraft which will have 

almost unlimited endurance.” The wingspan would be 72 m, it would carry 17, 000 solar 



 

13 

 

cells that supply four electric motors and achieved an altitude of 5,500 m. The average 

ground speed was 56 km/h18.

Chapter 3 

 

Aircraft Description and Mission 

This chapter first starts with the description of the aircraft mission and vehicle 

characterization, ending with a brief introduction to the non-conventional propulsion system 

powered by solar energy. The material presented here is part of a cooperative research 

project involving tree research units that belong to the line of Aeronautics and Space of LAETA 

(2), namely CCTAE (3), AEROG (4) and IDMEC (5).  

3.1 Solar UAV Mission 

The LEEUAV project aims to develop a Long Endurance Electric Unammaned Aerial Vehicle 

powered by solar energy that must be as light as possible and be able to carry a payload of 1 

kg. UAVs are slighty more cost effective to acquire and operate than conventional manned 

aircraft, so the objective of this project is to create a reasonable cost platform that can be 

handly installed in areas with small space. The aircraft has to be able to collect and store 

energy for long endurance flight. The mission profile may be summarized as follows: 

1. Take-off in a very short distance ( in 8 m) or Launched by hand (in 3 m); 

2. Climb to 1000 m above ground level for a cruise altitude, in 10 minutes; 

3. Sustainable-flight  of 8 hours at equinox with a flight cruise speed of no less than 7 m/s; 

4. Descend from cruise altitude during 29 minutes to ground level without power;  

5. Landing in the field. 

The energy requirements have been calculate based on the efficiency of each component of 

the propulsion system in every stage of the mission. The efficiencies of battery, cables and 

electronic speed controlller ESC, are fixed for the entire mission while the efficiencies of the 

electric motor and propeller are different in each stage.The propulsive power required for 

each stage of the mission can be estimated as:  

 

???? = ?????? × ??????  (3.1)

(5) IDMEC. Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Lisbon, Portugal 



16 

 

where ??????  is the corresponding aircraft speed and ??????  is the aircraft drag. Knowing the 

duration of each stage, ??????, it is then possible to calculate the propulsive energy required 

at each stage of the mission:  

 

???? = ???? × ??????  (3.2) 

 
 

The total efficiency of the components is estimated as: 
  
 

?????? = ?? × ?? × ???? × ??????? × ???????  

 

(3.3) 

 

where ??  , ?? and ????  are the efficiency of battery, cable and electronic speed controller, 

common for all stage, and ???????  and ???????  are the efficiency of electric motor and 

propeller for the particular stage. Then the total required energy can be determined as: 

 

???? =
????

??????
× ??????  

(3.4) 

 

 

The best option to generate energy during cruise flight is to accommodate highly efficiency 

solar cells on the upper wing surface. The total energy required and the maximum electrical 

power required were used for sizing the propulsion system.Table 3.1 summarizes the values 

of required electrical power and energy for each segment of the mission:  

 
Table 3.1 – Energy requirements for propulsion system 20.  
 

 

3.2 Aircraft Specifications 

The aircraft dimension is important to produce a high performance design.It has to be large 

enough to accommodate all electronic but has to be capable of depoyment from small landing-

fields.The conceptual design of the airframe has been concluded and some of the relevant 

UAV specfications are summarized in table 3.2 20.

Beyond its aerodynamic purpose the airfoil shown in Figure 3.1 has an additional importance 

regarding its curvature. It is a significant factor when attaching the solar panels that have 

limited flexibility.  

 

 

Figure 3.1 - 12% airfoil non-dimensional coordinates. 

The solar cells are to be installed on the wing upper surface. Because of the limited flexibility 

of the solar panels to conform with the airfoil profile shape, and estimated area available 

???  was obtained using three correction factors applied to the wing reference area ???? : 

curvature correction factor at the leading edge ???? (15 %), to account for the excessive 

curvature in this area; correction factor at the trailing edge, ???? (10 %), to account for the  

area occupied by the control surfaces; and wingspan correction factor, ??? (18 %), to account 

for a safety zone at each wing tip:  

This lead to the folowing available area for installation of the panels:

3.3 Electric Propulsion System with Solar Energy 

The aim of this project is to design an energy generation system able to provide a sustainable 

flight of 8 hours. However, the use of conventional methods for energy storage do not allow 

the storage of enough energy to sustain the model airborne over the course of the mission. 

For this particullary reason, an electric propulsion system powered by photovoltaic solar cells 

was planned.  This system would be accomplished by joining an energy storage device and an 

energy production system. The energy accumulador would be a high density battery and the 

production system a solar array connected to a charge controller.

Solar Module, Solar Panel and Solar Array 

Arrangement. 

In the outdoor environment the magnitude of the current ouput from a PV module directly 

depends on the solar irradiance and can be increased by connecting solar cells in parallel. 

The voltage of a solar cell depends primarily on the cell temperature. PV modules can be 

designed to operate at different voltages by connecting solar cells in series. This chapter aims 

to describe and justify each decision regarding the solar module arrangement. 

4.1 Solar Panel  

Sunpower C60 solar cells have been chosen to supply the photovoltaic effect needed.Figure 

4.1 ilustrates these solar cells. 

 
 

Figure 4.1- C60 Solar Cell and Bond Pad Dimensions 22.  

 

The module is encapsulated with a polymer encapsulant on the front side and a polymer 

backsheet, which protects and gives strength to the cells and allows easy mounting of the 

panel. The edges are sealed for weatherproofing. For large power applications, as in this case, 

the PV modules are connected in series. 

  



22 

 

4.1.1 Efficiency  

The solar cell efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy output from the solar cell to 

input energy from the sun. The energy conversion efficiency (???) of a solar cell is the 

percentage of the solar energy to which it is exposed that is converted into electrical 

energy. This is calculated by dividing a cell’s power ouput (in watts) at its maximum 

power point (????) by the input light irradiance (W/m2),  (????) and the surface area 

of the solar cell (?). Expressed as: 

??? =  
????

???? × ?
 

(4.1) 

4.1.2 Current and Voltage Solar Cell  

The typical I-V curve of a solar cell has a very characteristic shape. When the cell pads 

are not connected, no current is produced and the voltage equals to  ???, the open circuit 

voltage. When it is short circuited, the voltage is zero but the current equals to ???. In 

between these two points there is a working point, called the maximum power point, 

where the power is the highest value possible and equals to: 

????=???? ×  ????  

 

(4.2) 

 

It is exactly at this point that the cells should be operated and the ratio between  ???? 

and the light intensity represents precisely the efficiency of the solar cell. However, the 

curve, and thus this point, is not fixed and varies depending on temperature and 

irradiance values. 

 

 

Figure 4.2- Example of an I-V curve characteristcs of PV module 23. 



 

23 

 

The charge controller is used as an electronic device that varies the electrical operating 

point of the solar array to extract the maximum power possible, called, MPPT.  As shown 

in Figure 4.3, the voltage and current typical efficiency curve depends on its irradiance 

(W/m2). 

 

 
  

Figure 4.3-Sunpower C60 typical I-V Curve 22.   
 

The current of a solar cell is proportional to its area and varies almost linearly with the 

light intensity.  Like all semiconductor devices, solar cells are sensitive to temperature. 

The decrease in the band gap of a semiconductor with increasing the temperature can 

be viewed as increasing the energy of the electrons in the material. Lower energy is 

therefore needed to break the bond. In the bond model of a semiconductor band gap, 

reduction in the bond energy also reduces the band gap. Therefore increasing the 

temperature reduces the band gap. In a solar cell, the parameter most affected by an 

increase in temperature is the open-circuit voltage. The impact of increasing 

temperature is shown in the figure 4.4 24. Chapter 7 shows a detailed study on the 

temperature effect of the selected solar cells.  

  

 

 

Figure 4.4- Effect of temperature on the I-V characteristics of a solar cell 24.

4.2 Solar Array  

Components of an electrical circuit can be connected in many diferent ways. The two simplest 

of these are called series and parallel. Components connected in series are connected along 

a single path, so the same current flows through all components and the voltage increases. 

Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each 

component, and the current increases. Sunpower C60 solar cells’ typical electrical 

characteristics standart test conditions are given in table 4.1:  

Tabela 4.1- Electrical characateristc of a typical cell C60 at standard test conditions (STC) 22.

J 3.42 22.5 0.582 5.93 0.687 6.28 

 

Sunpower C60 solar cells have a maximum of 22.5 % 22 rated efficiency and an area of 0.018 m2 

per cell. The solar array consists of four modules of solar cells. Two modules of twelve 

photovoltaic cells and two modules of ten photovoltaic cells, all connected in series, Table 

4.2:

25 

 

The total area amounts to 0.72 m2, which at the rated efficiency should ouput 151.8 W at 

maximum irradiation ground level of 1000 W/m2 at 25º C. Since a single solar cell produces a 

nominal voltage of 0.582 V, Table 4.1, and the propulsion system will work at 12 V, at least 

22 solar cells connected in series, ???  = 0.582 × 22 = 12.80 V, are required. Since the Rated 

battery output current is 10.5 A and the recommended maximum ???  at STC is 27 V it was 

decided that the four modules could be connected in series and therefore facilitate the 

wirring between the solar arrays.  We first start by multipling the 0.582 V by 44 solar cells to 

obtain the solar panel maximum nominal voltage:  

????? ??? = 0.582 × 44 =  25.6  ? 

 

(4.3) 

Since the solar charger has a maximum output of 27 ? the connections are within the 

maximum value. Following the same reasoning, the current of the solar panel connected in 

series will be 5.93 A.Therefore, multipling the solar panel maximum voltage with the current 

we obtain the maximum power ouput:  

???? = 25.6 × 5.93 =  151.8 ? (4.4) 

 

The battery module seleced in this system is a Lithium Polymer rechargeable battery with a 

nominal voltage of 11.1 V. As the maximum recommended voltage at STC of the charge 

controller is 27 V, the rated battery voltage is 12 V and the maximum power ouput from the 

solar array is whithin the MPPT value and the system is compatible. Table 4.3 contains the 

characterics of the complete solar array arrangement in series:

4.2.3 Solar Cells Flexiblity  

The solar panel flexibility has a major importance when conforming the airfoil curvature so 

its flexibitily is studied using a polynomial approximation and a second order differentiation. 

Figure 4.5 shows the 12 % airfoil upper wing surface.  

 
 

Figure 4.5- Upper Wing Surface using non-dimensional coordinates. 

 

The second derivative of a function is the derivative of the derivative of that function which 

represents the curvature. We write it as  ???(?) or as  
?2?

??2
  and it studies the rate of change of 

a continuous function. To deduce the second order equation a sixth degree polynomial 

approximation is used.The objective is to obtain an approximation as close as possible to the 

actual function. This is accomplished by using the polynomial of high degree, as shown in 

Figure 4.6. The equation obtained is:

The range defined between the two straight lines in Figure 4.7 corresponds to the data range 

estimation for smother curvature. Laminar flow tends to occur at lower velocities therefore 

the airfoil disruption caused by the solar module should be placed as far back from the leading 

eadge as possible. Figure 4.7 shows that the solar panels should be placed at 1.5 cm from the 

trailing edge affect the aerodynamics of the airfoil as little as possible and to easily conform 

to its curvature.   

Two sets of twelve solar cells exact placement on the central module of the wing are shown 

in Figure 4.8 and 4.9.

Unmanned aerial vechicles are ideally suited for long endurance flights, but to be able to 

make full use of this feature, effective power sources need to be developed to ensure the 

long endurance functionality of the propulsion system and onboard equipment. The objective 

of this section is to describe each different component of the solar powered system and 

present the complete electric propulsion design. 

5.1 Propulsion System components 

A solar energy system that is properly installed and adequately sized will not require 

significant management. However, for those times of marginal sun or very large power 

requirements it is important to understand the relationship between the battery charge level, 

the amount of charge that they are receveing and the power being withdrawn from the 

system.Figure 5.1 shows the complete electric propulsion system scheme.

5.1.1 Solar Panel 

For the solar array, Sunpower C60 Photovoltaic solar cells were chosen, figure 5.1. The anti-

reflective coating and the reduced voltage provide exceptional energy delivery per power 

watt. Their innovative all back contact design moves gridlines to the back of the cell, which 

not only generates more power but also presents a more attractive cell design compared to 

conventional cells and a better surface for aerodynamic applications. 

  

 
 

Figure 5.2- Sunpower C60 Photovoltaic Solar Cell 22. 

The solar panel can be used as a component of a larger photovoltaic system to generate and 

supply electricity in specific applications. Because a single solar cell can produce only a 

limited amout of power, most installations contain multiple cells and e even panels. This 

project’s system layout contains 4 solar panels with a total of 44 cells wired in series generatin 

151.8 W with specific constraints.   

5.1.2 Solar Charge Controller (SCC) 

A charge controller monitors the battery’s state-of-charge to ensure that when the battery 

needs charge-current it gets it, and also ensures the battery is not over-charged. Connecting 

a solar panel to a battery without a regulator seriously risks damaging the battery and 

potentially causing a safety concern. Charge controllers are rated based on the amount of 

current they can process from a solar array. If a controller is rated at 20 A it means that it is 

possible to connect up to 20 A of solar panel output current to this one controller. The most 

advanced charge controllers also include maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techonology. 

The charge controller chosen for LEEUAV Genasun GV-10, shown in figure 5.3. 



 

31 

 

 
 

Figure 5.3- MPPT Solar charge controller Genasun GV-10 25.  

 

Maximum power point tracking is an electronic system that operates the PV modules in a 

manner that allows the modules to produce all the power they are capable of. MPPT is a fully 

electronic system that varies the electrical operating point of the modules maximizing the 

amout of current going into the battery from the solar array by lowering the panel’s output 

voltage. 

5.1.3 Battery 

The electrochemical batteries are energy storage devices which are able to convert 

chemically stored energy into electrical energy during discharging. They are composed of 

cathode and an anode made of two dissimilar metals that are in contact with an electrolyte. 

When all elements are in contact with each other, a flow of electrons is produced. The chosen 

battery is LiPo (Lithium Polymer) and the main advantage of these batteries is its high 

discharge capacity and good specific energy. The battery that fits in this propulsion system is 

a 10,000 mAh 3S LiPo battery operating at a nominal voltage of 11.1 V. 

5.1.4 Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) 

An electronic speed controller works by applying full voltage to the motor, but turning it on 

and off rapidly. By varying the ratio of on time to off time, the speed controller varies the 

average voltage that the motor sees. Since at any given instant, the control is either fully off 

or fully on, this kind of control is theoretically 100 % efficient. In reality, electronic speed 

controllers are not 100 % efficient. Ignoring the factors introduced by switching rate the loss 

in efficiency is due to the fact the components doing the actual switching are not perfect. 



32 

 

They are not mechanical switches, and therefore have significant resistance. Whenever there 

is current flowing through a resistence, there is a power loss. When choosing the ESC it is 

necessary taking into acount the carrying current capacity, which is at least 65 A already 

established on the prelimany design of the LEEUAV. The selected ESC is Castle Creations 

Phoenix Edge model lite 100 A, supporting a maximum current of 100 A.  

5.1.5 Electric Motor and Propeller 

An electric motor uses electrical energy to produce mechanical work. The selection of a 

particular motor depends obviously on its application. Its choise has a major influence on the 

aircraft performance. The most important factor to consider is the power required for all 

mission phases and the energy consumption during the mission as a whole. Finding a 

combination of electric motor and propeller that matches a particular airplane and its desired 

performance is complex if done in an exact manner. The chosen motor is Hyperion ZS 3025-

10 with a 13”x8” propeller. 

5.2 Electric Configuration 

 

5.2.1 Solar Panel- Charge Controller (Genasun GV-10) 

Since the brigther the sunlight, the more voltage the solar cells produce, the excessive 

voltage could damage the batteries. A charge controller is used to maintain the proper 

charging voltage on the batteries. An American wire gauge conductor (AGW) is used to 

connect the components of the solar energy system, ensuring low loss of energy and 

preventing overheating. The AWG is a standardized wire gauge system for the diameters of 

round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. The larger the AWG number or wire 

gauge, the smaller the physical size of the wire. The smallest AWG size is 40 and the largest 

is 0000. Since the maximum current ouput from the solar panel is 6A the AGW 20 was first 

chosen but due to its overheating and power losses a second choice led to AGW 12 with a 

length of 40 cm. 

 

It can be observed in Figure 5.4 that the solar panels are connected to the input terminals 

of the charge controller, positive solar panel with positive charge controller and negative 

solar panel with negative charge controller.  

 



 

33 

 

 
 

Figure 5.4- Solar Panel connect to the Charge controller 25. 

 
5.2.2 Charge Controller-Battery 

After connecting the solar panels to the input terminals of the charge controller, the same 

size wire can be used to connect the charge controller output to the batteries since these 

wires will carry no more current than the solar panel wires. The charge controller self 

protection feature will prevent damage from reverse polarity connections, but the charge 

controller will not function until the battery is connected properly (positive battery wire with 

positive charger controller and negative battery wire with negative charge controller). 

 

 
 

Figure 5.5- Charge controller connect with battery 25.   



34 

 

5.2.3 Battery-Motor 

Once the battery is properly connected to the charge controller ouput terminals we must 

attach a battery connector, connect the motor to the ESC and, finally, the ESC to the 

receiver, performing the following steps:  

1. Battery connector  

 

A battery connector will be attached (XT60 connectors) to the red 

(+) and black (-) power wires and then the battery connectorwill be 

soldered to the wires ensuring that the polarity is correct (red wire 

to battery red wire, black wire to battery black wire).  

 

2. Connecting  Motor to ESC 

 

Regarding the Motor-ESC connection it is necessary to solder the 

corresponding connectors (bullet connectors) for the motor to the 

wires coming from the ESC. It is important to ensure that the soldered 

joint is solid since poor soldering is a commom cause of failure. 

 

3. Connecting ESC to Receiver  

 

The receiver lead (the brown/red/orange wires with a black plastic connector on the 

end) is connected to the throttle channel on the receiver. 

 

5.3 Installation of the Solar Arrays on the Wing   

With the solar cells being a critical part of the aircraft, their position has to be correctly 

planned to preserve the UAV balance, both on the ground and during flight. Since its fuselage 

is very thin and the four panel modules cover an area of around 0.72 m 2 the need to place 

the solar cells on the UAV wing is clear. Since the aircraft has to be small enough to deplete 

from small landing fields and be easily transported, the wing was divided in three parts, as 

seen in Figure 5.7.  

Figure 5.6- Battery- Motor connection 26.

Figure 5.7- Solar modules integration view on the wing. 

 

Module (a) and (c) are covered with a solar array of ten solar cells each one, and module (b) 

with two sets of twelve solar cells connected in series. The system consists of 44 solar cells 

with 544.4 g of mass wired in series (JST connecters from (a) to (b) and from (b) to (c)). On 

module (b), the wiring between the two sets is completed using a bullet and a XT30 connecter 

to enable the connection whithin the solar array, the charge controller and the battery as can 

be seen in Figure 5.9.   

 

Figure 5.8- Module (a) and (b) wired with a JST connecter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 5.9- Module (b) wired with a bullet and a XT30 connecter.  



36 

 

 
 

 

In these conditions, the solar UAV can accomplish a sustained flight of full eight hours during 

the summer months, being the battery recharged during flight. During the night time the 

system will be only powered by the battery. The system energy generation is compound by 

the solar module which is connected to the charge controller referred in section 5.2.1. The 

propulsion system consists of the Hyperion ZS 3025-10 electric motor powering a 

13”x8” propeller and controlled by a Castle Creations Phoenix Edge ESC.   

 Regarding the attachement on the wing, placing the solar cells flushed with the wing’s upper 

surface enclosed by an anti-reflective coating on top offers multiple advantages, although, in 

the first instance it was decided to place them on the top of the wing upper surface for 

simplicity.The solar panels are directly attached with adhesive tape onto the shrink film that 

covers the whole wing, with a reinforcement on the ribs and trailing edge area.The four solar 

modules arrangement are shown in Figure 5.11.

Solar Arrays Experiments  

This chapter aims to report the solar cells experiments that were carried out to measure the 

efficiency and compare with that given by the manufacturer of the selected photovoltaic solar 

cells. To validate the system the typical I-V curve was first built and then the efficiency was 

calculated using a variable load and a pyranomter.These steps are described in the following 

sections.  

6.1. Pyranometer  

A pyranometer is a device for measuring solar radiation on a normally flat surface. 

Measurement of solar radiation per unit surface area (W/m2) is termed irradiance. Irradiance 

measurement requires, by definition, that the pyranometer’s sensor response to radiation 

varies with the cosine of the angle of incidence from a line vertical to the surface of the 

sensor. The pyranometer used is the SP-215 Apogee, which means we can amplify the signal 

with a power source of no more than 24 VDC. According to the SP 215 Apogee manual 27 “ 

Apogee Instruments SP series pyranometres consist of a cast acrylic  diffuser, photodiode, and 

signal processing circuitry mounted in an anodized aluminum housing, and a cable to connect 

the  sensor to a measurement device. Sensors are potted solid with no internal air space and 

are designed for continuous total shortwave radiation measurement on a planar surface in 

outdoor environments. SP series sensors ouput an analog voltage that is directly proportional 

to toal shortwave radiation from the sun. The voltage signal from the sensor is directly 

proportional to radiation incident on a planar surface (does not have to be horizontal), where 

the radiation emanates from all angles of a hemisphere.”  

6.1.1 Operation and Measurement 

It is necessary to connect the sensor to a measurement device capable of measuring and 

displaying a voltage signal. In order to maximize measurement resolution and signal to 

noise ratio, the input range of the measurement device should closely match the ouput 

range of the pyranometer. It is also required to power the sensor with a DC voltage by 

connecting the positive signal to the white wire from the sensor and the negative or 

common to the clear wire from the sensor and to use a voltemer to measure across the 

green wire ouput signal and the clear wire.  All apogee pyranometer models have a 

standart calibration curve 27.In this case the equation of calibration is: 



38 

 

 

 

 6.2 Solar Power Measurements 

The solar experiments were conducted with a solar array of ten solar cells wired in series 

attached to the central module of the wing. In order to understand the behavior of the solar 

panel, a variable load is used. To simulate the electrical consumption of the motor, the choice 

led to three rheostats (connected in series) wired to a power meter and the solar array. Also, 

to help calculate the efficiency of the solar array, a pyranometer was used as mentioned 

previously. These experiments took place in Covihã during the summer months. 

6.2.1 Solar irradiance measurement  

Since the pyranometer used to measure the irradiation from the sun was internally 

amplified, a power source of no more than 24 VDC was required. At first, the power 

supply was a voltage source of 5 V connected to a bench multimeter but, in order to 

minimize the power losses, the power source went from a voltage source to a 2S LiPo 

battery connected to a multimeter with JST connectors, as shown in Figure 6.1.

6.2.2 Typical I-V Efficiency Curve 

The I-V (Current-Voltage) curve of a PV module describes its energy conversion capability 

at the existing conditions of irradiance and temperature. Conceptually, the curve 

represents the combination of current and voltage at which the PV module could be 

operated, if the irradiance and cell temperature could be held constant. Figure 6.2 shows 

different efficiency curves. The span of the I-Vcurve ranges from the short circuit current 

at zero volts, to zero current at the open circuit voltage. At both points the power 

generated is zero. ???  occurs when the ouput current of the cell is zero, I=0 and the 

shunt resistance ??? is neglected. The short circuit,??? ,is the current at V=0 and is 

approximately equal to the light generated current. At the ‘knee’ of a normal I-V curve 

is the maximum electrical power point (???? ,????  ), the point at which the array 

generates maximum electrical power.  

 

 

Figure 6.2- Efficiency I-V Curve at different Irradiance values. 

In order to build the typical I-V efficiency curve three variable loads were used to 

simulate the motor electrical consumption and find the ??? , maximum power point and 

???  values. When comparing these results with the typical I-V curve of Sunpower C60 

datasheet the similarity is clear. Because the testing conditions are not as ideal as in the 

laboratory, average temperature of 36ºC at ground level and non-controlled irradiance 

values, the obtained results are not as bright as shown in the datasheet. It is clear that

the irradiation is different throughout the day which means the irradiation at the 

beginning of the test is different from the irradiation at the end. The other reason for 

the difference between the curves is the fact that the manufacturer’s curves were 

obtained at a controlled environment with STC conditions and these tests were 

conducted with the cell being heated by the sun making the solar array less efficient 

(detailed study in section 6.4).  

6.2.3 MPPT working method 

As previously explained, MPPT alghoritms are necessary in PV applications because the 

maximum power point of a solar panel varies with irradiance and temperature, so the 

use of a charge controller with MPPT techonology is required in order to obtain the 

maximum power from the solar array.  

 

 
 

Figure 6.3- Power Output Evolution. 

Assuming the solar panel conditions are 25ºC at ground level 1000 W/m2 the entire solar 

system has a ????  of 25.6 V and an ???? of 5.93 A , ???? = 151.81 ?. Assuming that a 

12 V battery may generally have 12.2V, the battery would charge 5.93 ? × 12.2 ? =

72.35 ? which is significantly less than the maximum available output of the solar

module (???? = 151.81?). The MPPT charge controller boosts
(6) the voltage and the 

current of the voltage and current of the system close to the I-V curve maximum power 

point seen in Figure 6.3. Rather than simply connecting the module to the battery the 

MPPT system charge controller calculates the voltage at which the module is able to 

produce maximum power and forces the solar array to work always at the maximum 

power point.  

6.3 Effect of transparent film Covering on Efficiency 

A film covering study was conducted in order to understand the influence of the transparent 

film used to cover wings on the solar module efficiency. Solar array electrical parameters 

were recorded with and without the solar film covering the panel. The experimental test 

results are presented in Table 6.1.   

Table 6.1- Results of the film covering experiments. 
 

 

As it was expected, the solar cell covered with the film had their efficiency reduced but just 

slightly. There is an ouput loss ofaround 1% when covering the solar cells with the transparent

film. As it is clear from Table 6.1, this efficiency loss would not affect significantly the aircraft 

performance, although, these experiments were conducted for a very short period of time 

and the effect over a long-term could be worst when the solar module heats up.  

6.4 Effect of Temperature on Efficiency 

Temperature also affects the characteristics of solar cells. When it increases, the voltage 

decreases whereas the current increases insignificantly. Globally, the power that a solar cell 

can give is higher for lower panel temperatures, considering the same irradiance conditions. 

 

Figure 6.4- Variation of the current to voltage curve of a solar array with Irradiance and Temperature. 

The experiments were conducted on a non-controlled environment, where Datasheet STC 

conditions could not be replicated. The first setback was the irradiance from the Sun. Since 

solar conditions change throughout the day, the irradiance at the beginning of the test is 

different from the irradiance at the end. Therefore, several experiments were conducted and 

various I-V curves were extracted (Figure 6.4.). Two samples of an I-V curve at different 

temperatures are shown in Figure 6.5.

Figure 6.5- Two I-V curves at different temperatures. 

To gather data for this chart, a PV panel was placed on the central module of the wing. The 

first measurements were taken in ambient temperature conditions, and then they were taken 

again after the panel was cooled with a fan. It can be concluded that the efficiency slightly 

decreases from its reference amount while temperature of the cell increases. The array will 

be heated up to 75ºC in a day average temperature of 36ºC when the cell is exposed directly 

to the sun, which results in loss of efficiency. However, the air flowing over the wing without 

a cover film decreases the temperature about 20ºC in less than 10 minutes at the speed of 

2.8 m/s.Therefore, when the panel is at a higher temperature, a lower open circuit voltage 

is produced and the short circuit current increases insignificantly. The I-V curve with an 

irradiance value of 900 W/m2 has a maximum power ouput of 21.5 W and the I-V curve of 

800 W/m2 an ouput of 22 W. 

6.5 Solar angles-of-incidence  

6.5.1 The Axes of Flight 

Each axis of flight is an imaginary line around which an airplane can turn. Regardless of 

the type of aicraft, there are three axes upon which it can move: Left and Right, Forwards 

and Backwards, Up and Down. In aviation their technical names are lateral axis, 

longitudinal axis and vertical axis.

Figure 6.6- Aicraft Axes Flight illustration 28.   

According to NASA “The yaw axis is defined to be perpendicular to the plane of the wings 

with its origin at the center of gravity and directed towards the bottom of the aircraft. 

A yaw motion is a movement of the nose of the aircraft from side to side. The pitch axis 

is perpendicular to the yaw axis and is parallel to the plane of the wings with its origin 

at the center of gravity and directed towards the right wing tip. A pitch motion is an up 

or down movement of the nose of the aircraft. The roll axis is perpendicular to the other 

two axes with its origin at the center of gravity, and is directed towards the nose of the 

aircraft. A rolling motion is an up and down movement of the wing tips of the aircraft.”  

6.5.2 Azimuth Angle  

An azimuth is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. The vector from 

an observer to a point of interest is projected perperdiculary onto a reference plane; the 

angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is 

called the azimuth.Azimuth is ussaly measured in degrees.  Quite commonly, azimuths 

are stated in a system in which either north our south can be zero and the angle may be 

measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. In our case the reference plane is 

the North. 

6.5.3 Solar experiments 



 

45 

 

The change in the Azimuth angle during the day affects the power ouput of the PV 

module. One way to determine this would be to take measurements throught the day as 

the sun changed its angle relative to the panel module, but another way and easier to do 

is to roughly simulate the same effect by rotating the module in relation to the sun 

setting an initial position, in this case, north. While taking measurements it is important 

that irradiation readings be as constant as possible.To conduct these measurements the 

aircraft nose was placed towards North moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, firstly 

horizontal and then combined with different pitch and roll angles. The experiment profile 

can be summarized as:  

1. Location: Covilhã; 

2. Aircraft initial position: Nose facing North, 0º Azimuth; 

3. Irradiance values: Irradiance received at a ten solar cell module attached to a 

wing prototype central module; 

4. Date: Mid-August, 2015; 

5. Experiment duration: 14:30-16:00 

6. Ambient temperature: 36ºC 

 

The solar measurements started at 14:30 with an average temperature of 36 ºC. In these 

conditions the aircraft nose was placed facing north. At this time, the aircraft was facing 

the sun for this reason 0º azimuth has the highest power ouput value. All irradiance values 

taken during this experiment refer to irradiance receveid at the solar module (see Table 

6.2).

The experiment was conducted as quickly as possible, however the test still lasted 1 hour 

and 30 minutes, which means that the irradiance values were not as controlled as 

expected. Still, the values are consistent and it is possible to conclude that giving the 

airfoil curvature and position of the panels on the wing, according to Table 6.2, the north 

(0º azimuth) and south (180º azimuth) position are the most advantageous when it comes 

to enhace solar irradiance absorption, rising the available power ouput, Figure 6.7.These 

first measurements values refer to different angles of azimuth in relation to the sun with 

no influence of pitch and roll angles.  

 

 

 
Figure 6.7- Influence of different azimuth angles on irradiance and power ouput. 

As already refered, the first measurements were taken with the wing horizontal, not only 

to understand the azimuth effect on the power ouput but also to supply a base line when 

comparing these results to the influence of pitch and roll angles. The azimuth, pitch and 

roll angles are defined in the following graphis as A, P and R respectivelly. 

According to the chart shown in Figure 6.8, an average of 2 % power loss was observed 

when the wing was moved on a pitch angle between 10º to 20º. However the roll angle 

had an insignificant influence in 0º azimuth. On the other hand, when comparing the 

results obtained in for 45º azimuth, Figure 6.8,  there is an average of 3% power gain o 

when moving the wing on a pitch  of 10º to 20º and a decline of 1 % in roll.  This power 

ouput gain was expected since the irradiance from the sun arrives at a more 

perpendicular angle, reducing the losses from reflection. Regarding the 90º azimuth case, 

there is no major impact from a variation of pitch and roll. The most affected positions 

to a variation of picth and roll were 135º, 225º and 270º azimuth (Figures 6.9, 6.10, 6.11).

As the wing module suffers a variation of pitch from 10º to 20º the power ouput decreases 

40%, however the roll angle variation approaches the availabe power ouput from its 

azimuth’s original value.

The power incident on a PV module depends not only on the power contained in the 

sunlight, but also on the angle between the module and the Sun. Experiments show that 

the phovoltaic system exact azimuth orientation is not critical. Vertical axis and lateral 

axis, given by pitch and roll, have a more important effect on performance. When the 

absorbing surface and the sunlight are perpendicular to each oher, the power density on 

the surface is equal to that of sunlight. Concluding, between 0º and 180º Azimuth, 91 % 

of the maximum energy is available moving north-east at several pitch and roll angles. 

Moving towards south-west systems are silghtly less efficient but whithin accepted level. 

Data collected shows that there is a 15 % power loss when moving towards west increasing 

the diffuse radiation and lowering the available power. Since this propulsion system is 

not a fixed solar panel on a roof or on an airframe fixed at a given place, any efficiency 

loss in the power output can easily be minimized by encouraging flying the aircraft in a 

pattern favouring a better attitude towards the Sun. Of course small variations in these 

values are not all problematic. 

 

6.5.4 Loiter Pattern Simulation  

By simulating a loiter pattern, an average power ouput during a possible aircraft 

surveillance mission can be determined. This simulation was done using the data from 

the graphis in section 6.5.3 and considering certain time intervals at each selected 

attitude. The profile simulation was defined as a land observation flight 1000 m long with 

an average cruise speed of 7.5 m/s and an altitude of 1000 m.Considering an eight hour 

loiter with several full laps an taking into account the variation of the solar irradiance 

due to sun position, a full lap duration is reached by: 

 

? = ? × ? (6.1) 

 

where ? is the corresponding flight 1000 m long and ? is the average cruise speed having 

? as 133.3 seconds. Therefore, if one lap corresponds to 133.3 seconds then 28,800 

seconds (8 hour loiter) correspond to 216 laps. Considering that the perimeter of a 

circular turn is given by:  

 
 

? =
2 × ? × ?2

? × tan (?)
 

 

(6.2) 

 
 
 

Then a half turn with ? as 7.5 m/s and  ?  as 10º gives  ?=102.2 m and ?=13.64 s.  
 



 

51 

 

As it can be seen from Figure 6.14, two basic types of mission segments are modeled: 

two steady-level cruise legs with 53 seconds each one and two turns with 13.64 

seconds. 

 

 
Figure 6.14- Loiter pattern simulation. 

As already mentioned this simulation was done using the data from the graph shown 

in section 6.5.3 and assuming that radition emission from the sun remains constant 

for an hour, therefore, 8 different irradiance conditions were emulated. Notice that 

at the cruise speed of 7.5 m/s and 1000 m flight long, one hour corresponds to 27 laps 

and each turn has its characteristic average irradiance. Also, these experiements were 

conducted with a ten solar cell module, so, in order to obtain a power ouput from the 

complete solar array, it is necessary to convert the obtained available power value of 

a single solar cell and multiply it by 44 (44 solar cells wired in series). 

The average irradiance at 10:30 in Covilhã is around 800 W/m2 which gives an available 

power of 90 W. Until mid-day the irradiance values rises up to 1200 w/m2 remaining  

almost constant during 2 hours, delivering 109 W. The lowest irradiance corresponds 

to 600 W/m2, 60 W. So, taking into account that the MPPT’s efficiency is 98% as given 

by the manufacter22, the delivered average power output would be 93 W. Notice that 

the aircraft starts the loiter pattern facing north accomplished its first turn at second 

65 towards east and the second turn at second 130.3 towards west. These values 

presented at figure 6.14 are an average power ouput.

Mission Simulation 

In order to validate the solar propulsion system a misson simulation was performed. The 

complete propulsion and data acquisition system were transported to the University of Beira 

Interior’s wind tunnel where the take-off and cruise stage conditions could be replicated. 

Figure 7.1 ilustrates the wind tunnel used during the simulation.  

 

 

 
Figure 7.1 – University Beira Interior’s wind tunnel used during mission simulation.  

Firstly the Hyperion ZS 3020-10 motor and 13”x8” propeller were attached to a vertical 

balance arm inside the wind tunnel, Figure 7.2. Once the motor and propeller were properly 

attached, the ESC was connected to the battery and the battery to the charge controller 

chosen, Genasun GV-10. Between the battery and charge controller a power log was placed 

to read the ouput power from the solar panel. The misson conditions were controlled inside 

a control room, where the thrust setting was adjusted according to each stage of the misson 

as well as the aircraft speed. 

As already mentioned, a power log was placed between Genasun GV-10 and the 10,000 mAh 

LiPo battery to read the power output from the solar panel, as it is shown in Figure 7.3.  

  



 

53 

 

   

   

 

 

Finally, the solar panels were mounted on a wing prototype outside the wind tunnel, Figure 

7.4. The simulation took place in Covilhã during the summer months, namely, end of August 

from 14:30 to 18:00 with the wing facing east. Once the complete propulsion and data 

acquisition system were placed on the appropriate place, the mission simulation started.The 

motor was run at full throttle for approximately 10 minutes with an average speed of 6.5 m/s 

and then reduced to nearly 50 W at a flight cruise speed of 7.5 m/s. It is important to 

understand that the sustainable-flight of full eight hours was not possible to replicate because 

sunlight only shows between 13:00 to 18:00 at the wind tunnel site given a total of 5 hours of 

solar irradiance.

and Charge Controller.

During the climb phase observed in Figure 7.5 the electric power required is 411 W, below 

the expected. This is due to the mounting of the motor being inside of a wind tunnel and the 

conditions being considered ideal. The test began at 14:30 with a received solar irradiance of 

880 W/m2 which resulted in 90 W of solar panel power. It can be observed in Figure 7.5 that 

the power required during the climb phase is higher than the available power from the solar 

module. Therefore, the remaining required power will come from the battery, thus 

discharging it. On the other hand, during the cruise phase the power supplied by the solar 

array is higher than the power required by the motor, thus the excess power will charge the 

battery. These experiments were conducted in a place surrounded by mountains, therefore, 

the sun starts to disappear earlier and sunlight decreases abruptly, for this reason at minute 

117 there is a significant drop in the power ouput from the solar module.  

 

 
 

Figure 7.5 – Electric power required and supplied during mission simulation. 

Using the Power curves in Figure 7.5 and the trapezoidal rule, the energy consumed during 

the climb phase, between minute 2 and 12, was calculated to be 189 kJ. It can be seen from 

Figure 7.6 that the consumed energy during climb corresponds to the energy peak existing in 

the graph being the total required energy and supplied energy 1174.10 kJ and 1249 kJ, 

respectively.  

The batteries have a capacity of 10,000 mAh (432 kJ). During the climb phase the propulsion 

sub-system consumed 63 % of the available energy (6275.6 mAh, 259 kJ), without the solar 

input the remaining energy, at an average cruise power of 50W, would last for around 30 

minutes.

Although the simulation only lasted for 5 hours this does not mean that the sustainable flight 

of full eight hours plus climb is not possible. Using the irradiance values obtained over the 

last experiments conducted, a graph with the corresponding power ouput was built (Figure 

7.7).

sunlight. Experiments conducted shows that the average irradiance at 10:30 in Covilhã is 

around 800 W/m2 with 90 W at an ambient temperature of 35ºC (Figure 7.7). Until mid day 

the irradiance value rises up to 1025 W/m2 meaning a power ouput of 111 W. If the climb 

phase consumes around 6,500 mAh, previously seen from the mission simulation, and with an 

average charge current of 2 A (solar array delivering 6 A and motor consuming 4 A) the battery 

will be fully charged in approximately 2 hours. Assuming ambient conditions are ideal, the 

motor will use direct energy from the solar module during 5 hours. Averaging 1 hour and a 

half power coming from the battery the mission could last for around 8 hours and a half.

8.1 Conclusion 

The purpose of this master thesis was to design a solar propulsion system for a long endurance 

electric UAV enabling a sustainable-flight of 8 hours during the Spring or Autumn equinox. 

Through this dissertation the mission was described along with detailed information about the 

energy requirements. Since this propulsion system is aimed at the use of green power 

technologies, the best option was focused on the use of high efficiency solar cells attached 

on the upper wing surface. The electric propulsion system is compound by the energy 

generation and storage systems, the solar module connected to the charge controller and a 

LiPo battery, respectivelly. The propulsion system consists on the Hyperion ZS 3025-10 electric 

motor driving a 13”x8”propeller and controlled by Castle Creations Phoenix Edge ESC. To 

verify the validity of this system, several tests were carried out.  

To understand the power output from the solar module, the first step was to verify the 

efficiency I-V curves given by the Sunpower C60 manufacturer. To accomplish that, three 

variable loads and a pyranometer were used to measure the irradiance. Once the experiments 

were conducted and reviewed, it could be seen that the results obtained were very similar to 

the supplied manufacturer information. The only differences between these results were the 

non controlled environment of these performed experiments. The next step was to test the 

solar module efficiency loss due to solar cell temperature. As it was expect the solar power 

ouput is higher when solar cells are in a colder environment. Air flow through the wing during 

flight would decrease solar cell temperature resulting in a power ouput gain.  

The power incident on a PV module depends not only on the power contained in the sunlight, 

but also on the angle between the module and the Sun, for this reason, some experiments to 

understand the contribution of azimuth, pitch and roll on power output were conducted. 

Experiments show that the phovoltaic system exact azimuth orientation is not critical. 

Vertical axis and lateral axis, given by pitch and roll, have a more important effect on 

performance.  

Once the solar module behavior was understood throught different temperatures and 

irradiance values, a mission simulation was performed where the complete propulsion system 

and acquistion data system were installed in a wind tunnel. There were limitations at first 

since sunlight only strikes for 5 hours on the wind tunnel. However, the solar UAV 

accomplished his purpose with success, exhibiting sustainable flight of 5 hours. Despite the 

simulation only lasted for 5 hours this does not mean the full eigh hour sustainable flight can 

not be accomplished. When the power required by the motor is higher than the power supplied 

by the PV module the lacking power will come from the battery, thus discharging it. On the 



 

59 

 

other hand, during cruise the power supplied by the solar array is higher than the power 

required by the motor and the excess will charge the battery. 

Although some limitations were found, this master thesis objectives were successfully 

achieved. 

Concluding, important parameters which influence the ouput power and efficiency of PV cells 

should be taken into consideration for achievieng the desired performance in a solar-powered 

aircraft. Also, the type of covering and mounting of the cells affects the direct incident solar 

radiation, the amount of heat transfer on the wings and the ouput power. Due to air flow, 

temperature of the cells decreases during the flight and causes increased in efficiency. So 

this would be a significant factor while designing the aircraft, selecting the cells and covering 

the wings. Futhermore, this influences the weight, price and flight-endurance. 

 

8.2 Future Work 

In the future, a better and more accurate technique for placing the solar cells inside the wings 

will be studied.

Czochralski process – “is a technique for growing crystals in order to obtain solitary crystals 

of semiconductors like silicon, metals like silver and gold as well as several salts. The process 

is named after Jan Czochralski, who first demonstrated it in 1916. He was studying the rates 

of crystallisation of different metals. The most significant application of the Czochralski 

process is the growth of large ingots of single crystal silicon. Initially highly pure 

semiconductor-grade silicon is subjected to high temperatures in a crucible made of quartz 

until it melts. Quartz is used as the crucible’s material because of its inertness. At this stage, 

doping can be initiated with impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus being added to the 

molten silicon. Fixed amounts of dopants can yield desired characteristics in the 

semiconductor formed as a result of this procedure.”
