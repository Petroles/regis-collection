Acknowledgments

This doctoral thesis has been accomplished at the Departamento de Mecânica Computacio-
nal (DMC) of the Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica (FEM) of the Universidade Estadual de
Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil, and at the Laboratoire d’Acoustique de l’Université du Maine
(LAUM),France, under the frame of a co-tutelage agreement between these universities, and with
the financial and infra-structural support from the Brazilian funding agency CAPES, from LAUM,
and from UNICAMP, to which I am deeply grateful. I would like to thank M. Yves Aurégan, Re-
search Director CNRS, and M. Joël Gilbert, Director of LAUM, for being welcome during the two
years period that I lived in Le Mans as a Ph.D. Student.

Writing this "Acknowledgments"essay is not a simple task. To accomplish this doctorate I depended
on so many people, in so particularly different ways, that I can be sure that I will be unfair in my
following words. But what I am indeed sure of is that I will do my best. What those forgotten or
insufficiently acknowledged people can be sure of is that, even though not fairly mentioned here,
they are imprinted in my heart.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors Pierrick Lotton, Research
Director at LAUM, José Roberto de França Arruda, Professor at DMC/UNICAMP, and Guillaume
Penelet, Maître de Conférence at LAUM, for their supervision, support, and guidance along these
years either in Brazil or in France - the whole period, from both countries. They have taught me
how to pursuit a scientific investigation, how to deal with the risks of failure in this process, and
how to publish its results. With and because of them, I could live a discovery experience - which is
always priceless no matter how modest it is. That I will carry for life. I am also grateful for their
interest, efforts, and full commitment to carry on the non-trivial administrative tasks involved in the
co-tutelage agreement, besides the arrangements for my moving to and staying in France. And we
still had time to have some beers.

I would like to thank Jean-Pierre Dalmont, Professor at LAUM, for his strong support in dealing
with the acoustic impedance sensor. I used to just appear at his office and knock at his door - no
appointments at all - and he was always available for discussion. We had a number of meetings,
for months, and his technical advices were crucial to properly operate the sensor and to understand
important aspects concerning impedance measurements.

I would like to give special thanks to David Lee Gardner, Senior Research Fellow at Los Alamos
National Laboratory/USA, for coming to my defense in Brazil as member of both Brazilian and
French juries (rapporteur). He spent his own money to rush his VISA permit specifically to come
to my defense. It was a great pleasure welcoming him, and also a privilege. Hopefully I can make
good use of his scientific and life experience advices.

I would also like to thank all members of the Thermoacoustic Group of LAUM, Pierrick Lotton,
Guillaume Penelet, Gaëlle Poignand (Research Engineer), and Matthieu Guedra (Ph.D. Student).
Our weekly meetings were very productive, as we could regularly share our work and discuss
solutions to advance in our research. Those meetings were inestimable opportunities to learn from
each other.

Technical support was by all means crucial for my acoustic measurements, which consisted in a
very important feature of my thesis work at LAUM. I express my sincere gratitude to all technicians
with whom I had contact, because all of them were absolutely precise and efficient - and kind.
Without them, I could not have done nothing.

Documents, bureaucracy and paperwork in general are not simple for all doctorates. However, in
my particular case, the co-tutelage context added some issues, and they were not just a few. So I
depended on many secretaries, either in Brazil or in France. As the French period of two years was
in the middle of my doctorate, two changes of university/country had to be dealt with. Lucky me,
all services were effective. I thank them all, in particular Carlos Della Betta.

Still in the beginning of my doctorate, in Brazil, I had the opportunity to learn from hard disciplines,
from exigent professors. Their exigence, nevertheless, was balanced with their strong enthusiasm
to teach. So my gratitude is extended to those professors, who taught me that these two features
favor one another as part of an effective learning.

I am grateful to all my friends, among them many climbers with whom I had the opportunity to
share trust on belay. And when I think about them, I always remember of my rock-climbing group
GEEU - Grupo de Escalada Esportiva e Montanhismo da Unicamp.

I wish to give special thanks to my close friends Arthur de Miranda Neto, Matthew Alban Boucher,
Frederico Theotonio, and Véronique Bour.

I owe my family much more than I can imagine. I owe my parents much more than my own
existence. They gave me everything they could since I was born. Along these doctorate years, my
father spared no effort to help me whenever I needed. For two years he was my support from the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

At last, my other half.
My wife.
She was there all the time for me. She always is.
I thank my wife for her unconditional support, for her unconditional love.

Os dias que estes homens passam nas montanhas são os dias em que
realmente vivem. Quando a mente se limpa das teias de aranha e o sangue
corre com força pelas veias. Quando os cinco sentidos recobram a vitalidade
e o homem completo se torna mais sensível, e então já pode ouvir as vozes da
natureza, e ver as belezas que só estão ao alcance dos mais ousados.

Reinhold Messner

Les jours que ces hommes passent dans les montagnes sont des jours durant
lesquels ils vivent réellement. Quand l’esprit se lave des toiles d’araignées et
que le sang coule avec force dans les veines. Quand les cinq sens retrouvent
leur vitalité et que l’homme entier devient plus sensible, il peut alors écouter
les voix de la nature et voir les beautés à portée des plus audacieux.

Reinhold Messner

The days that these men are in the mountains are the days when they actually
live. When the mind is clean of cobwebs and blood runs strongly through the
veins. When the five senses regain vitality and the complete man becomes
more sensitive, so he can listen to the voices of nature, and see the beauties
that are only within the reach of the boldest.

(Doutorado). Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas.

O projeto de um motor termoacústico (TA) se torna viabilizado à medida da confiabilidade
de sua previsão de desempenho. Uma tentativa para o êxito nessa previsão vem do conhecimento
da matriz de transferência do núcleo termoacústico (NTA), que pode ser explorada em modelos
analíticos para o motor considerado. A matriz de transferência por si só pode ser obtida ou por
modelagem analítica ou medições acústicas. As últimas, no entanto, consistem em uma opção
interessante para se evitar considerações termo-físicas ou geométricas de estruturas complexas,
uma vez que o NTA é tratado como uma caixa preta. No entanto, antes de se prosseguir com a
abordagem experimental, uma solução analítica é apresentada, apenas para fins de comparação,
mas que contempla somente os casos de materiais de geometria simples, tal como um catalisador
de cerâmica, por exemplo. Em relação à abordagem experimental, três diferentes métodos são
apresentados. Um método clássico de duas cargas é aplicado em duas configurações distintas e,
além disso, um método alternativo com base em medições de impedância é aqui desenvolvido e
aplicado. Uma comparação entre estas três abordagens é realizada por meio de uma avaliação de
performance experimental e também por uma análise de sensibilidade, de modo a se conhecer as
perspectivas de viabilidade de cada método. Quatro diferentes materiais são testados, cada um
sendo usado como o elemento poroso colocado no interior do NTA, que é por sua vez submetido
a diferentes regimes de gradiente de temperatura. Estes materiais são escolhidos de tal maneira a
cobrir uma vasta gama de porosidades compreendidas entre esperados stack puro e regenerador
puro. O método alternativo foi bem sucedido no seu objectivo para todos os materiais, ao contrário
do método clássico de duas cargas. Desta forma, as matrizes de transferência medidas são aplicadas
em uma modelagem dedicada a prever tanto a frequência operacional como o ganho de amplifica-
ção TA intrínseca. Tais parâmetros são otimizados em simulações para dois modelos de motores
TA básicos, um de onda estacionária e outro progressiva, variando-se parâmetros geométricos
dos componentes anexos ao NTA. Uma análise comparativa mostra em que condições o limiar
TA é esperado ou não para cada material, e também revela as limitações do aparato experimental
no que se refere às dimensões adequadas para melhor se ajustarem às investigações de desempenho.

Abstract

BANNWART, Flávio de Campos. Methods for the transfer matrix evaluation of thermoacoustic
cores with application to the design of thermoacoustic engines. 2014. 149p. Thesis (Doctorate).
Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas.

The design of a thermoacoustic (TA) engine is improved towards the reliability of its
performance prediction. An attempt to succeed in this prediction comes from the knowledge of
the TA core (TAC) transfer matrix, which can be exploited in analytical models for the given
engine. The transfer (T) matrix itself may be obtained either by analytical modeling or acoustic
measurements. The latter consist in an interesting option to avoid thermo-physical or geometrical
considerations of complex structures, as the TAC is treated as a black box. However, before
proceeding with the experimental approach, an analytical solution is presented for comparison
purposes, but it contemplates only cases of materials of simple geometry such as a ceramic
catalyst. Concerning the experimental approach, three different methods are put forward. A
classical two-load method is applied in two different configurations and an alternative method
based on impedance measurements is here developed and applied. A comparison between these
approaches is evaluated by means of a sensitivity analysis, in order to investigate the feasibility
of each method in further explorations. Four different materials are tested, each one playing the
porous element allotted inside the TAC, which is in its turn submitted to several different regimes
of steady state temperature gradient. These materials are chosen in such a way as to cover the wide
range of porosities comprised between expected pure stack and pure regenerator. The alternative
method succeeds on its purpose for all materials, contrarily to the classical two-load method. In this
manner, the measured transfer matrices are applied into a proper modeling devoted to predict both
the operating frequency and the intrinsic TA amplification gain. Such parameters are optimized
for two basic TA engine models, either standing or traveling-wave configuration, by searching for
the corresponding geometrical parameters of the TAC surrounding components. A comparative
analysis shows in what conditions the TA threshold is expected or not for each material, but it also
reveals the limitations of the experimental apparatus in what concerns the appropriate dimensions
to better fit the performance investigations.

Résumé

BANNWART, Flávio de Campos. Méthodes d’évaluation de la matrice de transfert des noyaux
thermoacoustiques avec application à la conception de moteurs thermoacoustiques. 2014. 149p.
Thèse (Doctorat). Faculdade de Engenharia Mecânica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Cam-
pinas.

La conception d’un moteur thermoacoustique dépend de façon critique de la fiabilité des
outils de prédiction théorique de ses performances. Une tentative pour réussir cette prédiction con-
siste à exploiter les coefficients de la matrice de transfert du noyau thermoacoustique (NTA) dans
les modèles analytiques du moteur considéré. La matrice de transfert elle-même peut être obtenue
soit par modélisation analytique, soit par des mesures acoustiques. Ce dernier cas, cependant, se
présente comme une option intéressante pour éviter d’avoir à considérer la complexité des éléments
constitutifs du NTA, tant sur le plan de leur géométrie que des transferts thermiques qui y pren-
nent place; le NTA est alors traité comme une boîte noire. La méthode analytique est tout d’abord
présentée; elle ne vise que les cas de matériaux à géométrie simple comme, par exemple, un cataly-
seur en céramique. En ce qui concerne l’approche expérimentale, trois procédures sont proposées.
Une méthode classique à deux charges est appliquée dans deux configurations différentes et, en
outre, une méthode alternative basée sur des mesures d’impédance est développée ici et appliquée
également. Une comparaison entre ces deux approches est évaluée au moyen d’une analyse de sen-
sibilité, afin de se rendre compte de la faisabilité de chaque méthode pour d’autres exploitations.
Quatre matériaux différents sont testés, chacun jouant le rôle de l’élément poreux à l’intérieur du
NTA utilisé ; ils sont choisis de manière à couvrir un large éventail de porosités comprises entre le
pur stack et le pur régénérateur. Le NTA, à son tour, est soumis à plusieurs gradients de température
en régime permanent. La méthode basée sur des mesures d’impédances s’avère performante pour
tous les matériaux, contrairement à la méthode classique à deux charges. Les matrices de transfert
mesurées sont utilisées dans des modèles dédiés à prédire à la fois la fréquence de fonctionnement
et le gain d’amplification thermoacoustique intrinsèque d’une machine thermoacoustique équipée
du NTA caractérisé au préalable. Ces paramètres sont optimisés pour deux modèles basiques de mo-
teur thermoacoustique, que ce soit en configuration à onde stationnaire ou progressive, en faisant
varier les paramètres géométriques des composants entourant le NTA. Une analyse comparative
montre dans quelles conditions le seuil de déclenchement thermoacoustique est prévu ou non pour
chaque matériau, mais elle révèle aussi les limites de l’appareil expérimental en ce qui concerne
les dimensions appropriées pour mieux répondre aux estimations de performances.

Mots-clé: Thermoacoustique, Acoustique, Impédance Acoustique, Matériau poreux, Résonance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Thermoacoustic machines belong to the family of cyclic thermodynamic machines that ex-
change heat and work with their environment. Like any thermodynamic machine, they have two
operating modes depending on the direction of energy exchange: the engine mode for which the
system uses the heat transfer from a hot source to a cold source to produce acoustic work and the
heat-pump mode for which the system uses the acoustic energy produced by an external source
to extract heat from a cold reservoir. The thermoacoustic effect on which the operation of these
engines is based comes from the interaction between acoustic oscillations in a fluid and a tempera-
ture gradient imposed along the walls of a porous material (usually called "stack" or "regenerator",
depending on whether the heat contact is quasi-adiabatic or quasi-isothermal).

The development of efficient thermoacoustic engines is largely due to the work carried out
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA), including the development of the software Delta-E
(Ward, 1994) (then Delta-EC (Ward et al., 2008)). Delta-EC is a robust tool dedicated to the design
of thermoacoustic systems and remains the most widely used tool to date. However, although it
is suitable for calculating the performance of thermoacoustic machines, Delta-EC has some short-
comings implicitly related to the theory on which it is based. First, Delta-EC is based on a one-
dimensional approach of the thermoacoustic effects and therefore does not take into account any
variation in transverse fields, which can play a significant role in the amplification process of the
wave. Moreover the modeling of thermoacoustic instability is described in steady state and ignores
the transient regime which may contain important information about the non-linear processes re-
sponsible for saturation (Swift, 1992; Yu et al., 2003; Penelet et al., 2002). Finally, Delta-EC is
based on the linear theory of thermoacoustics (Rott, 1980; Swift, 1988) and the only saturating
processes taken into account are the acoustically induced heat flux and singular head losses at the
edges of the stack. These limitations require the development of tools to describe what Delta-EC
can not predict and lead to the following questions: what theoretical approach can be adopted for
the description of the thermoacoustic amplification from the onset until the saturation amplitude?
What methods can be used to avoid uni-dimensional considerations and simplifying assumptions
regarding the distribution of temperature, the presence of heat exchangers or the thermophysical
properties of regenerators?

In response to the last question, the Laboratoire d’Acoustique de l’Université du Maine
(LAUM) has recently launched work on the theoretical description and the design of thermoa-

1



coustic engines, using the formalism of transfer matrices. In this context, the thermoacoustic core
(TAC) is considered as a black box and its transfer matrix is obtained experimentally (Guedra et al.,
2011). The TAC is the element of a thermoacoustic engine in which the temperature field is het-
erogeneous. It is divided into an “active” and a “passive” part (Fig 1.1). The “active” part consists
of an open cell porous material (stack or regenerator) equipped with a hot (HHX) and an ambient
(AHX) heat exchangers at its ends. These heat exchangers are used to maintain a steep temperature
gradient, which is responsible for the onset of large amplitude acoustic waves oscillating at the
frequency of the most unstable acoustic mode of the complete device. The “passive” part is the
so-called thermal buffer tube (TBT), which refers to the waveguide region between the HHX and a
secondary AHX. The TAC is generally surrounded by an acoustical network to compose a resonant
device in which a mechanical (acoustic) power is produced by thermoacoustic energy conversion.
This acoustic power can then be supplied to an acoustic load, e.g. an electrodynamic alternator, as
illustrated in Fig. 1.1.

Even below the threshold of thermoacoustic instability, the theoretical description of acoustic
propagation and heat transfer through the thermoacoustic core (TAC) is anything but simple. This is
essentially due to the fact that thermoacoustic engines make use of geometrically complicated ma-
terials (piles of stainless meshes, metallic foams) whose thermophysical parameters are unknown.
Moreover, the accuracy of the description of acoustic propagation through the TAC also depends
critically on the shape of the temperature field within the TAC, the latter being very difficult to
describe theoretically. Therefore, alternative methods allowing the description of the TAC shall be
developed. In a previous study carried out in LAUM, a stack-based TAC has been characterized ex-
perimentally. Guedra et al. (2011) performed the measurement of the transfer matrices of a heated
TAC by means of a classical "two load - four microphone" method (Boden, 1986). These transfer
matrices were then introduced into an analytical model which predicts the onset of self-sustained
oscillations in a thermoacoustic device. Experimental data obtained from a stack made up of a 600
cells per square inch (cpsi) ceramic catalyst have been introduced in the model and theoretical pre-
dictions of the onset conditions were consistent with those actually observed in different engines
equipped with this TAC. However, in the frame of this previous work, the method developed by
Guedra et al. has not been tested to describe the behaviour of a heated regenerator-based TAC.

Therefore, the aim of this thesis is twofold. First, in the continuation of the works by Guedra et
al., it is to investigate alternative methods for the experimental characterization of a TAC, allowing
accurate description of both stack-based and regenerator-based TAC made of different materials
besides the Ceramic Catalyst 600 cpsi, such as a Reticulated Vitreous Carbon Foam, a Nichrome

2



Foam, and a Pile of Stainless Steel Grids. Second, it is to introduce the experimental data obtained
from these alternative methods into an analytical modeling for the optimal design of different kinds
of thermoacoustic engines, and the estimation of the onset of self-sustained oscillations.

After a brief history of thermoacoustics given in Chapter 1, the theoretical basis of thermoa-
coustics are recalled in Chapter 2. In particular, characteristic equations of thermoacoustic devices
are derived using the formalism of the transfer matrices. The solution of such equation allows the
description of the onset of self-sustained oscillations in a thermoacoustic engine (in terms of work-
ing frequency and amplification rate (Guedra et al., 2011)). This theoretical method requires the
knowledge of the transfer matrix of the TAC. Different experimental procedures to measure the co-
efficients of the transfer matrix (including the procedure developed by Guedra et al.) are presented
and evaluated in Chapter 3. Finally, using the knowledge of the transfer matrices of different TAC
tested in Chapter 3, the design of several thermoacoustic systems is discussed in Chapter 4.

1.1 Literature review and historical context

Thermoacoustic wave generators (or engines) are made of acoustic resonators in which the
interaction between acoustic and thermal oscillations in the vicinity of solid walls subjected to a
high temperature gradient produces a conversion of thermal energy into acoustic energy. This ther-
moacoustic process aroused the interest of the scientific community of the late XVIIIth century
when Byron Higgins succeeded in creating acoustic oscillations in a tube with a flame judiciously
placed on the wall of a resonator (Higgins, 1802). Other types of this kind of devices have been
realized in the late XIXth century since the Sondhauss tube (Sondhauss, 1850) or the Rijke’s tube
(Rijke, 1859). A first theory of thermoacoustic interaction (between acoustic and thermal fields)
was given in 1868 by Kirschhoff, who introduced the conduction of heat in the theory of sound
propagation. Based on this work, a first qualitative interpretation of the Sondhauss tube was given
by Lord Rayleigh in 1896 (Strutt, 1945). In this work, Rayleigh specially emphasizes that the acous-
tical temperature oscillations of a fluid particle located near a wall subjected to a high temperature
gradient must necessarily be phase-shifted with respect to the particle displacement, so that the
thermoacoustic amplification process occurs. In his original words:

"In almost all cases where heat is communicated to a body expansion ensues, and this expan-

sion may be made to do mechanical work. If the phases of the forces thus operative be favorable, a

vibration may be maintained ... . For the sake of simplicity, a tube, hot at the closed end and getting

gradually cooler towards the open end, may be considered. At a quarter of period before the phase

of greatest condensation ... the air is moving inwards, i.e. towards the closed end, and therefore is

passing from colder to hotter parts of the tube; ... but in fact the adjustment of temperature takes

time, and thus the temperature of the air deviates from that of the neighboring parts of the tube,

inclining towards the temperature of that part of the tube from which the air has just come. From

this it follows that at the phase of greatest condensation heat is received by the air, and at the

phase of greatest rarefaction heat is given up from it, and thus there is a tendency to maintain the

vibrations."

In the 1960s, an important step was taken by Carter et al. (1962), who devised an "optimized"
Sondhauss tube by adding a stack of plates (stacks) in the resonator, thereby significantly increasing
the machine efficacy and efficiency. This device, schematically represented in Fig. 1.2, belongs to
the class of standing-wave thermoacoustic engine. In this system, when the temperature gradient
along the stack of plates reaches the instability threshold, self-sustained acoustic oscillations of high

4



amplitude (about 1 to 10 percent of the static pressure) take place in the resonator at the frequency
of the most unstable mode, which usually is, in a first approximation, the longitudinal half-wave
mode.

Figure 1.2: Scheme of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine with closed extremities and a repre-
sentative example of a non-uniform temperature profile along its longitudinal axis.

Based on Carter’s work, many studies have been carried out ever since, and several proto-
types of thermoacoustic engines have been realized. From 1970 to 1990, Rott (1969, 1973, 1980)
established the theoretical foundations of thermoacoustics and provided an analytical model of the
instability caused by the thermoacoustic interaction in the tubes of Taconis and Sondhauss. The ex-
perimental work of Yazaki et al. (1980a,b) qualitatively confirmed the validity of the theory of Rott.
Since the early 1980s, research in thermoacoustic intensifies, notably through the work carried out
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (e.g. Swift (1988)). If the thermoacoustic processes could
have been considered at first as a simple scientific curiosity, its use as a converter of thermal energy
into mechanical energy constitutes a real challenge itself. Indeed, there are many potential applica-
tions of this kind of machines combining simplicity, robustness and reasonable efficiency (Garrett,
2004). Since then, efforts have been made to improve the performance of either thermoacoustic
devices. That led, for example, to the development of a cascade thermocoustic engine (Gardner,
2003), where the overall engine efficiency is enhanced by means of combining several elementary
engines, to better use the available energy. In this sense, de Blok (2010) developed a power genera-
tor where only a low temperature difference is required to make it work; such a system has a strong
environmental impact since it allows the harvesting of waste heat. Simultaneously, important ef-
forts have been made towards the thermoacoustic efficiency by improving the comprehension of the

5



nonlinear processes involved when the acoustic wave saturation occurs in thermoacoustic engines
(Penelet, 2004; Penelet et al., 2002), and also by developing models for the temperature distribution
along their heated sections (Penelet et al., 2005b,a).

1.2 Thermoacoustic principle

The process of interaction between a fluid and a solid wall resulting in the conversion of
thermal energy into acoustic energy involves complex processes and requires accurate modeling
(Bailliet, 1998; Job, 2001; Rott, 1980). However, a simplified approach allows to understanding the
main mechanisms involved in the apparatus of Fig. 1.2. For that, it is considered a fluid particle
in the vicinity of a solid wall of the stack, along which a strong temperature gradient ?T is set
(Fig. 1.3 (a)). The temperature of the particle at rest, under a given static pressure P0, is imposed
by the presence of the wall (whose thermal inertia is assumed to be very large compared with that
of the fluid). Supposing that the thermodynamic state of the particle fluctuates under the influence
of a sinusoidal stationary sound field, thus this particle oscillates in a consequent sinusoidal mo-
tion, to which are associated small oscillations of sound pressure p(t) (p&amp;lt;&amp;lt;P0) in phase with the
acoustic particle displacement ?(t) (or in phase quadrature with the acoustic velocity). The acoustic
pressure oscillations are associated with temperature oscillations; the latter which are assumed, in
a first approximation, in phase with the first ones (Fig. 1.4 (a), solid line). This is a valid hypothesis
when the particle motion is under quasi-adiabatic conditions, which means temperature oscillations
small enough (and fast enough either) to render negligible the heat transport between adjacent par-
ticles. As an illustrative example of the orders of magnitude involved, a particle of air submitted
to a sinusoidal free field at a frequency of 1kHz, whose pressure level reaches the pain thresh-
old of the human ear (Pmax = 20Pa), has its amplitude of temperature oscillations reaching only
Tmax ? 10?2K, and its displacement amplitude ?max is of the order of 10?5m. That stated, each
thermodynamical process follows a harmonic cycle. However, an additional simplification helps
to understanding of fundamental physical phenomena involved. That would be the particle motion
being represented no longer by a sinusoidal temporal profile, but actually by a square profile in-
stead (Fig. 1.4 (a), dashed line). Four phases are then clearly distinguished in one cycle: adiabatic
compression, isobaric expansion, adiabatic expansion, and isobaric compression. The adiabatic
condition is approximated whether these processes are considered sufficiently fast, while the heat
transfer occurs during the isobaric processes between the fluid particle and the wall solid surface.
The cycle followed by the particle has its shape shown in Fig. 1.3 (b)-(e), when the temperature

6



gradient ?T applied to the wall is such that ?max?T &gt; ?max. Thus, the particle receives a quantity
of heat Q during its compression phase and returns a quantity of heat Q? during its expansion phase.
This same cycle in four phases can be represented schematically following a Clapeyron diagram
(Fig. 1.4 (b) and (c)). It then becomes clear that during the motion of the particle, a quantity of heat
Q?Q? has been converted into mechanical work (i.e. acoustic energy), represented by the shaded
area.

wave in the vicinity of a solid wall which is subjected to a temperature gradient ? T. (a) Particle

Isobaric contraction.

In reality, the heat exchange mechanism between fluid and wall is of course far more com-
plex than suggested by the previous remarks. In fact, to fully understand the real thermoacoustic
amplification process, special attention must be paid to the phase relations between oscillations of
pressure, particle velocity and acoustic temperature. As indicated above, the temperature variations
of a fluid particle are related to its compression-relaxation and the local wall temperature. The dis-
tance between fluid particle and wall is therefore an important parameter regarding the nature of
heat exchange process: "far" from the wall, the process is adiabatic and the temperature oscillates
over time and phase with the acoustic pressure; "close" by the wall, the process is isothermal and
the fluid particle has its temperature imposed at each instant by the local temperature of the wall.
But for a particle of fluid located at a distance of the order of a boundary layer thickness ?? of the

and dotted lines, of the acoustic variables of pressure (p), temperature (?) and displacement (?)

and (e) of Fig. 1.3. (b) Clapeyron diagram of an "articulated" acoustic cycle. (c) "Real" Clapeyron

wall, the thermal contact between particle and wall is "good enough" for the heat exchange to take
place, but "bad enough" for this heat exchange to not result in an instantaneous change of temper-
ature in the fluid particle; actually, at this intermediary region there is a delay in the heat exchange,
or, more precisely, a phase shift between particle motion and heat transfer (?? =

?
2?/?, where

?? is the thermal penetration depth, ? is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid, and ? is the angular
frequency). This is indeed the phase shift between oscillations of temperature and acoustic pressure
that is responsible for the energy conversion, and the cycle followed by the particle is analogous to
the diagram in Fig. 1.4 (c). In summary , only fluid particles located at a distance of the order of
a thermal boundary layer thickness effectively contribute to the thermoacoustic energy conversion.
Therefore, a stack whose pores (i.e. inter-wall distance) are properly sized for the distance ?? is
optimized for the thermoacoustic conversion, since the amount of "effective" fluid is maximized.

To resume, this cycle approaches to an ideal Brayton cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5, and
therefore it operates in an intrinsically irreversible cycle due to the finite temperature difference in
the heat transfer processes. This cycle results in a positive acoustic work production, like a thermal
engine. However, as well known from the laws of thermodynamics, an inversion in its processes
leads the system to operate as a "heat pump". Indeed, it clearly appears on the schematic cycle of
Fig. 1.3 that if the temperature gradient applied along the wall is such that ?max?T &amp;lt;?max, the
orientation of thermoacoustic heat transfer from one end of the stack to another is inverted (here,
from left to right), so that a temperature gradient is established and maintained along the stack.

8



Figure 1.5: The ideal Brayton cycle with the corresponding states of Fig. 1.4.

In the case of traveling-wave systems, the thermoacoustic principle operates differently. The
main difference relies in the fact that the acoustic pressure and the volume velocity are in phase
(and the displacement is ?/2 rad out of phase with the acoustic pressure, consequently), what
leads to approximate to an isothermal heat transfer between the fluid particle and the solid wall.
This feature leads the cycle to approach to a Stirling cycle, which is ideally reversible. To enhance
this approximation, the fluid particle must oscillate in very close thermal contact with the solid
surfaces of the porous material, whose pores therefore result much thinner than in the case of
standing-wave systems. Besides, the porous material shall possess a higher thermal conductivity,
so as to allow an adequate oscillating heat transfer in such a condition; that promotes a regenerative
cycle. As a consequence, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic systems tend to be, in principle, more
efficient than the standing-wave ones. However, there are some disadvantages that may risk this
preponderance and should be managed, such as the higher susceptibility to acoustic streaming and
viscous losses due to the smaller pores, among others.

Analogously to Figs. 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5, the traveling-wave thermoacoustic cycle is displayed
in Fig. 1.6. Figure 1.6 (a) shows the following six ideal processes: A-B: reversible adiabatic com-
pression; B-C: isothermal and reversible heat transfer; C-D: reversible adiabatic expansion; D-E:
reversible adiabatic expansion; E-F: isothermal and reversible heat transfer; F-A: reversible adia-
batic compression. All these processes are in accordance with Figs. 1.6 (b) and 1.6 (c).

2 THERMOACOUSTIC PROCESSES: THE FUNDAMENTAL MODEL-
ING

This chapter deals with the analytical description of the thermoacoustic processes. Funda-
mental equations governing thermoacoustics are presented in Section 2.1. Then, analytical expres-
sions are given for the transfer matrices of several acoustic two-ports submitted (Section 2.3) or not
submitted (Section 2.2) to a temperature distribution. Lastly, Section 2.4 is devoted to the charac-
teristic equation of a thermoacoustic device.

fluid, respectively.

2.1.2 Simplifying hypotheses

It is considered that the acoustic propagation occurs in a cylindrical tube (corresponding,
for example, to a stack pore). The diagram given in Fig. 2.1 shows the geometry of the problem
considered. The coordinate x represents the direction of acoustic propagation in a volume of fluid
located within a cylinder of radius R; y is the transversal coordinate, and r is the radial coordinate.
In the following, the dimensionless transverse coordinate ? is hereby introduced:

? =
r

R
(0 ? ? ? +1). (2.6)

12



Figure 2.1: Coordinate system used for the problem modeling.

In order to obtain analytical expressions for the acoustic variables, a number of assumptions
shall be formulated. In the framework of linear or weakly non-linear acoustics, the thermodynamic
variables are expressed using a method of successive approximations in the form:

? = ?0 + ??1 + ?
2?2 + O(?

3), (2.7)

where ? represents either the pressure p, the density ?, the temperature T , the entropy S or
the three components of the particle velocity ~v, and where ? is a small parameter (? ? 1) reflecting
the magnitude of each term.

In Eq. (2.7), the zero-order terms are the static components of the thermodynamic variables.
Among them, the static pressure p0 is assumed to be constant and uniform, and the temperature
T0(x) is assumed to be inhomogeneous in the x direction of wave propagation. The spatial temper-
ature distribution also implies taking into account spatial variations of density ?0(x) and entropy
S0(x). Finally, the fluid is assumed initially at rest in the absence of acoustic disturbances so that
~v0 = ~0.

The first-order terms in Eq. (2.7) correspond to acoustic fluctuations, which are very low in
comparison to the static components. Under the assumption of a harmonic plane wave propagating
in the x direction and using the time convention ?i?t, it is possible to write the acoustic variables
as

13



p1(x,t) =&amp;lt;
{
p?1(x)e

?i?t} , (2.8)
for the acoustic pressure, and

?1(x,?,t) =&amp;lt;
{
??1(x,?)e

?i?t
}
, (2.9)

where &amp;lt;is "the real part of ", and ?1 represents the acoustic part of either the density ?1,
the temperature ?1, the entropy s1 or the three components of the particle velocity ~v1. In Eqs. (2.8)
and (2.9), ? is the acoustic pulsation, and the symbol ? denotes for the complex amplitudes of the
acoustic variables.

The second-order terms are not taken into account here, but must be considered to describe
higher order effects, such as acoustic streaming (Bailliet et al., 2001; Guedra, 2012b), for example.

At last, under the boundary layer approximation, the transverse component of the particle
velocity is assumed to be very small compared to the longitudinal component (|v1,?|? |v1,x|), and
longitudinal variations of variables ?1(x,?) are assumed to be small compared to the transverse
variations (?x ? ?r).

2.1.3 Propagation equation governing the acoustic pressure

According to the asumptions mentioned above, the Navier-Stokes equation, Eq. (2.2), applied
to the x component of the particle velocity, v?1,x, reduces to

Integrating Eq. (2.10) across the transverse variable, and taking into account a non-slip con-
dition on the walls (v?1,x(? = 1) = 0), the solution of Eq. (2.10) for the longitudinal component of
the acoustic velocity can be written as

The function F? in Eq. (2.11) depends on the geometry under consideration and accounts
for the viscous effects (Rott, 1980; Swift, 1988; Arnott et al., 1991). In the particular case of a
cylindrical guide of radius R, the function F? takes the form:

F?(?) =

??

)
J0

(

) pour 0 ? ? ? 1, (2.12)
where J0 is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. Equivalent expressions for F?

can be obtained for guides with other section geometries, like rectangular, triangular, or, specially,
for stacked plates (Arnott et al., 1991). Equation (2.12) introduces the critical parameter in ther-
moacoustics, namely the ratio between the hydraulic radius and the viscous penetration depth (the
thermal penetration depth is analogous); in this case of the cylindrical pore, the hydraulic radius is
taken into account by the transversal dimension R of the channel, and the viscous penetration depth
?? =

depends on the frequency and on the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ? = µ

.

The linearization of the equation of heat transfer, Eq. (2.3), and of the state equations, Eqs.
(2.4) and (2.5), lead to expressions of the acoustic variables ??1, ??1 and s?1 as functions of the acoustic
pressure and its spatial derivatives, as following:

In the case of a cylindrical guide, substituting F? (respectively F?) by its expression of Eq.
(2.12) into Eq. (2.16) leads to the analytical expression for the thermo-viscous function f? (respec-
tively f?):

linearized and averaged over the coordinate ? leads to the propagation equation for sound pressure
in a dissipative medium in the presence of a temperature gradient:

represents the lossless wavenumber. This differential equation is equivalent
to that given by Rott (1969) and Swift (1988, 2002) for an ideal gas and assuming that the fluid
thermal effusivity is negligible compared with that of the solid. When the temperature distribution
T0(x) is known, the solution of this differential equation can be obtained either numerically (Ward,
1994; Ward et al., 2008) or analytically in an implicit form by transforming the equation (2.22) in
a Volterra integral equation of the second kind (Gusev et al., 2000; Job, 2001).

2.2 Analytical expressions for the transfer matrix of acoustic two-port

A thermoacoustic system can be seen as an assembly of several elements designated as acous-
tic two-ports. In its simplest arrangement, an engine is a combination of a thermoacoustic core
(TAC) and a set of waveguides with various geometries (either cylindrical, rectangular, or another
one). Each of these acoustic two-ports may be (or not) submitted to an inhomogeneous temperature
distribution.

To describe the propagation of an acoustic wave in a thermoacoustic engine, each acoustic
two-port may be characterized by its transfer matrix (Guedra, 2012a; Ueda, 2008; Tu et al., 2003).
In this section, the analytical expression of the transfer matrix is derived in the case of a straight
duct, a porous material, and a tapered waveguide, as these are the classical two-ports generally used
for the design of a themoacoustic engine. The temperature distribution along these elements is first
considered homogeneous. The case of a non-uniform temperature distribution is treated in Sec. 2.3.

Surely, powerful thermoacoustic engines do not consist of only such basic elements. They
also include parts of more complex geometries (Backhaus, 1999, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2004),
allowing either a diminution of nonlinear losses by means of semi-empirical design (jet pumps,
tapered tubes) or the improvement of the efficiency the system. The experimental determination of
the transfer matrix of such complex elements with a non-uniform temperature distribution is the
subject of the next chapter.

symmetric orientation.

2.2.1 Conventions

In the following, the longitudinal dimension of the two-port is denoted by d and the coordinate
system is defined so that the entrance of the two-port is placed at the origin x = 0 and its output at
x = d, with the plane wave propagation following the ~Ox axis. As illustrated in Fig. 2.2, the volume
velocity u?1,x(0) at the entrance of the quadrupole is counted positive, while u?1,x(d) is positive as
well, but located at the exit (anti-symmetric orientation).

The transfer matrix of the two-port corresponding to Fig. 2.2 is thus defined as following:

2.2.2 Case of a straight waveguide

The Equation (2.22) defined in Section 2.1 describes the propagation of a plane wave along
the waveguide in the presence of a longitudinal temperature distribution. When the temperature
profile is assumed to be constant and equal to the ambient temperature Tc (?xT0 = 0 and ?xf? = 0
because the dynamic viscosity µ and the fluid density ?0 do not depend on x) this equation becomes

?2p?1

where the complex wavenumber

takes into account the viscous-thermal coupling between the fluid and the waveguide walls
by means of the f? and f? functions. The general solution of Eq. (2.24) is writing

p?1 = A?e
+ikx + B?e?ikx. (2.26)

Substituting this solution into Eq. (2.17) allows writing the axial component of the particle
velocity averaged over the guide section in the form

is then given below

u?1,x =

where Zc is the characteristic complex impedance of the waveguide defined by

Zc =

(1 ?f?)(1 + (? ? 1)f?)
. (2.29)

Finally, Eqs. (2.26) and (2.28) expressed for x = 0 lead to the determination of the complex
amplitudes A? and B? :

19



A? =

2
, (2.30)

B? =
p?1(0) ?Zcu?1,x(0)

2
. (2.31)

Using these relations into Eqs. (2.26) and (2.28) expressed for x = d allows to derive the
analytical expression of the transfer matrix T of the guide below:

T ?

(
cos(kwd) iZc sin(kwd)

iZ?1c sin(kwd) cos(kwd)

)
. (2.32)

2.2.3 Case of a porous element

To ensure a temperature gradient along the stack/regenerator, thermoacoustic engines often
incorporate heat exchangers constituted of porous material which includes a heating or cooling
system. Unlike the stack or the regenerator, the thermal gradient along the heat exchangers may
be neglected in first approximation without implicating major errors in this modeling. Exchangers
are generally modeled as porous elements at a constant hot or ambient temperature, which are
respectively TH or TC.

The transfer matrix of such an element is deduced from the matrix of Eq. (2.32):

T ?

thermal coupling between the fluid and the pore walls of a characteristic transverse dimension
r0. For example, in the case of a network of cylindrical pores, the analytical expressions of these
functions are given by Eq. (2.21) replacing R by r0.

2.2.4 Case of a tapered waveguide

Most studied thermoacoustic engines incorporate adaptive conical parts connecting waveg-
uide sections (Chen, 1999; Backhaus, 2000; Biwa et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2003; Hao et al., 2011).
These conical parts affect the distribution of acoustic fields.

In accordance with the notations used so far, the cone is defined as a waveguide of radius R
that varies linearly between R0 = R(0) and Rd = R(d) (see Fig. 2.2). The analytical expression of
the transfer matrix of a conical two-port can be found in the reference (Mechel, 2008) for different
writing conventions than those adopted in this manuscript. For clarity, this analytical expression is
rewritten from (Mechel, 2008) as:

Zc are respectively given by equations Eq. (2.25) and Eq. (2.29) [with S = ?R2d in Eq. (2.29)].
However, it should be noted that Eq. (2.36), outcome from Mechel (2008) , is initially derived from

21



the equation of Webster without loss. Taking into account the losses (which depend strictly on R)
would imply to solve a wave equation similar to that of linear thermoacoustics [Eq. (2.22)], whose
solution is more demanding than in Eq. (2.36). That means, in other words, that the analytical
expression (2.36) is an approximation of acoustic propagation in a cone with parietal losses, with
functions f? et f? performing in expressions (2.25) and (2.29) evaluated for R = (R0 + Rd)/2.

2.3 Analytical expression for the transfer matrix of an acoustic two-port submitted
to a non-uniform temperature distribution

To describe the propagation of harmonic plane waves in an acoustic two-port subject to an
inhomogeneous distribution of temperature T0(x), the differential equation of second order, Eq.
(2.22), with non-constant coefficients has to be solved. Gusev et al. proposed an exact analytical
solution of this equation in the form of an infinite series of integral operators (Gusev et al., 2000;
Job, 2001; Penelet et al., 2005b; Penelet, 2004). Them, Eq. (2.22) is rewritten as

when dxT0 = 0, particular case where ?1 and ?2 are set to a multiplicative constant.

The Eq. (2.50) is valid either for a stack or the passive part of the core, simply evaluating
the thermo-viscous functions for a narrow channel of radius r1 or a wide channel of radius R,
respectively (with S 7? ?S for a porous element). It should be noted that the Eq. (2.50) for a
wide guide or a stack tends to asymptotically approach the expressions (2.32) and (2.33) when the
temperature is constant along the two-port.

2.4 Characteristic equation of a thermoacoustic device

2.4.1 Case of a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine

Standing-wave thermoacoustic systems generally consist of a straight waveguide wherein the
resonance of a fluid column occurs, and also of heat exchangers, as represented in Fig. 2.3. Those

25



systems are simple and reliable, but not efficient. Although they are of little interest for industrial
applications because of their low yield, the study of these systems is essential from an academic
point of view, to better understand the complex phenomena involved in the thermoacoustic operat-
ing machines.

The low performance of standing-wave engines is implicitly associated to the stationary na-
ture of the fluid particle oscillation in the vicinity of the solid wall. Indeed, such acoustic cycle
consists of thermodynamic processes similar to those of a Brayton cycle (adiabatic compression
- isobaric expansion - adiabatic expansion/relaxation - isobaric contraction), whose performance
is intrinsically lower than that of Carnot type. Therefore, to approach what would be considered
adiabatic processes, an imperfect thermal contact between the fluid and solid walls is required. To
optimize such imperfection in favor of cycle performance, a trade-off between the particle speed
and its position in the thermal and viscous boundary layers shall be found, as they are inversely
proportional. Employing a stack in these machines requires the pore radius to be of the order of
magnitude of a thermal penetration depth (rs ? ??). This type of engine has been extensively stud-
ied in the literature (Swift, 2002, 1988, 1992; Atchley, 1992; Atchley et al., 1992; Atchley, 1994b;
Chen, 1999; Hao et al., 2011) and, although being potentially less attractive than the traveling-wave
system, it still remains explorable even if the investigation involves complex acoustic phenomena
of difficult theoretical prediction.

Using the formalism of transfer matrices, it is possible to write the equation relating the
acoustic pressure and flow at x = 0 and x = L in the form:

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
= Tr ×TTAC ×Tl ×

(
p?1(0)

u?1,x(0)

)
, (2.52)

where Tl and Tr are the transfer matrices of the tube portions at ambient temperature Tc,
respectively at left and right side of the thermoacoustic core, and where TTAC is the transfer matrix
of the thermoacoustic core (i.e. the part of the system subjected to an inhomogeneous distribution
temperature), which is defined as follows:

TTAC ?

(
Tpp(?,T0(x)) Tpu(?,T0(x))
Tup(?,T0(x)) Tuu(?,T0(x))

)
. (2.53)

26



The transfer matrix TTAC depends on the geometric and thermophysical properties of the
thermoacoustic core that are linked to its constitutive elements, namely stack, passive part, and
heat exchangers. Nevertheless, it also depends on other factors such as temperature distribution
T0(x) along both stack (x ? [xs,xh]) and passive part (x ? [xh,xw]), and on the acoustic pulsation
?. When the temperature distribution is known, TTAC can be obtained theoretically (Job, 2001;
Penelet et al., 2005b; Penelet, 2004), as it has been presented in the last section. However, this
matrix can also be measured under different heating conditions, as it will be shown and explored in
Chapter 3.

2.4.2 Case of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine

The so-called traveling-wave thermoacoustic systems are characterized by the presence of a
feedback loop favoring the amplification of traveling waves. These machines evoke the interest of
the thermoacoustician community mostly by reason of their performances, often much higher than
those which could be reached by an equivalent standing-wave system. This potentially high return
is a result of the thermodynamic cycle to which the fluid particle is subjected. Its movement near
a solid wall approximately follows the Stirling cycle, whose ideal efficiency is that of Carnot’s.
Therefore, the thermodynamic processes involved in this cycle (isothermal compression - isochoric
warming - isothermal expansion - isochoric cooling) are of interest to approximate the reversibility
as much as possible. This is the key factor that distinguishes traveling-wave from standing-wave
engines, as the latter relies instead on intrinsic irreversibility (Subsection 2.4.1). To enhance the
heat transfer efficiency, the traveling wave systems require the porous material to have its average
pore radius very small compared to the thermal penetration depth (rs ? ??), so that to approach
the heat transfer process to an isothermal contact between the fluid particle and the pore internal
wall. Besides, this porous material shall have an adequately higher thermal conductivity than that
of a stack (applied in standing wave systems), to allow alternate heat storing and delivering during
the acoustic cycle, perfoming hence as a regenerator.

Many engine configurations promoting the triggering of progressive wave are possible, and
the more conventional one uses a annular resonator (Fig. 2.4-(a,b)). In 1979, P. Ceperley was the
first to propose this idea to demonstrate the possibility of developing thermoacoustic Stirling en-
gines (Ceperley, 1979); he did not appreciate the second-order flow (Gedeon) that would render
his incarnations inoperable. Since then, this type of engine has been extensively studied (Ceperley,

27



Figure 2.4: Schematic representations of traveling-wave thermoacoustic engines. (a) Annular res-
onator. (b) Annular resonator coupled to a secondary acoustic load (secondary resonator, electro-
dynamic alternator, or any other load). (c) Co-axial resonator.

1985; Yazaki et al., 1985). In 1999, Backhaus et al. were successful in developing a prototype of
thermoacoustic Stirling engine wherein the feedback loop is coupled to a straight resonator (Back-
haus, 1999, 2000). A few years later, Backhaus et al. (2004) also developed a thermo-acoustic-
electric transducer prototype, wherein the acoustic-electric conversion is performed by a linear
electrodynamic alternator coupled to the annular resonator. Finally, Fig. 2.4-(c) shows a schematic
version of a co-axial (Bastyr, 2003) system in which the feedback loop is formed by placing a core
in the thermoacoustic tube of largest section.

Traveling-wave systems are here described analogously to the case of standing-wave, as pre-
viously in Subsection 2.4.1. Neglecting the effects on the wave propagation due the waveguide
curvature, the annular thermoacoustic system shown in 2.4-(a) is also described by Eq. (2.52), ex-
cept that the positions x = 0 and x = L correspond in reality to the same location, as they meet
each other in a loop (Fig. 2.4-(a)). Hence, taking into account this continuity condition as below

28



p?1(0) = p?1(L), (2.54)

u?1,x(0) = u?1,x(L), (2.55)

and making the substitution into Eq. (2.52), it results in the following:

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
= Tr ×TTAC ×Tl ×

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
. (2.56)

When a secondary element is coupled to the loop [cf. Fig. 2.4-(b)], the conservation of acous-
tic pressures and volume velocity between x = 0 and x = L leads in this case to:

p?1(0) = p?1(L), (2.57)

u?1,x(0) = u?1,x(L) ?Ychp?1(L), (2.58)

where Ych is the acoustic admittance presented by the secondary load. This admittance can
be that of a closed tube, an electrodynamic alternator, or a combination of any acoustic element
characterized by its reduced admittance. Relations (2.57) and (2.58) introduced in Eq. (2.56) then
lead to:

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
= Tr ×TTAC ×Tl ×

(
1 0

?Ych 1

)
×

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
. (2.59)

At last, in the case of a co-axial system [cf. Fig. 2.4-(c)], Eq. (2.52) establishes the relation
between acoustic pressure and volume velocity at the extremities of the tube of small section S.
The continuity relations expressed at x = 0, on the one hand,

29



p?1(0) = p?a(0), (2.60)

u?1,x(0) = Ygp?a(0) ? u?a,x(0), (2.61)

and at x = L, on the other hand,

p?1(L) = p?a(L), (2.62)

u?1,x(L) = Ydp?a(L) ? u?a,x(L), (2.63)

involve the acoustic pressure p?a and the volume velocity u?a,x in the peripheral ring of section
SA = ?(R

?2 ?R2) and the admittances Yg and Yd of the large section tubes SL = SA + S and of
respective lengths lg and ld:

Yg,l = ?iZ(L)c cot(k
(L)lg,d). (2.64)

From Eqs. (2.60) to (2.63) and the transfer matrix of the peripheral ring denoted TA, a second
matrix equation relating the acoustic pressure and speed in x = 0 and x = L is then obtained as:

(
p?1(0)

u?1,x(0)

)
=

(
1 0

)
×TA?1 ×

(
1 0

Yd ?1

)
×

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
, (2.65)

where the inverse matrix TA is introduced here to meet the x-axis and the conventions defined
in Subsection 2.2.1. It should be noted that the matrix TA, when symmetrical and reciprocal, has
its inverse well defined. Substituting Eq. (2.65) into Eq. (2.52) leads to the following equation:

30

p?1(L)

(

)
. (2.66)

To conclude, regardless of the kind of system involved in the equations (2.56), (2.59) or
(2.66), there can be identified an expression of a transfer matrix that embraces TTAC and also
connects the complex amplitudes of acoustic pressure and volume velocity to the same position
x = L by means of using the relation (2.52), thus completing a feedback loop. Equations (2.56),
(2.59) and (2.66) may be written in the following general form:

(
p?1(L)

u?1,x(L)

)
=

(
Mpp(?,T0(x)) Mpu(?,T0(x))
Mup(?,T0(x)) Muu(?,T0(x))

)

(
p?1(L)

equation admitting a non-trivial (non-zero) solution if and only if the determinant of the
matrix

(
Mpp Mpu

)
? I2 (2.68)

is zero, where I2 is the identity matrix 2 × 2. That leads to the characteristic equation of the
system:

1 + MppMuu ?MpuMup ? (Mpp + Muu) = 0. (2.69)

3 EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE THERMOACOUS-
TIC CORE

Even below the threshold of thermoacoustic instability, the theoretical description of acoustic
propagation and heat transfer through the thermoacoustic core (TAC) is anything but simple. This
is essentially due to the fact that thermoacoustic engines make use of geometrically complicated
materials (piles of stainless steel meshes, metallic foams) whose thermophysical parameters are
unknown. Moreover, the accuracy of the description of acoustic propagation through the TAC also
depends critically on the shape of the temperature field within the TAC, the latter being very dif-
ficult to describe theoretically. Therefore, alternative methods allowing the description of the TAC
are presented in this chapter. These methods consist of measuring the transfer matrix of the TAC,
and the experimental data being used afterwards for the theoretical description of thermoacous-
tic engines. Three different methods are presented in this chapter. First, the so-called "two-load
method" previously used by Guedra et al. (2011) is presented and it is shown that this method
becomes inaccurate when the TAC is a regenerator-based one (Section 3.3). Then, two alternative
experimental approaches are presented: a two-load method with TAC inversion (Section 3.4) and
a new "impedance" method based on the measurement of the impedance matrix of the TAC by
means of an acoustic impedance sensor (Section 3.6). In particular it is shown that the impedance
method allows accurate descriptions of both stack-based TAC and regenerator-based TAC. Other-
wise, it must be noted that, in essence, all three methods consist likewise in acoustic impedance
measurements and require measurements under two different acoustic conditions. In spite of this,
for simplicity of identification, these three methods are here called as stated above.

3.1 Description of the TAC under study

An approximate scale plan of the thermoacoustic core under study is presented in Fig. 3.1:
its total length is 464 mm with an inner radius of 16.9 mm. The active part is made of a roughly
70 mm long stack/regenerator (sometiles combined with ceramic washers) bounded by a hot heat
exchanger (HHX) and an ambient heat exchanger (AHX), on opposite sides. The passive part is
the waveguide part set between the HHX and a secondary AHX. The geometrical properties of the
sample materials used for the stack/regenerator in this study are reported in Tab. 3.1. With regards
to the transversal dimensions, all are cylindrical and fit quite well the internal diameter of the stack

33



holder, which is around 33.9 mm. The two AHX are made up of two copper pipes passing through
a honeycombed aluminum disk, with flowing water inside the pipes at room temperature. The HHX
is made up of a sample of ceramic catalyst 900 cpsi (cells per square inch) in which a Nichrome
resistance wire is coiled. The thickness of this sample is 10 mm and the heat resistance wire is
connected to an electrical DC power supply controlling the heat power QH dissipated by Joule
effect throughout the wire. In order to avoid electric contact between the Nichrome resistance of
the HHX and the stack/regenerator when made up of a conductive material, ceramic washers are
placed between them. These washers are also sculpted from pieces of ceramic catalyst of 900 cpsi
mesh size. Their lengths are adjusted to better fit all pieces together in the stack holder. In the case
of the Stainless Steel Grids, two washers are necessary, one at each material side, to stabilize the
grids assembling.

Figure 3.1: Approximate scale plan of the ThermoAcoustic Core.

In the following, the objective is to measure each coefficient of the transfer matrix of the
thermoacoustic core as a function of both angular frequency ? and heat power supply QH. The
transfer matrix TTAC (?,QH) is defined as

where p?l,r = p?(xl,r) and u?l,r = u?(xl,r) are the complex amplitudes of acoustic pressure p and
acoustic volume velocity u at both ends x = xl (left) and x = xr (right) of the TAC (see Fig. 3.1).
The positions xl and xr are considered attached to the TAC no mattering whether it is inverted or
not with respect to its longitudinal axis.

3.2 Common features

The three approaches considered in this chapter allow the measurement of the TTAC co-
efficients as functions of both angular frequency ? and heat power supply QH: Tpp(?,QH),
Tpu(?,QH), Tup(?,QH) and Tuu(?,QH). In the following, whatever the method considered,
each set of coefficient measurements covers the whole range of frequencies of interest for each
specific thermal condition QH, arbitrarily established. In the case of QH = 0, it is expected the
TAC to be reciprocal, meaning that the determinant of its T-matrix equals 1. Therefore, the more
det(TTAC) approaches the unity, the better the measurements quality is. The reciprocity can be
evaluated for each frequency, leading to the average value rc of reciprocity defined as

rc =

where ?i is the ith value of the operating frequency, and N is the number of operating fre-
quencies in the range of analysis. The standard deviation ?rc of rc is also evaluated. These statistical
values are the quality parameters to be accomplished in this experimental investigation, taking as
references their ideal values: 1 for rc, and 0 for ?rc. A discrepancy of rc from 1 means a devi-
ation of bias, typically related to an inhomogeneous temperature profile and/or to the sensitivity
to a significant propagation of numerical errors in the course of the data post-processing. On the
other hand, a discrepancy of ?rc from 0 is independent of the thermal profile and it is an indicator
of noise, which may be caused by either an external interference or/and a significant numerical
sensitivity, alike the bias case. By experience, an rc within 1 percent of the ideal unity and a ?rc
within 0.01 suggest the quality of measurement is acceptable.

However, when additional energy besides acoustical is inserted into the system, for example,
thermal energy for, there is no longer unitary reciprocity. The more the temperature profile turns
inhomogeneous with an increasing heat power input, the greater the gap between the resulted de-
terminant and unity becomes. Hence, the reciprocity as a parameter of quality can only be usefully
exploited if obtained from measurements with no heat supply, and, as much as possible, at a well
established time-invariant and constant temperature profile along the TAC, so that the ideal unitary
determinant can be pursued.

It is worth noting that the level of acoustic pressure in the TAC must be relatively small so
as not to generate non-linear effects or thermoacoustically induced temperature gradient along the
TAC.

In the following, it is assumed that the subsequent measurements with heating input can
be performed at the same level of quality for their corresponding TTAC coefficients than the one
achieved without heating, even though there is no longer a clear reference such as reciprocity.
This assumption is grounded in the fact that, with or without heating supply, the whole setup and
measurements are proceeded in the same way and standards for each approach. However, besides
those common procedures, heated measurements also require the establishment of a steady-state
regime along all measurements - at least to a satisfactory level - to maintain the quality concerns.
Thus, the transitory thermal effects due to the imposed variations on QH, and also due to the
cooling system interaction, are to be considered. They are investigated in Appendix A, and the
resulting guidelines are followed in all measurements henceforth.

Framework solution for the two-port system

The experimental characterization of the TAC is based on the determination of the four coeffi-
cients of the transfer matrix, for given ? and QH, from the measurement of p?l,r and u?l,r, according
to Eq. (3.1). However, this measurement leads to a set of two equations with four unknown co-
efficients, what compels another set of two to fulfill the deterministic system requirements. Such
algebraic constraints work either way for the other possible connecting matrices, namely diffusion,
admittance and impedance, as stated in the two-port theory. Therefore, those connecting matri-
ces are different ways to describe the same system, and they are interchangeable, thus allowing
searches for the transfer matrix from different approaches. Another theoretical aspect to be illumi-
nated is that the need for two measurements vanishes if the system is symmetrical. However, this is
not the case for the TAC under investigation, as the porous material is located in a non-symmetrical
position with respect to the TAC axis (see Fig. 3.1); moreover, the HHX is another element also
asymmetrically placed, what enhances this resolution.

Essentially, one must proceed with two set of measurements to characterize a non-
symmetrical system, no matter what kind of connecting matrix is sought. Such conceptual state-
ments suggest that this need depends on the method or strategy to achieve TTAC. Consequently, all
three experimental approaches treated here end up within this frame.

3.3 First approach: the Two-Load Method - about its failure

The "Two-Load Method" is the method previously used by Guedra et al. (2011) to evalu-
ate the experimental transfer matrix of a stack-based TAC. It consists of a classical experimental
procedure for the acoustic characterization where a four-microphone method is used to obtain the
four coefficients of the transfer matrix TTAC (?,QH) on a given frequency range and for various
heating conditions (Boden, 1986; Munjal, 1987). The same experimental apparatus and most of the
setup procedures used by Guedra et al. (2011) are implemented in the frame of the present work.
The aim of this first approach is twofold: First, it is to check the repeatability of this measurement
technique for a stack-based TAC. Second, it is to test the applicability of the Two-Load Method for
a regenerator-based TAC, exhibiting high acoustic reflectivity and low transmissibility.

3.3.1 Principle of the method

A schematic view of the measurement system is given in Fig. 3.3. Two straight ducts are con-
nected on either side of the TAC. The left tube is connected to an electrodynamic loudspeaker. Four
microphones are set along the two waveguides at positions xi with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The TTAC coef-
ficients are obtained using Eq. (3.1). Thus, the principle of the method consists of calculating the
complex amplitudes of p?l,r and u?l,r, from the pressure measurements at positions xi. However, it is
clear that the relation of Eq. (3.1) is a system of two equations with four unknowns. Two measure-
ments are required to get the four transfer coefficients Tpp, Tpu, Tup and Tuu. A "two-load" method
is then performed which consists of two measurements for two different terminal acoustic loads,
corresponding to two linearly independent states of the system: a first measurement is performed
with an open waveguide, then a second measurement is performed when the waveguide is closed
by a rigid plug.

Under the assumption of an harmonic plane wave, the acoustic pressure in the waveguide can
be expressed in terms of the linear combination of two counterpropagating plane waves dependent
on the coordinate x,

p?(x) = p?+(x) + p??(x). (3.3)

The acoustic pressure can be written for two waveguide portions located at the left hand side
of the TAC (x ? (0,xl)) and at the right hand side of the TAC (x ? (xr, l)),

p?(x) = p?+l e

and

p?(x) = p?+r e

?jkw(x?xr),?x ? [xr,L], (3.5)

where the complex wavenumber kw takes into account the viscous and thermal losses on the
waveguide internal walls, as explained in Subsection 2.2.2.

The four counterpropagating acoustic pressure components stated in Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) can
be expressed in terms of the measured acoustic pressures p?i = p?(xi) taken at the four microphone
locations:

However, the scattering matrix itself does not directly achieve the interests of this work,
which rely instead in the transfer matrix TTAC. Besides, even though the desired TTAC coefficients
could be obtained from the scattering matrix simply by applying the proper two-port transforming
relations, there is a more straightforward way to solve the problem, which is to apply Eq. (3.1).

The TTAC coefficients can be obtained from the determination of p?l,r and u?l,r by substituting
the four counterpropagating components obtained from Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7), respectively, into the

40



definition of Eq. (3.3) and into the Euler’s equation (Eq. (3.9)) stated below:

The terms p?l,r and u?l,r are developed below by substituting the four expressions (3.6) and
(3.7) into the definitions (3.11) and (3.12):

p?l =
p?2sin[kw(xl ?x1)] ? p?1sin[kw(xl ?x2)]

Eqs. (3.13), (3.14), (3.15) and (3.16) result in the following expressions:

u?r = p?3

jZcsin[kw(x4 ?x3)]
, (3.21)

These expressions fulfill the requirements to determine the four unknowns of the definition
of Eq. (3.1) as long as p?l, p?r, u?l and u?r are measured twice, under two different acoustic loads (1st
and 2nd), as explained above. That results in a deterministic system of four equations:

p?1str = Tpp.p?

Solving the system of equations above by substituting expressions from Eq. (3.18) to Eq.
(3.21), the TTAC coefficients are found in terms of the measured transfer functions H?ij itemized
in Eq. (3.17), which includes all measured acoustic pressures. The remaining terms related to the
wavenumber kw and to the axial positions xi and xj are obtained independently from those mea-
surements. The resulting equations are shown in the following:

where sij = sin[kw(xi ?xj)] and cij = cos[kw(xi ?xj)].

It is worth noting that the TTAC coefficients are acoustical properties that depend on fre-
quency and temperature, and not on an imposed acoustic load. Hence, that allows such impositions
to be arbitrarily defined to maximize the equations inter-independence, which increases the preci-
sion of the TTAC coefficients determination. The acoustic loads are therefore chosen to differ each
other as much as possible. Indeed, such independent conditions are evident in the denominators of
all four coefficients, where the inequality H?2nd21 6= H?1st21 is to be ensured.

The complex notation in the frequency domain for the transfer functions is convenient, as
has been shown in this section so far. However, the original signal input, which are the actual
measurements captured by the four microphones, are necessarily taken in the time domain and in
real values. Hence, a transformation takes place in this sense, in which these original signals have
their amplitude ampi and phase phii of the ith microphone estimated by a numerical approach
applied for each frequency ?, enabling the calculation of the complex transfer functions in the
whole frequency domain. Explicitly, that gives:

H?21 =
amp2
amp1

e?j(phi2?phi1),H?31 =
amp3
amp1

e?j(phi3?phi1),H?43 =
amp4
amp3

e?j(phi4?phi3). (3.30)

43



Nevertheless, these original acoustic signals are too noisy to be put forward in the subse-
quent calculations, and thus shall be conditioned for a proper refinement to avoid significant error
propagation. This treatment is made by applying a least square method in a process of estimating
averages ampi and phii, turning those signals closer to harmonic and less noisy.

3.3.2 Experimental setup and procedures

A photograph of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 3.4. The two tubes connected on either
side of the TAC are made of PVC. They are two meters long and their inner radius R = 16.47 mm
is slightly different than the TAC’s one (Rw = 16.93 mm). The acoustic field is generated by an
electrodynamic loudspeaker attached to left extremity of the left duct, as shown in Fig. 3.3. It gen-
erates a stepped sine corresponding to a frequency range from 50 to 200 Hz with increments of
1 Hz. Hence, the measurements are carried out for 151 frequencies. An optimum acoustic pressure
is achieved at its maximum linear behavior, which is at a pressure level around 0.4Pa, provided
by a voltage of approximately 87mV delivered to the loudspeaker. Four microphones (model B&amp;amp;K
4138) are flush mounted along the pipes. They are placed in such locations that intrinsic measure-
ment errors are minimized, in conformity with the criteria established by Boden (1986):

0.1? &amp;lt;k0?x &amp;lt;0.8?. (3.31)

That resulted in the interval ?x = 60 cm, what led the frequency range to fit within the
proper interval between 50 and 200 Hz.

To ensure that no geometric discontinuity affects the sound field, the microphones are placed
in suitable parts, machined so as to match the radius of curvature of the tubes, the junction between
the waveguides and the microphone membrane being made by a capillary tube. The measurement
signals are provided to the computer through the data acquisition card with a sampling frequency
of 10 kHz, and their amplitude and phase are obtained using a least squares estimator from 500
samples taken for each frequency and at each microphone.

A relative calibration of microphones is done in order to take into account their respective
sensitivities. The microphones are placed face-to-face in a cavity of very small size relative to the

44

wavelength, so that the pressure field can be considered spatially uniform in the working frequency
range (Fig. B.1). The transfer functions measured by this method are shown in Fig. B.2 These
transfer functions, denoted C?ij, defined as the ratios of sensitivities S of each microphone in the
assumption of uniformity of pressure field,

C?ij =
Si
Sj
, (3.32)

are used as a correction for the transfer function measured in situ. More information concern-
ing the calibration procces is given in Appendix B.

To favor the stabilization of the temperature profile along the TAC axis, natural convection is
minimized. That requires to keep the TAC always in the horizontal position, like in Fig. 3.1.

45



The cooling system is totally prevented from air bubbles in the cooper pipes and water hoses
with the goal of improving the heat transfer efficiency, and also of avoiding the related noise -
proved to be important. Within the same concern, vibration from the water pump and reservoir are
minimized by means of keeping them apart from the TAC’s workbench.

Close temperature monitoring is recorded for every thermal condition, for all measurements.
These data are obtained by means of two thermocouples, one immersed in the water reservoir
and the other attached to hottest external surface of the TAC. Moreover, a domestic thermome-
ter/hygrometer/barometer register the laboratory ambient conditions, which are recorded as well.
The average values are implemented in all post-processing to obtain the TTAC coefficients.

All setups are prepared the night before. The water circulation is turned on, and it is kept
operating till the end of the experimentation for each material, according to the transient regime
investigation. The TAC orientation is maintained in just one way, just like in Fig. 3.1. The transfer
functions H?21, H?31 and H?43 are obtained for each one of the two acoustic loads, before changing the
heating supply; that means to obtain the needed six transfer functions per QH condition. To define
the maximal QH, it is taken as reference the operational limit of the electrical resistance of the HHX
here used, which is around 84 W . For this power, the temperature inside the TAC rises over 400ºC -
as explored later in Section 3.33 - which covers most of typical values for the threshold condition for
standard thermoacoustic engines. Therefore, such levels for QH are representative in what concerns
real engine circumstances. That said, the increment on the QH variation is defined constant, and
its number is calculated so that all measurements can be done within one day (non-interrupted 13
hours) for each material. This avoids major effects of ambient oscillations in temperature, humidity
and pressure (less important). The interest is to have the number of power increments maximized
as much as possible, to improve resolution with respect to performance predictions, to be explored
later on in Chapter 4. As a result, there are 28 different values for QH, ranging from 0 W to 81 W
by a constant increment of 3 W .

The measurement procedures follow the logical sequence presented in Subsection 3.3.1. It
begins with QH = 0W , and then QH progresses by adjusting the power supply until QH = 81W ,
always in the increasing direction for both acoustic loads. For each QH the time-delay of 13 min is
respected.

46



3.3.3 Results

Two materials are investigated with the Two-Load Method: the Ceramic Catalyst (Fig. 3.5)
and the pile of Stainless Steel Grids (Fig. 3.6).

Figure 3.5: Ceramic Catalyst in detail and partially inserted in the open TAC.

Despite of both cases having been done for 28 values of QH as mentioned in paragraph 3.3.2,
results are only shown for 3 heating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 36 W and Q = 72 W ) for the sake
of clarity. This allows a visual evaluation of the curve progression with heating, if the noise level is
not excessively high. The choice of these two materials allows testing the Two-Load Method with
both stack-based and regenerator-based TAC.

Case of the Ceramic Catalyst

Figure 3.7 shows the four transfer coefficients (amplitude and phase) for the three selected
heating conditions in the case of the Ceramic Catalyst. All curves are smooth and coherent with
respect to the QH variation.

To summarize the quality of this measurement, the Fig. 3.8 reveals the reciprocity behavior
with frequency (for QH = 0 W ). Its average value is around rc = 1.010 + 0.002i - hence very

47

close to 1 - which indicates a low bias level. The reciprocity standard deviation, in its turn, is
?rc = 0.002 + 0.002i. This is an indicator of low noise level, as it approaches 0.

Case of the Stainless Steel Grids

Figure 3.9 shows the four transfer coefficients (amplitude and phase) for the three heating
conditions in the case of the Stainless Steel Grids. For this material, contrarily to the Ceramic
Catalyst, all curves are very rough and do not allow a clear distinction of the QH progression. The
reciprocity behavior in Fig. 3.8 shows that the problem comes from a very high noise level, since
?rc = 0.134 + 0.123i. Bias, on the other hand, is not an issue in this case: rc = 0.996 + 0.005i.
Therefore, as the method is the same one applied for the Ceramic Catalyst, under the same well-
controlled experimental procedures, this high level of noise appears to be inherent in materials with
low porosity - which means high reflectivity. The average level of acoustic pressure is much higher
in the duct placed upstream from the sample than in the duct at the downstream side; that causes
the microphones placed downstream to capture signals proportionally much more affected by noise
than the ones placed upstream, what ends up affecting the transfer coefficients as well.

3.3.4 Comparison with theory and analysis

Making use of the theory presented in Chapter 2, it is possible to derive the theoretical vari-
ation of TTAC coefficients with frequency for QH = 0 W . A comparison between theory and
experiment for the Ceramic Catalyst is given in Figs. 3.15 and 3.16. It shows a good agreement
with respect to all TTAC coefficients, despite the fact that the values of parameters given in Tab.3.1
are not known with extreme accuracy. Those comparative results validate the experimental results,
although restricted to the non-heated condition. In the case of heated conditions, the Two-Load
Method should be valid as well, since the same procedure has been followed along all measure-
ments, just as for QH = 0.

for the Ceramic Catalyst 600 cpsi (bold lines) and the Stainless Steel Grids (thin lines)- Two-Load
Method.

For the 60 mm pile of Stainless Steel Grids, however, there are no geometrical parameters
accurate enough to obtain ? and equivalent cylindrical rs because of its high tortuosity and com-
plex geometry, and hence there are no theoretical TTAC coefficients available from the mentioned
modeling. In spite of that, ? and rs may estimated from the proper TTAC coefficients by applying an
inverse method developed by Guedra (2012b) - as long as those coefficients are already obtained by
other means, evidently. Then, using the measured TTAC by the Two-Load Method just presented,
although noisy and imprecise (see Fig. 3.9), the estimation of ? and rs for the Stainless Steel Grids
are still convergent, leading to ? = 63.3% and rs ? 0.04 mm. From then on, the theoretical mod-
eling can be applied to this material alike in the Ceramic Catalyst case, but the resulting TTAC
coefficients are no longer purely theoretical nor precise since its origins are unsatisfying experi-
mental results. On the other hand, such experimental limitation concerns only noise level (?rc), and
not so much bias level (rc) - as shown in the previous subsection; that allows considering those ex-
perimental results to be valid for the estimation of average parameters such as ? and rs, if there is a
convergence, as shown just above. This assumption gives a near reliability on the semi-theoretical
TTAC coefficients, at least when using them as approximative reference for further experimental
investigations.

3.3.5 Discussion

The Two-Load Method is revalidated for a stack application taking a Ceramic Catalyst as the
tested sample. However, it fails to accurately measure the TTAC coefficients for materials with low
porosity, like a regenerator as the pile of Stainless Steel Grids. In principle, this kind of problem
could be accommodated by increasing the acoustic pressure level and the number of microphones.
But higher levels of acoustic pressure have been tested which did not lead to significant improve-
ments. Moreover, increasing the acoustic level magnitude leads to weakly nonlinear propagation, as
well as to significant thermoacoustic heat transport by sound along the material that might increase
the complexity of the experimental process. Then, another experimental approach is compelled to
be found. The following attempt is a variation of the Two-Load Method.

51



3.4 Second approach: the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion - about its failure

The Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion differs from the previous approach in just a single
aspect: the TAC orientation is inverted for one of the acoustic loads. The idea behind this attempt is
to increase the independence between the two systems of two equations, as an additional contrast
is imposed between the two set of measurements besides the difference on the two acoustic loads.
The higher such contrast is, the lower the expected sensitivities to transfer function variations are.

3.4.1 Principle of the method

In essence, the same method as previous is once again applied, contextualized in the same
black box concept, just like in Section 3.3. That means that two sets of measurements involving
two different acoustic loads are acquired. Nevertheless, the difference is that the TAC orientation is
inverted for the first set of measurements (see Fig. 3.10), while the second set is kept as described
in Subsection 3.3.2, referred to as the direct orientation. Order-of-inversion or opening/closing the
TAC extremity is arbitrary.

Figure 3.10: Sketch of the inverted ThermoAcoustic Core.

This inversion procedure must be accompanied by a proper adjustment in the corresponding
analytical expressions. The sole alteration in the equations is the inter-exchange of the positions
xl and xr, since they are fixed to their original positions. Such exchange is therefore no longer
coherent to the in situ meaning of left and right orientation, from the experimentalist viewpoint.

52



For the inverted TAC, the TTAC must be also inverted to maintain the same coefficients as in
the direct orientation:

3.4.2 Experimental procedures

Experiments are conducted for the Stainless Steel Grids configuration, as the Two-load
Method fails with this material. For these experiments, no heating power is supplied to the HHX
(QH = 0 W ). This simple configuration allows the estimation of the reciprocity. It is then pos-
sible to evaluate if this method is suitable using further measurements for various heat power levels.

54



The Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion requires special care relying on the successive
connection and disconnection between the TAC and the waveguides, to proceed with the change on
the TAC orientation before every new set of measurements. All joints are cleaned, re-greased, and
well adjusted to avoid as much as possible length variations caused by clearances.

frequency domain for QH = 0 W - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion (bold lines), Two-Load
Method (thin lines) and Theory (dashed lines).

all of these figures the corresponding curves of the first approach are included, for comparison.
The results of this second method vastly differ from those obtained with the Two-Load Method.
Both amplitudes and phases are far more biased, but are less noisy - as can be verified in both
logarithmic and linear scales (Fig. 3.12). Moreover, a particular resonance frequency is clearly
revealed at 134 Hz either on the amplitudes or phases, which is not obtained with the previous
method. Concerning the reciprocity statistical parameters, on the other hand, the Two-Load Method
with TAC Inversion leads to an average value rc = 0.243?1.727i with a standard deviation ?rc =
3.787 + 4.238i, which indicates very poor performance not only for bias level but also for noise
level, as ?rc is so far from 0. This is an apparent contradiction that calls for further investigation. It

is worth noting that this issue is not found in the first approach since its resulting TTAC coefficients
behave accordingly to their corresponding rc = 0.996 + 0.005i and ?rc = 0.134 + 0.123i.

Finally, the high magnitude of such discrepancy between the two methods requires putting
forward a sensitivity analysis, to investigate its origins, as shown in the following.

3.5 Sensitivity analysis for both Two-Load Methods (with and without TAC inver-
sion)

The discrepancies observed in results obtained with the different two-load methods require
a sensitivity analysis for a more profound comprehension of such a behavior. Arbitrary noise and
bias are then inserted into the theoretical transfer functions H? obtained from the modeling given
in Chapter 2. Two kinds of material are tested: the Ceramic Catalyst and the Stainless Steel Grids.
These materials are described by their respective geometrical parameters which are the average
pore radius rs, the porosity ? and the length ` (see Table 3.1). In the case of the Stainless Steel
Grids, the estimated porosity (?) and the estimated representative average cylindrical pore radius
(rs) are obtained from the very noisy TTAC coefficients previously measured with the Two-Load
Method without TAC inversion, using a specific method developed by Guedra (2012b).

58



The noise is theoretically taken into account by adding a random amplitude AnFr and a ran-
dom phase PnFr to the amplitude and phase of the theoretical transfer function H?, where An and
Pn are arbitrary amplitude and phase of the noise level, respectively, and where Fr is a random
function whose values are uniformly distributed in an interval constrained between ?1 and 1.The
choice of a uniform distribution is found to be better than a Gaussian one since it avoids unreal-
istic values, which may be present whenever the aleatory numerical generation is not constrained.
The noisy transfer function is then calculated as below for each frequency i individually, with the
random function F ir being required accordingly,

H?inoise = |H?
i|(1 + AnF ir)e

j(?(H?i)+PnF
i
r), (3.50)

Concerning the bias, the same disturbance is uniformly applied to the whole spectra. The
biased transfer function is then obtained as below,

H?bias = |H?|(1 + Ab)ej(?(H?)+Pb), (3.51)

where Ab and Pb are the respective amplitude and phase of the bias level. Both Ab and Pb are
either added or subtracted, thus developing four combinations of bias.

The following values are used along the entire sensitivity analysis: An = 0.1, Pn = 0.03?
rad, Ab = 0.1 and Pb = 0.03? rad. They are chosen compromisingly to comparative intents, as
previously.

The four curves corresponding to the four combinations of bias are plotted as solid curves
in all graphs of sensitivity analysis. Concerning the noise presentation, however, five curves are
plotted per graph with the intent of a clear illustration. They differ by their aleatory nature and are
presented as dotted lines. These graphic results are shown in the next eight figures, where both two-
load methods can be compared for the Ceramic Catalyst and for the Stainless Steel Grids. Figs. 3.15
and 3.16 give the amplitudes and phases of TTAC coefficients when estimated with classical Two-
Load Method, while Figs. 3.17 and 3.18 are the corresponding results for the Two-Load Method
with TAC Inversion. Likewise, Figs. 3.19 to 3.22 treat the Stainless Steel grids case.

59



From Figs. 3.15 to 3.18, it is clear that the Two-Load Method overcomes the Two-Load
Method with TAC Inversion when applied to a stack-like material. Either amplitude or phase of both
noise and bias achieve a very symmetrical behavior with respect to the theory, and they also enclose
quite well the experimental curves, which on its turn fits closely along the theoretical curves.

Method.

In the case of the pile of Stainless Steel Grids, as shown in Figs. 3.19 and 3.20, the exper-
imental results obtained with the two-load method without inversion, despite of being poor, are
closer to the theoretical curves than the bias and the noise ones. That suggests a quality of mea-
surements good enough to minimize the effects of both sensitivities; however, as the sensitivity to
noise is specially high, the experimental curves still result noisy, even though much less than the
theoretical noise curves. In principle, that could be just a matter of setting up other values for An
and Pn, but those parameters are chosen the same for all cases, as mentioned before, to standardize
all comparisons.

bias (four thin solid lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method.

Figs. 3.21 and 3.22 reveal a high sensitivity to bias of the Two-Load Method with TAC
Inversion, which is in accordance with the reciprocity results. A highlighted resonance peak at
around 134 Hz appears in both experimental and biased curves. However, despite already having
input high levels for Ab and Pb, the experimental peak is still much higher than the biased one (by
a factor of 10). That incites for seeing how coherent the curves are for the previous approach, i.e.
the two-load method without inversion. About the noisy curves, they are closer to the theoretical
reference than the biased ones, as predicted in the reciprocity results. Furthermore, they reveal
a little higher sensitivity in the region between 50 Hz to 70 Hz, what is indeed shown in the
experimental curves.

QH = 0 W in bold lines for the theory (dashed) with the respective theoretical bias (four thin solid
lines per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion.

This scenario implies to distrust the biased experimental curves from the Two-Load Method
with TAC Inversion not only because of their evident low quality, but also because of a possible
error intrinsic to the experimental procedures, since such intense effect does not occur for the
Two-Load Method without inversion. One plausible explanation for that is supported by a critical
experimental contrast between those methods. The second approach is much more risky than the
first one since it requires the actual physical inversion of the TAC, what certainly adds errors
in the measurements by the unavoidable variations on positioning. If this issue is solved by a
more precise coupling in the TAC connections, the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion could
potentially be better than the Two-Load Method, as its sensitivity is much smaller to noise along
the whole spectra of analysis. That may be advantageous enough to overcome the higher sensitivity
to bias, since this one is restricted to a much smaller frequency interval.

0 W in bold lines for the theory (dashed) with the respective theoretical bias (four thin solid lines
per graph) and noise (five dotted lines per graph). - Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion.

In conclusion, the Two-Load Method is indeed much more sensitive to noise than the Two-
Load Method with TAC Inversion for this kind of material, i.e. a regenerator. Regarding the bias
curves, both methods show similar behavior, in the same level of disturbance.

Alternatively, another possibility would be to use a two-source method instead of a two-load
method. The two-source method basically consists of using an anechoic termination as a load, and
proceeding with two measurements with TAC inversion. However, we did not choose to investigate
the method, notably because it might have the same drawbacks as the two former methods, which
are intrinsic to multiple microphones methods.

At this point, the search for a third approach is justified since the regenerator-based TAC
is not plentifully modeled nor characterized, by far. The Impedance Method is presented in the
following Section 3.6.

3.6 Third approach: the Impedance Method

Aiming to solve the problem of characterizing the TAC filled with a material exhibiting a low
porosity, as the Stainless Steel Grids, an alternative method is here developed.

Method.

The Impedance Method consists of obtaining the TTAC coefficients from the measurement of
the impedance matrix ZTAC (Bannwart et al., 2012, 2013). All measurements are made by means
of a specific device called the Acoustic Impedance Sensor (AIS) (Le Roux, 2012) - shown in Figs.
3.23 and 3.26 - coupled to the TAC under test (Figs. 3.24 and C.1). This alternative method is more
direct than either previous approaches since there is no need to account for plane wave propagation
in some ducts surrounding the TAC, and there are no limitations in the frequency range of analysis
relative to the distance between microphones (Boden, 1986).

Figure 3.23: Front and back views of the AIS, and the AIS with the Adaptive Part.

The ZTAC coefficients are obtained from two sets of measurements, since the TAC is asym-
metrical (see Framework solution for the two-port system, in Section 3.2). That means that Eq.
(3.52) provides two equations and four unknowns, and thus it requires two different setup arrange-
ments to fulfill the 2 × 2 deterministic system, just as in the previous approaches. Unlike those
approaches, however, the Impedance Method does not require two different acoustic loads; instead,
the only difference between the first and the second measurement is the TAC orientation, which is
inverted for the second measurement.

In the first measurement, the AIS is attached to the left side of the TAC, which is referred to
as the position xl aside of the porous material (see Figs. 3.24). In the second measurement, the AIS
is placed at the opposite side, referred to as the right position xr.

In this case, the rigid wall is set at xr, and the approximation u?2ndl ? 0 can be made. Doing
so allows finding the remaining coefficients of the second column of ZTAC:

where Z1stinp and Z2ndinp are the input impedances at the TAC entry for the first and second
measurements, whereas Z1stT and Z

2nd
T are the transfer impedances of the TAC, respective for to

each measurement as well.

The Acoustic Impedance Sensor - AIS

A schematic drawing and photographs of the experimental apparatus used for the determina-
tion of the impedance matrix of a thermoacoustic core are shown in Figs. 3.24 and 3.23. The AIS
itself consists of a piezoelectric buzzer loaded by a small cavity on its rear face and radiating to-
wards a short duct on its front face, as shown in detail in Fig. 3.26. Two microphones (labeled Mic.1
and Mic. 2) are flush-mounted along the wall at both sides of the piezoelectric buzzer. The front
cavity of the impedance sensor is coupled to one end of the TAC under test. The other end of the
TAC is closed by a rigid wall. Mic.1 measures the pressure p1(t) inside the rear cavity, while Mic.2
measures the pressure p2(t) in the front duct. A third microphone (labeled Mic.3), flush-mounted
in the center of the closing rigid wall, measures the pressure p3(t) at the end of the TAC. At low
frequencies, below the first resonance of the rear cavity, the pressure is uniform in the cavity and
p1(t) is proportional to the volume velocity u(t) produced by the buzzer. Then, from the measure-
ment of pressures p1(t) and p2(t), and taking into account the acoustic propagation along the front
duct, the first measurement configuration (AIS coupled to the left side of the TAC) leads to the
calculation of pressure p?l and volume velocity u?l at the reference plane located at x = xl, while the
second configuration (AIS coupled to the right side of the TAC) leads to the calculation of pressure
p?r and velocity u?r at the reference plane, this time located at x = xr. Those measurements lead to
the estimation of the input acoustic impedances Z1stinp (or Z11) and Z2ndinp (or Z22), according to Eqs.
3.58 and 3.62 respectively. The transfer impedances Z1stT (or Z21) and Z

2nd
T (or Z12) are obtained

from measurements of p3(t) = p(xr, t) and p3(t) = p(xl, t) respectively, in accordance Eqs. 3.59
and 3.61.

In order to not be restricted to very low frequencies and gain precision, more refined
impedance expressions account for the microphone positions relative to the reference plane, the
microphone sensitivity differences, and all geometrical dimensions concerning the AIS ducts (see
Fig. 3.26). The Z-matrix coefficients Zinp and ZT for both first and second set of measurements
are generally expressed as follows, as if there were no need for an Adaptive Part to connect the
TAC (see Fig. 3.24), nor any relevant waveguide discontinuity. These equations (Macaluso, 2011;
Le Roux, 2012) take as reference plane the position just at the exit of the AIS, with Lap = 0. To
distinguish those generalized impedances from the actual impedances with a real Adaptive Part
(Lap &gt; 0), they are here assigned as Z

?
inp and Z

?
T .

tions, while K and KT are related to the calibration of the device (Macaluso, 2011; Le Roux, 2012).

wavenumber k = 2?f/c does not account for losses in such small environments, with frequency f
in Hz and speed of sound c ? 344 m/s at 22 ºC; and the sensitivities s?1, s?2 and s?3 correspond to
the three microphones.

The calibration process is, at first, to remove the TAC and close the acoustic impedance
sensor by the rigid plate that supports the microphone 3 (see Fig. mic3). The transfer functions H?21
and H?31 are then measured and here labeled with the subscript “cal”. As a consequence of such
a configuration, the impedance at the reference plane is the same as the transfer impedance to the
microphone 3 due to the fact that the position is coincident. Assuming 1/Z11,cal = 1/Z21,cal ? 0
leads to K = ?H?21,cal and KT = H?31,cal (Macaluso, 2011). Therefore, as a final result of the
calibration, the parameters K and KT are obtained from the measurements of H?21,cal and H?31,cal,
and both ratios of sensitivity s?2/s?1 and s?3/s?1 are implicitly taken into account. The substitution of
K and KT into Eqs. (3.64) and (3.65) gives

Consideration of the waveguide discontinuity

The AIS used in this work delivers the acoustic excitation to the TAC under an important
geometrical discontinuity. That comes from the sudden diameter variation between the AIS exit
and the Adaptive Part, which is from 16 mm to 33.9 mm in an angle of 90 degrees (see Figs. 3.26
and 3.24). The resulting effect is an additional impedance that is here taken into account to improve
the measurements accuracy. This impedance is labeled Zdis, and it is subtracted from the first hand
measured input impedances by the AIS, so that to obtain the corrected ZTAC coefficients, which,
for instance, do not account for the Adaptive Part yet.

Zdis is calculated according to the following algorithm (Kergomard, 1987):

• Rmin is the minimal value between r2/rap and rap/r2, where r2 is the AIS front cavity
radius and rap is the Adaptive Part radius;

• If Rmin 6 0.55

then kcor = 0.82(1 ? 1.35Rmin + 0.31R3min), with kcor being the corrected wavenumber;

? else kcor =
4

?
R2min1[0.5035 ? 0.492log(Rmin1) ? 0.376R2min1 ? 0.852R2min1log(Rmin1)],

where Rmin1 = 1 ?Rmin;

• If r2 6 rap

then lcor = kcorrap/Rmin, where lcor is the equivalent length;

74



? else lcor = kcorrap;

• Concluding, Zdis results in

Zdis =
jk0lcor
Sap?c

, (3.73)

where k0 is the wavenumber without losses, Sap = ?r2ap, and ? is the average gas density.

Applying Zdis into Eqs. (3.71) and (3.72),

. (3.75)

Nevertheless, an Adaptive Part must be provided to connect the AIS to the specific system
under analysis, which is the TAC in this study. The Adaptive Part is specifically designed for that,
and consists in a short waveguide section of 22 mm length and same diameter as the TAC ends.
Therefore, its acoustical effects are not negligible, reminding that the TAC length is only 460 mm.

Consideration of the Adaptive Part

In order to take into account the length of the Adaptive Part, which is Lap = 22mm, the
reference plane is established in between this part and the TAC, as shown in Figs. 3.23, 3.24 and
3.26. That requires changing the reference plane from the AIS exit to the TAC input, which may be
at the position xr or xl, depending on whether the TAC is inverted or not, respectively. The resulting
expressions are:

Final equations for the ZTAC and the TTAC coefficients

Substituting Eqs. (3.74) and (3.75) into Eqs. (3.76) and (3.77), and also rearranging the re-
sulting equations to make explicit the first and second measurements, each ZTAC coefficient is
described as follows:

Finally, the substitution of the ZTAC coefficients into Eqs. (3.53) to (3.56) leads to the deter-
mination of TTAC.

3.6.2 Sensitivity analysis for the Impedance Method

Before starting with the actual measurements, a sensitivity analysis for the Impedance
Method is put forward. That way, if not promising, this third attempt would be dismissed and
another solution would be researched. Just like the previous approaches, the same procedures are
here applied, except that, instead of adding noise and bias into the theoretical transfer functions,
those disturbances are inserted into the theoretical impedances. Thus, Eqs. (3.50) and (3.51) turn
into the equivalent ones below:

Zinoise = |Z
i|(1 + AnF ir)e

j(?(Zi)+PnFir), (3.82)

Zbias = |Z|(1 + Ab)ej(?(Z)+Pb), (3.83)

with An, Ab, Pn and Pb being setup at the same levels as for the previous two approaches.

The results are explored in the next four figures from 3.27 to 3.30, handling the Stainless Steel
Grids and the Ceramic Catalyst as well. The frequency range chosen for this sensitivity analysis
is the same as for the previous approaches, from 50 to 200 Hz, despite of the fact that the actually
measured frequency range is much wider, from 30 to 500 Hz. That way, performance comparisons
can be made under uniform basis.

Figures 3.27 and 3.28 present a smaller sensitivity to noise and bias for the Stainless Steel
Grids in comparison with the previous two-load approaches. That encourages to proceed with ac-
tual measurements, which are beforehand presented in these figures by practical purposes, as a
matter of fact. The experimental curves behave in good agreement to the semi-theoretical ones,
and they are also coherently within the sensitivity constraints. Indeed, the reciprocity parameters
rc = 1.004 + 0.009i and ?rc = 0.008 + 0.007i contribute to verify such agreement. Therefore, at
least for a regenerator-like material so far, the Impedance Method is surely proved to be perform-
ing. To continue with this method evaluation, a stack-like material - namely the Ceramic Catalyst -
is investigated in the following.

Method.

Finally, as the conclusive part of the sensitivity analysis, Figs. 3.29 and 3.30 reveal that the
Impedance Method is also promising for stack-like materials. The sensitivity predictions for noise
and bias are even better than for the Two-Load Method, as it may be clearly seen. To support this,
the experimental curves for the Ceramic Catalyst (beforehand presented) behave in good agreement
with the purely theoretical ones. For this material, are recorded the best reciprocity parameters
within the 50 to 200 Hz range in this investigation: rc = 1.002 ? 0.001i and ?rc = 0.001 + 0.002i
(see Table 3.2).

To conclude the sensitivity analysis for the Impedance Method and also embracing Section
3.5, the Impedance Method is the best method among the three methods tested, as it is the least

sensitive to noise and bias, and as it covers both stack-like and regenerator-like materials. Relying
on these results, the Impedance Method is used for subsequent works. In particular, other materials
can be tested as stack/regenerator, such as NiCr Foam and RVC Foam.

3.6.3 Experimental setup and procedures

The experimental procedure for the measurement of the impedance matrix ZTAC is described
below. Each sample is heated by means of a heat power supply QH increasing from 0 up to 81 W
by steps of 9 W . The measurements are made for each heat condition for the first configuration

(AIS coupled to the left side of the TAC, see Fig. 3.24, “Measurement 1”). Afterwards, the heat
power supply is turned off. The TAC is then naturally cooled and it reaches the ambient tem-
perature homogeneously after a few hours. Subsequently, the impedance sensor is inverted (see
Fig. 3.24, “Measurement 2”) and the same sequence of measurements is applied, following the
same rising heat supplies and keeping the same time intervals between them, in order to obtain
a thermal field inside the TAC as similar as possible to the one obtained in the previous set of
measurements. Nevertheless, this procedure may be sensitive to ambient temperature variations,
or even pressure variations, as the total duration of both sequences of measurements takes several
hours. But proceeding this way leads to the best results. As with the previous approaches, all tran-
sient thermal guidelines stated in Appendix A are here respected as well. As explained before, the
acoustic impedance sensor allows measurements in a much wider frequency range than the Two-

81



Load Method does. Hence, it is chosen to investigate the problem within the interval between 30
to 500 Hz, by steps of 1 Hz. This allows investigation of a wide range of operating frequencies
for different engines configurations. Those results are displayed in the following (Subsection 3.6.4)
and in also Appendix D.

3.6.4 Results

In this section, results are given for TAC made of a pile of Stainless Steel Grids, a Ceramic
Catalyst, a NiCr Foam (Fig. 3.31) and a RVC Foam (Fig. 3.32). Table 3.2 reports rc and ?rc
for all four materials in two frequency ranges: from 50 to 200 Hz, for comparisons with results
of the previous approaches (also included), and from 30 to 500 Hz, which is the range actually
here covered by the Impedance Method. That way, a clear overview of performances of all three
approaches is provided. Columns 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the respective three approaches and refer
to the narrower frequency range; they consist of results already discussed in the sensitivity analysis
(see Section 3.5 and Subsection 3.6.2). The last column, on the other hand, concerns the Impedance
Method for the wider frequency range. The Impedance Method provides the best results in all cases,
no matter the material kind or frequency range. When comparing third and fourth columns, one can
realize a slight decrease in performance for the wider frequency range - particularly for the ?rc
values - that indicates some additional noise effects. Indeed, such effects are predictable since the
wider frequency range reaches a lower limit, 30 Hz; this additional interval from 30 to 49 Hz is
more susceptible to external influences like the noise from the water pump, for example. However,
those ?rc values are still low and the reciprocity is considered verified either way.

The resulting TTAC coefficients, deduced from ZTAC measurements, are shown below fol-
lowing the same sequence of Table 3.2, in the frequency range from 30 to 500 Hz. Only three
heating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 36 W and Q = 72 W ) are shown in this section, for the sake of
clarity, just like for the results of the first approach. However, the RVC Foam requires lowering the
upper limit of heat input, to avoid its spontaneous combustion, as the whole experimentation is in
the presence of atmospheric air. That ended up in lower heating conditions (QH = 0, QH = 9 W
and QH = 18 W ), according to a specific investigation that led to this finding: measuring the
steady state temperature just aside of the HHX, by means of a thermocouple (Fig. 3.33), the tem-
perature reached ? 230°C for QH = 15 W , and ? 262°C for QH = 18 W ; hence, a next step of

83



QH = 21 W would have been risky since the temperature limit for the RVC Foam integrity in the
presence of oxygen is around 300°C.

3.6.5 Discussion and comparative analysis with the previous approaches

All curves for QH = 0 W presented in Figs. 3.34, 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37 behave coherently
with their corresponding reciprocity parameters, which are presented in Table 3.2. The fact that
- for all materials - rc is close to unity and ?rc is very low gives consistency to the Impedance

88



Method. Either bias or noise level is low, hence. Such consistency leads to assume that the same
quality is achieved for the heated measurements as well, since the same experimental procedures
are undertaken, and besides, to consider the thermal effects due to the condition QH &gt; 0, the
transient constraints achieved in Appendix A are here respected as much as for the first approach.

An interesting aspect to note is that ?rc for the Stainless Steel Grids behaves differently than
for the other three materials. In fact, it is much bigger, although still small enough to not turn
those measurements noisy. That means the TTAC coefficients of the Stainless Steel Grids have a
higher noise level than those of the other materials. Indeed, when visually comparing the curves
of Figs. 3.34, 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37, the Stainless Steel Grids case is clearly the most noisy among
all four materials, seeming to follow ?rc proportionally. This behavior is also in agreement with
the theoretical curves of sensitivity analysis, shown in Figs. 3.27, 3.28, 3.29 and 3.30, where the
sensitivity to noise is revealed higher for the Stainless Steel Grids than for the Ceramic Catalyst.

Another way to compare those results is to display amplitude and phase of the reciprocity
spectrum for the four materials (Fig. 3.38). They behave accordingly both to the comparison above
and to the Table 3.2, where the Stainless Steel Grids results are more noisy than the ones for the
other materials. However, when comparing those results with the ones obtained by the Two-Load
Method (Fig. 3.39) - also for the Stainless Steel Grids - it gets clear once more how advantageous
the Impedance Method is. Not only in qualitative aspects, but also because of its easier way to
cover a wider frequency range, as is does not depend on fitting waveguide lengths nor microphones
positioning to cover specific frequency ranges of interest.

In the case of the Ceramic Catalyst, amplitude and phase of reciprocity are displayed in
Fig. 3.40 for both Impedance Method and Two-Load Method. Both also behave coherently to the
sensitivity analysis and Table 3.2. Similar low noise levels are achieved, whereas the Two-Load
Method results are a little more biased for both amplitude and phase, besides the fact that they
reach a narrower frequency range.

3.7 Conclusion

The Two-Load Method, either with or without the inversion of the TAC, is not capable of
characterization of low porosity materials such as the here tested stacked steel grids - at least for
the length of this case-study, which is significantly longer than typical ones used in thermoacoustic
systems.

92



In both cases, a high level of sensitivity to noise (first case) and to bias (second case) is
verified experimentally and also confirmed by a numerical simulation. Such accordance between
these approaches validates one each other, in fact.

Thus, an alternative method based on the impedance matrix measurement has been de-
veloped, which leads to the T-matrix coefficients of the TAC. This method, called "Impedance
Method", lead to good results for both stack and regenerator. The low average value of reciprocity
and the corresponding standard deviation for QW = 0 is an indicator of the measurement quality.

This method has been used to characterize different materials which can be anticipated to
behave as "stack" or "regenerator" (respective Ceramic Catalyst and Stainless Steel Grids), or in
between "stack" and "regenerator" (NiCr Foam and RVC Foam).

The knowledge of the T-matrix coefficients of the TAC at different heating conditions can
now be used to determine both the operating frequency fop and the intrinsic thermoacoustic ampli-
fication gain G in a thermoacoustic engine. This application of the Impedance Method is discussed
in the next chapter.

4 APLICATION TO THE DESIGN OF THERMOACOUSTIC ENGINES

4.1 Introduction

An experimental method allowing the measurement of the T-matrix coefficients of a TAC at
different heating conditions has been presented in the previous chapter. The knowledge of these
coefficients can be used to predict both the heat power supply and the operating frequency which
correspond to the onset of self-sustained acoustic waves in a thermoacoustic engine equipped with
the TAC characterized beforehand, as done by Guedra et al. (2011). It is however worth mention-
ing that such a task requires having made the T-matrix measurements for numerous values of heat
power supply QH, since the accuracy of the predictions of onset is directly related to the step of
heat supply ?Q between two set of measurements. An alternative but similar approach consists in
developing an adequate modeling which would predict both the operating frequency fop. and the
intrinsic thermoacoustic amplification gain G associated both to a given heat power QH supplied
to the TAC and to the respective geometry of each element surrounding this TAC. This chapter
presents a general modeling method (Bannwart et al., 2013) based on this alternative approach,
which allows calculation of both the operating frequency fop. and the thermoacoustic gain G in a
thermoacoustic engine from the measured T-matrix components of a given TAC under a given heat
power supply QH; this approach also leads hence to the determination of the onset of self-sustained
oscillations, whose accuracy depends on the step of heat supply ?Q as well. An optimization of the
geometric parameters of each element surrounding the TAC can be then performed by searching
the geometrical configuration leading to a maximum value of the gain G. Thereby, this modeling
method allows comparison of the potential performances of the different sample materials charac-
terized in Section 3.6, taking G as the main comparative parameter. This method is applied in the
following to the optimization of the performances of a simple standing-wave and a simple closed-
loop engine (see Fig. 4.1), but it is also easily applicable to a more complicated engine such as the
one of Fig. 1.1. Aiming to achieve the best results possible in this work, all experimental data used
in this chapter are the ones obtained from the Impedance Method.

Figure 4.1: Basic configurations for standing-wave and closed-loop engines.

4.2 Theory

Two simple thermoacoustic engines are here considered, and they are depicted in Fig. 4.1.
The first one is a standing-wave engine which basically consists of the TAC surrounded by two
straight ducts closed by rigid ends. The second one is made of a closed-loop, containing the TAC,
connected to a straight duct. It is worth noting that in the configuration of the closed-loop engine,
it is assumed that the curvature of the waveguide, and especially that of the TAC, has no impact on
the propagation of acoustic waves.

4.2.1 Standing-wave engine

First, the standing wave engine of Fig. 4.1 is taken into consideration. Two straight ducts of
lengths L1 and L2 are connected to the TAC. These ducts have the same inner diameter than the
TAC. Assuming the propagation of plane acoustic waves at angular frequency ?, it is possible to
relate the acoustic pressure p?L and volume velocity u?L at position x = L to the pressure p?0 and

96



volume velocity u?0 at position x = 0 as follows:

are the complex wavenumber and the characteristic impedance of the ducts, respectively. In
Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4), ?0 is the fluid density at room temperature, c0 is the adiabatic sound speed,
? is the specific heat ratio of the fluid, S is the duct cross-sectional area, and the functions f? and
f? characterize the thermal and viscous coupling between the oscillating fluid and the duct walls
(Swift, 2002; Arnott et al., 1991). Then, taking into account that u?L = 0 (rigid termination), one
gets (

from which one can write the reflected acoustic impedance at position x = 0:

. (4.6)

The knowledge of this reflected acoustic impedance Z0 = Z0(L1,L2,QH,?) can be used
to determine the resonance frequencies of the complete device. In particular, if the left side of the
engine is also terminated by a rigid plug (infinite impedance), then the principle of impedance
matching tells that the resonance frequencies correspond to the maxima of |Z0| (these maxima
should tend towards infinity if losses were neglected). As an illustrative example, the modulus of
Z0 and its real part are presented for three levels of heat supply in Fig. 4.2 as a function of the

97



frequency in the particular case when L1 and L2 are fixed to 160 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The
reflected impedance Z0 is calculated using the experimental transfer matrix TTAC of the ceramic
stack previously determined under different levels of heat power supply.

Figure 4.2: Ceramic Catalyst: modulus and real part of the reflected acoustic impedance for QH =
9W (dash-dotted line), QH = 18 W (dashed line), and QH = 27 W (solid line).

From the analysis of |Z0|, it appears that the first resonance frequency fop. of the system
is around 80 Hz, and that it tends to increase with heating. Moreover, the quality factor of the
resonance (which is inversely proportional to the width of the resonance peak) increases as QH
increases from 9 to 18 W . This is consistent with our expectations since the quality factor should
tend towards infinity as the system approaches the threshold of thermoacoustic instability (Atchley
et al., 1992). However, the width of the resonance peak increases as QH increases from 18 to
27 W , which seems surprising at first sight. Actually, this means that the system is above threshold
for QH = 27 W so that the width of the resonance peak is no longer related to the quality factor
of the resonance: this quality factor should become negative through onset (Atchley, 1994a), for

98



which the net attenuation of sound becomes negative. Additional insight arises from the analysis
of&amp;lt;(Z0) at resonant frequency fop., leading to the same conclusions: if QH ? 18 W , the real part
of Z0(fop.) is positive which means that work is absorbed by the device, but for QH = 27 W the
real part of Z0 becomes negative which means that work is produced by the system (Hatori et al.,
2012). In other words, if QH = 27 W the system is above threshold, and self-sustained acoustic
waves should oscillate at frequency fop. (in as much as it is considered that the generation of large
amplitude acoustic oscillations does not induce variations of the temperature field inside the TAC
with subsequent variations of its transfer matrix).

(L1 = 160 cm and L2 = 10 cm).

Once the reflected impedance Z0 is determined, the resonance frequencies of the device are
known. It is then possible to choose a particular working frequency and to calculate a thermoa-
coustic amplification gain associated to the acoustic mode under consideration. Let’s assume that
the operating angular frequency ?op. is fixed to that of the first acoustic mode (which is gener-
ally the most unstable mode). Assuming as well that the acoustic pressure p?0 at position x = 0 is
fixed to some arbitrary value P0, from which one easily gets the corresponding volume velocity
u?0 = P0/Z0, together with the acoustic pressures and volume velocities at positions xl, xr and L
(which are deduced from u?0, p?0 and the T-matrices T1, TTAC, and T2). Therefore, it is possible to
calculate the acoustic power

their ratio does not. Then, a thermoacoustic amplification gain G can be defined as follows:

G =
WTAC
|Wloss|

. (4.9)

This parameter G has the meaning of an energy balance in the system: if G &gt; 1, then the
acoustic work produced by thermoacoustic effect in the TAC is higher than the losses in the re-
maining of the device, so that the extra work can be provided to an acoustic load.

The results obtained for the frequency of operation fop. and the corresponding thermoacoustic
amplification gain G are reported in Tab. 4.1: the engine under consideration is a standing wave
engine equipped with a ceramic catalyst stack, while L1 and L2 are fixed to 160 cm and 10 cm,
respectively. The calculations of G are consistent with the conclusion mentioned above that the
heat supply corresponding to onset threshold (G = 1) is between 18 and 27 W .

4.2.2 Closed-loop engine

The same kind of analysis as the one presented above can be used in the case of a closed-loop
engine (see Fig. 4.1) which is the basic geometrical configuration encountered in thermoacoustic
Stirling engines that use a regenerator instead of a stack. As in Subsection 4.2.1, the first step
consists in determining the reflected impedance Z0 from the T-matrices T1,2 and TTAC. After a
few calculations, one gets

Z0 =
BppZ2 + Bpu
BupZ2 + Buu

4.3 Calculation of G and fop. from experimental data

As soon as the experimental transfer matrix of a given thermoacoustic core is measured for
various heating conditions, an optimization of the thermoacoustic amplification gain can be done
thanks to the theory given in the previous section. This optimization is achieved for a given heat
power supply by searching the geometry of the thermoacoustic device which leads to a maximum
value for G. In our case study, this amounts to determining the optimal lengths L1 and L2 within
their respective arbitrary ranges, which are for instance bounded by the frequency limits, i.e. from
30 to 500 Hz in our measurements. However, for illustration purposes, it is chosen to show G and
fop. for a narrower interval, from 30 to 250 Hz, as the optimal G is still embraced in all cases. This
optimization is done for each one of the four thermoacoustic cores made of different materials.
Nevertheless, before presenting these results, a comparison is put forward regarding a theoretical
transfer matrix in Subsection 4.3.1. In this comparison, it is also shown the advantage of post-
treating the experimental data with least squares regression to a polynomial.

4.3.1 Comparison between results from theoretical and experimental data

The validity of the measured TTAC by the Impedance Method for both stack-like and
regenerator-like porous material has been already proved in Chapter 3. However, in order to il-
lustrate and reverify the accuracy of those experimental data and, reciprocally, the accuracy of the
theoretical model for stack-like materials, a comparison between results beyond just the TTAC co-
efficients is here put forward. G and fop. are calculated from data of both origins and compared.
The Ceramic Catalyst is the chosen material for that since its geometrical simplicity allows to have
a reliable theoretical modeling for its non-heated TTAC, as discussed in Chapter 2. Therefore, the
experimental data are for non-heated TTAC as well. As the Ceramic Catalyst is a stack, the most
appropriate engine for this study is the standing-wave kind, which is shown in Fig. 4.1.

Figure 4.3 shows the theoretical fop. for the first resonance mode as function of the variable
lengths 0.6 m ? L1 ? 4 m and 0 m ? L2 ? 0.4 m. These intervals are chosen according to
the need for a good graphical resolution for the experimental results, which are displayed in the
following of these theoretical ones. The number of points per interval are, respectively, 60 and 40,
what gives a total of 2400 combinations of engines per analysis. The corresponding G is shown in
Fig. 4.4. As these surfaces are calculated from theoretical data, they are smooth.

Figure 4.3: Theoretical fop. for standing-wave engines at QH = 0 W for the Ceramic Catalyst.

The corresponding fop. and G from experimental data are very close - but evidently not iden-
tical - to previous, as one would expected. For the sake of simplicity, however, only the G surface
is here presented (Fig. 4.5). When comparing Figs. 4.4 and 4.5, it is visible some small level of
noise in the measured G, which is intrinsic to experimental data and coherent to the results of the
sensitivity analysis of Subsection 3.6.2, and to the reciprocity parameters of Tables 3.2 and 4.2.
One interesting aspect to note, however, is the non-negligible difference in the optimal G between
both the cases. As expected by theory, the maximal G for QH = 0W results negative (?0.383), as
there is no thermoacoustic production when the temperature gradient along the TAC is zero. That
is why this maximal G can reach values close to zero, but still negative. On the other hand, the
maximal G from experimental data results positive (0.166). This is due to irregularities in the G
surface. Nevertheless, such roughness can be minimized by applying a least squares regression to
a polynomial into the measured transfer functions from which the TTAC coefficients are calculated.
The polynomial regression with the best results in this investigation is of fifth degree, which leads to
better and smoother surfaces such as of Fig. 4.6. This polynomial regression (or curve fitting), when
applied to the theoretical case does not lead to significant changes, what is interesting with respect
to the data quality preservation. Hence, that contributes to the reliability of the already significant
improvement in the experimental case (see Table 4.2). Therefore, the polynomial regression of fifth
degree is adopted as regular procedure to all following calculations of optimal G or fop..

4.3.2 Standing-wave engines for QH &gt; 0

For the standing-wave configuration, optimization results are given in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8 for
the case of the Ceramic Catalyst with the maximum value of heat supply QH = 81 W . Figure
4.7 shows the evolution of the operating frequency fop., and Fig. 4.8 shows the corresponding
thermoacoustic amplification gain G as a function of the variable lengths 0.6 m ? L1 ? 4 m
and 0 m ? L2 ? 0.4 m. For each configuration (in terms of L1 and L2), the operating frequency
fop. is searched around the first resonance mode (although higher order modes might become
more unstable for some values of the lengths L1 and L2). To ensure this search, an approximate
prediction of the resonant frequency is estimated taking into account the sound speed evolution
with the increase in the heating supply QH, so that the range of frequency around the resonance
can be better adjusted; this procedure is repeated for of each thermal condition. In the case
of QH = 81W , a peak value of G = 3.31 is reached with L1 = 1.06 m and L2 = 0 m, at
fop. = 121 Hz. It is worth mentioning that the obtained value for the “optimum” length L2
equals 0, which is equivalent to closing the right side of the TAC by a rigid plug: this result
suggests that the length of the Thermal Buffer Tube of the TAC under test is too long (in the
sense that if a shorter TBT had been used, a non-zero optimal length L2 might have been expected).

The same analysis is done for the other three materials, and results are summarized in Table
4.3. None of them reaches the thermoacoustic outbreak, as their optimal gain are below the unity. In
the case of the Nichrome Foam, the maximum G is not so smaller than 1, which is consistent with
this material geometrical properties (see Tab. 3.1), closer to the ones of the Ceramic Catalyst; one
may expect to reach the onset when slightly increasing QH. In the case of the RVC Foam, the results
are less promising than the Ceramic Catalyst’s case. However, it is worth noting that the maximum
heat supply for the RVC Foam is only 18 W due to its temperature limitation in the presence of
oxygen (combustion hazard): such a material should be possibly employed as a stack if an inert
gas were chosen as the working fluid. At last, as what would be expected, the pile of stainless
steel grids is the worst material of all for the standing-wave engine; it has the lowest porosity and
smaller average pore radius, which are undesirable aspects for a standing-wave system. These four
materials have best performance with L2 = 0. For both RVC Foam and Stainless Steel Grids the
fop. results not much higher than 30 Hz, with L1 at the upper limit of the established constraints,
what leads to a less well defined G peak for these general conditions and frequency range.

4.3.3 Closed-loop engines for QH &gt; 0

The same kind of comparative analysis is conducted for the closed-loop configuration. The
results are summarized in Table 4.4. For this configuration, the pile of Stainless Steel Grids is
expected to have the best result. Nevertheless, despite of its favorable properties mentioned before,
such material appears in the last performance position. However, when noting the typical lengths
of alike materials usually employed as regenerators, which are around few centimeters, it becomes
suggestive to consider our 6 cm pile as too long. Indeed, this conclusion would be in agreement
with the strong decay of acoustic pressure level along its axis, as verified during our measurements
of its TTAC. Hence, besides low porosity and small average pore radius, this pile also exhibits a
length too large, which contributes proportionally to the viscous losses.

Actually, the best performing material here tested is the Nichrome Foam, whose maximum
gain reaches 6.88 at 35.2 Hz, with L1 = 0.90 m and L2 = 3.80 m, as illustrated in Figs. 4.9 and
4.10 (note that a contour plot is preferred to a surface area in Fig. 4.11, which shows more clearly
the optimum values of L1 and L2). From the knowledge of the operating frequency, fop. = 35.2 Hz,

fop. = 156 Hz. In that specific case, the process of optimization leads to an engine which is different
from the one obtained with the NiCr Foam. The estimate of the thermal boundary layer thickness

calculated from data in Tab. 3.1): the obtained engine is thus much more a closed-loop but stack-
based engine rather than a regenerator-based thermoacoustic Stirling engine.

The RVC Foam does not reach the thermoacoustic outbreak in this engine, but its maximum
heat supply (18 W) is 4.5 times smaller than others maximums (81 W). Considering that even
though with a small QH the optimal G reaches 0.87, one may guess that its gain would overcome
the unity easily before (81 W). An experiment in the absence of oxygen could verify the validity
of this statement.

5 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

It has been presented in this work three methods for the transfer matrix measurement of a
thermoacoustic core: two of them consisting in applications of a classical two-load acoustic method,
and an alternative method here developed based on impedance measurements. Their performances
have been evaluated either by sensitivity analysis or by actual measurements involving different
porous materials inside this thermoacoustic core. Close agreement has been found between both
perspectives, and these three approaches have been extensively analyzed and compared. The third
approach, here called Impedance Method, has been proved to be accurate due to its intrinsic low
sensitivity to noise and bias, and such accuracy could be verified because of the precision of the
acoustic impedance sensor, to the care taken in its calibration, and to the close monitoring over
the variation of the temperature distribution. It has been shown that this method, contrarily to the
Two-Load Method or the Two-Load Method with TAC Inversion, is accomplishing independently
on the material under test, even if dealing with one that resembles a lengthy regenerator.

The T-matrix components of the TAC have been measured for different kinds of materials
under different heating conditions, and these data have been used to calculate the associated oper-
ating frequency and thermoacoustic amplification gain in both a simple standing-wave engine and
a simple closed-loop engine. An optimization process of the engine’s operation has been proposed,
which consists of maximizing the thermoacoustic amplification gain, and the results obtained also
give the opportunity to compare the performances of different materials. The optimization method
presented in Sec. 4.3 could be applied to more complicated engines as the one depicted in Fig.
1.1, with many more parameters to adjust (notably the electromechanical parameters of the linear
alternator). However, in what concerns the engine performance evaluation, the works presented in
this thesis also reveal important features to be improved later on, in future experiments, aiming at
more reliable results.

The low predicted performance for the closed-loop engine with the Stainless Steel Grids in-
dicates that this sample may be too long (at least if it shall be used as a regenerator) so that it is
difficult to apply a steep temperature gradient along it in order to reach a substantial thermoacoustic
amplification, as it would be expected for such material; besides, the proportional viscous dissipa-
tion also contributes in this sense. These results are in accordance with the difficulties encountered
during the transfer matrix measurements by the Two-Load method due to the strong acoustic pres-
sure decay. These difficulties, for instance, have led to the development of the alternative method to

113



overcome them. The alternative method has been proved to be capable to evaluate a regenerator for
a wide range of lengths (till at least 60 mm) with enough accuracy to allow an engine performance
prediction. The performance prediction also allows the evaluation of the outreach limits of the TBT
length. In the case of the Ceramic Catalyst for the standing-wave engine, for example, the TBT
length seems too high, as it is suggested that one would find a better performance for a shorter TBT
and a non-zero optimal length L2.

For practical reasons, air at atmospheric pressure was chosen as the working fluid, despite
being inappropriate from the performance concerns (most engines make use of pressurized helium).
Therefore, due to this, the predicted onset of thermoacoustic instability (G &gt; 1) was not reached
for all kind of materials, and therefore no formal comparative analysis could be achieved.

The results obtained in Section 4.3 have not been confirmed by experiments, notably for
the reasons mentioned above but also for practical aspects relative to the difficulty in building the
complete engine (for instance, the closed-loop engine equipped with a ceramic catalyst stack is
impossible to be built unless bending the TAC). This kind of experimental confirmation has already
been carried on by Guedra et al. (2011), and it is anticipated that it should also succeed here (at least
for the prediction of threshold) since the modeling of Sec. 4.3 is nothing else than the propagation
of plane acoustic waves in lossy ducts.

It is worth mentioning that the works presented here are intrinsically limited to the acoustic
pressure amplitudes for which the linear approximation can be retained. The measurement method
of Section 3.6 could be, in principle, extended to large amplitudes but some nonlinear processes like
the generation of acoustic streaming could not be adequately characterized by this way. Actually,
the thermoacoustic amplification gain G should be considered cautiously as soon as G &gt; 1. The
physical meaning of a gain significantly larger than unity (e.g. G = 6.88 in Tab. 4.4) is that the
heated TAC under consideration has a very high potential of thermoacoustic amplification, but it
is clear that as soon as self-sustained oscillations are generated, the associated heat transport by
sound (with subsequent variations of the T-matrix components) should be considered.

Now that the so-called Impedance Method has been validated and proved succesful, the
present works appeal for several other perspectives. First of all, the existing test-bench could be
modified (fitting pieces) to allow the measurements of the T-matrices of the TAC used in other
experimental devices at LAUM, and notably two prototypes of thermo-acousto-electric generators.
A first prototype working with air at 5 bars is already available, while a second one (working with

114



Helium at 25 bars) is currently under construction. The obtained data should allow verification
that the existing engines are well designed (or not), but it could also be helpful in the theoretical
description of the engine (see the following paragraph).

Another issue concerning the use of the experimental transfer matrices of the TAC deals with
the development of an adequate modeling of both acoustic propagation and heat transport through
the TAC, involving the solving of an inverse problem. More precisely, the objective is to deter-
mine unknown parameters using an inverse method so that the theoretical transfer matrix fits the
experimental one. The first step is to state the direct problem (notably concerning the simplified de-
scription of heat transfer through the TAC). The experimental data obtained under various heating
conditions could be used to determine, from the optimization algorithm, some unknown parame-
ters (e.g. axial and transverse thermal diffusivities of the regenerator) involved in the theoretical
description of heat transfer within the TAC.

Finally, it would be also interesting to perform the measurements of the T-matrix of the TAC
mentioned above as a function of the acoustic power provided by the impedance sensor to the TAC.
In particular, measurements could be performed at large amplitude, for which the linear description
of thermoacoustic amplification is expected to fail. It is anticipated that both the thermoacoustic
heat flux and the viscothermal losses could no longer follow a quadratic dependance with acous-
tic pressure at large amplitudes. Note that the achievement of this task involves purchasing a new
impedance sensor which is able to generate high amplitude sound notably in the low frequency
range (under 100 Hz) and this kind of device has been recently developed at the Center of Techno-
logical Transfer of the Maine university (CTTM).

APÊNDICE A Transient regime investigation

Before proceeding with the TTAC measurements, it is necessary to ensure that the steady state
regime is satisfactorily approached once new thermal conditions are imposed. That means knowing
the characteristic time (?) for reaching a sufficiently near constant temperature profile along the
TAC interior, so that the TTAC coefficients are minimally affected by residual thermal transitions.
An easy and reliable way to investigate ? is by taking advantage of the experimental setup for the
two-load method and to measure the time evolution of the transfer functions H?ij stated in Eqs. 3.17
(or 3.30); by doing so, whenever those thermal conditions are put up with a significant change,
the actual acoustical effects can be readily verified not needing to beforehand determine the TTAC
coefficients.

An arbitrary criterion has to be therefore established to define a tolerable level for the H?ij
transitory variations, since the complete thermal stability is never reached due unavoidable influ-
ences from the temperature fluctuations of the surrounding ambient, and also due to the external
acoustic noise generated by the setup equipments. Hence, the proportions H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) are
evaluated till its variations along the frequency domain are within the criterion limits.

It is first assumed by common sense stipulation a tolerance deviation of 2 percent in Ampli-
tude Proportions and of 0.025 rad in the phase differences for the complete frequency spectrum:

0.98 6
|H?ij(after)|
|H?ij(before)|

6 1.02, (A.1)

? 0.025rad 6 arg(H?ij(after)) ?arg(H?ij(before)) 6 0.025rad. (A.2)

The transitory thermal influences derive either from an imposed variation on QH, or from the
thermal interaction with the circulating water inside the AHX - whose temperature is affected by
the natural evaporation at the open surface of its reservoir. That justifies a specific and separated
investigation regarding the water influence prior to beginning the analysis of the QH variation
effects.

125



The preliminary investigation starts with the measurement of H?ij(before) without water cir-
culation. The Ceramic Catalyst 1 (600 CPSI) is placed inside the TAC. However, special cares
are taken to ensure as much as possible a uniformity on the temperature distribution throughout
the TAC, like having it passed through a long period without any heating at all, to avoid residual
warmth from whichever previous experimentation; for this reason, one overnight period is chosen
sufficient. Additionally, to prevent from body warmth, even hand-touching on the TAC surfaces is
avoided. It is assumed at this point that the ambient air is in a thermal equilibrium with the whole
TAC device, homogeneously. In the following, the H?ij(before) measurement is made. Once finished,
the water circulation is turned on for 12.5min (guessed time period), and, subsequently, the second
measurement H?ij(after) is made while the water is kept circulating. Finally, the proportions reported
in the statements A.1 and A.2 are put forward, which results in the Figure A.1.

Figure A.1: Amplitude proportions and phase differences between the transfer functions measured
before and 12.5 min after turning in the ambient water cooling system for H?21 (solid line), H?31
(dashed line), and H?43 (dotted line).

One may clearly see that the referred inequality is not satisfied, and it indicates a non-
negligible warmth effect, peculiarly for |H?21| and |H?31| at around 140Hz. Such differences are

126



consistent with the fact that, due to the constant presence of the evaporation phenomenon, the wa-
ter contained in the reservoir is always colder that the ambient air - if there are no longer thermal
remains from any previous heating. Indeed, when actually measuring the temperature in the reser-
voir and in the ambient air, for this experiment situation, a fluctuating difference between 0.7ºC and
1.8°C is verified, depending on the air humidity. Those facts suggest a considerable significance of
the evaporation effect, which must be minimized to then continue the transitory analysis taking into
account the QH variation effect. In order to do so, before starting with any heating supply, the TAC
temperature distribution is stabilized in time with respect to both ambient air and circulating water
by means of a robust procedure, which is to turn on the water circulation since the day before.
Moreover, to keep this evaporative effect also minimized for the succeeding measurements with
heating supply, this procedure is taken as part of the intrinsic preparations from this point forward,
independently on the method for the TAC characterization.

To continue with the transitory regime investigation, the case of the effects due to an imposed
QH variation is put forward. As previously noted, the inequalities A.1 and A.2 are used as the
quality parameters. Once the evaporation effects are stabilized, different arbitrary values for QH
are set, for which the transfer function proportions H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) are measured a predefined
time interval of 5min. The QH values are chosen to be representative for the heating situations to
be imposed during the TTAC measurements, namely 29.3W , 32.3W and 35.3W . After 12 measure-
ments at QH = 29.3W , the inequalities A.1 and A.2 are well satisfied; indeed, a nearly steady-state
regime is achieved since the third measurement, i.e., after 15min. Therefore, as it could have been
predicted, at the 12th measurement the system shows an almost complete thermal stabilization. For
this last measurement is attributed H?ij(before). Then, the heating input is changed to QH = 32.3W ;
after 5min, it is obtained H?ij(after). The calculation of the corresponding proportions gives the
results shown in Figure A.2. In this case, there are deviation peaks over 10 percent, what puts in
evidence a very important effect, even though it having had 5min already passed.

The same procedures are repeated for the following measurements, trying to best capture the
H?ij time evolution. From 10min forward the time increment is diminished from 5min to 1min,
what allowed a more refined evaluation for several time interval combinations. That led to the re-
sults presented in Figure A.3, which shows the H?ij(after)/H?ij(before) behavior within an interval
between 13 and 18min, counted since the QH transition. For both amplitude proportions and phase
differences the deviation peaks are within the stipulated limit established in the inequalities A.1
and A.2. That also reveals what may be called a characteristic time ”?”, which is therefore approx-
imately 13min.

just before and 5min after the transition of heating input from QH = 29.3W to QH = 32.3W for
H?21 (solid line), H?31 (dashed line), and H?43 (dotted line).

In conclusion, this transitory regime investigation assures that the evaporation effects are
suppressed if the water circulation is turned on at the overnight before the experiments, and it
also indicates that a time delay of 13min is sufficient to minimize the transient effects of the QH
variation. However, the latter is supported on the constraints A.1 and A.2, which are stipulated by
a common sense guessing to start an iterative process, hopefully a well-done trial. Indeed, when
obtaining the TTAC coefficients later on, the transitory investigation is validated and, consequently,
those constraints are proved to be well guessed. Although these results are obtained only for the
Ceramic Catalyst 1 circumstance by means of the Two-Load method setup, it is assumed that they
can be equally considered for the other materials as well, for all TAC characterization approaches
treated here.

APÊNDICE B Calibration for the Two-Load Method

It is a necessary precaution to carry out all standard procedures so as to pursuing the lesser
significant error propagation. This case-study is not an exception. On the contrary: in this method
the indirectness of the TTAC measurement is very important, what may compel the errors impact
to devalue or even invalidate the whole experimentation. Thereby, the calibration is put into prac-
tice with close attention to employing well suited and clean equipment, and avoiding, as much as
possible, sound leakage by means of vacuum grease spreading in all joints and connections.

The four microphones are subjected to both absolute and relative calibration. In the first
instance, it is proved that there are important differences between manufacturer’s values and the
actual measured ones just before the experimentation.

As a matter of fact, the absolute calibration is a priori unnecessary since the measured acous-
tic pressures are considered at once in the transfer functions reported in Eq. 3.17 (or Eq. 3.30), in
which the proportions intrinsically dismiss the need for knowing the microphone sensitivities. That
said, a solely relative calibration would be sufficient to go on then with the actual transfer function
measurements, not requiring so the absolute one. Notwithstanding, in order to prevent eventual ma-
jor measurement distortions, and also because it is simple to be effectuated, an absolute calibration
is justified in this work.

Subsequently, the relative calibration is proceeded. The microphones are flush mounted one
pair at a time at both sides of a chamber device, small enough to ensure their exposure to the same
acoustic pressure for the frequency range of interest. Three pairs of microphone combinations are
chosen, in accordance with the transfer function arranges stated in Equations 3.17, namely micros
1-2, 1-3, and 3-4. The schematic of the calibration device is shown in Fig. B.1.

These measurements are associated in the expressions in the following, which are actually
transfer functions.

coupling volume submitted to uniform acoustic pressures provided by the compression chamber.

Knowing that the actual acoustic pressure is the same for each pair of microphones, one can
conclude that any deviation from the unity in the relations of Eq. B.1 is due to the differences of
sensitivity. If these ratios divide the corresponding transfer functions 3.17, then those differences
have their effects canceled. The resulting transfer functions become calibrated, as following.

H?21cal =
H?21

C?21
,H?31cal =

H?31

C?31
,H?43cal =

C?43
. (B.2)

The frequency range and its incremental step must be the same as the ones employed for the
actual TTAC measurement, to keep the exact vectorial matching and hence to achieve the calibrat-
ing correction for each specific frequency. That means an acoustic field also ranging from 50 to
200Hz and paced with a constant increment of 1Hz. A signal generator is directly connected to
a loudspeaker, which in this small chamber case works as a compressor, to produce that acoustic
field. Also because of the chamber small size, the use of a signal amplifier is dismissed, as the
required acoustic power input is proportionally small.

The results in Figure B.2 illustrates how important the calibration is. Although not impressive,
in the order of 1 percent, the deviations may be clearly seen in the amplitude ratios and in the
phase differences as well; they also indicate that their behaviors are not abnormal and there are no
malfunctions in the whole instrumentation. All transfer functions considered in this approach are
calibrated as in B.2.

132



It is very important to note that, in order to simplify the notation for the transfer functions,
the H?ijcal terms have no longer the subscript cal from this point on. Thus, the sole description H?ij
is presumed to indicate a previous calibration, implicitly, when substituting them into Eqs. 3.26 to
3.29, to finally obtain the TTAC coefficients.

APÊNDICE C Calibration for the Impedance Method

The calibration is conducted simply by placing the third microphone at entrance of the AIS,
and taking impedance measurements just as explained in Chapter 3. That way, the calibrating trans-
fer functions are obtained, to be later on applied into the Z-matrix equations.

Figure C.1 shows the proper assembling in detail.

APÊNDICE E Thermal effects on reciprocity

An interesting thermal effect has been noticed during the investigation of the NiCr Foam.
When measuring this material, in the case by the Impedance Method, not respecting the necessary
time delay for a proper thermal stabilization, a strong bias was achieved, as shown in Fig. E.1.
The reciprocity parameters resulted in ?rc = 0.9361 ? 0.0270i and ?rc = 0.0324 + 0.0335i.
Such measurement was done, although non-recommended, aiming to test how important possible
residual thermal effects could have been. For comparison, in the same figure are also shown the
best reciprocity results obtained for the NiCr Foam, whose parameters are presented in Table 3.2.
