iii Abstract 

Abstract 
 

The increasing spread of nanotechnology has led to the design of new materials that represent a 

potential solution for several issues such as gas storage and gas separation, shape/size selective 

catalysis, drug storage and delivery. Among those materials, nanoporous structures have gradually 

aroused the attention of the scientific community. This interest is witnessed by the increasing 

number of publications about novel porous materials constructed from the assembly of molecular 

building blocks such as metal-organic frameworks. The most recent examples are supramolecular 

porous frameworks. These architectures are built up through traditional noncovalent interactions 

such as hydrogen bonds, ?-? interactions. Most recent discoveries have found a novel type of 

bond that involves the participation of a halogen atom. This type of interaction assumes the name 

of halogen bond and is highly directional and hydrophobic. These features can be exploited for the 

design of defined structures.  

 

The present work is focused on the description of several halogen organic frameworks among 

which some of them present robust porous architectures. The structures were obtained by 

combining the tetrafunctional XB acceptor hexamethylenetetramine with different halogen bond 

donors. 

 

The work is divided into three parts. The literature part gives a background about nanoporous 

materials and their evolution with a section dedicated to the description of the halogen bond. The 

experimental section describes the methods used to obtain the supramolecular architectures. The 

final part discusses the structures and the noncovalent interactions that have driven their 

assembly. 

 

 

Keywords: Porosity; X-rays; Halogen bonds; Hydrogen bonds. 

 



 

 

iv Resumo 

Resumo 
 

O contínuo avanço da nanotecnologia potenciou o desenvolvimento de novos materiais que 

apresentam soluções para variadas problemáticas, das quais são exemplos o armazenamento de 

gases e sua separação, a catálise seletiva e o desenvolvimento e entrega de fármacos. Devido às 

suas propriedades, os materiais nanoporosos estão a ganhar destaque, o que levou a um 

aumento do número de publicações ao longo dos últimos anos, sendo um dos exemplos mais 

recentes as estruturas supramoleculares porosas. Estas arquiteturas são construídas através de 

interações não covalentes, como as ligações de hidrogénio e interações ?-?. Descobertas mais 

recentes evidenciam um novo tipo de interação que envolve a participação de um átomo de 

halogénio, a qual assume o nome de “ponte de halogénio” e é altamente direcional e hidrofóbica.  

 

O presente trabalho teve como objetivo a síntese e caracterização de uma série de halogen 

organic frameworks, resultantes da combinação entre um aceitador hexametilenotetramina e 

diferentes dadores de halogénio. 

 

O trabalho encontra-se dividido em três partes. A revisão bibliográfica transmite informações 

básicas acerca dos materiais nanoporosos e a sua evolução, bem como o princípio por detrás da 

“ponte de halogénio”. Por sua vez, a parte experimental descreve a metodologia utilizada para 

obtenção das estruturas supramoleculares em estudo. Por fim, a terceira secção incide sobre a 

discussão acerca das referidas estruturas e respetivas interações não covalentes que levam à sua 

construção.

the introduction of external surface often leads to enhanced selectivity. The red dots represent 

bulky molecules, which can only react on pore mouths (Figure adapted from Ref. 17).................... 8

1. 1 Nanoporous materials - an overview 

 

Materials consisting of nanostructures are abundant in nature. Examples are proteins, DNA, or 

even thinking on nanoparticles used from millenniums to colour glasses and ceramics. The real 

novelty of the last four decades relies on the increase of the ability to fabricate nanostructures and 

nanosystems with a great degree of control and using a diversity of techniques, accompanied by a 

similar enhancement in the ability to characterize structures and systems at the nanoscale.1 

Nowadays, nanomaterials are designed tailoring their properties and functionalities. Anyway, what 

is exactly nanotechnology, nanoscience and all those fields that encompass the nano-world? To 

answer this question it would be appropriate to borrow the definition gave by Professor Roald 

Hoffmann - the Chemistry Nobel Laureate in 1981: "Nanotechnology is the way of ingeniously 

controlling the building of small and large structures, with intricate properties; it is the way of the 

future, with incidentally, environmental benignness built in by design‘’.1  

Its rise has started since the quantum physics laws prevailed to the classical ones that perfectly 

fit the description of macroscale phenomena. By decreasing the scale from macro to nano, the 

properties of the matter change as the energy is discretised and its dependence on surface to 

volume ratio surprisingly increases.  

Certainly, several types of nanostructures materials exist. Among these, nanoporous ones 

represent one important type of nanostructures materials. They consist of a regular organic or 

inorganic framework supporting a regular, porous structure.1 They possess specific surface, 

structural and bulk properties that make them applicable in many fields such as ion exchange, 

separation, catalysis, sensor, and purification. Their pore size in the range of nm makes them 

suitable for the absorption and the interaction with atoms.  

Based on the pore size, it is possible to classify the nanoporous materials in three categories: 

1) Microporous – materials have pore diameters of less than 2 nm.2 

2) Mesoporous – materials have pore diameters between 2 nm and 50 nm.

3) Macroporous – materials have pore diameters of greater than 50 nm.3 

 

In the present context, the attention is turned to those nanoporous solids possessing a pore size 

of similar magnitude or only slightly larger than common gas molecules. 

More specifically, the next paragraphs give an overview of the different nanoporous materials 

following the timeline of their development. Afterwards, the attention is focused on the organic 

frameworks spacing from the metal organic ones, the so-called MOFs until the recent halogen 

organic frameworks (XOFs) which represent the main object of this study. 

 

1. 2.1 The first example of nanoporous materials: Zeolites 

 

Zeolite are natural mineral discovered in 1756 by the Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik 

Cronstedt.4 He observed that after heating this mineral, steams of water were produced. This 

observation inspired the mineralogist to call these materials zeolites, from the Greek ??? (zé?), 

meaning "to boil" and ????? (líthos), meaning "stone".  

Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates of group IA and group IIA elements, such as sodium, 

potassium, magnesium, and calcium5 with microporous structures of usually below 1.0 nm in 

diameter.6 They have the chemical formula M2/nOAl2O3·xSiO2·yH2O, where the charge-balancing 

non-framework cation M has valence n, x is 2.0 or more, and y is the number of moles of water in 

the voids.4 Therefore, they are solids with a relatively open, three-dimensional crystal structure 

built from the elements aluminum, oxygen, and silicon, with alkali or alkaline metals plus water 

molecules trapped in the gaps among them.7 Aluminium and silicon atoms form a three-

dimensional structure of AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra linked together through an oxygen atom. If the 

SiO4 results already charge balanced, AlO4 is negatively charged and, thus, is balanced by a 

cation, M (Fig. 1). The content ratio of Si/Al modifies the properties of porous zeolite. More 

specifically, a higher content of aluminium increases the acidity of the porous structure; oppositely, 

a higher amount of silica makes the zeolitic environment more basic. Depending on the application, 

the content ratio varies, and several zeolites with different properties are obtained.

3 Part 1. Introduction 

Important characteristics of zeolites are high boiling points (over 1000°C), resistance to high 

temperatures, high-pressure resistance and difficulties to dissolve in water and organic solvents. 

Even if all these properties are enough for making them good candidates for many applications, 

they are more notable for their open, cage-like, framework structure. In fact, they present a high 

surface to volume ratio, and, consequently, a huge porous volume. This peculiar feature led to their 

use in separation, filtration, adsorption, and catalysis. Several types of natural zeolites exist such 

as chabazite, erionite, mordenite, and clinoptilolite. Anyway, the random size porous distribution 

makes natural zeolites not suitable for many applications. Differently, manufactured zeolites 

present a precise dimension and pore size distribution.

One of the most famous examples of synthetic zeolite applied for petroleum cracking process is 

Zeolite Socony Mobil - 5 (ZSM-5) with the chemical formula NanAlnSi96–nO192·16H2O (0&lt;n&lt;27). 

The Mobil Oil Company patented it in 1972 for the petroleum industry. It possesses a pentasil unit 

characterised by eight five-membered rings with the Al and Si atoms on the vertices (Fig. 2). Each

10-ring holes  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2 - Pentasil unit of ZSM-5.9 

 

Robert J. Argauer and George R. Landolt performed the first synthesis of ZSM-5 in 1969.10,11 

Their method consisted of a mixture of three solutions. One solution corresponded to the source of 

aluminium, sodium and hydroxide ions. The second one contained tetrapropylammonium cation as 

a templating agent. The third solution was the source of the other building block of zeolites, silica. 

The mixture of the three solutions led to the supersaturation point of the tetrapropylammonium 

ZSM-5. After heating and recrystallization, the solid ZSM-5 were obtained. 

Even though the proposed method was easy to perform, it presented some drawbacks such as 

the use of toxic and readily inflammable ammines. The subsequent years witnessed other 

procedures to synthetize ZSM-5 without involving dangerous compounds.12,13,14 

The next paragraph deals with the current role of zeolites in the industrial field. Mainly the 

catalytic activity of them is presented showing advanced zeolitic structures such as nanocrystal 

zeolites and hierarchical zeolites.

1. 2.2 Zeolites current industrial application  

 

Zeolites can be divided into two categories, natural and synthetic zeolites. Even if the first ones 

were discovered almost 250 years ago, their use for industrial applications came just when artificial 

zeolites were synthesized. Figure 3 presents the milestone in the history of Zeolites.15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3 - Milestone in the history of Zeolites.15 

 

The major applications for synthetic zeolites are in ion exchange (detergents), 

adsorbents/desiccants and catalysis.16 They are also defined as molecular sieves to stress their 

ability on allowing small molecules to enter the nanopores instead of the biggest ones. 

For all those characteristics, they are intensively used, as already mentioned, in catalytic 

activities. Catalyst materials are important for decreasing the activation energy barrier in a reaction. 

Their application allows lower reaction temperatures to be used during the process. Zeolitic 

catalysts are mainly employed in pharmaceutical drug production and in the petrochemical industry 

as catalytic crackers to break large hydrocarbon molecules into gasoline, diesel, kerosene, waxes 

and more petroleum by-products. Their catalytic activity is due to their porous structure. The 

several atoms and molecules once enter zeolites remain trapped into the tiny cavities and, thus, 

reactions readily take place.  

On the other hand, the narrow micropores of zeolites also imply access and diffusion 

limitations17 of the reagents/products throughout the crystal. This threat can be solved either 

decreasing the crystal size, creating nanocrystals zeolites with a size typically smaller than 0.5 

µm,18 or through the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites.17 The reduction of the size of a particle from 

the micrometer to the nanometer scale leads to substantial changes in the properties of zeolites, 



 

 

6 Part 1. Introduction 

and consequently of their performance in catalysis among other properties. The surface to volume 

ratio increases by the decrease of materials dimension and zeolite nanoparticles acquire large 

external surface areas and high surface activity. In addition, smaller zeolite crystals have reduced 

diffusion path lengths relative to conventional micrometer-sized zeolites.19 Tuel et al.18 reported an 

efficient method to synthesized hollow zeolites nanocrystals (ZSM-5) with a controllable wall 

thickness and chemical composition. The formation of holes in the crystals involves both partial 

dissolution and re-crystallization of the zeolite in the presence of a base and organic molecules. 

More specifically, synthesized calcined silicalite-1 nanocrystals, with the composition 

Si96O192F4(TPA)4  were immersed in a solution of tetrapropylenammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) with 

water and different contents of aluminium, introduced as aluminium nitrate Al(NO3)3, to obtain Si/Al 

molar ratios between 25 and 100. The nanocrystals were obtained after periods of static heating at 

170°C.  Figure 4 shows TEM and SEM pictures of the nanocrystals obtained by simple 

crystallization of silicalite-1 zeolites and after its dilution in TPAOH in the presence of aluminium, 

getting ZSM-5. The ‘‘nanoboxes” possess very regular zeolitic walls, with a thickness in the 20–40 

nm range. In SEM pictures is evident that internal voids never communicate with the outside via 

large pores, and that all zeolite nanoboxes look perfectly closed at the resolution of the pictures. 

The presence of aluminium slightly influences the intracrystalline pore size and shape as possible 

to observe from TEM images. Values in Table 1 show that the volume is similar for hollow silicalite-

1 and ZSM-5 zeolites obtained after dissolution of silicalite-1 in TPAOH solution in the presence of 

aluminium.  

Nanocrystals zeolites have been recognized as a possible solution for the diffusion limitation 

that such materials present. On the other hand, hierarchical zeolites have provided a new way to 

avoid diffusion limitation.  

A hierarchically organized zeolite (HOZ) is defined as a material that retains the crystalline order 

and associated functionality of bulk (purely microporous) zeolite, but that also integrates a 

multilevel pore network.20 The new porous material is characterized by an interconnection of micro-

, meso- and macropores to enhance the molecular transport in the active sites (Fig. 5). The 

additional porosity levels can be configured either within (intracrystalline) or between

in both cases.20

and hierarchical zeolites. The orange spheres represent molecules that suffer from single-file 
diffusion. The secondary porosity enhances the number of pore mouths to diffuse in and out of, as 
well as the diffusion properties within the pores (indicated by the green spheres). In the latter case, 
the introduction of external surface often leads to enhanced selectivity. The red dots represent 
bulky molecules, which can only react on pore mouths.17 

 

Approaches to synthesize HOZs involve either interrupting their crystallization and growth in the 

synthesis gel (bottom-up) or a post-synthetic removal or rearrangement of the atoms in a bulk 

zeolite (top-down) (Fig. 6).20

Nanocrystal zeolites and hierarchical zeolites represent significant advances for the 

rationalization of zeolite synthesis.21 However, the prediction of their final crystal structure is not 

easy as well as their functional tunability.  



 

 

9 Part 1. Introduction 

The progress in coordination chemistry has led to the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks 

(MOFs), which imply a better prediction of the resulting crystal structure based on the knowledge of 

the metal clusters and the organic ligands participating in the synthesis.22 

 

1. 3.1 Metal Organic framework – An introduction 

 

Generally, the robustness of a framework can be achieved by the combination of rigid organic 

moieties and inorganic clusters. This attempt has led to the synthesis of the so-called metal-

organic frameworks (MOFs) as shown in Figure 7.  

They consist of metal units, secondary building units (SBUs), linked with organic moieties using 

coordination bonds (Fig. 8).23 

This new category of porous materials did not occupy the main role in the scientific panorama 

until 1990. Prior to the early 1980s, aluminosilicate zeolites and closely related systems 

represented the predominant class of open-framework materials with three-dimensional crystalline 

structures.24,25,26

Parallel, the coordination chemistry led to the divulgation of the coordination polymers. These 

consist of metal ions joint together by organic ligands. As mentioned before, the real interest in 

porous coordination polymers and MOFs started only around 1990.24 These new structures have a 

great advantage over the common zeolites: more flexible rational design.29 Nevertheless, the 

stability of these hybrid structures was achieved later. Indeed, until the end of the ’90, some issues 

compromised their formation. First of all the final products were poorly crystallized and prevented 

structure information from being obtained. Then, their thermal stability initially was low, and many 

structures collapsed in the absence of the guest molecules.25 The evolution came with the 

discovery of MOF-5 by Yaghi and co-workers in 1999.29 

In Robson’s paper30 published in 2008, it is traced the synthetic development of MOFs that led 

to the formation of a large range of crystalline, microporous, stable solids, possibly using structure-

directing agents, with ion-exchange, gas sorption, or catalytic properties. 

MOFs have emerged as an extensive class of crystalline materials with ultrahigh porosity (up to 

90% free volume) and enormous internal surface areas, extending beyond 6 000 m2/g.24 This 

feature combined with the changeable structure and properties caused by the large choice of both 

organic and inorganic components, make MOFs good candidates in applications such as clean 

energy, storage of gases (e.g., hydrogen and methane), adsorbents for separation needs. More 



 

 

11 Part 1. Introduction 

potential applications are catalysis and biomedical imaging. All these positive aspects have seen 

an increasing interest on MOFs parallel to the development of different chemistry fields:  

1) Advances in cluster chemistry. 

2) Maturation of organic synthesis pertinent to ligand preparation and post-synthetic modification. 

3) Improvement in structure determination, particularly through X-Ray crystallography, and 

development of hard- and software for evaluation of sorption properties. 

4) Interdisciplinary growth of MOF research with its neighbouring fields. 

5) The ever-expanding potential in applications.31 

One more important feature of MOFs is their geometrically well-defined structure. This property 

further implies that these solids should be crystalline, an important criterion for the precise 

establishment of structure-property relationships.32 Nevertheless, this is not the only implication. 

The knowledge of possible topologies, the functionality of multitopic organic linker molecules, as 

well as the understanding of typical metal coordination environments, helps to understand and 

direct the synthesis efforts. As ultrahigh porosity is the feature that made MOFs so famous, the 

main goal in MOF synthesis is to establish the conditions that lead to a framework, which does not 

collapse. 

Moreover, as they are crystalline solids, a tuneable kinetics of crystallization is of huge 

importance to guarantee the nucleation and, consequently, the growth of crystals. As nothing is 

known in details about their crystal growth and nucleation process, a new type of MOF is 

discovered by the common trial-and-error method. 

First of all, the formation of this kind of hybrid frameworks is a consequence of supramolecular 

chemistry.30 Thus in the assembly process, two subunits have to be combined, organic ligands and 

metal precursors.33 Whereas the organic ligands are supplied directly as a reactant, the SBUs 

have to be formed in the synthesis process from the metal precursors. What results crucial is the 

SBUs synthesis that ascertains the MOF assembly process.29 The advantage to common 

nanoporous materials such as zeolite is the easiness on tuning their structure and functionality 



 

 

12 Part 1. Introduction 

during synthesis. Moreover, as the subunits of MOFs are the metal coordination centres and the 

organic linkers, by changing the last ones, it is possible to obtain a wide range of structures that 

differ from pores ‘size, chemical functionalities and affinities for guest molecules.28,34 

Depending on the different stages of synthesis involved, MOFs are classified as  

i) first generation (normal MOFs);  

ii) second generation (functionalized MOFs);  

iii) third generation (smart MOFs).  

First-generation MOFs possess the traditional architecture having an inorganic and organic moiety, 

second-generation MOFs are subjected to surface modifications through chemical functionalities 

and, finally, third-generation MOFs contain biomolecules such as cations, drugs, bioactive 

compounds, toxins and gases within their framework.35 

MOFs can also differ for the characteristic framework they possess. In this sense, they can be 

categorized into two groups, rigid and flexible. A permanent porosity and robust pores characterize 

the first type. The second one is dynamic and responds to external factors such as temperature, 

pressure or even guest molecules. 

The broad range of MOFs published through the years is huge and it results impossible to 

present all of them. The following text discusses about MOF-5, one of the principal metal-organic 

frameworks. 

 

1. 3.2 The father of MOFs- MOF-5 and its application 

 

This paragraph is dedicated to the description of MOF-5 developed in 1999 by Yaghi and co-

workers.29 

It is also called IRMOF-1 standing for isoreticular and means a series of MOFs with the same 

topology, but different size of pores. MOF-5 is a metal-organic framework formed from tetranuclear 

supertetrahedral cluster consisting of Zn4O that constitutes the nodes separated by 1,4-

benzodicarboxylic (BDC) acid struts.29 More specifically the structure derived from a simple cubic 

six-connected net in two stages: first, the nodes (vertices) of the net are replaced by clusters of 

secondary building units; second, the links (edges) of the net are replaced by finite rods (`struts') of

13 Part 1. Introduction 

BDC molecules. The core of the cluster consists of a single O atom bonded to four Zn atoms, 

forming a regular Zn4O tetrahedron. Each edge of each Zn tetrahedron is then capped by a CO2 

group to form a Zn4(O)(CO2)6 cluster. 
 Figure 9b shows the sphere that represents the pore size 

that can be used for gas storage.  

The structure was obtained by a solvothermal method in mild conditions. That means a solution 

of the metal precursor (Zinc II Nitrate) in trimethylamine was mixed with a solution of H2BDC in 

N,N’-dimethylformamide (DMF)/chlorobenzene. The solid-state 13C NMR analysis of the obtained 

colourless crystal blocks confirmed the inclusion of DMF and chlorobenzene molecules in the 

voids. This stability was confirmed after heating up to 300°C for 24h the desolvated crystals. 

Incredibly, both the morphology and the crystallinity remained unaltered as the single crystal X-ray 

analysis confirmed.

Without considering the guest molecules in the voids, the 80% of the cell volume stayed 

unoccupied. This characteristic indicates the high surface to volume ratio (surface/volume) 

reached.

14 Part 1. Introduction 

This incredible success derived from the commitment between organic and inorganic chemistry 

and traced the starting point of the research and development of several MOFs.  

 

1. 4.1 An introduction to halogen bond 

 

Porous materials constructed from molecular building blocks, such as MOFs, have received 

continuous interest for not only their diverse and designable structures but also for their dynamic 

behaviors under external stimuli.38 Supramolecular organic frameworks that are acquiring more 

and more attention due to their easy synthesis represent a relatively new class of porous materials. 

Among the wide range of these molecular materials, the last decade has seen the rise of the 

halogen organic frameworks. As the name suggests, the structures are built up on motifs that self-

organize through the halogen bond recognition. Indeed, as halogen atoms in organic compounds 

can typically be found at the periphery of molecules, they are ideally positioned to be involved in 

intermolecular interactions.39 This noncovalent interaction is less familiar than hydrogen bond but it 

is similar to it in several respects.40 

It results, thus, important to clarify what halogen bond is. Any noncovalent intermolecular 

arrangement R – X···Y, where X is the halogen atom, is included in the definition41 of halogen bond 

(Fig. 10). This peculiar interaction exists when an electron density transfer occurs from the electron 

donor site, Lewis base, to the halogen atom, Lewis acid.42 The attractive nature of the interaction 

results in intermolecular distances shorter than the sum of the van der Waals (vdW) radii of the 

involved atoms. The characteristics of these noncovalent interactions depend on the nature of the 

interacting partners that determine the final architecture of a supramolecular system. The nature of 

the halogen bond donors and acceptors influence the final architecture in a supramolecular 

system. Molecules possessing nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur atoms are good XB acceptors.  

On the other hand, the XB donors are characterized by a halogen atom high polarizable and 

less electronegative. They are involved in a covalent bond with an atom quite electronegative, such 

as nitrogen, which withdraws the electron density intensifying the electropositive area on the 

halogen alongside the bond. However, generally the halogen bond donor ability decreases in the 

order I &gt; Br &gt; Cl.43 Fluorine is not even considered because of its weakness in forming XBs. 



 

 

15 Part 1. Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 10 - Schematic representation of halogen bonding interaction.44 

 

 

Halogen bond occurs due to an anisotropic distribution of the electron density around the 

halogen atom. This anisotropic character determines the formation of a region of positive 

electrostatic potential on the outermost portion of some covalently bound halogen atoms.45 The 

electron density is represented by an ellipsoid elongated in the direction of the bonding axis, a 

feature called polar flattening.46 Consequently, the XB is a high directional type of bond. Regarding 

crystal engineering, this feature is exploited to tailor the design of new porous materials useful for 

gas storage and for the adsorption of volatile organic compounds,47 drug delivery systems,48 fuel 

cells, ion exchange and CO2 capture.  

Halogen bonding is mainly explored in co-crystals between iodine perfluorocarbons and 

nitrogen-containing compounds,46 but the discovery of porous molecular crystals from a mixture of 

hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) has broadened the non-fluorine 

based halogen bond donors to N-haloimides.49 

The present project deals with the design and formation of crystals of which motif is built up 

through XBs. For this reason, it is of great importance to clarify, as far as possible, some main 

features of this noncovalent interaction starting from the historical background that led to the 

discovery of this new class of supramolecular bonds. 

 

 

 



 

 

16 Part 1. Introduction 

1. 4.2 A historical background 

 

The history of the halogen bonding (XB) is approximately 200 years old as the I2???NH3 adduct, 

probably the first halogen-bonded system ever prepared, was synthesized in Gay-Lussac’s 

laboratory by Colin as early as 1813 (Fig. 11).50 Colin reported that when dry gaseous ammonia 

and dry iodine are reacted, a liquid with a somewhat metallic luster is produced. Fifty years later, 

Guthrie obtained the same liquid in pure form by adding powdered iodine to aqueous ammonia and 

proposing the compound structure as I2???NH3 . 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 11 - Frontispiece of the volume (left) and the first page of the paper (right) where Colin was 
reporting his experiments on the reaction of diiodine with ammonia.50 

 

 

Just after 1950, the chemistry community started to figure out the existence of a strong 

electrophilic nature of halogens. Until that time, the recognition of electrophilic halogens as 

responsible for the formation of relatively strong and directional interactions in the solid, liquid, and 

gas phases was denied by the entire community.50 In 1954 Hassel et al.51 described the solid-state 

structure of the Br2???O(CH2CH2)2O system (Fig. 12, top). In 1958 and 1959 two more structures 

were reported, Br2???C6H6 (Fig. 12, bottom) and Cl2???C6H6 adducts,
50 showing that ?-systems work 



 

 

17 Part 1. Introduction 

as donors of electron density to the electrophilic halogens even in the solid state. The use of 

‘’halogen bond’’ to identify this interaction progressively became less and less occasional, and an 

exponential growth occurred in the last 20 years in parallel with the comprehensive process of 

unification of all phenomena related to interactions originated by electrophilic halogens.

1. 4.3 A physical study of halogen bonds: the ?-hole 

 

The formation of chemical bonds, wherever they may fall on the continuum between covalent 

and noncovalent, involves a balancing of attractive and repulsive forces within the system. Once at 

equilibrium, the forces felt by the nucleus are zero. These forces have a nature purely Coulombic. 

In a molecule, nuclei with electrons exercise a potential, which can be defined as: 

 

V(r) = ? (ZA / |RA - r|) - ? (?(r ‘)dr ‘/ |r ‘ - r|)       eq.1 

 

Where ZA is the charge on nucleus A, located at RA. The denominators are the distances from 

each nucleus A and each unit of electronic charge ?(r ’)dr from the point of interest r.52 

When there is no perturbing effect, the electron density ?(r) is static, and the corresponding 

potential is defined as electrostatic potential. The electrostatic potential is a property of 

fundamental significance53 and it is useful in predicting noncovalent interactions areas with positive 

b)

18 Part 1. Introduction 

V(r) of a molecule that attracts areas of negative V(r) of another molecule. Generally, the literature 

refers to surface VS(r) as the potential is computed on the surface of the molecule. The latter is 

defined by the 0.001 au contour of its ?(r).54 When the electrostatic potential is positive is indicated 

as Vs,max and where is negative it is labeled Vs,min. 

Once the concept of electrostatic potential is clarified the comprehension of the ?-hole, a basic 

concept in halogen bonds, results easier. 

Considering a simple free halogen atom, it presents an overall electron density distribution with 

a spherical symmetry and a positive potential.55 When the same atom forms a covalent bond with 

an atom B, the spherical symmetry is disrupted, and the electron density undergoes to an 

anisotropic distribution. More specifically the electron density would be less along the extension of 

the bond than on the lateral sides. The area with less electron density is called “?-hole”. The name 

is due to the electron-deficient outer portion of the half-filled bonding orbital.56 The presence of the 

?-hole causes the electrostatic potential VS(r) on the surface of the covalent bond to assume 

different signs. In fact, what is often found is that VS(r) is positive in the ?-hole region, which has 

the lesser electronic density, and it is negative on the lateral sides, which possess greater 

electronic densities.52 Figure 13 shows the computational calculation of the Vs(r), performed with 

DFT methods, in chlorine when forming the covalent bond in Cl-OH. As it is possible to observe, 

the positive potential indicated with the red color corresponds to the ?-hole along the O–Cl bond.  

In general, the more polarizable the halogen atom and the more electron attracting the skeleton 

of the molecule, the more positive is the halogen ?-hole. Thus, the XB-donor ability is greater for 

the heavier and more polarizable halogens. It increases according to the order Cl&lt;Br&lt;I. The 

fluorine atom, even if it belongs to the VII group of the periodic table, it is so electronegative that it 

is not common to behave as an XB donor as it does not possess an extensive ?-hole. Just in 

cases where the electron donor is highly strong, fluorine shows a ?-hole interaction.57 The 

presence of a ?-hole on many covalently bound halogen atoms gives rise to attractive noncovalent 

interactions, both inter- and intramolecular, with negative sites such as the lone pairs of Lewis 

bases, ? electrons, anions, etc.55

green, from 0.43 to 0; blue, less than 0 (negative). The most positive potential on the chlorine 
surface (red) has a VS,max of 0.99 V, and corresponds to a ?-hole on the extension of the O–Cl 
bond. Note also the positive region associated with the hydrogen (lower right); the VS,max is 2.51 
V.55 

 

These interactions result high directional. Indeed, if a halogen atom X is covalently bound with 

an atom R, the resulting interaction with either a nucleophilic or an electrophilic site will be along 

the covalent bond (linear) in the first case, and on the lateral side in the second case (Fig. 14).

20 Part 1. Introduction 

The more linear the X???Nucleophile bond is, the stronger the interaction results. This means 

that the distance between the two atoms is shorter. Therefore, the length and the linearity of the 

bond indicate how strong the interaction is. 

Now the question is what is the real, physical nature of this interaction? What is the nature, so, 

of the ?-holes? Through the literature, the interaction with this positive area in molecules covalently 

bound is justified by several concepts: charge transfer, dispersion forces, polarization, electrostatic 

forces, etc. Nevertheless, the meaning of all these models is overlapping, and a great confusion 

can derived. Indeed, they represent just a dissection of one and unique measurable property, so 

experimentally measurable, the interaction energy ?E between two components A and B given by: 

 

?E = E(AB) – [E(A) + E(B)]                eq.2 

 

Where E(AB) is the energy of the complex AB, and E(A) and E(B) are the energies of the isolated 

components. This energy is a consequence of the action of the Coulombic forces that encompass 

all the forces listed before. Thus, whatever is the cause of the ?-holes interactions, their nature is a 

consequence of the action of the Coulombic forces 

 

1. 4.4 Donor Molecules in Halogen bond systems 

 

Controlling the arrangement of small molecules in crystalline solids remains a challenge for 

materials chemistry.58 More specifically, the importance of establishing a ranking of moieties with 

similar chemical behaviour has a fundamental role in supramolecular chemistry, where a detailed 

knowledge of intermolecular interactions, is crucial for the rational preparation of a material with 

desired structure and properties.59 Supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ? 

stacking represent the most common noncovalent tools in designing novel crystalline architectures. 

Contrary, halogen bonds have just recently gained the attention as potential guides for the 

formation of crystals with specific structures. As already observed, a halogen bonding involves an 

electron-deficient halogen atom and an electron-donating group.60 Almost any electronegative 

molecule can act as XB acceptor.61 For example, the nitrogen atoms of the tetracoordinated 



 

 

21 Part 1. Introduction 

hexamethylenetetramine molecule are good XB acceptor sites.49,62 Anions are considered to be 

better halogen-bond acceptors than neutral species.63 Even cyanometallates have been employed 

for obtaining strong halogen interactions.64 

A key role for the formation of this new type of noncovalent interaction is played by the XB 

donor molecules. Their performance depends on the ability of the halogen atom to be polarized, as 

well as on the presence of electron-withdrawing moieties that enhance the anisotropy of the 

electron distribution on the adjacent halogen atom.59 

According to this information, it is possible to trace a ranking for the XB donor moieties ability 

following two main guidelines:  

a) The power of the XB donor moiety decreases in the order I&gt;Br&gt;Cl&gt;&gt;F.57 

b) The greater the electron-withdrawing ability of the backbone of the XB donor molecule is, the 

more effective the XB donor moiety is expected to be. 

Aakeröy et al.59 attempted to rank the interacting preference of chemical moieties by examining 

six XB donors, carrying different electron withdrawal groups, and their ability to form halogen 

bonds. The donors molecules are reported in Figure 15 with the correspondent values of the VS,MAX 

calculated on the surface of the halogen atoms through DFT calculations. Halogens with weak 

electron withdrawal moieties displayed low electrostatic potential’ values. So a first theoretical 

ranking of XB donor molecules strength was delineated. In order to confirm this hierarchy, the 

molecules were combined with several XB acceptors to obtain co-crystals. As expected, just the 

strongest XB donor molecules were able to interact through XBs.

potential, associated with the most positive ?-hole among the halogen atoms in these molecules. 
Maximum values associated with each XB donor are reported near the corresponding atom. 
Values are in kJ/mol. Calculation performed through DFT method.59 



 

 

22 Part 1. Introduction 

Generally, perfluorohalocarbons (PFHCs) are considered strong halogen bonds donors.63 

Resnati and Metrangolo described the first case of perfluorocarbon – halocarbon (PFC-HC) self-

assembly to give co-crystals through interactions between nitrogen as a donor (Lewis base) and 

iodine as an acceptor (Lewis acid).65 

One more class of possible XB donors is represented by the N-halosuccinamides. This type of 

interaction is recognizable in the crystal structure of N-chlorosuccinamide between the chlorine 

atoms and the carbonyl oxygens.66 Rissanen and co-workers49,62 have already employed N-

bromosuccinamide and N-iodosuccinamide obtaining robust supramelocular architectures. 

This paragraph gives an overview of several XB donor molecules applied for the assembly of 

novel structures. In this perspective, even if difficult to define, a hierarchy among the several XB 

donor molecules is fundamental in the supramolecular synthesis of complex architectures.  

 

1. 4.5 Halogen bond versus Hydrogen bond 

 

According to the IUPAC definition, the hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a 

hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment R-H in which R is more electronegative 

than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is 

evidence of bond formation.67 Generally, the formation of a hydrogen bond is indicated by the 

scheme R-H???Y. As the XB, even in this case the linearity and the distance from the Y atom are 

indicators of the bond strength. The closer the angle is to 180°, the shorter is the H???Y distance 

and, so, the stronger is the hydrogen bond.  

This type of noncovalent interaction shows lots in common with the XB. In fact, by a 

computational analysis of the hydrogen atom covalently bound to other more electronegative 

atoms, it is possible to observe the existence of the ?-hole. Since a hydrogen atom has only one 

valence electron that is participating in the R-H bond, the outer portion of the hydrogen has a 

positive potential with its maximum along the extension of the R-H bond (?-hole).55 Nonetheless, 

the lack of any other valence electron on the hydrogen makes its lateral sides to possess a low 

electron density. Therefore, hydrogen ?-holes are more hemispherical as shown in figures 13 and 

16. The hydrogen bonds tend to be not as directional as other ?-hole interactions. This difference 



 

 

23 Part 1. Introduction 

is one of the main from the halogen bonding but not the only one. Indeed, halogenated organic 

fragments are not readily miscible in aqueous or polar solvents resulting hydrophobic. In particular, 

it has been demonstrated that polar solvents, such as water, have little influence on the interaction 

energies and geometries of halogen-bonded adducts in solution.56 In the case of hydrogen-bonded 

adducts, the competition with hydrogen bond-donor/acceptor solvents influences their formation. It 

is possible to define the halogen bonding as the hydrophobic equivalent of the hydrophilic 

hydrogen bonding.68 This feature can be exploited in drug design and, so, control the lipophilicity of 

the drugs for absorption, biological barrier permeability, transport into organs and cells, and 

interaction with target molecules.69

hydrogen is on the right. The positions of the nuclei are indicated by the light circles. Color ranges, 
in volts: red, greater than 0.43; green, between 0.43 and 0; blue, less than 0 (negative).55 

 

As hydrogen bonds show some differences with the halogen bonds, what happens if they 

participate together in the assembly of a supramolecular structure? Do they compete or perform a 

complemental work? These questions are fundamental to predict which will be the primary 

interaction in a supramolecular system.70 In the work of Aakeröy et al.70 a wide range of ditopic 

molecules carrying both a hydrogen and a halogen bond donor (Fig. 17a) were combined with 

three types of acceptors, monotopic, ditopic symmetric and ditopic asymmetric molecules (Fig. 

17b). After co-crystallization, three different plots were obtained. In Figure 18 the diagrams show 

the preference of interaction in the co-crystallization with the monotopic, ditopic symmetric and 

ditopic asymmetric acceptor molecules. In the case of monotopic the main supramolecular 



 

 

24 Part 1. Introduction 

interaction is of hydrogen type. Just in a small amount of motifs both XB and HB, contribute for 

their formation. Passing to the symmetric ditopic until the asymmetric ditopic acceptor molecules, 

the complemental character of each interaction increases. The crystals are formed with the co-

participation of both bonds. Nevertheless, the study has shown that hydrogen bonding is likely to 

be more effective as synthetic vector.

In another study carried on by Raatikainen et al.71 several simple haloanilinium and 

halopyridinium salt structures (Fig. 19) were described showing the balance between HB and XB in 

the solid state. For all the haloanilinium compounds, the hydrogen bonding is the major responsible 

for the crystal packing. If in structures 1 to 3 and in structure 5 XBs slightly contribute for the motif 

complexation in structure 4 do not participate. The same plot appears for structures where the 

chlorine anion is substituted with dihydrogen phosphate groups. Indeed, hydrogen bond dominates 

the crystal packing. Differently, passing from haloanilinium to halopyridinium salts the XB competes 

with the HB, and in the case of structure 9 the entire architecture is built up through XBs. 

The different studies confirm that halogen bonding is acquiring more and more importance in 

tailoring the properties of new supramolecular architectures.

1. 5.1 Single crystal X-Ray Diffraction 

 

Before presenting the developed project, a paragraph is dedicated to the importance of single 

crystal phase study, as the entire work came out from the analysis of several single crystals 

obtained from solution. 

First, it is mandatory to specify what a crystal is: 

‘’A crystal is an anisotropic, homogeneous body consisting of a three-dimensional periodic ordering 

of atoms, ions or molecules’’72 

A typical material is composed of many smaller crystals of which boundaries influence its 

properties. From a research point of view, especially when creating a new material, scientists want 

to remove as many variables as possible to understand the properties of the materials. To obtain 

this, materials have to be studied as pure as possible, and here it comes clear the importance of 

single crystals where impurities and defects have been radically reduced.  

 



 

 

27 Part 1. Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 20 - Representation of the three phases in the solid state: single crystal (a), polycrystalline 
material (b) and amorphous phase (c).73 

 

 

Figure 20 shows the difference between single crystals, polycrystalline materials, and amorphous 

phases. In single crystals, a long-range order of atoms exists. In the case of polycrystalline 

materials, defined regions with their own order of atoms coexist. Regarding amorphous materials, 

no order can be found. 

Thus, single crystals play a decisive role not only in the context of complex materials research. 

Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis still represents the definitive proof of a structure for the 

chemists. The discussion of molecular and other properties depends upon it, especially for a 

comparison with structures calculated from quantum chemistry.74 

 

1. 5.2 Crystal Parameters 
 

As a crystal is a solid where a pattern is repeated over the three dimensions, it is necessary just 

to know its motif to describe the entire structure. The motif can be converted by symmetry 

operations along three spatial vectors a, b, c, forming, thus, a lattice. The smallest unit volume of 

that is called the unit cell. It is described by the three lattice constants a, b and c (length of the 

basis vectors) and the angles formed by them ?, ? and ? (Fig. 21).

A crystal possesses one more property than periodicity, symmetry. Full consideration of all 

possible symmetries in a lattice gave rise to seven possibilities, the seven crystal systems (Table

29 Part 1. Introduction 

The unit cell has to be chosen in such a way that the highest number of symmetries is 

described. Sometimes just the seven crystal systems are enough for that description. They are 

also called primitive cells, indicated by the P letter, to be distinguished from the centred ones. The 

latter are used when better describe the symmetry of a crystal even if this implies the consideration 

of more lattice points. Centred cells are indicated by letters I (body-centred), A, B, C (based-

centred), and F (face-centred). Thus, the lattice systems used to describe crystals are 14, 

recognized as the 14 Bravais Lattices (Fig. 22).72  

In the atomic lattice of a crystal it is possible to recognize the existence of parallel planes 

formed by the lattice points. The orientation of such planes is defined by the Miller indices with the 

values h, k, and l. These can be determined by recognizing the plane that lies nearest to the origin 

of the unit cell. Thus, the reciprocal of the intercepts between the plane and the axis of the unit cell, 

a, b and c, correspond to the h, k and l values and they are always integers.  

Once presented the parameters of the base structure of a crystal, the section continues 

showing some important topics of crystallography. These are presented roughly, as the main 

object of the entire project was the development of novel nanoporous materials.

30 Part 1. Introduction 

1. 5.3 X-Ray diffraction  

 

Crystallography finds its origin on the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen who 

received the Nobel Prize in physics at 1901.  

X radiations are emitted when the electrons change the energy state. Generally, X-rays have a 

wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting highly energetic 

and penetrating radiations. For this reason, they are good for interacting at the atomic level, 

penetrating the lattice planes of a crystal.  

After their discovery, different scientists contributed for the evolution of crystallography. Max von 

Laue managed to produce a diffraction pattern investigating the interaction between X-Rays and 

crystals. He found that crystals are composed by periodic arrays of atoms (Fig. 23), and cause X-

Rays diffraction patterns due to the atoms and their 3-dimensional spacing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 23 – Laue model of the diffraction by a row of atoms.77 

 

One of the major contributions came with Bragg family, father and son, who, based on the work 

of Laue, formulated the relationship between crystal’s atomic structure and its X-Ray diffraction 

providing a tool which has revolutionized our understanding of matter.72 

 

n? = 2dhkl (sin?)     (n=1, 2, 3,…)          Bragg’s Law     eq. 3 

 



 

 

31 Part 1. Introduction 

Where ? is the wavelength, dhkl is the spacing between atomic planes and ? is the angle between 

the incident rays and the surface of the crystals. Figure 24 shows the mechanism that brought to 

the formulation of this law. When a beam of X-rays irradiated a substance, the X-ray reflected from 

the surface of that substance has less traveled than one that is reflected from the atomic planes in 

the bulk. This means that the two waves have a difference in their reflection path. This difference is 

related to the planes distance, dhkl, and the angle at which the X-ray penetrates into the material. 

The two waves are in phase if the one reflected from the atomic layers has traveled a whole 

number of wavelengths while inside the material. Thus when n is an integer, the reflected waves 

from different atomic planes are in phase, and a constructive interference is produced. In case n is 

not an integer, destructive interference occurs, and no diffraction pattern is produced.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 24 - Bragg’s Law representation: the path length difference between X-rays hitting parallel 
atomic planes has to be a multiple of their wavelength.76 

 

In order to analyse crystals, X-ray diffractometers are fundamental. They consist of three basic 

elements, an X-ray tube, a sample holder, and an X-ray detector.75 In the cathode tube, X-rays are 

produced by the impact of electrons on a target. The electrons are formed after heating a filament 

and applying a voltage that accelerates them to the target. Electrons with enough energy can rip 

electrons of inner shells of the target, and, so, X-rays spectra are produced (Fig.25).  



 

 

32 Part 1. Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 25 - X-ray production through quantum phenomena explanation.78 

 

Many electronic transitions occur in the atoms when the target is stricken so that many 

wavelengths are produced from the atomic shells. Consequently, in the spectra, several 

components will be present. As the K? radiations (from the K? shell) are the most energetic, in 

order to obtain the right diffraction intensities, some filters are applied such as foils or crystals 

monochrometers that absorb the wavelengths less energetic than K?. The most common targets 

used for the production of X-rays are Molybdenum and Copper. The K? radiations produced by 

Molybdenum and Copper have wavelengths of 0.7107Å and 0.15406 Å respectively. Once 

produced, X-rays are directed to the sample. When the geometry of the incident X-rays against the 

sample satisfies the Bragg Equation, constructive interference occurs. The detector collects the 

signal of the diffracted X-rays, converts it into a count rate and sends it to a device such as a 

computer monitor. 

Both powder X-ray diffractometers and single crystal X-ray diffractometers have similar 

instrumentation. Nevertheless, in the single crystal case, the diffractometers use either 3- or 4-

circle goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (?, ?, ?, and ?) that define the 

relationship between the crystal lattice, the incident ray and the detector.75 Samples are mounted 



 

 

33 Part 1. Introduction 

on thin glass fibers that are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer heads. 

Adjustment of the x, y and z orthogonal directions allows the centering of the crystal within the X-

ray beam (Fig. 26). 

When radiation hits the single crystal, three following phenomena occur: transmission, 

reflection, and diffraction. A beam stopper blocks the transmitted radiations to avoid the burning of 

the detector. The detector due to the angles involved does not pick up the reflected rays. Just the 

diffracted rays are collected.

1. 5.4 Single crystal growth 

 

The goal in growing crystals for a single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment is to grow single 

crystals of suitable size. The optimum size for a crystal is one that has dimensions of 0.2 - 0.4 mm 

in at least two of the three dimensions.  

Crystals and single crystals are obtained depending on the relative rate of nucleation and 

growth. A fast nucleation means really small crystals or agglomerates. On the other hand, fast rate 

of growth implies the inclusion of defects in the crystal structure. The right compromise for a 

perfect single crystal has not been discovered. Anyway, different crystallization methods have 

been developed. 

Most of the single crystals are obtained from solution. When a solution is oversaturated the 

crystal precipitates out. There are numerous factors during crystal growth, which affect both the 

size and the quality of the crystal. The most important are purity of compounds, crystallization 



 

 

34 Part 1. Introduction 

solvent, number of nucleation sites, mechanical agitation applied to the system, and time.79 Several 

techniques of crystal growth from solution exist. Herein, just some of them are presented. 

Slow evaporation (Fig. 27a) is the simplest one and consists of the preparation of a suitable 

solution with the desired compounds. This is left in a clean container, with a large surface and not 

tightly covered to favour solvent evaporation. To avoid a fast nucleation, the sample is subjected to 

the less disturb as possible. The performance of this technique is easy but the probability to obtain 

small crystallites or agglomerates is high as the oversaturation point is rapidly reached. 

Vapour diffusion (Fig. 27b) is a method that needs a binary system of solvents. Both solvents 

have to be miscible one to each other, but with different boiling points. The one with the higher 

boiling point is called solvent, and that with a lower boiling point is called precipitant. The 

compound has to be dissolved in the solvent. After transferring the mixture in a vial, this is put in a 

container with the precipitant, and sealed. Over the time, the precipitant, which is more volatile, will 

diffuse over the gas phase into the solvent, leading to oversaturation, nucleation and, if all goes 

well, finally crystallization.79 

Liquid-liquid diffusion (Fig. 27c) even in this technique a binary solvent system is necessary. 

Differently, from the previous method, the two solvents have different densities. Once the solution 

with the proper compound is ready, the second solvent with a different density is gently poured 

over that with a syringe to avoid the immediate mixture of the two liquids. Over the time, the 

solvents will mix and crystals will be formed. 

Finally, in slow cooling method (Fig. 27d) a nearly saturated solution of the compound or close 

to the boiling point of the solvent is prepared. Afterwards, it is transferred to a clean container and 

covered. This is placed in a heat bath at about the same temperature and left to cool down slowly. 

The above-listed methods single crystals growth are all from solution. It is possible to obtain single 

crystals both from melt solutions and from gas phases75 but for the present project, they were not 

taken into consideration and, thus, they are not explained.

1. 6 Objectives of the work 

 

The main object of this study was to achieve the complexation of a tetracoordinated motif 

through the tetrafunctional Lewis base hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) to give nanoporous 

structures. This tetradentate base has been exploited in previous works combined with Ag(I) salts 

in order to produce supertetrahedral networks with large interstitial cavities.80 

On this purpose, the first goal was to examine the affection of XBs on the crystal packing by 

changing the XB donor molecules. Based on the past works of Raatikainen et al,49,62 the first 

molecules used as XB donors were NCS, NBS, and NIS. We probed the nucleophilicity of nitrogen 

atoms on HMTA molecule even with molecular iodine and iodopentafluorobenzene molecule. One 

more object was to verify the existence of easier ways to obtain the tetracoordinated complex. 

According to the mechanochemistry’ rules,81 we combined N-halosuccinamide with one more 

molecule acting as less active XB donor or as stronger XB donor. 

The strength of the interactions between the halogen and the electronegative atoms of the XB 

acceptor were measured by considering their distance normalized according to the van der Waals 

radii through the formula:

where rx and rN are the vdW radii of the halogen and the nitrogen respectively (Table 7, 

Annexes).82 

All structures were obtained by crystallization methods from solution. Even if the real influence 

of the solvents on the halogen bonds is not still stated, it has been deduced83 that complexation 

through halogen bonds recognition occurs in apolar and aprotic polar solvents. According to this 

consideration, we used apolar and aprotic polar solvents to verify the minimum competition 

between halogen and hydrogen interactions.

To HMTA (20 mg, 0.143 mmol) dissolved in chloroform (22 ml), solid NBS (101.80 mg, 0.572 

mmol) were added in portions. Solid NBS dissolution required exhaustive shaking. The clear yellow

3.     Results and discussion 

 

3.1 Structure (HMTACH2OH)
+Cl- 

 

The addition of a solution of NCS in chloroform to a solution of HMTA in ACN led to the 

formation of a salt, Scheme 1. 

NCS is used for chlorinations and as a mild oxidant. In fact, it is known to be a good chlorine 

provider in radical reactions. On the other hand, the high electronegativity that characterizes the 

chlorine atom makes NCS belonging to the category of weak XB donors. Indeed, it is stated that 

halogens and derivatives work as XB donors, and the tendency to form strong interactions is I &gt; Br 

&gt; Cl &gt;&gt; F.90 For equal electron withdrawal moieties, compared to NBS and NIS, it is less 

polarizable, and its ?-hole potential is less electropositive. Thus, it is less prominent on interacting 

as XB donor. 

The chlorine anion that forms the salt with the HMTA molecule is provided both from the N-

halosuccinamide and from the chloroform. The low polarity of chlorine does not favour XB 

formation, and as expected, none of the XB interactions is present in the final crystal structure. 

 

3.2 Structure (HMTA) •Br2 

 

Initially, the HMTA molecule was mixed with NIS in one to four ratios from ACN solution. White 

powder precipitates were obtained. The fast reaction between the halogen atoms and the 

nucleophilic sites of HMTA prevented the arrangement of the synthons through hydrogen 

interactions. The saturated solution precipitated, and white solids appeared. 

The substitution of the aprotic polar solvent ACN with others such as acetone, nitromethane, 

DCM, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, and toluene, either gave white precipitates or decomposed 

products. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidant


 

 

49 Part 3. Results and discussion 

Passing from NIS to NBS, less strong as XB donor, colourless crystals formation occurred. The 

crystallographic structure analysis revealed they consisted of (HMTA)•Br2 complexes.  

The nitrogen atom of the Lewis base interacts through XB with the molecular bromine. This 

latter is the result of radical’s reactions to which NBS molecule undergoes. After the cleavage of 

the covalent bond between the nitrogen and the bromine in the NBS molecule, free bromine 

radicals reacted together to form the correspondent molecular form.  

Dihalogens can act as XB donors and, so, tend to form short contact interactions with the 

relative acceptor molecules. Indeed the distance between the positively charged bromine and the 

most nucleophilic nitrogen of HMTA results 2.088 Å, 38.8% less than the sum of their vdW radii.91 

The short and strong XB induces an elongation of the covalently bound bromines (Fig. 28a and b). 

Furthermore, the high strength of the XB is reflected by its high directionality. The angle formed 

between the nitrogen atom and the bromines is almost linear (175.25°).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 28 -  A view of the structure (HMTA)•(Br)2 with the distances of the halogen bonds (a), the 
relative CPK representation (b) and the crystal packing along the a-axis (c) and the b-axis (d). 

 

The crystal structure analysis revealed that crystal packing is caused by hydrogen bonding 

forces. The nucleophilic bromine of the dihalogen alongside its electron density cloud interacts with 



 

 

50 Part 3. Results and discussion 

the –C-H moieties of adjacent HMTA molecules. Parallel, the free nitrogens in HMTA molecules 

(not participating on XBs’ formation) exercise their electron withdrawal action to the –CH groups of 

adjacent HMTA molecules (Fig. 28c and d). 

Even if the XB acceptor molecule, HMTA, is tetrafunctional, in terms of energy (HMTA)•Br2 

adducts are more stable.  

 

3.3 Structure (HMTA)•2(C6F5I) 

 

The trials performed with HMTA and NBS gave a complex where a molecular bromine interacts 

just with one nitrogen atom of HMTA. In a first step, thus, the attention of the work was turned to 

the analysis of the nucleophilicity of the Lewis base. 

In this perspective, new XB donors were used to test HMTA nucleophilicity. Generally, strongly 

electronegative perfluoroalkyl residues further enhance the Lewis acid character (electron 

accepting ability) of halogen atoms in perfluorocarbon halides.92 This fact led to choose 

iodopentafluorobenzene (C6F5I) and make it react with the tetrafunctional HMTA. Its benzene ring 

withdraws the electron density cloud of the iodine atom, and the electropositive ?-hole is 

intensified. As some studies reveal, the presence of fluorine atoms increases both the magnitude 

and the size of the ?-hole on iodine.93 

Figures 29a and b show the dimers formed through XB interactions between the Iodine atoms 

and two of the four nitrogen atoms. Both contacts are short with R1=21.5% and R2=20.7% less 

than the sum of the vdW radii of the iodine and nitrogen atoms.91 As shown, the distances of the 

two moieties are different meaning that one bonding is formed before the second one. This fact 

relies on the polarizability of the nitrogen atoms. The first nucleophile site is enough polarized to 

form a short contact distance with the iodine. Although less electronegative, the second nitrogen is 

again enough polarized to create a new bond with the other iodine but less strong than the first 

one. The resulting contact lengths are different.

In Figure 29c is evident that XB, HB, ? interactions participate in the packing of the crystal. 

Interestingly, the electronegative fluorine shows its amphoteric character, interacting through its 

restricted ?-hole with the electron-rich lateral side of other fluorine atoms. 

The nucleophilic character of HMTA was tested, and by the obtained results, just two nitrogen 

atoms are able to interact through XB. 

In the following paragraphs, we will describe more experiments performed to verify again the 

nucleophilic character of the XB acceptor.

3.4 Structure (HMTA)•2(I2) 

 

The crystal structure of Figure 30a shows an HMTA molecule surrounded by two I2. The N---I 

distances are shorter than those obtained with C6F5I (2.474 Å and 2.485 Å). This fact is reliable on 

the steric hindrance caused by the bigger C6F5I molecules.

atoms and the elongation of the molecular iodine (a), the relative CPK representation (b) and the

Even in this case, the interaction of the synthons occurred just with two nitrogen atoms. The 

different contact distance of the two XBs witnesses the interaction are formed at different times.  

The crystal structure (Fig. 30c) reveals the presence of hydrogen bridges among the synthons. 

More specifically the -CH moieties of Lewis base interact with the free nitrogens of adjacent HMTA 

molecules and with the electronegative iodine. Chains that interlink and stack in a dislocated

manner to optimize the dispersion interactions between the iodines and the CH groups form the 

crystal packing. 

 

3.5 Structure (HMTA)•2(BrCl) 

 

More trials led to combine HMTA simultaneously with the strong XB donor NBS and with the 

weak XB donor NCS. 

The crystal product is represented in Figure 31. Neither NBS nor NCS participated in the 

complexation of the structure. The chlorine atom provided by the NCS is attached to the bromine 

atom from the NBS molecule.  

The bromine atoms interact with two nitrogen atoms on HMTA molecule. The intensified 

electropositive potential of bromine comes from the withdrawal effect of the electronegative 

chlorine atom. Generally, in dihalogen molecules, the activation of the halogen participating in a 

halogen bond increases with the decreasing atomic number of the second halogen.93 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 31 - A view of the structure (HMTA)•2(BrCl) with the distances between bromine and

Both contact distances are short (2.166 Å and 2.145 Å), 36.29% and 36.91% less than the sum 

of the vdW91 radii. Due to polarization effect on the Lewis base, the XB cannot be formed

54 Part 3. Results and discussion 

simultaneously, and the contact distances result with different lengths. Consequently, the 

elongation of the Cl-Br bond is different, as Figure 31a shows. 

The electronegative side on chlorine atom interacts with the C-H groups of HMTA molecules in 

adjacent synthons, forming linear columns. These interlink one with another through hydrogen 

bonds between C-H groups of HMTA and the free nitrogen atoms in adjacent HMTA molecules 

(Fig. 31c). 

 

3.6 Structure (HMTA)•2(ICl) 

 

In the prospective to obtain the final crystalline structure of (HMTA)•4(NIS), HMTA, NIS and 

NCS were combined together. The crystallization solvent used was again the aprotic polar ACN. 

The results were similar to those achieved with NBS, in structure 3.5. 

Figure 32 shows the final crystal structure obtained by the slow evaporation process. The 

contact distances of the XBs are 2.328 Å and 2.360 Å respectively, 34.05% and 33.14% less the 

sum of their vdW radii.91

55 Part 3. Results and discussion 

As most of the previous complexes, the different length between both distances indicated the 

fact they are not formed simultaneously. The nitrogen atom exercises a withdrawal action on the 

iodine causing the elongation of the covalent bond with the chlorine.  

In the crystal packing (Fig. 32c), the motifs interlink and stack in chains through hydrogen bonds 

between the -CH moieties, the nitrogens, and the chlorines of adjacent XB acceptor molecules. 

 

3.7 Structure (HMTA)•2(NBP) 

 

N-bromophthalimide (NBP) molecule possesses an intensified electropositive potential along 

the covalent bond N-Br due to the higher withdrawal effect of the benzene ring.  

The dropwise addition of NBP solution to the HMTA led to the precipitation of colourless 

crystalline blocks from a non-homogeneous solution, with a crystal structure belonging to the 

orthorhombic space group Pmn21 (Fig. 33).

56 Part 3. Results and discussion 

The crystallographic analysis revealed the formation of linear chains formed through hydrogen 

bonds between the -CH moieties and one of the nitrogen atoms of the HMTA molecule. Due to 

steric hindrance effects, the arrangement of the chains results in alternatively parallel rows. 

Differently, from all the previous listed structures, both XB distances are 2.388 Å, 29.76% less than 

the sum of their vdW radii (Fig. 33a and b).91 Nevertheless, the polarization energy did not lead to 

the formation of the tetracoordinated complex. 

The angle formed between the NBP molecule and the HMTA one is not as linear as expected 

(172.25°). Even if the bond strength is high, the steric hindrance of NBP molecule makes the XB 

donors assume a small angle alongside the noncovalent bond. 

 

3.8 Structure (HMTA)•2(NBS) 

 

The solvate crystal structure shown in Figure 34 recalls the reported one in 2013 by Raatikainen 

et al.62 

The complex was obtained by adding neat NBS directly to a solution of HMTA in chloroform. 

This strategy aimed to avoid the cleavage of the covalently bound bromine-nitrogen atoms. In fact, 

N-bromosuccinimide is known to be a reagent employed mostly in free radical allylic and benzylic 

brominations, and for the electrophilic substitution of aromatic rings.94 The addition of solid NBS to 

a solution of HMTA increases the probability to have a direct interaction between the Lewis acid 

and the Lewis base. 

 As expected, Figures 34a and b show two NBS molecules attached to one HMTA molecule. 

Differently from the N-bromophthalimide case, contact distances result to be not of the same 

length, 2.427 Å and 2.398 Å, 28.62% and 29.47% less than the sum of their vdW radii.91 

In the crystallization process, the choice of the solvent played a key role. Chloroform is a 

halogenated solvent containing hydrogen atoms, thus, halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding co-

exist.95 Moreover, solvation had a significant influence on halogen bonding.83 As the structure 

analysis shows, the framework contains chloroform molecules (Fig. 34c). They act as templates. 



 

 

57 Part 3. Results and discussion 

The acidic CH groups and the negative chlorines induced the dimeric complexation of the ligands. 

The formed dimers are interconnected through hydrogen bonds between the negative C=O- of 

NBS and the acidic C-H groups of HMTA.

Even if the use of chloroform led to the complexation of the dimer, the resulting bulk system 

presents both the crystal precipitates and other white powder precipitates resulting a non-

homogenous system. 

 

3.9 Structure (HMTA)•4(NBS) @CH2Cl2 

 

A particular porous structure was obtained by diluting HMTA and NBS after being ground 

together in DCM. The complex corresponds to three molecules of NBS interacting with the 

nucleophilic sites of the HMTA through XBs. Even if the contact distances are different for the three 

interactions, all of them result remarkably short (Fig. 35). The shorter bond (2.371 Å) was firstly

58 Part 3. Results and discussion 

formed. This fact induced a depolarization of the rest part of the HMTA molecule. Consequently, 

the second XB results stronger than the third one (2.378 Å and 2.411 Å respectively). 

As expected for an n to ? interaction,96 also in this case, the halogen bond is directional. The 

angle between the covalent and noncovalent bonds is approximately of 180° confirming that the 

XB is preferentially along the axis of the orbital containing the lone pair of the electron donor. 

Moreover the shorter the interactions, the more directional they are. Indeed, as the lengths of the 

three bonds increase, the relative angles decrease from 177.90° of the shorter bond to 175.37°of 

the longer one.

Figure 36 describes the CPK representations of the complex. The figure on the left shows the 

nucleophilic-electrophilic interaction between the carbonyl group of the XB donor and the electron-

rich nitrogen atom of HMTA.  

The crystal structure reveals the hydrogen bonding presence both between the acidic CH2 

groups of the HMTA with the OC- of the NBS molecules, and between the OC- with the acidic CH2 

of adjacent NBS molecules (fig. 37b). The competition between XBs and HBs led to the self-

assembly of a porous structure. Figure 37 shows one-dimensional channels with a diameter of

3.10 Structure (HMTA)•4(NBS) @CCl4 

 

The persistent studies of the behavior of the NBS molecule with the nucleophilic tetrafunctional 

HMTA led to the complexation of the (HMTA)•(NBS)4 motif, solvated with tetrachloromethane 

molecules. The complex was obtained adopting the liquid-liquid diffusion crystallization technique. 

The white interlayer formed after the addition of tetrachloromethane corresponded to a colloidal 

dispersion. Tetrachloromethane firstly induced a fast reaction and, then, due to the diffusion 

process, the system self-assembled around the solvent molecules and a host-channel system was 

formed (Fig. 38). The guest molecules adapted into the cavity through the electrostatic interactions 

with the acidic protons of the NBS molecules. The channels occupy a volume of 934.3 Å3/cell, the 

41.5 % of the unit cell.  

The overall structure grew around the main motif (HMTA)•4(NBS) (Fig. 39), characterized by 

extremely short XB between the bromine and the nitrogen atoms, 2.401 Å, 29.38 % less than the 

sum of their vdW radii.91 Differently, from the previous structures, all four-contact distances are of 

the same length. The polarization strength of the nucleophilic sites on the Lewis base, therefore, is 

equal. This fact is confirmed by the directionality of the four interactions. All four angles are almost 

linear, 179.33°, reflecting the high strength of the formed XBs.  

As reported in Raatikainen et al.,62 even if the complex is based on halogen interactions, the 

structure’ skeleton is built up through those of hydrogen type. Figure 38c puts on evidence the 

hydrogen interactions between the acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA molecule and the C=O
- groups 

of the NBS one.  

Further studies have to be developed in order to test the stability of the pores by changing the 

guest molecules. The coexistence of these crystal precipitates with others in the bulk prevents the 

calculations of the crystals yield from solution.

3.11 Structure (HMTA)•2(NIS) 

 

This structure was obtained by the combination of several crystallization techniques. Firstly, the 

NIS molecule in a solution of DCM was slowly added to a solution of HMTA in chloroform, forming 

two separates layers with an interface. The separation was remarked by the instant formation of 

white colloids. Just after one day, crystalline colourless needles appeared but they re-dissolved 

into a solution that turned from colourless to a violet strong colour.  

The instant formation of colloids occurred because nucleation took place at a high degree of 

supersaturation, so that the volume growth proceeds too quickly.75 Consequently, a third layer was 

introduced in the interface between the two solutions to slow down the nucleation process. The 

HMTA solution was covered by the aprotic ACN, which acted as a diffusion chamber. Thus, NIS 

solution was added. After three days, thin crystalline plates precipitated from solution. The 

experiment was reproduced changing the crystallization solvents combination. Instead of 

solubilizing the ligands in apolar solvents, both of them were solubilized in ACN. The interlayer 

between the two solutions corresponded to a les polar solvent, such as chloroform, DCM, 

tetrachloromethane and toluene. The results were the same, thin crystalline plates were obtained.  

Figure 40 presents the motif of the crystal. The contact distances of both halogen interaction are 

the same, 2.465 Å. They result 30.17% shorter than the sum of their vdW radii.91 

Even in this case, the system did not present just one type of precipitates. This inhomogeneity 

affects the yield, and just a small amount of crystalline precipitates was possible to obtain.

64 Part 3. Results and discussion 

Each distance between the iodine and the nitrogen atoms belonging to HMTA is remarkably 

short, 2.501 Å, which is about 29.15% shorter than the sum of their vdW radii.91 The angle of the 

bond, 177.79°, is almost linear confirming again the strong nature of the interaction.  

This stable supramolecular ribbon results when the self-complementary complexes stack and 

interlink via multiple H-bonds from acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA molecule to C=O groups of the 

adjacent NIS moieties (Fig. 42).49 

The adducts are assembled parallel forming a porous structure, where the channels occupy a 

volume of 949.1 Å3, four per cell, the 40.6% of the unit cell. The acidic CH2 groups of the HMTA 

favour the adaptation of DCM guest molecules into the cavities. The stability of the channels, thus, 

results reinforced by the templating effect of the solvent molecules. 

As already shown, the crystal was obtained dissolving the ground neat starting materials in 

DCM. This fact implies that scheme 12 does not represent completely the reaction that led to the 

formation of this complex. The initial compounds, HMTA, NCS, and I2, have already reacted in the 

mortar under the pestle action. A single crystal X-ray analysis cannot furnish the crystal structure of 

the powder material. Methodology for structure determination of molecular solids from powder X-

ray diffraction data can be applied to establish the effectiveness of the new solid phase.31 For 

technical reasons, powder X-Ray was not performed. 

Both NCS and I2 are compound used in radical and electrophilic reactions. When ground 

together, the probability to form radicals increases due to the pressure applied by the mortar 

action. Once in solution, the molecular recognition induces the self-assembling forming, thus, the 

complex (HMTA)•4(NIS). The precipitation of the crystal occurred once the solution was 

oversaturated and the colourless needles started to grow. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneity of the 

bulk system prevented the calculation of the yield. The use of chloroform instead of DCM led to 

twin crystals, not good enough for a single crystal X-ray analysis.

66 Part 4. Conclusions 

4. Conclusions 

 

The present study gives an overview of several molecular crystal structures obtained by the 

combination of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) with different halogen bond donors. The 

nucleophilic character of the XB acceptor is affected both by the type of the halogen bond donor 

and by the experimental conditions.  

The first crystalline structures were obtained by simply mixing solutions and leaving them under 

either vapor diffusion or slow evaporation at room temperature. The results have shown mostly 

motifs with XB characterized by short contact distances; nevertheless, in most of the cases, the 

complexation of the structure is due to hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. 

When neat NBS was added directly to a solution of HMTA in chloroform, the polarized bromines 

interacted with the four nitrogen atoms, forming the solvated structure of (HMTA)•4(NBS) with 

short contact distances. Parallel, the mixture of HMTA and NIS solutions through the layering 

technique led to the crystallization of stable dimers.  

Mechanochemistry techniques maximized the electrophilic and nucleophilic interactions. In fact, 

by grinding HMTA molecules with weak and strong XB donors, such as NCS and molecular iodine, 

respectively, a solvated porous structure with stable 3D channels was obtained. The combination 

of mechanochemistry, with the traditional crystallization techniques, led to the final porous crystal 

structures.  

Nonetheless, some practical factors influenced the results such as the inhomogeneity of the 

bulk system. Indeed, the quality of the crystals resulted proper for single crystal X-Ray analysis, 

but the amount obtained from solution was small.  

In futures works, special attention should be given to the characterization of the participant 

ligands in the assembly of the final architecture throughout every step. X-Ray powder diffraction, 

nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and single crystal X-Ray diffraction would suffice to 

characterize the ligands when in powder, in solution and in the final structure, single crystal.
