RESUMO 

O biodiesel é um combustível líquido obtido a partir de fontes renováveis através da 

reação de transesterificação de triglicerídeos. O interesse por este combustível está 

relacionado com uma nova tendência: a procura de alternativas às fontes de energia 

baseadas em petróleo. A sua utilização está associada a vários benefícios 

ambientais, como a redução da emissão de poluentes. No entanto, devido ao 

elevado custo associado à sua matéria-prima usual, como os óleos vegetais 

comestíveis, o biodiesel não é no momento atual economicamente viável. Portanto, 

há uma necessidade de reduzir o preço final deste combustível. Uma das formas de 

reduzir os custos será a de se utilizarem matérias-primas mais baratas no processo 

de produção, como óleos usados ou não comestíveis. A principal característica 

dessas matérias-primas mais baratas é a baixa qualidade quando comparada com 

os óleos comestíveis. Esta baixa qualidade está normalmente associada a um alto 

teor em ácidos gordos livres (AGL) e/ou água. Os AGLs presentes na matéria-prima 

devem ser convertidos em biodiesel, também conhecido por ésteres metílicos de 

ácidos gordos (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters: FAME), por uma reação de esterificação. A 

reação de esterificação não pode ser promovida por catalisadores alcalinos, 

geralmente aplicados na transesterificação, como o NaOH ou o KOH. Os 

catalisadores alcalinos na presença de AGLs levam à formação de sabão, 

consumindo o catalisador, diminuindo a sua atividade catalítica e tornando a 

separação dos produtos finais mais complexa. Apenas os catalisadores ácidos são 

capazes de promover a reação de esterificação de AGLs. Os catalisadores ácidos 

são capazes de catalisar ambas as reações, no entanto, a velocidade da reação de 

transesterificação é cerca de 4000 vezes mais lenta do que quando se utilizam 

catalisadores alcalinos [1,2], levando a longos tempos de reação e, 

consequentemente, custos elevados de produção. Desta forma, existe uma 

crescente necessidade de encontrar catalisadores alternativos que promovam tanto 

a reação de transesterificação quanto a reação de esterificação em condições mais 

favoráveis. Atualmente, os líquidos iónicos têm sido utilizados como uma alternativa 



iv 
 

aos catalisadores convencionais. Os líquidos iónicos são sais fundidos compostos 

por um catião orgânico e um anião orgânico ou inorgânico. No presente estudo 

avalia-se a utilização do catalisador hidrogenossulfato de 1-metilimidazólio 

([HMIM][HSO4]) na produção de biodiesel através da reação de esterificação do 

ácido oleico. A influência dos principais parâmetros (tempo, temperatura, razão 

molar metanol/ácido oleico e quantidade de catalisador) foi estudada através de uma 

metodologia de superfície de resposta conhecida por Box-Behnken Design (BBD), 

avaliando duas repostas: a conversão de ácido oleico e o conteúdo de FAMEs. 

Concluiu-se que os parâmetros mais relevantes para ambas as respostas foram a 

razão molar entre os reagentes e a quantidade de catalisador. As condições ótimas 

para a conversão foram determinadas como sendo 8 h, 110°C, 15:1 relação molar 

metanol/ácido oleico e uma quantidade de catalisador de 15% em massa, resultando 

numa conversão de 95% e para o conteúdo de FAMEs foram 8 h, 110 °C, uma razão 

molar de 14:1 e uma dosagem de catalisador de 13,5% em peso, conduzindo a um 

conteúdo de ésteres metílicos de ácidos gordos de 90%. Foram também 

determinados os parâmetros cinéticos da reação. A energia de ativação foi estimada 

em 6.8 kJ/mol e o fator pré-exponencial em 0.0765 L

ABSTRACT 

Biodiesel is a liquid fuel obtained from several renewable sources by 

transesterification reaction of triglycerides. Its development is related to a new 

tendency: the search for alternatives to petroleum-based energy sources. Its 

utilization is associated with several environmental benefits, such as a reduction in 

pollutants emissions. However, due to the high cost associated to its usual feedstock, 

such as edible vegetable oils, biodiesel is not economically viable. Therefore, there’s 

a requisite to decrease the final price of this fuel. The logical way is by introducing 

cheaper feedstock into the industrial production, such as non-edible feedstock or 

waste cooking oil. The main characteristic of cheaper feedstock is the high content of 

free fatty acids (FFAs) and/or water when compared to edible feedstock. FFAs 

present on the feedstock must be converted into biodiesel, also referred to as fatty 

acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by an esterification reaction. The esterification reaction 

cannot be catalyzed by alkali catalyst, usually applied in the transesterification such 

as NaOH or KOH. Alkali catalysts in the presence of FFAs lead to the formation of 

soap, consuming the catalyst, decreasing its catalytic activity and turning the 

separation of the final products much more complex. Hence, only acidic catalysts are 

able to promote the esterification reaction of FFAs. Those acidic catalysts are able to 

catalyze both reactions, however, the rate of the transesterification reaction is about 

4000 times slower than for the reactions promoted by alkali catalysts [1,2], leading to 

long reaction times and, again, high costs. In this way, there is an increasing need to 

find alternative catalysts that promote both the transesterification and the 

esterification reaction under adequate conditions. Thus, ionic liquids emerge as an 

alternative to conventional catalysts. Ionic liquids are molten salts composed of an 

organic or inorganic anion and an organic cation. The present study evaluated the 

use of the catalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) in the 

production of biodiesel through the esterification reaction of oleic acid. The influence 

of the main parameters (time, temperature, molar ratio methanol/oleic acid and 

catalyst dosage) on two responses (conversion of oleic acid and FAME content of the 



vi 
 

biodiesel samples) were studied through a response surface methodology (RSM) 

known as Box-Behnken Design (BBD). It was concluded that the most relevant 

parameters for both responses were the molar ratio between the reactants and the 

catalyst dosage. The optimum conditions for the conversion were determined as 

being 8 h, 110 °C, 15:1 molar ratio methanol/oleic acid and a catalyst dosage of 15 

wt%, resulting in a 95% conversion and for the FAME content were 8 h, 110 °C, 14:1 

molar ratio and a catalysts dosage of 13.5 wt%, leading to a content of 90%. The 

kinetics of the reaction were also studied. The activation energy was estimated as 6.8 

kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor as 0.0765 L

1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  

1.1 Background 

Since the industrial revolution in the early 19
th

 century, the demand for energy has 

increased considerably. According to the International Energy Agency (2017) report, 

from 1971 to 2015, the total final consumption of energy doubled, with the 

transportation sector being one of the major responsible for this boost, with a 

consumption share that increased from 23% in 1971 to 29% in 2015. Furthermore, 

the projection presented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2016) in the 

last report affirms that, for the period of 2012 - 2040, the diesel consumption will 

show the largest growth, comparing to all other transportation fuels [3,4]. 

The rising demand for fuels, mainly for the transportation sector, allied with an 

increasing concern for the environment, has been leading several researchers to look 

for alternatives to petroleum-based energy sources. Hence, a new term emerges: 

Biofuels. A biofuel is defined as a liquid or gaseous fuel derived from biomass 

sources, such as wood, vegetation, organic residues, vegetable oils, amongst others 

[5,6]. 

Biofuels have several advantages over traditional fuels obtained from other sources. 

They are obtained from renewable energy sources and have lower impact on the 

environment. Amongst the available biofuels, such as bioethanol, biogas and syngas, 

biodiesel is a good alternative as energy source. Biodiesel has been greatly explored 

in the past decades, but the production process currently applied has several 

drawbacks related to cost issues, environmental concerns, food competition, 

amongst others.  

Hereof, searching for alternative routes to produce biodiesel is a contemporary 

concern. Most of the focus is invested in finding new catalysts that allow overcoming 

the disadvantages of the traditional production process. In this way, ionic liquids 



2 
 

appear as possible substitutes, due to its characteristics that promote a greener 

process.  

1.2 Objectives 

1.2.1 Main objective 

The main objective of this work is to study the biodiesel production by applying ionic 

liquids as catalysts to the esterification reaction between oleic acid and methanol.  

1.2.2 Specific objectives 

? Evaluate the effect of different ionic liquids over the conversion of the 

esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol, for biodiesel production; 

? Estimate the optimal reaction conditions (reaction time, reaction temperature, 

molar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and catalyst dosage) for the 

esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol using a suitable ionic liquid, 

by applying a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) known as Box-Behnken 

Design (BBD);  

? Evaluate the reaction kinetics of the esterification reaction catalyzed by the 

chosen ionic liquid;  

? Assess the performance of the selected ionic liquid in the catalysis of the 

transesterification reaction between a waste cooking oil with high acidity value 

and methanol.

2. BIODIESEL  

Among the many biofuels known, biodiesel emerges as a promising replacement for 

petro diesel. Biodiesel can be defined as a fuel suitable for compression ignition 

engines that is formed by a mixture of fatty acids alkyl esters derived from oils or fats. 

It can be obtained from a transesterification reaction of triglycerides or an 

esterification reaction of free fatty acids and it can be produced from a wide variety of 

raw materials [7,8]. 

Biodiesel has been explored in several locations, including USA, Brazil, and the 

European Union, among others. Globally, the production increased from 15 thousand 

barrels per day in 2000 to 289 thousand barrels per day in 2008. In 2011, the 

European Union produced 22 million tons of biodiesel, against 9.5 million in 2009. 

These numbers only highlight the importance of biodiesel as a fuel [7,9]. 

2.1 Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel 

Biodiesel presents several advantages over diesel derived from petroleum. 

Properties of both fuels are very similar, allowing a mixture of biodiesel and diesel in 

any proportions and implying that it can be employed in diesel engines without major 

changes, with the engine performance remaining practically unaltered. The storage 

and transportation of biodiesel is much safer when compared to regular diesel, due to 

its biodegradability, higher cetane number and higher flash point [7,10]. 

Biodiesel presents, in general, better characteristics than petrodiesel in combustion. 

The unburned hydrocarbons can be reduced by 90% when applying biodiesel and 

aromatic compounds emissions can be reduced by 75% to 90%. For CO2 emissions, 

there is also a significant reduction, mainly when the entire life cycle of the oil is 

considered. Finally, particle emissions are lower and biodiesel can be obtained from 



4 
 

a wide range of renewable sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and algae, 

among others [7,8,10]. 

However, the emissions of nitrogen oxides can be slightly higher. Also, the engine 

speed and power are lower and the cloud and pour point is higher, decreasing the 

engine power by around 5% when compared to petrodiesel. Biodiesel production is 

currently more expensive than petrodiesel due to the high cost associated to 

feedstock [10]. 

2.2 Raw materials for biodiesel production 

Nowadays, biodiesel has a greater cost than petrodiesel due to the raw materials 

employed. Traditionally, most processes apply edible vegetable oils, such as 

soybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil [11]. Those oils have some advantages, 

mainly related to the fact that they do not require a pretreatment. On the other hand, 

those oils have a high cost, leading to an expensive final product. Also, the use of 

such oils could generate competition with the food market, leading to issues related 

to food supply [10].  

Besides edible oils, several other materials can be exploited for biodiesel production, 

such as nonedible oils, for instance jatropha oil, mahua oil, castor oil and cotton seed 

oil [11,12]. Nonedible oils have some compounds in their structure that make them 

unsuitable for human consumption. There are several advantages related to using 

nonedible oils over edible oils, such as their reduced price, the fact that they won’t 

create issues related to food supply, amongst other. The downside is that they are 

usually rich in free fatty acids, which for the traditional biodiesel production poses 

issues related to yield of the reaction and purification of products [13].   

Another possibility is the use of waste cooking oils (WCO), which is any oil that has 

been previously used for cooking or frying, and is, therefore, not suitable for 

consumption anymore. The advantages of applying those oils are that its price is 



5 
 

much lower than refined oils, and likewise, there is no competition with the food 

market. Again, the major disadvantage of this feedstock is the high content of free 

fatty acids and moisture. The quality of the raw materials cited, nonedible oils and 

waste cooking oil, could be increased by applying a number of pretreatments steps. If 

not subjected to treatment, the content of free fatty acids could lead to a 

saponification reaction, decreasing drastically the biodiesel yield and the downstream 

process would be more complex [9,10].  

Another alternative to vegetable oils is the use of algae. The advantages of algae are 

related to their fast growth rate, the high yield of oil produced per acre of plant (up to 

31 times higher than the obtained with other vegetable oils), the fact that they can be 

produced all year around and that they are environmentally friendly. On the other 

hand, production of biodiesel applying algae brings some challenges, mainly related 

to the upstream and downstream process, such as algae dehydration, oil extraction 

and purification process [10,14]. 

Finally, another pointed solution for biodiesel feedstock is animal fat. The main 

advantage of this feedstock is the availability and low price. On the other hand, the 

disadvantages are related to the high content of free fatty acids, which would again 

require pretreatment, and the fact that it results in a biodiesel that cannot be fully 

employed in lower temperatures, due to its higher viscosity. However there are 

studies investigating how to improve the quality of biodiesel derived from animal fats 

[9]. 

Table 1 presents a comparison between the distribution of fatty acids in animal fat, 

edible and non-edible vegetable oil and waste cooking oils. The most common fatty 

acid in oils originated from plants are the palmitic (hexadecanoic  - C16:0), stearic 

(octadecanoic - C18:0), oleic (9(z)-octadecanoic - C18:1), linoleic (9(z)-12(z)-

octadecanoic - C18:2) and linolenic (9(z)-12(z)-15(z)-octadecanoic - C18:3) [15].

2.3 Physical properties of biodiesel 

The physical properties of biodiesel are compared to those of petroleum-based diesel 

presented in Table 2. The most important property of biodiesel is the kinetic viscosity, 

since it is directly related to the fuel injection in the engine. The lower the viscosity, 

the better is the injection operation. According to Table 2, it is clear that the biodiesel 

is a viable replacement for petroleum based diesel, since the viscosity of a regular 

diesel fuel is in the range of 12 to 3.5 mm
2
/s and the viscosity for biodiesel produced 

from several sources are within that range. [10].

The cetane number is a measurement of the ignition quality of the fuel. The higher it 

is, the shorter the ignition delay, implying that a higher cetane number leads to a fuel 

with better quality. For biodiesel, as it can be seen on Table 2, the cetane number is 

slightly higher than for diesel due to the higher oxygen content of biodiesel. Usually, 

the longer the fatty acid chain is, the higher cetane number of the resulting biodiesel 

will be [16]. 

Other relevant properties are the cloud point and the pour point. Those properties are 

related to the applicability of the fluid in low temperatures. Biodiesel displays higher 

cloud point and pour point, which means that biodiesel is more difficult to be 

employed in low temperatures than diesel [10]. Finally, biodiesel shows great 

combustion efficiency, due to its oxygen content. Furthermore, biodiesel can extend 

the life of diesel engine, due to its lubricating properties [10]. 

2.4 Methods for biodiesel production 

Vegetable oils rich in triglycerides are a promising replacement to petroleum-based 

diesel. The main issue with applying those oils as fuel is the high viscosity exhibited 

by them, which would require major changes in the regular diesel engine. Therefore, 

the main objective for biodiesel production is to lower the viscosity of the employed 

oils. The differences in the viscosities of oils and biodiesel can be easily observed in 

Table 3, where the properties of several vegetable oils are compared to the 

properties of diesel fuel. By comparing the values of viscosity displayed on Table 3 to 

those displayed on Table 2, it is very clear that the objective of lowering the viscosity 

of the oils is reached.  

There are several methods to approximate the properties of triglycerides-based fuels 

to diesel properties, such as pyrolysis, microemulsion, dilution and transesterification 

[8,16].

Transesterification has shown to be a favorable reaction to obtain triglycerides 

derivatives (known as biodiesel) with properties close to those of diesel. The oils 

employed might contain an amount of free fatty acids, which can be converted to 

biodiesel through an esterification reaction. Both reactions – transesterification and 

esterification – are equilibrium reactions [8,17]. 

2.4.1 Esterification 

Free fatty acids are carboxylic acids and they are converted to esters by a 

condensation reaction with alcohols, also known as esterification. The reaction can 

only be accomplished if the equilibrium is driven towards product formation, such as 

when there is an excess of reactants or one of the products is continuously removed 

from the reaction media [18]. Figure 1 shows the general scheme for an esterification 

reaction. Carboxylic acid (1) reacts with an alcohol (2), giving rise to water (3) and an 

ester (4).

9 
 

The mechanism in which the esterification reaction of carboxylic acids occurs is 

tetrahedral. The reaction happens in five steps, as shown on Figure 2. First, the 

oxygen belonging to the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid (1) is pronated by the 

acid catalyst (2), making the carbonyl group a much stronger electrophile (3). Then, 

the electrophile undergoes 1,2-addition by the alcohol (4), giving origin to a 

tetrahedral intermediate (5). The proton from the alcohol is transferred to the OH 

group. Then, there’s a 1,2-elimination of water, which leads to a protonated ester (6) 

and water (7). The protonated ester then loses the proton, regenerating the catalyst 

(2) and generating the ester (8) [19].

2.4.2 Transesterification 

The transesterification reaction is performed using oils rich in triglycerides with a 

short chain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst. 

Methanol is widely used in most countries due to its low cost, although in a few 

countries, such as Brazil, ethanol can be applied. Biodiesel obtained from 



10 
 

transesterification with methanol can also be referred as Fatty Acids Methyl Esters 

(FAMEs) [17].  

Figure 3 shows a scheme for the transesterification reaction. The stoichiometry 

dictates that it is necessary 3 moles of alcohol (2) for each triglyceride (1) in order to 

achieve a stoichiometric conversion but it is common to use much higher molar ratios 

in order to force the reaction in the direction of product formation.  The reaction gives 

glycerol (3) as by-product and 3 moles of ester (4). It is an equilibrium reaction and 

the reaction requires a catalyst. Usually, catalysts with an alkali character are 

employed. If water or carboxylic acids (free fatty acids) are present under alkali 

catalyzed reaction, it can lead to hydrolysis of the alcoholic ester and saponification 

[20].

Source: Andreani and Rocha (2012) [17] 

The mechanism for the transesterification reaction catalyzed by an acidic catalyst is 

displayed on Figure 4. This mechanism was proposed by Ishak et al. (2017). The 

catalyst (2) promotes the transesterification reaction by donating a proton to the 

carbonyl group of the triglyceride (1), turning it into a stronger electrophile (3). The 

electrophile (3) then reacts with the short chain alcohol (4), through a nucleophilic 

substitution, forming molecules of diglyceride (6), esters (7) and a proton, which will 

catalyze the next set of reactions [21]. The diglyceride will then be converted into 



11 
 

monoglyceride, which will then be converted into glycerol. Each step gives rise to one 

mole of an ester.

2.4.3 Catalysts 

Both reactions discussed in the previous section require a catalyst in order to achieve 

a reaction time and reaction conversions that are suitable for industrial processes. 

The most common processes use alkali catalysts; however, other catalysts can be 

applied, such as acidic catalysts and enzymes. 

Alkali catalysts can only catalyze the transesterification reaction. The most applied 

ones are NaOH and KOH. The transesterification reaction catalyzed by a basic 

catalyst has the advantage of being much faster than the acid-catalyzed reaction 



12 
 

(about four thousand times faster), but the presence of even a small amount of water 

and/or free fatty acids can lead to a saponification reaction, consuming the catalyst 

and lowering the catalytic performance. It can also influence the downstream 

process, making the separation of the final product more complex. Some authors 

suggest that the transesterification reaction under basic catalysis must be performed 

with anhydrous refined oils with free fatty acids content lower than 0.5%, thus, 

requiring the use of edible or refined feedstock. As already mentioned, edible 

feedstock is expensive, leading to a final product with high prices, which is 

economically non-viable [7,8,21].  

On the other hand, the acidic catalysts are able to promote both the esterification and 

transesterification reactions, thus allowing the use of cheaper feedstock with higher 

content of Free Fatty Acids (FFA) and water. However, the employment of acidic 

catalyst for the transesterification reaction has several disadvantages:  it is much 

slower than the basic catalyzed reaction and it requires a considerable amount of 

alcohol to shift the equilibrium towards product formation, usually a proportion of 30-

150:1 moles of methanol to moles of triglycerides, for instance. Also, catalysts that 

are highly acidic can lead to equipment corrosion [17,21].  

Another possibility that has been studied is the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Lipases 

can be used as catalysts for biodiesel production, having several advantages, for 

instance the high selectivity and the use under mild conditions. Also, it is easier to 

recover the glycerol obtained as byproduct and the FAMEs are simpler to purify. Yet, 

enzymes can be deactivated due to contamination of side products or even by 

organic solvents and they are usually expensive [22,23]. The methods discussed for 

biodiesel production are summarized on Table 4. 

In this way, the latest research has been focused on looking for alternative synthesis, 

mainly focusing on designing processes that allow the use of low-cost feedstock in 

order to decrease biodiesel price and turn biodiesel into a competitive fuel. Ionic 



13 
 

liquids have been explored as an alternative to traditional catalysts, due to the fact 

that they may overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional methods [24].

3. IONIC LIQUIDS 

Ionic Liquids (ILs) can be defined as organic salts that are consisted of ions (an 

organic cation and an organic or inorganic anion) and, opposed to inorganic salts, 

remain liquid at room temperatures. The melting temperatures of those salts lay 

usually below 100ºC due to the presence of a delocalized charge and large ions, 

causing packing to be difficult [17,26,27]. 

There are several advantages related to the use of ionic liquids. Due to the 

interactions between the anion and cation, they have negligible vapor pressure, a 

good solubility in both organic and inorganic materials, they are non-flammable, have 

a high catalytic activity and can be easily manipulated in order to achieve a specific 

property, just by changing the anion/cation combination, and thus being referred to 

as Task Specific Ionic Liquid (TSIL). This variation in the anion/cation combination is 

also advantageous in terms of variety, since it can give origin to at least 1 million 

binary ionic liquids and potentially 10
18

 ternary ionic liquids, comparing to only 600 

organic solvents. Besides, they are easily recyclable, can be used under mild 

conditions and produce less waste [13,17,27].  

Ionic liquids can exhibit acidic, basic or neutral characteristics. The ability to present 

an acidic character (which could be depicted as Brønsted, Lewis or both) could be 

linked to the cation and/or the anion and their character may influence greatly their 

ability to catalyze a reaction. There are studies trying to connect the acidity of an 

ionic liquid to its catalytic activity in biodiesel production [28,29]. 

There is a high cost associated to ionic liquids, although, this high cost can be easily 

manageable due to the fact that ionic liquids can be easily recovered and recycled 

back to the process. Usually, due to their low vapor pressure, distillation presents a 

suitable option for the recovery process. However, when the system is sensitive to 

temperature or other non-volatile compounds are mixed, there are other options in 



15 
 

terms of recovery, such as extraction with solvents, adsorption, separation applying 

membranes, etc. [30]. 

In biodiesel production, ionic liquids are able to reduce the number of reactions and 

purifications steps, decreasing the production cost and energy consumption 

throughout the process. The majority of studies focus on the application of Brønsted 

acidic ionic liquids to biodiesel production, since they usually show high catalytic 

activity, although, a few publications report that basic ionic liquids require less 

reaction time and less temperature in biodiesel synthesis [13,27,29]. 

3.1 Ionic liquids applied to biodiesel production 

The use of ionic liquids in biodiesel production has attracted a great attention from 

the scientific community, since its use allows overcoming several issues related to 

the traditional processes of biodiesel synthesis, such as the possibility of exploiting 

low-cost feedstock, reducing environmental issues and the number of downstream 

steps, among others [27]. There are several studies on the literature focusing on 

employing ionic liquids as catalyst for biodiesel production. Table 5 summarizes a 

few studies found on the literature. 

In 2011, Elsheikh et al. [31] investigated ionic liquids containing an imidazolium ring 

in their cation for the transesterification reaction of crude palm oil with methanol. The 

ILs investigated showed a high catalytic activity and a similar trend was observed for 

all ionic liquids when the amount of catalyst added was varied. The best catalyst was 

1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4], with which a conversion 

of 91.2% was achieved, with the optimal condition being 4.4 wt% of catalyst, crude 

palm oil/methanol ratio of 12:1, temperature of 160ºC for 120 min reaction time.

In 2013, Fauzi and Amin [34] performed a multi-objective optimization for the 

esterification reaction between oleic acid and methanol catalyzed by ionic liquid 1-

butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4], evaluating simultaneously 

the oleic acid conversion and the methyl oleate yield. An Artificial Neural Network – 

Generic Algorithm (ANN–GA) was applied to optimize the main reaction variables: 

temperature, reaction time, molar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and the 

catalyst dosage. They found that the optimal combination was a temperature of 87°C, 

reaction time of 5.2 h, molar ratio alcohol/oil of 9:1 and a catalyst loading of 0.06 

moles, leading to an oleic acid conversion of 80.4% and a methyl oleate yield of 

81.8%. 

Also in 2013, Liu et al. [35] studied the reaction between waste cooking oil and 

methanol, applying ionic liquids that depicted Brønsted acidity. They tested 10 

different catalysts, including sulfuric acid. The best result was obtained with the ionic 

liquid 1-(3-sulfonic acid)propyl-3-methylimidazole hydrogen sulfate 

[HO3SPMIM][HSO4]. The best condition found was a reaction temperature of 120 °C, 

molar ratio between methanol and oil of 12:1, catalyst loading of 2 g and a reaction 

time of 8 h, leading to a 96% conversion. The same conditions were applied to acidic 



17 
 

oils, which were prepared by adding oleic acid in different proportions to the raw 

material, and again, the conversion was over 90%. The recyclability was also 

addressed, and after 6 subsequent runs, no obvious reduction in the catalytic activity 

of the IL was detected. 

In 2014, Li et al. [32] investigated seven ionic liquids to determine their applicability 

and catalytic activity in biodiesel production. They studied the esterification reaction 

between oleic acid and methanol. Their conclusion was that the higher catalytic 

activity was connected to the anion’s acidity, and that the stronger it is, the higher the 

methyl oleate yield will be. In their work, they found that 1?sulfobutyl?3?

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BHSO3MIM][HSO4] was the best catalyst and 

the optimal condition was 120 ºC, 4 hour reaction, methanol/oleic acid ratio 4:1 and a 

concentration of catalyst of 10 wt%. They also studied the recyclability of the ionic 

liquid, and they only noticed a slight decrease on conversion after eighth consecutive 

runs. 

In 2015, Xu et al. [33] compared the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid 1-

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) with the catalysts 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium hydroxide ([BMIM][OH]), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 

concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).   Although results showed that for the 

transesterification reaction between castor oil and methanol, the catalyst NaOH 

presented the best results, the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate 

[HMIM][HSO4] displayed a very similar trend, so due to its advantages compared to 

the traditional catalyst, this ionic liquid was chosen for further studies. They run a 

screening test to study out of the 4 factors (temperature, time, and molar ratio 

methanol/oil and catalyst dosage) which factors were significant in the reaction 

conversion. They found that the reaction time was not an important factor and carried 

out the experiments with the remainder factors to the optimal conditions for the 

reaction, using a response surface methodology. They concluded that the optimal 

conditions were molar ratio methanol/oil of 6:1, reaction time of 4 h, temperature of 

77 ºC and a catalyst dosage of 12 wt%.  



18 
 

Also in 2015, Ullah et al. [36] studied the transesterification reaction between waste 

palm cooking oil with methanol in a two-step process. The first step, an esterification 

reaction, was catalyzed by an ionic liquid, in order to decrease the acidity of the 

waste oil. The second stage was the utilization of KOH to catalyze the 

transesterification reaction. Three ionic liquids were tested and 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4] displayed the best results. The 

best condition for the first stage was a concentration of catalyst of 5 wt%, a molar 

ratio between methanol and waste oil of 15:1, reaction time of 60 min and a 

temperature of 160°C. The final yield observed applying the determined condition for 

the first stage and followed by the transesterification with the KOH catalyst resulted in 

an overall yield of 95.7% [36]. 

In 2015, Sun et al. [37] studied the esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol 

using the catalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4]. The 

optimized reaction conditions were 4:1 molar ratio of methanol/oleic acid, catalyst 

dosage of 3.5 mL and a reaction time of 6h, leading to a conversion of 92.5%. After 9 

reuse cycles, the conversion was still above 85%. 

In 2018, Ding et al. [38] investigated the transesterification reaction of palm oil and 

methanol. Three synthesized ionic liquids were studied in order to determine their 

catalytic activity, followed by a single factor experiment to investigate the effect of 

several parameters on the reaction and then a RSM to optimize those factors. The 

best catalyst was the ionic liquid [HSO3-BMIM][HSO4] and the optimum condition was 

a methanol/oil ratio of 11:1, a ionic liquid dosage of 9.17 wt%, a microwave power of 

168 W and a reaction time of 6.43h, leading to a yield of 98.9%.  

3.2 Kinetic studies of esterification reaction  

The determination of the kinetic parameters of the esterification reaction of FFAs is 

also interesting, as it allows a better understanding of the suitability of a determined 

catalyst for biodiesel production. Normally, the main studied kinetic parameter is the 



19 
 

activation energy (Ea), defined as the minimum energy required for the reaction to 

take place. Only when the reactants collide with this minimum energy is that the 

products are formed [39,40]. Also, the activation energy is a measure of how the 

reaction rate is influenced by the temperature. Reactions that have a small activation 

energy (below 10 kJ/mol) have a little dependency on temperature, while reactions 

with high activation energies (above 60 kJ/mol) have a strong dependency on 

temperature [39]. Therefore, the lower the activation energy, the easier it is to turn 

reactants into products. Using a catalyst is a practical way to decrease the activation 

energy, as catalysts work by providing a different pathway for the reaction to occur 

with lower activation energy. The catalyst has no effect on the reaction equilibrium, 

and therefore the equilibrium is not impacted. Also, the catalyst is always 

regenerated at the end of the process [39]. There are several studies on the literature 

that focuses on the estimation of the activation energy of both the esterification and 

the transesterification reactions for biodiesel production. The main studies are 

summarized on Table 6.

Fauzi, Amin and Mat (2014) investigated the esterification of oleic acid with methanol 

using the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrite [BMIM][FeCl4] as 

a catalyst. The conditions applied were a molar ratio methanol/oleic acid of 22:1, 3 

mmol of catalyst loading and a total reaction time of 3.6 h, with sampling every 36 

min. The temperature was varied from 40 to 70°C. The change in oleic acid 

concentration was evaluated by titration with a KOH solution. They arrived at the 

conclusion that the reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics and estimated the 

activation energy as 17.97 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor as 181.62 min
-1

 [41]. 

Kosti? et al. (2016) studied the esterification reaction of waste plum stone with 

methanol applying sulfuric acid as catalyst. The study was carried out under variation 

of catalyst loading, methanol/oil ratio, and temperature, modeling the reaction as a 

pseudo-first order. They concluded that the activation energy suffers a slight 

decrease when the catalyst dosage increases. The catalyst loading of 0.049 mol/dm
3
 

leads to an activation energy of 13.20 kJ/mol, whereas increasing the catalyst loading 

to 0.172 mol/dm
3
 leads to an activation energy of 11.55 kJ/mol, that represents a 

very small decrease [42]. 

Neumann et al. (2016) examined the esterification reaction of oleic acid with ethanol 

using sulfuric acid as catalyst. They approached the variation of the concentration of 

oil by a second order reaction, arriving at an activation energy of 36.62 kJ/mol and a 

pre-exponential factor of 4.72 x 10

Aranda et al. (2008) studied the esterification reaction of palm fatty acids with 

methanol applying several acidic catalysts. The two catalysts that presented the best 

results were sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid. The reaction promoted by both 

catalysts was modeled as a first order reaction related to the oil. They varied the 

concentration of the catalysts and the temperature, and they found out that the 

activation energy decreases as the catalyst loading increases. For a 0.01wt% 

catalyst loading, the activation energy was found as 15.05 kJ/mol for the reaction 

catalyzed by sulfuric acid and 10.12 kJ/mol for the reaction catalyzed by 



21 
 

methanesulfonic acid. Increasing the catalyst loading to 0.05 wt% led to activation 

energies of 6.53 kJ/mol (sulfuric acid) and 3.785 kJ/mol (methanesulfonic acid) [44]. 

Jansri et al. (2011) investigated the reaction of palm oil with methanol in a two-stage 

process: esterification reaction of the FFAs with sulfuric acid as catalyst followed by a 

transesterification reaction of the triglycerides with sodium hydroxide. The overall 

order of the esterification was assumed as being first order, while for the 

transesterification a second order reaction. The temperature was varied from 55 to 

65°C. They arrived at the activation energy of 75.3 kJ/mol for the esterification 

reaction. For the transesterification reaction, they estimated the activation energies 

for each step of the reaction: conversion of triglycerides (TGL) into diglyceride (DG) 

(1.45 kJ/mol), diglyceride into monoglyceride (MG) (328 kJ/mol) and monoglyceride 

into glycerol (GL) (89.35 kJ/mol) [45]. 

Ullah et al. (2017) studied the transesterification reaction between waste cooking oil 

and methanol with ionic liquid 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfo-butyl)-benzimidazolium 

trifluoromethanesulfonate [BSMBIM][CF3SO3]. They simplified the reaction by 

ignoring the intermediates of the transesterification reaction, modeling the reaction as 

a first order. The temperature range studied was from 80 to 140°C and they 

estimated an activation energy of 19.24 kJ/mol [46].

4. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION AND PROCEDURES  

4.1 Chemicals and raw materials 

All the reagents used for biodiesel production and for quality control analysis were at 

least of analytical grade. Oleic acid, tech 90%, was obtained from ThermoFisher 

(Germany). The reagents obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Switzerland) included the 5 

ionic liquids: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium methyl sulfate, 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium methanesulfonate and tributylmethylammonium methyl sulfate 

and the Supelco 37 FAME mixture. Methanol, n-heptane, absolute ethanol and 

diethyl ether, used as solvents, were obtained from Carlo Erba (France). 

Concentrated sulfuric acid was obtained from Pronalab (Portugal). Methyl 

heptadecanoate was obtained from Tokyo Chemical (Japan). A sample of waste 

cooking oil (WCO) was qualitatively and quantitatively characterized, and used as a 

raw material for the test of the transesterification reactions.  All reagents were used 

without any further treatment. Table 7 presents the proprieties of the reactants.

4.2 Equipment 

The reaction for biodiesel production was performed in an automatic heating plate 

(IKA, model C-MAG HP4), with a condenser to reflux the excess methanol. For 

biodiesel separation, a centrifuge (SIGMA, model 2-4) was utilized. The content of 

FAMEs was evaluated in a gas chromatograph system (VARIAN CP-3800) equipped 

with a FID detector and a chromatographic column Supelcowax 10 

(30mx0.25mmx0.25 µm). The infrared analysis was done in ABB Inc. FT-IR, model 



23 
 

MB3000, in transmittance mode by using a Miracle single reflection horizontal ATR 

accessory from Pike Technologies. 

4.3 Esterification reaction of oleic acid 

In the following order, ionic liquid, oleic acid and methanol were added, in different 

proportions, to a 100 mL reaction vessel. The vessel was immersed in a bath with 

paraffin, in an automatic heating plate under determined temperature and agitation, 

coupled with a reflux condenser, as shown in Figure 5. When the pre- determined 

reaction time was achieved, the vessel was removed from the bath and it was 

immersed in cool water to stop the reaction. The mixture was transferred to 

centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm and then stored at 4°C 

until the organic and the aqueous phases were completely separated and ready to be 

splitted, as displayed in Figure 6. Both phases were stored in vials at 4°C waiting for 

further analysis, as displayed in Figure 7.

4.4 Conversion measurements  

Acid value determination was performed using a methanolic standardized KOH 

solution, according to the EN 14104 standard procedure [49]. Half a milliliter of the 

oleic acid/biodiesel was transferred to an Erlenmeyer using a micropipette and 

weighed using an analytical balance. Then, 25 mL of diethyl ether/ethanol 1:1 (v/v) 

solvent mixture was added to the Erlenmeyer along with 5-6 drops of 

phenolphthalein. The oleic acid/biodiesel was then titrated with a standard KOH 

solution. The acid value is given in terms of mg of KOH/g biodiesel by equation (1) 

???? ?????, ?? (
?? ???

? ?????????
) =  

???? ? ???? ? ?????
??????????

 (1) 

Where ???? is the volume of the KOH solution used in the titration, in mL,  ???? is the 

concentration of the KOH solution, in mol/L,  ????? is the molecular weight of KOH, 

which is 56.1 g/mol,  ?????????? is the oleic acid/biodiesel mass measured, in g. 

The conversion was then measured by comparing the acid value of the oleic acid to 

the acid value of the final product, according to equation (2). 

??????????, ?(%) =
 (??????? ???? ?  ??????????? )

 ??????? ????
× 100 (2) 

Where  ? is the conversion of the oleic acid (%);  ??????? ???? is the acid value for the 

oleic acid and  ???????????  is the acid value for the biodiesel, both in mg of KOH/g of 

sample. 

4.5 Characterization of biodiesel 

4.5.1 FAME content by Gas Chromatography  

Chromatography analysis was performed to measure qualitatively and quantitatively 

the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content in the obtained biodiesel samples. This 



26 
 

experimental determinations was performed respecting the EN 14103 standard [50]. 

The samples for chromatographic analysis were prepared in the following way: 

around 250 mg of biodiesel were measured in an analytical balance using a 

micropipette and a 10 mL flask. Then, 5 mL of methyl heptadecanoate internal 

standard solution, with a known concentration of around 10 mg/mL, were added. The 

sample was dried by adding a small amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate; the 

solution was agitated and left standing until clarification. The volume of sample 

injected in the GC equipment was 1 µL.  

The operation conditions used for GC analysis were a helium flow (carrier gas) of 1 

mL/min and an initial oven temperature of 50
o
C, which was held for 1 min. Then, a 

first ramp was done up to 200
o
C at 25

o
C/min rate and a second ramp up to 230

o
C 

with a 3
o
C/min rate, which was held for 23 min, leading to a total running time of 40 

min. Injection temperature was 250 
o
C, split ratio 1:25 and detector temperature 

250°C.  

The  identification of each FAME compound present in biodiesel samples was 

determined by comparison of the obtained retention times of each standard obtained 

by performing an analysis of a Supelco 37 component  standard FAME mix, using the 

same GC-FID equipment under the same operation conditions.  Figure 8  displays 

the elution order of each FAME in the mixture, as appointed by previously published 

work from Agilent Technologies [51]. This elution order was used to identify each 

FAME in the analysis performed in the equipment used. The column used for 

obtaining the chromatogram displayed on Figure 8 is a DB WAX column, which has a 

similar packing and the same dimensions as the column used in this work (a 

Supelcowax 10), which allows comparison of the results obtained in both. It is 

important to notice the similarity of the elution order for all the components. The 

chromatogram displayed on Figure 9 is the chromatogram obtained for the same 

sample in the ESTiG equipment, using the operation conditions described in the 

beginning of this section. Table 8 displays the retention time for each of the FAMEs, 

as well with the peak number used in the chromatogram, the name and the ID of the 

component. These retention times were used to identify the presence of each FAME 



27 
 

in the biodiesel samples, as exemplified on Figure 10. After the peaks were identified, 

the total area of the peaks identified as FAMEs was calculated.

4.5.2 Qualitative analysis using FT-IR 

FT-IR was done to characterize several samples, including starting materials and 

products. FT-IR analysis helps to understand whether the reactants are being 

converted into the desired products. FTIR spectra were obtained on ABB Inc. FTIR, 

model MB3000, (Quebec, Canada) in transmittance mode by using a Miracle single 

reflection horizontal ATR accessory from Pike Technologies (Madison, WI, USA). 



30 
 

Spectra were recorded between 650 and 4000 cm
-1

 at a resolution of 16 cm
-1

 and 

cumulative 32 scans. Spectra were acquired using the software Horizon MB v.3.4.  

4.6 Experimental design  

To estimate the optimal conditions, 4 factors were studied. The chosen factors were 

reaction time (h), reaction temperature (°C), molar ratio between methanol and oleic 

acid (mol/mol) and the amount of catalyst added to the system (%wt), in relation to 

the mass of oleic acid. A response surface methodology (RSM) was employed, 

known as Box-Behnken Design (BBD) [52]. Table 9 describes the 4 parameters 

chosen, the code applied and the 3 levels used.

The methodology estimates that 27 runs are adequate to understand the influence of 

each factor on the response. The design matrix in coded and in real values is 

displayed on Table 10. Each run was carried out accordingly to the generic 

esterification procedure presented in section 4.3. Two responses were evaluated: the 

conversion of oleic acid, according to the procedure described in section 4.4, and the 

FAME content, according to the procedure described in section 4.5.1. 

The methodology allows fitting a quadratic mathematical model that describes the 

relationship between the parameters and each response. The generic formula for the 

mathematical model is given by equation (4).

linear regression and by maximizing the equation it is possible to obtain the optimal 

conditions for each of the responses separately. 

 

4.7 Kinetic study  

The procedure was similar to the one for the esterification reaction, presented on 

section 4.3. Throughout the reaction, in pre-determined times (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 

180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480 min), 1 mL of sample was removed from the vessel 

using a micropipette and stored in a 2 mL flask at 4 °C, waiting for further analysis. 

The conversion was determined by acid value decrease, as stated on section 4.4. 

The kinetic study was performed for different reaction temperatures (70, 80, 90, 100 

and 110°C) with the goal of establishing the activation energy. 

4.8 Transesterification study 

The procedure was similar to the general esterification reaction. In this specific case, 

the oleic acid was substituted by a mixture of oleic acid and a used vegetable oil. The 

mass proportion in which the oil and the acid were blended varied in each 

experiment. The proportions are appointed in Table 11. The factors were set up to 

the optimum determined for the esterification, except for the quantity of methanol 

added, which was added in a proportion of 20 mol of methanol/mol of triolein (it was 

considered that the mixture was only composed by triolein). This approach regarding 

the amount of methanol was chosen as it would allow a better comparison amid the 

results obtained in each run.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

5.1 Preliminary ionic liquid screening 

The catalytic activities of five ionic liquids in the esterification reaction of oleic acid 

were compared. The goal was to understand the influence of the cation and the 

anion on the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid and then choose the most suitable 

one for biodiesel production. In order to do so, several experiments were carried out 

under the same reaction conditions. The conditions applied were chosen based on 

previous studies done in our research group [53] and were as follows: 6 h reaction 

time, reaction temperature of 90ºC, catalyst loading of 10 wt% and a methanol/oleic 

acid ratio of 10:1. Table 12 presents the obtained results and are displayed on Figure 

11 for better interpretation.

The order of catalytic activity of the ionic liquids was 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt;&gt; 4 &gt; 5, under the 

used conditions. The ionic liquids 1, 3 and 4 comprised the same cation (1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium), and the results differed greatly from ionic liquid 4. This may 

indicate that the acidity of the methanesulfonate anion is very low. On the other hand, 

the results obtained with catalysts 1 and 3 are very close, indicating that the catalytic 

activity of those two catalysts may also be similar. Comparing ionic liquids 2 and 3, 

which display the same hydrogen sulfate anion but containing a different cation, the 



34 
 

results may indicate that the cation plays an important role on the catalytic activity, as 

the change in the cation resulted in a higher conversion. 

 

 

Figure 11 - Catalyst screening. Conditions: 6h, 90°C, 10:1 molar ratio and 10wt% catalyst dosage. 

Finally, by comparing ionic liquids 1 and 5, which have the same anion and a 

different cation, there’s a huge difference in the conversion, indicating that the cation 

based on an imidazole ring has a stronger acidity and therefore catalytic activity.  The 

catalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4]  2 was identified, from 

those analyzed, as the most suitable catalyst for biodiesel production through 

esterification reaction. Therefore, this ionic liquid was chosen for further studies.  

Figure 12 presents the structure of the ionic liquid [HMIM][HSO4].

5.2 Experimental design 

After choosing the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4], 

optimization for the esterification reaction was performed based on a Response 

Surface Methodology (RSM).  This kind of methodology is based on a set of 

mathematical and statistical techniques that intends to fit a non-linear equation to the 

experimental data, in such a way that this equation is able to describe the 

relationship between the studied parameters and the response and make statistical 

previsions [54]. Compared to one-variable-at-time methodologies, where the 

influence of only one factor is monitored at a time while others remain fixed, response 

surface methodologies have the advantage of a small number of runs, meaning that 

RSM is time and cost efficient [54].  

Amongst the available RSM, the design chosen was the Box-Behnken Design (BBD). 

According to Bezerra et al (2008) [54]: 

“Box and Behnken suggested how to select points from the three-level factorial 
arrangement, which allows the efficient estimation of the first- and second-order 
coefficients of the mathematical model. These designs are, in this way, more efficient 
and economical then their corresponding 3k designs, mainly for a large number of 
variables”.  

The requirements of such design is that the factors must be adjusted in three levels  

(-1, 0 and +1), equally spaced. The experimental points are located on a hyper 

sphere, being equally distant from the central point. For a design with four variables 

and three levels, a complete factorial would require 81 runs, while for the same 



36 
 

situation, the Box-Behnken Design requires only 27 [54]. Replicates in the central 

point are necessary to estimate pure errors. 

Four parameters were chosen to be studied. Those factors were chosen based on 

previously done investigations in our group [53] and also based on several papers 

found on the literature. 

The parameters chosen were reaction time (A), reaction temperature (B), molar ratio 

between methanol and oleic acid (C) and the catalyst dosage (D) and the factors and 

their respective levels are summarized on Table 13. Two responses were evaluated: 

the conversion of oleic acid, based on acidity decrease, and the FAME content, 

through gas chromatography analysis.

Table 14 describes the conditions applied in each run, both by the experimental 

design and the real values, and the obtained responses.  As mentioned earlier, the 

Box-Behnken Design for four factors and three levels requires 27 runs.  

The evaluation of the responses was done separately. This means that a different 

model was developed for each of the responses and different optimal conditions 

were estimated. The FAME content was determined by gas chromatography analysis 

according to the procedure appointed on section 4.5.1. The conversion was 

determined by acidity decrease, as mentioned on section 4.4.

5.2.1 Analysis for the conversion of oleic acid  

5.2.1.1 ANOVA table 

The experimental design was evaluated using several statistical tools. The first one 

was the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table, found on Table 15. The main idea of 

the ANOVA is to compare the variation in the response due to treatment, which 



38 
 

means the change in the level of the variables, with the variation due to random 

errors that are inherent to the measurement of the response. With this approach, it is 

possible to determine whether the regression proposed is adequate while taking into 

consideration the experimental inaccuracies associated to the process [54].  

The ANOVA table is constructed by calculating the squares of the deviations of each 

observation from the mean. The sum of squares for all deviations gives origin to the 

total sum of squares (SSTOTAL), which can be dismantled in two parts: the sum of 

squares due to the regression (SSmodel) and the sum of squares due to residuals 

(SSresiduals) generated by the model. Since replicates of the center points are made, it 

is possible to estimate pure errors associated to the measurement of the response 

and therefore to break the sum of squares of the residuals into the sum of squares 

due to pure error (SSpe) and the sum of squares due to the lack of fit (SSlof) [54]. The 

total sum of squares is given by equation (5). Then, each of the sums of squares 

should be divided by its respective degree of freedom, giving rise to the media of the 

square (MS).  

??????? = ??????? + ???? + ?????  (5) 

The significance of the regression is evaluated by the ratio of the MS of the 

regression (MSmodel) by the MS of the residuals (MSresidual), leading to the calculated 

F-value. This value must be compared to the F-value tabulated (F test) by taking into 

account the degrees of freedom from both the regression and the residual. If the 

calculated value is higher than the tabulated one, means that the regression is 

statistically significant and therefore, the model is well fitted to the data, with a 95% 

confidence level. In the current analysis, the calculated F-value for the regression is 

112.74. Considering the degrees of freedom of the regression (df1 = 14) and the 

degrees of freedom of the residual (df2 = 12), and checking the Fisher’s distribution 

table for the critical value of F14,12,0.05 (? equal to 0.05), it is possible to find a 



39 
 

tabulated value of 2.637. The calculated value is higher than the tabulated, indicating 

a reliable model.

 *Df = Degrees of freedom 

Another way to evaluate the model is by checking the lack of fit. As in the regression 

fit, the lack of fit should be evaluated by comparing the F-value calculated to the 

tabulated one. In this case, the degrees of freedom of the lack of fit and the pure 

error must be taken into account. The F distribution appoints that for a F10,2,0.05, the 

value is 19.396, while the calculated F-value is 4.01, meaning that the lack of fit is not 

significant. This is the expected response for the lack of fit. It means that the model 

errors are due to random and inherent errors of the system rather than a problem 

with the data fit. Random errors are not related to model quality, while lack of fit is.   

The p-value is related to the F-value and is defined as the probability that the data 

would be at least as extreme as those observed [55]. In other words, it is related to 

the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Low p-values allow rejecting the 

null hypothesis, which in this case would be that the model is not relevant or that the 

factors don’t influence the response. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the 

alternative hypothesis must be true, which would mean that the model and the factors 

are relevant. Treatments that result in p-values lower than a pre-determined 

significance level, which in this case is 0.05, are considered statistically significant. 

Therefore, the current model is statistically relevant, and the lack of fit is not. 



40 
 

5.2.1.2 Another tools to assess the model fit 

The quality of the fit was also assessed by other statistical tools. The regression 

coefficient was estimated as R
2
=0.9925, indicating that the observed and predicted 

values are close and that the model can be used to predict responses. To assess the 

viability and accuracy of the model, some facts must be checked. First, the residuals 

of the runs should be normally distributed. Second, the mean of the residuals should 

be close to 0 and third, the residuals should be unrelated to the levels of any known 

variables [56]. Residuals are estimates of the errors done by subtracting the 

observed response, or the experimental response, from the predicted response. The 

normality of the residuals can be assessed by verifying the normal plot of residuals, 

displayed on Figure 13. The expectations is that the data is normally distributed when 

all the runs fall within a straight diagonal line, without any residuals occurring too far 

from the line neither any tendency to form a specific pattern, such as a curve in form 

of an “s”. Figure 13 shows a set of data that is normally distributed.

The residuals versus predicted plotted on Figure 14 helps to verify if the residuals are 

close to 0 and if the residuals are unrelated to the level of the variables. Both 

conditions are satisfied, as the residuals fall close to the black line indicating a 0 

mean, and that no specific pattern, such a funnel like appearance, is formed as the 

predict response increases. 

 

Figure 14 - Residuals versus predicted values. 

Also, the residual versus predicted plot helps to identify outliers, which are runs with 

very large residuals that must be discarded from the statistical evaluation. Any value 

outside the red line on Figure 14 should be considered an outlier and the experiment 

or measurements of the responses should be repeated. It is important to note that 

those are only tools to help to identify problems with the model, so it is important to 

check for values that are really far apart from the objective and not that every value 

falls in the black line that indicates a deviation of 0.

5.2.1.3 Factors effect on the conversion 

There are several ways to evaluate the influence of the factors on the response. One 

way is by applying the same logic when the model regression was evaluated, taking 

into consideration the degrees of freedom of each factor and the degree of freedom 

of the residual. The ANOVA table can also be built to analyze the influence of each 

factor, as well as the interactions between them and their quadratic effect on the 

response. As it can be seen on Table 16, the calculated F-value is higher than the 

tabulated one for the following parameters: A (time); C (molar ratio); D (catalyst 

dosage); C
2
; D

2
; CD; A

2
; BC, BD and AC. The remaining terms are not significant, 

including, in this list, the reaction temperature. Besides helping understanding 

whether the factor is statistically significant, the ANOVA helps to interpret how 

significant each one is. This can be assessed by the p-value. The lowest it is, the 

highest the influence on the response. In this way, the order of importance is C 

(molar ratio MeOH/OA) &gt; D (catalyst dosage) &gt; A (time) ? C

Figures 15 through 20 display the response surface for several pairs of variables and 

the interaction plots of those same variables and their influence on the conversion, in 

coded values. Any variable that is not on display on each plot was set to its 

intermediate value (0). 

Figure 15 displays the response surface regarding the influence of variables time and 

temperature and the interaction plot of those two variables. The response surface 

indicates that the temperature variable is negligible for the conversion. By 

establishing a fixed value for the time, for instance -1, and moving along the 

temperature axis, no change in the response is noticed, therefore, its influence is 

irrelevant. On the other hand, by doing the same analysis for the time variable, it is 

possible to verify that the response alters as we move to upper values for the variable 

time.  

 

Figure 15 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and temperature (B) 
and the interaction plot of those variables (Molar ratio = 0; Catalyst dosage = 0). 

The interaction plot on Figure 15 permits to evaluate if the variables influence one 

another. If the interaction plot displays two parallel lines, the conclusion is that the 

effect of one factor does not depends on the level of the other factor. If the lines are 



44 
 

not parallel, it means that the effect displayed by one factor depends on the level of 

the other factor. In other words, it means that one factor not only influences the 

response by itself, but it also influences the other variable, changing the effect of this 

second variable on the response.  As displayed on Figure 15, it is clear that the 

variables do not affect each other. 

Figure 16 displays the response surface for the variables time and molar ratio and 

their interaction plot. Both variables influence positively the response. By combining 

them in their bottom value (-1), the conversion is estimated as 72%, while for their 

upper bound (+1) the conversion is estimated as above 90%. Also, it is clear that the 

molar ratio has a stronger influence on the response. The interaction plot displays 

two slight non-parallel lines, meaning that these variables influence each other. This 

is in agreement with the p-value of 0.0199 found for the interaction of those factors. 

 

Figure 16 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and molar ratio between 
methanol and oleic acid (C) and the interaction plot of those variables (Temperature = 0; Catalyst 
dosage = 0). 

Figure 17 displays the response surface for the variables time and catalyst dosage 

and their respective interaction plot. The behavior of both variables is very similar, 

and significant to the response. This restates the p-values found for the individual 



45 
 

factors of 1.216?10
-8

 for time and 5.68?10

 for the catalyst dosage. The values mean 

that the factors are statistically relevant for the response and they are somewhat 

close, therefore justifying the similar behavior displayed. The interaction plot displays 

two parallel lines, indicating that there is no influence of one factor on the other, in 

agreement with the p-value of 0.4152. 

 
 

Figure 17 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and catalyst dosage (D) 
and the interaction plot of those variables (Temperature = 0; molar ratio = 0). 

Figure 18 shows the surface response for the variables temperature and molar ratio 

between methanol and oleic acid and their interaction plot. The surface clearly 

indicates that the variable temperature is not relevant, while the molar ratio is. The 

interaction plot shows two non-parallel lines, indicating that the variables have 

influence on one another. For this case, the interaction can be easily justified. Even 

though the reaction is carried under methanol reflux, the rise in temperature leads to 

an elevation on the rate of methanol that is evaporating. Therefore, it also influences 

the amount of methanol that is present at every moment during the reaction. This 

influence is mainly felt when the molar ratio is in its lower value (-1), as displayed on 

the interaction plot on Figure 18.

variables.

47 
 

Again, in Figure 19, the temperature does not show any great alteration on the 

response, while the catalyst dosage does. The interaction plot shows two non-parallel 

lines, indicating that there is influence of the parameters on each other.  

Figure 20 displays the response surface for the catalyst dosage and molar ratio 

variables and their interaction plot. Both the variables have a great influence on the 

response, although it is possible to identify that the molar ratio variable is much more 

relevant. The interaction plot indicates that the variables have influence on each 

other, as the lines displayed are not parallel. The interaction of those two variables is 

the most relevant interaction, with a p-value of 0.009.

5.2.1.4 Optimal conditions estimation 

One of the advantages of applying a Response Surface Methodology, such as the 

Box-Behnken Design, is that it allows the construction of a quadratic equation in the 

form of equation (4) presented in section 4.6, and as a consequence, allows us to 

determine the optimum combination of a set of parameters [57] .

Table 17 displays the coefficients determined by regression of the data set. Using the 

information of the coefficients, it is possible to construct the equation that best fits the 

region studied, as displayed by equation (6). The equation is constructed using 

coded values.

By maximizing equation (6), it is possible to determine which values for the set of 

parameters studied would lead to the highest conversion of oleic acid, which is 

displayed on Table 18, both in coded values and in real values. It is important to 

understand that the optimal values found are strongly related to the region studied. If 

the real values for the molar ratio were changed, for instance, possibly the optimum 

combination of the parameters would be different.  



49 
 

Table 18 - Optimal values for the conversion of oleic acid. 

Factor Factor Name Coded Value Real Value 

A Time 1.00 8h 

B Temperature 1.00 110°C 

C Molar Ratio MeOH/OA 1.00 15:1 

D Catalyst Dosage 0.99 15% 

Even though the evaluation of the influence of the parameters indicated that the 

temperature does not significantly influences the response, the values obtained for 

the optimal conditions do not reflect only the individual influence of each factor, but 

also the interaction that they have amongst each other. That is the reason why even 

not being statistically significant, the optimal conditions are obtained with the 

temperature at its highest value (+1).  

After estimating the optimal conditions, new runs were carried out with the purpose of 

confirming the predicted results and consequently, the model. Three experiments 

were run and the results obtained are displayed in Figure 21.  

 

Figure 21 - Predicted results and confirmation runs for the conversion of oleic acid. 



50 
 

The average of the conversion is 95.25, which is within the range predicted by the 

model, with a 95% confidence level (range for conversion: 95.21 -100.73%).  This 

confirms that the model is suitable for predicting the behavior of the system. 

5.2.2 Analysis for the FAME content  

5.2.2.1 ANOVA table 

The ANOVA table was built in the same way as it was built for the conversion. The 

ANOVA for the FAME content evaluation displayed on Table 19 indicates that the 

model is significant, with a calculated F-value higher than the tabulated one. Also, the 

lack of fit is not significant (calculated F-value lower than the tabulated one).

regression. The normal plot of residuals distributed along the straight diagonal line 

displayed on Figure 22 indicates a reliable model, satisfying the condition that 

residuals should be normally distributed. Figure 23 allows verifying that the residuals 

are independent of the level of the known variables and that they fall close to the 0 

line, since the residuals are distributed within the red lines and more or less close to 

the 0 line.

The response surfaces and the interaction plots allow verifying the conclusions 

inferred in the ANOVA table. The most relevant variable is the molar ratio, and it is 

very easy to conclude that by looking at Figure 25, Figure 27 and Figure 29. For any 

of the mentioned plots, increasing the level of the molar ratio has a strong and clear 

effect in the response observed. The leas relevant variable is the temperature, and 

by checking Figure 24, Figure 27 and Figure 28 it is easy to arrive at this conclusion. 

Changing the level of the temperature does not cause any visible alteration on the 

FAME content.

Maximizing equation (7) leads to the values displayed in Table 22. Three 

confirmation runs were performed which are displayed in Figure 30. The average 

obtained for the three runs is 90.55%. This value is within the range estimated by the 

model, indicating it is well fitted and accurate (range for FAME content: 89.62 – 

96.12%).

There are two studies on the literature that apply the same catalyst for biodiesel 

production. The first is the investigation performed by Xu et al. (2015) [33] regarding 

the transesterification reaction of castor oil and methanol. The response evaluated 

was for the FAME content and the optimal conditions were determined as molar ratio 

of 6:1, 4h reaction time, 77°C and a catalyst dosage 12wt%. The temperature was 

the most relevant factor, while the time was the least important and it was not 



58 
 

investigated by the response surface methodology. The FAME content under these 

conditions was 89.82%. They have arrived at a very different conclusion regarding 

the influence of the temperature on the FAME content. This can be related to the 

region chosen for the investigation: they studied the influence of the temperature on 

the range 65 – 85°C. Our study was performed on the range 80 – 110°C. The same 

can be appointed for the molar ratio: Xu et al. investigated the molar ratio varying 

from 5:1 – 7:1, and we have studied from 5:1 – 15:1. This difference in the regions 

chosen leads to a different combination of optimal conditions, and therefore explains 

the contrasting conclusion. 

The second study was an esterification reaction of oleic acid performed by Sun et al. 

(2015) [37]. The response evaluated was the conversion, and under the optimal 

conditions (molar ratio 4:1, reaction time 6h and catalyst dosage 3.5 mL) the 

conversion was 92.5%. The temperature was not mentioned and there is no 

information regarding on the influence of each factor. There is also no information 

regarding the regions studied. The results obtained are moreover similar to ours, 

although the optimal conditions are distinct. 

The two most relevant parameters in both responses were the molar ratio and the 

catalyst dosage. Some authors reached a comparable conclusion. Ding et al.(2018) 

[38] also concluded that those variables were the most influential for the 

transesterification reaction of palm oil using [HSO3-BMIM][HSO4], although the order 

of influence was inverse.  Zhang et al. (2017) [58] also concluded that the molar ratio 

is the most important variable in the esterification reaction of oleic acid using 

[BSMIM]CF3SO3. 

On the other hand, temperature was the least relevant factor. A similar conclusion 

was drawn by Jansri et al. (2011) [45] when studying biodiesel production from a high 

acidic oil using an esterification reaction catalyzed by sulfuric acid as a treatment 

step followed by a transesterification reaction with sodium hydroxide. They studied 

the kinetics of both the esterification and the transesterification reaction, and after 



59 
 

testing three different temperatures (55 - 65°C) they concluded that there was no 

increase in the reaction rate due to temperature and they established that a 60°C 

was sufficient for biodiesel production in the two-stage process.   

5.3 Kinetic study  

The esterification reaction of the oleic acid with methanol is an equilibrium reaction 

that can be described by equation (8). The reaction rate can be described by 

equation (9), where OA stands for oleic acid, a stands for the order related to the 

oleic acid, MeOH stands for methanol, b for the order related to methanol, OAME 

stands for the oleic acid methyl ester (biodiesel), c for the order related to the oleic 

acid methyl ester (biodiesel) and d to the order related to water. k1 is the reaction rate 

constant for the direct reaction while k-1 is the reaction rate constant for the inverse 

reaction.

  (9) 

 

The reaction rate can be simplified by assuming that the methanol is used in excess 

in the reaction, therefore supposing that the term ?????
?

 is approximately constant 

during the reaction. Also, since the methanol is in excess, the reaction is shifted 

towards product formation, and therefore the rate of the direct reaction is much 

greater than the rate of the inverse reaction in the beginning of the reaction (when 

approaching the equilibrium, the rate of inverse reaction tends to the rate of the direct 

reaction). This turns equation (9) into equation (10), where only the concentration of 

oleic acid is relevant to the rate of reaction.

  (10) 

To determine the order of the reaction in relation to the oleic acid a set of 

experiments were carried out under the optimum conditions determined by the 

experimental design: 15 wt% catalyst dosage, 15:1 methanol/oleic acid molar ratio 

and 8-hour reaction time. Those conditions remained fixed throughout all 

experiments. The temperature, in its turn, was varied in each experiment: 110, 100, 

90, 80 and 70°C. A sample of 1 mL was retrieved from the reaction throughout the 

reaction, at pre-determined times (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 

and 480 min). The acid value of each sample was determined following the EN 

14104 [49] and the conversion was estimated by comparing the initial and final acid 

value, according to equations (1) and (2). It was considered that the initial acid value 

is the acid value of the point at 0 min.  

Figure 31 displays the data obtained from each reaction for the acid value and Figure 

32 displays the conversion of oleic acid versus time.

61

From this data, it was possible to determine the apparent order of the reaction in 

relation to the oleic acid. For this purpose, the integral method was applied for the 0

 order, for all temperatures. Equation (10) was integrated with a 

varying from 0 to 3, giving origin to equations (11) to (14).

The data was then plotted for each reaction order, and it was expected that the data 

would be distributed in a straight line. Then, to determine the order of the reaction, 

the coefficient of determination (R
2
) of each experiment was compared. The order 



62 
 

that resulted in a highest coefficient was understood as the apparent order of the 

reaction. The coefficients of determination for each temperature and each trial are 

displayed on Table 24. The highest coefficient was obtained for the 3

 order for all 

temperatures.

The integrated form of the reaction rate for a 3
rd 

order reaction is represented by 

equation (14). It is possible to retrieve a value of k’1 for each temperature, which is 

appointed on Table 25.

The kinetics constant k’1 is related to the temperature by the Arrhenius equation and 

it is given in the form of equation (15). 

??1 = ?0???
???
??  (15) 

Where k’1 is the kinetics constant at a determined temperature, k0 is the pre-

exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, in kJ/mol, R is the gas constant, in 

kJ/mol.K, and T is the temperature, in K. The Arrhenius equation establishes that at a 

given temperature T, the fraction of collisions between molecules with the minimum 



63 
 

required energy Ea is proportional to e
-Ea/RT

 and therefore, the rate constant is also 

proportional to that same factor [39]. The Arrhenius equation can be linearized by 

applying the natural logarithm in both sides of equation (15), leading to equation (16). 

ln ??1 = ln ?0 ?  
??

??
 (16) 

Therefore, by plotting the inverse of the temperature, in K, and the natural logarithm 

of the kinetics constant at each temperature, it is possible to estimate the activation 

energy for the reaction. The Arrhenius plot is displayed on Figure 33. A coefficient of 

determination of R
2
=0.9181 was obtained. The pre-exponential factor (?0) was 

estimated as 0.0765 L

 and the activation energy (??) as 6.8 kJ/mol. The 

low activation energy indicates a certain independency to the temperature. As 

mentioned earlier, reactions with small activation energies have rates that only 

increase slightly with the temperature. This result agrees with the conclusion 

achieved through the RSM for the conversion that the temperature is not statistically 

relevant. 

 
Figure 33 - Arrhenius plot for the experimental data. 



64 
 

Aranda et al. (2008) [44] arrived at similar results for the activation energy. They 

studied the esterification reaction applying sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid and 

arrived at the activation energies of 6.53 kJ/mol and 3.78 kJ/mol, respectively. Even 

though the values are very similar to the ones observed in our study, the ionic liquid 

presents the advantage of being environmentally friendly and also safer in terms of 

handling. Other authors reported activation energies for the esterification using 

sulfuric acid that are higher than the one observed in this paper [42,43,45]. 

Activation energies for the esterification reaction using various ionic liquids as 

catalysts were also reported. Fauzi et al. (2014) [41] reported a value of 17.97 kJ/mol 

for the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrite. Ullah et al. (2017) 

[46] obtained a value of 19.24 kJ/mol for the ionic liquid 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfobutyl)-

benzimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate. Both reported values are higher than the 

one observed in this study, reinforcing the suitability of the ionic liquid 1-

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate as catalyst for the esterification reaction of FFAs. 

5.4 Transesterification study 

A set of experiments was done in order to evaluate the ionic liquid as a suitable 

catalyst for promoting the transesterification reaction of triglycerides as well. As the 

purpose of the current work is to replace conventional catalysts by alternatives that 

could be applied to low quality feedstock, the available oil sample was replaced by a 

mixture of oil and oleic acid, which was varied in different mass proportions. The 

FAME content was evaluated for each sample. The reaction was carried out under 

the optimum conditions determined for the conversion of oleic acid: 8h, 110°C and 

15wt% catalyst dosage. The mole ratio of methanol was increased to 20:1 and it was 

calculated assuming that the total mass for each run was of triolein. 

Table 26 presents the conditions for each run and the FAME content obtained and 

Figure 34 shows the observed relationship between the amount, in relation to the 

total mass, of oleic acid added to the mixture and the obtained FAME content. The 



65 
 

results indicate that probably only the FFAs present in the oleic acid were 

synthesized to esters, which means that the catalyst was only able to promote the 

esterification reaction. Moreover, more investigation should be done in order to 

evaluate if this apparent conclusion really applies. Anyhow, the ionic liquid seems 

suitable to be used as treatment step for acidic oils.

5.5 FT-IR analysis 

FT-IR was used to characterize several samples, including the starting materials and 

the products. FT-IR helps to understand if the reaction is actually accomplishing the 

objective of converting the FFAs into FAMEs. Figure 35 displays the oleic acid 

sample. The broad band from 3300 to 2500 cm
-1

 and centered at 3000 cm
-1 

is a 

characteristic absorption attributed to acidic and strongly bounded hydrogen, such as 

those of carboxylic acids. The bands at 2650 and 2550 cm
-1 

are also in this overtone 

region and are a characteristic pattern for a COOH group. The bands at 2924 and 

2855 cm
-1 

that overlap with the broad band corresponding to the O-H bond are 

associated with the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds, 

respectively. The most strong and sharp that is visible at 1705 cm
-1

 is ascribed to the 

C=O stretching of a dimer in the carboxylic acid, such as the oleic acid. The band at 

1458 cm
-1 

is associated with the asymmetrical CH3 deformation and the band at 1410 

cm
-1 

is related to the CH2 bend. The multiple weak bands at 1288 and 1242 cm
-1 

are 

related to wagging vibrations from CH2 in normal hydrocarbon chains. Both 1288 cm
-1

 

and 1242 cm
-1

 bands are related with the stretch and bend in the COOH group. They 

result from combination of O-C-O asymmetric stretch and OH bend. The band at 933 

cm
-1

 is characteristic of the dimeric oleic acid and results from an angular 

deformation outside the plan of O-H bond. The band at 725 cm
-1

 is ascribed to the 

concerted rocking of all CH2 groups in the chain of four or more carbons [59,60].  

 



67 
 

 
Figure 35 - FT-IR spectrum of oleic acid (CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7COOH). 

The FT-IR spectrum of the biodiesel sample was very similar to the spectrum of the 

oleic acid, as displayed on Figure 36. The biodiesel sample analyzed was obtained 

through esterification under the optimum conditions (8h, 110°C, 15:1 mole ratio, 

15wt% catalyst dosage). The bands at 2924 and 2855 cm
-1 

are also associated with 

the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds, respectively. The 

bands at 1458 and 1373 cm
-1

 are related to the CH3 asymmetric and symmetric 

deformation, respectively, in methyl groups close to the carbonyl group. The band at 

717 cm
-1

 is associated with the rocking motion of four or more CH2 groups in an open 

chain [60].  The differences are related to the disappearance of the broad  band 

centered at 3000 cm
-1 

and the shifting in the absorption of the C=O bond, now at 

1744 cm
-1

, which is a characteristic absorption of the C=O bond in esters. Also, two 

or more bands related to the C-O stretching vibration are present in the spectrum, in 

the region from 1300 – 1000 cm
-1

. The C-O stretch that is attached to the carbonyl 

group appears in the region 1300 to 1150 cm
-1

 while the other band, that is usually 

weaker than the first, appears in the region 1150 – 1000 cm
-1 

[60]. Therefore, the 



68 
 

bands at 1172 cm
-1 

and 1018 cm
-1

 are ascribed to the absorption of the C-O 

stretching. Those differences appointed are a confirmation that the FFAs were 

successfully converted into FAMEs. 

 

Figure 36 - FT-IR spectrum of biodiesel (FAMEs) sample (CH3(CH3)nCOOCH3). 

The same analysis was done to verify the structure of the methanol, the ionic liquid 

and the waste oil. Figure 37 displays the FT-IR for the methanol. The most 

characteristics IR absorption bands for alcohols are in the range of 3650 – 3200 cm
-1

, 

related to the stretching vibration of the -OH and the region from 1260 – 970 cm
-1

, 

associated to the stretching vibration of the CO bond [61]. Therefore, the broad band 

centered at 3325 cm
-1

 is ascribed to the OH stretching and the sharp and strong 

band at 1026 cm
-1

 to the C-O bond. The bands at 2985, 2947, 2893 and 2831 cm
-1

 

are related to aliphatic CH stretching. The band at 1450 cm
-1

 is related to the 

symmetric CH3 umbrella deformation, which is overlapped by the out of plane C-OH 

deformation at 1396 cm
-1

. The out-of-plane C-OH deformation gives rises to a 

second broad band, which is identified as the one at 655 cm
-1

.

Figure 37 - FT-IR spectrum of methanol (CH3OH). 

Figure 38 presents the FT-IR obtained for the ionic liquid, which structure is displayed 

in Figure 12. Heterocyclic compounds with two double bonds in a five-membered ring 

usually show three ring vibrations near 1590, 1490 and 1400 cm
-1 . 

The CH stretch for 

heteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen falls in the region 3180 – 3090 cm
-1

 [59]. 

Therefore, the bonds at 1590, 1550 and 1450 cm
-1 

are related to the ring in the 

imidazolium cation while the band at 3140 cm
-1

 can be ascribed to the stretching 

vibration of the CH bonds in the cation. Also, most of five-membered rings containing 

a CH=CH unsubstituted group have strong hydrogen wag absorption in the region 

900 – 700 cm
-1

 [59], and therefore the bands at 840 and 756 cm
-1 

can be associated 

with this vibration. The band at 2970 cm
-1

 is attributed to the out-of-phase CH3 stretch 

and the band at 2877 cm
-1

 to the in-phase CH3 stretch [59]. The group HSO4
-1

 has 

two absorption bands: one from 1190 – 1160 cm
-1

 related to the asymmetric SO3
-1

 

stretch and at 1080 – 1015 cm
-1

 related to the symmetric SO3
-1

 stretch [59], 

consequently bands 1158 and 1018 cm
-1

 can be ascribed to the anion.

Figure 38 - FT-IR spectrum of ionic liquid. 

Figure 39 displays the FT-IR for the waste cooking oil. The oil is mainly composed by 

triglycerides, which are esters. The characteristics absorptions of ester are a strong 

absorption near 1740 cm 
-1

 associated to the C=O stretching and the strong band 

near 1200 cm
-1

 related to the asymmetric stretching of C-O bond [61]. Thus, the 

strong and sharp bond at 1745 cm
-1

 is ascribed to the C=O bond and the band at 

1157 cm
-1 

is attributed to the C-O bond. The bands at 2924 and 2855 cm
-1

 are again 

ascribed to the stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds. The bands at 1458 and 1373 cm
-1 

are related to the CH3 asymmetric and symmetric deformation, respectively, in methyl 

groups close to the carbonyl group. The band at 972 cm
-1 

is attributed to the wag 

vibration of the CH2. The band at 718 cm
-1

 is ascribed to the concerted rocking 

vibration of four or more CH2 groups in an open chain.

6. CONCLUSIONS  

Ionic liquids as catalysts for biodiesel production seem like a viable alternative to 

common acidic catalysts. From the 5 tested ionic liquids, 3 displayed good catalytic 

activity and resulted in a conversion higher than 77%. The chosen ionic liquid, 1-

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate resulted in the highest conversion in the 

screening step of this work. The experimental design applied allowed to understand 

how each factor (time, temperature, molar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and 

catalyst dosage) influences both the conversion of the oleic acid and the FAME 

content of the obtained biodiesel samples when [HMIM][HSO4] was used as catalyst.  

The most relevant factors were the molar ratio between oleic acid and methanol and 

the catalyst dosage, for both responses (conversion of oleic acid and FAME content). 

It was possible to set the optimum conditions that lead to the highest possible 

conversion and highest possible FAME content. The optimal condition for the 

conversion was estimated as 8h, 110°C, 15:1 molar ratio and 15wt% catalyst 

dosage, leading to a conversion of 95%. The optimum condition, that lead to a 90% 

FAME content, was estimated as 8h, 110°C, 14:1 molar ratio and 13.5wt% catalyst 

dosage. These results indicate that this catalyst has a high potential in biodiesel 

production: not only it achieved high conversions of the reactant, but it also lead to a 

product with a high content of fatty acid methyl esters.  

The preliminary transesterification experiments indicated that the catalyst is not very 

suitable for the transesterification reaction. A very low FAME content was obtained 

for the transesterification experiments and a more comprehensive study is required 

for more adequate conclusions.  

The kinetic study allowed to estimate the activation energy of the esterification 

reaction catalyzed by the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, 

achieving  a very low value of 6.8 kJ/mol. Low activation energy is beneficial, as it 

means that the reaction requires small energy in order to occur, which leads to a 

cheaper process. This low activation energy also helped reinforcing a conclusion 



73 
 

drawn based on the experimental design: that the temperature is not a very important 

parameter for the studied system. The experimental design indicated that the change 

in temperature does not affects significantly the reaction and low activation energy is 

an indication that with the change in temperature, the rate constant does not vary 

greatly, and therefore the reaction rate does not change greatly as well.  

In conclusion, the use of ionic liquids as catalyst in biodiesel production presents 

several advantages. The catalyst chosen for this study led to very good results, 

putting it as a suitable replacement for the traditional catalysts.  The experimental 

design allied to the kinetic study indicated that the catalyst permits a reaction that 

does not require high temperature, meaning a more economic process.

7. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK 

Some studies are still necessary in order to fully evaluate the suitability of the ionic 

liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate for biodiesel production. The 

suggestions for future work are: 

- A multi-objective optimization of both responses (conversion and FAME 

content) to determine the optimum condition that would lead simultaneously to the 

highest conversion and FAME content. 

- A wider study comprehending the use of the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium 

hydrogen sulfate as a possible catalyst for simultaneously promoting the esterification 

reaction of FFAs and the transesterification reaction of triglycerides for low quality 

feedstock.  

- Test of the ionic liquid as a treatment step for low quality oils, by previous 

esterification of FFAs, followed by a transesterification reaction with a classical alkali 

catalyst. 

- A more complete study of the kinetics of the esterification reaction, by varying 

the proportions between methanol and oleic acid and the amount of ionic liquid; 

- A recovery study for the ionic liquid [HMIM][HSO4], in order to assess the 

number of reaction cycles in which high conversions and high FAME content could 

be attained.  

- A more extensive study using the other ionic liquids (1-methylimidazolium 

hydrogen sulfate and 1-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate) that displayed adequate 

results to determine their applicability in biodiesel production. 

- Phase equilibrium study for the mixture methanol-water-biodiesel-oleic acid.
