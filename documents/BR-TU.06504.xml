Abstract

THE FISHING ACTIVITY ON CORAL REEFS AND ADJACENT ECOSYSTEMS. A

CASE STUDY OF THE NORTHEAST OF BRAZIL

Northeastern Brazilian coral reefs spread along about 3000 km of coastline. Many
commercially valuable species inhabit, temporarily or permanently, the reefs and provide food
and employment for millions. However, the lack of basic knowledge, as for example
population structure of exploited stocks, catch level, stock assessment, fishing effect on biota
etc, illustrate the need of an additional research regarding these ecosystems. The fishing
pressure on such environment is rising, partly as result of the technological and demographic
development within these regions. Various studies already showed that the fishing pressure is
increasing and that many fish stocks are about to collapse or overexploited. This work, as part
of the programme, funded by the Brazilian government, called REVIZEE (Assessment of the
potential resources alive within the Economical Exclusive Zone of Brazil) that collected
information on catch composition and biology of the main species within the EEZ, aimed to
identify and assess the factors that influence the fishery dynamic on coral reef using statistical
tools as well as mathematical modelling. The ultimate objective of this study consist in a
contribution for the development of a management plan aiming at the sustainability of coral
reef fishery in the Northeast of Brazil.

Within the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were the main part of the artisanal
catch and contributed most to the similarity between groups, outstanding the Lutjanus
chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and in a lower extend, L. vivanus. Amongst the
factors considered, the spatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in
isolating groups in Northeast Brazil. Considering the technological factors, ‘trip duration’ best
discriminates the catch composition when compared to ‘fleet category’. However, given some
exceptions (mainly related to favourable strong winds), ‘trip duration’ categories are normally
related to the fleet motion as motorised boats generally perform the longer trips.

For the five snappers considered, small fish were generally found near the coast in
shallow waters and the larger fish were found off-shore in deeper waters. In terms of
abundance, mean maximum relative abundance varied, as L. synagris was more abundant in
shallow waters near the coast while L. vivanus mainly occurred in deeper waters on the
continental shelf break and the slope. Gears caught similar size for all species and affected
almost the entire range of their life history, however, fleets with different operation capacities
affected stocks on different ways.

Traditional stock assessment models described the current status of L. analis, L.
chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus of Northeast Brazil. Length based models were
not suitable for the studied species and may not be adequate for many other reef species.
Although it may also be considered limited, due to the short time series, VPA (Virtual
Population Analysis) based on age and true cohorts has shown to be the most appropriate,
within the traditional methods applied for the assessment of the reef fish. In the overall,
caution should be taken on the exploitation levels. The five species were found at fully or
overexploited status and that statement was enhanced when more conservative reference
points such as F0.1 was considered. Models that incorporate technical interaction were also
applied. It appeared that different fleets played distinctive roles on the life history of the
snappers in Northeast Brazil.

Fishery independent information were used to get a picture of the fish biodiversity,
where management attempts are set up, and to assess the relationship between catch-per-unit-
of-effort (CPUE), through comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by underwater visual

censuses (UVC), with the inshore fishery survey. Fish composition varied accordingly to the
habitat type. CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall. However, sampling
performed on ‘knolls’ for lutjanids were found similar. This may be explained by the fact that
fish assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both survey methods present a similar
operating range.

Thus, considering the results obtained through this work, the management plan in the
Northeastern Brazil should encompass two actions: (1) effort reduction, i.e. of the fleet
category that most influences the catch (motorised boats), and (2) implementation of areas
that restrict fishing activities.

Resumo

A PESCA SOBRE OS RECIFES DE CORAL E OS ECOSISTEMAS ADJACENTES: ESTUDO DE CASO

DO NORDESTE DO BRASIL

Recifes de coral da costa do Nordeste do Brasil ocupam aproximadamente 3000 km.
Muitas espécies de alto valor comercial habitam temporariamente ou permanentemente nos
recifes e fornecem sustento e emprego para milhares de pessoas. Porém, a falta de
conhecimento básico como, por exemplo, a estrutura das populações dos estoques
comercialmente explotados, o nível das capturas, a avaliação dos estoques, o efeitos da pesca
sobre a biota, etc, demonstram a necessidade de mais esforço no que diz respeito ao
conhecimento destes ecossistemas. Sabe-se que a pressão pesqueira sobre esse tipo de
ambiente não para de crescer devido, em parte, ao desenvolvimento tecnológico e
demográfico destas regiões. Vários estudos mostraram que a pressão da pesca vem
aumentando e os estoques de peixes estão colapsados ou sobre-explorados. Esse trabalho,
inserido dentro do programa financiado pelo governo Brasileiro chamado REVIZEE
(Avaliação do Potencial dos Recursos Vivos da Zona Econômica Exclusiva) que coletou
informações sobre a composição da captura e biologia das principais espécies da Zona
Econômica Exclusiva, teve como objetivo identificar e avaliar os fatores que determinam a
dinâmica das pescarias nos recifes de coral, utilizando-se de ferramentas estatísticas e de
modelagem numérica. O objetivo final deste estudo consiste em uma contribuição para a
elaboração de um plano de manejo visando a exploração sustentável da pesca no ambiente de
recifes de coral do Nordeste do Brasil.

Dentro da pesca recifal da costa nordeste do Brasil, os lutjanideos foram parte
importante na captura da pesca artesanal e contribuíram decisivamente para explicar a
similaridade entre os grupos, destacando Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu e,
em uma menor proporção, L. vivanus. Dentre outros fatores considerados, o efeito espacial
(estado como fator) foi o mais forte atributo responsável pelo isolamento de grupos.
Considerando os fatores tecnológicos, d?uração da viagem m?elhor discriminou a composição
da captura quando comparado com c?ategoria da frota .? Entretanto, dadas algumas exceções
(principalmente relacionadas com fortes ventos favoráveis), as categorias d?uração da viagem´
são normalmente relacionadas com a propulsão da frota, uma vez que barcos motorizados
geralmente realizam viagens mais longas.

Para os cinco lutjanideos analisados, os menores peixes foram geralmente encontrados
perto da costa em águas rasas e os maiores exemplares foram encontrados mais afastados da
costa em águas mais profundas. Em termos de abundância, a abundância relativa máxima
média variou, uma vez que L. synagris foi mais abundante em águas rasas perto da costa
enquanto que L. vivanus ocorreu principalmente em águas mais profundas na plataforma
continental e talude. As artes de pesca capturam indivíduos com tamanho similar para todas as
espécies e afetam quase toda a faixa do ciclo de vida das mesmas, entretanto, frotas com
distintas operações de pesca afetaram os estoques de maneira diferenciada.

Modelos de avaliação dos estoques tradicionais descreveram a situação atual do L.
analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris e L. vivanus da costa nordeste do Brasil. Modelos
baseados em freqüência de comprimento não se mostraram adequados para as espécies sob
estudo e podem não ser adequados para muitas outras espécies recifais. Embora isto possa ser
considerado limitante, devido a curta série histórica, VPA (Análise de População Virtual)
baseado em idade e coortes verdadeiras mostrou ser o método mais apropriado, considerando

as metodologias tradicionais aplicadas para a avaliação dos estoques dos peixes recifais. De
uma maneira geral, os níveis de exploração devem ser avaliados com cautela. As cinco
espécies foram classificadas como no limite máximo ou sobre-exploradas e essa conclusão foi
ainda mais reforçada quando pontos de referência mais conservativos como o F0.1 foi
considerado. Modelos que incorporam interações técnicas também foram aplicados. Ficou
evidente que diferentes frotas atuam distintivamente na história de vida dos lutjanideos do
nordeste do Brasil.

Informações independentes da pesca foram utilizadas visando a obtenção de uma
imagem da ictiofauna, onde medidas de manejo são implementadas e, para avaliar a relação
entre a captura-por-unidade-de-esforço (CPUE), através de comparações com as estimativas
de abundância obtidas através do censo visual (UVC), com a pesca experimental costeira. A
ictiofauna variou de acordo com a complexidade do ambiente. As estimativas de CPUE
variaram dos índices de UVC de uma maneira geral. Entretanto, para os lutjanideos,
amostragens efetuadas em cabeços foram similar. Isto pode ser explicada pelo fato que a
comunidade de peixes é restrita a área confinada onde ambos métodos experimentais
apresentam uma faixa de operação similar.

Finalmente, considerando os resultados obtidos através deste estudo, um plano de
manejo para a região nordeste do Brasil deve considerar duas ações: (1) redução do esforço,
i.e. na categoria de frota que mais influencia a captura (barcos motorizados) e (2)
implementação de áreas com restrições a atividade pesqueira.

Résumé

LES ACTIVITES DE PECHE SUR LES RECIFS CORALLIENS ET LES ECOSYSTEMES ADJACENTS.

ETUDE DE CAS DU NORD EST DU BRESIL

Les récifs coralliens du Brésil se distribuent sur environ 3000 km de côte. Un grand
nombre d’espèces de poissons commercialement importantes vivent de façon temporaire ou
permanente autour des récifs, et fournissent nourriture et emplois à des millions de personnes.
Pourtant, en écologie tropicale, tant fondamentale qu’appliquée, le manque de données de
base (structure des peuplements et en particulier des populations à valeur commerciale,
valeurs des captures, évaluation des stocks, effets de la pêche sur les écosystèmes, etc.)
illustre le besoin de travaux supplémentaires dans ces milieux. Il est démontré que de nombre
récifs coralliens de part le monde font l’objet d’une pression de pêche croissante. Dans
plusieurs cas bien documentés, la pression de pêche est telle que les captures de poissons se
sont effondrées ou ont, pour le moins, très sensiblement diminué (“surpêche”). Cette étude
trouve sa place au sein du programme d’étude “REVIZEE” (Evaluation du potentiel des
ressources vivantes de la Zone Economique Exclusive Brésilienne) financé par le
gouvernement brésilien , qui a collecté un grand nombre de données sur les espèces pêchées
comme composition des captures et biologie. L’objectif principal étant d’identifier et
d’évaluer, à l’aide d’outils statistiques ainsi que de modèles mathématiques, les facteurs qui
influencent la dynamique des pêches sur les récifs coralliens afin d’aboutir à l’élaboration
d’un plan de gestion des pêcheries de récifs de corail du Nord-Est Brésilien.

Les Lutjanidae constituent le principal des captures de la pêche récifale de cette région.
Elles ont contribué de manière importante à la similarité entre groupes de capture,
principalement Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu et dans une moindre
proportion, L. vivanus. Parmi les facteurs pris en considération , l’effet spatial (les états
géopolitiques étant considérés comme facteurs) parait être l’attribut prépondérant. Si l’on
considère les facteurs techniques, la « durée du voyage » discrimine mieux les captures que la
catégorie de flottille. Pourtant, malgré quelques exceptions (principalement dues aux vents et
courants), la catégorie ‘durée du voyage’ est normalement liée au mode de propulsion des
flottilles, comme par exemple les bateaux motorisés qui, en général, effectuent de plus longs
parcours.

Pour les cinq espèces considérées, les individus de petite taille ont généralement été
capturés prés de la côte dans des eaux peu profondes par opposition avec les poissons de
grande taille qui ont été capturés en eaux plus profondes. En termes d’abondance, L. synagris
a été plus abondant dans les eaux peu profondes alors que L. vivanus a été plus abondant dans
les eaux profondes. Les engins de pêches ont capturé des tailles similaires et ont agit sur
presque la totalité de leur cycle de vie, même si les flottilles, présentant des capacités
opérationnelles différentes, influencent les stocks de manières différentes.

Les modèles halieutiques traditionnels ont décrit l’état actuel des stocks de L. analis, L.
chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris, et L. vivanus de la région Nord-Est du Brésil. Les modèles
basés sur la fréquence de taille n’ont pas été en mesure de fournir une réponse satisfaisante
pour les espèces étudiées et ne donnerait probablement pas une réponse adéquate pour
plusieurs autres espèces récifales. Quoique d’une portée pouvant être considérée comme
limitée par le fait de la courte série temporelle, l’Analyse Virtuelle des Populations, basée sur
l’âge et sur les cohortes réelles, s’est avérée la plus adéquate des méthodes traditionnelles
appliquées à l’évaluation des stocks de poisson récifaux. Globalement, il apparaît que des



Forewords

xxii

précautions devraient être prises afin de limiter le niveaux d’exploitation. Les cinq espèces de
Lutjanidae ont été jugées complètement exploitées voire surpêchées. Ce qui apparait encore
plus évident lorsque l’on prend en compte des points de références plus conservateurs, comme
F0.1. En outre, les modèles incorporant les interactions techniques ont monté que les divers
types de flottilles ont joué un rôle distinct sur les cycles de vie des différentes espèces
étudiées dans le Nord-Est du Brésil.

Des informations provenant de sources indépendantes des pêches ont été utilisées afin
d’évaluer d’une part la biodiversité des assemblages de poissons récifaux, où des tentatives de
gestion sont mis en œuvre, et d’autre part la relation entre les captures par unité d’effort
(CPUE) à travers des comparaisons d’estimations d’abondance obtenues par des comptages
visuels et des relevés de pêche de la région étudiée. L’assemblage de poissons a varié en
fonction du type d’habitat. Les estimations de CPUE ont été, en général, différentes des
comptages visuels. Malgré tout, les échantillonnages effectués sur certains sites comme les
haut fonds de bord de plage par le biais des deux méthodes ont été semblables. Ceci peut
s’expliquer par le fait que l’assemblage de poisson aurait été réduit à une zone confinée où les
deux méthodes d’échantillonnage présentent une amplitude d’opération analogue.

Enfin, un plan de gestion pour la region nord-est du Brésil prenant en compte les
résultas obtenus par cette étude devra considérer deux actions : (1) une reduction de l e?ffort de
pêche, en locurence réduction de l e?ffort de la categorie qui influencie le plus les captures (les
bateaux motorisés) et (2) l’implémentation de zones oú les activités de pêche sont restrictes.

Chapter I. General introduction

I.I. The reef environment Regional setting

The study of Brazilian reefs began in 1828 with an expedition of the naturalist Spix and

Martius (1828). Darwin (1841; 1851) followed by other few visiting scientists that described

restricted reef areas. However, the first complete description of the Brazilian coral reefs and

their fauna was published by the biologist Jacques Laborel (1967) when he described the

unusual characteristics of Brazilian coral reefs: the mushroom-like growth form, the strong

endemism and the low diversity of the coral fauna (see for review Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997;

Castro &amp;amp; Pires, 2001; Leão et al., 2003). In the last two decades, an increased number of

researchers worked on the field of Brazilian reefs. These studies consisted mainly of mapping

the reef area (i.e. Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997), studies of the reef fauna and flora (i.e. Leão, 1986;

Ferreira &amp;amp; Cava, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2001), characterisation of reef environment and related

sedimentary facies (i.e. Araujo, 1984), as well as conservation issues related to reef ecosystem

(IBAMA/FUNATURA, 1991).

Paraíba, (PE) Pernambuco, (AL) Alagoas, (SE) Sergipe, (BA) Bahia

Coral reef formations in Brazil extend for approximately 3000 km along the

Northeastern coast (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997) (Fig. I.1). There are different types of reefs:

bank reefs, fringing reefs and one atoll. They are constituted by organic substrates built with



Chapter 1

2

coral, algae and mollusc skeletons. This region consists in a variety of habitats, including

mangrove forests, fringing and platform reefs, and estuaries that act like inland extensions of

the continental shelf. Where the shelf narrows in the central section of the Northeast Brazil

Shelf region, the substrate consists almost entirely of carbonate sediments and is impacted by

the South Equatorial Current. The Brazilian reef present two outstanding features: their

structure and their coral composition. Reef structure called ‘chapeirões’ are commonly

observed in Brazil. They consist of several mushroom-shaped coral colonies fused above,

some extending 20m high and 50m in diameter. These formation may fuse and form reef

banks which are found in the southern bound of reef range. Calcareous algae predominate

along the northern part of the Brazilian coast (Laborel &amp;amp; Kempf, 1967; Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira,

1997; Leão et al., 2003). Also unique to Brazilian reefs is their reef-building coral species

composition. The diversity coral fauna (18 species) is low when compared to that of the

Caribbean reefs, however, nearly half of it are endemic and some are relics of the ancient

coral fauna of the Tethys sea (Leão et al., 2003). Eighteen species of stony corals

(scleractinians), four hydrocorals, four antipatharians, and eleven octocorals constitute the

cnidarian fauna of Brazil so far identified. The most common forms of stony coral in the

Brazilian reefs are the three species of the genus Mussimilia: M. braziliensis, M. harttii and

M. hispida. Among the endemic species, Favia gravida, is the most common on the

Northeastern reefs. Most of the frame building corals are massive. Encrusting forms are

present along the edges of the reefs. Hydrocorals formed by the genus Millepora, present two

major growth forms: branching and encrusting. Black corals form flat fan-shaped colonies

(Antipathes sp.) or long branched colonies up to several meters long (Cirripathes sp.).

According to Leão (2003) Brazilian reefs are divided into four major sectors along the

tropical coast: the northern, the northeastern, the eastern and the southern coasts. The area

studied included southern part of the northern sector, the Northeastern and north part of the

Eastern zone. It ranged from the State of Ceará to the north part of the state of Bahia including

oceanic banks formed by the submarine mounts of Fernando de Noronha lined up east-west

(Fig I.1). The only emerged peaks of the chain are the Atol das Rocas, the archipelago

Fernando de Noronha, and further north the Rochedos de São Pedro e São Paulo (Fig I.1).

Then, the area is divided in two parts: the northern realm (States of Ceará, Rio Grande do

Norte, and oceanic banks) and the northeastern part (states of Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas,

Sergipe and the northern part of Bahia). The continental shelf varies from 45 to 60 km wide in

Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte, then becomes relatively narrow in Pernambuco coasts (20

km), to wide again in the south of Bahia reaching 200 km. The shelf break is commonly



Chapter 1

found between 80 and 100 m depth (Laborel, 1967; Mabesoone &amp;amp; Coutinho, 1970; Maida &amp;amp;

Ferreira, 1997; Leão et al., 2003). The general atmospheric circulation pattern along the

Northeast and East Brazilian coast is controlled by air masses from the South Atlantic high

pressure cell and advances of polar air masses. Dominant winds are southeasterly and easterly

trade winds. The Brazilian Current (BC) and the North Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) are

the main surface currents on the Brazilian continental margin. They originate from the South

Equatorial Current (SEC) at about 5° to 6° S and flow to the south (BC) with average velocity

50 to 70 cm-1, and to the North and Northwest (NBC) with a velocity reaching 30 cm-1

(Stramma, 1991; da Silveira et al., 1994). During the austral winter between the 10°S and

13°S (Sergipe and Northern Bahia) a reverse flow to the North may occur. North of 5°S the

North Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) becomes stronger as a result of conjunction with the

SEC. The range of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) along the northeastern Brazilian coast has

a low variation from 30°C during summer and fall (October to August) to 28°C during winter

(March to September).

The Northern region is a marginal realm where reefs are sparse. The coast is sandy and

present reefs that grow as pinnacles in depth of 25 to 30 m. Oceanic Banks off this coast are

the remnants of volcanic cone of the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Mabesoone &amp;amp; Coutinho, 1970) that

rises steeply from great depths. These submarine mountain tops range between 40 and 300 m

deep. The region is under the influence of the northern strong onshore winds, trade winds, and

of the northern branch of the South Atlantic Equatorial Current. The water average

temperature is 27°C in summer and 22°C in winter (Leão et al., 2003).

Reefs abound on the inner shelf of the Northeastern region. The coral build-ups are

generally patch of elongated bank reefs, but some attached banks are present as well (Leão et

al., 2003). The major current influencing the area is the Brazilian current which flows

southward and in a lesser extend the North Brazilian Current flowing northward, also there

are wind driven with varying speed and direction. The northeastern coast is dominated by the

Southeastern and Eastern trade winds originated by two elements: the general atmospheric

circulation pattern along the Northeast and East coast and air masses generated in the South

Atlantic high pressure cell and polar air masses.

Although geological history of sandstone banks is poorly known, their formation is

linked to the complex relative movements of the continental margin and the variations of the

sea levels in the past (Mabesoone &amp;amp; Coutinho, 1970). As a general pattern, the northeastern

continental shelf vertical profile can be divided into three zones: (i) the inner shelf, (ii) the



Chapter 1

4

outer shelf and (iii) the shelf break and the slope, another category may be add with oceanic

banks, atoll and archipelago:

(i) The principal coastal feature consists of sandstone banks and superficial coral reef

that are arranged in lines parallel to the coastline that can reach 10 km long by 60m width

(Laborel &amp;amp; Kempf, 1967). Breaks along these lines occur at bays which usually contain small

mangrove systems whenever river is present (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997). From 10 to 20 m deep,

a transitional zone, a mosaic of mud flats (due to river discharge) and areas made of sand and

calcareous algae can be observed.

(ii) The outer shelf, from 20 to 80 m deep, presents a bottom rather smooth where

calcareous algae, Mesobeliaceas spp and Lithothamnium spp, cover large part of the area

(Kempf et al., 1970). Some uneven areas with downs and high, called ‘canais’ occur on the

external bound and run parallel to the shelf break (Kempf et al., 1970).

(iii) The shelf break looks like a wall where the depth fall abruptly from 80 m to 500 m

within 2 nautical miles, then the slope become more gradual with an inclination of 2° to 3°

(Kempf et al., 1970).

The East Brazil large marine ecosystem (LME) has a low productivity (&lt;150 gC/m2/yr)

(Stuhr, 1996). It has a more diverse food web than the large marine ecosystems to the North

and to the South, but has lower production. Studies on primary productivity for this LME are

scant. The Victoria Eddy along the eastern shelf edge (see Schmid et al., 1995) creates an

upwelling of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (see Gaeta et al., 1999), leading to

higher primary production rates. This LME is a transition zone in terms of the distribution

patterns of the different taxonomic groups and the microplankton. It is influenced both by

northern tropical warm waters and by southern colder upwellings (see Ekau, 1999).

I.II. Biogeography of Brazilian reef fishes

Although the reef ichthyofauna of the western Atlantic has been substantially studied,

the reef fish of the Brazilian waters are still poorly known (Floeter et al., 2001). Until the

1980’s the Brazilian reef ichthyofauna was believed to be composed by Caribbean species

(Moura et al., 1999). Nowadays, various species were found endemic of the Western South

Atlantic although very similar to their Caribbean counterparts (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2000).

The Brazilian reef fish fauna comprises around 320 species (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2001). From

these, 57 species were restricted to the southwestern Atlantic (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2001).

Recently, two concurrent theories about the Brazilian endemism have been presented.

The first idea is that a separate evolution of the northern and southern reef fishes population



Chapter 1

5

occurred as the Amazonian river represents a strong barrier through the discharge of a large

amount of sediment and freshwater and that is probably the major reason of the Brazilian

endemism (Rocha, 2003). An alternative proposition was that the Amazon area, because of its

large influence and mainly due to the low salinity, has created an endemism area extending

from the north of Brazil to the Ceará (Joyeux et al., 2001). Therefore, the Amazonian river

would not be an unbridgeable barrier for species (as various species from Caribbean islands

do occur along the Brazilian coast).

There is a considerable homogeneity in the composition of the reef fauna within the

Brazilian province (ranging from the Amazon delta to south Brazil), although there may be

some differences between regions that present divergent salinity water temperature or reef

type (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2000). In the northeast of Brazil, main differences in diversity

occur between continental environment and island (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2000; Floeter et al.,

2001; Araújo &amp;amp; Feitosa, in press). Haemulids and lutjanids, well represented on the Brazilian

reef formation (high number of species), are very little or absent on oceanic islands such as

i.e. Fernando de Noronha (Floeter et al., 2001).

I.III. Data collection

Most of the data for this study were collected as part of a national program called

REVIZEE (Evaluation of the Potential of the Live Resources from Brazilian Exclusive

Economic Zone), which was established in 1996. The program was set up in a

multidisciplinary way and information on geology, physic oceanography, chemistry, and

biology of species inhabiting the Brazilian waters was gathered. The fish and fishery sub-

program gathered information along the Brazilian coast on exploited fish population in order

to determine population dynamics and estimate biomass levels of economically important fish

resources. Our data came from the area encompassing five Brazilian states (Ceará, Rio

Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia, see Fig. I.1) during 5 years of sampling

program. It was gathered information regarding the fishing tactics (fishing area, gear used,

target groups, etc) and catch composition of fleet operating in the region. Fish were identified,

measured and weighed. Biological material was collected for the development of age and

growth studies as well as reproduction. This work already generated several M.Sc. thesis

(Teixeira, 1998; Rezende, 1999; Diedhiou, 2000) and other scientific work (Diedhiou et al.,

2003; Rezende et al., 2003; Ferreira et al., 2004a; 2004b; 2004c; 2004d; Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira,



Chapter 1

2004). Another program ‘Projeto Recifes Costeiros’1 complemented the dataset available on

the artisanal fishery in Pernambuco as well as on the local Tamandaré s? fish fauna through

underwater visual censuses. Results from the data collection from the ‘Projeto Recifes

costeiros’ gave support to the design of the REVIZEE program concerning reef fisheries in

the Northeast of Brazil.

Fisheries statistics in Brazil have been collected by many public institutions (SUDEPE,

1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989; IBAMA, 1990-2001)2. From the 1990’s, the program called

ESTATPESCA run by the IBAMA was set up in order to collect fishery statistics from marine

and estuarine ecosystem along the Brazilian coast. The information collected comprised each

landing by vessel category, its production at species level, the gear category used, the cruise

number and the fishing ground (Estatpesca, 2000). In the Northern Brazil (study area), 324

sampling sites were chosen for estimation of the total production (by the program

‘Estatpesca’) of the target species and control of technological characteristics of the

Northeastern area.

I.IV. Species of genus Lutjanus

Generally demersal, the snappers are tropical and sub tropical species that are

distributed on reefs down to depths about 450 m (Allen, 1985; Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987).

Top predators, they consume a broad range of prey generally dominated by fish and macro

invertebrate at the adult stage (Allen, 1985; Nagelkerken et al., 2000).

Lutjanids are daily and nocturnally active, but in contrast to diurnally active only

species they do not seem to feed during daytime (Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987; Nagelkerken et

al., 2000). Juveniles migrate out of the mangrove and patch reefs to the adjacent seagrass beds

to feed on invertebrates. Commonly, adults that shelter on the coral reef by day migrate to the

adjacent seagrass beds at night to feed. The selection of the feeding site appears to be

determined by the presence and abundance of their preferred food items (i. e. Tanaidacea,

Decapoda, and small fishes) (Allen, 1985; Duarte &amp;amp; Garcia, 1999; Nagelkerken et al., 2000).

Lutjanids present two types of reproduction pattern: continental species spawn during

the extended summer period whereas island population present an all-year round spawning

season (Grimes, 1987). They produce eggs with pelagic dispersion (Grimes, 1987).

Commonly long lived species, i.e. over 50 years for L. campechanus (Wilson &amp;amp; Nieland,

2001), they generally show low growth and natural mortality rates (Manickchanddass, 1987;

Manooch, 1987; Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987; Davis &amp;amp; West, 1992; Milton et al., 1995; Rocha-

Olivares, 1998; Hodd &amp;amp; Johnson, 1999; Cappo et al., 2000; Hood &amp;amp; Johnson, 2000;

Luckhurst et al., 2000; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Newman, 2001; Patterson III et

al., 2001; Wilson &amp;amp; Nieland, 2001; Burton, 2002)

Our study focused on five species of Lutjanus, which inhabit from coastal to deep

demersal waters. The main species caught by the artisanal fishery in Northeast of Brazil were

studied: the mutton snapper L. analis (Cuvier, 1828), the yellowtail snapper L. chrysurus

(Bloch, 1791), the dog snapper L. jocu (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), the lane snapper L.

synagris (Linnaeus, 1758) and the silk snapper L. vivanus (Cuvier, 1828) (Fig. I.2).

Lutjanus analis occurs in continental shelf areas as well as clear waters around islands

(Cervigón et al., 1992). Large adults are usually found among rocks and coral while juveniles

occur over sandy, vegetated (usually Thalassia) bottoms and mangrove systems (Cervigón et

al., 1992). They form small aggregations, which disband during the night (Allen, 1985) and

feed both day and night on fishes, shrimps, crabs, cephalopods, and gastropods (Allen, 1985).

It has been reported individuals reaching 30 years old (Rezende et al., 2003).

L. chrysurus inhabits coastal waters, mostly around coral reefs. They are usually seen

well above the bottom, frequently in aggregations. Young individuals are usually found over

weed beds. Adults feed on a combination of plankton and

benthic animals including fishes, crustaceans, worms, gastropods and cephalopods.

Juveniles feed primarily on plankton (Lieske &amp;amp; Myers, 1994). Spawning occurs throughout

the year, with peaks at different times in different areas (Smith, 1997; Diedhiou, 2000). In the

northern Brazil, 18-year-old fishes were reported (Diedhiou et al., 2003).

Adults of L. jocu are common around rocky or coral reefs. Young individuals are found

in estuaries and occasionally enters rivers. They feed mainly on fishes and benthic

invertebrates, including shrimps, crabs, gastropods and cephalopods (Allen, 1985).

Individuals that aged 25 year old were reported in the northeastern Brazil (Ferreira et al.,

2004c; Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira, 2004).

L. synagris inhabits shallow coastal waters and is found over all types of bottom, but

mainly around coral reefs and on vegetated sandy areas, in turbid as well as clear water

(Lieske &amp;amp; Myers, 1994). L. synagris often forms aggregations, specially during the breeding

season. They feed at night on small fishes, bottom-living crabs, shrimps, worms, gastropods

and cephalopods. Nineteen-year-old individuals were reported in the western Atlantic

(Luckhurst et al., 2000) and up to 22-year-old individuals in Brazil (Ferreira et al., 2004d).

L. vivanus is common near the edge of the continental and island shelves; also found in

deeper waters (below 200 m); usually ascending to shallow water at night. It feeds mainly on

fishes, shrimps, crabs, gastropods, cephalopods, tunicates and some pelagic items including

urochordates (Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987). L. vivanus is a restricted spawner in the continental

part while its insular counterpart spawn all year round (Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987).

I.V. Reef fishery in Brazil. The case of snappers

The Northeast coast is one of the country’s most densely populated coastal regions, with

the State of Pernambuco standing out as the epicentre of this concentration (Moraes, 1999).

To supply food and economic resources the Brazilian reef fishes are intensively exploited by

artisanal fisheries that concentrate on the reef formations distributed along the continental

shelf up to the continental slope and over oceanic banks (Ferreira et al., 1998; Ferreira &amp;amp;

Maida, 2001).

According to Ferreira et al. (2000), fisheries in Brazilian reefs may be divided into two

types. First, the activity of recreational and artisanal scale fishers occurs nearby the coast in

shallow waters and reefs formations. Fishing point may be reached by swimming or using

rowing or sailing canoes. Second, the medium scale commercial fisheries that operates by the

coastal part of the shelf, using sailing or motorised boats that reach deeper waters as far as the

shelf break. Only motorised boats, that may operate also on the banks far from the coast,

have storing capacity (Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 2001).

Along the Northeastern coast, snappers represent one of the main resources for the

artisanal fishery in terms of abundance and fishers income (Santos, 2001). Lutjanids’ catches

in the Northeast Brazil ranged between 11341 tonnes during the 60’s, that represented 34% of

the catch in this decade, and 77422 tonnes during the 80’s, 43% of the catch (Fig. I.3).

During the 60 s? and 70 s?, the most targeted species in Northeast Brazil was the red snapper,

Lutjanus purpureus (Poey 1866), and in minor proportions, L. analis. From 1978 with the

collapse of the red snapper fishery, others species as L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and more recently,

L. synagris, constitute the major part of the lutjanids catch in Northeast Brazil (65%) (Fig. I.3)

(SUDEPE, 1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989; IBAMA, 190-2001). Amongst the four main states

of the Northeast of Brazil, Ceará was responsible for the highest catches of species of the

genus Lutjanus with catches up to 8200 tonnes per year. However, from 1986, the Lutjanids’

catches have shown a decreasing trend since catches in the state of Ceará declined sharply.



Chapter 1

9

The decreasing trend in landings of the Lutjanus species in Pernambuco was also observed

since 1968. This trend was directly related to the collapse of the main species L. purpureus

that reached its maximum in 1981 when 6800 tonnes were landed. By this time, L. purpureus

was responsible for 70% of the total of snappers landed in northeastern Brazil and almost all

catches were from Ceará fishing activities (6700 tonnes). L. purpureus s? catches in

Pernambuco showed a decline since 1968 and, by 1988, this species was nearly absent. In the

last two years (2000 and 2001), L. purpureus only represented 18% of the total catches of

Lutjanus species (1100 tonnes in average). Conversely, the relative contribution of other

species of Lutjanus in the total catch was increasing, specially in Bahia, that steadily

increased its Lutjanids catches since 1968.

Although L. purpureus is of a great value for the Northern Brazil fishery it is, currently,

exclusively targeted by the industrial sector, because of their aggregating property and also

due to over-fishing. Nowadays, L. purpureus is not only caught within the northeastern shelf

although it can be landed in ports of the region (mainly in Fortaleza – Ceará). Therefore this

species was not included into our analyses.

I.VI. General objectives of the thesis

Tropical snappers are widely distributed throughout the tropical seas of the world

(Allen, 1985). In Brazil, snappers are of particular commercial interest mainly for the artisanal

fishery. The exploitation, in terms of catch levels, is carried out with relatively high

exploitation rates from many decades. However, no stock assessment for the elaboration of a

management plan for a sustainable exploitation has been carried out in Brazil for such

resource. The program REVIZEE represented the first attempt to run a comprehensive stock

assessment including the multifleet and multispecies characteristics of the fishery.

This study aims to assess the current status of the artisanal fishery of the Northeast

Brazil through the exploitation of its main resource, the Lutjanidae family, and to help

improving future sampling programs for stock assessment and management in the

northeastern Brazilian framework.

I.VII. Specific objectives and description of the chapters

This study, set up within a multigear and multispecific framework, has the main

objective to evaluate the factors which drive the dynamics of the reef fishery in Northeast

Brazil, using statistical analysis and modelling tools. The final goal of this study is to provide

suggestions for a management plan for the reef fishery in the Northeast Brazil.

The specific objectives of the study are:

1. Identify, describe and quantify the factors that influence the reef fishery in Northeast

Brazil using uni- and multivariate approaches; (Chapter 2)

2. Evaluate the relationship between the species distribution of snappers in the water

column and the fishery distribution. The Lutjanidae family will be chosen as its gather

the main species related to the reef environment in the Northeast Brazil. (Chapter 3)

3. Evaluate the stocks of Lutjanus spp. based on traditional approaches used in fishery

science (Chapter 4);

4. Once the factors that influence the fishery, the multispecific nature of the reef fishery

and the competition among fishers with different gear/fleets are identified, models

including technological interactions will be applied in order to estimate the

exploitation rates, biomass and productivity of fish stocks most important in the reef

community (Chapter 5);



Chapter 1

12

5. Validate the estimates of biomass derived from the indirect models (Chapters 4 and 5)

with direct estimates of population abundance/biomass based on Visual Census

Techniques (Chapter 6);

6. Suggest management measures for the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil (general

discussion – Chapter 7).

Chapter II. Dynamics of reef fishery in the Northeast Brazil: a

univariate and multivariate approach

II.I. Introduction

One of the main purposes of a fishery management plan is the adaptation of the catch to

the potential of the exploitable resources (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). In multispecific fishery,

a common situation on coral reefs, regulations based on unispecific assessment have already

shown their limitations (Polunin &amp;amp; Roberts, 1996). Fisheries science has recognised that fish

species do not exist in isolation from one to another and that they are not harvested

independently (Dann, 1987; Magnusson, 1995; Jennings et al., 2001). Technical interactions

arise when gear (or rather the fleet in a artisanal multigear fishery) comes into contact with

stocks of different species resulting in a mixed catch. Technical interaction may also arise

when co-existing fleets exploit the same resource (Lucena et al., 2002).

The reef ecosystem present a great number of species packed on small spatial dimension

(Longhurst &amp;amp; Pauly, 1987). The fishery dynamics of reef communities and fishing impacts

are better described when considered their multidimensional aspects (multispecific, multigear,

multifleet, spatial and temporal variations). In the case of exploited fishes, the identification

and the quantification of factors influencing the dynamics of the fishing activities and the

structure of this community appear to be necessary in a management framework. This strategy

would help to foreseen the effects and hence to qualify and quantify the variables that

influence the fishery dynamics.

The study of the fleet dynamics and their fishing strategy, through the analysis of the

diversity of their catch composition, is an important part in fishery ecology (Hilborn, 1985).

Such research’s line is particularly useful in the case of multispecific and multigear fishery

(Murawski et al., 1983; Biseau &amp;amp; Gondeaux, 1988). In fisheries that do not provide sufficient

and/or accurate, reliable commercial fishery data, analysis based on catch composition

provides an objective and quantitative alternative means of classification (He et al., 1997). In

this study the data quality was not homogeneous within the entire dataset. Many landings

presented missing data either on the biological aspect or on the abiotic aspect. Therefore such

robust methods were recommendable. Several studies have already looked at the

characterisation of the fleet dynamics using multivariate methods (Pauly, 1980b; He et al.,

1997; Pitcher et al., 1998; Preikshot &amp;amp; Pauly, 1998; Pelletier &amp;amp; Ferraris, 2000). These



Chapter 2

14

techniques are useful to obtain an integrated picture of the structure of the system, the factors

that characterise the fishing activity and also the comprehension of the adaptive fisher’s

techniques to the biological and ecological characteristics of the target species. Furthermore, a

multivariate approach would improve the definition of a new typology of fishing activity in

order to best define technological categories for fishing statistics.

Many community data sets show some a priori defined structure. In the Northeast

Brazilian fishery, a vessel may carry more than one gear and a vessel with similar

technological characteristics may reach different grounds. The qualification and quantification

of the factors that influence the catch are essential for the development of a management plan.

This chapter aims to identify, describe and quantify the factors that influence the reef

fishery in Northeast Brazil using, in a first step, an univariate approach completed by a

multivariate approach. In this context, the homogeneity of the Brazilian reef fishery, in terms

of spatial distribution (variation between states and/or distance to the coast) and technological

interactions was examined looking at the catch composition by state, by gear (when only one

gear was used), by vessel and by the ‘trip duration’ categories. It should be noted that the

concept of state was not only geopolitical unit but also a geomorphological and socio-cultural

unit.

II.II. Material and methods

II.II.1. Data

Data have been collected for five years (from 1996 to 2000) within the REVIZEE

framework (Chapter I), a local program that aimed to gather information on the Brazilian

marine ecosystem within the Exclusive Economic zone (EEZ), in 10 landing sites of the

artisanal reef fishery along 5 states of the Northeastern coast of Brazil: Ceará (CE), Rio

Grande do Norte (RN), Pernambuco (PE), Alagoas, (AL), Bahia (BA) (Fig. I.1). The study

was based on interviews obtained during landings where information on the fishery (date,

name of the vessel, landing site, fishing grounds, depth, time at sea and moon phase), vessel

category (vessel type, gear, motion power and number of fishers) and landings (catches

identified at species level, size of individuals and sometimes weight) were recorded. From

vessels that exploited reef fishes (hereafter, ‘reef fishes’ means a species that may occur on

reefs but is not necessarily restricted to reef), one hundred eighty seven species were reported.

Species considered as ‘rare’ were excluded from the study. The selective criterion included



Chapter 2

15

the species that represent more than 1% of the total catch (in number of individuals) or

species present in the catch of more than 5% of the vessel sampled. In addition, care was

taken to not exclude species that would be important in some state and inexistent in others.

Abundance by state was analysed but no further species were reintegrated in the analysis. The

dataset became 1667 landings and 60400 individuals in 37 species (Table II.1)

‘Main species’ means that the list is based on the reduced dataset.

II.II.2. Methods

Clarke and Warwick (1994) defined a framework for the study of changes in

community structure. Fish assemblage analysis may pass by 3 stages: representation of the

assemblage, discrimination of site or conditions and links between abiotic factors and species

assemblage. In a fishery point of view, the analysis of the catch aims at determining species

that drive the fishing dynamic, discriminating fishing techniques or fishing conditions and

identifying what factor may influence the catch composition.

Within this framework, statistical tools used in ecological studies are grouped into two

categories: the univariate and the multivariate methods.

The univariate techniques condense the full set of species counts for a sample into a

single coefficient, for example an index of the diversity or an indicator species coefficient.

For diversity indexes, traditional statistical methods, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA)

or regression techniques, may be applied.

Most of multivariate techniques work on the principle of similarity coefficients

calculated between every pair of sample. These, then, may facilitate either a classification of

samples or descriptors into groups (clustering) or an ordination plot in which samples or

descriptors are mapped according to their similarity (distances between pair of items reflect

their relative dissimilarity). One may choose amongst various (dis)similarity coefficients, also

called ‘metrics of community structure’, present in the literature (Rice, 2000). Then,

representing communities may be done by dendrograms, and multidimensional scaling (MDS)

plots. The clustering techniques link samples in groups on the basis of (dis)similarity

definition. The MDS method distribute spatially (usually in two or three dimensions) samples

in such way that the rank order of distances agrees with the rank order of the similarities

(Clarke, 1993; Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998). The discrimination of groups of sites or

conditions may be tested by analysis of similarities techniques (ANOSIM) and species

contributing for such similarity within each group and/or dissimilarity between groups may be

identified. Ultimately, having treated biological information independently, any associated

abiotic factors matched to the same set of samples can be examined for their own structure

and its relation to the biotic pattern.

II.II.2.1. Factor and data matrices

In the Northeast Brazil, 4 factors were thought to be relevant as descriptor of fishing

tactics: ‘state’, ‘vessel category’, ‘gear’, and ‘trip duration’. The ‘trip duration’ category is



Chapter 2

17

usually related to the vessel characteristics (propulsion, storing and catch preservation

capacity) and hence the fishing grounds that could be reached. Motorised vessels typically

effectuate longer trips and are able to reach fishing grounds further away from the coast.

However, this cannot be generalised, as sailing boats may reach deeper water when driven by

favourable winds. Thus, in order to identify what is the best descriptor between vessel

category and trip duration, two ordination analysis that consider two sets of factor were tested:

(1) state, vessel and gear, (2) state, trip duration, and gear.

Considering the ‘trip duration’ as category, each sampled vessel were discriminated by

state and by 4 categories (Table II.2). Each state is identified by a two letters code: Ceará

(CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Pernambuco (PE), Alagoas (AL) and Bahia (BA). For

example, sample grouped as CEA is designated for landings recorded in Ceará that presented

a trip duration less than two days. CEB is the code related to landings recorded in Ceará that

presented a trip duration between two and five days, etc. Fleet categories were designated as

‘paquete’ (PQT), ‘jangada’ (JAN), ‘sailing boats’ (BOV), ‘motorised boats’ (BOM) and

‘mixed propulsion boats’ (BOT) (Table II.3). Finally, the three main gears categories

considered were line, gill net and trap

II.II.2.2. Characterisation of fishing types

Both cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used. Both techniques were

found ‘complementary’ to each other when viewed in combination, specially when the stress

value of an MDS plot reaches high values (considered high at 0.2). The stress value represents

the ‘adequacy’ of a MDS representation. Clarke (1993) found that stress values lower than 0.2

were acceptable. Due to the high number of sampled vessels, samples were averaged over

groups constituted by state x (trip duration or vessel) x gear used. This showed a remarkably

simple pattern analogous to an ‘additive model’ for main effects in standard univariate

analyses (Clarke &amp;amp; Gorley, 2001). Hierarchical complete linkage cluster and

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses were used to discriminate landings (averaged by

grouping factors) sampled along the Northeastern coast of Brazil. This characterisation was

carried out by considering the pre-defined grouping factors (gears, state, and trip duration or

vessel category) that were considered relevant in defining the artisanal northeastern reef

fishery.

Clustering analysis aims to reduce the number of studied objects (individuals) by

grouping them in homogeneous classes. The entire following analysis was based on non-

metric properties combining cluster and MDS and since the precise similarity value will not

have any direct significance, the complete linkage was chosen as the best appropriated linkage

option. The similarity matrix was calculated using a coefficient less sensitive to missing data.

In this case, the distance coefficient of Bray–Curtis was chosen. Similarity was computed as

S=1-D, where D is the Bray-Curtis distance.

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) can be considered to be an alternative to factor

analysis. In general, the goal of the analysis is to detect meaningful underlying dimensions



Chapter 2

19

that allow the researcher to explain observed similarities or dissimilarities (distances) between

the investigated objects. In factor analysis, the similarities between objects (e.g. variables) are

expressed in the correlation matrix (or variance/covariance matrix). With MDS, one may

analyse any kind of similarity or dissimilarity matrix, in addition to correlation. MDS do not

require either normality of distribution or linearity between variable. A stress coefficient

indicates the fit of the graphic representation similar to R2 in regression analyses. Each MDS

representation plot here had stress values lower than 0.15. As the cluster analysis, the MDS

were also carried out considering the state, vessel category, and gear or trip duration as

factors. Groupings from the cluster analysis were superimposed on the MDS ordination in

order to appraise the adequacy and the mutual consistency of both representations.

Analyses were based on species frequency data only as information on weight was only

available for the main species caught.

In a first step, cluster and MDS plot were based on an averaged data matrix. Matrix 1

was based on the average of the frequency number by species caught during each trip within

each category states x vessel x gear. For instance, the frequencies of number of each species

were averaged for the category motorised boat (BOM) that used traps as a gear and operated

in the state of Pernambuco and so on for all combinations between vessel types, gears and

state. Matrix 2 was based on the average of the frequency number by species caught by boat

within each category states x Trip duration x gear. In addition to the above technique, a two-

way Analysis of similarity test (2 way ANOSIM) was used to test the significance of observed

differences between groups (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994). Differences according to the crossed

factors ‘state’, ‘vessel’ or ‘trip duration’ (defined a priori) were tested. The gear factor was

not tested as it was the least relevant for the discrimination of groups as identified through

cluster and MDS analysis (but see results section).

The null hypothesis - ‘no state effect allowing for the fact there may be time at sea

effect’ and the opposite hypothesis ‘no trip duration effect allowing for the fact there may be a

state effect’ - were tested.

Differences according to the crossed factors ‘state’ and ‘vessel’ were also tested. The

null hypothesis - ‘no state effect allowing for the fact there may be vessel effect’ and the

opposite hypothesis ‘no vessel effect allowing for the fact there may be a state effect’ - were

tested.

The ANOSIM analysis aimed to test statistically the groups defined with cluster and

MDS analysis. The analysis was, however, based on the original matrix (landings sampled)

instead of an averaged catch.

II.II.2.3. Study of the fleet dynamics through their catch composition

The Shannon index of diversity (H’) (Margalef, 1958), which combines information on

species richness (number of species) and how individuals are distributed among species

(evenness), was calculated considering the identified clusters from MDS and ANOSIM which

was thought to be relevant in defining typologies for the reef fisheries in Northeast Brazil.

The similarity of percentage analysis (SIMPER) (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994; Clarke &amp;amp;

Gorley, 2001) was used to examine the percentage contribution that each species is

responsible to the dissimilarity between two groups and thus identifies those species which

discriminate between groups. The Indicator species analysis (ISA) (Dufrêne &amp;amp; Legendre,

1997), was also performed to detect and describe the value of those species that characterise

typologies. This method produces an ‘Indicator Value’ (IV) for each species within each

group. It varies from 0 (non indicator species) to 100 (perfect indication species exclusive of

the group). The ‘indicator value’ (IV) of a species for a partition of sites is the largest value of

(IV) observed over all clusters. The significance of the maximum IV of each species was

assessed by a Monte Carlo procedure, the null hypothesis being: ‘Indicator value is no larger

than would be expected by chance’ (i.e. that the species has no indicator value). Indicator

values superior to 20% were highlighted in order to visualise the ‘core conservation area’ of

these species (McGeoch &amp;amp; Chown, 1998).

II.II.2.4. Linking abiotic factors to catch composition

The relationship between abiotic factors and the catch composition was examined using

BVSTEP procedure (Clarke &amp;amp; Gorley, 2001). As an alternative to the canonical

correspondence analysis, Clarke and Ainsworth (1993) proposed a method called BIO-ENV

for empirically linking environmental variables to biotic matrix. BVSTEP can be compared to

stepwise regression concept, using forward or backward selection (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994).

The routine calculates a measure of agreement between two (dis)similarity matrices. This was

done by rank correlating the matching element with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ?.

Given the exponential escalation in the number of combinations of abiotic variables that BIO-

ENV has to search through, a stepwise search through the possibilities was undertaken with

the BVSTEP routine. The abiotic dissimilarity matrix included the following abiotic

attributes: vessels, gear, depth, number of fishers, moon light (in proportion of light), period

of the year (trimester), and effort as number of fishers per days spent at sea. Normalised

Euclidean distance was used. The Spearman’s rank correlation (?) between the abiotic and



Chapter 2

21

biota similarity matrices was tested using a permutation procedure under the null hypothesis

that there is no relation whatsoever between the two matrices.

II.II.2.5. Role of snappers exploitation in the Northeast Brazil reef fishery

From a management point of view, it is relevant to have the best knowledge of the

species that really matter in the reef fishery dynamic, such as snappers in the studied area. A

generalisation of the BIO-ENV routine called BIO-BIO (the abiotic matrix is replaced by the

biotic matrix) allowed the determination of the small subset of species whose similarity

matrix best matches the entire set of species (Clarke &amp;amp; Ainsworth, 1993; Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick,

1994). This analysis aims to find the smallest possible subset of species, which combined,

‘explain’ most of the pattern in the full data set. Clarke and Ainsworth (1993) found that the

best subset would be defined when the similarity matrix obtained from the smallest set of

species reached a correlation with the similarity matrix obtain from the full set about ?&gt;0.95,

as it was found that when ? reach this level no distinction could be found between two

ordinations (note that ? would be 1 if the full set of species was considered).

Within the determined subset, each species, particularly the snappers, contribution was

looked at.

II.III. Results

The catch composition of the reef fisheries in Northeastern Brazil is composed by 187

species distributed among 14 families. However, the Lutjanidae family dominated the catch

(from 1996-2000) when considered the percentage in number of fish (28.7%).

II.III.1. Determination of groups

Considering the matrix 1 (see methods), the cluster (Fig. II.1) and MDS representation

(Fig. II.2) the state factor followed by the vessel category appeared to be the main factors

driving the catch composition (species number and number of individuals for every species).

The cluster analysis separated 10 groups at 40% of similarity (threshold arbitrarily chosen to

get few clusters in numbers and well defined (Romesburg, 1984; Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre,

1998). In a first approach, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte landings presented

specific catch composition while Bahia and Ceará catches could not be clearly separated.

Within each state cluster, the factor ‘vessel’ segregated better the averaged landings than the

gear factor. The two way ANOSIM test corroborated these results. The global test indicated



Chapter 2

22

that there is a difference between groups (state effect combined to the vessel effect)

(p&gt;0.001). Also, in the overall the pairewise test showed significant differences in the catch

composition between states allowing for the fact that there is a ‘vessel’ effect as well as

between vessel taking into account the state effect (Table II.4).

The analysis based on the matrix 2 defined the groups State x trip duration (trip duration

category formed sub-groups within each state). Cluster (Fig. II.3) and MDS plot (Fig. II.4)

were based on averaged landings by states, trip duration and gear type. The factor ‘state’ and

‘trip duration’ appeared as the main elements driving the catch composition. The states of

Pernambuco and Ceará were split into three groups, Bahia formed one group and Alagoas and

Rio Grande do Norte were rather similar. In the overall, the sub-groups were defined

according to the trip duration category. An ANOSIM test confirmed the differences according

to the crossed factors ‘state’ and ‘trip duration’. Both null hypothesis - ‘no state effect

allowing for the fact there may be gear effect’ and symmetrically ‘no trip duration effect

allowing for the fact there may be a state effect’ - were rejected at p&lt;0.005 (Table II.5). Thus,

from then on, the univariate and multivariate analysis were based using the trip duration

category and state as relevant and best defining the typologies of the reef fishery in Northeast

Brazil.

II.III.3. Typology of groups

The reef fishery in Northeast Brazil was characterised, on the overall, by 4 lutjanids

species: Lutjanus analis, L. chrysurus, L. synagris, and L. jocu (Table II.6). Coryphaena



Chapter 2

27

hippurus and Scomberomorus cavalla presented also an important role for the typification of

groups. Few species were found important in a particular group such as Pseudopeneus

maculatus with 21% contribution for PEA (state of Pernambuco, trip duration category A)

which was typified by one more species, L. synagris (62%). L. synagris also contributed

sensibly for CEA ( State of Ceará trip duration A) and for RNA (state of Rio Grande do Norte

trip duration A). Important contribution were found for L. analis in Pernambuco (trip duration

B, C and D) and in Alagoas (category A) (see Table II.6 for the complete description).

The indicator species analysis (ISA) differs from species associations analysis in that it

determines which species are indicative to a particular group. Good indicator species will be

found mostly in a single group of a typology and be present at most sites belonging to that

group. Indicator species that were significant at p&lt;0.01 were shown with * mark on the Table

II.7. Largest indicator values (IV&gt;20%, in bold in Table II.7) were found in the Ceará (A, B

and D trip duration categories), Pernambuco (A) and Bahia (B). Few species characterised the

fishing area as Opisthonema oglinum for CEA, Holocentrotus adscensionis, Haemulon

melanurum and Malacanthus plumieri for CEB, Lutjanus chrysurus, Rachycentron canadum,

Acanthocybium solandri for CED, Pseudopeneus maculates, Lutjanus synagris, Haemulon

aurolineatum for PEA and Caranx latus for BAB. Some species presented low but significant

IV as they were ‘rare’ species but restricted to a sector and therefore not considered to be here

by chance.

II.III.3.1. Relationship between catch composition pattern and the fishing

typologies.

Each best factor combination issued from the BVSTEP procedure, that showed a higher

Spearman’s rank correlation, was identified for each state (Table II.8). Each correlation was

found significantly different from zero, although no strong match of the catch pattern with

abiotic factors were identified. An important part of the catch variation could not be explained

by the abiotic factors used in the analysis. It appears that the depth, on the northern coast

(Ceará), and trip duration on the southern coast (Bahia, Alagoas) maximised the correlation

coefficient. The dry season (trimester 1 and 4) as well as the crew size were also important for

the south states. It should be noted that Bahia presented the lowest correlation coefficient and

the largest set of abiotic variables required.

II.III.4. Determination of the ‘best’ subset of species that characterised the catch

composition

From all the species combination possible, it was observed that 13 species were the

main responsible for the characterisation of the typologies in the reef fishery in Northeast

Brazil (?=0.952). In other words, only 13 species were required to maximise the correlation

between biotic and abiotic matrices. The family of Lutjanidae was the most important family

with 5 species (Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu, L. vivanus) that showed a

hierarchical structure: the best combination at one level is always a subset of the best

combination at the next level (Table II.9). Species of the families Carangidae (Carangoides

crysos, C. latus, Seriola dumerili), Coryphaenidae (Coryphaena hippurus), Haemulidae

(Haemulon plumieri), Scombridae (Scomberomorus cavalla, S. brasiliensis), and Serranidae

(Cephalopholis fulvus) were also relevant (Table II.9).

II.IV. Discussion

The study of fishery dynamics and their impacts on the reef fish communities needs to

look at the multispecific structure within the technological categories in space and its

evolution over time. In the case of exploited marine species, identification of factors

(determination of fishing typology) that influence the dynamic of the fishing activities and the

structure of this community appears to be necessary, specially in multispecific and multigear

tropical fisheries, by providing a synthetic representation of fishing operations as a necessary

step in understanding the dynamics of mixed fisheries (Pelletier &amp;amp; Ferraris, 2000).



Chapter 2

32

In this study, univariate and multivariate techniques were used, aiming at the

identification of an integrated picture of the structure of the reef system of Northeast Brazil.

Amongst the factors considered (gear, vessel category, state and trip duration category), the

spatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in separating groups in

Northeast Brazil. The fishery dynamic of each state was found to be influenced by a complex

combination of technological and environmental factors that drives the landing composition in

each state.

Considering the technological factors, ‘trip duration’ best discriminated the catch

composition when compared to ‘fleet category’. Although ‘trip duration’ categories are

normally related to the fleet motion (rowing, wind motioned and motor) as motorised boats

generally effectuate the longer trips, there are some exceptions reported in the Northeast

Brazilian reef fishery. For example, wind motioned boats may reach as far as the shelf break

favoured by strong winds in states of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará. For this reason, trip

duration was the factor that best determines the distance from the coastline, the variety and

the uniqueness of the fishing grounds reached and hence the catch composition (more coastal

or deeper water group of species). Although it was expected that the gear factor would

separate groups of catches, the factor ‘gear’ appears to be the less representative for

discriminating the catch landed. The reason for this may be that the Northeastern Brazilian

fishery is typically multigear and multispecies fishery. For most fleet categories, boats may

carry, during a single trip, more than one type of gear.

The complexity of the significant factors appears to be the main feature (influencing the

catch composition) and is related to the fishing grounds, i.e. the distance from the shore, the

fleet depth operation, and also probably their variety and their diversity. Pelletier and Ferraris

(2000) state that the analysis of the Senegalese artisanal fishery dynamics could be improved

if fishing locations were precisely defined. Same considerations could apply here. The trip

duration was found an important factor influencing the fishery dynamics as it is commonly

related to the distance from the shore and that alternative factors as information on depth are

not always available.

The maximum of diversity reached at the intermediate ‘trip duration’ category depend

on the habitat availability (Longhurst &amp;amp; Pauly, 1987; Levinton, 2001) and the ecological

range of the species caught may explain the pattern found (shallow and deep species mixing at

intermediate range, chapter 3).

Although in some instance the diversity may be partially influenced by the

biogeography of reef assemblage (Floeter et al., 2001; Joyeux et al., 2001; Araújo &amp;amp; Feitosa,



Chapter 2

33

in press), it is interesting to note that the state with the wider continental shelf (as Rio Grande

do Norte) presented lower diversity than the states with narrower continental shelf (as

Alagoas and Bahia). This could be explained by the fact that fishing trips in Rio Grande do

Norte do not occur much in deeper waters. Conversely, fishermen from Bahia can easily reach

deeper fishing grounds thus resulting in higher index of diversity. The state of Ceará,

however, showed intermediate values of diversity index which could be explained by the fact

that, although with a wide continental shelf, the state of Ceará has external factors as winds

and currents which drives the boat to reach deeper fishing grounds within a shorter period of

time.

Snappers were the main part of the artisanal catch and contributed most to the similarity

between groups. The subset that best defined the catch variability was primarily represented

by snappers as Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and, to a lower extend, L.

vivanus.

Several criteria may characterise the reef fishery of the Northeastern Brazil as for

instance life history and ecology of species caught, technical characteristics, geographical

characteristics (i.e. geomorphology of the shelf) (see Chapter 1) and local culture. Fishing

patterns observed respond to simultaneous interaction of these attributes. Each vessel has a

catchability and efficiency, which is specific to its design and to its operation range in relation

to the species caught. Moreover, similar fleet may have a distinct impact consistent with the

fishing area. Changes in the catch composition will incorporate technological effect through

spatial and/or temporal changes.

The heterogeneity of the northeastern reef fishery described here may have

consequences on an eventual choice of a model for management issues. Multispecies fishery

models may be defined within two main categories, the one which account for biological

interactions and models of technological interactions. Incorporating biological interaction into

multispecies models present several difficulties as pointed out by Pikitch (1988). Interactions

arising from technical scheme are more realistically identified and can be applied in stock

assessment and management (Brugge &amp;amp; Holden, 1991; Gulland, 1991; Lucena et al., 2002).

Technical interactions in the reef fishery rely on competing fleet exploiting the same

resources and on the mixed catch resulting from multiple target species (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters,

1992). Fleets can exploit different stages in the life cycle of the fish stock, in simultaneous or

sequential harvesting and also can involve different geographical areas. Such cases are very

common in tropical fisheries that are typically multifleet and multispecies. Because technical-

interactions models are rather straightforward (by opposition to biological interaction models)



Chapter 2

34

and are essentially derived from single-species models (Brugge &amp;amp; Holden, 1991), the impacts

of fishing pressure on reef species and ecosystem should be investigated considering such

factor (see Chapter 5).

Managers should be aware that implementation of a common harvest strategy may not

be applicable for the entire zone. Every state presented proper dynamics and individual

management policies should be preferred. As discussed by Hilborn and Walters (1992) if one

assumes as a premise that there is a spatially structured system, a grand opportunity could

arise in setting up a range of alternative management policies for the various replicates. The

alternative policies can be used in a quicker way (smaller system) and in a safe way,

providing a buffer against risks of overexploiting some areas. In the case of the Northeast

Brazil, artisanal reef fishery stock assessment modelling and consequently harvest strategies

should take in consideration that the region is not homogeneous (i.e. different fleet

composition, species interactions, geomorphological characteristics). In order to refine such

perception, the spatial effect from survey, in addition to more detailed information about

commercial fishing activity, should be gathered.

This analysis also helped to reduce the species complexity to few ones. Within this

subset, lutjanids appear to be the main group as they represented most of the catch and were

found to be driving the fishery dynamics. Lutjanids are also very appreciated by the local

market and are fish of a high commercial value. Thus, further attention should be paid on the

ecology and on the impact of fishing on such group. Reef fishery science argues that, due to

the high complexity of the system, single species assessment may not be adequate. An

alternative may be on the half way between, considering models that take into account data

aggregated into major species groups (Ralston &amp;amp; Polovina, 1982). In the present case,

lutjanids should be the group of species used.

Main conclusions and thesis outlook

In this chapter, the overall picture of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil was looked at

based on univariate and multivariate techniques. These techniques were useful in obtaining an

integrated picture of the structure of the system. It also helped to characterise the fishing

activity in the area.

Within the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were the main part of the artisanal

catch and contributed most to the similarity between groups, outstanding the Lutjanus

chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and in a lower extend, L. vivanus. Amongst the

factors considered, the spatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in

isolating groups in Northeast Brazil. The factor ‘gear’ appears to be the less representative for

discriminating the catches, as the Northeastern Brazilian fishery is typically a multigear

fishery. For most fleet categories, boats may carry in a single trip more than one type of gear.

Considering the technological factors, ‘trip duration’ best discriminates the catch composition

when compared to ‘fleet category’. However, given some exceptions (mainly related to

favourable strong winds), ‘trip duration’ categories are normally related to the fleet motion as

motorised boats generally effectuate the longer trips. Fleet categories will be further

considered in this study within the stock assessment (Chapter 6), not only because they were

efficient in defining typologies in the Northeast reef fishery but also, for practical reasons,

considering future management measures to be suggested for the main species exploited by

the reef fishery in the region.

In order to better understand how the fleet dynamic is related to the species dynamic,

the distribution of snappers (primary group of species driving the fishery) and their

relationship with the fishery dynamic was studied in Chapter 3. Such information will

consider the relationship between the species distribution and the dynamics of the fleets (gear

used, fleet category and operating area).

Chapter III. Bathymetric trends of Northeastern Brazilian

snappers (Pisces, Lutjanidae): Implications for the reef

fishery dynamic

III.I. Introduction

The abundance of marine species fluctuates in space and time. Such fluctuations may

be due to physical (currents, temperature, etc.), or biological processes (as growth and

mortality) as well as behavioural processes (migration, habitat use) (Jennings et al., 2001).

Numerous studies have been conducted on spatial and/or temporal distribution of reef fish

communities, as size dependent processes have long been recognised as important for the

community structure and resources (Sale, 1980; Gobert, 1994)

In the case of reef fishes, it is rather common to observe size distribution according to

depth (MacPherson &amp;amp; Duarte, 1991; Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). A common pattern observed

for species is the increase of the number of large specimens with increasing depth (Roberts,

1996). This pattern has been attributed to two main natural processes: ontogenetic migrations

from coastal reefs to the external part of the shelf or depth related growth and mortality rates.

While ontogenetic migration may be related to availability of suitable prey for juvenile fish or

predation avoidance (Roberts, 1996), differential growth and mortality may be related to

environmental factors. Temperature variation according to the depth gradient leads to

variation in basal metabolism rates and therefore may alter the growth rate (Longhurst &amp;amp;

Pauly, 1987). Determining the natural pattern of distribution is specially important for species

that are targeted by fisheries, as the effects of fishing in a population may also be extended to

population parameters.

Fishes are an important component of reef environment as they influence the structure

of the communities through predation, competition, and territoriality processes (Sale, 1980).

The complexity of the interaction on the reef ecosystem turns the study on fishing effect

rather difficult (Jennings &amp;amp; Polunin, 1995b; Polunin &amp;amp; Roberts, 1996). In Brazil, various

species are exploited by fishers mostly using hook and line, gill nets and traps. Reef fisheries,

which operate mainly in the northeastern, have an important role in the socio-economic life of

the region (Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 2001). However, very little is known on the fisheries dynamics

operating in this area and their effects on reef fish communities. This chapter focused on five

species of Lutjanus, which inhabit coastal to deep demersal waters. The main species caught

by the artisanal fishery in Northeast of Brazil were considered: the mutton snapper L. analis,

the yellowtail snapper L. chrysurus, the dog snapper L. jocu, the lane snapper L. synagris and

the silk snapper L. vivanus. The distribution and relative abundance of these species along a

depth gradient, across the Northeast Brazil continental shelf and upper slope, were described

and analysed. The effects of the reef fishery on distribution, size of fish and CPUE (catch-

per-unit-of-effort) of snappers considering the relationship between the species distribution

and the dynamics of the fleets (gear used, fleet category and operating area) were also

discussed.

III.II. Material and methods

III.II.1. Data collection

Data were collected from August 1996 to March 2000 (REVIZEE program). Species

were identified and measured at the landing site. The landings sites were chosen within each

state according to their contribution in the local artisanal fishery. Sites were localised over

the five states, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia (see Chapter I,

Fig.I.1). In addition, some data were collected from research vessels that operated on the

banks and oceanic islands (Atol das Rocas and Arquipélago de São Pedro e São Paulo) off the

Rio Grande do Norte coast.

Fishermen were interviewed and information regarding the operation within the fishery

and catch were collected. Within the REVIZEE framework, more than 69 000 records of

fishes supplied by 2400 trips were gathered. For this study, nearly 23 000 fishes, which had

information on depth, were considered amongst the 5 species of Lutjanus (Table III.1).

Information on specific landings and effort (number of boats) by fleet category were

collected for the studied period by the program ‘ESTATPESCA’ held by the Brazilian

Environmental Agency for official statistics (IBAMA, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente

e dos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis). The total number of boats (averaged along the months)



Chapter 3

38

that were in activity during the studied period were about 17000 boats. The reef fishery can

be distributed into five categories of fleets classified as following, from the most rudimental

to the most technically advanced fleet: ‘Paquete’ (PQT), ‘Jangada’ (JAN), ‘Bote a vela’

(BOV), ‘Bote’ (BOT), ‘Bote motorizado’ (BOM) (see Table II.3 for details).

III.II.2. Data analysis

The relationship between depth and fish size was assessed by correlation and regression

analyses. The correlation analysis was used to test the statistical significance of the

relationship for each species. The correlation between depth and size was determined for all

species using non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. One of the advantages

of the non-parametric correlation is that the resulting coefficient is not influenced by outliers

that are often present in biological data. Also, normality in depth and fish size data is not

required to perform the analysis. The regression analysis was performed using the Kendall's

robust line-fit method (1990) described in Sokal and Rohlf (1995). Since slopes from all pairs

of observations required to be computed and stored, the vast amount of calculation needed

drove us to use only a random sample of paired observations. As for non-parametric

correlation, the non-parametric regression does not require normality of data, the slope of the

regression curve is not affected by outliers, and it allows the independent variable being either

of the Model I or Model II type (Model I regression assumes that (1) the independent variable

X is controlled by the observer, (2) there is no observation error, (3) process error are

normally distributed with a mean=0 and (4) samples along the regression line have a common

variance which is the variance of the error term, Model II assumes that both variables Y and

X are measured with error, and it gives a regression line lying between the Y on X and the X

on Y regressions. The model II regression estimates a slope between two variables that are

meaningful only when measurement error is the sole cause of statistical error.). Kendall's

rank correlation was used in order to test whether the slope (?) for each species was different

from zero.

Catches were analysed by gear, which were arranged amongst the following categories:

line, net and trap. Minimum, maximum and average values of fish size were analysed by gear

in order to describe the gear effects on the life history of the species. For each species,

catches were also analysed by sampled year and fleet category. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)

was used as an index of relative abundance. The catch was defined in two different ways: (1)

by using total weight (Kg) caught by species and (2) by using number of individuals caught.



Chapter 3

39

Furthermore, in order to standardise the effort between gears, the time (days) spent at sea for

each trip was chosen as the best estimate. In spite of the roughness of the unit of effort, catch

and effort for each species were positively correlated (Spearman’s correlation r = 0.5, p&amp;lt;

0.001). The CPUE analysis was carried out species specific considering the following depth

strata: &amp;lt;20m (inner shelf), 20 to 80m (outer shelf), and &gt;80m (slope) (Mabesoone &amp;amp;

Coutinho, 1970). The outer shelf zone was not detailed for size distribution analysis as

information on effort was too much scarce. The Kruskall -Wallis non-parametric test was

used to test the differences of the CPUE index between depth strata. We also looked at CPUE

versus depth strata relationship using Spearman’s rank correlation analysis.

III.III. Results

III.III.1. Catch composition of Lutjanus species by year, gear, depth and fleet

All five species showed a positive and significant correlation between the fork length

and the depth (Table III.2).

Considering all gears pooled together, the fish size caught ranged for snappers from 7.5

to 103 cm FL. Mean fork length by species showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 1999

(non significant for L. jocu) except for L. chrysurus that showed a significant increasing trend

in the mean size (Fig. III.1).

Line fishery caught snappers from 7.5 to 99 cm FL, while nets caught individuals from

13 to 85 cm FL and traps caught individuals from 16 to 103 cm FL (Fig. III.2). Analysing the

catch composition by species, every gear (note: the term gear is used as a generic term that

represents the entire category, e.g. ‘Net’ represents all nets used in the fishery that encompass

every selectivity characteristics) affected roughly the entire size range of the snapper



Chapter 3

40

populations (Fig. III.2). The fork length of snappers caught by all the three gears significantly

increased according to depth (ANOVA, F=1296.2, df=2, p&lt;0.001) (Table III.3). The

operating depth range was higher for line but shallower for net and traps (Table III.4a). Paired

gear groups were tested using the Mann-Whitney U procedure. Line depth operation was

significantly different from net and trap (p&lt;0.001), where no difference could be

distinguished between net and traps. Lines, nets and traps caught individuals of similar size

for all species. Fishers using hook and line operated preferentially along the outer shelf. Net

users occurred preferentially in the shallow water (inner shelf) and the outer shelf and, traps

were set up preferentially within the 20-80 m (Table III.4b). Largest specimens of each

species were caught at deeper limits of the species range.

When analysed by fleet category, on the overall, BOM affected roughly the entire fish

size range. The PQT fleet always caught smaller individuals, while JAN, BOT, and BOT

oscillated within the intermediate size range (Fig. III.3). The PQT and BOV or BOT were

restricted to, respectively, inner and outer shelf and, outer shelf and slope (Table III.5). The

fleets JAN and BOM fished along the entire depth range (Table III.5). Similar pattern was

observed for median operating depth and proportion of fleet (Table III.6). As a general

pattern, small individuals were exclusive to shallow waters and larger ones to deeper waters;

an intermediate zone presented a mixed sized fishes (Fig. III.4).

studied area.

III.III.2. Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) versus depth relationship

Although snappers have a wide range of distribution, differences between species were

detected. The maximum relative abundance (numerical and biomass CPUE) of the Lutjanus

species varied according to depth. L. synagris and L. vivanus were more abundant at the

extremes of the snappers distribution range: shallower and deeper waters respectively. The

three other species (L. analis, L. chrysurus, and L. jocu) showed a smoother distribution with

a maximum abundance reported in the 20 - 80m depth strata, the outer shelf part (Table III.7a

and 7b). The relationship between the numerical CPUE (individuals caught per day at sea)

and the depth was negatively correlated for L. synagris, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and L. analis.

L. vivanus presented a non-significant positive relationship (Table III.8a), while the

relationship between the depth and the CPUE in kg per day at sea was negative for L.

synagris, positive for L. analis and L. vivanus, and non significant for L. chrysurus and L.

jocu (Table III.8b).

III.III.3. Fleet interactions and catch composition of Lutjanus species by fleet

Motorised boats ‘Botes Motorizados’ (BOM) and wind motioned ‘jangadas’ (JAN)

were the most important fleet categories captures lutjanids with respectively 51% and 28% of

the total number of trips during the studied period along the northeastern coast (Table III.9).

Motorised boats operated mostly from 20 m towards offshore (over 80 m deep) whilst JAN

fished from the coast up to 80m deep. Sailing boats (BOV) and mixed boats (BOT)

represented 5% of the total number of trips with an operation range mostly above 80 m. PQT

represented 15% of the total number of trips and operated mainly from the coast up to 20 m

deep.

The snappers’ catch composition (Fig. III.5) shows that motorised boats (BOM) was the

main category that fished on the five studied species as they operated along the entire depth

gradient (Table III.9). However, L. synagris, that inhabits shallower waters, was less affected

by motorised boats but it was the main target of the wind propelled ‘paquetes’ (PQT) and

‘jangadas’ (JAN). Conversely, L. vivanus, which inhabits deeper waters, was targeted almost

exclusively by boats (Bom and BOV). The remaining species were mainly caught by

motorised boats although ‘jangadas’ (JAN) had a significant role in the exploitation. As

fishing activity was greater at shallow (&lt;20 m) and intermediate depth (20 to 80 m), where

rudimental fleet and more advanced technologically fleets overlap, fishery in Northeast of

Brazil affects mainly species that inhabits preferably this depth layer (L. analis, L. jocu and L.

chrysurus).

The ‘jangadas’ (JAN) fleet category was the most numerous fleet in activity along the

northeastern coast, from Ceará to Alagoas (53% of total operating boats) (Table III.10),

followed by the motorised boats category (BOM) with 22.4% of the total fleet. However,

although motorised boats were less numerous, their fishing power was greater than

‘jangada’s’ ones and, landings of motorised boats (BOM) and ‘jangadas’ (JAN) equally

represented 27% of the Lutjanus catches recorded by the Brazilian official statistics during the

period from 1997 to 2001 (ESTATPESCA). Motorised boats (BOM) and sailing boats

(BOV) showed the greater yield considering the biomass, CPUE and the numerical CPUE.

BOM yielded 13.7 and BOV 9.6 kg / days spent at sea whilst JAN yielded 6.1 kg/ days (Table

III.11a and III.11b).

Trip duration (days spent at sea) was different amongst fleet categories and states (Table

III.12). While small fleets, ‘paquete’ (PQT) and ‘jangada’ (JAN), spent at sea no more than

two days, more sophisticated fleets trip duration (BOM, BOV) could reach 12 days at sea.

However, differences between states were recorded. ‘Jangadas’ (JAN) from Ceará and Rio

Grande do Norte spent, in average, 2 days at sea whilst, in Pernambuco, trip was restricted to

a day. Motorised boats (BOM) time at sea ranged from 1 - 2 days in Bahia to 4 - 5 days in

Pernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte. In Ceará trips of Motorised boats (BOM)

may last up to 12 days .

III.IV. Discussion

Patterns of the relationship between body size and abundance in natural assemblage

have been documented for a number of animal taxa (Gaston et al., 1993). Also, in a fishery

context, an increase of the number of large specimen with increasing depth is commonly

observed (see review in Roberts, 1996). Our results indicated that significant body size

versus depth relationship has been observed for each species. Bathymetric distribution

according to demersal fish size has been already reported (Lukens, 1981; MacPherson &amp;amp;

Duarte, 1991). The relationships, examined in our study, showed a general trend going

towards a greater size with increasing depth and at the same time towards smaller size in

shallower waters, a result also reported in various studies (Rooker, 1995; Machias et al.,

1998; Rex &amp;amp; Etter, 1998). However, the depth- body size relationship is weaker at

intermediate depths due to a spatial overlap. Indeed, when small individuals are exclusive to

shallow waters and only large ones are caught in deep waters, mixed catch of medium and

large fishes is reported at intermediate depths. This movement may be related to feeding and

reproductive habits (Uiblein, 1991; MacPherson, 1998; St-John, 1999; Grutter, 2000;

Carrasson &amp;amp; Matallanas, 2001).

Oliveira (2000) reported that, in the Northeastern Brazilian waters, maximum relative

abundance (CPUE) of teleosts on the external part of the shelf and the slope was observed

within the depth strata of 100 – 150 m. In this study, the maximum abundance of four

Lutjanus species (L. vivanus did not present a significant pattern) was negatively correlated

with the increasing depth, when numerical CPUE was considered but the relation changed

when biomass CPUE was considered. Individuals were caught in greater number in shallow

waters but as most of them were small sized fishes, the relationship between CPUE index,

considering weight, and depth showed a mixed pattern. Several hypothesis have been offered

to describe this pattern, including differential mortality or growth with depth or migration to

deeper water with increasing size (Roberts, 1996). Ecological characteristics of shallow and

deep waters may be responsible for such distribution. Shallow waters feature shelters for

younger fish, as they, generally, have a higher productivity and are inhabited by small preys

that are also targeted by young, small sized fish. The maximum length reported for the

Lutjanus species (L. analis: 94 cm FL, L. chrysurus: 87 cm FL, L. jocu: 128 cm FL, L.

synagris: 60 cm FL, L. vivanus: 83 cm FL) (Allen, 1985) is similar to the maximum length

registered for the Northeast Brazilian catches. For all species, young individuals were also

caught. Hence, the three main operating fishing gears (traps, lines and gill nets) affect almost

the entire range of the life history of the Lutjanus species. However, gears caught fishes of

similar size for all species. Different category of fleet were discriminated by depth of

operation although no great differences were found in mean size caught.

In a multispecific perspective, the fleet/gear comes into contact with stocks of different

species, and a mixed catch result due to the exploitation of technologically interdependent

species (Anderson, 1986). In such a context, the technological interactions is not only related

to the selection of part of the stock but also with the selection of the species caught.

Considering the species’ distribution and the multispecific nature of the reef fishery in

Northeast Brazil, fleet operation may vary from shallow to deep waters depending, amongst

others factors (environmental conditions, motorised or wind motioned boats, shelf width,

trade winds, etc), on the availability of a typical coastal species (as L. synagris) or a typical

deeper-water species (as L. vivanus). Considering such stratified distribution, fleets with

different operation capacities will affect stocks on different ways.

These differences may not be necessarily related to gear (a boat in tropical fishery may

carry more than one gear) but also to the fleet power, which is related to fleet category, and



Chapter 3

49

also to the state, due to its environmental characteristics. Fishing grounds, i.e. shallow or

deep waters, will be reached according to fleet power. Factors as engine power, ‘size’ of the

crew, carrying capacity, presence or absence of ice are related to the distance to the shore and

hence, the time at sea. Additionally, environmental conditions such as wind, rain, currents, or

the continental shelf width may influence the access to shallow or deep fishing grounds.

Our results highlighted that technological interactions will affect the catch composition

and therefore the fishing impact on snappers. All fleets categories mostly operated within the

20-80 m depth zone, what consequently affected mostly L. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus.

Motorised boats (BOM) affected mainly L. vivanus because of its deeper waters fleet

operation. ‘Jangada’ (JAN) and ‘paquete’ (PQT) had as their main target L. synagris since

they operate in shallower waters.

Also, climatic, oceanographic or geographic characteristics as winds, currents or

geomorphology of the shelf may influence the fleet operation and catch composition. For

example, wind motioned boats, PQT, JAN, BOV, in Ceará had a greater operating range, and

therefore affect a greater number of species, due to the dominant winds that allow the vessel

to reach deeper waters.

Fleets are likely to exploit different stages of the life cycle of a fish community while

operating in different geographical areas, in simultaneous or sequential harvesting (Charles &amp;amp;

Reed, 1985). Fisheries of the same fish community are linked through their exploitation. To

maintain the sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource, the

optimal fleet mix and catch allocation should be carefully considered (Kulbicki et al., 2000;

Labrosse et al., 2000; Letourneur et al., 2000; Lucena et al., 2002).

The multifleet and multispecies nature of the northeastern Brazilian fisheries has

various consequences in terms of resources management and ecological issues. In the study

area, few marine protected areas (MPA) have been created along the coast as a part of a new

management alternative of reef ecosystems (Ferreira, 2000). Some marine protected areas

have been set parallel nearby the coast, mainly because of logistical reasons, i.e. zone easily

accessible and that can be watched from the shore. This setting would only preserve part of

the life cycle of some species, excluding other parts of life cycle and, possibly, other species.

Due to the within and between fish species spatial structure, the MPA design will have

consequences on its efficiency (Kramer &amp;amp; Chapman, 1999). In small reserves near the shore,

snappers’ home range will exceed the MPA limits. Considering the reef fishery in Northeast

Brazil, the MPA might be most efficient if set in direction to the off-shore in an attempt to

protect the entire range of fish distribution and consequently the entire life cycle of the



Chapter 3

50

species. This could also offer some protection of various kind of habitats used by different

stage of the life-cycle of each species.

Although one is aware that a dataset originated from commercial fisheries may only

partially represent the fish community because of gear selectivity and fishing tactics, one may

consider that variations in the effort and/or gear fishing power represent the actual trend in the

fish distribution (fishers go where the fish is). More attention should be given on

technological interactions and multispecies aspects of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil as

stock assessment models for the management of single species fished by one type of gear (or

fleet) may be inadequate to apply to the northeastern Brazilian fisheries and to predict

changes at the assemblage level (Pikitch, 1988; Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). The inter- and

intra-specific bathymetric distribution and the multifleet character of the Northeastern

Brazilian reef fishery demonstrate that considering only one category of a fleet will likely bias

our assessment on the real impact of fishing activities.

Main conclusions and thesis outlook

In this chapter, the bathymetric trends of Northeastern Brazilian snappers were

described and its relation with the reef fishery dynamic were considered. For all species,

small fish are generally found near the coast in shallow waters and the larger fish are found

off-shore in deeper waters. In terms of abundance, mean maximum relative abundance varied,

for each species, from the shallow water layers with L. synagris to the deep water layers with

L. vivanus. Gears catch fishes of similar size for all species and affect almost the entire range

of their life history. Fleets with different operation capacities will affect stocks on different

ways and this is mainly related to the fleet power, which is related to fleet category. All fleets

categories mostly operated within the 20-80 m depth zone, what consequently affected mostly

L. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus. Motorised boats affected mainly L. vivanus because of its

deeper waters fleet operation. JAN and PQT had as their main target L. synagris since they

operate in shallower waters.

For the next chapter, the status of the Lutjanus species will be assessed and it will be

evaluated the applicability of traditional methods (as yield per recruit model and length based

methods). These methods are widely applied for the assessment and management of tropical

fishery. Fishing mortality and stock size are parameters to be estimated for each of the studied

species.

Chapter IV. Stock Assessment of snappers using traditional

approaches

IV.I. Introduction

The basic purpose of fish stock assessment is to provide managers advice on the

optimum exploitation of the aquatic living resources to guarantee a sustainable production

over time (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998). Broadly, fisheries management is concerned with the

utilisation of the fish as a resource for the best benefit to society, i.e. profitability of the

fishing industry and maintaining the livelihoods of the fishermen (Pascoe et al., 1997).

Due to the poor knowledge of the resource dynamics and the often limited range of data

available, the management of fish stocks in developing countries is often based on fragile

foundations. The knowledge of the status of fish stocks is poor or even inexistent, and this

lack of suitable information can hamper stock assessment and fisheries management (Reis,

1992).

Stock assessment is typically carried out with the finest of information available. This

‘best’ information is often identified as representing the most likely values for the parameters

of the population under study (Restrepo et al., 1990). Powerful analytical techniques permit

reconstruction of the population dynamics of exploited fish stocks and provide estimates of

mortality rates and population abundance based on interpretation of commercial catch

statistical data (Megrey, 1989). One of the first theories concerning the exploitation of fish

stocks come from Baranov (1918). It provided the theoretical basis for Derzhavin (1922) who

was perhaps the first to conceive the idea of applying data describing the age structure of a

population to catch statistics in order to calculate the contribution of each year’s cohort to

each year’s total catch.

From time to time, however, new models are being elaborated, or extensions and

augmentations of older methods are being developed. There are several methods based on

catch-at-age data. According to Hilborn and Walters (1992), these models can be divided in

two classes: (a) Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) or cohort analysis which calculates stock

size based on catches with no underlying statistical assumptions (b) ‘Statistical catch-at-age

Methods’ which rely on formal statistical models.



Chapter 4

52

VPA (Gulland, 1965; Murphy, 1965) and cohort analysis (Pope, 1972) has been

widely applied to commercial fish stock assessment. It consists of a ‘backwards solution’

where historical abundance of a cohort are estimated on the basis of subsequent catches.

The ‘Statistical catch-at-age Methods’, reviewed by Megrey (1989) ‘provide more

formal methods for estimating the current abundance of cohorts still being fished. They are an

extremely powerful and elegant synthesis of VPA, catch curves, selection curves, and stock

and recruitment’ (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). Data requirements vary from only catch by age

and year up to information concerning effort Paloheimo’s (1980), Fournier and Archibald’s

(1982) and Dupont’s (1983) models, total catch by year Fournier and Archibald’s (1982)

model and catch estimate error. As for the classical VPA extension, new statistical methods

have been developed in recent years to improve population estimates.

Although age-structured models are considered the best choice for most of fisheries

biologists, determining age by reading check marks in hard parts of the fish is neither an easy

task nor a cheap one, specially in tropical fisheries. Jones (1984) first developed an adaptation

of the age cohort analysis to length-based method, the length-cohort analysis. The length-

frequency analysis was used traditionally to validate of age determination methods. These

techniques are growing in importance and new approaches have been developed in order to

use length distributions for stock assessment (Fournier et al., 1990).

Length cohort analysis was developed for species that cannot be aged. It is applied in

the situation when only length composition data for the total fishery are available for one year

(or the average length composition for a sequence of years). It is assumed that the picture

presented by all length classes caught during one year reflects that of a single cohort during its

entire life (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998).

The most suitable assessment method to apply is still a difficult question to answer. The

researcher needs to carefully consider what data are available, what errors the data might be

subjected to what fishery-specific events might be relevant to the population dynamics of the

exploited stock. Mathematical models are then selected in order to extract the most of

information from data (Megrey, 1989). Also, fisheries biologists are always concerned to the

fact that estimates of management-related quantities obtained from quantitative fisheries

assessment methods are subject of errors of all different sources. These errors are related to

the poor knowledge of the resource dynamics or to the poor and/or small quantity of the data.



Chapter 4

53

In this chapter, I analyse the use of traditional methods to assess the current status of 5

target species (Lutjanus analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus) caught in

Northeast Brazil. The limitations of each model are also discussed.

IV.II. Material and methods

The determination of the current status of the stock of five reef fish species regarded as

target for the small scale fishery in North-eastern Brazil (L. analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L.

synagris and L. vivanus) included estimates of the fishery mortality and exploitation rates

using different methods and the determination of reference points as ‘Fmax’ frequently used

for the management of fish stock.

Routine visits to the landing sites of the commercial fishery were undertaken in 5 states

and interviews with skippers and managers were carried out between 1996 to 2000.

Information regarding the operation within the fishery and catch were collected in a monthly

basis. The fork lengths (FL) of commercially landed fish were measured to the nearest

centimetre (see Chapter 3 for details on the number of individuals sampled by species).

Port samples were obtained and annual sampled numbers-at-length were converted to

annual total catches numbers-at-length using information on landing statistics by year and by

state taken from the official Brazilian statistics supplied by IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro do

Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis).

The stocks were evaluated considering the Northeast region as a unit, polling together

information referred to Ceará (CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Paraíba (PB), Pernambuco

(PE), Alagoas (AL), Sergipe (SE) and North Bahia (BA). There was no sampling program for

the states of Paraíba and Sergipe within the scope of the REVIZEE Program as landings for

these states are not as important as for the others states. However, the total catch of Sergipe

and Paraíba was added to the total catch of the Northeast region and the length composition

for these states was here considered as similar to the composition of the adjacent state.

The Brazilian Current (BC) and the North Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) are the

main surface currents on the Brazilian continental margin (Stramma, 1991; da Silveira et al.,

1994; Sadovy, 1996). They originate from the South Equatorial Current at about 5° to 6° S

and flow to the south (BC), and to the north and northwest (NBC). The bifurcation of these

current causes the North-eastern Brazil to be divided into two areas: the northern realm

(States of Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, and oceanic banks) and the northeastern part (states of

Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and the northern part of Bahia) (see Chapter 1 -

Introduction). Considering that the studied species have pelagic eggs and larvae, one would



Chapter 4

54

think that the reef fish in Northeastern Brazil might be comprised of, at least, two different

units of stock. In terms of stock assessment, such statement would imply a separated analysis

considering separately the two areas. However, there is no clear evidence that supports this

hypothesis. Preliminary genetic studies could not discriminate different stock along the

Northeastern coast. It is supposed that fish spawned along the North coast of the Northeast

Brazil may mix with fish spawned in the south coast of the region. Therefore stock

assessment was carried out considering one unique stock.

The catch-at-size models require data on numbers-at-size by year and an assumption

about natural mortality. The total number-at-size was used as input for the use of the Length

cohorts Analysis (Jones, 1984) and consequently, the predictive model of Thompson and Bell

(1934). The age-based VPA (Gulland, 1965) was also used and the total catch-at-size was

converted into the total catch-at-age using age-length-keys (ALKs) constructed from the

direct age reading, separately by species (Rezende et al., 2003).

For the 5 species either the length-cohort analysis and the VPA was used and the

detailed method is described below.

The model of Beverton and Holt (1957) was used to L. vivanus since, for this species,

there is no estimative of total catch and this approach can be used when only the total number

of individuals sampled is available.

IV.II.1. Growth parameters and natural mortality

IV.II.1.1. Growth parameters

For four of the five target species considered in the analysis (L. analis, L. jocu, L.

chrysurus, L. synagris), a three set of growth parameters (Table IV.1), obtained according to

the model of von Bertalanffy (1938), were considered as input for the application of the

length cohort analysis: growth parameters derived directly by the otoliths readings (Rezende

et al., 2003), growth parameters obtained by back-calculated length-at-age (Rezende et al.,

2003) and growth parameters determined empirically according to the method of Jones

(1984). The growth parameters are necessary as input for the length cohort analysis and hence

the predictive model of Thompson and Bell based on length.



Chapter 4

55

IV.II.1.1.1 Growth parameters based on direct readings of the otoliths

Total length (FL) in cm, was recorded and the pair of the otoliths sagittae removed.

Analysis of fish age was based on examination of transverse sections of sagittal otoliths.

Alternate opaque and hyalines zones were counted through stereomicroscopic. Fish were

considered to be 1 year-old after the formation of the first zone and a further year was added

for each subsequent zone (Ferreira et al., 2004a; 2004b; 2004c; 2004d). Such pattern was

validated by marginal increment analysis (Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira, in press). The otoliths were

analysed: the four species showed and annual pattern however only L. chrysurus showed a

very strong pattern. These results were supported by several studies already published (see

for review, Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira, in press). Further study on direct validation techniques using

tetracycline marking are currently being developed (Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira, pers. com.).

For the otoliths direct readings, two different readers assigned ages for the fish, with no

previous information on the fish length. If two readings agreed then that age was adopted as

definitive. The otolith was considered ineligible and discarded if there was no good visibility

(for more details, see Rezende et al., 2003).

It was derived theoretical growth parameters by fitting the direct lengths-at-age to the

von Bertalanffy (1938) growth equation:

where Lt is the length at age t, L? is the asymptotic length, k is the growth coefficient

1998; Santa Maria &amp;amp; Chavez, 1999; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Burton, 2002;
Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002). 2 (Rezende et al., 2003)

IV.II.1.1.2 Growth parameters based on back-calculated lengths-at-age

Back-calculation lengths-at-age was the second source of data for the determination of

the growth parameters. This technique is widely used to obtain growth curves, to estimate



Chapter 4

57

length-at-age of individuals that are rarely observed, to compare growth differences amongst

populations or sexes of the same species and even to illustrate gear selectivity (Francis, 1990).

The purpose of back-calculation is to estimate body lengths from scale or otoliths

measurements. The details of the estimation of the back-calculated lengths-at-age are

described in Rezende and Ferreira (2003). For the analysis of Lutjanus vivanus, due to the

lack of juveniles in our samples, it was only used the growth parameters derived from back-

calculated lengths-at-age.

It was derived theoretical growth parameters by fitting the back-calculated lengths-at-

age to the von Bertalanffy (1938) growth equation.

IV.II.1.1.3 Growth parameters based on the method of Jones (1984)

An empirical relationship based on a procedure suggested by Jones (1984) is also

applied for the determination of the growth parameters. It is based on choosing a value of L? 

equal or ‘little greater’ (Jones, 1990) than the maximum individual sampled. Afterwards it is

chosen a value of K ‘compatible’ to the estimated L?  using the method of Ford and Walford

described below:

k=ln[(L? - Lt)/(L?-Lt+1)]

In this case, the animal grows from Lt to Lt+1 within one year. This may hamper the

use of this method since the length interval for Lutjanus species to grow within one year

greatly varies and, growth parameters obtained based on this approach is questionable.

IV.II.1.2. Natural mortality (M)

Methods for calculating natural mortality are based on empirical relationships between

M and other biological and environmental parameters, but because they are less demanding

on specific data, they are unlikely to produce good estimates for a particular stock (Gulland,

1989). In that case, a good knowledge of the life history of the species and of the fisheries in

question helps the choice of a suitable estimate, and should be considered of maximum

importance (Reis, 1992). For Lutjanids species, M reported in literature varies from 0.104 to

0.49 (Newman &amp;amp; Williams, 1996; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Newman, 2001;

Burton, 2002; Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002). However, most of the estimates for Lutjanus species

rely up to the value of 0.23.

A number of traditional empirical models estimates the natural mortality (M)

considering the water temperature and growth parameters or the age at first maturity (Rikhter

&amp;amp; Evanov, 1976; Pauly, 1980a). Recently Ault et al. (1998) developed a method, which



Chapter 4

58

allows application of a convenient and consistent method to normalise the annual

instantaneous natural mortality rate M to life span. This method has been applied for coral

reef fish stocks. Initially it is assumed that St? , the fraction of the initial cohort numbers

surviving from recruitment tr to the maximum age, can be expressed as:

S (t?) = e –M(t?- tr)

Where t?  is the maximum age registered.

Then, the authors assume an unexploited equilibrium, by setting the probability of

survivorship of recruits to the maximum age to be 5% (i.e. S (t?) = 0.05), and letting tr be

equal to 0. The equation above was rearranged in order to provide and estimate of M as

following:

M=-ln(St?)/t? 

It was also calculated M based on the method described by Rikter &amp;amp; Evanoff (Rikhter &amp;amp;

Evanov, 1976) and Pauly (1980a). Depending on the species and method applied, M varied

from 0.1 to 0.3. This range will be used for the sensitivity test, which investigates the effects

of different values of natural mortality on the estimates of stock size and fishery mortality.

IV.II.2. Length at first capture (L50)

The length at first capture was obtained based on the catch curve. When using a

linearised catch curve to estimate mortality it is usually necessary to discard the left hand side

of the curve because juvenile fish are not fully exploited. A conceptually simple way to

estimate how many fish are missing at each age is to extrapolate on the straight line from

which the total mortality coefficient Z is estimated, in order to find the number of juveniles

there ‘ ought to be’. The differences between the ‘ expected numbers´of individuals that

ought to be and the actual numbers of individuals caught should give the ogive resulting from

the combined effect of recruitment and mesh selection, and the L50 is obtained (Sparre &amp;amp;

Venema, 1998).

IV.II.3. Stock assessment models

IV.II.3.1. Length-cohort analysis and VPA

The length cohort analysis and VPA uses commercial catch data to calculate stock sizes

and mortality rates of age based or length-based cohorts. It does not by itself indicate how

many individuals can be caught to meet a given objective, nor does it predict the future. If



Chapter 4

59

explains the past (Jennings et al., 2001). This method uses backwards algorithms, which are,

based on catches, used for the estimation of the stock size. VPA calculates the size of the

stock based on past catches and the number of individuals alive in each cohort for each past

year. The relationship is simple and, the number of individuals alive in the beginning of next

year will be equal to the number of individuals alive of the current year minus the annual

catches and the rate removed by the natural mortality of the referred year (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema,

1998). The output of such methods is the fishing mortality and the number of individuals

alive for each year for the whole period.

However, in a tropical fishery it is often available information concerning the catch-at-

age for a short period (1 year or 2). In this situation, it could be used the VPA with pseudo-

cohort. There is also a method proposed by Jones (1984) (Length Cohort Analysis) which

converts lengths to age based on the growth parameters of von Bertalanffy (L?, k, t0), in case

of the absence of information on catch-at-age. The methods based on pseudo-cohort is based

on the assumption of a constant parameter system, i.e. when we are working with data from

one year assuming that these resemble those of a cohort during its entire life, which means

that recruitment and total mortality (Z = F+M) remains constant every year. It is evident that

this assumption of constant parameter system is rarely fulfilled in real life. However, ‘it often

happens that only by making such assumptions we are able to carry out an analysis of

available data, and it is better to do a crude analysis than none at all’ (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema,

1998).

However, it is also possible to follow the fate of a single age group, or cohort, over

successive time intervals. This is applied in this study as the VPA for real cohorts.

Hence, for this study, the current status of the 5 species of Lutjanus is assessed

exploring three possibilities of methods as described in the scenarios below:

Scenario 1 The length cohort analysis based on the model proposed by Jones (1984). The

input data necessary for the application of the model are: the total caught number-

at-size, terminal E (F/Z) (determined interactively), an assumption of Natural

Mortality M and three set of growth parameters (L?, k, t0). The set of growth

parameters used as input were based on three scenarios: Scenario 1a - growth

parameters based on direct readings of the otoliths; Scenario 1b - growth

parameters based on back-calculated lengths-at-age and Scenario 1c - growth

parameter based on the method proposed by Jones (1984) with L?   based on

maximum size and compatible k.



Chapter 4

60

Scenario 2 Age-based Virtual Population analysis (VPA) (Gulland, 1965) using pseudo

cohorts, assuming equilibrium conditions where nor the effort neither the

catchability has changed over the whole studied period. The input data for this

model is the total caught numbers-at-age (average length composition for 1996-

2000) and an assumption of natural mortality.

Scenario 3 Age-based VPA using the real cohorts during the studied period (1996-2000). The

input data for this model is the total caught numbers-at-age by year and an

assumption of natural mortality.

For each of the scenarios used for the assessment of the Lutjanus species, it was

investigated the effects of different values of natural mortality on the estimates of stock size

and fishery mortality. This sensitivity tests were applied analysing the effect of the different

assumed values of natural mortality (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and the values obtained based on the method

of Ault et al. (1998)) in the estimates of fishing mortality and stock size. When the results of

the analysis were considered as not reliable (considering the knowledge of the current status

of exploitation for the species -, fishing mortality should not be much lower than the natural

mortality - see results and Chapter 1), I did not proceed with the sensitivity test.

For each scenario, the output of the length cohort analysis and VPA were used as input

for the application of the predictive model of Thompson and Bell which projects yields at

different levels of fishing mortality.

IV.II.3.2. Catch curve

For L. vivanus it is not available estimates of total landed catches and the value of total

mortality Z was obtained based on the catch curve, which may be used in situations where

only total sampled catch is obtainable. Graphing the natural logarithms of numbers surviving

over successive years will therefore produce a straight line relationship referred to as a catch

curve (Beverton &amp;amp; Holt, 1957; Ricker, 1975).

IV.II.4. Predictive models

IV.II.4.1. The predictive model of Thompson and Bell

Future yields and stock biomass levels can be predicted by means of mathematical

models, which are similar to the ones behind VPA and the cohort analysis. The mathematical

formulas for VPA and cohort analysis, that analyse the history of the fishery, can be

transformed in such way that the knowledge of the past can be used to predict the future

yields and biomass at different levels of fishing effort (or fishery mortality) (Sparre &amp;amp;

Venema, 1998).

The main input of this model is the ‘reference F-at-age’ (or length)-array, an array of F-

values per age (or length) group which is obtained from the analysis of historical data, VPA or

cohort analysis. Another input parameters are the number of recruits (also may be obtained

from VPA or cohort analysis) and the weight-at-age (or length) array, i.e. the weights of

individual fish per age (length) group). The output of the model is a succession of predictions

of the catch in numbers, the yield, the mean biomass, all per age (length) group related to the

values of F for each group. New values of F can be obtained by multiplying the reference F-

array as a whole by a certain factor usually called X (the so-called Factor X) (Sparre &amp;amp;

Venema, 1998).

In this study, each set of growth parameters and estimates of natural mortalities

determined different scenarios of projection of yield per factor. For each scenario, estimates

of the biological reference points were obtained. It was calculated Fmax (value of fishing

mortality F where the yield is maximum) or Emax (value of exploitation rate E (F/Z) where

the yield is maximum) and the more conservative biological reference as F0.1 (value of F

where the instantaneous rate of variation of the yield is equal to 10% of the maximum rate)

(Gulland &amp;amp; Boerema, 1973; Cadima, 2000). The use of F0.1 as a reference point, although is

regarded as more conservative, has the advantage of being applicable to species for which

there is no evident maximum in the yield per recruit vs. F curve (Caddy &amp;amp; Mahon, 1995).

This situation has been noted for some species in this study (see results).

IV.II.4.2. Relative yield per recruit of Beverton and Holt

To analyse the current state of the species L. vivanus, the model yield per recruit

proposed by Beverton and Holt (1956; 1957), which do not need the estimates of total catch,

was used.

The Beverton and Holt (1956; 1957) model estimates the potential yield of the stock in

function of the fishery mortality and the length of first capture, using as input the growth

parameters and an estimate of natural mortality. The fundamental yield-per-recruit model

assumes a steady sate, i.e. that recruitment is constant, and hence the age structure of the

population is the same as we would see if we followed a single cohort through time(Jennings

et al., 2001). Two outputs may be obtained considering that (1) all fish belonging to a given

cohort recruit to the fishing grounds at the same time: ‘knife-edge recruitment’ or (2) fish of a

given cohort recruit gradually following a smooth function (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998). The

knife-edge selection should be considered a hypothetical model since it will never describe a

real situation. Departure from knife-edge selection has a profound impact on yield-per-recruit

estimation and one should use model incorporating realistic selection ogives (Gayanilo Jr. et

al., 1996).

This model can be regarded as a special application of the Thompson and Bell model,

being, however, simpler and requiring less calculation. This model replaces the Thompson

and Bell model in situations where VPA and Cohort analysis cannot be applied. This model

uses as input the growth parameters and an estimate of natural mortality. The biological

reference points Fmax and F0.1 were determined.

A flowchart illustrating the methods applied in this chapter is shown in Fig. IV.1.

IV.III. Results

IV.III.1. Lutjanus analis, mutton snapper

The length at first capture (L50) for L. analis is equivalent to 36.4 cm FL which is larger

than the length at first maturity given to the species in Northeast Brazil (28 cm FL) (Ferreira

et al., 2004a).

The estimates of fishery mortality varied for L. analis from 0.008 to 0.909 depending on

the scenario considered (Table IV.2). The estimates of biomass varied greatly from 1568 to

90.720 tonnes with an exploitation rate (E) varying between 0.037 and 0.901 in function of

the scenario considered (Table IV.2). Considering the predictive model of Thompson and

Bell, it was reported an optimum exploitation rate for a maximum yield (Emax) varying from

0.63 to 0.84 depending on the natural mortality and methods applied (Table IV.2).

Amongst all scenarios tested only scenarios 1c (Length cohort Analysis using as input

the growth parameters based on the method of Jones (1984)) and 3 (Age-based VPA using

real cohorts) with values of natural mortality up to 0.2 reached maximum values for the

estimates of the optimum exploitation rate for the maximum yield (Emax) (Fig. IV.2). When

the yield curve (based on the predictive model of Thompson and Bell) does not reach a

maximum (curve has an asymptotic format), the value of Emax is not discernible and this

biological reference point is not reliable for use.

Results of estimates of biomass and exploitation rates (F/Z) for different values of M

were compared within the scenarios (excluding the scenarios where fishing mortality was

lower than the expected pattern, considering the knowledge of the current exploitation of the

species; see Chapter 1 for more explanations of the current exploitation of Lutjanus species).

In Northeast Brazil, the exploitation of L. analis is reported for the region since 1978 and,

currently around 600 tonnes is landed annually. Considering the current level of exploitation

of this species, it is not expected that the fishing mortality F would be greatly lower to M.

Moreover, when F is expected to be relatively small, then the reliability of estimates derived

from models relying on catches may be questionable. If M is small compared to F it may not

matter so much if M is not well estimated (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998).

For scenarios 1c and 3 (M = 0.1 and 0.2) (scenarios which the test of sensibility test was

applied, Table IV.2), given all values of M, exploitation rates decrease with an increase in the

assumed natural mortality.

Chapter 4

67

Due to all the limitations of the methods proposed by Jones (Length cohort analysis)

and VPA using pseudo-cohorts (described in the introduction and discussion), it was

considered that the analysis which uses the age-based VPA with real cohort (Scenario 3) is the

most recommendable to evaluate the current status of the stock. It is also considered that the

best choice of the value of M (used as input for the analysis) is the obtained based on the

formulae of Ault et al. (1998), which has been designated as the most appropriate for the

assessment of reef fish stocks. For a natural mortality M =0.1 (obtained according to the

formulae of Ault et al. (1998), the maximum rate of exploitation for the maintenance of the

sustainability of the stock of L. analis in the Northeast coast of Brazil was 0.63 (Fig. IV.3).

Considering the current exploitation rate of L. analis (Ecurrent = 0.68), estimated as 20%

greater than the estimated Emax, it could be inferred that L. analis, in Northeast Brazil is

currently over-exploited. The biological reference F0.1 was estimated as 0.022 (90% inferior

than the Fcurrent).

Chapter 4

70

As for L. analis, maximum yield was reached for scenario 1c (with M of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3

and 0.12) and for scenario 3 with mortality M= 0.1 and 0.12 (Fig. IV.4). The maximum

exploitation rates (Emax) were respectively 0.8, 0.66, 0.54 and 0. 77 (Table IV.3).

As for L. analis, it was also considered that the analysis which uses the real cohort is the

most recommendable to evaluate the current status of the stock in Northeast Brazil.

Considering the natural mortality M = 0.12 (obtained according to the formulae of Ault et al.

(1998), I reported, for L. jocu the optimum exploitation equal to 0.668 (Table IV.3). Given

that the current exploitation rate for the species is equivalent to the optimum rate for

maximum yields (Ecurrent = 0.668), we consider the stock of L. jocu, in Northeast Brazil is

fully exploited (Fig. IV.5). Given that the reference point F0.1 as 0.036 is 85% inferior to the

Fcurrent, it is evident the need for a drastic reduction of the fishery mortality (see restrictions on

the discussion).

IV.III.3. Lutjanus chrysurus, yellowtail snapper

The length at first capture for L. chrysurus is 31.25 cm FL which is larger than the

length at first maturity obtained for the species in Northeast Brazil (21.2 cm FL) (Ferreira et

al., 2004b).

The estimates of fishery mortality varied for L. chrysurus from 0.003 to 0.591depending

on the scenario considered (Table IV.4). The estimates of biomass varied greatly from 4420 to

555770 tonnes with a current exploitation rate varying between 0.015 and 0.855 in function of

the scenario considered (Table IV.4).

Chapter 4

73

Maximum yield was not very discernible for any scenario but it did reach a maximum

value for scenario 1c (with M of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.17) and for scenario 3 with mortality M=

0.1 (Fig. IV.6, Table IV.4).

For fish species, which show a very low growth, the yield per recruit curve has a wide

flat top. In that case, the use of F0.1 (or E0.1) has the very useful practical advantages of

allowing a more precise target than Fmax (or Emax) (Jennings et al., 2001). Considering the

natural mortality as M = 0.17 (obtained according to the formulae of Ault et al. (1998), the

reference point F0.1 is 0.055 is 80% inferior to the Fcurrent.

IV.III.4. Lutjanus synagris, lane snapper

The length at first capture for L. synagris is 19.4 cm FL which is equivalent to the

length at first maturity obtained for the species in Northeast Brazil (18 cm FL) (Ferreira et al.,

2004d). The estimates of fishery mortality varied from 0.056 to 2.980 depending on the

scenario considered (Table IV.5). The estimates of biomass varied greatly from 425 to 146759

tonnes with an exploitation rate varying between 0.040 and 0.968 in function of the scenario

considered (Table IV.5).

As for L. chrysurus, maximum yield was not very discernible for any scenario but it did

reach a maximum value for scenario 1c (with M of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.14) and for scenario 3

with mortality M= 0.1 (Fig. IV.7). The maximum exploitation rates (Emax) were respectively

0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.89 and 0.63 (Table IV.5). In that case, also the use of F.0.1 (or E0.1) was

recommended and considering the natural mortality as M = 0.14 (obtained according to the

formulae of Ault et al. (1998), the reference point F0.1 was 0,029, 85% inferior than Fcurrent. If

this conservative reference point is considered, the species will be considered as

overexploited.

The yield per recruit model reported a maximum exploitation rate for maximum yield as

E = 0.80 if considered the method of ‘knife-edge’ and 0.50 if considered the ´ selection ogive´

method (Fig. IV.8). The current exploitation rate obtained for the Northeast Brazil was of

E=0.7 and the stock is regarded as fully exploited.

IV.IV. Discussion

IV.IV.1. The assessment of Lutjanus species using traditional approaches

In this study, many traditional approaches, which have been used for tropical fisheries,

were tested. However, due to the assumptions of those models (see later section), they are

limited and results should be taken with caution.

The extended longevity and low rates of natural mortalities for most of the snappers

indicate that these species are unlikely to sustain high harvest rates of exploitation (Newman

&amp;amp; Dunk, 2002) and, for most species commercially exploited, they are, currently, regarded as

over-exploited. For L. sebae, a long-lived species (longevity of up 35 years), the optimum

fishing mortality was estimated as 0.05-0.0611 and, considering the current exploitation (F =

0.120-0,27), only approximately 6% of the available stock should be harvested in a

sustainable manner (Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002). For the red snapper, L. malabaricus (longevity

of 31 years) of Australia, the biological reference point used, Flimit is 0.0769 which indicates

that approximately 7% of the available stock can be harvest on an annual basis (Newman &amp;amp;

Dunk, 2002). For the mutton snapper L. analis and for the grey snapper L. griseus of Florida,

total mortality obtained was 0.49 and 0.34 – 0.95 respectively, but no biological reference

limit was calculated (Burton, 2001; Burton, 2002). For L. synagris in Puerto Rico, the

Beverton and Holt yield per recruit model indicated that the current fishery harvest

approximately 91% of the potential yield (Acosta &amp;amp; Appeldoorn, 1992). L. peru have been

also regarded as over-exploited in the coast of Mexico (Santa Maria &amp;amp; Chavez, 1999).

In this study, according to the stock assessment models applied, all the species under

investigation are also regarded as fully or over-exploited depending on the biological

reference limit considered. For some studied species, the concept of the optimum level of

fishing mortality (Fmax) which results in the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is not viable

by the management point of view since there is no clear maximum value in the yield per

recruit curve for these species. As alternative, some authors have suggested the biological

reference point F0.1 (proposed by Gulland and Boerema (1973). This reference point does not

require a maximum value and it is referred as the mortality rate in the point of the yield curve

located where the slope is 10% of the maximum slope (Gulland &amp;amp; Boerema, 1973; Caddy &amp;amp;

Mahon, 1995; Cadima, 2000). According to Caddy and Mahon (1995) the use of F0.1, although

arbitrary, is a management measure based on a bio-economic criteria, as most of the managers



Chapter 4

77

would not see an economic return in an increase of the effort (and hence fishing mortality) for

an increase of the yield level inferior to 10%.

For L. chrysurus and L. synagris, since the yield curve (F x yield) was regarded as

asymptotic and no maximum value was observed. This would mean that effort can be

increased considerably without any decrease of yield. Obviously this scenario does not

represent the reality.. Only the F0.1 can be used as a sensible biological reference point. For

all species, the results considering F0.1 as the biological reference point indicated an imminent

need for a drastic reduction of the fishing mortality. This reference point is more conservative

than Fmax, which also illustrated the intensive status of exploitation for Lujanus species in

Northeast Brazil. The low value of the reference limit F0.1 has been found for other Lutjanus

species (Newman et al., 2000). However, if considered the life history of the lutjanids, it

seems obvious that these species are very vulnerable, which led, recently, the American

Fisheries Society, to recommend that these stock should be exploited with fishing mortalities

similar to the natural mortality (Coleman et al., 2000).

IV.IV.2. The limitation of the models applied

IV.IV.2.1. Models based on length based methods

Models based on length frequency distributions are extremely sensitive to the choice of

the growth parameters. In this study, it could be observed a wide variation of the estimates of

the fishing mortality by length class, depending on the choice of the growth parameters. The

variation of the mortality estimates depending on the method applied for the determination of

the growth parameters has been reported by Newman et al. (2000). Consequently, the

biological reference points calculated also varied according.

The length cohort analysis (Jones, 1984) is a simplified approximation of the Virtual

Population Analysis (VPA), which uses pseudo-cohorts instead of real cohorts. Jones (1987;

1990) alerts that the length cohort analysis using the growth parameters of Von Bertalanffy

which converts length to age based on the inverse equation of Von Bertalanffy results in

values of F significantly lower than those obtained by VPA using the catch-at-age and real

cohorts. However, it is possible to apply the model of Jones to a real cohort but this implies in

the knowledge of the age of individuals (in length based methods the time that a group of fish

that reach a following length class in not the same for all classes). In this case, the assumption

of steady state disappears and the annual data could be analysed separately allowing the

identification of the recruitment and mortalities patterns. If annual data is to be analysed



Chapter 4

78

separately with the length frequency distribution, fish should be referred by age groups with

fixed intervals, which is often 1 year. For the application of such approach, catches which

length classes belonging to the same age class are grouped and it is obtained the catch-at-age

matrix (Cadima, 2000). This approach is called slicing technique. However, it also shows

weakness since the true age of the fish is not known (age is based on the inverse equation of

Von Bertalanffy) and an arbitrary value of t0 is used. The differences between ages ´ dt´ are

the values used, eliminating the t0.

Another alternative suggested by Jones (1984), is to use growth parameters obtained

through an ´ empirical´ procedure based on a L?  slighty superior to the maximum age (Lmax)

and, the growth parameters K is compatible to the calculated L?.  ?he growth parameter K is

obtained according to the method of Ford and Walford (Ford, 1933; Walford, 1946).

However, considering that is based on fictitious parameters, the method is subjected to

criticisms.

Even if the slicing technique or the determination of the growth parameters empirically

may help the application of the length cohort analysis, it has been shown above the limitations

and restrictions of those methods.

IV.IV.2.2. Virtual Population Analysis using ages

IV.IV.2.2.1 Using pseudo-cohorts

Although the cohort analysis by age using pseudo-cohort does not convert length on age

using the inverse equation of von Bertalanffy (as the method proposed by Jones), this method

may be also inadequate due to the limitation of the use of steady state over the study period.

This assumes that rates of recruitment and mortality are constant during the entire life of the

species studied. This assumption, however, is rarely fulfilled in real life. Thus, real cohort

VPA should be preferred when time series is available (even short ones).

IV.IV.2.2.2 Real cohorts

Virtual Population Analyses (VPA) was used with real cohorts for the 5 years period.

However, the short time series available is possibly a weakness as the studied species are long

lived (from 18 to 29 years respectively for L. chrysurus and L. analis (Rezende &amp;amp; Ferreira, in

press). This may affect the accuracy of the results obtained based on this analysis as a data

series of 5 years may not comprise of the contrasts needed for the best use of the models. The

concept ‘backwards’ of VPA makes the arbitrary choose of the terminal F important for the



Chapter 4

79

all the estimated F by age-classes. The longer is the temporal series the less important will be

the weight of the terminal F choice. Also, VPA tends to estimate erroneously the fishing

mortality when the catchability increases while the stock is under decline. In this case, the

assumption that the terminal F did not alter for the last years is a systematic underestimation

of the stock size, which may lead the decision makers to believe that the stock is not declining

as it is (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). More sophisticated models as catch at age models, which

includes the estimate of catchability, terminal F and calculation of confidence intervals for

parameter estimates may be used (see Deriso et al., 1985).

Considering that, the precautionary approach developed at the 1992 United Nations

Conference on Environment and Development states that ‘where there are threats of serious or

irreparable damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for

postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation’. In such a situation,

fishery managers can either make use of the available information or wait for an improved

infrastructure, sampling and data collection. The latter option is risky as fish stocks may be

depleted by the time accurate data become available (Reis, 1992). In that case, considering the

traditional approaches in stock assessment, VPA has shown to be the most stable model and

the one, which most represents the current status of the reef fish in Northeast Brazil.

IV.IV.2.3. Consequences of a erroneous choice of M

Various authors proposed methods for the estimation of M based on empirical formulae,

some based on doughty hypothesis as the supposition that tropical fishes are less long lived,

fast growing and show higher natural mortality (Pauly, 1980a; Hoening, 1983). The incorrect

use of the mortality rate has a great impact over the reconstruction of the stock size specially

when values of F are relatively near or inferior to the estimates of M. If the estimates of M are

higher than the real values, the cohort size will be over-estimated and consequently the

estimates of fishing mortality will be under-estimated and vice versa.

In this study, simulations carried out supported the argument already well described in

the literature that estimates can be extremely sensitive to the natural mortality used as input.

Newman et al. (2000) also noted this sensitivity and stated that the over-estimation of M

resulted in an underestimate of actual yield-per-recruit for the red snappers L. erythropterus,

L. malabaricus and L. sebae.

It is well reported that the instantaneous rate of natural mortality varied greatly

depending on the method considered. For the mutton snapper in the coast of Florida, M varied

from 0.28 (Hoenig (1983)formulae) to 0.39 (Pauly, 1980a, formulae) (Burton, 2002). For



Chapter 4

80

Lutjanus malabaricus of Australia, M varied from 0.115 to 0.134 (Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002).

For L. sebae of north-western Australia, estimates of M also varied form 0.10 to 0.12

(Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002). In this study, the estimates of natural mortality also varied greatly

but, I consider that the best method is the one which deals with data of the stock itself and that

was developed for reef fishes, as the method proposed by Ault et al. (1998) that take into

account the maximum age registered and was applied to Florida reef fishes.

Even when estimates of M are obtained experimentally (which rarely happens with fish

stocks poorly known), an additional assumption is that M is constant. Unfortunately, it is

known that natural mortality varies according to a complex of ecological variables as

predation, habitat, availability of food, and also according the growth phase and the age of the

cohort.

IV.IV.2.4. Consequences of bias in the age-length keys

Virtual Population Analysis is fundamentally based on historical series of catch-at-age.

Hence, bias in the construction of this series will cause systematic effects on the output

estimates and influence all the stock assessment (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992).

The usual lack of older individuals in samples, which is due to the high fishing

mortality of those age-classes, may have hampered the results of some of the studied species,

mainly L. chrysurus and L. synagris. The absence of older individuals in samples will lead to

an under-estimation of the longevity and hence an over-estimation of M, which will lead to

consequences for the estimate of Emax. Also, the absence of older individuals greatly

interferes in the calculation of K and L?, which may results in an inadequate M/K

relationship, that is used as input for the models (as the Yield per Recruit model of Beverton

and Holt). The problem of the absence of the youngest individuals in samples (they are not

fully recruited to the fishery) can be overcame with the use of back-calculated lengths-at-age,

at least to what refers to the estimates of the growth parameters.

Although the problem of the absence of the oldest individuals have been refereed in the

beginning of data collection for the Program REVIZEE, numerous attempts of selectively

collect larger individuals was no guarantee of getting older individuals, since from a certain

age, the relationship age-length is not directly correlated to individuals that reach larger sizes

and ceases the growing process. Little is known on how the population is truncated by fishing

and it may be more relevant to take such uncertainty associated to their absence rather than

trying to find the rare individuals.



Chapter 4

81

Recent studies have shown that the Lutjanidae are much older than what was long

thought (Wilson &amp;amp; Nieland, 2001; Newman &amp;amp; Dunk, 2002) as it was found for other coral

reef fishes such as Acanthuridae and Scaridae (Choat &amp;amp; Axe, 1996; Choat et al., 1996). These

results were obtained partly due to the development of refined techniques, but mainly, to the

great sample size (more than 3000 individuals samples for both sexes). In the case of the

lutjanids of Northeast Brazil, future studies with larger sampled individuals may verify the

hypothesis of a higher longevity of the studied species.

IV.IV.2.5. Predictive Models yield per recruit model of Beverton and Holt

(1956; 1957)

In this study, predictive models as Thompson and Bell (1934) and the yield per recruit

Beverton and Holt (1956; 1957) were applied for the species under study. The output is

similar for both approaches (Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998).

Amongst others assumptions, the equilibrium condition implies a situation where all

fish alive have been subjected by the same exploitation pattern since they have been recruited.

Other assumptions are also considered: constant recruitment, date of birth uniform for all

individuals of the same cohort; fishing and natural mortality constant for all cohort since the

fishery recruitment and, a relationship length-weight with the parameter b=3. Although many

of those assumptions are not applicable, this technique allows a quantitative evaluation of the

exploited species when only few data are available (Goevender, 1995).

One of the inputs needed for the application of the yield per recruit model is the M/K

relationship. Beverton and Holt (1957) show that for most fish species this relationship varied

from 0.8 to 2.2. However, Gulland (1969) noted that this relationship is between 1 and 2 for

small pelagics and, between 2 and 3 for demersal fish. It is precisely for these groups of

species (small pelagic and demersals) that the model requires major cautions in relation to its

application and interpretation. Short-lived fish species show high natural mortality rates and

the yield per recruit curve is flat with maximum values not very discernible (Cergole, 1993).

In the other hand, fish with slow growth (high M/K rate), show an asymptotic curve and also a

maximum point is not visibly clear (Megrey, 1989). In this study, demersal fish specially L.

chrysurus and L. synagris showed flat toped curves of yield per recruit

Finally, considered all the methods tested within this chapter, VPA using true cohorts is

the most appropriated method for the estimation of the exploitation rates of the reef species in

Northeast Brazil, as this method is free of constraining assumptions (equilibrium conditions,

length converted to age). According to this method, the 5 species of Lutjanus analysed may be



Chapter 4

82

regarded as fully or over-exploited, depending on the biological reference point considered

(Fmax or the most conservative F0.1).

Main conclusions and thesis outlook

This chapter had the objective to describe the current status of L. analis, L. chrysurus, L.

jocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus of Northeast Brazil using traditional approaches. A number of

methods were performed as the yield per recruit model, the method described by Jones, VPA

and the predictive model of Thompson and Bell.

It was evident that length based models are not suitable for the studied species and may

not be adequate for many other reef species. Although it may also considered limited, due to

the short data series, VPA based on age and true cohorts has shown to be the most

appropriate, within the traditional methods applied, for the assessment of the reef fish in

Northeast Brazil.

For the next chapters, alternatives of evaluating the reef fishes are tested. In chapter 5,

considering the multispecies nature of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, the production

model will be applied for aggregated yields of individual species. This approach has been

already used in tropical fishery (Ralston and Polovina, 1982), where the huge diversity of

fishes is often related in fishers’ catches. The technological interaction will be also considered

within the biomass model, the Thompson and Bell predictive model and statistical catch-at-

age model. In Chapter 6, using as case study a system in South Pernambuco, we test the

indicator of abundance using fishery independent method as UVC (underwater visual

censuses) together with catch data.

Chapter V. Stock assessment of snappers based on a multispecies

and multi-fleet approach

V.I. Introduction

Fisheries biology has often focussed on the biological processes present within

exploited fish stocks. This narrow focus has led to management strategies that ignore the

dynamic response of fishermen to developments in the stock and to management regulations

itself (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). Fisheries science has recognised that fish species do not

exist in isolation from one another and that they are not harvested independently (Dann, 1987;

Magnusson, 1995; Jennings et al., 2001). The multi-species nature of combined fisheries

arises for biological, technical and economic reasons (Magnusson, 1995).

Considering the interactions within the multi-species nature of fisheries, interactions

arising from technical concerns are more realistically identified and can actually be applied

in stock assessment and management Technical interactions arise through the incidental

catch of non-target species (by-catch) in targeted fisheries or by the exploitation of a target

group of species by the same gear and, mainly by the co-existence of fleets exploiting the

same resource and/or the same fishing grounds.

Considering the technical interactions which deal with the simultaneous catch of groups

of species, models of the joint capture of species that do not interact biologically (conversely

to trophic interactions i.e. multispecies virtual population analysis, MSVPA) have been

developed by Murawski (1984). Biomass dynamic models for aggregate species group were

developed for jointly caught species (Ralston &amp;amp; Polovina, 1982). Models of this type can be

appropriate for both interacting and non-interacting species (Hollowed et al., 2000). The

advantage of such approaches is that as there is no specific target species (a group of species

instead), each species will have a sustainable yield and the total sustainable yield from this

fishery is the sum of those from all species (Anderson, 1986). This combination of yield was

designated by Eide and Flaaten (1998) as the maximum sustainable frontier (MSF) and it is

the long run limit to what can be harvested from all the species. According to these authors

‘the harvesting of less than a combination of yields on the MSF does not necessarily secure a

sustainable harvest’.

Considering the technical interactions arising by the co-existence of fleets exploiting the

same resource, it is well reported that most tropical fisheries support a large number of gears



Chapter 5

84

whose biological impact vary. Models for the management of single species fished by one

type of gear may be inadequate to apply to most tropical fisheries and to predict changes at

the assemblage level. These technical interactions caused by different fishing gears exploiting

the same resource are simple to study and useful results can be obtained (Pikitch, 1988).

Several species are caught by the same type of gear and one cannot target effort efficiently on

a species by species basis.

In the Northeast reef fishery, both types of technical interactions are reported. Reef

species are caught by different fleets, which exploit the stocks in distinctive ways (Chapters 2

and 3). Effort relying on a specific species may be re-allocated by gear aiming the species

sustainability. The exploitation would hence be gear (or fleet) specific and the effect of the

different gears on the stock structure should be considered. Also, for all gears and fleets that

exploit the reef species in Northeast Brazil, a group rather than individual species is caught by

the same gear/fleet.

The ultimate motivation of all fisheries models, whether single- or multispecies, is (1) to

describe the fisheries patterns, and (2) to understand and inform decision-makers of the

consequences of possible fishing activities. In has been reported in the last years a growth in

the number and type of multispecies models incorporating technical interactions (Pascoe,

2000; Ulrich et al., 2001; Lucena et al., 2002; Ulrich et al., 2002). Within these approaches,

every kind of gear seems to have some degree of size/age selectivity and unequal catchability

as members of a cohort will have differential vulnerability to the fleet depending on fish size

or other attribute (as bathymetric distribution for example). The multi-fleet exploitation is

considered in such approaches. Although these models are in general quite advanced, tropical

fishery models tend to be rather simple. The main limitation is the amount and the quality of

data (Appeldoorn, 1996). It is recommended a comparison of results obtained by various

modelling techniques (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992).

This chapter has the objective of evaluating the exploitation of the snappers fishery in

Northeast Brazil using a multi-fleet and multi-species approach. Also, considering the multi-

species nature of the reef fishery, I analyse the different outputs models (considering both

types of technical interactions), discussing limitations and advantages of each one. We

compare the more sophisticated approaches with the traditional techniques familiar to the

fishery biologists.



Chapter 5

85

V.II. Method

Three models with different need of data and perspectives were used: (a) the Thompson

and Bell predictive model (Thompson &amp;amp; Bell, 1934; Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998) including the

effect of different fleets exploiting the same resource, (b) the dynamic biomass model with

aggregate species (Ralston &amp;amp; Polovina, 1982), and finally (c) the multi-fleet catch-at-age

model (Fournier, 1996). Data was obtained through the Project REVIZEE where fish of 5

Lujanus species (L. analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L. synagris and L. vivanus) were measured

in 5 states of the northeast Brazil (see Chapter 2 for more details).

V.II.1. Thompson and Bell’s predictive model

This model (Thompson &amp;amp; Bell, 1934) was used to predict the effect of changes in the

fishing pattern considering the multi-fleet exploitation of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil

(see Chapter 4). The reef species in the studied area are exploited by 4 different fleets:

motorised boats (BOM), sailing boats (BOV), ‘jangadas’ (JAN), ‘paquetes’ (PQT) (see

Chapter 2 for details). The fleet ‘BOT’ (mixed propulsion boats) are not considered in this

Chapter because total catch is not reported in the official statistics (Estatpesca, 2000). Within

this approach, the total fishing mortality is analysed considering the 4 different types of

exploitation caused by different fleets (based on the proportions of the numbers of fish caught

by each fleet).

The fishing mortality exerted by one fleet i is:

Fi = Ftotal*Ci/Ctotal (5.1)

where Ftotal is the total fishing mortality, Ci the catch of the fleet i and Ctotal is the

summed catch of all fleets.

Thus, yields are easily separated into fleet components using the exponential decay

model and the catch equation (see Chapter 4 for details Sparre &amp;amp; Venema, 1998):

Nt = Nt+1*exp
-Z (exponential decay) (5.2)

C = N* F/Z *( exp – Z - 1) (catch equation) (5.3)

Where t is the year of the analysis, analysis, N is the number of individuals and Z is the

total mortality.

Simulation within this approach will be carried out varying or keeping constant the

factor X for each fleet. This will lead to the assessment of the effect of regulatory measures

for each fleet component as long as effort is proportional to fishing mortality F.



Chapter 5

86

Initially, the total yield was decomposed by fleet and the same factors, XBOM = XBOV =

XPQT = Xjan are applied to the F-values for each fleet. This corresponds to a situation where

the fishery mortality for each fleet is always in the same proportion of the total fishing

mortality. Four other scenarios were analysed and corresponded to a change in fishery

mortality for one fleet while the others are assumed to remain at the same level. The scenarios

were chosen considering that the reef fishery dynamic is driven by the different fleet category

exploiting the resources (see Chapter 2), i.e., fleets which operate mostly in shallower waters

(as ‘paquete’, ‘jangada’) exploit mainly the coastal resources whilst boats categories which

operates in deeper waters (sailing boat ‘BOV’, motorised boat ‘BOM’) are more related to the

species which is mainly distributed in deep waters..

The scenarios considered are listed below:

Scenario 1: Factors XBOM and XBOV are kept constant whereas XPQT and XJAN are allowed to

vary. This scenario explores the situation where fishery mortality is allowed to

vary for ‘paquetes’ PQT and ‘jangadas’ JAN fisheries whereas the Boats

categories fishery mortalities (BOM and BOV) remain constant.

Scenario 2: Factors XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM and XBOV are allowed to

vary.

Scenario 3: Factors XBOV, XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM is allowed to vary.

Scenario 4: (a) Factors XBOV, XBOM and XJAN are kept constant whereas XPQT is allowed to

vary. This applies for L. chrysurus and L. synagris only as L. analis and L. jocu

did not present significant catch of ‘paquete’ PQT. (b) Factors XJAN and XBOM are

kept constant whereas XBOV is varied. This applies for L. analis and L. jocu only.

V.II.2. Biomass model

In some fisheries, the gear comes into contact with stocks of different species, and this

could often result in mixed catches due to the exploitation of technologically interdependent

species (Anderson, 1986). Fish resources in tropical area are mostly multispecies with

complex interactions and significant technological interrelationships in the harvesting process

are identified. The less demanding data model to account for the multispecies nature of a

fishery is the surplus production model (requires only data series of catch and effort for each

fishery) also referred as the biomass dynamic models (Jennings et al., 2001).



Chapter 5

87

Although biomass dynamic models (or production models) are commonly considered as

‘second-class’ model (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992), they often provide as good estimates of

management parameters as age-structured approaches. Three basic approaches have been

used: (1) the Schaefer model (1954), (2) the Pella &amp;amp; Tomlinson (Pella &amp;amp; Tomlinson, 1969)

model, and (3) the difference models (Walters &amp;amp; Hilborn, 1976). The simple Production

Model Schaefer Model adapted by Walters &amp;amp; Hilborn (1976) is derived from the dome-

shaped production model from a function that describes the growth rate of the population

according to the population size.

dB/dt = g(B) – Y (5.4)

Where B is the exploited population biomass at time t, g(B) is the surplus production as

a function of biomass, and Y is the yield of the fishery (in biomass). Fishery biologists

usually call this the Schaefer curve (Schaefer, 1954). Schaefer used it to develop a

mathematical basis for fitting surplus production models as the following:

g(b) = rB [1 – (B/Bmax)] (5.5)

where r is the intrinsic rate of population increase and the Bmax is the parameter which

corresponds to the unfished equilibrium stock size i.e., the carrying capacity (Schaefer,

1954). The methods of fitting these models rely on the assumption that an index of abundance

can be related to true abundance, as for example the CPUE:

CPUEt = qBt (5.6)

where B is the population biomass at time t and q is the catchability coefficient. The

development of such model requires information on specific catch and effort by gear.

These parameters are obtained through mathematical program such as ‘R’ (Ihaka &amp;amp;

Gentleman, 1996), which uses an automatic differentiation algorithm to estimate the

parameters of a non-linear function, based on an appropriate likelihood function.

Its is common practice to assume log-normal distributions for the errors because the

random processes are usually multiplicative and using a normal distribution could lead to

negative values of biomass or index of abundance (Hilborn &amp;amp; Mangel, 1997).

Considering the multispecies nature of fisheries, the production model can be applied

for aggregated yields of individual species. This approach is used in tropical fishery, where



Chapter 5

88

the large diversity of fishes is often related in fishers’ catches, which may contain 40 or more

species of economic importance (Jennings et al., 2001).

In this study, the equation 5.6 may become an aggregated CPUE (total capture/ total

effort) of the four snapper species studied (Lutjanus analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L. synagris).

L. vivanus is not considered in this chapter because this species is not reported by the official

statistics.. This method has been already applied by Ralston and Polovina on deep-sea hand-

line fishery in Hawaii (1982) and Koslow et al. reef fisheries of Jamaica and Belize (1994).

V.II.3. Multi-fleet catch-at-age model

In the proposed model, the exploitation will be fleet specific in order to consider the effect

of the different fleet on the stock structure of each species of Lutjanus analysed. The catch-at-

age model requires data on numbers-at-age and fishing effort by gear and by year and an

assumption about natural mortality.

The catch-at-age model was implemented in the program ‘AD Model Builder’ (Fournier,

1996). This program is a tool for the rapid development and implementation of non-linear

statistical models.

Given that i indicates the fishing year, j the index age class and f the fleet. Denote

catchability by gear (qf) and the selectivity coefficients by gear and age (Sg(j)).

The instantaneous fishing mortality rate by fleet, year and age , Ff(ij), is given by:

Ff(ij) = qf Eg(i) Sf(j) exp{?f(i)} (5.8)

where Ef(i) is the observed fishing effort by gear in year i and ?f(i) are deviations from

the expected relationship between the observed fishing effort and the resulting fishing

mortality in year i. Specifically, FPQT(ij), FJAN(ij), FBOV(ij) and FBOM(ij) denote the fishery

mortality by year and age for ‘paquete’ (PQT), ‘jangada’ (JAN), ‘sailing boats’ (BOV) and

‘motorised boats’ (BOM) exploitation, respectively. Total fishery mortality is then given by

the summation

Fij = FPQT(ij)+FJAN(ij) +FBOV(ij) +FBOM(ij) (5.9)

The model considered different fleets for each species. For L. analis and L. jocu,

‘jangada’ ‘sailing boats’ and motorised boats’ were relevant within the exploitation of these

species. For L. synagris and L. chrysurus, ‘paquete’ is also included in the analysis.

Furthermore, it is assumed that the natural mortality rate M is known (see Chapter 4 for the

natural mortality assumed for each Lutjanus species).

Total mortality (Z) is given by:



Chapter 5

89

Z(ij) = F(ij)+M (5.10)

An iterative estimation approach is used to estimate parameters such as the

catchability and selectivity. The iterative scheme implemented requires initial estimates of

population scale and relative population (denoted relpop) but these are subsequently updated

iteratively. For all years, estimates of recruits (at age 1) and numbers-at-age of all ages for the

first year of analysis are given by: log (initial population) = log (relpop) + log (population

scale)

N(i,1)= exp{log (initial population(i))} (5.11)

N(1,j)= exp{log (initial population(j))} (5.12)

Providing estimates of the initial population in year 1, N 1,1, N 1,2…, N1,j and the

knowledge of recruitment in each year (N1,1, N2,1,…) the seasonal exponential decay equation

yields:

N (i+1, j+1) = N (i ,j)Sv(i,j) (5.13)

where Sv(i,j), the survival by year and age class, is Sv(i,j) = exp
-Z

The biomass (B) at the beginning of the year (1st of January) is calculated through the

equation:

Bi = ?WjN(ij) (5.14)

Where Wj is the weight-at-age. (5.15)

The predicted catch by each fleet, year i and age j, (CPQT(i,j), CJAN(i,j) CBOV(i,j) and CBOM(i,j)

respectively) is given by:

),()()()()( ]1)[/( jiijvijijbomijbom NSZFC ?= (5.16)

),()()()()( ]1)[/( jiijvijijbovijbov NSZFC ?= (5.17)
A statistical model is constructed with two elements – catch and effort (c.f. Fournier,

1996) - from which parameter estimates are derived. The true catches CPQT(i,j), CJAN(i,j),

CBOV(i,j) and CBOM(i,j) each year for each fleet, are not known but estimates CoPQT(i,j), CoJAN(i,j),

CoBOV(i,j) and CoBOM(i,j) (observed catches – input catch-at-age matrix by fleet) respectively,

are recorded. )

Parameter estimation is based on maximum likelihood (L) with catches assumed to follow

The parameters of the model are estimated by maximising the sum of the independent log-

likelihoods log L1 + log L2 + log L3+ log L4. Note that only three log-likelihood (L1, L2 and

L3) were calculated for L. analis and L. jocu as the fleet PQT is not relevant within the

exploitation of these species.

V.III. Results

V.III.1. Thompson and Bell model simulations

V.III.1.1. Lutjanus analis, mutton snapper

Motorised boats (BOM) most influence the yield curve for L. analis as this fleet is

responsible by the major part of the species capture When fishing mortality for all fleets

similarly increase (factors X equals), the stock was found fully exploited by the BOM fishery

whereas BOV did not reach a maximum and JAN was found already over the maximum yield

(Fig. 1A). This is expected and already described by Sparre and Venema (1998), i.e., the

higher the effort of the most relevant fleet (in that case BOM) the smaller share is left for the

fleets which are responsible by the lower catches.

Considering the scenarios, when the ‘jangada’ (JAN) or the sailing boat (BOV) fishery

increased and the other remained constant, i.e. scenario 1 (factors XBOM and XBOV are kept

constant whereas XPQT and XJAN are varied) and 4 (factors XJAN and XBOM are kept constant

whereas XBOV is varied), the yield does not relevantly change within the range of the X-factor

considered (Fig. V.1B). This is mainly related to the fact that the fleets that are allowed to

vary within these scenarios (JAN and PQT) are not relevant within the exploitation of this

species (Fig. V.1B). The scenario 2 (factors XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM

and XBOV are varied) has shown a maximum yield at the current fishing mortality (F).

However, in the situation of scenario 3 (factors XBOV, XPQT and XJAN are kept constant

whereas XBOM is varied), the FMAX for BOM is a little beyond the current F (Fig. 1B).

V.III.1.2. Lutjanus jocu, dog snapper

The fishing mortality at maximum yield was 20 % superior to the current F (Fig. 2A). When

the fishery mortality is considered fleet specific (factors X equals for all fleets), the FMAX for

JAN and BOM were respectively 20% and 40% superior to the current F (X-factor = 1)

whereas the optimum F for BOV should be reduced by 10% (Fig. V.2A). Effect of changes in

the ‘jangadas’ JAN fishery while boat fishery (BOM, BOV) is kept at a constant level

(scenario 1) was relatively low which means that this fleet does not have great influence on

the yield for this species (Fig. 2B). Considering the scenarios where fishing mortality is

allowed to vary for both ‘boats’ fisheries (scenario 2), BOM only (scenario 3), and BOV only

(scenario 4), it is evident that only the BOM fishery had a significant impact on the total yield.

One may note that the dog snapper fishery is already at full exploitation and that efficient

management action should target the BOM fishery.

V.III.1.3. Lutjanus chrysurus, yellowtail snapper

The total yield did not find a maximum within the range of the factor X varying from 0

to 3 (Fig. 3). As reported in Chapter 4, maximum yield was not very discernible for any

scenario. This is probably related to fish species that show a very low growth rate (see

Chapter 4). For this reason, Fmax could be reached when factor X is out of the range

considered for this fishery. However, as the yield curve presents an asymptotic shape, the

increase in factor X from one (current F - X-factor = 1) does not relevantly changes the yield.

This would mean that, if exploitation reaches more than currently reported (X-factor = 1), the

species could be already considered as fully exploited. Considering the scenarios 1 to 4, no

maximum level of factor-X within the considered range was observed (Fig. 3b). The

combination of scenarios highlighted the influence of the BOM fleet within the exploitation of

the species.

V.III.1.4. Lutjanus synagris, lane snapper

Effect of change for each fleet showed that, considering any scenario, that the yield

curve, as for L. chrysurus is also similar to an asymptotic and no maximum value is easily

discernible (Fig. V.4). The Fmax could be reached when factor X is 2.4, but as for L.

chrysurus, given that the yield curve presents an asymptotic shape, the increase in factor X

from one (current F - X-factor = 1) does not relevantly changes the yield and this species

could be already considered as fully exploited. For L. synagris, it is evident that JAN and PQT

play an important role in the exploitation of this species.

V.III.2. Biomass model

A non-equilibrium Schaefer surplus production model was fitted to the data of the four

snappers (lumped together) reported in the reef fishery of Northern Brazil (L. analis, L.

chrysurus, L. synagris, L. jocu). These species were considered as relevant within the reef

fishery in northeast Brazil (see Chapter 2). The log likelihood was maximised to 4.6 and the

parameters r, q, K, ? and MSY is reported in Table V.1. The observed catch per unit of effort

(CPUE in number) was plotted along to the predicted CPUE and the biomass against the

studied period (Fig. V.5). The convergence to the best set of parameters, that minimise the

function (negative likelihood) was a critical task. The high uncertainty and a goodness-of-fit

surface with multiple peak interfered to the determination of a satisfactory set of parameter.

Because of a very short time series for this kind of model and the low contrast of the data

(ideally, alternate periods of low and high abundance of the fish stock is required, according

to Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992), several sets of parameters could maximise the likelihood. For

this reason, and considering the high uncertainty, further development of the model was not

continued.

V.III.3. Multi-fleet catch-at-age model

V.III.3.1. L. analis

The multi-fleet catch-at-age optimisation (maximisation the likelihood) algorithm for

this species did not converge to an optimum solution. Then, further development of this

model for this species was not continued.

V.III.3.2. L. jocu

During the period 1996-2001, BOM (motorised boats) was the dominant mode of

exploitation for L. jocu in Northeast Brazil (Fig V.6). Age-classes 4 to 10 were exposed to the

highest fishing mortality (Table V.2). Total fishing mortality (for the weighted mean F) was

0.05 (Fig 6) and E (exploitation rate; E=F/Z) was equal to 0.30, which means that 30% of the

mortality of this species is due to fisheries.

For 1996 - 2001, biomass decreased from around 70 to 10 thousand of tonnes over the

period (Fig. V.7). Catchability of BOV was similar to BOM and higher than for JAN (Table

V.2).

V.III.3.3. L. synagris

During the period 1996-2001, JAN and PQT were the dominant mode of exploitation

for L. synagris in Northeast Brazil (Fig V.8). Individuals older than 12 years were exposed to

the highest fishing mortality (Table V.3). Total fishing mortality (for mean weighted F) was

0.16 (Fig V.8) and E was equivalent to 0.53, which means that more than half of stock dies by

fisheries causes.

For the whole period, biomass slightly decreased from 13 to 12 thousands of tonnes.

(Fig. V.9). Catchability of PQT was highest than the reported for the others fleets (Table V.3).

During the period 1996-2001, JAN was the dominant mode of exploitation for the

youngest age classes (3 to 9) and BOV dominated from age 11 (Table V.4). Individuals all

age classes were exposed to similar fishing mortality (total mean weighted fishing mortality

was 0.14) (Fig. V.10) and E was equivalent to 0.45.

For the whole period, biomass decreased from around 12 to 3.3 thousand of tonnes (Fig.

V.IV. Discussion

According to Hilborn and Mangel (1997) four components that ecological scientist needs

to be taken into account are: (i) determination of hypotheses because science consists of

confronting different descriptions of how the studied system might work (ii) getting ‘good’

data, good means informative in the context of a particular view of the system (iii) goodness

of fit which measure how well the description of the system by the model fits the observations

(iiii) numerical procedure that help the investigator to rapidly and efficiently find the best fit

(explore the goodness of fit). In fishery science and particularly in tropical fishery,

management needs to have a good knowledge of the population dynamics of the exploited

fish stock focusing on how the fish stocks have responded to exploitation, and also what may

be the future response to fishing pressure to this stock. The broad issue of fishing activity

simultaneously involves the production and the conservation at sustainable levels for futures

catches, as well as the social considerations that arise specially when various fishers

categories are involved in the harvest. All fishery models are approximations, and

consequently many analysts prefer using more than one model to analyse a stock, as does,

e.g., the ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna)

(Prager, 2003). Indeed, each model provides, from its particular perspective, an imperfect

view of the reality (Prager, 2003). Within this chapter, three different models were applied to

data obtained from the Northern Brazilian fishery in order to get more perception of the

current status of the snappers caught by the reef fishery in Northeast fishery

The results of Thompson and Bell model suggest that some fleet components already

reached or exceed their optimum fishing mortality level (see Chapter 4). The multi-fleet

characteristic of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil is clear when the fishery mortality is

analysed by fleet. The discrimination by fleet followed the same pattern observed in previous

chapter (Chapter 2): ‘paquete’ and ‘jangada’ fleets affected primarily the stock of L. synagris

and in a lesser instance, L. chrysurus whereas ‘boats’, particularly BOM, were the main fleet

that exploited L. analis and L. jocu. As a result, scenarios in which Boats remained constant

(scenarios 1, 4) showed a yield almost unchanged. The opposite pattern is observed for

scenario 2 and 3. This would mean that fishery should be mostly controlled for the fleets,

which most influence the dynamic of each species (or group of species).

Biomass dynamic models for aggregate species groups can be specified for jointly

harvested species (Ralston &amp;amp; Polovina, 1982). Models of this type can be appropriate both for

interacting and non-interacting species groups (Hollowed et al., 2000). These models can



Chapter 5

104

provide useful guidance in fisheries where there are insufficient resources for time consuming

and costly research vessel surveys and analysis of age structure (Jennings et al., 2001).

Biomass dynamic models have formed the major assessment tools for many fisheries, e.g.

ICCAT, IATTC (International American Tropical Tuna Commission), ICSEAF (International

Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries), amongst others (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992).

However, the use of these models depends greatly on the nature of available data. From a

technical point of view, data produced according to clear and balanced designs are very

seldom available; the ‘experimental design’ is given by fishermen working to satisfy their

own needs, not those of the scientists (Pech et al., 2001). Although the surplus production

model presented various theoretical advantages (robustness, multispecific approach and

possibility of considering technological interactions), in this study, the output obtained from

surplus production model was not satisfactory as the Brazilian snapper fishery illustrates

several of the common problems faced by the fishery scientist who works on applied

problems. The data are not determined in controlled experiments and involve untested

assumptions (such as the CPUE is proportional to abundance, the data reported are of high

quality, there is no process uncertainty included), and the time series available is too short.

The basic assumption in using CPUE data is that changes in CPUE accurately reflect changes

in the abundance of fish in the stock. However, there are many circumstances in which

measures of CPUE are poor indices of abundance. In our case rough effort unit (days spent at

sea) and the high variety of gears that present a wide range of catchability (technological

characteristics of each gear may vary given are likely to provide low quality estimates). Also,

the fishing power and spatial effects may result in CPUE being a poor index: the fishing units

in a fleet (i.e. ‘jangadas’) are unlikely to have equal abilities to catch fish. Furthermore,

consider a fishing activity in an area. As catches begin to fall, fishers move to other grounds

where catch rates may remain high. Even though stocks from the previous area are being

depleted, CPUE will remain high as fishers move to a previously unexploited part of the stock

in the new area. Conversely, if only part of the stock is fished, CPUEs may fall dramatically

even though overall stock numbers remain high considering the stock’s total distribution. As

a result, the answers obtained are not clean or clear. Unfortunately, although these models can

incorporate the multispecies aspects of the fisheries, in Northeast Brazil, the data available

were not adequate and estimated parameters can not be safely used for predictions of this

fisheries. It should be necessary a longer time series of data for a safer use in the reef fishery

in Northeast Brazil.



Chapter 5

105

The catch-at-age model showed for most species a high exploitation rate and a decrease of

the biomass along the studied period, which suggests an overexploitation or at least a fully

exploited state of the snappers in Northeast Brazil (see Chapter 4). This was a pattern

identical to those found with the Thompson and Bell model. However, the patterns found for

L. jocu by the catch-at-age and Thompson and Bell model were not similar. According to the

catch-at-age model, current F is equal to 0.05 and this species is then not necessarily over-

exploited where the Thompson and Bell model reported a fully exploited state for this species.

In that case a precautionary approach should be chosen looking forward to collect further data

for a more definitive conclusion.

Main fishing effect of ‘jangada’ and ‘paquete’ were reported for typical shallower waters

species, namely L. synagris and L. chrysurus. The ‘boats’ (BOM, BOV) mainly affected L.

jocu. Within this model was also evident that members of a cohort may have differential

vulnerability to the fleet depending on fish size. For example, young dog snapper L. jocu

(small fish) that live on shallower waters were preferentially affected by ‘paquetes’ and

‘jangadas’. L. chrysurus was exposed to similar fishing mortality for all age classes, whereas

L. synagris had the older specimen more affected. Total fishing mortality obtained with VPA

analysis was close to the one computed by catch-at-age model. In chapter 4, it was reported F

equivalent to 0.24, 0.27 and 0.19 for L. jocu, L. chrysurus and L. synagris respectively. Also

biomass values were within similar range for both approaches. However the advantage of the

catch-at-age model here applied is that it may predict catches considering that the exploitation

is fleet specific and it is evident the effect of the different boats categories on the stock

structure. Also, the computational program is a powerful in estimating non-linear equations

which contains ´ free parameters´ (as catchability and errors coefficients).

The interesting point, and somehow reassuring, is that the output of the different models

was similar from one to another despite the different perspective of each model. Biomass

dynamic and catch-at-age models have different basis of parameter calculation and, if biomass

dynamic methods provide a different answer to the catch-at-age model, then one should try to

understand why they are different and analyse the management implication of the different

predictions, rather than concentrating on deciding which method is correct (Hilborn &amp;amp;

Walters, 1992). There are no model that can be qualified the ‘best’, that is why contrary

output should be carefully considered as different model’s assumptions may help the scientist

to make the right conclusion. Charles (1998) stated that fishery management framework

validity does not imply certitude on the structure of the ‘real fishery system’. However, they

must be coherent with available data and their validity relies on their capacity to give some



Chapter 5

106

answer to relevant management questions. Despite limitations, applied models satisfactorily

reflected the dynamic of the stocks.

Fishing activity partly depends on the state of the resource, which itself partly depends on

the fishing activity. This means that knowledge is needed on each of those two components

and on their interactions (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). Such frameworks that attempted to

estimate tropical stocks by fitting model of multifleet multispecies fisheries to data have

already been proposed: biomass models (Ault et al., 1999; Ould Dedah et al., 1999; Mendoza

&amp;amp; Larez, 2003), age structured model, i.e. ASAP, (RFSAP - Reef Fish Stock Assessment

Panel, 1999), Yield-per-recruit model (Ault et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002), or others

(McClanahan, 1995; Labrosse et al., 2000; Pech et al., 2001). Focus on multidimensional

fishery appears to be a very important point. Koslow et al. (1988) suggested that the

complexity of coral reef fisheries may take them less stable and more vulnerable to

overfishing. When looked at snappers’ stock assessment, the general conclusion that came up

from different studies warned that fishing levels were beyond an sustainable levels or at least

beyond any conservative reference point (RFSAP - Reef Fish Stock Assessment Panel-, 1999;

Ault et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002; Mendoza &amp;amp; Larez, 2003). These findings were not only

reported for the snappers of the Northeast Brazil, but also to others stocks in others regions as

for example the Florida Keys reef ecosystems (Ault et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002).

Main conclusions and thesis outlook

This chapter had the objective to look at the multispecies and multi-gear aspect of the

exploitation of L. analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris exploring the diverse models,

which can incorporate these aspects.

Three models were applied and based on the results of two of the approaches used (the

predictive model of Thompson and Bell and the catch-at-age model), it was evident that

different fleets played distinctive roles on the life history of the snappers in Northeast Brazil.

The fishery mortality of JAN and PQT is higher for the typical shallower waters species as L.

synagris. Conversely, L. jocu is most affected by the boats categories (BOM and BOV) which

exploits mainly deeper waters. Within each species, it is also evident the multi-fleet aspects

as, for example, for L. jocu, all stages of its life history is exploited but, distinctively for each

fleet ‘paquete‘ PQT mainly exploits the juveniles and boat exploitation relies on larger

individuals).With these results some management options could be implemented by acting on

different fishing mortality by fleet through spatial regulation (i. e closed area) as spatial

distribution of both species and fleet operation played an important role in the Northeastern

Brazilian artisanal fishery. These aspects, together with the others findings within this study

will be discussed in Chapter 7, when contributions to a management plan will be proposed for

the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil.

For the next chapter, alternatives of evaluating the reef fishes are considered as it will be

tested the indicator of abundance using fishery independent method as UVC (underwater

visual censuses) together with catch data using as a study case a system in South Pernambuco.

Chapter VI. The Underwater Visual Census Technique – A direct

estimate of biomass.

VI.I. Introduction

Reef fisheries in Brazil is multispecific, multigear and is characterised by multiple

landings stations as often is the case with most coastal small scale reef fisheries (Samoilys,

1997). Management of such fishery requires a good knowledge of the condition of the stocks,

of the structure of the fish community and of how this structure may be influenced by fishing

activity (Polunin &amp;amp; Roberts, 1996; Jennings et al., 2001). Reliable estimates of basic

parameters such as abundance, catch and effort are essential to a proper description of stock

conditions.

Both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent methods of estimating the size of fish

stock have inherent strengths and weakness. One of the central problems in fishery stock

assessment is to obtain an abundance index that is proportional to the stock size and will

reflect trends. Many stock assessment procedures are carried out assuming that CPUE from

commercial catch and effort data is adequate for this purpose, but CPUE may not be strongly

correlated to abundance (Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). In some cases, the CPUE will remain

high until the stock is badly depleted (due to fish aggregation and efficient search) whereas in

other cases it will fall very rapidly while the stock is hardly being affected. In this case,

species are distributed between fragmented habitats and are not efficiently exploited due a

search deficiency.

Underwater Visual Census (UVC) techniques can provide rapid estimates of the relative

reef fish abundance, density, biomass and diversity as these non-destructive methods present a

good alternative way to assess abundance estimates (Harmelin-Vivien et al. 1985). In a

fishery context, visual census estimates are particularly useful because they are independent

of fishing methods that may be affected by the equipment and the gear selectivity. However,

the UVC methods are restricted to relatively shallow depths due to SCUBA-diving constraints

and to species that are diurnal, visually obvious and not repulsed or attracted by divers. This

bias may be worsened by the acquired behaviour of target species (Kulbicki, 1998). There are

other drawbacks such as sampling bias from diver in estimating erroneously numbers and

sizes of fishes (Harmelin-Vivien et al. 1985).



Chapter 6

109

In this study case, visual census techniques were carried out on the Tamandaré-

Maragogi reef complex. This complex is located between the Pernambuco and Alagoas state.

The coral reef formations in Tamandaré-Maragogi represent a good example of the Brazilian

coastal reefs (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997). This area was defined as a ‘hot-spot’ by the

biodiversity commission for the coastal zone as it presents a high biological importance and a

intense human activity (Anon, 2002). The area was estimated of extreme biological

importance considering the rich fauna and flora living in various environment like mangroves,

estuaries, coastal lagoons and coral reefs. However, human activity has great impact on the

local environment through chemical and biological wastes from urban and industrial activity,

sugarcane culture, fish or shrimp farming, deforestation and overfishing (see for details Anon,

2002). In the overall, 185 fish species belonging to 129 genera and 64 families were recorded

in protected area ‘APA dos corais’ (Ferreira et al., 1999; Ferreira &amp;amp; Cava, 2001). From these

species 128 were reported by underwater visual census between the shore to the 30m deep

(Ferreira &amp;amp; Cava, 2001).

Here, comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by UVC and by inshore small scale

fishery survey were considered. Information of fish abundance were collected by underwater

visual census (UVC), which is a fishery-independent method and compared to abundance

index obtained from fishing activity, catch per unit effort surveys (CPUE). Estimates of fish

abundance and CPUE were used to detect trends or perturbations in stocks. The survey

methods were compared using multivariate analysis which can offer an interesting insights for

the analysis of pattern in a multispecific system (Connell et al., 1998).

VI.II. Methods

VI.II.1. Study area

This study was carried out at two localities Tamandaré (Pernambuco) and Maragogi

(Alagoas) that present coastal coral reefs (Fig VI.1) and are part of the Environmental

Protection Area (APA) Costa dos Corais, a multiple use protected area were fishing is

allowed. This conservation unit has a total area of 4135 km2, running along 135 km of

coastline. Fishing is allowed but restricted to local fishermen (living within the conservation

unit) that have been registered. The sampled area was chosen with the purpose to look at

snapper community. The Tamandaré complex of elongated banks, patch and attached bank

reefs runs parallel to the coast. According to Maida and Ferreira (1997), the reefs are



Chapter 6

110

arranged in three lines. The first line, of few meters wide, next to the beach, consists of

shallow sandstone structure exposed at low tide. Fifty meters away, the second line depth

ranged between 1 to 8 m at different distance from the seacoast. They consist in elongated

banks that delimit a back reef zone where patch reefs (that may exceed 50 m wide) grow

seaward of the attached banks. Their tops may be emerged at low tide. The third line forms a

barrier like reef that is typical of the complex (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997). This barrier is formed

by isolated columns, the tops of which extended laterally and coalesced. Fifty meters away

from the coast began the study area comprising the reef formations that occur along the shelf,

also arranged in fragmented line roughly parallel to the coast. These geomorphological units

were probably originated by the previous coastline that moved through the geological periods

(Mabesoone &amp;amp; Coutinho, 1970). These drowned reefs may be of various shapes according to

their heights, width and surface roughness. The reef formations are called locally ‘cabeços’,

‘taçis’ and ‘lages’. ‘Cabeços’ are drowned reef knolls, ‘Taçis’ are irregular platforms and

‘Lages’ are even platform of low height. The two latter formations are possibly buried reef

constructions. Although roughness has not been measured, occurrence of cavities may be

categorised into the reef types in decreasing order of complexity:

• knolls (K), pinnacles of 5 to 10 m of diameter that rises up 10 m from the sea

floor. These structures may occur in clusters and are typically surrounded by

large sand plains.

• irregular platforms (IP): contiguous reef substrate of moderate vertical relief and

complexity. Relief consists in caverns/undercuts into the substrate.

• even platform (EP): contiguous reef characterised by a low structural complexity

with a low relief hard bottom

The fishing grounds surveyed range from 9m to 29m deep and are usually frequented by

artisanal fishers using basic fishing techniques such as hand line or harpoon. One site called

‘Os Claros’, which is positioned on the limit of a no-take area prohibiting any type of human

activities (fishing and tourism) was also surveyed. Created in 1999, the no-take area limited at

the Tamandaré Bay is part of the protected area ‘APA Costa dos Corais’ and is located in

front of the base of the ‘Projeto Recifes Costeiros’ (see footnote chapter 1) and covers 2.5

km². The substratum consists of an area of soft sediments and sand scattered with coral and

sandstone. Local fishermen do not make any use of advanced technological instrumentation to

detect fish or localise fishing ground. Traditionally, positioning is made by visual

triangulation through terrestrial marks.

VI.II.2. UVC method

To study the fish community structure, through the definition of patterns in species

composition and species abundance, stationary visual censuses were carried out in ten stations

by two divers. The sampling was undertaken during summertime (October 2002 to March

2003, austral summer) which corresponds to the dry season when water visibility, affected by

wind and rain (terrestrial runoff) is best. A standard 6 m radius point count of 10 min duration

was performed (adapted from Bohnsack &amp;amp; Bannerot, 1986; Samoilys &amp;amp; Carlos, 2000). The

point count was preferred to other methods because it can deal satisfactorily with the

heterogeneity of the habitats sampled (Bohnsack &amp;amp; Bannerot, 1986). The reduction of

Bohnsack &amp;amp; Bannerot’s 7.5 radius point count was due to habitual low visibility in the area

which was about 7m. Visual censuses were done during day-light.

Ten sites covering the different characteristics of the study area were sampled 111

times (Table VI.1). Censuses were always performed at same point along the period

considered. Homogenous census design was hampered by the water turbidity and the absence

of specific reef formation within a particular depth strata. Such problem was overcome using

non-parametric based multivariate analysis (MDS, ANOSIM, etc)

The total lengths (TL) of individuals observed were estimated visually to the nearest

cm. Before the study, divers were trained to estimate lengths of fish with wooden models of

fish. Biomass was estimated by converting individual length data to weight using length-



Chapter 6

113

weight relationships obtained from the REVIZEE program or from the FishBase database

when not available. The habitat characteristic of every site was determined qualitatively

within 3 categories of geomorphological unit (Knoll, irregular platform, even platform) as

described above.

VI.II.3. Sampling local hand line fishery

The studied sites as well as fishing zone were chosen aiming at encompassing lutjanids

distribution. Catch records were obtained from fishermen that fished all year round within the

area surveyed. The fishing effort, estimated by Ferreira et al. (2000) as 49 fishermen per day

in the Tamandaré coastal area alone, concentrates along the very near coast, where fishing

ground is reached walking (at low tide), swimming or rowing (Ferreira et al., 2000). The

gears used are hand line and spears. Few others operated farther within the area of interest

and used ‘paquetes’ with sail and use hand line as gear.

Ninety-one catches reported at five landing sites within the study area (fishers operating

on hard bottoms common to the UVC censused area where snappers occur) were randomly

selected for the analysis. Information was gathered and provided details on the gear, the

species, length and weight of individual fish as well as of the total catch weight in order to

estimate the CPUE as number and weight per trip per fisher. From this sampled catches, the

major part (over 90%) of the catch originated from knolls at 20m deep.

VI.II.4. Data analysis

Data from each UVC was used to calculate fish density (number of individuals per

sampled area), fish biomass (weight per sampled area). Relative abundance were tested for the

main family according to depth, reef morphology and in/out of the marine protected area

using Kruskall and Wallis procedure. The Shannon diversity (H’) was estimated at specific

levels. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on diversity to detect differences

between groups (depth strata, sampled, reef type). Mean fish density, mean fish length and

mean fish biomass were estimated for the fish community.

Comparisons between data from UVC and from fishing activity were carried out

through an analysis of the variation of abundance by species and family. In order to detect

patterns of similarity among underwater visual censuses, then between UVC and hand line

fishery records, multidimensional scaling (MDS, see material and methods’ section of chapter

2) representation based on similarity matrix built on Bray-Curtis coefficient was used. As data



Chapter 6

114

from UVC and CPUE are determined with a different effort type, the data used for the joined

analysis fishery-UVC were standardised using the percentage of the relative abundance

caught or sighted during a trip or a count. In order to get a realistic comparison between

fishery and UVC abundance estimates, species not vulnerable to fishing activity were

excluded following the Connell et al. method (1998). Then, only species found in common in

the two dataset were selected from the joint analysis. Two dimensional MDS plots were

presented with a stress value that measures the ‘accuracy’ of the representation. According to

Clarke (1993), stress values between 0.1 and 0.2 lead to a usable picture, value between 0.2

and 0.25 may picture an inadequate summary then a higher – dimensional representation was

plotted which had a reduced stress (less than 0.2). However, conclusions from 3-D

representation did not differ from the 2-D plot, therefore 2-D plots only were pictured as it is

a much clearer representation.

Possible clusters identified in MDS were tested statistically using the ANOSIM

(analysis of similarities) permutation test (Clarke, 1993; Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994). Abiotic

factors as depth, geomorphology (or reef types) were tested for differences between

community structure using the BIO-ENV routine (Clarke &amp;amp; Ainsworth, 1993; Clarke &amp;amp;

Warwick, 1994).

Similarity of percentage (SIMPER) analysis identified species which typified artisanal

catches and underwater counts and also identified species which discriminated them (Clarke,

1993).

VI.III. Results

VI.III.1. Underwater visual census (UVC)

In the fish assemblage studied, 60 species belonging to 21 families was recorded (Table

VI.2), the families with the major number of species were Haemulidae (8 species), followed

by Scaridae (6), Carangidae (6) and Lutjanidae (6). Of the 60 species censused, Haemulon

aurolineatum, Chromis multilineata, Acanthurus coeruleus and Sparisoma axillare

represented in frequency number over 50%. Scarus zelindae switched Chromis multilineata

represented over 50 % of the total biomass censused. The more common species, present

during most of the census were Cephalopholis fulvus (8 times out of 10) and Acanthurus

coeruleus (7 times out of 10). The total abundance was 67.1 individuals/census while, the

total relative biomass was 9.6 kg/census.

The Shannon diversity index along with the species richness did not present significant

differences when tested between sites, geographical zone (Tamandaré vs. Maragogi), depth

strata, geomorphological characteristics, or fished and protected area (Fig VI.2). However,

analysis of similarities between sites showed a highly significant difference for both density

and biomass between sites (Global R=0.486, p&lt;0.001 and Global R=0.531, p&lt;0.001

respectively ; Table VI.3). A certain contrast MPA versus non MPA was observed as the

sampled site located within the MPA ‘Os cláros’ was different to every other site but Santa

Ana (too low number of sample from Santa Ana make a too low number of permutation) (Fig

VI.3, Table VI.3).

MDS representations according to depth show that fish assemblage discriminated two

layers below 20 m and above 20 m (Fig VI.4), this pattern was then test by ANOSIM

Reef type was also represented and differences tested (Fig VI.5, Table VI.5).

Differences between geomorphological units were statistically significant, the R statistic was

higher between groups representing the extremes in the complexity range considered and low

Relative abundance was observed at a family level. Variations between factors such as

depth strata, Reef morphology and marine protected area were analysed. On the overall,

haemulids, pomencentrids, acanturids and scarids are the main families. Table VI.6 and

Figure VI.6 suggest that labrids, haemulids and lutjanids were important at deeper range as

well as on knolls. Acanthurids, scarids, and pempherids were in higher relative abundance and

relative biomass in shallow water (&lt;20) whilst lutjanids, haemulids were preferentially in

deeper range (&gt;20m). Among the lutjanids, Lutjanus vivanus did not occur in the visual

census as its distribution range was defined much deeper (see Chapter 3). Pomacentrids were

in high relative abundance in shallow water but also showed a maximum abundance in deeper

water. Contrasting results were found depending on the family considered. Significant

increase in abundance occurred within MPA for acanthurids, scarids, while a decrease was

reported for labrids, haemulids, lutjanids and serranids.

VI.III.2. Local fishing activity

Catch were represented by 42 species (Table VI.7). The three species most commonly

found in the catch were Lutjanus synagris, Scomberomorus brasiliensis and Cephalopholis

fulvus. In terms of relative abundance (number by census, i.e. per landings) L. synagris and

C. fulvus presented the highest values and, in terms of relative biomass, S. brasiliensis and L.

synagris were the most part of the catch. Between the three reef types, a clear preference of

‘cabeços’ or reef knolls as fishing ground was observed, with nearly 90% of the landings

surveyed. However, no significant difference was found between geomorphological types

(ANOVA F=0.6, df=2, p= ns).

VI.III.3. Fishery dataset versus underwater visual census (UVC)

Considering the full assemblage of fish, a great discrepancy was observed, few species

were common to both methods (Table VI.8). Great differences in densities and/or biomass

between survey methods were found mainly for haemulids (Table VI.9). Haemulids followed

by scarids were globally the dominant family in the UVC whereas lutjanids were the main

family of the catch considering the species present in both surveys only. When considering

biomass scombrids took an important place in the fishing surveys whereas serranids were not

seen as important family (6th family in decreasing order of importance).

The major part (90%) of the sampled landings originated in the studied area (common to

UVC area) came from the knoll type reef structure. Fishing activity and visual census did not

present any family in common on the irregular platform (IP). A single family, Carangidae,

was fished on the irregular platform structure and was not observed during visual censuses.

On even platform (EP), only 4 families were common to both surveys (Table VI.9).

Relative abundance in number (density) and biomass (weight) obtained between both

survey (fishing vs. UVC) were tested and pictured for the four main families (Fig VI.7, Table

VI.10). Estimates of lutjanids obtained by fishing and UVC were not found significantly

different on knoll. Haemulids presented significant differences on the even platform. The

remaining families estimates were different from one method to the other.

Density Biomass

The MDS plots, based on the common species assemblage, confirmed that the relative

abundance and the relative biomass of species were estimated differently by the two surveys

methods (Fig VI.8). Samples of fish number and biomass were discriminated according to the

geomorphological structure of the reef as well as to the data origin (UVC or catch). A two-

way analysis of similarity show a stronger difference (greater R) between survey method than

between geomorphological units although both were highly significant (Table VI.11), and

segregated fish assemblage from each reef type seemed to be somehow linked. In the Figure

VI.7, survey method discrimination occurred according to the horizontal axis, similarly reef

geomorphological unit were discriminated along the vertical axis.

VI.IV. Discussion

Underwater visual census dataset was analysed using univariate and multivariate

techniques then compared to local hand-line fishery in order to investigate whether estimates

of relative species abundance index as measured by CPUE are comparable with estimates

measured by UVC in a multispecies reef fish fishery.

VI.IV.1. Environmental variables and composition of fish assemblages

Although no difference in diversity (H’) was detected between sites even between sites

with no human activity in the last 3 years (sites ‘Claros’ located on the border of the marine

protected area ‘Costa dos Corais’) multivariate techniques such as ANOSIM test presented



Chapter 6

130

significantly different densities. The apparent stability of Shannon diversity index even

though the fish structure presenting differences may be explained by the fact that univariate

techniques reduce the full set of species recorded in a sample into a single coefficient and by

doing so fail in detecting species replacement, as often species richness and/or abundance

remain the same.

Visual analysis based on ordination diagrams provides a direct and relatively simple

mean of ecological interpretation. Exploratory analysis using MDS plot complemented by

ANOSIM procedure helped us to determine what factor may influence fish distribution. In the

present case, the result of the various statistical techniques applied to fish abundance were in

close agreement, complemented each other, and suggested that the depth gradient remains the

main factor along to the geomorphology as it is already known that morphological properties

of the coral reef determine the structure of the fish assemblages (Sale, 1980). Some authors,

mentioned the predation hypothesis in which predators may cause competition among their

prey for refuge space (Holt, 1984). Other studies suggest that fish select the smallest possible

reef structure holes to decrease predation risk (Shulman, 1984; Hixon &amp;amp; Beets, 1989).

The change of habitat characteristics induced significant changes in the community

structure though the diversity was similar at each site. A species switch occurred instead of an

increase or a domination of a particular species as it seems that complexity changes may

benefits some species (Angel &amp;amp; Ojeda, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2001; Charbonnel et al., 2002;

Willis &amp;amp; Anderson, 2003).

Differences in fish assemblage between depth strata has been commonly found in the

literature as well as our study focusing on Lutjanids (chapter 3). Although the depth range

was much smaller than the one considered in chapter 3, species assemblage and species

abundance was mainly defined by the depth gradient. The 20 m isobath appeared to be a

border line between to type of species assemblage. Considering this variable (depth strata)

data considered fishery dependent and fishery independent resulted in similar patterns.

Large predators such as snapper, jacks, or groupers were poorly represented in the UVC

surveys. However, they represented a large part of the total biomass of the area (see

Estatpesca, 2000). The limitations of the method (UVC tends to underestimate predatory

species in intensely fished areas as fish become more wary) and the location of censuses to a

fixed depth range, no more than 30m deep, may have caused biases in estimating large

predator species. Furthermore, the baited hook and line gear, used for the determination of the

CPUE, may bias the estimate as it will select preferentially carnivorous.



Chapter 6

131

Although the no-take area fish assemblage presented some significant differences, the

species diversity was not higher than other sites. However, this observation may be due to the

fact that the site ‘Os claros’ is close to the borderline and that part of the data was collected at

beginning of the closure date, allowing not enough time for recovery and therefore a real

change in the assemblage.

VI.IV.2. Comparisons of reef fish abundance using (visual census) versus

commercial catch and effort data

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) measurement is commonly used as an index of abundance.

In this study, the representation of the fish assemblage through CPUE surveys differed

significantly from UVC surveys. Different selectivity of both methods lead to such

conclusion. UVC surveys as well as CPUE surveys could present underestimation or over-

estimation according of the species censused. Visual census present many well described

biases (see for a review Harmelin-Vivien et al., 1985; Jennings &amp;amp; Polunin, 1995a; Samoilys

&amp;amp; Carlos, 2000). Accuracy and precision of the census may vary according to the area, time

of the day, season as well as environmental factors such as topography, visibility,

temperature, species richness. Also, there are two distinct fish faunas on coral reef: the diurnal

and the nocturnal fish. Most species of lutjanids, holocentrids, clupeids are nocturnal

(Longhurst &amp;amp; Pauly, 1987). This profound change that occurs at twilight will have an

important effect on UVC estimates of the total fish abundance and could affect the

catchability (and consequently the CPUE estimates). In this study however, this bias will not

account for differences between UVC and CPUE surveys as fishing and underwater activities

were carried out at daytime.

In spite of standardisation and transformation of data the two survey methods were

discriminated by the multivariate analysis. However, some degrees of similarities were found

when reef knolls characteristics were observed. This may be explained by the fact that the

influence range both techniques and that the local structure influences the dispersion or

conversely the concentration of the resource. In the case of reef knoll, fish are somewhat

concentrated around the knoll which make the influence range of the baited hook is similar to

the point count radius. As dispersion is stronger in the other geomorphological units

difference may increase between the survey methods. Further, stronger relationship may occur

for single species, or group of species that present similar ecological characteristics, and

under homogeneous fishing conditions (i. e. same period). For instance, lutjanids’ estimates



Chapter 6

132

were similar in both surveys. Similarly, density and biomass of haemulids were not found

different on even platform, although this result was mainly due to a high variance, resulting

from the occasional occurrence of large schools of juveniles, within the UVC survey.

Catch and effort data, obtained from commercial data, do not come from controlled

experiments therefore involve the untested assumption that the CPUE is proportional to

abundance. As a result, the answers that we obtain are not clean or clear (Hilborn &amp;amp; Mangel,

1997). Conversely, several studies had shown that visual counts could obtain accurate

estimates of abundance providing an adequate method for the group of species studied

(Samoilys, 1997; Samoilys &amp;amp; Carlos, 2000). It has therefore been used to obtain fishery-

independent stock assessment of reef fish, such as New Caledonia (Letourneur et al., 2000).

However both methods do have biases, although from different origins. A combination of

both methods should therefore add confidence in assessment of reef fish abundance (Connell

et al., 1998). Best correlated estimates of CPUE and UVC may be obtained using Kulbicki’s

method (1988) in which CPUE obtained using experimental fishing at the same time, same

place and with a large number of replicates as it would minimise error sources from spatial

and temporal variations (see also Kulbicki et al. 2000). Many biases that may arise are

specific to each method, and a global approach taking in account both indexes may benefit an

better understanding on exploited reef environment.

Catch-per-unit-effort in fisheries science and underwater visual surveys in marine

ecology are widely accepted for providing estimates of relative abundance. Both methods will

bring complementary information for better knowledge on the habitat along to the fishery

processes, but linking both methods needs further research before being widely used.



Chapter 6

133

Main conclusions

• No spatial variation was found in term of diversity. Although catch composition

varied, species switched according to the depth gradient and to

geomorphological units, the species richness and diversity stayed at a similar

level (species replacement).

• No large predators were found in the UVC records as censuses did not

encompass their range of distribution.

• The type of geomorphological units seems to be an important factor influencing

the species composition as further study should be developed to quantify such

effect.

• CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall. However, sampling

performed on knolls for lutjanids were found similar. This may be explain by the

fact that fish assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both survey

methods present a similar operating range.

• Best results would probably be obtained with controlled fishing and UVC

experiments on several identical sits.

Chapter VII. General discussion

The Brazilian effort for the development of the scientific knowledge necessary for the

sustainable use of the resources within the Exclusive Economic Zone was represented by the

REVIZEE program. This collective endeavour aimed the study of the ecosystem of Exclusive

Economic Zone, in its physical, social, and biological characteristics. The fishery science part

of the program, which collected data on species and fleet from 1996 to 2000, gave the

opportunity to perform, for the first time in the Northeast region, a diagnostic of the fishing

activity and its impact on fish assemblage. Regarding reef fishes, this study was an appraisal

of the sustainability of the fishery, through catch analyses and stock assessment, a definition

of relevant management plan as well as a critical analysis of the sampling program used (for

improvement of future design).

In fisheries stock assessment, the major part of effort goes into the determination of the

stock status relative to biological reference points, such as levels of fishing mortality,

spawning biomass or age structure, or to obtain diagnostics that may warn manager and

scientists against serious depletion or collapse. Stock assessment relies upon the estimation of

many parameters and requires extensive current and historical data measured from the fishery

and from independent biomass surveys (Pitcher &amp;amp; Preikshot, 2001). Stock assessment,

although sometimes only viewed as an interpretation of commercial catch statistics to

estimate potential yield and/or limitations, is far more than that. Hilborn and Walters (1992)

stated that, ‘first and foremost, stock assessment involves understanding the dynamics of

fisheries’. Fisheries are much more than fish catch and fishermen are an important component

of the dynamic system.

In this thesis, I conducted a baseline characterisation and fishery management analyses

using a wide range of methods in fish stock assessment including mathematical and statistical

modelling to provide a quantitative baseline assessment of the distribution and status of reef

fishery resources. Four general areas have been investigated in the present study: (1) the

dynamic of the commercial reef fishery in northeastern Brazil (Chapter 2); (2) the bathymetric

trends of snappers through their exploitation (Chapter 3); (3) the development and

applicability of traditional stock assessment models (Chapter 4) and of those which are

suitable for multi-gear and multispecific fisheries (Chapters 5); and (4) the use of alternative,

fishery independent, information gathered by underwater visual censuses (UVC) (Chapter 6)

Many multivariate methods applied to fishery data have been performed in order to

distinguish phenomena such as spatial pattern, fishery power, gear selectivity related to

fishing trip or survey (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994; Pech &amp;amp; Laloë, 1997; Garcia et al., 1998;

Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998; Pitcher et al., 1998; Preikshot &amp;amp; Pauly, 1998; Pelletier &amp;amp;

Ferraris, 2000; Rice, 2000; Pitcher &amp;amp; Preikshot, 2001; Stergiou et al., 2002; Willis &amp;amp;

Anderson, 2003). In fishery science, the simultaneous analysis of various components of the

environment and the biomass related to the exploited populations may allow a better

understanding of the environment and fishery dynamic improving the information needed for

the development of a management plan (Gaertner, 1997).

Non-parametric multivariate analyses such as non-metric multi-dimensional scaling

(MDS) and relatives (ANOSIM, BIO-ENV, etc) provided a way of dealing with problematic

underlying distributions of abundances (Kruskall, 1964). Its weaker assumption of ordinal

rather than interval information greatly increases robustness in the face of irregular

distributions of abundance and high sampling variance. As a result, MDS has become a

widely used technique for ecological ordinations of benthic and fish communities (Clarke,

1993; Clarke &amp;amp; Ainsworth, 1993). In fishery science, the incorporation of non-biological

factors provided a important tool to better understand fishing dynamics (Pitcher et al., 1998;

Preikshot &amp;amp; Pauly, 1998). Such knowledge facilitated fishery researcher to focus on specific

information to maximise a sampling program (money, effort and personnel). The

complementarity of these techniques allow the knowledge of the structure and the dynamics

of the fishing activity. Spatial segregation of fleet operation along with distribution range of

species may also improve the development of future sampling and management program on a

spatial aspect. In this study, such techniques helped to typify the reef fishery’s components of

the Northeast of Brazil (Chapter 2). Within the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were

found to be the main part of the artisanal catch. Also, while exploring the catch data, it was

possible to visualise that each state showed a specific characteristic in term of fleet dynamic

and therefore catch composition. This chapter was essential in understanding the fishery

dynamic of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, hence helping the adaptation of the stock

assessment models further applied within the reality of the fishery in the region (Chapters 4

and 5).



General discussion

136

In order to better understand how the fleet dynamic is related to the snappers dynamic,

the primary group of species driving the fishery, their distribution and relationship with the

fishery dynamic was studied The ontogenetic depth distribution of snappers as well as the

fleet operating distribution were described for management purpose. Implication of the fleet

dynamic and consequently fishing effect on lutjanid population was discussed.

Fish stock assessment and fishery management in Northeast Brazil

Fisheries in both developed and developing countries are often reported to be in crisis.

Fishery systems are complex, inherently variable and incompletely understood. The

combination of these factors creates considerable uncertainty, which must be respected both

in fisheries evaluation and in implementation of management regimes. Wherever there is

uncertainty, there is risk, and this must be considered (Buckworth, 1998). In the fishing

industry, the range of risk is enormous, because it deals with environmental factors and

volatile markets, changes in harvesting management strategy, socio-economic considerations,

political ‘imperatives’ and economic reality (Lucena, 2000). Uncertainties need to be

identified and uncertainty reduced to encourage the taking of risk (in terms of management

option) (Penhorn, 1999). A feature of ‘controllable’ uncertainties can only be managed

successfully, i.e. risk be reduced, if they form the basis of an integrated comprehensive

fishery management that embraces socio-economic considerations and harvest strategies.

The uncertainty and a poor knowledge of the resources are major setbacks for the

development of a suitable assessment and management of fish stocks in developing countries

(Lucena, 2000). Thus model with few data need were preferred. In the present case, simple

catch-at-age models incorporating characteristics of the multi-fleet exploitation and biology of

the species were developed (Chapters 4 and 5).

Once the dynamic of the reef fishery and the part of ecology of the species were

characterised, the next logical step was to explore stock assessment model that would be used

to evaluate the current status of the exploited stock as well as to allow simulated scenario for

management purposes. Additionally, one should also better assess biological / ecological

characteristics of the exploited species (i.e. reproduction, size at first maturity, etc).

Traditional models were employed (Chapter 4) and the advantages and limitations of the

techniques were discussed. Non-equilibrium models, such as real cohort VPA, provided

coherent results. Model extensions that deal with the multifleet and multispecies aspect of the

reef fishery were used in the Chapter 5. It was evident that different fleets played distinctive

roles on the life history of the snappers. Fleets with different operation capacities will affect

137

stocks on different ways and this is mainly related to the fleet power, which is related to fleet

category. ‘Jangadas’ and ‘paquetes’ had a major effect on stock of L. synagris since they

operate in shallower waters whereas L. analis and L. jocu were more affected by ‘boats’

(BOM and BOV). For each species, the multifleet aspects of the reef fishery was also evident,

L. jocu, for example, had all stages of its life history exploited but, distinctively for each fleet

in agreement with the combined effect of fish distribution and fleet operating position,

‘paquete’ mainly exploits the young individuals and ‘boat’ exploitation relies on larger

individuals (Chapter 3).

When fishery dependent data has the potential to be biased by many factor (such for

instance, under-reporting, lack of cooperation, gear selectivity), fishery independent data can

provide measure on reef fish abundance and community composition. As a result, quantitative

multispecies stock assessment methods as an integrated assessment should help for

management decisions regarding fish stocks at broader levels.

Fishery independent information were used to get a picture of an ecological ‘hot spot’,

where management attempts are set up, and to assess the relationship between catch-per-unit-

of-effort (CPUE) through comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by underwater visual

censuses (UVC) and by inshore fishery survey (Chapter 6). Fish composition varied

accordingly to the habitat type. CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall.

However, sampling performed on knolls for lutjanids were found similar. This may be

explained by the fact that lutjanid assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both

survey methods present a similar operating range. Although at this point no clear conclusion

can be made about the relationship between UVC and CPUE method, it was shown that a non

destructive fishery independent method should bring a valuable source of information

(Kulbicki et al., 2000; Letourneur et al., 2000). This would become even more important

when spatial management strategies such as marine protected areas or ‘no-take’ areas are

implemented because these methods are able to address estimation of mortality rates within

and outside the closed area without reliance of fishery catch data and does so in a non-

destructive way (Ault et al., 2001).

Survey design. Gathering more and better information

Differences may occur between research survey data and commercial data as fishers

focus on their activity on target species and particular zone according to their experience and

to the economic market interest, whereas scientific surveys fishes without optimising the

catch nor target fishing activity on some species of commercial interest. However, additional

information from research survey that may be standardised and may determine precise



General discussion

138

estimates of CPUE as well as spatial structure will greatly improve our view of the stock in

terms of abundance and distribution.

This study also presents the quantitative bases required for future preparation of an

optimal sampling design analysis that produces precise statistics required for future

implementation of a fishery management plan for the Northeast of Brazil. Results of this

study will help to subsequent development of an efficient monitoring design that could

optimise, in a cost-effective way, the precision of estimates for key management system

efficacy. Chapters 4 and 5 draws attention to the fact that putting a large piece of effort in

collecting ‘basic’ data does not completely fill our expectation for a satisfactory management

action. Time-series with catch estimates at specific level are needed in order to carry out any

type of model. For instance, catch-at-age model has best performances when at least the entire

cohort is taken into account (in the snappers case, at least 19 years).

Furthermore, a broad sampling design should be conducted to gather auxiliary

information that would help to define a holistic picture of the exploited ecosystem, namely

mapping of fishing effort in a greater detail and precision, identification of fishing ground

(localisation, identification of species caught by site), increase of the resolution and precision

of base ‘habitat’ maps for key environment variables (reef complexity, bathymetry, reef

mapping), best knowledge of fishers behaviour, technological characteristics (gears, boat)

gathered by routine census at landings sites. Such information may not be too difficult to

collect depending on the capacity of the socio-economic pattern and fishery scientist to

cooperate. In this study, although the sample design of did not totally fulfil our expectations,

management recommendations can emerge despite the complexity of the fishery.

Recommendations for the management plan of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil.

Management actions can be divided into catch controls, effort controls, and technical

measures (Jennings et al., 2001). Catch controls limit the catches of fishers or the fleet as a

whole, effort controls limit the numbers of fishers in the fishery and what they can do, while

technical measures control the catch that they can be made for a given effort (OECD, 1997).

Catch control are amongst the most widely used management regulations. A catch quota

or catch-limitation system as a straight measure may be efficient if supported by an effective

monitoring and surveillance scheme (Nagasaki &amp;amp; Chikuni, 1989) and accepted on a social

basis. However, it is true that catch limitation is generally impractical and hardly applicable in

the Northeast of Brazil. Reef fishing activity is mainly performed by poor people and the

characteristic of the activity that present highly spread landing sites make controls difficult.



General discussion

139

Also, there are some disadvantages from a biological and social point of view. The

expectation of a reduction of a specific catch may not be always fulfilled and the process

involved in the reduction of a catch is generally a vague one (Nagasaki &amp;amp; Chikuni, 1989).

Furthermore, the recovery of depleted resources may require a long time, particularly for

long-living species such as the lutjanids studied. In a technical point of view, catch quotas

management tends to encourage a race to fish amongst fishers in order to maximise their share

of the quota (the fishery is closed when the aggregated catch equals total allowable catch).

This would encourage the ‘overcapacity’ as larger and more powerful vessel will compete

more efficiently.

Effort controls aims to reduce the fishing mortality by limiting the fishing power

through the restriction of the number of fishers, boats in activity, amount, size and type of

gear and/or vessel they use. Effort control can be implemented through licences. Licences

restrict the number of boat or fishers in the fishery. Technical measures restrict the size and

sex of fished species that are caught or landed, the gear used and the times when, or areas

where, fishing is allowed. Restrictions occur with the area and/or period closed to fishing.

Efficiency of size control, as for catch control, will depend on effective monitoring and

surveillance capacity. In Brazil, such control would only be efficient on motorised boat as

they are the easiest fleet to control efficiently. From the various management options

available, few are really applicable in the Northeast of Brazil. One of them that is being

implemented in the Northern Brazil, is the a local initiative started by ‘Projeto Recifes

Costeiros’ (www.recifescosteiros.org.br) within the protected area ‘APA dos Corais’ that

make use of fishing right licences. Fishing licence is only available to the local community

which in return shall help to enforce regulation as it is of its own interest to make the fishing

exploitation sustainable.

Throughout this thesis the technical diversity of the fishery, the selection and

application of assessment methods and how fishing affects species was described. Thus, how

fishery science can inform the management process and what can be achieved through

management? One of the main findings of this thesis was that the spatial component (through

the distribution of snapper, fleet allocation and fishing ground position) was the major factor

acting on the reef fishery dynamic. Also, it was reported for most fish species a status of fully

or over-exploitation. In this situation, regulation will only be adopted when fish stocks and the

fishing industry will become so depressed that the need for action is truly compelling (Rettig,

1987).



General discussion

140

Others measures such as establishment of smaller no take zones (3-4 km²) inside the

APA, the moratorium on exploitation of vulnerable species at risk (namely the lord-of-the-

rocks Epinephelus itajara and the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum), closed seasons

during reproduction (shrimp and lobster), and minimum allowed size (red snapper Lutjanus

purpureus and lobster) were already implemented.

To improve the management in the northeastern of Brazil, two additional propositions

are suggested based on the findings of this study : (1) technical measure restringing the

fishing area and (2) the effort restriction by control on fleet’s ‘fishing power’.

In regard to the implementation of a restricted area, in a tropical multispecific

framework, which is in most cases not well studied fisheries, management will have to be

implemented without good scientific knowledge. As such, closed area may provide a means

of doing this. The use of restricted area for fishing, specially in tropical region, already

evidenced an increase of diversity, biomass, mean size and fecundity (Russ, 1991). In the

Northeast Brazil, the protected area ‘APA marinha costa dos corais’ established a clear rise of

diversity and biomass within a ‘no-take area’ established in 1999 (Ferreira et al., 2000).

Snappers are relatively sedentary fishes (by opposition to migratory fishes) after recruitment

to the reef and, a closed area, would help to reduce fishing mortality on part of the population.

As due to the fish distribution as seen in the Chapter 3 only part of the of the life cycle is

contained within the protected area. Thus, in such context, protected area might be most

efficient if set towards the off-shore in an attempt to protect the entire range of fish

distribution and consequently the entire life cycle of the species. If the implementation of such

wide area would not be possible, then a network of closed areas would provide the best

alternative to protect various phases of the life cycle of target species and thus to be a guard

against fishery collapse (Bohnsack, 1998).Such network should encompass a full range of

marine and coastal ecosystems following four principles (SCBD, 2004): (1)

Representativeness, all biogeographic regions should be represented and within each region,

all major habitats should be represented (2) replication, all the habitats should be replicated

within the network (3) viability, the network should be ecologically viable avoiding isolation

(4) precautionary design, a precautionary approach should be taken whenever there is

uncertainty. The aim of the MPA network should be to create a coherent entity and not only a

collection of individual MPA. A critical issue is the proportion of marine space protected

followed by the connectivity between closed areas as the viability of one area may depend on

what happens elsewhere. The biodiversity commission recommendation (SCBD, 2004) is that

protected area should cover at least 30% of the total area to have an effective protection and



General discussion

141

that connectivity between MPA takes into account the following: (1) allow species to continue

to access their required range of food sources (2) allow species to continue to access their

required range of habitat during their life cycle and (3) maintain metapopulation complex.

Alternatively, in the case of social pressure against permanent closed area and/or

enforcement difficulties temporary closed areas could be used to implement rotational

harvesting strategies (Jennings et al., 2001). Traditional management before modern fishery

managers often chose to harvest on a rotational basis. In Brazilian reef fishery this concept is

often used as fishers go to some ground for a while and leave it when catch reduce to an

unsustainable level, then they return after a period of time (Ferreira, pers com).

Although, results showed that motorised boats have the main effect on the yield,

restriction on the fishing power of such fleet would be a political and social decision that is

most likely impossible to take in the current economical context of Brazil and hardly

applicable. However, a licence scheme, like already established within the protected area after

a decree by IBAMA in march 2002 and implemented by the ‘Projeto Recife Costeiros’, would

be an efficient alternative that promote the local fishers over fishers from other regions. In this

way, local fishers will be part of the enforcement of the regulations. Regarding the results of

this study, however, it seems that licences should be applied not only on fishermen but also on

powered boats, not only because they were pointed out having a major effect on yield but also

based on the fact that the remaining fishery partners would hardly be controllable (there are

many unregistered ‘paquete’ and ‘jangada’).

Such recommendation go against the ultimate fishing policies elaborated by the

Brazilian government entity (Secretaria Especial de Aqüicultura e Pesca, SEAP). Indeed,

political decisions which is currently towards giving incentives to develop national fisheries.

In the light of our findings, this initiative should be not encouraged for the reef fishery in

Northeast Brazil. However, initiatives such as management strategy using protected area

involving the local communities are being developed. Economical alternatives that reduce the

fishing impact as well as educative action for local population will also help the

implementation of such management plan.

ABSTRACT
The investigation of bathymetric distribution of five snappers caught along the Brazilian Northeastern

coast by artisanal fleets through the analysis of the catch composition and relative abundance (CPUE)

showed that, on the overall, fished mean size increased along depth and that particular species

dominated the catch according to the depth strata. Mutton snapper, L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L.
chrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20-80m) whereas lane
snapper, L. synagris, and silk snapper, L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (&lt;20m) and deep (&gt;80
m) waters. Each fleet category, exploit preferentially a particular combination of species and their

size range. The fleet dynamic of the Northeast Brazil is technologically heterogeneous and determines

the catch composition. Geographical distribution of the fishery and technical interaction between

fleets and gears should be considered by the management of these species in order to maintain the

sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource.

INTRODUCTION
The abundance of marine species fluctuates in

space and time. Such fluctuations may be due to
physical (currents, temperature, etc.), or biological
processes (as growth and mortality) as well as
behavioural processes (migration, habitat use)
(Jennings et al., 2001). Various studies have been
conducted on spatial and/or temporal distribution
of reef fish communities, as size dependent
processes have long been recognised as important
for the community structure and resources (Sale,
1980; Gobert, 1994).

Fishes are an important component of reef
environment as they influence the structure of the
communities through predation, competition, and
territoriality processes (Sale, 1980). The
complexity of the interaction on the reef
ecosystem turns study on fishing effect rather
difficult (Jennings &amp;amp; Polunin, 1995; Polunin &amp;amp;
Roberts, 1996). In Brazil, various species are
exploited by fishermen mostly using hook and
line, gill nets and traps. Reef fisheries, which
operate mainly in the northeastern, have an
important role in the socio-economic life of the
region (Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 2001). However, very

little is known on the fisheries dynamics operating
in this area and their effects on reef fish
communities.

It is rather common to observe size distribution
according to depth for reef fishes (MacPherson &amp;amp;
Duarte, 1991; Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992).
Considering the fishery activity, a common pattern
observed for target species is the increase of the
number of large specimens in the catches with
increasing depth (Roberts, 1996). This pattern has
been attributed to two main natural processes:
ontogenetic migrations from coastal reefs to the
external part of the shelf or depth related growth
and mortality rates. While migration may be
related to availability of suitable prey for juvenile
fish or predation avoidance (Roberts, 1996),
differential growth and mortality may be related to
environmental factors. Temperature variation
according to the depth gradient leads to variation
in basal metabolism rates and therefore may alter
the growth rate (Longhurst &amp;amp; Pauly, 1987).
Determining the natural pattern of distribution is
specially important for species that are targeted by
fisheries, as the effects of fishing in a population
may also be extended to population parameters.

Coral reef formations in Brazil extend for
approximately 3000 km along the Northeastern

coast (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1997). They are
constituted by organic substrates built with coral,
algae and mollusc skeletons. The continental shelf
varies from 45 to 60 km wide in Ceará and Rio
Grande do Norte, then becomes relatively narrow
in Pernambuco coasts, to wide again in the south
of Bahia, reaching 200 km (Maida &amp;amp; Ferreira,
1997). Brazilian reef fishes are intensively
exploited by artisanal fisheries that concentrate on
the reef formations distributed along the
continental shelf up to the continental slope and
over oceanic banks (Ferreira et al., 1998; Ferreira
&amp;amp; Maida, 2001).

In the Northeast Brazil, reef fishes represent 46
% (of which lutjanids represent 20%) of the total
catch of the main target species in weight (total
catch: 26171 tonnes). The 54% remaining is
constituted by the pelagic and the deep-sea
demersal fauna (Estatpesca, 2000). During the end
of the 60’s, the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s and the beginning
of 2000’s, lutjanids’ catches in the Northeast
Brazil ranged between 34%, 11341 tonnes during
the 60’s, and 43%, 77422 tonnes during the 80’s.
During the 60´s and 70´s, the most valuable and
most frequently caught species in Northeast Brazil
were the red snapper, Lutjanus purpureus (Poey
1866), and in minor proportions, L. analis. From
1978 with the collapse of the red snapper fishery,
others species as L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and more
recently, L. synagris, constitute the major part of
the lutjanids catch in Northeast Brazil (65%)
(SUDEPE, 1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989;
IBAMA, 190-2001)1.

According to Ferreira et al. (2001), fisheries in
Brazilian reefs may be divided into two types.
First, the activity of recreational and artisanal scale
fishermen occurs nearby the coast in shallow
waters and reefs formations. Fishing point may be
reached by swimming or using rowing or sailing
canoes. Secondly, the medium scale commercial
fisheries that operates by the coastal part of the
shelf, using sailing or motorised boats that reach
deeper waters as far as the shelf break. Only
motorised boats, that may operate also on the
banks far from the coast, have storing capacity
(Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 2001). Along the Northeastern
coast, snappers represent one of the main

Naturais Renováveis IBAMA, 1990-2001.

resources in terms of abundance and fishermen´s
income (Santos, 2001). Generally demersal, the
snappers are tropical and sub tropical fishes that
are distributed on reefs down to depths about 450
m (Allen, 1985; Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987). Top
predators, they consume a broad range of prey
generally dominated by fish. They show low
growth and natural mortality rates (Manooch,
1987). Snappers produce eggs with pelagic
dispersion (Grimes, 1987).

Our study focused on five species of Lutjanus,
which inhabit coastal to deep demersal waters.
The main species caught by the artisanal fishery in
Northeast of Brazil were looked at: the mutton
snapper L. analis (Cuvier, 1828), the yellowtail
snapper L. chrysurus (Bloch, 1791), the dog
snapper L. jocu (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), the
lane snapper L. synagris (Linnaeus, 1758) and the
silk snapper L. vivanus (Cuvier, 1828). The
distribution and relative abundance of these
species along a depth gradient, across the
Northeast Brazil continental shelf and upper slope
was described. The effects of the reef fishery on
distribution, size of fish and CPUE of snappers
considering the relationship between the species
distribution and the dynamics of the fleets (gear
used, fleet category and operating area) were also
discussed.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study site and data collection
Most of the data for this study was collected as

part of a national programme called REVIZEE
(Evaluation of the Potential of the Live Resources
from Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone), which
was established in 1996 in order to provide
information on the biology and fishery of its main
resources. Another programme “Projeto Recifes
Costeiros” complemented the dataset available on
the artisanal fishery in Pernambuco. A
comparative analysis was applied to the reef
fisheries distributed over 2000 km of coast
encompassing five Brazilian states (Ceará, Rio
Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and
Bahia) through a five-year sampling programme.
It was gathered information regarding the fishing
tactics (fishing area, gear used, target groups, etc)
and catch composition of fleet operating in the
region.

Data were collected from August 1996 to
March 2000. Species were identified and

measured in situ (fork length FL). The landings
sites were chosen in order to get a representative
picture of the catch composition in the region.
Sites were localised over the five states cited
above. In addition, some data were collected from
research vessels that operated on the banks and
oceanic islands (Atol das Rocas and Arquipélago
de São Pedro e São Paulo) off the Rio Grande do
Norte coast.

Fishermen were interviewed and information
regarding the operation within the fishery and
catch were collected. Within the REVIZEE
framework, more than 69 000 records of fishes
supplied by 2400 trips were gathered. For this
study, nearly 22 000 fishes, which had information
on depth, were considered amongst the 5 species
of Lutjanus (Table 1).

Table 1: Number of four lutjanid species sampled
from august 1996 to March 2000 with information
on depth by states.

Information on specific landings and effort
(number of boats) by fleet category were collected
for the studied period by the program
‘ESTATPESCA’ held by the Brazilian
Environmental Agency for official statistics
(IBAMA, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e
dos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis). The reef
fishery can be distributed into five categories of
fleets classified as following, from the most
rudimental to the most technically advanced fleet:
“Paquete” (PQT), “Jangada” (JAN), “Bote a vela”
(BOV), “Bote” (BOT), “Bote motorizado” (BOM)
(see table 2 for details). In addition, historical
landings were compiled for the period from 1967
to 2001 by various governmental organisations:
the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics
(IBGE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística), the Research Centre for Northeastern

Fisheries (CEPENE, Centro de Pesquisa e
Extensão Pesqueira do Nordeste), and the
Superintendence for the Fishing Development
(SUDEPE, Superintendência para o
Desenvolvimento da Pesca).

Data analysis

The relationship between depth and fish size
was assessed by correlation and regression
analyses. The correlation analysis was used to test
the statistical significance of the relationship for
each species. The correlation between depth and
size was determined for all species using non-
parametric Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient. The regression analysis was
performed using the Kendall's robust line-fit
method (1995). Kendall's rank correlation was
used in order to test whether the slope (?) for each
species was different from zero.

Catches were analysed by gear, which were
arranged amongst the following categories: line,
net and trap. Minimum, maximum and average
values of fish size were analysed by gear in order
to describe the gear effects on the life history of
the species. For each species, catches were also
analysed by sampled year and fleet category.
Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was used as an
index of relative abundance. The catch was
defined in two different ways: (1) by using total
weight (kg) caught by species and (2) by using
number of individuals caught. Furthermore, in
order to standardise the effort between gears, the
time (days) spent at sea for each trip was chosen as
the best estimate. In spite of the roughness of the
unit of effort, catch and effort for each species
were positively correlated (Spearman’s correlation
r = 0.5, p &amp;lt;0.001). The CPUE analysis was
carried out by species considering the following
depth strata: &amp;lt;20m (inner shelf), 20 to 80m (outer
shelf), and &gt;80m (slope) (Mabesoone &amp;amp; Coutinho,
1970). The Kruskal and Wallis non-parametric
test was used to test the differences of the CPUE
index between depth strata as well as differences
between fleet category. We also looked at CPUE
versus depth strata relationship using Spearman’s
rank correlation analysis.

RESULTS

Catch composition of Lutjanus species by year,
gear and depth

Depth versus body size relationships was
assessed for five Lutjanids: L. analis, L. chrysurus,
L. jocu, L. synagris, and L. vivanus. The
relationship between depth and fish size for the
five species was assessed using Spearman’s rank
correlation and Kendall’s robust line-fit. All five
species showed a positive and significant
correlation between the fork length and the depth
(Table 3).

Considering all gears pooled together, the fish
size caught ranged for snappers from 7.5 to 103.0
cm FL. Mean fork length showed a decreasing
trend for L. synagris L. analis, L. vivanus (p&lt;0.05)
and for L. jocu (although non significant),
conversely L. chrysurus showed a significant
(p&lt;0.05) increasing trend (Fig 1).

Line fishery caught snappers from 7.5 to 99 cm
FL, while nets caught individuals from 13 to 85
cm FL and traps caught individuals from 16 to 103
cm FL. Analysing the catch composition by
species, every gear affected almost the entire size
range of the snapper populations, however traps
were found the most selective for L. chrysurus and
L. vivanus (Fig 2). The fork length of snappers
caught by all the three gears increased according
to depth until a maximum at 60 m (Table 4). The
operating depth range was deeper for line and
shallower for net and traps (Table 5a). Paired gear
groups were tested using the Mann-Whitney U
procedure. Line depth operation was significantly
different from Net and Trap (p&lt;0.001), while no
difference could be distinguished between Net and
traps. Lines, nets and traps caught, in average,
individuals of similar size range for all species.
Fishermen using hook and line operated
preferentially between 40 and 60 m. Users of net
occurred rather equally through the depth gradient
with a peak between 0 and 20 m and, traps were

set up preferentially within the 20-40 m (5b).
Largest specimens of each species were caught at
deeper limits of the species range. As a general
pattern, small individuals were exclusive to
shallow waters and larger ones to deeper waters;
an intermediate zone presented a mixed sized
fishes (Fig 3).

Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) versus depth
relationship

Although snappers have a wide range of
distribution, differences between species were
detected. The maximum relative abundance
(numerical and biomass CPUE) of the Lutjanus
species varied according to depth. L. synagris and
L. vivanus were more abundant at the extremes of
the snappers distribution range: shallower and
deeper waters respectively. The three other
species (L. analis, L. chrysurus, and L. jocu)
showed a smoother distribution with a maximum
abundance reported in the 20 – 80 m depth strata -
outer shelf part (Table 6a and 6b). The
relationship between the numerical CPUE
(individuals caught per day at sea) and the depth
was negatively correlated for L. synagris, L. jocu,
L. chrysurus, and L. analis. L. vivanus presented a
non-significant positive relationship (Table 7a),
while the relationship between the depth and the
CPUE in kg per day at sea was negative for L.
synagris, positive for L. analis and L. vivanus, and
non significant for L. chrysurus and L. jocu (table
7b).

Fleets mostly operated between 40 and 60 m
(25% of the total number of trips)(Table 8), where
the major part of Lutjanids stocks are located,
affecting mainly the adults of L. analis and L. jocu
(&gt; 30 cm FL) and, both juveniles (&amp;lt;23 cm FL)
and adults of L. chrysurus (Fig 3). The depth
stratum 20-40 m concentrated 20% of trips, which
influenced young adults (&gt; 30 cm) of L. jocu, and
both juveniles and young adults of L. synagris and
L. chrysurus.

Motorised boats “Botes Motorizados” (BOM)
and wind motioned “jangadas” (JAN) were the
most important fleet categories with respectively
28% and 51% of the total number of trips during

the studied period along the northeastern coast
(Table 8). Motorised boats operated mostly from
20 m towards offshore (over 80 m deep) whilst
“jangadas” fished from the coast up to 60 m deep.
Sailing boats (BOV) and mixed boats (BOT)
represented 5% of the total number of trips with an
operation range mostly above 80 m. “Paquetes”

represented 15% of the total number of trips and
operated mainly from the coast up to 20 m deep.

The snappers’ catch composition (Table 9)
shows that motorised boats (BOM) fished on the
five studied species. However, L. synagris, that
inhabits shallower waters, was less affected by
motorised boats but it was the main target of the
wind propelled “paquetes” and “jangadas”.
Conversely, L. vivanus, which inhabits deeper
waters, was targeted almost exclusively by
motorised boats. The remaining species were
caught by all categories. As fishing activity was
greater at shallow (&lt;20 m) and intermediate depth
(40 to 60 m), where rudimental fleet and more
advanced technologically fleets overlap, fishery in
Northeast of Brazil affects mainly species that
inhabits preferably this depth layer (L. analis, L.
jocu and L. chrysurus).

Differences between relative abundance and
fleet category were significant for all species when
the biomass CPUE was considered and for three
species L. analis, L. jocu and L. synagris when
numerical CPUE was analysed (Table 10).

The “jangadas” (JAN) fleet category was the
most numerous fleet in activity along the
northeastern coast, from Ceará to Alagoas (53% of
total operating boats) (Table 11), followed by the

motorised boats category (BOM) with 22.4% of
the total fleet. However, although motorised boats
were less numerous, their fishing power was
greater than “jangada’s” ones and, landings of
motorised boats (BOM) and “jangadas” equally
represented 27% of the Lutjanus catches recorded
by the Brazilian official statistics during the period
from 1997 to 2001 (estatpesca). Motorised boats
(BOM) and sailing boats (BOV) showed the
greater yield considering the biomass, CPUE and
the numerical CPUE. BOM yielded 13.7 and
BOV 9.6 kg / days spent at sea whilst “jangadas”
yielded 6.1 kg/ days (Table 12a and 12b).

Trip duration, days spent at sea, was different
amongst fleet categories and states (Table 13).
While small fleets, “paquetes” and “jangadas”,
spent at sea no more than two days, more
sophisticated fleets trip duration (BOM, BOV)
could reach 12 days at sea. However it is recorded
differences between states. “Jangadas” from
Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte spent, in average,
2 days at sea whilst, in Pernambuco, trip was
restricted to a day. Motorised boats (BOM) time
at sea ranged from 1 - 2 days in Bahia to 4 - 5 days
in Pernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte.
In Ceará trips of Motorised boats (BOM) may last
up to 13 days .

DISCUSSION
Patterns of the relationship between body size

and abundance in natural assemblage have been
documented for a number of animal taxa (Gaston
et al., 1993). Also, in a fishery context, an
increase of the number of large specimen with
increasing depth is commonly observed (Roberts,
1996). Our results indicated that significant body
size versus depth relationship has been observed
for each species. Bathymetric distribution
according to demersal fish size has been already
reported (Lukens, 1981; MacPherson &amp;amp; Duarte,
1991). The relationships, examined in our study,
showed a general trend going towards a greater
size with increasing depth, such a result was also
reported in various studies (Rooker, 1995;
Machias et al., 1998; Rex &amp;amp; Etter, 1998).
However, the depth- body size relationship is
weaker at intermediate depths due to a spatial
overlap. Indeed, when small individuals are
exclusive to shallow waters and only large ones
are caught in deep waters, mixed catch of medium
and large fishes is reported at intermediate depths.
This movement may be related to feeding, and
reproductive habits (Uiblein, 1991; MacPherson,
1998; St-John, 1999; Grutter, 2000; Carrasson &amp;amp;
Matallanas, 2001).

Oliveira (2000) reported that maximum relative
abundance (CPUE) of teleosts species on the
external part of the shelf and the slope was
observed within the depth strata of 100 – 150 m.
In this study, the maximum abundance of four
Lutjanus species (L. vivanus did not present a
significant pattern) was negatively correlated with
the increasing depth, when numerical CPUE was
considered. However, the relationship changed
when the biomass CPUE was considered.
Individuals were caught in greater number in
shallow waters but as most of them were small
sized fishes, the relationship between CPUE index,
considering weight, and depth showed a mixed
pattern. Negative relationship of numerical CPUE
was counterbalanced by the bathymetric
distribution of lutjanids caught. Mean maximum

relative abundance varied, for each species, from
the shallow water layers with L. synagris to the
deep water layers with L. vivanus. Several
explanations have been offered to describe this
pattern, including differential mortality or growth
with depth or migration to deeper water with
increasing size (Roberts, 1996). Ecological
characteristics of shallow and deep waters may be
responsible for such distribution. Shallow waters
feature shelters for younger fish, they, generally,
have a higher productivity and are inhabited by
small preys that are also targeted by young, small
sized fish. Alternatively, fishes that inhabit deep
cool waters have their losses of energy reduced
(Longhurst &amp;amp; Pauly, 1987), which allows them to
store more energy so they are less susceptible to
fluctuations in food supply (scarcer in deep
waters) (Sogard, 1997). The maximum length
reported for the Lutjanus species (L. analis: 94 cm
FL, L. chrysurus: 87 cm FL, L. jocu: 128 cm FL,
L. synagris: 60 cm FL, L. vivanus: 83 cm FL)
(Allen, 1985) is similar to the maximum length
registered for the Northeast Brazilian catches. For
all species, juveniles were also caught. Hence, the
three main operating fishing gears (traps, lines and
gill nets) affect almost the entire range of the life
history of the Lutjanus species. However, gears
caught fishes of similar size for all species.

In a multispecific perspective, the fleet/gear
comes into contact with stocks of different species,
and a mixed catch result due to the exploitation of
technologically interdependent species (Anderson,
1986). In such a context, the technological
interactions is not only related to the selection of
part of the stock but also with the selection of the
species caught. Considering the species’
distribution and the multispecific nature of the reef
fishery in Northeast Brazil, fleet operation may
vary from shallow to deep waters depending,
amongst others factors (environmental conditions,
motorised or wind motioned boats, shelf width,
trade winds, etc), on the availability of a typical
coastal species (as L. synagris) or a typical deeper-
water species (as L. vivanus). Considering such
stratified distribution, fleets with different



Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology – BABT in press

operation capacities will affect stocks on different
ways.

These differences may not necessarily related
to gear (a boat in tropical fishery may carry more
than one gear) but also to the fleet power, which is
related to fleet category, and also to the state, due
to its environmental characteristics. Fishing
grounds, i.e. shallow or deep waters, will be
reached according to fleet power. Factors as
engine power, carrying capacity, presence or
absence of ice are related to the distance to the
shore and hence, the time at sea. Additionally,
environmental conditions such as wind, rain,
currents, or the continental shelf width may
influence the access to shallow or deep fishing
grounds.

Our results highlighted the fact that
technological interactions, will affect the catch
composition and therefore the fishing impact on
snappers. All fleets categories mostly operated
within the 40-60 m depth zone, what consequently
affected mostly L. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus.
Motorised boats (BOM) affected mainly L.
vivanus because of its deeper waters fleet
operation. “Jangadas” and “paquetes” had as their
main target L. synagris since they operate in
shallower waters.

Also, climatic, oceanographic or geographic
characteristics as winds, currents or
geomorphology of the shelf may influence the
fleet operation and catch composition. For
example, wind powered boats, “paquetes”,
“jangadas”, sailing boats (BOV), in Ceará had a
greater operating range, and therefore affect a
greater number of species, due to the dominant
winds (Trade winds) that allow the vessel to reach
deeper waters.

Fleets are likely to exploit different stages of
the life cycle of a fish community while operating
in different geographical areas, in simultaneous or
sequential harvesting (Charles &amp;amp; Reed, 1985).
Fisheries of the same fish community are linked
through their exploitation. To maintain the
sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the
continuance of the resource, the optimal fleet mix
and catch allocation should be carefully
considered (Kulbicki et al., 2000; Labrosse et al.,
2000; Letourneur et al., 2000; Lucena et al.,
2002).

The multifleet and multispecies nature of the
northeastern Brazilian fisheries has various
consequences in terms of resources management
and ecological issues. In the study area, few

marine protected areas (MPA) have been created
along the coast as a part of a new management
alternative of reef ecosystems (Ferreira, 2000).
Some marine protected areas have been set parallel
nearby the coast, mainly because of logistical
reasons, i.e. zone easily accessible and that can be
watched from the shore. This setting would only
preserve part of the life cycle of some species,
excluding other species. Due to the within and
between fish species spatial structure, the MPA
design will have consequences on its efficiency
(Kramer &amp;amp; Chapman, 1999). In small reserves
near the shore, snappers’ home range will exceed
the MPA limits. Considering the reef fishery in
Northeast Brazil, the MPA might be most efficient
if set in direction to the off-shore in a attempt to
protect the entire range of fish distribution and
consequently the entire life cycle of the species.
This could also offer some protection of various
kind of habitats used by different stage of the life-
cycle of each species.

Although we are aware that a dataset originated
from commercial fisheries may only partially
represent the fish community because of gear
selectivity and fishing tactics, we may consider
that variations in the effort and/or gear fishing
power represent the actual trend in the fish
distribution (fishermen go where the fish is).
More attention should be given on technological
interactions and multispecies aspects of the reef
fishery in Northeast Brazil as stock assessment
models for the management of single species
fished by one type of gear (or fleet) may be
inadequate to apply to the northeastern Brazilian
fisheries and to predict changes at the assemblage
level (Pikitch, 1988; Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992).
The inter and intra-specific bathymetric
distribution and the multifleet character of the
Northeastern Brazilian reef fishery demonstrate
that considering only one category of a fleet will
likely bias our assessment on the real impact of
fishing activities.

RESUMO
A distribuição batimétrica de cinco espécies de

peixes do Nordeste Brasileiro foi examinada

através da análise da composição da captura e e

abundância relativa (CPUE) mostrou que, de uma

maneira geral, o comprimento furcal aumentou

com a profundidade e que algumas espécies

dominaram a captura de acordo com a faixa de

profundidade. A cioba, L. analis, a guaiúba, L.
chrysurus, e o dentão, L. jocu foram
principalmente pescados na zona intermediaria

(20-80 m) enquanto ariocó, L. synagris e o pargo
olho-de-vidro L. vivanus ocorreram
respectivamente nas águas rasas e nas águas

profundas. Cada tipo de embarcação do Nordeste

do Brasil explota preferencialmente uma

combinação particular de espécies e uma

determinada amplitude de tamanho. A dinâmica

da frota do nordeste do Brasil é tecnologicamente

heterogênea e determina a composição da

captura. A distribuição geográfica da pesca e a

interação técnica entre as frotas e as artes de

pesca devem ser consideradas pelo manejo destas

espécies visando a manutenção dos estoques em

bases sustentáveis e a garantia de continuidade do

recurso.

RESUMO

A estatística oficial da captura de recursos pesqueiros demersais no Nordeste do

Brasil foi realizada no período de 1967 a 2000 por três instituições

governamentais, a saber: Superintendência de Desenvolvimento da Pesca -

SUDEPE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – IBGE e Instituto

Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Renováveis - IBAMA. Os dados

apresentados por estas instituições mostram um cenário em que durante a

década de 60 a pesca das espécies da família Lutjanidae é dominada pelo pargo,

Lutjanus purpureus Poey, espécie mais importante dentre os peixes demersais

capturados. A situação atual indica que 12 espécies do gênero Lutjanus são

exploradas pela pesca na costa nordeste. Os desembarques de Lutjanídeos são

registrados nas estatísticas oficiais nas categorias multi-específicas a exemplo da

categoria “pargo” que agrega cinco espécies. À exceção do estado da Bahia (BA),

onde o “pargo” nunca foi um recurso significativo, esta categoria dominou as

capturas de peixes nos estados do Ceará (CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN) e

Pernambuco (PE) até a década de 70. Em Pernambuco a “cioba”, Lutjanus analis

(Cuvier) passou a ser a principal espécie capturada na década de 80, seguida

pela “guaiúba”, L. chrysurus (Bloch), “dentão”, L. jocu, (Bloch &amp;amp; Schneider) e

“ariacó”, L. synagris (Linnaeus). No Rio Grande do Norte a “guaiúba” passou a

aumentar sua participação nas capturas também na década de 80 e, atualmente,

estas quatro espécies (L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris”, L. analis) ocorrem na

mesma proporção. No Ceará, onde as capturas de “pargo” se mantiveram como

as mais importantes por um período mais longo que nos demais estados, se tem

observado na última década a crescente participação da guaiúba e do ariacó. De

acordo com resultados obtidos como parte do programa REVIZEE/NE os

parâmetros de idade e crescimento para estas espécies indicam crescimento

lento (K&lt;0,2) e longevidade média a alta (20 a 30 anos). Estas características

tornam estas espécies altamente vulneráveis a sobrepesca, o que indica a

necessidade de criação de programas de manejo voltados para o grupo.

ABSTRACT

From 1967 to 2000 records of landings of demersal fisheries were recorded by

three governmental agencies:: Superintendência de Desenvolvimento da Pesca -

SUDEPE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – IBGE and Instituto

Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Renováveis - IBAMA.  Catches of

snappers (Lutjanidae) were dominated by the pargo Lutjanus purpureus Poey,

during the 60´s.  Nowadays, 12 species of the genera Lutjanus are exploited by

demersal fisheries in the North-eastern coast.  Landing records aggregate species

in multiespecific categories, as with the “pargo” category, composed by five

different species.  Until the 70´s, this category was the most important for most

states, with the exception of Bahia state.  In Pernambuco state the mutton snapper

or “cioba”, Lutjanus analis (Cuvier) became the most representative species in the

80´s, followed by the yellowtail snapper or “guaiúba”, L. chrysurus (Bloch), the dog

snapper or “dentão”, L. jocu, (Blocch &amp;amp; Schneider) and the lane snapper or

“ariacó”, L. synagris (Linnaeus).  In the Rio Grande do Norte state “guaiúba”

landings increased in the 80´s and nowadays the four species (L. chrysurus, L.

jocu, L. synagris”, L. analis) are equally represented.  In Ceará state, where pargo

landings remained higher for a longer period, “guaiúba” and “ariacó” landings have

also increased in the last decades. According with the results of the REVIZEE/NE

program, the age and growth parameters for these species indicate slow growth

and (K&lt;0,2) and medium to high longevity (20 to 30 years). These characteristics

make these species vulnerable to over fishing, what indicates the need to develop

fisheries management programs for the group.

Key words: Fisheries, Lutjanids, North-eastern Brazilian Coast.

INTRODUÇÃO

A família Lutjanidae, pertence à ordem Perciforme, a mais

diversificada entre todas as ordens de peixes e também a ordem com maior

número de espécies entre os vertebrados (Nelson, 1997).  Esta família é

considerada como importante recurso pesqueiro em toda sua área de ocorrência

(Fischer, 1978; Ralston &amp;amp; Myamotu 1983; Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987; Ralston &amp;amp;

Williams 1989; Morales-Nin &amp;amp; Ralston, 1990; Haitght et al., 1993; Roberts &amp;amp;

Polunin, 1996).

A exploração comercial dos Lutjanídeos na costa ocidental do oceano

Atlântico teve início em 1800 na América Central (insular e continental) e sul dos

EUA. Somente um século mais tarde se iniciava a exploração recreacional deste

grupo na América Central, que é tradicionalmente capturado com linha e anzol de

fundo (Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston, 1987).

Espécies de peixes demersais da familia Lutjanidae vêm sendo exploradas

pela pesca comercial na costa norte/nordeste do Brasil desde a introdução das

linhas pargueiras pelos portugueses durante os anos 50 e 60, com o propósito de

diversificar as pescarias de atum e lagosta que já se encontravam em declínio. No

início dos anos 60 foram realizados com sucesso algumas pescarias na costa dos

estados do Maranhão, Piauí e Ceará e, também nos bancos oceânicos do Ceará,

Caiçaras e Atol das Rocas (Fonteles-Filho, 1969). O ano de 1961 pode ser

considerado como o ano em que teve início efetivamente a pesca comercial dos

estoques da família Lutjanidae, que passou por períodos de elevada produção



Bol. Técn. Cient. CEPENE, v11, n.1, 2003.

com tendência de declínio a partir do final dos anos 80 (Ivo &amp;amp; Sousa, 1988;

Ximenes &amp;amp; Fonteles-Filho, 1988).

Atualmente, a pesca de pargo evoluiu para a estratificação e diversificação

ao longo de toda a costa norte e nordeste, se estendendo até o sul da Bahia,

contribuindo significativamente nos desembarques controlados destas regiões

(Ferreira et al., 2001; IBAMA-ESTATPESCA 2001).

Nos dias de hoje, manejar e projetar os rendimentos destas diferentes

pescarias é o desafio mais relevante na preservação da diversidade dos estoques

e, sobretudo, da atividade pesqueira que além de sua relevância cultural

representa o principal sustento de muitas populações costeiras nas regiões onde

os peixes demersais ocorrem.

O presente trabalho analisa, sob esta perspectiva, a evolução da pesca de

Lutjanídeos na região nordeste do Brasil e a importância da existência de dados

oficiais de qualidade como ferramenta para o desenvolvimento de estratégias de

manejo dos recursos pesqueiros.

METODOLOGIA

Dados oficiais das capturas de recursos pesqueiros na região Nordeste do

Brasil foram publicados, nas últimas quatro décadas, por três diferentes

instituições governamentais federais, a saber: Superintendência de

Desenvolvimento da Pesca - SUDEPE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e

Estatística – IBGE e Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos

Renováveis - IBAMA. Para as análises as espécies capturadas foram agrupadas

em categorias, com registro da produção em toneladas.

Ao longo de sete anos, de agosto de 1996 a junho de 2003, o projeto

"Biologia e Dinâmica Populacional de Peixes Recifais” foi executado como parte

integrante do Programa de Avaliação do Potencial Sustentável de Recursos Vivos

na Zona Econômica Exclusiva - Região Nordeste (REVIZEE/NE). O mencionado

projeto teve como objetivo estudar a dinâmica das populações de peixes recifais

da família Lutjanidae na costa nordeste do Brasil, tendo em vista fornecer

subsídios para o manejo da pesca de espécies desta família.



Bol. Técn. Cient. CEPENE, v11, n.1, 2003.

Os dados aqui utilizados para análise da composição específica da captura

foram provenientes de amostragens biométricas realizadas pelo Programa

REVIZEE/NE durante os desembarques da frota artesanal e comercial nos

estados de Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco e Bahia, entre os anos de

1997 e 2000. No total foram amostrados 33.824 peixes pertencentes a 12

espécies da família Lutjanidae. Destes peixes amostrados foram obtidos os

comprimentos totais, furcais e padrões, além de pesos eviscerados.  Peso total e

determinação do sexo foram obtidos somente quando os exemplares

encontravam-se não eviscerados.

A partir das categorias de pescado denominadas pelo Programa IBAMA-

ESTAPESCA (pargo, cioba, guaiúba, ariocó, dentão) e seus equivalentes nomes

científicos identificados pelo Programa REVIZEE/NE, foi calculada a biomassa

tanto para as categorias de pescado como também por espécie separadamente,

através dos pesos obtidos nas amostragens, e da transformação do comprimento

em peso através da relação de peso e comprimentos calculados para cada uma

das espécies.

A percentagem relativa para cada uma das espécies foi obtida a partir da

biomassa total amostrada para cada espécie.

RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO

Atualmente, os Lutjanídeos, vulgarmente conhecidos como vermelhos,

continuam sendo capturados desde águas costeiras até a plataforma externa,

bancos e ilhas oceânicas do Nordeste (Ferreira et al., 1997), contribuindo com

12,5% dos desembarques totais controlados nos estados do Ceará, Pernambuco

e Rio Grande do Norte (IBAMA-ESTATPESCA, 2001).

As espécies do grupo estão entre as categorias de pescado mais valiosas

no mercado, sendo consideradas como peixe de primeira qualidade em todos os

estados.

A estatística oficial dos desembarques controlados no Nordeste registra as

capturas de Lutjanídeos, e também mostra a alta diversidade da comunidade de

peixes demersais tropicais, a exemplo da categoria “pargo” que nos estados do

Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte e pernambuco é composta de cinco espécies. As

tabelas 1 e 2 apresentam a correspondência entre as categorias e nomes

científicos das espécies contidas em cada uma para os estados do Nordeste. O

gênero Lutjanus participa com oito categorias que correspondem a 12 espécies

nas capturas controladas dos estados nordestinos Devido a variações nas

denominações regionais, somente Ceará, Pernambuco e Rio Grande do Norte

apresentam a mesma correspondência entre categorias de pescado e espécies.

Análises das estatísticas oficiais mostram que as capturas de Lutjanídeos

entre 1967 e 1969 não foram expressivas. Após 1973, no entanto, com aumento

do esforço pesqueiro sobre estes estoques as capturas cresceram



Bol. Técn. Cient. CEPENE, v11, n.1, 2003.

significativamente até 1976 (Ivo &amp;amp; Hanson, 1982). No caso específico do pargo, a

produção começou a declinar a partir de 1979 e em 1982 já mostrava indícios de

sobrepesca, com diminuição do comprimento médio e aumento da participação do

estoque jovem nas capturas (Ivo &amp;amp; Hanson, 1982; Ximenes &amp;amp; Fonteles-Filho

1988).

No Ceará e Rio Grande do Norte a categoria “pargo” mostrou-se sempre

como um o recurso pesqueiro importante ao longo de todo o período analisado,

com altas produções até 1990. A partir deste ano as capturas passaram a

decrescer até o ano de 1990 (Figura 1).

No caso do Ceará, a pesca do pargo mostrou aumento contínuo da

produção desde a década de 70 até 1981, quando atingiu 6.617 t. A partir de

1977 pode-se observar a participação de outras espécies nas capturas como o

dentão, Lutjnaus jocu, a guaiúba, L. chrysurus, a cioba, L analis e o ariacó, L.

synagris.  A partir de 1981 se observa uma mudança na composição dos

desembarques no estado do Ceará; e, ao mesmo tempo em que ocorre uma

redução nos índices de produtividade do “pargo”, as demais espécies adquirem

maior importância nos desembarques.  As espécies mais representativas nas

capturas de 2001, no estado do Ceará, foram guaiúba, com 1.346 t, pargo, com

926 t, ariacó, com 618 t, cioba, com 118 t, e dentão, com 79,4 t (Figura 1).

O pargo continua como o segundo recurso mais importante no estado do

Ceará, mas as estatísticas provavelmente incluem capturas desta espécie

efetuadas pela frota nordestina que se concentra e opera na região Norte, na

plataforma continental dos estados do Pará e Amapá (Souza, 2000).

No estado do Rio Grande do Norte, durante o período de 1967 a 1979, a

categoria “pargo” foi dominante nas capturas, embora não tenha apresentado um

padrão de aumento continuado como no caso do Ceará. A maior captura

registrada foi no ano de 1977, com 701 t. A partir deste ano até 1989 as capturas

de pargo foram reduzidas e não ultrapassaram 100 t nos últimos sete anos, com a

categoria pargo contribuindo com 65,.5 t em 2001 (Figura 1).

No período entre 1967 e 1977, as capturas de cioba foram tão expressivas

no estado do Rio Grande do Norte quanto às do pargo, embora tenham

apresentado oscilações para maior nos anos de 1972, 1974 e 1975. Em 1976,



Bol. Técn. Cient. CEPENE, v11, n.1, 2003.

9

apenas a cioba apareceu nas estatísticas, com 552 t, mas no ano seguinte, as

capturas tanto de pargo (701 t) como de cioba (384 t) foram expressivas. A partir

de 1978 a guaiúba passa a ser registrada nas capturas do estado do Rio Grande

do Norte e desde então tem sido a espécie com maior produção. Nos últimos sete

anos tem sido registradas as capturas da cioba, do ariacó e do dentão, cujas

produções para o ano de 2001 foram, respectivamente, 300,1 t, 163,7 t, 176,0 t e

32,3 t (Figura 1).

O volume de captura anual do “pargo” no estado de Pernambuco nos

últimos 30 anos não chegou a ultrapassar 1.000 t, como ocorreu nos anos de

1967 e 1968, quando a categoria “pargo” contribuiu isoladamente com 1.500 e

3.500 t, respectivamente. Ao contrário, o desembarque desse grupo atingiu penas

4,0 t em 2001. Entre 1972 e 1978 ainda ocorreram capturas de pargo como grupo

dominante, mas não ultrapassando as 500 t, o que representa apenas 50% do

valor obtido quando da introdução da pesca de linha de fundo no Brasil (Figura 1).

A partir da década de 80 a categoria pargo, no estado de Pernambuco, já

estava comercialmente extinta. A participação dos outros estoques nas capturas

começou em 1978; quando foram registradas as seguintes produções por

categoria: “ariacó (149,0 t), “cioba” (110,7 t), “guaiúba” (37.1 t) e “dentão” (9,5 t).

O estado da Bahia, por outro lado, mostra um aumento continuado das

capturas de Lutjanídeos ao longo desta série histórica, sendo que a categoria

mais importante de 1969 a 1977 foi a “cioba” que, neste último ano alcançou 780

t. De 1978 em diante “guaiúba” tem sido a principal categoria nas capturas,

partindo de 200 t em 1978 e chegando a 1.350 t em 1997. Segue-se a “cioba” o

“ariacó” e o “dentão”, que ainda participam nas capturas, mas com baixa

representatividade (Figura 1).

Em pescarias multi-específicas, como a com linha de fundo que ocorre no

Nordeste Brasil, existe a tendência de que espécies menos produtivas, ou que

necessitam de tempo considerável para serem recompostas, tenham suas

populações gradativamente reduzidas e sejam substituídas nas capturas por

espécies mais produtivas, e que apresentam maior capacidade de recompor as

populações (Larkin, 1977).  É provável, no entanto, que a evolução da

composição específica das capturas de Lutjanideos no Nordeste se deva ao

deslocamento da frota para novas áreas de pesca.  O declínio da pesca do pargo

nos bancos oceânicos levou a frota a se deslocar para áreas de plataforma e

talude continental no final da década de 70 e hoje a frota atua em duas áreas de

pesca diferentes ao largo da costa dos estados do Pará e Amapá, com uma

ampla variedade de artes de pesca como linha pargueira com bicicleta, caíque,

covo, espinhel “long-line” e rede.  Dois estoques pertencentes a uma mesma

população são explorados, sendo que um destes apresenta poucos indivíduos em

estágio final de maturação, indicando a existência de áreas de desova diferentes

das áreas de pesca (Souza, 2000; Salles, 2000).  Desde então, outras espécies

que não ocorrem nos bancos e ilhas oceânicas, como Lutjanus analis, L.

chrysurus e L synagris passaram a ser registradas pelas estatísticas oficiais, mas

provavelmente já eram exploradas anteriormente por uma frota essencialmente

artesanal.  Segundo Silva (1970), na composição específica dos desembarques

da frota de jangadas amostrada em seu estudo, na localidade do Pina em Recife-

PE, os Lutjanídeos foram agrupados na categoria denominada Cioba e afins.

Aparentemente, estoques de pargo L. purpureus concentram-se em áreas

específicas, como bancos oceânicos e pontos de quebra da plataforma

continental (Fonteles-Filho &amp;amp; Ferreira 1987), sustentando assim maiores capturas

porém por um intervalo de tempo menor. Estoques concentrados em feições

topográficas restritas, como em montanhas oceânicas, tendem ao colapso rápido,

geralmente após 10 anos de pescarias (Koslow et al., 2000).

O cenário da pesca dos Lutjanídeos para os estados do Nordeste indica

uma tendência decrescente, mas as atuais análises são limitadas pela qualidade

e confiabilidade das estatísticas oficiais consideradas.

Os principais problemas que a estatística pesqueira nacional tem sofrido, e

com ela os pesquisadores da pesca, são: (a) descontinuidade da coleta de dados

confiáveis; (b) falta de padronização e correspondência entre os estados quanto

aos nomes das categorias de pescado e espécies equivalentes; (c) falta de

padronização na metodologia de cálculo entre os estados; (d) tratamento dos

dados de forma multi-específica para as categorias de pescado. Além disso, a

publicação de dados repetidos nos anos de 1990 a 1995 e a diferenças na

metodologia aplicada pela BAHIAPESCA e o ESTATPESCA interromperam a

seqüência histórica além de impossibilitar comparações entre regiões ou estados.

Outro problema é o fato de que os dados são relativos apenas à produção, o que

limita as observações das tendências da pesca que devem ter incorporado

variações significativas do esforço de pesca no período analisado (Rezende &amp;amp;

Ferreira, 2000).

Em praticamente todo o período analisado, o estado do Ceará foi o que

apresentou as maiores capturas de Lutjanídeos.  Nos estados de Pernambuco e

Rio Grande do Norte esses recursos pesqueiros encontram-se praticamente

comercialmente extintos, o que passa a exigir a tomada de um elenco de ações

corretivas.  O estado que apresenta uma situação aparentemente otimista é a

Bahia, embora as capturas se concentrem na guaiúba e ariacó.

Entre os diferentes recursos pesqueiros discriminados pelas estatísticas

pesqueiras para a região Nordeste, no período analisado, apenas as lagostas e

pargo têm sido inseridos em Grupos Permanentes de Estudo (GPE), gerando

desta forma informações mais detalhadas sobre produção, esforço de pesca e

captura por unidade de esforço (CPUE).  Adotado desde a década de 70, o GPE

do pargo tem-se dedicado a definir e executar o regulamento da pesca desta

espécie através do estabelecimento de um tamanho mínimo de captura em

função da maturidade sexual.

Indícios de sobrepesca sobre o comprimento médio populacional e sobre o

tamanho de primeira reprodução já foram relatados para o “pargo”.

A participação de cinco espécies diferentes nas capturas da categoria

“pargo”, sem o registro oficial para estas espécies separadamente, impossibilita

quaisquer avaliações de estoque mais confiáveis.  Bons programas de obtenção

de dados estatísticos pesqueiros das capturas e oficialmente publicados são de

grande valia para a aplicação com sucesso de modelos de produção e rendimento

pesqueiro, dando segurança para a tomada de decisões de manejo sustentável

das pescarias.

Recentemente, a American Fisheries Society reconheceu que os

Lutjanídeos devem ser submetidos a um sistema gerencial preventivo de modo a

se evitar situações de sobrepesca e colapso dos estoques (Coleman et al., 2000).

Esta recomendação se baseou na constatação de que as espécies dos gêneros

Etelis, Lutjanus e Rhomboplites são reconhecidas como de grande longevidade e

crescimento lento (Polovina &amp;amp; Ralston 1987) e, portanto, seus estoques não

suportam níveis de mortalidade por pesca muito mais elevados que os níveis da

mortalidade natural. Resultados de estudos sobre idade, crescimento e

mortalidade das cinco espécies de Lutjanídeos mais importantes na Zona

Econômica Exclusiva da costa nordeste do Brasil confirmam as características

citadas para as espécies destes gêneros (Programa REVIZEE/NE, 2003).

Concluindo, a criação de um grupo específico de estudos e uma política de

obtenção de estatísticas pesqueiras de qualidade são medidas altamente

recomendáveis como forma de garantir o uso sustentável dos recursos

pesqueiros da região Nordeste do Brasil.
