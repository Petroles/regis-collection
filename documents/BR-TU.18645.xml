Abstract

Rapid Ecological Assessment protocols are important tools for the training of postgraduate students, as well as the 
collection of data on poorly-known and protected areas with the potential for the preservation of water supplies for urban 
areas. The objective of this study was to perform a survey of water quality and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates 
in two sub-basins at the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge in the Brazilian state of Sergipe. The collection of data in the 
field, laboratory processing, and the interpretation and discussion of data were conducted in groups by students from two 
postgraduate programmes in Ecology and Conservation (UFMG and UFS), personnel of the state environment agency 
(SEMARH), school teachers from the local town of Capela, and members of the reserve’s voluntary fire brigade. The 
results of the assessment were organised, analysed, and presented at the reserve headquarters in the form of posters, 
for the development of environmental education activities with pupils from local schools, as well as contributing to 
a SEMARH seminar. Samples were characterised by distinct taxonomic compositions and diversity, as confirmed by 
MDS and additive partitioning of diversity analyses. The gravel substrate presented the lower mean taxonomic richness 
in each sampling unit (a

1
 = 28%), while the average difference among samples (b

1 
diversity) was elevated for both 

substrates (39% for leaf litter, 41% for gravel), reflecting the pronounced variation among samples, even adjacent 
ones within the same stream. Diversity between streams was lower in the case of leaf litter in comparison with gravel 
(b

2
 = 21 and 31%, respectively). A total of 57 fish specimens were collected with a predominance of individuals of the 

orders Characiformes (62%) and Perciformes (21%). This rapid ecological assessment confirmed the importance of 
the conservation unit and emphasised the need for its continuation, given its importance for the maintenance of water 
quality and its other ecological services, such as the conservation of the region’s aquatic biodiversity and providing 
the local town of Capela (circa 20,000 inhabitants) with its water supply, the Mata do Junco being its only source.

Keywords: in situ training, postgraduate programme, biodiversity conservation, protected areas.

1. Introduction

Protected areas are effective at safeguarding forest 
cover, when the principal objective is to conserve habitats 
and diversity, and avoid deforestation. However, reserves 
are not necessarily effective against hunting pressure, and 
are often too small to sustain viable populations of many 
species (Adeney et al., 2009). In Brazil, in addition, there is 
a scarcity of trained personnel, and most conservation units 
are under-staffed (Brooks et al., 2006; Mittermeir et al., 
2005), especially considering the need for data on species 
distributions and vulnerability, and the extinction risk of a 
representative subset of species (Hanson et al., 2009). There 
is a clear need for the provision of funding for specific 
training programmes at local universities (Scarano, 2007), 
as well as the development of management protocols for 
the orientation of local political leaderships.

The decision of the United Nations to promote 2010 
as the International Year of Biodiversity highlights the 
shortcomings between the urgency of the measures required 
and the current levels of commitment (Stuart et al., 2010). 
Young conservationists face an immensurable biodiversity 
crisis, with current species extinction rates as much as 
one thousand times higher than background rates. Urgent 
investment in capacity-building is obviously needed, and 
this has been a priority in Brazil in recent years, where it has 
involved federal, state and local agencies and institutions, 
as well as NGOs, field technicians and managers of 
protected areas interested in conservation biology. The 
development of local leaderships and capacity-building 
initiatives has the potential to guarantee the success of 
conservation initiatives in terms of the area protected, 
reduction in deforestation rates and population decline, 
as well as influencing policy-making and legislation at 
local, regional, and national levels.

Little is known of the diversity of tropical “hotspots” 
(Myers et al., 2000) in comparison with their temperate 
counterparts (Boyero, 2000; Yule et al., 2010), especially 
when it comes to their aquatic systems. Tropical forests 
contain the majority of terrestrial species diversity, and 
the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome is a prominent hotspot, 
especially given that less than 3% of its original forest 
cover remains (Fonseca et al., 2007). Between one and 
two million square kilometres are deforested per decade 

worldwide, resulting in the release of considerable quantities 
of carbon into the atmosphere (Joppa et al., 2008). Despite 
its importance, the related loss of the water quality of aquatic 
systems is still relatively poorly understood (Brooks et al., 
2006). Fortunately, there is a growing assumption that 
Brazilian aquatic ecosystems are increasingly threatened 
by anthropogenic impacts (Pompeu et al., 2005; Moreno 
and Callisto, 2006; Moulton and Wantzen, 2006 and 
references therein).

Rapid bioassessment protocols are used to assess the 
biological quality of the water and the ecological integrity 
of aquatic ecosystems (Barbosa and Callisto, 2000). 
While these procedures offer the advantages of low cost 
and reduced time in the field and laboratory, they must 
be evaluated carefully in order to guarantee the quality 
of the data collected (Maltichik and Callisto, 2004). The 
taxonomic resolution of this type of analysis varies from 
genus to order. A higher resolution tends to be used in 
most studies, given its more favourable cost-benefit ratio 
in comparison with the identification of species (Buss 
and Vitorino, 2010).

In this context, an important recent initiative of the 
Brazilian Higher Education Authority (CAPES) has been 
the installation of a postgraduate exchange programme, 
which permits systematic interchange between postgraduate 
courses in different regions of the country. A programme 
was established between the postgraduate programmes 
in Ecology at the federal universities of Minas Gerais 
(UFMG), in southeastern Brazil, and Sergipe (UFS), in 
the northeast of the country. As part of the exchange, a 
short-term field course was conducted in March, 2010, 
at the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge in Sergipe, which 
protects an important area of Atlantic Forest, and in 
particular, the local population of the endangered endemic 
monkey, Callicebus coimbrai Kobayashi &amp;amp; Langguth, 1999. 
This course promoted collaboration between academic 
researchers, state and federal environment technicians, and 
postgraduate students. Assessment of aquatic ecosystems 
was based on the AquaRap approach (Mittermeier and 
Forsyth, 1992; Chernoff et al., 1996), which permits the 
reliable evaluation of a large number of sites during a short 
period of time (Barbosa and Callisto, 2000). The objective

diferentes, como mostraram as análises de ordenação MDS e de partição aditiva da diversidade. O substrato cascalho 
apresentou menor riqueza taxonômica média em cada unidade amostral (a

Perciformes (21%). Esta avaliação ecológica rápida corrobora a importância da criação e manutenção desta unidade 
de conservação, a fim de manter a boa qualidade de suas águas e serviços ecológicos, destacando-se a conservação da 
biodiversidade aquática e o abastecimento do município de Capela, com cerca de 20 mil habitantes que têm no RVS 
Mata do Junco seu único manancial de abastecimento de água.

of this study was to perform a survey of water quality and 
diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in two sub-basins, 
based on physical and chemical characteristics, diversity 
of macroinvertebrates and environmental education 
practices. It is hoped that these same areas will be included 
in long-term ecological monitoring programs, based on 
the collection of more detailed data, including more ample 
inventories and surveys, and biomonitoring procedures.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Study area

The Mata do Junco State Wildlife Refuge was created 
in 2007 with the primary objective of protecting the 
endangered primate C. coimbrai. The reserve is located 
in the 197.7 km2 basin of the Japaratuba river (10° 14’ 00” 
and 10° 48’ 00” S; 37° 18’ 00” and 36° 48’ 00” W), which 
is within planning unit 204, in the municipality of Capela, 
in the Brazilian state of Sergipe (Cunha, 2001). The Mata 
do Junco sub-basin is formed by 14 springs, only three of 
which are preserved. Six others have been altered, while the 
remaining five have been degraded, based on an analysis 
of the vegetation surrounding the spring, and the type of 
land use of the adjacent area (Ferreira et al., 2007).

The two sub-basins – Lagartixo and Bica do Estreiro – 
that originate within the conservation unit were evaluated 
in the present study. Five points were sampled in the 
Lagartixo sub-basin: P01 – spring in a semi-lentic reach 
with abundant deposits of leaf detritus; P02 – downstream 
from this spring, with extensive gallery forest; P03 – spring 
located in an area with limited anthropogenic impact; 
P04 – stream with dark-colored water, deposits of clay, 
downstream from P03; P05 – reach downstream from the 
catchment station of the Autonomous Water and Sewage 
Service (SAAE) of the municipality of Capela, formed by 
the confluence of the two springs. The other four points 
were located in the Bica do Estreito sub-basin: P06 – dark-
water stream adjacent to a bamboo stand; P07 – stream 
located downstream from the Bica do Estreito spring; 
P08 – stream within a bamboo stand, downstream of the 
confluence of points P06 and P07; P09 – narrow stream, 
after a dam, flows into the main stream at P08.

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Physical and chemical characteristics

A rapid assessment protocol for the evaluation of 
ecological conditions and habitat diversity in hydrographic 
basins, as proposed by Callisto et al. (2002a), was adopted 
for the present study. In addition, a qualitative survey of 
the vegetation in the surrounding area was conducted using 
a procedure adapted from Chagas (2009).

At the nine in situ sample points (P01-09), data on 
the pH, electrical conductivity, resistivity, temperature, 
and total dissolved solids in the water were collected 
using a multiparameter Yellow Springs apparatus. The air 
temperature, and the depth, width, and flow velocity of 
the stream reaches were also measured. In the laboratory, 

turbidity was analysed using a desktop turbidity-meter, total 
alkalinity was determined by the Gran method (Carmouze, 
1994), while dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured 
by the Winkler method. Water samples were collected 
for laboratory analysis in order to determine total-P and 
total-N

 
concentrations, following Golterman et al. (1978) 

and Mackereth et al. (1978), respectively.
Diversity of freshwater bioindicators
Samples of the organic (leaf litter deposits) and inorganic 

(gravel) substrates were collected from each stream. Both 
types of material are common in the two sub-basins. Five 
replicates of each substrate were randomly collected 
from each system (50 meters reach), using a Surber-type 
sampler with an area of 0.09 m2 and a 250 mm mesh. In 
the laboratory, the samples were washed in 250 mm-mesh 
sieves and all organisms were separated and identified to 
the family level.

A Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) analysis 
based on Bray-Curtis distances was used to determine 
whether the samples from the two types of substrate had 
distinct taxonomic composition. The difference between 
the richness and density of invertebrates associated with the 
leaf banks of the stream bottoms was evaluated statistically 
using a t-test. An additive partitioning analysis of diversity 
(as proposed by Veech et al., 2002) was applied separately to 
the data from each substrate with the objective of identifying 
the spatial scales that contribute most, proportionately, to 
total richness. The mean richness observed in the Surber 
samples was defined as the diversity on the lowest scale 
analysed (a

1
). The difference among samples was defined 

as b
1
 diversity, while the difference between streams was 

denominated b
2
 diversity.

The multimetric benthic index developed by Ferreira et al. 
(2011) was used for the evaluation of water quality. This 
index evaluates a set of benthic parameters (Richness, % 
Oligochaeta, % CHOL – Chironomidade + Oligochaeta, 
% EPT – Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, 
% collector-gatherers and BMWP-CETEC – Biological 
Monitoring Working Party). Each parameter is attributed a 
score (1, 3, or 5) according to the response of the organism 
to impact (Table 1). The index is the sum of these scores, 
which has a maximum possible value of 30. Scores are 
allocated to four categories of water quality: bad (6-12),

tion (Taxonomic richness, % Oligochaeta, % CHOL –

average (13-18), good (19-24), and very good (25-30). The 
benthic macroinvertebrate communities were classified in 
functional feeding groups according to the feeding strategies 
of these organisms in the ecosystems under analysis.

Samples of the benthic macroinvertebrates floating in 
the streams were collected using drift nets (2500 cm2 in 
area, with a 250 mm mesh), which were set for a period 
of 24 hours. Three drift nets were set in each stream, 
and differences between streams were evaluated through 
estimates of taxonomic richness, equitability (Pielou), 
diversity (Shannon-Wiener) and density (individuals per 
m3). The material collected in the nets was removed, washed 
in a sieve, processed, and identified in the laboratory. The 
width (m), depth (m), flow velocity (m/s), and discharge 
(m3/s) of the stream at each were measured. Differences 
between streams in the composition and diversity of the 
macroinvertebrate fauna were tested using Student’s t-test.

Qualitative samples of the local icthyofauna were 
collected at two points in each stream, P01 and P05 in 
the Lagartixo, and P06 and P08 in the Bica do Estreito. 
The fish were captured in D-shaped hand-nets (1 mm 
mesh) and 3 m-long trawls (1 m high, 1 mm mesh). The 
specimens collected were fixed in 10% formalin, weighed 
on a 0.01-g precision scale, measured, and identified. The 
analysis of the stomach contents of a sample of 39 fish 
was used as a complementary approach to the inventory 
of the local benthic macroinvertebrates. The stomachs 
were retrieved via ventral incision, and their contents 
were investigated under a magnifying glass. The benthic 
macroinvertebrates were separated and identified to the 
lowest taxonomic level (family).

2.2.2. Environmental education

A number of environmental education activities were 
conducted during the study period, involving pupils from 
four local schools (three municipal and one state-run). 
The pupils included children, adolescents, and adults 
with special needs. The activities were: a) presentation 
of a documentary on the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge; 
b) interactive exhibition using four different strategies: i) 
free drawing for the assessment of existing knowledge; ii) 
presentation of posters providing information on the principal 
bioindicator organisms and their habitat; iii) mobile collection 
of organisms preserved in alcohol; iv) flannelgraph, used 
for the assessment of the retention of information (metal 
panel simulating a river, the process of degradation, and 
its consequences for the aquatic community); c) game-
playing: “playing with the bioindicators of water quality”, 
to reinforce the retention of the material presented (game 
in the round, where the participants represent the aquatic 
community and a process of degradation is simulated, 
resulting in consequences for the ecosystem and the benthic 
organisms; d) field visit to the streams, using a simplified 
protocol for the characterisation of ecological conditions 
– adapted from Callisto et al. (2002a) – during which 
bioindicator organisms are collected and the conservation 
status of the aquatic ecosystem is discussed.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Physical and chemical features

The riparian vegetation within the study area presented 
three strata – arboreal, shrub, and herbaceous – with a 
canopy that varies in height between 12 and 23 m. The leaf 
litter was mostly homogeneous, with occasional deeper 
deposits. There was relatively little anthropogenic impact 
or erosion, although a number of exotic plant species 
– Bambusa vulgaris Schrad, Bambusa vulgaris vittata 
McClure, and Elaeis guineensis Jacq – were observed 
in both areas. The canopy is continuous on both stream 
sides, with few natural clearings.

The results of Callisto et al. (2002a) protocol applied in 
the studied area indicated the presence of few anthropogenic 
impacts, either adjacent to the streams or within the 
surrounding area. The aquatic ecosystems were classified 
by the protocol as natural, varying between 71 points 
for P04 and 95 points for P06. The principal factors 
determining the differences among sampling points were 
a) the presence of exotic plant species; b) instability of 
the margin (small areas of erosion); and c) sedimentary 
deposits on the bottom.

The waters were relatively acid, with pH values ranging 
from 5.01 at P01 to 6.17 at P06. The buffering capacity of 
the water (medium total alkalinity) was positive only at 
P02, P06, and P09 (9.08, 0.75, and 17.32 mEq/L of CO

2
, 

respectively), which appears to emphasise the fragility of 
the ecosystem (sensu Callisto et al., 1998).

Total dissolved solids and turbidity were relatively low, 
reflecting the well-preserved condition of the ecosystems, 
with well-developed riparian forest and few areas of 
erosion. High levels of turbidity were recorded only in the 
Lagartixo sub-basin (P04), where there is some evidence 
of disturbances prior to the creation of the conservation 
unit, and P09 (Bica do Estreito sub-basin), where a small 
dam had been constructed. Low Total-P and Total-N were 
found in both sub-basins (&lt;0.005 and&amp;lt;0.063, respectively).

Throughout the study area, with the exception of P04, 
the sediment acts as a nutrient sink, indicated by the positive 
values of the oxi-redox potential. The negative value 
recorded at P04 (–266 mV) reflects the type of sediment 
at this point, which is made up of very fine particles (clay), 
which may result in anoxia at the bottom of the water 
column (Table 2), corroborating Coiado (2004).

3.2. Diversity of freshwater bioindicators

A total of 1333 organisms were collected, representing 
32 families (Table 3). These included 28 families belonging 
to the class Insecta, two Crustacea, one Oligochaeta, and 
one Arachnida. The organic (leaf litter) substrate showed 
a much higher taxonomic richness (all 28 families) and 
abundance (1161 individuals) in comparison with the 
gravel substrate – 172 individuals representing 24 families.

The two substrates presented distinct taxonomic 
compositions, according to the NMS analysis (Figure 1). 
The availability of microhabitats appears to be an important 
factor determining of the composition of macroinvertebrate

communities (Costa and Melo, 2008), and the difference 
observed between the two substrate types in the present 
study appear to further confirm this pattern. The partition 
analysis revealed a distinct distribution of diversity by 
substrate type (Figure 2).

Gravel showed the lowest mean richness per Surber 
(a

1
 = 28%), which indicates that the samples were poorly 

representative of the region’s total taxonomic richness. 
The b

1
 diversity was relatively high for both substrates, 

however – 39% for leaves and 41% for gravel – which 
indicates considerable variation among points, despite 
their relative proximity.

The leaf litter in the Bica do Estreito is formed mainly 
by bamboo leaves, which fall into the stream (only 10 leaf 
morphotypes were found in the litter at the bottom of this 
stream). By contrast, the riparian vegetation of the Lagartixo 
sub-basin is typical of well-preserved Atlantic Forest. 
This determines the difference in the leaf litter found in 
this stream, which is characterized by a higher number of 
leaf morphotypes – 25 in all. However, this difference in 
the composition of the detritus and leaf biomass was not 
reflected in any major difference in the macroinvertebrate 
communities of the two sub-basins, as indicated by the 
NMS arrangement and the low diversity between streams 
(b

2
 = 21% for the leaf substrate). In addition, neither the 

richness nor abundance of the leaf banks varied significantly 
between streams (Figure 3), which indicates that, until 
now, the presence of bamboo on the banks of the Bica do 

Estreito has not had a significant impact on the benthic 
community. The b

2
 diversity was greater for gravel (31%), 

which indicates greater heterogeneity between streams for 
this type of substrate.

Biotic index
The biotic benthic index applied in the present study 

indicated that both sub-basins had very good water

quality (total score = 30). This score was based on the 
high taxonomic richness of the area, in addition to the 
presence of a number of organisms that are sensitive to 
pollution and other anthropogenic impacts, such as larvae 
of the orders Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera. 
The importance of the taxonomic richness as a metric that 
reflects the diversity of benthic organisms and the health 
of freshwaters is well known (Ferreira et al., 2011).

 Collector-gatherers and collector-filterers, which feed 
on fine particles of organic matter, predominated in both 
areas (Figure 4). The proportion of predators was slightly 
higher (14%) in the Bica do Estreito in comparison with the 
Lagartixo (10%), although the proportions of grazers were 
slightly reversed. According to Tomanova et al. (2006), the 
gathering-collectors are frequently the dominant trophic 
group in tropical streams because of the abundance of 
resources produced by the rapid degradation of allochthonous 
organic matter.

Drifting invertebrates
A total of 137 invertebrate specimens were collected 

in the drift nets, representing 18 taxa: Baetidae (29), 
Calopterygidae (2), Ceratopogonidae (4), Chironomidae (12), 
Coenagrionidae (1), Elmidae (6), Gerridae (4), Hidracarina 
(17), Hydropsychidae (1), Hydroptilidae (1), Leptoceridae 
(4), Leptophlebiidae (5), Philopotamidae (5), Scirtidae 
(14), Simuliidae (18), Stenochiromus (5), Tipulidae (1), 
and Veliidae (8). Once again, no significant differences 
were found in the composition or community structure 
of these organisms between the two sub-basins, although 
some groups were restricted to one or a few sample points. 
While the discharge of the Bica do Estreito was greater, 
density was slightly higher in the Lagartixo (Table 4).

Ichthyofauna
A total of 57 fishes were collected during the present 

study. These specimens represented eight different species 
distributed in seven genera belonging to seven different 
families, and five orders. Almost two-thirds (62%) of 
the specimens belonged to the order Characiformes, 
followed by Perciformes (21%), Synbranchiformes (11%), 

Siluriformes (3%), and Gymnotiformes (3%). While 
Neotropical aquatic ecosystems tend to be dominated 
by siluriforms and characiforms (Castro, 1999), only the 
latter predominated in the present study. In general, the 
species identified in the present study were typical of 
those found in other hydrographic basins, such as those 
of the Rio São Francisco (Alves and Pompeu, 2010) and 
Rio Grande (Castro et al., 2004).

The scarcity of siluriform fish may be related to the 
preference of these animals for specific types of habitat, 
where they normally seek refuge during the course of the day. 
In addition, fish may often be relatively rare in headwater 
streams, such as those studied here (Tupinambás et al., 
2007). Obviously, a more comprehensive inventory of 
the ichthyofauna of the streams surveyed here and the rest 
of the Japaratuba basin would require the collection of a 
much more systematic sample, including a much longer 
period, covering seasonal variations in climate, and the

use of additional capture techniques, such as seine nets 
and electric fishing (Castro et al., 2004).

For the analysis of stomach contents, the 39 specimens 
included 22 Astyanax gr. bimaculatus (Linnaeus, 1758) 
(Characidae), eight Geophagus brasilienses (Quoy &amp;amp; 
Gaimard, 1824) (Cichlidae), four Synbranchus marmoratus 
Bloch, 1795 (Symbranchidae), two Gymnotus carapo 
Linnaeus, 1758 (Gymnotidae), and one each of the species 
Hoplias malabaricus (Boch, 1794) (Erythrinidae), Rhamdia 
quelen (Quoy &amp;amp; Gaimard, 1824) (Pimelodidae), and 
Callichthys callichthys (Linnaeus, 1758) (Callichthyidae). 
Benthic macroinvertebrates were found in the stomachs of 
all the specimens, except that of H. malabaricus, which 
had an empty stomach.

Nine benthic invertebrate taxa were identified in the 
stomach contents of these specimens: Ostracoda, Hidracarina, 
Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, Simuliidae, Tipulidae, 
Libellulidae, Calamoceratidae, and Pyralidae. The taxonomic 
richness of these organisms was relatively low in comparison 
with the results of other studies based on a similar approach 
(Callisto et al., 2002b; Tupinambás et al., 2007). For more 
reliable and conclusive data on these parameters, a much 
larger sample of fish would be required, in particular of 
benthophagous species, which were not collected in the 
present study and would increase the inventory of aquatic 
insects (Fagundes et al., 2008).

Training in environmental education
A total of 34 pupils were involved in the three visits to 

the study area. These visits were based on the concept that 
“socialisation of successful experiences in the divulgation 
of scientific knowledge on water through the ‘Bioindicators 
of Water Quality’ programme, which is based on the 
production and distribution of informative material on 
methods and applications of game-playing”. Given the 
assumption that environmental education aims primarily at 
the development of “citizenship”, the use of a game-playing 
approach is especially important because it transforms 
information on environmental problems into a simple and 
attractive format, capable of increasing the efficiency of 
the process (Giron, 1992).

All the pupils classified the area as natural, based on 
scores of between 80 and 96 points. By visiting this well-
preserved spring, the pupils were able to both develop a 
sense of responsibility, and better understand the conditions 
of the watercourses of this sub-basin as a whole.

The type of activity developed during the present 
study, which involved lecturers and students from different 
institutions, environmental protection agencies, and the 
local community, represents an efficient strategy for the 
practical application of the knowledge accrued in the 
classroom, with major benefits for all parties involved.

Validation of multi – and interdisciplinary experiences
The activities developed during the field course by 

the 20 students from the two postgraduate programmes 
in ecology and conservation (UFMG and UFS), members 
of the local community, and personnel of the government 
environment agencies resulted in extensive interaction and 
the exchange of multi – and inter-disciplinary experiences. 
The study provided a preliminary evaluation of the 
environmental quality of the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge, 
applying a rapid ecological assessment approach to the 
investigation of two sub-basins, and their aquatic habitats. 
This initiative provided the first ecological parameters for 
the basin of the Japaratuba river, as well as contributing 
towards the development of local environmental education 
strategies. The experience was further the basis of a series 
of recommendations for the development of public policies 
in the state, involving institutions such as UFS, EMBRAPA 
(Federal Agricultural Research Agency) and SEMARH.
