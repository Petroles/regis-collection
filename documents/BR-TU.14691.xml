Potential of human bone marrow derived stem cells combined with 
chitosan based biodegradable scaffolds for bone tissue engineering 
 
ABSTRACT 
 Bone tissue engineering has emerged as a promising alternative in cases of 

bone loss, overcoming problems of rejection and donor scarcity associated to the 

clinical used bone grafts (autografts, allografts and xenografts). By combining three-

dimensional structures (3D) – scaffolds, autologous cells and growth factors, bone 

tissue engineering seeks to achieve a long lasting and fully functional regeneration of 

bone. The selected scaffold should be biodegradable, allowing cells to adhere, 

proliferate and differentiate into the osteogenic phenotype, producing a mineralized 

extracellular matrix (ECM), to be later implanted into the bone defect. The rate of 

degradation of the scaffold should, therefore, be compatible to the rate of neo-tissue 

ingrowth. 

 The rationale of the experimental work of this thesis was designed to study a 

bone tissue engineering strategy by combining chitosan based scaffolds and human 

bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), aiming bone tissue regeneration. 

 Blends of chitosan with different types aliphatic polyesters were produced by 

extrusion. Afterwards, scaffolds were produced by compression molding followed by 

salt leaching. Several scaffolds formulations were produced and subjected to 

cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility tests, allowing selecting the most suitable 

formulation in terms of biological response. From the results obtained, the chitosan-

poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) formulation presented the most promising results in in 

vitro cell studies with relevant cell lines. To understand why this formulation has 

enhanced cell performance, several formulations using different percentages of 

chitosan (0, 25 and 50%) and PBS (100, 75 and 50%) were used to produce 

scaffolds. The influence of chitosan content was evaluated with hBMSCs in vitro. All 

in vitro results evidenced a better performance for the highest chitosan containing 

scaffolds, as for cell adhesion and proliferation, as for osteogenic differentiation. 

Scaffolds containing chitosan (50% chitosan-50% PBS) and without chitosan (100% 

PBS) were implanted in different anatomic regions (cranial defect, auricular pocket 

and submuscular) of rats. The tissue response was evaluated by studying the 

inflammatory response to the implanted scaffolds. Again, scaffolds with higher 

chitosan amounts evidenced superior results, with a mild inflammatory response 



 xii 

without cell necrosis, in vivo, as compared to PBS scaffolds, that evidenced tissue 

necrosis in all implantation regions. 

 A different morphology of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was developed by fiber 

bonding to improve the porous structure. These scaffolds were clearly non-cytotoxic 

and cytocompatible. Furthermore, chitosan-PBS scaffolds seeded and cultured with 

hBMSCs in osteogenic conditions, showed an excellent cell performance. 

 The biodegradation of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was assessed in vitro using 

enzymes responsible for the degradation of chitosan (lysozyme) and PBS (lipase), in 

similar concentrations to the ones found in human body. The cocktail of both 

enzymes induced a superior effect on the scaffolds biodegradation. The in vivo 

biodegradation and biocompatibility of the scaffolds were evaluated. The in vivo 

model applied to this study was the rat subcutaneous model. Results showed that the 

in vivo degradation was much slower than in vitro. The host tissue response was the 

typically associated with biomaterials? implantation, with the presence of foreign body 

giant cells and an inflammatory response that progressed over time. The in vivo 

response was similar to those observed for biodegradable fixation devices or 

bioresorbable sutures. 

 The final study included in this thesis was performed to confirm the tissue 

engineering strategy followed in this work. The potential of chitosan-PBS scaffolds 

combined with hBMSCs, as previously demonstrated, was studied in a relevant 

animal model. A critical size cranial defect in nude mice was used. This model 

allowed evaluating the in vivo matured construct using human cells. The results 

showed that constructs were able to promote bone regeneration in a superior level 

than scaffolds without cells. The strategy followed under the scope of this PhD thesis 

was successfully validated in this small animal model, using a combination of 

chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds with hBMSCs.

Potencial de células estaminais de medula óssea associadas a 
scaffolds biodegradáveis à base de quitosano para engenharia de 
tecido ósseo. 
 
RESUMO 
 A área de engenharia de tecidos ósseos surgiu como uma alternativa de 

tratamento em casos clínicos de perdas ósseas, evitando problemas de rejeição e 

morbidez associada a enxertos ósseos obtidos do próprio paciente. Combinando 

estruturas tridimensionais (3D) porosas, células autólogas e factores de crescimento, 

a engenharia de tecidos ósseos visa encontrar soluções para a regeneração de osso 

neste tipo de pacientes. O suporte 3D seleccionado deverá ser biodegradável, 

permitindo a adesão, proliferação e diferenciação osteogénica das células, de forma 

a produzir uma matriz extracelular mineralizada, sendo posteriormente implantada 

no defeito ósseo. A taxa de degradação do suporte 3D poroso deverá ser compatível 

com a taxa de regeneração do tecido ósseo. 

 O objectivo do trabalho experimental desenvolvido nesta tese foi planeado 

de forma validar uma estratégia de engenharia de tecidos ósseos, através da 

combinação de suportes 3D porosos biodegradáveis à base de quitosano e células 

estaminais adultas de origem humana obtidas a partir de medula óssea.  

 Neste trabalho foram produzidas várias misturas de quitosano com 

diferentes tipos de poliésteres alifáticos usando a técnica de extrusão. Usando estas 

misturas desenvolveram-se suportes tridimensionais que foram processados por 

moldação por compressão com partículas de sacrifício de sal. As misturas 

produzidas foram avaliadas em termos de citotoxicidade e citocompatibilidade. Desta 

forma, foi possível seleccionar a formulação mais adequada em termos de resposta 

biológica. A formulação de quitosano e polibutileno succinato (PBS) foi a formulação 

seleccionada para posterior desenvolvimento da estratégia de engenharia de 

tecidos. Por ter tido consistentemente os melhores resultados biológicos in vitro, a 

mistura seleccionada foi usada para produzir suportes porosos contendo diferentes 

percentagens de quitosano (0, 25 and 50%) e PBS, de forma a estudar a importância 

do quitosano nas formulações. A influência da percentagem de quitosano nos 

suportes porosos foi avaliada através de estudos in vitro com culturas primárias de 



 xiv 

células estaminais mesenquimais de origem humana. Os resultados celulares 

obtidos mostraram um melhor desempenho em termos de adesão e proliferação, 

assim como na diferenciação osteogénica das células nos suportes 3D com maior 

percentagem de quitosano. Tendo-se observado uma maior eficácia no desempenho 

biológico dos suportes porosos contendo quitosano, interessava confirmar estes 

resultados in vivo, tendo como controlo suportes sem quitosano, só com PBS. 

Suportes porosos sem quitosano e com quitosano (50%), uma vez que foram 

aqueles para os quais se obteve o pior e o melhor comportamento celular in vivo 

respectivamente, foram implantados em diferentes regiões anatómicas (defeito 

craniano, implantação auricular e submuscular) em ratos. A resposta inflamatória foi 

avaliada, tendo os suportes porosos com quitosano evidenciado uma resposta 

inflamatória moderada, não se observando necrose celular. Suportes porosos com 

apenas PBS na sua constituição, mostraram necrose celular em todos os locais 

anatómicos implantados.  

 O passo seguinte passou por optimizar a morfologia  dos suportes, tendo 

sido neste caso desenvolvida uma estrutura porosa de malha de fibras de quitosano 

e PBS, por compressão a quente. Estes suportes porosos foram avaliados e 

confirmou-se também que não eram citotóxicos e que eram citocompatíveis. 

Adicionalmente, foram cultivadas células primárias humanas de medula óssea 

nestas estruturas tridimensionais, em condições de diferenciação osteogénica, 

mostrando um excelente desempenho in vitro. A biodegradação destes suportes 

porosos de quitosano-PBS foi estudada usando enzimas responsáveis pela 

degradação do quitosano (lisozima) e PBS (lipase) em concentrações idênticas às 

encontradas no corpo humano. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que um cocktail 

das duas enzimas teve um efeito pronunciado no que respeita à taxa de degradação 

dos suportes porosos. O estudo foi complementado pela análise da biodegradação e 

biocompatibilidade dos suportes tridimensionais in vivo. O modelo in vivo escolhido 

para este estudo foi o implante subcutâneo em ratos. Os resultados obtidos 

mostraram que a taxa de degradação in vivo foi consideravelmente menor 

comparativamente com os estudos efectuados in vitro. A resposta in vivo foi 

semelhante à observada em implantes de placas de fixação óssea biodegradáveis 

ou em suturas bioabsorvíveis.  

 O último estudo incluído nesta tese foi realizado para confirmar a estratégia 

de engenharia de tecidos proposta neste trabalho: a associação de suportes porosos 

biodegradáveis de quitosano e PBS e células estaminais humanas de medula óssea 



 xv 

diferenciadas para a linhagem osteogénica. O potencial desta estratégia foi 

estudado num modelo animal relevante: um defeito craniano de tamanho crítico em 

ratinhos imunocomprometidos. Este modelo permitiu avaliar o efeito da implantação 

dos suportes porosos cultivados com células humanas naqueles defeitos ósseos. Os 

resultados obtidos mostraram que esta associação de suportes porosos de 

quitosano-PBS com células humanas pré-cultivados in vitro em condições 

osteogénicas, promoveram regeneração óssea de uma forma mais significativa 

quando comparados com suportes porosos implantados sem células. A estratégia de 

engenharia de tecidos seguida no âmbito desta tese de doutoramento, através da 

combinação de suportes porosos de quitosano-PBS e células estaminais humanas 

de medula óssea foi validada com sucesso neste modelo animal de pequeno porte.

SHORT CURRICULUM VITAE 
 

 Ana Rita da Costa Pinto was born on December 22nd of December of 1980, in 

Felgueiras, Portugal. She is currently a PhD candidate at the 3B?s Research Group 

(Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics), University of Minho, Portugal. Her 

doctoral work has been supervised by Professors Nuno Neves and Rui L. Reis 

(Director of 3B?s Research Group). She has just submitted her PhD thesis on 

Biomedical Engineering to the University of Minho.  

 She obtained her Bachelor of Science in Applied Biology from the University 

of Minho in 2003, with a final grade of 15 (0-20 scale). As her senior research project 

she spent one year at the Instituto de Genética Médica Jacinto de Magalhães, under 

the supervision of Professor Laura Vilarinho, with her research project graded with 18 

(0-20 scale).  

 In October 2005, she formally started her PhD at the 3B?s Research Group 

where she has been working on the development of a bone tissue engineering 

strategy, using human bone marrow stem cells and chitosan-based scaffolds. During 

this time she has been abroad, under european projects collaborations, in Rome, 

Italy, under the supervision of Professor Paolo Bianco and in Ankara, Turkey, under 

the supervision of Professor Erhan Piskin. She was also mentor of several 

undergraduate students, with different projects. During her PhD work, she has 

acquired a firm foundation of knowledge and experience with cell isolation, culture 

and characterization of stem cells from different sources, such as bone marrow and 

umbilical cord. She has also received training with in vivo animal models, related with 

tissue engineering strategies.  

 

 She also has been also involved in the writing and preparation of several 

grants proposals, both at National (Portuguese Foundation for Science and 

Technology) and European levels (Framework Programme VI). 

 

 As a result of her research she attended the most important international 

conferences in the field of Biomaterials, Tissue Engineering and Regenerative 

Medicine. She was awarded with two awards for the best communication in two 

meetings. Presently, she is the first author of 5 papers in international journals (2 

published and 4 submitted).

STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS 
 

 This thesis is divided in six sections containing eight chapters, being five of 

them experimental work. The structure of the thesis was adopted having in mind the 

final objective of this PhD research, leading to a successful bone tissue engineering 

strategy. The experimental part was divided in 3 sections, 3, 4 and 5. In each of 

these sections it is described each one of the phases of the work developed in this 

thesis. The contents of each section are summarized below. 

 

 

SECTION 1 (Chapter I) 

 Chapter I is based on a review paper, presenting an overview on bone tissue 
engineering using chitosan based scaffolds. Bone biology is briefly analyzed to clarify 

the role of the various components required to achieve a successful bone tissue 

engineering strategy. These components are discussed in detail, covering from the 

type of scaffold to the in vivo proof of concept. The choice of cells, type of biomaterial 

used to produce the scaffold and its in vivo validation, as well as the type of animal 

models are also presented. In all these aspects, a special attention was given to 

chitosan as a suitable biomaterial to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. It 

is also included a review of the literature on the different types of chitosan processing 

methodologies. The review also discusses the reports in vitro and in vivo on bone 

tissue engineering strategies using chitosan. 

 

 

SECTION 2 (Chapter II) 
 Chapter II presents the materials and experimental procedures used in the 

present thesis. This chapter contains additional information about the experimental 

methods used in the various chapters of the thesis. Furthermore, it aims also at 

providing a general framework for the testing of new tissue engineering strategies in 

a comprehensive and structured way.  

 
 

SECTION 3 (Chapters III and IV)  

 Chapter III describes the in vitro testing of scaffolds produced with various 
chitosan-polyester formulations (PBS, PCL and PBTA) using in all cases the same 



 xlviii 

percentage of chitosan (50% wt). The scaffolds were processed by compression 

molding and particulate leaching. The eventual cytotoxicity of extracts from the 

scaffolds is evaluated with a L929 cell line. This chapter also presents the results of 

the first biological evaluation of these scaffolds, by using a mouse MSC cell line 

(BMC9) to select the most adequate scaffold formulation for bone tissue engineered 

applications. These in vitro results evidenced a superior performance for chitosan-

poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds. The next step aimed at clarifying why this specific 

scaffold formulation evidenced a superior cell performance. 
 

 Chapter IV presents further in vitro studies using primary cultures of human 

MSCs differentiated into the osteogenic lineage on scaffolds produced with different 

chitosan percentages (0, 25 and 50%). The in vitro results allowed concluding that 

chitosan containing scaffolds have stronger biological performance than 100% PBS 

scaffolds. This work also reports an experimental design to assess the in vivo effect 

of the chitosan, by implanting the scaffolds without and with 50% chitosan. The trend 

already observed in vitro was further confirmed in vivo, showing that the chitosan 

containing scaffolds elicit a milder inflammatory response and no signs of tissue 

necrosis when compared with scaffolds of PBS (without chitosan). 
 

 

SECTION 4 (Chapters V and VI) 
 Chapter V reports the results of the in vitro testing of scaffolds produced by 

fiber bonding, with an optimized porous morphology and with the formulation having 

the strongest performance in previous experiments (chitosan-PBS 50% wt). These 

scaffolds have enhanced porosity and interconnectivity, facilitating the cell ingrowth. 

In fact, the previous in vitro results obtained in chapter IV evidenced some difficulty of 

the cells to penetrate the porous structure of the scaffolds produced by compression 

molding/salt leaching. The results obtained in vitro using human MSCs differentiated 

into the osteogenic lineage evidenced a superior cell ingrowth throughout the entire 

scaffolds structure. This evidence showed that the optimized morphology indeed was 

able to facilitate the cell migration into the porous structure of the scaffold. 

  

 Chapter VI reports the results of the study of the biodegradation of the 

scaffolds previously tested in chapter V, both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies 

were intended to model the degradation in vivo, using specific enzymes. The 



 xlix 

selected enzymes (lysozyme and lipase) are known to degrade the two polymers 

used to produce the scaffolds. The concentrations of enzymes used in vitro were 

similar to those found in the human serum, to predict the degradation of the 

developed scaffolds. The in vivo analysis was performed to assess the 

biodegradation of the scaffolds and to compare its kinetics with the one obtained in 

the in vitro results. Furthermore, it was also evaluated the tissue response to the 

implantation of the new scaffold morphology, comparing the inflammatory response 

with the one previously obtained for the scaffolds with similar composition but with 

different porous morphology. 

 

 

SECTION 5 (Chapter VII) 

 Chapter VII describes the in vivo validation of the tissue engineering strategy 
proposed in this thesis. After studying the in vitro performance and the in vivo tissue 

response of the developed scaffolds, in the context of bone tissue engineering, it was 

necessary to demonstrate if the strategy would be effective in a relevant in vivo 

model. For that, it was used an orthotopic model in the calvaria of nude mice to verify 

if pre-cultured human bone MSCs on chitosan-PBS scaffolds were able to stimulate 

bone regeneration in vivo. The scaffolds used in this model were produced by 

compression molding and salt leaching, being the preferred morphology enabling 

producing a scaffold with the geometry required to fit into the bone defect used.  

 

 

SECTION 6 (Chapter VIII) 
 Chapter VIII contains the general conclusions and final remarks regarding 

the series of studies performed under the scope of this thesis. It is intended to 

provide a general summing up of the conclusions extracted in the various sections 

and allowing a complete analysis of the progress obtained in the framework of this 

thesis.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
 
ABSTRACT 

 As life expectancy increases, malfunction or loss of tissue caused by injury or disease 

leads to reduced quality of life in many patients at significant socio-economic cost. Even 

though major progresses have been made in the field of bone tissue engineering during the 

last few years, current therapies such as bone grafts still have limitations. Current research 

on biodegradable polymers is emerging, combining these structures with osteogenic cells, as 

an alternative to autologous bone grafts.  

 Different types of biodegradable materials have been proposed to be used as three-

dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Among them, natural 

polymers are one of the most attractive options, mainly due to their similarities with 

extracellular matrix (ECM), chemical versatility, good biological performance and inherent 

cellular interactions. In this review, special attention is given to chitosan as a biomaterial for 

bone tissue engineering. An extensive literature survey was performed about the processing 

of chitosan scaffolds and its biological performance in vitro as well as its in vivo bone 

regeneration potential.  

 The present review also aims to offer the reader a general overview on all 
components needed to engineer new bone tissue, giving a brief background on bone biology, 

followed by an explanation of all components in bone tissue engineering, as well as 

describing different tissue engineering strategies. Moreover, it will be exploited the typical 

model to evaluate the in vitro functionality of a tissue engineered construct and the in vivo 

models to assess the potential to regenerate bone tissue.  

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

 Bone tissue, when injured, leads to dramatic changes in the quality of life of patients. 

It can limit the ability to perform basic tasks, such as walking and frequently causes social 

and psychological problems. The current clinical available solutions for these problems rely 

on bone graft transplants (autologous, allogenous and xenogenic), bone transport methods 

(Ilizarov technique) and implants based on different types of materials. More than 2.2 million 

bone graft procedures (autologous bone graft and banked bone) take place annually 



CHAPTER I. Introduction

worldwide (1, 2). Those procedures ensure adequate bone healing in many skeletal 

problems, such as non-union fractures, cervical and lumbar spine fusion, joint arthrodesis or 

revision arthroplasty. Bone grafting is a strong and mature business generating sales of more 

than $2.5 billion a year (3). Autografts are considered the gold standard for bone repair. 

However, some complications may occur, such as bone non-unions and blood loss, which 

increases the need for blood transfusions (4-7). Moreover, besides being an expensive 

procedure, there is a limited supply of tissue and it causes significant donor site morbidity (6, 

8). Allografts are typically non-vital (dead) bone harvested from a cadaver and then 

processed using a freeze-drying method that extracts all the water via a vacuum drying 

process. These type of grafts avoid donor site morbidity, but present a potential risk for 

disease transmission and severe immune response by the patient (9). Similar to allogeneic 

bone, xenogenic bone is non-vital bone derived from other species, mainly from bovine 

origin. Because the potential for immune rejection and contamination by viral proteins is 

higher in bovine bone than in human cadaver bone, xenograft material is processed at very 

high temperatures. The Ilizarov methodology consists of an osteotomy followed by bone 

distraction by extendable fixation devices. This technique avoids problems related with the 

osteointegration of bone grafts, but requires longer periods of treatment (12-18 months) and 

can be quite painful for the patient (10). The aforementioned limitations justify the need to 

develop new therapies using alternative concepts that are currently the focus of intense 

research efforts. 

 Bone has a notable regenerative ability but a considerable amount of bone loss or the 

development of an adverse microenvironment can hinder this capacity, such in cases of 

severe trauma, developmental deformities, revision surgeries and tumor resection (11, 12). In 

these cases, bone tissue engineering holds the promise of great therapeutic potential (13). 

Bone tissue engineering may constitute the needed breakthrough technology to solve the 

problem of bone shortage in various destructive clinical conditions and deformities, by 

providing functional tissue engineered biological substitutes (14). The most promising 

strategy used in this field is based on the seeding and in vitro culture of primary osteoblasts 

or adult stem cells, differentiated into the osteogenic phenotype on three-dimensional (3D) 

scaffolds (synthetic, natural or ceramics). These constructs will be further implanted into a 

bone defect. The cells will synthesize the ECM of the new bone tissue, while the scaffold will 

provide the adequate 3D environment for the cells to adhere, proliferate and differentiate. 

The scaffolds will be not only temporary 3D supports for the cells to create new bone, but 

also space filling and local controlled release devices of signaling molecules. To accomplish 

all these goals, the scaffold should meet stringent requirements, such as biodegradability at 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 7 

such rate that is compatible to the rate of new tissue formation. Other important properties 

include the biocompatibility with host tissues, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity, 

appropriate mechanical properties, adequate porosity and morphology (15-17). All these 

properties are essential to facilitate and guide cell ingrowth, transport of gases, metabolites, 

nutrients and signaling molecules, both within the scaffold and between the scaffold and the 

native local environment. 

 The selection of the most suitable material to produce a scaffold to be used in bone 

tissue engineering applications is a determinant step, since its properties will determine its 

final characteristics. Biodegradable polymers, either synthetic or natural, are the most 

appropriate substrates for the cells to attach, grow and maintain a differentiated phenotype. 

In the last years, natural origin polymers have been increasingly proposed for the referred 

application. In our group, we have been working with natural based polymers, such as starch 

(18-22), chitosan (23-27), gellan gum (28-31), soy (32) or silk (33, 34). Our strategy is to 

mimic nature and, for that, we have been using those polymers to design functional 

microenvironments stimulating tissue morphogenesis. In particular, chitosan has shown an 

excellent combination of properties and it has been demonstrated that it is a suitable 

biomaterial to develop scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Chitosan can be used either 

alone (23, 35-41) or in combination with other biodegradable polymers, such as aliphatic 

polyesters (25, 42-47), other natural polymers such as starch (26, 48, 49) or silk (50, 51), or 

with ceramics, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) (24, 52-60). 

 This manuscript aims to provide an overview of the most important concepts in bone 

tissue engineering and a review on chitosan based scaffolds proposed in the literature to 

regenerate bone tissue. The potential of this biomaterial as a suitable substrate to support 

osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will also be explored. 

 

2. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF BONE BIOLOGY 

 Bone is a dynamic and complex tissue evolving and adapting to various stimuli 

throughout the entire lifetime (61). It plays crucial roles in both mechanical support and 

mineral homeostasis (62). Within a skeletal element, there are different morphologies of 

bone, such as cortical and trabecular bone. Cortical bone is a compact structural tissue, with 

only 10% porosity, being 80% of the mass of an adult human skeleton. Trabecular bone is a 

spongy structure with 50-90% porosity, filled with bone marrow. The majority of bones are 

covered by a highly vascularized fibrous connective tissue, the periosteum (63). Five different 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 8 

cell types are involved in bone maintenance and remodeling: MSCs, bone-lining cells, 

osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Within the bone structure, MSCs are found in the 

bone marrow (64-67) and also in the periosteum (68). The bone marrow is composed of 

hematopoietic tissue and the supporting stroma (69). Marrow stromal cells, originally thought 

to only contribute to the hematopoietic microenvironment, later came to the center stage with 

the recognition of being the stem/progenitor cells of skeletal tissues (65). Human autologous 

bone marrow associated with macroporous hydroxyapatite scaffolds were implanted in large 

bone segmental defects and shown to promote bone regeneration (70). After a 7 years follow 

up (71), the patients presented a complete healing of the defects. Bone-lining cells are flat 

cells that cover all bone surfaces and are believed to have origin from osteoblasts that 

become inactive (72, 73). These cells form an important cellular barrier that divides the 

canalicular network (where osteocytes are present) from other fluids (63). Osteoblasts are 

cells derived from MSCs that synthesize the osteoid (non-mineralized organic matrix of the 

bone, i.e. type I collagen, osteocalcin, osteopontin, bone sialoproteins and bone 

morphogenetic proteins) (74). Osteoblasts also have an active role in the vascularization 

process by secreting morphogens that activate angiogenesis by signaling endothelial cells 

(75-77). Osteocytes are terminally differentiated osteoblasts entrapped within the bone ECM, 

that are involved in the maintenance of ECM and calcium homeostasis (63). Osteocytes are 

also the cells sensing mechanical stress and communicating signals for bone remodeling 

and tissue maintenance (78). The fifth cell type is the osteoclast, responsible for bone 

resorption that is the first stage of the bone remodeling process, followed by bone 

homeostasis. These cells are large multinucleated cells differentiated from a fraction of 

monocytes found in the peripheral blood (63).  

 As many other connective tissues, one of the main components of bone is its ECM, 

that in this case is mineralized. Bone ECM is composed of 35% of organic matrix and 65% of 

mineral matrix. The most abundant mineral in bone ECM is HA, a calcium phosphate 

crystallized at the surface of collagen fibrils, required to resist to bending and compression 

stresses (61). The organic matrix is mainly proteic composed of type I collagen (90%) and 

the remaining fraction includes up to 200 other non-collagenous proteins, such as 

glycoproteins, proteoglycans, integrin-binding proteins and growth factors (61). 

 Bones are developed by two main processes: intramembranous and endochondral 

ossification (79, 80). Intramembranous ossification is a process that generates flat bones and 

the skull structure. In this pathway, the embryonic mesenchyme condenses and develops in 

primary ossification centers, which will eventually fuse to form a network of anastomosing 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 9 

interconnected trabeculae made of woven bone (79). After that, periosteum is formed at the 

surface of trabeculae, further mineralized and part of the intertrabecular connective tissue is 

transformed in hematopoietic tissue (80). Finally, the woven bone is remodeled into a 

lamellar type of bone (81). Endochondral ossification is an osteogenic process through which 

long bones, vertebrae and pelvis are generated from their precursor cartilaginous tissue. 

(82). This process starts in the fetus stage where MSCs differentiate into chondrocytes, 

converting the condensed mesenchyme into a cartilaginous model of bone that will expand in 

its extremities, while becoming hypertrophic in the center. These hypertrophic chondrocytes 

will promote primary ossification by secreting molecules (such as alkaline phosphatase, type 

X collagen or vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGF) that will induce calcification of 

cartilage. This tissue will be resorbed, becoming a structure onto which progenitor cells 

differentiate into osteoblasts that start to deposit osteoids. After birth, the secondary 

ossification centers are developed at the extremity of long bones allowing the development 

and growth of bone structure (81). 

 

3. BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES 

 Bone has an intrinsic self-ability to regenerate, but over a large defect, inherent 

osseous processes are not able to repair the defect during the patient´s lifetime (83). 

Furthermore, diseased bones do not heal properly, and under certain pathological conditions 

start damaging themselves (83-85). Tissue engineering has emerged as a possible solution 

for these clinical conditions. Several strategies can be employed to develop new bone tissue. 

Those strategies may involve the use of an ECM-like structure (scaffold), cells, and/or growth 

factors. These three basic components need to be well synchronized in order to achieve a 

successful tissue engineering therapy. The strategy used for a specific bone defect must be 

adapted to the clinical state of the patient. There are three main approaches originally 

described for tissue engineering: 1) to use engineered matrices alone, in order to guide 

tissue regeneration; 2) to inject autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic cells alone; 3) to 

develop constructs of cells seeded on those matrices (14). The first method involves 

implanting the scaffold at the site of interest, allowing host cells to migrate from the 

surrounding tissues to colonize the scaffold. The second strategy has the advantage of 

involving minimal surgical invasion and cells can be manipulated by recombinant gene 

technology or clonal expansion prior to injection or infusion. However, this methodology has 

limitations for bone critical size defects, due to the absence of the supporting matrix to keep 

cells at the defect site. In the last approach, cells are seeded onto scaffolds (construct) and 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 10 

later implanted into the bone defect. Usually constructs are produced ex vivo prior to 

transplantation to a bone defect and over time cells will synthesize a new ECM, as the 

scaffold degrades, creating a new functional tissue. This review will focus on the third tissue 

engineering strategy, exploring the potential use of autologous stem cells cultured onto 

biodegradable scaffolds that will act as extracellular matrices, supporting cell growth and 

tissue development.  

 

4. NATURAL BASED POLYMERS FOR SCAFFOLD DESIGN  

 Nature offers a remarkable set of materials with great potential to be used in different 

fields. The study and use of natural materials comes from ancient times, such as cellulose, 

that is used to produce paper or silk to produce clothes. In medicine for example, chitosan is 

used as wound dressing material and collagen as a substitute in reconstructive surgery. 

Today, powerful tools are available and the micro and nanostructures of these materials were 

already clarified. The new level of knowledge brought new opportunities to develop materials 

for other applications, such as scaffolds for tissue engineering. Great efforts have been made 

to recapitulate the key features of bone ECM by developing structures that mimic this 

naturally occurring matrix. ECM plays an important role over cell activities, modulating their 

behavior (86). One difficulty in developing such scaffolds is the complexity to recreate a 

similar microenvironment to the tissue of interest. A simple approach to mimic nature is to 

use naturally occurring materials. Moreover, natural polymers have different functions, such 

as the role of polysaccharides in the cell membranes, intracellular communication and 

storage, or proteins that are structural materials and catalysts (enzymes) (87). Natural 

polymers such as starch (18-20, 22, 88-90) or chitosan (91-94) have been described as 

biocompatible, biodegradable and having tailored degradation rate (88, 92). Some 

drawbacks of these biomaterials are the limited mechanical properties and processability or 

variability between different batches (15). Examples of natural polymers commonly used to 

produce scaffolds are collagen (95-99), hyaluronan (100, 101), alginate (102), silk (50, 103, 

104) and chitosan (23, 37, 41). These polymers can be combined with other synthetic 

materials, to improve their processability and mechanical properties. Combinations with HA 

(105), aliphatic polyesters (25, 27, 106, 107) or composites of different natural polymers (26, 

48) have also been described. Herein a special focus will be given to the natural 

polysaccharide chitosan, the deacetylated product of chitin obtained from the exoskeleton of 

crustaceans. 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 11 

5. CHITOSAN AS A NATURAL ORIGIN BIOPOLYMER 

 The history of chitosan dates back from the 19th century when Rouget discussed its 

deacetylated form (108). Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide, obtained from the deacetylation 

of chitin, the primary structural polymer of the exoskeleton of crustaceans, cuticles of insects 

and cell wall of fungi (109, 110). Chitosan is composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl 

glucosamine with ? (1-4) link (111). Chitosan is the common name for the family of 

deacetylated chitins, with different degrees of deacetylation. By definition, when the number 

of N-acetyl glucosamine units is higher than 50%, the polymer is considered chitin. On the 

other hand, when the number of N-glucosamine units is superior, its name is chitosan (112). 

The molecular weight of chitosan may range from 300 to more than 1,000 kDa, depending on 

its origin and on the preparation method (35). The solubility of chitosan depends on the free 

amino and N-acetyl groups, being soluble in acidic pH (35). The cationic nature of chitosan 

allows electrostatic interactions with anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans. 

Natural polymers are known to influence cell morphology, modulation and differentiation 

(113, 114), as referred previously. This property is of crucial importance in tissue engineering 

field, because GAGs molecules modulate the action of several cytokines and growth factors 

(115).  

 Chitosan presents a wide range of properties that makes it suitable for tissue 

engineering applications, namely its biodegradability (91, 116, 117), biocompatibility (93, 94, 

118-120), antibacterial activity (121-123), wound healing properties (124-130) and easy 

accessibility.  

 Chitosan can be hydrolyzed by chitosanases (131), which are absent in mammals. It 

is well documented that lysozyme is responsible for the biodegradation of chitosan in vitro 

(91, 92, 132, 133). The degradation rate of chitosan is inversely related to the degree of 

deacetylation (132), which represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units to the 

total number of units (131). Lysozyme is ubiquitous in the human body (134). It is found in 

lacrimal gland, middle ear, nose, bronchus, bronchiole, bone marrow and digestive tract 

(135). Lysozyme has an important role in inflammatory response, being secreted by 

macrophages, monocytes, and granulocytes (136, 137). Monocytes and macrophages are 

the main contributors to the presence of lysozyme in human serum in concentrations 

between 7 and 13 mg/L (134).  

 Chitosan has intrinsic anti-microbial properties against several microorganisms, 

namely fungi and bacteria (138). The accurate mechanism is still unknown, although its 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 12 

cationic nature associates with anions in bacteria cell wall, suppressing biosynthesis and 

also disrupting the mass transport across the cell wall, leading to the death of bacteria (138). 

  Chitosan has been described as a potent wound healing accelerator (139), and to 

possess immunological activity, by activating macrophages (140), to produce cytokines (141) 

and to inhibit infection (142).  

 One of the most important characteristics of chitosan, for tissue engineering 

applications, is its ability to be shaped into various structures, such as microspheres (143), 

paste (144), membranes (113), sponges (37, 145-148), fibers (27, 38, 149) and porous 

scaffolds (25, 27, 56, 150, 151). Several processing methodologies have been used to 

produce chitosan porous scaffolds and will be herein further discussed in detail. 

Nevertheless, before describing the scaffolds processing techniques, it is important to 

underline the properties that a scaffold must possess to be successfully applied in bone 

tissue engineering applications. 

 

6. SCAFFOLD REQUIREMENTS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING 

 Bone is a 3D tissue and cells alone do not grow in a 3D manner in vitro. For that 

reason, a tridimensional structure is required to support the formation of new functional bone 

tissue. This structure should provide a suitable environment for cell attachment, proliferation, 

differentiation and ECM deposition. The in vitro cultured constructs, when implanted into the 

defect must be vascularized and osteointegrated into the host bone (152). The 3D structures 

should be biocompatible, i.e., not evoking an immune response when implanted in the host 

tissue. When a scaffold is implanted into the defect to restore bone functionality, it should 

activate the healing mechanisms (inflammatory response). The time course of healing is 

influenced by interactions between blood, scaffold surface and degradation products, which 

are released from the scaffold and therefore, influencing biocompatibility. The ideal scaffold 

should degrade in a rate compatible with the rate of bone growth, physically creating open 

space for the new bone formation, until full regeneration is achieved. The process of polymer 

degradation follows the mechanisms through which polymer chains are cleaved into 

oligomers and finally to monomers, that can be metabolized by natural mechanisms (153). If 

a biological process mediates the degradation process, it is designated by biodegradation 

(153). Several factors influence the kinetics of degradation: type of chemical bonds, pH, 

polymer composition, crystallinity, molecular weight, porosity, water uptake and anatomical 

location of the implant (153). Ideally, natural pathways of the animal body should eliminate

the degradation products. 

 As previously discussed, bone is a highly vascularized tissue, relying on the 

interactions between bone cells and blood vessels. In this way, angiogenesis and 

neovascularization play a crucial role in bone repair, and should be taken into account when 

designing a scaffold. Angiogenesis is mainly characterized by the protrusion and outgrowth 

of capillary buds and sprouts from pre-existing blood vessels, while neovascularization 

comprises the formation of functional microvascular networks with red blood cell perfusion 

(154). Both processes are required to ensure successful engraftment of the construct into the 

surrounding host tissue. A vascular network can be included in a biodegradable and 

biocompatible scaffold by microfabrication techniques (155). The main property of the 

scaffold that is directly related to vascularization is its porosity (156). Scaffolds should have 

highly interconnected porosity to promote cell ingrowth and distribution throughout the matrix, 

as well as facilitating the development of neovascularization. The minimum pore size is 

considered to be approximately 100-150 ?m (157), due to cell size, migration requirements 

and fluid transport. However, due to vascularization requirement, pore sizes were shown to 

affect the course of osteogenesis (156). Large pores rapidly become well-vascularized 

leading to direct osteogenesis (158, 159). In contrast, small pores lead to hypoxic conditions, 

which tend to induce the development of osteochondral process, before osteogenesis 

occurs. The porosity strongly influences scaffold mechanical properties. High porosity and 

pore size facilitates tissue ingrowth, but the consequence is a drastic reduction of mechanical 

properties, compromising the structural integrity of the scaffold (160). The mechanical 

properties of a scaffold should be compatible with those of the native tissue, maintaining its 

structural integrity after implantation (161). In general, the scaffold should be strong enough 

to not only resist to stresses that may cause important dimensional changes, but also to 

overcome the contraction that will exist during the in vivo tissue healing. Scaffold integrity is 

critical, since cells and tissue remodeling are important to achieve stable biomechanical 

environment and vascularization at the host site. The topography and surface chemistry of 

the scaffold play a crucial role in its performance, since those are the first elements that cells 

recognize when in contact with the scaffold surface. The type of proteins that will adsorb to 

the surface of the material, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity will modulate to a great extent the 

protein adsorption, which will influence cell activity upon seeding (162).  

 The methodology used to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering must not 

adversely affect biocompatibility or physical and chemical properties of the biomaterials used. 

Different scaffold batches should exhibit minor variations in their properties, when processed

with similar processing parameters and conditions (163). Different processing methodologies 

for chitosan based scaffolds were already reported in the literature and will be further 

discussed in detail.  

 

7. CHITOSAN SCAFFOLDING METHODOLOGIES 

 The most common processing methodology described for chitosan scaffolds is 

freeze-drying. This process consists in the lyophilization of a frozen chitosan solution, where 

the chitosan acetate salt is induced by the freezing conditions to phase-separate from the ice 

crystal phase. The ice phase is further sublimated, producing a porous structure (24, 35, 37, 

51, 56, 148, 151, 160, 164-175). In most cases, the scaffolds can still have chitosan acetate 

that will cause fast swelling and subsequently dissolution in a neutral aqueous medium. This 

can be overcomed by crosslinking upon immersion in sodium hydroxide (35, 169), sodium 

sulfate (38), tripolyphosphate (37, 148), ethanol series (35), or with a combination of 

crosslinking with rehydration (164). The freeze-drying technique requires a very tight control 

of the temperature. If the temperature is not sufficiently low, the matrix will not become rigid 

enough to support the interfacial tension caused by the evaporation of the solvent without 

collapsing, creating a surface skin. Another limitation of the structures produced by this 

technique is that the size of the pores is not very large. Also the mechanical properties of the 

porous structures are very limited, even after cross-linking. Due to the susceptibility of freeze-

drying methodology, solvent exchange phase separation has been proposed as an 

alternative methodology. This technique is based in the gelation of a solution of chitosan 

using an alkaline solution below its gelation point (26, 36, 53, 176). In freeze-drying process, 

the choice of the solvent is limited, since the solvent vapor pressure at the drying 

temperature (usually low) must be high enough to allow its removal (36). With this alternative 

method, less time consuming and more economic, the choice of the solvent is wider (36).  

 Another processing methodology of chitosan is wet spinning, allowing producing 

fibers. Due to the strong inter-chain forces derived from the hydroxyl and amino groups, 

chitosan tends to degrade at temperatures below its melting temperature, limiting its 

processability by melt or dry spinning methods (38, 41, 149, 177-179). Basically, chitosan is 

dissolved in a solution of diluted acetic acid. This solution is spun through a spinneret into a 

coagulation bath, in this way producing fibers. Chitosan can also be processed by 

electrospinning into a nanofiber mesh scaffold. This method uses an electrical field created 

between a collector and a capillary connected to a reservoir with the polymer solution. The 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 15 

elongation of the drop of solution caused by the electrical field leads to the formation of very 

thin fibers with nanometer scale diameters. Electrospinning of pure chitosan (39, 180-183) is 

considered to be quite difficult, since the resulting chitosan salt is soluble in water. Its stability 

in solution requires neutralization or crosslinking in a post-processing stage that frequently 

has an impact in the morphology of the mesh. Several studies report the blending of chitosan 

with other polymers, being easier to process by electrospinning, namely silk fibroin (184), 

poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (185, 186), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (187), collagen (188) or 

polycaprolactone (189).  

 Less conventional is the particle aggregation method (Figure 1) proposed by 

Malafaya et al. (23). This process relies on the bioadhesive character of chitosan that confers 

a strong bonding between individual particles. The scaffolds produced by this method have 

shown very interesting mechanical properties. In another study, chitosan-poly(lactic-co-

glycolic acid) (PLAGA) microspheres were molded by mixing them with acetic acid solution, 

in a stainless steel mold (190).

obtained by particle aggregation method (A) and interface between particles stained with 

eosin (B).  

 

 Rapid prototyping is a processing route enabling also to develop chitosan porous 

scaffolds. This methodology is based on the production of a 3D physical model from 

computer aided design data (CAD software), which is generated in a layer-by-layer 

deposition process (150, 191). Theoretically, a great variety of morphologies and shapes can 

be created by different variants of these techniques, and the scaffolds will be highly 

reproducible.   

 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 16 

 Our group developed different chitosan based scaffolds by melt based routes (42, 

44). The vast majority of the processing methods used to produce chitosan scaffolds involve 

the use of solvents. Those solvents are frequently harmful for cells, because residual solvent 

may be entrapped in the scaffold and these are toxic for the cells. We developed various 

blends of chitosan with different aliphatic polyesters. Those blends can be processed by 

compression molding followed by salt leaching (42) and by melt spinning and fiber bonding 

(27, 44) into porous scaffolds with different morphologies and mechanical properties (Figure 

2).

leaching (A) and fiber bonding (B) methodologies. 

 

 A systematic list of various porous scaffold compositions using chitosan, the 

processing methods used to obtain the scaffolds and the in vitro evaluation with different cell 

types is provided in Table I. It is clear from the table that the most used processing method to 

obtain chitosan-based porous scaffolds is freeze drying or freeze related processes. The 

main reason is probably the simplicity of the process.

8. IN VITRO CELLULAR APPROACH IN BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING  

 The development of new scaffolds follows a typical evaluation routine. The first step is 

the assessment of the eventual cytotoxicity. This initial screening is based on the use of 

extracted leachables from the scaffold, i.e., substances that leach out of the biomaterials. 

These leachables are added in defined concentrations to standard culture medium and 

placed in contact with a cell line for a determined period of time. After this, cell viability and 

cell morphology are evaluated to determine the eventual toxicity to the cells. The use of cell 

lines is recommended in a first stage, given that these cells are reproducible and can be 

expanded into large numbers. Cell lines, such as mouse fibroblast cells (L929) or human 

osteosarcoma cells (SAOS-2), are frequently used. If the scaffolds show no signs of cell 

cytotoxicity or morphology changes, the next step involves direct contact assays with an 

appropriate cell type to evaluate the cytocompatibility and phenotype functionality. A valid 3D 

construct for bone tissue engineering applications should have a positive outcome from this 

sequence of initial in-vitro tests.  

 

8.1. SELECTION OF CELLS  

 The cell source should be ideally non-immunogenic, easily available, non-

tumorogenic and with defined and adequate characteristics. It should be expandable into 

large numbers and have demonstrated osteogenic potential. Autologous cells, from each 

patient, are the most preferred (198-202). These cells may be isolated from a biopsy of tissue 

(e.g. cartilage, bone, skin) from the patient. The tissue obtained is dissociated and the 

isolated cells are expanded in culture for later implantation into the same patient (29, 70, 

198). The use of autologous cells eliminates the risk of immune rejection, avoiding the need 

of using immunosuppressive drugs. For bone tissue engineering applications, osteoblasts 

are the most obvious selection, since those cells are responsible for the bone formation (74). 

However, these cells have limited availability since the number of cells that are obtained after 

the isolation procedure is low and the expansion rate is slow (203). In the last years, stem 

cells appeared as a valid alternative (203). The term stem cell is used to describe 

undifferentiated cells with ability to self-renew and maintain itself for long periods of time 

keeping its multilineage differentiation capacity (65). Stem cells can be classified as 

embryonic or adult. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells derived from the inner 

cell mass of the blastocyst stage of an embryo (204). These cells possess long-term 

proliferation potential and are able to differentiate into all the types of somatic cells in the 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 19 

organism. Nevertheless, ethical issues regarding its source restrain its use in regenerative 

medicine. Adult stem cells (ASCs) are a valid and alternative option to ESCs. These cells can 

be isolated from different adult tissue sources such as bone marrow (65), peripheral blood 

(205), adipose tissue (206), or fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (207), amniotic fluid (208) 

or placenta (209). ASCs are multipotential cells, capable of differentiating into several cell 

lineages such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes (210). Recent reports sustain the 

plasticity of these cells, i.e. the ability of differentiate into other cell types rather than the ones 

they are committed (211).  

  The process of osteogenic differentiation of stem cells may be achieved by expanding 

the cells in standard culture medium, supplemented with ?-glycerophosphate (212), ascorbic 

acid (213), and dexamethasone (67, 213). These agents activate the osteogenic commitment 

of stem cells. Culture of osteogenic cells depends on the adequate supplementation of their 

growth medium with a source of inorganic phosphate (214), ?-glycerophosphate, a non 

physiological organic substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (215), in order to produce 

mineralized ECM. Ascorbic acid is essential for the survival of human osteoblasts in vitro 

(216). This osteogenic inducing agent is required for collagen synthesis and alkaline 

phosphatase activity (213). Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that increases the expression 

of several genes associated with osteogenic differentiation (217). Moreover, the timing, size 

and number of bone like nodules is affected by the dose of dexamethasone used (218). 

Osteogenic medium can also be supplemented with growth factors, naturally existent in the 

bone structure, such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), 

platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) and insulin 

growth factors (IGFs) (219-226). The process of osteogenic differentiation is coordinated and 

involves three main stages: i) cell proliferation; ii) ECM deposition and maturation; and iii) 

mineralization (227). During cell proliferation, growth genes are expressed (228). 

Immediately following the down-regulation of the proliferation, the expression of ALP 

increases (227). During this period, the ECM undergoes a series of events that renders it 

competent for mineralization (ECM maturation and hydroxyapatite formation) (228). After this 

stage ECM becomes mineralized (227, 228). With the onset of mineralization, the ECM 

protein genes become up-regulated, like osteopontin and osteocalcin that are increasingly 

expressed with the accumulation of mineral (227). ALP activity prior to the onset of the 

mineralization suggests that this enzyme is involved in the preparation of the ECM for 

mineral deposition (227). This enzyme is considered to be an early marker of osteogenic 

differentiation and used to assess in vitro the osteogenic differentiation (20, 229, 230). The 

mineral content of the bone ECM can be qualitatively assessed by alizarin red or von Kossa 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 20 

staining and the calcium content can be quantitatively assessed. This information can be 

complemented by the analysis of the mineral fraction by energy dispersive spectroscopy to 

detect the presence of calcium and phosphorous elements, thin-film X-ray diffraction to 

analyze the crystallinity of the ECM and Fourier-transformed spectroscopy to detect the 

carbonate and phosphate groups (27, 231). 

 

8.2. In vitro studies with chitosan as a biomaterial 

 It is well accepted that the cells strongly interact with their environment, namely with 

neighboring cells, ECM and the surface to which they adhere (232). Chitosan as a 

biomaterial, like previously mentioned, has an analogous structure to the GAGs present in 

the ECM of connective tissues. Several studies describe the positive influence of chitosan 

over cell attachment, proliferation and over the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs (Table I). 

Mouse MSCs in contact with a chitosan suspension were shown to facilitate its osteogenic 

differentiation, when compared to cells seeded onto polystyrene culture wells (233). Lahiji et 

al. reported that chitosan, coated in coverslips, is an appropriate substrate for the growth of 

human osteoblasts and chondrocytes (110). Poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) films modified with 

chitosan solution evidenced improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and biosynthetic activity, 

using human osteoblasts (234). Moreover, neonatal rat calvaria osteoblasts proliferate at 

superior rates on titanium surfaces coated with chitosan compared with titanium alone (235). 

In fact, coating of titanium pins with chitosan, induced minimal inflammatory response and a 

positive healing of a rabbit tibia bone defect (236). MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells 

proliferated and evidenced increased ALP activity, as well as up-regulation of osteogenic 

genes expression in composite chitosan/poly(lactide-co-glicolic acid) (PLAGA) scaffolds as 

compared to PLAGA scaffolds (190). Chitosan–collagen sponges with higher concentration 

of chitosan positively promoted osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs and improved the 

mechanical and physical properties of the matrices (173). Previous studies from our group, 

using flat discs obtained by injection molding composed of chitosan-PBS and PBS blends, 

showed that chitosan had a positive effect on osteoblast like cells (237). Furthermore, in 

literature, PCL nanofibrous scaffolds containing chitosan, revealed that stem cells adhered, 

proliferated and expressed phenotypic markers of osteogenic differentiation in a superior way 

when compared to nanofibrous scaffolds alone (189, 238). The ability of chitosan to support 

cell adhesion and influence osteogenic differentiation of cells can be attributed to its chemical 

properties.  



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 21 

  The in vitro testing systems are inevitably limited in their capacity to recreate the 

complex in vivo environment. Therefore, these tests are unable to predict accurately the in 

vivo performance, particularly in the context of tissue engineering and regeneration of 

functional tissues. Thus, in a later stage of development it is critical to test the developed 

strategies in vivo. 

 

9. IN VIVO ANIMAL MODELS 

 The general trend in bone tissue engineering after successful in vitro testing of the 

constructs is to implant the tissue-engineered construct into a relevant animal model. First, it 

is necessary to obtain a proof of concept of the tissue engineering strategy, in vivo. For this, 

an ectopic model in a small animal (mouse or rat) is commonly used. The constructs are 

implanted into a non-bone related anatomic location of the animal body (90, 239-241). These 

areas can be intraperitoneal, intramuscular, mesenteric or subcutaneous. This model is also 

interesting to determine if a scaffold has adequate properties namely porosity and 

interconnectivity, to allow tissue ingrowth and neovascularization. It is important to conclude 

about the biodegradation of the implanted material, in terms of degradation products and also 

the host immune response. If the aim is to use human cells, nude mouse/rat models are the 

most commonly used, because these animals do not have thymus, being unable to produce 

mature T lymphocytes, compromising the immune system. Therefore, its immune system is 

not able to react against xenogeneic cells (89, 220, 242). The purpose of using such model is 

to conclude about the ability of the tissue-engineered constructs to form ectopic bone and 

also to verify about osteoinductivity, i.e. the ability of the scaffold to induce proliferation of 

undifferentiated stem cells, as well as their differentiation into the osteogenic lineage (243-

245).  

 The in vivo approach should mimic as close as possible the real clinical situation. 

Frequently, it is created an intraosseous wound that will not heal spontaneously during the 

lifetime of the animal (critical size defect) (83). The minimum size considered being a critical 

size defect is not absolute clear. The defect cannot be defined only by size, it is dependent 

on various variables, such as type of specie, anatomic location, among many others (246). 

Guidelines are available for the dimensions of implants based on the size of the animal, type 

of bone chosen and on the implant design to avoid pathological fracture of the test location 

(247). It is important to include controls in the experimental design. These controls should be 

of a material already in clinical use and also a control consisting of an empty defect, to prove 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 22 

that the bone defect is not able to regenerate by itself (247). There are several types of bone 

defects that can be used, such as cranial, segmental, partially cortical and cancellous bone. 

These locations can be subjected to load or non-load bearing (e.g. femur or calvarial, 

respectively). The type of animal can be small (mouse or rat) (90, 104, 226, 248, 249) or 

large (rabbit, sheep, goat, dogs or primates) (146, 198, 250-255). Typically, researchers start 

with a smaller model mainly with less costs involved but also because it is easier to compare 

results between a wealth of experiments reported in the literature. One of the most accepted 

non-loading bearing models is the calvaria bone defect. This bone is a flat bone, allowing the 

creation of a uniform circular defect, and has an adequate size for easy surgical procedure 

and specimen handling. The dura mater and the overlying skin provide fixation of the 

scaffold. The model has been systematically studied and is very well established (83, 84, 

256, 257). This model can be performed in small animals using rat (258, 259) or mouse (226, 

248). It can be also applied to large animals, like rabbit (260-262) or sheep (202).  

 The last stage of preclinical trials of a bone tissue engineering strategy should be 

performed in animals that are believed to be more similar to humans, in terms of metabolism, 

physiology, anatomy, etc. Bones of small animals are more reactive to specific stimuli and 

are not subjected to comparable stresses. For example, a femur defect in rats (263-265) is 

believed to heal faster that in larger animals (256). However, in a study where the authors 

compared the bone ingrowth using the same chamber, in rats and in goats, no significant 

differences were observed between the two animals (266). In vivo experimentation design is 

therefore not an easy task, it is necessary to balance all the variables and decide which 

animal models suits better the specific goals of the experiment. Surgeries involving load-

bearing conditions, involving stabilization with internal or external fixation devices, require the 

presence of experts to perform the surgery. The maintenance of the animals is expensive 

and variations within the same group may be larger as compared to those that are found in 

small laboratory animals. A countless number of variables need to be addressed to assure 

that the chosen model is the most appropriate for testing a specific situation. Consequently, 

variables should be minimized and very well controlled to reduce the random effects and to 

ensure as much as possible statistical significance. It is also very important to moderate the 

number of variables, such as physical condition of the animal (nutritional status, diet, age, 

sex), anesthesics and analgesics, type of bone defect (location, use of fixation) and, finally, 

the methodologies used to assess the sample collection and characterization. Despite the 

issues aforementioned, the final pre-clinical tests should be performed in large animals, 

subjected to load bearing comparable to the human case. For this proposes, the sheep or 

goat may be a good option. Both have a similar metabolism and bone remodeling rate to 



 CHAPTER I. Introduction 

 23 

humans, as well as a comparable weight (12, 18, 199, 202, 252). 

 

9.1. In vivo bone regeneration studies with chitosan material 

  As described before, chitosan is already used in medicine, as a biomaterial for 

wound dressings. However, there are several reports in the literature showing the ability of 

chitosan to be used as material to regenerate bone (Table II). The first report describing the 

attempt to in vivo regenerate bone using chitosan structures dates back from 1988 (113), 

when Muzzarelli and colleagues implanted chitosan membranes and chitosan ascorbate gel 

into cranial defects in cats. Their findings suggested that chitosan seems to induce some 

type of stimulatory and/or attractive effect over the stromal cells of the surrounding tissues.

chitosan in defects created in the tibia of rabbits (146) and in the femoral head of sheep 

(147). These studies confirmed the previous results (113) about the possible stimulatory 

and/or attractive effect of chitosan over cells. Chitosan has been also used as carrier for 

growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to promote bone 

formation in a calvaria critical sized defect in rats (221, 268). Osteoconductive 

chitosan/tricalcium phosphate (TCP) sponges promoted osseous healing of the rat calvarial 

defects as compared to controls (without scaffolds) and the addition of PDGF-BB to the 

carrier further enhanced bone regeneration, favoring its osteoinductivity (268). These authors 

observed that chitosan/TCP sponge with PDGF-BB promoted more bone formation of the 

defects as compared to chitosan-TCP without the bioactive agents (221). PDGF growth 

factor is produced by platelets, osteoblasts and monocytes/macrophages and it is believed to 

have a role in the migration of MSCs to the wounding sites (272). Electrospun chitosan 

nanofiber membranes evidenced new bone formation at four weeks in calvaria defects of 

rabbits when compared to the controls (empty bone defects), where only soft tissue formation 

was observed (182). Chitosan combined with nano-hydroxyapatite in the form of 

microspheres were implanted in rat calvaria defects for twelve weeks, being able to promote 

bone regeneration (54). Moreover, chitosan-PLAGA microspheres conjugated in a scaffold 

by particle aggregation, with or without heparin and recombinant human bone morphogenetic 

protein 2 (rhBMP-2) showed to promote bone regeneration in vivo (271). More pronounced 

results were obtained for the scaffolds with the incorporated growth factor (271). A study by 

Ríos and co-workers (50) used a model mimicking the clinical bone free flaps, by flap 

prefabrication technique, which involves the design of the desired tissue at an ectopic site in 

the patient own body. This study used chambers containing silk fibroin-chitosan scaffolds 

implanted on top of the grafted periosteum over the latissimus dorsi muscle of sheeps (50). 

Bone grafts were used as positive controls and empty defects as negative controls. The 

authors found that the same amount of bone was regenerated in the defects with the tested 

scaffolds, as for the defects with the bone grafts (50). 

 

10. CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS 

 The developments in bone tissue engineering were considerable but there is not yet a 

tissue-engineered product that has reached clinical application. Both cells and biomaterial 

components need to be optimized to produce a functional bone tissue engineered therapy. 

 New stem cell sources are being explored, such as the extra-embryonic tissues,

placenta, amniotic fluid or umbilical cord. These stem cells have been shown to express 

pluripotent markers and low immunogenicity, evidencing a more primitive state. These cells 

are usually discarded, which make these sources attractive candidates for tissue engineering 

applications. Moreover, the low immunogenic potential could enable the use of these cells as 

an allogenic cell source for successful bone repair. 

 A new generation of biodegradable natural biomaterials is emerging, being chitosan 

one of the most interesting. Chitosan has been extensively studied as a biomaterial for bone 

tissue engineering scaffolding, but in practice it is still and only used as a wound dressing 

and hemostatic agent in medicine. Several morphologies can be successfully obtained by 

different processing techniques, which turn this material attractive for this end. Although 

several studies reporting the biological enhancement by chitosan and its influence over 

osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration, still remains unclear the mechanism of 

action. It is worthwhile to continue to pursuit research over this interesting natural polymer in 

order to clarify its function over cell performance, as well as, to improve the scaffold 

processing methodologies, that will lead to the clinical use in the bone regeneration field.

Chapter II 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 The main aim of this chapter is to describe in more detail the experimental work and 

protocols related to the experiments performed and the obtained results. Together with 

chapter I, it will establish the rationale of the research reported in this thesis, which was the 

biological evaluation of chitosan based scaffolds, in vitro and in vivo, envisioning bone tissue 

engineering applications. For that, it will be briefly described the materials used and the 

scaffolds processing methodologies. It will be explained in more detail the in vitro biological 

characterization techniques and the in vivo animal models used and respective 

characterization methodologies. 

 

1. Materials 

1.1. Chitosan 

 Chitosan (Ch) is a linear polysaccharide, obtained from the alkaline deacetylation of 

chitin, composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine linked in a ? (1-4) link (1). 

Important parameters affecting the characteristics of chitosan are its molecular weight (Mw) 

and its degree of deacetylation (DD) (2). The degree of deacetylation of chitosan refers to the 

ratio between the deacetylated and acetylated units. The solubility of chitosan depends on 

the free amino and N-acetyl groups being soluble in acidic pH (3). Chitosan is a semi-

crystalline polymer and the degree of crystallinity depends on the degree of deacetylation. 

Chitosan is a biodegradable polymer being degraded by lysozyme (4). The degradation rate 

of chitosan is inversely related to the degree of deacetylation (5). 

 Chitosan presents a wide range of biological properties, which makes it one of the 

most promising materials for tissue engineering applications. Important characteristics to be 

highlighted are its biodegradability, biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, wound healing 

properties and easy accessibility (low cost). Moreover, the chemical structure of chitosan 

(Figure 1) resembles the structure of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and these molecules play 

an important role in the modulation of various cell functions, morphology and differentiation 

(6).

Figure 1. Chemical structure of chitosan 
 

The chitosan herein used was purchased from France Chitine (Orange, France). 

Firstly, chitin was isolated from shrimp shells and squid bones by deproteinization and/or 

demineralization, respectively. The chitosan was further obtained by the removal of enough 

acetyl groups (CH3-CO) from the chitin molecule (deacetylation process), releasing the amine 

groups (NH) and giving to chitosan a cationic characteristic. 

 

1.2. Aliphatic polyesters 
 Synthetic polymers have been extensively studied in tissue engineering field, such as 

poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) and their copolymers. These 

polymers are biodegradable, because the ester bonds present in its structure are hydrolyzed 

into non-toxic natural metabolites and are eliminated from the body via respiration. In the 

present thesis the synthetic materials used were PCL, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and 

poly(butylene terephthalate adipate) (PBTA). More detail and special emphasis will be given 

to PBS, since it was the material used in the majority of the studies due to its biological 

performance. 

 

1.2.1. Poly(butylene succinate) 

Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is an aliphatic polyester (Figure 2), commercially 

available under the trademark Bionolle®. It was obtained from Showa Highpolymer Co. Ltd. 

(Tokyo, Japan), with the reference 1050, a polybutylene succinate copolymer. Bionolle® has 

been shown to be biodegradable in a variety of natural environments, decomposing into 

water and carbon dioxide. It has been processed into films, sheets, filaments, nonwoven 

fabrics, laminates, molded foams and injection-molded products for diverse applications, 

namely in agriculture, fishery, forestry, civil engineering and for common household goods.

Pure PBS presents a hydrophobic behavior with low water uptake (~ 1.5%) and after 

60 days of immersion in the isotonic saline solution it displays a decrease in the mechanical 

properties without any appreciable weight loss (~ 0.5%). This polymer presents a melting 

temperature (Tm) of 104.3ºC.  

 

2. Processing methods 

 The materials used in this thesis were, always composed by chitosan and a synthetic 

polymer. The compositions were prepared by extrusion prior to be processed into a three 

dimensional (3D) structure. For the scaffolds production two different methodologies were 

used: compression molding followed by salt leaching and fiber bonding. Chitosan and 

polyester blends used for the production of the scaffolds are described in chapters III, IV, V, 

VI and VII. Those materials were compounded in a twin-screw extruder. Blends of chitosan 

with poly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) were mixed at two different ratios - 25/75 wt% and 

50/50wt%, blends of chitosan with poly(caprolactone) (Ch-PCL) and poly(butylene 

terephthalate adipate) (Ch-PBTA) were mixed at 50/50 wt%. In chapter IV, it was used 

poly(butylene succinate) to produce scaffolds to be used as controls in an experiment 

designed to test the relevance of chitosan in biological terms. 

 

2.1. Compression molding/particulate leaching  

 The scaffolds described in chapters III, IV and VII were prepared after grinding the 

compounded blends by solid mixing with NaCl particles, loaded into a mold that was further 

heated, and molded into large discs by compression. The salt content was 60% by weight 

and the size range of NaCl particles was 250–500 µm for all the blends. These compression-

molded discs were further sliced to obtain different types of geometrical structures used in 

different chapters, because of the size required to in vivo models employed. In chapter III, 

cubes of 5 mm3 were used, in chapter IV were used discs of 8 mm of diameter and 1 mm 

thick and in chapter VII were used small discs with 5 mm of diameter and 1mm thick were 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 48 

used (Figure 3). These structures were then immersed in distilled water to leach out the 

porogen particles. The cubes were dried to constant weight and used for further tests. 

 

 

Figure 3. Scheme of the scaffolds produced by compression molding followed by salt 
leaching used in different chapters. 

 

2.2. Fiber Bonding 

 The chitosan/polyester blends used to process the scaffolds presented in chapters V 

and VI were compounded as previously described. The mixture of chitosan with 

poly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) (50-50% wt) was extruded into fibers, by using a single 

screw micro-extruder. The obtained fibers were cut into 1 cm long and loaded into a Teflon 

mold. This mold was heated at 150ºC during a previously optimized time period. After that, 

pressure was applied to allow fibers to weld at the junctions, forming a stable fiber mesh 

structure. The porous mesh was further cut into discs with diameter of 6.5 mm and 1.5 mm 

thick. 

 

3. Scaffolds Characterization 

 When new polymeric scaffolds are developed, it is imperative to characterize these 

novel structures. Physical and chemical characterization is performed to determine the 

surface topography, morphological properties, 3D architecture, porosity and pore size, 

interconnectivity and mechanical properties. The following techniques were used to 

characterize the developed scaffolds used in this work. 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 49 

3.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy 

All the developed chitosan based scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM). This methodology is extremely important to study the morphology of 

polymeric materials and structures. This technique allows to analyze the morphology of the 

specimen, at large magnifications and also the details of the structure up to the sub-micron 

level. Polymeric structures are non-conductive, being generally coated with conductive 

materials, such as gold or carbon. This fact is due to the fact that the intensity of the electron 

beam can damage the thin polymeric samples, which can lead to the deformation and even 

melting of the polymer. Furthermore, the accumulation of electrons at the surface of the 

specimen causes the loss of image formed at the detector. 

The developed scaffolds were sputter-coated with gold (Fisons Instruments, model SC502; 

England) for 2 minutes at 15 mA. The samples were further analyzed by scanning electron 

microscopy (Leica Cambridge, model S360; England). Micrographs were recorded at 15 kV 

with magnifications ranging from 100 to 5000 times. 

 

3.2. Micro computed tomography 

 Micro computed tomography (µCT) technique was used to recreate 3D images of the 

scaffolds. This methodology is based on the use of a X-ray source to create shadow 

images/projections of a 3D object that later can be used with an appropriate software to 

recreate a virtual model. It is named micro because pixel sizes of the cross-sections are in 

the micrometer range. The X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan, 

while the sample rotates, to allow obtaining the slices of the object morphology.  

 The scaffolds used in chapter III, V and VI were evaluated by µ-CT, carried out by 

scanning in high-resolution mode of 8.7 µm x/y/z and an exposure time of 1792 ms. The 

energy parameters defined in the scanner were 63 keV with a current of 157 µA. Data were 

obtained by the system and reconstructed in 2D images. These slice images were further 

compiled and analyzed to render 3D images and obtain quantitative architecture parameters. 

A ?CT analyzer and a ?CT Volume Realistic 3D Visualization, both from SkyScan, were used 

as image processing tools for both ?CT reconstruction and to create/visualize the 3D 

representation. Regions of interest (square of 4.5x4.5 mm2) were selected in each slice 

image and thresholded to eliminate background noise. This threshold (to distinguish polymer 

material from pore voids) was selected and maintained constant for all the scanned 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 50 

specimens and samples. The threshold was also inverted to obtain pore volume and to 

analyze both the pore morphology and its interconnectivity. 

 Chitosan-based fiber mesh scaffolds, exploited in chapter IV and VII, were scanned in 

high resolution mode using a pixel size of 8.24 ?m and integration time of 2.0 ms. The X-ray 

source was set at 80 keV of energy and 124 ?A of current. For all the scanned specimens 

representative data sets of 150 slices were transformed into binary using a dynamic 

threshold of 60-255 (grey values) to distinguish polymer material from pore voids. This data 

was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyzer v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). 3D virtual models of 

representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were also created, visualized and 

registered using both image processing softwares (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan). Five 

scaffolds were examined for each type of scaffolds. 

 

3.3. Mechanical properties 

 The mechanical testing of the scaffolds was performed under compression loading 

using a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min and the results presented are the average of at least 

five specimens. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before 

testing. The values reported are the average of at least five specimens per condition. The 

compressive modulus was determined in the most linear region of the stress–strain graph 

using the secant method. In the cases that the yield stress was not clearly defined, it was 

calculated as the stress at the intersection of a line drawn parallel to the linear region and 

intercepting the x-axis at 1% strain. 

 

3.4. In vitro degradation studies 

 The biomaterials used in this PhD thesis were biodegradable polymers. These 

materials degrade over time in a way that the neo-tissue can develop, without long-term 

presence of foreign components and finally cleared from the organism. Biodegradation of 

polymeric biomaterials requires cleavage of hydrolytically or enzymatically sensitive bonds in 

the polymer, leading to polymer erosion (7). Degradation products should be non-toxic and 

non-immunogenic, therefore not inducing strong inflammatory reaction. These products 

should be small enough to dissolve in the body fluids and, after transportation via lymphatic 

system into kidneys, these should be able to excrete them from the body (8). Polymers that 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 51 

are known to degrade in the body, either by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation can be 

modeled in vitro, in order to predict their behavior when implanted in vivo. 

 The degradation studies described in chapter VII were performed by incubating the 

scaffolds in phosphate buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) (control), with lipase from Aspergillus 

oryzal (Fluka) and/or lysozyme from chicken egg white (Sigma, St. Louis), at concentrations 

similar to the ones found in human blood serum (110 U/L for lipase and 13 mg/L for 

lysozyme), at 37ºC in dynamic conditions (60 rpm) for 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. In one 

experiment the solutions were changed every 7 days, while in the other the solutions were 

not changed throughout the experiment. At the end of each degradation period, the samples 

were removed, gently blotted to eliminate the water excess and immediately weighed for 

determination of water uptake and dried for later calculation of weight loss.  

 

3.4.1. Water uptake and weight loss measurements 

At the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately 

weighed for determination of water uptake (Equation 1) (Chapter V), washed thoroughly with 

distilled water and dried for later calculation of weight loss (Equation 2) (Chapters III, V, VI, 

and VII): 

 

Water uptake (%) = [(ww – wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) 

 

Weight loss (%) = [wi – wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) 

 

where wi is the initial weight, ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. 

 

4. In vitro biological characterization  

 All the scaffolds used in the next sections of this thesis were sterilized by ethylene 

oxide. The routine followed in biological assessment of the developed scaffolds included 

cytotoxicity evaluation, direct contact tests with cell lines and in a later stage with human 

primary cells. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 52 

4.1. Cytotoxicity assessment 

 After the development of the scaffolds, the next step is the assessment of the 

eventual cytotoxicity. This initial screening is based on the use of the scaffold leachables, i.e., 

substances that leach out of the biomaterials. These leachables are placed in contact with a 

cell line, for a determined period of time. After that time, cell viability and morphology are 

evaluated, to determine the eventual toxicity to the cells. In this first stage it is recommended 

the use of cell lines, because these cells are reproducible, well characterized in the literature 

and large amounts of cells can be obtained with cell expansion. 

 In the work developed in this thesis it was used a rat lung fibroblast cell line -L929, 

acquired from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, to perform the initial cytotoxicity 

evaluation of the developed scaffolds. Cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco?s 

modified eagle?s medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine 

serum (FBS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 1% of antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (10,000 

U/mL penicillin G sodium; 10,000 U/mL streptomycin sulphate; 25 µg/mL amphotericin B) 

(Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). Trypsin/EDTA (0.25% w/v trypsin/0.02% EDTA, Sigma) was used 

to detach the cells from the culture flasks before the experiments were conducted. 

 Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (n=6) at a density of 1.8 x 104 cells/well and 

incubated for 24 h at 37ºC, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The ratio of material 

weight to extract fluid was constant and equal to 0.25 g/mL. Latex rubber was used as a 

positive control of cell death, because it has a strong cytotoxic effect leading to extensive cell 

death. The ratio of latex material outer surface to extraction fluid was 2.5 cm2/mL. Culture 

medium was used as negative control of cytotoxicity, considered to be the ideal condition for 

cell growth. Test scaffolds (n=6) and positive control were extracted for 24 h at 37ºC, using 

complete culture medium as the extraction fluid. Before the tests, culture medium was 

removed from wells with cells adhered, and an identical volume (200 µL) of extraction fluid 

was added. The cells were left to proliferate in the extract fluid for 72 h. After this period, the 

extraction fluid was removed, and the metabolic activity and, consequently, cell viability was 

determined by a colorimetric assay named CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell 

Proliferation Assay (Promega, USA). Briefly, this assay is based on the bioreduction of a 

tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-

sulfofenyl)-2H tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS)) into a brown formazan product that is soluble in 

culture medium. This conversion is accomplished by the production of nicotinamide adenine 

dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by the 

dehydrogenase enzymes existing in the metabolically active cells. The quantity of formazan 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 53 

product bioreduced is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture, as 

measured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, model 

Synergie HT, USA), after 3 h of incubation at 37ºC. Triplicates were made for each sample 

and per culture time. 

 

4.2. Direct cell contact tests 

4.2.1. Mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell line - BMC9 

 If the scaffolds show no signs of cell cytotoxicity or morphological changes, the next 

step will be to proceed for direct contact assays with an appropriate cell source to develop a 

valid 3D construct for bone tissue engineering applications. 

 The developed scaffolds were composed of several aliphatic polyesters and chitosan. 

First all of these scaffolds were evaluated in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation and 

osteogenic potential. For this initial screening, described in chapter III, it was used a mouse 

mesenchymal stem cell line – BMC9. These cells were previously shown to be able to 

differentiate into several phenotypes, including the osteogenic lineage (9).  

 Cells were grown in DMEM, supplemented with 10% of FBS and 1% of antibiotic–

antimycotic mixture. When the adequate number of cells was obtained, they were detached 

with trypsin, and seeded at a density of 5x105 cells per scaffold. The seeding methodology 

consisted in dropping an aliquot of 10 µL on top of the scaffolds. After 2 h, 1 mL of 

osteogenic inducing culture medium was added to each well. The cell-seeded scaffolds were 

maintained at 37ºC, and 5% CO2. The osteogenic medium consisted in the same medium 

described before, but supplemented with osteogenic agents, dexamethasone 10-8 M, 

ascorbic acid 50 µg/mL and ?-glycerophosphate 10 mM. These supplements are required for 

a successful osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that 

increases the expression of several different genes associated with osteogenic differentiation 

(10). Ascorbic acid is essential for collagen synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity (11). 

Culture of osteogenic cells depends on supplementation of their growth medium with a 

source of inorganic phosphate (12) - ?-glycerophosphate, a non-physiological organic 

substrate of alkaline phosphatase, allowing to produce mineralized ECM. To simplify the 

nomenclature of the cell seeded and cultured scaffolds in vitro, these will be identified as 

“constructs” in the next chapters.

4.2.2. Primary cultures of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 

 The subsequent work developed after the screening of the best scaffold formulation 

for bone tissue engineering, was performed with primary cultures of human bone marrow 

mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). These cells were isolated from human bone marrow 

aspirates obtained during routine surgical procedures involving knee arthroplasties. The 

collection of samples was approved by the ethical committee of the São Marcos hospital in 

Braga, under the cooperation agreement established between the 3B´s research group-UM 

and that hospital. A detailed informed consent was signed by each donor. The isolation 

procedure relies on the principle that from the several cell populations existent in bone 

marrow, only the adherent fraction will be isolated, being considered marrow stromal cells 

(13). Briefly, the bone marrow aspirate was centrifuged and all the fat tissue fraction, as well 

as cartilage and bone remnants were discarded. The cell suspension was incubated with 

eritrocytes lysis buffer to lyse these cells. The resultant cell suspension was plated and 

cultured. The cell population characterized by flow cytometry for stemness markers (clusters 

of differentiation-CD) CD29, 44, 73, 90, 105 and 106 and as well for the hematopoietic 

exclusion markers CD34 and 45. These adherent cells showed spindle-shape morphology 

and colony-forming unit (CFU) capacity. The isolated cells were also characterized for its 

multipotential ability, being differentiated for osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic 

lineages. 

 

4.3. hBMSCs culture, seeding into the scaffolds and differentiation into the osteogenic 

lineage 

 High numbers of hBMSCs are required to perform cell seeding into the developed 

scaffolds, for all quantitative and qualitative analysis. The isolated cells were expanded in 

basal medium consisting of alfa Eagle?s medium (?-MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) 

supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 % antibiotic/antimyotic solution. Cells were cultured at 

37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 

 When cells reached confluency, at passages 4-5 they were harvested for static 

seeding onto the scaffolds, at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold. The constructs were 

cultured under static conditions, in standard osteogenic differentiation medium, described in 

subsection 4.2.1. The constructs were collected at different culture times: 7, 14 and 21 days, 

because it is expected that by the end of the experiment, the cells already show a definied 

osteogenic phenotype (14).  



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 55 

4.3.1. Evaluation of cell morphology and distribution 

 SEM was used to analyze the level of cell attachment and its morphology, as well as 

distribution on the surface of the scaffolds. To achieve those goals it is required the use of 

methods of fixation or stabilization of the cells on the scaffolds to obtain biological samples in 

their natural state. Coating of the mples with gold was performed as described in subsection 

3.1. Additionally, due to the non-electric conductivity of those samples it is also needed to 

coat the samples with a conductive material such as gold or carbon. The constructs were 

fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, USA) 

solution, during 15 min at RT. Then, they were dehydrated through graded series of ethanol 

and let to dry overnight. Finally, they were gold or carbon sputter coated (Fisons Instruments, 

model SC502; England) during 2 min at 15 mA, and analyzed by SEM (Leica Cambridge, 

model S360; England) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS; link-eXL-II). 

 The constructs were also analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy 

(FluoView1000, Olympus, Germany) in chapters III and IV. Cells were stained with calcein 

AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). This molecule is hydrolyzed by endogenous 

esterases into the highly negatively charged calcein, which is retained inside the cells. In this 

way, it is possible to observe the distribution of viable cells throughout the scaffold structure. 

 Histological analysis of the scaffolds was reported in chapter III. Hematoxylin-Eosin 

(H&amp;amp;E) staining was performed to observe the cell morphology and its distribution into the 

developed scaffolds. Basically, constructs were stained with Harris hematoxylin (Merck, 

Germany) during 1 to 3 minutes, until reaching the desired staining intensity. They were 

further washed in running tap water and afterwards a blue stain enhancement was performed 

by an immersion in 0.5% ammonia (Aldrich, Germany) for 5–10 seconds. The constructs 

were washed again in running tap water, followed by an immersion in alcohol 96 %, and 

stained in Shandon Eosin-Y (Thermo Scientific, UK) for 30 seconds. The samples were again 

washed in alcohol 96% and dehydrated through two immersions in alcohol 100 %. Before 

permanent mounting in Histomount™ (National Diagnostics, UK), the stained constructs were 

immersed in xylene for 1-2 min. Stained sections were observed under an optical microscope 

(BX61, Olympus Corporation, Germany) and images captured with a digital camera (DP70, 

Olympus Corporation, Germany). 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

4.3.2. Cell viability assay 

 Cell viability was assessed by indirect measurements based on its metabolic activity, 

at each time period by CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay 

(Promega; USA), as described in subsection 4.1. 

 

4.3.3. Cell proliferation assay – DNA quantification 

 Measurements of DNA synthesis are frequently taken to be representative of the 

amount of cell proliferation (15). Cell proliferation rate determination is often used to 

determine the response of cells to a particular stimulus, i.e., physical (e.g. topography of a 

substrate) or chemical (toxin or growth/differentiation factor).  

 In the present work, cell proliferation was quantified by the total amount of double-

stranded DNA (dsDNA) using an ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain. Quant-iT™ 

PicoGreen® dsDNA reagent was selected since it enables to quantify as little as 25 pg/mL of 

dsDNA (50 pg dsDNA in a 2 mL assay volume) with a standard spectrofluorometer and 

specific fluorescein excitation and emission wavelengths. Additionally, dsDNA can be 

quantified in the presence of equimolar concentrations of ssDNA and RNA with minimal 

effect on the quantitative results obtained. The Quant-iT™ PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit 

(Invitrogen™, Molecular Probes™; Oregon, USA) was used according to the manufacturer?s 

instructions. Briefly, cells in the construct were lysed by osmotic and thermal shock and the 

supernatant used for the DNA quantification assay. A fluorescent dye, PicoGreen, was used 

because of its high sensitivity and specificity to double-stranded DNA. The fluorescence of 

the dye was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485/20 nm and at an emission 

wavelength of 528/20 nm, in a microplate reader (Synergie HT, Bio-Tek, USA). The DNA 

concentration for each sample was calculated using a standard curve (DNA concentration 

ranging from 0.0 to 1.5 ?g/ml) relating quantity of DNA and fluorescence intensity. Triplicates 

were made for each sample and per culturing time 

 

4.3.4. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) quantification 

 A detailed analysis of the mineralization and of the progression of differentiation can 

be obtained by biochemical assays. Routine assessments involve the quantification of total 

calcium content and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a cell surface protein bound 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 57 

to the plasma membrane though phosphatidylinositol phospholipid complexes (16). High ALP 

activity is associated with the active formation of mineralized matrix and highest levels are 

found in the mineralization front of the bone healing process. 

 The concentration of ALP was determined for all time culture periods, using the same 

samples used for DNA quantification. Briefly, the activity of ALP was assessed using the p-

nitrophenol assay. Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (pnPP; Fluka BioChemika, Austria) is 

colourless, is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase, produced by cells, at pH 10.5 and 

temperature of 37ºC, to form free p-nitrophenol, which is yellow. The reaction was stopped by 

the addition of 2 M NaOH (Panreac Quimica, Spain) and the absorbance read at 405 nm in a 

microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Synergie HT; USA). Standards were prepared with 10 ?mol/ml p-

nytrophenol (pNP; Sigma, USA) solution, to obtain a standard curve ranging from 0 to 0.25 

?mol/ml). Triplicates of each sample and standard were made, and the ALP concentrations 

read off directly from the standard curve. 

 

4.3.5. Extracellular matrix mineralization content by energy dispersive spectroscopy 

(EDS) 

 Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) methodology was used to detect the presence 

of calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) elements by analyzing the surface of the constructs. 

These two chemical elements are constituents of the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite) of bone 

ECM. Their presence positively indicates the formation of mineralized ECM at the surface of 

the constructs. As controls, it was analyzed the surface of unseeded scaffolds immersed in 

osteogenic medium for the same time periods, showing that the presence of P and Ca were 

the result of cellular activity. 

 The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM in subsection 3.1. 

The samples were sputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100) with the purpose of 

analyzing the presence of Ca and P elements at the surface by EDS with a Leica Cambridge 

S360 scanning electron microscope. Sputter coating with carbon avoids overlapping of 

signals of the coating with the elements being analyzed. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

4.3.6. Extracellular matrix mineralization crystallinity by fourier transform infra-red 

spectroscopy (FTIR) 

 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method is used to study the chemical 

structure of a polymer, but it can also be used to analyze the chemical composition of the 

surface of a scaffold. In the present thesis it was used to confirm the results obtained from 

EDS analyses, indicating the presence of phosphate and carbonate groups, which are typical 

for carbonated apatite (17). Briefly, constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline and 

fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The samples were pressed into pellets with potassium bromide 

(KBr; Riedel-de Haen, Germany) and further analysed by FTIR. The infrared spectrum was 

measured using a FTIR Spectrometer (model IRPrestige-21, Shimadzu; Germany) in the 

wavelength range of 4000–400 cm?1. The same controls (acellular scaffolds) used for the 

EDS analysis were used in tests. 

 

4.3.7. Gene expression analysis of specific osteogenic genes 

 The constructs cultured in vitro in osteogenic inducing medium were evaluated by 

analyzing the expression of genes encoding specific proteins during osteogenic 

differentiation of hBMSCs. This process is characterized by three sequential periods: 

proliferation, ECM maturation and mineralization (18). The osteogenic phenotype is 

recognized by cell maturation coordinated with the secretion of specific proteins, in a process 

that is asynchronously acquired as the progenitor cells successfully differentiate and the 

matrix matures and mineralizes (19). To evaluate the transient state of the stem cells during 

the differentiation process polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, by amplifying 

specific sequences of a target osteogenic specific gene. 

 

 4.3.7.1. RNA isolation  

  Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the constructs was extracted using the Trizol® 

(Invitrogen, Life Technologies Inc., UK) method according to the manufacturer?s protocol. At 

each time point, the constructs were washed with phospate buffered saline, immersed in 

Trizol and stored at -80ºC until further use. Proteins were removed with chloroform extraction 

and the RNA pellets were washed once with isopropyl alcohol and once with 70 % ethanol. 

The total RNA pellets were reconstituted in RNAase free water (Gibco, Invitrogen, UK). 

Determination of the RNA concentration for each scaffold replica (triplicates of each scaffold 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 59 

per time point) was performed by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000, USA). The 

integrity of the RNA samples was checked using agarose 1.2% gel electrophoresis.  

 

4.3.7.2. Reverse-transcriptase and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 

 In chapter V, it was used non-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 

reaction (PCR). Briefly, aliquots of the total RNA (100 ng/?l) were used to synthesize 

complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) and amplified by PCR, in one step RT-PCR 

beads (Amersham Biosciences, USA). The cDNA synthesis was executed by incubating the 

reaction mixture 5 min at 25ºC, followed by 30 min at 42ºC and terminated by an incubation 

at 85ºC for 5 min, using a termocycler (MyCycler™, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). 

Specific osteogenic gene sequences (primers) were used in PCR reaction. Human 

specific primers used were: for runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin, type I 

collagen, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-

phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Each cDNA sample was run in triplicate for every PCR. 

Amplification was performed using a termocycler (MyCycler™, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). The 

first reverse transcription step at 42ºC for 30 min was followed by a step of denaturation at 

95ºC during 5 min. After this, 35 cycles of PCR were performed, each consisting of a 

denaturation stage at 95ºC for 1 min, annealing at a given temperature accordingly with the 

specific primer used and then an extension stage at 72ºC for 2 min. In all cases, a final 

extension at 72ºC for 5 min was performed before storing the samples at 4ºC.  

 PCR products were separated by 1% agarose (Biorad, USA) at least twice. The 

separated DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (Sigma, St Louis, 

MO) and observed with Eagleye software (Alpha Innotech, USA) using excitation at 514 nm 

and emission at 610 nm.  

In chapter IV, it was used quantitative real-time PCR. This technology presents 

several advantages over traditional PCR (reverse-transcriptase PCR). The measurement of 

the amount of amplified product is carried out with a quantitative laser-based method, and 

data collection is performed in the early exponential phase of the reaction, when none of the 

reagents is rate-limiting. The genes analyzed were Runx2, osterix (OSX), osteocalcin, type I 

collagen, BSP, osteopontin (OPN) and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-

phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Real time PCR was performed accordingly to the 

protocol from iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Succinctly, a 

reaction mixture consisting of 1X iScript Reaction Mix, 1 µl iScript Reverse Transcriptase, 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 60 

RNA template (1 µg total RNA) and nuclease-free water was prepared, in 40 µl of total 

volume. The single-strand cDNA synthesis occurred as described for conventional PCR.  

Amplification of the target cDNA for real-time PCR quantification was performed 

according to manufacturer protocol, using 2 µl RT cDNA products, 1 ?M each primer, 1X iQ 

SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and nuclease-free water, in a final 

volume of 25 ?L. Forty-four cycles of denaturation (95ºC, 10 s), annealing (temperature 

dependent on the gene, 30 s) and extension (72ºC, 30 s) were carried out in the gradient 

thermocycler MiniOpticon real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 

all genes. The transcripts expression data were normalized to the housekeeping gene 

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehygrogenase (GAPDH) for each time point and relative 

quantification calculated by the ?CT method. 

 

5. In vivo studies 

 In vitro experimentation is limited in recreating the complex in vivo environment, being 

most of the times incapable of predicting in vivo performance in many settings, particularly in 

tissue engineering and regeneration of functional tissues.  

 All procedures were conducted in accordance with European regulations for animal 

testing (European Union Directive 86/609/EEC).  

 

5.1. In vivo tissue response in different locations 

 This work was developed in chapter IV. Twelve Wistar rats were used. This study was 

conducted after receiving approval from the Animal Ethical Committee of the K?r?kkale 

University, Ankara, Turkey. The scaffolds (8 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick) were sterilized 

by ethylene oxide. Animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a mixture 

of ketamine HCl (Parke Davis, 50 mg/ml, Taiwan) and Rompun (2%, Bayer, Germany). The 

scaffolds were implanted in 3 different regions per animal:  

 (i) single critical size defect with 8 mm diameter in crania;  

 (ii) pocket incision between perichondrium and ear cartilage, the scaffold being 
placed on the 1/3 proximal cartilage of the pocket;  

 (iii) incision of 10 mm close to iliac bone, the scaffolds being placed between 

periosteum and iliac bone (onlay model) (21).  



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 61 

 A total of 3 scaffolds per animal were implanted (one in each location).  In all cases, 

the incisions were closed using 5.0 silk sutures. After one month of implantation, the animals 

were sacrificed and implants were collected with the surrounding tissue and processed for 

histological processing. 

 

5.2. In vivo degradation studies and evaluation of the host response 

 In vivo implantation of developed scaffolds was performed in parallel with in vitro 

degradation studies. Biocompatibility is directly related with degradation process of the 

scaffolds. This is due to the fact that degradation of a biomaterial implanted in a host is 

influenced by the presence and recruitment of inflammatory cells and consequently by the 

production of inflammatory mediators. One of the most important requisites for clinical 

application of a biomaterial is its biocompatibility, that is defined as the ability of a material to 

perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application (22). The local reaction of 

an implant is studied histologically after a 3 months implantation period, as described in ISO 

standard 10993-6 (23). 

 For this study, described in chapter VII, Wistar rats were used. Scaffolds were 

implanted subcutaneously and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, samples were retrieved for further 

analysis. Animals were anesthetized by an IP injection of a solution of 75//0.5 mg/kg body 

weight ketamine:metedomidine (Imalgene®:Dorbenvet®). Subcutaneous (SC) pockets were 

created and 4 scaffolds were placed in each animal, away from the sutures site (incision) to 

avoid inflammation of the wound. The anaesthesia was then reverted with a SC injection of 

0.25 mg/kg Atipamezol (Antisedan®). After recovering from anaesthesia, animals were 

placed in their home cages and water and food were supplied ad libitum. Each animal 

received an SC injection of 1mg/kg analgesic Butorphanol (Torbugesic®) administered 

immediately after surgery and 24 h later, to avoid post-operative pain. At each time point, 3 

animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium penthobarbital, at a lethal 

dose and the respective implants were retrieved.  

 

5.3. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice 
 The in vivo approach should mimic the future clinical application envisaged and the 

bone defect must not heal spontaneously, i.e., a critical size defect (CSD) should be created 

(20). The work developed was described in detail in chapter VII. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 62 

 Athymic nude mice were used to examine the healing of cranial critical size bone 

defects filled with transplants of pre-cultured constructs. All procedures involving the use of 

animals were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care 

and Use Committee of the Technion, Haifa in Israel. In brief, the in vitro constructs (with 

1x106 cells) were cultured in osteogenic inducing medium for 2 weeks prior to implantation. 

The surgery consisted on drilling 2 bilateral critical size circular defects (5 mm diameter and 

1mm thick) in the parietal bones of the skull on either side of the sagittal suture line, with a 

hand drill and trephine bit. Extremely care was taken to not damage the sagittal suture or to 

interrupt the dura matter beneath the bone. During procedure, sterile saline was dripped over 

the drilling site, in order to avoid extensive heating and to protect brain tissue. Surgeries were 

performed under general anesthesia (xylazine: ketamine 1:1 solution in saline) by IP 

injection. Scaffolds (scaffolds seeded and cultured for 2 weeks with 1x106 hBMSC and 

scaffold without cells) were implanted into the defects. A total of 6 nude mice were used and 

12 cranial defects were created. Animals were kept under aseptic conditions. After 8 weeks 

post-surgery, animals were euthanized and crania were removed, cleaned and fixed 

immediately in formalin to be further analyzed by micro computed tomography analysis. 

 

5.4. In vivo results analysis 

5.4.1. Histological evaluation 

 Histological sections show the tissue inside of implant as well as the tissue 

surrounding it. To further identify the resident cells of those tissues, sections must be stained 

with specific staining. Retrieved samples at each time point were fixed in 10% neutral 

buffered formalin. The fixed samples were dehydrated and further embedded in paraffin, as 

described in subsection 4.3.1. The specimens were sectioned to obtain 3 µm thick 

longitudinal and transverse sections. 

 

5.4.1.1. Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining 

 H&amp;amp;E staining is a standard protocol to identify microscopically the morphology of the 

cells in tissues. Haematoxylin stains the nucleus with a dark blue color. Eosin stains the 

cytoplasm of the cell with a pink colour. Thus, the main cell structures are easily indentified. 

A standard protocol for H&amp;amp;E staining was used. Stained sections were observed by light 

microscopy. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 63 

5.4.1.2. Masson´s trichrome staining 

 Masson´s trichrome stain was performed to analyze the amount and distribution of 
mature collagen, differentiating the collagen fibers from smooth muscle and elastin fibers. 

Sections were stained with Weigert?s haematoxilin at RT, for 5 min and washed with water. 

After that, slides were stained with ponceau-fucsin solution and washed. Then, slides were 

immersed in phosphomolibdic acid to remove the previous stain. Finally, sections were 

stained with light green, washed and immediately placed in ethanol 95% and then in xylene. 

Finally, they were mounted with Histofluid (Marienfeld GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG, Germany) and 

observed by light microscopy (BX61, Olympus Corporation, Germany) and images captured 

with a digital camera (DP70, Olympus Corporation, Germany). 

 

5.4.1.3. Immunohistochemistry 

 Immunohistochemistry principle is based on a highly specific reaction antigen-

antibody, which implies that a determined antibody only reacts with a specific antigen. For 

formalin fixed and paraffin embedded sections, the most used protocol involves the use of an 

enzyme conjugated with a secondary antibody with specificity to the primary antibody used. 

This enzyme reacts with a specific protein (avidin or streptavidin), which will be revealed by a 

dye, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Immunolocalization of a specific antibody is 

detected by a brown staining visible at light microscopy. 

 Immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) antibody was performed to 

evaluate the new vascularization (24). In order to perform immunohistochemistry, paraffin 

was removed. The antigen retrieval was heat induced in a water bath at 96ºC for 20 min, with 

incubation of the slides in citrate buffer (pH=6). The slides were washed with phosphate 

buffer saline and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 

in methanol, at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. R.T.U. Vectastain® Universal Elite ABC 

Kit (Vector, VCPK-7200, USA) was used for antibody incubation, according to the 

instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, sections were incubated with ?-SMA primary 

antibody (Abcam, ab5694, UK) overnight at 4ºC, in a humidified atmosphere. After washing 

with phosphate buffered saline, antibody detection was revealed by using the Peroxidase 

Substrate Kit DAB (Vector, VCSK-4100). Slides were washed in water for 5 minutes and then 

counterstained with Harris? haematoxylin for nuclear contrast, at RT for 2 min. After this, 

samples were washed with water, dehydrated in graded ethanol (50, 70, 95 and 100%), 

cleared with xylene, and mounted with Histofluid (Marienfeld GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG, Germany). 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 64 

Slides were observed by light microscopy (BX61, Olympus Corporation, Germany) and 

images captured with a digital camera (DP70, Olympus Corporation, Germany). 

 

5.4.2. Bone regeneration analysis by micro computed tomography  

 Entire crania were analyzed using a high-resolution ?CT 1072 scanner (Skyscan, 

Kontich, Belgium). Specimens were scanned in high-resolution mode using a pixel size of 

19.13 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source was set at 91 keV of energy and 

110 ?A of current. For all the scanned specimens representative data sets of 1023 slices 

were transformed into binary using a dynamic threshold of 255-120, to distinguish bone from 

polymeric material. This data was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyzer v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan). 3D virtual models of the mice crania were created, visualized and registered using 

image processing software (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan).

CHAPTER III 

Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem 

cell line (BMC9) seeded on novel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds 
 

ABSTRACT 

 The aim of the present work is to study the biological behavior of a mouse 

mesenchymal stem cell line when seeded and cultured under osteogenic conditions onto 

novel processed melt based chitosan scaffolds.  

 Scaffolds were produced by compression molding, followed by salt leaching. 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and µCT analysis showed the pore sizes 

ranging between 250 to 500 µm and the interconnectivity of the porous structure. The 

chitosan-PBS scaffolds presented the high mechanical properties, similar to the ones of 

trabecular bone (E1% ~ 87.4MPa). Cytotoxicity assays were carried out using standard tests 

(accordingly to ISO/EN 10993 part 5 guidelines), namely MTS test with a 24 h extraction 

period, revealing that L929 cells had similar metabolic activities to that obtained for the 

negative control.  

 Cell culture studies were conducted using a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line 

(BMC9). Cells were seeded onto the scaffold and allowed to proliferate for 3 weeks, under 

osteogenic conditions. SEM observations demonstrated that cells were able to proliferate 

and massively colonize the scaffolds structure. The cell viability assay MTS demonstrated 

that BMC9 cells were viable after 3 weeks in culture. The cells clearly evidenced a positive 

differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage, as confirmed by the high ALP activity levels. 

Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed the presence of Ca and 

P in the elaborated extracellular matrix (ECM). 

 These combined results indicate that the novel melt based chitosan/polyester 

scaffolds support the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the mouse 

MSCs and shows adequate physicochemical and biological properties for being used as 

scaffolds in bone tissue engineering related strategies.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 The last 15 years have witnessed the emergence of a novel multidisciplinary field of 

science called Tissue Engineering that has been in the forefront of a new wave of 

therapeutic/regenerative approaches for a variety of tissues, including bone. Its main 

purposes are the production of tissues and organs substitutes/equivalents that can replace or 

restore the natural features and physiological functions of natural tissues in vivo (1, 2).   

 The most common approach used in the bone tissue engineering field is based on the 

seeding of cells with osteogenic potential, commonly mesenchymal stem cells, on three 

dimensional (3D) scaffolds followed either by direct implantation on the injury site or by an in 

vitro culturing period upon which the construct is implanted (3). Ultimately, these so-called 

bone tissue engineering constructs should have two main functions when implanted in vivo 

(4-6): 1) provide structural support until the neotissue can assure it by itself and 2) promote 

osteoinduction, meaning in a simplistic way, the promotion of migration and differentiation of 

mesenchymal stem and osteoprogenitor cells, which later will lead to new bone formation. 

From the lines above it can be clearly concluded that 3D scaffolds play a major role within 

any bone tissue engineering concept. Ideally these temporary scaffolds should be porous in 

order to accommodate cell growth and facilitate both tissue regeneration and vascularization 

(1, 2, 7). Furthermore, they should also be biocompatible, mechanically stable under loads 

and have a physiologic biodegradation rate similar to the cell/tissue growth rates (1, 2, 7, 8). 

 Up to now, several materials, such as titanium alloys (9-11), ceramics (12-14) and 

biodegradable polymers (15-18) have been used to obtain these 3D structures. Among those 

materials, and due to their intrinsic characteristics, biodegradable polymers are those that 

have been used more frequently. The most widely used are poly(?-hydroxy acids), such as 

poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), and their copolymers because they have been already 

accepted by regulatory agencies. In spite of the fact that these materials have been 

thoroughly studied and extensively used in the clinical practice, it is also true that upon 

degradation they release acidic by-products, which may trigger inflammatory responses and 

compromise the needed integration by the host tissue (19, 20). 

 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new biomaterials with 

scaffolding potential for bone tissue engineering. It is in this context that natural based 

polymers have been put forward in the last few years. Within this group, the polysaccharides, 

like starch (19, 21, 22) and chitosan (23-29) have been highlighted as the most promising, as 

they may act as analogs of polyssacharides present in vivo and adopt their roles (24). An

novel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds 

73 

example of such affinity is the structural similarity observed between chitosan and 

glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (29). Several reports about chitosan (23-29), the alkaline 

deacetylated product of chitin, have shown that this polymer might have a range of 

interesting properties, from biodegradability to biocompatibility, considered to be suitable for 

bone tissue engineering scaffolding. Nevertheless, chitosan still presents a challenge when 

compared to other materials, that is, the inability of being processed by means other than by 

solvent based technology, which frequently leads to the development of scaffolds with poor 

mechanical properties and insufficient control of its morphology.  

 Since 2005, we have developed a new concept based on the development of 

thermoplastic chitosan polymers (30-33). This was achieved by melt-blending chitosan with 

different aliphatic polyesters, poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), 

poly(butylene terephthalate adipate) (PBTA), and poly(butylene succinate adipate) (PBSA). 

By doing this, we conjugated the favourable biological properties of chitosan with the 

predictable degradative behavior of the aliphatic polyesters. Further information on the 

physical and chemical properties of these materials can be found in the reports of Correlo et 

al. (30-33).  

 The present study reports on the morphology, mechanical properties, 

cytocompatibility, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mesenchymal stem cell 

line - BMC9 - on novel compression molding/salt leaching scaffolds based on blends of 

chitosan with PCL, PBS, PBTA and PBSA. Results have showed that the developed 

scaffolds had the adequate mechanical properties. Furthermore, they disclosed a non-

cytotoxic behavior and simultaneously supported the growth and osteogenic differentiation of 

mouse mesenchymal stem cells within its structure. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Scaffolds production and processing 

 Chitosan was melt blended with several biodegradable polyesters for the first time by 

our group (31) a twin screw extruder with the purpose of producing scaffolds for tissue 

engineering applications. For the development of this work, the polyesters compounded with 

chitosan (ch) were PBS, PCL and PBTA. In all of these blends there was a rate of 50% (wt%) 

chitosan with 50% (wt%) polyester.  



CHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on 
novel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds 

74 

 The methodology used for the scaffolds production was melt based compression 

molding followed by salt leaching. The details of the processing conditions are described 

elsewhere (32). Briefly, the developed blends were grained and the powder mixed with salt 

particles with sizes between 250 and 500 µm. The chitosan based blends mixed with salt 

were loaded into a mold that was further heated and compression molded into discs. The salt 

content was 60% by weight. The discs were cut into 5x5x5 mm3 cubes. These cubes were 

then immersed in distilled water to leach out the salt, dried, sterilized by ethylene oxide and 

used for cell culture studies.  

 

2.2. Scaffolds characterization 

 The cross-section of all the developed scaffolds was analyzed using a Leica-

Cambridge S-360 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for preliminary assessment on the 

scaffolds morphology. All the samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to SEM 

observations. 

 To investigate the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds, Micro-Computed Tomography 

equipment (SkyScan, Belgium) was used as a non-destructive technique. Four scaffolds of 

each condition were scanned in high resolution mode of 8.7 µm x/y/z and an exposure time 

of 1792 ms. The energy of the scanner used was 63 keV with 157 µA current. µCT scans 

followed by 3D reconstruction of serial image sections allowed to analyze 3D 

microarchitecture of the scaffolds, pore morphology as well as the determination of the 

porosity. 

 Uniaxial compression tests were performed on a square cross-section specimen of 

scaffolds using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal Machine). A 

crosshead speed of 2 mm/min was used. The values reported were the average of at least 

five specimens. The compressive modulus was determined by selecting the linear region of 

the stress-strain graph. 

 
2.3. Cell culture 

 A fibroblast cell line of rat lung - L929 -, acquired from the european collection of cell 

cultures (ECACC), was used for cytotoxicity tests. The cells were grown as monolayers in 

Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium (DMEM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% 

foetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic

75 

mixture (10000 U/ml penicillin G sodium; 10000 U/ml streptomycin sulphate; 25 ?g/ml 

amphotericin B) (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). Trypsin/EDTA (0.25% w/v trypsin/0.02% EDTA, 

Sigma) was used to detach the cells from the culture flasks before the experiments were 

conducted. 

 

2.3.1. Cell viability assay - MTS test  

           The ratio of material weight to extract fluid was constant and equal to 0.25 g/ml. Latex 

rubber and standard culture medium were used as positive and negative controls, 

respectively. Latex rubber is known to have a strong cytotoxic effect leading to extensive cell 

death. For the positive control the ratio of material outer surface to extraction fluid was 2.5 

cm2/ml. Test material (n=6) and positive control were extracted for 24 h at 37ºC, using 

complete culture medium as extraction fluid. Before the tests, culture medium was removed 

and an identical volume (200 ?l) of extraction fluid was added to each well. 

 Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (n=6) at a density of 1.8x104 cells/well and 

incubated for 24 h at 37ºC, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. A kit (CellTiter 96 One 

solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit - Promega, Madison, WI) was used and it is based on the 

reduction of the substrate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-

sulfofenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), into a brown formazan product by dehydrogenase enzymes 

active in the viable cells. After 72 h, the extraction fluid was removed and 200 ?l of a serum-

free culture medium without phenol red and MTS, in a proportion of 5:1, was added to each 

well. Cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% 

CO2. After this time, optical density (O.D.) was measured with a plate reader (Bio-tek, model 

Synergy HTi, USA) at 490 nm. The O.D. values obtained were standardized taking into 

account the values for the negative control. 

 

2.4. Cell culture studies 

2.4.1. Cell seeding and culture 

 A mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) was used. This conditionally 

immortalized clone was shown to exhibit four mesenchymal cell phenotypes: chondrocyte, 

adipocyte, stromal (support osteoclast formation), and osteoblast (34). The cells were grown 

as monolayer cultures in a culture medium consisting of DMEM medium, 10% FBS and 1% 

antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. When the adequate cell number was obtained, cells at

novel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds 

76 

passage 10 were trypsinized, centrifuged and ressuspended in cell culture medium. Cells 

were seeded at a density of 5x105cells/scaffold under static conditions, using for this purpose 

aliquots of 10 ?L loaded on the top of scaffolds. Two hours after seeding, 1 ml of culture 

medium was added to each well. The cell-seeded scaffolds were maintained in a humidified 

atmosphere at 37ºC, containing 5% CO2, under osteogenic differentiation inducing medium, 

during 21 days. The culture medium consisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone 

10-8 M (Sigma), ascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma) and ß-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma), and 

was changed every 3 to 4 days until the end of the experiment. 

 

2.4.2. Cellular viability assay - MTS test 

 Cell viability was assessed after 3 h, 7, 14 and 21 days, by using the MTS test. The 

cell-seeded scaffolds (n=6) were rinsed in 0.15M phosphate buffered saline (Sigma) and 

immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent at 5:1 

ratio and incubated for 3 h at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After this, 

200 ?l (n=6) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) determined at 

490 nm.  

 

2.4.3. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM 

 Cell adhesion, morphology and average distribution were observed by SEM. The cell-

seeded scaffolds were washed in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline.  

 After rinsing 3 times in phosphate buffered saline, the constructs were dehydrated 

using a series of graded ethyl alcohols (30, 50, 70, 90, 100% ethanol) for 15 minutes each, 

twice. Then, the samples were subjected to 2 changes for 15 minutes each with 100% 

hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, USA). Finally 

HDMS was removed and let to air dry for 2h. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated 

with gold (JEOL JFC-1100) and analyzed with a Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron 

microscope.

77 

2.4.4. Cell adhesion and cell viability by calcein AM staining through confocal laser 

microscopy  

 Cells were incubated with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Oregan, USA). Once inside 

the cells, this compound is hydrolyzed by endogenous esterase into the highly negatively 

charged green fluorescent calcein, which is retained in the cytoplasm. The cell-seeded 

scaffolds were sectioned and cell adhesion and viability was observed in the inner regions of 

the scaffolds using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser microscope. 

 

2.4.5. Histology 

 Eight-micron-thick sections from the 3 weeks culture of the constructs were cut with a 

cryomicrotome (CM 1900; Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and mounted on poly-L-lysine 

(Sigma) coated slides. Slides were stained with H&amp;amp;E and observed under optical microscope. 

 

2.4.6. Alkaline phosphatase quantification 

 A description of the assay can be found elsewhere (35). Briefly, the level of alkaline 

phosphatase (ALP) activity from the constructs (n=3) was quantified by the specific 

conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) into p-nitrophenol (pNP). The cell-

seeded scaffolds were allowed to thaw at room temperature and then were sonicated for 

roughly 15 min. The enzyme reaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml 

of substrate buffer containing 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNPP. The 

solution was incubated at 37ºC for 1 h and the reaction was then stopped by a solution 

containing 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The optical density was 

determined at 405 nm. A standard curve was made using pNP values ranging from 0 to 20 

?mol/ml. The results are expressed in ?mol of pNP produced/ml/h. 

 

2.4.7. Mineralization content by EDS 

 The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM. The samples were 

sputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100), in order to verify the presence of calcium and 

phosphate elements with a Leica Cambridge S360 electronic microscope.

2.5. Statistical analysis 

 Statistical evaluation was performed using 2 tailed paired t-student tests, to assess 

the statistical differences between each two groups of different time points. Statistical 

significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 for a 95% confidence interval. 

 

3. RESULTS  

3.1. Scaffolds characterization 

 The mechanical properties (compressive modulus) of the developed scaffolds are 

presented in table I. The compressive modulus of the thermally produced scaffolds is in the 

range of the trabecular bone modulus (36).  

 

Table I. Compressive modulus and porosity of the 50% (wt) chitosan based scaffolds 

produced by melt based compression molding with salt leaching (60% salt and granulometry 

of 250-500 ?m). 

Composition Compressive Modulus (MPa) Porosity (%) 

50Ch-50PBS 87.4±21.6 59.9 ± 6.5 

50Ch-50PCL 53.1±23.7 63.9 ± 0.7 

50C/50PBTA 21.8±7.8 59.4 ± 3.8 
 

 Scaffolds with higher and lower compressive modulus are the ones obtained using 

the blends Ch-PBS and Ch-PBTA, respectively. These results are in accordance with 

previous results obtained with compact injection molded samples (31).  

 

 Representative ?CT images of the entire scaffolds (300 slices) are shown in figure 1. 

Three dimensional reconstructions of the bulk of the scaffolds were also performed. No 

considerable differences in terms of morphology were observed between the more interior 

parts (bulk) of the scaffolds and the most exterior ones. Two dimensional X-ray ?CT images, 

with a region of interest of 4.5x4.5 mm, were also analyzed (figure not shown).

79 

 

Figure 1. Representative 3D ?CT image of the scaffolds obtained using chitosan based 
blends and NaCl particles with size 250-500 ?m. 

 

 No significant morphological differences were observed between scaffolds produced 

using different chitosan based blends. Pores resulting from the leaching of the NaCl particles 

mimic the cubic shape of the porogen used. The scaffolds have a very narrow distribution of 

pores dimensions coincident with the NaCl particles size. Two dimensional binary images 

were analyzed for total porosity calculations. The porosity values presented in table I are the 

average of the individual porosity of 300 slices per scaffold. For each processing condition, 4 

scaffolds were analyzed. As expected, porosity depended on the amount of porogen used. In 

all the cases the porosity was very similar to the amount of salt used.  

 

3.2. Mechanical properties 

 The nominal stress – nominal strain curves for the developed chitosan-polyester 

scaffolds are shown in figure 2. The compressive modulus was calculated as the slope of the 

linear most region of the stress-strain curve prior to the yield point and their value is shown in 

table I. As expected, the shape of the stress-strain curve, and consequently the modulus, 

varies with the type of polyester. Scaffolds with higher and lower compressive modulus are 

the ones obtained using the blends Ch-PBS and Ch-PBTA, respectively. These results are in 

accordance with previous results obtained with compact injection molded samples (31). 

Nevertheless, the compressive modulus of the thermally produced scaffolds is in the range of 

the trabecular bone modulus (36).

3.3. In vitro cytotoxicity tests 

 In the MTS test (Figure 3), L929 cells produced large amounts of the brown formazan 

product after incubation with the tested extract. This fact shows that cells had similar 

metabolic activities (about 80%) to those obtained by the negative control and were able to 

incorporate and metabolize MTS and hence, showed their viability. Therefore, the leachables 

released from the tested scaffolds could be considered as non-cytotoxic.

scaffolds. Results are based on optical density measurements, at O.D. of 490 nm and 

normalized for the negative control (n=6; ±sd; p&lt;0.05).

3.4. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM 

 Regarding the present experiment, SEM observations allowed to determine that 

mouse MSCs were able to adhere to the surface of the chitosan-polyester based scaffolds, 

where a monolayer of cells could be observed after 1 week in culture (Figures 4a, 4b, 4c). 

Furthermore it should be highlighted that there was no pore occlusion by the cells (Figure 

4d), which demonstrated the adequacy of the pore size range within the scaffolds (250-500 

?m).  

 

Figure 4. SEM micrographs of BMC9 cells adhesion and proliferation, under osteogenic 
stimulation, on the 50% wt Ch-PBS scaffolds after a) 1 b) 2 and c) 3 weeks of culture; on the 

50% wt Ch-PCL scaffolds after d) 1 e) 2 and f) 3 weeks of culture and on the 50% wt Ch-PCL 

scaffolds after g) 1 h) 2 and i) 3 weeks of culture.  

 

 By week 2 it was possible to observe a higher degree of colonization, denoting a 

multilayer of cells and the onset of elaboration of extracellular matrix (ECM), at the surface of 

all the scaffolds obtained from different chitosan based blends (Figures 4e, 4f). A closer 

observation demonstrated that in the blend composed by chitosan and PBS there was a 

higher degree of proliferation of the cells including the ones in the inner regions of the 

scaffolds (Figure 4g). Furthermore, by observing the inside scaffold?s inner regions (Figure 5) 



CHAPTER III. Adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9) seeded on 
novel melt based chitosan/polyester 3D porous scaffolds 

82 

it was shown that the cells were also capable of colonizing these areas, without occluding the 

pores of the scaffolds structure.

 After 3 weeks, further development of the cell number and surface density were 

observed, indicating that the BMC9 cells massively adhered and proliferated within all the 

chitosan based scaffolds, also showing a calcified ECM elaboration (Figure 9).  

 The scaffolds composed by Ch-PBS showed cell adhesion and colonization of the 

surface and inner regions (Figure 5), and simultaneously evidencing the elaboration of a 

mineralized extracellular matrix, shown by the presence of Ca and P, by EDS analysis 

(Figure 9a).  

 

3.5. Cell viability by MTS assay/ calcein AM staining 

 Tracking the survival/activity of the cells seeded on the scaffolds from the time of 

seeding until implantation might be helpful for the optimization on the development of bone 

tissue engineered constructs (37).  

 Results showed that the tested MSCs were able to reduce MTS, showing increasing 

metabolic rates with increasing time of culture (Figure 6), and denoting a high viability and 

proliferation profile.

 Cell viability assay with calcein AM staining (Figures 7a, 7b and 7c) confirmed the 

SEM results, where BMC9 cells were metabolically active in the scaffolds after 3 weeks in 

static culture. Moreover, with these results it can be established a time dependent cell 

proliferation, as it is notorious the presence of a higher number of cells for the latest time 

period.

3.6. Alkaline phosphatase quantification 

 For all tested blends, ALP activity (Figure 8) increased until the second week, 

reflecting probably the early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. After this period, 

ALP activity decreased, presumably due to the onset of the mineralization process (36), 

denoting in this sense a positive indication of the transient character of the differentiation of 

the cells into the osteogenic lineage. Once more, the best results were evidenced by the 

scaffolds produced from the Ch-PBS blend, which showed the higher values of the ALP 

activity. 

 

Figure 8. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay: supernatants were weekly collected and 
frozen. After 3 weeks, supernatants were thawed. The results are shown in p-nitrophenol 

(?mol/ml/h) as a function of days. On day 7, cells were stimulated with 10 mM 

glycerophosphate (Sigma), 50 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 10-8 M dexamethasone 

(Sigma). The ALP levels increased, reaching the highest values after 2 weeks in culture (n=6; 

±sd; p&lt;0.05). 

 

3.7. Mineralization content by EDS analysis 

 The EDS analysis of the surface of the seeded and cultured scaffolds with mouse 

MSCs under osteogenic conditions for 21 days (Figure 9) detected the presence of Ca and P 

elements on the surface, being therefore, a clear indication of the formation of a mineralized 

ECM.

4. DISCUSSION 

 In the last few years, natural based polymers have been presented as biomaterials for 

tissue engineered scaffolding. Among these, chitosan has emerged as one of the most 

promising, namely by its biodegradability, biocompatibility and its resemblance to GAGs (23). 

 In this study we report the biological performance, in terms of cell adhesion, 

proliferation and differentiation of mouse MSCs seeded and cultured onto the newly 

developed chitosan based scaffolds. 

 The melt based approach used to produce the scaffolds allowed us to obtain 3D 

porous structures without the use of organic solvents that could remain in the structure and 

damage the transplanted cells or the surrounding tissues (after transplantation). The 

mechanical properties, in terms of compressive modulus, were in the range of those for 

trabecular bone properties (36). 

 The developed scaffolds revealed to be non-cytotoxic to fibroblast cells, since the 

leachables released during the extraction period did not affect cell viability as well as did not 

inflict changes in cell morphology. 

 Cells were able to colonize the scaffolds structure up to periods of 3 weeks. The cell 

proliferation was gradual and continuously increasing over time of culture, being more 

evident on the ch-PBS scaffolds. The differences observed for the different blends are 

probably related with the different surface chemistry and mechanical properties of the 3D 

scaffolds with the best results being noticed for the scaffolds produced from ch-PBS blend.  

 It is known that if cells are undergoing osteogenic differentiation, ALP is considered to 

be one of the early markers (38). Although not being specific for the osteoblast lineage, ALP

86 

is used typically to illustrate the early differentiation into a bone related phenotype, which is 

noticed by the increase of the enzyme activity until the second week.  

 The presence of Ca and P elements on the surface of the cell-seeded scaffolds 

revealed the presence of a mineralized ECM. This fact is in agreement with the data obtained 

for alkaline phosphatase experiments, showing that cells had undergone an osteogenic 

differentiation and were elaborating mineralized ECM. 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 With the present study it was possible to show that the scaffolds based on 50:50 

(wt%) blends of chitosan and synthetic polyesters (PBS, PCL and PBTA) present a range of 

properties that are considered to be adequate for bone tissue engineering applications. 

 Scaffolds produced by compression molding followed by salt leaching were shown to 

be non-cytotoxic and clearly cytocompatible. The results of the direct contact assays under 

osteogenic conditions revealed that the three types of chitosan-based scaffolds selected for 

this study promoted the attachment and proliferation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells. 

Furthermore, they also presented high indexes of alkaline phosphatase activity and the 

production of a calcified ECM, which is due to the differentiation towards the osteogenic 

pathway. From the three tested blends, the chitosan-PBS blend showed the best results, 

namely in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation. Nevertheless the other blends also 

presented adequate properties for bone tissue engineering. 

 Due to the good combination of properties and excellent biological performance, it is 

strongly believed that the scaffolds herein proposed will be a valid alternative to the currently 

used materials when considering bone regeneration/tissue engineering applications.

ABSTRACT 

 Chitosan has been showing promising results for bone tissue engineering 
applications, namely for modulating cell behaviour in vitro and promoting bone regeneration 

in vivo. Previous results from our group evidenced that chitosan poly(butylene succinate) 

melt based scaffolds showed remarkable biological performance. This fact brought up the 

question of the role of chitosan in this specific blend. For this purpose scaffolds with 50% of 

chitosan (Ch) and 50% poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), 25% of Ch and 75% of PBS and 

100% PBS were produced by compression molding and salt leaching. These scaffolds were 

evaluated in vitro with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and in vivo 

by implanting them in different anatomical regions (cranial defect model, iliac submuscular 

and auricular areas) in Wistar rats. Higher percentages of chitosan favoured better biological 

performance, when compared to PBS scaffolds alone. Cells showed enhanced viability over 

time, evidencing superior cell adhesion and proliferation. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase 

(ALP) activity and gene expression showed that cells were undergoing osteogenic 

differentiation in chitosan containing scaffolds. For all in vitro studies, PBS scaffolds 

presented inferior biological performance when compared to chitosan based scaffolds. 

 Scaffolds displayed a normal and mild inflammatory response after one month 

implantation and integrated well with the surrounding tissues. Connective tissue cells 

colonized the scaffolds structures. Tissue responses were milder in auricular and calvaria 

implantations when compared to the submuscular. Chitosan scaffolds evidenced better 

results, with enhanced cell penetration, without cell necrosis and large number of blood 

vessels in the proximity and inside the scaffolds.  

 The addition of chitosan positively influenced the osteogenic differentiation of 

hBMSCs, and also showed enhanced tissue biocompatibility, as compared to PBS alone. 

Considering the results herein reported it is reasonable to state that chitosan-PBS scaffolds 

demonstrate appropriate properties both in vitro and in vivo to be used in bone tissue 

engineering applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 A new field known as Tissue Engineering has recently emerged, having potential to 

overcome the increasing number of clinical needs for bone regeneration mainly due to the 

aging of population. This multidisciplinary approach involves the basic principles of 

engineering and life sciences, in order to develop biological substitutes aimed at restore, 

maintain or improve a tissue function or a whole organ (1). Firstly, a tissue construct is 

created, using cells and scaffolds. This scaffold is further matured in vitro, and then 

transplanted and integrated into the host defect site (2). Frequently, the cells are seeded and 

cultured onto a natural or synthetic biodegradable scaffold. The ideal scaffold must fulfill a 

number of requirements that include being biocompatible with specific biodegradability 

kinetics and should possess adequate porosity, pore size and mechanical properties 

compatible with the loads to which will be subjected (3).  

 Among the various natural polymers available, chitosan has emerged as a candidate 

biomaterial to produce biodegradable scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. The first 

report about the partially deacetylated form of chitin (chitosan) dates back from the 19th 

century (4). Chitosan presents biological properties that makes it appropriated to develop 

scaffolds for tissue engineering, including its biodegradability (5, 6), antibacterial activity (7, 

8), haemostatic and wound healing properties (9, 10), biocompatibility (11, 12) and easy 

accessibility. It is a linear polysaccharide composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl 

glucosamine with a ? (1-4) link (13). Chitosan has a cationic character, which allows 

electrostatic interactions with anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans. 

Moreover, the chemical structure of chitosan has similarities with the structure of GAGs (14). 

These molecules play an important role in the modulation of cell function, morphology and 

differentiation.(13).  

 Interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide essential cues used 

by the cells to influence and adapt its intra and extracellular environment (15). Chitosan by 

itself or in combination with other biomaterials has been reported to have a positive effect 

over the cell behavior. Polystyrene coated with chitosan solution has shown cytocompatibility 

as a substrate for growth of human osteoblasts and chondrocytes (16). Poly-(L-lactide acid) 

(PLLA) films modified with chitosan evidenced improved cell adhesion, proliferation and 

biosynthetic activity, using articular chondrocytes (17). Commercially available chitosan 

supports the initial attachment and spreading of osteoblasts preferentially over fibroblasts 

(18). MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic-like cells proliferated and evidenced increased alkaline 

phosphatase activity, as well as up-regulation of osteogenic gene expression, in composite

and in vivo tissue response 

95 

chitosan/poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) scaffolds as compared to poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid) 

scaffolds (19). In fact, in a recent study by Wu and co-workers, different proportions of 

poly(caprolactone)/chitosan scaffolds evidenced better results for the blends with higher 

chitosan content, using rat osteoblasts (20). Moreover, nanofibrous scaffolds containing 

chitosan revealed that stem cells adhere, proliferate and express phenotypic markers of 

osteogenic differentiation in a superior level than synthetic nanofibrous scaffolds without 

chitosan (21, 22). It has been described in the literature that combined chitosan–collagen 

matrices, with higher proportion of chitosan promoted osteoblastic differentiation of hBMSCs 

and improved the mechanical and physical properties of the sponges (23). Previous studies 

from our group, using chitosan particle aggregated scaffolds, evidenced good results favoring 

osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of adipose derived stem cells (24). Another work 

from our group reported that discs composed of chitosan-PBS and other biodegradable 

polyesters, obtained by injection molding, showed that chitosan had a positive effect over 

osteoblast-like cells activity in vitro (25). 

 Chitosan is difficult to be processed by methods that do not require the use of 

solvents. Accordingly, there is the need to combine it with other polymers to improve its 

processability. By this combination, the mechanical properties of the resulting biomaterial can 

also be improved to become adequate for load bearing tissues, such as bone (26). 

Previously, we proposed a methodology to process chitosan with aliphatic polyesters, 

facilitating its processing by melt and avoiding the need of solvents (27, 28). This processing 

route involves melt-based compression molding followed by particle leaching. Details about 

this technique were described elsewhere (28). Briefly, several aliphatic polyesters in different 

percentages were blended with chitosan. These various scaffold formulations were evaluated 

in vitro for osteogenic applications, using a mouse MSC cell line (BMC9). The composition 

having chitosan–PBS (50% wt) evidenced the strongest results, in terms of both cell 

adhesion and proliferation (29). These results raised the question of why this specific blend 

shows such enhanced cell behavior. We herein addressed this important question by 

studying different blends with two different concentrations of chitosan: chitosan-PBS (25-75% 

wt) and chitosan-PBS (50% wt), as well as, without chitosan, with only PBS (100% wt), with 

human MSCs seeded and cultured in osteogenic conditions. In vivo tissue response was 

evaluated by implanting scaffolds with the extreme compositions, chitosan-PBS (50% wt) and 

scaffolds without chitosan (PBS 100) in Wistar rats. The implantation locations were defined 

to evaluate the inflammatory response in regions with different degrees of vascularization. 

The regions were the cranial bone that is a region with relevance for the intended application, 

submuscular, a highly vascularized location and auricular area, which is a region with lower

vascularization. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. Scaffolds processing  

 The aim of this specific study required the production of scaffolds with different 

compositions of chitosan and PBS. Namely, we produced scaffolds having 100% of polyester 

(PBS 100); 25% of chitosan and 75% of PBS (Ch-PBS 25-75); and 50% of chitosan and 50% 

PBS (Ch-PBS 50-50). In both cases, the composition is in a weight basis.  

 Chitosan and PBS powder were melt blended by extrusion. The extrudate was 

subsequently grinded into powder. This powder was physically mixed with NaCl particles with 

controlled sizes (obtained by sieving) and processed by compression molding into large 

discs. These large discs were subsequently sectioned to obtain the required geometry for the 

final scaffolds. The sectioning was performed using a CNC equipment (3D Plotter MDX-20 – 

Roland), which allows cutting solid objects in a controlled and reproducible manner. In a first 

stage, the outer skin of the large disk produced initially by compression molding was 

removed. A plate with the final required thickness was obtained from where smaller discs 

were cut with the desired geometries to be used as scaffolds. A subsequent salt leaching 

process was performed by immersion in water during a sufficient period to allow all NaCl 

particles to be dissolved and leached out. In this way, porous scaffolds with controlled 

geometry are obtained. Specific details of the processing conditions are described elsewhere 

(28). Taking into account the final applications, we herein produced discs with diameters of 8 

mm and two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm. Finally, the discs intended to be used in 

further cell culture studies or for in vivo implantation were sterilized by ethylene oxide. 

 

2.1.1. Scaffolds characterization by micro computed tomography (µCT) 

 A micro computed tomography equipment µCT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, 

Knotich, Belgium) was used to analyze the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds. Three 

scaffolds of each formulation were scanned in high-resolution, using a resolution pixel size of 

8.79 µm and exposure time of 1.792 ms. The energy of scanner was selected to use 63 keV 

and 157 µA current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a rotation range of 

180º with a rotation step of 0.45º. µCT scans were reconstructed using a cone-beam

and in vivo tissue response 

97 

reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, also from SkyScan). Representative data sets of 

200 sections were segmented into binary images with a dynamic threshold of 150 to 255 

(grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis including porosity, pore 

interconnectivity and mean pore size (CT analyzer, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to reconstruct 3D 

models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). 

 

2.1.2. Mechanical tests  

 Compression tests were performed for determining the compressive modulus of the 

developed scaffolds using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal 

Machine, USA). Tests were performed using a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min until 60% of 

strain was reached. Tested scaffolds were cylinders of approximately 8 mm in diameter and 

3 mm in thickness. The results presented are the average of testing at least five specimens. 

The compressive modulus was determined by selecting the most linear region of the stress-

strain graph. 

 

2.2. Cell studies 

 The biological performance of the scaffolds was assessed by in vitro assessment of 
cell adhesion, viability and osteogenic differentiation. Biocompatibility was analyzed by 

implanting the scaffolds in different body regions of Wistar rats. The parameters and 

conditions used in those tests will be described in detail in the current section. 

 

2.2.1. Cell seeding and cell culture 

Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) cells were grown in a 

culture medium consisting of alpha medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% fetal bovine serum 

(Biochrom AG, Germany), 5 mM L-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast 

growth factor (bFgF) (PeproTech, USA) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. 

Louis, MO).  When an adequate cell number was obtained, cells at passage 2 were detached 

with trypsin/EDTA. Cells were seeded by means of a cell suspension at a density of 2.8x105 

cells/scaffold under dynamic conditions (orbital shaker), during 24 h. The constructs were 

placed in new 24-well plates and 1 ml of osteogenic medium was added to each well. The

and in vivo tissue response

osteogenic culture medium consisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone 10-8 M 

(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ß-

glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The cell-constructs were cultured for 

periods of up to 7, 14 and 21 days in a humidified atmosphere at 37ºC, containing 5% CO2. 

The culture medium was changed every 2 to 3 days until the end of the experiment. 

 

2.2.2. Cell viability  

 Cell viability was assessed after 7, 14, and 21 days using the MTS test. The cell-

scaffold constructs (n=3) were rinsed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline solution (Sigma, 

USA), and immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS 

reagent in a 5:1 ratio. After that, the samples were incubated during 3 hours at 37ºC in a 

humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The optical density (O.D.) was measured on a 

microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm.  

 

2.2.3. Cell adhesion and morphology - scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

 The adhesion, morphology and spatial distribution of cells on the scaffolds were 

analyzed by SEM. The constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline solution and 

fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. After that, the constructs were dehydrated with increasing 

percentages of ethanol and let to air dry. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated with 

gold (JEOL JFC-1100) and analyzed using a SEM Leica Cambridge S360. 

 

2.2.4. Early osteogenic marker - alkaline phosphatase  

 Samples were collected as previously described. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity 

of the constructs (n=3) was measured by the specific conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate 

(pNpp) (Sigma, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The constructs were thawed at room 

temperature and sonicated during 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was set up by mixing 100 

µl of the sample with 300 µl of substrate buffer containing 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) 

and 2 mg/ml of pNpp. The solution was further incubated at 37ºC during 1 hour and the 

reaction was stopped by the addition of a solution containing 2 M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA

in distilled water. The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared using 

pNp values ranging from 0 to 20 ?mol/ml.  

 

2.2.5. Osteogenic gene expression -– real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) 

 Samples were collected after 7, 14 and 21 days of culture and Trizol® (Invitrogen, Life 

Technologies Inc., UK) was added to the constructs and immediately placed at -80ºC. Total 

RNA was isolated from cells with Trizol according to the manufacturer protocol. A NanoDrop 

microspectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Alfagene, USA) was used 

to measure the total RNA concentration. The integrity of the RNA samples was checked 

using denaturing agarose 1.2% gel electrophoresis. 

 The real time PCR analysis used in this work consisted of a two-step fluorogenic 

assay using the SyberGreen system (BioRad, USA). All the reagents used in this procedure 

were obtained from Bio-Rad in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.  

 cDNA synthesis was performed using iScriptTMcDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, USA). 

Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out using a reaction mixture consisting of 1X iScript 

Reaction Mix, 1?L iScript Reverse Transcriptase, RNA template (1 ?g of total RNA) and 

nuclease-free water was prepared to a final reaction volume of 40 ?L. After that stage, the 

obtained cDNA was used as template for the amplification of the genes. Specific genes, 

primer sequences and annealing temperatures are listed in Table I.

 Each real time PCR run was carried out with an initial incubation at 95ºC for 10 min 

followed by forty cycles of denaturation (95ºC, 10 s), annealing (temperature accordingly with 

the specific primer used, 30 s) and extension (72ºC, 30 s) in the gradient thermocycler 

MiniOpticon real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, USA). At the end of each cycle, the 

fluorescent products were detected and quantified. 

 GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene and the expression of all the target 

genes was normalized to the GAPDH of that sample in the respective time point. The 

obtained results were further analyzed with CFX Manager Software – version 1.5 (BioRad, 

USA).  

 

2.3. Animal model and surgical protocols 

 Twelve Wistar rats weighing between 250-300 g were used in the in vivo studies. All 

rats were fed ad libitum during the experiments. The animals were maintained in a 

temperature and humidity controlled environment at the animal research center of Hacettepe 

University. The study was conducted after receiving approval from the Animal Ethical 

Committee of the K?r?kkale University. A sterile surgical technique was applied 

throughout the surgical procedures. The scaffolds (8 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick) were 

previously sterilized by ethylene oxide. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection 

with a mixture of ketamine HCl (Parke Davis, 50 mg/ml, Taiwan) and Rompun (2%, Bayer, 

Germany). The implantation site of the tested animals was shaved and disinfected with 

Baticon solution (Droksan, 10%, Turkey). The scaffolds were implanted in 3 different 

anatomical regions (Figure 1) to analyze the inflammation extent in zones with different 

degrees of vascularization:  

(i) Cranial critical size defect: the periosteum was pulled back from the cranial 

surface, the cranial bone was removed by using a circular driller and the scaffold 

was immediately placed in the defect (inlay model), covered by the periosteum; 

(ii)  Auricular – ear: a pocket was made between the perichondrium and the ear 

cartilage and the scaffold was placed on the 1/3 proximal cartilage in the pocket;  

(iii) Submuscular: an incision of 10 mm was made to reach the iliac bone. The 

scaffold was placed between the periosteum and the iliac bone (onlay model). A 

total of 3 scaffolds per animal were implanted.  In all cases, the incision was 

closed using 5.0 silk sutures.

2.4. Statistical analysis 

 Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistic software (Release 15.0.0 
for Windows). A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to ascertain about the data normality and 

variance equality. The normality was strongly rejected and for the results obtained for cell 

viability and ALP assays, the non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis followed by Tukey?s HSD 

test was applied to compare the three independent groups of samples for each variable. P 

values lower than 0.01 were considered statistically significant in the analysis of the results. 

In the case of gene expression results, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. 

  

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Scaffolds characterization by µCT 

 The morphological analysis of the scaffolds was performed by µCT, by reconstructing 

scaffolds? tridimensional morphology (Figure 2).

PBS 50-50 scaffolds.

and in vivo tissue response  

102 

 The qualitative analysis of scaffolds morphology showed the consistency of the 

porous morphology of the produced scaffolds. The material composition does not affect the 

morphology and structure of the scaffolds developed by compression molding followed by 

salt leaching.  

 Individual 2D analysis of the binary images obtained along the scaffold cross-section 

consisting of 300 slices was carried out for morphometric calculations (Table II).  

  

Table II. Porosity, pore size, interconnectivity and compressive modulus of the produced 
scaffolds obtained by µCT 

 

Porosity (%) Pore size (µm) Interconnectivity (%)

50Ch-50PBS 69.6±7.1 184.4±11.9 90.8±1.5 22.8±9.9 

 

 

 The analysis showed that the produced scaffolds have a very high open porous 

network. The level of interconnectivity of the porosity ranges from 86.8±1.9% to 92.8±0.9%, 

which is adequate to allow the diffusion of cells into the inner regions of the scaffolds. The 

percentage of porosity was directly proportional to the quantity of the porogen used 

(approximately 60%), with a small but not statistically significant increase for higher 

percentages of chitosan. Pore sizes were in general lower than the size range of the salt 

particles used. This is maybe due to the fact that compression molding process tends to 

break down some salt particles, resulting in a pore size in the scaffolds slightly lower than the 

original size of the porogen particles (28). The pore range of 100-250 µm was already shown 

in literature to be suitable for bone regeneration (30). The values for the compressive 

modulus of the various scaffolds are also shown in Table II.  

 We observed that the formulation with lower chitosan content (25% wt) has the lowest 

compressive modulus of all produced scaffolds. The formulation with higher amount of 

chitosan (50% wt) shows the highest elastic modulus. However, it should be noted that the 

pore size and level of porosity, as well as the interconnectivity of the scaffolds produced with 

formulations including chitosan have consistently larger values. These differences in

and in vivo tissue response 

103 

morphology may be responsible for the lower level of reinforcement achieved with chitosan 

compounds in this study. The mechanical properties are within the levels required for its 

application, as scaffolds for bone regeneration, since its values are compatible with those of 

trabecular bone (31).  

 

3.2. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM 

 The morphology of the cells and the extent of cell adhesion were analyzed by SEM 

(Figure 3). 

 

Figure 3. SEM micrographs showing the morphology of the seeded and cultured hBMSCs 
after 1, 2 and 3 weeks in PBS 100 scaffolds (a, b and c); Ch-PBS 25-75 (d, e and f); and Ch-

PBS 50-50 (g, h and i), respectively. 

 Cells adhered in larger numbers to the chitosan containing scaffolds (Figures 3d and 

3g) when compared to the PBS formulation (Figure 3a). Practically no cell colonization is 

visible in PBS 100 scaffolds (Figures 3a, 3b and 3c) for all time points. The formulation Ch-

101the cultured scaffolds (Figures 3e and 3f). The stronger results in terms of cell adhesion 

were obtained for the formulation with the highest percentage of chitosan, showing that the 

presence of chitosan promoted cell adhesion and proliferation over time. Those results 

confirm our previous data (29) and clearly indicate a positive influence of chitosan over the 

adhesion and proliferation of hBMSCs seeded on the scaffolds. A study with chitosan-

coralline scaffolds with a similar porosity evidenced a similar cell behavior (32).

3.3. Cell viability 

 Cell viability results (Figure 4) corroborate the SEM observation, showing that higher 

chitosan content has a positive influence on the viability of hMSCs. The absolute values 

obtained for chitosan based scaffolds were indeed high (Figure 4). At all time points, Ch-PBS 

25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50 displayed significantly higher cell viability than PBS 100. After 7 

and 14 days of culture, Ch-PBS 50-50 scaffolds shown a significantly higher amount of cell 

viability than Ch-PBS 25-75. After 21 days of culture, no significant difference was obtained 

between Ch-PBS 25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50. For PBS 100 scaffolds, the values of viability 

were quite low for all time points and even decreased with time, which correlates with the 

SEM images showing almost no cells at the surface of the scaffolds. The Ch-PBS 25-75 

formulation evidenced increasing cell viability with time, even though the highest value 

obtained after 21 days of culture is still lower than the one obtained for the first time point (7 

days) of the Ch-PBS 50-50 formulation. Ch-PBS 50-50 evidenced the highest values of cell 

viability, although there is a slight decrease of cell viability corresponding to the longer time 

point. This may be explained by the surface of the scaffold being already fully covered by the 

cells at this longer time point.

followed by Tukey?s HSD test. (*) denotes significant differences compared to PBS 100.

3.4. Early osteogenic marker- ALP 

 ALP activity has been used as an indicator of osteogenic cell differentiation (33, 34). 
This membrane bound enzyme, which is expressed at relatively high levels in the 

osteoblasts, has long been recognized as a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, since it has 

been implicated in the mineralization process (35). ALP is upregulated in the early stages of 

biomineralization in order to form a large pool of inorganic phosphate, from which the ECM 

can be mineralized (36). An increasing ALP activity was observed over time for all scaffolds 

formulations. Similar trends were also observed for hMSCs cultured onto collagen-HA (37), 

silk (38) and chitosan (21, 23) 3D scaffolds. As expected from the SEM analysis and by data 

obtained from the viability tests, the seeded PBS 100 scaffolds presented the lowest values 

of ALP (Figure 5), corroborating the low cell adhesion detected in those scaffolds (Figures 

3a, 3b and 3c).

followed by Tukey?s HSD test. (*) denotes significant differences compared to PBS 100, (#) 

denotes significant differences compared to Ch-PBS 25-75. 

 

 Formulations containing chitosan showed similar trends of ALP activity, increasing 

with time, as well as a high level of activity. Furthermore, the formulation with the largest

and in vivo tissue response  

106 

chitosan content showed also the highest values of the expression of ALP for the longest 

time point. 

 

3.5. Osteogenic differentiation - gene expression 

 Bone cell differentiation is characterized by three different periods: proliferation, ECM 
maturation and mineralization (39). The osteogenic phenotype is recognized by cell 

maturation coordinated with the secretion of specific proteins, in a process that is 

asynchronously acquired and/or lost as the progenitor cells differentiate and the matrix 

matures and mineralizes (40). A preferred method to evaluate the transient state of the stem 

cells during differentiation is by analyzing gene expression profile during its culture in 

osteogenic differentiating conditions, as shown in Figure 6. 

 

 

Figure 6. Relative gene expression of osteogenic related genes (Runx2, Oste0rix, 

Osteocalcin, Osteopontin, Alkaline phosphatase and Bone Sialoprotein) in hBMSCs cultures 

onto Ch-PBS 50-50, Ch-PBS 25-75 scaffolds in osteogenic conditions. The expression of 

these genes was normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH and calculated by ?CT 

method. Data were analyzed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. 

 



CHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs 
and in vivo tissue response 

107 

 We performed a real time quantitative PCR study to evaluate the level of the relative 

expression of osteogenic related genes. Gene expression for the formulation PBS 100 was 

not analyzed, due to the fact that these scaffolds did not support cell adhesion in sufficient 

amounts to obtain the quantity of mRNA to synthesize the minimum cDNA. The genes 

analyzed included Runx-2, Osterix, Alkaline phosphatase, Osteopontin, Bone Sialoprotein 

and Osteocalcin. The relative quantification of each gene was normalized against the 

expression of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) for each time point. A constitutive expression 

of all mRNA transcripts was detected during the 21 days of the experiment. Runx-2 is 

expressed in an early multipotential mesenchymal cell population that can give rise to 

chondrogenic, osteogenic, and dentinogenic tissues as well as other lineages (41). Both 

chitosan scaffolds formulations presented a similar Runx-2 expression trend, with minor 

variation over time. Osterix is a transcription factor that is expressed in osteoblasts of all 

endochondral and membranous bones (42), acting during the stage of commitment of the 

osteoprogenitor cell into a pre-osteoblast (43). This gene was expressed in comparable 

levels for both Ch-PBS 25-75 and Ch-PBS 50-50 scaffolds. Osteocalcin gene is considered 

an important marker of the mineralization phase, reaching its maximum level before or during 

this process (39). In the present work this gene reached its maximum at 14 days of culture 

for both types of scaffolds. Osteopontin is one of the most abundant non-collagenous 

proteins in bone, binding to various extracellular molecules, including type I collagen, 

fibronectin or osteocalcin and contributes to the physical strength of the extracellular matrices 

(44). Osteopontin mRNA peak was at 14 days of hBMSCs culture, determining the end of the 

matrix deposition and the initiation of the mineralization stage. Higher values were obtained 

for Ch-PBS 50-50 formulation. Both osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNA maximum transcripts 

determine the presence of mature ostoblasts and the beginning of the mineralization. 

Alkaline phosphatase is localized in the plasma membrane of osteoblasts and although its 

precise function is not clearly understood, there are studies suggesting its involvement in 

mineralization process (33). It is an enzyme expressed by osteoblasts and it is considered a 

marker of osteogenic differentiation (45). Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be 

responsible for the cleavage of pyrophosphate, a molecule that binds to hydroxyapatite 

crystals preventing further incorporation of phosphate into the crystals (46). This mRNA 

transcript evidenced opposed trends for the different scaffolds formulations, i.e., for Ch-PBS 

25-75, ALP expression decreased with time, whereas for Ch-PBS 50-50 increased with time, 

also presenting higher absolute values for the latest culture periods. Bone sialoprotein is an 

adhesive bone ECM protein exclusively associated with mature osteoblasts and suggested to 

be also involved in the mineralization phase of bone formation (47). This mRNA transcript

and in vivo tissue response  

108 

showed a similar profile for both types of scaffolds, increasing from 7 to 14 days and with a 

slight decrease at 21 days. This decrease can be considered relative, given the standard 

deviation associated. This is in accordance of what was expected, since this protein is 

expressed by mature osteoblasts (43). The whole set of genes consistently upregulated, 

strongly evidences a successful osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs at the surface of 

chitosan containing scaffolds. 

  

3.6. Host tissue response to the implanted scaffolds 

  The implantation of a biomaterial scaffold in a tissue is performed to verify the local 

effects on host tissues. The biocompatibility of a device in a tissue is assessed in terms of 

acute and chronic inflammatory responses, granulation tissue development, foreign body 

host reaction and potential of integration of the implanted scaffold with host tissue (49). The 

evaluation of the local pathological effects was carried out at both tissue level (macroscopic) 

and at microscopic level. The histological evaluation is used to characterize various important 

biological response parameters (50).  

 The tissue biocompatibility was evaluated in vivo by implanting Ch-PBS 50-50 and 

PBS 100 scaffolds in relevant tissue locations, including hard tissue in the cranial defect 

(Figure 7) and soft tissues in auricular (Figure 8) and submuscular (Figure 9) regions. The 

Ch-PBS 25-75 condition was excluded based on the in vitro results, since this condition 

evidenced a similar performance to Ch-PBS 50-50 and to minimize the number of animals 

used. All surgical incisions healed without evidence of infection or other complications. 

Retrieved implants showed no signs of serious inflammation.  

 Tissue reaction to an implanted biomaterial is often characterized by an initial acute 

inflammatory response, with the presence of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs or neutrophils) 

that migrate from blood to the tissue (51). Acute inflammation is the immediate response to 

injury and most of the times destroy the foreign material. However, the implant may act as a 

persistent stimulus to inflammation, and the host response will evolve into a chronic 

inflammation response. The chronic inflammation is associated to angiogenesis, fibrosis or 

eventually, tissue necrosis (52). The leukocyte infiltration is composed by lymphocytes, 

macrophages and plasma cells, that in combination with angiogenesis and fibroplasia 

constitutes the granulation tissue (53). This chronic reaction has also another particularity, 

the possibility of recruiting giant cells (G), formed by macrophage fusion, mostly associated 



CHAPTER IV. Influence of chitosan content in the scaffold composition over the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs 
and in vivo tissue response 

109 

to the failure of phagocytosis of large particles released from the device (54). This reaction is 

denominated by foreign body reaction (FBR).  

 After one month of implantation, an invasion of host cells throughout the implanted 

porous structures was visible for all tissue locations (Figures 7, 8 and 9). The implanted 

scaffolds caused mild inflammation, characterized by infiltration of mononuclear phagocytic 

cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and some polymorphonuclear leukocytes in 

hard and soft tissues at the implantation site. For each implantation location:  

 

i) Cranial defect  

 Both types of scaffolds were placed in close contact with the cortical bone of the 

calvaria. It is visible a significant ingrowth of connective tissue cells into the scaffolds porous 

structure (Figures 7a and 7d). Furthermore, new blood vessels were present (Figures 7b and 

7e) and collagen is present in both type of scaffold (Figures 7c and 7f) formulations but in a 

higher amount for chitosan based scaffolds (Figures 7c). Foreign body giant cells were 

observed, being more pronounced for chitosan based scaffolds (Figure 7b) and it was 

already reported that chitosan may induce the formation of granulation tissue in vivo (55).

ii) Auricular implantation 
 In this region scaffolds show, as in the cranial defect, a mild inflammatory response 

(Figure 8). This lower tissue response may be in part related to the fact that ear tissue is not 

intensely vascularized. PBS scaffolds evidenced lower cell colonization (Figures 8d and 8e), 

than Ch-PBS scaffolds. At high magnifications it was possible to observe cell necrosis inside 

the pores of PBS implants (Figure 8e). On the other hand, it was visible a massive 

colonization of inflammatory giant cells in chitosan implants (Figure 8b). Previous results

using chitosan and ovine MSCs with TGF?-3 implanted into partial thickness lesions created 

in sheep legs, evidenced a hyaline-like cartilaginous matrix, well integrated into the host 

cartilage what provides further confidence for the potential of the present chitosan-based 

material also for cartilage regeneration (56).

112 

inflammatory cells, namely neutrophils (Figure 9). This result may be due to the fact that this 

particular region has higher tissue vascularization, as well as higher tissue stresses caused 

by locomotion. Ch-PBS scaffolds evidenced robust infiltration by the host cells (Figures 9a 

and 9b), compared to PBS scaffolds that showed also in this implantation site some cell 

necrosis inside the implant (Figures 9d and 9f). Residual neutrophils were present in Ch-PBS 

scaffold implants (Figure 9b) caused by the presence of chitosan that is known to be 

attractive to neutrophils upon implantation (12, 57). It was also visible more collagen in 

chitosan based scaffolds (Figure 9c) in comparison with the PBS ones, where only residual 

collagen is observed (Figure 9f).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 Different chitosan and poly(butylene succinate) formulations were used to produce 
scaffolds by compression molding followed by salt leaching. The aim was to study the 

influence of chitosan over the viability, adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and 

in vivo tissue biocompatibility. Chitosan based scaffolds evidenced superior results in terms 

of in vitro cell performance, with PBS 100 scaffolds showing consistently inferior results. 

 Overall, a higher content of chitosan induce a stronger cellular performance in terms 

of cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, when using the produced scaffolds for the 

strategy presented in this work. 

 For all types of scaffolds tested in vivo, the tissue response was lower in calvaria and 

in auricular implantations when compared to the submuscular region. Chitosan based 

scaffolds evidenced more cell penetration, without any signs of cell necrosis. Furthermore, 

many blood vessels were observed in the immediacy of the scaffolds. A chronic inflammatory 

response without fibrosis was developed. Therefore, it is concluded that chitosan exerts a 

strongly positive effect over the cell performance in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, the 

developed chitosan based scaffolds are strong candidates to be used in the bone tissue 

engineering field.

CHAPTER V 
Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Seeded 

on Melt based Chitosan scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications 

 

ABSTRACT 

 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth patterns and osteogenic 
differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) when seeded onto 

new biodegradable chitosan/polyester scaffolds. 

 Scaffolds were obtained by melt blending chitosan with poly(butylene succinate) in a 

proportion of 50% (wt) each, and further used to produce a fiber mesh scaffold. hBMSCs 

were seeded on those structures and cultured for 3 weeks under osteogenic conditions. Cells 

were able to reduce MTS and demonstrated increasing metabolic rates over time. SEM 

observations showed cell colonization at the surface as well as within the scaffolds. The 

presence of mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) was successfully demonstrated by peaks 

corresponding to calcium and phosphorous elements detected in the EDS analysis. A further 

confirmation was obtained when carbonate and phosphate group peaks were identified in 

Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra. Moreover, by Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR 

analysis it was observed the expression of osteogenic gene markers, namely Runt related 

transcription factor 2 (Runx2), type 1 collagen, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin. 

 Chitosan-PBS (Ch-PBS) biodegradable scaffolds support the proliferation and 

osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs cultured at their surface in vitro, enabling future in vivo 

testing for the development of bone tissue engineering therapies.  

 

1.INTRODUCTION 

Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow stroma have the 

capacity to differentiate into cells of connective tissues, namely into osteoblasts, 

chondrocytes and adipocytes (1-4). However, recent studies (5), indicate that they may have 

a much broader differentiation potential. Accordingly, the multipotential capacity of MSCs, 

their accessible origin, high ex vivo expansive potential, and ethical acceptance, make these 

cells attractive tools for tissue engineering and cell-based therapies.

Annually, more than 2.2 million bone grafting procedures (autologous bone graft and 

banked bone) are performed worldwide to ensure adequate bone healing in many skeletal 

problems, such as nonunion fractures, cervical and lumbar spine fusion, joint arthrodesis, 

revision arthroplasty (6). Unfortunately, the gold standard of bone grafting (autologous bone) 

requires an extra surgery to retrieve it from the patient. This leads to an increase in surgical 

and recovery times. Potential complications, such as chronic pain at the donor site, 

infections, and eventual disability (7) can occur. Tissue engineering offers a strategy to 

circumvent those problems. The concept involves the use of a porous and biodegradable 

scaffold, allowing cells to adhere and proliferate, creating conditions for the formation of 

ECM-like structures (8-10). Previous studies have shown that natural based polymers such 

as starch (11-18) or chitosan (19-28) have great potential for bone tissue engineering 

applications. The main advantages of these materials include low immunogenic potential, 

bioactive behavior, good interaction with host tissues, chemical versatility and high 

availability in nature (7).  

Chitosan has already shown a range of properties, including its non-antigenicity (24) 

and cytocompatibility (21, 29), that suggest having adequate properties for  bone tissue 

engineering applications. However the material offers limited versatility in its processability. 

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel methodology to process chitosan by 

compounding this material with biodegradable aliphatic polyesters (26). The blend combines 

the favorable biological properties of chitosan with the good mechanical properties and 

processability of polyesters (26, 28, 30-33), leading to a chitosan based material with 

adjustable properties for tissue engineering applications (30-32).  

The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the performance of the developed 

microfiber mesh scaffolds. For that, we assess the cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of human MSCs isolated from bone marrow and seeded onto novel 

chitosan/polyester micro fiber mesh scaffolds aimed to be used in bone tissue engineering 

field. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1.  Scaffold processing  

New chitosan based scaffolds were, developed by a fiber bonding technique. The 

processing methodology is entirely melt based, thus avoiding the limitations of solvent-based

processing, and it is described in detail elsewhere (26). Briefly, chitosan was melt blended 

with polybutylene succinate (PBS) (50/50 wt%) in a twin-screw extruder. The extrudate was 

grinded into powder and further processed into microfibers, using a microextruder. The 

diameter of the fibers was controlled by the diameter of the die. After that, Ch-PBS fibers 

were cut and submitted to hot compression. This last step (15) consisted in applying 

temperature and pressure to obtain a fiber mesh scaffold with inherent porosity and 

interconnectivity. The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide and used for cell culture 

studies.  

 

2.2. Scaffolds characterization 

Chitosan-based fiber mesh scaffolds were analysed using a high-resolution micro-

computed tomography Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Five scaffolds 

were scanned in high resolution mode using a pixel size of 8.24 ?m and integration time of 

2.0 ms. The X-ray source was set at 80 keV of energy and 124 ?A of current. For all the 

scanned specimens representative data sets of 150 slices were transformed into binary 

using a dynamic threshold of 60-255 (grey values) to distinguish polymer material from pore 

voids. This data was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). The 

morphometric analysis included porosity, scaffolds interconnectivity and mean pore size 

quantification. Three dimensional (3D) virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of 

the scaffolds were also created, visualized and registered using the image processing 

software (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan).  

The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were tested on compression tests carried 

out in a universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505, Universal Machine). A crosshead 

speed of 5 mm/min was used and the compression modulus was determined from the most 

linear region of the stress-strain curve and averaged from the results obtained with five 

specimens.  

 

2.3. Cell culture studies 

2.3.1. In vitro cytotoxicity tests 

 A rat lung fibroblast cell line (L929), acquired from the european collection of cell 

cultures (ECACC), was used for the initial standard cytotoxicity assays. Tests were carried

out following the international standard ISO 10993. The procedure and methods are 

described elsewhere (27).  

 

2.3.2. hBMSCs seeding and culture onto the scaffolds 

Primary cultures of hBMSCs were used. The cells were characterized by flow 

cytometry for MSCs markers (CD31, CD34, CD45-negative and CD13, CD29, CD73, CD90, 

CD105, CD166-positive cells) and differentiation studies into osteogenic, chondrogenic and 

adipogenic lineage (34). The cells were grown in a culture medium consisting of alpha 

medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Germany), 5 mM L-

glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFgF) (PeproTech, 

USA) and 1% of antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).  When an adequate 

cell number was obtained, cells at passage 2 were detached with trypsin/EDTA. Cells were 

seeded at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold under static conditions, by means of a cell 

suspension. After 24 hours of attachment, constructs were placed in new 24-well plates and 

1 ml of osteogenic medium was added to each well. The osteogenic culture medium 

consisted of DMEM without phenol red, dexamethasone 10-8 M (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 

ascorbic acid 50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ß-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. 

Louis, MO). The constructs were cultured for periods of up to 7, 14 and 21 days in a 

humidified atmosphere at 37ºC, containing 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every 

2 to 3 days until the end of the experiment. 

 

2.3.3. Cellular viability assay - MTS test 

Cell viability was assessed after 3 hours, 7, 14 and 21 days, using the MTS test. The 

constructs (n=3) were rinsed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 

and immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent in 

a 5:1 ratio and incubated for 3 hours at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 

After this, 200 µl (n=3) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) was 

measured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm.

scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications 

125 

2.3.4. Cell adhesion and cell viability stained with calcein-AM using confocal laser 

microscopy  

Cells were incubated with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). Inside the 

cells, calcein-AM is hydrolyzed by endogenous esterases into the highly negatively charged 

green fluorescent calcein, which is retained inside the cytoplasm. The constructs were 

sectioned and cell adhesion, proliferation and viability were observed in the inner regions of 

the scaffolds using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. 

 

2.3.5. Cell adhesion and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

Cell adhesion, morphology, and spatial distribution were observed by SEM. The 

constructs were washed in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde. After that, the constructs were dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol 

(30, 50, 70, 90, 100%) for 15 minutes, twice. Then, the samples were immersed in 

hexamethyldisilazane (35) (HDMS; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, USA), and 

let to air dry for 2 h. Afterwards, the constructs were sputter coated with gold (JEOL JFC-

1100) and analyzed using a Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscope. 

 

2.3.6. Cell proliferation by DNA quantification 

hBMSCs proliferation on the Ch-PBS scaffolds was determined using a fluorimetric 

dsDNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA). Samples collected 

at days 7, 14 and 21, were washed twice with a sterile phosphate buffered saline solution 

and transferred into 1.5 ml microtubes containing 1ml of ultra-pure water. Constructs were 

cryopreserved at -80ºC for further analysis. Prior to DNA quantification, samples were 

thawed and sonicated for 15 min. Standards were prepared with concentrations ranging 

between 0 and 2 mg/ml. Per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 µl of 

sample (n=3) or standard, 71.3 µl of PicoGreen solution, and 100 µl of Tris–EDTA buffer. The 

plate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and fluorescence was measured using an 

excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm.

2.3.7. Alkaline phosphatase quantification 

 Samples were collected as previously described. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity 

of the scaffolds/cells constructs (n=3) was measured by the specific conversion of p-

nitrophenyl phosphate (pNpp) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The 

constructs were thawed at room temperature and sonicated for 15 min. The enzymatic 

reaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml of substrate buffer containing 

1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNpp. The solution was further incubated at 

37ºC for 1 hour and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a solution containing 2 M 

NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA in distilled water. The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard 

curve was made using pNp values ranging from 0 to 20 ?mol/ml. The results were 

normalized by DNA values and expressed in ?mol of pNp produced/?g ds DNA. A detailed 

description of the assay can be found elsewhere (36). 

 

2.3.8. Mineralization content by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) 

 The constructs were processed as described previously for SEM. The samples (n=3) 

were sputter coated with carbon (JEOL JFC-1100) with the purpose of analyzing the 

presence of Ca and P elements at the surface by EDS with a Leica Cambridge S360 

scanning electron microscope. Sputter coating with carbon avoids overlapping of signals of 

the coating with the elements being analyzed. 

 

2.3.9. Mineralization crystallinity by fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) 

 The constructs were washed in phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde. The samples were pressed into pellets with potassium bromide (KBr; Riedel-

de Haen, Germany). The IR spectrum was measured using a FTIR Spectrometer (model 

IRPrestige-21, Shimadzu; Germany) in the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm?1. 

 

2.3.10. Osteogenic differentiation by reverse transcriptase PCR 

 Total RNA was isolated from cells with Trizol (Sigma, St Louis, USA), according to the 

manufacturer protocol. A NanoDrop Microspectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000

Spectrophotometer, Alfagene, USA) was used to measure the total RNA amounts (ng/µl). 

Aliquots of the total RNA (100 ng/?l) were transcripted into cDNA and amplified in each PCR 

in one step RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) and gene specific primers were added. 

Each cDNA sample was run in triplicate for every PCR. Amplification was performed using a 

Mastercycler gradient (MyCycler™, Thermal Cycler, Biorad). The first reverse transcription 

step at 42ºC for 30 min was followed by a step of denaturation at 95ºC during 5 min. After 

this, 35 cycles of PCR were performed, each consisting of a denaturation stage at 95ºC for 1 

min, annealing at a given temperature accordingly with the specific primer used, and then an 

extension stage at 72ºC for 2 min. In all cases, a final extension at 72ºC for 5 min was 

performed before storing the samples at 4ºC. Specific primers used were: for human Runx2, 

osteocalcin, type 1 collagen, BSP and for the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-

phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).  PCR products were separated by 1% agarose (Biorad, 

USA) at least twice. The separated DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide 

(Sigma, St Louis, MO) staining and observed with an Eagleye software (Alpha Innotech, 

USA) using excitation at 514 nm and emission at 610 nm.  

 

2.3.11. Statistical analysis 

 Results of MTS and ALP are expressed as mean ± standard deviation with n=3 for 

each group. Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student?s t-test 

multiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

3. RESULTS  

3.1. Scaffolds characterization 

Porous chitosan based fiber mesh scaffolds used in this study were produced with a 

blend of 50% chitosan and 50% of poly(butylene succinate). The scaffolds were prepared 

using melt extrusion, followed by hot compression (fiber bonding).  Scaffolds were cut into 

cylinders of approximately 6.5 mm diameter and thickness of 1.5 mm. Figure 1 shows the top 

surface of the novel chitosan based fiber mesh scaffold produced by the described melt 

based process. Scaffolds show a large porosity and inherent interconnectivity, as well as an 

irregular distribution of the fiber orientation as intended.

Figure 1. Three-dimensional (3D) images obtained by µ-CT reconstruction model (a) and 

SEM photomicrograph of Ch-PBS (50% wt) fiber mesh scaffold (b).  

 

The µCT technology allows obtaining series of X-ray slice images covering a 

representative volume region of the porous scaffold. The solid volume representation and the 

quantitative data is obtained following image processing using specific software and the X-

rays micrographs obtained in each slice. This technique was used to obtain 3D images of the 

novel chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds (Figure 1a) and to quantitatively determine the average 

porosity (44.8% ± 2.1) and the interconnectivity of 89.6% ± 1.9. Compression mechanical 

tests have shown that scaffolds have a compression modulus of 32.6 ± 12.8 MPa, which is 

within the range of interest for bone applications (37).  

The fibers used to produce these scaffolds have an average diameter of 450 µm and 

as can be seen in Figure 1b, evidence an interesting surface roughness that may contribute 

to enhance the cell adhesion by increasing the surface area. Moreover, detailed observations 

using µCT equipment show that microfibers in addition to the surface roughness also 

possess some microporosity at the surface that further enhances the surface area (Figure 

1a).  

 

3.2. In vitro cytotoxicity tests 

 In the MTS test (data not shown), L929 fibroblasts metabolized MTS into brown 

formazan product after incubation with the scaffold?s extract. This fact evidences that the 

cells have metabolic activities (around 80%) similar to those obtained by cells grown in 

DMEM (negative control). Moreover, they were able to incorporate and metabolize MTS,

showing very high viability. Therefore, the leachables released from the tested scaffolds can 

be considered as non-cytotoxic. 

 

3.3. Cell viability by MTS and Calcein-AM staining 

Results showed that the tested hBMSCs were also able to reduce MTS (Figure 2), 

demonstrate high metabolic rates as a function of time, and denote a high viability and 

proliferation profile. Moreover, a cell viability assay with calcein-AM staining (Figure 3) 

demonstrated that hBMSCs were metabolically active and well distributed throughout the 

scaffold surfaces after 3 weeks.

3.4. Cell adhesion and morphology by SEM 

After 1 week, hBMSCs cultured under osteogenic conditions, were able to adhere to 

the fibrous surface and inner pores of the scaffolds and to proliferate during the subsequent 

periods in culture (Figures 4A, 4D and 4G). The production of ECM can be analyzed in more 

depth at higher magnifications (Figures 4C, 4F and 4I). Furthermore, it is observed that the 

cells were able to create “bridges” between neighboring fibers, but without occluding the 

pores (Figures 4B and 4E). Cells were also capable of colonizing the inner regions of the 

scaffolds, keeping the viability on those inner pores (Figures 4J, 4K and 4L).

L correspond to cross sections of the cell seeded scaffolds after 3 weeks, showing the bulk 

colonization by the cells. 

 

3.5. Alkaline phosphatase quantification 

The expression of ALP is typically used as an early marker of the osteogenic 

phenotype. The ALP expression shows the typical pattern of expression (Figure 5), 

increasing until the second week, where it reached its maximum. This observation reflects 

the early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. After this period, ALP activity 

decreased, probably due to the onset of the mineralization process (36). This observation is a 



CHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan 

scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications 
 

132 

positive indication of the transient character of the differentiation of cells into the osteogenic 

lineage.

1, 2 and 3 weeks, under osteogenic induction. The results are normalized by µg of dsDNA, 

and presented in amount of p-nitrophenol (µmol/ml/h/µg dsDNA). Results are expressed as 

average ± standard deviation with n=3 for each bar, (*) indicates a significant difference 

(p&lt;0.05) between conditions as a function of time.   

 

3.6. Mineralization content of ECM by EDS and FTIR analysis 

EDS analysis of the surface of constructs detected the presence of Ca and P 

elements (Figure 6 A). Acellular scaffolds (control) do not show any presence of those two 

elements during the same period of immersion in osteogenic inducing culture medium. These 

results clearly indicate the formation of mineralized ECM at the surface of cell seeded 

scaffolds. These results were further confirmed by FTIR analysis (Figure 6C), showing the 

presence of phosphate and carbonate groups, which are typical for carbonated apatite (38).

3.7. Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs upon chitosan based scaffolds 

To further analyze the differentiation towards the osteogenic phenotype, the RNA of 

the cell cultured in the scaffolds is analysed by reverse transcriptase PCR (Figure7).  

 

 

Figure 7. PCR analysis of the genes that encode for the transcription factor Runx2, the  bone 
ECM protein osteocalcin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and the house keeping 

gene GAPDH on hBMSCs grown under osteogenic conditions on Ch-PBS fiber mesh 

scaffolds for 21 days. 

PCR analysis show the expression of specific genes related to the osteogenic 

lineage, namely the transcription factor Runx2, considered to be a crucial transcription gene 

within the osteogenic phenotype (39, 40). Its expression was detected at all time points, 

being more pronounced at the third week of culture. The gene expression patterns of the 

various extracellular proteins, including osteocalcin, type 1 collagen and BSP, was detected 

at all time points and in increased levels at the latest time point. This indicates a successful 

differentiation into the osteogenic phenotype. 

 

4. DISCUSSION 

The demand for new therapies for diseases affecting musculoskeletal tissues is 

continuously increasing, especially considering the high number of patients suffering from 

skeletal degenerative diseases. Bone tissue engineering has been proposing solutions to 



CHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan 

scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications 
 

134 

address those clinical problems. The strategy could combine cells with a 3D scaffold and 

growth factors, seeking to achieve the regeneration of bone tissue. 

Natural-based polymers such as chitosan, a polymer produced by partial 

deacetylation of chitin, have been proposed as having potential for tissue engineering 

applications. Chitosan is characterized by its good biocompatibility, low immunogeneicity, 

non-cytotoxicity and wound healing capability. These properties make chitosan a strong 

candidate material for bone tissue engineering applications. Due to its limited mechanical 

properties and process ability, scaffolds produced only with chitosan are more difficult to 

optimize for hard tissue applications. An alternative methodology to overcome those 

limitations consists in blending chitosan with synthetic and biodegradable aliphatic polyesters 

(26, 33). Thermoplastic biodegradable polymers have already shown great potential in the 

clinic as implantable biomaterials due to their reported non-cytotoxicity and biodegradability. 

Their degradation products are also non-cytotoxic, although they lack the cell recognition 

affinity typically provided by natural polymers. Thus by blending chitosan with synthetic 

polyesters it is possible to obtain a good balance between biological affinity (30-32) and 

processability, not compromising the biodegradability. 

The developed fibrous scaffolds showed a significant interconnectivity (Figure 1), 

which is known to be a critical condition for successful cell colonization and viability. Extracts 

from the developed scaffolds are non-cytotoxic in contact with L929 cells (data not presented 

herein).  

Human MSCs showed high metabolic levels when adhered onto the scaffolds both by 

the reduction of the MTS substrate (Figure 2) and also by the calcein-am staining (Figure 3).  

SEM micrographs (Figure 4) show that hBMSCs adhered at the surface of the 

scaffolds and were able to “bridge” between fibers without occluding the pores (Figure 4C). 

The proliferation of hBMSCs and the production of ECM showed increased levels over time 

(Figures 4A, 4D and 4G). SEM observations and cell viability results can help to establish a 

time dependent cell proliferation patterns as showing the presence of higher number of cells 

at late time periods. It was also observed that cells proliferated and colonized the inner 

regions (Figures 4J, 4K and 4L) of the scaffolds, which demonstrate that porosity and 

interconnectivity exhibited by the scaffolds are adequate for cell infiltration and ingrowth. 

ALP activity measurements (Figure 5) showed a maximum at the second week of 

culture, reflecting the early osteogenic differentiation stage of hMSCs (36). After this period, 



CHAPTER V. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells seeded on melt based chitosan 
scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications 

135 

ALP activity decreased due to the onset of the mineralization process, which is a typical 

positive indication.  

hBMSCs were able to produce mineralized ECM confirmed by the presence of Ca 

and P elements (Figure 6a). Furthermore, the existence of characteristic peaks of carbonate 

and phosphate groups in FTIR spectra (Figure 6C) indicates the presence of carbonated 

apatite at the surface of constructs. 

The differentiation of the hBMSCs towards the osteogenic lineage was ultimately 

demonstrated by the expression of genes that are usually associated with the mineralization 

during osteogenesis, such as the transcription factor Runx2, and the matrix proteins 

osteocalcin, type 1 collagen and BSP (Figure 7). Runx2 is essential for the differentiation of 

MSCs into mature osteoblasts in the skeletal development of numerous mammalian 

organisms (39, 40). Osteocalcin, one of the few osteogenic specific genes, is a bone matrix 

protein and it is known to play an important role in the differentiation of osteoblast progenitor 

cells, with significant up-regulation observed both in matrix synthesis and in the 

mineralization process (39). BSP is secreted, bind cell surface integrin receptors, and 

regulate mineralization and type I collagen represents the majority of the organic part of bone 

matrix (41).

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 Chitosan–poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds were successfully produced 

by a melt based routine, avoiding the use of solvents. The scaffolds presented a high degree 

of interconnectivity (89,6% ± 1.9) and adequate mechanical properties (32.6 ± 12.8 MPa) for 

bone tissue engineering applications. 

 It was demonstrated that chitosan-PBS scaffolds are cytocompatible, both with L929 

cells and hBMSCs. The scaffolds support hBMSCs adhesion and proliferation under 

osteogenic inducing conditions. The cells presented high levels of viability, demonstrating 

that besides the remarkable colonization of the scaffold structure, the cells were 

metabolically active.  

 ALP expression a mineralized ECM is detected by the presence of Ca and P 

elements in EDS spectra, and also confirmed by FTIR. The expression of osteogenic related 

genes (Runx2, osteocalcin, type 1 collagen and bone sialoprotein) show successful 

differentiation of the cells in the scaffolds towards an osteogenic phenotype. 

 Due to the extremely well balanced combination of properties and excellent biological 

performance, it is strongly believed that the scaffolds herein proposed in combination with 

human adult mesenchymal stem cells will provide new therapies for the development of 

tissue engineering solutions for bone regeneration.

CHAPTER VI 

In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-
poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds 

 

ABSTRACT 

 In a tissue engineering approach it is important to determine the kinetics of the 

biodegradation of biomaterials in vitro, as well as in vivo. Furthermore, the evaluation of a 

host response to the implantation of the biomaterials must be performed to understand the 

extent of the inflammatory reaction. 

 Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds, in previous studies evidenced 

enhanced biological performance, not only in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation, but 

also as supporting the osteogenic differentiation of mouse and human MSCs. The following 

step consisted on the study of the degradation process in vitro using relevant enzymes, 

lipase and lysozyme, responsible for the degradation of the poly(butylene succinate) and 

chitosan, respectively. Moreover, subcutaneous implantation of the scaffolds was performed 

to assess the tissue response. Histology and immunoshistochemistry were used to visualize 

the type of inflammatory cells present in the surrounding tissue, as well as within the 

scaffold.. 

 In the presence of lipase, or with lysozyme, water uptake of the scaffolds increased. 

This phenomenon is probably due to the degradation of scaffolds by the enzymes. Weight 

loss results and scanning electron micsoscopy (SEM) analysis evidenced that lysozyme 

combined with lipase have a notable effect on the degradation of the scaffolds in vitro. 

 In vivo implantation showed a normal inflammatory response with the typical 

presence of neutrophils in a first stage and macrophages, lymphocytes and giant cells in a 

later stage. Vascularization was observed, increasing with time, by the presence of blood 

vessels in the surrounding tissue and within the implant. Moreover, collagen deposition, 

vizualized by Masson trichrome stain, increased over time inside of the implant. During the 

entire in vivo experiment the scaffolds maintained the structural integrity, although after 12 

weeks it was possible to observe cell colonization inside the fibrous structure. In vitro results 

showed a faster and greater degradation compared to those observed in vivo.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 Many biodegradable polymers have been proposed to produce scaffolds in Tissue 
Engineering field. These structures sustain the extracellular matrix (ECM) production by cells 

and at the same time, it is expected to degrade gradually to allow the surrounding tissue to 

replace the supporting function of the scaffold (1).  

 Biodegradable polymers are able to act as a a temporary substrate that will degrade 

over time, in a controlled way into products, which will be eliminated by regular metabolic 

pathways in the body (biodegradation) (2). Furthermore, the biological performance of some 

biomaterials depends on their degradation behavior, since this process influences cell 

performance and inflammatory response. Therefore, it is crucial to study the degradation 

properties of the scaffold for a long term success of the tissue engineered construct (3). 

 In the last years, natural biodegradable polymers have been used to produce 

scaffolds for tissue engineering. Due to their resemblance with the ECM, natural polymers 

may avoid the stimulation of chronic inflammation or toxicity, generally found out for synthetic 

polymers (4). Chitosan, the partially deacetylated product of chitin, has emerged as one of 

the favorites, mainly because of the similarity to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), native 

components of ECM (5). Additionally, the cationic nature of chitosan allows electrostatic 

interactions with anionic GAGs and proteoglycans (6). 

 In our group, we have been working with chitosan based scaffolds (7-15). One of the 

most promising biomaterials is the chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) processed into 

scaffolds by melt based technology (16-18). These scaffolds combine the biological 

properties of chitosan and the mechanical properties of aliphatic polyesters (17, 18). In vitro 

studies performed with different cell types showed a remarkable cell colonization of these 

scaffolds (10, 13, 14, 19). Chitosan has been proposed as a biomaterial for biomedical 

applications mainly due to its biocompatibility (20). Furthermore, it has been described as a 

potent wound healing accelerator (21-26), as well as to modulate the immune system by 

activating macrophages (27) to produce cytokines (28) and to inhibit infection (29).  

 Poly(butylene succinate) is a biodegradable synthetic polymer with good 

processability when compared to poly(lactic acid) or poly(glycolic acid) (30). Moreover, it 

shows good mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering, comparable to those of poly-

caprolactone (31). The degradation profile of poly(butylene succinate) in the environment has 

been widely studied (32-34). Succinic acid is the main degradation product, which is an

intermediate of the tricarboxilic acid cycle, that ultimately degrades into carbon dioxide and 

water (32, 34).  

 Some biomaterials are degraded by hydrolysis, a non-enzymatic degradation, whose 

materials are mainly decomposed by contact with water or serum, being this process non 

specifically regulated (35). Biodegradation of polymeric biomaterials requires cleavage of 

hydrolytically and/or enzymatically sensitive bonds in the polymer, leading to polymer erosion 

(36). Degradation products should be non-toxic and free of immunogenicity. The resulting 

products should be small enough to dissolve in the body fluids and, after transportation via 

lymphatic system, the kidneys should be able to excrete them from the body (37). The 

degradation behavior of polymers can be tested previously in vitro, in order to predict their 

behavior when implanted in vivo. Usually, biomaterials are incubated in phosphate buffered 

solution, with or without enzymes, at 37ºC, under static and/or dynamic conditions to better 

simulate the in vivo conditions. It is common that degradation studies are performed in 

parallel with biocompatibility tests, both in vitro and in vivo. This close relation is due to the 

fact that the degradation of a biomaterial implanted in a host is influenced by the presence 

and recruitment of inflammatory cells and, consequently, by the production of inflammatory 

mediators.  

 In vivo, chitosan was shown to be degraded mainly by lysozyme (38-40). The 

degradation kinetics of chitosan is inversely related to the degree of deacetylation (39, 41), 

since this enzyme targets the acetylated residues of chitosan polymer (38, 40). Human 

lysozyme is found in several body fluids, including serum (42, 43), tears (42, 43), saliva (42, 

43) and other fluids, like those surrounding cartilage (44). It is also important to highlight the 

fact that during inflammation process, neutrophils and macrophages cells will release 

enzymes, namely lysozyme and reactive oxygen species (45). On the other hand, PBS is an 

aliphatic polyester and these polymers are known to be degraded by lipases (46). This 

enzyme is water soluble, hydrolyzing ester bonds of triglycerides, phospholipids and 

cholesteryl esters (47, 48). Human lipases include pre-duodenal lingual, gastric, extra-

duodenal pancreatic, hepatic, lipoprotein and endothelial lipases (49). Serum lipase is mainly 

derived from pancreatic cells, but tissues such as digestive track, adipose tissue, lungs and 

leucocytes also contain lipase (50, 51). 

 One of the most important requisites for clinical application of a biomaterial is its 

biocompatibility, that is defined as the ability of a material to perform, with an appropriate 

host response, in a specific application (52). The implantation of a biomaterial device sets off

 146 

a cascade of events that starts with an acute inflammatory response that may lead to a 

chronic inflammatory response. Polymorphonucleated cells (PMNs), macrophages and new 

blood vessels are present and granulation tissue can be developed, with subsequent foreign 

body reaction and fibrous capsule development (53). The inflammation process serves to 

contain, neutralize or dilute the injurious agent or process. Thus, the intensity and the 

duration of the inflammatory reaction may characterize the biocompatibility of a biomaterial 

(54). In the case of biodegradable polymers, the intensity of these responses may be 

modulated by the biodegradation process that can cause changes in shape, size, surface 

roughness, porosity and release of degradation products (54). Generally, the local reaction of 

an implant is studied after a 3 months implantation period, as described in the ISO standard 

10993-6 (55). This time frame usually reflects a steady state, where the local 

acceptance/rejection can be evaluated.  

 In this work we studied the biodegradation process, as well as the biocompatibility of 

chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds. The tests in vitro involved enzymes 

responsible for the degradation of chitosan and PBS, lysozyme and/or lipase, respectively. 

The in vitro degradation studies were carried out using the enzymes in concentrations similar 

to those present in the human blood serum. In vivo studies were performed with the main 

aims of studying the biodegradation and the biocompatibility of these scaffolds, using a 

subcutaneous model in Wistar rats during 3 months of implantation. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Scaffolds production 

 The processing methodology is described in previous works from our group (19). 

Briefly, chitosan was melt blended with polybutylene succinate by extrusion (50% wt). The 

resulting extrudate was grinded into powder and processed into microfibers also by 

extrusion. The fibers were cut and submitted to hot compression. In this study the scaffolds 

dimensions were 6.5 mm diameter and 1 mm. The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide 

to be further used in subsequent tests.

2.2. In vitro degradation studies 

 Degradation studies were performed in triplicate by incubating the scaffolds in 

phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) (control), with lipase from aspergillus oryzal 

(Fluka) (110 U/L) and/or lysozyme chicken egg white (Sigma) (13 mg/L). The concentrations 

used were similar those found in human blood serum, at 37ºC in dynamic conditions (60 rpm) 

for 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. At the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed 

and immediately weighed to determine the water uptake and dried for later calculation of the 

weight loss.  

 

2.2.1. Water uptake and weight loss measurements 

 All samples were weighed before incubation in phosphate buffered saline or 
enzymatic solutions (initial weight). After 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, three samples of each 

condition were removed and immediately weighed for determination of water uptake 

(Equation 1), washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried for later calculation of weight 

loss (Equation 2),  

 

Water uptake (%) = [(ww – wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) 

 

Weight loss (%) = [wi – wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) 

 

where wi is the initial weight,  ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. 

 

2.2.2. Analysis of sample morphology by scanning electron microscopy 

 The samples morphology, before and after degradation with the different solutions 

was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (NanoSEM, FEI company, USA). 

 

2.3. In vivo degradation studies 

 One day before subcutaneous implantation surgery the implants were immersed in 

phosphate buffered saline solution under sterile conditions. Twelve adult male Wistar Han 

rats (41-44 days old at the beginning of the experiment), Specified Pathogen Free, were

purchased from Charles River Laboratories, France. The animals were kept one week in a 

quarantine room and transferred to a conventional maintenance room of the experimental 

unit of the animal facility, where they were housed for the all period of the experiment. 

 For the present study, 12 animals were used for subcutaneous implantation of 

acellular scaffolds. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks, samples were retrieved for further analysis. 

Animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution of 75//0.5 mg/kg body 

weight ketamine/metedomidine (Imalgene®/Dorbenvet®). After confirming depth of 

anesthesia by pedal reflex, the dorsum of the animals was shaved and they were placed in 

ventral position. The incision site at the dorsal skin was disinfected with clorohexidine and 2 

medial longitudinal incisions were performed. Subcutaneous pockets were created and 4 

scaffolds were placed in each animal, away from the suture site (incision) to avoid 

inflammation of the wound. The incisions were closed with a 4.0 silk suture (Look, Harvard, 

USA), which was removed 10 days after surgery in the animals with longer implantation 

periods. The anesthesia was then reverted with a subcutaneous injection of 0.25 mg/kg 

Atipamezol (Antisedan®). Once animals become active, they were placed in their home 

cages and water and food were supplied ad libitum. Each animal received a subcutaneous 

injection of 1mg/kg analgesic Butorphanol (Torbugesic®) administered immediately after 

surgery and 24h later, to avoid post-operative pain. At each time point, animals were 

euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium penthobarbital, at a lethal dose, and the 

respective implants retrieved.  

All procedures were conducted in accordance with European regulations for animal 

laboratory testing (European Union Directive 86/609/EEC).  

 

2.4. Histological evaluation 

2.4.1. Implants processing and H&amp;amp;E staining 

 The implants were collected with the surrounding tissues and processed for histology. 

The retrieved implants together with the surrounding tissue were fixed in 10% neutral 

buffered formalin. The specimens were cut to obtain 3 µm thickness longitudinal and 

transverse sections to analyse the kinetics of degradation of the scaffolds. Sections were 

stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) to evaluate the in vivo degradation and cellular 

infiltration throughout the implants.

 149 

2.4.2. Masson?s trichrome staining 

 Masson?s trichrome stain was used to evaluate the amount and the distribution of 

mature collagen. This stain is useful to differentiate collagen fibers from other fibers, 

particularly smooth muscle and elastin. Masson trichrome stains collagen green, nuclei black 

and cytoplasm red.  

 

2.4.3. Immunohistochemistry 

 Immunostaining for ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) antibody was performed to 

assess the vascularization degree. Antigen retrieval was heat induced in a water bath at 

96ºC for 20 min, with incubation of the slides in citrate buffer (pH=6). The slides were washed 

with phosphate buffer saline and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.6% hydrogen 

peroxide (H2O2) in methanol, at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. R.T.U. Vectastain® 

Universal Elite ABC Kit (Vector, VCPK-7200) was used for antibody incubation, according to 

the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, sections were incubated with primary antibody 

(Abcam, ab5694) overnight at 4ºC, in a humidified atmosphere. After washing with 

phosphate bufferes saline, antibody detection was revealed by using the Peroxidase 

Substrate Kit DAB (Vector, VCSK-4100). Slides were washed in water for 5 minutes and then 

counterstained with Harris? haematoxylin for nuclear contrast. All images were obtained using 

an Olympus BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera (Olympus 

DP70).  

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Weight loss and water uptake 

 In this study, scaffolds based on chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) were prepared by 
melt spinning and fiber bonding (18, 19). The main aim of the in vitro degradation studies 

was to simulate physiological conditions using enzymes present in human serum, which are 

responsible for the degradation of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds. 

 Degradation studies using lysozyme and/or lipase were performed using dynamic (60 

rpm). No differences were observed in the pH of the different degradation solutions after 

each incubation time.

 The ability of a material to absorb water and its water permeability are important 

parameters to be studied, since it will influence the absorption of body fluids and the transfer 

of cell nutrients and metabolites throughout the materials. The water uptake data (Figure 1) 

shows that scaffolds immersed in phosphate buffered saline solution (control) in dynamic 

conditions without changing the solutions, have a hydration degree of approximately 40%. 

Those scaffolds were blends of chitosan (50% wt), an extremely hydrophilic material and 

poly(butylene succinate), known to be more hydrophobic than chitosan. When only lysozyme 

was present, the degradation of the scaffolds was quite similar to the control (Figure 1). 

However, in the presence of lipase or lipase with lysozyme, the water uptake of the materials 

had a remarkable increase (Figure 1). This behaviour might be due to degradation of the 

scaffolds in the presence of these enzymes.  

 

 
 

Figure 1. Water uptake of the scaffolds as a function of immersion time in PBS with 
lysozyme (13 mg/L), lipase (110 U/L) and both lipase and lysozyme. PBS alone was used as 

a control (pH 7.4, T=37ºC), in dynamic conditions. 

 

 When analyzing the weight loss profile using lysozyme or lipase, few differences were 

observed (Figure 2). The degradation of chitosan in the human body has been reported to be 

mediated by lysozyme (39, 40). The scaffolds immersed in phosphate buffered saline 

supplemented with lysozyme presented the highest weight loss (5%) in the first week, as 

compared with the other conditions. The weight loss remained constant until the end of the 

experiment (Figure 2). It was clear that degradation of the scaffolds in the presence of 

lysozyme it was not pronounced. This result might be explained by the degree of 

deacetylation of chitosan used in this study. This chitosan has 85% deacetilation degree and

it is well documented in the literature that the degree of deacetylation is inversely related to 

the degradation rate (38, 41, 43). 

 

 

Figure 2. Weight loss of the scaffolds as a function of immersion time in PBS with lysozyme 
(13 mg/L), lipase (110 U/L), and both lipase and lysozyme. PBS alone was used as a control 

(pH 7.4, T=37ºC), in dynamic conditions. 

 

 Lipase is an enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of ester bonds in polyesters (46, 

56). In the presence of lipase the values of weight loss were higher than those obtained in 

the presence of lysozyme, increasing as a function of immersion time (Figure 2). 

Nevertheless, immersion periods up to 12 weeks did not cause the scaffolds to loose their 

structural integrity in the presence of either lysozyme or lipase.  

 In order to investigate the effect of an enzyme cocktail containing lipase and 

lysozyme, the scaffolds were also incubated with both enzymes. The highest weight loss was 

observed in the presence of lipase and lysozyme together (Figure 2). These results are in 

agreement with previous studies using different enzymatic cocktails (57, 58). In contrast with 

the other conditions, lipase and lysozyme together induced the loss of structural integrity of 

the scaffolds after 3 weeks. At the 6th week, all scaffolds lost their structural integrity in the 

presence of both enzymes.  

 

3.2. Morphology of the scaffolds before and after in vitro degradation

degradation (Figures 3A and 3B). The surface of the fibers showed fractures as a result of 

degradation (Figures 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 3I and 3J). It is possible to observe that the 

samples incubated in phosphate buffered saline, evidence a rougher surface (Figures 3C 

and 3D). The scaffolds incubated with lysozyme solution (Figures 3E and 3F) presented 

cracks at the surface of the fiber, at the same level than in those incubated in phosphate 

buffered saline. This result may be explained by the fact that the chitosan used has a high 

level of deacetylation and it is well documented in the literature that for high degrees of 

deacetylation, lysozyme has a minimal effect on the polymer degradation (38). However for 

scaffolds incubated with lipase solution (Figures 3G and 3H) more cracks are visible at the 

surface of the fibers, which confirms that lipase, is attacking the polyester phase. The 

combination of both lysozyme and lipase (Figures 3I and 3J), as expected by the water 

uptake and weight loss results, evidenced larger cracks at the surface of the fibers.

3.3. Biocompatibility assessment by histological analysis 

 No signs of infection were observed during the study or after surgery. Scaffolds were 
implanted subcutaneously and explants were retrieved after 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Local 

tissue integration, inflammatory response and degradation behavior were assessed by 

histological stains (H&amp;amp;E and Masson´s thricrome). 

 The implantation of a biomaterial may result in injury to tissues or organs (53, 59). 

The tissue response to injury depends on various factors, including the extent of the injury, 

blood-material interactions, extent or degree of cellular necrosis, provisional matrix formation 

and the inflammatory response (54). Materials currently used in clinical applications 

considered non-immunogenic, non-toxic and chemically inert, elicit frequently acute and 

potential chronic inflammatory response (60).  

 Chitin and chitosan have been shown to accelerate wound healing and the attainment 

of a good healing surface. Histological findings suggest that these substances stimulate 

migration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells and accelerate connective tissue 

regeneration and angiogenesis (61). It is also known that chitosan has the ability to attract 

neutrophils and activate macrophages (27, 62).  

 Histological sections of implanted scaffolds revealed that the porous morphology of 

the scaffolds is maintained after 7 days of implantation (Figure 4).

Wistar rats. B and D represent the magnified sections of selected areas (squares) of A and 

B, respectively. Black arrows point to blood vessels. Ch – chitosan, PBS – poly(butylene 

succinate). 

 

 A detailed observation of the sections evidenced that the inflammatory infiltrate is 

mainly constituted of neutrophils (Figure 4B). Those cells are characterized by multilobulated 

nuclei, recruited from blood circulation, reacting to the implantation of chitosan-poly(butylene 

succinate) scaffolds. These cells are characteristic of the acute inflammatory response, 

which is the initial process of inflammation process. Acute inflammation has short duration 

(hours to days) and is characterized by exudation of fluid and plasma proteins (edema) and 

the emigration of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils. The major role of these cells in acute 

inflammatory response is to phagocytose microorganisms and foreign materials. In the case 

of biomaterials, neutrophils are not able to phagocytose them because of the size disparity 

(Figure 4B).  



CHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber 
mesh scaffolds 

 155 

 At 3 weeks of implantation, the presence of neutrophils was almost residual. It was 

clear the presence of blood vessels within the scaffold structure (Figures 5C and 5D). 

Furthermore, smooth muscle actin immunostaining is visible inside the fibers of the scaffold 

(Figure 5B), which indicates that connective tissue is growing and vascularization is 

increasing throughout the scaffold (11). At the same time, collagen is being deposited by 

fibroblasts (Figure 6B). The appearance of blood vessels and fibrosis is an indication of a 

chronic inflammatory response. This type of response emerges when a persistent stimulus is 

present (59).

implantation. (A) Negative control. Black arrows point to new blood vessels. Dashed arrow 

points to a phagocyted chitosan particle. Ch – chitosan, PBS – poly(butylene succinate). 

 

 After 6 weeks of implantation (Figures 7A and 7B), it was possible to observe the 

evolution of the acute inflammatory response into a chronic response, by the presence of 

granulatomous tissue and giant cells. Chronic inflammatory response is longer than acute

and it is characterized by the presence of mononuclear cells, which includes macrophages, 

lymphocytes and plasma cells (63). Implantation of foreign materials elicits the normal foreign 

body reaction (FBR), i.e., foreign body reaction composed of foreign body giant cells and 

granulation tissue development, constituted by macrophages, fibroblasts and capillaries (54). 

Biodegradable materials elicit a FBR that, with time will become chronic until final 

degradation. In the case of non-degradable materials, the reaction continues until a capsule 

is formed around the implant, isolating it and FBR from the local tissue environment (60). 

Foreign body giant cells are formed when material particles are too large to be phagocytosed 

by macrophages and these cells fuse. In figure 5C it could be observed the phagocytosis of a 

chitosan particle by giant cells (dashed arrow). A major organization of the tissue within the 

implant was observed, with marked presence of ?-SMA (Figure 5C) and collagen deposition 

(Figure 6C).

 Up to 3 months, implanted scaffolds did not show evident signs of significant 

degradation. Histological findings only presented the ingrowth of cells within each fiber of the 

scaffold (Figures 8C and 8D). Giant cells attempted to phagocytose the particles of the 

scaffold, with some evidence, as presented in figure 6C. 

 

 

Figure 7. Representative H&amp;amp;E stained histological sections of tissues surrounding chitosan-

based implants after (A, B) 6 week and (C, D) 12 weeks of subcutaneous implantation in 

Wistar rats. B and D represent the magnified sections of selected areas (square) of A and B, 

respectively. Black arrows point to new blood vessels. Ch – chitosan, PBS – poly(butylene 

succinate). 

 

 After 12 weeks of implantation (Figures 7C and 7D), all scaffolds maintained its shape 

and structure, in contrast with the in vitro results, which after 6 weeks incubated in lipase and 

lysozyme, the scaffolds lost their structural integrity (Figure 2). Thus, it is clear that in vitro 

degradation was much faster than in vivo degradation. One fact that must be highlighted is 

that the magnitude of tissue response to a biodegradable material depends upon the site of 

implantation (64). Another issue is the type of the enzymes used, that even at concentrations 



CHAPTER VI. In vitro degradation and biocompatibility assessment of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber

 158 

similar to the ones found in human serum, are not from human origin and its action may be 

slightly different. Furthermore, in vitro tests provide a much more hydrated environment than 

the host environment in vivo. It is important to state as well that pH did not change during the 

entire in vitro experiment, being this a major factor contributing to medium acidification and 

accelerating the degradation effects (autocatalytic effect) (65). Since in vivo the degradation 

was slower it seems that pH also did not change, otherwise the scaffolds would evidence a 

higher degree of degradation.  

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 The degradation rate of the scaffolds must be tailored appropriately accordingly with 

the growth rate of the new tissue. It was shown that an enzymatic cocktail with lysozyme and 

lipase (in concentrations equivalent at the ones found in human body) had a strong positive 

effect on the scaffolds degradation in vitro. After 12 weeks of implantation, scaffolds did not 

lose their structural integrity. It should be noted the difference in kinetics of biodegradation in 

vitro and in vivo. A fast degradation in vivo is not desirable, since the degradation should be 

compatible with the rate of tissue formation and bone defects may require some months to 

heal. 

 The implanted scaffolds displayed a normal and mild tissue response, with the 

development of chronic inflammatory response and foreign body reaction.  

 It is therefore worthwhile continuing to investigate the functional performance 

potential of chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) fiber mesh scaffolds for bone tissue 

engineering and regenerative medicine.

ABSTRACT 

 Tissue Engineering sustains the need of a tridimensional (3D) scaffold to promote the 

regeneration of tissues in volume. Usually, scaffolds are seeded with an adequate cell 

population allowing its growth and maturation upon implantation in vivo.  

 Previous studies obtained by our group evidenced significant growth patterns and 

osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) when 

seeded and cultured on melt based porous chitosan fiber mesh scaffolds. Therefore, it is 

crucial to test the in vivo performance of the in vitro 3D constructs.  

 In this study, chitosan based scaffolds were seeded and cultured in vitro with 

hBMSCs for 3 weeks under osteogenic stimulation conditions and analyzed for cell adhesion, 

proliferation and differentiation. Implantation of 2 weeks pre-cultured constructs in osteogenic 

culture conditions was performed into critical cranial sized defects in nude mice. The 

objective of this study was to verify the scaffold integration and new bone formation. At 8 

weeks of implantation, scaffolds were harvested and prepared for micro computed 

tomography analysis (µCT). Retrieved implants showed good integration with the 

surrounding tissue and significant bone formation, more evident for the scaffolds cultured and 

implanted with human cells. 

 Results of this work demonstrated that chitosan based scaffolds, besides supporting 

in vitro proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, induced bone formation in 

vivo. Thus, it was validated its osteogenic potential in orthotopic location in immunodeficient 

mice, evidencing good prospects for its use in bone tissue engineering therapies.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 Tissue Engineering has emerged in the last 17 years as a new regenerative approach 
for the treatment of a variety of tissues, including bone. The concept is based on the 

development of strategies aimed at obtaining tissue and organ equivalents, that can replace 

or restore the natural features and physiological functions of natural tissues in vivo (1). One 

of the fundamental principles relies on the need of a specific cell population in combination 

with a 3D structure, in order to promote, in volume, tissue regeneration (2) 

 The ideal cell population is considered to be autologous undifferentiated stem cells 

that can be isolated from adult sources. Although embryonic stem cells display an enormous 

potential, they raise ethical and moral issues, mainly because of the removal and destruction 

of human embryos (3). In this context, adult stem cells present an alternative option, being 

isolated from several sources, such as bone marrow (4), brain, liver, skin, skeletal muscle, 

intestine, pancreas, peripheral blood, dental pulp (3), adipose tissue (5) or fetal tissues such 

as umbilical cord (6) or amniotic fluid. Stem cells are defined as cells that have clonogenic 

and self-renewing capabilities and that differentiate into multiple cell lineages (7). 

 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be combined with appropriate carriers – 

scaffolds – where a cell population will be grown and further implanted in vivo. Scaffolds 

used for tissue engineering purposes mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the 

regenerating bone environment. Selection of the material for scaffold production in bone 

related applications is a very important step towards the creation of a tissue-engineered 

construct (8). 

 In the last years, natural polymers emerged as an alternative to synthetic polymers, 

mainly due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Most of the synthetic biomaterials 

are effective in supporting bone regeneration, either alone or in conjunction with growth 

factors, although they display limitations. Ideally this structure should be biodegradable, 

allowing cells to adhere and proliferate, leading to the formation of ECM (9). Different natural 

based polymers have been proposed for this demanding application, such as starch (10, 11) 

and chitosan (12-15). Chitosan has shown an excellent combination of properties, including 

non-antigenicity and non-cytotoxicity, making this biomaterial quite attractive for bone tissue 

engineering applications (16, 17).  

 We have developed a set of biomaterials using the thermal based processing of 

thermoplastic polymers, by blending chitosan (Ch) with different aliphatic polyesters such as, 

poly-(?-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene terephthalate 

adipate) (PBTA), and poly(butylene succinate adipate) (PBSA) (18, 19). After testing the 



CHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone 
repair in a mouse calvaria model  

169 

eventual cytotoxicity of the developed scaffolds, the next step consisted on the biological 

screening of the most suitable scaffold formulation for bone tissue engineering applications. 

For that, we tested several blends with a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line (BMC9), 

promoting the differentiation into the osteogenic lineage. Results evidenced that the 

chitosan–PBS blend formulation, 50% wt, and 60% porosity, showed the best performance in 

terms of cell behavior (13). Further studies were performed using human bone marrow 

mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in fiber mesh scaffold morphology, with excellent results, 

in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation (15). Also, osteogenic 

differentiation of these cells onto the scaffolds was consistently detected by the presence of 

mineralized ECM (20, 21). Therefore, the fibrous morphology enhanced conditions to 

promote cell infiltration into the inner regions of the scaffold. 

 Thus, the next step is to evaluate this tissue engineering strategy in vivo, using a 

feasible animal model. For that, we have selected the cranial defect in nude mice (22, 23) 

since it enables testing several aspects of this strategy. Calvaria is a flat bone, which allows 

the creation of a uniform circular defect with an adequate size for easier surgical procedure 

and specimen handling. Fixation is provided by the dura mater and the overlying skin. The 

model has been thoroughly used and studied and is well reproduced (22-24). The low 

vascularization in cranial area turns this model one of the toughest to evaluate the in vivo 

performance of tissue engineered constructs (25). The nude mouse model is required since 

human cells will be implanted, avoiding graft rejection responses from the host (20). The 

critical size defect (CSD) for this model is 4-5 mm. A CSD is defined as the intraosseous 

wound in a specifically bone and species of animal without spontaneous healing during the 

lifetime of the animal (21). 

 Herein, we have selected compression molded - salt leaching scaffolds. We 

considered this production method as the most appropriate for the development of scaffolds 

that meet the required dimensions to fit into the animal calvaria defect. In the present study, 

we have assessed the in vitro biological behavior of hBMSCs cultured on Ch-PBS scaffolds, 

and these 3D constructs were validated in an in vivo model of a critical cranial defect in nude 

mice.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Scaffolds production 

 The scaffolds used in this study were produced by melt based compression molding 

followed by salt leaching. Briefly, chitosan was melt blended with PBS (50% in weight) by 

extrusion and further grinded into a powder. This powder was subjected to a solid mixing with 

salt particles with size between 250 and 500 µm, and a salt content of 60%. Details on the 

processing methodology can be found elsewhere (19).  

 

2.2. Scaffolds characterization 

 Cross-sections of all the developed scaffolds were analyzed using a Leica-Cambridge 

S-360 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for preliminary assessment on their morphology. 

All the samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to the SEM analysis. 

 To evaluate the internal 3D structure of the scaffolds, micro computed tomography 

equipment (SkyScan, Belgium) was used as a non-destructive characterization methodology. 

Three scaffolds were scanned in high resolution mode of 8.7 µm x/y/z and an exposure time 

of 1792 ms. The scanner energy was set to 63 keV with 157 µA current. µCT scans followed 

by 3-D reconstruction (µCT analyzer and a µCT Volume Realistic 3D Visualization, from 

SkyScan) of serial image sections allowed to reconstruct and analyze the 3D 

microarchitecture of the scaffolds, pore morphology, determination of porosity and 

interconnectivity. 

 

2.3. In vitro cell culture 

 Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from bone marrow and 

characterized for the MSC phenotype (26). Cells were expanded in alpha minimum essential 

medium (?-MEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, 

Germany), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (PeproTech, USA) and 1% of 

antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).  When a sufficient cell number was 

obtained, cells at passage 2 were seeded onto scaffolds at a density of 2.5x105 cells/scaffold. 

After 24 hours of attachment, constructs were placed in new 24-well plates and 1 ml of 

osteogenic medium containing dexamethasone 10-8 M (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ascorbic acid 



CHAPTER VII. Chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds and human bone marrow stromal cells induce bone 
repair in a mouse calvaria model  

171 

50 ?g/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ?-glycerophosphate 10 mM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was 

added to each well. The constructs were cultured for 7, 14, and 21 days in a humidified 

atmosphere at 37ºC, containing 5% CO2.  

 

2.3.1. Cell adhesion and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

 Cell adhesion, morphology and distribution throughout the scaffolds were analyzed by 

SEM. Constructs were fixed and dehydrated using a sequence of ethanol gradients and 

further sputter coated with gold (JEOL JFC-1100) to analyze using a Leica Cambridge S360 

scanning electron microscope. 

 

2.3.2. Cell viability assay - MTS test 

 Cell viability was assessed after 3 hours, 7, 14, and 21 days using the MTS test. 

Constructs (n=3) were washed in phosphate buffered saline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 

immersed in a mixture consisting of serum-free cell culture medium and MTS reagent in a 5:1 

ratio and incubated for 3 hours at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 

Scaffolds alone incubated for the same time in osteogenic medium were used as controls. 

After this, 200 µl (n=3) were transferred to 96 well plates and the optical density (O.D.) was 

measured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an absorbance of 490 nm. 

 

2.3.3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) quantification 

Samples were washed with phosphate buffered saline solution and transferred to 1.5 

ml microtubes containing 1ml of ultra-pure water. Constructs (n=3) were cryopreserved at -

80ºC for further analysis. Prior to ALP quantification, samples were thawed and sonicated for 

15 min. 

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured by the specific conversion of p-

nitrophenol phosphate (pNpp) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into p-nitrophenol (pNp). The 

enzymatic reaction was set up by mixing 100 ml of the sample with 300 ml of substrate buffer 

containing 1 M diethanolamine HCl (pH 9.8) and 2 mg/ml of pNp. The solution was further 

incubated at 37ºC for 1 hour and the reaction was stopped by adding a solution containing 2

repair in a mouse calvaria model 

172 

M NaOH and 0.2 mM EDTA. The O.D. was determined at 405 nm. A standard curve was 

made using pNp values ranging from 0 to 20 µmol/ml.  

 

2.4. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice 

 Athymic nude mice with 7 weeks old (Harlan, Jerusalem, Israel) were used to 

examine the healing of cranial critical size bone defects in response to transplants in the 

defects according to the method described previously (20). All procedures involving the use 

of animals were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care 

and Use Committee of the Technion, Israel.           

 The in vitro cell-scaffold constructs were cultured in osteogenic inducing medium for 2 

weeks prior implantation. Each scaffold was seeded with 1x106 cells. All surgeries were 

performed under a protocol approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of the Technion, 

Israel. 

 Two bilateral critical-size circular defects (5 mm diameter and 1 mm thick) were 

performed with a hand drill and trephine bit in the parietal bones of the skull on either side of 

the sagittal suture line (Figure 1). Care was taken not to damage the sagittal suture or to 

interrupt the dura mater beneath the bone. During the procedure, sterile saline was dripped 

over the drilling site in order to avoid extensive heating and to protect the brain. Figure 1 

illustrates the location of the defects in the mice crania. Surgeries were performed under 

general anesthesia (xylazine:ketamine, 1:1 solution in saline) by intra peritoneal injection.

 Scaffolds were randomly implanted into the defects and divided into 2 experimental 

groups that received the following implants: scaffolds seeded and cultured for 2 weeks with 

1x106 hBMSC and scaffold without cells A total of 6 nude mice were used and 12 cranial

defects were created. Animals were kept under aseptic conditions. After 8 weeks post-

surgery, animals were euthanized and crania were removed, cleaned, and fixed immediately 

in formalin for 24 h to be analyzed by µCT analysis. Briefly, the mice crania (with or without 

cells) were also analyzed using a high-resolution µCT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, 

Kontich, Belgium). Six specimens were scanned in high resolution mode using a pixel size of 

19.13 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source was set at 91 keV of energy and 

110 ?A of current. For all the scanned specimens representative data sets of 1023 slices 

were transformed into binary using a dynamic threshold of 255-120, to distinguish bone from 

polymeric material. This data was used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyzer v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan). 3D virtual models of the mice crania were created, visualized, and registered 

using image processing software (ANT 3D creator v2.4, SkyScan).  

 

2.5. Statistical analysis 

Results of MTS and ALP are expressed as mean ± standard deviation with n=3 for 

each group. Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student?s t-test 

multiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p&lt;0.01). 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Scaffolds characterization 

 SEM micrographs of the porous scaffolds are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows 

scaffolds morphology with 4 mm diameter and 1 mm thick. Previous studies (13, 27, 28) 

demonstrated that these scaffolds had adequate porosity to allow extensive cell proliferation

  For a detailed characterization of the scaffolds? internal structure, µCT studies were 

conducted. Images of the region of interest were acquired and transformed into binary 

images (Figure not shown). For all scaffolds, a dynamic threshold ranging from 255–150 gray 

scale values was used to distinguish polymer material from pore voids. Individual 2D analysis 

of the binary images (with a circle of interest of 4.5 mm2) (Figure 2a) was obtained from the 

scaffold cross-sections (Figure 2a), consisting of 300 slices (Figure 2b) and used for 

morphometric analysis (Table I).

the sequence of 2D sections (b).

 The overall porosity of approximately 60% is consistent with the amount of leachable 

NaCl particles used in scaffolds? preparation. The average pore size is lower than expected, 

since the selected range of NaCl particles used was between 250 and 500 micrometers. 

However, the mixing in the solid phase and the subsequent compression molding may cause 

significant reduction of the leachable particles, and consequently of the pore size. The level 

of interconnectivity indicates that most of the pores are open and probably allow cell 

infiltration into the scaffold? inner pores.

3.2. In vitro cell culture studies 

3.2.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

 SEM analysis showed that cells present a great affinity to the scaffolds surface, which 

is evident by the massive cell adhesion at the surface of the scaffolds (Figure 4).  

 

 

Figure 4. SEM micrographs of the seeded scaffolds cultured under osteogenic induction, 
after 1 week (a and b), 2 weeks (c and d) and 3 weeks (e and f).  

 

 Previous results also showed this cell behavior at the surface of similar scaffolds (15). 

After only 1 week of culture (Figures 4a and 4b) it was already visible a remarkable cell 

proliferation on the 3D structures. At the second week of culture, it was shown that a 

multilayer of cells is covering the surface of the 3D scaffold (Figures 4c and 4d). After 3 

weeks of culture, it was visible that cell proliferation further developed into a dense multilayer 

cell structure (Figure 4e). Furthermore, it was clear the presence of Ca-P deposits (Figure 

4f), corresponding to the produced mineralized ECM that was visible at higher 

magnifications. These results were confirmed by EDS analysis performed in samples 

cultured up to 21 days (Figure 5). Unseeded scaffolds (kept immersed in osteogenic medium 

for the same period of time) were used as control of EDS analysis. The presence of Ca and P 

peaks in the spectrum confirmed the presence of Ca and P elements at the surface of the 

cell seeded scaffolds, which indicated that cells are producing mineralized ECM and thus 

confirming the osteogenic differentiation after 21 days of culture.

3.2.2. Cell viability (MTS) 

 Cell viability assay (MTS) was used to assess the activity of the cells over time. 

Results demonstrated that hBMSCs seeded onto chitosan-PBS scaffolds were able to reduce 

MTS substrate and progressively increased its metabolic activity during the time of culture 

(Figure 6).

conditions as a function of time.

177 

 Cell viability assay (MTS) was used to assess the activity of the cells over time. 

Results demonstrated that hBMSCs seeded onto chitosan-PBS scaffolds were able to reduce 

MTS substrate and progressively increased its metabolic activity during the time of culture 

(Figure 6). The obtained optical density values show a significant increase after 21 days of 

culture. These results were corroborated by SEM images (Figure 4), with the increase of cell 

colonization over time. Furthermore, the presence of such active cells just after seeding (time 

0), corresponded to a great seeding efficacy, which was due to the preference of the cells for 

these scaffolds, instead of the tissue culture plate. These results were in accordance with 

previous results using different cells cultured onto similar scaffold (13, 15, 27, 28). 

 

3.2.3 Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) 

 The ALP activity of human MSCs cultured onto the scaffolds did not follow the typical 

trend of this marker of osteogenic differentiation, as it is demonstrated after 21 days (Figure 

7). After this time point, a significant increase in ALP activity was observed (Figure 7). 

Usually, ALP reaches a peak at an earlier time point. However, the presence of visible 

deposits of mineralized matrix after 21 days (SEM images, cell viability and EDS results) 

suggests that cells were viable and continued to deposit matrix, thereby indicating the cells? 

osteogenic differentiation.

function of time.

3.3. In vivo cranial defect in nude mice  

 After in vitro studies, the following step involved the in vivo validation, using a suitable 

animal model. For that, constructs were tested using a critical size cranial defect. Briefly, we 

planned a study using the critical size calvaria bone defect in nude mice, using Ch-PBS 

scaffolds and human cells. In this way, we were able to test both the viability of the 3D cell-

construct in vivo, as well as the ability of those constructs to regenerate bone tissue. Cranial 

reconstruction represents a unique model to study bone regeneration, mainly because the 

calvaria is an anatomic area under limited mechanical stress, quite unlike the axial skeleton, 

which is subjected to long periods of compressive load (29). We used a 5 mm diameter 

defect, based in previous data found in the literature, showing that adult nude mice did not 

demonstrate significant calvaria bone healing in defects of 3, 4 and 5 mm in diameter (20).  

 Scaffolds? diameter was optimized to enable some swelling before implantation. 

Previous studies showed that these scaffolds have approximately 21% of water uptake. 

Based on these findngs, we have implanted scaffolds with 4.5mm of diameter to match the 

size of the defect at the time of implantation. 

 Bone formation was evaluated by µCT. This methodology is a low radiation and a non 

invasive method for studying the structure of bone samples. This technique can generate 

high-resolution images and provide the accurate quantitative analysis of the bone structure 

parameters (30). 

 Bone possesses some self-healing capacity. However, there is a limit to the size of 

bone fractures and defects that can be self-repaired. This limit is designated “critical size 

defect” (21, 23) and will not heal completely during the lifetime of the patient. For large bone 

defects, medical intervention is often necessary to repair the bone. In this study we have 

used hBMSCs cultured onto chitosan based scaffolds, in order to assess the ability of these 

tissue engineered constructs to induce bone regeneration in nude mice cranial critical size 

defects. To our knowledge, there are few studies documenting the use of xenogeneic grafs 

(i.e., human cells and scaffolds) on the athymic nude mouse model (31-34). We have used 

nude mice in order to study the osteogenic potential of the hBMSCs seeded and cultured on 

Ch-PBS scaffolds, when implanted in a critical size defect. The µCT results suggested that 

after 8 weeks of implantation, constructs promoted bone regeneration of the calvaria critical 

size defect (Figure 8).

show the endpoint result after 8 weeks, of bone healing upon implantation of scaffolds in the 

cranial defect of nude mice. E – empty; Sc – scaffold alone; Sc+MSCs – scaffolds with 

hBMSCs pre-cultured in vitro in osteogenic medium.  

 

 Micro CT images also support that scaffolds cultured with MSCs presented enhanced 

bone ingrowth. Some of the images clearly show an almost complete healing of the defect 

(Figures 8b and 8c). These findings are in accordance with previous results where scaffolds 

seeded with pre-induced osteogenic MSCs enhanced bone regeneration in critical size defect 

when the same animal model was used (32). Scaffolds per se were able to induce some 

bone regeneration/ingrowth (Figure 8c). New bone formation could be due to invading 

reparative cells from the dura or from adjacent host tissues. The selected implantation time 

seemed to be adequate for assessing the complete bone healing at the site defect, as shown 

in figure 8c. Further studies need to be addressed using these scaffolds without cells, in 

immunocompetent animals, to confirm the tissue regeneration ability of Ch-PBS scaffolds. 

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 In the present study, chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds were successfully 
produced by melt-based compression molding followed by salt leaching. The 

microarchitecture of the scaffolds was assessed by SEM and µCT, revealing a fully porous 

and interconnected 3D structure.  

 In vitro cell culture studies using hBMSCs have shown properties compatible with

repair in a mouse calvaria model 

180 

bone engineering applications. Cells evidenced high levels of viability as a function of 

cultured time and well correlated with SEM images that showed extensive cell colonization of 

the scaffolds. The produced ECM showed the presence of Ca and P elements, detected in 

EDS spectra of cultured scaffolds? surface, which confirmed the mineralization. Successful 

bone regeneration was achieved using the critical size defect in calvaria of nude mice, with 

prominent results for the in vitro cell construct compared to the scaffold without cells. 

 The combination of good biological performance of hBMSCs cultured onto chitosan 

based scaffolds and the ability to regenerate bone tissue in a critical size defect, significantly 

expands previous evidences that these materials can and will have a role to play in bone 

tissue engineering strategies.  

 This study evidenced very positive results that highlight the possibility of chitosan-

PBS-hBMSCs constructs to be used as implants for non load-bearing bone defects.

CHAPTER IX 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS 

 Bone is a complex and dynamic tissue composed of different cell types contributing to 

the maintenance of homeostasis throughout life. Fractures are one of the most common 

occurrences associated with the musculoskeletal system. They can result from trauma or 

they can be a side effect of bone related diseases, such as osteoporosis or bone cancer, 

which weakens the bone and compromises its integrity. One of the most promising therapies 

is bone tissue engineering. There are several strategies within this field such as delivery of 

isolated autologous cells, associate these autologous cells to an appropriate three-

dimensional (3D) support - scaffold, and/or by incorporating bioactive molecules into 

scaffolds in order to promote bone regeneration. 

 The bone tissue engineering strategy followed under the scope of this thesis was 

based on the use of a biodegradable scaffold that will act as a support for cells to adhere, 

proliferate and differentiate into an osteogenic phenotype, creating a bone extracellular 

matrix (ECM). These in vitro structures (constructs) were ultimately implanted in a relevant 

animal model, validating the tissue engineering strategy.  

  The scaffold has a major importance in this strategy and several properties are 

required in order to be functional. It must have adequate mechanical properties to support the 

tissue growth at the bone defect. A highly porous and interconnected structure is required for 

cell ingrowth. Furthermore, it should be biodegradable in the human body at a similar rate to 

neo-tissue formation. The material used for scaffold production should be non-toxic, non-

immunogenic and biocompatible. The natural occurring polymer chitosan has emerged as a 

suitable biomaterial to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, since it presents the 

adequate characteristics.  

 In this thesis, the osteogenic potential of chitosan based scaffolds seeded and 

cultured with primary cultures of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) 

was evaluated. In chapter III, different scaffolds containing the same percentage of chitosan 

and different aliphatic polyesters poly(butylene succinate), poly(butylene terephtalate 

adipate) and poly(caprolactone) were studied, by means of cytotoxicity and direct contact 

tests using cell lines. It was demonstrated that all scaffolds produced by compression 

molding followed by salt leaching were cytocompatible and clearly non-toxic to the cells. The 

direct contact evaluation with a mesenchymal stem cell line, under osteogenic culture 

conditions, showed that chitosan-poly(butylene succinate) (Ch-PBS) formulation evidenced 



CHAPTER VIII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS 

 

188 

superior results, when compared to all studied formulations. The previous results raised the 

following question: why Ch-PBS formulation promoted superior in vitro cellular response? In 

order to answer that question, the work described in chapter IV was designed to study the 

influence of different percentages of chitosan (0, 25 and 50%) and PBS (100, 75 and 50%) 

on cell behavior in vitro. The main aim of this study was to analyze the influence of chitosan 

content on cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of primary cultures of hBMSCs. 

Scaffolds containing a higher content of chitosan showed greater cell performance, by 

presenting major cell adhesion and enhanced cell viability. Furthermore, it evidenced higher 

levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and upregulation of ostegenic genes. PBS scaffolds 

(100%) consistently showed the inferior results in terms of cell performance. Additionally, the 

in vivo tissue response was evaluated by implanting the higher chitosan containing 

formulation and PBS only, for one month, in different anatomic regions (cranial, auricular and 

submuscular) of rats. The selection of these regions was performed to verify about different 

inflammatory response, based on the degree of vascularization of each tissue. The resident 

inflammatory cells were macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and foreign body giant 

cells. These types of cells are presented when chronic inflammatory reaction is developed, 

and is typical for implanted biomaterials, considered to be normal. The implanted scaffolds 

did not evidence fibrotic encapsulation. PBS scaffolds showed cell necrosis in all tissue 

locations, which is not a positive indication. These results demonstrated that chitosan 

showed a superior effect in terms of cell behavior, both in vitro as in vivo. After the initial 

screening of the proposed chitosan based materials for bone tissue engineering scaffolding it 

was possible to conclude that chitosan is, indeed, relevant to improve the biological 

performance of the scaffolds both in vitro as in vivo in terms of inflammatory response. 

 In chapter V, chitosan–poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds with a different morphology 
were produced to optimize cell ingrowth in the previous morphology. The scaffolds were 

prepared by a fiber bonding methodology, which allowed obtaining a fiber mesh porous 

structure, with an adequate porosity and interconnectivity. Several studies were conducted to 

conclude about cell adhesion, viability, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation onto these 

scaffolds structure. The developed scaffolds also evidenced cytocompatibility and no signs of 

cytotoxicity by showing excellent cell behavior, in terms of adhesion, proliferation and 

viability. Moreover, hBMSCs seeded and cultured onto the 3D structures in osteogenic 

culture conditions, evidenced successful osteogenic differentiation by expressing osteogenic 

related genes, as well as production of a mineralized ECM. This optimized scaffold 

morphology kept the excellent in vitro biological performance of the scaffolds. The next step 



CHAPTER VII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS 

189 

was to evaluate the degradation of those scaffolds, both in vitro and in vivo, as reported in 

chapter VI. It is known that biodegradation of the scaffold must be at a similar rate as new 

tissue is developed, which turns the study of the degradation of the scaffolds used in tissue 

engineering a key issue to be analyzed. To study chitosan-PBS degradation in vitro, 

enzymes responsible for the degradation of both scaffold components (lipase and lysozyme, 

respectively) were used, in concentrations similar to those in human serum. The weight loss 

and water uptake results showed that an enzymatic cocktail with lysozyme and lipase 

evidenced a greater effect on the scaffolds degradation in vitro. Moreover, in scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs, it was possible to observe cracks in the fibers of the 

scaffold structure, being more pronounced for the condition with lipase and lysozyme 

together. The biodegradation of chitosan-PBS scaffolds was also evaluated in vivo by a 

period of three months. For that, a subcutaneous rat model was used. After 12 weeks all 

scaffolds maintained their structural integrity, denoting a slower degradation kinetics that the 

one observed in vitro. Host tissue response evidenced a normal chronic inflammatory 

response. The host tissue response was also assessed. After one week of implantation, it 

was visible an acute inflammatory reaction with the main cells being neutrophils. The 

evolution to a chronic inflammatory response was observed at the third week, when the 

presence of neutrophils was almost residual and the resident cells were macrophages, 

lymphocytes, plasma cells and foreign body giant cells. Alpha smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) 

immunostaining was visible throughout the implant, indicating that connective tissue was 

growing and the degreed of vascularization increased as a function of time. At the same time, 

collagen was being deposited by fibroblasts, confirmed by Masson´s thricrome staining that 

specifically stains mature collagen. After 12 weeks, the connective tissue became more 

organized, by marked presence of ?-SMA and more giant cells were observed. Longer time 

periods of implantation are required to investigate about the biodegradation of these 

scaffolds, both in vitro as in vivo. However, the results obtained showed that the slower rate 

of degradation in vivo, as compared to the studied model in vitro, is positive, since the 

kinetics of biodegradation needs to match to the kinetics of the neotissue formation. Being 

the scaffolds a temporary support for tissue ingrowth, in the specific case of bone tissue, this 

time frame is not fast. 

 In the last chapter of this thesis, the tissue engineering strategy herein described was 
validated in vivo. For that, it was used a critical size defect in calvaria of nude mice, which 

allows to use human MSCs by excluding the immune response mediated by T cells. The 

cranial defects used were considered critical size defects with a diameter of 5 mm and two 

for each animal. The hBMSCs were pre-cultured in osteogenic conditions on chitosan-PBS

scaffolds obtained by compression molding followed by salt leaching. After assessing the in 

vitro biological performance of the hBMSCs seeded and cultured onto the scaffolds, in 

osteogenic culture conditions, these constructs were implanted into cranial defects in nude 

mice, demonstrating some bone regeneration with chitosan-PBS scaffolds per se, although 

the most prominent results were observed for in vitro matured constructs. These results 

confirm several reports described in the literature, where cell perform a key role in bone 

formation.  

 The work developed in this PhD thesis leads to the conclusion that chitosan-

poly(butylene succinate) scaffolds in combination with autologous bone marrow MSCs have 

all the requisites in vitro as in vivo to design effective bone tissue engineering strategies.  

 It is, however, important to continue the research on these chitosan based scaffolds. 

One of the hypotheses is to assess the degree of bone regeneration in large animal models, 

combining the scaffolds with autologous cells pre-cultured in osteogenic culture conditions. 

Other hypothesis is to use other source of cells, different from bone marrow. Fetal stem cells 

are in the front line of regenerative medicine field, mostly due to its easy accessibility and 

associated non-immunogenicity, which turns these cells adequate to be used in an allogenic 

setting, avoiding issues of donor morbidity.
