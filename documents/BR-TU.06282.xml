RESUMO 

 

A partir de mapeamento geológico, análises petrográficas, geoquímicas, geocronológicas e 

microestruturais em rochas metavulcânicas e metassedimentares, foi possível reconhecer duas 

sucessões de rochas metassedimentares – metavulcânicas de fácies xisto verde no sudoeste do 

Terreno Apiaí no cinturão Ribeira (entre Itapeva e Ribeirão Branco, SP): o Grupo Itaiacoca e a 

Formação Bairro dos Prestes. O Grupo Itaiacoca, datado pelo método U-Pb em zircão, 

apresentou idades neoproterozoicas entre 602,7 ± 24 (metabasito) e 613,4 ± 9,6 Ma (metatufo). 

É constituído por uma sucessão de metargilitos, filitos e quartzitos de granulação fina 

(Formação Água Nova), intercalados com metacalcários calcíticos e dolomíticos com estruturas 

estromatolíticas e pequenas camadas de tufo metavulcânico (Formação Bairro dos Campos) em 

contato transicional com rochas metabásicas, metadolomitos, e talco xisto e clorita xisto (Suíte 

Metabásica da Fazenda Velha) com quartzitos maciços (Formação Serra dos Macacos) 

sobrepondo todas as unidades. Com base na caracterização geoquímica, as metabásicas com 

assinaturas toleíticas e calci-alcalinas possuem padrões de manto tipo MORB com contribuição 

de componentes de subdução típicos de basaltos de bacias de retroarco. A Formação Bairro dos 

Prestes foi depositada entre 1761 ± 14 e ~ 1800 Ma (datada pelo metodo U-Pb SHRIMP em 

zircão de metariodacito e metavulcanossedimentar, respectivamente). A formação é composta 

por filitos, localmente com estruturas amigdaloides, em contato transicional com quartzitos de 

granulação fina a média, com camadas subordinadas de  metaconglomerados e rohas 

metavulcânicas félsicas com assinatura calci-alcalina de alto K. 

Na área de estudo também estão presentes as rochas sedimentares paleozoicas do Grupo Itararé, 

os metarenitos quartzo-feldspáticos ediacaranos de granulação grossa da margem direita do rio 

Apiaí-Guaçu, a suite granítica ediacarana Três Córregos e o Complexo paleoproterozoico Apiaí 

Mirim. O Complexo Apiaí Miriam compreende paragnaisses e quartzitos micáceos de 

granulação média a grossa afetados por metamorfismo de fácies anfibolito, enquanto a Suite 

Granítica Três Córregos é constituída por monzogranitos porfiríticos e sienogranitos 

subordinados. A idade máxima de deposição obtida pelo método U-Pb LA-ICP-MS em zircões 

detríticos do Metarenito Apiaí-Guaçu foi de 588,4 ± 1,8 Ma, o que permite correlacioná-la com 

as bacias da fase de transição do ciclo Brasiliano. 

 

O arranjo estrutural compreende acamamento sedimentar (So) e três foliações tectônicas (Sn, 

Sn+1 e Sn+2). A foliação principal (Sn) é caracterizada por xistosidade ou clivagem ardosiana, 

geralmente paralelas a So, apresentando direções NE-SW e mergulhos elevados. Os planos Sn  



são deformados pelas clivagens de crenulação Sn+1 e Sn+2. A foliação Sn+1 está associada a 

dobras apertadas com planos axiais com direção NW desenvolvidas nos quartzitos, nas 

sequências metavulcanossedimentares e rochas pelíticas, enquanto a folição Sn+2 associa-se 

como dobras abertas com planos axiais com direção NE nos quartzitos e filitos. A área de estudo 

também é afetada por falhas NNW-SSE e NNE-SSW. 

A análise microestrutural realizada em amostras da Formação Bairro dos Prestes e do Complexo 

Apiaí Mirim através de técnicas de Orientação Preferencial de Forma (OPF) e Orientação 

Cristalográfica Preferencial (OCP), indica uma forma oblata para o elipsoide de deformação 

finita com planos XY na direção NE-SW e X-direções com alta obliquidade, correlacionadas 

com os dados estruturais medidos em campo. As temperaturas de deformação calculadas a partir 

do ângulo de abertura das estruturas dos eixos-c variam de 531 ° C - 593 ° C a 613 ° C -703 ° 

C. Foram influenciadas pela presençia de água e pelos processos de dissolução, sendo por vezes 

maior que as temperaturas indicadas pelas associações minerais metamórficas (fácies xisto 

verde). As temperaturas de deformação também exibem um gradiente regional, com as 

temperaturas mais altas a sul e mais baixas a norte. 

Um regime transpressivo com predominância de cisalhamento puro é sugerido com base na 

forma oblata e nas altas obliquidades dos eixos X do elipsoide de deformação finita.  

O contexto geológico, os dados geocronológicos e geoquímicos sugerem que o Grupo Itaiacoca 

e a Formação Bairro dos Prestes podem ser correlacionados às formações Pirapora do Bom 

Jesus e Boturuna do Grupo São Roque. O Grupo Itaiacoca é interpretado como depositado em 

uma bacia de retroarco associada ao oceano Adamastor, provavelmente representando uma 

sutura ediacarana entre o Terreno Apiaí e o Craton Paranapanema.

ABSTRACT 

 

Field geological mapping, petrographic, geochemical, geochronological and microestrutural 

analysis obtained from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks led to the recognition of two 

greenschist facies metasedimentary-metavolcanic rock successions in Southwest of Apiaí 

Terrane in Ribeira belt (between Itapeva and Ribeirão Branco, SP): the Itaiacoca Group and 

Bairro dos Prestes Formation. The Itaiacoca Group dated by U-Pb method in zircon yield 

Neoproterozoic ages of 602.7 ± 24 (metabasite) and 613.5 ± 9.6 Ma (metatuff), it is constitute 

by a succession of metamudstone, phyllites and fine-grained quartzites (Água Nova Formation), 

intercalated with calcitic and dolomitic metalimestone with stromatolite structures and small 

beds of metatuff (Bairro dos Campos Formation) in transition contact with metabasites, 

metadolomites, talc schists and chlorite schists (Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite), and massive 

quartzites (Serra dos Macacos Formation) overlapping all the units. Based on geochemistry 

characterization, the metabasites with tholeiitic and calc-alkaline signatures have patterns of 

MORB-type mantle with contribution of subduction components typically of back-arc basin 

basalts. The Bairro dos Prestes Formation was deposited between 1761 ± 14 and ~1800 Ma 

(Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb data of metarhyodacite and metavolcanosedimentary rock, 

respectively), it is composed of phyllites sometimes with amygdaloid structures in transitional 

contact with fine to medium grained-quartzites and restricted metaconglomerate and felsic 

metavolcanic rocks with high-K calc-alkaline signature.  

In the study area is also present the flat-lying sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic Itararé Group, 

the Ediacaran fine to coarse-grained feldspathic quartz metasandstones of the Apiaí-Guaçu 

metasandstone, the Três Córregos Granitic Suite and the Paleoproterozoic Apiaí Mirim 

Complex. The Apiaí Miriam Complex comprises paragneiss and medium to coarse grained 

micaceous quartzite affected by amphibolite facies metamorphism, while the Três Córregos 

Granitic Suite consists of porphyritic monzogranite and subordinate sienogranite. The 

maximum depositional age calculated by U-Pb ICPMS- LA of detrital zircons of the Apiaí-

Guaçu metasandstone was 588.4±1.8 Ma which allows to correlate it with the transition stage 

basins of the Brasiliano Cycle. 

 The structural arrangement comprises relict bedding (So), and three tectonic foliations (Sn, Sn+1 

and Sn+2). The main foliation (Sn) is characterized as a schistosity or slaty cleavage, generally 

parallel to So, presenting NE-SW strikes and steep dips, and it is deformed by Sn+1 and Sn+2 

crenulation cleavages. The Sn+1 is associated with tight folds with NW axial-planes in quartzite, 



metavolcanosedimentary and pelitic sequence, and the Sn+2 with open folds with NE axial-

planes in quartzite and phyllite rocks. The study area is also affected by NNW-SSE and NNE-

SSW faults. 

The microstructural analysis was performed in samples of Bairro dos Prestes Formation and 

Apiaí Mirim Complex through Shape Preferential Orientation (SPO) and Lattice Preferred 

Orientation (LPO) techniques, determinate an oblate shape for the finite strain ellipsoid with 

XY planes with NE-SW strike and X-directions with high rake, correlated with the structural 

data measured in field.  The deformation temperatures calculated from opening-angle of c-axis 

structures vary from 531°C-593°C to 613°C-703°C, they were influenced by water weakling 

and solution-transfer process, being sometimes higher that the temperatures indicated by the 

metamorphic mineral assemblages (facies greenschists). The deformation temperatures also 

display a spatial gradient, in the south the highest temperatures are present, while in the north, 

the lowest temperatures were calculated. 

A transpressive regime with predominance of pure shear is suggested based on the oblate shape 

and high rake X axis of the finite strain ellipsoid.  

The geological context, geochronological and geochemical data suggest that the Itaiacoca 

Group and Bairro dos Prestes Formation can be correlated with Pirapora do Bom Jesus and 

Boturuna formations of São Roque Group. The Itaiacoca Group is interpreted as arc–back-arc 

basin system is associated with the large Adamastor Ocean, and probably represents an 

Ediacaran suture zone between the Apiaí Terrane and the Paranapanema Craton.

CHAPTER 1 

 

INTRODUCTION 

  

The Proterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic successions present in the South of Ribeira 

belt, in São Paulo and Paraná states, have been subject to a continuous debate about their ages, 

correlations, tectonic and paleogeographic environments (Soares, 1987; Campanha et al., 1987; 

Reis Neto, 1994; Campanha and Sadowski, 1999; Prazeres Filho, 2005; Salazar et al., 2013; 

Henrique-Pinto et al., 2015; Siga et al., 2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c; Faleiros et al., 2010, 2011a, 

2016).  

Especially the discussions about the tectonic and paleoenvironmental meaning of the Itaiacoca 

Group (Almeida, 1956; Petri and Suguiu, 1969; Souza, 1990, 1992) and its associated volcanic 

sucessions, like that in the Abapã region, Paraná state (Trein et al., 1985; Reis Neto, 1994; Siga 

Jr. et al., 2003, 2009) have occupied much of the technical literature about the region. 

In the São Paulo state on the northern continuity Itaiacoca Group, metasedimentary-

metavolcanic successions have been recognized in the Itapeva and Ribeirão Branco region by 

regional geological mapping (Theodorovicz et al., 1986, 1988; Theodorovicz and Câmara, 

1988; Takahashi et al., 1984) but until the moment poorly characterized in their petrographic, 

structural, geochemical and geochronological aspects. 

This contribution characterizes the metasedimentary-metavolcanic rock units present between 

Itapeva and Ribeirao Branco (SP), from 1:25,000 geological  mapping-scaled, petrographic and 

microstructural descriptions, and geochemical and geochronological analyses. It is also 

proposed the dismemberment of Bairro dos Prestes Formation from the Itaiacoca Group based 

on volcanic ages, and include a discussion of the possible tectonic settings and stratigraphic 

correlations of the units. The results, presented in the form of manuscripts of scientific papers, 

intended to be submitted to indexed journals.  

 

1.1 DISSERTATION ORGANIZATION 

 

This dissertation is organized in six chapters and three appendices. The current Chapter 1 

introduces the problem, objectives, the area and a general view of the materials and methods. 

The chapters 2 to 5 are presented in the format of manuscripts of papers to be submitted to 



 

18 
 

scientific journals. The chapter 6 summarizes the main conclusions. The appendix 1 present the 

map of outcrop points, the appendix 2 the geological map and the appendix 3 the geological 

cross-sections.  

The Chapter 2 is about the 1:25,000 geological cartography done, the methods and software 

used, the lithostratigraphic units recognized and the structural arrangement present in the area. 

It is reported in the manuscript denominated “Geological map of Itaiacoca Group and Bairro 

dos Prestes Formation, between Itapeva and Ribeirão Branco region (SE Brazil)”.  

The Chapter 3 includes the article “Ediacaran (570-615 Ma) back-arc basin basaltic volcanism 

in the Itaiacoca Group, Ribeira Belt, Brazil: a remnant of the Adamastor Ocean”. It deals with 

field, petrographic, geochemical and geochronological characterization of the Itaiacoca Group 

and Bairro dos Prestes Formation and the interpretation of their tectonic environment, 

depositional and volcanic ages.  

The Chapter 4 presents the quantification and characterization of SPO and LPO microstructure 

fabrics, the deformation temperatures calculated from LPO opening-angles and their 

comparison withstructural data measured in field and temperatures indicated by metamorphic 

mineral assemblages.  They are described in the article “Pure shear-dominated transpression in 

the southern Ribeira Belt, Brazil: finite strain and quartz c-axis fabric constraints from the 

Bairro dos Prestes Formation”. 

The chapter 5 corresponds to a short note of an Upper Neoproterozoic metarenite deposit 

located on the Apiaí-Guaçu river banks, in which the geochronologic data and petrographic 

description of the unit is stated.   

 

1.2 JUSTIFICATION AND OBJETIVES 

 

The Itaiacoca Group presents uncertainties in its stratigraphic organization, structural geology, 

age and sedimentation environment, which must be studied from local studies, that allow a 

better characterization of the units. With the current study, we intend: 

• Identify and describe macro and microscopically the lithostratigraphic units and 

structures present in the study area.

• Perform a microstructural analysis through the description and interpretation of 

deformation mechanisms and Shape Preferential Orientation (SPO) and Lattice 

Preferred Orientation (LPO) microstructures fabrics of the rocks.  

• Interpret the tectonic setting and melt sources of the metavolcanic rocks from 

geochemistry analyses in bulk rock and Sm and Nd isotopic system 

• Determine the age of the metasedimentary-metavolcanic rock successions using the U-

Pb method (SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS) in zircon.  

• Establish the regional geotectonic implications of the units through stratigraphic and 

geochronological correlations. 

 

1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION 
 

The study area is located in São Paulo state, approximately 240 km from the São Paulo city 

(Figure 1). Its limits are given by the UTM coordinates x=178,000–734,000 m and 

y=7,326,000-7,334,000 m (Universal Transverse Mercator projection, WGS 84 Horizontal 

Datum, 22S zone). It is covered by part of the Ribeirão Branco (22-X-B-II-1) and Guapiara (22-

X-B-II-2) 1:50,000 topographic sheets. 

   

1.4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

The methods used for the project development include geological mapping and sample 

collection, petrographic, whole rock geochemistry, Sm-Nd isotopic, U-Pb SHRIMP and LA-

ICP-MS geochronology in zircon analyzes, and structural microanalysis by SPO and LPO 

techniques.  

1.4.1 MAPPING AND PETROGRAPHY 

 

The cartography work was made in four steps of 25 days in total, in which 139 outcrop sites 

were registered with geological and structural information as well, photographic record and 

inventory of samples collected for posterior analyses. The field tracks were done preferably 

orthogonally to the regional structural trend but due the scarcity of outcrops in some areas all 

roads and paths were covered. In field, geometric and kinematic analyzes were performed on 

the structures when was possible, and for the collected samples (76 in total) mostly oriented, 



 

21 
 

their mineral composition, texture and structure were described. The procedure of map 

digitalization, which is based on the geological information taken in field is described in the 

chapter 2. 

The petrographic analyses were carried out through 65 thin sections, 31 of them oriented (cut 

parallel to the lineation and perpendicular to the cleavage plane), they were elaborated in the 

thin section laboratory of the Institute of Geosciences of the University of São Paulo (USP). 

The thin sections were observed through the Zeiss Axioplan El-Einsatz petrographic 

microscope of the microscopy laboratory for postgraduate student of the Institute of 

Geosciences, with the purpose of classify petrographically the rocks based on the mineral 

composition and describe textures, recrystallization mechanisms, microstructures and 

kinematic indicators present in the samples. 

1.4.2 WHOLE ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY  

 

The interpretation of rock petrogenesis were made using petrographic data and tools 

geochemistry as radiogenic and stable isotope compositions and major elements (reported in 

term of wt. % oxides) and trace concentrations, that, plotted in classification and discrimination 

diagrams, help to understand the compositional variation, origin, tectonic setting, geological 

variations record and evolution of igneous system (Best, 2003; Wilson, 2007).  

The chemical analyses of fourteen samples previously crushed and sprayed with an agate mill 

in the laboratory of samples preparation of the Institute of Geosciences (USP), and the analyses 

were performed at Activation Laboratories Ltda (Actlabs, Canada). The major and minor oxides 

were determinate by lithium metaborate/tetraborate fusion (ICP/WRA), in which the samples 

were mixture with lithium metaborate/ lithium tetraborate solution and subsequently fused in 

an induction furnace. The molten melt was aggregate in 5% nitric acid until obtained a 

homogeneous mixture, which through Thermo Jarrell-Ash ENVIRO II ICP or a Varian Vista 

735 ICP, the principal oxides were read. The trace elements were deduced by inductively 

coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For dilution process was used the same 

methodology for principal oxides, but they were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, 

6100 or 9000 ICP/MS. The detection limit of each element can be find in actlabs website.  

The analytical data were processed in the GCDkit program version 4.1 (Janousek et al., 2006, 

2011), in which molecular reason, binary plot, classification (Winchester and Floyd, 1977; 

A/CNK-A/NK; Irvine and Barragar, 1971 and Hastie et al.,2007), rare earth element 



 

22 
 

(normalized to chondrite) (Boynton, 1984), spidergrams (compared to MORB) (Sun and 

McDonough, 1989) and discrimination diagrams (Meschede, 1986; Pearce and Norry, 1979; 

Pearce, 2008; Pearce et al., 1984; Th/Hf – Ta/Hf plots of Schandl and Gorton, 2002 and Y-Nb-

3*Ga triangular diagrams of Eby, 1992) were generated. 

1.4.3 RADIOGENIC ISOTOPES Sm-Nd 

 

The unstable isotopes are excellent petrogenetic tracer given their contrast chemical behavior 

and mobility in the evolution of magma process, especially in mantle-basaltic systems, in which 

the most incompatible element is concentrated in partial melt and solidify in crust, while, the 

compatible remains in the magma source (Best, 2003). The Sm and Nd isotopes present similar 

ionic radii, characterizing a system immobile and resists to posterior alteration or hydrotermal 

events. The initial ratio (143Nd/144Nd)0, is used as petrogenetic indicator, it displays higher ratios 

in conditions with light REE-depleted and lower ratios in rocks present in the continental crust 

with low Sm/Nd ratios (Best, 2003). The 143Nd/144Nd can also be compared with CHUR 

(DePaolo and Wasserburg, 1976), through the ?Nd parameter, positive values indicate short-

lived juveniles sources, while negative valuesimply rocks produced by reworking of long-lived 

crustal materials (Wilson, 2007; Gladkochub et al., 2009). 

The fourteen samples for isotopic geochemistry Sm-Nd were crushed and sprayed with an agate 

mill in the laboratory of samples preparation of the IGc (USP), and they were analyzed at the 

CPGeo-USP, by a TRITON thermionization mass spectrometer. The Sm and Nd concentrations 

were obtained by isotopic dilution (Henderson and Pankhurst, 1984), based on the addition of 

an isotopic tracer with isotopic composition and concentration known that, mixture with amount 

of sample established, allow to calculate the element concentrations (Rollinson, 1993).  After 

mixing, the samples were leaching with nitric (HNO3) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids, the 

lanthanide elements were separated using ion exchange columns with RE and Ln Resins of 

EIChroM Industries, and the rations were reading by TRITON mass spectrometer (TIMS). The 

uncertainties for the 147Sm/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratios were less than ± 0.0014% (2?) and ± 

0.000013% (2?), respectively, based on repeated analyzes with international standards JNdi-1. 

1.4.4 GEOCHRONOLOGY U-Pb SHRIMP IN ZIRCON 

 

The chemistry characteristics of the zircon, make it resistant to magmatic, metamorphic and 

subsequent hydrothermal and erosional processes, in which the internal textures preserved 

reflect episodes of formation or consumption of zircon (Corfu, 2003). Generally, the uranium-



 

23 
 

bearing in the zircon is behaves as close geochemistry system, related with the different 

chemical behavior of U and Pb, this condition yields concordant ages and establishes that the 

Pb content measured is related with the radioactive decay of U, however, some zircon crystals 

generate discordant ages, due the Pb loss in the system (Misra, 2012). The U-Pb SHRIMP 

technique was used to determinate the crystallization age of mafic and acid samples, as well as 

the deposition age of metavolcanosedimentary rocks Four samples were prepared according to 

the procedure established in the Geochronology Research Center of the University of São Paulo 

(CPGeo-USP) in order to obtain the zircons from each sample. The methodology includes 

crushing with disk mill, sieving, hydraulic process with Wiffley table, removing of magnetic 

from nonmagnetic fraction using hand magnet and an electromagnetic device (FRANTZ) and 

density (bromoform-density=2.85 and metilene-density=3.32) separation. In the resulting 

fraction, the zircons were handpicking trying to catch all grains without preferential selection 

to certain typology. The select crystals were mounted in an epoxy disk and polished with 

diamond compound to show cross sections, subsequently, reflected and transmitted light images 

were taken. The epoxy disk was cover by gold and cathodoluminescence were acquired by FEI 

Quanta 250 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and XMAX CL detector (Oxford 

Instruments) (Sato et al., 2014).  

The data geochronology was measured in the Laboratory of High Resolution Geochronology 

of the Institute of Geoscienses of the University of São Paulo (GeoLab-IGc-USP) using the 

mass spectrometer model SHRIMP IIe/MC second generation with multicollector detector 

system with five multi-ion counting, one electron multiplier and one Faraday cup (Sato et al., 

2014). The acquisition of the U-Pb data in SHRIMP II was taken through 5 analytical cycles 

per crystal, with ?30 ?m diameter spot and 1 standard (Temora 2) to 4 zircon grains. The 

206Pb+/238U+ measured was adjusted with calibration line of know age (416.78 Ma for Temora 

2) (Black et al., 2004), and reduced with 207Pb and 208Pb corrections using SQUID 1.06 (Sato 

et al., 2014). The U-Pb SHRIMP data were processed in ISOPLOT 4 program (Ludwing, 2003).  

1.4.5 U-Pb LA-ICP-MS ANALYSIS IN ZIRCON  

 

The U-Pb geochronology was used for stablish the maximum deposition age of a metarenite 

sample, this method like the U-Pb SHRIMP is based on in the transformation of U into Pb by 

radioactive decay in the zircon crystal lattice. Detrital zircons were obtained after crushing and 

sieving one metarenite sample, the fractions retained were separated using heavy liquid and 

magnetic techniques. The zircons selected by handpicking were mounted in 2 cm diameter 

epoxy resin and polished to generated reflected and cathodoluminescense (CL) images in order 



 

24 
 

to know the internal complexities of the zircons and choose the better location for the analysis 

spot.  

The U-Pb LA-ICP-MS in zircon was performed at the Institute of Geosciences of the University 

of São Paulo, using Thermo-Fisher Neptune Laser-ablation multi-collector inductively coupled 

plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) equipped with a 193 nm ArF Photon laser system. 

The 29 µm-diameter spot, work with a frequency of 6 Hz and intensity of 6 µJ and. The ablated 

was carried by Ar (?0.7 L/min) and He (?0.6 L/min) in analyses of 60 cycles of 1 s (more 

details of the technique, can find in Sato et al., 2010). The 207Pb/206Pb ratio was used to 

normalize both the NIST and external standards. The GJ standard (602 ± 4.4 Ma; Elhlou et al., 

2006) was used following the routine of 2 blanks, 3 standards, 13 unknowns, 2 blanks and 2 

standards. The residual common Pb and instrumental discrimination were corrected using the 

known terrestrial composition (Stacey and Kramer, 1975) and the reference zircon standard 

(GJ-1) (Jackson et al., 2004), respectively. The data are portrayed in Concordia diagram 

generated in the ISOPLOT 4 program (Ludwing, 2003). 

1.4.6 SPO FABRIC 

 

The Shape Preferential Orientation (SPO) analyses were carried out in four samples with the 

purpose of characterize the planar and linear fabrics from directional (preferential orientation) 

and scalar (magnitude and shape) parameters; the methods used were: inertia tensor and the 

calculation of strain ellipsoid (3D) of three planes from quadratic shape tensor.  

• Inertia tensor 

The technique measures the shape ratio, r, and long-axis orientation, ?, of each individually 

digitized grain, with which the mean ratio, SRt, and average orientation, ?t, for the grain 

populations is calculated (Launeau and Cruden, 1998). The process is performed in raster 

images of thin sections or rock faces conformed by pixels of grains (j). The pixels have (xi) and 

(yi) coordinates and surface area (A), equivalent to the number of pixels. The inertia tensor (Mj) 

of shape is:

• Strain ellipsoid (3D) 

The method consists in established the best ellipsoid solution from sectional ellipses 

determinate in perpendicular sections or with random orientation (Robin, 2002). The technique 

was implement in the ELLIPSOID program (Launeau and Robin, 2003), in which each 

sectional ellipse and the ellipsoid solution are define as two-dimensional quadratic tensor and 

three-dimensional quadratic tensor, respectively, and the ellipsoid principal axes are 

determinate by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  

The two-dimensional quadratic tensor is calculated from the long (a) and short (b) axis 

magnitude and the long-axis orientation (?), measured in relation to the x direction in the xy 

plane:

1.4.7 QUARTZ C-AXIS FABRIC 

 

The Lattice Preferred Orientation (LPO) is related with the orientation of the crystallographic 

axes of the constituent minerals  (Passchier and Trouw, 2005).  In the universal stage optical 

microscopy accesory (U-Stage), the thin section is mounted between two glass hemispheres 

and is surrounded by external axes (N-S axis, inner ring axis, E-W axis). According with the 

methodology described by Santoro (1998), the thin section is rotated in a particular orientation 

with respect the external axes, until the orientation and inclination of c-axes are obtained. In 

seven samples (cut along XZ planes), recrystallized quartz c-axes were measured through 

universal stage of four-axis. The data taken (horizontalized or verticalized) were converted into 

standard annotations with north or south reference azimuth and subsequently projected by 

isofrequence curves in Stereo32 program version 1.0.3 (Röller and Trepmann, 2011), with the 

purpose of analyze the quartz c- axis patterns and measure the opening-angle.

CHAPTER 2 

Geological map of Itaiacoca Group and Bairro dos Prestes Formation, between Itapeva 

and Ribeirão Branco region (SE Brazil)1 
 

ABSTRACT 

We present a new 1:25,000-scale geological map from the region between Itapeva and Ribeirão 

Branco belonging to the Neoproterozoic Ribeira Belt in Southeast Brazil near the border of the 

Paleozoic Paraná sedimentary basin. The mapping was carried out through field geological 

methodologies, with the help of aerial photographs, digital elevation model and 

aerogeophysical survey data, as will the reinterpretation of former geological cartography. The 

cartographic products were prepared with GIS and assisted drawing software. Eleven 

lithostratigraphic units were identified: Quaternary alluvial deposits, Jurassic-Cretaceous basic 

dykes (associated with the Paraná-Etendeka volcanism), the Carboniferous-Permian Itararé 

Group (from the Paraná Sedimentary basin), a Late Ediacaran metasedimentary unity located 

on the eastern flank of the Apiaí-Guaçu river, the Neoproterozoic Ribeirão Grande Granite, 

three formations (Serra dos Macacos, Água Nova, Bairro dos Campos) and one magmatic suite 

(Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite Formation) from  the  Neoproterozoic Itaiacoca Group, the 

Statherian Bairro dos Prestes Formation and Apiaí Mirim Complex.  The Proterozoic units were 

affected by three folding phases and NE-SE and NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE strike-slip faults. 

This detailed cartography work, allowed to perform petrography, geochronology and 

geochemistry characterization of the lithostratigraphic units, useful information for the 

interpretation of the geotectonic context of the Ribeira belt, as well can be used for applied 

works.

2.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The mapping area is located in the south of Ribeira belt (Almeida et al., 1973; Hasui et al., 

1975) (Figure 2.1), a Neoproterozoic Pan African – Brasiliano orogen in the Southeast Brazil, 

affected by the extensional events of the Rodinia supercontinent and fusion of the Godwana 

Supercontinent (Brito Neves et al., 1999; Brito Neves, 2002; Cordani et al., 2003; Basei et al., 

2005; Silva et al., 2008). It belongs to the so called Apiaí terrane of the Ribeira belt (Campanha 

and Sadowski, 1999; Campos Neto, 2000). 

 

 

Figure 2. 1. Simplified geotectonic map of the Southwestern portion of the Ribeira Belt with location 

of study area Figure 2.2. (From Campanha et al., 2015) 

The area is situated in the border of the Paleozoic Paraná sedimentary basin, locally represented 

by the Itararé Group. It covers unconformably Proterozoic units comprising the Ediacaran 

Itaiacoca Group (Almeida, 1956; Forero-Ortega et al., 2018), the Statherian Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation (Forero-Ortega et al., 2018), and the Apiaí-Mirim Complex (Prazeres Filho, 2005; 

Siga Jr, 2010), as well an Ediacaran intrusive granite pluton (Ribeirão Branco granite), the 

Apiaí-Guaçu metasandstone, Mesozoic intrusive diabase dikes and Quaternary alluvial 

deposits.  

The Itaiacoca Group was defined originally by Almeida (1956) and has been studied by several 

authors as Petri and Suguio (1969), Chiodi Filho et al. (1983, 1984), Bistrichi et al. (1985), 

Trein et al. (1985), Soares (1987a, 1987b), Santoro and Frascá (1989), Souza (1990, 1992), 



 

29 
 

Gimenez Filho, (1993), Reis Neto (1994), Fassbinder (1996), Prazeres Filho et al. (1998), 

Sallun Filho (1999), Sallun Filho and Fairchild (2004, 2005) and Siga Jr. et al (2003, 2009). 

The Itaiacoca Group constitutes a narrow and long belt of folded and deformed 

metasedimentary rocks bounded to the east by the Itapirapuã Fault. Its structural framework is 

characterized for the most authors by three deformational events, the first created isoclinal and 

asymmetric folds, developing sub-parallel cleavage to the contacts and pelitic intercalations, 

the second generated isoclinal folds, with slaty and crenulation cleavage as axial planes, and 

the third event is responsible for the open regional folds and the steep dip of the mean foliation 

caused by the transcurrent fault (Takahashi et al., 1984; Soares, 1987a; Theodorovicz et al., 

1988; Lima, 1993b). 

Following the latest publications (e.g., Caltabellotta et al., 2016) we adopt here with 

modifications the stratigraphic scheme of Souza (1990, 1992) for the Neoproterozoic Itaiacoca 

Group, divided it in three formations: Serra dos Macacos, Bairro dos Campos and Água Nova. 

The Bairro da Estiva Formation (Souza, op.cit.) is not outcropping in the studied area. We 

defined the Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite, separated from the Água Nova Formation, due its 

extension and mappable character. The Bairro dos Prestes Formation, following an informal 

name of Theodorovicz et al., (1988), and due to recent geochronological data (Forero et al., 

2018), is defined here as a Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary-metavolcanic unit, detached from 

the Itaiacoca Group. 

Former semi-detailed geologic maps (1:50.000) encompassing the studied area were presented 

by Takahashi et al. (1984), Theodorovicz et al. (1986, 1988) and Vieira (2017). 

The objective of this paper is to present a detail cartography and description of the stratigraphy 

and structural geology of the area in order to contribute to the understanding of the geotectonic 

setting of these units and can be used for applied works.  

 

2.2 METHODS AND SOFTWARE     

 

We mapped an area of 128 Km2 at 1:25,000-scale, in the region between Itapeva and Ribeirão 

Branco, recording 134 outcrop sites with geological and structural information as well samples 

were collected for petrographic, microstructural, geochronological and geochemical analyzes. 

The field tracks were done preferably orthogonally to the regional structural trend but due the 

scarcity of outcrops in some areas all roads and paths were covered. The geological mapping 

and interpretation were assisted with 1:25,000 and 1:60.000 scale aerial photographs, former 

1:50.000 scale cartographic and geological maps, digital elevation model (STRM 1 Arc-second 



 

30 
 

global) and aerogeophysical (gamma and magnetometric) maps (CPRM, 2011). The former 

cartographic information was carried in the field with the mobile map app Avenza Maps® and 

outcrop positions and tracks recorded with a GPS Garmin.  

The Map digitalization was performed with the Esri ArcGIS 10.4 software, using an elevation 

model (STRM 1 Arc-second global, U.S. Geological Survey), as background and the hillshade 

tool for to highlight the structures. Maps, outcrop points and images were georeferenced to the 

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system (WGS 84 Horizontal Datum, 22S 

zone). The geological profiles were draw with the Corel Draw Graphics Suite X5, from the 

scaled vertical profiles generated in ArcGIS.  

The Geological map and cross-sections are available in the appendix 2 and 3. 

2.3 RESULTS 
 

2.3.1 Lithostratigraphic units  

 

In the study area eleven lithostratigraphic units were identified, according to their lithological, 

metamorphic, structural and chronological characteristics. They are: (1) Quaternary alluvial 

deposits, (2) Jurassic-Cretaceous basic dykes (associated with the Paraná-Etendeka volcanism), 

(3) the Carboniferous-Permian Itararé Group (from the Paraná Sedimentary basin), (4) a Late 

Ediacaran metasedimentary unity located on the eastern flank of the Apiaí-Guaçu river, (5) the 

Neoproterozoic Ribeirão Grande Granite, (6) three formations (Serra dos Macacos, Água Nova, 

Bairro dos Campos)  and one magmatic suite (Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite) from  the  

Neoproterozoic Itaiacoca Group, (7) the Statherian Bairro dos Prestes Formation and (8)  Apiaí 

Mirim Complex.   

2.3.1.1 Quaternary Alluvial Deposits 

 

The Quaternary alluvial deposits in the study area occur along the banks of the main rivers, 

forming terraces along the floodplains. They consist of unconsolidated sand banks, with 

variable granulometry, sometimes developing cross bedding. 

 

2.3.1.2 Jurassic-Cretaceous Diabase Dykes 

 

The Jurassic-Cretaceous basic dykes are related with the Paraná-Etendeka volcanism associated 

with the rifting and opening of Atlantic Ocean in the Mesozoic. They are present in the study 



 

31 
 

area as NW-SE dykes. They are comprised of medium to coarse-grained basic rocks, with 

subophitic textures, and composed of hornblende, plagioclase, quartz, potassic feldspar, biotite 

and aggregates of sericite and saussurite (Figure 2.2)  

 

Figure 2. 2. Thin-section of Jurassic-Cretaceous basic rock in cross-polarised light. 

2.3.1.3 Itararé Group: poorly selected fine-grained to conglomeratic sandstone and argillite. 

 

The Itararé Group maintain a flat but higher topography expression in the central-west part of 

the study area, resting in erosive discordance over the Proterozoic units. It is composed by 

argillites, yellow to reddish feldspathic and micaceous sandstones, varying from fine to very 

coarse grain (conglomeratic sandstone). The sedimentary rocks present primary structures as 

parallel and cross bedding (Figure 2.3a), ripple marks (Figure 2.3c), as well syn-sedimentary 

deformation structures (Figure 2.3b).

identify: (a) cross bedding of fine sandstone, (b) syn-sedimentary fold of the layers of reddish sandstone 

and (c) ripple marks developed in coarse sandstone.  

2.3.1.4 Apiaí-Guaçu Metasandstone 

 

This metasedimentary unit is present on the eastern flank of the Apiaí-Guaçu river. It is 

comprised of fine to coarse-grained feldspathic quartz metasandstones intercalated with small 

beds of mudstone. In the unit outcrops are also possible to recognize primary structures 

(bedding planes, Figure 2.4) and cleavage plane obliquely to them.

alternation of the laminations.  

2.3.1.5 Ribeirão Branco Granite: porphyritic monzogranite and subordinate sienogranite. 

 

Ribeirão Branco Granite is part of Três Córregos Granitic Suite (Caltabellotta, 2016). In the 

study area, it outcrops as sparse boulders and blocks, irregularly distributed. Microscopically, 

the granite has granoblastic and holocrystalline texture, consisting mainly of anhedral to 

subhedral crystals of quartz (Figure 2.5a-b), microcline, plagioclase, biotite, epidote, zircon (as 

accessory mineral) and aggregates of saussurite.

2.3.1.6 Itaiacoca Group 

 

2.3.1.6.1 Serra dos Macacos Formation: massive quartzites  

 

Included in the pelitic-chemical sequence of Theodorovicz et al. (1986), this unit has a strong 

topography expression in the northwest portion of the study area, around the Alta da Brancal 

village. The outcrops are comprised of massifs quartzites (Figure 2.6), heavily fractured. Based 

on observation in thin sections, Theodorovicz et al. (1986) describe that the massifs quartzites 

(metachert, in their work) are composed by fine quartz mass, with development of quartz 

venules, and small agglomerates of sericite distributed locally. The massif quartzite is in normal 

contact, overlapping the Bairro dos Campo metalimestone unit.

2.3.1.6.2 Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite: mainly metabasic rocks, with intercalations of 

metadolomites, talc schists and chlorite schists.  

 

This unit is comprised of significant amounts of metabasites, with intercalations of 

metadolomite, talc and chlorite schist and occasionally metarcoses. In the transitional contact 

with metapelites of Água Nova Formation presents steep dips and increment of the foliation 

intensity. The representative lithotypes of metamafic rocks are metabasalts and metagabbro 

with massive structure and green to dark green colors.

Figure 2. 7. Thin section of metabasic rock from Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite in which are possible 

to observe: reliquiar subophitic texture under plane-polarised (a) and cross-polarised light (b), 

pseudomorphs of with chemical zoning under plane-polarised (c) and cross-polarised light (d). 

Microscopically, the metabasites consist of augite, plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, quartz, 

saussurite aggregates, oxides (titanomagnetite, rutile and ilmenite) and opaque minerals. 

Pseudomorphs of chemically zoned pyroxene show core domains with higher content of Mg 

(pigeonite composition) that allows the formation of chlorite, and on the edges the higher Fe 

contents facilities the actinolite aggregates nucleating (Figure 2.7c-d). Generally, the 

plagioclase is affected by saussuritization process. These rocks also preserved reliquiar igneous 

textures (subophitic and ophitic textures) (Figure 2.7a-b). The metadolomites are formed by 

tiny grains of dolomite and talc, while the talc schists are developed mainly in the shear planes 

of the massive metabasites rock, formed from deformational and hydrotermal events, which 

facilitated the fluid circulation and mineral alteration. 

2.3.1.6.3 Água Nova Formation: metamudstone and phyllites intercalated with fine-grained 

quartzites 

 

The Água Nova Formation outcrops in the northwest sector of the map. It mainly consists of 

generally deeply weathered intercalations of white metamudstone and yellow phyllites, 



 

35 
 

sometimes displaying a parallel banding reflecting a compositional variation, as a relic bedding. 

Microscopically, the phyllites are comprised of anedric elongate quartz parallel to the main 

foliation, sericite, kaolinite and opaque minerals. Slaty cleavage and microfolds are common 

structures. This package presents a transitional contact with the metalimestones and metabasic 

sequences of Bairros dos Campos Formation and Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite Formation, 

and it is unconformatly overlain by the sedimentary rocks of the Itararé Group (Figure 2.8).  

 

Figure 2. 8. Outcrop of Água Nova Formation, phyllites overlained in a discordant contact by the flat 

sedimentary rocks of the Itararé Group. 

2.3.1.6.4 Bairro dos Campos Formation: calcitic and dolomitic metalimestones intercalated 

with phyllites and small beds of metatuff 

 

It is part of the pelitic-chemical unit of Theodorovicz et al. (1986), comprised of dark-gray 

calcitic and dolomitic metalimestones, in transition contact with phyllites and with small beds 

of white tuff. The calcitic metalimestones are quite clayey, interbanded, and sometimes folded, 

with layers of massive light gray dolomitic metalimestones and marls to the northeast. It is 

common to find stromatoliths (conophyton) and other nonconical branched forms (Marini and 

Bigarella, 1967; Sallun Filho 1999; Sallun Filho et al., 2005).  

Petrographically, the dolomitic metalimestones are composed of dolomite, quartz and 

occasionally talc, mica, chlorite and rutile, and the calcitic metalimestones are comprised of 

calcite, dolomite, quartz, mica, chlorite and talc (Frascá, 1992). A tuff sample presents flow 

texture with quartz, anhedral feldspar fragments, titanite (Figure 2.9).

2.3.1.7 Bairro dos Prestes Formation: phyllite sometimes with amygdaloidal structure and 

intercalations of fine-grained quartzite and restricted occurrences of metarhyodacite and 

metaconglomerate.  

 

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation is located at the east sector of the study area, characterized 

by a smooth and homogeneous topography. Here, we are giving the status of Formation to the 

informal name of Theodorovicz et al. (1988). It is composed by gray to green phyllites varying 

to red color according with the weathering degree, with interdigitated to transitional contacts 

with fine to medium grained quartzites and restricted occurrences of metarhyodacite and 

metaconglomerate. A fine foliation (slaty cleavage) is pervasive and crenulation cleavages are 

frequent, mainly in the phyllites.   

a.  b.  

Figure 2. 10. Photomicrographies in plane-polarised light of (a) quartz-biotite phyllite and (b) quartz-

feldspar-biotite phyllite, Bairro dos Prestes Formation.  

Petrographically, the phyllites are comprised of fine to very fine crystals of quartz, feldspar, 

biotite, muscovite and tourmaline, with rutile, zircon, apatite as accessories minerals support 



 

37 
 

by fine matrix of biotite and sericite, with lepidogranoblastic and amygdaloid textures. These 

textures allow to interpret at least part of the phyllites as volcanosedimentary rocks. The 

vacuoles are stretched parallel to the cleavage plane, being comprised of quartz, muscovite, 

biotite (Figure 2.10a) and oxides (Figure 2.10b).  

The quartzites have expressive outcrops (Figure 2.11) with high topographical expression along 

their distribution, forming open folds with NE-SW axial surface and are affected by NE-SW 

and NNW-SSE strike-slip faults. The quartzites present a varied granulometry, from 

conglomeratic to fine-grained, generally silicified with well-defined schistosity planes, in 

which chlorite schists are interdigitated due to the interaction with hydrothermal fluids.  

 

Figure 2. 11. Abandoned quartzite quarry, Bairro dos Prestes Formation. 

2.3.1.7.1 Metarhyodacite  

 

The metarhyodacite is present in the south center of the study area, as restricted rock bodies, 

showing a gradational contact with the adjacent phyllites. It presents resorption textures and is 

comprised of anhedral phenocrysts of quartz, potassic feldspar, plagioclase, biotite and 

muscovite set in a fine-grained matrix of quartz, biotite, white mica, K-feldspar and plagioclase. 

Zircon, ilmenite and rutile are the main accessory minerals (Figure 2.12a-b).

38 
 

2.3.1.7.2 Metaconglomerate 

 

The metaconglomerate presents interdigitated to erosive contact with the quartzites and 

phyllites. It is composed of volcanic (Fg. 13b), quartzite and black phyllite (Figure 2.12b) 

pebbles supported by a metamudstone matrix.  The volcanic pebbles show deformed amygdales 

filled by quartz, feldspar, muscovite and biotite, supported by fine-grained matrix of sericite, 

biotite and opaque minerals, classified as quartz-feldspar-biotite phyllite. Some black phyllite 

pebbles display an internal foliation discordant from the external foliation of the 

metaconglomerate matrix, suggesting an erosion of a phyllite source unit.

chaotic orientation of the black phyllites clasts and (b) metavolcanosedimentary pebbles. 

2.3.1.7.3 Apiaí Mirim Complex: paragneiss and micaceous quartzite 

The Apiaí-Mirim Complex occurs to the southeast of the study area. The predominant lithotypes 

are paragneiss and medium to coarse grained micaceous quartzite. Microscopically, the 

paragneiss has intercalations between the granoblastic and lepidoblastic textures (Figure 2.14a-

b), it is composed of quartz, potassic feldspar, microcline, plagioclase, biotite, sillimanite 

(fibrolite), muscovite, zircon and apatite as accessories minerals. The quartzites are comprised 

of quartz, feldspar and micas.

cross-polarised light. 

2.3.2 Structural geology 

 

The study area is mainly affected by NE axial-plane folds and strike-slip faults. In the east, also 

NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW faults are present. This structural arrangement implies in a 

complexity in the distribution, orientation and continuity of the rocky bodies. At the mesoscopic 

and microscopic level, relict structures (So) and three foliation planes (Sn, Sn+1 and Sn+2) were 

identified, as well stretching lineation, fold axes, small faults and folds. However, not all these 

structures are penetrative over the study area, especially in the metadolomite and metabasic 

rocks of the Itaiacoca Group, the deformational fabric is less intense due their rheological 

characteristics. While the deformation is more intense in the pelitic rocks and in the higher 

metamorphic grade rock of Apiaí-Mirim Complex.   

2.3.2.1 Meso and micro structural analysis 

 

The primary structures present in the Itaiacoca Group and Bairro dos Prestes Formation are the 

compositional banding in the metadolomites and metamudstone (Figure 2.15a) and laminations 

in phyllites rocks, which are interpreted as relic bedding (So). 

a.  

Figure 2. 15. Some of the sedimentary structures in Itaiacoca Group: (a) bedding in the metamudstone 

rock.  

 A main foliation Sn is developed often parallel to the compositional bands (granulometric and 

textural variations) and laminations, assigned to the deformational event Dn. In the lower 

metamorphic grade rocks of the Itaiacoca Group is characterized as a fine slaty cleavage, while 

in the Bairro dos Prestes Formation and in Apiaí-Mirim Complex are a schistosity recognized 

by the size increase of micaceous minerals.

Figure 2. 16. Stereographic projection of the poles concentration of Sn (Schmidt-Lambert projection 

lower hemisphere, mean plane in dip direction / dip). 

The principal foliation plane (Sn) has mainly steep dips and preferential NE-SW strikes (mean 

attitude N58°E/76°NW, Figure 2.16) defining the regional structural trend. It is also defined by 

the amygdales stretching in the metavolcanosedimentary rocks (Figure 2.19a), and by the 

preferred orientation of granoblastic crystals in quartzite (Figure 2.19b), metarhyodacite, and 

paragneiss rocks.  

 

Figure 2. 17. Stereographic projection of the poles concentration of Sn+1 (Schmidt-Lambert projection 

lower hemisphere, mean plane in dip direction / dip). 

The Sn+1 generated in the deformational event Dn+1, affects the Sn planes and created crenulation 

cleavages in metavolcanosedimentary and metapelitic rocks. It is associated with tight 

asymmetric folds (Fn+1) with inclined to subvertical (50-80°) NW axial-plane, development in 

the quartzite (Figure 2.19b-c), metavolcanosedimentary and metapelitic (Figure 2.19e) rocks. 

The Sn+1 are predominantly concentrate in the direction N41°W/63NE° (Figure 2.17).

The Sn+2 develops in the deformational event Dn+2, produces open overfolds (Fn+2) with inclined 

NE axial-plane in quartzite and phyllite rocks (Figure 2.19d, g). The Sn+2 are predominantly 

concentrate in the direction N17°E/83SE° (Figure 2.18).

and with a axial-plane Sn+1 and (f) open folds in pelitic sequence with axial plane Sn+2.  

2.3.2.2 Kinematic indicators 

 

The NNE-SSE and NNW-SSE faults are responsible for the lateral non-continuity of the rock 

bodies, mainly of the hills comprised of quartzite. Generally, the foliation dip and intensity 

increase near these faults, sometimes creating S-C structures in foliation planes and brittle 

deformation in quartz veins (Figure 2.20).

shear sense from kinematic indicators as the S-C structures and synthetic microfaults present in the

The kinematic indicators identified in thin sections subparallel to the XZ planes are: shear band 

type fragmented porphyroclasts (Passchier and Trouw, 2005; Figure 2.21a), S-C structures 

mainly C´-type shear bands (Figure 2.21b), ? and ? porphyroclasts (Passchier and Trouw, 2005) 

developed in quartz crystals (Figure 2.21c-d), and some crystal with lattice preferred 

orientation. They suggest dextral (Figure 2.21a-b) and sinistral shear (Figure 2.21c-d) sense for 

NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE faults, respectively, concordant with the field observations.

photographs, digital elevation models, aerogeophysical (magnetometric and gamaspectometric) 

maps and satellite images, as well the reinterpretation of previously published maps.  

The new 1:25,000 Geologic Map between Itapeva and Ribeirão Branco region (SP) displays 

eleven lithostratigraphic units: Quaternary Alluvial deposits, Mesozoic diabase dykes, 

sedimentary rocks of Paraná Basin (Itararé Group), Apiaí-Guaçu Metasandstone, Três Córregos

CHAPTER 3 

Ediacaran (570-615 Ma) back-arc basin basaltic volcanism in the Itaiacoca Group, 

Ribeira Belt, Brazil: a remnant of the Adamastor Ocean1 

 

ABSTRACT 

The Itaiacoca Group comprises a metasedimentary-metavolcanic rock succession considered a 

major constituent of the Apiaí Terrane (southern Ribeira Belt, Brazil), and was involved in the 

Brasiliano-Pan African Orogeny and Gondwana assembly. Geological data, including bodies 

of metabasalt covered by stromatolitic dolomite, suggest the existence of oceanic islands and 

associated shallow water deposits. Magmatic zircon grains extracted from samples of 

metabasalt and metatuff yield SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 571 ± 25 and 613 ± 10 Ma. Based on the 

chemical composition, the metabasites are classified as basalt and basaltic andesite of tholeiitic 

and calc-alkaline series. Trace element data indicate a geochemical signature transitional 

between MORB and island-arc basalts, a characteristic of back-arc basin basalts. These include 

flat to slightly fractionated REE patterns (Lacn/Ybcn of 0.9-1.9), Ti/V ratios of 16-27, depletion 

of HSFE and enrichment in LILE relative to MORB values. ?Nd(t) values from +2.3 to +3.2 

indicate a dominant juvenile mantle source. Overall geochemical patterns indicate a MORB-

type mantle source with contribution of the subduction components. Geological data allowed 

the recognition of a Statherian unit (Bairro dos Prestes Formation), previously interpreted as a 

part of the Itaiacoca Group. It comprises a succession of phyllite interbedded with layers of 

quartzite and restricted metaconglomerate and felsic metavolcanic rocks. Zircon SHRIMP U-

Pb data yield a Concordia age of 1761 ± 14 Ma for a metarhyodacite with high-K calc-alkaline 

signature, while detrital zircons from a metavolcanosedimentary sample give youngest age of 

~1800 Ma. Geological and geochronological data suggest that the Itaiacoca Group and Bairro 

dos Prestes Formation can be correlated with the Pirapora do Bom Jesus and Boturuna 

Formations of the São Roque Group. The Itaiacoca Group is inferred as a remnant of an arc–

back-arc basin system associated with the Adamastor Ocean, and an Ediacaran suture zone 

between the Apiaí Terrane and the Paranapanema Craton.

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Recent works have shown that the tectonic arrangement of the Ribeira Belt is complex, with 

juxtaposition of several distinct lithotectonic units including  Paleoproterozoic orthogneisses of 

varied geochemical signatures, sedimentary basins with depositional ages varying from the 

Statherian to the Ediacaran, and Tonian to Ediacaran magmatic rocks of arc and extensional 

settings, all affected by Ediacaran regional deformation and metamorphism and a late crustal-

scale transcurrent shear zone system (Soares, 1987; Reis Neto, 1994; Campanha and Sadowski, 

1999; Janasi et al., 2001; Prazeres Filho, 2005; Siga Jr et al., 2009, Faleiros et al., 2010, 2011a, 

2016; Salazar et al., 2013; Henrique-Pinto et al., 2015). The depositional environments of 

Neoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic successions are contentious, including 

aulacogen basin, passive margin continental platform, subduction setting, arc island, rifted 

continental margin, intra-arc basin, fore-arc and back-arc basin (Campanha, 1987; Campanha 

and Sadowski, 1999; Siga et al.,2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c; Faleiros et al., 2011b, 2016). 

Paleogeographic reconstructions are difficult due to the lack of continuity of units and the 

superimposed deformational and metamorphic events, and new geochronological and 

geochemical data are necessary to help to understand the Ribeira belt geological evolution. 

The Itaiacoca Group (Almeida, 1956) comprises a succession of metasedimentary and 

metavolcanic rocks that is considered a major constituent of the Apiaí Terrane in southern 

Ribeira Belt, south-southeastern Brazil. Its tectonic setting and depositional age has been 

subject of discussion. Geochronological data obtained in metacarbonatic and metavolcanic 

succession in the southwestern portion of the Itaiacoca Group (Siga Jr et al., 2003, 2010, 2011c; 

Siga Jr, 2009) define two lithotectonic units related with extensional (1030-900 Ma) and 

compressional (645-628 Ma) tectonic environments. On the other hand, Fairchild (1977) 

suggests from stromatolite structures, Neoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic ages for the 

deposition. The possible environment for the sedimentation of Itaiacoca Group has been 

inferred based on its sedimentary structures and petrographic character of its metavolcanics 

rocks, mainly contextualized in extensional settings (e.g. Petri and Suguio, 1969; Hasui et al., 

1984b; Chiodi Filho, 1983; Takahashi et al., 1984; Theodorovicz et al., 1988; Souza, 1990, 

1992; Campanha, 1991; Sallun Filho, 1999; Trein et al., 1985; Reis Neto, 1994), in which the 

magmatic rocks present tholeiitic, shoshonitic and calc-alkaline signatures (Theodorovicz et al., 

1986; Trein et al., 1985; Reis Neto, 1994).

We present a geochemical and geochronological characterization of metavolcanic rocks from 

the Itaiacoca Group on a key-area in its north-easternmost portion, through field geological 

mapping, U-Pb SHRIMP data in zircon, and elemental and Sm-Nd isotope geochemistry. The 

data are used to (1) determinate the depositional age of the Itaiacoca Group, (2) define the 

possible setting of rock deposition and emplacement and the regional correlation with other 

formations, (3) contribute to possible paleogeographic reconstructions for the Ribeira Belt with 

their implications to the assembly history of Gondwana.  

3.2 REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

The Ribeira Belt is constituted by allochthonous blocks of Archean to Paleoproterozoic 

basement rocks, Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks and granitoid 

plutonic rocks with sin to post-tectonic character agglutinated in the Brasiliano/Pan African 

Orogeny in the Neoproterozoic (e.g., Almeida et al., 1973; Hasui et al., 1975; Brito Neves et 

al., 1999; Campanha and Sadowski, 1999; Cordani et al., 2003; Heilbron et al., 2004; Campanha 

et al., 2015, 2016). Its late evolution was tectonically controlled by strike-slip shear zones 

(Campanha, 2002; Siga Jr, 2010; Faleiros et al., 2010, 2011b, 2016). The southwestern portion 

of this NE-trending belt subparallel to the southeastern coast of Brazil is divided by the 

Lanchinha-Cubatão fault zone in two main domains: the Curitiba and Apiaí terranes (Figure 

3.1).   

 

Figure 3. 1. Simplified geotectonic map of the Southwestern portion of the Ribeira Belt with location 

of study area Figure 3.2. (From Campanha et al., 2015). 



 

48 
 

The Apiaí Terrane is a composite terrane inferred as formed by the collage of units of very 

distinct ages and tectonic settings, including remnants of continental passive margins, 

carbonatic platforms, flysh-type deposits, ocean floor, island arc, back-arc, intra-arc and 

subduction zone rocks, which were juxtaposed by the deformation caused by shear zones 

(Heilbron et al., 2004; Campanha and Faleiros, 2005; Faleiros, 2008; Faleiros et al., 2011b), 

created sigmoidal lenses and displacement and rupture of the stratigraphic units, hindering their 

lateral correlations (Faleiros, 2008). Restricted basement orthogneisses present in the Apiaí 

Terrane are records of magmatic events occurred in the Statherian (1800-1750 Ma; Kaulfuss, 

2001; Cury et al., 2002; Prazeres Filho, 2005;), while metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock 

associations primarily belong to Calymmian units (1600-1450 Ma; Weber et al., 2003; Basei et 

al., 2008; Campanha et al., 2008a; Siga Jr et al., 2011a, 2011b; Campanha et al., 2015a, 2015b). 

Compressional regime (sedimentation in restricted basins) are registered in the Tonian (1000-

900) and Ediacaran (630-573 Ma) (Campanha et al., 2008; Siga Jr et al., 2009). During the 

Ediacaran, the Apiaí and Curitiba terranes were also intruded by extensive bodies of arc-related 

magmatic rocks as the granitoid suites Cunhaporanga, Três Córregos and Agudos Grandes 

(Gimenez Filho, 1993; Gimenez Filho et al., 1995; Reis Neto, 1994; Campanha and Sadowski, 

1999; Janasi et al., 2001; Prazeres Filho, 2005). 

3.2.1 The Itaiacoca Group 

 

The Itaiacoca Group (Figure 3.1) was initially defined by Almeida (1956), and it would be part, 

according to different authors of the Açungui Group (Hasui et al. 1984; Bistrichi 1985), Itapeva 

belt (Hasui et al., 1984a), Itaiacoca-Itapeva belt (Chiodi Filho, 1983, 1984) or the Itaiacoca belt 

(Reis Neto, 1994; Siga Jr et al., 2009). The Itaiacoca belt (sensu lato) is composed of 

Proterozoic rocks oriented in NE-SW-trend, located between the Cunhaporanga and Três 

Córregos granitic batholiths from Ponta Grossa city (Paraná State) to Itapeva city (São Paulo 

State). Geological mapping works performed at regional to semi-detailed scales (Chiodi, 1983, 

1984; Takahashi et al., 1984; Bistrichi, 1985; Trein et al., 1985; Theodorovicz et al 1986, 1988; 

Soares, 1987a, 1987b; Santoro and frascá, 1989; Souza, 1990, 1992; Reis Neto, 1994; Prazeres 

Filho et al., 1998; Campanha and Sadowski, 1999, Siga Jr 2010) used different nomenclatures 

the formations that make up the Itaiacoca Group. We assume with some modifications the 

stratigraphic scheme of Souza (1990, 1992) for the division of Itaiacoca Group. He identified 

four formations: Serra dos Macacos, Bairro dos Campos, Água Nova and Bairro da Estiva, the 

last is not present in the studied area. 



 

49 
 

The deposition of the Itaiacoca Group has been interpreted as related with different tectonic 

settings, including deposits of tidal plain environment close to the coast (Petri and Suguio, 

1969), grabens and rifts with formation of elongated and restricted basins (Hasui et al., 1984b, 

1986), aulacogen basins (Chiodi Filho, 1983, 1984), continental shelf developed in a rifted 

continental margin basin (Takahashi et al., 1984, Theodorovicz et al., 1988; Souza, 1990, 1992; 

Campanha, 1991; Frascá, 1992; Sallun Filho, 1999), sedimentation in a relatively deep 

depositional setting, sub-coast and below fair-weather wave base (Sallun Filho and Fairchild, 

2000, 2004, 2005), intra arc basin (Soares, 1987a, 1987b), Andean type (Campanha et al., 1987) 

and B type subduction settings (Theodorovicz and Câmara, 1988), delta systems (Trein et al., 

1985), arc island (Campanha, 2002) and passive margin developed on a stable region (Reis 

Neto, 1994; Campanha and Sadowski, 1999).  

The Itaiacoca Group was affected by a greenschist facies regional metamorphism (Trein et al., 

1985; Campanha et al., 1987; Soares, 1987a, 1987b; Souza, 1990; Reis Neto, 1994). In addition, 

the occurrence of talc and serpentine bands in dolomites suggests metasomatic events 

associated with the intrusion of Mesozoic diabase dykes (Souza, 1990; Frascá, 1992; Reis Neto, 

1994; Szabó et al., 2006; Andrade, 2008) or regional fault-related fluid circulation (Saunite et 

al., 2011).  

Geochemical data of the igneous rocks (basic volcanic, ultrabasic and subvolcanic felsic rocks) 

of the Itaiacoca Group reveal bimodal (Takahashi et al., 1984; Theodorovicz et al., 1988), 

tholeiitic, calc-alkaline and shoshonitic signature components (Trein et al., 1985; Theodorovicz 

et al., 1986; Reis Neto, 1994).  

Age data for Itaiacoca Group rocks are scarce and ambiguous. Almeida (1956) and Fairchild 

(1977) recognized Conophyton garganicum type stromatolites, suggesting Tonian to Statherian 

ages (between 850 to 1700 Ma) for the Itaiacoca Group. Metabasite and marble samples from 

the Abapã and Bairro dos Campos formations gave imprecise Pb-Pb, Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd average 

ages within the interval 1250-1080 Ma (Reis Neto, 1994). Zircon U-Pb data yield ages of 1030-

900 Ma for metabasites from the Bairro dos Campos Formation and 645-628 Ma for 

metarhyolites from the Abapã Formation (Siga Jr et al., 2009).

3.2.2 Local Geology  

 

3.2.2.1 Itaiacoca Group 

 

The Itaiacoca Group in the studied area (Figure 3.2) consists in a succession of metamudstone, 

phyllites and fine-grained quartzites (Água Nova Formation), intercalated with calcitic and 

dolomitic metalimestone with stromatolite structures and small beds of metatuff (Bairro dos 

Campos Formation) in transition contact with mainly metabasites, metadolomites,  talc schists 

and chlorite schists (Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite), and massive quartzites (Serra dos 

Macacos Formation) overlapping all the units 

The Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite, definition proposed here, is composed of metabasalts and 

metagabbro with green to dark green colors. These rocks preserve reliquiar igneous textures 

(subophitic and ophitic textures), and are composed of augite, plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, 

quartz, carbonates, sericite-epidote aggregates, oxides (titanomagnetite, rutile and ilmenite) and 

other minor opaque minerals. Pseudomorphs of chemically zoned pyroxene were replaced by 

chlorite aggregates in core domains, reflecting higher content of Mg (pigeonite), and actinolite 

aggregates on the edges (augite) (Figure 3.3b).

textures of the metatuff rocks and (b) metabasite sample showing pseudomorphs of pyroxene. 

A metatuff sample was collected at the Água Nova and Bairro dos Campos formations contact. 

Petrographically, it displays flow texture (Figure 3.3a) with anedric quartz grains, irregular 

feldspar fragments and titanite, supported by a fine-grained matrix of epidote, chlorite, sericite 

and opaque minerals.

3.2.2.2 Bairro dos Prestes Formation  

 

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation was previously considered as an undivided part of the 

Itaiacoca Group (Takahashi et al., 1984; Theodorovicz et al., 1988), but geological and 

geochronological (see below) data obtained here supports their dismemberment. The Bairro dos 

Prestes Formation is composed of phyllites in transitional contact with fine to medium-grained 

quartzites, with restricted outcrops of metarhyodacite and metaconglomerate.  

The phyllites present lepidoblastic textures and are composed of varied amounts of muscovite, 

biotite, quartz and feldspar, with accessory tourmaline, rutile, zircon and apatite. A slaty 

cleavage is pervasive over the whole unit and was heterogeneously superposed by a crenulation 

cleavage associated with open to tight folds. Amygdaloidal textures are locally preserved 

(Figure 3.4a), suggesting a volcanogenic origin for at least for part of the unit.  

The quartzites are composed of quartz with minor plagioclase, muscovite, microcline and 

biotite contents. 

a.  b.  

Figure 3. 4. Thin sections of phyllite exhibit (a) millimetric vacuoles and (b) metarhyodacite sample 

(under plane-polarised light). 

A metarhyodacite outcrop was observed as a restricted rock bodies but similar occurrences were 

also described by Theodorovicz et al. (1988). The rock is heterogeneously foliated, with 

porphyritic to porphyroclastic texture, and is in a concordant contact with phyllites keeping the 

foliation constant across the contact. Microscopically, the metarhyodacite show resorption and 

porphyroclastic structures, with phenocrystals of quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase (Figure 

3.4b) set in a fine-grained matrix of quartz, biotite, white mica, chlorite and titanite. Zircon, 

ilmenite and rutile are the main accessory minerals.  

A metaconglomerate outcrop was observed exhibiting interdigitated contact with quartzite and 

phyllite intercalations. The metaconglomerate is composed of quartzite, volcanic and phyllite 



 

53 
 

pebbles supported by a metapelitic matrix. The volcanic pebbles show deformed amygdales 

filled by quartz, feldspar, muscovite and biotite, supported by fine-grained matrix of sericite, 

biotite and opaque minerals, classified as quartz-feldspar-biotite phyllite. Some black phyllite 

pebbles show an internal foliation discordant from the external foliation of the 

metaconglomerate matrix, suggesting an erosion of a former and older phyllite source unit.

3.3 ANALYTICAL METHODS     
 

Geochemical analyses were done to determinate the major and trace elements concentrations 

including rare earth elements (REEs) of 13 metabasite samples of the Itaiacoca Group and a 

metarhyodacite sample of the Bairro dos Prestes Formation (Table 3.1 and 3.2); they were 

carried out at Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs, Canada), using lithium 

metaborate/tetraborate fusion (ICP/WRA) for major and minor oxides, and inductively coupled 

plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for trace elements. Most geochemical diagrams were 

made using the GCDkit program version 4.1 (Janousek et al., 2006, 2011).  

Sm and Nd concentrations and Sm-Nd isotopic rations of 13 metabasite and a metarhyodacite 

sample (Table 3.3) measured by isotope dilution were performed at the Geochronology 

Research Center of the University of São Paulo (CPGeo-USP), using a TRITON multi-collector 

mass spectrometer; details of the analytical procedures are described in Sato et al. (1995) and 



 

54 
 

Petronilho (2009). The 143Nd / 144Nd values were normalized with 146Nd / 144Nd = 0.7219 (De 

Paolo, 1981), and for ?Nd(0)  and fSm / Nd parameters were used 143Nd / 144Nd CHUR = 0.512638 

(Hamilton et al., 1983) and 147Sm / 144NdCHUR = 0.1967 (Hamilton et al.1983), respectively. 

Calibration of replicate analyses was done with Jndi-1 standard (Tanaka et al., 2000).

Metabasic Suite of the Itaiacoca Group. In red, the CA1 sample. 

The zircons grains were analyzed by U-Pb SHRIMP method. They were separated from 100-

200-mesh fractions following the standards and techniques developed at the CPGeo-USP, 

which included granulometric reduction, Wiffley table, electromagnetic (FRANTZ) and density 

(bromoform and methylene iodide dense liquids) separation. Zircon grains preferably without 

fractures and physical characteristics evidencing Pb loss were hand-picked using a binocular 

microscope, and subsequently set with the TEMORA 2 standard in a circular epoxy resin 

mount, to be polished exposing crystals half-sections. Reflected light and cathodoluminescence 

(CL) imagens were acquired in order to choose the most suitable position of the zircon (no 

inclusions or metamict domains) for the U-Pb isotopic analysis.

University of São Paulo, using a spot size ?25 ?m. The 206Pb/238U ratios were calibrated with 

the Temora 2 standard (concordant 416.78 Ma; Black et al., 2004), and for the common 206Pb 

correction was using the Stacey and Kramers (1975) procedure based on 204Pb measured. The 

graphic representation and the age calculation was generated with ISOPLOT 4 program 

(Ludwing, 2009).

3.4 RESULTS 
 

3.4.1 Element mobility  

 

The mineral assemblage composed of actinolite, chlorite and epidote suggests that the 

metabasic rocks were affected by a greenschists facies metamorphism. The presence of 

carbonate, quartz and epidote veins in some samples is evidence of superimposed hydrothermal

events, which could have favored the formation and mobilization of ionic complexes 

(Rollinson, 1993; Pearce, 1996). For this reason, it is necessary to test the elements mobility, 

that may be estimate through diagrams of molecular ratios (Pearce, 1968; Beswick and Soucie, 

1978 and Beswick, 1982) and binary plots (Cann, 1970).

The dispersion of points and their tendency through the origin on the molecular ratios diagrams 

(Figure 3.5) as the no linear correlation in the binary plots (Figure 3.6), reflect the mobility of 

the oxides and some large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) (e.g., Rb and Sr) in the samples during 

the metamorphism and hydrothermal events. While the linear trend of Th, U, REE and HFSE 

elements on binary diagram, indicates that these elements are immobiles and the original 

chemicals characteristics of protolith are mostly preserved. Sample CA1 was disregarded from 

interpretations because of petrographic and chemical evidence of strong metasomatism.

3.4.2 Whole rock geochemistry 

 

For the classification (rock type and volcanic series) of metabasites samples we compared the 

classical diagrams (Nb/Y-Zr/TiO2 and AFM plots; the TAS diagram is not use since the oxides 

correspond to the most mobile elements in the samples) with diagrams that employ immobile 

elements as the Co-Th plot of Hastie et al. (2007), created for the classification of altered, 

weathered and metamorphosed volcanic rocks. The metabasites exhibited tholeiitic and calc-

alkaline signatures (Figure 3.7b-c), classified as basalt and basaltic andesite (Figure 3.7a).  

The REE concentrations of the metabasites are 10 to 12 times as chondrite values, with weak 

depletion to moderate enrichment of the LREE with respect to HREE (Figure 3.8a), as indicated 

in the (La/Yb)cn values from 0.9 to 1.9. The depletion of HREE together with the negative 

anomaly of Zr indicate that the garnet is responsible for the chemical response of these elements 

(Hanchar and Westrenen, 2007), implying the presence of this mineral as residual phase in the 

source (Haskins and Paster, 1984; Wilson, 2007; Jayananda 2013). Most samples present weak 

negative anomalies of Ce and positive anomalies de Eu, which can be related with weak 

metasomatic effects caused by hydrothermal solutions and crystallization of abundant epidote 

(Dudás et al., 1983 in Shikazono, 2003). These oxidized hydrothermal fluids are responsible 

for the solubility of Ce4+ and its incorporation in the oxides and hydroxides of Mn (Courtois 

and Clauer, 1980; Mahoney et al., 2008), while the Eu was probably absorbed by the rocks 

through interactions with hydrothermal solutions.  

In the MORB-normalized diagram (Figure 3.8b), the metabasites exhibit weak to strong 

enrichment in LILE and weak to moderate depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE), 

with (Nb/Yb)mn of 1.2-2.3 and (Th/Yb)mn ratios of 2.3-7.8 and Nb/Nb* values from 0.2-2.4. 

The enrichment and anomalies of LILE can be modified due to the alterations and 

transformations that the rock suffered, the negative anomalies of Ti, Nb, Zr and Hf are 

controlled by the fractionation of minerals as titanite, rutile, ilmenite and sometimes amphiboles 

(Keshavarzi et al., 2014). Petrogenetic evidence, theoretical and experimental data indicate that 

P negative anomalies can be produced by a strong garnet fractionation or by partial melt of 

source with residual garnet, which is the mineral with higher concentration of P in the mantle 

(McCuaig, 1994).

metarhyodacite of Bairro dos Prestes Formation. Normalizing values with respect to Boynton (1984) for 

chondrite and Sun and McDonough (1989) for MORB 

Sample CA39 of the Bairro dos Prestes Formation presents high-K calc-alkaline signatures 

(Figure 3.7b-c) and is classified as rhyodacite (Figure 3.7a). According to the alumina saturation 

(Figure 3.7d) the rock shows a metaluminous character. The REE concentration is 30-400 times 

more enriched than chondrite values (Figure 3.8a), with a strong enrichment of LREE relative 

to HREE with (La/Yb)cn of 11.6. Sample CA39 presents negative Ti, P, Sr, Eu, Zr, Nb and Ta 

anomalies (Figure 3.7b). The negative Eu and Sr anomalies are attributed to the fractionation 

of feldspar during magma crystallization, while the negative Ti, Zr and P anomalies probably 

indicate fractionation of iron-titanium oxide, zircon and apatite (Wilson, 2007; Keshavarzi et 

al., 2014). Enrichment of Ta relative to Nb, and Zr/Hf (32.3) and Nb/Ta (12.9) ratios suggest 

that fractional crystallization, crustal melting and subduction zone magmatism could have 

controlled the origin of the metarhyodacite sample (Wilson, 2007; Green, 1995; Aliani et al., 

2012; Dostal and Chatterjee, 2000).

3.4.3 Sm-Nd radiogenic isotopes  

 

The metamafic rocks (Tables 3.2 and 3.3) present Sm and Nd content ranged from 1.2 to 3.6 

ppm and 4.0 to 11.2 ppm, respectively. The isotopic rations 147Sm / 144Nd vary between 0.1741 

and 0.1927, and 143Nd / 144Nd between 0.512697 and 0.512788. The ?Nd(0) (+1.16 - +2.97) and 

?Nd(t) (+2.2 - +3.2) values implying that the basaltic magmas were derived from a common 

relative juvenile magma source. The calculated TDM model ages are between 1300 and 1928 

Ma (average of 1608 Ma).  

The metarhyodacite (Table 3.2 and 3.3) display Sm and Nd content of 15.4-16.1 and 82.4-94.6 

ppm, respectively, the isotopic rations are: 0.1030l of 147Sm / 144Nd and 0.511210 of 143Nd / 

144Nd. The negative ?Nd(0) (-27.86) and ?Nd(t) (-6.8) values implying older subcontinental mantle 

components, possibly of Archean age (TDM model age calculated is 2537 Ma). 

For the mebasites samples of the Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite is also calculated Sm-Nd, 

isochrone with 621±240 Ma and MSWD of 5.3 (Figure 3.9).

3.4.4 U-Pb Geochronology data 

 

The U-Pb analyzes were made in five samples, including two metabasites from the Fazenda 

Velha Suite (F135 and P13), a metatuff from the Bairro dos Campos Formation (CA13) of the 

Itaiacoca Group, a metavolcanosedimentary rock (CA38) and metarhyodacite (CA39) of the 

Bairro dos Prestes Formation. The ages were calculated with SHRIMP data with less than 10% 

discordance (&amp;lt;100 ± 10%) and lower common Pb contents (&lt;5%).The metabasic samples 

(F135 and P13) are dark green metagabbros with coarse grained and reliquiar igneous textures 

(subophitic textures). Due to small amount of zircon crystals that crystallized in the metabasic 

rocks, 20 Kg of each sample was collected and processed. 

Anhedral to subhedral (subrounded) zircon grains were obtained from metabasite F135 sample, 

which can be divided in three subgroups classified according with the morphology and internal 

structure. The first subgroup appears dark and poorly zoned in CL images (4.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 

12.1 and 13.1 zircons). The second subgroup includes clear crystals with weak zonation (5.1, 

6.1, 7.1-7.2 and 8.1 grains), and the third subgroup presents crystals with partially absorbed 

nuclei and dark and poorly zoned overgrowth edges (1.1-1.2, 3.1-3.2 zircons. All SHRIMP U-

Pb spots analyses display low content of common Pb (&lt;2 %) and low (&gt;0.1 and&amp;lt;1.0) Th/U 

ratios. Thirteen U-Pb spot analyses yield concordant apparent ages distributed in the intervals 

of 1880-2100, ~1360, 710-730, 550-610 and 480-490 Ma (Figures 3.10a and 3.11a, Table S1).

(MSWD = 0.0048) inferred as the best estimation for the igneous crystallization. Based on 

internal zircon textures and U-Pb spot analyses the three oldest age populations are inferred as 

inherited zircon grains, while the youngest zircon population with Concordia age of 486 ± 9 

Ma (Figure 3.11a) are interpreted as evidence of a late hydrothermal event.  



 

69 
 

The metabasite P13 sample present zircons with anhedral habit generally round, with 

homogeneous dark zoning (2.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 9.1 and 10.1 grains), sometimes developing weak 

oscillatory zoning (1.1-1.2, 3.1, 4.1, 8.1 and 11.1 zircons). The SHRIMP analyses have low 

(&gt;0.1 and&amp;lt;1.0) Th/U ratios. Sixteen U-Pb ages yield concordant ages with populations at 3300, 

2000-2200, 1500-1600 and 900-1300 Ma (Figures 3.10b and 3.11b, Table S2). A single grain 

(spot 1.1) give an age of ~900 Ma, considered as the youngest detritical zircon obtained.  

The zircon grains from CA13 metatuff sample are subhedral (subrounded), with equant to 

prismatic habit and oscillatory compositional zoning (Figure 3.10d), the zircons 2.1 and 9.1 

present discontinuity in the original zoning, which are succeeded by newgrowth zoned, 

reflected intervals of Zr undersaturation conditions (Corfu, 2003). The SHRIMP analyses 

(Table S3), show low content of common Pb (&lt;2 %), and low (&gt;0.1 and&amp;lt;1.0) Th/U ratios. Eight 

U-Pb analyses yield concordant apparent age within the main intervals of 2110, 1269 and 560-

720 Ma ((Figures 3.10d and 3.11c, Table S3). Four analyses of the main zircon population give 

a concordia age of 613.5 ± 9.6 Ma with MSWD of 0.055 (Figure 3.11c), inferred as inherited 

zircon grains.   

The subhedral zircon grains acquired from metavulcanosedimentary sample (CA38) have 

prismatic to equant habit and oscillatory compositional zoning characteristic of igneous growth 

(Figure 3.10c), with low Th/U ratios (&gt;0.1 and&amp;lt;1.0) are also compatible with an igneous origin 

(Table S4). But the generally subrounded shapes are typical for detrital grains. Most of the 

grains showed discordant ages. Among the concordant results, two grains gave a 1750-1850 

Ma age and four zircons a ~2100-2180 Ma (Figure 3.11d). These results suggest a 1800-1850 

Ma maximum sedimentation age. 

The zircon crystals from metarhyodacite CA39 are subhedral to euhedral, with prismatic to 

fragment habit and oscillatory compositional zoning characteristic of igneous growth, the 1.1, 

2.1, 3.1 and 10.1 zircons (Figure 3.10e) display two growth zones, one discontinued and 

surrounded by newgrowth zoned, reflecting different conditions of Zr undersaturation (Corfu, 

2003). The spots of SHRIMP analyses (Table S5), show low content of common Pb (&lt;3 %), 

and low Th/U ratios (&gt;0.1 and&amp;lt;1.0), indicating equilibrium crystallization of the zircon crystals 

with the acid magma. Seven concordant U-Pb spot analyses yield a Concordia age of 1761 ± 

14 Ma with MSWD of 2.5 (Figure 3.11e).

3.5 DISCUSSION 
 

3.5.1 Tectonic setting of basic magmatism 

 

The metamafic rocks exhibit a tholeiite to calc-alkaline basic compositional trend, and due to 

the mobility of most LILE elements, their tectonic context and interpretation are deduced from 

the immobiles elements. The overall geochemical data suggest that the origin of the Itaiacoca 

Group metabasites is related with a Mid-Ocean Ridge environment with island-arc basalts 

components. Other characteristics that support this hypothesis are (following Pearce and Norry, 

1979; Pearce and Peate, 1995; Chengli et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2001; Pearce, 2008): (1) In 

the spidergrams the metabasic rock are enriched in LILE (e.g., Th, Ce, Rb, Pb and Ba) and 

depleted in HSFE (e.g., Zr, Hf, Y, Ti and Yb) elements relative to normal MORB rocks, 

characteristics in magmas formed by contribution of subduction zone components; (2) The REE 

patterns in diagram chondrite-normalized did no present Eu negative anomaly; (3) The 

(Tb/Yb)cn ratios between 1.1-1.4 indicated a moderate depletion in HREE and the presence of 

garnet as residual phase in the source; (4) The La/Nb (1.0-2.2) and Ce/Nb (2.3-4.9) ratios 

indicating MORB depleted mantle with back-arc basalts characteristics; (5)  weak to moderate 

Nb-Ta negative anomalies (Figure 3.8b) corroborate subduction-related contamination; (6) The 

high Th/Ta (between 0.7-2.5) values and the Th/Yb ratio (Figure 3.12c) indicate MORB-type 

mantle sources with heterogeneous contribution of subduction zone components; (7) the Ti and 

V contents (Figure 3.12d) are typical of both arc tholeiite and MORB and BABB environments; 

(8) the lower Zr and slightly lower Zr/Y ratio (Figure 3.12b) suggest magmas derived of 

depleted source with partial melting, typical of basalt in Island arc and Mid-Ocean Ridges 

environments.

V(ppm)/Ti(ppm) plot (Shervais, 1982). In red, the CA1 sample. 

The geochemical characteristic of the Itaiacoca Group metabasites are similar to the rocks found 

in Phanerozoic back-arc basin settings (e.g., Gill, 1976; Hawkesworth et al., 1977; Saunders 

and Tarney, 1984; Pearce, 1982; Pearce and Stern, 2006; Saunders and Tarney, 1984), which 

present MORB-type signatures with superimposed arc-type signatures, originated from 

depleted garnet lherzolite mantle with slight enrichment in LILE elements relative to HFSE 

elements and low Ta and Nb contents (Saunders and Tarney, 1984; Pearce and Stern, 2006; 

Helbig et al., 2013).

3*Ga triangular diagrams of Eby (1992). 

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation metarhyodacite sample shows chemical characteristics of 

intrusions derived from continental crust with subduction magmatism components (Figure 

3.13). In the REE and multielement diagram (Figure 3.8), the metarhyodacite presents 

characteristics of High-K calc-alkaline granites, which be associated with magmatic arcs that 

could be formed in accretion, collisional and postcollisional stages. Its geochemical pattern is 



 

72 
 

also similar with the Três Córregos Granitic Suite, interpreted as continental magmatic arc 

(Gimenez Filho, 1993; Gimenez Filho et al., 1995; Prazeres Filho et al., 2003; Prazeres Filho, 

2005).

3.5.2 Melt sources 

 

The Itaiacoca Group metabasite samples present Sm/Nd ratios typical of basalts (&amp;lt;0.32) (Faure, 

1986). The 143Nd / 144Nd ratios moderately higher than CHUR (DePaolo, 1988) and positive 

?Nd(0) and ?Nd(t) values suggest that the  protoliths of the metabasites rocks were derived from a 

slightly depleted magma source (DePaolo and Wasserburg, 1976; Faure, 1986; DePaolo, 1988; 

Faure, 2001; Wilson 2007) with LREE enrichment relative to CHUR (Figure 3.14), or generated 

from a reworked of Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic mafic protolith (average TDM model 

age of 1608Ma).  

The ?Nd(0) values are concordant with the results obtained in analyses performed in basalts of 

back arc environments in which juvenile magma is generated with the progressive development 

of the basin (e.g., Ohki et al., 1994; Helbig et al., 2013). 

The 143Nd / 144Nd ratio of the Bairro dos Prestes metarhyodacite is lesser that the CHUR, and 

the negative ?Nd(0)  and ?Nd(t) values indicate that the protolith of the sample was originated with 

contribution from crustal material fusion (Faure, 1986), possibly Neoarchean, as it is suggested 

by the TDM model age (2537 Ma). 

 

 



 

73 
 

3.5.3 Ages of igneous crystallization, depositional and hydrothermal events 

 

The zircons of F135 and P13 samples generally are xenomorphic, unzoned or poorly zoned, 

typical of crystals development in late crystallization, a common pattern described in zircon 

grains from mafic rocks (e.g., Weber, 2004; Oliveira et al., 2008; Siga Jr et al., 2011; Campanha 

et al., 2015), although some crystals of sample P13 present rounded habits characteristic of 

detrital grains. Zircons of sample CA13 present prismatic habit with well-developed oscillatory 

zoning.   

Two concordia ages were calculated for the F135 metabasic sample, one interpreted as the best 

estimative for the age of emplacement of the basic magmatism (571 ± 25 Ma, Figure 3.11a) of 

the Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite, and the other interpreted as representing a hydrothermal 

event (Figure 3.3b) that affected the rock (486 ± 9 Ma, Figure 3.10a). In the same way, although 

P13 metabasite presents an age distribution of inherited data typical of xenocrystals (Figure 

3.11b), the youngest zircon age of ca. 860 Ma is coherent with magmatic crystallization of the 

host metamafic rock in the Neoproterozoic period, as it is also suggested in the isochronic age 

calculated from Sm-Nd data (Figure 3.9).  

Given the stratigraphic relationship of the CA13 metatuff sample with the adjacent units (small 

beds intercalated with phyllites and carbonatic rocks), we infer the age of 613 ± 10 Ma (Figure 

3.11c) as the sedimentation age of the pelitic and carbonatic succession of Itaiacoca Group.  

The zircons of CA38 and CA39 samples present prismatic habit with well-developed oscillatory 

zoning, however the crystals of the metavolcanosedimentary sample show round borders 

typically of detrital grains (Figure 3.10c, e). The geochronological data yield ages in the 

Statherian period (1761-1805 Ma interval) for the deposition of the Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation represented by the crystallization (1761 ± 14 Ma, Figure 3.11e) and maximum 

depositional age (the youngest detrital zircon, 1805 ± 35 Ma, Figure 3.11d) of the 

metarhyodacite and metavolcanosedimentary rock, respectively. 

3.5.4 Regional geotectonic implications 

 

The results here obtained point to the separation of the here named Bairro dos Prestes Formation 

from the Itaiacoca Group based on the large difference in lithological associations and volcanic 

ages: while the sedimentation of the Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite and Bairro dos Campos 

Formation of the Itaiacoca Group lay in the 571-613 Ma age interval, the Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation has a 1760-1800 Ma sedimentation and volcanic age. 



 

74 
 

The ages obtained for the Itaiacoca Group rocks (Bairro dos Campos Formation and Fazenda 

Velha metabasic Suite) are in part similar to those from Abapã Formation in the southwestern 

portion of the Itaiacoca Group (Paraná state), but they disagree with respect to the metabasites 

ages from that region (Siga Jr et al., 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011c). In the same way, our 

geochronological data of the Itaiacoca Group contrast with some data from the metasedimentary 

units of the Apiaí terrane, as the Água Clara Formation (Weber et al., 2004), Lajeado 

(Campanha et al., 2016) and Votuverava (Siga Jr et al., 2011; Campanha et al., 2015) groups, 

which have shown mainly Mesoproterozoic sedimentation ages, but with expressive Ediacaran 

arc-related granitic magmatism, metamorphism and transcurrent-related deformation 

(Hackspacher et al., 2000; Janasi et al., 2001;Prazeres Filho, 2005; Faleiros et al., 2010, 2011). 

However, they are similar with the calculated ages for some units of the Curitiba Terrane, south 

of the Lancinha-Cubatão shear zone, especially the Turvo-Cajati Formation that has metapelitic 

rocks with a youngest detrital zircon population with U-Pb ages of ca. 630 Ma (Faleiros et al., 

2016), although perhaps somewhat younger than those from the Capirú Formation which has 

been speculatively age-correlated by some authors with the Itaiacoca Group (Almeida, 1956; 

Bigarella and Salamuni, 1956, Petri and Suguio, 1969; Hasui, 1986; Campanha, 1991; 

Fassbinder, 1996; Campanha and Sadowski, 1999).  

The age obtained for the Bairro dos Prestes Formation is similar to that from the neighboring 

Apiaí-Mirim Complex (Prazeres Filho, 2005; Siga Jr, 2010) but the latter is primarily composed 

of orthogneiss, while its surrounding metasedimentary rocks are generally attributed to the 

Água Clara Formation which in turn has a 1590 - 1470 Ma age (Weber et al., 2004).  

Geochronological data and geochemical signature results, as well the similar sedimentary and 

volcanic environments suggest a possible correlation between part of the Açungui Supergroup 

and São Roque Group (Moraes, 1933; Almeida, 1944; Coutinho, 1968a, 1968b, 1971; Hasui, 

1973). There is no physical continuity between them because their connection region is covered 

by the Paleozoic sedimentary flat-lying rocks of the Paraná basin (Figure 3.1). The Pirapora do 

Bom Jesus Formation from São Roque Group and Itaiacoca Group (in Pirapora do Bom Jesus 

and Itapeva region, respectively) were metamorphosed under greenschists facies conditions, 

and comprise significant amounts of metabasic rocks, intercalated with pelitic-dolomitic 

successions with stromatolites and other shallow water structures (Bergmann and Fairchild, 

1985, 1986, Bergmann, 1988), suggesting a common depositional environment-type. The 

association of bodies of metabasalt covered by stromatolitic dolomite suggests the existence of 

oceanic islands and associated shallow water deposits. Available zircon U-Pb ages obtained

from metabasalt samples from the Pirapora do Bom Jesus Formation (608 ± 7 Ma and 628 ± 9 

Ma; Hasckspacher et al., 1999, 2000) and Itaiacoca Group (571 ± 25 Ma and 613 ± 10 Ma; this 

work), indicate that both units are chronocorrelated and deposited during the Ediacaran. 

Additionally, the overall geochemical patterns from the Pirapora do Bom Jesus (Figueiredo et 

al., 1982; Lazzari, 1987; Hasckspacher et al., 1999, 2000; Juliani et al, 2000; Tassinari et al., 

2001) and Itaiacoca Formation (this work) metabasites are coherent with a back-arc basin 

magmatic setting.   

U-Pb ages and geochemical signature of the metavolcanosedimentary rock and metarhyodacite 

samples of the Bairro dos Prestes Formation also allow a correlation between the Bairro dos 

Prestes Formation and part of the São Roque Group, a major unit from the central Ribeira Belt. 

The Boturuna Formation (São Roque Group) and Bairro dos Prestes Formation (in Morro do 

Polvilho and Itapeva regions, respectively), were affected by a greenschist facies 

metamorphism, and are composed of intercalations of acid metavolcanic rocks in packages 

dominated by phyllites and quartzites, with age of 1790 ± 14 Ma (Van Schmus et al., 1986), 

1750 ± 40 Ma (Oliveira et al., 2008), 2247± 13 Ma Ma (Henrique Pinto, 2012) and 1761 ± 14 

Ma (this work), related with felsic to intermediate volcanism with chemical characteristics 

typical of High-K calc-alkaline granites of magmatic arcs (Delgado et al., 2003; Henrique-Pinto 

and Janasi, 2010; this work). 

The arc-back-arc basin environment implies the existence of an oceanic islands, which involve 

the existence of a large Ediacaran ocean (Ocean Adamastor). In this context, the location of the 

Itaiacoca Group in the north of the Apiaí Terrain also suggests the existence of a suture zone 

between this and the Paranapanema Craton, indicating for the first time that this tectonic collage 

is Ediacarana. 

 

3.6 CONCLUSIONS  

 

Geochronological data obtained from metabasites (571 ± 25 Ma) and metatuff (613 ± 10 Ma) 

sample of Itaiacoca Group suggest Neoproterozoic ages for the emplacement of basic 

magmatism and deposition of pelitic and carbonatic succession.  While, SHRIMP U-Pb zircon 

geochronology on a metarhyodacite and metavolcanosedimentary of Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation yield ages of 1761 ± 14 and 1805 ± 35 Ma, interpreted as crystallization and 

depositional ages, respectively, of this unit.    



 

76 
 

The geochemistry characterization based on trace and rare elements and Sm-Nd isotopic system 

suggest tholeiitic to calc-alkaline signatures for the Itaiacoca Group metabasites, with 

emplacement in a back-arc basin setting also coherent with the field geological data. The 

positive ?Nd(t) values (+2.3 - +3.2), imply a common juvenile mantle source to the basic 

magmatism, while trace element data suggest a dominant MORB-type mantle source with 

heterogeneous contribution of subduction zone components, also corroborating a back-arc 

setting environment. Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb data indicate an Ediacaran age interval of 570-615 

Ma for back-arc basin basic volcanic magmatism and deposition of part of the Itaiacoca Group.  

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation is here defined in the region between Itapeva and Ribeirão 

Branco and we propose its separation from the Itaiacoca Group due their large differences in 

depositional settings and volcanic ages. The Bairro dos Prestes Formation is comprised of 

phyllites with sometimes amygdaloid structures, fine to medium grained-quartzites, and 

restricted occurrences of metarhyodacite and metaconglomerate. 

The Bairro dos Prestes metarhyodacite presents metaluminous character with geochemical 

signatures of high-K calc-alkaline magma series, whereas negative ?Nd(t) values (-6.8), suggest 

the recycling of Neoarchean continental crust (TDM model age of 2537 Ma).  

U-Pb age data and geochemical as the geological context suggest that the Itaiacoca Group can 

be correlated with Pirapora do Bom Jesus Formation of São Roque Group (dated in 608–628 

Ma period), deposited in back-arc environment and amalgamated during the Brasiliano/Pan 

African Orogeny in the Late Neoproterozoic, and the Bairro dos Prestes Formation is correlated 

with Boturuna Formation of São Roque Group, with deposition age between 1750 Ma and 1790 

Ma. The Itaiacoca Group and Pirapora do Bom Jesus Formation are both inferred as remnants 

of an arc–back-arc basin system associated with the large Adamastor Ocean, and an Ediacaran 

suture zone between the Apiaí Terrane and the Paranapanema Craton.

CHAPTER 4 

Pure shear-dominated transpression in the southern Ribeira Belt, Brazil: finite strain 

and quartz c-axis fabric constraints from the Bairro dos Prestes Formation1 

 

 

ABSTRACT 

The Paleoproterozoic Bairro dos Prestes Formation and Apiaí Mirim Complex in the Ribeira 

Belt, SE Brazil, are good targets for the implementation of microstructural methods that help 

to understand their deformational evolution. Shape Preferred Orientation (SPO) and Lattice 

Preferred Orientation (LPO) techniques were performed in seven samples. The results show 

oblate shape for the finite strain ellipsoid with steep NE XY plane and high rake X-axis, 

correlate with the planar and linear structures measured in field. A transpressive regime with 

predominance of pure shear is compatible with such deformational pattern. The deformational 

temperature calculated from the opening angles (c-axis pattern fabric) vary from 531°C-593°C 

to 613°C-703°C with spatial variation in the study area from north (lowest) to south (highest), 

present correlation with temperature metamorphism and dynamic recrystallized mechanism. 

The c-axis structures display dependence on finite strain ellipsoid geometry, recrystallized 

grains size and transitions of dislocation glide systems. Water weakening and solution transfer 

process modify the c-axis structure geometry, increasing the opening angles, orienting the 

maxima at medium angles of the stretching lineation and activating of prism&amp;lt;a&gt; slip.

4.1  INTRODUCTION 
 

The fabric of deformed rocks can be represented by the orientation and strength of the shape 

preferred orientation (SPO) and lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of the mineral aggregate and 

it is related to the object shape, size and orientation, strain rate, temperature, fluids, as well the 

incremental and finite strain geometry. Under isotropic rheology the planar and linear fabrics 

shapes represent the XY plane and X-axis of finite strain ellipsoid, respectively (Passchier and 

Trouw, 2005). Therefore, the quantification and characterization of deformation shape are 

possible through the measurement of SPO and LPO microstructure fabrics of the rocks (Zucali 

et al., 2014). 

The shape preferential orientation (SPO) allows to quantify the geometrical properties of 

deformed rocks through the image analysis of the shape, size and orientation of grain aggregate. 

Considering a homogeneous deformation and equidimensional initial shapes, the SPO can be 

related to the finite strain ellipsoid and the orientation of its main axes reflect the principal 

planar and linear deformational structures (Launeau and Robin, 2003, 2005; Passchier and 

Trouw, 2005).  

 

Figure 4. 1. Simplified geotectonic map of the Southern and central portions of the Ribeira Belt with 

location of study area Figure 4.2. (From Campanha et al., 2015). 

Quartz grains plastically deformed exhibit microstructures and preferred crystallographic 

orientation developed from intracrystalline slip systems (in charge of accommodation of crystal 

plasticity) and geometry of the flow pattern (Passchier and Trouw, 2005). The c-axis LPO 



 

85 
 

pattern generated give information about the progressive deformation flow, magnitude and 

symmetry of finite strain, kinematic framework, deformational temperature and strain rate 

regimes under they were develop (Schmid and Casey, 1986; Lister et al., 1978; Law, 1987, 

1990; Faleiros et al., 2010).  

From experimental and natural tests it was deduced that c-axis fabrics and their opening-angle 

are sensitive to different variables, as transition prism [c] to basal&amp;lt;a&gt; (Lister and Hobbs, 1980; 

Stipp et al., 2002a; Keller and Stipp, 2011), temperature (e.g. Faleiros, 2016; Law, 2014), 

pressure (Faleiros et al., 2010), grain size and mechanism of recrystallized (e.g. Tullis et al., 

1973; Hobss 1968), mineral aggregates, lithological variation (Lister and Dornsiepen, 1982), 

deformation path (e.g. Lister and Hobbs, 1980; Law, 1990),  water activity (solution and 

precipitation process) (Tullis et al., 1973; Hippert, 1994; Stallard and Shelley, 1995)  and pre-

existing fabrics, all of them can modify the c-axis fabric.  

The structural framework of Bairro dos Prestes Formation (before included in the Itaiacoca 

Group) (Forero et al., 2018) have been discussed by some authors and three (e.g. Soares, 1987b; 

Theodorovicz et al., 1988) or four deformational events (e.g. Takahashi et al., 1984; Souza, 

1990; Reis Neto, 1994; Siga Jr et al., 2009) have been proposed. But none makes use of 

microstructural techniques for quantification and characterization of the microstructural fabric 

and the finite strain ellipsoid. We analyzed through image tools and software the shape 

preferred orientation (porphyroclasts) of four samples and the lattice preferred orientation (c-

axis of recrystallized quartz) of seven samples. 

From the SPO analysis we determinate the geometry of ellipsoid strain and compared the plane 

XY and X-axis calculated with the field data (foliation and lineation) collected. The LPO 

technique provides information about the deformation mechanisms, strain path and shape, and 

deformational temperature calculated from the opening-angle of the quartz c-axis fabric. These 

deformational temperatures are compared with the metamorphism temperature indicated by 

mineral assemblages of the metamorphic peak. We discuss the effects of the dynamic 

recrystallization, 3D strain type, basal&amp;lt;a&gt; - prism [c] switch, water weakening and solution 

transfer process in the transition and geometry of c-axis pattern and the opening-angles.

4.2 GEOLOGICAL CONTEXT 
 

In the southwestern portion of the Neoproterozoic Ribeira Belt (Apiaí terrane), between Itapeva  

and  Ribeirão  Branco  region (SP)  (Figure 4.1),  are  present  three  main  Proterozoic 

litostratigraphic units: the Itaiacoca Group, the Bairro dos Prestes Formation and the Apiaí-

Mirim Complex (Figure 4.2), differentiated in ages and lithological associations (Forero-Ortega 

et al., 2018). The Itaiacoca Group (Almeida, 1944; Souza, 1990, 1992) is composed mainly by 

metapelites and phyllites (Água Nova Formation) with thin intercalations  of  metatuffs   

(Forero-Ortega et al., 2018)   in   transitional   contact  with calcitic and dolomitic 

metalimestones (Bairro dos Campos Formation) with Conophyton type stromatoliths (Almeida, 

1944; Fairchild, 1977; Sallun Filho, 1999; Sallun Filho and Fairchild, 2000, 2004, 2005), 

massive quartzites (Serra dos Macacos Formation) and metabasites with geochemical 

characteristics of MORB, similar to the basaltic magmatism generated in back-arc basin, 

associated with metadolomites, quartzites, talc schists and chlorite schists (Fazenda Velha 

Metabasic Suit, Forero-Ortega et al., 2018).  

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation exhibits metavolcanosedimentary rocks (phyllites sometimes 

with amygdaloid structures), quartzites, and restricted occurrences of metarhyodacite and 

metaconglomerate (Forero-Ortega et al., 2018). The metaconglomerate is constituted by 

pebbles of quartzite, volcanosedimentary rock and black phyllites supported by a 

metamudstone matrix. The Apiaí Mirim Complex is restricted to the southeast of the study area, 

in tectonic contact with the adjacent units and it is constituted by paragneiss and medium to 

coarse grained micaceous quartzite, under amphibolite metamorphic facies. 

These units are affected by three deformational events, the first responsible for the development 

of principal foliation plane (Sn), characterized as schistosity or slaty cleavage depending on the 

lithology, being penetrative in all units, sub-parallel to the compositional bands in 

metalimestones rocks and pelitic intercalations contacts, and with steep dips and NE-SW strikes 

(Figure 4.3a). The Sn planes are deformed by Sn+1 and Sn+2 foliations, represented by crenulation 

cleavages present mainly in the metapelitic and metavolcanosedimentary rocks. The Sn+1 is 

associated with tight folds with NW axial-planes (Figure 4.3b) in quartzite, 

metavolcanosedimentary and pelitic sequence, and the Sn+2 with open folds with NE axial-

planes (Figure 4.3c) in quartzite and phyllite.

Recent geochronological data suggest a Paleoproterozoic age (1761±14 Ma) for the 

sedimentation of the Bairro dos Prestes Formation and Neoproterozoic age (613.5±9.6 Ma) for 

the deposition of Itaiacoca Group (Forero-Ortega et al., 2018).  

4.3 PETROGRAPHY AND MICROSTRUCTURES  

   

Seven samples were analyzed under thin section for LPO (Table 4.1), one metarhyodacite 

(CA39.2) and five quartzites (CA9b, CA10c, CA74c, CA85, CA125) of Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation and one paragneiss (P33) of the Apiaí Mirim Complex. Three of these (CA10, CA39, 

CA74) and one metaconglomerate hand-sample were also analyzed for SPO.

The paragneiss of the Apiaí-Mirim Complex, sample P33 (Figure 4.5k) is constitute by quartz 

+ potassic feldspar + microcline + plagioclase + muscovite + fibrolite + biotite. The potassic 

feldspar occurs as peritectic phase in the matrix (Figure 4.5l) and as principal mineral in the 

leucosome (Figure 4.5m). The metamorphic association involved quartz, feldspar, microcline, 

plagioclase, fibrolite and biotite, and the muscovite is a retrometamorphic mineral (Al2SiO5 + 

K-feldspar + liquid = Muscovite + quartz). The rock stability field is delimitated by reactions 

two and eight (Figure 4.4), implying an upper temperature limit of approximately 865°C (Spear 

et al., 1999), under amphibolite facies metamorphism.  

The metarhyodacite sample has phenocrystals of feldspar with perthite and antiperthite textures, 

plagioclase, biotite, muscovite and quartz, and a microcrystalline matrix of chlorite, biotite, 

white micas and opaque minerals. The fine-grained matrix suggests greenschist facies 

metamorphism. But the quartz microcrystals in the strain shadows of phenocrystals present 

deformation mechanism of higher temperature (grain boundary migration), suggesting ranges 

upper than 500ºC.

delimited by the reactions two and eight and red line corresponding to the deformation temperature 

calculated from quartz c-axis fabric opening-angles. Adapted from Spear et al. (1999). 

The quartzites samples display a simple mineralogy, represented by Pl + Ms + Qz ± Fsp ± Mc 

± Bt, being a bad temperature indicator, and some crystals can be detrital. 

The intervenient phyllites and metavolcanosedimentary rocks of the Bairro dos Prestes 

Formation show a mineral assemblage of (Ms + Bt + Qz) also compatible with greenschist 

facies metamorphism. 

All samples present two deformation mechanisms, crystal-plastic deformation (dynamic 

recrystalization) and solution transfer.

The solution transfer process is evidenced by the presence of mica at porphyroclasts boundaries 

(Figure 4.d), optical continuity of the porphyroclasts and recrystallized material (Figure 4.5h), 

dissolved material deposited in intragranular veins (Figure 4.5i), and fluid inclusion trails 

(Figure 4.5j); these characteristics evidence the porphyroclasts growth and intracrystalline 

plastic deformation in water presence (Trepmann and Stöckhert, 2003). The samples (with 

exception of P33) generally display porphyroclasts with deformation lamellae, undulose 

extinction and ? and ? sigmoids subparallel to Sn; and adjacent to the porphyroclasts are 

observed strain shadows and mantled porphyroclasts with fine-grained dynamically 

recrystallized quartz (Figure 4.5).  

The dynamic recrystallization processes present in the samples are subgrain rotation (SGR) and 

grain boundary migration recrystallization (GBM). The SGR recrystallization generates weak 

ribbon-shape (slightly elongated) with high angles boundaries porphyroclasts (Figure 4.5a-b 

and d-f), while the subgrains with GBM microstructure (Figure 4.5a-h) present crystals with 

irregular and polygonal shapes (straight and lobate boundaries with triple junctions of 

approximately 120º) (Passchier and Trouw, 2005), and pinning structure of quartz grain 

boundaries on muscovite crystals or mica as inclusions (Figure 4.5f-g). The samples also show 

strain caps and strain shadows (Passchier and Trouw, 2005) with gradual transition between 

their fine-grained dynamically recrystallized grains and the matrix.          

The conglomerate sample (P8) used for the SPO analysis is constituted by pebbles of quartzite, 

metavolcanosedimentary and black phyllites supported by a metapelitic matrix.  

 

4.4 SPO FABRIC  
 

Hand-sample cuts and thin sections were made along three non-paralell planes of four field-

oriented samples (metaconglomerate, metarhyodacite and two quartzites) with the purpose of 

determinate the Shape Preferred Orientation (SPO). Each sample was reoriented in the 

laboratory and the cuts orientation measured with a magnetic compass. The photomicrography 

of thin sections, as the hand-sample cuts digital photographies were digitalized in the 

CorelDraw™ software for highlight the crystals boundaries, and they were subsequently 

converted into binary raster images (black and white). From the sectional raster images, strain 

ellipses (2D) with their respective long and short axes were deduced by the Inertia tensor 

method (Launeau and Cruden, 1998) in the SPO program (Launeau and Robin, 2003, 2005). 



 

93 
 

The software allows to divide each image in subsets in order to make combinatory analyses 

between them.

. The 

K1 axis represents the lineation while K3 is the pole of the foliation (with principal axes K1&gt;K2&gt;K3). 

The calculated sectional subsets (ellipses) were integrated in the ELLIPSOID program 

(Launeau and Robin, 2003) to find the 3D ‘bulk ellipsoid’ (Figure 4.6), with the orientation of 

its principal axes (X, Y, Z) and shape parameters. The program also calculates an 

‘incompatibility index’ (?F%), which measures the compatibility or misfit between the 

sectional ellipses (2D) and the calculated 3D ellipsoid (Robin, 2002), and also establishes if the 

sectional ellipses lead to a 3D hyperboloid instead of an ellipsoid (Launeau and Robin, 2005). 

The fit is considered better if ?F&amp;lt;10% and it is ideal when values are ?F = 0% (Launeau and 

Robin 2005). The ellipsoid shape can be described by the T parameter, when T~0 (X/Y = Y/Z) 

the shape is planar-linear (plane strain), T&lt;0, (X&gt;Y=Z) it is linear or prolate and T &gt; 0 (X=Y&gt;Z) 

the shape is planar or oblate.  The anisotropy intensity can be represented by the X/Z ratio or 

the anisotropy degree parameter, P?, which range from 1 upwards (sphere to ellipsoid; 1 to ?) 



 

94 
 

(Ramsay and Huber, 1983; Borradaile and Werner, 1994; Lagroix and Borradaile, 2000; 

Nakamura and Borradaile, 2004). 

The calculated ellipsoids (table 4.2) are quite well defined, present their principal directions 

with dispersion cones with half-angles of standard deviation (?1 and ?2) &amp;lt;29° and 

“incompatibility index” (?F) &amp;lt;10%, the shape is planar (oblate; Figure 4.6-7), and they also 

exhibit Z axes (foliation poles) in the center of the density contours (area of maximum density), 

indicating that the mineral distribution is homogeneous and the foliation is the best-defined 

fabric element (Salazar, 2010; Archanjo et al., 2012). The XY planes have predominantly NE-

SW strike with steep dips and the X-directions have predominantly high rakes (down-dip) 

coincident with the regional trend measured in field (Figure 4.2).

The ratio between the long and short axes or SPO anisotropy of the calculated ellipsoids for the 

samples CA10, CA39 and CA74 present very low (X/Z&amp;lt;1.5) to low (X/Z&amp;lt;2.0) values, while 

the P8 metaconglomerate is highly deformed (X/Z ~ 7).  

 

4.5 QUARTZ C-AXIS FABRIC 

 

Quartz c-axis orientation were measured (approximately 300 grains in each sample) for 

recrystallized crystals of seven samples through a universal stage; the samples faces were cut 

perpendicular to foliation and parallel to stretching lineation, in order to compare our results 

with the fabric simulations that were presented in a projection plane containing the XZ finite 

strain section (Law, 1990). The  quartz c-axes were  represented by isofrequence curves in 

lower-hemisphere equal-area projections (Schmidt-Lambert net), in which the reference is the 

main  finite strain axis (X, Y, Z) with the XY plane (foliation) in the EW vertical position and 



 

95 
 

the X-axis (lineation) in the EW horizontal position of the net (Turner and Weiss, 1963; 

Wahlstrom, 1969; Santoro, 1998; Passchier and Trouw, 2005), using the Stereo32 program 

version 1.0.3 (Röller and Trepmann, 2011). 

 

Figure 4. 7. Flinn diagram with the X, Y, Z axes of the strain ellipsoid determinate by SPO analysis.  

The patterns can be cross or single girdles, which are also symmetrical or asymmetrical with 

respect to finite strain axes indicating coaxial and non-coaxial deformation, respectively. The 

fabric skeletons asymmetry is used to deduce the sense of shear (Law, 1987, 1990). The c-axis 

fabric pattern can also define the dominate slip systems in quartz crystals development during 

the deformational event (e.g, Lister et al., 1978; Lister and Hobbs, 1980). 

4.5.1 Quartz c- axis patterns 

 

With exception of the quartzite CA85, the recrystallized grains c-axis isofrequence curves of 

the samples present type I crossed girdles (Lister, 1977) with two maxima slightly 

asymmetrically arranged in intermediate positions between Z and X at the pole figure periphery. 

The CA85 sample does not display c-axis fabric pattern well defined but display a c-axis 

maximum around Z and other at small angles to the stretching lineation and near to Y, this 

pattern is similar to the structures developed in constrictive field (Lister and Hobbs, 1980).

4.5.2 Opening angle thermometer  

 

The opening angle (OA) of the quartz c-axis fabric has been used as deformation thermometer 

since the fabrics were “locked in” during dislocation creep and dynamic recrystallization (e.g. 

Okudaira et al., 1998; Kruhl and Peternell, 2002; Law 2014; Faleiros et al., 2016) Its opening 

angle is directly related to the increase of temperature, hydrolytic weakening, decreasing strain 

rate (e.g. Lister and Dornsiepen, 1982; Kruhl, 1998; Law et al., 2013; Law 2014) and also show 

pressure-dependence (Faleiros et al. 2016). 

The deformation temperature (Figure 4.6, Table 4.1) deduced from OA equation (for 250°C?T 

?650°C and OA?87° conditions, Faleiros et al., 2016) yielded results ranging from 531°C-

593°C to 613°C-703°C, at or above the greenschist-amphibolite facies limit, discordant with 

the temperatures indicated by the metamorphic mineral assemblages of the samples, that 

suggested greenschist facies. Law (2014), proposed that the water weakening can be the 

responsible for the higher deformation temperatures calculated by fabric opening-angles. 

 

4.6 DISCUSSION 
 

4.6.1 Analysis of finite strain  

 

The lithologies of the Bairro dos Prestes Formation present different structures and deformation 

styles related with their rheological response and rock competence. The quartzite 

metarhyodacite and paragneiss display a relatively more rigid behavior, while the phyllites and 

metavolcanosedimentary show a more ductile deformation, exhibiting Sn+1 crenulation planes 

and tight folds. Comparing quantitatively our shape preferential orientation results (strain ratios 

X/Z ranging from 1.34 to 1.79, with 6.88 as anomalous value corresponding to the 

metaconglomerate sample) with the strain ratio obtained by Sallun Filho et al. (2005) measured 

in Conophyton type stromatoliths with conic shape (values between 1.37 and 1.91), it is possible 

to establish that despite the lithological differences, a relatively homogeneous strain ratio (with 

low values of finite deformation) is observed in the study area.  

A X/Z ratio strain of 5.46 for metaconglomerate sample was determined subsequently through 

the Rf/Phi Strain Analysis Program Version 1 (Mulchrone and Lisle, 1999), based on Rf/? 

technique (Ramsay, 1967; Ramsay and Huber, 1987), which assumed originally elliptical 

objects without preferred initial orientation. The result is not very different from the measured 



 

98 
 

by the SPO technique (X/Z = 6.88). The lithology (quartzite, phyllites and 

metavolcanosedimentary pebbles supported by a metamudstone matrix) is probably responsible 

for the higher deformation ratio that this rock suffered.    

4.6.2 C-axis fabric transitions 

 

As mentioned above, the quartz c-axis fabric geometry, the opening angle (OA) and the 

calculated deformation temperature are sensitive to factors as the 3D strain type, strain rate, 

water weakening, dynamic recrystallization mechanisms, some of these will discussed below.  

4.6.2.1 Mineralogy variation and impurities  

 

The fabric transitions and dislocation glide system that operate during intracrystalline ductile 

deformation change with the rheological response (mineralogy difference and penetrative 

anisotropy differences) (Lister and Dornsiepen, 1982), they are also influenced by the flow 

stress and impurities present during the deformation process (Passchier and Throw,1996). In 

the obtained results (Figure 4.5 and 8), the CA9b, CA10c, CA39,2, CA74 and P33 samples with 

larger mineralogical variety and impurities in the matrix as mica grains, present higher 

deformation temperatures calculated from AO.   

4.6.2.2 Deformation pattern  

 

The quartz c-axis fabric pattern varies as strain is accumulated coaxially or non-coaxially, for 

this reason is used to indicate the deformation pattern to which it was subjected (Law 1990; 

Lister and Hobbs, 1980). The obtained quartz c-axis fabrics with exception of CA85 sample 

show an orthorhombic symmetry and crossed girdles geometry suggesting coaxial deformation 

and flattening-like strain shape, while the CA85 sample with c-axis maximum around Z and 

other at small angles to Y is similar to the fabrics development in constrictive field (Lister and 

Hobbs, 1980).  The quartz c-axis opening angle decreasing is related with this variation, the 

lowest OA is present in the CA85 sample and higher OA are observed in the samples with type 

I crossed girdles. 

4.6.2.3 Deformation temperature and their indirect relation in the basal&amp;lt;a&gt; - prism [c] switch  

 

The relationship between quartz c-axis fabrics and opening angles of the samples match with 

the results deduced in natural and experimental tests (e.g. Hobbs, 1968; Tullis, 1971; Blacic, 

1975; Lister, 1981; Lister and Dornsiepen, 1982; Schmid and Casey, 1986; Okudaira et al., 



 

99 
 

1995; Kruhl, 1996; Morgan and law, 2004; Toy et al., 2008; Faleiros et al., 2016), in which is 

indicated that deformation temperature is an important factor in fabric transitions.  

In our samples with SGR and GBM recrystallization is possible to see combination of multiple 

slip systems (basal&amp;lt;a&gt;, rhomb&amp;lt;a&gt; and prism&amp;lt;a&gt;), with some maxima concentrations towards 

Y pole, similar with the c-axis structures observed in the SGR to GBM transition by Stipp et al. 

(2002a) and Keller and Stipp (2011). They deduced that with the rising temperature, the onset 

of recrystallization can be influenced in the fabric patterns development, indicating a correlation 

between dynamic recrystallization mechanism and dislocation creep in the c-axis geometry 

texture (Urai et al., 1986; Schmid, 1994; Stipp et al., 2002a). 

4.6.2.4 Water weakening  

 

The effect of water in the OA is still ambiguous and its interpretation from experimental 

demonstration has been difficult (Paterson and Kekulawala, 1979 in Lister and Dornsiepen, 

1982), however Blacic (1975) found from synthetic quartz experiments, that the prism&amp;lt;c&gt; slip 

is developed at low temperature and it is favored over basal slip by increasing the temperature 

for low stress intensity regimes, since the water promote dislocations mobility and reduce the 

stress for glide resulting in larger fabric opening-angles (Griggs and Blacic, 1965; Den Brok, 

1992; Lister et al., 1978; Muto, 2011). The transition between the three dislocation creep 

regimes and c-axis fabric geometry with high OA is also favored by the water weakening 

(Blacic, 1975; Den Brok and Spiers, 1991; Garbutt and Teyssier, 1991; Hirth and Tullis, 1992; 

Law, 2014). 

Our samples with subgrain rotation recrystallization present deformation temperatures between 

531°C to 593°C (Table 4.1), coinciding with the SGR-GMB transition estimated 570°C 

(Zulauf, 2001), however, the metamorphic assemble suggest lower temperate conditions, this 

effect can be related with the water activity in the dynamic recrystallization transition and 

consequently with the variation in the c-axes structures obtained. 

4.6.2.5 Solution transfer process  

 

In our samples the accommodation of strain was operate by solution transfer and crystal-plastic 

deformation processes (being dominant the last one), that implying water saturated conditions. 

Some structures that evidence the recrystallization and dissolution as concurrent process are 

porphyroclasts with undulating outline and recrystallized grains forming strain shadows (Figure 

4.5a-b). Solution transfer operate mainly along the foliation surfaces favoured by the mica 

content, while the crystal-plastic deformation occurs as recrystallized tails (? and ? sigmoids) 



 

100 
 

or intramicrolithon deformation mechanism (mica-free parts), where the dissolution is difficult 

and recovery and recrystallization happened (Hippertt, 1994). 

The samples CA09b, CA10c and CA125 (all with mica content less than or equal to 25%) have 

deformation temperature on or higher to the estimated SGR-GMB transition temperature 

(Zulauf, 2001; Stipp et al., 2002a; Passchier and Trouw, 2005; Faleiros et al., 2010), their 

fabrics geometry (type I crossed girdles with two points c-axis) can be influence by incipient 

dissolution transfer process and intracrystalline plasticity (dislocation creep). As was also 

observed by Hippertt (1994), the grains with incipient dissolution show fabric pattern with c-

axis maxima at low angles to the stretching lineation, while the quartz grains formed from 

precipitation of material dissolved with partial intracrystalline plasticity deformation display c-

axes concentration in the center of the plot suggesting prism&amp;lt;a&gt; slip, and the grains with mica-

poor ribbon present c-axes structures with maxima around the foliation pole reflecting 

dislocation creep deformation. 

4.7 CONCLUSIONS  
 

The shape preferred orientation of the porphyroclast developed subvertical planes 

predominantly NE-SW strike with steep dips and main axis elongation with NW-SE trend and 

high rakes, with oblate (flattening) shapes, compatible with the regional trend measured in field, 

while the c-axis fabric of recrystallized quartz grains display cross girdles with preferred 

orientation at medium angles between Z and X (basal&amp;lt;a&gt; and prism&amp;lt;a&gt; slip) compatible with 

flattening fabric shape. 

The predominantly oblate strain shape obtained by the SPO technique (T ranging from 0.175 

to 0.611) compatible with the observed c-axis fabric, together with the high rake of the strain 

X-axis (lineation) and steep dip of the XY plane (foliation), suggest a transpressive regime with 

predominance of pure shear.  

The deformation temperature obtained by the c-axis fabric opening angle ranges from 531°C-

593°C to 613°C-703°C compatible with the variation from SGR and GBM to GBM regimes, 

but above the greenschist facies deduced from the metamorphic mineral assemblage. 

 

The water weakening and solution transfer processes also modify the crystallization mechanism 

transition, the c-axis patterns (tends to develop maxima at low angles to stretching lineation and 

activated prism&amp;lt;a&gt; slip) and the deformation temperature of the CA09b, CA10c and CA125 

samples, because the solution transfer process increase the opening-angles of the c-axis fabric 



 

101 
 

and subsequently the calculated temperature, that would be higher that the temperatures 

indicated by the mineral assemblage. 

 

The samples present a relationship between the texture patterns (slip systems), dynamic 

recrystallization and deformation temperature with spatial variation. From North to South, the 

deformation temperature increases and the deformation mechanism vary from SGR and GBM 

to GBM.

CHAPTER 5 

New occurrence of a Late Ediacaran metasandstone deposit located on the Apiaí-Guaçu 

river banks, southeast from Itapeva (SP)1 

 
A.J. Forero-Ortega a, G.A.C. Campanha a, F.M. Faleiros a  

 

 

A new occurrence of Late Ediacaran metasediments was found on the eastern bank of the Apiaí-

Guaçu river, approximately 20 km southeast from the Itapeva city, South of São Paulo state 

(Appendix 2). The unit has approximately 2 km2 of areal extension and it was recognized during 

the c 1:25.000 geological mapping and U-Pb geochronological study of the region.  

The metasediments are composed of fine to coarse-grained feldspathic quartz metasandstone 

intercalated with small beds of metamudstone. Slaty cleavage planes (N88°E/85°SE) were 

developed obliquely to the relic bedding (S13°E/54°SW).  

The contact between the metasandstone layers and the adjacent rocks of the Statherian Bairro 

dos Prestes Formation (Forero et al., 2018) was inferred as discordant due the different 

lithological and structural associations, metamorphic degree and age. 

Detrital zircon grains were concentrated from a metasandstone sample, according with the 

procedure established in the Geochronology Research Center of the University of São Paulo 

(CPGeo-USP). The grains were analyzed by U-Pb method using a NEPTUNE inductively 

coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an excimer laser ablation (LA) system. The 

external zircon morphology (Figure 5.2) includes subrounded fragments and subhedral grains 

with ovoid habit typically of detrital sedimentary grains (Corfu, 2003). They mostly have 

inherited core and oscillatory composition zoning. From the 36 analyzed zircon grains, 26 

yielded reliable ages with less than 10% discordance and low common Pb (&lt;5%) (Table S6).  

The sample display a dominance of Neoproterozoic detrital ages (88%) ? 588 Ma with Th/U &amp;lt;

0.1, suggesting that the grains were derived from metamorphic sources. Only 12% of the 

population show Paleoproterozoic and Neoarchean peaks with a ranging from 2000 to 2200 Ma 

and 2550-2750 Ma interval, respectively.  The youngest predominant grain group presents a U-

Pb Concordia age of 588.4±1.8 Ma with MSWD of 2.3 (Figure 5.1).  

The lithological, structural and geochronological characteristics of the Apiaí-Guaçu 

metasandstone allows to correlate it with the molasse or transition stage basins of the Brasiliano 



 

104 
 

Cycle, especially with the terrigenous type, as the Camarinha, Quatis, Iporanga, Pouso Alegre, 

Eleutério, Pico do Itapeva formations (Almeida, 1969; Campanha and Sadowski, 1969; 

Teixeira and Petri, 1993; Riccomini, 1993b; Teixeira, 1995; Moro, 2000; Teixeira and Petri, 

2001; Teixeira et al., 2004; Campanha et al., 2008). A correlated near deposit is the Samambaia 

Conglomerate in the Guapiara region (Petri and Suguiu, 1969). The wide prevalence of the 

588.4±1.8 Ma age detrital zircons group over the others and its metamorphic primary origin 

strongly suggest that the main source for the deposit was the Brasiliano collisional orogen. The 

Turvo-Cajati Formation, situated less than 80 km from the studied area and with regional 

collisional metamorphic peak in 589±12 Ma (Faleiros et al., 2011) could be a good candidate 

for source area of sedimentation.

CHAPTER 6 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

In the 1:25,000 Geologic Map performed between Itapeva and Ribeirão Branco region (SP) eleven 

lithostratigraphic units were identified: Quaternary alluvial deposits, Jurassic-Cretaceous diabase dykes, 

the Carboniferous-Permian Itararé Group, the Late Ediacaran Apiaí-Guaçu metasandstone, the 

Neoproterozoic Ribeirão Grande Granite, three formations (Serra dos Macacos, Água Nova, Bairro dos 

Campos) and one magmatic suite (Fazenda Velha Metabasic Suite ) from  the  Neoproterozoic Itaiacoca 

Group, the Statherian Bairro dos Prestes Formation and Apiaí Mirim Complex.  The Proterozoic units 

were affected by three folding phases and by NE-SE and NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE strike-slip faults. 

Neoproterozoic ages were obtained from zircons grains of metabasites (571 ± 25 Ma) and metatuff (613 

± 10 Ma) samples of the Itaiacoca Group, while, geochronological analyses of zircons from 

metarhyodacite and metavolcanosedimentary of Bairro dos Prestes Formation yield crystallization and 

maximum depositional ages of 1,761 ± 14 and 1,805 ± 35 Ma, respectively.  The geochemical data 

suggest a tholeiitic to calc-alkaline character for the Itaiacoca Group metabasites, with a MORB and 

island arc signatures with heterogeneous contribution of subduction zone components, typically of 

BABB basalts. The positive ?Nd(t) values (+2.3 to +3.2), imply a dominant juvenile mantle source to the 

basic magmatism.  

The Itaiacoca Group is correlated with Pirapora do Bom Jesus Formation of São Roque Group given the 

similar lithostratigraphic associations, U-Pb age data and geochemical characteristics. Both are 

interpreted as deposited in back-arc environment associated with the large Adamastor Ocean, and should 

represent an Ediacaran suture zone between the Apiaí Terrane and the Paranapanema Craton. 

The Bairro dos Prestes Formation is here separated from the Itaiacoca Group due their large differences 

in depositional settings and volcanic ages. It has acid metavolcanic rocks with metaluminous character 

and geochemical signatures of high-K calc-alkaline magma series. Its negative ?Nd(t) value (-6.8), 

suggests the recycling of a Neoarchean continental crust (TDM model age of 2,537 Ma). The Bairro dos 

Prestes Formation is correlated with Boturuna Formation of São Roque Group. 

The here recognized Apiaí-Guaçu metasandstone, located on the eastern bank of the river with the same 

name, yields a maximum depositional age of 588.4±1.8. It comprises of fine to coarse-grained 

feldspathic quartz metasandstone intercalated with small beds of metamudstone. The Apiaí-Guaçu 

metasandstone is correlated with the molassic or transition stage basins of the Brasiliano Cycle and 

given the predominance of metamorphic zircons in the detrital grains, the Brasiliano collisional orogen 

and particularly the Turvo-Cajati Formation is suggested as source area for its sedimentation.

The finite strain ellipsoids obtained from the SPO analysis performed in the porphyroclasts present 

oblate shapes with NE-SW strike XY plane and NW-SE steep plunges for X-axis, compatible with the 

planes and lineation measured in field.  

The c-axis fabric of recrystallized quartz grains show cross girdles with maxima concentrations at 

medium angles between Z and X, also compatible with flattening fabric shape. They are sensitive to 

water weakening and solution transfer process modifying the fabric pattern with c-axis maxima at low 

angles to the stretching lineation, increasing the opening angles and subsequently the calculated 

temperature. The deformation temperatures calculated between 531°C-593°C and 613°C-703°C, are 

compatible with the variation from SGR and GBM to GBM regimes, and they also present a tendency 

to increase from North to South. 

These deduced patterns from SPO and LPO analyses suggest a transpressive tectonic regime with 

predominance of pure shear for the deformation.
