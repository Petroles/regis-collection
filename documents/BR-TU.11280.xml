ABSTRACT
The present study aimed to evaluate Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mn, Al, and Fe contents, as well as their geochemical 
partitioning in Sinos River basin sediments in southern Brazil. This basin is a densely populated area with 
a substantial number of industries, especially metallurgy, electroplating works, steel mills, petrochemicals, 
and tanneries. The total metal concentrations were determined by X-ray fluorescence and the sediment 
phase concentrations were determined by applying the BCR-701 sequential extraction method proposed by 
the Community Bureau of Reference of the European Community, using ICP/OES. The contents extracted 
by a solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl were also considered. Metal contents were evaluated in the sediment 
fraction&amp;lt;63 µm. Results in the industrialized and densely populated region showed an increase in the 
total concentrations of Cu, Cr, Zn, and Pb, and in the potentially mobile fractions for Cu, Cr, Zn and Ni 
sequentially extracted. Cr stood out particularly in the Portão stream, showing 1,286 mg/kg as a result of 
the total concentration, considering the tannery region influence.

Key words: BCR-701, metals, sediment, sequential extraction.

INTRODUCTION

Metals are one of the most common pollutants in 
aquatic environments and may be originated from 
natural sources, from geological weathering or 
anthropogenic sources, such as industrial, agri-
cultural, urban and domestic effluents (Hang et 
al. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). Metals when 
dispersed in aquatic environments tend to deposit 
in the sediments, which have high retention 
capacity and the potential of release these pollutants 
(Salomons and Stigliani 1995, Passos et al. 2011). 

This release into the overlying water column may 
occur by changes in environmental conditions such 
as pH, redox potential, bioturbation and organic 
matter decomposition (Förstner and Kersten 
1989, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the 
sediments act as reservoirs of metals, providing a 
reasonably accurate history of the pollution of the 
river (Sakai et al. 1986, Filgueiras et al. 2002, Hang 
et al. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011).

However, the determination in metal total 
concentration in sediments is not a particularly 
good indicator when one looks for a distinction 
between natural and anthropogenic contributions

(Quevauviller et al. 1996, Relic et al. 2010, Passos 
et al. 2011, Okoro et al. 2012). Thus, recent studies 
have used sequential extraction procedures to under-
stand the specific chemical associations with sedi-
mentary phases and metal sources (Rodrigues and 
Formoso 2006, Hang et al. 2009, Davutluoglu et 
al. 2011). Many of these are variants on the scheme 
proposed by Tessier et al. (1979). These procedures 
use selective reagents to consecutively extract 
"operationally defined phases" from the sediments, 
allowing for the quantification of the levels of 
potentially mobile metals and the establishment 
of associations with anthropogenic contributions 
(Rauret et al. 1999, Larner et al. 2008). Thus, 
alterations in the environmental conditions are 
simulated, enabling the prediction of the impact 
of a potential mobilization of metals on the 
surrounding environment (Bacon and Davidson 
2008). The quantification of potentially mobile 
metals can also be done by simple extraction 
techniques (Gleyzes et al. 2002).

Currently, one technique often used is the 
sequential extraction procedure proposed by the 
Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) (now called 
Standards, Measurement and Testing Programme). 
This procedure was developed in order to solve the 
lack of sequential extraction procedure uniformity. 
Besides that, it provides a corresponding certified 
reference material and gives a method validation 
and a way of comparing the data generated (López-
Sánchez et al. 1998, Rauret et al. 1999). This tech-
nique involves three steps – exchangeable metals 
associated with carbonates, reducible metals, and 
oxidizable metals (Quevauviller et al. 1996, Rauret 
1998, Davidson et al. 1999, Pueyo et al. 2001, 
Teixeira et al. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, 
Boughriet et al. 2007, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, 
Passos et al. 2011, Dundar et al. 2012).

Some problems have not yet been fully resol-
ved in the use of sequential extractions, such as redis-
tribution of analytes between the geochemical phases, 
lack of reagent selectivity, incomplete extraction 

and precipitation of new mineral phases during the 
extraction. Even so, the increasing use of such 
schemes in the evaluation of metals in sediments has 
shown the usefulness of the information obtained, 
which many times corresponds to observable environ-
mental effects, such as the decrease in local biodiversity 
(Rauret et al. 1999, Julián and Collado 2002, Bacon 
and Davidson 2008, Rodrigues et al. 2008).

On the other hand, to evaluate the potentially 
mobile metals, cold acid extraction procedures may 
also be used, which tries to simulate the natural 
removal processes of these more "reactive" elements of 
the sediments (Bevilacqua et al. 2009). The extraction 
procedure with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) has 
been frequently applied (Sutherland and Tack 2008, 
Bevilacqua et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009) and can be 
used as a first evaluation technique for monitoring the 
potential contamination by metals. Then, high levels 
identified by the extraction with HCl may be subject 
to further assessment, using sequential extraction 
procedures (Sutherland and Tack 2008).

Sinos River basin is located in an industria-
lized and densely populated area, where there are 
metallurgical industries, electroplating works, steel 
mills, petrochemicals and tanneries, liquid waste 
generators with metals. Even though sediment 
contamination is currently one of the most serious 
problems in basin environmental management, 
finding solutions for these problems is still poor. 
Robaina et al. (2002) and Oliveira et al. (2008) have 
studies that show an intense metal contamination in 
the lower Sinos River.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
geochemical distribution and potential mobility of 
some metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mn, Al, and Fe) 
in sediments along the Sinos River basin. These 
metals were selected because they indicate the 
industrial liquid waste markers which are located 
in the study area especially in the metallurgical/
electroplanting and tannery sectors (Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb 
and Cr), as well as natural components in the area 
(such as Mn, Al and Fe).

STUDY AREA

Sinos River basin is located in the northeast of the 
state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with an extension 
of 3,820 km2 crossing almost 29 counties, of which 
21 are within the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Area, 
the capital of the state (see Fig. 1). It is bounded to 
the east by the Serra Geral, to the west and north 
by the Caí River basin, and to the south by the 
Gravataí River basin. Sinos River has its source 

at an altitude of 600 m, its main course flows is 
190 km and it finally discharges at an altitude of 
12 m. About 1.3 million people inhabit its basin 
(Comitesinos 2009), representing 13% of the total 
population of the state concentrated in only 3.5% 
of its territory. The climate is subtropical with an 
annual average temperature of around 20°C and 
about 1,600 mm of rain annually, well-distributed 
over the four seasons (FEPAM 2006).

Fig. 1 - Study area with the sampling sites in the Sinos River basin.

The basin can be divided into three different 
regions, all of which related to the corresponding 
section of the river: upper, middle, and lower. In 
the upper part, characterized by a more rugged 
terrain and by agricultural activities in small farms, 
we selected two sampling sites (Table I). This part 

of the Sinos River, about 25 km long, has high 
declivity, with altitudes ranging between 600 m and 
60 m. In the middle section of the basin, with about 
125 km, the declivity of the Sinos River decreases, 
and we chose one sampling site (Table I). As one 
moves downstream, the population density and

urbanization as well as the industrial concentration 
increase. Presently, industrial activity (especially 
metallurgy, electroplating works, steel mills, petro-
chemicals and tanneries), domestic sewage, and 
rice farming are the main sources of concern with 
regard to water quality of this river basin (FEPAM 
2006). The lower stretch of the Sinos River has, 
as major tributaries, streams that drain large urban 
centers, such as the Luiz Rau and the Portão streams. 
Besides choosing sampling sites near the mouth of 
these streams, we also selected six additional sites 
along the main course of the Sinos River (Table I). 
The codes of the locations indicate the distance in 
kilometers from the sampling location to the mouth 
of the Sinos River.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

COLLECTION AND PREPARATION OF SAMPLES

Sediment samples were collected between February 
and August 2010, at eight locations along the main 
course of the Sinos River and three tributaries 
(Rolante River and the mouths of Luiz Rau and 
Portão streams). Samples of surface sediments 
were collected by using a PVC, L-shaped manual 
collector. The material collected was stored 
in plastic bags, cooled to 4°C and sent to the 
laboratory, where the fraction with particle size 
&lt;63 µm was separated by means of wet sieving. 
This procedure was performed on the same day 

of sampling, thereby to minimize the action of 
microorganisms in migration processes and avoid 
metals redistribution. The interest content was oven-
dried at 37°C and was then finely homogenized in 
an agate mortar.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES

Total metal concentration

To evaluate the total metal concentrations, the 
sediment samples were prepared as compressed 
pellets and analyzed in a sequential X-ray 
fluorescence spectrometer (PW2404, Philips), 
equipped with a rhodium tube. The analysis 
was performed at the Analytical Geochemistry 
Laboratory at Campinas University.

Sequential extraction

The fractional metal concentrations in the geoche-
mical phases of the sediments was carried out 
according to the sequential extraction method 
proposed by the BCR (now Standards, Measurement 
and Testing Programme) (Pueyo et al. 2001, 
Teixeira et al. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, 
Davutluoglu et al. 2011, Passos et al. 2011, Dundar 
et al. 2012). The procedure is explained in Table II. 
The quantification of metallic cations in solution 
was performed in an inductively coupled plasma 
optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) at the 
Soils Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio 
Grande do Sul. In this study, the fourth stage, 
corresponding to the metal residual fraction, was 
determined by the difference between the sum of 
the three sequentially extracted stages in relation to 
the total content of the metal under study, previously 
obtained by X-ray fluorescence.

Extraction with 0.5 mol/L HCl

The analysis of potentially mobile metals extracted 
with a solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl was performed as 
recommended by Sutherland (2002) and Sutherland 
and Tack (2007, 2008). The procedure involved 
the extraction of 0.5 g of sample with 10 mL of a

solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl under continuous stirring 
at 200 rpm for 1 h at 20°C. The suspension obtained 
was filtered through cellulose ester filter of 0.20 
mm porosity prior to quantification of Cu, Cr, Ni, 
Pb, and Zn, certified for the reference material 
BCR-701. The quantification of metallic cations 
in solution was performed in an ICP-OES at the 
Soils Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio 
Grande do Sul. Subsequently, the contents extracted 
by 0.5 mol/L HCl solution and those by sequential 
extraction were correlated by regressions.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEDIMENTS

Total sulfur (S) was determined by X-ray fluorescence 
and corresponds to indicative values. Organic matter 
was obtained by the loss of mass by ignition (2 h at 
360°C) (Schulte and Hopkins 1996). The analysis 
of particle size was performed in the laboratory 
of the Center for Coastal Studies (CECO) of the 
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and 
it involved the separation of the main textural 
classes of sediments by sieving and sedimentation 
techniques. The clay minerals were also analyzed 
at the CECO, after preparation of slides with the 
oriented clay minerals. The slides were air-dried, 
solvated with ethylene glycol and calcinated, and 
were then successively analyzed by an X-ray 
diffractometer in the range of between 2? 2-28 °, 
by using CuK? radiation.

ACCURACY OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS

To assess the accuracy of the total metals con-
centrations, two soil reference materials were used 
(GSS-2 and GSS-5, China), showing mean recoveries 
from 88 to 105% for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, MnO, Al2O3, 
and Fe2O3. The metal concentrations determination 
in the reference material was performed in duplicate, 
with coefficients of variation&amp;lt;10%. The detection 
limits (DL) for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 3, 2, 2, 
3 and 2 mg/kg, respectively.

One certified sediment reference material 
(BCR-701) was analyzed to determine the accuracy 
of the sequential extraction procedure described 
above. The certified and analyzed values and their 
recoveries at each extraction step were calculated 
with mean recoveries from 85 to 104% for Cr, 
Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The analyses of this certified 
reference material were performed in triplicate 
and of the sediment samples in duplicate, showing 
coefficients of variation&amp;lt;10%. The detection limits 
(DL) for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 
2.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively.

For the extraction procedure with a solution of 
0.5 mol/L HCl, one of the samples was spiked with 
a known amount of each metal evaluated (Cr, Cu, 
Ni, Pb and Zn) and then analyzed in triplicate, with 
average recoveries of 91-97%. The determination 
of metal concentrations in the sediment samples 
was performed in duplicate, with coefficients of

variation&amp;lt;10%. The detection limits (DL) for Cr, 
Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 2.0 and 2.0 
mg/kg, respectively.

SEDIMENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The total concentrations of metal in the Sinos 
River basin sediments were compared with the 
specific literature: taking the studied background 
concentrations (Robaina et al. 2002), average 
shale (Turekian and Wedepohl 1961), and other 
metals levels in rivers around the globe (Irabien 
and Velasco 1999, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, 
Boughriet et al. 2007, Li et al. 2009, Davutluoglu 
et al. 2011, Hang et al. 2009, Rangel et al. 2011, 
Dundar et al. 2012).

To assess the ecotoxicological implications 
of total metal concentrations in sediments, we 
considered sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) as: 
the indices established by the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment (CCME 1999) and 
the study of Long et al. (1995).

Long et al. (1995) define two sets: i) effects 
range low (ERL)/effects range median (ERM) 
and ii) the threshold effects level (TEL)/probable 
effects level (PEL). ERL and TEL indices refer to 
concentrations below which adverse effects on the 
wildlife in the sediment are unlikely and which 
would be expected only infrequently. In contrast, 
adverse effects are more likely to occur when 
metal concentrations are above ERM and PEL. 
The Canadian study reports the indices interim 
freshwater sediment quality guideline (ISQG) and 
probable effects level (PEL).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied 
to the set of variables in the sediments in order 
to estimate potential emission sources. Chemical 
variables used in PCA were selected based on the 
Pearson correlation matrix, giving rise to a set of 
synthetic variables (principal components) based 
on the interrelationships of the original data. The 

principal components selected were those that 
obtained characteristic roots &gt;1.0 after applying the 
Varimax rotation. The primary function of the PCA 
is a decrease in the number of variables while retai-
ning the original information as much as possible, 
and thus variables with similar characteristics can 
be grouped into factors. PCA was analyzed by using 
Windows SPSS version 20.0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEDIMENTS

Table III shows the general characteristics of the 
sediments. The highest sulfur levels (S) were found 
at the sites near the mouth of the Sinos River (SI 
019 and SI 008) and the Portão stream, while the 
highest organic matter (OM) were found at sites SI 
188 (16.8%) and Portão stream (15.8%). The high 
OM content observed at the source of the Sinos 
River (SI 188) can be attributed to the influence of 
well-preserved vegetation of the river margins. 
At the same place a high content of sulfur was 
also noticed, which may be locally released during 
organic matter decomposition (Neue and Mamaril 
1985). The OM is considered a metal geochemical 
carrier in some types of environments due to its 
capacity of absorbing and complexing metals of 
both terrestrial and marine origins (Salomons and 
Förstner 1984, Warren and Haack 2001).

Sinos River sediment grain is composed by 
gravel (from 0% to 75%), sand (from 16% to 98%), 
silt (from 1% to 62%) and clay (from 1% to 20%).  
The coarse sediments were found at sites SI 188 and 
Rolante River, in the upper part of the river basin, 
indicating its proximity to the bedrock. The texture 
of the sediments (Table III) was predominantly 
sand, except for site SI 028, which showed 61.7% 
of silt. According to Laybauer and Bidone (2001), 
at sites with a greater incidence of smaller particle 
sizes, which have an increase in the superficial area 
and the capacity of the cations exchange, there 
will be a tendency of metal accumulation in the

sediments. Assuming the grain composition, the 
samples were classified into gravel and sand, sand, 
mud with sand, sand with mud and mud.

Concerning mineralogical analyses, quartz, 
kaolinite and smectite are scattered over the 
entire river basin (Table III), except for kaolinite 
at the Sinos River source (SI 188). According to 
Rodrigues and Formoso (2006), sediments con-
taining smectite (expansive clays of high cation 
exchange capacity) can retain metals, which are 
subject to remobilization under changes in environ-
mental conditions. Furthermore, illite, zeolite, 
K-feldspar, and barite were also identified. These 
minerals were probably formed by alteration of 
volcanic rocks of the Serra Geral Formation and 
sandstones of the Botucatu Formation (Oliveira et 
al. 2008).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Table V shows the factorial weight matrix obtained 
from total metals concentrations in sediments from 
the Sinos River basin sampling. Factor analysis 
performed with the variables explained 43.2% for 

Factor 1, 22.9% for Factor 2 and 18.8% for Factor 3 
of total variance. These three factors explain 84.9% 
of the total variance of the data.

Factor 1 explained 43.2% of the total variance of 
the data and had positive loadings on Cu (0.813), Pb 
(0.923), Zn (0.704) and Al (0.869). This factor shows 
these metals are from electroplating industries in 
which these metals are used in deposition processes 
and beyond aesthetic reasons, where they work in 
abrasion resistance and corrosion. According to 
Factor 1, Mn (-0.763), Fe (-0.742) and Ni (-0.636) 
show negative loadings and its main reason is the 
metallurgical and steel industries. These industries 
use Mn-Fe-Ni alloys in their production processes. 
About 70 industries are located in the Sinos River 
basin, and are classified into basic metallurgy and 
they may be responsible for the heavy metals found 
in Factor 1.

Factor 2 explained 22.9% of the total variance, 
showing loadings on Cr (0.977) and OM (0.658) that 
might be identified as originating from tanneries in 
the Sinos River basin. Other papers have reported 
Cr to OM association (Rodrigues and Formoso 



An Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)

1050 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K. RODRIGUES and SILVIA B.A. ROLIM

2006, Oliveira et al. 2008, Rangel et al. 2011). This 
association is based on the sequential extraction, 
where Cr is associated to step 3 (sulfides/OM).

Factor 3 explained 18.8% of total variance, 
with positive loadings on Zn (0.658) and S (0.952). 
This leads to Zn labor in the oxidizable fraction 
(step 3) of the sequential extraction procedure such 
as sulfides, further analyzed in this paper.

TOTAL CONTENTS AND METAL FRACTIONATION

Table IV shows the results of metal concentrations 
in sediments (fraction&amp;lt;63 µm, dry weight) of the 
Sinos River and its tributaries and Fig. 2 shows 
the percentage distribution of the selected metals 
in the four geochemical sediment phases. The 
average potential availability in relation to total 
metal content, as measured by the sum of the three 
mobile phases of the BCR sequential procedure, 
showed some differences between the river basin 
subdivisions. In the upper stretch, the following 
metal sequence bioavailability was observed: Mn 
(71%) &gt; Pb (54%) &gt; Zn (26%) &gt; Cr (13%) &gt; Cu 
(12%) &gt; Ni (11%) &gt; Fe (9%) &gt; Al (5%). For the 
middle stretch, the sequence was Mn (43%) &gt; Pb 
(42%) &gt; Cu (14%) &gt; Zn (13%) &gt; Cr (12%) &gt; Ni 
(8%) &gt; Fe (5%) &gt; Al (4%). For the lower stretch, 
the sequence was Mn (76%) &gt; Zn (65%) &gt; Pb 
(51%) &gt; Cr (46%) &gt; Ni (45%) &gt; Cu (41%) &gt; Fe 
(17%) &gt; Al (4%). Some differences were observed 
in the sequence of mobility potential in the three 
parts of the river basin, so that in the lower part, 
which shows a higher concentration of industries 
and habitants, there is an increase in potentially 
mobile fractions of Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Fe.

Fe and Al showed high percentages in the 
residual phase (Fig. 2) in all basin samples, 
indicating that these elements have a low mobility 
in the environment where they are and that they are 
little affected by human activity (Li et al. 2009). 
The presence of the minerals kaolinite, smectite, 
illite, quartz (Table III) and hematite (Oliveira et al. 
2008) endorse these elements in the residual stage.

Cu total concentrations (Table IV) varied from 
69 to 121 mg/kg, and the maximum values were 
found in the Luiz Rau stream, followed by sites 
from the point SI 028 onwards. As for the potential 
mobility (Fig. 2), there is an increase onwards site SI 
066, located at the beginning of the lower part of the 
basin. The most affected site is the Luiz Rau stream 
(121 mg/kg), where the potentially mobile phases 
reached 62% of the total content. This stream receives 
all discharges from one of the main urban centers and 
around its site there are electroplating, metallurgical 
and chemical industries. Cu was extracted mainly 
in reducible (1-24%) and oxidized (6-29%) fractions 
of the sequential extraction procedure, according to 
results from other studies that evaluated urban and 
industrial influences (Davidson et al. 1994, Kubová et 
al. 2008, Davidson et al. 2006, Rodrigues and Formoso 
2006, Hang et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009, Vymazal et al. 
2010, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). In addition, a high 
percentage in the exchangeable phase (21%) was 
also observed in the Luiz Rau stream, in accordance 
to studies by Irabien and Velasco (1999), Hang et al. 
(2009), and Liu et al. (2009). The increase of Cu in 
the oxidizable stage is related to sulfur increasing (see 
Table III) in the lower of the Sinos River, indicating this 
metal appearance as sulfides. According to Pedrozo 
(2003), the copper bioavailability decreases with the 
complexities and absorption of this element to the 
organic matter/sulfur and to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides.

Zn concentrations (Table IV) ranged from 112 
to 316 mg/kg, with an increase in the lower part 
of the Sinos River basin, in particular at the sites 
of the Luiz Rau stream, SI 019, and SI 008. That 
corresponds to the low course of the river where the 
sediments are deposited due to low water energy. 
According to Horowitz (1991) and Miller (1997), 
environments characterized by calm waters and thin 
particles tend to show high metal concentration, if 
compared to deposits associated to high energy 
regimes and thicker sediments. In this same part, 
there is also an increase in the potential mobility of 
Zn (Fig. 2), which increased from about 28% (SI

188 at the source of the Sinos River) to almost 80% 
at some sites (Luiz Rau stream, SI 019, and SI 008). 
Zn was extracted mainly from the exchangeable 
(1-41%) and reducible (2-30%) phases. In Hang’s 
et al. study (2009), which evaluates the influence 
of electroplating industries, Zn was also extracted 
preferably in the exchangeable fraction. In the 
reducible step of the sequential extraction, Zn 
associated with Fe and Mn oxides, hydroxides and 
oxyhydroxides, capable of removing this metal 
from the aqueous phase (Boughriet et al. 2007), 
was also extracted mainly in this step as indicated 

by studies of Irabien and Velasco (1999), Rodrigues 
and Formoso (2006), Boughriet et al. (2007), Li et 
al. (2009), Liu et al. (2009), Vymazal et al. (2010), 
and Dundar’s et al. (2012). Besides Zn and S 
appearance at the same statistical analysis factor, 
as mentioned above, proves Zn association to the 
sulfide oxidizable fraction form.

Pb total concentrations (Table IV) ranged 
from 25.4 to 59.5 mg/kg, with highest levels found 
in the Luiz Rau and the Portão streams. The Pb 
geochemical distribution was associated with the 
reducible (19-40%) and oxidizable (10-30%) steps, 



An Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)

1054 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K. RODRIGUES and SILVIA B.A. ROLIM

indicating a potential average mobility of about 
50%. The Pb association to these phases has been 
reported by several authors e.g. Davidson et al. 
(1994, 2006), Kubová et al. (2008), Boughriet et 
al. (2007), Li et al. (2009), Vymazal et al. (2010), 
Davutluoglu et al. (2011), and Dundar et al. (2012). 
Pb oxidizable fraction presence may be due to the 
complex-metal formation with humic substances 
and/or metal sulfides insoluble in the sediments 
(Davutluoglu et al. 2011). It has also been reported 
that Pb can form stable complexes with Fe–Mn oxides 
(Ramos et al. 1994, Liu et al. 2009). Anthropogenic 
Pb contributions arise from solid waste material 
containing batteries, electronic devices with Pb/Sn 
solder, and from effluents of chemical, metal plating 
and paint industries (Tokalioglu et al. 2003, Oliveira 
et al. 2008, Dundar et al. 2012).

Total Mn concentrations (Table IV) varied a lot 
at the studied sites (397-1,901 mg/kg), especially 
at the Luiz Rau and the Portão streams, which 
showed the lowest concentrations. Mn showed a high 
degree of geochemical mobility at all sites (see Fig. 
2), which is not necessarily due to anthropogenic 
contributions, but may also be due to environmental 
and geochemical regional characteristics (Teixeira et 
al. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006). It happens 
because Mn tends to be present in thermodynami-
cally less stable phases in sediments as the exchan-
geable ion Mn2+, as easily reducible Mn oxides and 
as Mn trapped in carbonate minerals (Davidson et 
al. 1994, Robaina et al. 2002, Sakan et al. 2009). 
Mn was extracted mainly in the exchangeable (5-
54%) and reducible (11-37%) fractions and showed 
a behavior similar to that in other studies (Davidson 
et al. 1994, Hang et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009, Liu 
et al. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, Dundar et al. 
2012). Mn associated with the exchangeable fraction 
indicates that the metal is weakly adsorbed onto the 
sediment surface by relatively weak electrostatic 
interactions and that it can be easily released by ion 
exchange processes and dissociation of Mn bound to 
carbonates (Hang et al. 2009).

Total Ni concentrations (Table IV) showed no 
significant variations throughout the basin and 
varied from 35 to 54 mg/kg. With regard to the Ni 
geochemical distribution (see Fig. 2), there was 
an increase in the potentially mobile fractions of 
this metal from site SI 066 onwards. Noteworthy 
are the high rates of mobility observed for the Luiz 
Rau and the Portão streams (about 70%), probably 
in response to the wastewater from tanneries and 
electroplating industries. Ni was sequentially extrac-
ted in the three steps of the sequential extraction 
procedure: exchangeable (2-24%), reducible (2-27%) 
and oxidizable (3-24%).

For Cr, there was also an increase in total 
concentrations (Table IV) from the lower section 
of the Sinos River basin, varying between 112 
and 1,286 mg/kg. The concentration observed in 
the Portão stream (1,286 mg/kg) was higher than 
that of the other sites studied and well above the 
background level of the study area (80.3 mg/kg), set 
up by Robaina et al. (2002). As for the geochemical 
distribution of Cr, we also observed an increase 
in the potentially mobile fractions (Fig. 2) from 
point SI 066 on. Cr was associated mainly with the 
oxidizable fraction, thus evidencing its preferential 
binding to organic matter (Rodrigues and Formoso 
2006, Vymazal et al. 2010, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, 
Dundar et al. 2012). According to the data, Cr and 
OM appearance at the same statistical analysis 
factor (Table V) proves a Cr preferred association 
to organic fraction of the sequential extraction 
procedure (step 3). The preferential association 
of Cr to the oxidizable phase indicated that most 
of that metal could be retained in the sediments in 
the trivalent state, less toxic, and bound to organic 
matter (Armienta et al. 1996, Wittbrodt and Palmer 
1996). From the Portão stream, we extracted 
1,039 mg/kg in the oxidizable step, equivalent to 
81% of the total concentration of this metal. This 
high association of Cr to the oxidizable fraction is 
evidenced by the higher OM content in relation to 
other sites, see Table III. These high Cr levels are

environmental markers of effluents from tanneries, 
as already reported by Rodrigues and Formoso 
(2006) and Oliveira et al. (2008), and they possibly 
reflect the influence of around 40 tanneries located 
in that region (FEPAM 2006).

In the present study, we found that the lower 
stretch of the Sinos River basin was the most 
affected area. Robaina et al. (2002) have already 
indicated that the sediments from the Luiz Rau 
stream were strongly affected by Cr (up to 1,050 
mg/kg), Cu (up to 900 mg/kg), Zn (up to 3,000 mg/
kg), Pb (200 mg/kg), and Ni (200 mg/kg), meaning 
highest pollution level according to the index 
adopted in that study. They also found metal levels 
in sediments of the main course of the Sinos River 
similar to those reported in this study. Oliveira et 
al. (2008) analyzed soil at two landfills near the 
Sinos River and found contamination from waste 
of leather industries and electroplating industries. 
They found concentrations of up to 1,744 mg/kg 
of Cr, 355 mg/kg of Zn, 94 mg/kg of Cu, and 44 
mg/kg of Ni. They also pointed out the high levels 
of Pb (up to 70 mg/kg), reported in the study as 
originating from the disposal of urban solid waste 
that may contain batteries, electronic devices with 
Pb/Sn solder, material colored with lead paint, and 
packaging labels.

EXTRACTION WITH 0.5 MOL/L HCl

In this study, we evaluated Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, and 
Pb potential mobile concentrations (Table IV) 
extracted by 0.5 mol/L HCl solution. As indicated 
by Sutherland and Tack (2008), it is possible 
to establish a linear regression between the 
concentrations extracted by 0.5 mol/L HCl and 
the sum of the first three steps of the sequential 
extraction procedure. The best linear regression 
was observed for Zn and is shown in Figure 3. 
Linear regressions found for the studied metals are 
shown in Table VI. All of them showed satisfactory 
r2 values: Cu (r2=0.9587), Zn (r2=0.9961), Ni 
(r2=0.9762), Cr (r2=0.9877) and Pb (r2=0.9049). 

These regression relationships are encouraging 
as the HCl leach seems to be extracting the same 
suite of phases in the sediments as the BCR labile 
approach, but not to the same extent.

Fig. 3. Correlation between the Zn concentration extracted 
from sediment samples with 0.5 mol/L HCl, and the sum 
of three labile phases extracted by sequential extraction 
procedure BCR (n = 10).

Thus, through this simple, fast (1 h) and low-cost 
extraction procedure, it is possible to identify the 
samples that show higher levels of potential mobile 
metals in sediments, derived from anthropogenic 
contributions. This screening of samples allows for a 
more careful evaluation of only the anthropogenically 
impacted samples, saving time, costs, and chemical 
reagents. However, before adopting the dilute 
HCl approach for all sediments, it is imperative to 
conduct a preliminary investigation to establish the 
degree of association between anthropogenic metals 
leached by dilute HCl and the potential mobile 
fractions liberated by the BCR approach. As an 
example, recent data from Cook and Parker (2006) 
indicates that this relationship may not hold for all 
environments. These authors found that the 0.5 M 
HCl leach removed 35 times less Pb than the sum of 
the first three steps of the optimized BCR procedure 
for canal sediment contaminated by waste from a 
metal processing plant in France.

that were found in rivers by different experts. It 
also compares the background contents under 
the studies (Robaina et al. 2008) and the average 
shale (Turekian and Wedepohl 1961). Cr, Cu and 
Zn average concentrations, 254, 87.5 and 206 
mg/kg, respectively, show concentrations above 
the taken area background and the average shale. 
The concentration intervals for these metals were 
similar to those found by Irabien and Velasco 
(1999), Oliveira et al. (2008), Li et al. (2009) 
for Zn and Cu, and Rangel et al. (2011) for Zn. 
During these studies, contaminated sediments were 
evaluated as originating from urban and industrial 
liquid waste, featuring similarities in the taken area.

Ni concentrations, average 44.0 mg/kg, were 
lower than background and shale ones. They have 
similar contents as those reported by Irabien and 
Velasco (1999), Rodrigues and Formoso (2006) 
and Rangel et al. (2011). Pb concentrations, average 
37.0 mg/kg, were lower than background ones, 
except for the Luiz Rau and the Portão streams, but 
they were higher than average shale. Above all, Pb 
concentrations were similar to Irabien and Velasco 
(1999), Davutluoglu et al. (2011) and Hang et al. 
(2009). Mn concentrations, average 1,081 mg/kg, 
were classified as lower and higher considering 
background and shale levels, respectively. It must 
be considered that the concentrations were similar to 
Rodrigues and Formoso (2006) and Li et al. (2009).

Thereby, it is also important to mention that 
Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb concentrations higher than 
the background levels found in the lower Sinos 
River are from industries, specially electroplating 
and metallurgical industries, tanneries and metal 
industries nearby, that send off liquid waste. Another 
important point to be taken into consideration is the 
number of people living in the area, and their liquid 
waste. This may also be affecting the increase of 
metal concentrations in the lower Sinos River.

Moreover, in order to evaluate sediment quality, 
Table VIII compares the average total metal con-
centration with sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) 
from Canada (CCME 1999) and with the study of 
Long et al. (1995). With regard to the Canadian study, 
it can be seen that Cu and Cr in the three stretches of 
the river basin, Zn in the upper and lower stretches, 
and Pb in the lower stretch, showed higher average 
concentrations than the interim freshwater sediment 
quality (ISQG) value. As for the probable effects 
level (PEL) criterion, only Cr, in the lower stretch 
of the basin, showed higher average concentration. 
Considering the criteria of the study by Long et al. 
(1995), we see that the average concentrations of 
Cu, Ni and Cr in the three stretches, and Zn and Pb 

in the lower stretch, were higher than the Effect 
Range Low (ERL) and Threshold Effects Level 
(TEL) concentrations. As for PEL, only the average 
levels of Ni and Cr in the lower basin were higher. 
There were no average concentrations higher than 
the effect range median (ERM) criterion. Therefore, 
based on the SQGs approach, the Sinos River basin 
would be classified as an area with free to moderate 
toxicological risk, when considering only the total 
concentration of metals, except the Portão stream, 
that showed moderate to high pollution.

CONCLUSIONS

The higher concentrations of Cr, Cu, Zn and 
Pb were observed in the lower stretch of the

Sinos River basin sediment. This region, that has 
higher population density and industrial plants 
(mainly metal works, electroplating industries, 
and tanneries), showed an increase in both the 
total concentrations (Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb) and in 
the sequentially extracted mobile fractions (Cu, 
Cr, Ni and Zn). Cr pointed out, particularly in the 
Portão stream, showed 1,286 mg/kg as the total 
concentration and 88% in the potentially mobile 
fractions, due to the influence of the local tannery. 
These pollutants are available in the aquatic 
environment due to their association with different 
sediment phases.

The sequential extraction indicated that the 
metals were associated with the exchangeable (Ni, 
Zn, Cu), reducible (Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb) and oxidizable 
phases (Ni, Cu, Cr, Pb). These results showed 
similar distribution with studies that evaluated 
sites impacted by the same anthropogenic sources. 
Regarding the sediment quality assessment, these 
regions can be classified as an area with free to 
moderate toxicological risk, except Portão stream, 
that showed moderate to high pollution.

Partial extractions are valuable tools for a 
preliminary survey, where critical contaminants 
and priority areas have to be identified. In our 
study, the potentially mobile metals extracted with 
a 0.5 mol/L HCl solution presented satisfactory 

correlation with the concentrations extracted by 
the sequential extraction scheme. Although some 
problems in the sequential extractions have not 
been fully resolved yet, the use of these procedures 
generate more complete information, enabling 
a more detailed characterization of the origin, 
chemical form, distribution, and metals potential 
availability. In this study the sequential extraction 
procedure demonstrated good reproducibility for 
the certified reference material (BCR 701) used.

Considering the factor analysis, it is possible 
to identify the main anthropogenic contributions 
in the Sinos River basin sediments. Further studies 
with geochemical focus are needed in order to 
have a better assessment of the potential retention 
and release of metals sediments, as well as to 
mineralogically feature the sediments in this area. 
Based on these studies, it will be possible to do an 
accurate assessment of the potential risk of metals 
contamination through their remobilization and the 
current condition of this study area with regards to 
these pollutants.

RESUMO

O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o teor de 
Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mn, Al e Fe e sua partição geoquímica 
em sedimentos da bacia hidrográfica do rio dos Sinos, Sul do 
Brasil. Esta bacia apresenta elevada densidade populacional 
e de indústrias, especialmente dos setores de metalurgia, 
galvanoplastia, siderurgia, petroquímica e curtumes. 
As concentrações totais de metais foram determinadas por 
fluorescência de raios-X e as concentrações nas fases dos 
sedimentos foram determinadas através da aplicação do 
esquema de extração sequencial BCR-701 proposto pelo 
Community Bureau of Reference, da Comunidade Europeia, 
utilizando ICP/OES. Também foram considerados os 
teores extraídos através de uma solução de HCl 0,5 mol/L. 
Os teores de metais foram avaliados na fração de sedimentos 
&lt;63 µm. Os resultados na região industrializada e com 
alta densidade populacional mostraram um aumento nas 
concentrações totais, para Cu, Cr, Zn e Pb, e nas frações 
potencialmente móveis para Cu, Cr, Zn e Ni extraídos 
sequencialmente. O Cr destacou-se especialmente no arroio 
Portão, apresentando uma concentração total de 1.286 mg/
kg, devido à influência de curtumes localizados nesta região.

Palavras-chave: BCR-701, metais, sedimentos, extração 
sequencial.
