A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is 

earth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his 

own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes 

which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its 

overhanging brows (Henry David Thoreau).  

 

Science is built up of facts, as a house is built of stones; but an 

accumulation of facts is no more science than a heap of stones is a house 

(Henri Poincaré). 



 

 

RESUMO 

 

Os lagos inseridos no bioma Mata Atlântica são importantes 

ecossistemas para a ciclagem do carbono podendo atuar como fontes ou 

sumidouros de carbono. Nesta tese foi abordado o metabolismo aquático 

ecossistêmico de dois lagos brasileiros, utilizando as taxas de produção 

primária e respiração, bem como o fluxo de CO2 entre a água e a 

atmosfera, para entender como as variáveis limnológicas e 

meteorológicas direcionam a dinâmica espaço-temporal do metabolismo 

ecossistêmico. Nossos resultados mostraram que a Lagoa do Peri foi 

predominantemente heterotrófica, com períodos de autotrofia em 

condições de alta temperatura e luminosidade. Analisando a dinâmica 

espacial das taxas metabólicas, a região litorânea apresentou maior 

variabilidade que a região pelágica, bem como maiores taxas de 

respiração, em função da baixa profundidade da coluna d’água, 

influência do sedimento e do ecossistema terrestre. Verticalmente 

maiores taxas de produção primária foram registradas na superfície, 

diminuindo em direção ao fundo, e as taxas de respiração mostraram 

padrão inverso. Ao longo de oito anos consecutivos observamos que a 

diminuição do nível d’água ao longo dos anos de 2012 e 2014 foi 

reflexo da baixa precipitação. Essa mudança física promoveu aumento 

na concentração de clorofila-a, nutrientes, carbono e o fluxo de CO2 para 

a atmosfera. A Lagoa Carioca também se mostrou heterotrófica e o 

fluxo de CO2 foi intensificado quando adições experimentais de matéria 

orgânica foram conduzidas em mesocosmos. Por outro lado, a adição de 

nutrientes inorgânicos resultou no aumento do O2, com diminuição do 

CO2 e alta variabilidade diária. Esta tese mostrou que o metabolismo 

ecossistêmico de lagos de Mata Atlântica é altamente dinâmico e 

predominantemente heterotrófico com diferentes variáveis sendo 

importantes nas diversas escalas espacial e temporal. Entretanto, 

sugerimos que em um lago polimítico as variáveis físicas como 

disponibilidade de luz, estabilidade térmica e profundidade da coluna 

d’água determinam a variação espaço-temporal das taxas metabólicas. 

Além disso, mudanças climáticas afetando a região tropical pode alterar 

as características limnológicas dos lagos, que por sua vez podem 

intensificar ou alterar a função dos ecossistemas na ciclagem do 

carbono.

ABSTRACT  

 

Lakes in the Atlantic Forest are important ecosystems for the carbon 

cycling and they can be sources or carbon sinks. This thesis addressed 

the aquatic ecosystem metabolism of two Brazilian lakes, using the 

primary production and respiration rates, as well as the air-water CO2 

flux to understand how limnological and meteorological variables affect 

the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystem metabolism. Our results 

showed that the Peri Lake was predominantly heterotrophic due to 

bacterioplankton. However, during high temperature and light 

conditions the lake was net autotrophic. Regarding to the spatial 

dynamics of metabolic rates, the coastal area showed higher variability 

than the pelagic area, as well as higher respiration rates, which was 

related to the low water column depth, influence of sediment and 

terrestrial ecosystem. Vertically we recorded higher primary production 

rates at surface, decreasing toward the bottom, and respiration rates 

showed the opposite pattern. Over eight consecutive years Peri Lake 

featured decrease in water level over the years 2012 and 2014 due to 

low rainfall. This physical change increased the chlorophyll-a, nutrients, 

carbon and CO2 flux to the atmosphere. Carioca Lake was also 

heterotrophic and experimental additions of organic matter promoted the 

increase in CO2, while the addition of inorganic nutrients resulted in an 

O2 increase concomitant with CO2 decrease and high daily variability in 

both gases. This thesis showed that the ecosystem metabolism from 

Atlantic Forest lakes is highly dynamic and predominantly heterotrophic 

with many variables being important in the different spatio-temporal 

scales. However, we suggest that in a polymictic lake the physical 

variables, such as light availability, thermal stability and water column 

depth, determine the spatial and temporal variation in the metabolic 

rates. In addition, climate change affecting tropical areas can change the 

limnological conditions in the lakes, intensifying or changing the 

ecosystems function in the carbon cycling.

1     INTRODUÇÃO 

A ecologia de ecossistemas busca entender a relação entre os 

organismos e o ambiente onde vivem, considerando a troca de matéria e 

energia entre eles (Townsend et al., 2010). O termo ecossistema foi 

proposto por Arthur Tansley, em 1935, embora os estudos 

ecossistêmicos remontem de datas anteriores. Inserido nessa abordagem, 

o metabolismo ecossistêmico, de ambientes terrestres e/ou aquáticos, 

envolve todos os processos de produção e degradação da matéria 

orgânica, sendo que a produção primária e a respiração são etapas do 

metabolismo ecossistêmico (Odum, 2013; Weathers et al., 2013).  

A Mata Atlântica é um dos biomas brasileiros e se extende de 

norte à sul do país, pela região litorânea, planaltos e serras do interior do 

Rio Grande do Norte ao Rio Grande do Sul. A Mata Atlântica está 

associada à mangues, enseadas, foz de grandes rios, baías, lagos e 

lagunas de clima tropical e subtropical. No entanto, a Mata Atlântica 

encontra-se altamente reduzida, no qual 88% da sua área original foi 

perdida para processos de urbanização, cultivo e extração de madeira. 

Os fragmentos remanescentes, em sua maioria são menores que 50 

hectares, e apenas 9% da mata remanescente está protegida pela 

legislação ambiental (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Importantes rios cortam a 

Mata Atlântica, como por exemplo: São Francisco, Doce, Paraíba do 

Sul, Grande, Tietê, Paraná, Iguaçu e Uruguai (Galindo-Leal e Câmara, 

2003), e sua interface com diferentes ecossistemas fazem da Mata 

Atlântica um local de elevada biodiversidade e endemismo que é foco 

dos programas de conservação.  

Os lagos são formados a partir de depressões naturais do solo que 

apresentam forma, profundidade e extensão variáveis. Podem ser 

costeiros, apresentando ou não influência marinha, ou interiores, de água 

doce (Esteves, 2011). Lagoas são geralmente corpos d’água mais rasos 

que os lagos, embora não há um limite para a classificação dos 

ambientes. Uma estimativa aponta que em todo o mundo existem 

aproximadamente 304 milhões de lagos naturais, correspondendo a 

aproximadamente 3% da superfície terrestre (Downing et al., 2006). 

Mesmo tendo pouca representatividade em extensão, os lagos são 

considerados hot spots para a produção, degradação, estocagem e 

transporte do carbono (Cole e Caraco, 2001; Tranvik et al., 2009), 

principalmente os lagos inseridos na Mata Atlântica, uma vez que 

recebem elevado aporte de matéria orgânica terrestre. A importância dos 

ambientes aquáticos de água doce na ciclagem do carbono foi estudada 

por Bauer et al. (2013), no qual estimaram que o gás carbônico (CO2) 

emitido por lagos e rios é similar ao CO2 absorvido pelos oceanos.

Os estudos sobre metabolismo aquático iniciaram com Odum 

(1956) estimando as taxas de produção primária e respiração 

ecossistêmicas em rios, através das variações diárias do oxigênio 

dissolvido (O2). A produção primária bruta (GPP; do inglês gross 

primary production) é a conversão autotrófica do carbono inorgânico em 

orgânico, e a respiração do ecossistema (R) é a oxidação do carbono 

orgânico em inorgânico por organismos autotróficos e heterotróficos 

(Staehr et al., 2012a). O balanço entre o que foi produzido e o que foi 

consumido (GPP – R) determina o metabolismo líquido do ecossistema 

aquático (NEP; do inglês net ecossystem production; Dodds e Cole, 

2007). Quando as taxas de produção primária são maiores que as taxas 

de respiração o ecossistema é classificado como autotrófico (NEP&gt;0) e 

quando a produção primária é menor que a respiração o ecossistema é 

classificado como heterotrófico (NEP&lt;0). Neste sentido, a estimativa da 

produção líquida do ecossistema, é útil para compreender a importância 

dos ecossistemas aquáticos na ciclagem do carbono e para definir o seu 

papel como fonte ou sumidouro de carbono (Lovett et al., 2006; Cole et 

al., 2007).  

Outra maneira de determinar se um ecossistema é fonte ou 

sumidouro de carbono é através da concentração de CO2 na água e o 

fluxo desse gás entre a água e a atmosfera (Cole et al., 1994). Quando a 

pressão parcial do CO2 (pCO2) na água é maior do que a observada na 

atmosfera, em torno de 387 µatm (valor médio anual dos últimos 10 

anos obtidos do NOAA, Dlugokencky e Tans, 2016), o ambiente está 

supersaturado e em geral o fluxo de CO2 é positivo para a atmosfera. Por 

outro lado, quando a concentração é menor na água que na atmosfera, o 

fluxo assume direção inversa e o CO2 é absorvido da atmosfera. Os 

estudos usando CO2 podem ser feitos através de medidas diretas desse 

gás ou de estimativas do CO2 a partir dos valores de pH e alcalinidade 

(Trolle et al., 2012; Pinho et al., 2016).  

O metabolismo ecossistêmico e seus processos de produção 

primária e respiração são dependentes de variáveis limnológicas, como 

clorofila, nutrientes e carbono orgânico, que interagem entre si e são 

influenciadas pelas condições meteorológicas, como a temperatura, o 

vento e a precipitação (Hall et al., 2015). Os nutrientes são um 

importante recurso aos organismos autotróficos, portanto, o aumento na 

concentração de nitrogênio e fósforo leva ao aumento da clorofila que 

na presença de luz e com temperatura adequada favorece a produção 

primária (Balmer et al., 2011; Pacheco et al., 2013). Ademais, os 

nutrientes também favorecem o aumento da atividade microbiana 

heterotrófica, gerando competição entre os organismos autotrótricos e 



17 

 

heterotróficos (Azam, 1998). A maior disponibilidade de carbono 

orgânico dissolvido na água impulsiona a respiração (Hanson et al., 

2003; Couture et al., 2015), bem como a temperatura e a precipitação, a 

primeira por acelerar a atividade metabólica e a segunda por conduzir 

matéria orgânica de origem terrestre para dentro dos ecossistemas 

aquáticos (Brown et al., 2004; Marotta et al., 2010). Elevada 

temperatura também promove maior estabilidade térmica da coluna 

d’água, limitando a disponibilidade de nutrientes e matéria orgânica, que 

pode resultar em maiores taxas metabólicas durante o período de 

circulação da água, uma vez que nesse período ocorre a ressuspensão de 

matéria orgânica e nutrientes das águas mais profundas (Brighenti et al., 

2015). Entretanto, durante o período de circulação pode também ocorrer 

limitação da produção primária através da diminuição da disponibilidade 

de luz na coluna d’água (Staehr et al., 2012b). 

A variação espaço-temporal dos processos metabólicos também é 

dependente de diversos fatores. A variabilidade vertical além de 

responder diretamente à disponibilidade de matéria orgânica e nutrientes 

é altamente dependente da disponibilidade de luz nos diferentes estratos 

da coluna d’água (Palmer et al., 2013; Obrador et al., 2014). Lagos com 

menor disponibilidade de luz tendem a ter reduzidas taxas de produção 

primária e com isso a respiração pode ser predominante. Por outro lado, 

luz em excesso pode causar fotoinibição nas camadas superficiais da 

coluna d’água (Staehr et al., in press). A heterogeneidade intralagunar, 

especialmente entre as zonas litorâneas e pelágicas promove diferentes 

taxas de produção primária e respiração em função da profundidade da 

coluna de água, da descarga de riachos e da presença de macrófitas 

(Lauster et al., 2006; Staehr et al., 2012c; Van de Borget et al., 2012; 

They et al., 2013). Nas áreas mais rasas, maior contribuição dos 

processos metabólicos que ocorrem no sedimento é esperada, 

aumentando a concentração de CO2 e O2 na coluna d’água (Van de 

Bogert et al., 2007). Na escala latitudinal, a temperatura exerce forte 

influência na respiração, em geral com maiores concentrações de CO2 

nos ambientes mais quentes (Kosten et al., 2010; Pinho et al., 2016).  

A variação diária da temperatura e luminosidade afeta 

diretamente a atividade metabólica dos organismos autotróficos que 

dependem da luz para a produção primária e indiretamente os 

organismos heterotróficos (Nimick et al., 2011; Marotta et al., 2012a; 

Jiang et al., 2013). Com isso, maiores taxas de respiração geralmente 

ocorrem durante o início da noite, onde a disponibilidade de matéria 

orgânica autóctone é maior (Sadro et al., 2011). A temperatura e o vento 

por sua vez podem acelerar a troca gasosa entre a água e a atmosfera por 



18 

 

influenciarem no aquecimento e resfriamento da coluna d’água ao longo 

do ciclo diário (MacIntyre et al., 2010). Variações sazonais e interanuais 

também são importantes para direcionar os padrões anuais da ciclagem 

do carbono dentro dos ecossistemas e são influenciados principalmente 

pelos padrões meteorológicos de precipitação, vento, luz e temperatura, 

que influenciam as condições de nutrientes e estabilidade térmica da 

coluna d’água (Tsai et al., 2008; Laas et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2016).  

Eventos climáticos como tempestades, tornados e secas estão 

cada vez mais frequentes e promovem distúrbios nos ambientes 

aquáticos (Kerr, 2007). No sul do Brasil o impacto dos eventos El Niño 

e La Niña Oscilação Sul alteram o padrão de precipitação, causando 

grande variabilidade interanual das condições meteorológicas (Grimm et 

al., 1998). Em anos de El Niño geralmente ocorre maior precipitação e 

períodos de seca são registrados nos anos de La Niña. O aumento da 

precipitação promove a entrada de matéria orgânica para dentro dos 

sistemas aquáticos que altera a estrutura da comunidade aquática e seus 

processos metabólicos (Figura 1). A ausência de precipitação também 

afeta as condições limnológicas por reduzir o nível d’água e com isso 

aumentar a concentração de nutrientes e clorofila, bem como alterara 

estabilidade térmica dos ambientes aquáticos (Tsai et al., 2016). A 

intensidade e a frequência com que essas condições meteorológicas 

incidem sobre os ambientes aquáticos determinam como esses 

ecossistemas irão responder biológica e metabolicamente. Essa resposta 

pode ser acessada através da resistência e a resiliência dos processos 

metabólicos ecossistêmicos (Pimm, 1984, Carpenter et al., 2001). A 

intensidade em que determinada variável muda após a perturbação 

determina a resistência do ecossistema, enquanto que a velocidade com 

que a mesma variável retorna para a condição pré-distúrbio, ou alcança 

um novo estado de equilíbrio, determina a resiliência do ambiente 

(Pimm, 1984). Determinar a resistência e a resiliência é importante para 

entender quão adaptativo é o sistema para manter suas funções 

metabólicas (Carpenter et al., 2001). Essa abordagem é uma nova 

proposta para o uso dos termos resiliência e resistência considerando os 

gases CO2 e O2 envolvidos na produção primária e respiração dos 

ecossistemas aquáticos.  

Nos últimos dez anos, determinar as variações do oxigênio 

dissolvido em tempo real e alta frequência vem mostrando maior 

precisão e confiabilidade nas taxas metabólicas estimadas (Staehr et al., 

2010). Ademais, através da alta resolução dos dados obtidos é possível 

acessar a variabilidade diária do ambiente em resposta à eventos 

climáticos que anteriormente não eram identificados nas estratégias de 



19 

 

monitoramento em baixa frequência (Jennings et al., 2012; Klug et al., 

2012). Apesar do número crescente de estudos sobre o metabolismo 

aquático, lagos tropicais e subtropicais, especialmente os brasileiros, 

permanecem pouco estudados (Marotta et al., 2009a; Kosten et al., 

2010; Brighenti et al., 2015; Cavalcanti et al., 2016; Pinho et al., 2016), 

embora sejam considerados importantes fontes de CO2 para a atmosfera.  

Raymond et al. (2013) estimaram que os lagos tropicais, 

compreendendo cerca de 2,4% da área global dos lagos, contribuem para 

34% da emissão total de carbono.

Uma revisão feita por Hoellein et al. (2013) mostra que os 

resultados obtidos sobre o metabolismo aquático podem ser valorosos 

para o gerenciamento e a restauração dos ambientes e do seu entorno. 

Portanto, em escalas regionais, é essencial determinar a importância dos 

lagos na ciclagem do carbono, bem como entender como as alterações 

do clima, da paisagem e das condições limnológicas podem afetar o 

metabolismo aquático ecossistêmico. Portanto, esta tese está estruturada 

de maneira a elucidar os potenciais fatores controladores dos processos 

de respiração e produção primária ecossistêmica em diferentes escalas 



20 

 

espaço-temporal, em ecossistemas aquáticos inseridos no bioma Mata 

Atlântica. A Lagoa do Peri, na região subtropical, e a Lagoa Carioca na 

região tropical do Brasil, são lagos oligo-mesotróficos de água doce, 

inseridos em áreas de proteção ambiental. Em geral, os lagos de Mata 

Atlântica são supersaturados em CO2 e apresentam relação direta com a 

matéria orgânica de origem terrestre, no qual a degradação dessa matéria 

orgânica é dependente da temperatura (Marotta et al., 2009b; Marotta et 

al., 2012b; Pinho et al., 2016). 

No primeiro capítulo será abordada a variação diária e sazonal na 

concentração de CO2 e sua relação com as variáveis meteorológicas e 

limnológicas, com o objetivo de determinar a influência da biomassa 

bacteriana, luz, temperatura e disponibilidade de carbono no fluxo de 

CO2 entre a água e a atmosfera. No segundo capítulo será abordada a 

importância das variáveis físicas, relacionadas à temperatura, luz, vento 

e profundidade da coluna d’água, na variação espacial das taxas de 

produção primária e respiração, através das medições de oxigênio, luz e 

temperatura em alta frequência. No terceiro capítulo, a abordagem 

envolve oito anos consecutivos de amostragens mensais, avaliando a 

dinâmica do CO2 quando alterações meteorológicas promovem 

mudanças físicas e limnológicas no ecossistema aquático. Finalmente, 

no quarto capítulo, através de um experimento em mesocosmo, será 

abordado como adições de matéria orgânica e nutrientes afetam a 

dinâmica diária do CO2 e do O2 e como essas adições podem afetar a 

resistência e a resiliência dos gases nestas diferentes condições 

aquáticas.  

Cada capítulo desta tese contém hipóteses e metodologias 

específicas. No entanto, esta tese é guiada pelas seguintes perguntas:  

- Como o fluxo de CO2 varia em um ciclo diário, em diferentes 

estações meteorológicas, e quais os possíveis fatores relacionados à 

essas mudanças na Lagoa do Peri? 

- Que fatores físicos relacionados ao vento, temperatura, luz e 

profundidade da coluna d’água tem maior influência sobre a 

variabilidade da produção primária e da respiração em duas áreas 

distintas da Lagoa do Peri? 

- Como o CO2 responde à redução da precipitação que afeta o 

nível d’água e a concentração de nutrientes e clorofila na Lagoa do Peri? 

- De que maneira adições de matéria orgânica e nutrientes afetam 

a dinâmica diária do CO2 e O2 no ambiente pelágico da Lagoa Carioca?

2     ÁREA DE ESTUDO 

Este estudo foi desenvolvido em dois lagos inseridos no bioma 

Mata Atlântica, a Lagoa do Peri e a Lagoa Carioca. A Lagoa do Peri 

(27°44’S 48°31’W) está situada em Santa Catarina e inserida na área de 

proteção ambiental do Parque Municipal da Lagoa do Peri. Esse parque 

foi criado em 1981 para preservar o maior manancial de água doce e um 

importante remanescente de Mata Atlântica Subtropical da ilha de Santa 

Catarina. A Lagoa Carioca (19°75’S 42°6’W) em Minas Gerais, está 

inserida no Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, criado 1939. Este parque é o 

maior remanescente da Mata Atlântica Tropical no Estado de Minas 

Gerais, com aproximadamente 36 mil hectares de florestas e 

aproximadamente 40 lagoas estão inseridas nessa área, correspondendo 

à aproximadamente 9,8% da área protegida.  

 

2.1 Lagoa do Peri  
A Lagoa do Peri é uma lagoa costeira subtropical de água doce, 

situada 3 metros acima do nível do mar, com o qual se conecta através 

de um canal de sentido único lagoa?mar. A lagoa apresenta área 

superficial de 5,07 km2, comprimento máximo de 4 km, largura média 

de 1,7 km, profundidade média de 4,2 m e profundidade máxima de 11 

m e é usada para abastecimento público de aproximadamente 17% da 

população residente na ilha de Santa Catarina (Companhia Catarinense 

de Águas e Saneamento – CASAN, comunicação pessoal). A bacia 

hidrográfica da Lagoa do Peri tem aproximadamente 20,3 km2, e os rios 

Cachoeira Grande (Figura 2, letra A) e Ribeirão Grande (Figura 2, letra 

B) são os principais tributários da lagoa, a qual teve seu volume 

calculado em 21,2 milhões de metros cúbicos (Laudares-Silva, 1999).  

Nas porções norte, oeste e sul a lagoa é margeada por encostas 

com alturas médias de 300 metros, encoberta por vegetação de Mata 

Atlântica em estado avançado de regeneração, e a leste é separada do 

Oceano Atlântico por vegetação típica de restinga. Chuvas ocorrem ao 

longo de todo o ano e a precipitação média acumulada entre 1992 e 

2011 foi de 1.629 mm por ano. Neste mesmo período a temperatura 

variou entre 12,0 e 27,3ºC (dados obtidos da estação meteorológica 

localizada no Aeroporto de Florianópolis, através do Instituto de 

Controle do Espaço Aéreo – ICEA). De acordo com o Instituto Nacional 

de Meteorologia, a normal climatológica de 1961-1990 foi 1.518 mm de 

precipitação média anual e a temperatura média anual foi 20,4ºC. 

Estudos prévios têm mostrado que a lagoa é polimítica e 

apresenta homogeneidade espacial para clorofila-a e nutrientes e 

característica oligo-mesotrófica (Hennemann e Petrucio, 2011; Tonetta 



23 

 

et al., 2013), mas que vem apresentando indícios de eutrofização 

incipiente, de acordo com análises do sedimento (Hennemann et al., 

2015). Apresenta elevadas densidades de cianobactérias filamentosas, 

principalmente Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) 

Seenayya e Subba-Raju, (Laudares-Silva, 1999; Silveira, 2013; Tonetta 

et al., 2013) e a comunidade de zooplâncton é composta 

predominantemente de rotíferos e cladóceros de pequeno tamanho 

(Gerzson, 2013). As taxas de produção primária planctônicas são 

menores que as taxas de respiração, em parte relacionadas à baixa 

capacidade fotossintética das cianobactérias e a limitação por luz e 

nutrientes (Tonetta et al., 2015).

2.2 Lagoa Carioca 
A Lagoa Carioca é uma lagoa oligo-mesotrófica tropical com área 

superficial de 0,14 km2, volume de 671 mil metros cúbicos e 



24 

 

profundidade máxima e média de 11,8 e 4,8 m, respectivamente (Figura 

3; Bezerra-Neto et al., 2010). É uma lagoa considerada fechada, sem 

efluentes ou afluentes e protegida do vento pela vegetação, apresentando 

assim elevada estabilidade térmica. A lagoa é classificada como 

monomítica quente com curto período de circulação (junho a agosto) 

durante o inverno e apresenta-se estratificada no restante do ano (Henry 

e Barbosa, 1989; Petrucio et al., 2006). Durante o verão a concentração 

de clorofila é em média 5,5 µg/L (3,6 – 9,0 µg/L, mínima e máxima 

respectivamente), o fósforo total é de 5,9 µg/L (5,6 – 6,1 µg/L), o 

nitrogênio total é 259,0 µg/L (246,0 – 265,0 µg/L) e o carbono orgânico 

dissolvido é em média 6,1 mg/L, variando de 5,4 a 7,1 mg/L (Brighenti 

et al., 2015).

O clima da região é definido como tropical semi-úmido com duas 

estações bem definidas: seca e chuvosa. A estação seca (maio a 
setembro) apresenta baixas temperaturas (15ºC) e reduzida pluviosidade. 

A estação chuvosa (setembro a abril) apresenta altas temperaturas 

(30ºC) e alta pluviosidade, com 80% da precipitação ocorrendo 

geralmente no mês de janeiro. A pluviosidade média anual da região é 

de 1.480 mm e a temperatura média anual é de 21,9°C.

3 MATERIAL E MÉTODOS 
3.1 Desenho amostral  

Para cada capítulo desta tese foram desenvolvidos e executados 

desenhos amostrais específicos, para atender aos respectivos objetivos e 

hipóteses. Os desenhos amostrais envolveram medidas discretas em 

escala horária no primeiro capítulo, medidas de alta frequência, a cada 

15 minutos no segundo capítulo, medidas mensais no terceiro capítulo e 

medidas diárias no quarto capítulo. A descrição detalhada de cada 

metodologia de coleta e análise está descrita em cada capítulo. Aqui 

estão apresentadas, em linhas gerais, as metodologias usadas nessa tese. 

 

3.2 Monitoramento mensal dos parâmetros físico-químicos 
Coletas mensais foram efetuadas ao longo de oito anos (2007 – 

2015) na Lagoa do Peri, nas estações destacadas na Figura 2, e 

apresentadas na Figura 4. A estação P1 foi amostrada em quatro 

profundidades de acordo com a extinção da luz: 100% de luminosidade 

incidente (superfície), 10% de luminosidade (profundidade do 

desaparecimento visual do disco de Secchi), 1% de luminosidade (três 

vezes a profundidade do desaparecimento visual do disco de Secchi) e 

zona afótica. Nas estações P2, P3 e P4 as amostragens foram conduzidas 

na profundidade de 10% de luminosidade incidente. 

Amostras de água foram usadas para determinação da 

alcalinidade, em que 50 mL da água do ambiente foi acidificada com 

ácido sulfúrico (0,01N), seguido por medições do pH com pHmetro com 

precisão de 0,01 unidades (Digimed DM-22), até o ponto final de 3,75 

(Mackereth et al., 1978). Outras alíquotas foram coletadas para a 

determinação de fósforo e nitrogênio total (Valderrama, 1981). Volumes 

conhecidos de amostra foram filtrados a vácuo e os filtros (0.7 ?m, 

Whatman GF/F) analizados para a determinação de clorofila-a de acordo 

com Lorenzen (1967). O filtrado foi usado para a determinação de 

nitrito (Golterman et al., 1978), nitrato (Mackereth et al., 1978), amônia 

(Koroleff, 1976), fósforo reativo solúvel (Strickland e Parsons, 1960) 

através de espectrofotometria; e o carbono orgânico dissolvido foi 

analisado através da combustão em alta temperatura da amostra 

acidificada (TOC-5000 Shimadzu analyzer).  

Medidas de transparência da água, temperatura, oxigênio 

dissolvido, condutividade e pH foram feitas in situ, com sonda 
multiparâmetros. Os valores de precipitação, velocidade do vento e 

temperatura do ar foram fornecidos pelo ICEA e os dados de nível da 

água da Lagoa do Peri foram fornecidos pela CASAN.

3.3 Estimativa da pressão parcial e do fluxo de CO2 
A concentração de CO2 na água da Lagoa do Peri foi estimada a 

partir dos valores de pH e alcalinidade, de acordo com Stumm e Morgan 

(1996). Constantes de equilíbrio e especiação para o carbono inorgânico 

foram corrigidas para temperatura e a força iônica foi estimada a partir 

da condutividade elétrica (Snoeyink e Jenkins, 1980). O fluxo de CO2 na 

interface água-ar foi estimado com base na equação 1 (Stumm e 

Morgan, 1996), que usa o coeficiente de transferência de gás (k), 

baseado na velocidade do vento (K); difusão química (?); e a diferença 

entre a concentração de CO2 na superfície da água a na atmosfera (em 

µmol L-1; Cole e Caraco, 1998). A pressão parcial do CO2 (pCO2) foi 

calculada a partir da constante da lei de Henry (KH), com correções para 

temperatura e salinidade (Weiss, 1974): 

 

????(??? ??
?????) = ? . ? .  ([???(??)] ?  ?? .  ????(???)) (1) 

 



27 

 

Para os valores de equilíbrio do CO2 com a atmosfera foram 

usados os dados obtidos do observatório de Mauna Loa, Hawaii 

(Dlugokencky e Tans, 2016), uma vez que para águas doces os fluxos 

calculados a partir do pH e alcalinidade são menos sensíveis às 

variações da pressão atmosférica do CO2.  

 

3.4 Monitoramento em alta frequência 

Para as medidas de alta frequência, uma estação de 

monitoramento foi montada no ponto central da Lagoa do Peri, com 

profundidade total de 7 metros (Figura 5a).  

 

Figura 5: Estação de monitoramento utilizada na amostragem de alta 

frequência das variáveis limnológicas e meteorológicas (a). Em b o 

desenho esquemático da disposição dos sensores no ar e na água.

Sensores de temperatura da água e radiação ativa 

fotossinteticamente – PAR (UA-002 HOBO® ± 0.53°C) foram dispostos 

na subsuperfície, 0,5 m, 1,0 m, 1,5 m, 2,0 m, 3,0 m, 4,0 m, 5,0 m e 6,0 

m de profundidade. Um sensor de oxigênio dissolvido (MiniDO2T
®), 

com precisão de ± 5% para o oxigênio dissolvido e ± 0,1ºC para a 

temperatura, foi colocado na subsuperfície da coluna d’água e outro a 

1,0 m de profundidade (zona eufótica), juntamente com um sensor de 

pressão barométrica (U20-001 HOBO® ±0,3%). Outro sensor de 

oxigênio dissolvido foi colocado a 5,0 m (zona afótica; Figura 5b). No 

ar, foram instalados sensores para velocidade do vento (S-WSB-M003 

HOBO® ±1,1m/s), PAR (S-LIA-M003 HOBO® ±5 µmol/m2/s) e 

temperatura do ar (HOBO® ±0,2°C). Todos os sensores foram 

programados para fazer as medições a cada 15 minutos, durante 24 

horas e sete dias por semana. Mensalmente os sensores foram limpos e 



28 

 

os dados foram coletados. O intervalo sem medições, entre as coletas, e 

erros nas medições foram corrigidos através de verificação visual e 

gráfica, seguida por interpolação dos dados faltantes. 

  

3.5 Estimativas da produção primária e respiração do ecossistema  

As taxas de produção primária bruta (GPP), respiração (R) e 

produção líquida do ecossistema (NEP) foram calculadas de acordo com 

Obrador et al. (2014), a partir das medições de oxigênio dissolvido a 

cada 30 minutos, nas diferentes profundidades e expressas em mmol 

O2/m
3/h. Este modelo inclui os processos biológicos de produção e 

consumo do oxigênio, trocas físicas entre a água e a atmosfera e entre as 

diferentes profundidades (equação 2), de acordo com a profundidade da 

camada de mistura e difusividade (Staehr et al., 2012b):  

 
???(?)

??
= ???(?) +  ??(?) ? ??(?) ? ??(?) (2)  

 

As taxas do NEP(i) foram determinadas como a diferença entre 

GPP(i) e R(i) em cada profundidade amostrada (i), de acordo com a 

equação 3. Foi adotado o procedimento de modelagem inversa (Hanson 

et al., 2008), que calcula a NEPi a partir da radiação fotossinteticamente 

ativa (PARi) e temperatura da água (T) em cada profundidade específica 

(i). O modelo inclui a resposta de saturação à PAR (primeiro termo da 

equação 3; Jassby e Platt, 1976), e a dependência da respiração em 

relação à temperatura (segundo termo da equação 3). PARi foi obtida de 

medidas contínuas na subsuperfície e do coeficiente de atenuação da luz 

na coluna d’água (Kd/m). Pmax é a taxa fotossintética máxima (mmol 

O2/m
3/h) na saturação luminosa, ? é a eficiência fotossintética (mmol 

O2/m
3/h/[µmol photons/m2/s]). R? é a taxa de respiração a ?ºC (mmol 

O2/m
3/h), e ? é o coeficiente da dependência térmica da respiração, 

determinado como 1,07: 

 

???(?) = ???????? (
?????

????
) ? ???

(????) (3) 

 

O fluxo difusivo entre as camadas d’água (equação 4) 

influenciada pela profundidade da camada de mistura Dz(i) foi calculada 

de acordo com Bell et al. (2006). A variação da profundidade da camada 

de mistura foi considerada em função do tempo (?Zmix/?t) e a diferença 

na concentração de O2 entre as profundidades em função da 

profundidade da camada da água (h):

O fluxo entre as camadas camadas d’água direcionada pela 

difusividade (Dv(i); equação 5) foi estimada do coeficiente vertical de 

eddy difusividade (Kv; m
2/h; equação 6) descrito por Hondzo e Stefan 

(1993). Para esse cálculo foi considerado o volume e a área do lago 

(V(i); A(i)), e o índice de Brunt-Väisälä (N

A troca de gases entre a água e a atmosfera (Ds(i); equação 7), foi 

calculada de acordo com Staehr et al. (2010). O2(i) é o oxigênio medido 

na água e O2sat(i) é a concentração em equilíbrio com a atmosfera. Ks é o 

coeficiente de troca gasosa para o O2 e Zmix na profundidade da camada 

de mistura (m), calculado em função da velocidade do vento e 

normalizado para o número de Schmidt (Sc600), de acordo com 

equações de aquecimento e resfriamento de MacIntyre et al. (2010).

3.6 Experimento em mesocosmo  
O experimento em mesocosmo foi desenvolvido na região 

pelágica da Lagoa Carioca (Figura 6). Os mesocosmos consistiram em 

sacos de polietileno de baixa densidade, transparentes, com ~ 1,5 m de 

profundidade, 1,30 m de diâmetro e cerca de 2000 litros de volume, 

fechados na parte inferior, e sem sedimento, e abertos na superfície para 

permitir as trocas gasosas entre a água e a atmosfera.  

O controle consistiu de quatro mesocosmos com as concentrações 

de nutrientes e carbono orgânico naturais da lagoa, como segue: 0,06 ± 

0,02 mg/L de nitrogênio inorgânico dissolvido (DIN = nitrato + nitrito + 

amônia); 6,70 ± 3,48 µg/L de fósforo reativo solúvel e 8,14 ± 0,37 mg/L 

de DOC. Para o tratamento +NUTRI quatro mesocosmos tiveram a 

adição de nutrientes inorgânicos (NaNO3, K2HPO4 and NH4Cl), 

resultando nas seguintes concentrações: 2,62 ± 0,17 mg/L de DIN; 

156,38 ± 25,76 µg/L de fósforo reativo solúvel e 7,81 ± 0,20 mg/L de

carbon orgânico dissolvido (DOC). Quatro mesocosmos tiveram adição 

de matéria orgânica extraída das folhas da mata próxima à lagoa (+OM) 

resultando em 0,06 ± 0,01 mg/L de DIN; 12,22 ± 0,92 µg/L de fósforo 

reativo solúvel e 8,59 ± 0,10 mg/L de DOC. Finalmente, quatro 

mesocosmos tiveram a adição de nutrientes e matéria orgânica 

(+NUTRI +OM) com o intuito de verificar o efeito combinado dessas 

adições, que resultaram em 2,57 ± 0,12 mg/L de DIN; 149,79 ± 36,90 

µg/L de fósforo reativo solúvel e 8,60 ± 0,09 mg/L de DOC. No total 

foram 16 mesocosmos conduzidos durante nove dias, com início em 20 

de janeiro de 2015.

Foram feitas medições diárias de CO2 e O2 em cada mesocosmo. 

Para os dados de oxigênio foram utilizados sensores MiniDO2T
® e para 

a pCO2 foram feitas medidas diretas usando um analisador de gás 

infravermelho (IRGA – monitor de gás ambiental EDS EGM4), no qual 

as amostras foram coletadas através da técnica de headspace (Cole e 

Caraco, 1998). Amostras de água foram coletadas a cada três dias para 

análise de nutrientes dissolvidos através de cromatografia iônica 

(Metrohm 883 Basic IC), clorofila-a (Lorenzen, 1967) e carbono 

orgânico dissolvido (TOC analyzer Shimadzu 5000A). Medidas diárias 

de temperatura da água, turbidez, pH e condutividade foram feitas in 

situ com o uso de sonda multiparâmetros (Hydrolab DS5 Hach Inc.).

5.1 Abstract  

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pCO2 and air-water 

CO2 fluxes in the surface waters of a subtropical lake vary on two time 

scales (diel and seasonally) and that CO2 concentrations would decrease 

during the day and in summer. We estimated the variability of pCO2 and 

the air-water CO2 flux from pH-alkalinity in four 48-hour periods that 

were representative of each subtropical season. There was high 

variability in pCO2 and the air-water gas flux over 48 hours, but there 
was no clear pattern between day and night. CO2 concentrations showed 

a strong positive correlation with heterotrophic bacterial biomass and a 

negative correlation with dissolved organic carbon concentrations and 

water temperature. The lake was predominantly diel and seasonally CO2 
supersaturated; the highest CO2 efflux was observed in the spring and a 

CO2 influx was observed in summer. Our hypothesis was confirmed; 

pCO2 was lowest in summer and during the daytime in spring and 

summer due to physical and biological conditions that favoured 

photosynthetic activities. These findings suggest that temporal shifts in 

the microbial community and meteorological variables, which are 

indirectly related to temperature, may be important drivers of CO2 

concentrations in Peri Lake. In conclusion, pCO2 and the air-water CO2 

flux vary temporally (diel and seasonally) in the littoral zone of this 

subtropical coastal lake, with shifts between CO2 influx and efflux 

throughout the sampling periods. 

 

Keywords: bacterioplankton, gaseous exchanges, metabolism, 

heterotrophy. 

 

5.2 Introduction  

Inland waters are highly active sites of transport, transformation, 

and storage of considerable amounts of carbon from watersheds, making 

them important systems for carbon budget studies (Tranvik et al. 2009). 

Lakes are, in general, supersaturated with CO2 in terms of equilibrium 

with the atmosphere (Cole et al. 1994; Sobek et al. 2005; Duarte and 

Prairie 2005). In recent years, tropical lakes have been considered major 

CO2 sources to the atmosphere among global lakes (Kosten et al. 2010), 

with higher variability compared to non-tropical lakes (Marotta et al. 

2009a). Myriad chemical and physical variables appear to drive this 

latitudinal CO2 concentration and flux variability, except for 

temperature. These variables include the availability of dissolved 

organic carbon (DOC) to bacterial respiration (Del Giorgio et al. 1997; 

Cole et al. 2007), lateral transport of CO2 (Marotta et al. 2010; Maberly 



40 

 

et al. 2012), wind speed, and heat loss (Read et al. 2012). In addition, 

atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns at a lake’s geographic 

location (Fontes et al. 2015), lake size (Raymond et al. 2013), and 

nutrients (Pacheco et al. 2013) are related to increases in the 

concentration of CO2 in ecosystems. 

Because pCO2 values vary more in tropical lakes (Sobek et al. 
2005; Marotta et al. 2009a), we would also expect a higher variability in 

subtropical lakes (i.e., lakes distributed between 23.4 and 30 degrees 

north and south) (Corlett 2013) compared to temperate and polar 

systems. Because the majority of time series studies are carried out in 

temperate lakes, studies in subtropical lakes are necessary to improve the 

global CO2 efflux models. Seasonality in pCO2 and air-water CO2 

fluxes, for example, has been reported in temperate lakes, in which CO2 

influx often occurs in the summer (Pinardi et al. 2014; Sejr et al. 2014) 

and higher CO2 emissions occur in winter (Trolle et al. 2012). Fontes et 

al. (2013) reported the highest CO2 concentrations in the spring and the 

lowest levels in summer in Peri Lake, but no CO2 flux was estimated. In 

their 6-year study, Fontes et al. (2015) estimated the CO2 concentrations 

and fluxes to be related to rainfall events and wind mixing. 

Metabolic processes in lakes are also known to vary over the 

course of the day; however, few studies have dealt with this variable. In 

general, the diel cycle of light and temperature affect biological activity 

and act on the regulation of metabolic processes, biogeochemical cycles 

and gas dynamics (Petrucio and Barbosa 2004; Nimick et al. 2011; Jiang 

et al. 2013). For example, community respiration is highest during the 

day through the first hours of the night and represents the response of 

bacterioplankton to labile dissolved organic carbon (Coffin et al. 1993, 

Petrucio and Barbosa 2004; Sadro et al. 2011). Biological-independent 

processes such as night-time cooling can also reflect higher air-water 

gas fluxes to the atmosphere at night (MacIntyre et al. 2010). However, 

a diel study carried out in Peri Lake in 2009-2010 reported no 

significant variations in CO2, DOC concentrations, or bacterial 

abundance when comparing morning, afternoon and night hours (Fontes 

et al. 2013), but light and dark cycles were not explored by the authors. 

Although changes in temporal patterns have been studied for several 

decades, much less is known about the diel changes in aquatic 

metabolism in subtropical lakes (Marotta et al. 2012a), and recent 

approaches have estimated aquatic metabolism from continuous 

measurements of dissolved oxygen (Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007). 

In this regard, the present study relies on a combination of efforts: 

diel and seasonal distributions of pCO2 and air-water CO2 fluxes in the 



41 

 

water-atmosphere interface of Peri Lake, a subtropical lake, during the 

four climatic seasons of one year, with simultaneous measurements of 

meteorological and limnological variables. Our main hypothesis was 

that high pCO2 and air-water CO2 flux variability would be observed on 

two time scales (diel and seasonal) in Peri Lake and that pCO2 and the 

efflux of CO2 to the atmosphere would be lower during daylight on the 

diel time scale and lower during summer on the seasonal time scale. 

 

5.3 Materials and methods 

Study area 

The study was conducted in Peri Lake, a subtropical coastal lake 

situated in the southern region of Florianópolis Island, Santa Catarina, 

Brazil (Figure 1). Peri Lake has a surface area of 507 ha, a maximum 

depth of 11 m and mean depth of 4 m; it is weakly stratified (Tonetta in 
prep.) and spatially homogeneous in terms of chlorophyll a and 

nutrients (Hennemann and Petrucio 2011; Tonetta et al. 2013). It is 

oligotrophic in nutrients (total phosphorous, 10 to 27 ?g L-1 and total 

nitrogen, 400 to 1000 ?g L-1) and meso-eutrophic in chlorophyll a 

(between 4 and 32 ?g L-1; Henneman and Petrucio 2011). Additionally, 

a cyanobacterial dominance of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii has been 

recorded since 2009 (Tonetta et al. 2013). 

Peri Lake has two main tributaries, Cachoeira Grande and 

Ribeirão Grande Streams; its watershed is within a conservation area for 

the Subtropical Atlantic Forest, and its water is used as a drinking water 

supply, providing water to approximately 17.2% of the population of 

Florianópolis Island. The weather in the area is characteristically 

subtropical, and summer months (January-March) are a slightly rainier 

than winter months (June-August) due to the influence of the South 

American Monsoon (Vera et al. 2006). 

 

Sampling design 

The sampling site was located at the littoral zone of Peri Lake at 

27º43’S and 48º30’W (~1.0 m deep) and was free of aquatic vegetation. 

Subsurface water (~0.2 m deep) was sampled at 3-h intervals during the 

day and at 6-h intervals at night for a consecutive 48 hours, which 

resulted in 13 samples per season. This same design was repeated during 

the four annual climatic seasons (austral spring, summer, autumn and 

winter) as follows: 24-Oct-2009 (spring), 11-Mar-2010 (summer), 22-

May-2010 (autumn) and 31-Jul-2010 (winter) (total n=52).

Estimates of pCO2 and air-water CO2 flux 

We estimated CO2 concentration in water from pH and alkalinity 

measurements (Stumm and Morgan 1996). Equilibrium constant for 

inorganic carbon dissolution and speciation were corrected for 

temperature (Table 4.3 in Stumm and Morgan 1996), and ionic strength 

was estimated from conductivity, using the conversion factor from 

Russell (1976) in Snoeyink and Jenkins (1980), where ionic strength is 

~1.6 x 10-5 specific conductivity (µS cm-1). CO2 flux across air-water 

interface was estimated based on the diffusive model of Stumm and 

Morgan (1996):  

JCO2(mol cm
-2 h-1) = k . ? . ([CO2(aq)] – KH 

. pCO2(air)), that uses the 

gas transfer coefficient (k) based on wind speed (k=2.07+(0.215xU1.7)), 
the chemical enhancement of diffusion (?), and the difference between 



43 

 

the equilibrium and ambient CO2 concentrations in surface water in 

µmol L-1 (Cole and Caraco 1998), which occurs at high pH and low 

wind speeds (Wanninkhof and Knox 1996). pCO2 was calculated from 
the Henry’s law constant (KH) with appropriate adjustments for 

temperature and salinity (Weiss 1974), considering equilibrium with an 

atmosphere of 384 µatm in October/2009, 391 µatm in March/2010, 393 

µatm in May/2010 and 390 µatm in July/2010 (Data from Mauna Loa 

Observatory, NOAA webpage – Tans, 2013). The model selection to 

estimate gas exchange can create uncertainty about interpretation of the 

results because the gas exchange across the air-water interface is largely 

independent of both wind speed and system size (Cole and Caraco 1998; 

Vachon and Prairie 2013). 

Limnological variables recorded in situ included water 

temperature, salinity, conductivity and dissolved oxygen using a 

calibrated multiparameter probe (model YSI-85). Meteorological 

variables obtained in situ were air temperature (estimated using a 
mercury thermometer), wind speed (estimated using an anemometer – 

Instrutherm TAD 500), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 

measured with a Li-Cor 250A radiometer with a spherical sensor). 

Rainfall was obtained from the REDEMET/Florianópolis (Rede de 

Meteorologia do Comando da Aeronáutica – Aeroporto de 

Florianópolis/ Hercílio Luz, SC), which is located near Peri Lake, and 

we calculated the accumulated rainfall back to seven days prior to 

sampling. 

pH and alkalinity were analysed immediately after sampling in 

the laboratory located at Peri Lake. pH was measured with a pH meter 

(model Digimed DM-22) with a precision of 0.01, and alkalinity was 

determined by Gran titration. Filtration was also carried out in the 

laboratory, and samples were frozen at -20°C for posterior nutrient 

analyses. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured in filtered 

(Whatman GF/F) and acidified water samples using a high-temperature 

catalytic oxidation method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 analyser 

(Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). The remaining filtered 

water was then used to determine soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; 

Strickland and Parsons, 1960), nitrite (Golterman et al. 1978), nitrate 

(Mackereth et al. 1978) and ammonia (Koroleff 1976), which were 

summed and considered as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). 

Filters (Whatman GF/F) were used to analyse chlorophyll a 

concentrations by extraction with 90% acetone (Lorenzen 1967). For the 

determination of heterotrophic bacterial biomass (HB), samples were 

fixed with para-formaldehyde and filtered onto 0.2 ?m polycarbonate 



44 

 

membrane filters. Bacterial cells were counted under epifluorescence 

microscopy following the Porter and Feig (1980) method. The 

heterotrophic bacterial density was converted into heterotrophic 

bacterial biomass by first calculating the individual cells’ biovolume 

according to Massana et al. (1997) and then applying the algorithm 

proposed by Norland (1993) that estimates the total amount of carbon 

per µm3 and consequently by cell (fg C cell-1). 

 

Statistical methods 

We tested all variables (meteorological and limnological) for 

differences among the four seasons of the year (spring, summer, autumn 

and winter) using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. When p&lt;0.05, 

Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to determine which period differed. A t-

test was used to verify differences between day (from 6:00 to 18:00 h) 

and night (from 18:00 to 6:00 h). Correlations between pCO2 and 

meteorological and limnological variables, as well as between the air-

water CO2 flux and all variables, were assessed by Pearson correlation 

analysis. Because pCO2 and CO2 flux are estimated from pH and 

alkalinity, these variables were omitted from the analysis. Empirical 

models for the variation in pCO2 were analysed by multiple regression 

analysis, in which the most influential variables were sought via a 

forward stepwise multiple linear regression with a variable retention 

criterion of p=0.05. All data were log(x+1)-transformed, and all 

analyses were performed in SPSS Statistics 19.0 (IBM Corp., NY). 

 

5.4 Results 

Meteorological and limnological variables 

The highest air temperature was observed in summer, 29ºC, while 

in spring and autumn, it was approximately 21ºC; in winter, it decreased 

to 12ºC (Figure 2a). We observed a similar pattern of water temperature, 

in which the maximum and minimum temperatures were 28ºC in 

summer and 15ºC in winter, respectively (Figure 2b). Additionally, there 

was diel variability in water temperature, with night-time cooling of the 

surface waters (Figure 2b). All detailed results regarding the 

meteorological and limnological variables can be assessed in Table 1 of 

the electronic supplementary material. 

The subsurface PAR exhibited strong variation among the 

sampling periods, which can be explained by the meteorological 

variables – the 7-day accumulated rainfall and wind speed prior to 

sampling (Table 1). Maximum PAR was measured in summer (970 

?mol m-2 s-1) and winter (900 ?mol m-2 s-1), both at midday (Figure 2c). 



45 

 

However, daytime averages were 297 ?mol m-2 s-1 in summer, 192 ?mol 

m-2 s-1 in spring, 174 ?mol m-2 s-1 in winter, and 125 ?mol m-2 s-1 in 

autumn.

radiation (PAR) at subsurface (c), and wind speed (d) measured during 

two consecutive days (48 hours) in spring, summer, autumn and winter 

in Peri Lake. Striped areas represent nighttime sampling. 

 

Wind speed also varied strongly throughout the 48 h period, 

especially in winter when it oscillated between 3 and 11.5 m s-1, 

averaging 6.4 m s-1. In summer, wind speed was lower, with a maximum 

of 2.0 m s-1 (Figure 2d). Accumulated rainfall showed that summer (170 

mm) and autumn (182 mm) were the wetter periods compared to spring 

(0.7 mm) and winter (0.4 mm) (Table 1). 

Dissolved oxygen was higher in winter and spring (Figure 3f), 

whereas pH was lower in those same periods (Table 1). Soluble reactive 

phosphorus (SRP) was low in all periods, typical of oligotrophic lakes, 

while chlorophyll a (Figure 3e) was consistent with that of meso-

eutrophic lakes. The highest nutrient concentrations occurred in autumn 

(5 µg L-1 of SRP and 45.4 µg L-1 of DIN; Figures 3a and b), whereas the 

highest DOC concentration was registered in the summer (9.0 mg L-1; 

Figure 3c). All variables (meteorological and limnological) except for 

PAR varied significantly among the seasons (spring, summer, autumn, 



46 

 

winter; p&lt;0.05), but no significant difference was observed on the diel 

scale (p&gt;0.05), except for air temperature (p&lt;0.05) (PAR was not 

included in the diel tests).

The heterotrophic bacterial biomass (Figure 3d) was lower in the 

summer (average: 51.5 ?g C L-1), and higher in winter and spring, where 

averages were 189.4 ?g C L-1 and 185.4 ?g C L-1, respectively (p&lt;0.05). 

The chlorophyll a concentration oscillated between 2 and 11.5 ?g L-1 
and was lower in spring/autumn than in summer/winter (Figure 3e; 

p&lt;0.05). 

 

pCO2 and air-water CO2 flux 

pCO2 varied significantly among the four seasons (p&lt;0.05), with 
values below atmospheric equilibrium only in summer (269 ± 120.3 

?atm; Figure 4a). In the other seasons, pCO2 was above the atmospheric 

values, with the highest average in spring (889 ± 203.4 ?atm). Autumn 

and winter were similar, with values oscillating between 473 ± 118.8 

?atm in autumn, and 476 ± 106.4 ?atm in winter. 

Regarding the diel cycle, pCO2 averaged 867.0 ?atm in the 

daytime versus 979.3 ?atm at night in spring; 250.7 and 309.1 ?atm, 

respectively, in summer; 474.4 and 471.6 ?atm in autumn; and 494.5 

and 453.8 ?atm in winter. Although spring and summer had slightly 

more pCO2 at night compared to during the day, no significant 
difference between day and night was observed (p&gt;0.05). The overall 

air-water CO2 flux was predominantly positive, and the highest efflux 

occurred in spring (0.67 ± 0.317 mmol m-2 h-1), followed by winter (0.36 

± 0.479 mmol m-2 h-1) and autumn (0.11 ± 0.133 mmol m-2 h-1; Figure 



47 

 

4b; p&lt;0.05). Summer measurements suggested a CO2 sink because a 

negative flux was recorded (-0.16 ± 0.191 mmol m-2 h-1) coupled with 

high chlorophyll a (Figure 3e), higher light availability (Figure 2c) and 
lower biomass of heterotrophic bacterioplankton (Figure 3d). Detailed 

results are in Table 1 of the electronic supplementary material.

Figure 4: Diel variation of pCO2 (a) and CO2 fluxes across air–water 
interface (b) during 48 hours in spring, summer, autumn and winter in 

Peri Lake. Striped areas represent nighttime sampling. 

 

During the 48-hour samplings, air-water CO2 fluxes were higher 

at night in the spring (0.89 mmol m-2 h-1 at night versus 0.56 mmol m-2 

h-1 during the day) coupled to a high biomass of heterotrophic 

bacterioplankton (Figure 3d). In summer, CO2 fluxes were negative (-

0.20 mmol m-2 h-1 during the day and -0.13 mmol m-2 h-1 at night). In 

other seasons, CO2 fluxes were slightly smaller at night (autumn: 0.12 

mmol m-2 h-1 during the day and 0.07 mmol m-2 h-1 at night; winter: 0.45 

mmol m-2 h-1 during the day and 0.19 mmol m-2 h-1 at night). However, 

due to the high diel variability, no significant difference was observed 

for CO2 fluxes between day and night (p&gt;0.05).

pCO2 and air-water gas flux were positively correlated with 

dissolved oxygen and bacterioplankton biomass (Table 2), whereas 

water temperature, conductivity and DOC were negatively correlated 

with pCO2 and the CO2 flux. Wind was positively correlated with the 

CO2 flux because it is used to estimate the flux, but it can also be related 

to the cooling of surface waters, which indirectly affects the gas 

exchange at the air/water interface (Table 2). The relationship between 

heterotrophic bacterial biomass and DOC with pCO2 was confirmed by 
the stepwise multiple regression analysis (Table 3), with both variables 

explaining 42% of the model of pCO2 variability.

5.5 Discussion 

The main finding of this study was that, in general, CO2 
concentrations in Peri Lake tended to increase at night and decrease in 

the summer due to its limnological and meteorological characteristics, 

resulting in undersaturated pCO2 and CO2 influx in this season. Our 

results also highlighted the importance of the inverse relationship 

between heterotrophic bacterioplankton and organic carbon, which 

contribute to the CO2 variability in Peri Lake. Therefore, the high 

variability recorded in both pCO2 and air-water CO2 flux over 48 hours 

cannot be ignored, as it can create misunderstandings or an 

underestimation of metabolic rates in lakes. 

The diel variability in bacterial production dependent on primary 

production is well known, with increasing values during the day until 

the first hours of the night when they start to decrease to minimum 

values (Petrucio and Barbosa 2004; Panzenbock 2007). This dependence 

is due to the labile DOC releases by photoautotrophs during the day, 

resulting in decreased respiration at night and a minimum at dusk when 

DOC becomes limiting to heterotrophic bacteria (Sadro et al. 2011). In 



50 

 

Peri Lake, we observed a distinctive diel pattern in spring/summer 

compared to winter/autumn, in which pCO2 was clearly lower during the 

day in spring and summer. Prokaryotes dominate phytoplankton in Peri 

Lake, with filamentous cyanobacteria (primarily Cylindrospermopsis 

raciborskii) comprising more than 90% of the total phytoplankton 

abundance in the lake year round, even at 6 m depth (Tonetta et al. 

2013). The optimal growth of C. raciborskii is 25-30°C (Briand et al. 

2004; Chonudomkul et al. 2004), and one would therefore expect higher 

CO2 fixation at this temperature, which is often in summer. 

Peri Lake is predominantly CO2 supersaturated (Tonetta et al. in 

press; Fontes et al. 2015; and this study) with at least one period of 
influx (summer). The pCO2 concentrations and CO2 flux can also be 

regulated by meteorological factors such as turbulence in the water 

column caused by advection or wind shear (MacIntyre et al. 2010; Read 

et al. 2012). The complex interactions among all of the possible driving 

factors are better explained when long time series studies are 

maintained. In a 6-year study, Fontes et al. (2015) observed that peaks in 

pCO2 were related to rainfall events and that the highest values were 

observed in the transition periods of spring/summer to autumn/winter, 

and vice-versa. However, the periods of higher rainfall investigated in 

this study were not enough to explain peaks in pCO2. 
Concentrations of CO2 in the surface waters of Peri Lake may 

have increased from a deepening of the mixed layer or from sediments 

via physical processes (such as wind and convection), without changing 

the rates of respiration in the water column (Marotta et al. 2009b; 

Marotta et al. 2012b; Marotta et al. 2014). Thus, turbulence is important 

to potentially increasing pCO2 in surface waters and consequently fluxes 
to the atmosphere. Horizontal transfer of CO2 from western streams to 

the east side of the lake by the larger wind fetch can be another source to 

the littoral zone. The opposite, undersaturation of surface pCO2, can be 

related to higher stabilization of the water column and decreased fluxes 

(MacIntyre et al. 2010) that are caused by surface heating, which is 

more common in summer and retards the intrusions of CO2 from the 

bottom waters or sediments to the surface. In this way, temperature can 

also have an indirect relationship with CO2 by influencing the water 

stratification dynamics, as shown by Fontes et al. (2015), who observed 

a weak stratification in the summer. In other seasons, CO2-enriched 

waters are most likely brought up from the bottom to the surface. 

Over the four seasons, we observed a predominant CO2 efflux 

related to a higher biomass of heterotrophic bacterioplankton, indicating 

that their biomass can also be added to the surface by turbulence. A 



51 

 

smaller bacterial biomass in the summer can be explained by 

stabilization of the water column and increasing competition for 

nutrients with phytoplankton (Fontes and Abreu 2009). In Peri Lake, 

higher PAR, chlorophyll a and DOC in the summer, summed to a higher 

abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria (Fontes et al. 2013; Tonetta et 

al. 2013), reinforced the existence of competition among microbes in the 

lake. 

In conclusion, undersaturation and CO2 influx was observed only 

in the summer. This was likely related to the summer conditions of 

higher water stratification and light incidence. The diel patterns in the 

CO2 flux and pCO2 in Peri Lake are similar to those found in northern 
temperate systems. A switch from predominantly atmospheric CO2 

emissions during most of the seasons to an atmospheric CO2 sink in the 

summer, as observed in Peri Lake, has also been reported in other lakes 

(Fan et al. 2005; Xing et al. 2005; Trolle et al. 2012). Our results 

highlight the importance of heterotrophic bacterial biomass to pCO2 
variability in the oligotrophic Peri Lake, the necessity for further studies 

on diel and seasonal variability of pCO2 concentrations associated with 

physical mechanisms of water column mixing and the integration of 

sediment-water interface incubations in lakes.

6.1 Abstract 

We investigated the importance of meteorological and lake 

physical conditions for temporal, horizontal and vertical differences in 

the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) and water temperature, and 

the derived daily estimates of gross primary production (GPP), 

ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP). Our 

study was conducted in a subtropical and polymictic lake in Southern 

Brazil, during a spring-summer transition. Metabolic rates were 

determined from two sites using the open water oxygen technique. At 

the central deep site, oxygen sondes were deployed at three depths to 

assess patterns in vertical variability. During 10 days, an additional DO 

and temperature sonde was placed near the shoreline allowing us to 

compare metabolic differences in the surface layers between the central 

pelagic and littoral site. While GPP was similar, R was significantly 

higher at the shallower littoral site, causing NEP to be lower, although 

NEP was still positive. The littoral site had less diel changes in DO and 

higher daily variability in all metabolic rates. Variability in GPP and R 

at the littoral site was related to temperature, wind speed and rainfall 

suggesting that short-term variability in metabolic rates in shallow areas 

are sensitive to resuspension of sediments caused by a less stable water 

column. A clear vertical gradient was furthermore found for the 

metabolic rates at the central deep part of the lake, related to the light 

extinction, with highest GPP around 0.3 m and decreasing with depth, 

while respiration showed the inverse pattern. Below subsurface, 

respiration prevailed at 5.0 m depth and was uncoupled to primary 

production. Under conditions with high light and temperature, and low 

wind speeds, the mixing depth became shallower, in turn increasing the 

water column stability at the deep pelagic site, which resulted in higher 

mean light available and higher GPP in the water column. Our results 

confirm that deployment of sensors in different sites and depths allows 

for spatially, as well as temporally more representative estimates of lake 

metabolism.

6.2 Introduction 

Dissolved oxygen (DO) is used to determine ecosystem 

metabolism, which is an integrated descriptor of the production and 

degradation of organic matter in lakes (Del Giorgio et al., 1999; 



60 

 

Carignan et al., 2000; Cole and Caraco, 2001). The balance between 

gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) results in 

the net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP – R), defining the 

environment as net autotrophic, when NEP is positive, or net 

heterotrophic, when NEP is negative (Cole et al., 2007; Staehr et al., 

2010a; 2012a). The respiratory part of carbon cycling in lakes is greatly 

dependent on organic matter produced by primary producers, which in 

turn are sustained by inorganic matter mineralized by heterotrophic. 

This makes the GPP and R highly interdependent and well-correlated in 

aquatic systems (Cole et al., 2000). In eutrophic lakes, GPP and R are 

generally strongly correlated, since the organic matter from autotrophic 

production sustains the respiration rates. On the other hand, in 

oligotrophic lakes, the GPP is low and respiration typically depends on 

external inputs of organic matter (Hanson et al., 2003). In this way, the 

coupling between GPP and R depends on many external and internal 

variables from lakes, and the inputs from terrestrial environment and 

sediment can exert high influence in respiration, making the processes 

less coupled (Solomon et al., 2013). In recent years, several 

improvements have been made to estimate metabolic rates (Staehr et al., 

2010a). The high frequency measurements of DO in free-water has 

brought new insights and understandings about the spatial and temporal 

variability in the aquatic ecosystems (Laas et al., 2012; Staehr et al., 

2012b).  

Many variables have been related to the spatial and temporal 

variability of the metabolic processes (Van de Bogert et al., 2012). 

Oxygen dynamics in lakes are under the influence of different benthic 

substrate types, wind speed and direction, presence of macrophytes, 

inputs from streams, and the surrounding terrestrial vegetation, which 

may affect the distribution of nutrients and organisms in the water 

column, consequently influencing the spatial heterogeneity (Laas et al., 

2012; Muduli et al., 2012; They et al., 2013). Wind, light and 

temperature are associated to the vertical distribution of nutrients and 

organisms in water column (Serra et al., 2007). Littoral areas, in general 

shallower and protected by hills, can exhibit different gaseous flux 

dynamics (Cole and Caraco, 1998; Vachon et al., 2010) and generally 

are more influenced by benthic processes, terrestrial inputs and 

macrophytes than pelagic waters (Lauster et al., 2006; Staehr et al., 

2012c). Rainfall events can promote increase in organic matter into 

lakes from terrestrial sources, leading to high respiration rates, 

especially at littoral waters, in turn promoting CO2 efflux to the 

atmosphere (Rantakari and Kortelainen, 2005; Fontes et al., 2015). 



61 

 

Consequently, higher spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability are 

expected at littoral areas (Obrador and Petrus, 2013). 

On a daily basis, temperature and light have a strong variation 

and influence the biological activity, consequently in the 

biogeochemical process (MacIntyre et al., 2010; Nimick et al., 2011; 

Jiang et al., 2013), and therefore daily changes in DO (Hanson et al., 

2006). Shallow areas are more susceptive to this short-term variability 

since the low depth and proximity of sediments has a strong effect on 

water column conditions. In a study during 48 hours in a subtropical 

lake, Tonetta et al. (2015a) have recorded that the daily CO2 dynamics 

was highly variable and related to organic carbon availability and 

bacterioplankton, but no spatial variation was studied by the authors. In 

another shallow subtropical lake, however, They et al. (2013) found 

spatial variability between pelagic and littoral areas, where lower 

respiration rates were recorded at littoral areas, related to the 

macrophytes presence. In this way, more studies in subtropical areas are 

needed to fill the gaps of this knowledge and to understand how both 

spatial and temporal variation are related to physical conditions in 

shallow subtropical lakes.  

Significant vertical variability in DO and metabolic rates may 

occur in lakes where thermal stratification and mixing events influence 

the vertical transport of DO, nutrients and organisms in the water 

column (Lewis, 2010; Obrador et al., 2014). In stratified lakes, nutrients 

and organic matter are concentrated in the deepest part of the lakes, 

while light availability is high at the shallowest part (Sadro et al., 2011; 

Coloso et al., 2011). Consequently, net autotrophy occurs in the photic 

zone, net heterotrophy in the layers below the photic depth, and the 

metalimnion can be net auto- or heterotrophic depending on physical 

and limnological conditions (Staehr et al., 2012b). However, vertical 

patterns are very sensitive to short-term physical forcing influencing 

availability of inorganic, organic resources and light, as well as vertical 

and horizontal gas-exchanges (Staehr et al., 2010a). In a recent study 

from stratified tropical lakes, Brighenti et al. (2015) showed that 

metabolic rates were higher during the full mixing than during the 

stratified period. On the other hand, studies in temperate lakes have 

shown reduced rates of GPP and R during full mixing (Staehr et al., 

2012b) and prevalence of heterotrophy when become stratified (Obrador 

et al., 2014).  

In shallow lakes, vertical stratification can occur frequently, 

depending upon the balance between temperature driven gradient 

differences and mixing by wind (Rueda and Schladow, 2009). Peri 



62 

 

Lake, considered a shallow subtropical lake, under high seasonal 

variability, has a distinctive pattern of short-lived stratification. This 

ephemeral type of stratification and water column mixing may occur 

within hours, causing upwelling of waters rich in nutrients and organic 

matter, or just inorganic sediment and sand particles. Deployment of 

sensor recording DO at different depths and different places in a lake, 

makes possible to evaluate the importance of such ephemeral events on 

rates of primary production and respiration, thus providing more 

representative estimates of lake metabolism.  

In this study, we estimated the GPP, R and NEP rates in a 

subtropical coastal lake at two sites (littoral and pelagic) to assess the 

horizontal variability, and in three depths at the pelagic site (subsurface, 

1.0 m and 5.0 m depth) to assess the vertical variability, as well as the 

temporal variability. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree 

of spatial variability in volumetric metabolic rates in both pelagic and 

littoral sites. Furthermore, we evaluate how meteorological and lake 

physical conditions (rainfall, temperature, wind speed, light availability, 

and water stability), are related with metabolic variability, during a short 

period in spring-summer transition. We hypothesize that diel changes in 

DO and related rates of GPP will be highest near the surface, and 

decrease with depth as levels of light and temperature decreases and 

becomes less variable. In addition, we expect that GPP and R will be 

strongly coupled at subsurface and uncoupled at bottom waters, where R 

will prevail due to low light conditions. Finally, we expect that higher 

metabolic rates and higher day-to-day variability will occur at the 

shallower littoral site due to greater influence of sediment resuspension 

and respiration, and inputs of organic matter from the nearby terrestrial 

environment, resulting in uncoupled relation between GPP and R. 

 

6.3 Material and Methods 

Study site 

This study was conducted in Peri Lake (27°44'S and 48°31'W), 

Southern Brazil. Peri Lake is a freshwater coastal lake, area of 5.07 km2, 

average depth ~ 4 m, and maximum depth ~ 11 m, in a protected area of 

the Secondary Atlantic Rainforest, with a restricted human occupation. 

The lake is the main freshwater resource on the Santa Catarina Island 

(Figure 1), and it is characterized by macrophytes presence in southern 

littoral of the lake, where are located the two main tributaries (Cachoeira 

Grande and Ribeirão Grande Streams).

letter A represents the littoral station, with 2.0 m depth, and the letter B 

represents the pelagic station sampled, with 7.0 m depth. Adapted from 

Fontes et al. (2013). 

 

Important changes in Peri Lake have been recorded in recent 

years, as result of decrease in rainfall and water level (Fuentes and 

Petrucio, 2015). The chlorophyll a, mostly composed by filamentous 

cyanobacteria – Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, and the pCO2 have 

increased and water transparency has decreased, but, dissolved nutrients 

remain in low levels (Hennemann et al., unpublished data). 

Additionally, a long-term study has shown a slight difference between 

littoral and pelagic sites to some variables, e.g higher dissolved organic 

carbon, lower chlorophyll a and pCO2 at littoral areas (Tonetta et al., 

unpublished data). During our study (October, 2014 – January, 2015), 

the lake had total phosphorus and nitrogen around 11.0 µg L-1 and 0.9 



64 

 

mg L-1, respectively, water transparency ~ 1.0 m, and chlorophyll a 

around 20.9 µg L-1. Dissolved organic carbon concentration was around 

6.0 mg L-1, and higher concentration was recorded in November/14 

(10.9 mg L-1).  

 

Study design  

Continuous measurements of water temperature and DO in free-

water were made with MiniDO2T loggers® during 84 days in spring-

summer transition at 10-15 min intervals, from October 22, 2014 to 

January 13, 2015. Loggers were placed at three depths (subsurface, 1.0 

m and 5.0 m depth), at the pelagic – central point of the lake, with 7.0 m 

total depth (Letter B, Figure 1). We will refer to subsurface, to the 

sondes placed just under the surface, around ~ 0.3 m depth, in both 

pelagic and littoral sites. During 10 days, November 08-17, 2014, one 

additional logger was deployed at subsurface (~ 0.2 – 0.3 m) of the 

littoral site, with 2.0 m total depth (Letter A, Figure 1). Wind speed and 

air temperature were measured at 15 min intervals at the central part of 

the lake.  

Underwater light conditions were measured at subsurface, 1 and 2 

m depth, using underwater HOBO® light sensors. Photosynthetic active 

radiation (PAR) measurements in lux units were converted to µmol 

photons m-2 s-1 (Sager and McFarlane, 1997), to estimate the daily 

vertical light attenuation coefficient (Kd), the mean daily available light 

(Emean) in the upper mixed layer, and the photic zone depth (Zeu).  

Additionally, temperature measurements at the central part, from 

HOBO® loggers placed at subsurface, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.0 m depth were 

used to calculate the water column stability index (N2) and depth of the 

upper mixed layer (Zmix). Light and DO loggers were cleaned and 

downloaded approximately every 25 days and no biofilm accumulation 

was observed. 

 

Meteorological and lake physical conditions 

 The daily vertical light attenuation coefficient (Kd m
-1) was 

determined as the slope of a linear regression model of natural logarithm 

of irradiance (Ez, 400 – 700 nm) versus depth (z) as ln(Ez) = b + Kd z. 

We calculated the Kd daily mean using measurements every 15 min, 

between 12:00 and 13:00 h, where slopes from regression with R2 &amp;lt;0.8 

were excluded. The depth of the photic zone (Zeu) was calculated for 

each day as 4.6 divided by Kd. 

  The mean daily available light at the upper mixed layer (Emean, 

mol photons m-2 d-1) was estimated according to Staehr and Sand-Jensen 



65 

 

(2007), as: ????? =
?0 (1??)(1??

???????)

(??????)
, where E0 is the mean daily 

light available at the surface, ? is a constant (0.1), Kd is the vertical light 

attenuation coefficient, and Zmix is the depth of epilimnion. 

We assessed the water column stability index (N2) each 30 min, 

from a temperature profile, by using the Brunt-Väisälä buoyancy 

frequency, which indicates the stratification strength (Read et al., 2011). 

The Zmix depth was also determined at 30 min intervals, where Zmix 

corresponds to the depth of epilimnion, which means the shallowest 

depth with a water-density gradient equal to or above a suitable 

threshold ~ 0.03 kg m-3 m-1 (Staehr et al., 2012b). Daily rainfall and air 

temperature were obtained from Instituto de Controle do Espaço Aéreo 

(ICEA), located 7 km away from the lake. 

 

Metabolic rates  

 Data treatment prior to metabolism calculations included simple 

linear interpolation to correct the readings between intervals of 

downloaded data, to fix the outliers, and to obtain all variables every 30 

min, followed by a temporal smoothing of the time series at each depth 

through a running average of 4 h. 

We estimated gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) 

and net ecosystem production (NEP) for each depth according Obrador 

et al. (2014), which includes biological fluxes, air-water gas exchange 

and DO exchange between depth layers driven by mixed-layer 

deepening and eddy diffusivity (Staehr et al., 2012b). The model 

assumes that the DO change between two consecutive time steps, in a 

given depth layer (i), as described by Eq. (1):  
?O2(i)

?t
= NEPi + Dz(i) ? Dv(i) ? Ds(i) (Eq. 1); where NEPi is the 

net ecosystem production, Dz(i) is the flux between layers driven by 

mixed-layer deepening, Dv(i) is the flux between layers driven by eddy 

diffusivity, and Ds(i) is the air-water gas exchange, all expressed in mmol 

O2 m
-3 h-1. 

Metabolic rates were calculated using an inverse modeling 

procedure (Hanson et al., 2008), which calculates NEPi from 

photosynthetically active radiation (PARi) and temperature at each 

specific depth i. The model includes a saturating response of 

photosynthesis to PAR (Jassby and Platt, 1976) and a thermo-dependent 

respiration, as described by Eq. (2):  

NEPi = Pmaxtanh (
?PARi

Pmax
) ? R30?

(Ti?30) (Eq. 2); where Pmax is 

the maximum photosynthetic rate at saturating light (mmol O2 m
-3 h-1), ? 



66 

 

is the photosynthetic efficiency (mmol O2 m
-3 h-1 [µmol photons m-2 s-1]-

1), R30 is the respiration rate at 30ºC (mmol O2 m
-3 h-1), and ? is a 

coefficient that stands for the thermal dependence of respiration (set to 

1.07). PARi was obtained from continuous subsurface PAR 

measurements and from the light-attenuation coefficient in the water 

column (Kd m
-1). The first term in Eq. 2 corresponds to gross primary 

production (GPPi, mmol O2 m
-3 h-1), which is dependent of the light, and 

the second to ecosystem respiration (Ri, mmol O2 m
-3 h-1), which is 

dependent of the temperature, for each depth layer. NEP was calculated 

as the daily difference between GPP and R (NEP = GPP – R, using 

positive values to R). Further details in Obrador et al. (2014). 

A model combining Eqs. (1) and (2) was fitted to the DO data for 

24 h periods using a numerical minimization algorithm in the non-linear 

function in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software. Thus, by 

fitting the model to the observed DO time series at each depth, we 

obtained, for every 24 h and every depth layer, estimates of the 

parameters Pmax, ?, and R30. We calculated hourly metabolic rates for 

each depth (i; NEPi, GPPi, and Ri, in mmol O2 m
-3 h-1) by applying the 

parameters. The daily metabolic rates (in mmol O2 m
-3 d-1) were 

calculated as the average hourly rates multiplied by 24 h. To the littoral 

site, we applied the same approach, using the Zmix, light and wind 

conditions from the central part of the lake, but considering the total 

depth as 2 m.  

We assessed how the predicted DO fit to observed DO data 

through the coefficient of determination (R2). Days with R2 &amp;lt;0.4 were 

excluded from further analyses, as visual inspections of daily DO time 

plots showed these to be noisy, unrelated to diel patterns in light and 

temperature condition and with a poor match between predicted and 

measured DO values, implying a strong influence by non-biological 

processes not  included in our model (Eq. 1). For the 84 days of this 

study, 92% of the days at subsurface satisfied the model requirements, 

87% at 1.0 m depth, and just 56% at 5.0 m depth. The excluded days 

were replaced by interpolation from two days before and two days after, 

when they did not represent more than 20% of variation among these 

days. The metabolic rates are showed as weekly mean and standard 

deviation, however we omitted the metabolic rates from week 42, at 5.0 

m depth, because the R2 between the predicted DO and observed DO 

values, were &amp;lt;0.4 and we did not have previous days to compare the 

variability. Respiration rates are shown as negative values to ease 

interpretation, and for the statistical analysis, R values were considered 

positive. 



67 

 

 

Limnological conditions 

We took water samples monthly at four depths (subsurface, 1.0 

m, 3.0 m and 5.0 m depth), at central part of the lake, and filtered in 

Whatman GF/F for analysis of nitrite (Golterman et al., 1978), nitrate 

(Mackereth et al., 1978) and ammonia (Koroleff, 1976), which were 

summed and considered as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Soluble 

reactive phosphorus (SRP) was determined according to Strickland and 

Parsons (1960), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in TOC analyzer 

(Shimadzu TOC-5000A). Chlorophyll a (chla) was extracted with 80% 

ethanol, corrected for pheophytin (Lorenzen, 1967).  

 

Data analysis 

We used the repeated measurements analysis of variance 

(RM_ANOVA) to identify significant difference in metabolic rates 

(GPP, R and NEP)  among depths and sites, considering the successive 

sampled days, followed by Bonferroni t-test (p&lt;0.05). To identify 

significant difference in limnological conditions among depths we used 

analysis of variance (ANOVA). If there was a significant difference 

among depths (p&lt;0.05), Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to determine 

which depth was different.  

Pearson correlation analyses was performed between daily 

metabolic rates (GPP, NEP and R) and physical conditions over the 

course of 10 days to the littoral site and 84 days to the pelagic site, 

considering only the subsurface rates, to identify how these variables 

affect the metabolism at both sites. The physical conditions considered 

were water temperature, wind speed, rainfall, light (PAR, Emean and Zeu), 

Zmix, and N
2. To achieve the requirement for parametric tests (normal 

distribution and equally of variances) all data were log(x+1)-

transformed. 

We fitted linear regression models to each depth and site, to 

describe the coupling between R and GPP from R2 values, and to 

determine the background respiration level from intercept on the y-axis. 

We used the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test differences in 

slopes among regression lines, from the three depths sampled at the 

pelagic site. All statistical tests were performed using the R 

Development Core Team (2011).

During the studied period (October 22, 2014 to January 13, 

2015), the environmental conditions were within the typical range of 

spring and summer in subtropical areas. Wind speed was on average 3.8 

m s-1 (Figure 2a); air temperature was around 24ºC (17.9 – 35.5ºC), and 

the accumulated rainfall during 84 days was 212.9 mm. The high 

average light attenuation (Kd = 1.13 m
-1) caused a strong vertical 

gradient in light, from on average, 74 µmol photons m-2 s-1 at 

subsurface, to on average, 24 µmol photons m-2 s-1 at 1.0 m and at 5.0 m 

depth the light was around 0.36 µmol photons m-2 s-1 (Figure 2b).  

From October to beginning of December water temperatures were 

very similar among the depths (Figure 2d), but in the transition from the 

middle of December to January water temperatures increased (Figure 

2d), consistent with the beginning of summer and increases in air 

temperature. The higher temperature and lower wind speed (Figure 2a) 

promoted warmer superficial waters compared to the bottom waters, 

which promoted the increase in vertical stratification in oxygen 

saturation (Figure 2c). In December we recorded higher accumulated 

rainfall, corresponding to 60% of the rainfall recorded in the 84 days 

studied. Most of the rainfall was recorded after December 15th, 

explaining the drop in PAR in this period (Figure 2b).

Oxygen saturation and water temperature also decreased with 

depth (Figures 2c and d). The temperature contour plot showed 

consistent daily changes in temperature with frequent changes in Zmix, 

where most of the time the lake was completely mixed (71%), 

undergoing ephemeral stratification especially during the final warm 

period (Figure 3). The Zeu varied between 3 and 6 m (average 4 m), and 

was shallower than Zmix during 83% of the time, suggesting that primary 

production at 5.0 m was strongly light limited. Additionally, the low 

wind speeds in the last three weeks contributed to decrease in Zmix and 

increase in the mean daily available light (Emean); and the water stability 

(N2). Rainfall and wind speed showed negative correlation with the 

water stability, while positive correlation was found with water 

temperature (Table 1).

Vertical variability in metabolism and limnological conditions 

Estimates of GPP were the highest near the surface and decreased 

with depth. Conversely, R was the lowest at subsurface increasing with 

depth. The balance between GPP and R resulted in net autotrophy near 

the surface (just two days were slightly negative NEP), and predominant 

net heterotrophy at 1.0 and 5.0 m depth (Table 2; Figure 4). The day-to-

day variability in respiration was higher at 5.0 m depth (overall SD = 

22.43 mmol O2 m
-3 d-1 vs 14.38 mmol O2 m

-3 d-1 at subsurface), and 

similar to 1.0 m depth (SD = 20.30 mmol O2 m
-3 d-1), however no 

significant difference was found in day-to-day variability of R (p=0.12) 

and NEP (p=0.49). Additionally, GPP showed a higher coefficient of 

variation at 5.0 m depth (Table 2), resulting in a significant difference 

among the days (p&lt;0.001), and a tendency to increase at all depths, 

during the last three weeks of the studied period (Figure 4). 

Limnological conditions were quite similar among depths, and we 

recorded low dissolved inorganic nitrogen at 1.0 m and low soluble 

reactive phosphorus at 5.0 m depth. Conversely, the same depths 

presented slight higher chlorophyll a concentration, and dissolved 

organic carbon showed higher values at subsurface and 1.0 m depth, 

even though all variables were not significant among the depths 

(p&gt;0.05; Table 3).

Horizontal variability in metabolism 

Both littoral and pelagic sites showed the same daily pattern of 

DO and temperature with increases during daytime and decreases after 

sunset (Figures 5a and b), with similar coefficient of variability, even 

though the pelagic site was slightly warmer and DO saturated (Table 4). 

GPP was similar between the pelagic and littoral subsurface sites 

(p=0.55), while R and NEP showed significant difference (p&lt;0.001), 

with much higher R at the littoral site and consequently significantly 

lower NEP (Figures 5c and d). All days were net autotrophic at the 

pelagic site, while negative NEP occurred in two days at the littoral site, 

coinciding with periods of high rainfall and wind speed, and lower 

temperatures. Additionally, the littoral site showed higher day-to-day 

variability to metabolic rates than the same days in the pelagic site 

(Table 4; Figures 5c and d).

Drivers of R and GPP  

GPP and R rates were correlated at subsurface (R2= 0.39; 

p&lt;0.05), decreasing at 1.0 m (R2= 0.25; p&lt;0.05) and 5.0 m depth (R2= 

0.05; p&lt;0.05), where the background respiration was the highest (Figure 

6; Table 5). However, at the littoral site the coupling between R to GPP 

was stronger than at pelagic site (R2= 0.42; p&lt;0.05) and presented low 

background respiration (Table 5). The slope of the R vs GPP was not 

significantly different between subsurface and 1.0 m depth (p=0.97), 

while at 5.0 m depth the slope was negative and was significant different 

from the subsurface (p=0.001).

At the pelagic site, the strongest correlations observed to GPP 

were with Zmix (r=-0.40; p&lt;0.05) and water stability (r=0.37; p&lt;0.05). R 

was significant only with rainfall (r=-0.25; p&lt;0.05). Light, represented 

by PAR and Emean, and water temperature showed weak positive 

correlations with GPP (Table 1). High R rates at the littoral were 

recorded in days with rainfall, even though this correlation was not 

significant (r=0.31; p&gt;0.05); suggesting that rainfall exerted direct 

influence in respiration at littoral areas, since at the pelagic area, this 

relationship was negative (Table 1). The more important correlations to 

GPP and R at the littoral site were with water temperature, wind speed 

and Zmix, all negatively correlated, although not significant (Table 1).

6.5 Discussion  

Vertical and horizontal variability in metabolic rates 

Using high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen and 

temperature, we observed significant vertical variability in metabolic 

rates despite the homogeneous conditions of dissolved organic carbon, 



77 

 

nutrients and chlorophyll a in the water column. This suggest that 

vertical differences in GPP and less in R were influenced by decreasing 

light levels and periodic water column stratification patterns. GPP rates 

were however similar between the subsurface (~ 0.3 m) and 1.0 m depth, 

which both were above the ephemeral stratification layer.  

In monomictic or dimictic systems with well-defined mixing 

periods, changes in stratification usually has a strong impact on rates of 

primary production due to depletion of nutrients during summer, while 

respiration and primary production are strongly influenced by intrusion 

of bottom waters rich in DOC and nutrients. GPP and R can therefore 

vary significantly from day-to-day during transition from stratification 

to full mixing depending on the magnitude of mixing, the quantity and 

quality of the DOC, and nutrient inputs (Staehr et al., 2012b; Brighenti 

et al., 2015). The efficient deep and frequent mixing events in Peri Lake 

is very likely to promote light limitation of primary production, and 

introduce organic matter for elevated respiration, although inputs of 

nutrients-rich bottom waters into the surface layers may also stimulate 

photosynthesis here (Staehr et al., 2010b). Calm weather conditions 

which favor a stable water column and lasting stratification, will on the 

other hand promote settlement of particles, which increases light 

availability and is expected to raise primary production. Much of the 

observed variability in GPP is therefore likely caused by wind driven 

changes in water column stability and stratification especially at deeper 

waters, where most of light is more limiting. While the ephemeral 

stratification adds a large day-to-day variability in metabolic rates from 

Peri Lake, the coefficients of variability at the subsurface, were lower 

(GPP, CV = 33 %) in comparison to found by Van de Bogert et al. 

(2012) (GPP, CV = 65 % in Sparkling Lake); and Staehr et al. (2010b) 

(GPP, CV = 95 and 66 % in Slotssø and Gribssø Lakes, respectively). 

The predominant net autotrophic condition at subsurface, 

changed at 1.0 m depth, where net heterotrophy occurred on several 

days, reaching constantly negative NEP values at 5.0 m depth. This 

vertical pattern is similar to those observed for relatively turbid 

polymictic lakes (Staehr et al., 2012b; Obrador et al., 2014), but differs 

from clear-water lakes, where the light penetrates below the mixed layer 

depth, increasing the primary production in deeper waters (Coloso et al., 

2008). The net autotrophic at subsurface from Peri Lake was consistent 

with findings in Tonetta et al. (2015a), estimating CO2 flux over 48 h, 

where under summer conditions (high temperature and light) the lake 

was net autotrophic. The vertical gradient in the balance between GPP 

and R is also related to restrictions on the photosynthetic capacity of 



78 

 

phytoplankton by light and to some degree nutrients (Kehoe et al., 2015) 

combined with more homogeneous distribution of R (Coloso et al., 

2008; Staehr et al., 2012b; Obrador et al., 2014).  

Our results also confirm previous findings using bottles 

incubation, where the highest primary production was recorded at 

subsurface, decreasing with depth (Tonetta et al., 2015b). Furthermore, 

the authors presented that the highest respiration rates occurred at 1.0 m 

depth, and did not increase with depth, showing a more homogeneous 

condition to the pelagic metabolism along the different depths. 

Comparing both methodologies, bottle incubations and free-water, is 

possible to infer that the high respiration near the bottom indicates the 

importance of other process, especially benthic processes. In some lakes, 

benthic processes can account for ~ 40% of epilimnetic GPP and R, but 

it depends on the lake area and depth, and the influence of wind speed 

promoting sediment resuspension (Van de Bogert et al., 2007). The 

sinking of particulate matter produced in the shallow waters may cause 

respiration to increase with depth (Staehr et al., 2010b), and the elevated 

R at 5.0 m, despite of lower DOC concentrations, suggests a strong 

influence from benthic respiration. The relative importance of benthic 

and pelagic processes however, needs to be confirmed by benthic 

chamber-based measurements of metabolism.   

Peri Lake had overall high wind speeds (mean of 4 m s-1) during 

our measurements, which should efficiently mix the lake both vertically 

and horizontally. According to Van de Bogert et al. (2007), the high 

wind velocity was responsible to the low variability in GPP and R 

among sites, and 2.75 m s-1 was set up as a threshold to this 

homogeneity. The horizontal homogeneity was observed in the near 

surface rates of GPP, which were similar between littoral and pelagic. 

Respiration rates were on the contrary significantly higher at the littoral 

site, suggesting either elevated influence from benthic processes at the 

shallower littoral site or elevated R at the littoral site due to inputs of 

organic allochthonous material carried by rainfall, as supported by 

slightly higher DOC concentrations at the littoral compared to the 

surface pelagic site. 

 

Coupling between R and GPP  

The similar slope in the coupling R vs GPP, observed between 

subsurface and 1.0 m depth, in Peri Lake, implies that respiration was 

equally dependent on the photosynthetically active phytoplankton under 

high light conditions at these depths. Elevated respiration observed 

below the photic zone is dependent on a combination of organic matter 



79 

 

from terrestrial origin, as well as sinking of autochthonous matter, and 

sedimentation of algal particles (Reynolds, 1989), resulting in a negative 

and different slope from the other depths sampled. We expect that the 

high level of mixing observed in Peri lake contributed to much of the 

variation in DO observed at the 5.0 m depth, although other processes, 

such as sediment respiration or groundwater intrusion may also be 

important (Kling et al., 1991; Fontes et al., 2015). The proximity with 

the bottom of the lake is therefore likely to promote noise in the DO 

signal here. We investigated how much the physically driven vertical 

fluxes in DO could influence the NEP estimates in each depth strata. 

Overall, the air-water exchange and vertical flux driven by eddy 

diffusivity (Ds and Dv, respectively) were more important than the flux 

driven by mixed-layer deepening (Dz), but still the biological processes 

accounted to 52% of the NEP at subsurface, where Dv contributed 36%; 

44% at 1.0 m depth (Ds contributed 36%); and biological processes 

accounted to 84% at 5.0 m depth. This implies that the predominant and 

stable respiration rates and the light limited and low primary production 

at 5.0 m depth, with most of the days with no GPP or close to zero, 

resulted in R uncoupled to GPP. 

In studies across gradients in trophic status, Solomon et al. (2013) 

suggested a R-GPP slope around 0.8 and 1.0 for oligotrophic systems, 

and lower values in eutrophic systems. We found slopes around 0.65 in 

the near surface waters, which implies in a system near to eutrophic 

conditions. This confirms a recent study which based on sediment cores 

analyses (Hennemann et al., 2015), showed that Peri Lake is developing 

towards a more eutrophic status. 

A higher slope of 0.73 was found at the littoral site, where the R 

and GPP were highly correlated. At this site, the GPP were very similar 

to R rates, mean 46.8 and 40.8 mmol O2 m
-3 d-1, respectively. This 

substantial increase in R at the littoral site in relation to the pelagic site, 

suggests that more carbon to respiration is available at the littoral, since 

similar GPP rates were found in both sites, which suggests this carbon is 

allochthonous. According to Lisboa et al. (2014) higher allochthonous 

organic matter inputs from the catchment area, in Peri Lake, occur 

during rainfall periods, and DOC concentration from a monitoring 

program has shown that the littoral site has slightly more DOC than 

pelagic (around 4.43 and 4.30 mg L-1, respectively). Additionally, we 

observed that during the few days sampled at littoral site, elevated GPP 

and R occurred in days with rainfall, suggesting that rainfall could 

provide nutrients and organic matter into the system, by external 

influence or resuspension. 



80 

 

Temporal variability  

Several factors may have added observed higher temporal 

variability in GPP and NEP at the littoral site, such as macrophytes 

presence (Obrador and Petrus, 2013; They et al., 2013); sediments 

heterogeneity (Lauster et al., 2006); wind speed creating spatial 

patchiness of nutrients and organisms (Van de Bogert et al., 2012), and 

rainfall introducing allochthonous organic matter (Marotta et al., 2010). 

Our methodology, however, did not allow us to access the direct 

importance of these variables for the observed temporal variability 

observed. However, our correlation analysis suggested that rainfall, 

wind speed, temperature and Zmix had some influence on the elevated 

rates of littoral respiration.  

Higher temporal variability in Zmix, Zeu and N
2, were observed 

under stronger winds and heavier rains, conditions which correlated with 

higher day-to-day variability in in metabolic rates. An interesting result 

emerged from the last week of sampling, where PAR and wind speed 

tended to decrease, due to the rainfall days, and temperature increased, 

which boosted the strength and duration of stratification of the water 

column. These changes promoting a shallower mixing depth, and 

particles settlement, besides the warmer water column, which favored 

the higher light available in deeper waters, consequently the GPP tended 

to increase in all depths sampled during this period. This behavior in 

GPP showed a tendency of the lake to be more autotrophic during the 

beginning of the summer. Opposite result was found by Obrador et al. 

(2014), when net heterotrophy increases when the lakes became 

stratified.  

Our findings in Peri Lake showed that periods with full mixing 

were characterized by lower GPP, suggesting an impact of resuspended 

particles from bottom waters. Furthermore, during low wind speeds, 

there is a shallower mixing depth, and the more stable water column 

reduces resuspension of sediment and improves the water clarity, 

favoring the increase in phytoplankton productivity (Brookes et al., 

2013; Woolway et al., 2015). The positive effect of water column 

stability was, however challenged in a recent study from stratified 

tropical lakes (Brighenti et al., 2015). Here we showed that metabolic 

rates were lower during the fully mixing than during the stable stratified 

period, as observed in temperate lakes (Staehr et al., 2012b). 

As previously discussed, we observed no direct effect of DOC 

concentration on R when considering the vertical gradient at the center 

of the lake. However, some interesting findings emerged for the 

temporal variability. For instance, in November, DOC reached 11 mg L-



81 

 

1, compared to an average level of 4-5 mg L-1. The elevated DOC levels 

during weeks 48 and 49 coinciding with a slightly increase in respiration 

at 1.0 m depth, from on average 45 mmol O2 m
-3 d-1 during week 47, to 

70  mmol O2 m
-3 d-1 during week 49. High variability respiration may 

furthermore be related to high variability observed in nutrients, 

chlorophyll a and DOC quality (Hanson et al., 2003), however, further 
sampling of these conditions are needed to confirm such relationships.  

 

6.6 Conclusion  

We found considerable spatial variation in lake primary 

production and respiration, governed by gradients in light, organic 

matter and proximity to land. During a short period in spring-summer 

transition, GPP was similar between littoral and pelagic areas, but 

respiration was higher at the near shore littoral site. At the center of the 

lake, we found a clear vertical gradient for the metabolic rates, with 

highest GPP and net autotrophy occurring near surface, and decreasing 

with depth, due to the light extinction. On the other hand, respiration 

increased with depth, where the bottom waters were predominantly net 

heterotrophic, suggesting a greater influence of benthic processes on the 

DO dynamics.  

The nutrients, carbon and chlorophyll a concentrations in Peri 
Lake were similar among the depths sampled, suggesting a stronger 

importance of the physical conditions in driving the metabolic 

variability. Temporally, under high light and temperatures, and low 

wind speeds, the mixing depth became shallower, water column stability 

as well as the light availability increased in the water column, promoting 

higher GPP. Our results supports previous findings that complex models 

with greater integration of physical and limnological processes are 

needed, to better identify the underlying drivers of short-term temporal 

variability, in lakes with intense mixing regime (Coloso et al., 2011). 

Deployment of sensors in different sites and depths are therefore needed 

to obtain spatially, as well as temporally, more representative estimates 

of lake metabolism.

7.1 Abstract 

Lakes are important sites for carbon cycling and sensitive to 

environmental changes. We investigated the implications of low rainfall 

and reduced water level for changes in nutrients and chlorophyll-a in a 

subtropical lake, and how these changes affected the dynamics of CO2. 

Based on eight consecutive years of monthly monitoring of pH, 

alkalinity, oxygen and temperature we calculated the pCO2 and CO2 
flux. Peri Lake featured reduction in rainfall in 2012 causing 0.36 m 

lower water level during that year. Low water level in the following 

years together with increases in chlorophyll-a and organic carbon 

reduced the water transparency leading to predominant CO2 emission to 

the atmosphere. Our analyses suggest that changes in water level 

strongly affected levels of organic carbon, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, 

which in turn enhanced CO2 air-water fluxes. Additionally, a 

generalized linear model showed that nutrients and temperature with 

one-month time lag provided a useful tool to predict changes in CO2. 

The predicted pCO2 values were similar to the observed in 2015 and 

showed the predominant CO2 supersaturation in Peri Lake. We conclude 

that meteorological conditions such as low rainfall significantly enhance 

the CO2 flux through changes in the water conditions.

7.2 Introduction 

Biogeochemical changes associated with inputs and turnover of 

nutrients and carbon from the watershed can effectively change the net 

balance between primary production from autotrophic organism, and 

respiration from heterotrophic organisms (Cole et al., 2007). The 

metabolic activities are important for the processing of organic matter in 

lakes, which are known to be hot spots for production, degradation, 

storage and release of carbon (Tranvik et al., 2009). The balance 

between uptake and release of CO2 reflects if the ecosystem is a net 

source or sink of carbon in relation to the atmosphere (Cole et al., 2007). 

CO2 supersaturation in lakes is assumed to be the result from higher 

biological processing of organic matter, by respiration, over primary 

production, typical condition for lakes that receive allochthonous 

organic matter to sustain high respiration rates (Duarte &amp;amp; Prairie, 2005).  

Other processes, however, can contribute to the CO2 

supersaturation in water, such as photooxidation (Granéli et al., 1996), 

CO2 production in sediments (Duarte &amp;amp; Prairie, 2005), weathering of 



89 

 

minerals in the catchment area (Marcé et al., 2015), mineralization of 

organic carbon from terrestrial sources (Maberly et al., 2012), and CO2 

from soil respiration (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2015). Therefore, aquatic 

systems and its metabolic rates are very sensitive to physical and 

chemical changes in the surrounding watershed (Williamson et al., 

2009). 

A few variables are expected to strongly influence the metabolic 

activity and the level of CO2 saturation in lakes. Dissolved organic 

carbon (DOC) represents direct effects on bacterial respiration and 

photochemical oxidation of organic matter, and indirectly influence on 

the light availability for primary producers (Kirk, 1994; Sobek et al., 

2007). DOC is either produced within the ecosystem (autochthonous) or 

imported via rainfall or as particles from the watershed (allochthonous), 

and the amount and lability of DOC has been found to affect the net 

carbon balance in aquatic ecosystems (Rantakari &amp;amp; Kortelainen, 2005; 

Muduli et al., 2012). During summer, the high light and temperature, 

together with inputs of nutrients increase primary production, thus lakes 

with high phosphorus, are often chlorophyll-a rich, and undersaturated 

in CO2 (Balmer &amp;amp; Downing, 2011; Trolle et al., 2012; Jones et al., 

2016). Other factors influencing CO2 supersaturation include wind 

speed, which affects the gas exchange between water and air (Vachon &amp;amp; 

Prairie, 2013), and the size of the lake (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2015). 

Small lakes can present higher respiration than primary production, as 

observed by Staehr et al. (2012), or, in other cases undersaturation can 

be observed in small environments, as highlighted by Jones et al. (2016), 

studying the influence of morphology and hydrology in carbon fluxes.  

Although tropical and subtropical areas are understudied 

compared to temperate and boreal lakes, it is possible to describe some 

overall conditions determining the level of CO2 saturation in tropical 

lakes. For example, Pinho et al. (2016) in a study compiling several 

Brazilian systems found no correlation between DOC and pCO2, 

suggesting the temperature influence in the biological processes and 

importance of other CO2 sources to warm tropical lakes as recorded in 

boreal lakes (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2015). Other studies have shown the 

rainfall influence the aquatic metabolism through inputs of organic 

matter which stimulate respiration (Marotta et al., 2010a; Pacheco et al., 

2015), while inputs of nutrients, mainly from anthropogenic activities, 

decrease the CO2 concentration by increasing primary production 

(Pacheco et al., 2013; Peixoto et al., 2013). Besides the observed high 

CO2 variability in tropical lakes, these systems generally contribute with 

high CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (Marotta et al., 2009). Raymond 



90 

 

et al. (2013) estimated that tropical lakes consist in 2.4 % of the global 

lake area and contribute for 34 % of the global lake carbon emission. 

Since tropical lakes are exposed to higher sunlight incidence and present 

different physical and biological dynamics than temperate lakes 

(Schiemerand &amp;amp; Boland, 1996), it is important to understand the 

importance of environmental drivers of CO2 fluxes and carbon cycling 

in tropical lakes.  

Changes in rainfall and temperature, associated with climate 

changes, are likely to affect several physical conditions in lakes (Roland 

et al., 2012). In the southeastern part of Brazil, expectations are for 

decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures (IPCC, 2014). This 

combination will likely reduce water levels and warm the waters with 

potential effects on biological communities’ structure and functions 

(Yvon-Durocher et al., 2010; Jeppesen et al., 2015). The overall aim of 

this study is to investigate the effects of changes in rainfall, temperature 

and water level on water chemistry (nutrients, DOC and chlorophyll-a) 

and CO2 dynamics of a subtropical coastal lake in Brazil. We tested the 

hypothesis that reduction of rainfall causes a decrease in pCO2 and CO2 

flux due to related changes in water level and nutrients. Additionally, we 

predicted the pCO2 values for the coming years comparing with 

observed values in Peri Lake. 

 

7.3 Material and Methods  

Study site 

This study was performed in Peri Lake (27°44'S and 48°31'W), 

with a surface area of 5.07 km2, maximum depth of 11 m and mean 

depth of 4 m. The lake is situated in the southern region of Santa 

Catarina Island, Brazil, in a protected area of the Secondary Atlantic 

Rainforest, with low human impact – only recreational activities are 

allowed in a restrict area. Peri Lake has two main tributaries (Cachoeira 

Grande and Ribeirão Grande streams), and one channel (Sangradouro 

river) connecting the lake with the ocean, where there is no direct 

influence of the sea in the water lake (Fig. 1).  

The lake is a freshwater system (salinity of zero and conductivity 

around 70 µS cm-1), with vertical light attenuation coefficient around 1.1 

m-1, mean daily available light around 0.01 mol photons m-2 d-1, 

euphotic zone and mixing zone depths around 4.1 m and 6.0 m, 

respectively (Tonetta et al., 2016). Peri Lake is the main freshwater 

resource in Santa Catarina Island, and small stands of aquatic 

macrophytes are present in littoral area, near the outfall from Cachoeira 

Grande and Ribeirão Grande streams. The most frequent and abundant 



91 

 

species are Schoenoplectus californicus, Nymphoides indica, Panicum 

sp., Typha sp. and Echinochloa polystachya (in situ observation).

Sampling  

We collected water samples monthly, in the morning (9:00–11:00 

local time, UTC/GMT -3 h) to avoid any bias from daily variations in 

our data set, from March 2007 to February 2015, totalizing 96 months 

and 600 samples, including vertical and horizontal samplings.  

We collected water from four depths in central part of the lake, 

with 8.2 m total depth, according to light extinction (surface 

representing 100% of the light incident; 1.0 m depth representing 10% 

of the light incident; 3.0 m representing 1% of the light incident and 6.0 

m depth representing the aphotic zone). Additionally, from March 2007 

to March 2013, we collected water samples at 1.0 m depth, from stations 

near the outfall of the streams Cachoeira Grande (2.9 m total depth) and 

Ribeirão Grande (2.2 m total depth), but free of macropytes; and near 



92 

 

the recreational area (1.5 m total depth). Except for CO2 flux, which was 

estimated only from the surface samplings at the central part of the lake, 

the monthly values shown in the graphs represent the mean of all depths 

and sites sampled in one month, since the analyses of variance showed 

no significant difference among depths and sites (ANOVA, p=0.92). 

Hennemann and Petrucio (2011) conducting analyses of variance to 

chlorophyll-a and nutrients observed no significant difference among the 

same sites sampled in this study. Additionally, in a recent work, Tonetta 

et al. (2016) and Hennemann and Petrucio (2016) have shown the 

constant mixing of the lake and no vertical significant variation in 

chlorophyll-a, organic carbon and nutrients. 

 

Analytical methods 

Water temperature and dissolved oxygen were recorded in situ at 
all sites using a calibrated probe (model YSI-85). At the same time, the 

water transparency was determined by Secchi disk. Three liters of lake 

water were collected at each sampled site, and filtered through glass 

fiber filters (0.7 ?m, Whatman GF/F) for extraction of chlorophyll-a 

with 90% acetone, corrected for pheophytin (Lorenzen, 1967). DOC was 

determined in acidified water samples using a high-temperature catalytic 

oxidation method on a TOC-5000 analyser (Shimadzu Scientific 

Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). Total nitrogen and total phosphorus were 

determined from unfiltered waters according to Valderrama (1981). 

We obtained meteorological data from ICEA (Instituto de 

Controle do Espaço Aéreo), located 7 km away from the lake, and water 

level from CASAN (Companhia Catarinense de Água e Esgoto). Daily 

measurements were used to estimate the monthly-accumulated rainfall 

(mm), and monthly mean water level, from March 2007 to February 

2015. 

For estimates of pCO2 in the water, we determined alkalinity 

through titration of 50 mL of lake water, adding sulfuric acid 0.01N and 

using a pHmeter (model Digimed DM-22). Equilibrium constants for 

inorganic carbon dissolution and speciation were corrected for 

temperature (Stumm &amp;amp; Morgan, 1996) and ionic strength was estimated 

from conductivity (Snoeyink &amp;amp; Jenkins, 1980), where ionic strength is 

~1.6 x 10-5.specific conductivity (µS cm-1). The average pH from our 

data set was around 7.0 and only 7.5% of the samples showed pH lower 

than 6.0. In those cases, we excluded and interpolated the missing values 

to avoid CO2 overestimates (Abril et al., 2015). We calculated pO2 from 

temperature and dissolved oxygen (Garcia &amp;amp; Gordon, 1992) to evaluate 

the relationship with pCO2.  



93 

 

CO2 flux across air-water interface was estimated based on the 

diffusive model of Stumm &amp;amp; Morgan (1996): JCO2(mol cm
-2 h-1) = k . ? . 

([CO2(aq)] – KH 
. pCO2(air)) in order to determine if the lake was a source 

or sink of carbon. The model uses the gas transfer coefficient (k) based 

on wind speed (k=2.07+(0.215xU1.7)), the chemical enhancement of 

diffusion (?), estimated from water temperature, pH, ionic 

strength, and wind speed (Bade &amp;amp; Cole, 2006), and the difference 

between the equilibrium and CO2 concentrations in water surface in 

µmol L-1 (Cole &amp;amp; Caraco, 1998). Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory 

were used to access the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Dlugokencky &amp;amp; 

Tans, 2016).  

 

Statistical analyses 

The sites and depths sampled in one month were considerated 

replicates to comparisons among months and years and ANOVA was 

conducted with data log (x+1) transformed. When significant, the 

differences were tested with post hoc Tukey-HSD test for multiple 

comparisons (n=600; significance level at p&lt;0.05). A Pearson 

correlation analysis was performed to all variables log (x+1) 

transformed to identify how these variables affect each other and CO2 

flux, using only data from surface samples (n=96). A linear regression 

was performed between pCO2 and pO2 to determine the coupling 

between both gases.  

Generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted to examine the 

potential association of pCO2 with limnological and meteorological 

variable along the eight years of the study. We included the effect of the 

variables considering one-month lag time, where we investigated how 

the variable measured in the previous month could affect the pCO2 in 

the next month. We applied the probability distribution model Gamma, 

with a log link function, which relates the mean value of one variable to 

its linear predictor (Crawley, 2012), using the mass package for model 

selection based on AIC (Venables &amp;amp; Ripley, 2002). A pseudo-

determination coefficient (pseudo-R2) was calculated to examine the 

fraction of the total variability explained by the selected model. This 

coefficient was calculated as 1 – (residual deviance/null deviance) 

according to Zuur et al. (2009).  

The pCO2 time series from March 2007 to February 2015 was 
used to predict pCO2 values for 2015 and 2016 based on forecasting 

from ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving averages) using the 

forecast package to predict potential changes in next years (Hyndman, 
2016). The predicted values were plotted together with the values 



94 

 

observed from pH and alkalinity along 2015-2016, which were not 

included in our results description and previous analyses. 

 

7.4 Results  

Water temperature varied monthly from 18.0 ± 1.58 ºC (mean ± 

standard deviation) in July to 28.2 ± 0.87 ºC in February, but with no 

significant difference between annual mean temperatures among years 

(p&gt;0.05; Table 1). Rainfall however, differed significantly among years 

(p&lt;0.05; Figure 2a), with the highest accumulated rainfall in 2011 with 

2,197 mm; and the lowest in 2009 and 2012, 945 and 939 mm, 

respectively. In general, June was the driest month with 63 ± 36 mm, 

while January was the wettest (213 ± 157 mm). The low rainfall levels 

occurring during 2012 was identified as responsible for the reduction of 

0.36 m in the water level of Peri Lake, as compared to 2011, which was 

the year with the highest water level (2.82 m; p&lt;0.05). The water level 

remained low during 2013 and 2014, which also had low annual 

rainfalls (Figure 2b).

During years of low rainfall and water level we also observed less 

transparent waters, especially during the dry 2012 (0.77 ± 0.14 m; 

Figure 2c), constrasting with the highest water transparency in 2010 

(1.11 ± 0.10 m; p&lt;0.05). CO2 fluxes were generally positive except for 

2009 where negative fluxes occured (-0.20 ± 0.35 mmol m-2 h-1). CO2 

outgassing increasing significantly along the years with the highest flux 

measured in 2013 (1.76 ± 1.91 mmol m-2 h-1; p&lt;0.05; Figure 2d). 

Considering monthly variations in CO2 fluxes, these were generally 

lowest in November (0.1 ± 0.57 mmol m-2 h-1) and highest in August 

(2.3 ± 3.42 mmol m-2 h-1). Overall, Peri Lake showed positive CO2 flux 

in 65 % of the months sampled.  

pCO2 was highly variable monthly (36 – 10,337 µatm; p&lt;0.05) 

and was predominantly above the equilibrium with atmosphere (390 

µatm; Figure 3a). Only during 2009, the pCO2 values were 
predominantly below atmospheric equilibrium (232 ± 177 µatm). On 

average, lower pCO2 was recorded in November (462 ± 398 µatm) and 
higher in April (3,010 ± 4,417 µatm). After 2009, the pCO2 increase 

significantly until 2012 (2,215 ± 3,020), decreasing to 1,403 ± 2,061 in 

2013, and increasing again to 1,876 ± 3,061 in 2014 (p&lt;0.05; Table 1). 

While Peri Lake was mostly CO2 supersatured during the sampled 

months, oxygen saturation was below the equilibrium in 83% of the 

months (Figure 3c) and was significant different among years (p&lt;0.05; 

Table 1). The highest oxygen saturation was observed in 2007 and the 

lowest in 2011 and 2012. 

Chlorophyll-a and nutrients levels varied considerably between 

months (Figures 3b and 3d) with significant differences among years 

(p&lt;0.05; Table 1), and chlorophyll-a showed a general trend of 

increasing until 2014. Monthly DOC ranged from 2.7 to 11.0 mg L-1 and 

chlorophyll-a from 4.6 to 55.3 µg L-1 (Figure 3b). High DOC was 

recorded in 2012 and high chlorophyll-a in 2013, while the lowest DOC 

was in 2010 and the lowest chlorophyll-a in 2007 (Table 1). Total 

phosphorus and total nitrogen showed the highest concentration in 2012 

(Figure 3d; Table 1), with TN:TP ratio on average 70 ± 23. The lowest 

total phosphorus was recorded in 2007, while total nitrogen was the 

lowest in 2011, when the TN:TP ratio was on average 24 ± 10, the 

lowest TN:TP ratio along 2007-2015. Peri Lake was potentially P 

limited during the majority of the months (TN:TP ratio was lower than 

50 only in 2008, 2010 and 2011). In general, both low TP and TN 

occurred in June (11.2 ± 3.47 µg L-1 and 563.2 ± 212.58 µg L-1, 

respectively), while high TP was recorded in September (16.0 ± 5.06 µg 

L-1) and high TN in August (789.7 ± 370.22 µg L-1).

Decreases in rainfall yielded a positive relationship with 

decreasing water levels (r=0.32; p&lt;0.05) and negatively correlated with 

DOC (r=-0.37; p&lt;0.05). Water level correlated to many limnological 

variables suggesting water level to be a key environmental driver of 

water chemistry, including the negative correlation with CO2 flux (r=-

0.29; p&lt;0.05). Other negative correlations with water level included 

DOC, TN and chlorophyll-a, while water level showed positive 

correlation with water transparency (Figure 4). Besides, CO2 flux was 

positively correlated with chlorophyll-a and negatively with water 

transparency. We explored the coupling between pCO2 and pO2 through 
linear regression and found a weak and none significant correlation 

between the gases (r2 = 0.02; p=0.13; Figure 5). 

The correlations between all variables and pCO2, further 
investigated with GLM, gave to us a model with 19 % of explanation 

and suggests that pCO2 was related to water level and water 

temperature. For water temperature, the model showed that both 

temperatures measured in the month sampled and in the month before 

influence the pCO2. Nutrients were also important to the model, 
however, only when one month of lag time was considered (Table 2). A

7.5 Discussion  

Peri Lake was predominantly supersaturated with CO2, 

suggesting a high decomposition of both allochthonous and 

autochthonous organic carbon. High respiration rates were identified in 

bottle incubations and in free-water measurements (Tonetta et al., 2015; 

2016), corroborating with the high processing of carbon through 

biological activity in Peri Lake. Except in 2009, where CO2 influx from 

the atmosphere was predominant, CO2 supersaturation was recorded in 

all years, and along 2012–2014 the CO2 flux to the atmosphere was 

intensified mainly due to the low rainfall, which reduced water level in 

those years. Similar rainfall effects were observed by Tsai et al. (2016), 

where absence of rainfall decreased the water level, as well as changed 

the lake trophic status.  

Although clearly correlations do not give insight in causal 

relationships, various mechanisms could contribute to strong effects of 

water level in the overall changes in Peri Lake. For example, elevated 

pCO2 and CO2 emission during low water levels could be related to a 

stronger benthic-pelagic coupling, where elevated water and sediment 

temperatures increase benthic respiration and thereby CO2 production 

(Vadeboncoeur et al., 2008). In some lakes the benthic contribution can 

represent 80% of the whole metabolism, depending on morphometry 

and trophic state (Vadeboncoeur et al., 2003). Our findings about the 

absent vertical difference in CO2 concentration suggest that the lower 

water volume and the ephemeral nature of the stratification in Peri Lake 

cause a more effective full mixing of the lake (Tonetta et al., 2016), 

where CO2 in the deepest part becomes more effectively mixed into the 

upper parts of the water column. Furthermore, the high CO2 flux during 

months of low water level was similar to recorded by Jones et al. (2016), 

where the high water residence time determined the trophic state of the 

aquatic systems, in turn, CO2 flux was higher when the systems 

presented a lower water column depth.  

The pCO2 values recorded in this study are within the range of 
other tropical and subtropical lakes (Kosten et al., 2010; Marotta et al., 

2010b; Muduli et al., 2012); and other lakes around the world (Duarte &amp;amp; 

Prairie 2005; Sobek et al., 2007). In a recent study, Pinho et al. (2016) 

found that pCO2 in Brazilian lakes were predominantly supersatured 

ranging from 900 to 8,300 µatm. Generally, in tropical lakes the rainfall 

has a great importance to the CO2 concentration, since it can carry 

organic matter to the lakes that sustain the respiration (Marotta et al., 

2010a). In our analyses, DOC did not correlated with CO2 flux, 

corroborating the results from Kosten et al. (2010) and Pinho et al. 



101 

 

(2016) that also did not recorded correlation between DOC and pCO2 in 

tropical lakes. In warmer lakes is expected that temperature stimulate 

respiration more than primary production (Yvon-Durocher et al., 2010) 

and the lack of relationship between DOC and CO2 however, suggests 

that heterotrophy is not related to the dissolved organic part of the 

organic matter. Therefore, the particulate organic matter in the water 

column and/or in the sediment may be more important contributing to 

the high light extinction in the water column, more respiration in both 

compartiments and photooxidation near the surface.  

The decoupling between primary production and respiration 

suggested by the weak correlation between CO2 and O2 imply in high 

sediment respiration rates producing large amounts of CO2 from the 

bottom to the surface, as recorded by Tonetta et al. (2016). Additionally, 

the catchment area can contributed with high CO2 since the Streams 

surrounding Peri Lake receive high amount of terrestrial organic matter 

(Lisboa et al. 2014). Thus, these processes can contribute to the CO2 

supersaturation in the lake without affect the O2 concentrations, as 

mentioned by Fontes et al. (2015). Tonetta et al. (2016) found that under 

turbid low light conditions in Peri Lake, the coupling between primary 

production and respiration was weakened, as primary production 

became light limited while ecosystem respiration remained high. This 

suggest that respiration in the benthic compartment influences the 

overall imbalance between primary production and respiration in pelagic 

waters, resulting in excess production of CO2 under conditions of low 

transparency occurring at low water levels. If the sediment becomes 

anaerobic, organic matter in the sediment will release methane, which is 

partly or completely oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria to CO2 in the 

water column (Kortelainen et al., 2000). Other processes, however, 

could be taken into account, such as photochemical DOC degradation by 

high light levels in subtropical areas (Bertilsson &amp;amp; Tranvik, 2000), in 

turn increasing CO2 via direct DOC oxidation, where no oxygen is 

envolved in the process (Torgensen &amp;amp; Branco, 2007); and indirectly 

through stimulation of bacterial respiration by the photodegraded DOC 

(Amado et al., 2006). DOC from algae is more available to bacteria 

compared to the DOC originated from the forest, which is more suitable 

to photochemical reactions (Amado et al., 2006). Given the positive 

correlation between DOC and chlorophyll-a (Figure 4) DOC in Peri 

Lake seems to be mainly from autochthonous origin. However, some 

allochthonous DOC will likely also enter the lake from decomposition 

of the riparian vegetation. Fontes et al. (2013) found that the 

heterotrophic bacteria biomass regulated CO2 concentrations in Peri 



102 

 

Lake. Since bacterial production and respiration are generally higher in 

the tropics (Amado et al., 2013), we could expect that light and bacteria 

cooperate in order to enhance the carbon degradation and CO2 

supersaturation (Farjalla et al., 2009). 

 Phosphorus showed a positive, even though not significant, 

correlation with CO2, and both nitrogen and phosphorus varied 

significantly over time in Peri Lake. Interestingly, introducing a lag time 

of one month in our GLM analysis raised the importance of nutrients to 

predict levels of pCO2, probably because nitrogen and phosphorus 

stimulate phytoplankton growth with some time delay. The high CO2 

flux in months of high chlorophyll-a in Peri Lake contrast to the general 

findings in other tropical and temperate lakes, where CO2 evasion 

declines with increasing lake productivity (Trolle et al., 2012; Pacheco 

et al., 2013; Peixoto et al., 2013). For example, Trolle et al. (2012), 

analyzing 151 lakes, found that the CO2 uptake rates were higher in 

lakes with high chlorophyll-a, changing from CO2 source to sink as 

lakes became more eutrophic. Conversely, a study from the Cochin 

estuary found that organic enrichment caused a deterioration in water 

quality, and the environment was a CO2 source to the atmosphere 

(Gupta et al., 2009). Other studies have shown that even in eutrophic 

lakes the CO2 supersaturation can still be recorded. For example in a 

tropical reservoir despite the high primary production in pelagic waters, 

high rates of organic carbon mineralization were recorded in the water 

and sediment, rending to the lake a strong CO2 emission to the 

atmosphere (Almeida et al., 2016).  

 The increase in chlorophyll-a in Peri Lake as water level 

decreased could contributed to the high decomposition of these 

autochthonous organic matter in the water column, increasing the CO2 

concentration. Besides the decrease in photic zone by the increase of 

particulate matter could limit the primary production. In a mesocosm 

experiment Marotta et al. (2012), observed that CO2 emissions persisted 

following the eutrophication of humic waters. While nutrients and 

chlorophyll-a were related to the CO2 fluxes, the overall low power of 

the GLM (19%) suggests that other variables not sampled in this study 

could influence the CO2 concentration in Peri Lake, as already reported 

by Fontes et al (2015). These likely include physical variables related to 

morphology and hydrology of the lake, as well described by other 

studies (Kosten et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2016). 

A study on the importance of meteorological conditions on the 

CO2 seasonality in Peri Lake was conducted by Fontes et al. (2015), but 

the authors did not explored the effects of rainfall in the water level. 



103 

 

They however found higher CO2 levels occurring during the transition 

between seasons, which influences water column stability and could 

increase the influence of CO2 fluxes from the bottom to the surface 

waters. The authors also reinforced the importance of meteorological 

events to CO2 fluxes, regarding to El Niño and La Niña years. In El 

Niño year’s higher rainfall is expected and it can carry allochthonous 

organic matter to the lake, supporting elevated respiration rates and CO2 

supersaturation (Marotta et al., 2010a). On the other hand, La Niña 

year’s, where drier periods are expected also can contributed with the 

CO2 supersaturation due to the benthic-pelagic coupling, as we observed 

in this study. Using a forecast model, we predicted that Peri Lake in the 

next years will present a persistent CO2 supersaturation.  

Historical data about rainfall in Santa Catarina Island shows that 

along 1992–2006 the annual average of rainfall was 1,674 mm (data 

from ICEA), a little higher than along 1961-1990, which was 1,518 mm. 

Thus, the recorded rainfall in 2012 (939 mm), and in the following years 

(around 1,200 mm) seems to be below the normal rainfall range to these 

area and therefore a climatic disturbance responsible for keeping the low 

level of Peri Lake. As the regional climate change scenario predicts 

rising air temperatures and reductions in rainfall in some areas (IPCC, 

2014), reduction in water levels will likely occur affecting water column 

stability and chances of cyanobacterial blooms, which will affect the 

carbon cycling (Zohary &amp;amp; Ostrovsky, 2011). In subtropical regions the 

droughts have become more intense and widespread (Fauchereau et al., 

2003) and similar physical changes have occurred in temperate lakes, 

causing major shifts in ecosystem functioning (Noges et al., 2010; 

Geraldes &amp;amp; George, 2012). In a recent study, Catalán et al. (2016) 

described the influence of hydrological variability on inland waters 

carbon cycle, in which wetter or drier regions will experience changes in 

organic carbon decay rates.  

In summary, our studied lake experienced a pronounced water 

level reduction from changes in rainfall, which was also responsible for 

changes in organic carbon, nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentration, in 

turn enhancing CO2 flux to the atmosphere. The unexpected positive 

relationship between chlorophyll-a and CO2 suggests that lakes 

experiencing some level of eutrophication may continue to act as 

conduits of CO2 to the atmosphere. Our analyses revealed that nutrients 

were important to CO2 supersaturation when one month of lag time was 

considered and preditive analyses indicates persistent CO2 
supersaturation for the comming years. Our results highlight that 

absence of rainfall can induce significant physical and chemical changes 



104 

 

in the systems, in turn affecting the biological processes and the rate of 

carbon cycling in the lake. Further studies about other CO2 sources in 

Peri Lake and the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling with 

decreasing water levels are needed to better understand lake responses to 

droughts and to explain the observed decoupling between CO2 and O2.

8.1 Abstract 

Eutrophication and brownification are two conditions affecting 

the metabolic balance in aquatic ecosystems. To determine how the 

additions of inorganic nutrients (+NUTRI) and allochthonous organic 

matter (+OM) affected the air-water CO2 and O2 fluxes (F) we analyzed 

the daily dynamics in these gases over nine days in a mesocosm 

experiment. Additionally, we estimated the resistance and resilience of 

the gases to the different treatments. The control, representing the 

original state of the lake, showed low daily variability and a 

predominant FCO2 to the atmosphere, but with mean values close to 

zero (0.1 ± 0.29 mmol m-2 d-1).  In +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM 

treatments the FCO2 and FO2 showed similar response, where the FCO2 

was negative during all days (mean -1.7 mmol m-2 d-1) and positive FO2 

which peaked around days 5 and 6. The +OM treatment intensified the 

FCO2 to the atmosphere (0.5 ± 0.83 mmol m
-2 d-1) with highest values at 

day 7, decreasing after that. The +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments 

showed low resistance index values for CO2, while high resistance was 

found for the control and +OM treatment. In general, nutrients promoted 

larger overall changes and higher daily variability in FCO2 and FO2 than 

organic matter additions. While nutrients were quickly consumed, levels 

of dissolved organic matter were more constant suggesting a greater 

resilience of the ecosystem, for OM additions. In conclusion, 

eutrophication (nutrients addition) and brownification (+OM) promoted 

contrasting effects in gas fluxes in a mesocosm experiment, where the 

lake was more responsive to nutrients, promoting negative FCO2, while 

organic matter promoted positive FCO2 to the atmosphere in a tropical 

lake. 

 

Keywords: carbon cycling; daily dynamics; eutrophication; 

brownification resistance; resilience. 

 

8.2 Introduction 
Aquatic systems can be considered a sink or source of carbon 

dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, using either dissolved inorganic 

carbon (e.g. Sobek et al. 2005; Trolle et al. 2012; Denfeld et al. 2016) or 

dissolved oxygen (O2) as a tracer of carbon emission (e.g. Staehr et al. 

2010; Laas et al. 2012; Brighenti et al. 2015). On daily scales the 

metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration often dominate 

gas fluxes in the pelagic zone, via simultaneous production and 

consumption of CO2 and O2, which enable us to use both gases as 

indicators of aquatic metabolism (Hanson et al. 2006). To determine the 



113 

 

importance and the function of the lake in the carbon cycling, as well as 

the daily dynamics of the gases, is primordial to understand how the 

ecosystems respond to climatic changes affecting the limnological 

conditions of the lakes (Tranvik et al. 2009). 

It is commonly assumed that CO2 supersaturation derives from 

net heterotrophy, which means that aquatic respiration is higher than 

primary production (Dodds and Cole 2007). In general, this condition is 

supported in part by terrestrial organic matter (OM), despite other 

geochemical processes also contributing to the lake CO2 supersaturation, 

such as catchment productivity and carbonate weathering (Marotta et al. 

2010; Maberly et al. 2012; Marcé et al. 2015). Several studies have 

identified the factors related to the CO2 supersaturation, such as the 

influence of temperature (Kosten et al. 2010), organic carbon (Hanson et 

al. 2003), geographical location (Lazzarino et al. 2009), weather (Kelly 

et al. 2001), and trophic status (Trolle et al. 2012). Temperature 

influences all the biological processes, where in warmer conditions the 

organisms typically exhibit higher primary production and respiration 

rates (Brown et al. 2004) mirrored by high rates of nutrient and carbon 

cycling. Usually the increase of nutrients (eutrophication) have strong 

effects on primary production in aquatic ecosystems (Palmer et al. 2013; 

Staehr et al. in press), where nitrogen and phosphorus inputs enhance 

primary production and may cause CO2 depletion, changing the balance 

between primary production and respiration (Cole et al. 2000). On the 

other hand, inputs of OM (brownification) directly enhance the activity 

of the heterotrophic communities and indirectly reduces the autotrophic 

activity by reducing the light available (Ojala et al. 2011; Granéli 2012; 

Mormul et al. 2012; Thrane et al. 2014). In highly productive aquatic 

systems, rates of respiration are generally also elevated and a strong 

correlation between CO2 and O2 is expected (Zhai et al. 2009). 

Precipitation events and human influence can impact the aquatic 

ecosystems through OM and nutrients inputs. In both cases, we can 

considered these inputs as disturbances or perturbations since they affect 

the stability of the communities and the ecosystems processes (Pimm 

1984; Carpenter et al. 2001). Perturbations cause shifts in the 

ecosystems conditions which lead to alternative stable states before the 

system comes back to the original conditions previous the perturbation, 

or to be conducted to a new equilibrium status (Scheffer and Carpenter 

2003). The degree to which an environmental variable changes 

following a perturbation is called resistance, and how fast a variable 

returns towards its equilibrium following a perturbation is the resilience 

(Pimm 1984). Addressing the resistance and resilience of the system can 



114 

 

be important to understand how adaptive the ecosystems are in 

maintaining the ecosystem functions (Carpenter et al. 2001). 

Eutrophication and brownification are two aquatic conditions that 

can lead to contrasting effects in the carbon cycling. The first promoting 

increases in O2 and the second increases in CO2. In this study, we tested 

the effects of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous OM additions on the 

daily variability of air-water fluxes of CO2 and O2 over nine days in a 

tropical lake. Additionally, we explore a new approach to estimate the 

resistance and resilience of the lake using CO2 and O2. We hypothesized 

that day-to-day variability in FCO2 and FO2 would increase with 

additions of inorganic nutrients and OM. These manipulations are 

however, expected to have contrasting effects, with more CO2 for OM 

additions versus more O2 for nutrients additions. Additionally, we expect 

that responses to OM and nutrient additions will change over time as 

nutrients become depleted and the pool of carbon changes in quantity 

and quality.  

 

8.3 Material and Methods 

Mesocosm setup 

A mesocosm experiment was carried out at the tropical 

freshwater Carioca Lake (19°45’26.0’’S; 42°37’06.2’'W), an 

environment protected from direct human impacts, located in the Rio 

Doce Park in the Atlantic Forest, south-east Brazil. The weather is well-

defined with a dry season during May–September and rainy season 

during October–March. Carioca Lake is a warm monomictic lake, with a 

stable thermal stratification period beginning in September and lasting 

until May and a mixing period from June to August (Brighenti et al. 

2015). 

The mesocosms were deployed in the pelagic area of the lake (6 

to 8 m) and were filled with water pumped from the lake with no 

sediment inside the mesocosms. Each treatment (control, +NUTRI, 

+OM and +NUTRI+OM) was replicated four times, totalizing 16 

mesocosms (Figure 1). The mesocosms consisted of transparent plastic 

bags (low-density polyethylene 30 µm) with ~1.5 m depth, 1.30 m of 

diameter and around 2000 L of volume, were closed at the bottom, but 

opened at surface to allow gas exchange between water and atmosphere. 

We conducted the study during nine days starting on January 20, 2015, 

which we called day 0, where the additions of nutrients and OM were 

conducted.

Figure 1: Design of the mesocosm study performed in Carioca Lake. 

Control represents the lake original state regarding nutrients and organic 

carbon. +NUTRI represents the additions of dissolved inorganic 

nitrogen and phosphate, +OM represents the additions of allochthonous 

organic matter and +NUTRI+OM represents the combined nutrients and 

organic matter additions. 

 

The control mesocosms were conducted without any addition 

representing the original limnological condition of the lake (Table 1). 

Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = nitrate + nitrite + ammonia) at day 

0 was 0.06 ± 0.02 mg L-1, phosphate was 6.70 ± 3.48 µg L-1 and 

dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was 8.14 ± 0.37 mg L-1. The control 

was considered nitrogen limited, with DIN:SRP ratio &amp;lt;13 (Morris and 

Lewis 1988). The +NUTRI treatment consisted of single inorganic 

nutrients additions at day 0. To increase DIN and phosphate 

concentration we used NaNO3, K2HPO4 and NH4Cl. The nitrogen and 

phosphate additions intended to simulate eutrophication and the 

DIN:SRP ratio was around 17, indicating no nutrients limitation. The 

+OM treatment was conducted to simulate brownification, where OM 

was conducted to the lake. These mesocosms received OM extracted 

from the leaves collected from the watershed of Carioca Lake (Atlantic 

forest). We placed the leaves in water, left in darkness at 25ºC, for 7 
days and then filtered through a 68 µm net. Finally, the +NUTRI+OM 

treatment received both inorganic nutrients and OM additions at day 0 

and the DIN:SRP ratio was also around 17. The concentrations after the 

nutrients and OM additions in all treatments and in the control are 

shown in the Table 1.

Water samplings 

Dissolved oxygen (O2sat) was estimated daily from MiniDOT 

loggers as the average recorded between 10:00 to 12:00 h. For daily 

pCO2 we used the headspace equilibrium according to Cole and Caraco 

(1998), collecting water sampled between 10:00 and 12:00 h. One 30 

mL glass bottle was filled with 20 mL of mesocosm surface water and 

immediately capped and sealed. Ten mL of the atmospheric air were 

introduced to each bottle and we shook them vigorously for 60 seconds 

to allow the CO2 equilibrium between air and water. Headspace air was 

collected with a syringe and injected in an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA 

– environmental gas monitor EDS EGM4) for pCO2 measurements 
(accuracy &amp;lt;1% of span concentration over the calibrated range).

+OM+NUTRI 2.57 ± 0.12 149.79 ± 36.90 8.60 ± 0.09 
 

From pCO2 and O2sat measurements we estimated net FCO2 and 

FO2 across the air–water interface. We calculated the gas flux from the 
difference in surface gas concentration [gas(aq meas)] from gas saturation 

[gas(aq sat)] multiplied by the transport coefficient of gas exchange (k): 

gas flux = k ([gas(aq meas)] – [gas(aq sat)]). The gas concentration at 

atmospheric equilibrium was calculated from water temperature for O2 

(Weiss 1974) and for CO2 solubility as a function of temperature and 

salinity (Likens 2009). The transport coefficient k was calculated from 

the estimated k600 and the ratio of Schmidt numbers as k = 

k600 ((Sc/600)
-0.5), according to Jähne et al. (1987). We calculated k600 (k 

for a Schmidt number (Sc) of 600) from 1.5 m s-1 wind speed (mean 

wind speed during the experiment).   
To measure chlorophyll-a, phosphate, DOC and DIN water 

samples were collected every three days at 0.5 m depth of each 

mesocosm following gentle stirring, between 10:00 and 12:00 h. 

Chlorophyll-a was determined on 0.47 µm glass-fiber filters after 



117 

 

extraction in 90% acetone (Lorenzen 1967). DOC was determined 

through high temperature combustion (TOC analyzer Shimadzu 5000A) 

from samples filtered in 0.22 µm glass-fiber filters and stored in the dark 

at 4ºC. Samples for ammonia, nitrate, nitrite (DIN) and phosphate were 

pre-filtered (0.47 ?m filter) and stored in plastic containers at 4ºC. 

Samples were unfrozen and re-filtered in Millex-HV Syringe Filter Unit 

(0.45 µm, Millipore) and analyzed in an ion chromatography (Metrohm 

883 Basic IC). Additionally daily measurements of water temperature, 

turbidity, pH and conductivity were conducted in situ using a probe 

Hydrolab DS5 (Hach Inc.) 

 

Statistical analysis 

We used a two-way analysis of variance to determine if control 

and treatments were different in relation to gases and limnological 

variables. We fitted geometric mean linear regression to each treatment 

and to the control to describe the relationship between FCO2 and FO2. 
Additionally, we used the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test 

differences in slopes among regression lines. All statistical tests were 

performed using the R Development Core Team (2011). We calculated 

the resistance index of pCO2 and O2sat for control and treatments to 

compare how variable they were. We considered the day 0 as the day 

before the disturbance, which for the control, the disturbance was 

considered the deployment of the mesocosms, and for treatments the 

nutrients and OM additions. The index was calculated according to 

Uehlinger (2000) where: ?????????? = 1 ?
??????????????

???????
. The highest 

dimensionless value represents the highest resistance. The resilience of 

the gas was considered as the gas recovery to the initial conditions or 

similar to observed in the control. 

 

8.4 Results 

General conditions 

All mesocosms showed the same water temperature daily 

variation along the days sampled (Figure 2) and mesocosms with 

organic matter additions (+OM and +NUTRI+OM) showed higher 

temperatures, indicating elevated light absorption by OM. The control 
and +OM treatment showed similar conductivity and pH along the days 

with lower values than +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments (Table 

2). Turbidity was highly variable along the days, and the highest values 

were recorded for +OM+NUTRI treatment. Along the days turbidity 

picked in all mesocosms around days 4 and 5 (Figure 2).

Nutrients additions promoted higher chlorophyll-a in both 

+NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments, while low chlorophyll-a was 

recorded in the control (Figure 3; Table 2). The high chlorophyll-a 

variability in +OM treatment occurred at the end of the experiment, 

suggesting that gradual degradation of organic matter released inorganic 

nutrients which were assimilated by autotrophic organisms. DIN and 

phosphate were also different between treatments and along the days 

DIN decreased in both +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments (Figure 

3). DOC increases along the days in all treatments showing that organic 

matter is from autotrophic activity. All the variables were significantly 

different among the treatments, and along the days, except for 

chlorophyll-a and phosphate that were different among treatments but 

not along the days (Table 3).

Gas dynamics 

The control and +OM treatment showed predominantly positive 
FCO2 to the atmosphere, with higher day-to-day variability in +OM than 

in the control. The highest variability, however, was recorded in 

+NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments, with predominant negative 

FCO2 (Figure 4). In the control the FO2 was negative during all days, 



120 

 

similar to +OM treatment (Table 2). In +NUTRI treatment the FO2 was 

slightly positive only around day 6. In +NUTRI+OM treatment, initially 

the FO2 was negative but became positive around day 4 until day 6. 
FCO2 was highly variable compared to FO2, and both gases were 

significant different among days and treatments (Table 3).

Figure 5: Linear regression between FCO2 and FO2 sampled daily along 
nine days, for the control and treatments. 

 

The coupling between FCO2 and FO2 through a linear regression 
(Figure 5) showed similar slopes between +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM 

treatments (ANCOVA; p=0.17), while +OM and +NUTRI treatments 

were significantly different from the control (ANCOVA; p&lt;0.001).  

Applying the resistance index to evaluate disturbance effects of 

OM and nutrient additions, showed opposite effects for CO2 and O2 

(Figure 6). In +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments showed higher 

resistance for O2 and the lower for CO2. In the control and +OM, 

however, higher resistance was observed for CO2 and the lower for O2. 

Observing the gas behavior during the experiment (Figure 4) suggest a 

higher resilience of the mesocosms for +OM, since around day 8 the O2 

concentration tended to reach similar values than in the control (Figure 

4). For +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments similar O2 values were 

observed around day 8.

8.5 Discussion  
Control mesocosms and those with only organic matter additions 

were characterized by CO2 flux to the atmosphere, as well as similar 

conductivity, pH, chlorophyll-a and nutrients. The +OM treatment 

featured higher CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere which is an evidence of 

higher respiration than primary production, typical condition of lakes in 

the Atlantic Forest (Marotta et al. 2009; Marotta et al. 2012). In contrast, 

nutrients additions in +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments raised the 

day-to-day variability resulting in negative CO2 flux, as expected from 

increases in chlorophyll-a and pelagic primary production (Pacheco et 

al. 2013; Peixoto et al. 2013). 

The low day-to-day variability in both CO2 and O2 and the 

predominantly CO2 supersaturation in the control mesocosms 

corroborated previous findings in Carioca Lake (Reis and Barbosa 2014; 

Brighenti et al. 2015). Efflux of CO2 is a typical condition from pristine 

Brazilian tropical lakes as well as many temperate lakes (eg. Trolle et al. 

2012), and has previously been explained by relatively high levels of 

organic carbon and high temperatures (Sobek et al. 2005; Kosten et al. 

2010; Pinho et al. 2016). The higher concentration of allochthonous 

DOC in +OM treatment than in the control supported CO2 production 

through organic degradation, which has been also experimentally 

confirmed by Lennon (2004) and observed in both tropical and 
temperate lakes, where terrestrial organic matter significantly stimulates 

ecosystem respiration (Marotta et al. 2010; Brothers et al. 2014). Influx 

of oxygen in the +OM treatment furthermore signifies that respiration 

exceeded primary production, as high concentrations of DOC subsidizes 



123 

 

the heterotrophic food web. In addition to this, removal of oxygen by 

photo-oxidation is known to be significant in tropical areas under high 

light incidence (Bertilsson and Tranvik 2000).  

Apart from changes in the DOC concentration during the 

experiment, alteration in DOC quality, such as molecular weight and 

structure may affect the biological activity directly and indirectly. For 

instance trough changes in water colour, as we observed the turbidity 

variability along the days. In +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments the 

observed DOC increases at day 3 and 6 were consistent with 

chlorophyll-a increases, suggesting autochthonous DOC which has 

different quality than allochthonous carbon. Autochthonous DOC can 

also be inferred in +OM treatment, where chlorophyll-a concentrations 

increased through days 6 to 9, suggesting that nutrients released from 

the OM degradation supported the phytoplankton growth. DOC from 

algae is more available to bacteria compared to DOC originating from 

the forest, which is more sensitive to photochemical reactions (Amado 

et al. 2006). On a daily scale, this labile DOC released by 

photoautotrophs during the daylight could result in increase in CO2 at 

night (Sadro et al. 2011). Although, we did follow the diel cycle of the 

gases, we could infer that the drop in O2 after day 6 together with the 

slightly increase in CO2 in both +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments 

could be the result of bacterial degradation of DOC of autochthonous 

origin.  

The decline in CO2 in both +NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM 

treatments relative to the control is consistent with observations from 

previous studies where nutrients enrichment favor the primary 

production and consequently the net autotrophy (Spivak et al. 2011; 

Peixoto et al. 2013). Additionally, elevated pH was observed in 

+NUTRI and +NUTRI+OM treatments denoting high photosynthetic 

activity (Jakobsen et al. 2015). Along the days the increase in 

phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) in both +NUTRI and 

+NUTRI+OM treatments favors growth of zooplankton which with 

some time lag likely grazed and decrease chlorophyll-a, as observed 

towards day 6 to day 9. In line with this, the community dynamics 

affected the gases concentration, where after day 6 we observed a drop 

in O2 and slight increase in CO2 indicating that zooplankton growth not 

only affect directly the aquatic respiration, but also depress primary 

production through their grazing activity (Schindler et al. 1997; Polis 

1999).  

We observed that around days 8 and 9 the gas concentrations in 

the treatments were similar to the control and to the first day of the 



124 

 

experiment, indicating a faster recovery, even though nutrients and 

chlorophyll-a were different compared to day 0. The relative faster 

nutrient and carbon cycling observed in the mesocosms with additions 

of nutrients and OM was favored by the high temperature occurring 

during the experiment (~30ºC) which accelerates the biological 

processes (Brown et al. 2004; Ometto et al. 2005). Gallardo et al. (2012) 

recorded in floodplain lakes that the water chemistry took 4 days to 

recover from a flood event, while Lennon (2004) also observed a reduce 

in CO2 flux six days after organic matter additions. In general, recovery 

rates will depend on the inputs intensity and frequency, as well as the 

lake chemical and physical conditions (Reynolds 2002; Borics et al. 

2013; Hipsey et al. 2015).  

The resistance levels determined for the control mesocosms were 

similar to those previously determined for rivers in a study by Uehlinger 

(2000), where respiration showed higher resistance than primary 

production. Comparing to our gas measurements, from all treatments we 

observed the opposite, where CO2 presented higher resistance than O2. 

Usually, weather disturbances have a lasting impact in lakes with a 

longer recovery time, which in turn depends on the severity of the 

disturbance and the lake features (Jennings et al. 2012). Addressing the 

resistance and resilience of the system can be important to understand 

how disturbances can affect the ecosystems and how adjustable the 

communities are to absorb current and future pressures.  

Additions of nutrients strengthened the coupling between CO2 

and O2. However, an imbalance between gases fluxes was observed in 

+NUTRI treatment, which could be related to processes consuming 

more CO2 in relation to amount of O2 produced (Torgersen and Branco 

2007; 2008). In the control, for instance the amount of CO2 released was 

higher than the O2 uptake. The same was observed in the beginning of 

the +OM treatment probably because of the photo-oxidation, which 

could increase the CO2 but not affect the O2 concentration. The slope 

and strength between CO2 and O2 varied among treatments, and the 

strongest was observed under nutrients additions, which presented total 

phosphorus concentrations above 40 µg L-1.  

In a scenario of global changes the mesocosms experiments can 

provide important knowledge about the biological complexity of natural 

systems and can contribute to test, at close to ecosystem level, responses 

to different environmental conditions (Stewart et al. 2013). As climate 

changes is expected to modify the precipitation patterns, for example in 

El Niño year’s higher rainfall is expected. The high precipitation carries 

allochthonous organic matter to the lake and can promote brownification 



125 

 

in aquatic systems. From the results obtained from this experiment we 

can infer that not only eutrophication, but also brownification affect the 

carbon cycling, in this sense as a potential driver of O2 depletion, as well 

as increase in CO2 emissions.  

In conclusion, eutrophication and brownification promoted 

contrasting effects in gas fluxes from a mesocosm experiment in a 

tropical lake, where the lake was more responsive to nutrients, 

promoting negative FCO2, while organic matter promoted positive 
FCO2 to the atmosphere. The high variability in CO2 confirms the high 

sensitive of this gas to changes in limnological conditions, where CO2 

showed lower resistance for nutrients additions than for OM additions. 

Nutrients and organic matter clearly promoted contrasting effects in CO2 

and O2 with important changes along the days regarding the nutrients 

absorption and organic matter degradation.

9 CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 
Esta tese investigou o metabolismo aquático de lagos inseridos no 

bioma Mata Atlântica e como diferentes variáveis limnológicas e 

meteorológicas estão relacionadas à dinâmica espaço-temporal das taxas 

de produção primária e respiração desses ambientes. Observando a 

escala diária nas concentrações de CO2 na Lagoa do Peri foram 

registradas menores fluxos entre a água e a atmosfera durante o dia e 

maiores fluxos à noite. Além disso, durante períodos de alta temperatura 

e intensidade luminosa, típicas de verão, ocorreu influxo de CO2 na 

Lagoa do Peri. Nas demais estações do ano houve predomínio do fluxo 

de CO2 para a atmosfera, condição relacionada com a alta concentração 

de carbono orgânico e densidade de bactérias heterotróficas. Entretanto, 

essas variáveis tiveram baixo poder de explicação para a variação do 

CO2, sugerindo a influência de outras variáveis não consideradas nesta 

abordagem.  

Em um estudo mais detalhado sobre a variação diária das taxas de 

produção primária e respiração, foram utilizadas medidas de oxigênio 

dissolvido a cada 15 minutos e em duas áreas do lago, na região pelágica 

e na litorânea. A predominante condição heterotrófica da Lagoa do Peri 

foi confirmada, no qual a autotrofia líquida foi registrada apenas na 

superfície da coluna d’água. O padrão vertical de maior produção 

primária na superfície diminuindo em direção ao fundo da lagoa, e 

menor respiração na superfície aumentando em direção ao fundo, aliado 

à distribuição homogênea dos nutrientes e clorofila-a na coluna d’água 

corrobora com a importância da luz na variação vertical do metabolismo 

aquático, bem como a influência do sedimento para as maiores taxas de 

respiração nas camadas mais profundas. Temporalmente, quando a 

estabilidade da coluna d’água aumentou em função da maior 

temperatura e menor velocidade do vento, as taxas de produção primária 

foram maiores. Por outro lado, a região litorânea apresentou maior 

variabilidade que a região pelágica, possivelmente relacionada à 

influência do ambiente terrestre e da coluna d’água mais rasa. Esses 

resultados sugerem que neste ambiente as variáveis físicas como a 

estabilidade da coluna d’água, o vento e a profundidade do ambiente são 

determinantes para a dinâmica espaço-temporal das taxas metabólicas. 

A importância das variáveis físicas também foi explorada no 

terceiro capítulo, no qual foram analizados oito anos consecutivos de 

coletas mensais na Lagoa do Peri. Ao longo desse período importantes 

alterações foram observadas no nível d’água em decorrência da reduzida 

precipitação. Foi possível observar que o aumento da pCO2 e do fluxo 
de CO2 foi concomitante ao aumento da clorofila-a e do carbono

orgânico. O aumento na concentração de nutrientes e clorofila-a também 

foi devido à diminuição do nível d’água da Lagoa do Peri, como 

resultado da precipitação abaixo da média para a região, registrada entre 

2012 e 2014. Isso indica que o aumento da clorofila-a ao invés de 

promover o aumento da produção primária, tem favorecido 

indiretamente a respiração por aumentar a limitação da luz e a 

concentração de carbono orgânico autóctone na coluna d’água. Além 

disso, a falta de relação direta entre CO2 e O2 sugere que a bacia de 

drenagem pode estar contribuindo para a supersaturação de CO2 na 

Lagoa do Peri.  

Quando adições experimentais de matéria orgânica e nutrientes 

inorgânicos foram conduzidas em mesocosmos na Lagoa Carioca, foi 

observado que a dinâmica dos gases foi alterada, uma vez que a matéria 

orgânica favoreceu o aumento do CO2 com consumo do O2, enquanto 

que os nutrientes inorgânicos favoreceram o aumento do O2 e o 

consumo do CO2. A adição de nutrientes promoveu maior variabilidade 

no ecossistema que a adição de matéria orgânica, embora o sistema 

rapidamente tendeu a retornar às condições iniciais.  

Em síntese, com a realização desta tese foi possível observar que 

os lagos inseridos no bioma Mata Atlântica tendem a ser heterotróficos e 

altamente dinâmicos. Essa dinamicidade está relacionada à interação das 

variáveis meteorológicas e limnológicas, que determinam as dinâmicas 

espacial e temporal da produção primária e da respiração. Com isso, 

mudanças no clima global podem alterar ou intensificar a função dos 

lagos como fontes ou sumidouros de carbono. 

Por fim, esta tese mostra que mesmo esses lagos estando 

inseridos em locais de proteção ambiental, impedindo que as atividades 

antrópicas impactem diretamente esses ambientes, as mudanças 

climáticas globais podem afetar esses ecossistemas, principalmente 

através de alterações no padrão de precipitação. Assim, observando que 

as variáveis físicas podem ser determinantes na variação espaço-

temporal do metabolismo aquático, é importante que elas sejam 

consideradas nas estratégias de gerenciamento e restauração dos 

ambientes aquáticos, bem como do seu entorno.

10 PERSPECTIVAS 
Juntamente com os resultados obtidos por esta tese, alguns 

tópicos emergem e merecem ser explorados futuramente, tais como:  

- Determinar qual é a contribuição do sedimento para a 

concentração de CO2 e O2 na coluna d’água, através da degradação 

aeróbica e anaeróbica; 

- Identificar a contribuição da bacia de drenagem para a 

supersaturação em CO2, através de medições diretas de CO2; 

- Avaliar o papel do vento na quebra de estabilidade da coluna 

d’água e como isso pode afetar as taxas de produção primária e 

respiração;  

- Estimar a resiliência e resistência dos ambientes aquáticos frente 

às mudanças climáticas globais que alteram a estabilidade desses 

ecossistemas. 

Diante disso, é nítido que os estudos sobre metabolismo aquático 

nos ambientes tropicais e subtropicais merecem atenção e dedicação por 

parte de limnólogos e ecólogos. Devido à sua posição geográfica e as 

condições ambientais, esses ambientes podem apresentar diferentes 

dinâmicas no processamento da matéria orgânica e dos nutrientes. Por 

fim, a compreensão de como as diversas variáveis limnológicas e 

meteorológicas controlam as taxas de produção primária e respiração 

aquática dos ecossistemas é essencial para descrever o ciclo do carbono 

em ambientes tropicais e subtropicais e prever sua resposta às mudanças 

climáticas e ambientais em andamento, bem como as previstas a ocorrer.
