resumo 
 

 

Os efeitos resultantes da hidrofilicidade de compósitos TiO2-SiO2 com diferente 
reatividade e composição química em processos sol-gel têm sido descritos na 
literatura. Esses resultados mostram que formulações sol-gel menos reativas 
originam super-hidrofilicidade, isto é, um ângulo de contacto inferior a 10° após 
envelhecimento superior a 8 semanas (envelhecimento em condições 
ambiente). Tendo em conta a morfologia de derivados de filmes compósitos e 
diferentes modelos termodinâmicos de superficie, sugere-se que um filme 
compósito com uma textura mais porosa poderá levar a um efeito de super-
hidrofilicidade superior. Para verificar esta hipótese, neste projeto optou-se por 
estudar em detalhe compósitos TiO2-SiO2 mais reativos com diferentes 
composições (0, 20, 60 e 100 mol% de SiO2), em que a uma maior reatividade 
sol-gel é esperada uma redução da super-hidrofilicidade dos filmes 
compósitos. Com o objetivo de criar artificialmente uma morfologia 
rugosa/porosa, utilizaram-se neste caso camadas de esferas de poliestireno 
(PS) com um diâmetro médio de 0.6 ?m.  
 
Com o objetivo de definir as melhores condições para obter camadas 
compactas 2D de esferas de PS foram estudados diferentes parâmetros no 
método de revestimento spin-coating. Realizaram-se experiências com 
diferentes velocidades de rotação (1000rpm e 500rpm). Outros parâmetros de 
deposição por spin-coating ajustados foram a rotação a 5000rpm/s, tempo de 
rotação de 1s, concentração de esferas de PS a 1wt% em EtOH, e um volume 
de 100?L para a solução de PS. As camadas 2D de PS foram posteriormente 
impregnadas em sóis de TiO2-SiO2. A utilização de esferas de PS permitiu 
obter filmes compósitos de TiO2-SiO2 com rugosidade aproximadamente cem 
vezes superior aos filmes compósitos obtidos na ausência das esferas de PS. 
Estas características morfológicas foram confirmadas por microscopia ótica, 
microcopia eletrónica (SEM) e microscopia de força atómica (AFM). Por sua 
vez, medições do ângulo de contacto mostraram que a hidrofilicidade aumenta 
após as modificações morfológicas efetuadas e, nos melhores casos 
(amostras com 20-60 mol% de SiO2), os ângulos de contacto de água obtidos 
foram inferiores a 5

o
, após 6 semanas de envelhecimento (sob condições 

ambiente). Este estudo mostrou igualmente que nestes casos existe uma 
relação entre: 1) o revestimento da superfície das esferas de PS, 2) a 
rugosidade/porosidade da superfície dos filmes S1-X+PS, e 3) a persistência 
da super-hidrofilicidade.

abstract 

 
Enhanced hydrophilicity effects arising from TiO2-SiO2 granular interfaces in 
composite films deposited via sol-gel routes have been studied before. Results 
obtained so far have shown that sol-gel formulations yielding less reactive sols 
lead to enhanced super-hydrophilicity persistence of composite films, i.e. a 
water contact angle less than 10

o
 after aging for more than 8 weeks (aging 

under ambient conditions without UV radiation). Taking into account the 
morphology of derived composite films and different surface thermodynamics 
models, we have suggested that a more rough/porous structure of the 
composite film might even increase this enhanced hydrophilicity effect. To 
verify this hypothesis, we have chosen to study more reactive TiO2-SiO2 
composite sols with different compositions (0, 20, 60 and 100mol% of SiO2). 
This greater sol-gel reactivity is expected to reduce the natural super-
hydrophilicity of composite films in order to better assess eventual effects of the 
morphology. Then, in order to artificially create rough/porous morphologies, we 
have used polystyrene (PS) beads with average diameter of 0.6?m. 
 
Different parameters of spin-coating deposition method were tested to define 
the best conditions to obtain 2D layers of closely packed PS beads. Further, 
two experiments with different rotation speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm) were 
performed. Other spin-coating conditions were fixed as follows: acceleration of 
5000rpm/s, rotation time of 1s, concentration of PS beads 1wt% in EtOH, 
volume of PS solution 100?L. Such 2D PS layers were then impregnated with 
TiO2-SiO2 composite sols. Using PS beads, we have obtained TiO2-SiO2 
composite films with a roughness that is almost 100 times higher than 
composite films without PS beads. These morphology features are confirmed 
by optical microscopy, AFM and FEG-SEM measurements. Water contact 
angle measurements show in turn that the hydrophilicity effects are increased 
by morphologic modifications, and in the best cases (samples with 20-60mol% 
of SiO2) water contact angles are close to 5

o 
after 6 weeks of aging under 

ambient conditions without UV radiation. This study also shows that, in these 
cases, there is some relation between: 1) the surface coverage of PS beads, 2) 
the surface roughness/porosity of S1-X+PS films, and 3) their super-
hydrophilicity persistence.

1. Introduction 

The concept of “self-cleaning surfaces” has been a subject of particular interest for the past 

decades and the research field in this direction has increased significantly. Photo-induced 

properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings, when exposed to UV radiation, allow 

development of the studies. However, Manuel Houmard in his PhD thesis work in 

Laboratoire des Matériaux et de Génie Physique (LMGP) of Grenoble INP has shown that, 

contrary to TiO2 coatings that need to be exposed to UV radiation, TiO2-SiO2 nano-

composite coatings obtained by sol-gel method show a natural super-hydrophilicity of the 

surface. This property allows natural and efficient elimination of pollution (oils or others) 

present on the surface just by simple washing with water without need of different 

detergents or exposure to UV radiation. 

Although the “self-cleaning” functionality of TiO2-SiO2 nano-composite coatings obtained 

by sol-gel method has already been shown and proven at LMGP, the origin of this super-

hydrophilicity effect still raises questions, particularly about the nature of the nano-

composite. Answers to these questions would make not only a progress in knowledge 

about the fundamental mechanisms responsible about this property, but also provide 

possibilities for further optimization of the functionality. This Master thesis work is a part 

of that goal.

2. Theoretical description and generalities 

2.1. Super-hydrophilicity: photo-induced property 

In order to consider a material as hydrophilic, it should exhibit a strong surface energy and 

have the possibility to create hydrogen bonds with water. This hydrophilic property is 

described by a water contact angle value that is lower than 90
o 

in contact with the surface 

of the material. First researches on photo-induced properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) 

date from 1970, when the work of Fujishima et al. showed that a TiO2 electrode, when 

irradiated with UV, could decompose the water into hydrogen and oxygen [1]. Such photo-

induced reaction results from the fact that TiO2 is a semiconductor with different energies 

for the valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB), creating an energy gap between both 

levels. Thus, when TiO2 absorbs a photon with energy that is higher or equal to that of the 

band gap, an electron-hole pair is generated, where the electron (hole) is excited from the 

VB (CB) to the CB (VB) [2]. The charge carriers are therefore generated in the form of 

photo-electrons (e
-
) and photo-holes (h

+
) by the following reaction: 

TiO2 + h? ? e
-
 + h

+
      (1) 

These photo-generated charges are responsible for the high photo-catalytic activity of TiO2 

because the formation of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals (OH•), leads to 

the degradation of the pollution adsorbed on the surface via red-ox reactions. 

Another interesting property of TiO2 is its photo-induced super-hydrophilicity. Wong et al. 

have shown that the increased super-hydrophilicity of TiO2 is not uniform but involves 

localized domains that are favorable to the water adsorption [3,4]. Photo-generated 

electrons tend to reduce the cations Ti

 (equation (2)), meanwhile the holes are 

trapped in the oxygen network within the TiO2 matrix (equation (3)). This insertion of 

holes weakens the linking between the oxygen atoms and associated titanium atoms, thus 

favoring the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 (equation (4)) [5,6]:

The oxygen vacancies are then able to promote a molecular or dissociative adsorption of 

the atmospheric water, producing surface OH groups. Thus, the functionalized surface has 

a great affinity for the water that gives its super-hydrophilic properties, determined by a 

water contact angle close to zero (see Fig. 1). It has also been shown that other parameters 

such as roughness and ambient atmosphere might influence the photo-induced super-

hydrophilicity of the material [7,8]. 

 

These photo-induced properties are the objects of mainly extensive studies for self-

cleaning applications in outdoor atmosphere, i.e. atmosphere which takes advantage of 

solar UV light and rain water to remove carbon pollution. 

2.2. New alternatives 

Previous studies have shown that the addition of SiO2 into the TiO2 film decreases the 

water contact angle and this effect might last for several days [9]. In his PhD thesis held in 

LMGP, M. Houmard has improved this tendency by studying sol-gel thin films of TiO2-

SiO2 nano-composites [10]. These layers show a natural super-hydrophilicity and this 

property can persist for several weeks or months in the absence of UV light. This natural 

super-hydrophilicity allows new developments of “self-cleaning” surfaces entirely based 

on natural super-hydrophilic properties in atmosphere where UV light cannot be present 

permanently or in strong dose, i.e. indoor atmosphere. 

2.3. Mechanisms of super-hydrophilicity of TiO2-SiO2 nano-

composites with granular interfaces 

By following the evolving kinetics of water contact angle on the film surface over aging 

without UV radiation, M. Houmard has shown the beneficial effect of TiO2-SiO2 granular

interfaces on the natural super-hydrophilicity of derived composite films. As seen in Fig. 2, 

the reference films of pure TiO2 and pure SiO2 have a super-hydrophilic effect only for the 

first few hours or days, which disappears rapidly without UV radiation. Meanwhile, the 

composite conserves its super-hydrophilicity for a very long time, i.e. a water contact angle 

smaller than 5
o 

after eight weeks of aging [10]. 

 

Although, the morphology of composite films is a factor that might influence their super-

hydrophilicity, another hypothesis would be the formation of deprotonated TiOx
-
 and/or 

protonated SiOx
+
 units at the TiO2-SiO2 granular interfaces of composite films. These 

interfacial charges have been frequently mentioned as the main reason for the catalytic 

behavior of TiO2-SiO2 composites [10]. In our case, charges that appear on the surface of 

composite films can induce the molecular or dissociative adsorption of the atmospheric 

water resulting in the super-hydrophilicity. Thus, the water contact angle for the TiO2-SiO2 

composite material is never between those of pure TiO2 and pure SiO2 as one would 

expect. Fig. 3 represents the water contact angle measured after eight weeks of aging under 

ambient atmosphere without UV irradiation as a function of the sol TiO2-SiO2 molar

composition. These results show that the best persistence of the super-hydrophilicity is 

observed for those composites that have more TiO2-SiO2 interfaces with an optimum 

composition containing 40-60mol% of SiO2. This observation reinforces the assumption 

that the natural super-hydrophilicity arises, at least partially, from interfaces effects. As 

will be detailed in next section the sol-gel reactivity is another factor that can influence 

interfaces effects. 

 

As it was mentioned before, morphology of the composite films can also strongly influence 

their natural super-hydrophilic behavior. Indeed, it is known that a naturally hydrophilic 

surface becomes even more hydrophilic when being porous or rough (see section 3.5.1). 

Previous studies have revealed the porosity and roughness of TiO2-SiO2 composite films, 

where composite films with best super-hydrophilicity persistence have an RMS roughness 

of about 10 nm, compared to 5 nm and less than 1 nm for pure TiO2 and SiO2 films, 

respectively. The optimized composite films also exhibit a porous sponge-like morphology 

that is characterized by big surface cavities (see dark areas in FEG-SEM and AFM images 

of Fig. 4). Thus, it remains important to assess how the effects of granular interfaces and 

morphology respectively influence the natural super-hydrophilicity of TiO2-SiO2 

composites. This Master thesis work is a contribution to this objective.

2.4. Cleanability 

In last decades, many studies have been devoted to the detachment of an oil drop deposited 

on a surface by using skimming flow [11,12]. Inspired by these works, SIMaP laboratory 

of Grenoble INP has developed an experimental setup for dynamic wetting tests, which 

uses skimming flow of water to simulate the cleaning of a surface previously polluted with 

oil [13,14]. This device implements a cell with laminar flow that is associated with an 

optical device that follows the evolution of the oil drop in real time when increasing the 

water flow. The minimal critical flow that is needed to completely detach the oil drop 

provides quantitative information on the water cleanability of the surface. 

These flow measurements were performed to detach an oil drop from the surfaces of 

various TiO2-SiO2 compositions aged under ambient atmosphere during 8 weeks without 

UV light. Results illustrated in Fig. 5 demonstrate a perfect correlation between enhanced 

super-hydrophilicity persistence, as shown in Fig. 3, and a reduced critical flow of water, 

proving that the cleanability of the composite surfaces directly arises from their super-

hydrophilicity.

2.5. Artificial porosity/roughness 

Since an enhanced roughness or surface porosity of TiO2-SiO2 composite films can favor 

their natural super-hydrophilicity, the aim of this Master thesis work has been to artificially 

increase the porous/rough structure of TiO2-SiO2 composites in order to assess how this 

modification influences the water wettability. It is known that the use of differently sized 

porogenes (macro- and meso-sized) results in aligned and closely packed pores leading to 

structures of controlled porosity, pore size, and surface area [15]. For instance, previous 

studies have shown that one can obtain architectured macro-meso-microporous structures 

with 3D interconnectivity by using polystyrene (PS) latex spheres, copolymers such as 

Pluronic F127 or P123, and alcohol as co-surfactant (see Fig. 6) [16].

In this work, we have used such results to artificially form macro-porous structures (a 

typical pore dimension of some hundreds of nanometers) from PS beads. According to the 

literature and as illustrated in Fig. 7, this approach relies on the preliminary formation of a 

composite monolith constituted of PS beads and an inorganic network, for instance SiO2 in 

the example illustrated in Fig. 6.  PS beads are subsequently eliminated through solvent 

extraction or calcination, which yields a residual inorganic rough and porous network. 

 

In the recent literature, the artificial formation of porous inorganic networks has generally 

been devoted to 3D structures [15,16]. In contrast, we have chosen to focus the present 

work on the 2D assembly (single-layer) of closely-packed PS nano-beads that would be

yields a macro-porous inorganic network, adapted from [16]

used as a template to create a rough and macro-porous structure from TiO2-SiO2 

composites. In order to reach this goal, one has first to study the elaboration of closely-

packed PS single-layers by a spin-coating technique, which can subsequently be 

impregnated with a composite sol. 

2.6. 2D assembly of PS beads by spin-coating method 

2.6.1. 2D assembly of PS beads 

The very first descriptions about the basic formation mechanisms of 2D ordered clusters 

from colloidal particles on a substrate were proposed in 1909 by J. Perrin [17]. Based on 

this work, Denkov et al. more recently re-described the 2D ordering of micrometer-size 

polystyrene latex spheres on a horizontal glass substrate by means of optical microscopy 

observations [18]. They have proven that the main factors governing the ordering are: 1) 

the attractive capillary forces caused by the liquid (generally water) menisci formed around 

the particles and 2) the convective transport in liquid medium of particles toward the 

ordered region (see Fig. 8a). Further, the formation of well-ordered single-layers or well-

ordered domains consisting of multilayers (bi-layers, tri-layers, etc.) can be controlled by 

the water evaporation rate (see Fig. 8b). 

 

At the first stage, a “nucleus” of ordered phase appears when the upper surface of the 

thinning aqueous layer in the wetting film presses the latex particles toward the water-glass 

interface. The ordering of PS spheres starts when the thickness of the water layer 

containing PS particles becomes approximately equal to the diameter of particles. From 

  

Fig. 8: Schematic representation of (a) two PS spheres partially immersed in a liquid 

layer on a horizontal solid substrate showing that the deformation of the liquid meniscus 

gives rise to inter-particle attraction; and (b) convective flux toward the ordered phase 

due to the water evaporation from the menisci between the particles in the 2D array;

here, one can define the second stage of the 2D crystal growth when the horizontal 

component of capillary forces (i.e. convective water flux) causes the directional motion of 

particles toward the ordered array and the evaporation of water leads to a gradual decrease 

of the liquid layer thickness with time. That increases the curvature and hence the local 

sucking capillary pressure causing an intensive water influx from the thicker parts of the 

liquid layer where the pressure is higher [18]. 

The described mechanisms suggest at least two ways to control the ordering process: 1) 

control of the speed of the convective flow by changing the rate of water evaporation and 

2) control of the profile of the liquid meniscus encircling the ordered array by ejecting 

(injecting) some amount of suspension during the experiment. In both cases the 

mechanisms lead to a change of the liquid layer thickness and a surface slope at the 

boundary between the array and the encircling meniscus. Nevertheless, large mono-crystal 

domains (better quality of 2D arrays) can be obtained when the rate of 2D crystal growth is 

lower [18]. 

2.6.2. Spin-coating method 

In this work, we have studied the liquid deposition of 2D PS structures using a spin-coating 

method (see Fig. 9). The general description of this method relies on four steps: 1) 

deposition of the material where the deposited liquid solution wets the substrate; 2) radial 

acceleration where the centrifugal force generated by the rotation of the substrate pushes 

the liquid towards the edges of the substrate and covers it fully; 3) constant rotation where 

the liquid film homogenizes and the extra amount of liquid is ejected from the substrate 

due to the centrifugal force; and 4) solidification where the evaporation of the solvent 

(which might occur already during the steps 2 and 3) yields a film constituted of solid 

particles initially diluted in the liquid or activates organic or inorganic (sol-gel, see after) 

polymerization reactions leading to solid thin film formation [10]. 

 

 
Fig. 9: Schematic representation of spin-coating method 



11 

 

One has to take into account that the layer formation from colloidal solution with polymer 

beads (or other kinds of solid particles diluted in a liquid) by spin-coating method is not the 

same as in the case of polymeric solutions. Thus, in our case, the basic mechanisms of thin 

film formation from polymeric solutions cannot be applied completely. Actually, only few 

research papers have described the use of spin-coating technique in order to obtain 2D 

assembly of PS nano-spheres [19-21]. According to these papers, in the case of colloidal 

suspensions, there are two types of parameters that have to be considered and to be 

adjusted during deposition process. One has to estimate, a) the parameters of the colloidal 

suspension: such as the diameter of PS beads, concentration, surfactants on the surface of 

nano-spheres, solvents etc., and b) the parameters for the spin-coating method: rotation 

speed, rotation duration, acceleration, deposited volume of suspension etc. This huge range 

of experimental parameters does not allow to a-priori fix one possible approach to obtain 

best 2D PS assemblies. For instance, some recent papers have shown that variation of the 

parameters involved in the spin-coating deposition of PS micro-beads yield a wide range of 

results in terms of 2D-assembly performances [20,21]. Thus, a first goal of this work has 

been to find the assembly conditions in relation to our final objective. Let us recall that the 

2D PS assembly intended here corresponds to a preliminary step, which will be followed 

by the impregnation of composite sols in order to finally create an artificially enhanced 

roughness or porosity of TiO2-SiO2 composite films. For this subsequent composite sols 

impregnation, we have directly extrapolated spin-coating deposition conditions habitually 

used for the formation of composite films. These conditions will be recalled in following 

sections. In this work, silica wafers were used as substrates.

3. Characterization methods 

All the physicochemical and morphological characterization methods described in this 

work have been done in LMGP and SIMaP laboratories of Grenoble INP. 

3.1. Optical Microscopy (OM) 

Optical microscopy, employed to obtain an enlarged image of a small object, uses visible 

light and modifies the path of the light to generate an improved contrast image from a 

sample. For analysis of surface structures, one can use transmitted or reflected light 

configurations. In our case, as the substrate used for the sample preparation is Si (non-

transparent), the sample illumination is done from the top of the sample (reflected light 

detection). Observations with optical microscope allow obtaining a general description of 

the sample surface to anticipate further experiments. 

3.2. Coverage Rate (CR) 

Surface coverage rate quantitatively describes the rate of the polystyrene beads covering 

the substrate and permits quantitative analysis of obtained samples. In order to calculate 

CR, a program called ‘ImageJ’ is used. This program uses optical images and, applying a 

threshold function, compares ‘white areas’ with ‘black areas’ observed in the pictures. 

3.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 

Scanning electron microscopy technique is based on the principle of the electron-medium 

interactions. Electron beam scans the surface of the sample reemitting different radiation 

(secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, Auger electrons, X-rays).  Different 

detectors allow analyzing the reemitted radiations, reconstruct the image of the surface and 

determine chemical elements present in the zone of analysis. Morphological and micro-

structural characterization of TiO2-SiO2 composite thin films was done using a pressure 

controlled FEG (Field Emission Gun) SEM microscope. 

3.4. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) 

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) permits to study the sample surface topography. The 

principle of this technique is based on the interactions between the sample and a tip 

attached on a micro-lever. The tip scans the surface of the sample and, according to 

feedback parameters, changes its height. Computer registers the height and reconstructs an 



13 

 

image of the surface. Roughness of the surface is characterized by the RMS (Root Mean 

Square) value. AFM measurements are recorded in ‘tapping’ mode using a silicon nitride 

tip with a curvature radius of around 15nm. 

3.5. Wetting – water contact angle measurements 

3.5.1. Theory 

The wettability measurements are widely employed techniques in studies of surface 

properties and are usually used to characterize the affinity between a solid and a liquid by 

measuring the liquid contact angle ? formed between the liquid and solid surface as shown 

in Fig. 10. 

 

In this work, the water contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method. When 

the drop is deposited on the solid surface, it acquires particular configuration that describes 

interactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface (see Fig. 11). 

 

As it was described in paragraph 2, creation of a rough surface is the aim of this thesis 

work. Therefore, one has to take into account the effects that occur on a rough surface 

when a water droplet touches it. M. Houmard in his PhD Thesis work [10] has described 

 

Fig. 11: Schematics of water contact angle ? formed between liquid drop and solid 

surface as a function of its hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics 

 

Fig. 10: Schematics of contact angle ? formed between a liquid drop and a solid surface 



14 

 

three possible models related to so-called textured surface: 1) Cassie-Baxter’s model [22] 

that describes a chemically heterogeneous surface, 2) Wenzel’s model [23] describing a 

rough surface and 3) Bico’s model [24] that relates both previous models describing a 

structure with an open surface porosity. All three models, in general, are described 

similarly, taking into account interacting surfaces (liquid-liquid, liquid-solid). For instance, 

in the Bico’s model, the porous (rough) surface is described as a composite one, one 

component being the dry solid itself, the other one being constituted of impregnated water 

regions (see Fig. 12). 

 

In this case the measured water contact angle ?
*
 is defined as follows: 

        (      )        ( ) 

where   is the theoretical water contact angle which would be measured on a flat solid 

surface and    is the solid surface fraction. This relation clearly shows that high roughness 

or open porosity (small   ) decreases the measured water contact angle, thus increases the 

surface hydrophilicity (    ).

with an open porosity 



15 

 

3.5.2. Experimental setup 

The water contact angles are measured using a goniometer KRÜSS G10 (see Fig. 13) that 

is equipped with a system for image analysis. It consists of a CCD video camera, a card 

acquisition connected to a PC and the Drop Shape Analysis (DSA) software for image 

processing. Environmental chamber has constant temperature (20
o
C) in it and, therefore, 

constant humidity to ensure that the water drop does not evaporate while measurements are 

done. A water droplet is deposited on the sample surface by the help of syringe with 

constant volume (Vw  ? 1.5µL) [10]. Cold light source creates a shadow-like pattern of the 

water droplet that is further captured by the CCD camera and analyzed with the DSA 

software. Several droplets are deposited on the surface of the sample for more statistical 

results.

4. Elaboration 

As it was mentioned before, in this thesis work, our interest is to create a porous/rough 

structure in the TiO2-SiO2 composite material that would increase the natural super-

hydrophilicity effect, i.e. increase the persistence of natural super-hydrophilicity over 

aging. For this reason, we have defined the basic system of the samples consisting of three 

layers: composite film, PS single-layer and impregnated composite layer. 

4.1. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite films by sol-gel 

process 

By sol-gel process one can elaborate a network of amorphous oxide via an inorganic 

polymerization reaction in liquid solution at ambient temperature. This technique allows 

the creation of thin films resulting from a liquid solution (sol) that, after the evaporation of 

solvent and thermal treatment, forms, respectively, a xerogel (inorganic polymer) film and 

an inorganic (oxide) film (see Fig. 14). 

 

With M(OR)n group as an alkoxide type precursor, where M is a metal and R is an alkyl 

radical, inorganic polymerization is based on the following reactions: 

1. Hydrolysis: M(OR)n + H2O ? OH-M(OR)n-1 + ROH 

2. Condensation:  

a) Oxolation, in case of water liberation: 

(OR)nM-OH + OH-M(OR)n ? (OR)nM-O-M(OR)n + H2O 

b) Alkoolation, in case of alcohol liberation: 

(OR)nM-OH + OR-M(OR)n ? (OR)nM-O-M(OR)n + ROH 

 

Fig. 14: Formation of thin films via sol-gel approach 



17 

 

Both hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions progress simultaneously in solution. It 

leads to polymeric inorganic chains that develop an inorganic network after liquid film 

deposition. The reactivity of sol-gel solutions (length and degree of cross-linking polymer 

chains formed from sol-gel reactions) can be controlled by various factors such as 

concentration of reactants (alkoxide, water) and addition of acidic or basic catalyst. These 

parameters were studied previously in the work of M. Houmard et al. [10]. In this work, 

the sol-gel principles were adapted to activate the reactive mechanisms in liquid solution in 

order to form inorganic TiO2 nano-crystallites in suspension, which could be then diluted 

in a polymeric silica sol. 

4.2. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite sols 

TiO2-SiO2 composite sols are prepared by mixing a TiO2 crystalline suspension (CS) with 

a SiO2 sol in various molar ratios. 

4.2.1. Crystalline suspension of TiO2 (CS) 

A crystalline suspension (CS) of anatase phase TiO2 is prepared from a mother solution 

(MS) of polymeric TiO2. To prepare MS, tetraisopropylorthotitanate (TIPT) is mixed with 

distilled water and hydrochloric acid and using absolute ethanol as solvent [25]. TIPT 

concentration in the solution is 0.4M and the molar ratio of TIPT/H2O/HCl is 1/0.82/0.13. 

Then, before usage, solution is aged for two days in ambient temperature. A multi-step 

procedure, developed in LMGP [26,27], is then applied to elaborate a CS from the MS. 

The MS is firstly diluted in high amount of deionized water (molar ratio of H2O/TIPT is 

90) and autoclaved at 130
o
C for 6 hours. Autoclaving process leads to the crystallization of 

TiO2 nanoparticles of anatase phase diluted in aqueous medium. This crystallization, 

resulting from sol-gel reactions in aqueous and acidic conditions, relies on an activation of 

the hydrolysis reaction and slowing down of the poly-condensation reactions via 

peptization mechanisms. Nucleation of anatase TiO2 follows from the pure oxide clusters 

formed during the process described previously. An exchange procedure is performed in 

order to remove the water from the sol and replace it with absolute ethanol. The final 

concentration of TiO2 in ethanol is 0.24M and the CS is composed of nano-particles 

crystallized in the anatase phase with a diameter of about 5-6 nm [6]. Previous studies have 

shown that these conditions lead to very stable suspensions that can be used for several 



18 

 

weeks in order to elaborate pure TiO2 coatings. In order to obtain TiO2-SiO2 composite 

sols, one can mix the CS with a polymeric solution of SiO2. 

4.2.2. Polymeric solution of SiO2 (S1) and TiO2-SiO2 composite films 

A sol of SiO2 is prepared by diluting tetraethoxylane (TEOS) in absolute ethanol, distilled 

water and hydrochloric acid [28]. First, a solution in ethanol is elaborated with a TEOS 

concentration of 2.35M and a fixed H2O/TEOS molar ratio (Rw) and pH. After, this sol is 

steamed at 60
o
C for 2 days. Finally, it is diluted in absolute ethanol till the desired 

concentration is obtained. The sol can then be mixed with a CS to form a TiO2-SiO2 

composite sol. It is worth mentioning that the TEOS concentration, Rw ratio, and pH 

strongly influence the SiO2 sol reactivity. Increasing this sol-gel reactivity will in turn 

induce long Si-O-Si polymer chains that form the network of SiO2. In his thesis, M. 

Houmard has shown that this sol reactivity strongly impacts the physicochemical and 

morphological properties of composite layers, which in turn strongly influence their 

hydrophilic properties [10]. Accordingly, sols of weaker reactivity leading to very short 

SiO2 polymeric chains were observed to favor a greater number of Ti-O-Si interfaces in 

TiO2-SiO2 composite films, which promoted enhanced super-hydrophilic properties, i.e. an 

enhanced persistence of the natural super-hydrophilicity. In the present work we wanted to 

assess in which extent an increased roughness or porosity could enhance the super-

hydrophilicity of composite films. For this reason, we have chosen to study composite film 

of rather weak super-hydrophilicity persistence in order to better assess morphology 

effects. Thus, composite films were deposited from a sol of rather strong reactivity based 

on a TEOS concentration of 1.5M, a Rw ratio of 2.2 and a pH of 3.5. This sol was then 

mixed with the CS in various proportions. We have been interested in two different 

composites with 20mol% (which will be noted S1-20) and 60mol% (S1-60) of SiO2. Pure 

TiO2 (S1-0) and SiO2 (S1-100) films have also been deposited from the CS and SiO2 sols, 

respectively. 

4.3. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite films 

When the composite sols with desired compositions (S1-0, S1-20, S1-60 and S1-100) were 

obtained, we used the spin-coating method to elaborate the composite layers. For this 

purpose, standard parameters were applied: liquid volume of 300µL, rotation speed of 

3000rpm, duration of rotation of 1s, acceleration of 5000rpm/s. Obtained samples were 



19 

 

heated at 500
o
C for 2 hours to ensure the complete evaporation of the solvent and 

densification of the film. 

This protocol was used to impregnate previously deposited PS films. It was also used to 

deposit TiO2-SiO2 super-hydrophilic films in order to compare how the super-

hydrophilicity influences the deposition of PS films compared to a bare silicon substrate. 

  



20 

 

5. Results and discussion 

5.1. Elaboration of polystyrene (PS) films 

As the spin-coating deposition of layers composed of polystyrene latex beads (purchased 

from Sigma – Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany) relies on numerous parameters, one has 

first to study and define the best deposition conditions and suspension preparation 

parameters leading to closely packed PS beads. This optimization work is described in the 

next sections. 

5.1.1. Deposition conditions 

The purpose is to define experimental conditions in order to obtain 2D layers of closely 

packed polystyrene latex beads with an average diameter d = 0.6µm. PS beads are supplied 

as aqueous suspensions of 10wt% concentration. The colloidal solution in water was 

diluted in solvent in volume proportion 1:9 obtaining a 1wt% PS colloidal suspension. 

Theoretical calculations were done to preliminary define the deposition volume necessary 

to totally cover a substrate (silicon) of dimensions 3×3cm
2
 with closely packed (square 

arrangement) PS beads, taking into account the solution concentration of 1wt%. The 

deposition volume was thus initially fixed at V = 50µL. 

Several manipulations (M) with different conditions were then performed ‘step-by-step’ in 

order to optimize the protocol for PS single-layer elaboration on silicon. 

5.1.1.1. M1: Standard protocol and influence of solvent 

First, the standard protocol habitually employed to deposit composite films (3000rpm, 1s 

of rotation, 5000rpm/s) was tested with two different PS solutions dissolved in absolute 

ethanol (EtOH) or H2O. 

Optical microscope pictures show that one can obtain similar structures for both solvents: 

EtOH and H2O (see Fig. 15). FEG-SEM images show that, although forming small 

domains and still having a lot of large ‘free’ spaces (i.e. uncoated substrate areas), one can 

obtain 2D arrangements of closely packed PS beads with both liquids. However, 

macroscopic observations show that water does not wet correctly the surface of Si 

substrate. As a result, further experiments were carried by using EtOH as a solvent. 

Besides, although the wetting of a PS/EtOH solution was good, the substrate was poorly 



21 

 

covered at the macroscopic level (coverage rate of around 20%). Therefore other 

experimental conditions were tested in following manipulations. 

 

5.1.1.2. M2: Effect of the rotation speed and time 

Secondly, the effect of the rotation speed and time were tested by combining three 

different rotation speeds (1000, 3000 and 5000rpm) and three different rotation times (1, 

10 and 30s) while keeping the acceleration at 5000rpm/s (see Fig. 16). 

Observations show that the best combination that leads to a higher coverage rate (around 

50%) can be obtained with a small rotation speed for a short deposition time. Thus, next 

experimental conditions were defined: 1000rpm, 1s of rotation. To verify the lower limit of 

the rotation speed, a 500rpm speed was also tested. The results show that, although a 

decrease of the rotation speed considerably increases the coverage of the surface (up to 

95%), it yields the formation of multi-layers of PS beads when using a silicon substrate. It 

was thus concluded that the choice of a rotation speed of 1000rpm was adequate and 

suitable for further experiments on silicon.

solvent by using a standard deposition protocol (3000rpm, 1s of rotation, 5000rpm/s).

Fig. 16: Optical images and graphics represent results of different rotation speeds (1000, 

3000 and 5000rpm) and rotation times (1, 10 and 30s) tested with 1wt% PS solution in 

EtOH. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate, 

whose values are plotted in the above curve as a function of studied rotation speeds and 

times 



23 

 

5.1.1.3. M3: Acceleration of the turning plate 

When studying the work of Colson et al. [19], one can see that single-layers of closely 

packed PS beads are favored by a long acceleration step in the spin-coating parameters to 

improve the coverage rate. To assess this effect, tests were performed with a rotation speed 

of 1000rpm and various accelerations on bare Si substrate. 5000rpm/s was chosen as the 

highest and 100rpm/s as the lowest value of acceleration (see Fig. 17). 

 

Contrary to the work of Colson et al. [19], our results show that a better surface coverage is 

obtained with a higher value of acceleration. Thus, 5000rpm/s acceleration was definitively 

adopted for next experiments. 

5.1.1.4. M4: Reproducibility 

The reproducibility of our protocol was tested on bare silicon substrates for different 

experiments in fixed conditions: 1000rpm, 1s of rotation, 5000rpm/s. In these conditions it 

can be shown that it is possible to reasonably reproduce PS single-layers with an average 

coverage of 53 ± 6%. Results are confirmed also by the FEG-SEM observations (see Fig. 

18). 

 

Fig. 17: Optical images representing the influence of the surface coverage when different 

accelerations are applied: 5000rpm/s (left) and 100rpm/s (right). The percentage 

indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate 



24 

 

 

5.1.1.5. M5: Influence of the magnetic agitation and ultrasonic 

treatment 

When technical conditions, related to spin-coating settings, are defined, another factor that 

might influence the coating quality and reproducibility is the dispersion and stability of PS 

beads in the liquid solution. In this case two mixing methods were tested: magnetic 

agitation (MA) and ultrasound dispersion (US). We chose four different timings for US 

(5’, 30’, 1h and 2h), and five timings for MA (5’, 1h, 4h, 6h and 23h) for a 1000rpm 

rotation speed (see Fig. 19). A longer duration of magnetic or ultrasonic agitation leads to a 

slight increase of the coverage rate. However, one can consider that this influence is 

relatively weak. For this reason, a magnetic agitation of two hours has been defined as the 

optimal conditions for solution preparation.

(bottom) images. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage 

rate

represented by optical images and graphics. The percentage indicated in optical images 

corresponds to the coverage rate, whose values are plotted in the above curve as a 

function of studied US and MA durations 



26 

 

5.1.1.6. M6: Influence of the substrate 

We also assessed how the substrate hydrophilicity could influence the deposition of PS 

beads. For this purpose, tests were performed on a silicon substrate preliminary coated 

with a super-hydrophilic composite film and rotation speeds of 500rpm and 1000rpm. 

 

  

 

 

Fig. 20: (a) Optical (top) and FEG-SEM (bottom) images representing the influence of a 

rotation speed of 500rpm tested on different surfaces: bare Si (left) and Si pre-coated 

with super-hydrophilic film (right); (b) Optical images representing the influence of a 

rotation speed of 1000rpm tested on different surfaces: bare Si (left) and Si pre-coated 

with super-hydrophilic film (right) 



27 

 

Fig. 20 shows that the substrate influence strongly depends on the speed rotation: 

1) 500rpm: A strong coverage rate (around 95%) is obtained whatever the substrate 

hydrophilicity. However, in contrast to a bare Si substrate (section 5.1.1.2), in the 

case of a pre-coated substrate the multi-layer formation is observed only in some 

localized regions where particle aggregates are formed, and the major part of the 

substrate is covered with an aggregate-free 2D layer of closely packed PS particles 

(see Fig. 20a). 

2) 1000rpm: A 2D layer of closely packed PS particles is obtained whatever the 

substrate hydrophilicity. However, compared to a bare Si substrate, the pre-

deposition of a super-hydrophilic coating strongly enhances the coverage rate from 

about 50% to about 75% (see Fig. 20b). 

Thus, these observations open the way to different options of PS particle coatings for the 

subsequent impregnation of composite sols. 

5.1.2. Parameters for suspension preparation 

Once the technical (spin-coating) parameters and deposition conditions are better 

determined, one has to improve and determine the parameters of the solution preparation 

that influence the surface coverage. New studies (NS), performed on bare Si substrates, are 

discussed in the following sub-sections. 

5.1.2.1. NS1: Influence of concentration 

First of all, different concentrations of PS in EtOH were tested. Different dilution rates of 

the initial 10wt% PS solution in water were chosen: dilution by a factor 0, 2, 5 and 10 that 

corresponds, respectively, to solutions with a 10, 5, 2 and 1wt% concentration. Deposition 

on both, bare Si and Si substrates coated with a super-hydrophilic film were performed for 

1000rpm rotation conditions (see Fig. 21). 



28 

 

 

The observations show that a quasi-complete surface coverage can be obtained already 

with a PS concentration of 2wt% whatever the substrate hydrophilicity. However, one 

starts to observe the formation of rather inhomogeneous multi-layer regions that are not 

necessarily favorable to the objective of the work: post-impregnation of a composite sol. 

Therefore a PS concentration of 1wt% was definitely retained for further studies. 

 

Fig. 21: Influence of the PS solution concentration represented by optical (top, middle) 

and FEG-SEM (bottom) images. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds 

to the coverage rate 



29 

 

5.1.2.2. NS2: Influence of deposited volume 

Another parameter to be assessed is the volume of deposited solution, so that the layer 

covers the whole substrate. Four values of deposition volume were chosen: 50, 100, 250 

and 500µL for a bare Si substrate coated at 1000rpm with a 1wt% solution (see Fig. 22). 

As a result, when observed with OM, one can see that the coverage rate does not depend 

significantly on the deposited volume (see Fig. 22a). However, macroscopic observations 

show that the substrate is completely covered when the deposition volume is V = 100µL 

(see Fig. 22b). Accordingly, V = 100µL has been defined as the deposition volume of the 

PS/EtOH solution (instead of the calculated volume, V = 50µL, used in previous studies).

(a) microscopic scale with OM and (b) comparison of two samples in macroscopic scale.

5.1.3. Conclusion: Model conditions 

Finally, one can summarize this experimental work by model conditions yielding most 

promising results to obtain PS 2D layers on bare Si substrates as well as on hydrophilic 

pre-coated substrates (see Table 1). These model conditions will be used for following 

studies.

Besides, owing to better results obtained on hydrophilic substrates, we have chosen this 

option in the following parts of this work. Accordingly, PS 2D layers were deposited on 

sub-layers of four different composite materials: S1-0 (pure TiO2), S1-20, S1-60 and S1-

100 (pure SiO2). Composite sub-layers were deposited as described in section 4.3. After 

deposition of PS beads, samples were placed for 5 min into a furnace at 110
o
C to ensure 

the complete evaporation of the solvent and better attachment of PS beads onto the sub-

layer. Then, the bi-layer samples were impregnated with a composite sol with a 

composition identical to that of the sub-layer. This impregnation was done by spin-coating 

in conditions used for sub-layer deposition (section 4.3). After impregnation, the samples 

were placed for 2 hours in a furnace at 500
o
C to ensure the calcination of PS particles and 

subsequent creation of a porous/rough structure in the composite films. 

5.2. Study of PS + composite multilayer films 

5.2.1. Preliminary observations 

Preliminary experiments of impregnation were done with a S1-60 TiO2-SiO2 composite 

sol. The samples were observed by optical microscopy, first of all just after deposition of 

PS beads at 1000rpm on a super-hydrophilic sub-layer, and then after post-impregnation of 

the composite sol and thermal treatment. As well, FEG-SEM characterization was done to 

verify the surface structure and obtain information on the morphologic characteristics of 

the samples (see Fig. 23). 



31 

 

 

As it is seen from Fig. 23, after impregnation and thermal treatment (2h at 500
o
C) is done, 

one can observe that the pattern of PS layer is maintained, i.e. the coverage rate. FEG-SEM 

images show that the composite material enrobes the PS beads and, after calcination, the 

composite material adopts a particulate morphology with a geometry very similar to that of 

the initial PS coating, which probably suggests that the composite coating exhibits a porous 

shell-like structure. This structure would arise from the capping of previously deposited PS 

beads by the composite sol, followed by the burning out of PS beads during calcination. 

 

Fig. 23: Optical (left) images characterizing samples before (top) and after (bottom) 

impregnation with hydrophilic TiO2-SiO2 composite S1-60. The FEG-SEM images (top 

view and tilted sample view) on right illustrate morphology of a composite coating after 

post-impregnation. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the 

coverage rate 



32 

 

The next try was to test the impregnated volume of composite sol. The previously defined 

volume 300µL was increased 2 and 3 times: 600µL and 900µL, respectively. As it is seen 

in Fig. 24, the increase of the composite sol volume for the impregnation layer does not 

change significantly the morphology of the composite surface. Thus, the volume for 

impregnations was defined as Vcomp = 300µL for further experiments. 

 

5.2.2. Study of reference composite films 

Reference composite films directly deposited on Si substrates without PS beads were then 

investigated. Roughness of the surface was studied by FEG-SEM and AFM and 

characterized by RMS (Root Mean Square, measured in nm) function. Fig. 25 shows that 

the surface roughness of reference S1-0, S1-20 and S1-60 composite films are as follows: 

RMSS1-0 = 4.8nm, RMSS1-20 = 4.6nm and RMSS1-60 = 3.6nm. No roughness could be 

measured on a S1-100 film, which indicates a very smooth surface of the pure SiO2 film. 

As it is seen, the RMS values are not high in none of the cases.

34 

 

The evolutions of water contact angle over aging of these reference films are illustrated in 

Fig. 26. It is observed that pure TiO2 (S1-0) and SiO2 (S1-100) films rapidly lose their 

initial super-hydrophilicity. In comparison, the super-hydrophilicity loss is slower for S1-

20 and S1-60 composite films, which provides new illustration of the specific wettability 

properties of such films. However, compared to best films optimized in the thesis of M. 

Houmard, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the super-hydrophilicity loss of S1-20 and S1-

60 films over aging is much faster in the present case. As explained before, it is due to the 

much greater sol-gel reactivity of SiO2 sols chosen in the present work compared to the 

very weak reactivity of best sols optimized by M. Houmard. It should also be noticed that 

aging data illustrated in Fig. 26 exhibit some experimental dispersion and that pure TiO2 

(S1-0) films yield more dispersed wettability data over aging than other studied 

compositions. In agreement with previous studies performed at LMGP, this greater 

dispersion depicts that, compared to other compositions, pure TiO2 films exhibit a greater 

sensitivity to fluctuations of the pollution conditions over aging, for example relative 

humidity and/or temperature variations of the room atmosphere. 

 



35 

 

 

In the following, we study how the pre-deposition of PS beads influences the roughness of 

composite coatings, and how roughness effects influence the wettability of such coatings 

compared to those directly deposited on silicon substrates without PS beads.

materials directly deposited on silicon without PS beads. The main figure compares the 

kinetics measured on S1-20 (?) and S1-60 (?) films. The insert compares the same 

variations for S1-0 (?) and S1-100 (?) films. For each composition, two series of 

samples were studied 



36 

 

5.3. Morphology of PS + composite films 

First of all, concerning PS beads deposition, one has to remind that two different 

experiments (with rotation speeds of 500rpm and 1000rpm) were held in parallel. As it was 

mentioned before, the morphology of samples was studied with FEG-SEM and AFM 

measurements and characterized by RMS function. Morphological characteristics arising 

from both studied rotation speeds for S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS, S1-60+PS and S1-100+PS 

composite films are summarized in Fig. 27, Fig. 28, Fig. 29 and Fig. 30, respectively. 

5.3.1. Surface coverage 

First of all, one can observe that the lower rotation speed (500rpm) yields higher surface 

coverage that is confirmed with both optical microscope images (threshold statistics) and 

AFM images. Optical images (see top pictures) show that well dispersed coated regions 

constituted of homogeneous particles can be obtained with three composites: S1-0+PS, S1-

20+PS and S1-60+PS. Meanwhile, in the case of composites S1-100+PS (pure SiO2 with 

PS), the coverage rate is strangely weaker and one observes the formation of rather 

continuous coated areas coexisting with large zones without any coating. These 

observations are confirmed also by AFM images (compare middle images of Fig. 27 to 

Fig. 30). Particular features observed in case of the S1-100+PS composite films are not yet 

explained and further research must be done.

41 

 

5.3.2. RMS Roughness 

3D representations in AFM images (see the third row in Fig. 27 to Fig. 30) confirm that the 

roughness of the samples is considerably increased by composite impregnation on the 2D 

layer of PS nanoparticles in both experiments (with rotation speeds 1000rpm and 500rpm) 

comparing to pure reference composite films. All RMS roughness values are summarized 

in Table 2.

experiments with different rotations speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm)

As seen from data in Table 2, in the case of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS 

composites, the deposition of a 2D PS beads layer before composite impregnation leads to 

an increase of the RMS value by about two orders of magnitude. In contrast, S1-100+PS 

films show much lower RMS values. In addition, while in cases of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS 

and S1-60+PS composites the RMS value increases with the increase of the surface 

coverage rate, i.e. the decrease of the rotation speed, the RMS value of S1-100+PS 

composite films strongly decreases. On the one hand and as mentioned before, the results 

for S1-100+PS films are not yet clear and further research must be done. On the other 

hand, further attention must be paid to other three samples S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-

60+PS, as illustrated in Fig. 31. This figure compiles roughness and coverage rate data of 

these samples for both studied rotation speeds. It appears that the film roughness 

continuously increases with the coverage rate of PS beads, irrespectively of the TiO2-SiO2 

composition. It means that the final morphology is essentially controlled by the surface 

density of initially deposited PS beads. 



42 

 

 

5.3.3. Rough/porous structures 

Finally, FEG-SEM images are used to complete this analyze on the surface morphology of 

composite + PS films. These images confirm the rough structure that is obtained after post-

impregnation of composite sols on a 2D layer of PS beads (see the fourth row in Fig. 27 to 

Fig. 30). All these observations allow concluding that, except in case of S1-100 films, the 

deposition of PS beads and post-impregnation of composite sols leads to films with 

strongly rough surface morphology compared to naturally smooth films directly deposited 

on silicon.

coverage rate for S1-0(+PS) (?), S1-20(+PS) (?) and S1-60(+PS) (?) films deposited 

with rotation speed 1000rpm and 500rpm. In this compilation, rotation speeds are not 

distinguished. The line is drawn to guide the eye 



43 

 

5.4. Water contact angle of composite + PS films 

Water contact angles measured over 6 (experiment with 500rpm) and 11 (experiment with 

1000rpm) weeks of aging on S1-X+PS composite films are summarized in Fig. 32 and 

compared to reference films without PS beads (data from Fig. 26). 

As one can observe, compared to water contact angle measurements for reference 

composite films without PS, the super-hydrophilicity persistence is considerably increased 

in three cases: S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS. These observations are coherent with 

morphology features illustrated in Fig. 25 to Fig. 30, showing that the strong roughness 

increase induced by PS beads for S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS composite films 

promotes an important super-hydrophilicity enhancement. In contrast, S1-100+PS 

composite films do not show any improvement compared to reference S1-100 films. It 

even seems that the super-hydrophilicity loss is faster in the former case for the 1000rpm 

speed. These observations confirm that S1-100+PS films constitute a particular case that 

will require further studies for better understanding. Finally, it should be mentioned that, 

while PS beads strongly reduce the super-hydrophilicity loss of S1-0 films, aging data for 

S1-0+PS films are still very dispersed compared to S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS films, which 

is in agreement with data illustrated in Fig. 26 in the absence of PS beads. 



44 

 

 

 

 

Fig. 32: Kinetics of water contact increase over aging for S1-X composite films 

deposited on silicon and S1-X+PS films deposited with a rotation speed of 500rpm (top) 

and 1000rpm (bottom). Main figures compare the kinetics measured on S1-20 films with 

(?) or without PS (?) and S1-60 films with (?) or without PS (?). The inserts compare 

the same variations for S1-0 films with (?) or without PS (?) and S1-100 films with (?) 

or without PS (?) 



45 

 

These observations are completed in Fig. 33, which compares the water contact angle 

measured after 6 weeks of aging on reference composite samples and S1-X+PS samples 

obtained from both studied rotation speeds. This figure shows that, while roughness 

features enhance the super-hydrophilicity persistence of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-

60+PS samples, wettability properties are much better on both latter samples, which 

provides new evidence of the intrinsic effects of TiO2-SiO2 granular interfaces on the 

super-hydrophilicity of composite films. Besides, Fig. 33 suggests that the rotation speed 

also influences the wettability properties of these samples. As explained before, the 

rotation speed used for PS beads deposition controls their coverage rate, which in turn 

governs the final roughness of S1-X+PS composite films.

without UV irradiation as a function of the SiO2 sol molar composition: reference 

composite samples (?, a)  and composite + PS films with rotation speeds 1000rpm (?, b) 

and 500rpm (?, c).  Data of Fig. 33a correspond to average values derived from Fig. 26. 

Data of Fig. 33b have been extrapolated from fits presented in Fig. 32. The lines are 

drawn to guide the eye 



46 

 

Accordingly, we have compiled in Fig. 34 water contact angle values measured after 6 

weeks of aging on S1-20 and S1-60 films formed in the absence or in the presence of PS 

beads deposited with both rotation speeds. In this figure, we have not presented data 

derived from S1-0+PS and S1-100+PS samples owing to dispersed data arising from the 

formers and specific features arising from the latters. It seems that, while roughness effects 

induced by PS beads strongly enhance the super-hydrophilicity persistence of both kinds of 

composite films, this influence is not necessarily confirmed when the roughness increases 

about a certain threshold value. It would suggest that above this threshold, roughness and 

composition effects are not the only ones involved in the wettability of composite films. Of 

course, this observation will require future experiments to draw more precise conclusions.

20(+PS) (?) and S1-60(+PS) (?) films deposited with rotation speeds 1000rpm and 

500rpm (data are from Fig. 33). In this compilation, rotation speeds are not distinguished 

and the line is drawn to guide the eye

6. Conclusions 

In this work, we have shown that it is possible to create sample surfaces with 2D layers of 

closely packed and well arranged PS beads of diameter 0.6?m by spin-coating method. 

After calcination of PS beads, post-impregnated TiO2-SiO2 composite sols, which naturally 

yield a rather small surface roughness when deposited on Si substrate, lead to an artificially 

rough/porous surface morphology of S1-X+PS films with a RMS roughness value 

increased by about two orders of magnitude compared to similar films deposited without 

PS beads. Compared to reference films without PS, water contact angle measurements on 

composite + PS films have shown a strong increase of super-hydrophilicity persistence, 

especially for composite films S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS. The super-hydrophilicity of these 

films persists often 6 weeks of aging under ambient atmosphere without UV radiation, i.e. 

the water contact angle remains close to 5
o
. For both films composition, this work also 

suggests some relation between: 1) the surface coverage of PS beads, 2) the surface 

roughness/porosity of S1-X+PS films, and 3) the super-hydrophilicity persistence of these 

films. Further studies are required to precise this relation, which introduces future 

perspectives to this work. 

Several parameters concerning PS films elaboration, such as PS beads size, solution 

concentration, rotation speed and time, acceleration, deposition volume etc., that all might 

influence the creation of closely-packed single-layer of PS beads, must be further studied 

in order to vary the surface coverage, which in turn controls the values of post-

impregnation RMS roughness. This effect is already observed when comparing both 

experiments with different rotation speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm). As well, other 

conditions that concern TiO2-SiO2 composite sols, such as solution concentration, 

deposition volume etc., must be tested so that the post-impregnation of composite sols 

would lead to surface morphologies varied in an extended range of roughness/porosity. 

Further studies in that sense are presently in progress.
