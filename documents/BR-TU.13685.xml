“In Europe, during the latter half of the 17th century, Newton and 
Leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus, which grew, 
with the stimulus of applied work that continued through the 18th 
century, into analysis topics such as the calculus of variations, ordinary 
and partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, and generating

ABSTRACT 

Nowadays, significant research effort in low-permeability rocks (a wide 
tendency elsewhere and soon in the Brazilian petroleum industry) has 
been focused on pore-scale petrophysics, morphologies and 
distributions, as well as fluid flow circulation described by the values of 
permeability. The evaluation of these properties in turn is essential for 
the assessment and exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves; however, 
determining pore system parameters in such rocks as tight gas 
sandstones (TGS) and seal rocks (SR) remains challenging because of 
the extreme variability in depositional environments resulting in 
complex pore structures comprised by clays and length scales from sub-
microns to Angstroms. In this work we applied a set of techniques to 
characterize submicron-pore structures in TGS and SR. Therefore it was 
divided into two main topics of interest: (i) Characterization of 
petrophysical properties and pore systems in very low permeability TGS 
using Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP), Low Field Nuclear Magnetic 
Resonance (LFNMR), Nitrogen Gas Adsorption (N2GA), Mercury 
Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) and Multi-scale 3D X-ray Nano- 
and MicroCT (down to 0.7 ?m resolution) techniques; (ii) Study of 
Photoacoustic Spectrometry (PAS) for determining thermal diffusivity 
(TD) and porosity in three seal rocks originating from dissimilar fields 
as a key issue for safe exploration, storage purposes (CO2 sequestration) 
and developments in shale characterization. The values obtained for TD 
were between 0.01667 and 0.09298 (cm2/s) while porosity ranged from 
1.42 to 9%. For the analyzed TGS the 3D pore-structure characterization 
lead to pore tortuosity and shape factors ranges of 2.19-5.47 and 3.2-8.5, 
respectively, and pore size distributions tended to be bimodal for MICP, 
trimodal for 3D multi-scale and tetramodal for LFNMR measurements. 
The porosity values ranged from 1.94 to 11.96% obtained by the 
combination of N2GA and MICP techniques and permeability from 
0.036 to 0.00066 mD by PDP technique. The measured pore-structure 
parameters were also used to predict empirical permeability in TGS 
(using e.g. Carman-Kozeny (Dullien, 1992) and Coates (1999) models). 
The set of applied methods has shown to be a useful tool for the 
unconventional reservoir characterization since it allows obtaining pore 
morphological and quantitative parameters which account for the 
permeability values.  
 
Key-words: Tight gas sandstones, Seal rocks, rocks characterization

RESUMO 

Hoje as pesquisas em rochas de baixa permeabilidade (grande tendência 
no mundo e em breve na indústria petrolífera brasileira) se voltam à 
escala de poros seja para investigação petrofísica, morfológica, de 
distribuição de tamanhos de grãos ou poros ou escoamento de fluidos, 
prática descrita pelos valores de permeabilidade. A avaliação destas 
propriedades por sua vez, é essencial ao desenvolvimento e exploração 
de reservas de hidrocarbonetos. No entanto, a determinação de 
parâmetros do sistema poroso nessas rochas, arenitos de baixa 
permeabilidade (TGS) e rochas selantes (SR), continua a ser um grande 
desafio devido à extrema variabilidade de ambientes deposicionais e 
complexa microestrutura composta por argilas e tamanhos de poros de 
submícrons a ångströms. Nesta tese empregou-se um conjunto de 
técnicas experimentais para a caracterização da estrutura porosa de TGS 
e SR. De tal modo, o trabalho foi dividido em dois tópicos principais: (i) 
Caracterização do sistema poroso e propriedades petrofísicas em TGS 
utilizando-se as técnicas de permeabilidade por decaimento de pulso 
(PDP), NMR de baixo campo, adsorção gasosa N2 (N2GA), porosimetria 
por intrusão Hg (MICP), nano- e microtomografia de raios X (res.&amp;lt;0,7 
?m); (ii) Estudo por espectrometria fotoacústica (PAS) em SR de 
distintos campos geológicos para a determinação de porosidade e 
difusividade térmica (TD), de forma a estimular a exploração segura de 
gás e óleo, o armazenamento de CO2, bem como a caracterização de 
folhelhos. Para SR os valores de TD variaram entre 0,0167 e 0,0930 
(cm2/s) e a porosidade entre 1,42 e 9%; para TGS a caracterização 3D da 
estrutura porosa forneceu valores de tortuosidade e fator de forma entre 
2,19-5,47 e 3,2-8,5. As distribuições de tamanho de poros mostraram-se 
bimodais nos ensaios MICP, trimodais na multiescala 3D e tetramodais 
na NMR, enquanto a porosidade pela combinação N2GA e MICP variou 
entre 1,94 e 11,96% e a permeabilidade PDP de 0,036 a 0,00066 mD. 
Alguns dos parâmetros microestruturais obtidos em TGS foram 
correlacionados na estimativa de permeabilidade utilizando-se modelos 
como Carman-Kozeny (Dullien, 1992) e Coates (1999). O conjunto de 
técnicas e metodologias aplicado nesta tese mostrou ser ferramenta 
imprescindível na caracterização de rochas de baixa permeabilidade, 
uma vez que permitem integrar atributos da rede de poros que 
influenciam nas macro-propriedades das rochas analisadas. 
 

Palavras-chave: Arenitos de baixa permeabilidade, rochas selantes, 
caracterização de rochas.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Materials characterization 
 In material science and engineering, characterization refers to the 
application of external techniques (experimental analyses) to probe into 
the internal structure and properties of a material (WIKIPEDIA). 
Fundamentally, material science is the investigation of the relationship 
among processing, structure, properties, and performance of materials – 
which comprises a systematic characterization (CALLISTER, 2002). In 
Figure 1.1 this relationship is summarized considering that in the 
characterization of natural materials such as reservoir rocks from the 
petroleum industry, the processing can be simply replaced by extraction 
process, once that the analyzed material (natural rock) had been already 
processed for ages.

of extraction for the case of rock’s analysis (modified from NATIONAL 
RESEARCH COUNCIL, 1989). 

 Understanding the relationship among structure, properties, 
processing/origin, and performance of materials is fundamental for any 
technological development and benefit to the society. In the beginning 
of the material science, humans began to make tools from stone; started 
to hammer or cast bronze in a variety of shapes; use iron and steel as 
stronger and cheaper material changing drastically daily life of a 
common person; and finally many new types of materials have been 
introduced, such as ceramic, semiconductors, polymers, composites, etc. 
All these events are historically associated to Ages to be known as Stone

? Bronze ? Iron Age; and why not add the Advanced Materials Age. 
Material engineers and scientists are at the head of new technologies, 
process fabrication and characterization. Theu push forward the 
boundaries of science and engineering interacting with researchers and 
professionals of every discipline, including the petroleum engineering. 
Research and development on petroleum engineering areas can assure a 
safe and optimized hydrocarbon extraction leading to the increase and 
autonomy of the energy in all sectors of societies worldwide.  

1.2. Motivation and context 

1.2.1. World primary energy demand and hydrocarbons role 

 According to YUSGIANTORO (2004): 
 “There is a sheer importance of energy for the evolution of 
mankind. Petroleum has long been the main source in the world 
energy and is expected to remain into the 21st century. However, 
there are challenges in the years ahead in an industry which is 
highly competitive and operates at the sharp end of technology. 
E.g., producers must meet the estimate rising oil and gas demand 
in a manner which is both timely and compatible with such 
objectives as sustainable development and social, economic and 
environmental harmony.” 

Additionally new energy resources must be developed to assure the 
development of societies. Figure 1.2 shows the world primary energy 
demand (in million tons of oil equivalents) by sector and type for 2008 
and the perspective for 2035 (WEO-2011).  
 In Figure 1.2 it is possible to see that (referring to the sum of 
these resources) even for the years ahead, all the economy sectors will 
stay reliant on the gas, oil and coal natural resources. Facing the needs 
of the global energy scenario, the search for hydrocarbon resources is 
intensified pressuring to enhance the recovery in conventional 
reservoirs, and even further: to the exploration and development of 
resources once considered impracticable - the unconventional reservoirs. 
In this context and in view of the growing production from rocks with 
small pore sizes, closely analyzing the properties of rocks of 
unconventional reservoirs becomes increasingly important for geologists 
and petrophysicists, as recovery of gas and oil from fine-grained 
sandstones, siltstones, and shale blurs the distinction between reservoir 
and seal (NELSON, 2009).

1.2.2. Insights about the petroleum system 

 The petroleum system is a unifying concept that encompasses all 
of the disparate elements and processes of petroleum geology. Practical 
application of petroleum systems can be used in exploration, resource 
evaluation, and research. The essential elements of a petroleum system 
include (MAGOON and BEAUMONT, 1999; HAO et al., 2000): 

- Source rock; 
- Reservoir rock; 
- Seal rock; 
- Overburden rock. 

Linking these elements to the processes of petroleum geology (trap 
formation and hydrocarbon generation–migration–accumulation) is an 
effective exploration approach. Mapping and studying a petroleum 
system helps explorationists predict which traps will contain petroleum 
and which will not. It also helps them focus on that part of a region that 
will most likely contain accumulations (MAGOON and BEAUMONT, 
1999). Figure 1.3(a) exemplifies a cross section showing a structural 
anticline trap where the oil and gas accumulation is performed by the 
seal (cap) rock capacity. One can also see the primary and secondary

migration processes. Primary migration is the process by which 
hydrocarbons are expelled from the source rock into an adjacent 
permeable carrier bed (reservoir rock). Secondary migration is the 
movement of hydrocarbons along the reservoir rock from the source 
area to the trap. Migration mostly takes place as one or more separate 
hydrocarbons phases (gas or liquid depending on pressure and 
temperature conditions). The ideal situation for the petroleum industry 
recovery would be to have reservoir rocks comprised by enough amount 
of connected pores (effective porosity) attributing considerable values of 
permeability to the explored oil/gas field. 
1.2.3. From conventional to unconventional reservoirs 

 For more than 100 years conventional resources have been the 
focus of the oil and gas industry. Although conventional and 
unconventional oil and gas come from the same original geologic 
formations (sediments accumulated in multiple layers in sediment basins 
all over the world) they have distinct characteristics. Conventional 
reservoirs are resources from which no special exploration process 
needs to be applied in the recovery since rock and fluid characteristics 
typically permit oil or natural gas to flow readily into wellbores. Usually 
they show high to medium permeability values (&gt; 0.6 mD) and are 
drilled vertically just by the natural pressure of the wells and pumping 
or compression operations. On the other hand, unconventional reservoirs 
require special recovery operations in order to make it monetarily 
viable; they do not produce economic volumes of oil and gas without 
assistance from massive stimulation treatments or special processes and 
technologies, such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection (NAIK, 
2004). Unconventional reservoirs have low permeability (&lt;0.1 mD 
going even to the nD order) and are usually drilled horizontally or by 
multistage hydraulic fracturing (NAIK, 2004; PERRY and LEE, 2007). 
The optimum drilling, completion and stimulation methods for each 
well are a function of the reservoir characteristics and the economic 
situation. Like conventional hydrocarbon systems, unconventional gas 
reservoirs are characterized by complex geological and petrophysical 
systems as well as heterogeneities — at all scales (RUSHING et al., 
2008). 
 The unconventional gas resources (tight gas, coalbed methane, 
and shale) will play a significant role in world energy supply because of 
their potential to offset declines in conventional oil and gas production 
(DARABI et al., 2012; PHILIPPE &amp;amp; PARTNES, 2011). In conventional

reservoirs hydrocarbons are stored in the interconnected pore spaces of 
sands and carbonates and often sourced from proximal organic-rich 
shales; in shale gas or tight gas reservoirs, they are stored in 
interconnected pore space (mineral matrix) or adsorbed onto organic 
matter (kerogen or bitumen) and often sourced from the same reservoir 
rock. Figure 1.3(b) depicts, e.g., a schematic geology of natural gas from 
where one can see the main differences within reservoir characteristics 
and recovery processes; Figure 1.4 illustrates the principle of the natural 
resource triangle available in the world and studied by different authors.

distributed log-normally in nature (MASTERS, 1979). As it can be seen 
in the scale on the right side of Figure 1.4 the hard part is finding high 
permeability gas and oil fields. Once you find a high-grade deposit, 
recovery producing in the resource is rather easy and straightforward. 
The common theme is that low quality deposits of gas/oil require 
improved technology and adequate gas prices before they can be 
developed and produced economically; however, in deposit volumes 
they are much larger if compared to high quality ones (WIKIPETRO – 
Tight Gas Reservoirs).

 Since the 1950s, the oil and gas industry has been completing and 
fracture treating low permeability wells in the United States. Nowadays 
the unprecedented interest worldwide, the high resource volume, long-
term potential and attractive prices bring the unconventional gas and oil 
reserves into the forefront of our energy future. Figure 1.5 shows the 
United States conventional and unconventional gas/oil reserves 
transformation from 1980 to 2035 (a) according to WEO-2012 data; and 
(b) illustrated the gas evolution for China, Canada and US in 2008 and 
2035 (source: EIA). As one can see for US in 2008, more than half of 
gas production was already ensued from unconventional fields. Also for 
Canada and China in 2035 the prevision reaches 50 and 70%, 
respectively. In this context it is significant that Brazil advances 
developments and studies in unconventional resources to assure the 
prospects of the Brazilian energy matrix.

 The awareness into the characteristics of pore-structure 
continuum provides a useful insight for considering the emplacement 
and exploration of petroleum in consolidated siliciclastics and fluid flow 
through fine-grained source rocks now being exploited as reservoirs 
(NELSON, 2009). For example, if we consider the size order of 
hydrocarbon molecules (ranging from 0.01 ?m for asphaltenes to 
0.00038 ?m for methane) and compare it to the pore-throat sizes found 
in different reservoir rocks: 

- conventional reservoir rocks:  generally greater than 2 ?m; 
- tight gas sandstones: from about 2 to 0.03 ?m; 
- shale: from 0.1 to 0.005 ?m (NELSON, 2009); 
- seal (cap) rocks: from 0.1 to 0.002 ?m (SCHMITT et al., 2013). 

One can see that even being comprised of a fine-grained pore-structure, 
both tight gas sandstones (TGS) and shale might have stored

considerably amount of hydrocarbon (mainly gases) in their structure; 
the recovery process, though, particularly for shale needs to be 
stimulated by the usage of specific methods such as hydraulic fracturing. 
On the other hand in seal rocks the pore geometries and sizes need to be 
formerly settled to impede the escape of hydrocarbons from the 
reservoir rock, assuring a successful recovery in conventional reservoirs. 
Only by understanding the structure of pore networks can engineers and 
geologists make more accurate predictions of producible gas/oil and 
optimize its extraction (BUTCHER and LEMMENS, 2011). 
 Currently, significant research effort in oil and gas field 
reservoirs are focused on pore-scale petrophysics, grain distribution, 
pore geometry and distribution besides the fluid flow circulation. 
Textural and structural facies analysis also provided an important 
potential database for the assessment of parameters controlling the 
reservoir quality (BENZAGOUTA, 2012). In the present work a textural 
and morphological pore structure evaluation is done for the low 
permeability reservoir rocks: tight gas sandstones and seal rocks.  
 The seal rocks’ investigation will help in judging the sealing 
efficiency of these rocks once that for the conventional reservoirs 
exploration higher pressures have been applied every day. Additionally 
it will give incites to the shale rocks characterization considering the 
similarity between the microstructure of both rocks. Therefore three seal 
rocks originated from distinct geological oil/gas fields were investigated 
by Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS) procedure to determine the 
thermal diffusivity and porosity. The results were compared with 
textural and mineralogical information obtained by Field Emission 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) 
techniques. Tight gas sandstones from dissimilar gas fields had 
petrophysical properties and pore structure parameters characterized by 
usage of Nitrogen Gas Adsorption (N2GA), Mercury Intrusion Capillary 
Pressure (MICP), Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LFNMR), 
X-ray Nano and Micro Computed Tomography (NanoCT and 
MicroCT), Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP), FESEM and XRD 
techniques. After performing and optimizing a single-phase gas flow 
permeability characterization using the pulse-decay permeability (based 
in the transient method), we could compare the predicted permeability 
values to the obtained PDP experimental data. For the prediction of 
permeability distinct models were applied having as input data the pore 
structure parameters measured in this work by the set of techniques.

1.3. Objectives 
 The main objective is to develop and apply a compendium3 of 
techniques for the pore structure characterization in low permeability 
reservoir rocks since the desire to acquire understanding of these rocks 
has become a wide tendency in the petroleum industry in Brazil and 
elsewhere. Thereby we divided this thesis in two main topics of 
interested to accurately evaluate the analyzed rocks: 

- Characterization of petrophysical properties and pore 
structure morphology on very low permeability tight gas 
sandstones using  distinct methodologies and techniques; 

- Usage of the Photoacoustic Spectroscopy technique to 
determine the thermal diffusivity and porosity in seal rocks 
(overlaying conventional reservoirs) as a key issue for safe 
exploration, storage purposes (CO2 sequestration) and 
developments in shale characterization (also a very fine 
layered porous media and comprised by distinct clays). 

1.3.1. Specific objectives 

 TGS and seal rocks originated from distinct depths and oil/gas 
fields were provided by CENPES/Petrobras and were available for the 
study. As the location of sample is confidential, letters from A to G were 
attributed to the analyzed fields (see Table 4.1). Following the specific 
objectives are described.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW  

2.1. Hydrocarbon generation and migration 
 Hydrocarbon generation is the natural result of the maturation of 
buried organic matter. This organic matter (organic carbon) very often 
consists of microalgae and microorganisms which are deposited in 
aquatic environments, especially on the sea bed. Lagoons and restricted 
seas are favorable for high preservation of organic matter. During 
deposition and at the onset of burial of these sediments, most of the 
materials are dissolved, particularly by oxidation. The remaining part 
contains kerogen which, due to the gradual burial of the sediments 
causing high compression and a sharp rise in temperatures (for very long 
time intervals), is transformed into hydrocarbons by thermal cracking 
(COSSÉ, 1993). 
 Kerogen consists of very large molecules and is a kind of 
polymer. When it has been exposed to sufficient time and temperature 
these large molecules will crack into smaller molecules, mostly 
petroleum. When the temperature is about 100?C a long period of 
geological time is required. In rapidly subsiding basins the exposure 
time is shorter and oil generation may only start at about 140–150?C 
(BJØRLYKKE, 2010). Usually around 120–150oC, the oil is cracked 
yielding first wet and then dry gas (TISSOT and WELTE, 1984; 
BJØRLYKKE, 2010). The “oil window” lies between two temperatures 
levels. It usually corresponds to burial depths among 1 and 3.5 km. The 
depth (temperature) range where oil is generated is called the “oil 
window”. At higher temperatures oil will be altered into gas by cracking 
(BJØRLYKKE, 2010). The general scheme of evolution of the organic 
fraction and the hydrocarbons produced is depicted in Figure 2.1 
(TISSOT and WELTE, 1984) where it is possible to see that organic 
matter undergoes changes in composition with increasing burial depth 
and temperature. The three steps in the transformation of organic matter 
to hydrocarbons are termed diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis. 
Petroleum hydrocarbons exist as gaseous, liquid, and solid phases, 
depending on temperature, pressure, burial time, and composition of the 
system. 
 Petroleum migrates from low permeability source rocks into high 
permeability reservoir rocks from which the petroleum can be produced. 
The main driving force for petroleum migration is buoyancy because it 
is less dense than water. The forces acting against migration are the

capillary forces and the resistance to flow though rocks with low 
permeabilities. It is necessary to assume that oil is mostly transported as 
a separate phase. In order to pass through the narrow passage between 
pores (pore throat), the oil droplets must overcome the capillary forces. 
When the pores are sufficiently small in a fine-grained sediment, these 
forces will act as a barrier to further migration of oil. The small gas 
molecules, however, can diffuse through extremely small pores and thus 
escape from shales which form tight seals for oil (BJØRLYKKE, 2010)

2.2. Related studies and characteristics of analyzed rocks 

2.2.1. Tight gas sandstones 

 A tight gas sandstone (TGS) reservoir is generally characterized 
as a formation with effective permeability less than 0.1 mD (LAW and 
CURTIS, 2002). Unique characteristics make this reservoir poor 
conductor of fluids (BLASINGAME, 2008): 

- Low permeability – which yields poor utilization of reservoir 
pressure, caused in part by depositional (very small grains, 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
14              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

mixed with detrital clays) and diagenetic (clay precipitation, 
massive cementation, pressure compaction, etc) issues. 

- Reservoir heterogeneity – which is dictated by deposition and 
post-deposition (diagenetic) events including vertical 
heterogeneity (layering, laminate, etc), lateral heterogeneity 
(medium to large scale geologic features, e.g., turbidite 
deposition, faults, etc) and differential diagenesis 
(hydrocarbon generation and migration). 

 As a result of storage and flow characteristics that are intimately 
tied to depositional and diagenetic processes in TGS, exploitation of this 
resource requires a comprehensive reservoir description and 
characterization program to identify properties which control 
production. In particular, TGS reservoirs have significant primary and 
secondary porosity4 and pore connectivities dominated by clays and 
slot-like pores. This makes these reservoirs particularly susceptible to 
the effects of overburden stress and variable water saturation (GOLAB 
et al., 2010). Figure 2.2 illustrates the main differences in conventional 
sandstone, near tight and tight gas sandstone reservoirs, according to 
Rezaee et al. (2012). As one can see important morphological and 
textural attributes in the reservoirs (grain size, sorting, packing, shape, 
pore heterogeneities and connected pore orientation) are distinguished. 
For TGS reservoir the grains in the matrix are much more compacted 
and also relative high amount of clay is found in the pore walls.  
 Since the 1970´s when tight gas sandstones reservoirs were 
defined as being the one in which the expected value of permeability to 
gas flow would be less than 0.1 mD, various studies have being focus in 
the optimization of developments in these resources (HOLDITH, 2006; 
NELSON, 2009). Rushing et al. (2008) presented a work-flow to 
describe and characterize tight gas sands making reference to distinct 
methods applied in works at the literature. Clarkson et al. (2011) 
measured small-angle and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (SANS 
                                                        
4 Primary porosity is the porosity preserved from deposition through 
lithification; secondary porosity is the porosity created through alteration of 
rock, commonly by processes such as dolomitization, dissolution and 
fracturing. This type of reservoirs are also called dual-porosity reservoir, a 
rock characterized in which all flow to the well effectively occurs in one 
porosity system, and most of the fluid is stored in the other. These 
reservoirs are layered with extreme contrasts between high-permeability and 
low-permeability layers (OILFIELD GLOSSARY).

and USANS) on tight gas reservoir samples from Western Canada in 
order to determine the applicability of these techniques for 
characterizing the full pore size spectrum and to gain insight into the 
nature of the pore structure and its control on permeability. They used 
N2 and CO2 adsorption to interpret the total porosity distribution 
obtained. Desbois et al. (2011) shown in that the imaging of pore space 
at scales below 1 ?m in tight gas sands remains difficult due to limits in 
resolution and sample preparation, so they explored the use of high 
resolution SEM in combination with argon ion beam cross sectioning 
(BIB, Broad Ion Beam) to prepare smooth, and damage-free, true-2D 
surfaces of TGS, to image porosity down to 10 nm. They evaluated 
textures and porosity though no other properties quantifications were 
performed.

showing the differences between pore connection (REZAEE et al., 
2012).Images on fractured (above) and polished (below) samples acquired 

respectively by SEM and Optical Microscopy.  

   However, using distinct methods and techniques to obtain and 
compare pore structure parameters in tight gas sandstones is kind new 
proceeding. Also the obtained parameters were used in empirical 
permeability models and compared with experimental pulse-decay 
measurements. The low-permeabilities (and porosities) associated with 
tight gas sands can be attributed directly to a large distribution of small 
to very small pores and/or a very tortuous system of pore throats 
connecting those pores (RUSHING et al., 2008). These are some of the 
pore system parameters that can be used to predict empirical

permeability. An understanding of the rock’s pore structure, 
mineralogical composition and petrophysical properties using a 
compendium of techniques will help to judge the exploration potential 
as hydrocarbons reservoirs in the analyzed TGS and also permit the 
estimation of permeability values using distinct methods.  
 

2.2.2. Seal rocks 

 Seal rocks are geological formations with extremely low porosity 
and permeability overlying oil or gas reservoirs, which constitute a 
barrier against the volumetric flow of hydrocarbons into the upper 
layers. Although a seal rock can be considered as a seal to hydrocarbons, 
it is erroneous to regard it as a completely impermeable layer (LI et al., 
2005). Seal rock, also called cap rock, is a crucial and sometimes 
overlooked factor in the evaluation of a potential hydrocarbon 
accumulation. Together with source rocks, reservoir rocks and 
overburden rocks, they represent one of the four essential elements of 
petroleum systems (HAO et al., 2000). 
 The retention of hydrocarbons by overlying seals is controlled by 
the capillary entry pressure, the permeability and the extent of diffusive 
losses (molecular transport) through the fluid-saturated pore space 
(SCHLÖMER and KROOSS, 1997). Today, data on the porosity and 
thermal diffusion of seal rock can find wide usage in the context of 
petroleum and gas exploration and also in the storage of anthropogenic 
CO2 in the subsurface region, e.g. saline aquifers or exploited gas 
reservoirs, e.g. cap rocks are formed in the process of sedimentary rock 
accumulation and so the physical and chemical parameters of these 
rocks change under the influence of lithogenic processes. In general, the 
microstructure of cap rocks is highly complex and anisotropic and 
contains very small-diameter pores (in the order of Angstroms) and 
considerable presence of clays. Therefore, similarly to the 
microstructure of shale from the unconventional reservoirs, seal rock 
morphology is difficult to characterize, making it necessary to use and 
development of distinct methods. Figure 2.3 compares the 
microstructure of a seal rock (a) and a shale (b), where one can observe 
its complexity and presence of small pore sizes for both rocks.

  The precise and accurate knowledge of transport properties of 
rocks and soils are extremely important for investigating the heat flow 
processes in geothermal phenomena and for petrophysical studies of 
geological materials. The determination of such properties has become 
important with the widespread interest in the formation and evolution of 
hydrocarbon resources, with the subsequent extraction of oil and gas. 
The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity depend upon many 
factors such as the thermal parameters of constituent phases, their 
corresponding volume fraction, the contact areas, the shape of particles 
and the type of packing. The porosity of the materials plays also an 
important role among the many factors that influence thermal 
parameters (GUIMARÁES et al, 2013). The most relevant thermal 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
18              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

parameters of rocks are thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal 
diffusivity (FENG et al., 2013; RUBIO, 2013), and these parameters are 
related to the pore structure. The evaluation of seal rocks using the open 
photoacoustic cell (OPC) technique is an accurate and reliable method to 
investigate the thermal diffusivity and in our knowledge not yet done in 
the literature for these rocks, especially when it goes into the topic of 
correlating obtained values of thermal diffusivity to predict porosity. It 
requires a simple experimental setup, few analytical equations to be 
adjusted to the results besides very small quantities of the material to be 
analyzed. Herein we show to be possible from a same experiment to 
obtain the thermal diffusivity and calculate the porosity in very low-
permeability rocks such as seal rocks from conventional reservoir. 

2.3. Insights about reservoir rocks characterization 
 Two basic sources of data for reservoir characterization are from 
specific reservoir data and information from analogous reservoirs 
(JACKSON et al., 1993). Reservoir data (on a range of scales from 
basin to field-scale information, km, to pore size information, 
Angstrons) can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) rock 
properties (the container), (ii) fluid properties (the contents), and (iii) 
rock/fluid interactions. Imbibition is fundamental to oil and gas recovery 
from reservoirs under most secondary and improved recovery processes 
of practical interest. It is also dependent of porous medium wettability. 
The rate and the extent of imbibition depend critically on the viscosity 
of the wetting and nonwetting phases (KOVSCEK et al., 2001). 
 Microscopic (pore-scale) information that affects fluid flow in 
reservoir rocks includes mainly the surface roughness, grain size, sorting 
mineralogy, clay content, pore and throat dimensions, geometry, size, 
distribution and connectivity. The major controls on these features are 
the sediment source (provenance) and the subsequent diagenetic 
processes of compaction, cementation, and dissolution (JACKSON et 
al., 1993). An attempt to correlate pore structure information to 
petrophysical rock properties such as effective porosity and absolute 
permeability is desired in the reservoir characterization. Petrophysics is 
the study of the physical properties of rocks. For a rock to form a 
reservoir (COSSÉ, 1993): 

(a) It must have a certain storage capacity: this property is 
characterized by the porosity; 

(b) The fluids must be able to flow in the rock: this property is 
characterized by the permeability; 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
Mayka Schmitt                                                             19 

(c) It must contain a sufficient quantity and concentration of 
hydrocarbons: the impregnated volume and saturations are 
factors here.   

Measurements of petrophysical properties in core samples can be 
obtained by various techniques such as injection/extraction flow fluids 
or image analysis. In this sub-chapter we describe briefly notions about 
porous media properties and fluid behaviors used in the thesis.   
2.3.1. Porosity and pore size distribution 

 Porosity, which is a measure of the rock's storage capacity, is 
affected not only by the primary depositional processes but also by all 
subsequent diagenetic processes (RUSHING et al., 2008). In a rock 
sample its apparent volume, or total volume (VT), consists of a solid 
volume VS and a pore volume VP, where the porosity (in %) is defined 
(COSSÉ, 1993):

 (2.1) 

 The porosity of interest to the petroleum engineering, that which 
allows the fluids in the pores to circulate, is the effective porosity ?E, 
which corresponds to the pores connected to each other and to other 
formations (COSSÉ, 1993). Therefore the total porosity ?T, 
corresponding to all the pores in an analyzed sample, is defined, whether 
interconnected or not: 

,T E R? ? ?= +  (2.2) 
where ?R is the residual porosity which only takes account of isolated 
pores. Effective porosity is often slightly less than total porosity. 
However, effective porosity in tight gas sandstones is typically much 
lower than the total porosity because of diagenesis. The type and 
magnitude of diagenesis governs the connectivity of the primary 
porosity. Unlike conventional sandstone reservoirs that are characterized 
mostly by a primary intergranular porous system, TGS may exhibit 
several other types of porosity - including both primary and secondary 
inter-granular porosity, detrital matrix porosity, micro-porosity, and 
grain fracture porosity (RUSHING et al., 2008). 
 The effective porosity of rocks varies between less than 1% and 
over 40%. It is often stated that the porosity is (COSSÉ, 1993): 

- Low if ? &amp;lt;5%; 



 

_____________________________________________________________

- Mediocre if 5 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;10%; 
- Average if 10% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;20%; 
- Good if 20% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;30%; 
- Excellent if ? &gt; 30%. 

2.3.1.1. Classification of microporosity  

 Distinct spectrums of pore size distributions (PSD) can be 
observed in the various reservoirs rocks. These spectrums of pore types 
also capture some important petrophysical properties of the pores, so in 
petroleum engineering a pore classification based on the PSD spectrum 
is useful, though varying definitions exist in the literature (CANTRELL 
and HAGERTY, 1999; HILDENBRAND et al., 2005). This is 
exacerbated by the fact that geologists, petrophysicists and engineers 
often have their own definitions. Furthermore, the precise definition 
often depends on the method of observation (BARNETT et al., 2010). 
As presented by LOUCKS et al. (2012) in a study on pore types and 
networks applied to mudrocks (also fine-grained as TGS and seal rocks), 
the pore-size terminology of the International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) moreover defined by Rouquerol et al. 
(1994), might be more appropriate. In this terminology: 

- micropores have widths less than 2 nm; 
- mesopores have widths between 2 and 50 nm, and 
- macropores have widths greater than 50 nm.  

LOUCKS et al. (2012) considered that in this classification, nearly all 
mudrock pores would be grouped with larger pores in carbonates and 
sandstones as macropores (see Figure 2.4, B). Although the pore-size 
classification of ROUQUEROL et al. (1994) may be appropriate for 
chemical membranes, other controlled syntactic materials or even in seal 
rocks (SCHMITT et al., 2013) it is insufficient for most of the reservoir 
systems comprised by a wide pore spectrum and main average pore 
sizes in the micrometer order. Another useful pore classification for 
carbonate rocks was proposed by CHOQUETTE and PRAY (1970), 
within which they provided size modifiers (LOUCKS et al., 2012). They 
defined micropores as being less than 62.5 ?m, mesopores as being 
between 62.5 ?m and 4 mm, and megapores as being between 4 and 256 
mm. These authors included no subdivisions of pores smaller than 62.5 
?m, see “A” in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4: Pore sizes classification according distinct authors: (A) 

COQUETTE and PRAY (1970), (B) IUPAC, (C) AHR et al., (2005), (D) 
CLERKE et al. (2008) and (E) published geological descriptions. 

 According to Barnett et al. (2010), see “C”, “D” and “E” in 
Figure 2.4, distinct authors also have recently defined micropososity 
based on their method of observation. For example, AHR et al., 2005 
(C) defines micropores as those pores with pore throat diameters ? 0.5 
?m and usually containing mostly irreducible water and little 
hydrocarbon; CLERKE et al. (D) propose an alternative scheme 
recognizing three types of microporosity based on pore throat size. This 
classification is useful recognizing that a spectrum of microporosity 
exists based on pore throat diameter from that which is effectively tight 
(Types II and III) to that which can store and flow hydrocarbons (type 
I); these three types are also in agreement with the SOEDER and 
CHOWDIAH (1990) classification for tight gas sandstones. Lastly, (E) 
is a proposed scheme based on published geological descriptions of 
microporosity (BARNETT et al., 2010). In our work only when the 
nitrogen gas adsorption experiments were performed the IUPAC 
classification was assumed; for all other discussions we referred to 
microporosity as described in “D” Figure 2.4.  
 Understanding the abundance, distribution, and spatial 
interrelationships of each pore type is important because each type may 
contribute differently to permeability (LOUCKS et al., 2012). To 
address the questions of pore size distribution in TGS we performed and 
compared distinct techniques and methodologies: N2GA and MICP 
combination, Low Field NMR and Multi-scale 3D X-Ray Tomography.

The pore connectivity, tortuosity and shape factors (also important 
parameters in the permeability prediction), pore aspect ratio, pore 
preferential orientations were measured by usage of X-ray nano- and 
microCT techniques. 
2.3.2. Specific surface area 

 Specific surface area is another significant petrophysical 
parameter for understanding the physics of rocks’ porous media and for 
permeability prediction (HOSSAIN et al., 2011). It is well known in the 
literature that the BET method allows the estimation of specific surface 
areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms on the basis of the multilayer 
adsorption model. The surface area (S) of a solid material is the 
contribution of internal pore boundary area and external sample surface. 
When a material has considerable pore boundary (high porosity or for 
low porosity reservoir clay bearing the pore walls) the fraction of 
external surface area is irrelevant. Therefore, S is closely related to the 
size and volume of pores present in a material being larger as the pores 
get bigger in volume and smaller in size. 
 The specific surface area (So) of a material can be defined as the 
total pore surface area divided by the total volume of solid material (Vs) 
comprised in one analyzed sample (in m-1) or, divided by the sample 
mass (in m2/g), respectively: 

,o
s

S
S

V
=  (2.3) 

.o

Some rocks having extremely small pore sizes show high values of So. In 
shale gas systems (as well seal rocks), nanopores play an important role 
where for the same pore volume, the exposed surface area in nanopores 
is larger than in micropores. This is because surface area is proportional 
to 4/d, where d is the pore diameter (JAVADPOUR et al., 2007).  
 In this context the So results of different methods reflect the 
different properties of pores at different scales. By using a high 
resolution BET (which will be explained later) or a highly smoothed 
surface derived from image analysis, from which usually a much smaller 
value of So is derived (HOSSAIN et al., 2011) and the value is related to 
the used resolution, the values of So can varying in several orders of 
magnitude. In image analysis the most widely method used to calculate

surface area from image analysis is to have an equivalent diameter 
(usually spherical or cylindrical) calculated from the 3D pixel volume 
objects (segmented pores). So considering the object shape as a sphere, 
the volume-equivalent diameter (Dvolume = diameter of a sphere with the 
same volume as the 3D object) is:

Having the sample volume from analyzed 3D images it is possible to 
calculate the values of specific surface area.   
 In the present work So determination is done by N2GA and X-ray 
Nano- and MicroCT techniques. For N2GA BET method is applied 
while for Nano- and MicroCT each obtained resolution is investigated 
using Avizo Fire 7.1 Software on the segmented pore phase and C3DE 
program in the generated equivalent resistor pore network.  
2.3.3. Pore morphological parameter: tortuosity 

 The ability of a rock to store and flow fluids is dependent upon 
the pore volume, pore geometry and its connectivity (KNACKSTEDT et 
al, 2006). Tortuosity is one of the most widely studied petrophysical 
parameters yet it is not very well understood (CLENNELL, 1997; 
ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). Introduced by CARMAN (1937), 
tortuosity accounts for the sinusoidal flow path through a porous 
medium. It is defined as the ratio of effective flow (le) path to the 
macroscopic length of sample (l) having any shape (most are core or 
plug): 

.e
l
l

? =  (2.7) 

 In his work CARMAN (1937) points out that tortuosity affects 
both permeability and the leakage velocity by a factor of (le/l). 
Therefore, further work proposed that the overall factor by which the 
flow is retarded in a tortuous path is proportional to the square of

tortuosity, which is referred to as the hydraulic “tortuosity factor” 
(DULLIEN, 1992; CLENNELL, 1997):

 The tortuosity factor (T) is not a true pore structure parameter, but 
rather a parameter associated with one-dimensional models of pore 
structure. Notwithstanding this, the tortuosity of a porous medium is a 
fundamental property of the streamlines, or lines of flux, in the 
conducting capillaries. It measures the deviation from the macroscopic 
flow direction of the fluid at every point (DULLIEN, 1992). Already 
BEAR and BACHMAT (1966) suggested in their porous medium model 
that the permeability of a porous medium is shown to depend on three 
elementary porous medium properties: porosity (?), average medium 
conductance ( B ) and the medium´s tortuosity (?) (BEAR, 1972). B  is 
related to the cross-sections of the elementary channels through which 
the flow takes place. One should recall that the discussion at this point is 
restricted to the case of laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a porous 
medium, visualized as a network of narrow channels through which 
flow takes place. Figure 2.5 shows a bundle of parallel channels with the 
same diameter (a), with non-uniform diameters (b) and channels with a 
ratio of the length of the flow to the length of the porous medium bigger 
than one, i.e. the tortuosity. Figure 2.6 illustrates a sedimentary rock and 
the increasing of tortuosity as the porosity between the sand grains more 
compacted becomes smaller. Figure 2.7(a) compares the values of 
tortuosity for two distinct geometrical forms.

As an analogy (a) and (b) can exemplify a sandstone and a TGS  showing 

stages of compaction and increase of tortuosity. 

 To calculate pore morphological parameters such as tortuosity, 
shape factor, aspect ratio and characteristic orientation, geometrical 
procedures in the 3D images were calculated using Avizo Fire 7.1 
software. To exemplify, the definition taken by the program to calculate 
tortuosity consists of computing a path formed by centroids of each 
planes of a binary 3D image along the Z-axis (Figure 2.7(b)). Tortuosity 
is the ratio of the length of a curve to the distance between its ends along 
Z-axis. In our case the distance between the ends of a curve is given by 
the number of 2D acquired plans along the Z-axis.

2.3.4. Wettability and capillarity in porous media 

 Oil recovery from low permeability reservoirs is strategically 
important because of the large resources locked in such formations. 
Imbibition is fundamental to oil recovery from such reservoirs under 
most secondary and improved recovery processes of practical interest. It 
is also characteristic of porous medium wettability. The rate and the 
extent of imbibition depend critically on the viscosity of the wetting and 
nonwetting phases (KOVSCEK et al., 2001).  
 Wettability is the term used to describe the relative adhesion of 
two fluids to a solid surface. In a porous medium containing two or 
more immiscible fluids, wettability is a measure of the preferential 
tendency of one of the fluids to wet (spread or adhere to) the surface 
(TIAB and DONALDSON, 2004). The parameter that quantifies 
wettability is the contact angle created by the liquid and solid phases. A 
lower contact angle formed by the intersection of the solid-liquid 
interface, ?SL, implies in a better wettability of the surface. Figure 2.8 
shows distinct configurtions for a liquid in contact to a flat and 
horizontal solid surface.  

 
(a)                                                             (b)

wetting; (b) ?e = 0 showing the favorable surface wetting since the droplet 

covers the completely surface; (c) general three-phase equilibrium 
configuration showing the interfacial tensions.    

In Figure 2.8 the situation (a) the contact angle is greater than 90° 
indicating that the wetting of the surface is unfavorable so the fluid will 
minimize its contact with the surface and form a compact liquid drop.

On the other hand, situation (b) shows the fluid totally spreaded over the 
solid surface area with the contact angle around zero (smaller than 90°) 
and so the wetting of the surface is favorable. Situation (c) illustrates the 
“threephase contact line” where the solid, liquid and vapor phases co-
exist. The static contact angle resulted through a force balance (therefore 
stationary) with respect to an solid surface at the contact line was fisrt 
established by Thomas Young in 1805. In this relationship the generated 
interfacial surface tensions, ?, and the static contact angle ?e of a liquid 
drop on an ideal solid surface was described as (YOUNG, 1805): 

cos ,SV SL
LV

? ?
?

?

where the subscripts SV, SL and LV denote the solid-vapor, solid-liquid 
and liquid-vapor phases, respectively.  
  The tendency for the drop to assume a curved interfacial shape to 
reach its equilibrium is due to its surface tension. As a consequence 
there will be a pressure difference, capillary pressure, across the 
interface with the highest pressure residing on the concave side. The 
capillary pressure in descrived by the Laplace-Young equation, for a 
spherical drop or bubble, rp1 = rp2 = rp and hence (YEO, 2006):

where Pnw and Pw are the pressures of nonwetting and wetting fluids in 
the interface, e. i. inside and outside the drop or buble. A simple model 
explaining what happens in the void space in a rock, is the capillary tube 
(simulating the narrow opening between grains) shown in Figure 2.9. In 
the left side note the capillary rise for the liquid being the wetting phase 
while in the right side the pressure of wetting fluid (Pw) (in this case 
gas) just below the meniscus. In the figure hme is the mechanical 
equilibrium achieved by the liquid column of length h’me and written as

The capillary pressure affects the two-phase flow in a rock, especially 
for low permeability rocks such as tight gas sandstones and seal rocks. 
That capillary pressure could results in a significant contribution to the 
fluid flow through the imbibition of the wetting fluid (COSSÉ, 1993).

Figure 2.9: Capillary tube model showing wetting liquid (left side) and 

wetting gas (right side), (WOLF, 2006). 

 The vast majority of porous media are capillary systems. In a 
“capillary system” the interfaces separating the various bulk phases play 
a significant part in determining the physical-chemical state of the 
system. In these systems, mechanical equilibrium is determined not only 
by the hydrostatic pressure and gravitational attraction but also by forces 
associated with surface tension (DULLIEN, 1992). 
 In this chapter, the discussion is related to the capillary pressure 
and how this important parameter is applied to the characterization of 
porous media, such as tight gas sandstones and seal rocks, containing 
two or more fluids. The capillary pressure curves can be modeled 
intending to describe the pore structure as discussed next. 

2.3.4.1. Capillary mechanisms in heterogeneous reservoirs 

 Capillary imbibition is the spontaneous displacement of a non-
wetting fluid by a wetting fluid (e. g. oil by water) and it is a favorable 
mechanism for hydrocarbons recovery. If we consider a reservoir which 
two different porous media coexist (Figure 2.10, COSSÉ (1993)): 

(i) A fractured reservoir (a); 
(ii) A stratified reservoir (b); 
(iii) A reservoir with average compact nodules (c), as shown below. 

If we denote a permeable medium by “P” and one much less permeably 
by “I” we assume zone P has more large pores than zone I. 
Consequently we expect to have for the same saturation S1 a capillary 
pressure PCI &gt; PCP. When a fluid 1 is injected, it occupies the pores of 
higher permeable medium rapidly, accordingly SWP &gt; SWI at a given 
time, see Figure 2.10(d).

Figure 2.10: Different porous media, a, b and c with the matrix in white. 
Capillary pressure curves for a more (P) and less (I) permeable media (d), 

(COSSÉ, 1993). 

 In higher permeability zones in a reservoir, the saturation with 
displacing fluid SW thus reaches a value SWP, whereas in less permeable 
zones, it only has the value SWI. Yet an equilibrium of the capillary 
pressures must be established between the two media present, at the 
contact of the two zones; this occurs only if the fluid saturation in zone I 
rises, while it decreases in zone P until it corresponds to identical 
pressures PCE, as displayed by the arrows in Figure 2.10(d). 
 “Thus the low permeability medium tends to be imbibed with 
wetting fluid 1 (water), at the expense of the high permeability medium, 
and tends to flush the non-wetting fluid 2 (oil) into the high permeability 
medium. This mechanism tends to increase the overall oil (fluid 2) 
recovery rate”. Compare (COSSÉ, 1993). In practice: 

- If the displacement is very rapid, the less permeable zones 
can produce oil only through permeable zones already swept 
by a wetting fluid, where the relative permeability to oil is 
very low; 

- If the displacement is slow, the less permeable zones will 
have the time to produce more oil as the displacement front 
moves forward. 

Thereby identifying such permeable zones (also called “sweet spots”) in 
unconventional reservoirs exploration is of extreme importance. One of 
the methods applied to obtain the porosity and pore size distributions of 
TGS rocks originated from three distinct reservoirs (Field A, B and C),

was the combination of N2GA and MICP techniques. From the obtained 
PSD curves we could evaluate the changes of porosity and main pore 
sizes within reservoir depth. 

2.4. Single-phase transport through porous media 

2.4.1. Permeability and reservoir engineering 

 Permeability is a measure of the ability of fluid to flow within the 
interconnected pore network of a porous medium. Reservoir flow rates, 
including oil production rates, are proportional to the permeability 
values of reservoir rock. On the other hand, rock permeability 
determines the pressure drop required to produce or inject fluid from an 
existing reservoir at a desired rate (JACKSON et al., 1993). 
 Permeability is a term used to express the conductivity of a 
porous medium with respect to permeation by a Newtonian fluid. The 
parameter that measures the contribution of the porous medium to the 
conductivity and is independent of both flow mechanisms and fluid 
properties is denominated “specific permeability”, k, onward in the 
present work called “permeability”. Its value depends uniquely by the 
pore structure of the analyzed material. Usually darcy is the most used 
unit of permeability (DULLIEN, 1992). In the petroleum engineering 
however de unit milidardy = 0.001 darcy is used with 1mD equal to 
0.987 x 10-15m2. In this work, the studied unconventional reservoir rocks 
such as tight gas sandstones and shale, leads to the measurements of 
permeability even low, into the microdarcy (?D) range. 
 Mathematical models of petroleum reservoirs have been utilized 
since the late 1800s. In the simulation of flow in the reservoir, the 
momentum equation is usually given in the form of Darcy’s law (Darcy, 
1856). Derived empirically, this law indicates a linear relationship 
between the fluid velocity relative to the solid and the pressure head 
gradient. Darcy’s empirical flow law was the first extension of the 
principles of classical fluid dynamics to the flow of fluids through 
porous media (DAKE, 1978). For the reservoirs petroleum engineering 
the significance of Darcy’s law is that it introduces flow rates into this 
area and, since the total surface oil production rate from a reservoir is: 

dt
dN

q pres =  (2.12) 

with Np being the cumulative oil production, it implicitly introduces a 
time scale in oil and gas recovery calculations.

2.4.2. Darcy’s law definition 

 In 1856, by flowing water through a pack of sand, the French 
engineer Henry Darcy established that, for any flow rate, the velocity of 
flow was directly proportional to the difference in manometric heights, 
the relationship being: 

1 2 ,
h h h

u K K
l l
? ?

= =  (2.13) 

where u is the flow velocity, which is the total measured flow rate (q), 
divided by the cross-sectional area of the sand pack; ?h is the difference 
in manometric leves, (water equivalent); l is the total length of the sand 
pack, and, K is a constant. Subsequently Darcy’s experimental law was 
repeated by others and proved to be independent of the direction of flow 
in the Earth’s gravitational field (DAKE, 1978).

Orientation of Darcy’s apparatus with respect to the Earth´s gravitational 

field (DAKE, 1978). 

As shown in Figure 2.11 the pressure at any point in the flow path, 
which has an elevation, z, relative to the datum plane with respect to the 
prevailing atmospheric pressure, can be expressed in absolute units as: 

( ),p g h z?= ?

In which the dependence of flow velocity on fluid density ? and

It is denominated the absolute permeability of analyzed material, 
completely saturated with a fluid and, because of the manner of 
derivation, will have the same value irrespective of the nature of the 
fluid (DAKE, 1978). 
 The specific or absolute permeability (k) of a rock is the ability of 
the rock to allow a fluid with which it is saturated to flow through its 
pores. In the petroleum engineering, the derivation of Darcy’s law as 
exposed in equation (2.18) is used to determine the flow through 
permeable media for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock with a fluid 
of constant viscosity. Such situation is illustrated by Figure 2.12, where 
a sample of length dl and cross-section A, saturated with a fluid of 
dynamic viscosity ?, and crossed horizontally by flow rate Q (measured 
in the condition of section dl) is considered. In steady-state conditions, 
the upstream pressure is P1, and the downstream pressure is P2 = (P1-
dP). The lateral sides are impervious to fluids. If the fluid does not react 
with the rock, which is the general case, permeability is expressed like 
an area:

 Darcy’s law applies only to the cases where the interstitial flow 
(i.e., the flow through pores of a porous medium) may be modeled as 
Stokes flow, ignoring the inertial term restricts the analysis to creeping 
(laminar) flow where viscous forces dominate in the flow regime. 
According to SCHEIDEGGER (1974), deviations of Darcy’s law (non-
linearity between flow velocity and gradient) are: (1) non-Newtonian 
behavior of the fluid itself; (2) particle migrations that cause blocking 
and unblocking of pores; (3) local consolidation and swelling of the soil; 
(4) molecular or ionic effects and (5) turbulent effects associated with 
high flow rates. 
2.4.3. Deviations from Darcy’s law in low-permeability rocks 

 In conventional gas reservoirs, Darcy flow is the dominant flow 
transport mechanism; however, in some tight sands and particularly in 
shale sediments, where pore-throat radii as small as a few nanometers 
are common, diffusion plays an important role and it must be taken into 
account (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). To describe how gas fluids 
are driven respectively by pressure gradient, concentration and surface 
tension, through a porous media, permeability, diffusion and adsorption 
are the main mechanisms used (HOU, 2012). Permeability is one of the 
most fundamental properties of any reservoir rock required for modeling 
hydrocarbon production (SAKHAEE-POUR and BRYANT, 2012).  

2.4.3.1. Knudsen number and flow regimes 

 Knudsen number, a dimensionless parameter, is commonly used 
to classify flow regimes in small pores where deviation from continuum 
flow is important (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). It is defined as 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
34              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

the ratio of molecular mean free path, ? (nm), and a characteristic 
length, such as pore radius, r (nm), and is given by: 

Kn
r
?

=  (2.19) 

 According to ZIARANI and AGUILERA (2012) an accurate 
description of gas flow through porous media must include both 
diffusion and viscous flow. The authors say that bulk diffusion, 
Knudsen’s diffusion, and surface diffusion are the various forms of 
diffusion flow. As illustrated in Figure 2.13, in large pores, with 
diameter much larger than mean free path of gas molecules (r &gt;&gt; ?), 
interaction between gas molecules is more frequent than collision of gas 
molecules with pore surface (walls). This is simply called bulk 
diffusion. Therefore, in large pores, viscous flow and bulk diffusion are 
the dominant transport mechanisms (situation a); as the pore diameter 
decreases or molecular mean free path increases (at lower pressures), the 
gas molecules tend to collide more with pore surface than other gas 
molecules. This means that a point is reached in which the gas 
molecules move almost independently from one another. This is called 
Knudsen’s diffusion (situation b). In pores with much smaller diameters 
(situation c) or stronger surface forces, molecules are adsorbed on the 
surface of the pore; as a result surface diffusion occurs. 

 
Figure 2.13: Schematic of a cross-section of a pore and gas molecules 
illustrating types of diffusion flow: (a) Bulk diffusion, (b) Knudsen’s 

diffusion, and (c) surface diffusion. In a real pore situation all three types of 
diffusion can co-exist (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012).

 With the advent of tight and shale gas reservoirs playing 
significant importance in today’s energy market, the slippage gas flow 
regime in fine-grained rocks have been discussed by various researches 
(JAVADPOUR, 2009; CIVAN, 2010; DARABI, et al., 2012; ZIARANI 
and AGUILERA, 2012). In this context gas flow that considers     
slippage phenomenon date started to be developed more than a century 
ago with the works of MAXWELL (1867), KNUDSEN (1909) and 
KLINKENBERG (1941). Table 2.1 summarizes the flow regime 
classification proposed and discussed nowadays, related to the 
respective Knudsen number and models to be applied. In the present 
work we investigate the gas flow in TGS rocks (also having pores in the 
nanometers order) using the Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP) technique 
and assuming Darcy permeability. Sensitivity analyses to describe the 
effect of pore size, pressure and temperature on gas flow, performed 
during the testes, are presented. Thereby the contribution of Knudsen 
diffusion and Klinkenberg slip flow on total flow are also discussed.

2.4.3.2. Klinkenberg corrections 

 The empirical Klinkenberg model (KLINKENBERG, 1941) 
accounts for gas slip flow in tight porous media. As previously 
discussed in this work, Darcy's law is based on the assumption that the 
flow is governed by the viscosity (condition of Poiseuille flow). In this 
flow only collisions between molecules occurs which are represented by 
the notion of viscosity. However, when the pore size present in the 
porous medium is so small compared to the mean free path of the fluid 
molecules, this is the case of low pressure gradient or very small pores. 
For this type of flow, called Knudsen flow, there are no collisions 
between molecules but only between solid walls and molecules 
(KNUDSEN, 1950) and so, there is still proportionality between flow 
rate and pressure drop, but the coefficient is not related to viscosity 
anymore. However, gas slippage in porous media and its effect on 
permeability was first addressed by (KLINKENBERG, 1941). In his 
pioneering study, Klinkenberg showed how the slip of gas molecules at 
the surface of rock can influence permeability and proposed an equation 
in which permeability is related to the inverse of pressure (ZIARANI 
and AGUILERA, 2012). In this matter a correction can be applied to 
Darcy's law to account for the deviation from the Poiseuille's law 
according to (KLINKENBERG, 1941):

where k? is the absolute permeability at a very high gas-phase pressure 
at which condition the Klinkenberg’s slippage effect can be negligible 
(WU, et al., 1998). ka is the apparent (measured) gas permeability, P is 
the average pore pressure and bk is the Klinkenberg’s slippage factor 
which depends on the gas and the properties of the analyzed material: 
gas molecular mean free path (?), material pore-throat radius (r), and 
gas pressure (P) as depicted on (KLINKENBERG, 1941):

 According to KLINKENBERG (1941), the apparent permeability 
of a porous medium to gas changes with gas pressure, becoming lower 
as the mean pressure increases. As the mean pressure becomes 
increasingly high, the apparent permeability approaches a value, (k?), 
which has been shown to be equal to the permeability of the porous 
medium to a nonreactive liquid. In an unsteady-state permeability 
determination, pressure in a core changes both with position (high at the 
inlet face to atmospheric pressure at the outlet face) and with time. Since 
apparent permeability is a function of pressure, it too must change with 
both position and time. The time required for any given pressure interval 
measured is roughly inversely proportional to the permeability of the 
analyzed core (JONES, 1972).  

2.4.3.3. Apparent permeability and correction factor definition 

 Figure 2.14 shows the Klinkenberg’s and Knudsen (CIVAN, 
2010) correction factors for distinct flow regimes. As one can see, 
compared to the Knudsen’s correction, Klinkenberg underestimates the 
correction factor particularly as it becomes larger than 1, besides no 
significant differences are observed. For slip flow regime, where 0.0001 
&lt;Kn &amp;lt;0.1, the correction factor is very small (DARABI et al., 2012). 
When the Knudsen number increases (in the direction of transition and 
free-molecule flows) the magnitude of the correction factor gets 
substantially large. However, such a high Knudsen’s flow is not 
commonly found at reservoir condition unless the formation is 
extremely tight as in the case of shale (JAVADPOUR, 2009; ZIARANI 



 

_____________________________________________________________

and AGUILERA, 2012). As both the correction factor and Knudsen 
number are dimensionless, the graphic in Figure 2.14 can be used to 
generalize the permeability correction between the apparent and 
absolute (here called Darcy) permeability.

Knudsen number for all transition flow regimes (modified from: ZIARANI 
and AGUILERA, 2012; DARABI, et al., 2012). 

2.4.3.4. Parameters of influence 

 Pore-throat radius, pressure and temperature are the main 
parameters playing a role in the magnitude of Knudsen’s correction 
factor. The contribution of Klinkenberg effects and Knudsen diffusion 
to total gas flow is larger at lower pressures (JAVADPOUR, 2009). 
Pressure and temperature affect the molecular mean free path and 
consequently Knudsen number and Klinkenberg’s correction factor. It 
happens because molecular mean free path, defined as an average 
distance traveled by molecules between collisions, is a function of 
pressure, temperature and collision diameter of the molecules which can 
be obtained from the following equation (CUSSLER, 1997):

diameter (m) equal to 0.44 for nitrogen and 0.42 for methane. In the 
present work, the permeability experiments (PDP) were performed using 
gas nitrogen, at temperature of 22 oC and mainly at mean pressure of gas 
equal 6.89 MPa. In these condition the value of ? is equal 2.15 nm. 

2.5. Review of utilized permeability models 
 Knowledge of pore space properties of sedimentary rocks is a 
prerequisite for the exploitation of hydrocarbon reservoirs (PAPE et al., 
2006). The rock permeability is one of most important properties 
concerning the reservoir since it allows calculation of the fluid flow. 
Predicting permeability becomes much more difficult in formations with 
small grain size and an abundance of clay minerals such as tight gas 
sandstones rocks - a sub-millidarcy reservoir. The empirical relations 
used in this work to estimate permeability from measured pore structure 
parameters on TGS of field A are briefly discussed as follows.  
2.5.1. Permeability correlation from capillary pressure curve 

 The existing correlations from Winland-Pittman (KOLODZIE, 
1980), Aguilera (AGUILERA, 2002) and Katz-Thompson (KATZ and 
THOMPSON, 1986) are permeability models based on the concept of 
capillary pressure where a characteristic throat size governs the flow at 
the percolation threshold of the porous medium. Thereby, each model 
uses a different method to estimate that characteristic throat size. 
Winland developed a power law model that relates permeability with 
porosity and pore throat radius (later published by KOLODZIE, 1980) 
using data from more than 10 formations: 

1.470 1.701
3517.6 ,k r?=  (2.23) 

where r35 is the pore radius corresponding to 35% mercury saturation.  
Aguilera (2002) also proposed a correlation for pore throat radius 
assuming 35% mercury saturation. To develop his correlation, Aguilera 
used over 2500 sandstone and carbonate samples from 28 formations: 

2.222
35 11.324 ,k r ?=  (2.24) 

with values of r35 given in ?m, k in mD, and ? is the fractional porosity. 
Starting from percolation concept, Katz and Thompson have related the 
permeability of a porous medium to a length scale lc:

where lc is the size of the smallest throat invaded by a non-wetting phase 
at the percolation threshold. lc can be estimated from the inflection point 
of the mercury injection curve. F is the formation factor of a 
homogeneus porous media related to the tortuosity (?) and already 
demostrated by WYLLIE and SPANGLER in 1952 as being:

In the equation above m is the Archie’s cementation factor which is a 
unique property of a given porous media. Ranges of 1.2 &amp;lt;m &amp;lt;3 have 
been presented by CLENNELL (1997). 
 In this study, we apply all correlations discussed above to 
estimate the permeability using the parameters r35, lc and ? measured by 
the combination of N2GA and MICP techniques. The tortuosity 
parameter obtained by X-ray CT technique allowed us to estimate the 
formation factor of analyzed samples and it is one important pore 
structural parameter in the Kozeny-Carman model, also used to predict 
permeability. Measured pore structure parameters obtained by the 
applied techniques in the present work were correlated to empirical 
models to estimate or simulate permeability. 
2.5.2. Models used for fine-grained rocks 

 The fluid transport in fine-grained porous rocks such as tight gas 
sandstones rocks can be described as Darcy flow/advection 
(HILDENBRAND et al., 2005; SCHLÖMER and KROOSS, 1997). 
However, as noted by Civan et al. (2010) for shale gas, by Javadpour 
(2009) for nanopores mudrocks, by Rushing et al. (2008) for tight 
sandstones and previously in this work, gas flow is often affected by 
several phenomena, e.g. possible transition from volume flow to 
molecular transport, which may cause deviations from Darcy’s law. 
Nevertheless, it remains the common base for several mathematical 
models to measure permeability in sandstones and most TGS. In 
general, these models are correlated to physical parameters such as 
density, porosity, grain and pore diameter or specific surface area 
(YANG and APLIN, 2007). In the sub-chapter reported here after, the 
Kozeny-Carman equation, Pape et al. (1999) pore fractal model and the 
Series-Parallel model were used to estimate permeability coefficients 
from the measured physical parameters of the TGS rocks samples using 
N2GA and MICP in combination and X-ray CT, as described below.

2.5.2.1. Kozeny-Carman model 

 One of the most widely used expressions, the Kozeny-Carman 
law that relate permeability to the structural characteristics of the 
medium have been derived analytically for capillary tube models 
(LATIEF and FAUZI, 2012). The Kozeny-Carman law expresses the 
permeability of the medium assumed to be equivalent to a conduit, the 
cross section of which has an extremely complicated shape but, on the 
average a constant area (Dullien, 1992) it is therefore a function of pore 
geometry. 
 The general form for the Kozeny-Carman (KC) model can be 
simplified as (DULLIEN, 1992):

where ? is the porosity of the sample, Fo is a shape factor, le is the 
average path length of flow and So is the specific surface area based on 
the volume of the solid. The parameter (le/l) is the tourtuosity and (le/l)

2 
is the hydraulic “tortuosity factor”. The intrinsic permeability is given in 
m2, the porosity has no unit and the specific surface area multiplied by 
grain density is given in m-1. 

2.5.2.2. Fractal permeability-porosity relationship (PAPE et al., 1999) 

 The permeability-porosity relationship presented by PAPE et al. 
(1999) was demonstrated using several data sets of permeability and 
porosity measured on samples from different types of sandstones and 
shale. In this work they observed that different diagenetic processes may 
superpose each other as mechanical compaction, mineral solution, and 
cementation changing permeability-porosity relationships. They also 
affirmed that as long as the fractal dimension of the pore space equals 
the standard value D=2.36, the diagenetic path is characterized by a 
power-law curve with an exponent of 10 in the porosity-permeability 
plot. However, conditions may be different in the low-permeability 
range. Usually the decrease of the effective pore radius and the increase 
of the tortuosity (?) is less pronounced for low permeabilities, i.e., at 
later stages of diagenesis. This is reflected by the smaller increase in 
permeability with porosity in the low-porosity range (for more details 
see PAPE et al., 1999). Therefore to characterize samples with low 
permeability they proposed the following equation:

where porosity (?) is given in fraction volume. 

2.5.2.3. Series-Parallel model 

 The Series-Parallel (S-P) equations emerged originally from the 
work of Childs and Collis-George (1950) and Reznik (1971). Later 
Fernandes et al. (2003) studying reservoirs rocks, applied this model 
considering the probability of pores being connected based on the 
amount of pores. Also, the pore size distribution was obtained by 2D 
image analysis. The authors concluded that the probability of pores 
being connected can be evaluated considering the amount of pores by 
calculating the quotient between the number of pores in a certain class 
and the total number of pores present in the medium. Therefore, 
generalizing for n classes of pore size, the intrinsic permeability 
obtained applying the S-P procedure (kSP) is defined as:

 The complete pore size distribution and porosity data obtained by

model, while BET specific surface area values were used in the K-C 
model.  
2.5.3. Estimating permeability from NMR measurements 

 The porosity and pore-size information from NMR measurements 
can be used to estimate both the permeability and the potentially 
producible porosity (that is, the movable fluids). The NMR estimate of 
producible porosity is called the free-fluid index (FFI). The estimate of 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
Mayka Schmitt                                                             43 

FFI is based on the assumption that the producible fluids reside in large 
pores, whereas the bound fluids reside in small pores. The spin–spin 
relaxation time obtained performing a NMR test is denominated (T2). T2 
is one of the pore structural parameters determined in this thesis and it 
will be explained in a later section. Because T2 values can be related to 
pore sizes a T2 value can be selected below which the corresponding 
fluids are expected to reside in small pores and above which the 
corresponding fluids are expected to reside in larger pores. Then this T2 
value is called the T2 cutoff (MARSHALL et al., 1995; COATES et al., 
1999). 
 Through the partitioning of the T2 distribution, T2 cutoff divides 
effective porosity of tight sandstones into FFI and bound-fluid porosity, 
or bulk volume irreducible (BVI). The T2 cutoff can be determined with 
NMR measurements on water-saturated core samples. Specifically, a 
comparison is made between the T2 distribution of a sample in a fully 
water-saturated state, and the same sample in a partially saturated state, 
the latter typically being attained by centrifuging the core at a specified 
air-brine capillary pressure. Although capillary pressure, lithology, and 
pore characteristics all affect T2 cutoff values, common practice establishes 
local field values. E.g. in the Gulf of Mexico T2 cutoff values of 33 and 92 
ms are generally appropriate for sandstones and carbonates (COATES, 
et al., 1999). In the TGS rocks analyzed in the present work only 
measurements of 100% saturated on mini plugs were performed, 
suggesting therefore the usage of theoretical values of 33 ms as T2 cutoff. 
However, Ashkar et al. (2010) studying sandstone ranging from tight 
gas to poorly lithified obtained T2cutoff values between 1.45 ms and 242 
ms where clay content played a key factor in reducing cutoff time.  
 NMR relaxation properties of rock samples are dependent on 
porosity, pore size, pore-fluid properties and mineralogy (COATES, et 
al., 1999). The NMR estimate of permeability is based on theoretical 
models that show that permeability increases with both increasing 
porosity and increasing pore size. Traditionally, two related kinds of 
permeability models have been developed: the free-fluid or Coates 
model (applicable in formations containing water and/or hydrocarbons); 
the Mean-T2 model or SDR (applicable to the pore systems containing 
only water) (MORRISS et al., 1997). The use of these particular size 
parameters in their respective expressions is based on empirical 
considerations. The Mean-T2 model, however, fails when the pore 
contains hydrocarbons because then T2gm (with gm refering to the 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
44              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

geometric mean of the T2 distribution) is not controlled exclusively by 
pore size. 

 
Figure 2.15: The Coates permeability model (top) uses the FFI/BVI ratio to 
describe changes in the surface-to-volume ratio. The Mean-T2 permeability 
model (bottom) uses an average T2 value to describe changes in surface-to-

volume ratio (COATES et al., 1999). 

 From the Coates model, permeability is estimated by: 
22

where porosity,?, is given in percentage, C is a constant which is a term 
that reflects the correlation between the rock's pore throat and pore size 
and in fact it is a function of pore geometry dependent on the processes 
that created the formation. In sandstones C is usually around 10. FFI is 
the free fluid index, and BVI is the bound volume of irreducible water. 
Core porosity and permeability should be used to estimate C for the 
Coates model. In this work we found a mean C value for the well A 
formation based on the obtained T2cutoff values. 
 The Mean-T2 model, also called SDR (Schlumberger Doll 
Research) is a similar expression to 2 41k T ?=  which has been used to 
estimate matrix permeability in sandstones (LATORRACA et al., 1993) 
and given by (MORRISS et al., 1997):

Applying this equation with porosity as a decimal fraction and T2gm in 
ms gives permeability estimates in mD. T2gm is the geometric mean of 
the T2 distribution and b is a coefficient that depends on the formation 
type and can be determined through calibration with core porosity and 
permeability. Rezaee et al. (2012) used b equal to 4 for sandstones; 
Morriss et al. (1997) found b equal 4.6 as a good agreement for 110 
sandstones from three reservoirs.  
 All the models described above were used to predict permeability 
of tight gas sandstones originatted from the field named A in this work. 
For all five TGS samples analyzed, the values of permeability measured 
by PDP technique were used to compare and validate the empirical and 
simulated results. In the next chapter the set of methods and techniques 
applied in the present study is summarized.

3. ANALYTICAL METHODS: THEORETICAL ASPECTS   

3.1. Pulse-decay permeability 
 Difficulties in measuring permeability in reservoirs rocks below 1 
(mD) is mainly due to very low flow rate, difficult to establish in such 
rocks. Experiments require therefore an adaptation of the experimental 
devices initially used for more permeable rocks. In recent years, both 
pulse-decay technique and steady-state technique have been used to 
make gas permeability measurements in tight rocks. One of the purposes 
of this study is to apply the pulse-decay technique as proposed by 
JONES (1997) to obtain the experimental permeability values of low 
(and ultra-low) permeability tight gas sandstones from distinct wells. 
For obtained values up to 0.001 mD we also compare the transient 
method from PDP with the traditional steady-state method. Another 
objective of this work was to determine the correlations of Klinkenberg 
correction in a sense of build up a database through tight gas sandstones. 
Additionally, the measured Klinkenberg permeability on TGS was used 
to validate empirical permeability obtained by the correlation of 
measured pore-structure parameters. Accurate determination of 
petrophysical properties (such the ones used in the empirical 
permeability models) of geological formations are necessary, among 
them precise permeability values. 
 Transient (or pulse-decay) permeability techniques have been 
discussed and unsteady-state permeameters have been built and reported 
in the literature (JONES, 1972). This differential technique permits 
accurate measurements of permeability in the micro-Darcy range in a 
reasonable length of time. According to Jones (1997) laboratory pulse-
decay measurements using a gas or liquid are effective for determining 
the permeability of rocks in the range from 0.1 mD to 0.01 µD. With the 
currently advent in the petroleum industry in characterizing the 
properties of unconventional reservoirs, the usage of pulse-decay 
technique has made feasible to measure the permeability of very tight 
rocks and shale. The scheme of a conventional pulse-decay apparatus, 
shown in Figure 3.1, consists of an upstream reservoir for gas or liquid 
of Vu, sample holder capable of applying high confining pressures, 
which contains a cylindrical rock sample (plug) of pore volume Vp, and 
a downstream reservoir of volume Vd. A differential pressure transducer 
measures the pressure difference between the reservoirs Vu and Vd 
through the analyzed sample, and a second transducer measures the 
absolute pressure, Pm, in the downstream reservoir.

Figure 3.1: Scheme of a pulse-decay apparatus showing upstream and 

downstream: reservoirs volumes (Vu, Vd), instantaneous pressures (Pu, Pd). 
The core holder contains a pore volume (Vp) sample under confining 

pressure (pc). During the test, the pressure difference across the sample 
(?P=Pu-Pd) is measured (JONES, 1997; DARABI et al., 2012). 

 In this scheme the pressure in the upstream reservoir is increased 
by ?Pu, which is 1 to 3% higher them Pd, and is allowed to stabilize 
while achieving thermal equilibrium. When Valve 2 is open “pressure 
pulse” is created to flow through the sample. The initial pressure 
difference across the sample, ?P[0], is slightly less than ?Pu because of 
the “dead volume” in the flow line between Valve 2 and the face of the 
sample. 
 Data are analyzed from the solution of the diffusivity equation, 
which is derived by combining the differential form of Darcy’s law with 
the continuity equation (JONES, 1997). The sample is pressured to be 
initially at a uniform pore pressure, Pd[0], throughout. The time 
required for this step when analyzing tight gas sandstones is about 2 
hours. At a time t=0, a pulse of slightly higher pressure, ?P[0], is 
applied to its upstream reservoir. As gas flows from Vu into the sample, 
the pressure in Vu declines, while the pressure in Vd remains constant 
for a short period of time until the pressure pulse has transversed the 
length of the sample. Then the pressure in Vd rises. Because Pu[t] 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
48              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

declines and Pd[t] rises, ?P[t] continues to diminish and gradually 
approaches zero. The rate of pressure decay depends on permeability. 
The lower the permeability is the slower the decay. Figure 3.2 
exemplifies the decay for rocks belonging to a same field as well as 
shale. Observe the time differences between TGS and shale, also 
fractured shale “A”.

 The general solution for the pressure difference as a function of 
time was presented by DICKER and SMITS (1988) and described as 
follows (JONES, 1997). 
 Having adequate bounding conditions it is possible to show that 
dimensionless pressure difference, ?PD, between Vu and Vd decays 
exponentially with elapse time, tD as:

 Therefore, under typical pulse-decay (i.e. high Pm and small 
pressure difference across the core sample) the analytical solution may 
be used to estimate apparent permeability for extremely low-
permeability samples. However, when the pressure difference across the 
core is large or the initial core pressure is low, the test in low-
permeability samples will take some time and the analytical solution 
may lead to a significant error in pressure-decay prediction (DARABI et 
al., 2012). It happens because of the deviations on the assumptions that

pressure solutions at late transient times.

used. The calibration of internal parts of the equipment such as the tank 
volumes and the transducers have been realized by the equipment 
supplier and, the volume of external upper and lower nitrogen lines were 
measured and added to the equations of the PDP equipment. One of the 
most critical difficulties while performing a PDP experiment is 
maintenance of constant temperature as the equations developed using 
this technique assume isothermal nitrogen expansion (JONES, 1972). 
To ensure a constant temperature we isolated the experimental setup in a 
plastic casing as shown in Figure 3.3(b). 

3.2. Nitrogen gas adsorption 

3.2.1. Principles and properties 

 Physical gas adsorption is a technique that accurately determines 
the amount of gas adsorbed on a solid material, which is a direct 
measure of the porous properties and structure. The isotherm obtained 
from N2 adsorption, when applied over a wide range of relative 
pressures (P/Po), can provide information on the surface area, pore 
volume and PSD from 0.5 to 200 nm (GROEN et al., 2003). The 
classical pore size model developed by Barret et al. (1951), BJH after  
Barret, Joyner and Halenda, which is based on the Kelvin equation and 
corrected for multilayer adsorption, is most widely used for calculations 
of the PSD over the mesopore range. On the other hand, the BET 
(Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) method of Brunauer et al. (1938) is the 
most widely used to assess the specific surface areas of porous materials 
from adsorption data. 
 Low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements are largely 
used for characterization of porous solids where adsorbed amounts and 
capillary condensation/evaporation pressures are related to the 
geometrical properties of the porous matrix (GREGG and SING, 1982). 
For instance, the specific surface area of porous materials is usually 
assessed from the adsorption experiments prior to the capillary 
condensation of the fluid on a region which the fluid is assumed to cover 
uniformly the pore walls. The thickness of the film adsorbed on the pore 
surface (t) is also an essential parameter to describe the phenomenon of 
capillary condensation (COASNE et al., 2004).  
 In Figure 3.4 snapshots of gas atoms adsorbed in the pore walls 
(considering a medium with pore bodied and throats) at different 
pressures are shown. As one can see at low pressures, the pore surface is 
covered by a quasi-homogeneous layer of gas atoms (a). As the relative 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
52              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

pressure is increased the filling of the pore with constriction (pore 
throats) starts with followed condensation of gas atoms in the part of the 
constricted pore. As expected, this condensation pressure is smaller than 
that obtained for the pore bodies (cavities). The condensation in the 
constricted part leads to the presence of hemispherical menisci in the 
interfacial region between the largest cavity and the constriction. These 
curved interfaces together with the film adsorbed on the wall of the pore 
body define a gas bubble inside the pore (see Figure 3.4 (b) and (c)). 
Finally, all remained open pore cavity on the sample get completely 
filled once that the condensation of gas bubble occurs at a pressure 
P/Po~ 1.

from the beginning of the N2GA experiment (a) P/Po ~ 0.01 to the end of it 

(d) P/Po ~1 (modified from COASNE et al., 2004). 

3.2.2. Isotherms acquisition and classification 

 When a specific gas is put in contact with a solid surface, 
molecules of this gas will be adsorbed to the surface in amounts that are 
a function of their partial pressure in the bulk pressure. An adsorption 
isotherm is simply the measurement of the quantity of a gas adsorbed 
over a range of relative pressures at a single temperature (77 K for the 
nitrogen gas adsorption). Depending on the type of the adsorbent (solid) 
or the adsorbate (gas) and on the intermolecular interactions between the 
gas and the surface, different shapes can be displayed by the isotherms. 
The first systematic attempt to interpret the adsorption isotherms shapes 
into a classification was introduced by Braunauer, Deming, Deming and

Teller (BDDT) in 1940 (BRUNAUER et al., 1940) who described five 
types. Much later SING et al. (1985) introduced an additional isotherm, 
which completes the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 
(IUPAC) classification as illustrated in Figure 3.5. 

 
Figure 3.5: IUPAC classification for gas adsorption isotherms (above) and 

types of hysteresis loops (below) (SING et al., 1985). 

Type I isotherms characterize microporous adsorbents. Types II and III 
describe adsorption on macroporous adsorbents with strong and weak 
adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, respectively. Types IV and V represent 
adsorption isotherms with hysteresis. Finally, Type VI has distinct 
adsorption steps (step-like) characteristics of multi-surface on non-
porous adsorbents. The hysteresis loop (Type IV and V isotherms) is the 
change where a lower branch of which represents measurements 
obtained by progressive addition of gas to the system, and the upper 
branch by progressive withdrawal; hysteresis effects are liable to appear 
in isotherms of other types too (GREGG and SING, 1982).  
 Figure 3.5 (bellow) illustrates the types of hysteresis loops 
according to SING et al. (1985). Hysteresis appearing in the multilayer

range of physisorption isotherms is usually associated with capillary 
condensation in mesopore structures. Two extreme types are shown as 
H1 and H4. In the former the two branches are almost vertical and 
nearly parallel over an appreciable range of gas uptake, whereas in the 
latter they remain nearly horizontal and parallel over a wide range of 
P/Po. A feature common to many hysteresis loops is that the steep 
region of the desorption branch leading to the lower closure point occurs 
(for a given adsorptive at a given temperature) at a relative pressure 
which is almost independent of the nature of the porous adsorbent but 
depends mainly on the nature of the adsorptive (e.g. for nitrogen at its 
boiling point at P/Po~ 0.42 (SING et al, 1985; GROEN et al., 2003). 
 Type H1 is often associated with porous materials compacts of 
approximately uniform spheres in fairly regular array, and hence to have 
narrow distributions of pore size. For Type H2 loops the pore systems of 
size and shape is not well-defined yet., indeed, in the past it was 
attributed to a difference in mechanism between condensation and 
evaporation processes occurring in pores with narrow necks and wide 
bodies (ink-bottle pores). The Type H3 (which does not exhibit any 
limiting adsorption at high P/Po) is observed with aggregates of plate-
like particles giving rise to slit-shaped pores. Similarly, the Type H4 
loop is often associated with narrow slit-like pores, but in this case the 
Type I isotherm character is indicative of microporosity (SING et al., 
1985). Besides giving an indicative of the complexity of pore 
morphologies, the isotherms in the present work were also used to 
obtain pore size distribution (micro- and mesopore regions) and the 
specific surface area for the analyzed TGS. 
3.2.3. Adsorption theory for PSD calculation 

 Nowadays the types of models available for the pore size 
calculation using gas adsorption measurements are the density 
functional theory (DFT) or classical theory. Classical models are based 
on the Kelvin equation and thickness for determining the pore size 
distribution. Although the pore size distributions were calculated in the 
present work by usage of the BJH and Dollimore-Heal (DH) 
(DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1964; DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1970) 
methods based on the adsorption isotherms data and DFT method (DO 
and DO, 2003), only the traditional BJH method was applied for the 
combination of N2GA and MICP. Therefore, a brief revision to this 
model is exposed.

  The Barret, Joyner and Hallenda (BJH) theory (BARRET et al., 
1951) was applied to find the size distribution of the micro- and 
mesopores. The BJH analysis describes the capillary condensation 
phenomenon in a cylindrical pore as described by Figure 3.6.  

 
Figure 3.6: (a) Pore filled by gas at P/Po ~1; (b) increasing on the adsorbed 

gas layer as P/Po increases (FERNANDES, 1990). 

It is assumed that the condensation of a fluid in a pore of radius ro takes 
place in the ‘core’ region, i.e., the inner part of the pore that has a radius 
ro - t(P/Po), where t(P/Po) is the thickness of the film adsorbed on the 
pore wall as a function of the relative pressure (P/Po) of the gas. Using 
this model, it is predicted that the condensation of nitrogen in a pore of 
radius ro occurs at a pressure given by the following modified Kelvin 
equation:

where P is the system pressure, Po is the saturation vapor pressure of  
nitrogen, ?N and V1 are the surface tension and molar volume, 
respectively, of liquid nitrogen, R is the gas constant, T is the 
temperature at which the isotherm is measured (77 K) and ? is a factor 
that accounts for the shape of the gas/liquid interface. The latter is 
assumed to be cylindrical during the adsorption process (? = 1) and 
hemispherical during the desorption process (? = 2) (COASNE et al., 
2004). In this study, t (in both models BJH and DH) was determined 
using the empirical Halsey equation for nitrogen (HALSEY, 1948):

3.2.4. Adsorption theory for surface area measurements 

 In the present thesis two methods were applied to measure 
specific surface area of analyzed tight gas sandstones: Langmuir and 
BET theories. The Langmuir equation describes better microporous 
material exhibiting Type I isotherms; it assumes adsorption limited to 
monolayer. On the other hand BET method allows the estimation of 
specific surface areas from adsorption isotherms on the basis of the 
multilayer adsorption model (compare Figure 3.7).  

 
Figure 3.7: Gas-surface interactions in the adsorption process in Langmuir 

and BET theories modified from FERNANDES (1990). 

The hypothesis of the BET model is that (i) adsorption occurs on 
energetically homogeneous sites having energy ?1 (also, the surface 
density of the sites is constant) and (ii) molecules can adsorb onto each 
other. In this case, the adsorption energy ?o for all molecules adsorbed 
above the first layer is constant and equal to the cohesion energy in the 
bulk liquid. With these assumptions, it can be shown that adsorption 
data (the adsorbed amount N versus the relative pressure P/Po) must 
obey the following equation:

where No is the monolayer capacity, i.e., the number of atoms needed to 
uniformly cover the substrate with one complete monolayer. The factor 
C is related to the energy of the system, ( )1exp oC KT? ?= ?? ?? ? , 
where K is the Boltzmann constant. The parameters C and No are 
estimated from the slope and the intercept of the BET plot given by 
equation above. The monolayer capacity is converted into a surface area

Finally the specific surface area (So) is then determined by total surface

3.3. Mercury intrusion capillary pressure 
 The mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) method has 
been a viable tool for characterizing reservoir rocks for over 60 years 
(COMISKY et al., 2011) and is based on the fact that mercury behaves 
as a non-wetting liquid when in contact with most solids. Consequently, 
it does not penetrate into the openings and cracks of these substances 
without the application of pressure. Figure 3.8 illustrates the cumulative 
pore structure acquired by Hg intrusion and respective stages of Hg 
invasion of the sample in the penetrometer. The pressure (Pw) required is 
a function of the contact angle (?Hg) of mercury with the porous material 
to be intruded, its gas/liquid surface tension (?Hg) and equivalent pore 
radius (rp). This relationship is given by the Young-Laplace law for the 
particular case of cylindrical pores as the Washburn equation (KATE 
and GOKHALE, 2006): 

2 cos
.Hg Hgp

r
P

? ?
= ?  (3.11) 

This equation dictates that with increasing pressure, the mercury will 
intrude into progressively narrower pores for constant values of ?Hg and 
?Hg. The volume of mercury invading the pores is measured directly as a 
function of applied pressure where the P-V data provides a unique 
characterization of the pore structure (ROOTARE and PRENZLOW, 
1967). The elevated pressures reached by the MICP equipments 
nowadays make the evaluation of very small pores possible, although 
the integrity of the pore structure of analyzed medium is sometimes 
doubted and discussed in the literature. Nevertheless, the maximum 
pressure used in the present work was Pw = 413 MPa (rp ? 20 Å).

Figure 3.8: Hg volume versus pressure plot indicating structural strength 

(above) and respective states of Hg intrusion (in black) inside of pore 
sample in a penetrometer (below) (WEBB, 1993). 

 During the MICP experiments some issues can be encountered 
which create errors in the results. The two most likely sources of errors 
in MICP measurements are caused by mercury conformance at low 
pressures (COMISKY et al., 2011) and system compressibility at high 
pressures (WEBB, 2001). Besides that another limitation on the results 
is related to the pore system geometry of natural materials such as 
reservoir rocks, being comprised by the so-called ink-bottle 
configuration.  Therefore the pore system may be described as a system 
of large chambers (ink-bottle type pores) interconnected by smaller 
throats. In such a system pore network effects hence are assumed to be 
the most important reason for the large hysteresis between intrusion and 
extrusion in MICP experiments (KAUFMANN et al., 2009); also a 
super estimation of the smaller pores (throat) in detriment of the bigger 
ones (FERNANDES, 1994) might be observed shifting the pore size 
distribution in the direction of the smaller pores. In Figure 3.9 a 
simplified model of pore system with ink-bottle type pores is assumed,

allowing the visualization of pore filling aspects. As one can see, in (a) 
the pores connected to the surface are still empty; filling starts with the 
largest external surface connected pores as mercury is non-wetting and 
only with increasing pressure smaller pores are filled (a?b?c). Dark 
gray represents the pores already filled in a pressure step backward and 
light gray are the pores filled in a ahead pressure step. Ink-bottle type 
pores will not be filled at the pressure corresponding to their radius but 
at a higher pressure level which corresponds to the largest connecting 
radius. Relatively large voids or even small pores which are connected 
just through even smaller pores to the external surface may be filled at 
higher pressure as it would correspond to their actual size.

3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
 As known TGS and seal rocks are comprised by considerable 
amount of very fine grained structures that X-ray methods, rather than 
hand specimen or optical methods, are used to identify them. X-Ray 
diffraction is considered to be one of the best methods in defining clay 
minerals (ELGMATI, 2011). 
 In 1912 the German physicist Max Von Laue discovered the 
diffraction of X-rays on crystals as he related the passage of waves of 
light through a periodic, crystalline arrangement of particles. The 
principle of X-ray diffraction measurements originated afterwards from 
Bragg´s law formulated by Willian Henry Bragg and Willian Lawrence 
Bragg. Bragg´s law (1912) explains the relationship between an incident 
and its detected beams with respect to the examined sample as 
(BUHRKE et al., 1998): 

2 sin ,hkln d? ?=  (3.12) 
where n is an integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3…), ? is the wavelength of the incident 
X-ray beam, dhkl is the distance between atomic layers in a crystal with 
the Müller index (hkl) and ? is the angle between the incident ray and 



 

_____________________________________________________________

the scattering planes. When X-ray radiation passes through matter, the 
radiation interacts with the electrons in the atoms, resulting in scattering 
of the radiation constructive and destructive interference will occur 
(FORMOSO, 1984). If the atoms are organized in planes (i.e., the matter 
is crystalline) and the distances between the atoms are of the same 
magnitude as the wavelength of the X-rays undergo constructive 
interference in accordance to Bragg's law. This result where X-rays are 
emitted at characteristic angles based on the spaces between the atoms 
organized in crystalline structures called plane is shown in Figure 3.10. 

  
Figure 3.10: X-ray incident and scattered beam base on Bragg´s law 

(ELGMATI, 2011). 

 We used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to semi-quantify clay and non-
clay minerals in the TGS from field A and in the three studied seal 
rocks. 

3.5. Field emission scanning electron microscopy 
 Characterizing TGS formations remains daunting, because its 
microstructure presents unique challenges in measurement and 
description since the resources are typically located in heterogeneous 
and complex geologic systems (BUCTHER and LEMMENS, 2011). In 
TGS formations usually the hydrocarbons are trapped in rocks marked 
by poorly connected networks of pores with dimensions as small as a 
few nanometers; clays are commonly associated with this small grain 
size being highly variable and often associated to other minerals such as 
quartz, feldspar and calcite. In this context, the geometry and nature of 
the mineralogical components are easier to be described optically.

 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) permits the 
observations and characterization of heterogeneous organic and 
inorganic materials on a nanometer (nm) to micrometer (?m) scale 
(GOLDSTEIN et al. 2003). Table 3.1 compares the limitations of 
different optical modes for analyzing clay mineral fabrics and 
compositions. High-resolution field emission scanning electron 
microscopy (FESEM) is achieved through use of a field emission gun 
(FEG) in place of the more conventional tungsten hairpin or LaB6 
filaments (HUGGETT and SHAW, 1997) where a resolution of 0.5 nm 
can be accomplished. For backscattered scanning electron microscopy 
(BSEM) the optimal resolution is 0.5 ?m and 2.5 nm for conventional 
secondary electron microscopy (CSEM). In the SEM techniques, the 
microvolume to be analyzed is irradiated with a finely focused electron 
beam, which may be swept in a raster across the surface of the specimen 
to form images or may be static to obtain an analysis at one position. 
The types of signals produced from the interaction of the electron beam 
with the sample include secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, 
characteristic X-rays, and other protons of various energies. These 
signals are obtained from specific emission volumes within the sample 
and can be used to examine many characteristics of the sample (surface 
topology, crystallography, composition, etc) (GOLDSTEIN et al., 
2003). Figure 3.11 shows a schematic illustration of the interaction 
volume of incident electron beam within the analyzed material. It is 



 

_____________________________________________________________

possible to see the origin of distinct sources of generated electrons in the 
sample.  

 
Figure 3.11: Schematic representation of processes resulting from electron 
bombardment showing the emissions coming from different depths, e.g. CL 

and X-rays are emitted from deeper section levels than the secondary 
electrons (SALH, 2011). 

 The number of backscattered electrons (BSE) produced from a 
given atom is proportional to the atomic number, thereby materials 
composed of heavy atoms will backscatter more electrons, resulting in 
brighter gray tones in the image relative to less dense materials. Hence, 
BSE produce an image that is related to material composition, providing 
both spatial and chemical information. With the use of backscattered 
scanning electron microscopy, e.g., it is possible to identify individual 
mineral constituents of the TGS and seal rocks by virtue of their atomic 
number (Z) contrast and differential hardness (relief). Valuable 
information can be obtained relating to particle form, orientation, 
texture, internal structure and mineralogical composition of the analyzed 
rock. On the other hand secondary electron images are acquired for 
documenting topographic variation within the rock. 
 In the present thesis we analyzed polished and fractured samples 
by SEM and FESEM techniques. Mechanically polishing TGS were 
selected to investigate mainly the microstructure (including pore 
morphology and porosity), composition, and mineral phases; while

showing topographic variations. For this task, samples were examined 
using two equipments: a Philips (FEI) XL40 and a Zeiss Ultra Plus for 
respectively SEM and FESEM analysis. Both systems are located at the 
Australian Resources Research Centre: Perth, Western Australia. Use of 
FESEM equipped with in-lens secondary electron (SE) detectors 
provided greatly increased detail of nanometer-scale in analyzed TGS 
and seal rocks. Lower accelerating voltages (1–10 kV) were used to 
prevent beam damage of the sample which was also coated with carbon. 
Working distances were 3 to 10 mm. 

3.6. X-ray computed tomography (CT) 
 The development of modern imaging methods relies on the 
acquisition of three-dimensional reconstructions from a series of two-
dimensional projections taken at different angles: the sample is rotated 
and the absorption of X-rays in different directions is recorded and used 
to produce a three-dimensional representation of the rock and fluids 
(BLUNT et al., 2013). X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an 
established and rapidly evolving technology of proven value for 
geological investigations. Because of its origin outside of the earth 
sciences, the potential for application of CT imagery to geological 
problems is only beginning to be explored (KETCHMAN and 
CARLSON, 2001). Typical X-ray energies are in the range 30–160 keV 
for microCT machines (with corresponding wavelengths 0.04-0.01 nm). 
Resolution is determined by the sample size, beam quality and the 
detector specifications; for cone-beam set-ups (in laboratory-based 
instruments) resolution is also controlled by the proximity of the sample 
to the beam, while detecting absorption at a sufficiently fine resolution. 
Current microCT and nanoCT scanners will produce images of around 
10003-20003 voxels. To generate a representative image, the cores are 
normally a few mm across, constraining resolution to a few microns; 
sub-micron resolution is possible using specially designed instruments 
and smaller samples (BLUNT et al., 2013). 
3.6.1. Principles of image acquisition 

 Any image, seen in the microscope or taken by any type of 
camera or other device, has to be transferred into computer memory. 
This process is called image acquisition and can be performed in several 
ways (WOJNAR, 1998). There are numerous methods for digital image 
acquisition intending the characterization of materials where

Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS) and Charge 
Coupled Device (CCD) are the most commonly used devices. 
 Computed Tomography (CT) technology involves taking a 
number of X-ray radiographs (projection images) at distinct angles by 
projecting an X-ray beam through a sample to be analyzed (object) 
(KUMAR et al., 2011). When photons interact with solids and complex 
biological materials they are absorbed, scattered (elastic or inelastic), 
diffracted, refracted, or transmitted through the material. During 
absorption of photons, emission of electrons, visible light, and X-rays 
also takes place. At its most basic level, absorption of X-rays occur 
when an incoming X-ray photon is absorbed, and this results in the 
ejection of electrons from the inner shell of the atom, and the atom is 
ionized. The ionized atom will eventually return to its neutral state 
(filling the vacated spot in the inner shell) often with the emission of an 
X-ray characteristic of the atom (WILDENSCHILD and SHEPPARD, 
2013). As the X-rays beams traverse through the object being scanned 
its energy is attenuated and the projection images are formatted on a 
detector. The attenuation of X-ray beam energy depends primarily on 
the density and thickness of the object in the beams path. The basic 
equation for attenuation of a mono-chromatic beam, i.e. one in which all 
photons have the same energy and wavelength, through a solid object is 
described by the Lambert-Beer's Law (KAK and SLANEY, 1999): 

exp[ ],oI I x?= ?  (3.13) 
where I is the X-ray beam intensity after passing through an object, I0 is 
the initial X-ray intensity, µ is the linear attenuation coefficient for the 
material being scanned (units: 1/length), and x is the length of the X-ray 
path through the material, i.e. the thickness of the object in the direction 
of the X-ray beam. From Eq. (3.13) we see that I is a decreasing 
function of distance, x, (the exponential argument is negative), 
indicating that the incident X-rays, I0, are attenuated as they pass 
through the object. Materials with a high attenuation coefficient will 
therefore allow X-rays to penetrate only a relatively short distance, 
whereas materials with a low attenuation coefficient are more easily 
penetrated (KETCHAM and CARLSON, 2001; WILDENSCHILD and 
SHEPPARD, 2013). 
3.6.2. The basics of X-ray micro- and nanotomography 

 If both Io and I(x) can be measured from Eq. (3.13), it is possible 
to calculate the average linear attenuation coefficient of a material

having n phases (a composite material such as rocks). To accurately 
identify and classify objects of different composition and density, 
sufficient variation in attenuation coefficients are needed. The gray level 
value of each pixel in each projection image is a representation of the 
net intensity I of the X-ray beam emerging out of the object in the 
direction along a line connecting the X-ray source to the image pixel. In 
other words, it represents the sum of attenuation coefficients of a 
number of tiny volume elements of the object lying along that direction 
of the beam. As shown in Figure 3.12, during acquisition of an X-ray 
micro- or nanoCT scan the sample is mounted on a high-resolution 
rotary stage and illuminated with X-rays.  

 
Figure 3.12: Scheme of a X-ray CT station. 

Projections (radiographs) are typically collected at fixed and angular 
increments while the sample is either rotated continuously or step 
scanned. The total rotational angle depends upon the geometry of the 
sample and the beam, but typically is either 180° when a nearly parallel 
beam is used (typically at a synchrotron) or 360° for a cone-beam 
geometry (typically in a laboratory apparatus) (BAKER et al., 2012). 
After passing through the sample the X-rays are then imaged with a 2D 
detector. The X-rays are normally converted into visible light by a 
scintillator screen. The visible light image is magnified with a lens and 
then detected by either a cooled CCD (charge-coupled device) camera or

a CMOS-based detector. Each of these 2D radiographic projection, 
carrying the information of X-ray attenuation through different volume 
elements (voxels) are collected at different angles of the object and then 
combined together to reconstruct (back-calculate) the 3D volume of the 
analyzed specimen (KUMAR et al., 2011). The most used algorithm for 
reconstructing the 3D volume from a cone-beam microCT is based in 
Feldkamp, DAVIS and KRESS (1984) work.

 In 2001 Ketcham and Carlson point out the divergence in the 
calculation from Lambert-Beer law for industrials CT, as the precise 
form of the X-ray spectrum and its variation at off-center angles in a 
fan- or cone-beam, is usually only estimated theoretically rather than 
measured. However, the scintillation and detection devices used

nowadays are very similar for the three types of systems (synchrotron, 
fan-beam and cone-beam) with any differences being due to the need to 
keep electronic components out of the beam-line at synchrotrons. 
Besides, the fact that geometric magnification from cone shaped beam 
(as the one used in the present work) allows efficient large area detectors 
to be used in lab-scale systems (WILDENSCHILD and SHEPPARD, 
2013). The setup comparing synchrotron, fan-beam and cone-beam 
tomography imaging configuration according WILDENSCHILD and 
SHEPPARD (2013) is illustrated in Figure 3.13.   
3.6.3. Evolution of microCT in material science  

 In the last few years micro computed tomography (microCT) a 
non-destructive imaging procedure has become an important technique 
for research of material properties (TORQUATO, 2000; YOUSSEF et 
al., 2005; LIU and REGENAUER-LIEB, 2011). CT imaging was 
introduced in 1970s and was principally used for clinical and bio-
medical purposes (BERA et al., 2011). MicroCT, i.e., tomography 
imaging with a resolution in the order of µm came into existence in the 
early 1980s and was quickly extended to other fields like geology, 
electronics and composite materials (RITMAN, 2004; BERA et al., 
2011). Recent technology developments allow the 3D characterization 
of samples, up to few millimeters in diameter, at a detail resolution 
down to nanometer scale. This technology is what we call in the present 
work as nanoCT.  
 Despite being rather slow and expensive, the methodology has 
proved its worth, particularly in very important applications such as 
understanding the pore structure and transport properties of reservoir 
rocks for oil, gas and CO2 geo-sequestration (YANG et al., 2013). For 
reservoir engineering related applications, in this work we exposed tight 
gas sandstones (TGS) samples to X-ray microCT and nanoCT to 
determine information about its pore network morphology, down to the 
sub-microns order. One of the key steps for realistic pore space 
determination with the help of microCT and nanoCT techniques is the 
preparation of the samples for a given image resolution. For micron 
and/or nano scale resolution, one needs a very small sample size in the 
order of a few to sub-millimeters as shown in Figure 3.14 where a 
relation between sample size and image resolution is plotted for 
different 3D imaging techniques. As the resolution is very high, the field 
of view decreases proportionally (BERA et al., 2011) so the sample 
diameter is selected as the maximum size which permits sufficient X-ray

transmission for imaging (YANG et al., 2013). In the present study all 
analyzed samples were manufactured as mini core samples to minimize 
losses. The diameters of mini cores were respectively 7 mm, 2 mm and 
0.1 mm for resolutions of 0.7, 0.3 and 0.064 ?m.

by different 3D image techniques (courtesy from Carl Zeiss X-ray 
Microscopy, Inc). 

3.6.4. Post-processing and 3D images analysis 

 Beyond visualization of the reconstructed sample volume via 3D 
rendering procedures, the main purpose of image processing is the 
quantitative characterization of data volumes (BAKER et al., 2012). A 
number of parameters related to the microstructure can be extracted 
from an X-ray CT data set when the coherence of the X-ray beam and 
the spatial resolution are adequate to resolve the features of interest in 
the analyzed material. In geosciences, the geometry and organization of 
rock components, such as pores or fractures, and zones with chemical 
alteration or with different compositions, are the main interest by 
performing X-ray micro- and nanoCT analysis. In our particular case of 
low-permeability TGS, micro- and nanoCT were used to image and 
quantify the textural and morphological characteristics of the rock 
constituents, such as porosity, pore size distribution, geometry and 
orientation of pores and specific surface. The tortuosity which describes 
the topology of the overall pore and pore-throat networks (BAKER et 
al., 2012) was also measured.

 Prior to the quantification and morphological analysis of the 3D 
reconstructed images is the selection of a region of interest (ROI) of the 
sample. The ROI should be large enough to be representative of the 
sample complexity and heterogeneity (i.e., a representative elementary 
volume), but small enough to not overwhelm the available computing 
resources (BAKER et al., 2012). After extracting a ROI, processing step 
involving the application of one or more grayscale-to-grayscale filters 
can also be performed. These filters are applied to reduce noise and 
eliminate artifacts, enhance object edges, and increase the visibility of 
different phases based upon their X-ray attenuation (BAKER et al., 
2012). Next step is to procedure the segmentation. One of the most 
straightforward techniques to segment a gray-scale CT image into a 
binary (or two-level) image is to define a threshold value. Traditionally, 
accomplishing a segmentation based in thresholding is to define a range 
of brightness values in the original image, select the pixel within this 
range as belonging to the foreground, and reject all of the other pixels to 
the background. Voxels with a gray value lower than that threshold 
value are considered to be the material phase to be analyzed (most cases 
pores). Following segmentation, a cleaning procedure using 
morphological operations can be applied to remove e.g. small numbers 
of pixels supposed not to be of interest, which are caused by artifacts. 
Once the segmented volume has been extracted microstructural 
information of individual or connected objects of interest can be 
quantified. From this data, conclusions may be drawn as to the effect of 
pore network on the transport properties (BLUNT et al., 2002; AL-
KHARUSI and BLUNT, 2007) as permeability of tight sandstones as 
unconventional resource. 
3.6.5. Permeability modeling based upon CT reconstructions 

 In addition to quantifying and evaluating pore structure 
information, X-ray CT datasets can be used as a basis for permeability 
simulations, still in its infancy in geosciences (BAKER et al., 2012). 
Permeabilities can be calculated by combining lattice-Boltzmann 
simulations with microCT reconstructions that have been segmented 
into fluid-containing vesicles (pores) and solid matrix. The lattice-
Boltzmann (LB) method simulates continuum fluid flow by modeling 
gas-molecule collisions on a lattice (DOS SANTOS et al., 2005) and it  
yields approximate solutions of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-
Stokes equations furnishing the fluid velocity and stress on the lattice at 
discrete time points (BAKER  et al., 2012). Nonetheless, there is still a

lack in the studies of permeability modeling based upon CT 
reconstructions for unconventional reservoirs, especially for TGS in 
?Darcy order as the ones analyzed in this thesis. To point out, e.g., 
TIWARI et al. (2013) recently published a work in which they 
characterize oil shale pore structure before and after pyrolysis by using 
X-ray microCT. The 3D pore network structure had pores as large as 
500 ?m generated after pyrolysis and the results of permeability found 
by LB simulation were from 173 to 2919 Darcy due to the considerable 
amount of fractures generated.  
 Figure 3.15 illustrates, according to BAKER et al. (2012), a 
transformation from a microCT image to a permeability simulation.  

 
Figure 3.15: LB simulations from CT image. On the left side, a segmented 
image is shown with the true shape of the vesicles superimposed on white 

(pores) and green (solid) voxels. Enlarged on the right side are 
representative lattice nodes and the discrete fluid particle velocities; the 

mean fluid velocity and stresses are obtained from moments of this discrete 
velocity distribution. Note that particles are “bounced back” when they 

intercept a boundary node (squares), thereby enforcing a no-slip condition 
at the fluid-solid interface (BAKER et al., 2012). 

In this figure one can see a thresholded image ROI is converted to a 
binary image comprised by distinct voxels either a pore (white) or solid 
(green), with its center at a lattice node (circles in the figure). Fluid 
“particles” at every lattice node can move in distinct directions to the 
nearest and next-nearest nodes on a 3D cubic lattice. At each time step, 
collision and streaming steps relax the discrete fluid-particle velocity 
distribution toward equilibrium, while conserving mass and momentum. 
Moments of the particle velocity distribution furnish the velocity and 
stress; and nodes that are separated by a fluid-solid interface are 
“bounced back”, thereby achieving a no-slip boundary condition at the

boundary nodes (squares in Figure 3.15). Note that fluid within every 
domain that is enclosed by boundary nodes (i.e., the solid) develops a 
hydrostatic pressure when a steady uniform body force is applied to all 
lattice nodes. After reaching steady state, which typically occurs in 
O(104) lattice-Boltzmann time steps (depending on the porosity and 
fluid viscosity), the permeability is calculated as the product of the fluid 
viscosity and the ratio of the steady superficial fluid velocity to the 
mean pressure gradient. One challenge for these simulations is to obtain 
sample volumes that are large enough and have adequate spatial 
resolution but small enough to not overwhelm the available computing 
resources. The size of X-ray tomograms with micron-scale spatial 
resolution is limited by X-ray beam dimensions and detector size. 
Furthermore, simulation time becomes prohibitive on a single processor 
with more than O(1003) lattice nodes (BAKER et al., 2012). 

3.7. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance 
 For the past decades the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
technology has gained acceptance as a petrophysical tool for evaluating 
reservoir properties (CAI et al., 2013). NMR has been widely used, e. 
g., in petrophysical characterization of sandstones and carbonates 
(MARSCHALL et al., 1995; YAO et al., 2010), although little attention 
has been paid in the use of this technique concerning to the study of 
petrophysical properties of tight gas sandstones.  
 Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers were 
developed currently with logging tools so that wellbore measurements 
could be duplicated on core samples in the laboratory (GRIFFIN et al., 
1993). The low frequency NMR spin–spin relaxation time (T2) 
distributions have been routinely applied in the petroleum industry to 
characterize rock matrix and measure downhole fluid properties 
(HIRASAKI et al., 2003). NMR analysis can be performed in both the 
saturated and partially saturated states samples. In the laboratory NMR 
studies are routinely conducted for the following purposes 
(WIKIPETRO – NMR Petrophysics): 

- Verifying formation porosity; 
- Evaluating textural effects, such as microporosity, on NMR-

log response; 
- Determining formation-specific models that enhance the 

accuracy of determining bulk-volume-irreducible (BVI) 
water, free-fluid index (FFI), and, ultimately, permeability;

- Developing models to identify and quantify hydrocarbons, 
including residual oil; 

- Developing models to predict changes in pore size (facies). 
 The connection between NMR measurements and petrophysical 
parameters stems from the strong effect that the rock surface has in 
promoting magnetic decay of saturating fluids. Therefore, a brief survey 
on the principles and the applicability of low-field NMR in structural 
studies of reservoir rocks is presented following. 
3.7.1. Principles of NMR 

 The NMR phenomenon is based on the fact that nuclei of atoms 
have magnetic properties that can be utilized to yield chemical 
information. Quantum mechanically subatomic particles (protons, 
neutrons and electrons) have spin. In some atoms (e. g. 12C, 16O, 32S) the 
spins are paired and cancel each other out so that the nucleus of the atom 
has no overall spin. However, in many atoms such as 1H, 13C, 31P, 15N, 
19F the nucleus does possess an overall spin (EDWARDS, 2010). In this 
matter, NMR measurements can be made on any nucleus that has an odd 
number of protons or neutrons or both. Hydrogen, which has only one 
proton and no neutrons, is abundant in both water and hydrocarbons, has 
a relatively large magnetic moment, and produces a strong signal 
(COATES et al., 1999). Following the monograph “NMR Logging: 
principles &amp;amp; applications.” by COATES et al. (1999), the concepts in 
fundamentals of NMR physics can be found to be: nuclear magnetism, 
polarization, T1 and T2 relaxation times, pulse tipping, free induction 
decay and spin echoes and CMPG pulse sequences. 

3.7.1.1. Polarization  

 The first step in a NMR measurement consists in aligning 
magnetic nuclei with a static magnetic field, B0. When B0 is applied to a 
magnetic nucleus, B0 exerts a torque on the nucleus that acts to align the 
nuclear spin axis with B0. When a torque is applied to a spinning object, 
the axis of the object moves perpendicular to the torque in a motion 
called precession (Figure 3.16, left). Thus, when B0 is applied to a 
magnetic nucleus, the nucleus will precess around B0. The precessional 
frequency (f) is called the Larmor frequency and given by:

where ? is the gyromagnetic ratio, a measure of the strength of the 
nuclear magnetism. For hydrogen, ?/2? = 42.58 MHz/tesla. For a given 
magnetic field, different nuclear species have different Larmor 
frequencies; therefore, the various species can be differentiated on the 
basis of these frequencies. Alternatively, for a given nuclear species, 
such as hydrogen, ? has a fixed value being the Larmor frequency is a 
function of the strength of the static magnetic field.  

 
Figure 3.16: Under external magnetic field application (left), the 

precessional frequency of a nucleus will depend on its gyromagnetic ratio 
and the strength of this field. The alignment of the precessional axis of the 

nucleus with respect to the direction of the external field (right) will 
determine the energy state of the nucleus (COATES et al., 1999). 

 According to quantum mechanics, when a proton is subjected to 
an external magnetic field it is forced into one of two energy states as 
shown in Figure 3.16 (right). This energy state of a particular proton 
depends on the orientation of the precessional axis of the proton with 
respect to the direction of the external field. When the precessional axis 
is parallel to B0, the proton is in the low-energy state, which is the 
preferred state. When the precessional axis is anti-parallel to B0, the 
proton is in the high-energy state. The direction of B0 is designated as 
the longitudinal direction.  
 When a large number of spinning protons are precessing about 
B0, more spins are precessing parallel to B0 than anti-parallel (COATES, 
et al., 1999). The difference between the number of protons aligned 
parallel and anti-parallel to the B0 field forms the bulk magnetization M0 
that provides the signal measured by a NMR device. Therefore, the 
macroscopic magnetization M0 is defined as the net magnetic moment

with k being the Boltzman’s constant, T the absolute temperature in 
Kelvin; h the Planck’s constant and I the spin quantum number of the 
nucleus.  

3.7.1.2. Pulse tipping and free induction decay 

 The second step performed in a NMR measurement is to tip the 
magnetization from the longitudinal direction to a transverse plane. This 
tipping is accomplished by applying an oscillating magnetic field (B1) 
perpendicular to B0. For effective tipping, the frequency of B1 must be 
equal the Larmor frequency of the protons relative to B0.  From the 
quantum mechanics view, if a proton is at the low-energy state, it may 
absorb energy provided by B1 and jump to the high-energy state. The 
application of B1 also causes the protons to precess in phase with one 
another. This change in energy state and in-phase precession caused by 
B1 is called nuclear magnetic resonance. 
 The B1 field used in NMR logging is a pulsed oscillating 
magnetic field. Macroscopically, magnetization is tipped 90° B1 pulse 
and precesses in the transverse plane. When the B1 field is turned off, 
the proton population begins to lose phase coherency (diphase), i.e., the 
precessions of the protons will no longer be in phase with one another. 
Therefore, a receiver coil that measures magnetization in the transverse 
direction will detect a decaying signal, usually exponential and called 
free induction decay (FID). The FID time constant (T2

*) is very short (in 
the microseconds order) and caused by magnetic-field inhomogeneity, 
(?H), that are due to the magnetic field gradient and to certain molecular 
processes that occur in the measured material (COATES, et al., 1999). 
In rocks, the internal gradients that degrade the measurements (G) 
resulting from field inhomogeneity are a complicated function of 
microgeometry but are on the order of ?H divided by the grain size 
(STRALEY et al., 1997). 

3.7.1.3. Spin echo detection and CPMG sequence 

 The dephasing discussed about is reversible once the proton 
magnetization vectors in the transverse planes can be re-phased when a 
180° B1 pulse is applied. Considering that if a transverse magnetization 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
Mayka Schmitt                                                             75 

vector has phase angle ?, then application of a 180° B1 pulse will change 
the phase angle to -?. In effect, the phase order of the transverse 
magnetization vectors is reversed, so that the slower vectors are ahead of 
the faster vectors. When the faster vectors overtake the slower vectors 
the rephrasing occurs and a signal is generated, see analogy in Figure 
3.17. This signal is called a “spin echo” or “Hahn echo” and its intensity 
depends only of the intrinsic T2 sample. The same time ? transpired 
between the application of the 90° B1 pulse and the 180° B1 pulse will 
transpire between the application of the 180° B1 pulse and the peak of 
the spin-echo, so the spin echo peak occurs at 2?. This process of 
rephrasing (encoding) time equals dephasing (decoding) time defines 
the inter-eco spacing (TE) and it is illustrated in Figure 3.18(a) which 
also shows that although a single spin echo decays very quickly, 180° 
pulses can be applied repeatedly to rephase the magnetization 
components and generate a series of spin echoes. The number of pulses 
in a pulse train is called NE. The entire pulse sequence of a 90° B1 pulse 
followed by a long series of 180° B1 pulses is called a CPMG sequence 
after, Carr, Purcell, Meiboom, and Gill (COATES et al., 1999; CHEN et 
al., 2002). 

 
Figure 3.17: Analogy of dephasing process: (a) After departure the runners 

are dispersed (rephase); (b) Reversing the direction (180° B1 pulse), they 
can arrive together (dephasing) (DA SILVA JÚNIOR, 2013).  

During a CPMG sequence, the 90° B1 pulse reorients the polarization so 
that there is no longer any longitudinal polarization of the protons, and 
the 180° B1 pulses suppress the buildup of new longitudinal polarization. 
Hence, the protons are completely randomized at the end of a CPMG 
sequence. To start the next CPMG sequence, the protons must be

polarized again, so a waiting time (TW) during which repolarization 
occurs is necessary. In Figure 3.18(b) a typical NMR measurement 
timing diagram is illustrated. In the upper section of this figure two 
CPMG sequences are shown with each consisting of a 90° B1 pulse, 
followed by a series of 180° B1 pulses. In the bottom polarization events 
(T1 relaxation curves) and the spin-echo trains (T2 relaxation curves) 
associated with two CPMG sequences are occurring, where T2 is 
obtained from the fitting of the generated curve by the maximal 
amplitude of the spin echoes. In this thesis one-dimensional CPMG 
experiments were performed to obtain transverse relaxation decays, 
which were subsequently inverted by one-dimensional inverse Laplace 
transformation (GODEFROY and CALLAGHAN, 2003; HOLMES, 
2012) to obtain a transverse relaxation time distribution of T2.

 Simply put, the low-field NMR procedure measures three 
properties: the equilibrium nuclear magnetization, Meq and the two 
principal NMR relaxation times, T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 
(transverse relaxation time). Mn is proportional to the fluid-filled 
porosity, and T1 and T2 have been correlated with petrophysical 
properties such as pore size, producible fluid, and permeability. 
Although T1 measurements are more common in the literature, they are 
more time consuming to measure than T2 measurements (STRALEY et 
al., 1997). Hence, the parameter T2 is widely obtained in CPMG 
sequences and also the measured parameter in this work. 
3.7.2. Multi-exponential decay and properties in reservoir rocks 

 Reservoir rocks commonly exhibit a distribution of pore sizes and 
frequently contain more than one fluid type. Therefore, the spin echo 
train (transverse magnetization measurements) recorded with a CPMG 
sequence does not decay with a single T2 value but instead with a 
distribution of T2 values that can be described by: 

2( ) (0) ,i
t

T
iM t M e

?

= ?  (3.16) 
where M(t) is the measured magnetization at time t, Mi(0) is the initial 
magnetization from the ith component of relaxation; T2i is the decay 
constant of the ith component of transverse relaxation and the summation 
is over the whole sample; i.e., all pores and all different types of fluid. 
Figure 3.19 illustrates the multi-exponential decay character of a porous 
medium containing pores of different sizes and a single wetting phase. 
Surface to volume ratio (S/V) becomes dominant when a short inter echo 
spacing is used and the formation is only brine-saturated. Under this 
condition, T2 is directly proportional to the pore size. When all pores are 
assumed to have the similar geometric shape, the largest pores (in the 
left column) have the lowest S/V and thus the longest T2 value, while the 
smallest pores have the highest S/V and the shortest T2 values. For a 
single pore, the magnetization decays exponentially, and the signal 
amplitude is given by:

where ?2 is the surface relaxivity and M0 is proportional to the volume 
of fluid in the pore. When the complete distribution (bottom of Figure 
3.19) of the 100% water-saturated pores is considered, these pores 
exhibit a distribution of T2 values.

Figure 3.19: A 100% water-saturated pore (upper left) has a single T2 value 

that depends on pore size, and thus its spin-echo train exhibits a single-
exponential decay (upper right) that also depends on pore size. Multiple 
pores at 100% water saturation (bottom left) have multiple T2 values that 

depend on the pore sizes, and thus their composite spin-echo train exhibits 
multi-exponential decay (bottom right) (COATES et al., 1999). 

The associated signal amplitude is the sum of the signal amplitudes 
arising from the fluid in individual pores, and the signal amplitude is 
given by:

porosity). Therefore, the T2 distribution (in the form of the amplitudes 
M0i associated with the time constants T2i) can be calibrated to the 
porosity distribution considering the individual pores ?i with the 
associated time constants T2i. 
 The fact that NMR porosity depends only on the fluid contents of 
the sample makes its measurements very capable to furnish connected 
and unconnected porosities. The strength of the NMR signal is 
proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in a NMR tool-dependent 
rock volume (HAMADA et al., 2001). For water, oil and gas, NMR 
results can be expressed as the percentage of fluid volume in the rock 
volume (MENGER and PRAMMER, 1998). Figure 3.20 shows, in a 
qualitative way, the NMR properties of different fluids that can be found 
in the pore space (COATES et al, 1999). Hence, to allow reliable fluid 
typing, linear gradient field NMR tools have to be capable of measuring 
relaxation times from less than 1 ms to several seconds (HAMADA et 
al., 2001). As one can see in Figure 3.20, clay-bound water, capillary-
bound water, and movable water occupy different pore sizes and 
locations. Hydrocarbon fluids differ from brine in their locations in the 
pore space, usually occupying the larger pores. In general, bound fluids 
have very short T1 and T2 times, along with slow diffusion (D) that is 
due to the restriction of molecular movement in small pores, behavior 
that we expect to find in unconventional reservoir rocks such as the tight 
gas sandstones analyzed in this work. Free water commonly exhibits 
medium T1, T2, and D values. Natural gas exhibits very long T1 times 
but short T2 times and a single-exponential type of relaxation decay. 
NMR characteristics of oils dependent manly on oil viscosities, lighter 
oils are highly diffusive, have long T1 and T2 times, and often exhibit a 
single-exponential decay. Based on the unique NMR characteristics of 
the signals from the pore fluids, applications have been developed to 
identify and, in some cases, quantify the type of hydrocarbon present 
(COATES et al., 1999). However, in this work NMR is used only to 
analyze the pore structure of cleaned tight gas sandstones samples 100% 
saturated under NaCl brines of 10 g/l salinity.

al., (1999), for different fluid types and pore sizes demonstrating the 
variability and complexity of the T1 and T2 relaxation measurements. 

3.7.3. Transforming a T2 distribution to a pore size distribution 

 The essential information on rock or sedimentary samples, which 
can be provided by low-field NMR, is the size distribution of fluid-filled 
pores (CHEN et al., 2002). As already stated above, theoretically, 
pulsed NMR applied in the present work measures the magnetization 
(M) and the transverse relaxation time (T2) of hydrogen nuclei contained 
in the pore fluids. The measurement of T2 relaxation is preferred as it is 
fast and usually provides similar distribution to T1 (KLEINBERG et al., 
1993; YAO et al., 2010). For fluids confined in pores, the T2 value can 
be shorter than that of the bulk fluid if the fluid interacts with the rock 
surface, which promotes NMR relaxation (KENYON et al., 1992). 
Three different mechanisms, which operate in parallel, contribute to the 
overall apparent relaxation rate (1/T2A) of fluid in porous media (CHEN 
et al., 2002):

The subscripts A, B, S and D indicate respectively: apparent, bulk, 
surface-induced, and diffusion-induced mechanisms. The bulk 
relaxation time is a property of the fluid only. Because the relaxation 
time of liquid in rocks is much shorter than the relaxation time of bulk 
liquid, the bulk term above can be neglected. The surface-induced 
relaxation (due to interaction between fluid and the solid surface) and

where ? is the gyromagnetic ratio, G is an internal magnetic field 
gradient, ? is the echo time and Do is the self-diffusion coefficient of the 
liquid. For low frequency and short pulse spacing, T2 carries the same 
pore information as T1, and diffusion relaxation can be reduced when a 
low and uniform magnetic field and a short pulse spacing is used (YAO 
et al., 2010). In the present work we used low-field NMR technique, 
thus, the NMR T2 relaxation examined is mainly attributed to surface 
relaxation, which occurs at the interface between water and rock grains. 
Under this condition the enhancement in T2 decay coming from 
diffusion in the inhomogeneous local magnetic fields is negligible 
compared with the surface relaxation mechanism. Therefore, according 
to KENYON (1992) and KLEINBERG (1996) the measured T2 values 
are a function of the surface to volume ratio of pores given by: 

2

? ? ?= ? ?
? ?

 (3.24) 

where T2 is the transverse relaxation time resulting from surface 
interactions and ?2 is a constant representing the transverse relaxation 
strength. As T2 is proportional to V/S, which in turn is proportional to 
pore size in rock samples, this means that in small pores relaxation is 
faster than in large pores as shown in Equation (3.24). 
 A rock generally consists of a large number of pores of different 
sizes. When two or three fluid phases are present, however, the non-
wetting phases occupy the larger pores while the wetting phase occupies 
the smaller pores because of the capillary effect. In addition, the 
relaxation rate of non-wetting fluids is smaller than that of wetting fluids 
because the T2 of non-wetting fluid does not include the surface term. 
Both the capillary and surface effect result in shorter T2 for wetting-
phase fluids compared to the T2 for the same fluid types in bulk. Much 
less change is expected for the non-wetting fluid T2. Thus, different fluid 
phases can be identified by carefully analyzing the T2 distribution for

multiphase saturation cases, not the case of present thesis where cleaned 
samples saturated with water were analyzed. 
 In conventional reservoir, NMR has the capacity to sense fluids 
in the pore space pretty much independent of lithology. The strength of 
the NMR signal is directly proportional to the number of hydrogen 
atoms present which provides a direct porosity measurement in brine 
saturated rocks. The relaxation time in the fast diffusion limit can be 
directly related to the pore body containing the fluid. On the other hand, 
because in unconventional reservoir (like shale and TGS), the porosities 
are typically much smaller than in other reservoir rocks, the signal 
strength is very weak. E.g., in a situation where there is a significant 
fraction of components with T2 of 1 ms or shorter, the CPMG with ? of 1 
ms will underestimate the contribution from this part (smaller pores) in 
an ordinary T2 distribution. Therefore, as one can see from Eq. (3.23) a 
way to include signal and information that is initially lost or weighted 
differently with a bigger ? value is simply to use smaller ? values. 
According to SONDERGELD et al. (2010), for a fully saturated Berea 
sandstone plug only 24 scans are required for accurate porosity 
measurement while an equivalent shale measurement 10,000 scans need 
to be taken. Small pore size equates to fast T2 relaxation time 
(SONDERGELD, et al., 2010). A typical T2 relaxation spectrum for AR 
gas shale is shown in Figure 3.21(a) (SONDERGELD, et al., 2010) 
where most of the signal occurs below the 3 ms cutoff (red vertical line) 
for “clay bound” water. The authors used a surface relaxivity conversion 
of 0.05 ?m/ms and found consistent results of body pore sizes 
distribution with SEM observations. Figure 3.21(b) illustrates the 
contributions of T2 components using distinct motional encoding/ 
decoding intervals, ?, from a CPMG sequence in a brine saturated rock 
core sample (SORLAND et al., 2007). As one can see the usage of high 
? values might not represent the complete T2 distribution of the system. 
 To assure the investigation of the smaller pores associated with 
the clay content for the analyzed TGS, a total of 250 scans were 
performed in small rock plugs (7 mm x 7 mm) using distinct intervals of 
? data points, ranging from 0.01 to 5000 ms. A Maran Ultra 23 MHz 
(0.5 Tesla) instrument was used to acquire data. In general, spectrometer 
frequencies are specified using two parameters, a fixed number that 
depends on the magnetic field strength of the instrument and the 
observed nuclei, and a user adjustable offset that is added to the fixed 
number to give the frequency of the transmitted pulse. The spectral 
width is adjusted to be just large enough to span all of the resonance

3.8. Photoacoustic spectroscopy and thermal diffusivity  
The thermal diffusivity, (?), of a material is defined as: 

p

K
C

?
?

=  (3.25) 

where K is the thermal conductivity, Cp is the specific heat and ? is the 
mass density.  
 Thermal diffusivity is a dynamic thermal property which 
characterizes heat conduction inside a material under non-stationary 
conditions; this characteristic makes the thermal property essential for 
the study and modeling of thermal processes (ANDREW, 1986; 
BALDERAS-LÓPEZ, 2006). Thermal diffusivities of rocks are 
generally strong functions of temperature, values decreasing with 
increasing temperature (SOMERTON, 1992). VOSTEEN and 
SCHELLSCHMIDT (2003) studing magmatic, metamorphic and 
sedimentary rocks, observed that in the interval of temperature range of 
1-300 oC, the thermal conductivity decreases between 25% and 44% and 
the thermal diffusivity however by 42–54%. The rate of the heat flow, 
and hence how deep the changes in the temperature at the surface 
penetrate, depends on ? (SMITH, 2001). So in the context of the 
petroleum reservoir engineering, for a same geologic formation, the 
increase of temperature with depth would be favorable to the efficiency 
of seal rocks but decrease the flow rate for the petroleum exploration. 
The thermal diffusivity is directly related to the thermal conductivity

and rock thermal conductivity within any geothermal reservoir is a key 
parameter to the conductive heat flow, to the distribution of 
temperatures and to the definition of a barrier to hold the accumulated 
energy (ARRIAGA, 1993). The thermal conductivity of volcanic rocks 
depends mainly on the characteristics of its mineral elements, on the 
conductivity of the fluids filling the pores and on the size and geometry 
of the pore space (ZIMMERMAN, 1988). In the present thesis we apply 
the photoacoustic spectroscopy technology (PAS) in an open 
photoacoustic cell (OPC) to investigate the thermal diffusivity of seal 
rocks originating from three different geologic fields. The obtained 
results were correlated within mineralogy and pore structures of 
analyzed rocks.  
3.8.1. PAS signal and mechanisms 

 When a modulated light beam impinges on the material inside a 
photoacoustic gas cell, the absorbed light is converted into periodic heat 
and a PAS signal is created. The dependence of the PAS signal on the 
optical absorption coefficient and the light-to-heat conversion efficiency 
may be used to calculate the nonradiative de-excitation efficiency and to 
study the photoinduced energy conversion process. The PAS signal is 
directly proportional to the light-to-heat conversion efficiency due to 
nonradiative processes in the material (ZIEGLER and HASSELMAN, 
1981). After the work of Rosencwaig and Gersho (1976), the PAS effect 
has been used for measuring the thermal properties of solid samples in 
different material science areas such as semiconductors (DE LIMA et 
al., 2007; POFFO et al., 2011); metals (LIMA et al., 2005; ROUSSET 
et al., 1983); polymers (LACHAINE and POULET, 1984); sedimentary 
rocks (GUIMARÃES et al., 2013) and coals (BISWAS et al., 1983). As 
well as coal, being an opaque material which highly absorbs the incident 
light, seal rocks are extremely heterogeneous materials and constituted 
of a very fine porous structure. It is well known that the elastic and 
thermal properties of microscopically inhomogeneous materials are 
substantially different from homogeneous materials (IVANOV et al., 
1992). In the modern view of materials, a solid may be comprised of 
free electrons and atoms bound in a periodic arrangement called the 
lattice. Accordingly, transport of thermal energy may be due to two 
effects: the migration of free electrons and lattice vibrational waves. 
When viewed as a particle-like phenomenon, the lattice vibration quanta 
are termed phonons. In pure metals, the electron contribution to 
conduction heat transfer dominates, while in nonconductors such as seal

rocks and semiconductors, the phonon contribution is dominant 
(INCROPERA et al., 2006). For a thermally thick sedimentary seal rock 
sample, we expect the following two processes contributing to the PAS 
signal amplitude: 

(i) Thermal diffusion or intraband nonradiative 
thermalization: 

When the absorbed photon energy is greater than the band gap an 
electron is created in the conduction band and a hole is left in the 
valence band. The excess energies of the electron (the energy 
difference between the conduction band and the initial energy of 
the photogenerated electron) and the hole (the energy difference 
between the valence band and the initial energy of the 
photogenerated hole) appear in the respective carriers as kinetic 
energy. The initial electron and hole distributions are not 
Boltzmann-like, and the first step toward establishing 
equilibrium is for the electrons and holes to interact separately 
through their respective carrier-carrier collisions and inter-valley 
scattering to form separate Boltzmann distributions of electrons 
and holes. The two Boltzmann distributions of electrons and 
holes can then be separately assigned an electron and hole 
temperature that reflects the distributions of kinetic energy in the 
respective charge carrier populations. The Boltzmann distribution 
applies only to particles at a high enough temperature and low 
enough density that quantum effects can be ignored. If photon 
absorption produces electrons and holes, each with initial 
excessive kinetic energies at least kT (k = Boltzmann's constant, 
and T = the temperature in Kelvin) above the conduction and 
valence bands, then both initial carrier temperatures are always 
above the lattice temperature; these carriers are called hot carriers 
(i.e. hot electrons and hot holes). This first stage of relaxation 
occurs very rapidly (&lt;100 fs where 1 femtosecond = 10-15 s). It is 
often referred to as carrier thermalization and results in a thermal 
distribution described by Boltzmann statistics. The next step is 
for the hot electrons and hot holes to achieve thermal equilibrium 
with the semiconductor lattice. The lattice temperature is 
determined by thermal equilibrium of the phonons with the 
surroundings, and is the ambient temperature, which is lower 
than the initial hot-electron and hot-hole temperatures. 
Equilibrium of the hot carriers with the lattice is achieved 
through carrier-phonon interactions (phonon emission through

electron- and hole-scattering), in which the excess kinetic energy 
of the carriers is transferred to the phonons. The phonon emission 
results in cooling of the carriers and heating of the lattice until 
the carrier and lattice temperatures become equal. This process is 
called carrier cooling (NOZIK, 2001; SUN et al., 2005). 
IVANOV et al. (1992) performed a theoretical and experimental 
investigation of the transport of vibrational excitations in ceramic 
materials and ROSENCWAIG and GERSHO (1976) carried out 
a deeper analysis of the theory of the photoacoustic effect with 
solids. The contribution of the thermal diffusion (TD) process in 
a thermally thick sample to the PAS signal decreases 
exponentially with the modulation frequency as:

Also considering the thermal diffusion process contribution in 
the PAS signal, Balderas-López et al. (BALDERAS-LÓPEZ et 
al., 1999) reported a new photoacoustic methodology to measure 
thermal diffusivity of materials. It is based only on the 
identification of the first discontinuity in the photoacoustic phase 
lag predicted by using the Roscencwaig model without the need 
to fit a set of experimental data. According to these authors, the 
complete photoacoustic signal for an optically opaque sample is 
given by the following expression:

the thermally thick regime ( cff &gt; ). The photoacoustic phase

analyzed sample, it is observed in the low frequency range.   
(ii) Thermoelastic bending: 
When a temperature gradient is generated within the sample, 
across its thickness, the thermoelastic bending process 
contributes to the PAS signal. This contribution shows a 
modulation frequency dependence of the type 0.1?f . The thermal 
diffusivity can be determined by fitting the phase of the PAS 
signal to the expression:

the PAS signal can be used to identify this process and determine 
the thermal diffusivity. 

In a practical manner, the contribution of each process to the pressure 
variation in the photoacoustic cell can easily be found through the

following procedure (POFFO et al., 2011): (a) by plotting ln S versus 
f   and ph?  (in radians) versus f , the “a” value is the slope of the 

straight line fitting the data in the low modulation frequency range and, 
the values calculated from both plots must be equal, when the thermal 
diffusion process in present; (b) by plotting log S versus log f, the slope 
of the straight line fitting the data in the high modulation frequency 
range highlights the contribution of the thermoelastic bending (TB) 
process showing a modulation frequency dependence of the type f -1.0. In 
this case, ?s can be determined by fitting the plot ph?  (in radians) 
versus f, in the appropriate modulation frequency range, to the 
expression of phase in Eq. (3.31). In this work we executed this 
procedure using the software OriginPro v.7.

4. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

4.1. Materials and methods 
 All rock samples analyzed were parts of slab or broken core and 
free of any hydrocarbon. The cores were carefully cleaned intending to 
keep the organic contents of rock samples in a state as preserved as 
possible however free of hydrocarbons. Therefore, in the petrophysical 
laboratory an ultrasonic cleaning method using mixtures of toluene 
and/or methanol was applied to remove hydrocarbons from the samples. 
By this process we intended to retain the clay material present on the 
surface of the porous medium of fine grained rocks such as the seal 
rocks and the tight gas sandstones (TGS) analyzed in the present work. 
 Table 4.1 shows an overview over the analyzed TGS and seal 
rocks and the performed experiments.

vertically and horizontally to the bedding plane. The samples (from oil 
or gas fields) were provided by the Brazilian center for research on 
petroleum, CENPES/Petrobras. In the subsequent chapters we expose a 
short explanation bearing the experimental procedure and techniques 
applied in the present work.   
4.1.1. Pulse-decay permeability 

 Measuring the permeability of tight gas sandstones is a 
challenging task because standard measuring techniques are generally 
impractical and difficult to apply. Customary methods of measuring 
permeability in the laboratory are based on steady-state flow. However, 
if the permeability is low, long periods of time are required to establish 
steady-state flow and thus these procedures are impractical. The 
transient flow method applied in the present work used nitrogen gas as 
fluid flow from the upstream reservoir through the sample to the 
downstream reservoir. Thereby the sample permeability could be 
calculated from the observed pressure decay in the upstream reservoir. 
 Pulse decay measurements were carried out using a CoreLab 
PDP-200 pulse decay permeameter, which is ideal for low-permeability 
porous media with intrinsic permeabilities below 0.1 mD. It was built 
according to the design described by JONES (1997), which is shown in 
Figure 3.3(a) with the two small reservoirs being equal in volume 
(around 5 cm3 each). In this method, the pore volume must be 
determined independently so we used the values obtained from the 
N2GA and MICP combination. The PDP-200 software calculates the 
permeability of the sample based on the pressure decay curves. Rock 
samples of 1.5 inches in diameter and about 1 inch in length were dried 
to a constant weight in an oven at 80 oC before all measurements. The 
gas permeability was measured at net confining stresses representative 
of in-situ conditions, i.e., for each sample originating from distinct 
wells, a distinct confining pressure was applied. A consequence of using 
gas to measure permeability is the gas slip on the solid surface, which 
creates a deviation from the Poiseuilles flow, known as the Klinkenberg 
correction (TIAB and DONALDSON, 2004). The Klinkenberg 
permeability was calculated from multiple measurements at different 
mean pore pressures. The high mean pore pressure reduces the effect of 
gas slippage and reduces the gas compressibility and the magnitude of 
its change with small pressure variations (JONES, 1997). Therefore, it 
should be as high as practicable. In the experiments reported herein the

maximum mean pore pressures allowed by the PDP transducer used was 
6.89 MPa, only sample A-17V was also tested at 13.10 MPa.  
4.1.2. Mercury intrusion capillary pressure 

 The mercury intrusion capillary pressure experiments were 
carried out with an Autopore IV 9500 by Micromeritics with a pressure 
range up to 413.69 MPa. The eleven samples analyzed (crushed into 
pieces of about 1.4 mesh size) had masses between 3.190 and 8.810 g. 
The equivalent pore radius was computed according to the capillary 
pressure using the Washburn equation with Pw ranging from 0.003 to 
413 MPa, interfacial tension ?Hg = 485 mN/m and wetting angle ?Hg = 
140o. It is of interest to mention that the wetting angle is not a function 
of the material pore size but is an intrinsic property of a solid-fluid 
system (ADAMSON, 1990). Values between 130 and 140o are 
conventionally assumed since the cohesive forces between the mercury 
atoms are greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and other 
solids, leading to no relevant changes in the contact angle. Several 
authors have assumed a mercury contact angle of around 140o 
(ECHEVERRÍA et al., 1999; FAVVAS et al., 2009; SCHLÖMER and 
KROOSS, 1997), and 130o (KAUFMANN et al., 2009). In this study we 
chose the value 140o. 
4.1.3. Nitrogen gas adsorption 

 Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K on an 
accelerated surface area and porosimetry system (ASAP 2020, 
Micromeritics Instruments). The samples were previously crushed into 
pieces of about 3 mesh size (mass between 0.89 and 1.72 g), dried in an 
oven at 80 oC overnight and outgassed under high vacuum (&lt;10 mmHg) 
for 10 h at 110 oC on the apparatus. The free space (dead volume of the 
tube) was determined volumetrically using helium before the 
measurements were taken for the adsorption isotherm. The saturation 
vapor pressure Po of N2 at 77 K was determined every 120 min. during 
the experiment using a nitrogen vapor pressure thermometer. An 
equilibration time of 10 s was applied in the analysis. Both adsorption 
and desorption isotherms were measured, although only the adsorption 
data was used to determine the pore structure information. In addition, 
the nitrogen statistical film thickness for the BET surface area was 
assessed for relative pressures between 0.021 and 0.203.

4.1.4. X-ray diffraction analysis 

 Sample preparation for XRD analysis was performed by crushing 
a fine powder from rock pieces. For finer and controlled particle size 
grinding we used a swing/disc mill (Spex Shatter Box) commercial 
machine operating for 3 min. for each sample. According to Buhrke et 
al., (1998) three conditions are necessary to achieve high degrees of 
accuracy in quantitative XRD: total randomness of the crystallite 
orientations, sufficient number of crystallites in the experimental 
specimen to meet statistical requirements, and sufficient diffraction 
intensity measured to satisfy counting statistics. Since we had enough 
amount of sample, the reduction of the sample particle size and an 
ideally random specimen (in which the probability of orientation for any 
and all Bragg planes is equally likely for any direction in space) were 
obtained. Thus, the samples within particle size smaller than 400-mesh 
(38 ?m) were prepared in a specific XRD sample holder to minimize 
preferred orientation and surface roughness.  
 The XRD measurements were performed in a D4 ENDEAVOR 
equipment from Bruker company coupled by graphite secondary 
monochromator and Co K-alpha radiation. After being acquired the 
XRD patterns were analyzed using Diffract.Suite EVA Software, for 
semi-quantitative identification of mineralogical phases. The qualitative 
identification procedure was to search initially for a mineral that had the 
strongest peaks, and follows with confirming the choice by finding the 
positions of weaker peaks for the same mineral.  
4.1.5. Low-field NMR analysis 

 In this work, one set of low-field NMR experiments was designed 
to study the pore structures, pore types and sizes, porosity and 
parameters for permeability prediction on five tight sandstones from the 
Brazilian gas field named A. The NMR analysis was conducted on five 
mini plugs (~ 7mm x 7mm) of the TGS samples (A-11V, A-12V, A-
12H, A-17V and A-19V) fully saturated with 10,000 KCl brine in a 
MARAN 23 MHz Ultra Magnetic Resonance Core Analyzer. The 
samples were kept immersed in the solution under vacuum for more 
than 48 h and then taken out for pressure-saturation at 3 MPa for another 
96 h. Following that, they were placed in jars full of brine and 
transferred into the water bath with a temperature of 40 °C for a 
minimum of 1 or 2 h to be prepared for NMR tests. Each mini plug was 
placed in a NMR tube coupled in the equipment operating at 23 MHz 
for the hydrogen nucleus, to obtain the data of spin-spin relaxation time

determined by CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) technique. The 90° 
pulse of 10 ?s was calibrated automatically by the software of the 
instrument. The amplitude of the FID was sampled for 255 data points, 
ranging from 0.01 to 5000 ms; the intervals of spin-spin relaxation time 
determined by CPMG technique started from 0.5 to 250793 ?s. The 
relaxation values and relative intensities were obtained by fitting the 
exponential data with the aid of the program. The schematic of the 
experimental setup of NMR is shown in Figure 4.1.

4.1.6. X-ray nano- and microCT 

 In order to investigate 3D images of tight gas sandstones’ pore 
microstructure ranging to sub-micrometers in size, a computer 
tomography (CT) characterization at high resolutions is applied. In the 
present work this was performed in two microCT (XRadia Versa XRM-
500) and one nanoCT (XRadia UltraXRM-L200) equipments with 
resolution from 0.7 µm to 64 nm. Table 4.2 shows the parameters used 
for the micro- and nanoCT acquisitions in the analyzed tight gas 
sandstones. As one can see, we exposed two TGS samples of field A (A-
11V and A-17V) to the X-ray CT technique in distinct resolutions. For 
the experiments we had the criteria of preparing the samples as cylinders 
(to decrease image artifacts) and we chose the diameters to be as big as 
possible (to have enough representative volume) but still permitting 
sufficient X-ray transmission for imaging acquisition (YANG et al., 
2013). The diameter of the mini cores prepared for the three distinct 
acquired resolutions (Res1, Res2 and Res3) were respectively 7 mm, 2 
mm and 0.1 mm.

 Besides of sample size the image resolution also depends on: the 
X-ray detector itself, the focal spot size, the geometric magnification, 
the stability of the rotation mechanism and the filtering algorithm used 
to reconstruct the images. For the acquisition taken in the microCT 
measurements (XRadia VersaXRM-500) we optimized the resolution by 
locating the source and detector as close as possible to the sample. For 
each of the two tight gas sandstones analyzed, a total of 1600 to 2000 
projections were taken at equal angular intervals within distinct 
exposure times and source voltage as shown in Table 4.2. It is usual, 
that, during the microCT image acquisition, noise filters including those 
used to counter various artifacts or image anomalies which can occur 
due to the reconstruction algorithms and the imaging processing itself 
(NGUYEN, 2011), are applied. However, aiming to obtain a bigger pore 
contrast no filter was used for the acquisition using the XRadia Versa 
XRM-500 microCT. The samples were glued on a metal extension and 
mounted between the source and the detector including the lenses for 
optical magnification using the clamp for the XRadia Versa XRM-500 
equipment. An optical magnification of 4 times was achieved, and, as 
the sample rotates 360o during the acquisition, the mounting position of

the analyzed cylinders was well centered allowing a complete rotation 
stage. For the XRadia UltraXRM-L200 equipment the sample 
preparation is much more difficult considering the sample size has to be 
very small and without fractures, therefore, prepared by laser ablation. 
  After experimental conditions were applied allowing the 
acquisition of radiographic projections, the X-ray shadow projections of 
the measured 3D object are defined as digitalized n x p pixel images. 
These images are then processed to obtain reconstructed cross-section 
images of linear attenuation coefficient values using a mathematical 
algorithm based on the filtered back-projection procedure implemented 
in the used equipment. Thus, a complete stacking of 2D cross-sections 
of the object with a single pixel distance between the slices is obtained, 
resulting in a 3D stack of isotropic voxels with a gray-scale of 16 bits, 
from which the 3D internal structure can finally be analyzed.  
4.1.7. The open photoacoustic cell 

 Three seal rocks originating from distinct fields and depths were 
analyzed by photoacoustic spectrometry. The basic requirements of the 
photoacoustic detection technique can be summarized as (ALMOND 
and PATEL, 1996): 

(iii) A light source and focusing instruments; 
(iv) Means of modulation light; 
(v) An appropriate photoacoustic cell itself and;  
(vi) A microphone and processing electronics.

 The PAS measurements were performed on a simple Open 
Photoacoustic Cell (OPC) configuration, as shown in Figure 4.2 with an 
accuracy of thermal diffusivity property of 5%. This configuration 
consisted of a 250 W quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) lamp and a 
Bentham 605 current power supply. After being heat filtered by a water 
lens, the light is mechanically chopped by a Perkin-Elmer chopper, 
model 197, and focused onto the sample. As one can see the sample is 
mounted directly onto the front sound inlet of an electret microphone 
(DE LIMA et al., 1992) and sealed by vacuum grease. The output 
voltage from the microphone was connected to a computer through a 
lock-in amplifier in order to record the amplitude and phase of the PAS 
signal as functions of the modulation frequency. The experimental setup 
used for the present investigation is calibrated by evaluating the thermal 
diffusivity of Al powder (Aldrich 99.999 %); the obtained value of 
0.968 ± 0.001 cm2.s-1 agrees well with earlier reported values (PERONI 
and MIRANDA, 1987).  
 In order to compare the thermal diffusivity values and to measure 
porosity in the three analyzed seal rocks, pieces of the rocks sliced 
vertically to the bedding well direction and power compacted discs were 
prepared for the PAS measurements. The vertical sliced samples were 
obtained by dry hand-sanding process, while the compacted discs were 
initially mechanical powdered (particle size of ~10 ?m) followed by 
compression using 6 tf/in2 (~90MPa). The powders had controlled 
particle size grinding using swing/disc mills (Spex Shatter Box) 
commercial machine operating during 3 min. for each sample. The 
obtained pellets (both sliced and compressed discs) were small with an 
average diameter of 10 mm. The thicknesses obtained for the vertical 
and powder compressed samples were respectively: 510 ?m and 500 ?m 
for sample SR-42; 470 ?m and 510 ?m for sample SR-47 and; 390 ?m 
and 475 ?m for sample SR-57. The PAS measurements were taken in 
the modulation frequency range of 10 to 250 Hz in order to achieve the 
thermally thick regime. Figure 4.3 shows the FESEM micrographs 
images of analyzed seal rocks (a) and the compacted powder (b) 
analyzed by PAS technique.

5. PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENTS AND PORE 
STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION IN TGS  

 In this and the following chapters the results obtained by a set of 
techniques for the pore structure characterization and the analysis of the 
permeability on tight gas sandstones are exposed. By the usage of 
distinct techniques it was possible to evaluate the benefits and 
limitations of each method and consequently obtain specific properties 
in these rocks which allow estimate permeability. The main properties 
measured in the present chapter for tight gas sandstones originating 
from dissimilar gas fields were: porosity, pore size distribution, specific 
surface area and experimental permeability. Nitrogen Gas Adsorption 
(N2GA), Mercury Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) and Pulse-Decay 
Permeability (PDP) were the techniques applied. On the other hand, 
only TGS of field A (next Chapter) were evaluated by the usage of Low 
Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LFNMR), X-ray Nano and Micro 
Computed Tomography, SEM, FESEM and XRD techniques. Also the 
prediction and simulation of permeability were performed and discussed 
for samples of field A. 

5.1. PDP analysis 
 In the two actual reservoirs (A and D) investigated in this sub-
section the local depositional and tectonic stresses add components of 
stress in distinct directions. Only samples A-12H and A-18H were plugs 
extracted from the horizontal direction to bedding field. Although we 
knew fairly the nature of in situ stresses (net stress) to the vertical 
bedding direction studies here have been performed under distinct 
hydrostatic conditions. The in situ net stress (overburden pressure) value 
for Field A was equal 27.58 MPa while for Field D it was 25.79 MPa. 
The time required before the PDP test to reach a uniform pore pressure 
on the sample confined in the core holder was about 1 to 2 hour for the 
analyzed TGS.   
5.1.1. Effect of TGS rock stress on permeability to gas 

 Nitrogen gas permeability results for different net pressures at 
constant high pore pressure (6.89 MPa inlet for all samples and 13.10 
MPa inlet only for A-17V) are shown in Figure 5.1 for the rocks of well 
A and D. Note that the denominated inlet pressure is the mean pore 
pressure performed during PDP tests. In a PDP test the measurement 
speed is roughly proportional to the mean pore test pressure, and it 
should be as high as practicable (JONES, 1997), while the net stress is

the difference between the hydrostatic confining pressure and the inlet 
pressure applied on the sample located in the core holder.

measured at Pm = 6.89 MPa, A-17V was also analyzed at Pm= 13.10 MPa.

 As one can see in Figure 5.1 for all analyzed samples under 
increasing net stress values permeability is reduced. Permeability ranges 
from about 0.02 mD to less than 0.001 mD at net stress equal 27.58 
MPa. For sample A-17V the permeability value is reduced as an average 
by 13.4% at 13.10 MPa inlet (mean pore pressure) in comparison to 6.89 
MPa inlet. All these trends agree that the analyzed TGS have a 
significant variation in the permeability values within the applied net 
stress. E.g., considering the calculated fittings of samples A-11V and A-
17V, the value for permeability at atmospheric pressure (1 atm ? 0.103 
MPa, and so without the net stress pressure effect) would be 
respectively in the order of 0.0113 and 0.078 mD. One of the main 
controlling parameters for permeability is the pore throat size (REZAEE 
et al., 2012). In many cases, the pore/pore throat radius has a greater 
effect than the porosity on the permeability (JAYA et al., 2005; 
RUSHING et al., 2008). Fatt and Davis (1952) observed that tight 
sandstones exhibit a stronger dependence on net stress pressure than 
higher permeability rocks do. Further, fractures and shale streaks have a 
strong effect on permeability reductions in tight sands (VAIRIGS et al., 
1971).  
5.1.2. Klinkenberg’ correction 

 The TGS samples were tested with 3 to 5 step mean pore 
pressures to obtain the Klinkenberg slippage factor and corrections to 
gas permeability. The results are shown in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.2. 
From the graphics plotted in Figure 5.2 one can see the agreement to 
equation (2.20) where the apparent gas permeability at low mean pore 
pressures is bigger than the Klinkenberg permeability extrapolated to an 
infinite high mean pore pressure. As one can see we investigated the gas 
slippage effects using the conventional Klinkenberg plot, i.e., the 
inverse mean pore pressure plotted against the apparent gas 
permeability. By fitting the data it was also possible to calculate the 
Klinkenberg slippage factor. Only for samples A-19V and A-12H non-
Darcy effects may be identified as deviations from the fit line trend at 
high mean pressures. However, if we consider the characteristic radius 
found in A-12H and A-19V being equal 20 and 100 nm (as it will be 
shown later in the PSD results), the nitrogen molecular mean free path 
equal 2.15 nm and apply Eq. (2.19) the values 0.0215 &amp;lt;Kn &amp;lt;0.1075 are 
found. This range of Knudsen numbers is located in the slip flow regime 
where Klinkenberg’ corrections are still valid.

 Comparing the values of the Klinkenberg’ correction factors 
found one can observe that in general the values were bigger for field D 
than for field A. This tendency supported by the Equation (2.21) can 
lead us to the conclusion that samples of field D were probably 
comprised by significant amount of very small pores, even smaller than 
the ones found on samples of field A. However we could not confirm 
this assumption since samples of field D were not available for further 
experiments realized in this thesis.

5.1.3. Steady-state versus PDP measurements 

 In order to evaluate the accuracy of pulse-decay technique 
measurements applied in the present work, results of the steady-state 
(permanent method) technique were compared with the unsteady-state 
(pulse-decay or transient method) measurements. Aiming to validate the 
comparison, each sample was tested with both techniques under the 
same net stress and using the same gas (nitrogen). For the steady-state 
and unsteady-state measurements, a Core Lab UP-400 (applicable for 
k&gt;0.001 mD) and a Core Lab PDP-200 (for 0.1 mD&gt;k&gt;0.01 ?D) were 
respectively used. The analyses were performed in four tight gas 
sandstones samples originating from gas fields A or D and in a 
calibrated pattern made of metal (pattern A). These samples were 
chosen considering their permeability range which does not surpass the 
higher and lower limit of the transient and permanent technique, 
respectively. The obtained results are shown in a log-log graphic plotted 
in Figure 5.3 (a) and (b), where all the values represent the absolute 
permeability, i.e. corrected from the Klinkenberg effect. 
 Figure 5.3 (a) shows the results for the analyzed samples under 
specific net stress pressures as described in the graphic. As it can be 
seen in this figure for the investigated samples there is a good agreement 
between the two methods within the defined permeability range as 
emphasized by the correlation line (1:1) in the graphic; the higher 
deviations shown are of samples A-19V and D-32. For sample A-19V

the unsteady-state technique gives a value 27.64 % smaller than the 
steady-state technique while for sample D-32 the value is 38.94 % 
higher. Still, this deviation found in our rocks lies within reasonable 
margins, unlike the results presented in the literature. So have 
RUSHING et al. (2004)  reported a ratio of about 8 for the two methods 
(higher for steady-state method) in the permeability range less than  
0.01 Md, while CARLES et al. (2007) presented that the permeabilities 
from unsteady-state are roughly twice the permeability from steady-
state.

 We also investigated the relation of permeability results using 
both techniques in a sample under distinct mean effective pressures, as 
shown in Figure 5.3 (b) for samples D-32 and D-50. In this situation we 
observed in both samples that in the range of higher permeabilities 
(around 0.1 mD) the unsteady-state PDP method tends to underestimate 
the values. The same happens in the lower ranges of permeabilities 
(around 0.05 mD) where in turn the conventional steady-state method 
underestimates the values. This is in complete agreement between 
limitations of each technique within the permeability ranges. As one can 
see for the middle permeability ranges (Peff =25.79 MPa) the values are 
very close. Overall we believe that the agreements found between the 
techniques corroborate that either method provides reasonable results for 
the permeability range found in the analyzed rocks. 

5.2. Results for N2GA and MICP techniques 

5.2.1. N2 isotherms 

 Nitrogen isotherms for selected TGS samples of field A, B and C 
are shown in Figure 5.4. It can be noted that the adsorption-desorption 
process is not reversible, as observed by the presence of hysteresis 
loops. Desorption hysteresis is mainly due to the presence of ink-bottle 
type pores (RUTHVEN, 1984) and is usually explained by pore 
blocking effects (GROEN et al., 2003; RAVIKOVITCH and 
NEIMARK, 2002; SING et al., 1985). Although the eleven rock 
samples differed in terms of the amount adsorbed and shape of 
hysteresis loops, the N2 isotherms obtained at 77 K were similar and fall 
within Type II from the IUPAC classification group (SING et al., 1985). 
At high relative pressures, the isotherms exhibit high adsorption, an 
indication that the rocks contain macropores not reached by N2GA 
experiments. At average relative pressures (P/Po &gt; 0.45) the curve 
exhibits a hysteresis loop indicating the multilayer range associated with 
capillary condensation in mesopores (SING et al., 1985). A feature 
common to the hysteresis loops obtained from nitrogen gas adsorption 
measurements is this closure point at similar pressures. This lower 
closure point is attributed to the surface tension of the liquid adsorbate 
reaching an unstable state at a specific pressure, influenced by the nature 
of the adsorbate at a given temperature (ECHEVERRÍA et al., 1999; 
GROEN et al., 2003; SING et al., 1985). For rocks, i.e. a realistic case 
of heterogeneous pore size distribution and interconnected pore system, 
with this forced closure of the hysteresis loop, the PSD derived from the

desorption branch is often much more affected by pore network effects. 
Thus, for PSD calculations only the adsorption branch was considered.

 As it can be seen in Figure 5.4 the rocks analyzed (a natural 
material) have a porous microstructure in which small and large pores 
are present. Thus, for TGS rocks the horizontal plateau at relative 
pressures close to 1 does not occur, as it happens for microporous or 
synthetic materials with a defined pore range. Additionally, a 
considerable increase in the gas condensed in the capillary for a small 
variation in the relative pressure is observed. TGS rocks from field A 
present an amount of adsorbed N2 between 3 and 5 cm

3/g (in STP 
conditions) while for field B these values are around 6 cm3/g. For field 
C (outcrop TGS rocks) the amount of adsorbed N2 is very dissimilar 
between the samples, varying from 4 to 18 cm3/g. Shapes of hysteresis 
loop are similar for samples belonging to the same field and fall within 
the type H3, H2 and H4 for fields A, B and C, respectively 
(BRUNAUER et al., 1940; SING et al., 1985). In the type H2 samples, 
pores with narrow necks and wider bodies (ink-bottles) can be observed; 
type H3 is associated with aggregates of plate-like particles giving rise 
to slit-shaped pores (JANSSEN et al., 2011; SING et al., 1985; WANG 
et al., 2010; YU et al., 2003) while type H4 loop is often associated with 
narrow slit-like pores, but in this case the type I isotherm character is 
indicative of microporosity (SING et al., 1985). Nevertheless, for 
natural materials, such as TGS rocks, this interpretation has to be 
considered with caution since it is subject to error. The same caution 
was recommended by CLARKSON et al. (2011) who studied also TGS 
though using USANS/SANS and gas adsorption analysis. 
5.2.2. PSDs from N2GA models 

 The pore size distributions are calculated using the BJH and 
Dollimore-Heal (DH) (DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1964; DOLLIMORE 
and HEAL, 1970) methods based on the adsorption isotherms data and 
the more recent DFT method (DO and DO, 2003; LANDERS et al., 
2013) assuming a slit-like pore geometry of carbon as a substrate and N2 
at 77 K. The calculations were performed using ASAP 2020 Software 
(ASAP 2020, 2007). The PSDs curves of cumulative pore volume 
measured using the three models are shown in Figure 5.5, with left 
column showing results for samples of field A and right column results 
from fields B and C.

Figure 5.5: Cumulative pore volumes measured from N2GA isotherms

 From the results shown in Figure 5.5, in all analyzed samples it is 
possible to observe more differences in the PSDs curves obtained by the 
DFT model, while BJH and Dollimore-Head are very similar. Recently, 
LANDERS et al. (2013) published an extensive review on the 
adsorption characterization of mesoporous and microporous materials

by using the density functional theory (DFT) methods. As they stated in 
their work, the DFT methods have found numerous applications for 
calculating pore size distributions in traditional and newly discovered 
nanoporous solids. All materials discussed in that work were either H1 
or H2 hysteresis type, within a defined pore range size in the micro- or 
mesoporous region. In summary, for the TGS analyzed rocks analyzed 
in our work we observed that the pore volumes tend to be 
underestimated when performing the DFT model, especially for the 
fields B and C. On the other hand the fact that BJH and Dollimere-Heal 
models are based on the Kelvin equation leads to the similarity of 
calculated cumulative volumes curves between these models.  
Nevertheless we only choose the BJH results to perform the PSD using 
the N2GA and MICP combination, as it will be discussed in sub-chapter 
5.2.4.   
 

5.2.3. PSDs from MICP 

 Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7 depict the PSD curves for the 
cumulative and incremental pore volumes obtained by the Washburn 
equation (3.11). The porosity conversion is displayed in Table 5.2. As 
one can see, in the three analyzed fields, the samples showed a 
significant variation in the cumulative porosity while incremental PSD 
curves are mainly bimodal with peaks differing by at least one decimal 
order. For lower porosity samples the mean PSD tends to be around 100 
Angstroms while for the others it is around 1000–10000 Å (fields A and 
B) unlike the outcrop samples (field C). E.g., sample C-51 practically 
has all pores concentrated in the region of about 100 Å. An interesting 
behavior to be observed for the MICP incremental curve is in sample C-
63: even for the lower pore sizes it was not possible to measure a 
considerable amount of porosity. In this case the usage of N2GA is of 
more use, as it will be observed in the combination of N2GA and MICP 
techniques for PSD results.

5.2.4. PSDs from N2GA and MICP combination 

 Figure 5.8 shows in detail the applied methodology for one 
sample of each analyzed TGS reservoirs.

versus PSD curves, calculated from the BJH model (Nitrogen) and the 

Washburn equation (Hg). 
 

 The main difficulty in determining the complete pore size 
distribution in low-permeability rocks is that this material can be 
comprised of a wide range of pores making the use of a single technique 
inappropriate. For this reason we combined N2GA, ideal for micro- and

mesoporous materials (GROEN et al., 2003), and MICP, one of the 
most used technique in measuring PSD in the range of meso- and 
macropores, to investigate the total pore spectrum in the studied TGS. 
The approach chosen follows the ideas exposed by a differential 
combination of the N2GA and MICP cumulative curves to find at which 
pore size the techniques should be connected (point of connection – 
POC) as described in detail elsewhere (SCHMITT et al., 2013) when 
studing seal rocks. Such approach is for the first time used in tight gas 
sandstones reservoirs.  
 Having for each rock sample the cumulative pore volume 
distribution for N2GA obtained by BJH model (Figure 5.5) and MICP 
obtained by Washburn equation (Figure 5.7), the intersection between 
the curves of the first derivative (POC) are obtained where the fluid 
variation (volume) is the same for both techniques. After calculating a 
defined POC value for each sample, thus, the sum of total pore volumes 
starting from the incremental volumes measured in the smaller pores, 
i.e., the volumes measured by the N2GA technique are continued above 
the POC by those calculated using the MICP technique. Figure 5.9, 
Figure 5.10 and Figure 5.11 show the results for samples of field A, B 
and C with total incremental pore volumes, f(x), and cumulative porosity 
plotted against the pore size diameter. Note that both the incremental 
and cumulative pore volumes have been multiplied by the apparent 
density values determined by MICP. From these figures it is possible to 
see that field C (an outcrop) is comprised by considerable amount of 
micro- and mesopores detected by N2GA technique, though porosity 
values and the peaks of incremental PSD curves between the three 
samples do not necessarily match; the same was also observed for 
samples B-36 and B-43 of field B. On the other hand for samples of 
field A very little porosity in the micro- and mesopore range was 
identified, practically all pore spectrum was already detected by MICP 
analysis. In summary, for all samples the total cumulative curves (white 
fill) have nonlinear curvatures of the convex type, with less 
augmentation at the upper extremes, showing that TGS rocks analyzed 
have predominantly small pore sizes and also that there are no larger 
pores outside the pore size range studied by N2GA and MICP. The 
results for the complete pore size distributions and also the ones 
obtained separately applying the two techniques are given in Table 5.2. 
The specific surface area results are discussed in the next chapter.

5.2.5. Specific surface area results 

 Poiseuilles’s and Carman-Kozeny’s equations showed that 
permeability is a function of porosity, pore/pore-throat radius, surface 
area, and tortuosity (JAYA et al., 2005; ZHANG, 2011). In many cases, 
the pore/pore throat radius has a greater effect than the porosity on the 
permeability (JAYA et al., 2005; RUSHING et al., 2008). Also the 
specific surface area is a property that characterizes the connectivity of 
the pore space and is therefore considered as one of the main factors 
affecting the permeability of soils and sedimentary rocks (ESEME et al., 
2012). Furthermore, the presence of pore-lining and/or pore-bridging 
clays in the rocks may reduce the permeability significantly by affecting

the pore/pore throat radius and surface area (JAYA et al., 2005). The 
results for the specific surface area (m2/g) measured for TGS rocks of 
field A, B and C are illustrated in Figure 5.12. This figure depicts the 
measurements from the N2GA data for the specific surface area 
calculated using the two models BET and Langmuir in ASAP 2020 
Software. The Langmuir model leads to higher surface areas in all 
analyzed samples. This fact is expected because the Langmuir theory is 
better at describing microporous materials exhibiting Type I isotherms 
(SING et al., 1985 classification) and so assumes adsorption limited to 
one monolayer. However as shown in Figure 5.4, most of the analyzed 
TGS samples are Type II (though with hysteresis loop) isotherms. 
 The adsorption analysis was carried out applying the BET and 
Langmuir equations for low relative pressures (0.051 &amp;lt;P/Po &amp;lt;0.22). 
This range was defined considering the linearity restricted to a limited 
part of the isotherm, usually not outside the P/Po range of 0.05-0.30 
(BRUNAUER et al., 1938; GREGG and SING, 1982) required for 
solving the mathematical approach on BET and Langmuir equations.

6. PORE STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION, MULTI-
SCALE 3D X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY AND PERMEABILITY 
PREDICTIONS 

 In this chapter we performed a study to obtain pore structure 
parameters using low-field NMR and 3D X-ray tomography where the 
PSD results were compared with those from the N2GA and MICP 
combination. Also, the measured pore structure parameters obtained by 
the applied techniques were correlated to empirical models to estimate 
or simulate permeability. Only the samples of field A were analyzed in 
this chapter. The TGS samples of field B, C and D were not available to 
the further analyses. 

6.1. Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis 
 The NMR measurements can provide information about the pore 
structure, the amount of fluid in-situ and interactions between the pore 
fluids and surface of pores, as numerous authors have explored the link 
between NMR measurements and petrophysical properties. In this sub-
chapter the results of laboratory low-field NMR measurements 
performed in mini core samples of TGS rocks will be displayed and 
evaluated. Within these results it was possible to obtain the total 
porosity and correlated the relaxation time distribution to the pore size 
distribution. Besides, the identication of the specific pore types on each 
sample and the measurement of irreductible bulk volume (BVI) and free 
fluid index (FFI) regions to find T2cutoff and T2gm values were performed 
to estimate the absolute permeability. 
6.1.1. Acquired transverse relaxation curves 

 Each low-field NMR measurement yields a T2 spectrum at 
saturated samples and these T2 spectra are shown in Figure 6.1. 
Typically T2 spectra for sandstones present unimodal (COATES et al., 
1999) or bimodal (HODGKINS and HOWARD, 1999; LIANG et al., 
2013) distributions; also REZAEE et al., (2012) working with tight gas 
sandstones found a bimodal distribution with main T2 times appearing as 
major dominant peak at T2 about 1.0 ms and a minor tail distribution of 
T2 in larger times around 10 to 40 ms, corresponding to the larger pores. 
YAO et al., (2010) studding coals observed commonly three peaks for 
the analyzed samples. HABER et al. (2010) obtained for fine sand soil a 
bimodal distribution and for two silt loams soils multimodal 
distributions. They attibute this differences to the textural composition

of each sample observing that with increasing silt and clay content, the 
T2 relaxation times desreased significantly.  
 
 

 
Figure 6.1: Amplitude normalized for transverse relaxation time (T2) 

obtained with the NMR measurements in the five TGS of well A.  

 In the present work, as it can be seen in Figure 6.1 the analyzed 
TGS shown four peaks for the transverse relaxation T2 distribution, 
strongly related to the pore structure and microestructure of analyzed 
TGS. From the PSD curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination 
it was already possible to know that the samples to be analyzed by low-
field NMR were comprised by relatively small pore sizes (~ 100 – 5000 
Å) and low porosities (~ 6 – 12%), while textural aspects related to the 
mineralogy will be discussed in section 6.3. Mini cylinders of about 
7mm x 7mm diameter and length were manufactured and considered 
representative enough  to the low-field NMR analysis. The tests were 
performed in a 23 MHz Spectrometer having a 10 mm NMR tube and 
very low intervals of spin-spin relaxation time (starting from 0.5 to 
250793 ?s), also high number of scans (255), just large enough to span 
all of the resonance lines in the spectrum. For more details see section

3.7.3. The low-field NMR results gladdened that for the five TGS 
analyzed we observed four T2 spectrum peaks identified by the 
relaxation time at 0.71–1.5 ms, 3.86–13.91 ms, 11.90–27.10 ms and 
232.47–590.07. These peaks correspond to pores&amp;lt;0.1 µm,&amp;lt;0.5 µm,&amp;lt;2 
µm and &gt;2 µm, as it will be discussed in the next sub-chapter 
considering the results obtained from the N2GA+MICP combination, 
and later also compared with the multi-scale tomography.  
 Figure 6.2 illustrates the difference of pore structures among the 
samples of Field A. In (a) one can see that the locations of each specific 
pore types (component) are very similar in all samples, while judging by 
the contribution in percentage of the components it is very distinct 
between the samples located in the upper regions (A-11V, A-12H and 
A-12V)  from the ones located in the lower regions (A-17V and A-19V) 
of field A. 

     
Figure 6.2: Pore component location (a) and contribution (b) identified 

from low-field NMR measurements in TGS of well A. 

 Low-field NMR analysis confirms the major pore size in samples 
A-11V, A-12H and A-12V occurring at about 1.0 ms. This amount of 
porosity for these samples is about 60-80% as shown in Figure 6.2(b),

Mayka Schmitt                                                             121 

and it is considered to be the clay bound water content, which is much 
higher than for samples A-17V and A-19V (30-40%). Clay volume in 
homogeneous reservoir rocks can be estimated by conventional 
methods; however, a mixture of clay minerals, quartz, and calcite 
occurring in TGS notably complicates the interpretation making the 
usage of advanced techniques such as low-field NMR necessary. 
Comparing T2 distribution of analyzed TGS, it can be seen that larger T2 
times are present only in A-17V and A-19V due to the lack of the 
macropores in the other three samples where only minor peaks or a tail 
distribution of T2 around 10 to 200 ms were found. From T2 spectrum of 
samples A-17V and A-19V one can assume that the proportion of 
macropore components is dominating. Based on these experimental 
results we can conclude that samples from upper regions in the analyzed 
field contain less volumes of pores responsible to the flow fluid in the 
reservoir (bound-fluid porosity), consequently lower permeability values 
are also expected,  as it will be verified and discussed later. As a rule, 
the T2 transverse relaxation time from rocks of field A reaches from 0.71 
to 590 ms characterizing a spectrum which proved to be tetramodal. The 
measured NMR signals correlation to the pore size distributions are 
exposed as follows. 
6.1.2. Surface relaxivity for PSD results 

 As exposed in Eq. (3.24) the measured T2 values are a function of 
the surface to volume ratio (S/V) and the surface relaxivity (?2) of the 
analyzed material. The value of ?2 can be estimated by comparing the 
NMR signal to the MICP curves (HOSSAIN et al., 2011; REZAEE et 
al., 2012). While studying petrophysical properties of greensand, 
HOSSAIN et al. (2011) found a conversion value for T2 time signal of 
20.4 ?m/s and 28.4 ?m/s for two distinct formations to generate Pc 
curves from NMR measurements; MARSCHALL et al. (1995), 
investigating carbonate rocks, arrived at a value between 4-20 ?m/s 
while for sandstones it was between 7.92-25.1 ?m/s. SONDERGELD et 
al. (2010), analyzing shale rocks, came across a surface relaxivity 
conversion of 50 ?m/s and found consistent results of body pore sizes 
distribution with SEM observations. In our study, we used the pore size 
distribution curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination to fit the 
low-field NMR T2 distributions. The best fitting was reached using a 
value of surface relaxivity equaling 30 ?m/s applied for the five 
analyzed TGS rocks. One can compare the PSD results for low-field 
NMR (Figure 6.3) and the N2GA+MICP combination (Figure 6.4).

In Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4 (a) refers to the incremental pore volumes 
while (b) is the cumulative porosity where a good match was found 
between the NMR and N2GA+MICP curves and porosity values. 
Naturally, when comparing the incremental PSD curves one can see that 
even though the spectrum’s range of pore sizes is very analogous (e.g.  
from 0.004 to 4 ?m in samples A-11V, A-17V and A-19V), the peaks 
tend to be distinct between both techniques: mainly tetramodal for low-
field NMR measurements and bimodal for N2GA+MICP results. This 
behavior can be explained pondering the principles of each technique as 
discussed in the next paragraph. 
 According to the Washburn and BJH equations utilized for the 
MICP and N2GA data calculation, at each recorded pressure a volume of 
fluid is determined and converted into a cylindrical pore volume with a 
radius n. On the other hand, the connection between NMR 
measurements and petrophysical parameters stems from the strong effect 
that the rock surface has in promoting magnetic decay of saturating 
fluids. Therefore, T2 is directly proportional to the pore size with the 
associated signal amplitude being the sum of the signal amplitudes 
arising from the fluid (hydrogen atoms in our case) in individual pores. 
Thus, the measured NMR porosity depends only on the fluid saturating 
the analyzed sample and it is the sum of connected and unconnected 
porosities. The PSD curves obtained from the N2GA+MICP 
combination (Figure 6.4) are mainly comprised by pore ranges 
measured by MICP techniques, see sub-chapter 5.2.4, Figure 5.9 and 
Table 5.2. In a MICP experiment, the effective pore throat radius is 
calculated from the Hg injection pressure, and the injected Hg volume 
gives the corresponding volume of pores that can be accessed by that 
level of capillary pressure (or less). In this manner, Hg injection is really 
giving a pore throat size distribution, but at each limiting pore throat 
size, the actual volume of Hg that enters the sample is the volume of all 
associated larger pore bodies and pore throats (ink-bottle effect). It is 
generally thought that, from the original deposition environment and the 
diagenesis processes influencing the development of the rocks which 
will establish a reservoir, there will be a strong relationship between the 
existence of pore bodies and pore throats. A textural and structural 
evaluation in the five TGS rocks of field A will be done further in sub-
chapter 6.3, as well as the quantification of pore bodies and pore throats 
using nano- and microCT (Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21 “b” left side).   
As a consequence, MICP experiments performed in rocks having such a 
high amount of ink-bottle pore types will bring this influence in the

results, whereas NMR measurements do not bring this effect turning to 
be an effective reliable method for obtaining PSD curves having both 
opened (connected) and closed porosity. 
6.1.3. Measuring T2cutoff and T2gm for permeability predictions 

 In section 2.5.3 it was stated that to predict the permeability from 
NMR results using Coates model, Eq. (2.31), and Mean-T2 model, Eq. 
(2.32), the values of T2cutoff and T2gm need to be calculated. To obtain the 
T2gm in the present work we consider merely the mean value under the 
T2 signal distributions. As a result, the free fluid index (FFI) and 
irreductible bulk volume (BVI) have roughly the same values. 
Progressing, to obtain the T2cutoff value, various works have been 
reported in the literature. E.g., SONDERGELD et al. (2010), studying 
shale rocks, found most of the signal in the T2 distribution occurring 
below the 3 ms cutoff for “clay bound” water (or simple FFI). 
MARSHALL et al. (1995) reported that a typical value for T2cutoff in 
sandstones is 33 ms and that the cutoff T2 correlates with rock type as 
defined by lithology and, especially, by the well of origin. HOSSAIN et 
al. (2011) defined T2cutoff as the relaxation time at the point where the 
cumulative porosity of the fully saturated sample equals the irreducible 
water saturation. So the cumulative porosity over the range T2&gt;T2cutoff 
was the macro-porosity and below the range T2&lt;T2cutoff was the micro-
porosity with T2cutoff equal 3.68 ms and 5.21 ms for two distinct 
greensand formations. Since we performed low-field NMR only for 
cleaned samples 100% saturated with 10% KCl brine, our task was to 
define the region representing the clay bond water, which defines de FFI 
and BVI regions in our samples. As already discussed in section 6.1.1 
we considered the first peak in the lower relaxation times as being the 
BVI volume whereas the values to the higher relaxation times were 
considered to be the FFI volumes. Succeeding, the FFI and BVI values 
were parameters employed to predict permeability using the COATES et 
al. (1999) model. Table 6.1 shows the obtained T2gm and T2cutoff and 
respective FFI and BVI values for the five TGS of well A. All these 
parameters were used to predict permeability which will be also 
compared with the experimental PDP permeability, as will discussed in 
sub-chapter 6.4.1. The proceeding on choosing the T2gm and T2cutoff 
values for samples A-12V, A-12H and A-17V is shown in Figure 6.5.

6.2. Results for the 3D X-ray nano- and microCT 
 The 3D high definition analyses were performed for two TGS 
samples of field A using nano- and microCT techniques. Figure 6.6 
shows the analyzed samples and one projection of all acquired images. 
The criteria to choose samples A-11V and A-17V were based on the 
porosity and pore size range: as we want to evaluate (in three 
dimensions) the differences on the pore structures of low permeability 
TGS of field A, we decided to take samples showing as much as 
possible distinct PSD and porosity values, though having pore size 
ranges comprised in the resolution of the used X-ray CT equipment. 
 

 
Figure 6.6: Macro and CT images of TGS A-11V and A-17V. Cores of 3.5 
cm x 3.5 cm were used for extraction of the smaller specimens: 7 mm x 7 
mm for microCT analysis of 2000 projections and 0.7 ?m res. (a); 2 mm x 
2mm for microCT analysis of 1600 projections and 0.3 ?m res. (b) and 0.1 
mm x 0.1 mm for nanoCT analysis of 1600 projections and 0.064 ?m res. 
(c). The reconstructed CT slices (a, b and c) show the distribution of the 
solid and void structures present in the TGS with black being the pores.

 The main 3D pore structure information aimed at was: porosity, 
pore size distribution, pore shape and tortuosity, connectivity, 
orientation and specific surface area. Having the porosity and PSD 
curves obtained from the combination of N2GA and MICP techniques, 
as exposed in Figure 5.9, we selected then samples A-11V and A-17V 
for the nano- and microCT analyses. Figure 6.6 shows the macro and 
micro images of samples A-11V (left column) and A-17V (right 
column). In this figure it is possible to see (i) the original core samples 
from were pulse-decay permeability analyses were performed and slices 
for extraction of sub-samples were cut; (ii) mini core samples used for 
microCT acquisition and (iii) ultra mini core samples used for nanoCT 
analysis. (a), (b) and (c) are X-ray CT reconstructed slices for Res1, 
Res2 and Res3, with pixel sizes exposed in Table 4.2. From the image 
(c) acquired with the nanotomography, it is possible to see for both 
rocks the presence of spheric and unconnected pores located inside of 
the matrix grains. 
6.2.1. 3D image processing and segmentation 

 The key for capturing image features that are relevant for 
simulations is good image segmentation. Because we are interested 
mainly in the pore structure analysis, the filters to remove impulse noise 
were applied based on pore phase segmentation. A filter transforms an 
image to emphasize or stress a specific feature of its structure (AVIZO, 
2012). Filtering techniques are often useful to extract desired 
information from input data or simply to improve the appearance of the 
input data. Considering that our interest is related mainly with the study 
of pore morphology and pore sizes ranging below the micrometer 
resolution, we need the application of an ideal filter to remove the noise 
from the acquired 3D images and to enhance contrast between solid and 
voids. A common problem in filtering theory is to estimate a signal 
mixed with noise. Usually a solution is the moving average, where the 
value of each pixel is replaced by the average of its neighbors. This is 
based on the assumption that short ranged variations result from noise so 
the filtered output can then be viewed as the main trend of the function 
(ZHANG, et al., 2013; AVIZO, 2012).  
 For all acquired resolutions using X-ray nano- and microCT, the 
Non-Local Means (NLM) filter was the best choice for the 3D image 
pre-processing. The NLM filter replaces a considered pixel by the 
weighted mean of all the pixels in the whole image or the surrounding 
neighborhoods (ZHANG, et al., 2013). Only for Res1 (in both samples 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
128              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

A-11V and A-17V) two additional filters were performed in the 
following order: non-local means (NLM) ? Despeckle ? Median. For 
a better understanding on the theory and applications concerning to the 
NLM, Despeckle and Median filtering algorithms, see the related 
literature (LOIZOU and PATTCHIS, 2008; DANDEKAR, 2008; 
IQBAL et al., 2013; ZHANG et al., 2013). Figure 6.7 shows the usage 
of additional filters in 3D images of sample A-17V Res1. 
 

 
Figure 6.7: Distinct filters used in the pre-processing of the 3D image 
acquired for sample A-17V in the Res 1. The value of histogram-based 

thresholding for the pore segmentation was 130 for both (a) and (b).

 Considerable efforts were taken on finding the best sequence of 
filters in the pre-processing analysis of Res1, since the acquired images 
were comprised of very small artifacts corrupting an accurate 
segmentation even after applying the NLM filter. As one can see in 
Figure 6.7 (a) the black spots on the segmentation process are identified 
as mismatch pores, which are in truth image noise. Both (a) and (b) pore 
segmentations were done using the same value of histogram-based 
thresholding at the 16 bits image. In (a) the data set shows results of 
super-estimated pore segmentation inside of grains while in (b) the data 
set shows less noise. We believe that the main reasons for the 
occurrence of very small artifacts on 3D images of Res1 are related to 
the usage of such a high voltage energy (80 keV) and to the sample size 
(7 mm2) which might have been still too big for resolution of 0.7 ?m.  
 After choosing an adequate filter, among a wide range of 
techniques we used histogram-based iterative thresholding to reach a 
best-fit segmentation. Thresholding becomes a simple but effective tool 
to separate objects from the gray levels of the pixels belonging to the 
background where the gray-level samples are clustered in two parts as 
background and foreground (object), or alternately are modeled as a 
mixture of two Gaussians (SEZGIN and SANKUR, 2004). The 
foreground is represented by gray-level 0, that is, black and the 
background by the highest luminance is 255 in 8-bit images. The output 
of the thresholding operation is a binary image from which the rock pore 
structure can be extracted, quantified and simulated. All filtering and 
thresholding steps were executed using Avizo 7.1 Software. The quality 
control taken during the segmentation process was based on the 
histogram-based thresholding, 2D and 3D pore segmentation views as 
shown in Figure 6.8.

 A three-dimensional pore-network can be used to scan topology 
and pore space factors (tortuosity, shape, orientation, etc), in which the 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
132              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

effective pore radius are distributed according to a given pore size 
distribution (PSD). Also, the connectivity of the pores, thickness of the 
network, and the effect of pore blockage can be observed from the pore-
network extraction. There are innumerous theories and methods 
concerning the pore-network extraction to understand porous materials 
behaviors, based on adsorption concepts (CAI et al., 2007) or on micro-
computerized-tomography images (DONG and BLUNT, 2009). In the 
present work topological and equivalent resistor network (skeleton) 
methods were performed for the segmented pore-network, extracted 
using Avizo Software. For the three acquired resolutions both figures 
(Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10) show the 3D microstructure images (a) and 
the 3D topological pore structure (b). As already explained above for all 
investigated resolutions the reconstructed 3D images were optimized by 
removing impulse noise through the application of filtering procedures, 
followed by thresholding, segmentation, pore morphology extraction 
and finally quantification analyses.  
 From the extraction of the segmented 3D pore structure based in 
a gray level histogram (Figure 6.9(b) and Figure 6.10(b)), as one can 
see, depending on the pixel resolution taken for the X-ray Nano- and 
MicroCT acquisition and also on the nature of the sample’s pore system, 
the pore structure can be comprised of a connected or unconnected pore 
network. In these figures connected pores share a unique color while 
unconnected pores have distinct colors. For sample A-11V, e. g., only in 
Res2 it was possible to observe a connected pore network which 
represents 97.53% of the pore phase. On the other hand for sample A-
17V the connected pore network could be observed in all resolutions 
and it represents for Res1, Res2 and Res3, respectively, 96.78%, 
96.24% and 98.80% of the porosity measured in each resolution. The 
connected network observed for A-17V in Res1 and Res2 can be 
explained considering that this sample is constituted by a higher amount 
of pores bigger in body and throat sizes therefore a smaller resolution 
(Res1) was already able to detect the entire network while not detecting 
the connections in sample A-11V. Whereas for Res3, since the size of 
the samples to be analyzed ranges in the order of 100 ?m in length and 
even smaller in diameter, it makes it hard to draw any conclusion about 
the pore network; a single pore can already make up a good portion of 
the sample, as it happened in sample A-17V, compare Figure 6.10(b).

6.2.2.1. Generating 3D sub-samples 

 Intending to extract the statistical information from the pore 
network, i. e. pore size distribution (frequency and volume) and 
coordination number, it is necessary to separate the pore bodies from 
their throats. There are different methods that have been presented in the 
literature to fulfill this task. In this work we initially tried to apply the 
watershed algorithm, a tool belonging to the Avizo Fire Software. As it 
will be discussed in the next section, we did not obtain good results for 
the analyzed samples, leading us to choose other methods: 

(vii) Mathematical morphology using Imago 2.3.40 Software 
(IMAGO), see related theory (MARQUES FILHO and 
VIEIRA NETO, 1999; HAI et al., 2001; MOREIRA; 
2013); 

(viii) Generation of an equivalent resistor network (skeleton) 
using C3DE Software (CUNHA, 2012). 

For this task we choose for each resolution one region of interest (ROI) 
to be analyzed considering the criteria that (i) for the pore size 
distribution analysis we intended to investigate the same amount of 
pixels in all resolutions measured in each sample (and as big as 
possible), and (ii) the softwares used to generate the 3D images for the 
mathematical morphology and skeleton only accepts cubic shapes with 
identical x, y and z axis.

 In this matter, the three resolutions of samples A-11V and A-17V 
analyzed by X-ray Nano- and MicroCT are constituted by a fixed 
amount of pixels (600 x 600 x 600) therefore varying in size with a 
dissimilar investigated portion of the sample volume. Figure 6.11 shows 
the 2D cross-sections for each generated sub-sample for the three 
resolutions chosen and named as Res1, Res2 and Res3. As laid out 
before in Table 4.2 the three resolutions are just slightly different for 
Sample A-11V and A-17V. For sample A-11V, e. g., Res1 shows a pixel 
size of 0.75 ?m investigating a volume of  9.11E+07 ?m3; Res2 displays 
a pixel size of 0.35 ?m and a volume of 9.26E+06 ?m3 and Res3 has a 
pixel size of 0.064 ?m leading to a volume of  5.66E+04 ?m3. Just to 
emphasize the differences between the investigated 3D volumes, Res2 
would fit 10 times in to Res1, and it would take about 1600 distinct 
measurements with Res3 to cover the same volume as one shot with 
Res1. Therefore depending on the pore size more defined resolutions 
(such as Res3) might not present representative results of pore sizes 
distribution. 

6.2.2.2. Autocorrelation function of 3D sub-samples 

 Intending to verify how representative the three resolutions of 
analyzed samples are from the original rock medium, we applied the 
autocorrelation function to the porosity. The autocorrelation function 
properties are defined as statistical averages of a binary phase function 
Z(x) that is equal to unity if a point x in space is occupied by void and 
zero otherwise (ADLER et al., 1990):

The porosity ? and autocorrelation function C(?) can be easily measured 
on 2D or 3D binary micrographs of segmented pore space as the first 
two moments of the binary phase function ( )Z x  (CUNHA, 2012): 

   ( )Z x? = ,  

   ( ) ( ) ( )C u Z x Z x u= + . (6.2) 
The autocorrelation function gives the probability of two points 
separated by a distance u belong to the same image phase, in this case, 
?. The vector ? is called the displacement factor of image phase or 
simply Lag. From Eq. (6.2) it is possible to assume that:

Taken that from the definition of ( )Z x , Eq.(6.1), 2( ) ( )Z x Z x= . 
This is also the maximal value that C (Eq. (6.2) can assume because 
with the increasing of u , the product of the functions ( )Z x  and 

( )Z x u+  (which can only be 0 and 1) do not reach the value ?.  

2. When u ? ? , 

In this case there is no correlation between the points in the same 
image phase; therefore the functions are statistically independent. 
This is then the minimum value of autocorrelation function C(x).  
For a “statistically homogeneous” porous medium, ? is a constant 
and C(u) is only a function of the lag vector u, i.e., they are 
independent of the location vector x (LIANG et. al., 2000). 

 
 Having the 3D sub-samples images (ROI = cubic 600 pixels) of 
Res1, Res2 and Res3 from samples A-11V and A-17V as shown in 
Figure 6.11, where the white phase represents pore, we extracted the 
autocorrelation functions using Imago 2.3.40 Software. The volumes of 
image resolutions (Res1, Res2 and Res3) have a porosity of 3.22%, 
5.77% and 5.40% for sample A-11V and, 9.62%, 9.38% and 43.17% for 
sample A-17V. The results comparing the target autocorrelation 
functions are shown in Figure 6.12 where the minimum of the curves 
represent ?2. From this figure it is possible to see that for both samples 
Res1 and Res2 exhibit a long spatial correlation and revel close 
agreement suggesting that the low-order statistical properties (porosity 
and autocorrelation function) contain sufficient information to reproduce 
the real rock porous media. The representative elementary volume 
(REV), defined as the smallest volume of a material that captures the 
global characteristics (in our case porosity), is even smaller than the 
analyzed ROI for Res1 and Res2. On the other hand the spatial 
correlation of Res3, for both samples is very short. One can note that for 
A-17V Res3 the low level of correlation curve has a much higher value

due to the high porosity comprised by this analyzed ROI. Considering 
that some loss of geometric and topological information may be 
expected to result at higher resolutions (such as Res3), even though the 
statistical information remains intact (IONNIDIS and CHATZIS, 2000) 
we judge that Res3 of sample A-17V does not represent the referred 
rock porous medium leading us to abandon this result. Although the 
importance of having structural information of the smaller pores in such 
accurate scale as Res3 is crucial in the study of unconventional 
reservoirs, attributing reproducibility to this resolution might be 
dangerous since it does not contain sufficient statistical information.

6.2.2.3. Applying watershed algorithm 

 The watershed algorithm from Avizo Fire Software, was 
performed in the resolution Res2 for sample A-11V and Res1 for sample 
A-17 to characterize pore shape, tortuosity and orientations; only for 
sample A-17V (Res1) it was used to obtain pore size distribution 
separating in particles the main connected pore network. The principle 
of watershed algorithm is to compute watershed lines on the gray-level 
image for black objects or on the inverted image for white objects (pores 
in our investigation). It is a combination of the fast watershed, distance 
and numerical reconstruction algorithms. It detects surfaces that separate 
agglomerated particles and these surfaces are subtracted from the initial 
image. When performing watershed algorithm analysis the meaningful 
parameter to be chosen is the “depth of valley” or contrast factor.  
 

 
Figure 6.13: Principles of watershed and distance maps algorithms 

(AVIZO® 7, 2012; RUSS, 2007). 

In Figure 6.13(a) a short explanation about this principle is exposed and 
so smaller the contrast factor is chosen to be (lower levels of flooding)

more separated the pore-network will be and smaller pores will be 
identified. Simply put, the contrast factor is the parameter deciding how 
distinct the separation of two or more pores has to be in order to be 
counted individually. Thus, without the watershed command the 3D 
segmented image is comprised by one or several connected networks 
considered as singular big pores only and a high amount of smaller 
unconnected pores (see the results of “NoBin” for A-17V in Figure 6.14 
and Figure 6.15). By applying the command the connected network 
structures will be broken into a certain amount of separated pore 
networks or simple pores, depending on the chosen contrast factor. 
Smaller the contrast factor (here also named “Bin”) is more connected 
pores will be considered individually and higher the amount of 
separated pore structures will be. Figure 6.15 compares the results 
obtained for incremental and cumulative pore volumes (a) and 
frequency (b) for sample A-17V (Res1) using contrast factors equal 1 
and 10 and original (NoBin) pore structure. In Figure 6.14 one can 
visualize in 3D and 2D the results of pore separation after applying Bin1 
and Bin2 (as well as NoBin) for the analyzed ROI = 10003 pixels.

cumulative (red) volumes and the (b) column the frequency of pore 
sizes. After measuring the pore volumes in the 3D image, the program 
transforms every isolated porous object into a regular sphere displaying 
the equivalent diameter in the graph for pore size evaluation purposes. 
The calculation performed for the equivalent diameter shown in Figure 
6.15 is:

An interesting observation can be made when comparing the frequencies 
of pore sizes against the pore volumes for each contrast factor. Without 
applying the watershed algorithm, though the pore sizes have a Gaussian 
distribution, the cumulative pore volume is almost entirely made up by a 
single connected network which is transformed into one big sphere with 
the diameter of 422 ?m. After the application of the watershed algorithm 
with the contrast factor 10 (Bin10) the pore volumes show a Gaussian 
distribution fitting the corresponding frequencies, but the overall 
porosity is considerably reduced. With the contrast factor 1 the porosity 
is further reduced while the frequency of pore sizes is not anymore 
distributed in a Gaussian shape. 
 Besides being a simple and straightforward tool for pore 
separation, the watershed algorithm in particular with non-convex 
shapes may miss or separate too much (AVIZO® 7). We observed that 
for obtaining pore size distributions on the analyzed tight gas sandstones 
(comprised of constricted and heterogeneous pore’s structure shapes), 
one negative point was found: the amount of porosity decreases 
considerably from 9.92% in “NoBin” to 2.54% in “Bin1” and 4.10% in 
“Bin10”, thought the shape of incremental curve in Bin1 (bimodal) 
looks acceptable. However for obtaining the pore size distributions in all 
resolutions for the analyzed samples we decided to use only the 
mathematical morphology (Imago) and the equivalent resistor network 
(C3DE program) algorithms. The results are discussed following. 

6.2.2.4. Mathematical morphology and equivalent resistor networks 

 Both mathematical morphology (MM) and equivalent resistor 
network (Skeleton) models were used to calculate pore size distributions 
for two analyzed samples in all resolutions as shown in Figure 6.11. 
Only Res3 for sample A-17V was not analyzed which besides not being 
possible to generate the skeleton due to the limitations of the computer 
in process extremely high porosity in the ROI, was considerate not 
representative enough for the PSD analysis.  
 The approach for the mathematical morphology analysis by 
Imago 2.3.40 Software consists in the basic idea of taking binary pore 
morphology to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, 
drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the

3D image. This simple "probe" is called structuring element, and is itself 
a subset of the chosen space or grid. The structuring element of 
tridimensional dominium used in Imago was the D345 for a 3D image 
(MOREIRA, 2013). The upper part of Figure 6.16 illustrates the 
obtained results for pore size distributions of individual scales of 
samples A-11V and A-17V, using mathematical morphology (Imago). 
  The other approach used is based on the equivalent resistor 
network (skeleton) model and was calculated using C3DE program 
(DONG and BLUNT, 2009; CUNHA, 2012). The principle is the 
implementation of a fully parallel thinning algorithm for 3D that 
extracts the smaller axis converted in equivalent cylinders volume 
(throats) which are connected to bigger spaces then converted in 
equivalent inscribed spheres volumes (pore space). Thereby this model 
has the advantage of calculating independently the pore and throat 
volumes. Figure 6.17 exposes the results for the generated skeletons 
using C3DE program in the 6003 volumes pixels, while the lower part of 
Figure 6.16 illustrates the results for pore size distributions of each 
individual scales of samples A-11V and A-17V.

 Comparing the results between PSD curves from the 
mathematical morphology and generated skeleton (Figure 6.16) one can 
see that (with the exception of Res3 in sample A-11V) for all acquired 
resolutions the shapes of the curves tend to be similar for both methods, 
though MM identifies a bigger amount of pore volume in the smaller

pore ranges. This fact is predictable remembering the principles related 
to each of the two used methods. Also the experimental results, as 
shown in Figure 6.4(a), for PSD measured by the N2GA+MICP 
combination (see samples A-11V and A-17V) indicate a much lower 
range of pore sizes, bellow to 1 ?m.  Nevertheless we decided to 
investigate the results given by both methods. One advantage of the 
generated skeleton method is that besides calculating the fraction of pore 
sizes it also gives the frequency in number (n) of each pore and throat 
size genereted (see Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19). As a result it allows 
the operateor identify which pore and throat sizes are more 
representative in each analyzed scale resolution. So we propose the 
integration of 3D multi-scale PSD X-ray tomography by usage of the 
frequency curves. Also, the PSD results given by the MM method 
(which considers only pore fraction volumes) were used to integrate the 
multi-scale approach developed by MANTOVANI (2013), which in turn 
was compared to the obtained results, as will be presented as follows. 
  

6.2.3. PSD from multi-scale 3D X-ray tomography 

6.2.3.1. Combination of pore size frequencies  

 Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19 show the results of PSD for A-11V 
and A-17V samples, obtained from the pore-network extraction using 
C3DE program. As one can see both pore’s body and throat volumes are 
displayed with (a), (b) and (c) rows showing the incremental, the 
cumulative and the frequency volumes, all against pore radius. From 
these graphics one can see (for each resolution) that the ranges of pore 
sizes for the higher peaks in the curves of incremental pore volumes and 
pore frequencies do not necessary match. This is one indication that 
when analyzing PSD from image analysis the curve of pore size 
frequencies besides showing information about pore fractions, gives an 
idea of which pore classes are more representative in the analyzed 
sample volume. Therefore we suggest that for evaluating PSD from 
acquired 3D images data of pore size frequencies and volume fractions 
(incremental volume) needs to be displayed and evaluated together. 
 Having all the incremental pore volumes in the distinct 
resolutions, the question arises how to determine which scale (and range 
in this specific scale) should be included in the final combined 3D 
multi-scale PSD having distinct incremental pore volumes from each 
resolution (scale). As a general approach, the frequency (n) of pore sizes 
was taken into consideration to evaluate which pore class was best 



 

_____________________________________________________________

represented in which resolution. Since the size of the analyzed volume 
differs from resolution to resolution, a comparison of the absolute 
frequency (n) would not lead to the desired parameter. Therefore, the 
frequency (n) was transformed for each resolution into a percentage of 
the total amount of pores identified (see Appendix A, the column 
frequency (%)). The highest percentage of frequency for each pore class 
identifies the resolution that represents that pore class best and therefore 
its value of the incremental pore volume was taken into the calculation 
of the overall result. Naturally, the combination of frequencies are made 
up from the most accurate resolutions measured in the analyzed sample 
(in our work Res3 for A-11V and Res2 for A-17V) considering that this 
scale has the smallest pore sizes measured in more details. As an 
additional safeguard, it was defined to control the results by cross-
comparing the incremental values directly against each other; e.g., in 
Res1 analyzing the throats of sample A-11V the pore class with the 
highest percentage of frequency (2 ?m) an incremental porosity of 
(63.01%), while Res2 had an incremental porosity of 38.86%. In this 
case the pore size class (2 ?m) was taken from Res2 since it was the 
highest frequency percentage in that scale although lower then the 
63.01% in scale Res1. In such an occasion, if the 3D images do not 
present something unusual, the general rule is overridden. All 
calculation using the frequencial pore size combination obtained by the 
skeleton algorithm in C3DE software for samples A-11V and A-17V, 
the sub-volumes were the ones showed in Figure 6.17.

morphology (Imago) and equivalent resistor (C3DE); (d) of 
N2GA+MICP combination and low-field NMR.  
 Comparing all results of incremental PSD curves obtained by  
X-ray 3D multi-scale with N2GA+MICP combination and low-field 
NMR results, one can see that the spectrum of pores size distribution 
obtained by X-ray is shifted right toward bigger pores. When the pore 
network extraction is performed using mathematical morphology model 
that effect is a bit lessened but still present. On the other hand the results 
of porosity (shown by the cumulative pore volumes) were closer to the 
experimental N2GA+MICP and low-field NMR values when the 
combination of frequencies was performed, still overestimated even 
with the lack of small pores range which were not acquired in the 
measured 3D X-ray resolutions. PSD from the X-ray CT images is 
supposed to reflect the ‘‘real’’ pore geometry as X-ray CT images 
include both connected and isolated pores. However, because of the 
resolution limitation, the PSD from this method must be limited too. 
 One advantage on obtaining the curves of frequential number of 
pores sizes accounts to help the operator on choosing the range of pores 
in each scale to be more representative in the combined multi-scale 3D 
X-ray PSD. Finally, the results of integrating PSD from multi-scale 3D 
X-ray tomography indicate the quality of the imaging method allowing 
one to probe the spatial distribution of the macro and part of the micro 
porosity contributions across distinct scale resolution. As already stated 
in the literature review, the effective porosity in tight gas sandstones is 
typically much lower than the total porosity because of diagenesis. The 
type and magnitude of diagenesis governs the connectivity of the 
primary porosity. Unlike conventional sandstone reservoirs that are 
characterized mostly by a primary intergranular porosity system, TGS 
may exhibit several other types of porosity - including both primary and 
secondary inter-granular porosity, detrital matrix porosity, micro-
porosity, and grain fracture porosity (RUSHING et al., 2008). The 
identification of such smaller pores is still a challenge in the 3D X-ray 
tomography technology.

6.2.4. Quantifying pore’s geometry properties 

 Key issues concerning tight gas reservoirs are related to their 
heterogeneities, tortuosity and hydraulic connectivity. Knowledge of a 
pore’s reservoir geometry, axis orientations, and body connectedness is 
vital for meaningful reservoir modeling. The complex interconnection of 
multilateral and heterogeneous sand bodies is a result of lateral 
migration in conjunction with vertical stacking of fluid-based channels 
disposed in the depositional environment of the reservoir. The oil and 
gas industry has long recognized the importance of pore structures (i.e., 
pore and pore throat dimensions, geometry, size, distribution, etc.) on 
fluid flow and storage properties in all types of porous media. 
Understanding the pore structure and its properties is probably even 
more critical in tight gas sandstones since diagenesis often modifies the 
original pore structure and reduces the average pore throat diameter, 
typically causing an increase in both tortuosity and the number of 
isolated and/or disconnected pores (RUSHING et al., 2008). Figure 6.22 
illustrates the shapes and sizes of some isolated pore and the connected 
pore network observed in the TGS sample A-17V Res1. Following 
important pore characteristics related to the 3D pore medium of tight gas 
sandstones were measured and discussed.

Axes are given in ?m. 

6.2.4.1. Determination of pore connectivity 

 Pore connectivity is another critical property of the pore structure 
which defines how well the pores are connected and therefore will affect 
the local fluid flow (PENG et al., 2012). The connectivity is a measure 
of the number of independent paths between two points in the pore 
space phase and, hence, of the degree of interconnectedness of the pores.

The permeability of sandstones is a direct function of the size and 
number of the interconnected pores (DULLIEN, 1992). In the last 
century innumerous researches (e. g., BARRETT and YUST, 1970; LIN 
and COHEN, 1982) performed metallographic serial sectioning of 
samples on porous media and have formed the basis of a number of pore 
structures studies. Most of the studies dealt with the problem of edge 
effects in the construction of the branch-node chart (treatment of the 2D 
stacking data). Nowadays with the use of X-ray CT techniques, the 
evaluation of the 3D connectivity of pore structures leads to more 
accurate results. The average values (Table 6.2) and distribution of pore 
connectivity (Figure 6.23) were calculated using the equivalent resistor 
network generated by C3DE program. As one can see for the higher 
resolutions on each sample the connectivity distribution is increased to 
the lower values indicating that the analyzed volume is comprised by a 
considerable amount of either isolated or low connected pores, while A-
11V Res2 and A-17V Res1 show a Gaussian type curve. On Table 6.2 
besides the average connectivity (coordination) number the volume-
weighted average is also displayed. From this value we can determine 
the relative importance of neighboring pores related to the pore volume. 
As one can see, for both samples A-11V and A-17V, in Res1 and Res2 
the averages as volume-weighted get bigger, indicating that the bigger 
pores are more connected. On the other hand for Res3 (sample A-11V) 
the bigger pores are the ones more isolated.

6.2.4.2. Tortuosity and shape factor measurements 

  Tortuosity (?) is one of the most widely studied petrophysical 
parameters yet it is not very well understood (ZIARANI and 
AGUILERA, 2012). As already previously discussed in this work, the 
tortuosity and shape factor (Fo) of a porous medium are fundamental 
properties that account for the sinusoidal flow path through its structure 
and can be empirical related to permeability estimation (CARMAN, 
1937). The tortuosity and shape factors were measured on samples A-
11V and A-17V in terms of path length and geometrical definitions from 
the 3D images measured by X-ray nano- and microCT. The calculations 
for the tortuosity were already described in section 2.3.3, while the 
obtained shape factor is equal to (AWCOCK and AWCOCK, 1995):

where A is the area of segmented object and PCrofton is its Crofton 
perimeter as defined by DO CARMO (1976). The analyses were 
performed using Avizo Fire Software on the 3D segmented pore 
structure of Res1, Res2 and Res3 (Figure 6.9(b) and Figure 6.10(b)) and 
the results are shown in Figure 6.24. For both tortuosity and shape factor 
properties, the values found in the sample A-11V were bigger than in A-
17V. From the N2GA, MICP, low-field NMR and 3D X-ray CT 
analyses we can judge that sample A-11V is comprised by grain textures 
and sizes much finer than A-17V (this conclusion is also supported in 
the subsequent chapter) which are mainly responsible for the 
heterogeneities in the pore network and decreasing of the analyzed 
parameters. Furthermore, studying mudrocks, YANG and APLIN 
(2007) fitted experimentally a value for Fo(?)

2 equal to 1000, confirming 
that smaller pores usually tend to be more tortuous. The measured 
tortuosity and shape factors were used in the Kozeny-Carman equation 
to estimate permeability in the analyzed TGS field A

6.2.4.3. Surface area measurements 

 Because of the complexities in the microstructure of natural rocks 
the surface area obtained depends very strongly on the method used to 
make the measurement. Surface areas estimated by the BET gas 
adsorption method frequently differ by several orders of magnitude from 
those obtained by image analysis of the same rocks (KLEINBERG, 
1996). Measurements differ primarily due to the presence of clay, which 
has a huge surface area that is included in BET gas adsorption 
measurements but missed by pore image analysis. A further problem is 
that pore sizes in natural rocks range over several orders of magnitude. 
Figure 6.25 shows the specific surface area results obtained from 3D X-
ray CT analyses measured in the pore networks by Avizo (Figure 6.8 
and Figure 6.9) and C3DE (Figure 6.17) programs.  
 The BET method generated the largest total surface area for both 
rocks (A-11V = 0.76 m2/g, A-17V = 1.00 m2/g). Specific surface area 
estimated with X-ray CT images was calculated as the measured total 
surface area with (Avizo or C3DE) divided by the sample mass, which 
was in turn calculated as the volume times the bulk density (A-11V = 
2.66 g/cm3 and A-17V = 2.65 g/cm3) measured by MICP experiments. 
There may be certain scale effects on bulk density which will result in

different specific surface area. However, the values estimated from the 
high- and low-resolutions X-ray CT images are at least one order-
magnitude smaller than the BET measured. This indicates the 
significance of small pores in the pore surface area for analyzed TGS.

6.2.4.4. Aspect ratio distribution, phi and theta orientations 

 The pore aspect ratio spectrum may be simplified into round 
pores and cracks. The latter refers to the pores with aspect ratio equal to 
or less than 0.1 while 1 would be a perfect sphere. The amount of cracks 
and round pores are related to lithologic factors; clay contents effect on 
the elastic moduli of rocks may be ascribed to its role in changing the 
pore aspect ratio spectrum (ZHANG and BENTLEY, 2003). XU and 
WHITE (1995) set the pore aspect ratio to be 0.15 for sand-related pores 
and 0.04 for clay-related pores, attributing velocity reduction in clay-
bearing rocks chiefly to flatter pores in clay. The results of the 
distribution of the pore aspect ratio spectra, one important pore structure 
property, was already employed to interpret the elastic properties in 
sandstones, e.g. (ZHANG and BENTLEY, 2003). Figure 6.26 shows

Mayka Schmitt                                                             155 

obtained results for the pore aspect ratios distributions obtained in the 
connected pore network (NoBin) and after pore separation (Bin1 more 
separations than Bin10) in samples A-11V and A-17V. As one can see 
the results indicate that rock A-11V is comprised by more compacted 
(narrow) pores than A-17V is.  
 

 
Figure 6.26: Results of aspect ratio for samples A-11V and A-17V. 

 To evaluate Phi and Theta Orientation of pores, the 
interconnected pore structure needs to be separated. Having all particles 
(pores) separated as individual “bins” (where Bin1 contains smaller 
pores sizes then Bin10), the characteristic orientation of each pore can 
be measured. This evaluation of preferential pore orientation can give an 
indicative into which direction in the analyzed field the hydrocarbons 
prospection should be easier, therefore optimal. As the name already 
defines, investigated samples A-11V and A-17V were plugs extracted 
vertically to the bedding field direction, so all experimental permeability 
PDP measurements were performed in the Z-axis direction. Thereby, we 
also respect the vertical direction being Z-axis in all mini-cylinders 
manufactured for X-ray CT scan and analysis. The command 
“orientation phi” and “orientation theta” from Avizo Fire Software 
where applied being the orientation phi the angle between orientation of 
the particle and the Z-axis in degrees between [0,+90] and orientation

theta the angle between the projection of the orientation of the particle 
on the XY plane and X-axis in degrees between [-180,+180]. Figure 
6.27 shows the obtained results for the pore preferential orientations 
found in both A-11V Res2 and A-17V Res3, while Figure 6.28 
illustrates the spatial position for the main orientations phi (90o) and 
theta (0o and 110o) obtained. As one can see, any considerable effect on 
the orientation was observed within pore size decreasing (Bin10 to 
Bin1). On the other hand, the results indicate that in both samples the 
pores tend to be organized more to the X- or Y-axis directions, tough in 
sample A-11V this characteristic is even more representative (observe 
the counts of frequency in Figure 6.27). If these results would be 
transposed to the macro-scale of the reservoir one could affirm that the 
horizontal hydrocarbons prospection would be favorable in the 
horizontal bedding direction.

6.3. Mineralogical characterization, textural and structural 
aspects for TGS field A 

 As structural phases and compositional analysis can be used for 
interpretation of the N2GA, MICP, LFNMR, nano- and microCT 
measurements, both XRD and scanning electron microscopy analysis 
were performed on samples of field A. These analyses were also used to 
help define mineralogical controls on permeability variations within 
depth in field A. The TGS samples were collected in location within 
4944 to 5040 meters depth along field A. Considering the SEM, FESEM 
and XRD analyses performed in these samples we observed that the 
Brazilian field studied is well defined by a significant change in 
lithologies. As stated before, the samples shown considerable change in 
porosity and permeability, the most obvious change is the presence of 
calcite in the sample located in the upper part of the field. For all 
samples we observed that framework grains are mainly plagioclase 
feldspar with sub-dominat components of quartz, alkali feldspar and

clay minerals. The main clays found were biotite, chlorite and 
muscovite. The textural, mineralogical and structural results are exposed 
as follows.   
6.3.1. XRD analysis 

 Figure 6.29 shows the recorded XRD patterns corresponding to 
the tight gas sandstones originating from field A, as described in Table 
4.1. The phase identification and quantitative analysis were performed 
based on reference intensity ratios values from database ICDD 
(International Center for Diffraction Data) using the Diffract.Suite EVA 
software. In Figure 6.30 it is possible to visualize the results of the 
quantitative analysis for TGS of field A, also described in Table 6.3.

 By comparing the patterns it is possible to see that they have 
mainly the same peaks associated with the albite, quartz and microcline 
phases but they are well different from the extreme samples located in 
the upper (A-11V) and bottom (A-19V) areas in the well. From the 
differences between the analyzed samples in Figure 6.29, the intensities 
of XRD patterns show that A-11V and A-12V (from the upper regions) 
have nucleated phases of calcite and clinochlore which get much smaller 
in the samples A-17V and A-19V. On the other hand for A-12V and A-
17V it is possible to see nucleated phase of sanidine and A-17V and A-
19V nucleated phases of biotite (black mica), siderophyllite (rare type of 
mica) and muscovite (white mica) besides an increase of intensity in the 
peak of quartz. One can see that the analyzed samples exhibit a 
succession of particular mineral phases of stable elements, being more 
similar as closer located to each other through the depths in the analyzed 
well. For sample A-11V the high intensity of calcite peak in the mainly 
difference observed between the samples. From the XRD patterns one 
can assume that the calcite phase from the samples in deeper regions

practically disappears because it was already either dissolved or 
precipitated by groundwater (telodiagenesis). When conditions are right 
for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing 
rock grains together or it can fill fractures. When conditions are right for 
dissolution, the removal of calcite can dramatically increase the porosity 
and permeability of the rock. A better understanding will be discussed 
further in the work by the SEM and FESEM analysis.

6.3.2. SEM and FESEM analyses 

 Stable backscattered electron (BSE) signals from scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) were used to generate X-ray mapping 
images of the studied TGS samples from field A. The average BSE gray 
value of every region is directly related to a mineral of unique average 
atomic number. Therefore from this analysis most important minerals 
present in the analyzed samples and its organization could be 
differentiated. Although the BSE mode was used in all five samples 
from field A to create chemical maps, only samples A-11V and A-17V 
located in the top and bottom of field, are shown here. Figure 6.31 
shows the obtained results with right column exhibiting each mineral 
grain delineated from BSE image and left column displaying the 
elements discriminated using simple X-ray mapping.

As one can see for the analyzed samples BSE images provide details of 
mineral intergrowth and very fine pore-structures. Each scanned BSE 
image area (~ 800 ?m2) returned relative abundance maps of Si, Al, Na, 
K, Ca, O, Fe and Mg for both samples. The textural relationships 
between various grains and pores, amount of Ca, Fe, Mg and Mn and 
organization of minerals, though, is considerable distinct between A-
11V and A-17V samples with two of the most striking and distinct 
features observed being:  

- Sample A-11 - presence of phases constituted by Ca and Mg 
elements, mainly calcite and wollastonite identified by XDR 
measurements,  suggesting that the pores once present in this 
sample are now filled by calcite overgrowth; 

- Sample A-17V - even being comprised by considerable 
amount of pores (and less compressed then in A-11V) this 
sample shows Fe and Mg rich clay minerals (illite, chlorite, 
and illite/chlorite mixed layers) lining/filling/bridging pore. 

 According to Soeder and Chowdiah (1990), tight gas sandstones 
are divided into three types based on their pore geometry. This 
classification emphasizes the effects of the original deposition 
environment and the invasive influence of diagenesis in the 
development of the reservoir. Type I sandstones have open intergranular 
pores whose pore throats are blocked by authigenic5 clay minerals; Type 
II have intergranular pores that have largely been occluded by 
authigenic cements (mainly quartz and calcite) and reduced to narrow 
slots that connect large secondary pores formed by grain dissolution. 
Type III sandstones have their intergranular volume filled by dentrital 
clay matrix and have mainly microporosity. It is known in the literature 
that Type II reservoirs are by far the most common in commercial tight 
gas fields (LERCHE and NOETH, 2004). For rocks of field A we can 
assume that sample A-11V tends to follow the classification as Type II, 
Samples A-12H and A-12V Type III, while samples A-17V and A-19V 
showed more microstruture similarities to be of Type I.  

                                                        
5 Authigenic clay minerals form mainly during diagenesis, catagenesis, and 
metagenesis (SARKISYAN, 1970). Authigenic clays can occur as pore-
fillings, pore-bridges or pore-linings and as complex combinations of these 
three forms. The various clay morphologies produce pore-systems with 
large surface areas and numerous micropores, and the overall effect is to 
reduce reservoir quality (BROWN, 1985).

Mayka Schmitt                                                             163 

 According to Rushing et al. (2008) important forms of diagenesis 
(in order of frequency of occurrence and severity) are: mechanical 
compaction, cementation from quartz overgrowths, calcite cementation, 
grain-coating/pore lining clay development, grain dissolution, and 
ankerite cementation. Only the last form was not observed in the TGS of 
field A. The enhanced level of compaction is most easily identified by 
the ductile grain deformation and elongate grain contacts. Grain 
deformation is recognized by argillaceous rock fragments that are 
squeezed into the adjacent primary pore space and effectively 
eliminating those pores. The occurrence of this phenomenon appears to 
be stronger for sample A-17V then in A-11V. This fact would be 
expected since massive calcite cementation (as one can see occurring in 
sample A-11V, Figure 6.33 and Figure 6.34) ceases the effect of 
mechanical compaction (UMAR et al., 2011). Calcite cementation with 
significant pore volume losses appear to be restricted more to the upper 
regions in field A. In these regions it appears that quartz cementation, in 
the form of overgrowths, is extensive in the sandstones with limited 
intergranular clay (A-11V and A-12V). The overgrowth crystals 
developing on adjacent grains tend to coalesce and eventually link, 
thereby occluding the intergranular pores destroying the primary pore 
system (RUSHING et al., 2008).  
 Figure 6.32 and Figure 6.33 illustrate the field emission scanning 
electron photomicrographs for rocks A-11V, A-12V, A-17V and A-19V, 
fractured and polished samples, respectively. In these figures it can be 
seen that for samples A-17V and A-19V considerable amounts of 
diagenetic chlorite, chayesite and illite are present filling quartz-
cemented walls, occurring primarily as thin coatings on portions of the 
grain surfaces. We could judge that a portion of the matrix clay has been 
recrystallized changing its morphology for these two higher porosity 
rocks, while for samples A-11V and A-12V (lower porosity samples) 
the matrix clay appears to have less recrystallization. For the rocks A-
11V and A-12V it is also observed that the intergranular pore structure 
is more occluded (lacking even small open apertures) and secondary 
pore space is calcite filled (A-11V) or not representative visible (A-
12V). Figure 6.34 elucidates in 3D the interaction of pore and calcite 
phases plus its quantification for two chosen distinct ROIs in sample A-
11V. In both ROIs the amount of calcite is much higher than porosity. 
For ROI x=y=z = 450 pixels, a big amount of porosity was intentionally 
taken to better visualize the pore-calcite interaction in sample A-11V.

 Overall, one can see that the analyzed samples displayed 
important information about structural, mineralogical and textural 
organization in field A which appear to be highly heterogenic within 
depth. Additionally the mainly observed features (calcite cementation 
and diagenetic chlorite and illite) contribute to the decreasing of 
permeability and porosity values in varied regions in the studied 
reservoir. Calcite cement frequently seals (degrades) porosity and it is 
usually found in sediments near the surface where meteoric water may 
displace original marine pore water, resulting in distinct types of 
cements. Most calcite present in upper part of the field A has been 
disappeared through the increasing of depth. It was observed that the 
decrease of calcite content reflected in this field higher porosity and 
permeability values as obtained from the petrophysical analysis.

6.4. Empirical permeability results 
 To describe the transport mechanism in ultra-tight porous media 
more accurately, a combination of the processes Knudsen diffusion, slip 
flow and adsorption/desorption is required (DARABI et al., 2012). In 
addition, the effect of pore-surface roughness is one example of local 
heterogeneity on the pore surface and it can account in the permeability 
results (COPPENS 1999; COPPENS and DAMMERS, 2006). 
Increasing surface roughness leads to an increase in residence time of 
molecules in porous media and a decrease in Knudsen diffusivity. Pore 
dimension fractal (Df) is a quantitative measure of surface roughness 
that varies between 2 and 3, representing a smooth surface and a space-
filling surface, respectively (COPPENS and DAMMERS, 2006). 
Considering the characteristic radius found in TGS samples of field A

and the N2 molecular mean free path (2.15 nm), the Knudsen number 
was found to be 0.0215 &amp;lt;Kn &amp;lt;0.1075, a range located in the slip flow 
regime, therefore, Klinkenberg’ corrections were applied in the 
measured PDP permeability. Also, the pore-surface roughness and local 
heterogeneities were observed in the analyzed TGS rocks allowing a 
better understanding on the permeability results.  
 A number of permeability prediction tools were used in this 
chapter to estimate absolute permeability in the five samples of well A. 
Each applied correlation was already discussed in section 2.5, whilst a 
brief explanation upon permeability simulations in 3D nano- and 
microCT reconstructions is exposed in 3.6.5. To evaluate the predicted 
and simulated permeabilities, PDP results were set as a basis.  Figure 
6.35 shows the permeability-porosity relation of investigated TGS, with 
permeability and porosity measured by PDP technique (after 
Klinkenberg’ correction) and N2GA+MICP combination.  

 
Figure 6.35: Log plot of permeability versus porosity of samples from well 

A. Correlation is given by R2 = 0.9339 

In the graphic above, a direct tendency of more porous samples having 
higher permeability values is shown. Exclusively sample A-12H does 
not really follow this trend; despite being the less porous sample it 
displayed a higher permeability value than A-12V, originating exactly 
from the same field region but plugged in a distinct well bedding 
direction. This behavior can be understood by the horizontal direction to 
the well bedding taken for the plug sample A-12H used in the PDP 
experiments. This horizontal direction corresponds to our 3D coordinate

6.2.4.4 and displayed in Figure 6.27, the pore bodies present on samples 
of field A (A-11V and A-17V) have a preferential orientation to the X- 
and Y-axis. As a consequence, one can expect a favored fluid flow in 
the horizontal bedding direction and so the increase of permeability 
values. 
 If a sandstone has only moderate amount of cementing material, 
permeability can be correlated directly with grain size. On the other 
hand, if a formation has about the same grain size but varying amount of 
cements (our case), then a direct relation between porosity and 
permeability has been claimed. In general, however, just a simple 
measure of either grain size or porosity will not prove to be a reliable 
guide to the permeability of sandstones (DULLIEN, 1992). For tight gas 
sandstones the rule is not different, as we observed for the samples 
originating from the same well studied in the present work, the 
experimental PDP values of permeability varied from 0.0004 to 0.034 
mD. Porosities of studied tight gas sandstones are almost entirely a 
function of the kind of cementing material between the sand grains, clay 
bordering pore walls and the extent to larger grains. From the standpoint 
of geological processes, two main reasons account for loss of porosity 
and consequently permeability. The first is cementation by calcite, silica 
and other minerals introduced into the rock by circulating ground water. 
The second is compaction that squeezes fine-grained matrix material 
into inter-connected larger grains by grain-boundary solutions (ink-
bottle pore type) at points of higher stress. As reported by Dullien 
(1992), the porosity of sandstones tends to diminish systematically with 
depth and the amount of fluids in storage, though it was the complete 
opposite for the five analyzed samples of field A. Within a depth of 
about 100 meters (see Table 4.1) indeed significant differences were 
observed in the microstructure of the sample resulting in differences of 
permeability of at least three decimal orders.  
 In this part of the thesis we investigate the prediction of intrinsic 
permeability using models stated in the literature for low-permeability 
(or conventional reservoir) rocks and making use of the pore structure 
parameters measured for the TGS rocks. Also the simulated 
permeability from 3D reconstructed medium was performed using 
Lattice-Boltzmann method and the Darcy’ law flow through the 
generated equivalent resistor obtained by the C3DE program. The 
simulated permeability was executed only in the Z-axis direction of the 
manufactured nano- and microCT mini-plugs as being the vertical 
direction to the well bedding of plugs used in the PDP experiments (A-

investigated for the calculations of permeability correlations exploited in 
this chapter. Table 6.4 summarizes the best results obtained from each 
model by handling distinct pore microstructure parameter applied to our

6.4.1. Permeability from the empirical correlations 

 The figure above depicts comparisons between the permeability 
results obtained in the experimental PDP tests and the models from 
capillary pressure curves, fine-grained rocks and low-field NMR curves 
for the samples A-11V, A-12H, A-12V, A-17V and A-19V. If the 
agreement is perfect the data points will fall exactly on the diagonal line 
plotted in the graph. As can be seen, the values obtained with the models 
based in the capillary pressure curves and from NMR measurements in 
closed symbols tend to be higher then the measured PDP permeability. 
These results were calculated using mainly the parameters values 
suggested in the literature for sandstones. Calculations performed using 
calibration through measured PDP permeability are presented by the 
open symbols. 

6.4.1.1. Results based on the capillary pressure curves 

 For the three permeability correlations already discussed in 
section 2.5.1, Winland-Pittman, Aguilera and Katz-Thompson models, 
the data resulting from the PSD curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP 
combination was applied. Table 6.5 displays this data while the 
formation factor (F) was already displayed in Table 6.4 and is a result 
from the 3D X-ray CT measurements of tortuosity and total porosity 
obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination. Only for samples A-11V 
and A-17V tortusoity was measured. For samples A-12H and A-12V 
these values were considered to be the same as for A-11V and for A-
19V the same for A-17V.

(Winland-Pittman and Aguilera models) were higher than the measured

results obtained using the PDP technique. A better agreement for the 
Winland-Pittman and Aguilera models in the analyzed TGS of field A 
was found when the pore radius corresponding to the 70% fluid 
saturation, r70, is applied. For the Katz-Thompson equation, the smallest 
throat at the percolation threshold, lc, equal the inflection point from the 
PSD saturation curve also gived reasonable results when compared with 
the PDP results. This agreement was better especially for samples A-
11V and A-17V which had the tortuosity value to calculate formation 
factor, as exposed in Eq. (2.26), measured from the 3D X-ray CT. 

6.4.1.2. Kozeny-Carman, Pape et al (1999) and Series-Parallel models 

 Figure 6.36(b) depicts the results for the permeability models in 
fine-grained rocks as described in section 2.5.2. The dataset for the 
calculations were defined based on the values of porosity, PSD and 
specific surface area, So, calculated by the N2GA+MICP combination 
(So only by N2GA technique, BET theory), shown in Table 5.2, and the 
values of tortuosity and shape factor calculated by 3D X-ray CT, 
exposed in Table 6.4. As can be seen from the comparison between the 
experimental and estimated permeability values, the Kozeny-Carman 
equation shows the best results whereas the values predicted by Pape et 
al. and Series-Parallel models tend to be slightly lower than the 
measured results obtained using the PDP-200. Nonetheless, the results 
of the fully empirical models analyzed in this section were all within the 
same magnitude as the PDP experimental results. We consider that these 
results for the TGS rocks of field A provide reasonable evidence of the 
validity of the K-C, Pape et al. (1999) and S-P approaches in these 
rocks. The best estimation reached by the K-C model could be attributed 
to the fact that this model considers effects besides the porosity, like the 
tortuosity, shape factor and So, which were properly measured for the 
analyzed rocks in this work. By the FESEM and PSD curves we could 
subdivide the TGS rocks of field A in two main regions having similar 
microstructure/petrophysical properties: the upper region (samples A-
11V, A-12H and A-12V) and the lower region (A-17V and A-19V). 
Therefore, in the K-C model we used the so called K-C constant ( 2?oF ) 
calculated by the X-ray CT analysis for samples A-11V and A-17V, 
equal to 121 and 17.8 for samples located in the upper and lower regions 
of field A, respectively. The same procedure of establishing two distinct 
regions from the analyzed samples of field A was also applied to 
calculate the pore geometry parameters related to the NMR models,

balancing the ability to meaningfully estimate the properties involved in 
the distinct rocks regions found in this field. 

6.4.1.3. Coates 1999 and Mean-T2 models from low-field NMR results 

 The theoretical basis about the Coates 1999 and the Mean-T2 
models for permeability estimation using NMR measurements was 
given in sub-chapter 2.5.3. Figure 6.36 (c) shows the comparison 
between the estimated and measured permeability results. The 
calculations concerning the T2cutoff and T2gm values were already 
performed and discussed in 6.1.3; Table 6.6 shows the porosity and the 
calibrated pore geometric constants, C and b, from low-field NMR 
measurements. Both models used in this chapter can only be as accurate 
and precise as the constant is chosen. In the case of the Coates model the 
literature suggests a value of 10 for the constant C. With this value and 
using T2cutoff  = 33 ms (from the literature in sandstones) or our measured 
values (right column in Table 6.1) the prediction for permeability leads 
to higher values than the ones measured by PDP-200, see orange and 
green full circles in Figure 6.36 (c). If the experimental PDP values are 
in turn used to first calculate a more refined value for C for the two field 
regions in the analyzed TGS rocks, which would be C = 21.57 for the 
upper regions and C = 37.93 for the lower regions, we can obtain much 
more accurate predictions (see open circles in Figure 6.36 (c)). The 
refined constant is based on the average of the individual values of C 
when inserting the experimental permeability values into the Coates 
equation. Note though, that in order to performe it you first need to 
characterize well the rock you want to analyze and you need up front a 
refined value for C from previous studies for that same type of rock, as 
the analyses performed here by PDP technique. The same proceeding 
was applied to the Mean-T2 model. With the literature suggestion for b 
equal 4 we receive mixed results for the permeability prediction but all 
in a reasonable range to the measured permeability. The calculation of a 
refined constant based on the experimental PDP results lead us to the 
value of b = 20.26 for rocks located in the upper regions and b = 0.79 
for rocks from the lower regions. As can be seen in Table 6.6 the 
individual values of constant b differed considerably between the 
samples analyzed while the individual C values were not far from the 
average of 28. This is explained since b is a parameter depending from 
the porosity and the permeability formation while C is a parameter of 
pore geometry.

6.4.2. Results for simulation of single-phase flow 

 A microstructure defined by a digital image is already discretized 
and lends itself immediately to numerical computation of many 
properties (KNACKSTEDT et al., 2006). In this subsection we show the 
results obtained of the single-phase permeability on samples, A-11V and 
A-17V, based on the numerical Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) 
(MARTYS and CHEN, 1996; DOS SANTOS et al., 2005; BAKER et 
al., 2012) and applying Darcy’s law in the pore equivalent resistor 
network (skeleton) extracted using the C3DE program (CUNHA, 2012) 
as shown in Figure 6.17. Simulations using the LBM were performed in 
a subset of 6003 pixels for sample A-11V Res2 (Figure 6.37(a)) and in 
two subsets from distinct regions of sample A-17V Res1 with 10003 
pixels each (Figure 6.37(b)). The results of simulated permeability are 
shown in Table 6.7.  
 From the results with gas nitrogen passing through a network of 
pore equivalent resistor (C3DE), one can see that permeability 
simulation varies from distinct sample axis, being bigger especially in 
the X-axis direction. These results are in perfect agreement to the pore 
preferential orientation found and discussed in Figure 6.27. Another 
interesting result is observed by the comparison of Res1 and Res2 in 
rock A-17V. One can see that Res1 shows a much defined axis direction 
(X) where the permeability is bigger, while in Res2 the values tend to be 
close. These results suggest that simulated permeability is being highly 
influenced by the volume of sample analyzed (i.e. Res1 was about 10 
times bigger than Res2, so more representative although with low 
resolution).  



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
Mayka Schmitt                                                             175 

 However in the investigated TGS, from both pore equivalent 
resistor (C3DE) and LB methods, simulation of permeability on the 
resolvable connected porosity did not provide reliable results compared 
to the experimental PDP values. Recently, working with LB method, 
BAI et al. (2010) demonstrated by systematically varying sample size 
and resolution, that calculated permeabilities for samples with porosity 
lower than 30% decreased by about two orders of magnitude with a five 
times increased sample size at full tomographic resolution (4.76 ?m per 
voxel/lattice node). Low-porosity samples were especially sensitive to 
simulation resolution, with the permeability increasing by at least one 
order of magnitude for every halving of the grid resolution. Furthermore 
an important factor to be considered when comparing experimental PDP 
results and simulated permeability is the pressure condition applied on 
the sample to be analyzed. When the sample is scanned and X-ray CT 
data are collected, there is only the effect of atmospheric pressure acting 
while in a PDP experiments a net stress pressure is applied. To see the 
influence on the permeability results with the confining pressure in the 
studied TGS, compare Figure 5.1.  
 Giving the importance of microporosity to the overall properties 
in the analyzed tight gas sandstones (compare N2GA+MICP curves, 
Figure 5.9, also FESEM micrographics, Figure 6.32) there is a need to 
undertake a study considering the permeability in the 3D medium 
incorporating both the resolvable porosity (Figure 6.37) and the 
microporosity out of investigated resolution, as suggested already by 
Knacksted et al. (2006), studying carbonates. However for 
unconventional reservoir rocks such as TGS this task is still unsolved in 
3D pore network simulations once that even for the resolution of  
utilized nanoCT (0.064 ?m) the complete range of smaller pore found in 
such rocks (down to 0.01 ?m) is not reached. Besides, the presence of 
clay minerals (i.e. chlorite/ biotite/ chamosite/ illite), K-mineral 
alterations and grains/pore compaction observed by the SEM/FESEM 
analyses, play a significant role of micro-barriers inhibiting the fluid 
circulation. These textures could not be completely observed in our 3D 
images.

7. USAGE OF PHOTOACOUSTIC TECHNIQUE TO 
CHARACTERIZE THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY AND 
POROSITY IN SEAL ROCKS 

 Measurement of thermal diffusivity of rocks is important to 
understand the thermal properties and the characteristics of heat flow 
into the formation of oil or gas. The sealing capacity is controlled either 
by the rock microstructure or by chemical interactions between minerals 
and the permeating fluid (DESBOIS and URAI, 2009). In this chapter 
we describe the results obtained from the PAS method applied in three 
seal rocks originated from distinct oil and gas wells in Brazil. Each of 
the rock samples were prepared for the PAS analysis as a disc sample 
sliced in the vertical direction of well bedding and as a manufactured 
disc sample after rock grinding and compaction. Both samples (disc and 
powder compressed) were taken from cleanned core rock samples. The 
inetention of preparing a powder compressed sample is to verify the 
values of termal diffusivity only of the matrix rock without the influene 
of porosity. Our main task was to verify how thermal properties of seal 
rocks are related to the porosity since it is known that cap rocks can act 
as excellent insulators over oil and gas reservoirs, aiding the formation 
and thermal maturation of petroleum (FENG et al., 2013). We also 
propose a model to correlate measured thermal diffusivity (TD) to 
porosity values. The results show that thermal diffusivity decline as 
apparent porosity of the samples decreases. 

7.1. PAS results for signal phase and amplitude 
 As previously discussed, the characteristic frequency 

( )2cf l? ?= characterizes the transition from the thermally thin 
regime ( )cf f&amp;lt;to the thermally thick regime ( )cf f&gt; . In this work, 
for the analyzed seal rocks, which are a type of shale having 
heterogeneous pore structure and mixtures of muscovite, illite, quartz 
and clays in its matrix, we considered an average value of thermal 
diffusivity of 0.019 cm2/s (GUIMARÃES et al., 2013) and by 
considering that the largest thickness of the samples was 510 ?m, the 
smallest characteristic frequency of 2, 33cf ? Hz was calculated. 
Therefore, in order to achieve the thermally thick regime, for the 
analyzed seal rocks the PAS data was measured in the 10-250 Hz 
modulation frequency range.

According to Figure 7.1(a), the signal amplitudes of all samples are 
similar regardless of being vertical or powder samples, while for Figure 
7.1(b), only the phases of vertical sliced samples are similar but a 
discontinuity at 10 Hz is seen in the phase of SR-57. The phase behavior 
of powder compresses samples SR-42 and SR-47 is similar. The 
procedure described in the section 3.8 for obtaining the thermal 
diffusivity of each process to the PAS signal amplitude was used as 
discussed following. 

7.2. PAS mechanisms and thermal diffusivity results 
 Figure 7.2 shows PAS signal and PAS signal phase versus the 
square root modulation frequency of the intraband nonradiative 
thermalization (thermal diffusion) mechanism contribution observed for 
the analyzed seal rocks. As one can see only SR-42 and SR-57 presented 
this main contribution to the PAS signal and phase. For the SR-42 
vertical sample, the slope of the dash lines fitted between 10 and 17 Hz 
were a = 0.30308 (from the signal amplitude data) and a = 0.30472 
(from phase data), whereas for the SR-42 powder compressed sample, 
the slope of the straight lines fitted between 8 and 15 Hz were a = 
0.32457 (from the signal amplitude data) and a = 0.31684 (from phase 
data).  For the SR-57 powder compressed sample, the slope of the 
straight lines fitted between 1 and 6 Hz were a = 0.65639 (from the 
signal amplitude data) and a = 0.64758 (from phase data). Using the 
expression s sa l ? ?=  and considering the average value of a from 
signal and phase data, the calculated thermal diffusivity values were 
?s=0.08848 cm

2/s and ?s=0.07636 cm
2/s for SR-42 vertical and powder 

compressed, respectively, and ?s=0.01667 cm
2/s for SR-57 powder 

compressed. Due to the phase inversion observed in Figure 7.1 
equations (3.29) and (3.30) were applied to obtain the thermal 
diffusivity of the SR-57 vertical sample from the thermal diffusion 
mechanism contribution. The signal phase shows a discontinuity at 10 
Hz, which is a fingerprint of the contribution of thermal diffusion to the 
PAS signal and refers to the signal phase inversion of 180o. The integer 
number n is related to the discontinuity points due to the tan(x) 
dependence of the phase. Use of the value 10 Hz in expression (3.30) 
and n=0 (first discontinuity) leads to the value of fc=4.053 Hz and 
?s=0.01937 cm

2/s.

PAS signal amplitude change with modulation as 9816.0?f  and 9952.0?f  
between 19-33 Hz and 21-29 Hz, respectively. These changes are close 
to 0.1?f , indicating the presence of thermoelastic bending (TB)

All results obtained from the thermal diffusion (TD) or thermoelastic 
bending (TB) mechanisms in PAS measurements and the porosity and 
density of the analyzed seal rocks can be seen in Table 7.1. 

7.3. Results of thermal diffusivity and predicted porosity 
 The results show that independently of the well of origin for all 
seal rocks grinded and compressed to 6 tf/in2 samples there was a small 
reduction in the thermal diffusivity when compared to the values 
obtained from the original rocks (vertical sliced pellets). On the other 
hand, compared to each other the three samples present different thermal 
diffusivity values increasing from the sample SR-57 to SR-47 (similar to 
SR-42). These results suggest that these samples originating from 
distinct wells are constituted of specific microstructure organizations 
and crystalline and amorphous mineralogical phases which lead to rather 
different thermal properties, especially in sample SR-57 from which 
very low diffusivity values were obtained (in the order of 0.02 cm2/s). 
 Firstly, to discuss the reduction of the thermal diffusivity values 
of the powder compressed samples compared to the vertical sliced 
pellets we will base our argumentation towards a macroscopic property 
description of a disordered media having two main volume phases: 
pores and solid matrix. By considering the vertical sliced sample (an 
original piece of clean and dry seal rock) as a two-phase network in 
which pores are randomly embedded in a solid matrix, the thermal 
diffusivity of the specimen can be given as: 

          m p m p px? ? ?+ ? =  (7.1) 
where ?m+p and ?m are the thermal diffusivity of the vertical sample 
comprised by solid matrix and pores and the powder compressed 
samples containing only the solid matrix. ?p is the thermal diffusivity of 
the pores network in this case considered to be filled by air and equal to 
0.19 cm2/s; xp finally is the amount of pores embedded in the solid 
matrix of vertical sliced sample, i.e. the porosity value. Using Eq. (7.1), 
one can obtain the porosity of SR-42 equal 6.38% from the thermal 
diffusion results and 9.05% from the thermal bending; for sample SR-47 
a value of 6.00% was found from the thermal bending and for sample 
SR-57 a value of 1.42% was calculated. These values of porosity were 
compared with the results obtained in the same rock samples using the 
combination of nitrogen gas adsorption and mercury injection capillary 
porosimetry techniques in a previous work (SCHMITT, 2009) as can be 
seen in Figure 7.5. In this previous work it was concluded that much of

the observed variations in permeability of analyzed seal rocks could be 
attributed to variations in porosity. However shale (as seal rocks) also 
exhibit wide ranges in fabric and clay content. Anisotropy in transport 
properties may be pronounced in clay-bearing and soils which revel 
grain shape alignments (KWON et al., 2004). The mineralogy, texture 
and grains orientation are discussed in the next paragraph.  Table 7.1 
shows the comparison of porosity results presenting a good agreement 
between the techniques. Therefore it can be concluded that the PAS 
technique proves to be an alternative method for the calculation of 
porosity in seal rocks.

 As one can see from Figure 7.6, Figure 7.7 and Table 7.2, the 
microstructure of each of the three seal rocks is comprised by numerous 
mineralogical phase structures. By comparing the identification and the 
quantification of the phase structures one can see that mostly, each of 
them is present in all the three wells although the amounts differ 
slightly. However, by comparing the recorded XRD diffraction patterns 
in Figure 7.6 important characteristics can be observed: all the peaks 
associated with the phases in SR-57 are sharper then in SR-42 and SR-
47 indicating a better crystallinity in this sample; The XRD patterns of 
the SR-42 and SR-47 samples are very similar and show peaks with an 
enlarged base, suggesting that these samples present a bigger amount of 
disorder such as amorphous phases like pores or clays (FARRAND and 
SINGER, 1990) then sample SR-57. 
 There are numerous theoretical and experimental studies in the 
literature showing that the thermal conductivity is proportional to 
thermal diffusivity, see Eq. (3.25), and lessens with decreasing grain 
size (ZHONG and WANG, 2006; BODAPATI et al., 2006). In the 
present study this fact was observed for sample SR-57 having a smaller 
thermal diffusivity then SR-42 and SR-47. The microstructure of seal 



 

_____________________________________________________________ 
188              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) 

rock samples is constituted by the crystalline and amorphous 
mineralogical phases. We believe that the amorphous phase (like pores 
and hardly crystalline clays) located among the grain matrix particles, 
has a considerable influence in the thermal diffusivity value. Some 
materials, including rocks, exhibit macroscopic thermal anisotropy; for 
example, different numerical values for thermal conductivity result from 
measurements across different pairs of opposing faces on a sample of 
the material (pellets with micro thickness in the micrometer order in our 
case). The simplest type of thermal anisotropy, common in rocks, arises 
when the material has a layered structure at fine scales. The thermal 
conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the layering is generally 
lower than the conductivity in any direction parallel to the layering 
(CHEKHONIN, et al., 2012). This layered structure is strongly present 
in sample SR-57 as can be seen in the FESEM analysis on fractured 
Figure 7.8(a) and polished samples Figure 7.8(b). For samples SR-42 
and SR-47 this characteristic of layered structures is much smaller and 
the matrix grains are much bigger compared to SR-57. Besides that, 
samples SR-42 and SR-47 show some sort of fractures/pores that are not 
aligned to the bedding direction (see column b). Due to a chemical and 
microstructural disorder present in the amorphous SR-42 and SR-47 
phases the pores and clays appeared among the rock matrix particles 
might create temperature gradients inside the sample. These temperature 
gradients are responsible for the predominance of the thermoelastic 
bending process in the PAS signal amplitude and phase signals observed 
for samples SR42 and SR-47. The small difference between the thermal 
diffusivity values for these two samples even originating from distinct 
wells suggests that the amorphous phases and lattice mismatch (a result 
of the coexistence of the numerous crystalline phases from the rock 
matrix) have similar effects on the propagation of thermal waves in the 
samples SR-42 and SR-47. On the other hand, the lesser amount of 
amorphous phase component present in the sample SR-57 and the 
smaller grain sizes with preferential direction (vertical to bedding) are 
the mainly responsible for the reduction of the thermal diffusivity of this 
well formation.

8. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 The distribution of pores and its morphologies in sedimentary 
rocks such as tight gas sandstones and seal rocks play essential roles in 
characterizing gas and oil reservoirs to predict the flux transport inside 
these underground deposits. This work focused on the pore-structure 
characterization of low-permeability TGS and seal rocks, providing an 
overview of techniques and methodologies which can be applied to 
investigate the geological evolution and properties of the reservoirs 
systems reflected mainly by their pore organization. 
 Understanding that considerable volumes of hydrocarbons are 
trapped in tight gas reservoirs onshore/offshore basins, some attempts 
have been made to find an explanation of the stress-dependence porosity 
and permeability behavior of these rocks. TGS represent one type of gas 
accumulations generally referred to as unconventional reservoirs due to 
their significantly lower permeability and the attendant operational 
challenges for achieving viable production rates and recovery volumes. 
In order to relate the overall flow behavior to the average geometrical 
characteristics of the rocks, we must consider carefully certain statistical 
aspects of the microscopic flow through individual pores or regions of 
inhomogeneity. In the first two chapters of this thesis we obtained by a 
compendium of techniques results for the pore structure characterization 
and the analysis of the petrophysical properties on tight gas sandstones. 
By the usage of distinct techniques it was possible to evaluate the 
benefits and limitations of each method and consequently obtain specific 
properties in these rocks which allowed us to estimate and simulate 
permeability. 
 TGS originating from distinct gas fields were investigated by 
PDP, N2GA and MICP techniques to measure experimentally 
permeability and pore structure information. The device used for the 
measurements of permeability by the transient method was a CoreLab 
PDP-200 inserting nitrogen gas through the bedding plane (in the 
horizontal or vertical directions) into samples of TGS plugs. Thus the 
dependence of transverse flow permeability could be investigated and 
also the Klinkenberg’ corrections could be obtained. For such low-
permeability rocks the slip flow regime was present and Klinkenberg’ 
corrections lead us to reach the absolute permeability values of analyzed 
samples. Also the PDP equipment had its accuracy validated by 
comparing results of steady-state versus pulse-decay permeability. By 
evaluating the permeability values of these rocks under compression and

decreasing porosity level by increasing the confining pressure in the 
core holder, we found it to be smaller, regarding the absolute values of 
permeability, as higher the value of the applied net stress (dependence 
on porosity and clay content). The two analyzed samples of field D 
showed a dependence of 0.80330.2341k P?=  and 0.72510.0854k P?= . 
Samples of field A having considerable amount of calcite were fitted by 
the equations 0.0018 ( ) 0.0073k Ln P= ? +  and 0.42330.0032k P?= , while 
sample A-17V having the pores filled by clay content showed a 
dependence of 0.35910.0347k P?= . For all samples the net stress is given 
in MPa. The application of PDP technique demonstrated the potential of 
utilizing the transient method for solving fluid flow in unconventional 
reservoirs and allowed us to have measured permeability values which 
were the basis for validating the distinct permeability correlations 
applied in this work. The N2GA method, performed in an ASAP-2020 
Analyzer-Micrometrics, showed primary experimental curves identified 
as adsorption/desorption isotherms of type II for all the TGS analyzed, 
though the hysteresis loops were dissimilar between distinct reservoirs 
investigated. The main textural parameters (surface area, pore volume 
and pore size distribution) in the micro and mesoporous range were 
assessed using five calculation methods from N2GA technique: 
Langmuir and BET models for surface area calculation; BJH, 
Dollimore-Heal and DFT theory for pore volume calculations. The 
calculated values of the specific surface area using the Langmuir method 
were higher than those of BET due to its monolayer approach as 
explained in section 5.2.5. In this case more accurate BET values were 
between: 0.75 and 1.56 m2/g for TGS of field A; 1.61 and 2.21 m2/g for 
field B; 4.93 and 11.65 m2/g for field C. Although the PSD derived from 
BJH and Dollimore-Heal adsorption models were very similar, we 
choose only the BJH model to be used for the combination of N2GA and 
MICP techniques. The highest amounts of pore volumes measured by 
N2GA technique were found in the samples of field C, an outcrop which 
is made up by a considerably higher amount of microposity. The 
experiments for the mercury capillary pressure curves were performed 
in an Autopore IV 9500 Micromeritics and in combination with the 
N2GA results provided the main information about porosity and pore 
size distributions used for the investigation of permeability predictions 
and comparison of results obtained by the application of the 
compendium of techniques in TGS. The values of density obtained for 
each rock sample and used for the porosity conversion were measured 
by MICP.

 Low-field NMR measurements showed to be an import tool for 
the porosity and PSD quantification as well as permeability predictions 
for the investigated low-permeability TGS rocks of field A. After 
keeping the sample to be 100% brine saturated for about 1 week, the 
experiments were obtained rapidly, in about a half hour on cleaned state 
mini-core samples. NMR measurements using low magnetic fields in 
TGS of field A have given accurate porosity values and reasonable 
agreements with T2 distributions and correspond to pore size 
distributions from mercury porosimetry. Differently than the values of 
T2cutoff found in the literature for sandstones (33 ms) and carbonates (92 
ms) the analyzed TGS rocks displayed values between 2 and 5 ms. The 
T2cutoff value is the boundary between the Bulk Volume Irreducible 
(BVI), comprised by clay- and capillary-bound water, and the Free Fluid 
Index (FFI). In our work we considered the value of BVI to be the much 
defined first peak in the lower region of transverse relaxation time 
curve. As we observed in the analyzed samples from field A, the choice 
of a fixed T2cutoff may not represent this boundary once that it is higly 
depend on lithology and changes considerable from distinct depths in a 
reservoir. Also the T2gm values (the geometric mean of the relaxation 
spectra) was calculated to predict permeability using the Mean-T2 
model and were between 1.26 and 20.3 ms. The parameter b and C from 
the Mean-T2 and Coates 1999 models were refined based on the 
experimental PDP results. The values adjusted for b were between 0.72 
and 39.48 increasing with decreasing of porosity, while the values fitted 
for C tended to increase with porosity and were between 15.63 and 
41.89.  
 By analyzing the 3D volumes reconstructed from integrated slices 
and view processes, researchers made quantitative estimations of pore 
bodies and characteristic connected lengths in samples. From the results 
of X-ray nano- and microCT measurements performed in the TGS of 
well A we were able to quantify porosity and PSD in distinct scales. 
Two methods were applied for the extraction of a 3D pore-network, 
mathematical morphology and equivalent resistor (skeleton). Using both 
methods we integrated the scales to obtain total porosity and PSD in 3D 
multi-scale. We observed that when the frequency number of pore sizes 
is used to integrate the scales, more reliable results were obtained. The 
curves of incremental and cumulative pore volumes from the 
N2GA+MICP combination and from the low-field NMR measurements 
were used to compare the results of the 3D X-ray multi-scale. 
Additionally, important pore structure parameters for permeability

estimation were measured and discussed on samples A-11V and A-17V. 
From the results of porosity and PSD curves (measured by 
N2GA+MICP and low-field NMR) and from the textural analyses 
(performed by XRD and SEM/FEM) we considered that TGS of field A 
could be divided in an upper and a lower region with distinct 
microstructures, respectively represented by samples A-11V and A-17V. 
These measured parameters were: connectivity, tortuosity and shape 
factors, specific surface area (So), aspect ratio, phi and theta orientations. 
We observed that the tortuosity and shape factor values increased with 
decreasing porosity and depth location. The results of So from the 3D 
image analysis (IA) were at least by one decimal order smaller than 
those of the BET results. This fact is expected because in the N2GA 
analysis using BET method, the molecules of nitrogen reach even the 
sub-micron pores adding surface area to the final result, while in IA the 
results are limited to the image resolution. For both analyzed samples 
(A-11V and A-17V) the So determined by X-ray CT in the Res2 was 
higher than Res1 (poorest resolution). The phi and theta orientations 
analysis provided the information for both samples A-11V and A-17V 
that there is a preferred orientation of pores to the X- and Y-axis. 
Transposing these results to the macro-scale of the reservoir one could 
affirm that the horizontal hydrocarbons prospection would be favorable 
in the horizontal bedding direction in the regions of the reservoirs from 
where A-11V and A-17V were extracted. This evidence was confirmed 
by the experimental permeability measurements and also by simulated 
permeability values obtained in each the X-, Y- and Z-axis directions 
from the generated equivalent resistor. The simulations of single-phase 
flow across the generated 3D pore structure, though, were in an 
unreasonable level of agreement to the PDP permeability results. 
Nevertheless, the effort expended towards relating the calculated values 
of tortuosity and shape factors, geometrical and topological attribute of 
pore space, lead to the prediction of more accurate permeability values 
using the Kozeny-Carman model. We observed that from the 
SEM/FESEM to the nano- and microCT analyses, considerable 
microstructural information (pore morphology and especially clay 
content) was lost. We attribute this loss mainly to the low spatial 
resolution of microCT and to the sample size limitation when a high 
resolution of 0.064 ?m is achieved in the nanoCT. In the nanoCT 
acquisition only a very small sample (volume and mass around 
5.66E+04 ?m3 and 4.E-07 g, respectively) subjected to a randomly 
cutting place is manufactured. So for very heterogeneous samples such

as the analyzed TGS A-11V and A-17V (see e.g Figure 6.31 and Figure 
6.32) the usage of nanoCT proceeding would need to be carried in a 
statistical level, i.e. acquisition of many volume regions, meticulous 
work to be conceded. In fact, the dimensions of the pores and their 
connectivity are so small that they change the physics of gas behavior 
needed for reservoir simulators. Another factor which accounts for the 
distinction between measured and simulated permeability is the net 
stress pressure applied to the sample under PDP analysis; this condition 
is needed to perform the same pressure conditions from the original 
field. However, while performing a nano- and microCT acquisition only 
the atmospheric pressure is applied on the analyzed sample. In brief, the 
presence of high content of clay filling pores and also the existence of 
very small pores below the range of the analyzed image resolutions, 
create an obstacle to the segmentation process due to the unsolved grey-
level distribution. As a result, the segmented pore vessels tend to be 
wider then they truly are. Obtaining such detailed properties of the pore 
morphologies information on TGS reservoir rocks would be very 
difficult by usage of direct experiments or conventional techniques and 
even in the nowadays 3D high resolution techniques. Nano- and 
microCT imaging technology is a new technique that provides valuable 
information about the 3D microstructure of TGS. The ability to 
characterize the pore structure of TGS in distinct scales, a very new 
topic, enables improved estimations of porosity and a better 
understanding of the pore network and structural pore parameters in the 
reservoir rock. Also the insights gleaned from this study using nano- and 
microCT images to simulate permeability in very low-permeability 
rocks such as TGS, have made the need to modify and develop new 
models for these rocks obvious. Ultimately, 3D X-ray CT technology is 
a gateway to investigate quantitatively the pore network and the pore 
morphologies in tight gas sandstones, as we observed for our rocks. 
 In the last part of this work we have shown a new method to 
measure the thermal diffusivity coefficient and porosity through 
muscovite-, biotite-, chamosite- and clinochlore-rich seal rocks. In this 
study, the measurements were performed at room temperature and 
atmospheric pressure, looking on the photoacoustic spectroscopy 
technique (PAS) applied in an open photoacoustic cell (OPC). This new 
methodology has the advantage of being simple and of low costs, 
besides it needs only a small piece (1 x 1 cm) of the sample to be 
analyzed. In principle, the technique is applicable to all materials and in 
our knowledge was never applied in seal rocks from petroleum industry

before. We found from the PAS analysis that only the thermal diffusion 
and the thermoelastic bending mechanisms were present in the analyzed 
seal rocks. Measuring the thermal diffusivity of seal rocks from distinct 
wells we can determine the influence of each rock on the generation and 
preservation of oil and gas. By the support of the FESEM and XRD 
analyses, the PAS results allowed us to draw three main conclusions. 
Firstly, the thermal diffusivity of seal rocks from the distinct Brazilian 
fields ranges from 0.01667 to 0.09298 cm2/s. Secondly, a strong 
correlation of thermal diffusivity with chemical composition and crystal 
orientation was observed. For sample SR-57 values of the thermal 
diffusivity were found to be in almost one order smaller then for 
samples SR-42 and SR-47. This fact was attributed to a better 
crystallization, preferential crystal orientation (vertical to bedding) and 
smaller grain sizes in sample SR-57. This rock is considered, therefore, 
a better thermal insulator compared to the other two samples. 
Nevertheless, in addition to being nonporous and non-permeable cap 
rocks, combined with the stable nature of each analyzed seal rock we 
can assume that these samples make good trapping to oil and gas 
reservoirs and are conductive to petroleum generation as well as 
preservation. Lastly, it was possible to predict very low porosity from 
seal rocks (between 1.42 to 9.05%) by usage of the PAS technique. This 
approach was reached by the proposed correlation of the measured 
thermal diffusivity on cleaned vertical-cutted samples (having the 
influence of porosity) and powder-compressed samples (with only the 
rock matrix influence). The results show that thermal diffusivity 
declines as apparent porosity of samples decreases. The PAS method, 
although simple, is useful in estimating the thermal diffusivity and 
porosity of seal rocks with accuracy and has the advantage that it avoids 
the use of complicated experimental setups.
