RESUMO  

 

 

ALMEIDA, Ivan Carlos Carreiro, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, agosto de 2012. 
Solos de Lions Rump, Antártica Marítima: Processos de Formação, Classificação, 
Mapeamento e monitoramento da camada ativa. Orientador: Raphael Bragança Alves 
Fernandes. Coorientador: Carlos Ernesto Gonçalves Reynaud Schaefer 
 

Nas áreas mais periféricas da Antártica, cada vez mais se verifica o aumento de áreas 

livres de gelo e a formação de solos, que merecem ser mais bem estudados para subsidiar 

ações de gestão e preservação. Neste contexto, o presente estudo articula-se dentro de uma 

ampla rede de cooperação científica brasileira para a região Antártica, com foco especial na 

área conhecida como Lions Rump, localizada na Baía Rei George, na Antartica Marítima. O 

objetivo do trabalho foi caracterizar os processos de formação de solos da área, suas 

principais características físicas, químicas, mineralógicas e micromorfológicas, o regime 

térmico-hídrico, as formações geomorfológicas presentes, finalizando com a classificação e 

mapeamento dos solos. Para isto a área foi percorrida e vinte e seis perfis de solos foram 

descritos, amostrados e analisados. Os resultados indicaram que os solos foram formados, 

principalmente, a partir do intemperismo de rochas basálticas-andesíticas, apresentando a 

apatita como mineral acessório e elevado background de P. Propriedades químicas do solo, 

mineralogia e tipo de vegetação foram fortemente influenciadas pela duração da ocupação por 

pinguins e pela drenagem do solo. As principais formações vegetacionais da área foram 

determinantes para o regime térmico-hídrico da camada ativa dos solos. Os resultados obtidos 

permitiram agrupar os solos de Lions Rump em três grupos, em função da influência 

ornitogênica. Os solos ornitogênicos de pH ácido predominam nas posições da paisagem mais 

antigas e estáveis, onde a ocupação das aves foi mais duradoura. Apresentam densa cobertura 

vegetal com plantas superiores, baixo pH e saturação de bases, elevados teores de P, Al+3, 

carbono orgânico total (COT) e N total. Os solos ornitogênicos de pH neutro, semelhante aos 

anteriores, apresentam altos teores de P e densa cobertura vegetal, entretanto possuem alta 

saturação de bases e valores de pH próximos do neutro. Esses estão presentes em áreas 

recentemente ocupadas pela influência ornitogênica, especialmente nas morainas quaternárias 



ix 

 

e terraços soerguidos. A principal diferença entre os dois grupos de solos ornitogênicos foi o 

tempo de exposição à influência das aves e a quantidade de deposição de guano. Nesses solos 

ornitogênicos, a fosfatização é o principal processo de formação do solo, em que os minerais 

fosfatados são formados a partir da interação do guano com os minerais primários dos solos. 

Por sua vez, os solos não ornitogênicos apresentam pH básico, elevada saturação de bases, 

baixo COT e praticamente desprovidos de vegetação. Os principais solos identificados na área 

foram Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic e Typic Gelorthents ornithic, que possivelmente 

representam uma das primeiras áreas livres de gelo colonizados por pinguins na Antártica 

Marítima. O solo Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic representam os solos mais profundos, mais 

estruturados e avermelhados identificados em Lions Rump. Nas posições acima de 80 m de 

altitude acima do nível do mar, especialmente nas áreas de topo e manchas paraglaciais, 

destacam-se os solos Typic Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels, que representam a maior 

cobertura de solo na área estudada. Esses fazem parte do grupo dos Gelisols (Cryosols), que 

são solos com materiais gelic dentro dos primeiros 100 cm da superfície e permafrost dentro 

dos 200 cm da superfície. Nos solos Typic Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels presentes na 

borda das geleiras, o permafrost encontra-se nos primeiros 100 cm do solo e os processos de 

crioturbação são mais expressivos. Entre 40 e 80 m de altitude, aparecem os solos Typic 

Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels, que não apresentam influência de nidificação de aves e 

nem permafrost nos primeiros 200 cm do perfil. No primeiro nível dos terraços e praias, ao 

longo da zona costeira, dominam os solos Vitrandic Cryopsamments e Oxyaquic 

Cryopsamments. Em áreas muito limitadas ainda aparecem os solos Cryorthents ornithic, 

associados aos afloramentos de rochas (plugs basálticos) próximos da praia; e Typic 

Gelifluvents ornithic, em pequenos leques aluviais glaciares. Os processos de formação de 

solos salinização e podzolização, bem como feições redoximórficas não foram observados. O 

monitoramento da camada ativa e permafrost foram realizados pela instalação de sensores de 

umidade e temperatura do solo, e do ar, em dois sitios próximos, na mesma altitude, mesma 

classe de solo, ambos Cambissolo Gélico com cobertura vegetal diferenciada. Uma área era 

coberta por campo de musgo (Andrea gainii) situada em um canal de drenagem e a outra área, 

um pouco mais elevada, coberta por comunidade de liquens dominada por Usnea antarctic 

and Ochrolechia frigida. Resultados mostraram que em ambos os sítios de monitoramento os 

sensores não alcançaram o permafrost até 80 cm, mas devido às temperaturas registradas no 

verão estarem próximas de zero, provavelmente o permafrost está próximo dos 100 cm abaixo 

da superfície. No campo de musgo a variação da temperatura foi menor, esta menor amplitude 



x 

 

está relacionada com o poder tampão da temperatura proporcionado pelo maior conteúdo de 

água neste sítio.

ABSTRACT 

 

 

ALMEIDA, Ivan Carlos Carreiro, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, agosto de 2012. 
Soil of Lions Rump, Maritime Antarctica: Soil formation process, survey, mapping and 
thermal monitoring of the active layer. Adviser: Raphael Bragança Alves Fernandes. Co-
adviser: Carlos Ernesto Gonçalves Reynaud Schaefer 
 

In the peripheral areas of Antarctica, there is an increase in ice-free areas and soil 

formation, which deserve further study to support programs to management and 

preservation. In this context, the present study is structured within a wide network of 

Brazilian scientific cooperation for the Antarctic region, with a special focus in the area 

known as Lions Rump, located in the King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica. The objective 

of this study was to evaluate the processes of soil formation in the area, its main physical, 

chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics, the hydrothermal regime, 

geomorphological formations present, ending with the classification and mapping of soils 

according to the WRB and USDA classification systems. Twenty-six soil profiles from 

Lions Rump (LR), King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica were described, sampled and 

analyzed for their physical, chemical and mineralogical properties, as a result, a soil map 

was made. Results showed that soils in LR are most formed from weathered basalt-andesitic 

rocks, having apatite as accessory mineral, with high P background. For this purpose, the 

area was covered and twenty-six soil profiles were described, sampled and analyzed. The 

results indicated that soil chemical properties, mineralogy and vegetation type were strongly 

influenced by the duration of the occupation by penguins and soil drainage. The main 

vegetation formations within the area were instrumental in the water-thermal regime of the 

active layer of soil. The results grouped Lions Rump soils into three groups, depending on 

the ornithogenic influence. Acidic pH Ornithogenic soils predominate in the oldest and most 

stable of positions the landscape, where the occupation of the birds was longer lasting. They 

have dense vegetation with higher plants, low pH and base saturation, high levels of P, Al3+, 

total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen. Neutral pH ornithogenic soils, similar to 

previous ones, have high levels of P and dense vegetation; however, have high base 

saturation and pH close to neutral. These are present in areas recently occupied by the 



xii 

 

ornithogenic influence, especially in the Quaternary moraines and uplifted terraces. The 

main difference between the two groups of ornithogenic soils was the exposure time under 

the influence of the bird and the amount of guano depositions. In ornithogenic soils, 

phosphatization is the main process of soil formation, in which the phosphate minerals are 

formed from the interaction of guano with the primary minerals of the soil. Non-

ornithogenic soils have basic pH, high base saturation, low TOC and almost devoid of 

vegetation. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main soils in 

LR, which possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by penguins in 

Maritime Antarctica. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic from LR represent the deepest, most 

structured and reddish soils so far described in the area. Typic Haplogelepts ornithic are the 

main soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle Glacier. Typic 

Haplorthels and Lithic Haplorthels are present just above 80 m a.s.l., especially on the top 

areas and paraglacial spots, and represent LR Gelisols, with gelic materials within 100 cm of 

the soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface. Despite their occurrence 

only at higher altitudes, they represent the greatest soil cover in the studied area. Turbic 

Haplogelepts and Typic Haplorthents are situated between 40 and 80 m a.s.l., without bird 

nesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 cm in the profile. Vitrandic 

Cryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces and 

former beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited areas: 

Lithic Cryorthents ornithic, present on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) close to 

the beach, and Typic Gelifluvents ornithic represent a small area on glacial alluvial fans. 

Overall, the distribution and classification of local soils allowed the separation of two main 

soil domains in LR: (1) Ornithogenic soils (without permafrost) and the Gelisols (above 80 

m a.s.l.). The monitoring of active layer thermal regime at Lions Rump was realized in two 

shallow boreholes, geographic closed, at proximally altitude and same soil class but under 

different vegetation. The ground temperature series were collected at 1-hour intervals, 

recorded of two years from March 2009 to February 2011. In both boreholes, a network of 

three soil temperatures sensors were installed at 10, 30 and 80 cm depths, one moisture 

sensor at 80 cm and one air temperature sensor 100 cm height. The two sites show 

significant differences of the mean annual ground temperature for all depths. The moss site 

show lower soil temperature amplitude than Usnea site. The soil temperature at Usnea site 

followed most the variability of air temperate. Moss site show more soil humid throughout 

the years because of his position on the landscape (water track). The buffer effect on moss 

site happens because of the high content of water available associated with the moss 



xiii 

 

vegetation. The active layer in both sites of Lions Rump is thick and the both boreholes did 

not reach the permafrost table, but probable it is between one meter depth.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 

 

 

A Antártica contém 90% do gelo do mundo. Ela exerce influência predominante no clima do 

hemisfério sul e na atmosfera global e nos sistemas criosféricos por causa da sua altitude e posição 

geográfica (Ugolini &amp;amp; Bockheim, 2008). A formação de solo na Antártica está restrita a menos de 

0,35% do continente (45.000 km2), abrangendo áreas livres de gelo, localizadas na costa e nos vales 

secos glaciais entre as montanhas (Campbell e Claridge, 1987, Bockheim, 1997). 

Na Antártica, o intemperismo químico em princípio, não é suficientemente importante para 

causar grandes mudanças na composição da massa de rochas e solos (Kelly &amp;amp; Zumberge, 1961, citados 

por Lee, 2004). As conclusões gerais sobre a formação do solo na Antártica são de que os processos 

químicos de intemperismo funcionam apenas de forma muito limitada e que, a desintegração da rocha e 

formação do solo é provocada em grande parte por processos físicos, embora Simas et al. (2008) tenham 

sugerido uma atuação mais forte de intemperismo químico que o previsto, na Antártica Marítima. A 

vegetação é restrita a musgos, líquens e algas devido à severidade do ambiente, sendo que plantas 

superiores não ocorrem devido às baixas temperaturas e fortes ventos. No entanto, na área denominada 

Antártica marítima, que abrange partes da Península Antártica e as ilhas, o clima é mais quente e 

apresenta mais água no estado liquido, favorecendo o intemperismo químico. Os solos nesta parte da 

Antártica são caracterizados pela maior predominância de processos de crioturbação, como evidenciado 

pela presença de solos com padrões “patterned ground” (Campbell &amp;amp;Claridge, 1987).  

Estudos realizados por Hall (1997) mostraram que a principal limitação para a atuação do 

intemperismo físico associado ao congelamento e descongelamento não é a temperatura, mas sim a 

presença de água no sistema. Nas áreas livres de gelo das regiões costeiras, a formação do solo e a 

atuação dos processos de intemperismo químicos ocorrem em maior intensidade do que se pensava 

anteriormente (Blume et al., 1997; Beyer et al., 2000). Embora as reações sejam presumivelmente lentas 

em condições antárticas, o intemperismo químico ainda é sugerido como o principal processo para a 

elevação dos teores de Mg, Ca e íons carbonatos para a formação dos depósitos de sais (Keys &amp;amp; 

Williams, 1981, citados por Lee, 2004). A deposição de material orgânico pelas aves marinhas também 

apresenta importante papel na formação de solos nessas áreas. 

Como em outras regiões do mundo, o desenvolvimento de solos na Antártica é influenciado pelo 



2 
 

clima, material de origem, topografia e atividade biológica ao longo do tempo. O clima é um dos fatores 

mais importantes para a formação de solos na Antártica, pois influencia a quantidade de umidade 

disponível no perfil, o que irá determinar a gênese dos solos (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 1987), a presença de 

permafrost (French, 2001) e a ocorrência e tipo de vegetação (Ellenberg, 1988). Na Antártica Marítima, 

o clima também é o fator mais relevante para o desenvolvimento do solo, uma vez que a combinação de 

maior precipitação (pode superar 500 mm ano-1) e temperaturas mais altas são mais favoráveis à 

existência da vida vegetal, consistindo ainda em local de acúmulo de quantidades significativas de 

matéria orgânica no solo. 

Mudanças climáticas no passado influenciaram a vegetação com relação às espécies e 

complexidade das comunidades, exercendo impacto significativo sobre suas características e 

distribuição (Birks, 1991; Wick &amp;amp; Tinner 1997; ambos citados por Cannone, 2006). Mesmo atualmente, 

os permafrost têm demonstrado ser altamente suscetíveis às alterações climáticas (Osterkamp 2005), 

sobretudo quando em distribuição descontínua. O clima influencia o permafrost, a espessura da camada 

ativa, a vegetação e as propriedades do solo de forma que estes componentes ambientais interagem via 

mecanismos complexos, afetando os processos pedogenéticos. 

A camada ativa refere-se à camada de solo que está sujeita a congelamento e descongelamento 

anual. Como regra geral, é mais fina nas regiões polares (15 cm), sendo mais espessa nas sub-regiões da 

Antártica (100 cm ou mais) (French, 2001). A espessura da camada ativa pode variar de ano para ano, 

dependendo da temperatura ambiente, grau e orientação do declive, vegetação, drenagem, cobertura de 

neve, o solo e/ou tipo de rocha (French, 2001) e, principalmente, da umidade do perfil (Hall, 1997).  

A profundidade da penetração da frente fria no perfil depende principalmente da intensidade do 

frio, de sua duração, das propriedades térmicas e físicas do solo e rochas, da vegetação sobrejacente, da 

cobertura de neve (French, 2001) e do teor de água livre no solo.  

Os solos que ocorrem em áreas livres de gelo na Antártica continental e são geralmente quase 

totalmente desprovidos de matéria orgânica, sendo denominados de “Ahumic soils” por Tedrov &amp;amp; 

Ugolini (1966), citados por Tatur (1989). Quando presente uma cobertura vegetal de musgos e líquens 

são denominados de “Protoranker soils”. A influência da população biológica é quase indetectável nos 

ahumic soils, que apresentam teores de C orgânico e N extremamente baixos. Em contrapartida, nos 

protoranker soils a influência da vegetação pode ser comprovado pelos maiores teores de C e N na parte 

superior do perfil, alcançando até mais que 7% de C no horizonte orgânico superficial e, acima de 1,2%, 

nas camadas minerais subsuperficiais (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 1987). Em subsuperfície, o enriquecimento 

orgânico se dá, em grande parte, pela presença de raízes e outros fragmentos de plantas, e não de 

materiais humificados, sendo que as relações C/N variam de 6 a 16. Tendo em vista a presença de 

materiais orgânicos não decompostos, esses índices parecem indicar a existência de uma fonte externa 



3 
 

de N, possivelmente a partir de organismos fixadores, excrementos de aves ou via absorção pelas 

plantas de nitrato presente nos sais solúveis na água (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 1987). Na Antártica 

marítima, os solos protoranker são mais comuns, abrangendo grande porção do ambiente, em especial 

na cobertura das morainas, onde a superfície é mais estável (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 1987).  

Com relação à vegetação presente na Antártica Marítima, Holdgate et al. (1967) verificaram 

quatro principais tipos na Ilha Signy, que são ainda considerados como representativo desta região com 

variações de espécies nas diferentes áreas: 

1) associação de líquens e musgos, dominada por Usnea, Himantormia e espécies de Andreaea 

presentes nas áreas expostas de solos rochosos, 

2) associação de musgo (turf-moss), dominada por Dicranum aciphyllum e Polytrichum strictum, 

com incrustações locais de liquens, nas vertentes de inclinação moderada a íngremes, bem drenadas e 

ensolaradas, 

3) associação de “tapetes” de musgos, dominada por Brachythecium, Acrocladium, Pohlia e 

Drepandocladus spp, encontrados em áreas mal drenadas, 

4) comunidades de plantas vasculares, dominadas por Deschampsia antarctica e Colobanthus 

quitensis, em áreas bem drenadas e ensolaradas.  

Devido à ausência de organismo revolvedores de solo, como as minhocas, os organismos 

presentes como colêmbolas, ácaros, nematoides, bactérias, protozoários e fungos estão em grande parte 

confinados à camada orgânica desfavorecendo a formação de húmus e mínima incorporação de matéria 

orgânica no solo (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 1987). Por outro lado, Michel et al. (2006) verificaram a 

formação de substâncias húmicas estáveis em solos ornitogênicos na baía do Almirantado. 

A concentração de nutrientes na maioria das comunidades vegetais (Albuquerque-Filho, 2005) 

sugere que há pouca limitação de nutrientes para o crescimento, apesar de o N poder ser o limitante em 

alguns casos. A principal limitação para o crescimento das plantas parece ser a instabilidade da 

superfície do solo, causada em grande parte pelos processos de crioturbação que impedem o 

estabelecimento das plantas. Quando as superfícies são estáveis, as plantas de melhor adaptação ao 

regime climático vigente são favorecidas e, com elas, a microfauna e microflora associada. 

A ocorrência de avifauna favorece a biodiversidade e a disponibilidade de nutrientes em alguns 

locais, proporcionando a formação de solos ornitogênicos (Ugolini 1970; Ugolini 1972; Tatur, 1989; 

Tatur et al., 1997). Em ecossistemas terrestres da Antártica Marítima (Ilha Rei George), a transferência 

da produção primária marinha para a terra promovidas por pinguins (Pygoscelis sp.) e outras aves 

acentuam os processos de formação do solo, catalisando o intemperismo químico. 

Com o degelo e conseqüente elevação glacio-isostática durante o Holoceno, um grande número 

de pinguineiras foram abandonadas e novas se desenvolveram nos terraços recentemente expostos mais 



4 
 

próximos da costa emergente e em afloramentos rochosos (Tatur et al., 1996). Na sequência, esses sítios 

abandonados foram cobertos pela vegetação e sujeitos aos processos pedogenéticos. Nessas áreas de ex-

colônias da avifauna evoluiu um determinado tipo de solo criogênico, provisoriamente classificado 

como Criossolos Ornitogênicos, com base em atributos físico-químicos peculiares relacionados à 

acumulação de excrementos de aves e de transformação desses sítios em lugares de nidificação ao longo 

da costa antártica (Tatur, 1997). Estes solos são geralmente caracterizadas por baixo valores de pH, 

teores elevados de P, alta disponibilidade de Al3+, e variável, mas geralmente elevada quantidade de 

Ca2+, Mg2+ e K+  trocáveis (Schaefer et al., 2004; Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2007). 

Em áreas de ex-colônias de pingüins, Michel et al. (2006) verificaram a formação de solos com 

claras características ornitogênicas. Nesses solos, o P é encontrado em teores próximos aos verificados 

nas atuais colônias (562-1.119 mg dm-3), e a saturação de Al3+ é elevada e incrementada em 

profundidade em todos os perfis com características espódicas, o que indica que a matéria orgânica pode 

estar associada com a transformação e movimentação vertical de Al3+. A distribuição dos 

microelementos é bastante irregular nestes solos, com teores mais elevados de Mn e Cu em áreas mais 

estáveis e de maior potencial redox e, teores de Zn consideravelmente elevados em locais fortemente 

afetados pela ornitogênese, dada sua estreita relação com organismos marinhos (Santos et al., 2005). A 

distribuição de Fe é regular em profundidade para todos os perfis, com valores ligeiramente superiores 

para os sítios ornitogênicos. Grandes áreas de colônias abandonadas por pinguins e ninhos de skua 

(Catharacta spp.) também apresentam solos fósseis com claras características ornitogênicas, como 

seixos de nidificação e espessa camada orgânica sobrejacente (Schaefer et al., 2004).  

As pinguineiras ativas são totalmente desprovidas de vegetação devido aos efeitos tóxicos 

provocados pelo excesso de excrementos e pelo pisoteio dos pinguins (Tatur et al., 1996). Por outro 

lado, solos ornitogênicos das paleopinguineiras e sítios marginais com moderada à alta abundância de 

nutrientes apresentam vegetação densa e mais diversificada (Tatur, 1989). 

Vários estudos realizados na Antártica Marítima provaram que materiais lixiviados a partir do 

guano reagem fortemente com o substrato subsuperficial, formando uma camada de material fosfatizado 

que pode ser subdividida em horizontes genéticos de diferente composição mineral (Tatur &amp;amp; Barczuc, 

1983; Tatur &amp;amp; Myrcha, 1993a). Este processo especial de formação do solo, denominado fosfatização 

(Schaefer et al., 2004; Simas et al., 2008 e Schaefer et al., 2008), é possível devido à intensa entrada de 

material orgânico rico em P durante o verão. Tatur &amp;amp; Myrcha (1993b) estimaram essa contribuição de 

excrementos das aves como equivalente a aproximadamente 10 kg m-2 (peso seco) por ano. Nesses 

sítios, após o abandono das aves, um oásis de vegetação se desenvolve, com maior atividade biológica, 

temperatura mais alta e uma camada ativa mais espessa (Myrcha et al., 1983). 

Apesar da limitada distribuição geográfica, os solos ornitogênicos são os mais desenvolvidos e 



5 
 

os mais importantes reservatórios de C orgânico (Simas et al., 2007) na Antártida terrestre. A 

compreensão dos fenômenos físicos e químicos, da dinâmica da matéria orgânica e dos ciclos 

biogeoquímicos nas áreas polares apresenta especial relevância para a preservação desses ambientes e 

para um melhor entendimento da pedogênese em ambientes de extremo frio (Michel et al., 2006). 

Em estudo da gênese dos solos da baía do Almirantado, na Antártica Marítima, Simas et al. 

(2007) descreveram e analisaram 56 perfis e verificaram que a gênese nesses solos fracamente 

desenvolvidos, exceto nos ornitogênicos, é muito influenciada pela litologia do material de origem. Os 

autores então proporam a divisão desses solos em quatros grupos principais: 1) basalticos/andesiticos, 2) 

sulfatados ácidos, 3) fracamente ornitogênicos e 4) ornitogênicos. Os eutric Lithic and Typic 

Haploturbels (Turbic-leptic Cryosols), de reações neutras a alcalinas são solos predominantes nos 

depósitos basálticos/andesíticos. Os ácidos dystric Sulfuric Haploturbels (Turbic-thionic Cryosols) estão 

limitados aos materiais andesíticos piritizados e os Umbriturbels (Turbic-umbric Cryosols) são os 

formados devido à influência da avifauna. Os solos ornitogênicos são os formados pela presença no 

passado ou atual de pinguineiras ativas. Os Organo Fibristels são encontrados em locais mal drenados e 

sob espessa camada de tapetes de musgos. Trabalhos como o desses autores são interessantes, pois 

permitem contribuir com possíveis modificações nos sistemas de classificação de solos existentes para 

que possam, no futuro, enquadrar os solos da Antártica Marítima.  

As regiões polares são consideradas como sistemas muito sensíveis param se estudar os impactos 

do clima, pois seus componentes abióticos (Weller 1998) e bióticos (Hodkinson et al., 1998) são 

altamente suscetíveis a perturbações. As zonas polares de ambos os hemisférios têm sido muito 

referenciadas como regiões-chave para a avaliação e monitoramento dos impactos das alterações 

climáticas. Mudanças mais evidentes e mais rápidas são esperadas nas áreas polares e as primeiras 

provas foram relatadas no Ártico e na Península Antártica (Convey, 2001; Cook et al., 2005; Turner et 

al., 2005). A influência do clima sobre o permafrost é expressa pela combinação do balanço energético 

na superfície e o balanço térmico, ou seja, respectivamente associado à temperatura da superfície do 

solo (GST) e à temperatura do permafrost devido ao aporte energético da GST. O balanço energético da 

superfície é influenciado por fatores como vegetação e cobertura de neve, ambas agindo como uma 

camada de tamponamento entre a atmosfera e o solo (Williams &amp;amp; Smith 1989). A cobertura do solo e, 

sobretudo, as mudanças na vegetação estão entre os fatores mais importantes capazes de modificar a 

distribuição do permafrost e seu regime térmico. Monitorar tais efeitos e associá-los às mudanças 

climáticas globais é um grande desafio aos pedólogos, que agora exploram com mais intensidade a 

Antártica Marítima. 

Devido à sensibilidade do ambiente antártico as variações climáticas, a avaliação do 

comportamento do degelo dos permafrost é de grande valia para elucidar os possíveis impactos que o 



6 
 

aquecimento global pode trazer ao planeta. Isso porque a camada de gelo que cobre o solo, além de atuar 

como isolante térmico, favorecendo a permanência dos permafrost, favorece também a reflexão da 

irradiação solar contribuindo para existência dos permafrost durante todo o ano. Com avanço atual do 

degelo em áreas que antes estavam continuamente congeladas, a tendência é que cada ano mais área seja 

descoberta, pois o solo desnudo de gelo tem maior capacidade de absorção da intensidade luminosa, 

além de favorecer a colonização por espécies vegetais, que concomitantemente levam ao aumento da 

temperatura desses solos, agravando o degelo dos permafrost e ativando os processos pedogenéticos. 

Assim é de grande valia e importância elucidar quais os fatores atmosféricos e do solo 

(mineralogia, estrutura, textura, umidade, atividade biológica) que ditam a temperatura e o controle 

desses permafrost. 

Solos posicionados em vertentes que recebem menor irradiação solar apresentam-se menos 

intemperizados e menos profundos, em função da menor quantidade de energia luminosa incidente, 

resultando em um ambiente mais frio e seco. Esses fatores desfavorecem também a ornitogênese, muito 

importante para a pedogênese nas áreas mais úmidas.  

De acordo com o supracitado o presente trabalho foi dividido em três capítulos, os quais tiveram 

como objetivos: 

? Fazer o levantamento e mapeamento dos solos de Lions Rump, caracterizando os atribudos químicos, 
físicos e mineralógicos da área e suas relações com a geomorfologia e cobertura vegetal e 

Correlacionar características de solos, vegetação e dos processos paraglaciais e periglaciais e 

comparar solos ornitogênicos da área de estudo com os de outras áreas da Antártica Marítima 

e Peninsular.  

? Estudar a fração argila dos solos de Lions Rump analizando e descrevendo as mais importantes 
feições micromorfologicas típicas em solos criogênicos, principalmente dos ornitogênicos.. 

? Avaliar o regime anual e sazonal de umidade e a dinâmica térmica da camada ativa de dois solos 
sobre diferente cobertura vegetal e elucidar a influência da cobertura vegetal no 

comportamento hidrotermal dos solos em estudo. 

? E no futuro com os resultados da tese gerar também mapas de geomorfologia e vegetação da área em 
estudo, incluindo um banco de dados dos Criossolos, com dados analíticos e camadas de 

informações para possível adição em ambiente Web-SIG.

ABSTRACT 

 

The aim of this paper was to study, classify and map soils from Lions Rump, King George Bay, 

Maritime Antarctica, according to WRB and USDA soil classification systems in association with 

geomorphological features. Twenty-six soil profiles from study area were described, sampled and 

analyzed for their physical, chemical and mineralogical attributes. Results showed soils are most formed 

from weathered basalt-andesitic rocks, naturally rich in apatite, with high P background. Typic 

Dystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main ornithogenic soils in study area, 

which possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by penguins in Maritime Antarctica. 

Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic represent the deepest, most structured and reddish soils in the area. Typic 

Haplogelepts ornithic are the main soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle 

Glacier. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present just above 80 m a.s.l., especially on the 

top areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols in study area, with gelic materials within 100 cm 

and permafrost within 200 cm from the soil surface. Despite their occurrence only at higher altitudes, 

they represent the greatest soil cover in Lions Rump. Turbic Haplogelepts and Typic Haplorthents are 

situated between 40 and 80 m.a.s.l., without bird nesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 

cm depth. Vitrandic Cryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces 

and former beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited areas: Lithic 

Cryorthents ornithic on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) close to the beach, and Typic 

Gelifluvents ornithic in a small area on glacial alluvial fans. Overall, soil distribution and classification 

in Lions Rump allowed identified two main soil domains: Ornithogenic soils (without permafrost) and 

the Gelisols (above 80 m a.s.l.).

INTRODUCTION 

Soil formation in Antarctica is restricted to about 0.32% or 45.000 km2 of the continent, in ice-

free regions of coastal areas and glacial valleys between mountain ranges (Ugolini and Bockheim, 

2008). The first study with Antarctica soils was carried in McMurdo US Base by Jensen (1916), and the 

first field study and soil mapping compiled occurred in the Taylor Valley of southern Victoria Land by 

McCraw (1967) (Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008). Despite increased research on soils in recent years, 

most studies on Maritime Antarctica focused mainly Ornithogenic soils. In addition, only few soil maps 

were produced throughout the history of pedology in Antarctica.  

Gelisols order was approved in 1996 as the 12th order in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 

1999) and included in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2006) to comprise the permafrost-affected soils and 

are divided into three suborders: Histels, Turbels, and Orthels. Histels are organic soils containing 

permafrost within 100 cm of the surface. Orthels are soils with gelic materials within 100 cm of the soil 

surface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface and the Orthels are soils with permarfrost 

within 100 cm and minimal cryoturbation. 

 Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008 in a review observed that in Antarctica soils with ice-cemented 

permafrost within 70 cm of the surface generally are cryoturbated and classified in the Turbel suborder, 

and soils with dry permafrost and minimal cryoturbation are classified as Orthels. Soils in coastal 

regions of Antarctica are in HaploGreat Groups, and soils further inland in areas receiving less than 50 

mm of water-equivalent precipitation are in Anhy Great Groups. Antarctica soils are further 

differentiated at the subgroup level based upon the amount and type of salts and other diagnostic 

features (Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008). 

Although the temperatures are very low in Antarctic, in the region a chemical weathering occurs. 

Some studies showed chemical weathering in Gelisols occurring a greater extent than previously 

thought (Blume and Bolter, 1993; Simas et al., 2006; Schaefer et al, 2008). 

One of the characteristics of Gelisols is their very low clay content, which even in the oldest 

soils from Continental Antarctica seldom exceeds 4% (Beyer et al., 1999). Moreover, in the Maritime 

Antarctic, clay content can reach ? 20%, overcoming continental area and indicating advanced 

weathering in this region. In general terms, in Continental Antarctica, the youngest soils are found in the 

coastal regions and lower valleys, and the oldest ones at higher altitudes inland (Beyer et al., 1999). 

However, in the Maritime Antarctic, more developed soils are close to the ocean, especially in soils 

known as ornithogenic soils, formed in areas influenced by bird’s activities. 

In the Maritime Antarctic, the mean annual temperature is considerably higher (-1 to -3°C) than 

the continental area, with two to four months of higher temperatures in the coastal locations and at low 

altitudes. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm (Bockheim and Ugolini, 1990). Under these 



13 
 

climate conditions, occurs a higher biodiversity and two higher plants are found in addition to the lower 

plants observed in East Antarctica. 

 In the peripheric areas of Antarctica, it has been verified an increase in ice-free areas and soil 

formation, which deserve further studies to support management programs for preservation of the 

region. Soil maps provide a very important base for environmental management and planning human 

activities, as well as for ecological studies on terrestrial ecosystems (Moura et al., 2012).  

Some studies and soil mapping were produced for Maritime Antarctica (Francelino et al., 2011; 

Michel, 2011; Moura et al., 2012; Pereira, 2012). These works produced soil maps for ice-free areas in 

South Shetlands Archipelago and Antarctic Peninsula to support the ANTPAS project (The Antarctic 

and Sub-Antarctic Permafrost, Soils and Periglacial Environments). Although sites of Byers Peninsula, 

Fildes Peninsula, and other areas from Admiralty Bay had been concluded, no mapping soils had 

published for Lions Rump, in King George Bay. For this reason, the present paper report soil survey and 

discuss main soil classes identified in Lions Rump, and also present a first approximation of the soil 

map of area, highlighting selected soil chemical, physical and mineralogical attributes and its 

relationship with the vegetation cover. 

 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Site description 

Lions Rump is a small peninsula located on the southern coast of King George Bay, King 

George Island, in the South Shetlands Islands, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The area is designated as 

the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI N° 34) and takes its name Lions Rump from the distinctive 

rocky hill lying between the southern extremity of King George Bay and Lions Cove. The study area is 

defined as terrestrial land within following coordinates: 62°07’48’’S, 58°09’17’’W; 62°07’49’’S, 

58°07’14’’W; 62°08’19’’S, 58°07’19’’W; and 62°08’16’’S, 58°09’15’’W (SCAR, 2002). According to 

Köppen's classification, the region is part of the ET, tundra climate. Data sets acquired at the Brazilian 

Commandant Ferraz, nearby station from Lions Rump, report mean air temperatures varying from – 6.4 

°C in July to + 2.3 °C in February. Mean annual precipitation is proximally to 400 mm (Simas et al., 

2007), but the real soil water regime is highly influenced by its position in the landscape, due to the 

intense melting of snow, glaciers and permafrost sites upstream during the summer. The temperature 

remains above freezing almost all summer (November to March) allowing the vigorous growth of plant 

communities, mainly mosses, lichens and algae (Schaefer et al., 2004).  The area includes the littoral 

and sublittoral zones extending from the eastern end of Lajkonik Rock to the most northerly point of 

Twin Pinnacles. From this point, the boundary extends to the easternmost end of the columnar plug of 



14 
 

Lions Head to the east of White Eagle Glacier. On land, the area includes the coast of raised beaches, 

freshwater pools and streams on the south side of King George Bay, around Lions Cove, and the 

moraines and slopes which lead to the lower ice tongue of White Eagle Glacier, then westward to a 

small moraine which protrudes through the ice cap south-east of Sukiennice Hills. 

The geology of Lions Rump is formed by Tertiary lavas and tuff containing thin brown coal 

intercalations and petrified wood fragments and Quaternary deposits. The front of White Eagle Glacier 

is marked by large, dome-shaped moraine ridges belonging to several Holocene stages of glacier 

advance and retreat (Birkenmajer, 1994; Scar, 2002).  

Two Tertiary lithostratigraphic groups are described, separated one from another by an important 

fault: the Polonia Glacier Group (volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks, Eocene) in the north, and the 

Chopin Ridge Group (Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene volcanics, and Lower Oligocene glacial and 

glacio-marine deposits) in the south. Both groups consist of several units of formation and member 

ranks (Birkenmajer, 1994).  

 

 

Figure 1 – Lions Rump located at King George Bay, King George Island, South Shetlands, 
Maritime Antarctica. 

 
The Quaternary deposits consist of three generations of moraines, outwash shoreline and raised 

beach deposits. The first generations of moraines were formed as a result of glacier advance in the 

second half of the 18th century, the second one prior to 1960, and the third one between 1988 and 1991.  



15 
 

The first generation marginal (lateral) of moraine occurs on both sides of the valley of the 

northeastern side of White Eagle Glacier ended in the cliffs of marine abrasion, being bordered by 

recent pebble dikes up to 3.5 m tall. The second generation is representing by an isolated crescentic 

ridge which reaches down to sea shore at King George Bay and is covered by younger generation 

moraines at its landward termination. The late and younger generation moraines form several ridges at 

the margin of the White Eagle Glacier, which steeply descend towards Lions Cove and King George 

Bay, and cover the recent beach. An outwash apron is being formed at the outlet of a glacier river which 

cuts a deep canyon into the recent moraines; and smaller outwash cones are present on both sides of the 

older moraine ridge (Birkenmajer, 1981; Birkenmajer, 1994).  

Along the shoreline, pebbly storm ridges cutting off small lagoons developed. Traces of raised 

beaches with well-rounded pebbles are visible at 15 to20 m.a.s.l. on a morphological ridge dividing 

Lions Cove from King George Bay (Birkenmajer, 1981). 

The ice-free area exhibits a range of geomorphological features, including beaches of various 

widths and length, moraines, hills and inland rocks.  

 

Field works 

The study area was visited on austral summer of 2009/2010, during Brazilian Antarctic 

Expeditions. During field work, 26 pedons (Tables 1, 2 and 3) representing the main soil types identified 

in ice-free areas of Lions Rump were described and sampled, based on criteria established by Antarctic 

Permafrost and Soils (ANTPAS, 2006) and considering geomorphological features. For soil 

classification USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2010) and World Reference Base for Soil 

Resources (WRB) (ISSS Working Group, 2006) were used. For a detailed soil mapping, the free-choice 

profiling (Embrapa, 1995) was used. The cartographic reference material was a Quickbird image (scale 

1:4500). Software ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, 2009) was used for data processing and map editing. Amoung the 

26 soils profiles, 13 more representative are selected and showed in this paper (Figure 2, 3 and 4). 

 

Laboratory procedures 

After soil sampling and transport to Brazil, soil analyses were carried out. Soil physic was 

analyzed with texture procedure (EMBRAPA, 1997 modified by Ruiz, 2005). Soil chemical attributes 

analyzed were: pH (H2O and 1 mol L
-1 KCl) ; total organic carbon (TOC) in extracts of fulvic acid, 

humic acid and humin fractions (Yeomans and Bremner, 1988), Na and K after extraction with 0.5 mol 

L-1 HCl + 0.0125 mol L-1 H2SO4 (Mehlich-1); available P (Mehlich-1), Ca
 , Mg, and Al after extraction 

with 1 mol L-1 KCl; H+Al after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 Ca(CH3COO)2 at pH 7.0; CaCO3 by titration 

after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 HCl. All chemical analyses were carried according to EMBRAPA 



16 
 

(1997). Samples were analyzed for total contents of Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Al, Mn, P, Cu, Zn, Cd, As, Cr, and 

Pb after total digestion sieved (mesh 0.25 mm) material with HCl, HNO3 and HF by heating in a 

microwave oven (CEM/MDS 2000) according to the EPA-3052 method (USEPA. 2011). The element 

contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Soil 

mineralogical composition of clay fraction was evaluated on air-dried samples by X-ray diffraction 

(XRD) in natural clay and in clay samples after saturation with 1.0 mol L-1 KCl; heating in an oven at 

350 ºC and 550 °C for 3 hours each; saturation with 1.0 mol L-1 MgCl2 and glycerol solvation. A 

diffractometer (PANalytical / X `Pert Pro) was used, operated at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 30 

mA with CoK? radiation within the range between 4 and 50 °2?, at step of 0.017 °2? to 1 step s-1.  

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

General characterization of the studied area 

Lions Rump is propicious to development of diverse species of flora and fauna. The principal 

vegetation cover, geographic distribution and soil classification of studied area soils are presented at 

table 1. 

In general, soils from Lions Rump are incipient and poorly evolved when classified by WRB and 

Soil Taxonomy. Four of present soils from this study are Ornithogenic Soils, and the others are mainly 

Cryosols/ Gelisols located in the highest landscaping portion. Cambisol/Inceptsol and (Regosols, 

Arenosols, Leptsols)/Entsols are widespread in the lowland area.

Vegetation 

Vegetation especies were identified with help of botanist researchers Antônio Batista 

Pereira and Lucas Marinho Poeiras. 

The presence of Prasiola crispa is associated with proximity of penguin rookeries. 

This type of algae occurs in N-rich soils. Lichens are widespread on rocks or rock fragments 

in all order of soils present at study area. The lichens species observed at Lions Rump were 

Acarospora sp, Bacidia sp, Buellia sp, Caloplaca cinericola, Caloplaca regalis, Candelaria 

flava, Cornicularia aculeate, Haematomma erytromma, Lecanora polytropa, Lecidea sp, 

Leptogium puberulum, Mastodia tesselata, Ochrolechia antarctica, Ochrolechia frigida,  

Physcia caesia, Placopsis contortuplicata, Psoroma cinnamomeum, Ramalina terebrata, 

Rhizocarpon geographicum, Rhizoplaca sp, Sphaerophorus globosus, Usnea antarctica, 

Usnea aurantiaco-atra and Xanthoria candelaria. On the other hand, species as Buellia sp., L. 

puberulum and U. antarctica are also frequently observed covering vegetated soils. At higher 

elevations, soils are practically devoid of vegetation cover except for sparse epilithic lichens. 

Above 80 m a.s.l., Usnea is the principal lichen occurring on Gelisols (Cryosol).  

Flowering plants are representing only by Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus 

quitensis, which occurs principally on Quaternary features, with dense covering on uplifted 

terraces, beaches, moraines and abandoned rookeries. 

Mosses are found mostly in wet areas forming carpets or cushions in other soils. At 

wetter sites, cryptogrammic organisms extend as a continuous cover, and A horizons are 

formed. A sharp boundary is observed between the A horizon and the underlying B horizon, 

with reduction of organic C with depth. The field of mosses in the southern part of the Lions 

Rump peninsula covering a large area, as identified in LR21 profile, is in process of 

degradation because of melting water drainages. The found mosses in Lions Rump were 

Andreaea gainii, Brachytecium sp, Bryum argenteum, Bryum dichotomum, Bryum 

pseudotriquetrum, Polytrichum alpinum, Sanionia uncinata, Schistidium falcatum and 

Syntrichia princeps. 

On the breeding rookery all vegetation has been devastated due to excessive manuring 

and trampling by penguins as previously indicated as Ugolini (1970, 1972), Tatur (1989), 

Michel et al. (2006) and Simas et al. (2007) studying ice-free areas of the South Shetlands 

Islands. Only nitrophilous lichens can be noted on big stones and rocky walls. But in marginal 

zones of penguin activity abundance of nutrients in water running down from the rookery and 

spread by the wind ensures luxurious development of vegetation. This seems to be a standard 



22 
 

in Maritime Antarctica with reports by Tatur and Myrcha,1989; 1991; Tatur et al., 1997; 

Michel et al, 2006; Simas et al., 2007, 2008; and Schaefer et al., 2008.  

 

Soil classification and characteristics 

Deposition of P and N-rich guano favors vegetation establishment. Soil chemical 

properties, mineralogy and the type of vegetation are strongly influenced by the duration of 

site occupation by penguins and soil drainage characteristics. Because of this avifauna 

influence we can divide soils from Lions Rump in three groups (Table 2): Acid pH 

ornithogenic soils (LR8, LR9) (Figure 3), Neutral pH ornithogenic soils (LR15, LR22, LR23) 

(Figure 4), and Non-ornithogenic soils (LR3, LR4, LR5, LR12, LR 13, LR19, LR21, LR24) 

(Figure 2). 

In oldest and most stable landscapes where bird's occupation has been long domain 

Acid pH ornithogenic soils (LR8), which are mostly common cited in the literature widely 

known just like ornithogenic soils (Ugolini, 1972; Tatur and Barczuk, 1985; Tatur and 

Myrcha, 1989, 1991, 1993; Tatur et al., 1997; Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2007, 2008, 

and Schaefer et al., 2008). The Acid pH ornithogenic soils are readily distinguished from the 

Non-ornithogenic soil by several features such as the presence of continuous vegetation cover 

with D. antarctica, C. quitensis and/or Prasiola crispa; lower pH and bases saturation (PBS); 

very high Melich-1 extractable-P, exchangeable Al, TOC and total N (Table 3). Concentration 

of K+, P and Al3+ tend to increase in the deepest layer while Ca2+ and Mg2+ and pH tend to 

reduce.  

The Neutral pH ornithogenic soils show high levels of label P and similar vegetation 

cover as Acid pH ornithogenic soils. However they have high concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+ 

and K+ and pH close to neutral. They are present at areas with recently exposure to 

ornithogenic influence, especially at Quaternary moraines and uplifted terrace (LR15 and 

LR23). The principal difference between acid and Neutral ornithogenic soils is time of soil 

exposure to bird influence and the amount of bird excrement depositions. 

Mean pH for Acid ornithogenic soils studied was 4.3 (±0.33), much lower than the 

mean values for Neutral ornithogenic soils (7.0 ±1.2) and Non-ornithogenic soils (7.4 ±1.1) 

(Table 3). Such acidity is produced during guano mineralization, through the production of 

strong acids such as HNO3 (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985). 

At Neutral ornithogenic soils, both cation exchange capacity (CEC) and percentage of 

base saturation (PBS) are high and represent an eutrophic soil, contrasting with dystrophic 

Acid ornithogenic soils with low CEC (Table 3).

Soils formed under direct penguin influence (Acid and Neutral ornithogenic soils) a 

mean content of 1075.3 (±1206.4) mg/dm3 of P was obtained. The extremely high Melich-1 

extractable-P for the highest and most ancient ornithogenic soil (LR7) indicates that P 

minerals constitute stable P reserves at these sites, as confirmed by XRD analysis (data not 

show for LR7), besides the greater amount of P as amorphous mineral and organic form. 

Mean extractable P in Acid ornithogenic soil is more than ten times higher than the levels 

observed for Non-ornithogenic soils while exchangeable Ca2+ is more than nine times lower. 

Similar results were observed by Moura et al., (2012) studying soils from Byers Peninsula, 

Livingston Island. As it has been show for similar soils from Maritime Antarctica (Simas et 

al., 2006, 2007), soils development in such conditions are marked by the instability of P–Ca 

phases. Soil acidity also alters clay minerals and rock forming minerals with formation of P–

Al–K phases of varyed crystallinity (Simas et al., 2006). In such pedoenvironements, 

phosphatization is the main soil forming process and determines soils overall chemistry and 

ecosystem functioning (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985; Simas et al., 2007). 

The highest content of Melich-1 extractable-P was obtained for the first layers of the 

most recently abandoned rookery (LR9, Table 3). High P values in depth for LR7 (not show) 

indicate P illuviation after site abandonment by penguins. A detailed study of clay-sized 

minerals for Antarctic soils with different degrees of ornithogenic influence is presented by 

Simas et al. (2006) and Schaefer et al (2008). 

The soils from penguin rookeries and adjacent areas are more developed than soils 

with no faunal influence, as observed when comparing LR8 with LR3. A stony/pebbly 

pavement is present in all sites but is often hidden by the well-developed and continuous 

vegetation in ornithogenic sites. Clear horizon differentiation occurs and a relatively deep 

organic matter-rich A horizons and phosphatic B horizons were easily identified. Surface 

horizons are dark and yellowish brown as a result of humus incorporation corroborating the 

study of Simas et al. (2008) and Michel et al. (2006) in other areas of King George Island. 

In the most developed ornithogenic soils (LR8), the surface horizons have lower P 

contents in comparison with depth horizons, due to plant uptake, organic material 

accumulation over old layers of guano deposition, concomitantly with P leaching (Table 3). 

In the absence of ornithogenic activity, the soil chemical weathering in Antarctic is 

less pronounced and soils present chemical and mineralogical characteristics main influenced 

by the parent material. For Non-ornithogenic soils in Lions Rump, high pH, Ca2+ and Mg2+ 

levels, and salinity are usually observed, as verified in LR4, LR5 and LR12; and K+ 

concentration is lower than in ornithogenic soils, which receive K+ deposition from guano.  



30 
 

The mean P content in Non-ornithogenic soils was 102.7 ± 48.0 mg/dm3, which is an 

expressive concentration for soils without bird influence, but occurs because these soils are 

most formed from weathered basalt-andesitic rocks, naturally present apatite as mineal 

accessory. 

Even in areas with some stagnant water (LR19, LR21 and LR 25), no redoximorphic 

features were observed, as described by Blume et al. (2002) and Simas et al. (2008) for some 

hydromorphic soils of Maritime Antarctic. No features of salinization were observed either in 

any profile studied, neither podzolization, even in soils with high sand content.  

Acid sulfate soils as a product of oxidation sulfides, as described by Simas et al. 

(2006) and Simas et al. (2008) in Admiralty Bay, occurs at one unique site at Lions Rump 

where it is formed from sulfide bearing andesites and related tills. These soils are represented 

by LR13 profile, which present much lower pH (3.62), high contents of exchangeable Al3+ 

(19.5 cmolc.dm
-3) and H+Al (28.1 cmolc/dm

3), and very low P contents (6.9 mg.dm-3). In the 

clay fraction of this soil, jarosite and smectite are the principal minerals (Figure 7). This 

profile also present signals of ashes from the last volcanic eruption from Penguin Island.  

Soils from Lions Rump present relatively low amounts of fine particles, clay (9.2%) 

and silt (24.9%) (Table 2), in comparison to other soils from Admiralty Bay. Clay contents 

are higher at Ornithogenic soils contrasting with results of Simas et al. (2008), who found 

lower clay proportion for Ornithogenic in comparison with non-ornithogenic. All soils are 

gravelly and with similar content of particles &gt; 2 mm, but a tendency to be more skeletal is 

verified for soils formed from bedrock Tertiary materials and at higher altitudes (Table 2). 

The soil structure from Lions Rump is dominated for weak, medium-sized, blocks and 

moderate medium granular features, domining clear to gradual wavy transition between 

horizons what may confirm the weak cryoturbation features in this area (Table 2). 

The studies of Simas et al. (2008) who described 56 pedons distributed in the major 

ice-free areas of Keller Peninsula, Crépin Point, Rakusa Point, Llano Point, Hennequin Point 

and Ullman Point, and Michel et al. (2006) who studied “Copabacana area” indicate that most 

soils studied in Admiralty Bay present permafrost in the upper 200 cm in January 2003, and 

therefore, can be fitted within the Gelisol order of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2010) 

and in the Cryosol Major Group of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (ISSS, 

2006). Typical cryoturbation features such as patterned ground (i.e. stone circles, stripes and 

earth hummocks), irregular and broken horizons, vertical orientation of stones within the soil 

profile, buried organic matter, and formation of silt caps were commonly observed, as 

indicated for Bockheim and Tarnocai (1998) and Tarnocai et al. (2004). In Lions Rump area, 



31 
 

none of the ornithogenic soils was classified as Gelisol and cryoturbation features are not 

commonly observed. Soils with permafrost occur only above 80 m.a.s.l. and for all studied 

profiles and they are deeper than 100 cm. For this reason, we can just classify them as Gelisol 

because they have a cryic horizon starting within 200 cm from soil surface and evidence of 

cryoturbation in some layer within 100 cm of the soil surface. 

 

Total organic carbon and humic substances 

Although biomass production by Antarctic vegetation is scarce, it frequently exceeds 

decomposition capacity of local microbiota, which is limited by climate conditions (Ugolini. 

1972). Then, low temperatures and moisture are crucial for the low microbial activity and 

humification rate (formation of humic substances) of Antarctic soils (Pereira, 2012). 

Therefore, organic matter accumulates at some specific sites and plays important pedological 

and ecological roles (Beyer et al, 1995; Beyer. 2000; Bölter and Kandeler. 2004; Simas et al, 

2008). 

The sea–land transfer of matter and nutrients favors vegetation development and 

position of ornithogenic soils in landscape. These soils are the main terrestrial organic carbon 

pool of Maritime Antarctica (Simas et al., 2007). In Lions Rump total organic carbon for 

ornithogenic soils are approximately four times higher than for Non-ornithogenic soils.  

The fractionation of humic substances in ornithogenic soil indicated averages of 0.55 

dag kg-1 fulvic acids (FA), 0.83 dag kg-1 humic acids (HA), and 3.67 dag kg-1 humin (HU) 

(Table 4). In ornithogenic soils, HU contents are higher due to dense cover of higher plants 

(D. antarctica and C. quitensis), which are responsible for the incorporation of lignin from the 

root system into the soil. These HU possibly are not a real humic substance, been a residual 

organic material without decomposition.  

 HA and AF fractions are probably present because they are provided by guano. In 

Non-ornithogenic soils, we found averages of 0.1 dag kg-1 fulvic acids (FA), 0.3 dag kg-1 

humin (HU) and no detectable humic acids (Table 4). These low contents are justified by the 

almost absence of vegetation at these soils. 

Pereira (2012) found for soils from Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, HA dominating 

other carbon forms where vegetation is formed principal by mosses and lichen. They related 

this high ratio HA/FA as indicative of higher degree of humification.

Sites dominated by D. antarctica and/or C. quitensis (LR8 and LR15) present higher 

TOC contents in profiles with depth due to presence of lignine-bearing tissues and proper root 

systems. On the other hand, soils covered with P.crispa (LR23) or mosses (LR21) present an 

abrupt reduction of TOC with depth. Although ornithogenic soils exhibit high content of 

TOC, no umbric epipedon was described. For Non-ornithogenic soils, humin (HU) is almost 

the only form of organic compounds; it is practically absent from organic matter label forms.  

The tendency of increasing HA/FA ratio with depth in Acid ornithogenic soils, as also 

observed by Michel et al. (2006), can be associated to migration and reaction of organic 

matter along the profile, causing polycondensation and accumulation of the more recalcitrant 

humic substances in depth.  

 

Total elemental composition 

Total mean contents of CaO, MgO and K2O were respectively 0.24; 0.05 dag kg
-1, and 

1.02 dag kg-1 for Acid ornithogenic soils; 0.51, 0.08, and 0.43 dag kg-1,  for Neutral 

ornithogenic soils; and 0.48, 0.11, and 0.72 dag kg-1 for Non-ornithogenic soils (Table 5). 

These data show the reduction of CaO and MgO contents and the increasing of K2O in Acid 

ornithogenic soil, what derivated from Ca and Mg leaching, K addition from guano and 

formation of phosphates mineral K-rich as taranakite.  

Plagioclases were detected in all soils (see mineralogy). In this case, the presence of 

easily weathered primary minerals in clay fraction indicates a limited chemical change and the 

effect of cryoclasty, decreasing particles size and increasing CEC. The higher content of total 

K2O in comparison to exchangeable ones suggests that K is present mostly in non-

exchangeable forms, possibly associated to the formation of phosphate clays, typical minerals 

from phosphatization process (Pereira, 2012), process as well as associated with the 

plagioclases in the soil (Figure 6, see mineralogy). 

Mean contents of total P2O5 were 5.62 dag kg
-1 for Acid ornithogenic soils, 0.43 dag 

kg-1 for Neutral ornithogenic soils, and 0.18 dag kg-1 for Non-ornithogenic soils (Table 5). 

The P enrichment in sites with previous or current ornithogenesis influence is significative. 

The P total in Acid ornithogenic soils is 31 times higher than Non-ornithogenic ones, which 

confirm the importance of avifauna influence in soil transformation in these Antarctica 

environments.

Mean total contents of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were respectively, 7.74 and 4.90 dag kg
-1 for 

Acid ornithogenic soils, 8.61 and 3.55 dag kg-1 for Neutral ornithogenic soils, and 8.25 and 

3.96 dag kg-1 for Non-Ornithogenic soils (Table 5). These data indicate these oxides are 

closely related with the parent material, and no influence of guano on these contents. 

However, slightly higher content of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in Acid ornithogenic soils in comparison 

to others may be related to more intensive weathering following by leaching of bases and 

accumulation of Fe and Al.  

Mean total heavy metal contents (Table 5) were 17.23 mg kg-1 (As), 7.94 mg kg-1 

(Cd), 76.60 mg kg-1 (Cr), 65.19 mg kg-1 (Cu), 18.54 mg kg-1 (Pb), and 78.91 mg kg-1 (Zn). 

These contents are lower than observed for Pereira (2012), except for Cd. 

. No large difference was observed between soil groups in heavy metal concentration 

(Table 5), indicating predomine influence of parent material lithology on these contents. A 

exemple of that is the higher levels of Zn determined in LR3, LR9 and LR15 belong a Non 

ornithogenic, Neutral and Acid pH ornithogenic group, respectively.  

Concerning metal distribution throughout the profile, contents exhibit irregular and 

non-defined distribution pattern. No reference values for heavy metals in soils from Antarctic 

Maritime are available to comparisons; however paper showing the contamination of heavy 

metals by anthropic actives are studied by Santos et al. (2005, 2007), Chaparro et al. (2007, 

2011) and  Guerra et al. (2011). 

 

Soil mineralogy 

The X-ray diffraction patterns for Non-ornithogenic soils showed the presence of 

chlorite-vermiculite intergrade represent by peaks at 1.5 nm in clay fraction, which was not 

changed after treatments with KCl, Mg and Mg + glycol saturation. However, this peak 

collapsed to 1.00 nm after heating at 350 and 550 °C.   

Minerals from feldspar group, including plagioclases, anorthite, albite and others are 

identified from XDR peaks at 0.375, 0.33, 0.321, 0.318 and 0.303 nm. Presence of feldspar 

minerals in clay fraction it related to incipient leaching process of bases and Si, contributing 

to low chemical alteration in the thermodynamic equilibrium involving Ca, Mg and K. These 

results suggest that although Maritime Antarctic is warmer and wetter than Continental 

Antarctica, chemical weathering process is still limited in this region as well. The absence of 

kaolinite formation is also other evidence of incipient weathering in these Non-ornithogenic 

soils, even though this mineral has been found in few Antarctica soils, mainly in acid sulfate 

soils. No difference in mineralogical composition of non ornithogenic soils was verified 



36 
 

between Gelisols and Inceptsols (LR3 and LR12, respectively) from the same parental 

material (figure 5), what can confirm that beside absence of permafrost in the Non-

ornithogenic Inceptsols, limited chemical weathering occurs only by physicals process of 

pedoturbation and cryoclastic, which are the main process of soil formation in both soils (LR3 

and LR12).  

XRD patterns for clay fraction of LR15, a “neutral pH ornithogenic soil” (Figure 6), 

indicate no mineralogy alteration after short avifauna influence, therefore, despite the high 

amount of P and TOC input by birds, short soil exposure to the penguin rookery was not 

enough to promote phospatization process, which is a transformation of silicate clay minerals 

into phosphates. 

Phosphatization is evident in LR8 (Figure 6), where most silicate clay minerals were 

transformed into crystalline and non-crystalline phosphates, mainly Taranakite. The main 

evidence for this is the complete absence of 2:1 secondary silicate clay minerals, as also 

observed for the majority ornithogenic soil. Taranakite is not well crystallized, because peaks 

disappear after any clay treatment. The clay treatment for XRD analysis is important for 

ornithogenic soils to eliminate confusion between 2:1 and phosphate minerals at 1.6 nm peak.  

The process of weathering transforming primary silicate minerals into 2:1 and after 

into 1:1 minerals is not common for Antarctica ornithogenic soils (Figure 6, LR8). When 

primary minerals are weathered, bases in solution are complexed by phosphate in solution 

reducing bases activity to contents not enough to form secondary minerals. 

LR13 represents an acid sulfide soil formed from sulfide bearing andesites and related 

tills present in the top part of Lions Rump. This site is well-drained and presents clear 

cryoturbation features with presence of dead ice and peculiar yellowish colors. The oxidation 

of sulfides promotes soil acidification, leading to secondary sulfates formation such jarosite 

(Figure 7) and sulphuric horizons similar to those described by Simas et al. (2006) in 

Admiralty Bay. Contrasting results from Simas et al. (2008) who found kaolinite in Antartica 

clay fraction, in Lions Rump this mineral was not detected in acid sulfide soils.  

The presence of clay-sized pyroxene, plagioclase and absence of kaolinite suggest an 

incipient degree of chemical alteration of parent material, despite the advanced acidification 

process (Figure 7). The main secondary silicate clay mineral present in this soil is chlorite-

smectite intergrade, as indicate by peak at 1.5 nm, that is maintained after K saturation, sifted 

to 1.8 nm after Mg+glycol treatment, and collapsed to 1.0 nm after heated to 550 °C. 

Maghemite is also detected, and with jarosite gives the expressive chrome color (10YR 5.5/8). 

Allophane is probably present and is derivate from ashes deposited on the sulphuric materials 



37 
 

and mixed by cryoturbation process. These ashes came from the last eruption in Penguin 

Island, and ash's evidence can be observed covering soils in marine terraces.

According to the WRB system, acid sulfate soils are classified as Turbi–thionic 

Cryosols (Tarnocai et al., 2004). However, as previous observed by Simas et al. (2008), for 

Soil Taxonomy system, sulphuric qualifier is only applicable to Aquiturbels, which is 

definitely not the case for these well drained and oxidized soils. Therefore, our studies 

reinforce the proposal from Simas et al. (2008) to include the Sulphuric Haploturbel to 

classify well drained cryoturbated soils with sulphuric materials in the upper 100 cm depth. 

All soils studied presented high Feo/Fed ratio (Table 6), which usually indicates high 

amounts of poorly crystalline forms and/or soil less developed, according to soil classification 

presented. However, in Lions Rump the highest Feo/Fed value is found for LR8 and LR9, 

both Acid ornithogenic and more developed soils of study area. Predominance of low-

crystallinity Fe minerals in the Antarctica ornithogenic soils, which part of Al and Fe may be 

present as organometallic complexes due to the high soil organic carbon content can explain 

these data, as indicating by Simas et al. (2007).

According to Tatur and Barczuk (1985), “phosphatization” process comprises 

chemical weathering of rock minerals and formation of amorphous Al and Fe minerals. These 

phases react with ornithogenic P, K and N to form amorphous and crystalline secondary 

phosphates and according to Simas et al., 2006, non-crystalline phases are important soil 

components and reach &gt;75% of the clay fraction for some ornithogenic soils.  

Simas et al. (2006) found crystalline phosphates occurring only in soils directly 

affected by penguins (active and abandoned rookeries) as profiles LR9 and LR8 from Lions 

Rump, respectively. The incongruent dissolution of crystalline Al–Fe phosphates with 

formation of amorphous P-rich phases is considered the most common transformation with 

increasing age of abandonment site (Tatur et al., 1997) and maintains high levels of labile P 

forms. On the other hand, at sites lower penguin influence (LR 11, LR15 and LR 23) P inputs 

are lower, and no crystalline phosphates are present. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of 

these sites are controlled by highly reactive non-crystalline P minerals. 

 

 

Soil mapping 

Based on our soil survey we propose a first approximation of the soil map for Lions 

Rump (Figure 8). Soil units mapped in study area were: Lithic Cryorthents (2.55 ha), Typic 

Dystrogelepts ornithic (0.93 ha), Typic Gelifluvents ornithic (1.75 ha), Typic Gelorthents 

ornithic (1.69 ha), Typic Haplogelepts ornithic (9.45 ha), Association: Turbic Haplogelepts 

and Typic Gelorthents (30.91 ha), Association: Oxyaquic Cryopsamments and Vitrandic 

Cryopsamments (15.45 ha), Association: Typic Haplogelepts and Typic Gelorthents (3.44 ha), 

Association: Typic Haploturbels + Lithic Haploturbels (163.86 ha). 

Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main vegetated 

soils in Lions Rump, which possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by 

penguins in Maritime Antarctica. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic maybe represent the deepest, 

most structured and reddish soils so far described in Maritime Antarctica. Typic Haplogelepts 

ornithic represent the main soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle 

Glacier. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present only above 80 m.a.s.l., 

especially on the top areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols from Lions Rump, 

with gelic materials within 100 cm of the soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm from the 

soil surface. Despite their occurrence only at higher altitudes, they represent the largest soil 

cover in the studied area. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present at the edge 

of White Eagle Glacier, where cryoturbation process is more expressive.  

 



43 
 

Figure 8 – Soil map and land covers of Lions Rump, Maritime Antarctic. 



44 
 

Turbic Haplogelepts and Typic Gelorthents are situated between 40 and 80 m.a.s.l., 

without bird nesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 cm in the profile. 

Vitrandic Cryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces 

and former beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited 

areas: Lithic Cryorthents ornithic, present on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) 

close to the beach, and Typic Gelifluvents ornithic represent a small area on glacial alluvial 

fans and Typic Haplorthels represents an acid sulfide soil formed from sulfide bearing 

andesites and related tills present in the top part of Lions Rump. 

 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

At upland sites with no vegetation or ornithogenic influence, soil chemistry and 

mineralogy are related mainly to the physical weathering from basaltic till.  

Ornithogenic influence alters soils characteristics leading to soil acidification, leaching 

of exchangeable bases, transformation of primary minerals and releasing of amorphous Fe 

and Al. These phases react with ornithogenic P, and phosphatization process occurs. This is 

the main soil forming process in Lions Rump and promotes predominantly phosphatic fine 

fraction and a significative increase of soil P pool, with very high levels of labile and 

moderately labile P forms.  

Crystalline Al and Fe phosphates persist in soils even after site abandonment by 

penguins and act as P reserves. 

Haplorthels and Haploturbels are the main soil of Lions Rump situated on the higher 

ice-free areas. 

Higher P and N contents at ornithogenic sites favour vegetation establishment with 

presence of D. antarctica and C. quitensis. High organic carbon contents characterize 

ornithogenic sites as important C sinks at Antarctica terrestrial ecosystems. 

The degree of ornithogenic influence can be assessed through the analysis of soils 

morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics. The study of these characteristics 

allowed the proposal of provisory diagnostic criteria for the ornithogenic qualifier, providing 

a better classification of these unique soils within the WRB and Soil Taxonomy systems.

ABSTRACT 

 

Mineralogy and micropedology of phosphate-rich soils from Lions Rump, Maritime 

Antarctica 

 

Micromorphological and microchemical studies reveal important information 

regarding soil genesis and physicochemical behavior. Although use of techniques as WDS, 

OTM, and SEM be more common for geological purposes, they use in soil studies can reveal 

great information, especially at ornithogenic soils. The present study was carried out at Lions 

Rump where six pedons were selected to represent the main soil types commonly found in 

ice-free areas of King Georg Island, varying from soils devoid vegetation cover to 

ornithogenic soils, all of them with high organic carbon contents. Each pedon was described 

and sampled for micromorphological and microchemical studies, clay mineralogical 

evaluation, and chemistry and physical analyses. Results showed that phosphatization is the 

main process of soil formation in ornithogenic soils, where we can observe phosphatic 

compounds filling soil porous, covering clasts and reacting with minerals forming mainly 

non-crystalline phosphates. The processes of ornithogenesis depend on time of exposure to 

birds influence and the amount of guano depositions on the soil. Due to this characteristic, we 

could separated  the ornithogenic soils in two groups: Acid pH ornithogenic soils and Neutral 

pH ornithogenic soils whereas in the first one the phosphatization was more intense.

INTRODUCTION 

Pedological studies of polar regions, especially in the Antarctica Continental, are one 

of the key issues on the environmental reconstruction of terrestrial landscapes, and can help 

monitoring climate changes. 

Although physical weathering is undoubtless a major soil forming process in Maritime 

Antarctica, chemical weathering also occurs, notably in acid sulphate and ornithogenic soils 

(Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2006). For some ornithogenic soils after these both 

weathering process non-crystalline phases are important soil components and represent over 

75% of the clay fraction (Simas et al., 2006). The ample variation of phosphate minerals in 

the ornithogenic soils of King George Island is probably due to singular environmental 

conditions, such as relatively high precipitation; low temperature; specific chemical 

composition of penguin excreta (especially a high fluorine content); soil water composition 

changes, as a result of periodical nesting of the penguins on the land, and the lack wide 

variety of plants and humus material derived from them (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985). 

In Ornithogenic soils, the phosphatization is the main pedogenic process that causes 

acidity and weathering. P-rich solutions penetrate the frost-induced fractures in the clasts and 

react with mineral soils to form amorphous and crystalline P compounds  

(Schaefer et al., 2008).  

Ornithogenic sites are extremely important and constitute the most important locci of 

C sequestration in Antarctica terrestrial ecosystems (Simas et. al, 2007). Although biomass 

production by the Antarctica vegetation is relatively low, it frequently exceeds the 

decomposition capacity of local microbiota (Ugolini, 1972). Therefore, organic matter 

accumulates at some sites and plays important pedological and ecological roles (Beyer et al., 

1995; Beyer, 2000; Bölter and Kandeler, 2004). 

Scarse information is available about micromorphology of permafrost-affected soils 

from Maritime Antarctica, the wettest and warmest part of Antarctica (Schaefer et al., 2008), 

compared with Arctic soils. Besides the few use for soil scientists, micromorphological and 

microchemical studies can reveal important information regarding soil genesis and 

physicochemical characteristics and relevant data for planning and definition conservation 

strategies for Antarctic environments.  

The objective of this paper was to study soil clay fraction and describe and analyze the 

most important microscopic features of typical cryogenic soils, especially ornithogenic soils, 

from Lions Rump, King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Study area 

Lions Rump is a small peninsula located on the southern coast of King George Bay, 

King George Island, in the South Shetlands Archipelago, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The 

study area is defined as terrestrial land within following coordinates: 62°07’48’’S, 

58°09’17’’W; 62°07’49’’S, 58°07’14’’W; 62°08’19’’S, 58°07’19’’W; and 62°08’16’’S, 

58°09’15’’W (SCAR, 2002). 

The study area was visited in the austral summer of 2009/2010, during Brazilian 

Antarctic Expeditions. During field work, 26 pedons representing the main soil types 

identified in ice-free areas of Lions Rump were described and sampled, based on criteria 

established by Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic Permafrost, Soils and Periglacial Environments 

Group (ANTPAS 2006) and considering geomorphological features.  

From 26, six pedons were selected to represent the main soil types commonly found in 

ice-free areas of Lions Rump (Table 1), varying from soils devoid vegetation cover to 

ornithogenic soils with relative high organic carbon contents. Each pedon was described and 

sampled for micromorphological and microchemical studies, clay mineralogical evaluation, 

and chemistry and physical analyses.

Pedons selected were located from 19 to 62 m a.s.l., with vegetation cover varying 

from rare to relative exuberant vegetation, formed by different combinations and proportions 

of Deschampsia antarctica (Gramineae), Colobanthus quitensis (Cariofilaceae), mosses; 

Usnea sp. (lichen); Syntrichia princeps (Bryophyta) and Prasiola crispa (algae). 

Considering field observations and analytic results, soils of Lions Rump were 

separated into three groups: Acid pH ornithogenic soils (LR7, LR8, LR9), Neutral pH 

ornithogenic soils (LR11, LR15), and Non-ornithogenic soil (LR3).  

The ahumic soil (LR3) a Turbic Haplogelepts the only profile of the Non-ornithogenic 

soil group was selected for this study to be used as comparison represent a soil without 

avifauna influence (Figure 2). It was the chosen one due to be very representative for the other 

soils Non-ornithogenic as Cryorthents, Haplogelepts, Gelorthents, Haplorthels, Haploturbels, 

Gelifluvents and Cryopsamments widespread throughout the area. 

In Lions Rump, LR7, LR8 and LR9 are located on sites developed from andesitic 

rocks that gave the name to the peninsula, and possibly represents one of the first ice-free 

areas colonized by penguins in Antarctica (Figure 2). Soils of LR7 and LR8 are from 

abandoned penguin rookeries covered by exuberant vegetation of Deschampsia, thick O 

horizon and well-developed profile with reddish color indicating advanced weathering status. 

Soil LR9 is from a recently abandoned penguin rookeries covered by incipient vegetation, 

mostly covered by Prasiola. 

LR11 and LR15 are present at areas with more recently exposure to ornithogenic 

influence, especially at uplifted terrace and Quaternary moraines, respectively (Figure 2). 

 

Chemical, physical and mineralogical analyses 

Soil pH, exchangeable nutrients and texture were determined for&amp;lt;2 mm air-dried 

samples according to EMBRAPA (1997). Exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ were extracted 

with 1 mol L-1 KCl and P, Na and K with Mehlich-1 solution extractant (0.05 mol L-1 HCl + 

0.0125 mol L-1 H2SO4). Elements contents were determined by atomic absorption 

spectrometry (Ca, Mg and Al), flame emission spectrometry (K and Na) and colorimetry 

method (P). H+Al was determined after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 calcium acetate solution 

buffered at pH 7.0 by titration with 0.0025 mol L- 1 HCl (EMBRAPA, 1997). Organic matter 

(OM) was determined on&amp;lt;0.5 mm samples by wet combustion (Yeomans and Bremner, 

1988). Soil texture was obtained after dispersion of&amp;lt;2 mm samples in NaOH solution, 

sieving of coarse and fine sand, sedimentation of silt and clay fractions with adaptations for 

clay dispersion (Ruiz, 2005).

Clay fraction of selected profiles was submitted to selective digestion with boiling 

NaOH 5 mol L-1 for 90 min to concentrate and better characterize iron oxides, according 

Kämpf &amp;amp; Schwertmann (1982). 

The X-ray analyses were performed on a X'Pert Pro diffractometer model PW 

3040/60, x-ray tube ceramic, solid-state detector X'Celerator, long fine focus, equipped with 

cobalt anode, Co-K? radiation (? = 1, 79026 Å), operated with 40 kV and 30 mA. The 

powdered clay samples were placed and lightly pressed on the holder, avoiding clay 

orientation, scanned from 0 to 50 o2? with 0.05 o2? increments and 2 seconds of counting 
time in each step. 

 

Micromorphology and microchemical studies 

Undisturbed soil samples (5 × 10 cm) from some selected soil horizons were sampled 

in field and transport to the laboratory, where were impregnated with 1:1 crystic resin:stiren 

mix poured at atmospheric pressure and temperature. Impregnated samples were cut into slabs 

of 0.5 cm thickness using a diamond saw, and polished with corundum abrasives from 250 to 

600 mesh. After ultrasonic cleaning, the polished blocks were mounted onto glass slides 

followed by polishing and hand-finishing to produce 30 nm thick sections. All procedures 

were carried according to Schaefer et al. (2008). The description of the microstructure was 

made using a HITACHI S-3400N scanning electron microscope with a Thermo Noran EDS 

spectrometer equipped with SYSTEM SIX. Quantitative electron probe microanalysis by 

wavelength dispersive spectrometry was performed with a 5 spectrometer Cameca SX51 

electron probe in Geoscience Department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA. 

Samples and standards were carbon coated with ~200 Å carbon. Operating conditions were 15 

kV accelerating voltage with a (Faraday cup) beam current of 4 nA. Natural and synthetic 

mineral standards were used background positions. Automation and matrix corrections were 

performed with probe for EPMA software (Donovan et al, 2010; Armstrong, 1995). 

Pedological features of the soil horizons at OTM level were analysed using standard 

micromorphological techniques (Bullock et al., 1985).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Chemical, physical and mineralogical properties 

Soils from Lions Rump were formed by the weathering of basalt-andesitic rocks and 

present apatite as mineral accessory providing phosphorus and exchangeable bases as 

indicated by non-ornithogenic soils, which do not have avifauna influence, but present high 

contents of Ca, Mg, K and P (Table 2).  

The soils from penguin rookeries and adjacent areas (LR7, LR8, LR9, LR11 and 

LR15) are more developed than soil with no fauna influence (LR3). Stony/pebbly pavements 

are present in all sites but are often hidden by the well-developed and continuous vegetation. 

Clear horizon differentiation occurs and a relatively deep organic matter-rich A horizons and 

phosphatic B horizons were easily identified. Surface horizons are dark and yellowish brown 

as a result of humus incorporation similar to other ornithogenic soils described by Simas et al. 

(2007) and Michel et al. (2006) in other areas from King George Island. 

The content of fine particles no differs between soil groups (Table 2). As weathering 

processes are different, in essence, and intensity, this similarity can be associated to genesis 

from different source materials. It was expected that soils more pedogenetic develop (Acid pH 

ornithogenic) had higher content of fine particles, but  LR7, LR8 and LR9 profiles are 

derivated from basaltic bedrock, whilst LR11 and LR15 are former under moraine compound 

by mixed materials, especially basaltic-andesitic with advanced materials fragmentation, and 

LR3 are formed from basaltic-andesitic materials covering a plateau. 

All ornithogenic soils have much more TOC contents than the non-ornithogenic one 

(LR3), a clear evidence of the avifauna contribution to C pool. Among ornithogenic soil, sites 

dominated by D. antarctica and C. quitensis (LR7, LR8, LR11 and LR15) presented more 

TOC contents  in depth horizons, because lignine-bearing tissues and root systems presence. 

Acid pH ornithogenic soils (LR7, LR8, and LR9) are easily distinguished from the 

non-ornithogenic soil (LR3) by several features, such as presence on the field of continuous 

vegetation cover with D. antarctica, C. quitensis and/or Prasiola crispa; and also for lower 

pH and bases saturation; high OM contents, Melich-1 extractable-P, and exchangeable Al 

(Table 2). Chemical characteristics of ornithogenic soils are strongly affected by sea-land 

transfers by birds, mostly penguins, through deposition of large amounts of guano during 

austral summer. In these soils, a particular and complex process of deep soil 

“phosphatization” occurs, which has been described in details by Tatur and Barczuk (1985), 

Tatur (1989), Schaefer et al. (2004), and Simas et al. (2007).

Acid pH ornithogenic soils (LR7, LR8, and LR9) are easily distinguished from the 

non-ornithogenic soil (LR3) by several features, such as presence in the field of continuous 

vegetation cover with D. Antarctica, C. quitensis and/or Prasiola crispa; and also for lower pH 

and bases saturation; high OM contents, Melich-1 extractable-P, and exchangeable Al (Table 

2). Chemical characteristics of ornithogenic soils are strongly affected by sea-land transfers 

by birds, mostly penguins, through deposition of large amounts of guano during austral 

summer. In these soils, a particular and complex process of deep soil “phosphatization” 

occurs, which has been described in details by Tatur and Barczuk (1985), Tatur (1989), 

Schaefer et al. (2004), and Simas et al. (2007). 

Neutral pH ornithogenic soils (LR11 and LR16) no present these standards 

ornithogenic characteristics described before, taking place from parental material rich in 

exchangeable bases at low altitude and close to the sea. These high contents of bases, 

including Na, promotes a buffering effect on the soil profile, reducing acidity, and 

consequently, reducing mineral weathering and leaching of nutrients. Soils with high content 

of bases, high buffer potential, which remains proximity to neutral pH, disfavor phosphate 

minerals crystallization, like as observed in soils LR11 and LR15 (Figure 6). Despite high 

levels of P extract with Melich-1 and morphological features (Table 3), both characteristics of 

ornithogenic soils, these soils do not contain crystalline phosphates minerals; therefore, we 

can expect phosphate minerals similar to amorphous forms. Maybe all phosphates are 

removed from soil solution by, and no enough excess is present in solution to form crystalline 

phosphates minerals (Figure 6).  

The principal difference between acid and neutral ornithogenic soils is the time of soil 

exposure to avifauna influence, and the amount of bird excrement accumulated. 

According to Tatur and Barczuk (1985), “phosphatization” comprises chemical 

weathering of rock minerals and formation of amorphous Al and Fe minerals. These phases 

react with ornithogenic P, K and N to form amorphous and crystalline secondary phosphates. 

Simas et al. (2006) found crystalline phosphates occurring only in soils directly affected by 

penguins (active and abandoned rookeries). The incongruent dissolution of crystalline Al–Fe 

phosphates with formation of amorphous P-rich phases is considered the most common 

transformation with the increasing age of site abandonment (Tatur et al., 1997) and maintains 

high levels of labile P forms.

The formation of crystalline phosphate minerals are found exclusively in the upper soil 

layers (LR8 and LR9), more humid than deeper horizons, which receives directly the 

contribution coming from bird's organic excreta, although high content of P is found in the 

whole profile. 

All ornithogenic soils from Lions Rump presented high contents of P in deeper layers, 

which indicate high P translocation in soils with high cation exchange capacity (CEC), and 

that not all P-rich subsurface horizons are buried horizons like some profiles found by Michel 

et al. (2006), at Copacabana, Admiralty Bay. Similar results observed in Lions Rump were 

found by Schaefer et al. (2008), Simas et al. (2007), Myrcha and Tatur (1991).  

In the ornithogenic soils, X-ray diffractions showed clearly “phosphatization” of the 

profile, especially for LR8 and LR9. Despite Tatur and Keck (1990) had verified high range 

of phosphate minerals in Maritime Antarctic soils, the major minerals identified in Lions 

Rump were taranakite (mainly), leucophosphite and minyulite (Figure 3). Similarly, Simas et 

al. (2006) also found few minerals in soils from Admiralty Bay, basically metavariscite, 

leucophosphite and minyulite. Besides the high variety of mineral phosphates found at 

Maritime Antarctic as described by Tatur and Keck (1990) and Barczuk and Tatur (2003), 

most part of them were found just in some specific sites in others Maritime Antarctica areas. 

Leucophosphite formation appears is related to guano and silicate minerals interaction 

(Wilson and Bain, 1976), conditions verified in Lions Rump. DRX peaks of these minerals at 

LR9 confirm this indication, and peaks were similar to that observed by Wilson and Bain 

(1976) and Tatur and Barczuk (1985) at Elephant Island and King George Island, 

respectively. According to Myrcha and Tatur (1991), minyulite occurrence is typical in the 

upper and middle portions of phosphatized zone, where Fe is entirely leached from the soil by 

strong action of guano solutions, which simultaneously supplied also high quantities of 

fluorine. These conditions are present in ornithogenic areas of Lions Rump, especially at LR9 

(Figure 3). 

Taranakite occurrence is typical for deep and acid soils, under a wet regime (Myrcha 

and Tatur, 1991). DRX peaks of taranakite are observed in Acid pH ornithogenic soils, with 

an exception for LR7. For this profile, although peaks are not identified, similar elementar 

concentration that suggests taranakite presence is determined by EDS analysis (Table 3), 

indicating this phosphate mineral presence, but maybe in not well crystallinyzed form. 

In the absence of ornithogenic activity, soil chemical weathering in Antarctic is less 

pronounced and soils present chemical and mineralogical characteristics greatly influenced by 

the parent material (Simas et al., 2004, 2007; Schaefer et. al., 2008; Michel et al., 2006). For 



61 
 

Lions Rump soils without avifauna influence, weathering of parent material promote soil 

formation with high pH, salinity and Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents, as can be exemplified by LR3 

(Table 2).  

On the other hand, high guano inputs generate an acid environment, which becomes 

progressively less acid with soil development, following rookery abandonment. Guano is 

initially alkaline, but microbial degradation generates acidity. However, when sites are 

abandoned and no fresh guano further input is observed, mineral weathering and high 

amounts of OM can neutralize part of the acidity, resulting in a more buffered soil (Michel et 

al. 2006). However, in Lions Rump this expect was not confirmed for LR7 and LR8 profiles, 

probably due to high inclination of these sites, which can favor superficial guano erosion 

avoiding and/or reducing bases accumulation and the buffering effect. In Lions Rump, even 

the more evolved soils (LR7 and LR8) still have lower pH values due to the advanced stage of 

weathering in comparison other ones, transforming 2:1 clay silicates into phosphates. LR7 has 

reddish-brown color (5YR 5/3) at horizon B, what can indicate the more action of 

pedogenesis of this soil in comparison to others, what probably due to crystalline phosphates 

weathering remains only amorphous form of P and hematite.  

XRD patterns of LR15 sample, a “neutral pH ornithogenic soil” (Figure 3), indicate no 

mineralogy alteration after short avifauna influence, therefore, despite the high amount of P 

and TOC input by birds, short soil exposure to the penguin rookery was not enough to 

promote phospatization process, which is a transformation of silicate clay minerals into 

phosphates. 

Phosphatization process is evident in LR8 profile (Figure 3), which all silicate clay 

minerals were transformed into crystalline and non-crystalline phosphates, mainly Taranakite. 

The main evidence for this is the complete absence of 1:1 secondary silicate clay minerals, as 

also observed in the most part of ornithogenic soils. Weathering process transforming primary 

silicate minerals into 2:1 and after into 1:1 minerals is not common for Antarctica 

ornithogenic soils (Figure 3, P7 and P8). When primary minerals are weathered, bases in 

solution are complexed by phosphate in solution reducing bases activity to contents not 

enough to form secondary aluminium silicates minerals. 

Observing DRX results from clay fraction previously submitted to selective digestion 

with boiling NaOH 5 mol L-1 (Figure 4), we noted this procedure to concentrate iron oxides 

works better for well evolved tropical soils with clay fraction dominated by oxides and 1:1 

clay silicates. For incipient soils, this procedure can not remove primary minerals and 2:1 

silicates, and DRX show for all soils peaks of quartz, and minerals from feldspar and 



62 
 

montmorillonite groups. Hematites are found at Acid ornithogenic soils because are more 

development soils and at LR3. Magnetite was detected in LR3, LR7 and LR8, confirming 

indicious previous indicate by magnet use. Presence of magnetite and as well anatase is 

expected because this soil is originated from basalt (Figure 4). Goethite, Maghemite and 

others iron oxides are not detected. 

 

Micromorphology  

Soil matrix of Lions Rump profiles are composed mostly for mineral from weathering 

of igneous rocks. Soil structure is formed mainly by secondary minerals such as 2:1 minerals 

like vermiculite and montmorillonite (Figure 3) with presence of Si-rich fractured clasts 

mainly plagioclases with Fe oxides as accessory minerals (Figures 4 and 5). Selected samples 

of some horizons from ornithogenic soils used for OTM and SEM studies illustrate typical 

features for LR3, LR7, LR8 (Figure 5, Table 3), and LR9 and LR11 (Figure 6 and Table 4).  

LR3, a non-ornithogenic soil, little-altered rock fragments and mineral weathering 

occur, with dominance amphibolite rich in Mg (Figure 5). Phosphorus is present just inside 

structure of fragments of clasts and aggregates of basaltic and andesitc materials.  

Soil profile LR7 exhibit moderate subangular blocky structure with phosphate material 

filling the voids (Figure 5). Pedon LR8AB presents subangular blocky structure abundant 

coated and filled by phosphate materials, matrix formed by 2:1 and phosphates minerals, with 

clasts of plagioclases rich in Na and small and highly fragmented minerals rich in Ca and Mg 

until 70 cm depth. Downward in the B2 horizon these clasts are larger and less fragmented 

with phosphates material presence only at the edges of minerals in contact with macropores 

(Figure 5). In LR9, the P-rich solution penetrates filling voids and around the clast, mainly 

plagioclases, forming a framework of phosphatic rims around these materials, with soil matrix 

formed preferentially by Al-Fe-K phosphate in crystalline and non-crystalline form (Figure 

6). According to Schaefer et al. (2008), this reaction with P-rich solutions leads to the 

progressive displacement of Si from rock minerals, and consequently, enhanced chemical 

weathering.

For LR11 and LR15 samples, clasts are angular to sub-angular in the coarser size 

fractions (&gt;2 mm) and present greater degree of rounding and sphericity with decreasing 

particle size (Figure 6). Plagioclases are the main phenocryst mineral and vary from fresh and 

unaltered to strongly altered and corroded grains. These minerals are normally surrounded by 

Si-amorphous with presence of Al and Fe materials, as indicated by the elemental maps and 

quantitative EDS analysis (Figure 6, Table 4). Pyroxenes are also common phenocrysts 

(Figure 6). Bone fragments are also common at LR11 (Table 4). Besides the great amount of 

P exctact by Melich-1, phosphates are not detected in DRX or SEM images at LR11 and 

LR15. Although penguins aport great amount of P and N what favor vegetation growth, 

maybe the time of rookery and the number of individuals presents in these penguins colony 

are not enough to input high increments of P and form phosphates compounds.  

OTM images and semi-quantitative EDS analysis can help the soil scientists to better 

understand soil compounds and structure. In our case, microstructure of these typical frost-



68 
 

affected soils and ornithogenic soils present a particular type of globular, rounded aggregates, 

under strong biological influence. Phosphates phases occur as illuvial coatings, in fillings and 

within discrete aggregates. In LR7 (Table 3), we can note a clear presence of P compounds 

filling the voids (Id 1) rounding aggregates (Id 2), and covering minerals as plagioclases, 

quartz (Id 9) and pyroxenes (Table 3). Most part of illuvial phosphatic features (Id 6 and 7) is 

formed by non-crystalline forms of aluminium phosphate with close to 60 % of P. In LR8 the 

P-rich solution penetrates into the cracks and cleavage planes and reacts preferentially with 

plagioclases, which is the main mineral of the soil matrix (Id 4, 5 and 6, LR8B2, Table 3). We 

can observe phosphates covering the silicates minerals and the weathering process of this 

mineral (Id 8, Table 3). At LR 9, the soil matrix is mainly phosphatic, formed by aluminium-

iron phosphate non-crystalline involving clasts of Na-plagioclases (LR9, Table 4). In LR11 

soil, matrix is formed by a mixed of minerals well-rounded and fragmented due to cryoclastic 

process and transport by the glacier (Table 4). As a residual of avifauna influence on the soil 

formation process, a piece of bone can be observed in some profiles (Id 1, LR112Bi, Table 4). 

The dispersive spectrometry (WDS) for LR7 Cr (Table 5) indicate the presence of low 

crystalline aluminion phosphate as the main phosphate mineral filling the voids of this soil 

horizon, what is confirmed by XDR analyses (Figure 3) that no indicates peaks of crystalline 

phosphates as taranakite, leucophosphite, minuiylite and others as identified in different areas 

of Maritime Antarctica by Tatur and Keck (1990) and Barczuk and Tatur (2003). How already 

showed by Simas et al. (2006) uncrystalinium phosphate are the main component of clay 

fraction of ornithogenic soils. Due to the high acidity and leaching probably the crystalline 

phosphates are instable in these chemical soil conditions.  

WDS data for LR9 Cr (Table 6) indicate Taranakite (K3Al5(HPO4)6(PO4)2.18(H2O)) as 

the main phosphate mineral filling the space porous of this soil horizon, what is confirmed by 

XDR analyses (Figure 3). Results from WDS point analyses are quite homogenous and 

representing low deviations of Taranakite chemical composition. However, studies from Tatur 

(1989) and Tatur and Keck (1990) with phosphates of Antarctica ornithogenic soils identified 

ammonium in Taranakite, but no N peaks were detected in this mineral in our samples from 

Lions Rump. Phosphates phases occur as illuvial coatings, in fillings and within discrete 

aggregates. In all secondary phases, chemical variably is greater but in general follow 

descrescent content for Fe&gt;K&gt;P&gt;Al, and vary depending on the primary mineral that the 

solution rich in P will react to form phosphates.

ABSTRACT 

 

Climate change impacts the biotic and abiotic components of polar ecosystems, 

particularly on permafrost, active layer thickness, vegetation, and soil properties. This paper 

describes the active layer thermal regimes of two shallow boreholes, geographical and 

altitudinal adjacent, present the same soil class but have a different vegetation cover. The 

boreholes are situated in the Lions Rump area at King George Island, Maritime Antarctic, 

region that represents one of the most sensitive to climate change and is located near the 

climatic limit of permafrost, since mean annual air temperature at sea level is close to -2°C. 

The limited knowledge about ground temperature conditions led a recent effort to increase 

active layer and permafrost research in the Antarctic. Both study sites are in a Turbic Cambic 

Cryosol formed by andesitic parent material, one under moss vegetation (85 m a.s.l) and 

another under lichen (86 m a.s.l). Ground temperature series were collected at 1-hour 

intervals, recorded during two years, from March 2009 to February 2011. In both boreholes, 

a network of three soil temperatures sensors were installed at 10, 30 and 80 cm depths, one 

moisture sensor at 80 cm depth, and one air temperature sensor at 100 cm height above soil. 

Two sites showed significant differences in mean annual ground temperature for all depths. 

The lichen site shows higher soil temperature amplitude than lichen site, present in ground 

surface the highest daily temperature in January 2011 (7.34 °C) and a lowest daily 

temperature in August (- 16.54 °C). The soil temperature at lichen site followed variability 

of air temperate. The Moss site shows higher water content at bottommost monitored layer 

because is located at water track position on the landscape. The buffer effect on Moss site 

happens because of the high content of water available associated with the moss vegetation 

and snow cover. The active layer in both sites of Lions Rump is thick and both boreholes did 

not reach the permafrost table, but still above 2 m depth what characterized Gelisol/Cryosol.

INTRODUCTION 

Understand distribution and properties of Antarctic permafrost is essential for the 

cryospheric sciences, but also for life sciences, since it will be a major control on ecosystem 

modification following climate-induce changes (Vieira et al. 2010). 

Permafrost-affected soils normally present an active layer, which is defined as the 

portion of soil which experiences seasonal thawing and freezing (Brown et al., 2000). It is 

through this layer that, in response to a thermal gradient; heat flows between the atmosphere 

and permafrost. Permafrost, defined as any subsurface earth materials remaining below 0°C 

for more than two years, may be affected profoundly by global warming (Hinkel et. al., 2001). 

Climate is a first-order control on permafrost temperatures with local microclimate 

also substantially affecting ground surface temperatures, and therefore, the thermal regime of 

the permafrost. At a local scale, ground surface and permafrost temperatures are affected by 

the characteristics of the snowpack, the type and height of vegetation, moisture content in the 

ground, topography, the geothermal flux, and the thermal conductivity of the earth materials 

(Judge, 1973). Permafrost and vegetation are key environmental components and both are 

sensitive to climate change (Guglielmin et al., 2008), particularly where the permafrost it has 

a discontinuous distribution (Burgess et al., 2000) what occur in Maritime Antarctica. 

Periglacial regions are highly sensitive to climate change. Maritime Antarctica has 

been increasingly recognized as a key region for monitoring climate change (Cannone et al., 

2006; Vieira et al., 2010). The limited knowledge of the ground temperature conditions led a 

recent effort to increase active layer and permafrost research in the Antarctic.  

The continued monitoring of soil temperature in polar regions allows the identification 

of important variables, such as the duration and intensity of the thawing and freezing periods 

(Michel et al., 2012). Specific investigations focusing on the relationships between vegetation 

and permafrost as a sensitive indicator of climate change are still lacking (Cannone et al., 

2006).  

The aim of this paper is elucidated the influence of vegetation cover on hydrothermal 

soil behavior and describes the active layer thermal regime of two shallow boreholes of a 

Turbic Cambic Cryosol located at 85 m.a.s.l, under two contrasting vegetation types located 

five meters apart: a moss carpet (Andrea gainii) site and a Lichen community site.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Regional characteristics 

The study sites are located at Lions Rump peninsula in King George Island, King 

George Bay, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The both sites are located in a soil classified as

1), which correspond to loamy-skeletal, mixed, subgelic, Typic Haplorthels and sandy-

skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, according to the Soil Taxonomy (SSSA, 2003). Both sites is 

in the same altitude, have a loamy-sand texture (Table 2) and are different only in landscape 

position and vegetation cover: the moss carpet (mainly formed by Andrea gainii) site in the 

lower landscape position (water track), and the Lichen community site, dominated by Usnea 

antarctic and Ochrolechia frigida and located in a small terrain undulation (inter-area track). 

Vegetation cover more than 70 % of the soil surface at both sites (Figure 2).

According to Köppen's classification, the region is part of the tundra climate (ET). 

Data sets acquired at the Brazilian Commandant Ferraz, nearby station from Lions Rump, 

report mean air temperatures varying from –6.4 °C in July to +2.3 °C in February. Mean 

annual precipitation is proximally to 400 mm (Simas et al., 2007), but the real soil water 

regime is highly influenced by its position in the landscape, due to the intense melting of 

snow, glaciers and permafrost sites upstream during the summer. The temperature remains 

above freezing almost all summer (November to March) allowing the vigorous growth of 

plant communities, mainly mosses, lichens and algae (Schaefer et al., 2004). 

Results from International Polar Year (IPY) permafrost temperature monitoring shows 

South Shetland Islands with permafrost temperatures slightly below 0°C at low elevations, 

with values decreasing to about -1.8°C at 270 m.a.s.l. and 25 m depth. The lowest coastal 

terrain near sea level is essentially permafrost free (Vieira et al., 2010). 

In general soils from Lions Rump present incipient and poorly evolved when classified 

by WRB and Soil Taxonomy. In the study area, we found Ornithogenic Soils, mainly 

Cryosols/Gelisols at highest landscape portions, and Cambisol/Inceptsol and (Regosols, 

Arenosols, Leptsols)/Entsols widespread in the lowland area. 

 

 

2.2. Methods 

In summer of 2009, boreholes were dug and the active layer monitoring sites were 

installed in both sites. Monitoring systems were formed by thermistors (TYPE E, CHROMEL 

CONSTANT TERMOCOUPLE, accuracy of ±0.2 °C) arranged in a vertical array at different 

depths (Table 3); soil moisture probes (CS616 WATER CONTENT REFLECTOMETER, 

accuracy of ±2.5%) placed at the bottommost layer at each site (80 cm deep in both 

boreholes) to determine the volumetric water content; and air temperature sensor (107 

TEMPERATURE PROBE) installed at 100 cm above the soil surface. All probes were 

connected to a Campbell Scientific CR 1000 data logger that recorded data at hourly intervals 

from April, 2009 to January, 2011. 

The characteristics of the monitored sites are presented in Table 1. Temperature soil 

probes are installed in the same deep for both sites (10, 30 and 80 cm). The depth of the 

probes was established respecting pedological differentiation of horizons.  

Multivariable regression was performed in order to describe soil temperature at 80 cm 

from temperatures of two first layers and air temperature, using Statistica® software (Statsoft, 



79 
 

2009). To try predict soil temperature from superficial sensors in Antartica conditions is so 

interesting for future studies that can not reach depth layers. 

We calculated the thawing days (days in which all hourly measurements are positive 

and at least one reading is warmer than +0.5 °C), and freezing days (days in which all hourly 

measurements are negative and at least one reading is colder than ?0.5 °C); the number of 

isothermal days (days in which all the hourly measurements range only between ±0.5 °C); the 

number of freeze–thaw days (days inwhich there are both negative and positive temperatures 

with at least one value greater than ±0.5 °C); the thawing degree days (obtained by the 

cumulative sum of the mean daily temperatures above 0 °C); the freezing degree days 

(obtained by the cumulative sum of the mean daily temperatures below 0 °C); all according to 

Guglielmin et al. (2008).  

To better assess the influence of the average thickness of the snow, estimate of the 

index N factor (FN) was carried. The index FN relates air temperature with the ground surface 

and can be calculated for the seasons' periods of fusion (thawing degree days) or freezing 

(freezing degre days) of the soil (Riseborough, 2003). From results from the soil Freezing 

Degree Days at 10 cm (FDD) and air (FDDa) was calculated index FN, in this case only for 

the time of freezing, with equation: FN = FDD/FDDa. Soil temperature of 10 cm was selected 

due to be monitored depth closest to the soil surface. Since the temperatures (soil and air) in 

some periods during the year are not simultaneously positive or negative, it is therefore, 

necessary to definer “FN station" or freezing station (Nieuwendam, 2009). 

Active layer thickness was calculated as the 0 °C depth by extrapolating the thermal 

gradient from the two deepest temperature measurements (Guglielmin, 2006). 

The apparent thermal diffusivity was estimated from equation of McGaw et al. (1978): 

? = [?Z2 / 2?t] x [(Tij+1- Tij-1) / (Tji-1- 2Tj1 + Tji+1)], where ? = apparent thermal diffusivity (m2 

s?1), ?t = time increments (s), ?Z = space increments (m), T = temperature, j = temporal 

position and i = depth position. Nelson et al. (1985), Outcalt and Hinkel (1989), Hinkel et al. 

(1990, 2001) and Michel et al. (2012) used this parameter to assess resistance to energy flux 

in soil profiles. Hourly estimates were made for intermediate depths of both profiles, and 

mean values were calculated and plotted for each day (Figure 3C).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

Although both sites are similar in terms of latitude, altitude and climatic events, soil 

thermal regime was considerably different when comparing the influence of two soil cover 

(Figure 3). The contrasting behavior regarding to water content and soil temperature are 

attributed to the vegetation cover and location of sites on the landscape. Compare the soil 

location as an agriculture terrace, the Moss site is situated in the furrow (water track) and the 

Lichen site is located on the ridge (inter-area track) (Figure 2). These quite differences in 

position promote great diffences in soil hidrotermic regime. 

 

3.1. Mosses carpet site 

The highest soil temperature at this site was 12.08 °C (Table 3), not registered for the 

top soil layer but at 30 cm deep in January 20th 2010 at 2:00 PM, while highest mean daily air 

temperature was 11.07 °C recorded on January 3rd 2011 at 4:00 PM. Soil water content 

ranged from approximately 0.60 m3 m-3% in summer to 0.30 %m3 m-3 in winter (Figure 3A). 

The presence of water in the freezing and frozen active layer and near the permafrost table 

protects the ground from rapid cooling and creates a strong thermal gradient (Romanovsky 

and Osterkamp, 2000) due to the water high latent heat. 

Mean annual temperatures of ?0.53 °C, ?0.51 °C and ?0.56 °C were found for the 

increasing depths (10 cm, 30 cm and 80 cm, respectively). The maximum and minimum 

temperatures (hourly records) for the bottommost layer (depth of 80 cm) were 7.15 °C and 

?4.79 °C, respectively (Table 3). This high temperature (7.15 °C) in depth favors active layer 

and our data show Lions Rump with a deeper active layer of King George Island for this 

altitude until now studied. Positive monthly mean temperatures at 80 cm occurred from 

January until April 2010, and started early in the next spring, at November 2010. A chill 

occurs in midsummer in February slowing the soil warming (Tables 3 and 4).

Permafrost starts at 147.26 cm (estimated ALT), as it is defined as a layer which 

remains frozen (below 0 °C) for two consecutive years. Although frequent daily freeze and 

thaw cycles were observed, the active layer remains predominantly unfrozen until the end of 

March 2009, when the temperature decreases close to 0.0 °C, coinciding with beginning of 

thermal autumn (Figure 3C), when occurs the so-called zero curtain regime (Hinkel et al., 

2001), that keeps the temperature close to 0.0 °C until the upper layer is complely frozen at 

the end of May. The zero curtain regime refers to a period in autumn when the active layer is 

refreezing from the top-down and from the bottom up. Penetration of the freezing fronts is 

inhibited by the release of the latent heat of fusion, and thermal fluctuations occurring on the 

surface are strongly attenuated at shallow depths. Upon completion of the phase change, the 

continual removal of heat results in a temperature reduction (Hinkel et al. 2001). In the next 

year, 2010, the active layer remains predominantly unfrozen until April 17th 2010, when the 

temperature decreases again close to 0.0 °C, and over again coinciding with beginning of the 

thermal autumn andzero curtain regime that extends until June 5th 2010. After this time, 

temperature decrease and upper soil layer frozen, with complete freezing until 80 cm depth at 

the end of June. During thermal autumn, the freezing front did not reach the complete active 

layer depth. Only after June 23rd, soil presents consistent negative temperatures at the 80 cm 

depth, indicating complete freezing of the active layer. Further cooling occurred during the 

winter season, with soil temperatures decreasing to a minimum of ?6.47 °C at 10 cm and 

?4.79 °C at 80 cm depth.  

Spring's thermal regime starts at end of September, with soil temperature rising 

rapidly, especially for the top soil layer, starting at ?4.1 °C on August 21st and reaching 0 °C 

on October 26th. Differently from the freezing during autumn which shows a delay between 

the top and bottommost layers, the thawing phenomenon practically occurred simultaneously 

in whole active layer. During all year, the temperature amplitude between the top and 

bottommost sensor was low, reaching a maximum positive of 7.7 °C on December 9th 2009 

and negative

maximum amplitude of -4.27 °C on June 7th 2010, which coincides with the beginning of 

summer and winter, respectively. In periods as ends of March and June (autumn) and October 

(middle spring) are the time of minor thermal amplitude with temperature in whole active 

layer close to 0 °C, where the curtain regime happens. 

The water content is highly variable ranging from around 0.13 m3 m-3 in the winter to 

50 m3 m-3 in the summer (Figure 3A). These high contents of soil water can be explained 

because the site is located in the water trap, where the meltdown of snow and thawing of 

active layer supply water to this soil portion. The water content follows the zero curtain 

regime, which means that just when the soil reaches temperatures above liquefaction the 

water content increases quickly (Figure 3A). The same occurs when the soil starts to freezing, 

i.e., the water content just decreases when soil temperature goes below the freezing point. 



85 
 

The soil thermal regime provides useful data to evaluate the physical state of soil 

moisture and, traditionally, simple approaches have been adopted providing proxy measures 

at the phase state of soil moisture (Guglielmin et al., 2008). Among these, the “isothermal 

days” indicate that the energy in the ground is consumed to change the water phase both 

during thawing and freezing, when latent heat exchange produces the “zero curtain effect” 

(Outcalt et al., 1990). In a similar way, the “frozen days” and the “thawed days” indicate 

when the soil moisture is frozen or in a liquid state. Moreover, the “freeze–thaw days” 

describe days in which freeze–thaw cycles may occur (Guglielmin et al., 2008). 

The thawing days varied from 104 days at 10 cm of depth to 123 at the deeper layers 

(Table 4), and did not vary much between layers studied. The thawing days are concentrated 

in summer and begging autumn. Tendency of isothermal days was to increase in depths, 

reaching 188 days at 80 cm, what was expected because permafrost and the higher water soil 

content are close, promoting the thermal buffer effect (Table 5). At the depth of 10 cm, two 

freeze–thaw days occurred whilst the others depths only happen one freeze–thaw day. 

Thawing and freezing cumulative degree days provide an estimate of the net energy flux in 

the studied sites. Comparison of the 10 cm thawing degree days (236 degree days) and 

freezing degree days (?435 degree days) indicated predominantly freezing conditions (Table 

6). At the bottom of the profile, the thawing degree days totalized 191 degree days, while 

freezing degree days totalized ?516 degree days, during the monitoring time between March 

2009 until January 2011, but only on a period than one year from December 2009 (summer) 

to November 2010 (spring) thawing degree days presented 123 degree days, while freezing 

degree days presented ?224 degree days. Therefore, for this soil freezing conditions are 

almost twice than thawing conditions during the four seasons during the year (Table 6). 

Summer's thawing is also affected by this buffering effect at the same depth, but with less 

intensity, possibly due to high amounts of ground ice accumulating over the permafrost table 

(Michel et al., 2012). 

Thermal diffusivity was estimated for intermediate depth (30 cm) for each hour, 

although in Figure 3C is reported as daily mean value. Since it was calculated from the 

observed temperatures, and includes the thermal impact of nonconductive heat transfer, it is 

more properly referred as the apparent thermal diffusivity (ATD) (Hinkel et al. 2001). Mean 

ATD for a period counted just one year-round from December 2009 (summer) to November 

2010 (spring) was -4.6×310?06 m2 s?1. Negative ATD values indicate that nonconductive 

effects oppose and overwhelm the conductive trend (Outcalt and Hinkel, 1989) due to the 

higher water content, especially at summer time.

The Moss site ATD presented large positive and negative variations from December to 

April with drastic fluctuations of soil temperature and water content and small variations 

during May and June (Figure 3C). Due to the site location (water-track) is highly susceptible 

to moisture variations during summer and spring time. 

The ATD values are low and positive during late autumn. Cooler autumn temperatures 

result in a near-isothermal condition of the soil with little heat transport and almost no 

variability of ATD (Hinkel et al., 2012). The dense carpet formed by moss vegetation work 

well as an isolator during the late autumn and snow during the winter, preventing energy flux, 

so the mean ATD during winter (21 June to 23 September) was positive at 30 cm (1.7×10?06 

m2 s?1), but quite lower due to the retarding in heat flux promote by the moss carpet and then 

by snow blocking the freezing front. This value of ATD during the winter is similar to that 



88 
 

observed by Michel et al. (2012) at Fildes Peninsula in a site cover with 50 % of vegetation 

by mosses and lichens. 

  

3.2. Lichen site 

The highest soil temperature record on Lichen site was 13.66 °C and occurred on 

January 3rd 2011 (Table 3), while the highest mean daily air temperature was 7.34 °C, at the 

same date. The smoothing and delaying of the profile thermal regime is greatly enhanced with 

depth and the highest temperature did not exceed 1.33 °C at 80 cm. The water content is 

almost not variable ranging from around 10 % in the winter to 24 % in the summer (Figure 

3B); therefore, lower than that found for Moss site. Mean annual temperatures of ?1.13 °C, 

?1.29 °C and ?1.30 °C were obtained for the increasing depths respectively at 10 cm, 30 cm, 

and 80 cm depth between the begging of summer (December 21st) until late spring (December 

20th). Positive temperatures occur at the depth of 80 cm, but the highest registered was 1.33 

°C and mean monthly temperatures is close to 0.0 °C, indicating that even during summer it 

remained close to freezing. The ALT estimated was 120.22 cm. The soil temperature under 

Lichen cover followed the variability of air temperature, with the upper layers being more 

variable (Figure 3). Despite the moss site present low temperature amplitude between the top 

and bottommost layer, at the lichen site the amplitude higher reaching a maximum positive 

amplitude of 12.33 °C on December 26th  2010 and  negative maximum amplitude of -7.30 °C 

on July 6th 2010, which coincides with early summer and middle of the winter, respectively. 

This high amplitude is created due to high fluctuation on top layer whereas temperature 

followed straight the atmosphere climate and the subsurface layer be more buffered because 

the filling porous with air.  

Negative temperatures at the upper layer start in the last week of March 2009 with the 

beginning of the thermal autumn whereas temperatures drop rapidly and remain frozen until 

middle November (Figure 3b). In 2010, the upper layer starts cooler at the end of March and 

still frozen from the end of October. It is important to know that a long zero curtain regime (&gt; 

40 days) happens only in the bottommost layer due to the highest water content and the 

proximity to permafrost, so in the last layer cooling process start at late March but frozen just 

in mid-May. In upper layers, temperatures change with air temperature, and no buffer effect 

(zero curtain regime) is verified in these frozen layers when cooling starts (Figure 3b). 

Guglielmin et al. (2008) also observed longer zero curtain regime in the bottommost layer 

than upper ones under Usnea cover in Signy Island.

The process of energy transfer from atmosphere to the first 10 cm of soil had a delay 

of just 10 hours (Figure 3) and was quite effective at deeper layers. Temperature reaches at 10 

cm ?17.22 °C and -9.05 at 80 cm with a delay of 30 hours.  

Thawing started in mid-November in 2009 and late October in 2010 when the upper 

layer presented positive temperatures. The atmosphere heating starts in September and the 

soil temperature in upper layers increase exponentially following the air temperature. Despite 

the rapid thaw in the upper layer, temperature at 80 cm depth remains negative until mid-

December, reaching a maximum of 1.33 °C in February of 2011, which can prove the more 

proximity to the permafrost table (120.22 cm). These results are similar to those found by 

Michel et al. (2012) in Potter Peninsula who found 0.1 °C at 90 cm depth and soil position at 

70 m.a.s.l. with 60 % of soil cover by lichens. 

The thawing days are concentrated in summer time varying  from 128 days for the 

depth of 10 cm to 44 days at the depth of 80 cm (Table 4), because with lower water content 

in soil surface the energy dissipated in change water phase (solid to liquid) is less, so this 

layer got warmed easily.  

Freezing days occur almost during the whole year, except summer, and are higher than 

the lichen site than moss carpet site. The same estimate increase to the deepest layer from 422 

days in the upper layer to 483 days at 80 cm depth.  

Mean ATD for the whole studied period was 3.5×10?6 m2 s?1 for 30 cm depth. Colder 

conditions resulted in low ATD variability. Mean ATD obtained in winter (from June 21st to 

September 23th) was positive (6.6 ×10?6 m2 s?1). In the opposite to data observed for soil 

cover by mosses, ATD values of the lichen site present great positive oscillations from May to 

June, negative from August to November and late October to early December, and minor 

variations between March and April. Highest ATD values were observed in late autumn, 

when soil is dry and still uncovered by snow, so diffusivity of the freezing front is high. When 

begin the winter and soil surface is already covered by snow this transfer of cooling is 

reduced. During the winter, soil heat transfer is dominated by conduction when most of the 

soil water has been converted to ice. In the spring time when the snow starts to melt, 

infiltration of snow meltwater produces a thermal pulse in the active layer, and can 

significantly hasten soil warming (Hinkel et al. 1997, 2001) showing negatives values of 

ATD. During the summer due to the higher content of water the exchange heat is mainly by 

conduction as well.

3.3. Intersite variations 

Both sites showed significant differences of the mean annual ground temperature for 

all depths (Table 3). Moss carpet presented higher water content all long the years with great 

increases during the summer (Figure 3). The soil temperature under Lichen cover closely 

followed the variability of air temperate. And moss carpet site showed higher soil moisture its 

location in an accumulation zone. 

The soil from Lichen site exhibits higher number of thawing days for the surface 

layers (10 and 30 cm depths) and a lower number of thawing days with last depth, evidencing 

an insulating behavior compromising the energy transfer to deeper layers when compared 

with the soil from Moss site (Table 3). 

Although thawing days beginning in both sites in December 2009, at Moss site 

warming reaches the deepest layer in the same month, while at Lichen site this occurs just in 

February 2010 and ending in March (Table 3). 

Due to the translocation of water from the snowmelt to deeper layers the summer, heat 

exchange between air and soil layer is favored, then more heat flux is translocated to deeper 

layers. This process happens in a reduced scale at the Lichen site due to the lower water 

percolation and dryness favored thermic isolation as promoted by air filling soil pores. Owing 

to this phenomen at Moss site, deeper layers experiments highest temperature in summer 

(Table 3). 

Owing to the late freezing during the winter and late thawing in the spring, the moss 

site has more isothermal days than lichen site. Isothermal days are higher than the moss site 

due to buffer effect cause by cover vegetation, and because landscape position (water track) 

promotes longer time of snow covering the surface during the winter and spring, which 

increase moisture in soil profile. The isothermal days are concentrated during the autumn and 

summer (Table 5) and the days with temperature close to 0°C has gradually increases in depth 

at moss site and been higher in all layers than lichen site, where exhibit abruptly increases of 

isothermal days in depth. Guglielmin et al. (2008) also observed isothermal days for Moss site 

than Usnea site at Signy Island and also concentrated between April to October. 

In general, freezing-thawing does not occur in the deepest layer at both sites, but it is 

much higher in lichen ground surface, what can indicate the buffer effect of the moss cover, 

not been verified temperature fluctuation following atmosphere as occur within the lichen 

area.  



91 
 

The freeze–thaw days completely disappear at deeper layers in both sites, indicating 

that diurnal fluctuations are smoothed. The freeze–thaw cycles at this depth are also strongly 

reduced because during spring and fall (the periods in which air temperature more frequently 

crossed the 0 °C threshold) far more heat will have been consumed in the water phase changes 

causing the temperature fluctuations to be smoothed (Guglielmin et al., 2008). 

Estimated active layer is deeper at Moss (147.26 cm) than Lichen (120.22 cm) sites 

due to lower thermal conductibility in Lichen soil because it is a drier soil. Both boreholes did 

not reach the permafrost table. Similar to that observed by Kane et al. (2001) studying soils in 

Alaska, in Lions Rump the average depth of thaw is greater in vicinity of water tracks (Moss 

site) than in inter-water track areas (Lichen site). In water track areas, the soil remains 

saturated beyond the summer season; thus, it has an enhanced thermal conductivity compared 

to inter track areas. This enhanced thermal conductivity effectively supplies a warm boundary 

condition for the upper surface to the mineral soil layer, thereby producing enhanced thaw in 

these locations (Kane et al., 2001).  

Typic Haploturbels evaluated during this study are present just above 80 m.a.s.l., 

especially on the top areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols with gelic materials 

within 100 cm of the soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface; therefore, 

in lowlands at Lions Rump no Gelisols occur. Ramos and Vieira (2003) observed permafrost 

starting deeper than 2.3 m in Livingston Island monitoring a borehole at 35 m.a.s.l.. 

In general, active layer is typically greater than 90 cm for Maritime Antarctica areas as 

exposed by Vieira et al. (2010) considering others monitored boreholes in the South 

Shetlands. 

Period where the soil profile has some liquid water available is during the thawing 

isothermal days (Thorn et al., 2002), so the sum of these periods can indicate when the 

chemical weathering process may occur. Following this reasoning these thermal conditions 

were more favourable for chemical weathering in the moss site than in the lichen site for all 

soil layers. 

An interesting event occurred at early autumn where the zero curtain regime is longer 

at 80 cm at Moss then Lichen, but in the process of soil heating the change of phases solid to 

liquid (ice to liquid water) is longer at Lichen, probably due to soil profile be skeletic with 

low water content, and air fill up the soil porous difficulting heat change.  

Michel et al. (2012) observed soil texture as major influence on soil energy flux for 

soils with different texture but similar vegetation cover in Potter and Fields Peninsula. They 

considered coarse nature of the soil seems to have a considerable influence on energy flux, 



92 
 

contributing to permafrost preservation. So the air filling the pores reduces the energy flux 

similar to results observed at Lichen site. 

When studied different sites with dissimilar vegetation cover Cannone et al. (2006) 

related unlike buffer effect of the different vegetations, occurs influence of vegetation on 

snow distribution, thickness and longevity and that snow cover is thinner and melts earlier 

over the Usnea and Deschampsia sites than the Sanionia site. 

Temperature drops and increases more rapidly at Lichen site, but after the zero curtain 

regime at Moss site the temperature changes in a linear curve, while at Lichen site the changes 

are in harmonic waves (Figure 3). 

Data from N-factor (FN) graphic (Figure 4) indicated differences of station freezing 

duration in the two years monitored. In 2009, the process began in late March and ended in 

December, while in 2010, began only in mid-April and ended in late October. In 2009, 

freezing time are similar at both sites starting at Lichen one month ahead but ending as well 

one month early. In 2009, the winter was more intense with lower temperatures so at Lichen 

site, the driest soil, the freezing station starting early. In 2010, cold was less intense and 

oscillation of temperatures above 0°C occur, them FN station started late. The isolation 

promoted by snow is more efficient in the beginning of winter decreasing along the cold 

season, and it seems may be associated with metamorphism of snow crystals and their 

compaction and loss of interstitial air during the winter (Nieuwendam, 2009). In this regard, it 

is interesting that in 2009 the values of FN in late winter stabilized around 0.3 at Moss site 

and 0.8 in the Lichen site, while in 2010 the stabilization occurred in 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. 

Lower values of FN indicate better isolation promoted by the snow cover and reduced heat 

exchange between air and soil. Lower values at 2010 occurred possible by the greater 

thickness of snow cover in 2010 compared to 2009. Owing to the Moss site position on the 

landscape (water track), the height of snow cover was higher than at Lichen site whereas is 

more susceptible to winter remove. Results of FN were lower in Moss site within two years 

studied (Figure 4), reinforcing a greater influence of snow cover at this site by buffering 

temperature near 0 ° C for longer, due to its poor heat conduction. This is a useful parameter 

because of its simplicity and potential to determine the relationship between the physical 

conditions at the soil surface and atmospheric (Karunaratne e Burn, 2003).

and 2010 (B). It was used soil temperature at 10 cm to be closer to the soil surface.  

 

 

Multivariate regression considering the temperature of the deepest layer as dependent 

on air and the other layer's temperatures generated good equation estimatives for each site 

(Table 7). It adjusted R-squared was superior to 0.91 for both sites and standard errors for the 

beta coefficients were in an acceptable range. The equations help us understand the joint 

linear effect on the set of independent variables (beta coefficients) in predicting temperature 

of the bottom (80 cm) of the profile (dependent variable). As expected both sites were more 

influenced by the subsequent horizon (30 cm), presenting similar betas; and the contribution 

of air and uppermost soil temperatures (10 cm) was small, due to the time lag in temperature 

changes (Figure 3A and 3B). These should be interpreted with care because the upper sensor

does not reflect the actual soil surface temperature and the air temperature from distant 

weather stations may not reflect the exact air temperature at the studied sites.  

All beta coefficients were statistically significant. The equation proposed for Moss 

overestimates temperature peaks in summer and the predicted values diverged from observed 

ones by a maximum of 7.97, a minimum of ?1.57, and an average of 0.14 but during the 

winter the temperatures are too close (Figure 6). This overestimated temperature in Moss site 

during summer can occur due to high-water  content present, then it is necessary more heat 

exchange to change soil temperature because the high-water  latent heat. In Lichen site, the 

soil is drier and the values estimated from the equations were close to those registered with 

the sensors with uniform behavior throughout the studied period. Residues ranged from a 

maximum of 2.80 to a minimum of ?3.11 with an average of 0.18 (Figure 6). Observed values 

at Moss are more concentrated between -4 to 4 °C and Lichen between -10 to 3 °C, what can 

prove the more influence of air temperatures to promote changes in bottommost layers, what 

is buffered at Moss site due to the long lasting time of snow cover; the isolation promoted by 

the moss carpet and the highest water content.

4. Conclusions 

The active layer thermal regime in the two soils studied at Lions Rump, Maritime 

Antarctica, is typical of periglacial environments, with major variation close to the surface 

during summer resulting in frequent freeze and thaw cycles. The great majorities of the soil 

temperature readings for both sites were close to 0 °C resulting in low freezing and thawing 

degree days. Both soils have low thermal apparent diffusivity.  

The temperature profile of the soils during the studied period indicates that the active 

layer thickness was approximately 150 cm at Moss site and 120 cm at Lichen site. This 

indicates that the permafrost table was not deeper than 200 cm from the surface, corroborating 

with the classification of these soils as Cryosols or Gelisols, with clear turbic features.  

The difference in moisture regimes for the studied sites was attributed to the soil 

vegetation cover and principal by site location on the landscape.  

The temperature buffer effect of mosses appears to be associated with snow cover and 

especially by local higher water content. 

For better understanding of how works the hydrothermal dinamyc of permafrost 

affect-soils it is necessary installation of humid probes along the soil layers together with soil 

temperature sensors. 

Data presented are obtained from less than two years of monitoring, which limits 

conclusive interpretations in terms of warming or cooling trends, permafrost distribution and 

effects of climate change on the studied soils. Nevertheless, as part of a long term active layer 

monitoring program, these results are important as a benchmark for future interpretations.

CONCLUSÕES GERAIS 

 
Solos de Lions Rump, Ilha Rei George, Antártica Marítima são formados 

principalmente a partir do intemperismo de rochas basalto-andesíticas. No geral, a 

distribuição dos solos e classificação em Rump Lions é formada por dois domínios principais: 

solos Ornithogênicos largamente distribuidos nos terrenos localizados nas porções mais 

baixas da área (ausentes de permafrost nos 200 cm superficiais do solo) e os Gelisolos 

(localizado em acima de 80 m de altitude acima do nível do mar). Typic Dystrogelepts 

ornithic e Typic Gelorthents ornithic são os principais solos ornitogênicos e mais evoluídos 

do que Gelisolos. Gelisolos são crioturbados e representados principalmente pelos Typic 

Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels, que estão presentes, especialmente em áreas de topo e 

manchas paraglacial, com materiais gelíco dentro de 100 cm e permafrost dentro de 200 cm 

da superfície do solo. 

A microestrutura dos Gelisolos é típica de solos afetados por congelamento, e os 

ornitogênicos possuem um tipo particular de estrutura globular, agregados arredondados, 

sobre forte influência biológica. A fosfatização é o principal processo de formação do solo 

nos solos ácidos ornitogenicos e a utilização de técnicas de microquímica provou serem úteis 

para uma melhor compreensão da pedogênese nesses solos antárticos poucos conhecidos. 

A respeito da distribuição das coberturas vegetais, a presença de Prasiola está 

associada com sua proximidade à colônia de pinguins. Este tipo de alga ocorre em solos ricos 

em N. Líquens são comuns em rochas ou fragmentos de rochas em todas as ordens de solo. 

Musgos são encontrados principalmente em áreas umidas formando tapetes ou formando 

almofada em outros solos de melhor drenagem. Plantas superiores estão representando apenas 

por Deschampsia antarctica e Colobanthus quitensis, que ocorrem principalmente em feições 

geologicas Quaternárias, com densa cobertura em terraços soerguidos, praias e morainas. 

O regime térmico da camada ativa nos dois sítos (musgos e líquens) monitorados em 

Lions Rump é típico de ambientes periglaciais, com variação próxima à superfície durante o 

inverno e o verão, resultando em frequentes ciclos de congelamento e descongelamento do 

solo. Registro de dados da temperatura do solo de ambos os locais mostram temperaturas 

médias próximas de zero grau Celsius, mas com o domínio de dias de congelamento. Ambas 

as áreas apresentaram baixa difusividade térmica aparente. No sítio de monitoramento sob 

musgos as temperaturas mostraram menores amplitudes de variações quando comparadas ao 

solo sob líquen, o que foi atribuído ao efeito tampão promovido pela própria cobertura de 



100 
 

musgos em forma de tapete, pelo elevado teor de água e pela mais espessa e duradoura 

cobertura de neve.
