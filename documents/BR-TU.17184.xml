The mineral sturmanite is a hydrated calcium iron aluminium manganese sulphate tetrahydroxoborate
hydroxide of formula Ca6(Fe, Al, Mn)2(SO4)2(B(OH)4)(OH)12?26H2O. We have studied the mineral sturma-
nite using a number of techniques, including SEM with EPMA and vibrational spectroscopy. Chemical
analysis shows a homogeneous phase, composed by Ca, Fe, Mn, S, Al and Si. B is not determined in this
EPMA technique. An intense Raman band at 990 cm?1 is assigned to the SO4

2? symmetric stretching mode.
Raman spectroscopy identifies multiple sulphate symmetric stretching modes in line with the three
sulphate crystallographically different sites. Raman spectroscopy also identifies a band at 1069 cm?1

which may be attributed to a carbonate symmetric stretching mode, indicating the presence of thauma-
site. Infrared spectra display two bands at 1080 and 1107 cm?1 assigned to the SO4

2? antisymmetric
stretching modes. The observation of multiple bands in this m4 spectral region offers evidence for the
reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion from Td to C2v or even lower symmetry. The Raman band
at 3622 cm?1 is assigned to the OH unit stretching vibration and the broad feature at around
3479 cm?1 to water stretching bands. Infrared spectroscopy shows a set of broad overlapping bands in
the OH stretching region. Vibrational spectroscopy enables an assessment of the molecular structure of
sturmanite to be made.

found in the manganese Kalahari fields primarily from N’Chwaning
I and II mines.

Sturmanite also forms well shaped crystals which are often a
bright yellow colour, making the mineral an essential item for min-
eral collectors. A picture of sturmanite is given in the graphical
abstract (used with the kind permission of M&amp;amp;D minerals).
Sturmanite usually forms long hexagonal crystals, as may be seen
in the picture. The chemistry of sturmanite is most interesting. In
comparison with the mineral ettringite Ca6Al2(OH)12(SO4)3?26H2O
[3], one sulphate unit has been replaced with tetrahydroxoborate,
B(OH)4. The mineral is predominantly made up of water with four
out of every five atoms in this mineral is either a part of a water
molecule or an hydroxide. Sturmanite is trigonal, P31c, Z = 2, with
a 11.188(9) Å, c 21.91(7) Å, and V 2375.1(5) Å3. According to
Pushcharovsky et al. [4], the structure of sturmanite consists of
two coaxial elements parallel to [0 0 1] and is the most distinctive
features of sturmanite. The main one is a column of polyhedra
formed by Fe-octahedra and Ca-polyhedra [4]. The Fe(OH)6
octahedra are located along the three-fold axes that pass through
the origin of the cell. These are linked to three VIIICa-polyhedra,
located around the three-fold axes, in between the Fe(OH)6
octahedra [4]. The second structural element parallel to [0 0 1]

contains [SO4] and B(OH)4 tetrahedra. According to Pushcharovsky
et al. [4] both structural modules are linked to each other by a com-
plex system of hydrogen bonds.

Raman spectroscopy has proven most useful for the study of
mineral structure [5–8]. Vibrational spectroscopy is very important
for the study of Mn containing minerals [3,9]. The objective of this
research is to analyse the Raman and infrared spectra of sturma-
nite and to relate the spectra to the mineral structure.
Experimental

Samples description and preparation

The sturmanite sample studied in this work forms part of the
collection of the Geology Department of the Federal University of
Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, with sample code SAA-170. The
mineral originated from Black Rock mine, Kalahari, RSA.

The sample was gently crushed and the associated minerals
were removed under a stereomicroscope Leica MZ4. The sturma-
nite studied in this work occurs as single crystals with prismatic
hexagonal form up to 5 mm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
in the EDS mode was applied to support the mineral
characterisation.

range (lower spectrum).
Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA)

The quantitative chemical analysis of sturmanite crystals frag-
ment was carried out using EPMA, with a Jeol JXA8900R spectrom-
eter from the Physics Department of the Federal University of
Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte. For each selected element. An appro-
priate standard was used as listed in Table 1. The electron probe
microanalysis in the WDS (wavelength dispersive spectrometer)
mode was obtained at 15 kV accelerating voltage and beam current
of 10 nA. Chemical formula was calculated on the basis of 49 oxy-
gen atoms.
Raman microprobe spectroscopy

Crystals of sturmanite were placed on a polished metal surface
on the stage of an Olympus BHSM microscope, which is equipped
with 10?, 20?, and 50? objectives. The microscope is part of a
Renishaw 1000 Raman microscope system, which also includes a
monochromator, a filter system and a CCD detector (1024 pixels).
The Raman spectra were excited by a Spectra-Physics model 127
He–Ne laser producing highly polarised light at 633 nm and col-
lected at a nominal resolution of 2 cm?1 and a precision of
±1 cm?1 in the range between 100 and 4000 cm?1. The Raman

spectrum of at least 10 crystals was collected to ensure the consis-
tency of the spectra. Repeated acquisitions on the crystals using
the highest magnification (50?) were accumulated to improve
the signal to noise ratio of the spectra. Raman Spectra were cali-
brated using the 520.5 cm?1 line of a silicon wafer.
Infrared spectroscopy

Infrared spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR
spectrometer with a smart endurance single bounce diamond
ATR cell. Spectra over the 4000–525 cm?1 range were obtained
by the co-addition of 128 scans with a resolution of 4 cm?1 and a
mirror velocity of 0.6329 cm/s. Spectra were co-added to improve
the signal to noise ratio.

Spectral manipulation such as baseline correction/adjustment
and smoothing were performed using the Spectracalc software
package GRAMS (Galactic Industries Corporation, NH, USA). Band
component analysis was undertaken using the Jandel ‘Peakfit’ soft-
ware package that enabled the type of fitting function to be
selected and allows specific parameters to be fixed or varied
accordingly. Band fitting was done using a Lorentzian–Gaussian
cross-product function with the minimum number of component
bands used for the fitting process. The Lorentzian–Gaussian ratio
was maintained at values greater than 0.7 and fitting was

undertaken until reproducible results were obtained with squared
correlations of r2 greater than 0.995.
Results and discussion

Mineral characterisation

Chemical analysis of sturmanite studied in this work is pre-
sented in Table 1. The image shows an sturmanite crystal aggre-
gate as provided in the graphical abstract. Individual crystals up
to 30 lm in length are observed. Crystals show hexagonal pris-
matic habitus. Qualitative chemical analysis shows a homogeneous
phase, composed by Ca, Al and Si. Carbon was also observed and
occurs due to C coating. Boron was not detected as the atomic
number is low.

Background
Sulphate typically is a tetrahedral oxyanion with Raman bands

at 981 (m1), 451 (m2), 1104 (m3) and 613 (m4) cm
?1 [10]. Some sul-

phates have their symmetry reduced through acting as monoden-
tate and bidentate ligands [10]. In the case of bidentate behaviour
both bridging and chelating ligands are known. This reduction in

symmetry is observed by the splitting of the m3 and m4 into two
components under C3v symmetry and 3 components under C2v
symmetry. The vibrational spectra of ettringite have been reported
[3]. The Raman spectroscopy of the aqueous sulphate tetrahedral
oxyanion yields the symmetric stretching (m1) vibration at
981 cm?1, the in-plane bending (m2) mode at 451 cm

?1, the anti-
symmetric stretching (m3) mode at 1104 cm

?1 and the out-of-plane
bending (m4) mode at 613 cm

tion of the infrared spectra for potassium alum as m1, 981 cm

Water stretching modes were reported at 3400 and 3000 cm?1,
bending modes at 1645 cm?1, and librational modes at 930 and
700 cm?1 [13]. The Raman spectrum of the mineral chalcanthite
shows a single symmetric stretching mode at 984.7 cm?1. Two m2
modes are observed at 463 and 445 cm?1 and three m3 modes at
1173, 1146 and 1100 cm?1. The m4 mode is observed as a single
band at 610 cm?1. A complex set of overlapping bands is observed
in the low wavenumber region at 257, 244, 210, 136 and 126 cm?1.
Recently, Raman spectra of four basic copper sulphate minerals,
namely antlerite, brochiantite, posnjakite and langite, were pub-
lished [14]. The SO symmetric stretching modes for the four basic
copper sulphate minerals are observed at 985, 990, 972 and
974 cm?1. Only the mineral brochantite showed a single band in
this region. Multiple bands were observed for these minerals in
the antisymmetric stretching region.

Vibrational spectroscopy

The Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the complete mea-
sured wavenumbers is displayed in Fig. 1a. This figure shows the
position of the Raman bands and their relative intensities and also
provides an indication of the sharpness of these bands. Large parts
of the spectrum are noted where little or no intensity is found.
Therefore, the spectra are subdivided into sections based upon
the differing vibrations being studied. The infrared spectrum of
sturmanite over the 500–4000 cm?1 spectral range is reported in
Fig. 1b. This figure shows the position and relative intensities of
the infrared active sturmanite bands. The spectra are subdivided
into sections as is convenient based upon the vibrations being
studied. A comparison may be made between the Raman and infra-
red spectra of sturmanite.

The Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 900–1200 cm?1

spectral range is displayed in Fig. 2a. This spectral region is the
region of the sulphate symmetric stretching modes. The spectrum
is dominated by an intense Raman band at 990 cm?1. This band at
990 cm?1 is assigned to the SO4

2? m1 symmetric stretching mode.
The position of this band is in agreement with previously pub-
lished data [15]. Two low intensity shoulders to this band are
observed at 981 and 995 cm?1. In addition, Raman bands are
observed at 1069 (sharp) and 1117 (very broad). These bands are
attributed to the SO4

2? m3 antisymmetric stretching mode.

According to Myneni [16], the SO4
2? polyhedra of the channels in

sturmanite are present in three crystallographically different sites
and exhibit weakly split S–O antisymmetric stretching vibrations
at 1136 cm?1 (with several components) and symmetric stretch
at 1016, 1008, and 989 cm?1. The observation of three symmetric
stretching bands in this work, fits well with the concept of three
different non-equivalent sulphate units in the sturmanite struc-
ture. The band at 1069 cm?1 looks very much like a carbonate
stretching mode. It is possible that the mineral being studied is a
solid solution between sturmanite and thaumasite Ca3(SO4)
[Si(OH)6]CO3?12H2O. Thus, the presence of this latter mineral in
the solid solution would give rise to the carbonate bands.

The infrared spectrum of sturmanite over the 700–1200 cm?1

spectral range is shown in Fig. 2b. Strong infrared bands are
observed at 1080 and 1107 cm?1 and are assigned to the SO4

2? m3
antisymmetric stretching mode. These bands are of very low inten-
sity in the Raman spectrum. The low intensity infrared band at
983 cm?1 is attributed to the SO4

2? m1 symmetric stretching mode.
This band is the equivalent of the Raman band observed at
990 cm?1. The infrared bands of sturmanite at 878 and 937 cm?1

may be associated with water librational bands.
The Raman spectra of sturmanite over the 300–800 cm?1 spec-

tral range and over the 150–300 cm?1 spectral range are shown in
Fig. 3. A series of Raman bands are observed at 501, 530, 579 and
623 cm?1. These bands are assigned to the m4 (SO4)

modes. Renaudin et al. [15] found a Raman band at 549 cm?1 for
a synthetic ettringite analogue and attributed this band to an
Al(OH)6 vibration. We found a Raman band at 530 cm

?1. The obser-
vation of multiple bands in this m4 spectral region offers evidence
for the reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion from Td to
C2v or even lower symmetry. The Raman band at 760 cm

?1 is
attributed to a hydroxyl deformation mode associated with AlOH
units. It is likely that the infrared bands at 750 and 878 cm?1 are
due also to this vibrational unit. The Raman band at 455 cm?1 is
ascribed to the m2 (SO4)

2? bending modes. Renaudin et al. [15]
found a band at 451 cm?1 for a synthetic ettringite analogue and
assigned this band to a m2 sulphate vibration. The band at
355 cm?1 with a shoulder band at 383 cm?1 is attributed to a
CaO and other M–O stretching vibrations. In the far low wavenum-
ber region, a broad spectral feature is observed which may be
resolved into component bands at 205, 232 and 268 cm?1. These
bands are simply described as lattice vibrations.

The Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 2600–3800 cm?1

spectral range is illustrated in Fig. 4a. The spectrum shows two fea-
tures: bands at 3600 and 3622 cm?1 and a broad feature at around
3479 cm?1 which may be resolved into component bands at 3276,
3401 and 3479 cm?1. The first two bands at 3600 and 3622 cm?1 is
assigned to the OH stretching vibration of the OH units. It is not
unexpected to observe OH stretching vibrations as the mineral
contains B(OH)4 units. It is likely that these two peaks are due to

the two isotopes of boron. The nominal resolution of the Raman
spectrometer is of the order of 2 cm?1 and as such is sufficient
enough to identify separate bands for the stretching bands of the
two boron isotopes. The two reduced masses for a pure B–O
stretching mode would be (10 ? 16)/(10 + 16) = 6.154 for 10-B
and (11 ? 16)/(11 + 16) = 6.518 for 11-B. The wavenumber is
inversely proportional to square root of reduced mass; so the iso-
topic wavenumber ratio should be the sqrt(6.518/6.154) = 1.03.
10-B is about 20% of natural boron, so a mode that is mostly B–O
stretching and that includes significant motion of the B atom
(not a breathing mode of a BO3 trigonal planar unit or a BO4 tetra-
hedral unit) should show a large peak for 11-B and a smaller peak
at higher wavenumber for 10-B.

The broad feature centred upon 3479 cm?1 is attributed to
water stretching vibrations. Renaudin et al. [15] observed the OH
stretching vibration at 3638 cm?1 for ettringite. These researchers
found the water band at 3440 cm?1 and showed the band was very
broad. The infrared spectrum of sturmanite over the 2500–
3800 cm?1 spectral range is reported in Fig. 4b. The spectrum is
very broad. Infrared bands may be resolved at 3212, 3410 and
3594 cm?1 with a broad tail at 2899 cm?1. The first two bands
are ascribed to water stretching bands. The infrared band at
3594 cm?1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of OH units from
the B(OH)4 units.

The Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 1550–1800 cm?1

spectral range is illustrated in Fig. 5a. As for the Raman spectrum
of the OH stretching region of sturmanite, the bands in this spectral
region are very broad. A broad Raman band is noted at 1697 cm?1

with a tail at 1636 cm?1. These bands are attributed to water bend-
ing modes. These bands are also observed in the infrared spectrum
of sturmanite shown in Fig. 5b. Infrared bands are observed at
1640 and 1681 cm?1 and are assigned to water bending vibrations.
The two infrared bands at 1394 and 1420 cm?1 are due to the pres-
ence of the B(OH)4 units in the sturmanite structure, These bands
are assigned to the antisymmetric stretching of trigonal boron. A
second possible assignment is to the OH in-plane bending of the
OH units of B(OH)4 units although the two infrared bands at
1230 and 1258 cm?1 are more likely candidates for this vibrational
mode.

Conclusions

We have attempted to study the mineral sturmanite a hydrated
calcium iron aluminium manganese sulphate tetrahydroxoborate
hydroxide of formula Ca6(Fe, Al, Mn)2(SO4)2(B(OH)4)(OH)12?26H2O
found in the manganese Kalahari fields primarily from N’Chwaning
I and II mines. Chemical analysis shows a homogeneous phase,
composed by Ca, Al and Si. The mineral contains boron which is
not detected by the EDX technique. The mineral sturmanite may
be compared with related sulphate mineral ettringite.

In the structure of sturmanite, one of the sulphate ion groups
has been replaced by the unusual ion group, tetrahydroxoborate,
B(OH)4 with a negative one charge. The minerals sturmanite and
ettringite occur in the same mineral localities and are not easily
or readily distinguished.

Raman and infrared bands which are attributable to SO4
2?

stretching and bending modes are observed. The intense Raman
band at 990 cm?1 is assigned to the SO4

2? symmetric stretching
mode. It could be expected that Raman and infrared bands which
are attributable to the B(OH)4 units would be observed. For what-
ever reason, the bands are not obvious. One possibility is that the
bands are under the envelope of the sulphate bands. The infrared
bands observed at 1230, 1258, 1394 and 1420 cm?1 are due to
BOH out of plane bending modes. Intense Raman bands at 3600
and 3622 cm?1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the
B(OH)4 units. Raman spectroscopy identifies some selected bands
which are attributed to the presence of boron as B(OH)4

?.
