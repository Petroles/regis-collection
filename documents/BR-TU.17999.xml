ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. 

This master thesis is the result of many efforts, not just in the professional sense, but also in the personal 

one. But it is also the result of the support from many colleagues on both areas. 

To all the members of the ASP - UP Diliman (Philippines), and especially to Dr. Rebecca Crozier, 

because without her marvelous coordination labor and valuable advices this thesis would never have 

been possible. 

In the same context, I need to emphasize the support of Dr. Armand Salvador Mijares, always available 

from the direction of the ASP, and Drs. Victor Paz and Helen Lewis, whose support to understand the 

archaeological site of Ille Cave, which they directed since the beginning of the archaeological project, 

was essential to understand its cultural sequence. 

Inside the ASP osteology laboratory itself, thanks a lot to my good friend (and best "bone raider"!) Sarah 

Agatha Villaluz, cause her unconditional support and appreciations, and to Myra Lara and Andrea 

Dominique Cosalan, because their titanic work organizing the register. 

Special thanks to Dr. Jesusa Catabui, director from the UP Health Services, because of her interest in 

our work, and to all the technicians in the same center, which helped me so much during the X-Ray 

analysis of some of the samples studied for the present work. 

Also, as part of my personal experience in Manila, thanks a lot to Isaac Morales Boral and his marvelous 

family because of their giant help during the first few months and, especially, to Jesus Mari Pe Benito for 

becoming the most supportive person during my stay in the country. MARAMING SALAMAT PO. 

I can´t forget here all the people who treated me so well and taught me so much during my time in Mação 

(Portugal) and Ferrara (Italy). Thank you all, friends and teachers, and especially thanks to Dr. Luiz 

Oosterbeek and Dr. Marta Arzarello for their great reception at both institutions, and to the Drs. Eugenia 

Cunha and Emmanuela Gualdi for creating and helping me to shape this great interest in the human 

remains that have come overall to the work that I present here. MUITO OBRIGADO, GRAZZIE MILLE. 

Many friends have come and gone in these two years of adventure. But family (though now a little bit 

smaller) has always been supporting from the distance and making sense of my existence in every way, 

giving me strength for all the challenges and opportunities. Thank you, above everyone else.  

And thank you, Grandma, for a lifetime of love and advices. S.T.T.L.

ABSTRACT. 

This work, final thesis for the Erasmus Mundus Master in Quaternary and Prehistory, is configured as a 

bioarchaeological study conducted on human skeletal remains. The selected assemblage for the study 

comes from the archaeological site of Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), on the island of 

Palawan, Philippines. Of the various phases of burials documented on the site, was chosen to focus the 

study on those from the intensive burial phase (upper layers of the stratigraphic sequence), selecting 

individuals from prehistoric chronologies (Neolithic and Metal Age) and omitting therefore the 

individuals from the contact phase (colonial era). 

This study established gender and age around the death of the 20 individuals selected, in addition to the 

detection of the various diseases suffered by the prehistoric inhabitants of Ille Cave (paleopathologies). 

For this purpose were used basic procedures for sexual diagnosis and age determination, widely used in 

forensic studies, as well as the differential diagnosis in the case of the study of diseases present in the 

human remains. Have been documented various types of diseases (infectious, degenerative, metabolic, 

trauma), both in the various bones composing the skeletons analyzed, as in the various teeth preserved in 

each case. Likewise, some markers of occupational stress where registered, related to various functions 

performed by individuals during their lives, and which have enabled to rebuild certain life activities of 

these communities (based on a comparison with other cases from the archaeological literature and 

ethnographic based studies). 

Finally, the comparison of the results with others from various places in Southeast Asia has allowed the 

contextualization of Ille Cave case, which seems to follow similar patterns to those detected in this area. 

 

RESUMEN. 

El presente trabajo, tesis final del Master Erasmus Mundus en Cuaternario y Prehistoria, se configura 

como un estudio bioarqueológico llevado a cabo sobre restos esqueléticos humanos. La colección 

seleccionada para el estudio procede del yacimiento arqueológico de Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El 

Nido), en la isla de Palawan, Filipinas. De las diversas fases de enterramientos documentadas en el sitio, 

se ha optado por focalizar el estudio en aquellas procedentes de la fase de enterramientos intensivos 

(niveles superiores de la secuencia estratigráfica), seleccionando los individuos procedentes de 

cronologías prehistóricas (Neolítico y Edad de los Metales) y descartando, por tanto, los individuos 

procedentes de la fase de contacto (Era Colonial). 

Este estudio ha permitido establecer el sexo y la edad en torno a la muerte de los 20 individuos 

seleccionados, además de recoger observaciones relativas a las diversas enfermedades que sufrieron los 

habitantes prehistóricos de Ille Cave (paleopatologías). Para ello, se emplearon procedimientos básicos de 

diagnosis sexual y determinación de la edad, ampliamente utilizados en estudios forenses, así como la 

diagnosis diferencial en el caso del estudio de las patologías presentes en los restos humanos. Se han 

documentado diversos tipos de enfermedades (infecciosas, degenerativas, metabólicas, traumatismos), 

tanto en los diversos huesos que componían los esqueletos analizados, como en las diversas piezas 

dentales conservadas en cada caso. Así mismo, se han conseguido determinar algunos marcadores de

vidas, y que han permitido reconstruir ciertas actividades de la vida de estas comunidades (en base a un 

estudio comparativo con otros casos procedentes de la literatura arqueológica y a estudios de base 

etnográfica).  

Por último, la comparativa de los resultados con otros procedentes de diversos sitios del Sudeste Asiático 

ha permitido la contextualización del caso de Ille Cave, que parece seguir patrones similares a los 

detectados en dicha área de estudio. 

 

RÉSUMÉ. 

Ce travail, mémoire de Master Erasmus Mundus spécialité Quaternaire et Préhistoire, est une étude bio-

archéologique conduite sur des restes de squelette humain. L’assemblage choisi pour cette étude provient 

du site d’Ille (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), situé sur l’île de Palawan, Philippines. Des différentes 

périodes funéraires mises en évidence sur ce site, nous avons choisi de nous concentrer sur la phase 

funéraire la plus riche (couches supérieures de la séquence stratigraphique), en sélectionnant des 

individus des périodes préhistoriques (Néolithique et Age des Métaux) et en écartant les individus de la 

phase de contact (période coloniale).  

Cette étude établit le genre et l’âge de décès des vingt individus sélectionnés et la détection de plusieurs 

maladies dont ont souffert les habitants de la grotte d’Ille (paléo-pathologies). Nous nous sommes 

appuyés sur une méthodologie classique de détermination des âges et des diagnoses sexuelles, méthode 

largement employé dans les études médico-légales, comme sur une étude des diagnoses différentielles des 

maladies présentes sur les restes humains. Plusieurs types de maladies ont été documentées (infectieuses, 

dégénératives, métaboliques, traumatiques) à la fois sur les différents os composant le squelette analysé 

que sur les dents. Des marqueurs de stress d’occupation ont été analysés, relatifs aux différentes activités 

accomplies par ces individus au cours de leur vie. Cela nous a permis de reconstruire les activités 

quotidiennes de ces communautés (nous nous sommes appuyés sur la littérature des études 

archéologiques et ethnographiques).  

Enfin, la comparaison établie avec d’autres sites en Asie du sud-est a permis de remettre en contexte la 

grotte d’Ille qui suit les mêmes modèles.

como um estudo realizado em restos bioarqueológicos de esqueletos humanos. A coleção selecionada 

para o estudo vem do sítio arqueológico de Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), na ilha de 

Palawan, Filipinas. Das várias fases de enterros documentados no site, optou por se concentrar o estudo 

sobre os enterros de fase intensiva (níveis superiores da seqüência estratigráfica), a seleção de indivíduos

SOMMARIO. 

Questo lavoro, tesi finale del Master Erasmus Mundus in Quaternario e Preistoria, si configura come 

uno studio bioarcheologiche condotto su resti scheletrici umani. La raccolta selezionata per lo studio 

proviene dal sito archeologico di Ille Cave (Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido), sull'isola di Palawan, 

Filippine. Delle varie fasi di sepolture documentati sul sito, ha scelto di concentrarsi nello studio su quelli 

provenienti da fase di sepolture intensivi (livelli superiori della sequenza stratigrafica), selezionando le 

individui da cronologie preistorici (Neolitico ed Età dei Metalli) e scartando quindi, gli individui dalla 

fase di contatto (epoca coloniale). 

Questo studio stabilisce sesso ed età intorno alla morte di 20 individui selezionati, in aggiunta alla 

raccolta di commento alle malattie che hanno colpito dagli abitanti preistorici di Ille Cave 

(paleopatologias). A questo scopo, sono state utilizzate procedure di base per determinare l'età e 

diagnosticare il sesso, ampiamente usato negli studi forensi, così come la diagnosi differenziale nel caso 

dello studio di malattie presenti nei resti umani. Sono stati documentati vari tipi di malattie (infettiva, 

degenerativa, metabolica, traumi), sia nei vari ossa qui comporre scheletri analizzati, come nelle varie 

denti conservati in ciascun caso. Allo stesso modo, sono riusciti a identificare alcuni marcatori di stress 

occupazionale, in relazione alle diverse funzioni fisiche svolte da individui durante la loro vita, e hanno 

permesso di ricostruire alcune attività di vita di queste comunità (sulla base di un confronto con altri casi 

dalla letteratura archeologica e studi di base etnografici). 

Infine, il confronto dei risultati con gli altri provenienti da diversi luoghi nel Sud Est Asiatico ha 

permesso contestualizzare il caso di Ille Cave, che sembra seguire modelli simili a quelli rilevati in questo 

studio.

PROLOGUE: A PERSONAL HISTORY. 

WHY PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY? 

WHY PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY? 

 
 

Before discussing and defining the subject of work I did during my temporary stay in the 

UP Diliman (Philippines), as part of the Erasmus Mundus Master in Quaternary and 

Prehistory, it is necessary here to begin with a brief overview of my personal and 

professional history in reference to the two fields that come together in this issue: 

archaeology and physical anthropology (in this case referred to the osteological material). 

Referring to the first field, the truth is I can say that archeology has been my passion since 

childhood, although this "life dream" was not formalized until the beginning of my studies 

in that disciplines, when in 2011 I decided to enroll in the Degree of History at the Faculty 

of Philosophy and Letters of the Universidad de Alcalá de Henares (Madrid, Spain). 

During the five years of this phase of my training, I not only learned to give a more 

scientific perspective to the study of history and archeology (as opposed to the myths of 

childhood), but I fell even more in love with the archaeology itself. Much blame it all 

comes from the constant effort of the Department of Prehistory of the university, led by Dr. 

Rodrigo de Balbin and Dr. Primitiva Bueno Ramirez, both great specialists concerning the 

archeology of the Iberian Peninsula (the first on hunter-gatherer societies, and especially in 

the study of Paleolithic art; the second in recent chronologies, megalithic and post-

Paleolithic art specialist) also knew how to instill passion and respect in me for the 

discipline, through a certainly practical and fun way (annual study tours to archaeological 

reference sites, workshops for the study of materials, excavations, etc.). Thanks to them I 

ended up choosing to focus my studies in prehistory, although my previous interests 

pointed in other directions (Classical Archaeology, Egyptology, Islamic Medieval). 

During the Degree I also had the opportunity to acquire various fieldwork skills through 

several seminars of documentation of rock art and many archaeological campaigns.

Certainly my first excavation was really important to further define my potential interest: it 

was a necropolis of pit graves from Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods, situated on the 

outskirts of Madrid, and was carried out by a partnership with a company of archeology 

(Punto de Encuentro S.L.). In addition to the hardness of the work, I perfectly remember 

the feeling I had when first discovered human remains: the skeleton of a child, apparently 

bound and decapitated. In the adjacent pit, anthropologists exposed the remains of an adult 

male in an extended position and covered with multiple beads, forming a colorful necklace. 

My innate passion for the ritual and that first experience made me decide to focus my work 

on the archeology of death. 

All these experiences led me to continue my studies after the Degree in History by 

specializing in the field of archaeology, which was manifested in the attainment of the 

Master AGEPIPE (Archaeology and Heritage Management at the Inner Iberian Peninsula: 

2011-2012) in state institution, during which I was able to do my thesis on ritual contexts of 

Prehistory of my region. My work, "Pit graves from III to II millennia BC in the Inner 

Iberian Peninsula", would have been impossible without the invaluable help and direction 

of Dr. Rosa Barroso Bermejo, who helped me analyze the funeral phenomenon in the upper 

Tagus River, in the triangle formed by the provinces of Madrid-Toledo-Guadalajara. 

While I consider it necessary to continue in my studies for the future (I have in mind my 

PhD in the subject), the development of my thesis in AGEPIPE made me consider many 

questions. The main one was “and what happens to the human remains?” My thesis was 

focused on the analysis of materials, structures and spaces, but the fact is that one of my 

biggest gaps after my time in the UAH was directly studying the skeletons themselves. Of 

course, this would have no place in a C.V. specializing in the study of tombs! Therefore, I 

decided to take some time to think before enrolling in a PhD program, and this time of 

reflection materialized in the enrolling for the Erasmus Mundus program which currently 

I´m doing. I had the good fortune to receive, at the end of 2013, a scholarship that allowed 

me to participate without major costs in the International Master in Quaternary and 

Prehistory. First, because it was a great opportunity to embark on that journey into the 

unknown: the study of physical anthropology. Second, I have always considered myself a 

traveling and adventurous person. My first Erasmus, conducted in the fourth year of the

Degree of History at the Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal), allowed me to understand 

how important it is to study in an international environment, with different ideas and 

methodologies, and of course with different languages. Also, the strong global economic 

crisis in which we find ourselves nowadays is forcing many young people to emigrate from 

my country in search of a better future: so it seemed logical to take advantage of 

circumstances to start looking for projects that were viable for my future. 

It is with this second master that I come face to face with the second field of physical 

anthropology. During my stay at the Instituto Politécnico de Tomar and the Museu da arte 

Pré-Histórica e do Sagrado no Vale do Tejo in Mação, I had the opportunity to take a 

course of Bioarcheology and Human Evolution, led by Dr. Eugenia Cunha of the 

University of Coimbra, a great specialist in forensic science and great teacher, who knew 

how to guide us precisely in the various theoretical and practical exercises of the course. 

My obsession to learn as much as possible about human bones also led me to participate in 

the laboratory of human osteology of the UP Diliman Archaeological Studies Program 

(hereinafter referred to as ASP), led by Dr. Rebecca Crozier, during a stay of four months 

in the summer of 2014. Through a month of work with a practical exercise that a priori 

might seem simple (the study of a skeleton in fairly good condition, defining the biological 

profile of the individual), Dr. Crozier got me interested in the secrets hidden behind the 

human remains increasingly, and made me understand the idea that somehow a deceased 

individual (hundreds of years in this case) could continue giving us really valuable 

information. This, together with the wonderful personal experiences that I enjoyed during 

my time in the Philippines and the ASP, led me to propose Dr. Crozier as director of my 

future thesis, which would deal with paleopathologies (even the exact issue was not defined 

yet) and could be done by a new stay in the country which would run between January and 

August 2015. 

Overlooking my thesis preparation, I was able to make another mobility between October 

and December 2014 in the Universita degli Studi di Ferrara (Italy), where theoretical and 

practical studies were useful to me for my future work: a theoretical course on Human 

Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, headed by Dr. Carlo Peretto; and two courses, both 

theoretical (Biology of the Human Skeleton) and practical (laboratory of archaeo-

anthropology and forensic anthropology), with the recognized italian forensic scientist Dr. 

Emmanuela Gualdi. I was able to approach skeletal fragments in state of poor preservation, 

analyzing the pathologies reflected in the remains by comparing them with an extended 

reference collection, and also conducting studies of sexual diagnosis, age determination and 

stature. 

For these reasons, it is clear that my master's thesis would be framed in the field of 

prehistoric archeology, particularly in funerary archeology, and especially in the study of 

human remains. The availability of Dr. Crozier and the fact that paleopathologies supposed 

a new path of research for me did the rest to defining the thesis topic which is proposed 

below (Chapter 1).

1. INTRODUCTION: THESIS STATEMENT 
AND GOALS. 

 
 

1.1. DELIMITATION OF THE TOPIC OBJECT OF STUDY. 

While was clear that the work was going to be focused in the study of a skeletal assemblage 

from a prehistoric site in the Philippines, now it was time to choose between the various 

options available: which would be the actual bone collection to study or on which build the 

proposed study? After several e-mails, Dr. Crozier proposed two different collections 

among those from the ASP archive: Catanauan (Quezon, Bondoc Peninsula) or Ille Cave 

(New Ibajay, el Nido, Palawan Island). Finally we chose the second case, because of the 

best status of preservation of the collection. 

Although the following chapters will discuss in detail the archaeological case of Ille Cave 

(Chapter 2), it is necessary to provide a brief overview of the phase sequence of the site, as 

it was vital to define the topic of final work. As will be seen in Chart 1.1, it was possible to 

make a sufficiently robust analysis of stratigraphy and materials to offer a basic chrono-

cultural sequence, either from some absolute dating or mainly by relative dating of the 

various layers and archaeological contexts. Chart 1.1 provides a good picture of said 

sequence (PAZ, 2012, pp.142-152). As we may deduct from the chronocultural scheme, 

two different funerary typologies have been observed at Ille Cave: cremations and burials. 

Since other teams in the ASP are already focusing their work on cremations (LARA et al., 

2013), was decided to eliminate them from the study.  

As this project was focused on the analysis of prehistoric human remains, a sample of 20 

burials from the earliest phase to the Metal Age phase were selected for study. Thus our 

efforts would focus on those first burials, the "Neolithic" stage and the period associated 

with metallurgy (marking a wide chronological range from more than 4000 years ago until 

c.1000 years ago). The truth is that the stratigraphy of the superior layers is quite chaotic, 

and the lack of absolute dating did not facilitate the work in this direction (Chapter 2): was

quite complicated to put a superior clear limit to the upper layers, in order to distinguish the 

limit between the prehistoric phase and the

This phase doesn´t include any sing of human activity yet (just some wild 

animal remains). 

C.9000-C.4000 Y.A. 

 

This phase opens the human presence part of the sequence, including the 

cremation cemetery. 

&gt;4000 Y.A. This phase includes the first two aceramic shell middens and also the first two 

inhumations in the sequence: context 874 and 727. 

C.4000-C.2000 Y.A. Another shell midden in which the ceramic starts to be present, the inhumation 

phenomenon continues. 

C.2000-C.1000 Y.A. Metal period sequence: appearance of the metallic implements, lingling-o 

amulets in jade and shell, more layers of shell midden. 

C.1000-C.100 Y.A. Phase of contacts, in which tradeware ceramics (China, Vietnam, Thailand) 

start to be present. Indopacific glass beads in some burials, but the ceramics are

colonial one. That’s why a global analysis will be referred within this chronological 

framework, which could include some individuals of transitional moments. 

Also, another researcher from ASP is currently examining the non-adult remains, so the 

analysis will focus in adult individuals, unless the evolution of the work would require us to 

expand the age ratio. 

So then, we can state the thesis which I will present here as a study of the paleopathologies 

present in the adult human remains of prehistoric times (&gt;4000-c.1000 years ago) of Ille 

Cave (Palawan, Philippines).

1.2. AIMS AND GOALS. 

Once the thesis topic had been decided, it was necessary to outline the goals of the study: 

? Assess the evidence for pathological lesions on the prehistoric human remains from 

Ille Cave, Palawan. 

? Establish a laboratorial procedure that would help us to systematize the approach to 

each individual, and also develop a file system (catalogue) which would allow us to 

record and present the results of our analysis in a clear way. 

? Determine the age and sex of each individual. 

? The determination of the stature of the individuals is not part of the present study, 

since the preservation status of the assemblage made it impossible (missing or 

fragmented epiphysis of the long bones: BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994, pp.69-

85; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.398-400). 

? Differential diagnosis of possible pathologies present in the collection to study. 

? Establish, if possible, relations between the documented pathologies and other 

population factors (sex, age, possible activities, lifestyles, etc.) that could allow their 

explanation or understanding in a sociocultural context. Ethnographical resources 

would be really useful to answer this question. 

? Establish also frequency relations of these pathologies with the ones present in other 

collections studied in other relevant sites in Southeast Asia. 

1.3. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LITERATURE REVIEW. 

As in any scientific study, specifically of an archaeological nature, before the stage of 

laboratory work (Chapter 3) an investigation of the existing literature is essential: it is 

necessary to understand well the site under study, its chrono-cultural sequence, materials 

(not just osteological remains), their contexts (especially the funerary, and considering the 

stratigraphic relationship between them, what could allow the development of the said 

sequence of phases of Ille). “What is known about Ille Cave? What kinds of studies have 

been conducted? What results have been obtained?” 

The documentary phase was initiated by the exhaustive search of the broadest possible 

literature about the site, its materials, its stratigraphy, dating, etc. Also, for ensuring the

understanding of the contexts in which the burials appear, the graphic documentation 

obtained during excavation (photography, drawing, mapping, stratigraphic relationships 

expressed by Harris Matrix, which were kindly provided by Drs. Paz and Lewis) was a 

great help. 

As for the search of more specific literature, relating to work on human remains issues, 

knowledge of the subject by Dr. Crozier was fundamental: her extensive knowledge of 

written literature on working methods allowed to establish a basic bibliography of 

reference, on which later work would allow the location of new references and search for a 

more specific literature (for example, in cases of more specific diseases that were 

documented during the laboratory analysis of the collection). In that sense, the library of the 

ASP and the Central Library of the UP Diliman campus offered me all written sources in 

relation to the different aspects of work. Finally, the website of the UP library offered a 

very useful search tool organized by fields, also recurrent for developing own references 

(www.ilib.upd.edu.ph).

2. ILLE CAVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE 
OF THE PHILIPPINE PREHISTORIC 

ARCHAEOLOGY. 

 
 

2.1. THE SPATIAL FRAMEWORK OF THE STUDY CASE: THE ISLAND OF 

PALAWAN. GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY. 

The island of Palawan (Philippines), in which the archaeological site of Ille Cave is located 

and which location is displayed in Plate 2.1, is part of the Visayas region, and is located on 

the Southwestern part of the archipelago, in the North of Borneo Island. 

Geologically speaking, the island can be divided in two main groups (Plate 2.2): the 

Northern part of the main island (together with the Coron group) and the Southern half of it 

have completely different geological characterizations. While the Northern part deposits 

can be characterized as Paleozoic and Mesozoic base deposits, over which the intrusion of 

new materials and alteration of them will play a special roll in some areas (MÜLLER, 

1991, pp.121-122); the Southern part of the main island is mainly composed with Cretacic, 

Tertiary and Quaternary deposits, which suffered different process within can be 

highlighted the intrusion of mafic materials. 

Northern Palawan (Plate 2.3) is constituted mainly by Upper Paleozoic and Lower 

Mesozoic sediments, which in some regions suffered deformations and metamorphic 

process during the Early Jurassic era (YUMUL et al., 2009, pp.612). Latter, this geological 

sequence suffered different intrusions of plutonic rocks, which caused subsequence 

overlain by sediments offshore (Eocene). All the Northern part of the main Palawan Island 

and the Calamian group can be defined, according to their composition, as uplifted 

basement limestone and chert. Also, some igneous groups contributed to this complex 

system with intruder materials in the Kapoas Peninsula, the Ulugan Bay and the Manguao 

volcanic area.

The geology of Northern Palawan can also be divided in two main areas (YUMUL et al., 

2009, pp.612-613), which separate the complex in two main areas (again N/S) from 

Calauag Bay: 

? In the Northern part (where Ille Cave site is located: section 2.2), the outcrops of 

Guinlo formation overlie the Busuanga formation, consisting in massive quartzose 

sandstones with episodes of conglomerates and mudstones. Possibly their origins 

can reach the Middle Permian. El Nido area, in particular, is rich in stunning 

limestone karts towers, such as the one under which Ille Cave is settled. 

? In the Southern part, over the Busuanga formation, the Caramay schist complex 

(muscovites, schists, quartzs, micas and graphits) and the Conception phyllites 

(phyllite mudstones, siltstones, sandstones and met-sediments) form the basement 

deposits, covering almost the entire area. The metamorphic rocks are considered to 

come from the Carboniferous and Permian eras (some of the oldest geological 

materials in the Philippines).

2.2. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF ILLE CAVE: STRATIGRAPHICAL 

ANALYSIS, ABSOLUTE DATAS AND MATERIAL CULTURE. 

The archaeological site of Ille Cave is located in Barangay New Ibajay, El Nido, Northern 

Palawan (coordinates: 11 11´ 50´´-11 12´ N, 119 30´ 15´´-119 31´ 20´´ E. The site is in the 

base of a limestone karts tower (Plate 2.4), in the platform under the rockshelter and both 

the main entrances to the cavity in the karst (designated as North and West Mouths: Plate 

2.5). The karst, of about 75 meters height, is located about 5 km. inland from the closest sea 

line, the eastern coast of Northern Palawan, at 118 meters above the sea level (PAZ et al., 

2013, pp.8-11).  

The site has been excavated since its discovery in 1998, and has been part of the Palawan 

Paleohistoric Research Project which the ASP – UP Diliman has been carrying out since 

2004, together with other archaeological sites in Dewil Valley (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.6). 

 

PLATE 2.4. Ille karst tower (Archaeological Studies Program). 

As can be observed in the map of Plate 2.6, several trenches have already been opened in 

the archaeological site of Ille (till season 2013, year in which finish the published 

literature). The understanding of their spatial distribution is necessary before approach the 

analysis of the stratigraphical sequence and the main events registered in each trench, 

which follows.

PLATE 2.6. Map of the excavation areas in Ille Cave archaeological site (ASP, Emil Robles). 

? 2.2.1. East Mouth trench. 

The origins of this trench, the first one opened by the ASP team in 2004 (together with the 

West Mouth and the Outlier trenches), are in a previous smaller test pit opened in 1999 and 

extended in 2002 (when a first group of radiocarbon dating from the upper layers was 

obtained, pointing to c.10000 BP, what justified the effort of excavating the site), around 

which posterior treasure hunter digs where reported (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.11). 

The ASP unified all this preliminary excavations in a bigger trench, which would cover the 

entrance area of the East mouth of the cavity, over the external platform. 

In 2004, the team opened a trench of 4.5x3 meters, cleaned the profiles of the treasure 

hunter spit and was able to prove the presence of a shell midden layer at around 55 cm. 

from the surface. Over it, and even cutting it in some cases, the first post-Neolithic 

inhumations started to appear (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.11), reaching a number of 24 

cases, with no signs of grave goods. Mixed in the matrix, also the first signs of material

culture where documented: sherds of earthenware and tradeware (mainly X century China) 

ceramics, glass beads, stone and shell tools, and even some small metallic rings. 

The excavation in the season of 2005 continued exposing the stratigraphy of the site by 

expanding the sector, in which the same kind of material culture was appearing, and in 

which another 15 burials where recovered (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.8-12). Also, this season 

offered some interesting absolute dates: 7000-9000 BP for the shell midden and 8000-

10500 BP for some charcoal samples recovered in the levels under it (so, middle Holocene 

shell midden and early Holocene in situ burning evidences).  

One of the highlights of 2005 season was the recovering of the first case of Neolithic burial 

(LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.18): the context 727, which appeared at 60-80 cm. depth from the 

datum point. Several grave goods where founded in situ, in clear association with the 

burial: a large turbo marmoratus shell close to the left hand, over the chest (possibly was 

holding it); a pair of manufactured shell disks (conus sp.) close to the left forearm, plus 

another one in the waist; and a group of smaller shell beads and pig tusks underneath the 

forearm disks. The group located close to the forearm was interpreted as a decorative 

manufacture made of the shells and the animal bones (Plate 2.7: LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.18-

19). Although the burial was recovered over the shell midden levels, is possible that it 

partially cut them in the feet area.

In the bottom levels excavated in 2005, a new funerary practice was registered for the first 

time beside the inhumations: the first pre-Neolithic cremation (context 758: Plate 2.8), at 

130-148 cm. depth (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.20). The pile of fragmented and burnt bones 

overlaid a decayed limestone. Posterior laboratorial analysis where overtaken in this first 

case of cremation (LARA et al., 2013), suggesting that the body was disarticulated and 

defleshed, the cranium smashed and some long bones broken, before being burnt in 

different levels and the remains were recovered and put in a container. 

 

PLATE 2.8. First cremation registered in Ille Cave East Mouth trench (LARA et al., 2013). 

Under the cremation (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.16), some sterile layer was registered (context 

806), under which appeared another one (context 866) which included some lithic 

implements and possible worked animal bones (deer antler). This older phase, 

unfortunately, couldn´t be dated yet by the end of 2005 season, but it´s study will continue 

in following years. 

In 2006, the team reopened the trench at the same levels. This season was profitable from 

the perspective of the funerary archaeology in the cremation cemetery phase, since another 

three cases where recovered from the same levels in which the 2005 cremation was founded 

(VV.AA., 2007, pp.13). Also, direct radiocarbon dating over bone samples from the 

cremation and of the sediments around it pointed to a data of approximately 9000 BP. At

around 4.5 meters depth, the excavation continued documenting the sterile levels registered 

under the cremations since the previous season. 

The results of the 2008 excavation season offered another positive result: another two 

cremations (context 1358, with an obsidian flake associated, and the smaller context 1370) 

in the same level than the previously four cases reported (PAZ et al., 2008, pp.17-18). Also, 

the cultural deposits underneath offered a new date which brought the sequence to dates as 

old as 12000 and 14000 BP.

PLATE 2.10. Stratigraphical section of the East wall of the East Mouth trench (ASP). 

? 2.2.2. East Chamber trench &amp;amp; East Mouth Connection trench. 

During 2005 season, the ASP direction decided to open a 2x3 meters trench inside the East 

chamber of the cavity (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.30-33). An infant burial (context 783) was 

recovered, as well as similar material culture as the one recovered from other excavation 

trenches (ceramics and porcelains, faunal remains, batissa violacea and neritidae sp. shells) 

and some small shell accumulations which possibly come from the same phase of the shell 

middens. More accumulations of animal bones where recovered during the 2009 season 

(PAZ et al., 2009, pp.22). 

In 2009, the connection trench with East Mouth trench was inaugurated. In the following 

year, up to 5 hearths where registered in the same paleosurface (PAZ et al., 2010, pp.19-



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

20). 2011 was interesting for understanding the depositions of accumulations of animal 

bones, which where interpreted as the result of a surface flow of water, which dragged the 

remains inside the cavity (PAZ et al., 2011, pp.25). 

In 2012, the data of the deeper archaeological context documented in the East Chamber 

trench offered a terminal Pleistocene chronology: 10000-12000 BP (PAZ et al., 2012, 

pp.32). By the end of next year season, 2013, in which the fluvial and colluvial deposits 

were still been excavated, the trench was closed at the depth of 280 cm. from the datum 

point (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.29). 

? 2.2.3. East-West Connection trench.  

Since 2009, the connection trench between the two main trenches of Ile Cave, the ones of 

East and West Mouths, was starting to be excavated. In the first year, three post-Neolithic 

inhumations from the intensive burial phase where recovered, together with big 

accumulations of tradeware and earthenware ceramics (PAZ et al., 2009, pp.22). 

2010 brought in this sector the finding of the 7
th

 cremation documented in Ille (context 

2228), together with another inhumation in the upper layers and another lingling-o pendant 

(the third in the site made in tridacna sp. shell) which felt down from one of the walls of 

the trench while cleaning (PAZ et al., 2010, pp.21). Also, a paleosurface with another 

possible hearth was registered. 

In 2012, the excavation in this trench continued, and was possible to document another 

paleosurface with some possible post holes. Also, the first inhumation in flexed position in 

the site (context 2240) was recovered (PAZ et al., 2012, pp.41-42). Portions of the shell 

midden where already being exposed by the end of 2013 season, when the trench was 

closed at a depth of approximately one meter (PAZ et al., 2013, pp.30).

? 2.2.4. West Mouth trench. 

The systematic excavation carried out from the ASP started in 2004, extending over some 

previous test pits, opened in the platform in front of the West mouth of the cave. The 

excavated area, of around 3.5x2.5 meters, arrived to a depth of 2.3 meters from the datum 

point by the end of this first season, in which post-Neolithic levels where documented. The 

main events registered in the stratigraphy where some burials of the upper layers (total of 8, 

counting the ones from the previous test pits, without grave goods: Plate 2.14), a rock fall 

(at which level the previous year test pits stopped) and the first cases of hearths 

documented in the site (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.12). About the material culture, 

mixed with the fills of the burials, where recovered different materials: shells (highlighting 

some fragments of tridacna sp.), pottery sherds (native and imported) and numerous glass 

and shell beads (including lingling-o and a piece of a shell bracelet).

PLATE 2.14. Some examples of the post-Neolithic cemetery burials (inhumations). The absence of 

grave goods in this phase can be appreciated (ASP). 

The post-Neolithic cemetery continued been excavated during the 2005-2006 seasons 

(LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.21-30), in which the presence of batissa violacea shells was 

noticed in the layers, although not in clear association with the inhumations. Some metallic 

implements (mainly copper implements in 2006, iron fractured blades and some punctual 

cases of gold rings in 2006) were also documented. About the ceramics, the recovery of 

several fragments of big jars (Sa Huynh-Kalanay type), normally used for jar burials, 

complicated the interpretation of the site. Nowadays there are still no proves of a jar burial 

cemetery in Ille Cave, although it exist the possibility that where surface votive offerings 

that got fragmented and mixed with the backfill sediment of the burials (LEWIS et al., 

2006, pp.24). Also, under the burial layers, ceramic materials continued appearing (now 

ascribed to Neolithic typologies), as well as faunal remains and lithic implements. But the 

highlight discovery of these seasons was the intentional burial of a dog, an interesting 

marker of animal domestication (LEWIS et al., 2006, pp.26).

PLATE 2.15. Dog burial documented in the West Mouth trench (ASP). 

The main even recovered from the West Mouth trench in 2007 season (VV.AA., 2007, 

pp.13) was the context 1626: a big amount of mammalian bones and shells where founded 

together with stone tools. Together with it was observed the presence of a level of aceramic 

shell midden, underlying the upper one (Plate 2.17). Also, another special inhumation 

(context 874) was recovered under a stone marker (which the directors of the excavation 

interpreted as a “boat-shaped marker”: PAZ, 2012, pp.144), covered by red pigment and 

which had two big melo sp. shells on the right chest and a necklace of conus sp. and 

monkey teeth (Plate 2.18).

? 2.2.5. West Mouth Connection trench. 

Opened for the first time in 2007, for connecting the West Mouth and the Outlier trenches. 

As expected, several human remains where recovered also in the upper layers of the 

stratigraphy, as part of the post-Neolithic inhumation cemetery (VV.AA., 2007, pp.13). The 

trench, of 1x4 meters, arrived at 120 cm. depth at the end of its first excavation season 

without any other particular finding, furthermore the materials observed in the main 

trenches for this phase. 

? 2.2.6. West Mouth West Extension trench. 

Opened in 2008 for avoiding the collapse of the West Mouth trench. During this season, the 

stratigraphy followed the organization of the West Mouth: upper layers which mixed 

different materials (where the first lingling-o made on green mica was recovered, together 

with the typical materials ascribed for this period shown in other trenches) with some post-

Neolithic inhumations and the starting of the shell midden layers, where the excavation 

stopped (PAZ et al., 2008, pp.15-16). During the next seasons, similar burials and materials 

where registered in the deeper layers (PAZ et al., 2012, pp.46). By the close of 2013 

campaign, the depth of the trench was in 62-77 cm. from the datum point (PAZ et al., 2013, 

pp.27). 

? 2.2.7. Outlier trench. 

The third trench opened in the first systematic excavation season (ASP, 2004), further away 

of the rock shelter, in order to try to avoid the intensive burial activity for digging faster and 

discovering what would laid under (PAZ, RONQUILLO, 2004, pp.12-13). The trench, of 

2x2 meters, reached a depth of around 125 cm. Up to three post-Neolithic burials where 

discovered at around 60 cm. depths, one of them (context 69/77) specially interesting 

because of preserving some Indo-Pacific beads in situ. At the depth of almost a meter, an 

accumulation of pig bones where founded under a rock, presumably covered with hematite. 

Tradeware and earthenware ceramic sherds where founded in all the archaeological levels, 

which corresponded with the ones documented in the West Mouth trench.

PLATE 2.19. Stratigraphy of the West Mouth West Extension (WMWE) trench (ASP, Emil Robles). 

In 2009 (2009, pp.23) this trench was opened again, and excavated till a depth of 2 meters, 

revealing new burials of the same phase (Metal Ages and Contact phase). 

? 2.2.8. West Mouth Long trench. 

Opened in 2007, with the idea of a better understanding of the geology of the platform. A 

copper axe was founded at 30 cm. depth, but no burial was recorded, until the recovery of 

an individual inhumation in 2009 (PAZ et al., 2009, pp.23-24). 

? 2.2.9. Iihan trench.  

Open for the first time in 2006. During this first season and the following, 2007 (which 

closed the trench in a depth of 160 cm.), a shell midden with pottery sherds and a stone 

adze where documented in this trench, together with a bifacial stone tool recovered from 

the surface in a close location (VV.AA., 2007, pp.13).

2.3. THE CHRONO-CULTURAL SEQUENCE OF ILLE CAVE. 

Thanks to the study of the stratigraphy registered in the several open trenches in the site of 

Ille Cave, the chrono-cultural sequence of phases has been defined as follows (PAZ et al., 

2009, pp.41-43): 

A. Current phase (Late XIX century – Present). Remains of the ancestors of the 

current inhabitants of El Nido for the last c.100 years. Agricultural-based cultures 

(cereal). XX century material culture. 

B. Ritual intensification phase (c.2000 years ago - late XIX century). Presence of 

burials (Neolithic-Contact phase). Funerary practice: inhumations, oriented to SW, 

no grave goods associated. Possible secondary burials associated with jars (first 

earthenware, latter tradeware ceramics -evidence of contact with mainland Asia-), 

not buried but deposited in the cavity. Possibly the different rituals correspond to 

different cultures and timing. 

C. Dominantly habitation phase (c.6000-c.2000 years ago). Middle Holocene shell 

middens and hearth deposits (which include remains of food consumed) justify the 

use of the place as a campsite, or perhaps more permanent habitation area. Funerary 

practice: inhumations, oriented to NE, associated grave goods (hammer stones and 

shells -manufactured or not-). Possible secondary burials, ossuaries. 

D. Non-pottery habitation phase (c.8000-c.6000 years ago). Shell middens which 

justify the habitation. No signs of ceramic technology, but strong presence of shell 

utilization. Possibly the boat-marked burial belongs to this phase. 

E. Habitation and cremation cemetery phase (c.10000-c.8000 years ago). Funerary 

practice: cremations. Presence of animal remains, not yet domesticated. Signs of a 

different landscape that the one shown in earlier phases: remains of tiger, deer, 

estuarine shells (dryer and more open, not so much vegetation, grass extensions). 

F. Campsite phase (c.12000-c.10000 years ago). First lithic implements, signs of 

technology. 

The following Chart 2.1 shows a summary of this ritual and economic characterizations for 

every cultural phase of the sequence.

3. METHODS OF LABORATORIAL 
ANALYSIS IN HUMAN OSTEOLOGY. 

 
 

3.1. THE INVENTORY OF HUMAN REMAINS AND THE FINAL STUDY 

ASSEMBLAGE. MINIMAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (MNI). 

Before we began the study of the human remains of Ille Cave, it was necessary to define 

which part of the extensive collection of skeletons should focus the analysis. The initial 

idea was to study the prehistoric populations of Ille after the earlier burials, as introduced in 

the Chapter 1 – Chart 1.1 (including these first cases). This would immediately exclude two 

groups of funerary contexts clearly represented in the stratigraphy: 

? The cremation cemetery (7 cases, lower levels of stratigraphy): made sense to omit 

in our study, since other investigators from ASP focused their analysis on them 

(LARA et al., 2013). 

? The phase of burials of colonial times (higher levels, part of the phase of intensive 

burials): was omitted here because the aim of this study is to analyze the 

populations previous to the Spanish contact phase. 

In order to omit this cases, the official ASP-UP Diliman inventory of human remains from 

the site was used as a primary source, which has been developing and changing in recent 

years by the team of archaeologists from Palawan, and which consultation was provided to 

us from the ASP itself. The inventory consists of a list of archaeological contexts including 

human bones, as well as detailed information about the anatomical parts represented and 

initial results of sexing and age determination in some individuals (although our work 

included both aspects as part of the process of our own analysis approach). 

The case of the discard of the colonial individuals was somehow more complex: the 

stratigraphy of the upper levels of Ille Cave, as we saw in the previous chapter, offers 

considerable interpretative problems, given the chaotic organization of the strata due to 

intense funerary activity for a long period of time and the lack of absolute chronologies

from skeletal contexts. Current understanding of the phasing derives from the interpretation 

of the various archaeological materials, as well as the composition of documented strata 

and their stratigraphic relationships, leading to a process of relative dating (for example: 

comparative chronologies with what we have before or after inside this sequence). 

In that sense, the assistance of Dr. Helen Lewis, co-director of the archaeological site of Ille 

Cave, was essential. Responsible for preparing the complex Harris Matrix, Dr. Lewis 

knows better than anyone the stratigraphy of Ille, and was able to isolate a number of 

individuals who definitely belonged to what is referred as the colonial phase. Thanks to that 

list of individuals we solve, at least partially, the problems of chronocultural definition of 

our study. 

Beyond this, our study sought to focus attention on adult individuals, since other specialists 

in the ASP are currently working on non-adult remains. Therefore, and based on the 

information in the inventory and Harris Matrix, the group of non-adults was also omitted. 

In the table below, we can see all individuals omitted in the study (Chart3.1), as well as the 

reason for the dismissal:

The comparison between this table of discarded cases and the contexts recorded in the 

inventory of the ASP offer us the list of skeletons to study, knowing certainty that they 

would come from the central phase of the stratigraphy. It was hard to define which of them 

all exactly belong to the prehistoric or pre-colonial phase, and which of them would come 

from a transition phase to the new cultural and economic models. The analysis of 

associated materials doesn´t gave us too much information, as many skeletons didn´t appear 

directly associated with material culture, but a priori the premise showed valid until a 

better definition of the cultural sequence of Ille Cave. 

In any case, the MNI (minimum number of individuals) represented in this assemblage 

selected for the study is 20: it coincides with the number of contexts selected, since was 

noticed that every craft associated to each context contented the human remains of a 

separate individual, without any bone which could point to the presence of more individuals 

mixed in the assemblage (in this sense the human remains where well organized in the ASP 

before the start of the project). 

3.2. STARTING LABORATORIAL PROCEEDINGS. CLEANUP OF HUMAN 

REMAINS. 

The laboratory work procedure was also systematized in a series of steps we would take out 

on each of the contexts we wanted to study, and that can be summarized in the following 

points: 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

1. Location of context to study at the human remains archive ("Palawan room") and 

manual transport to the laboratory. 

2. Careful unpacking of the human remains on the work table. 

3. Lying out of skeletal remains in anatomical position. 

4. Cleaning of human remains (if necessary). 

5. Inventory of the bones present in each individual, as well as comments on 

conservation status, and collection of data in the corresponding file. 

6. General photography of the skeleton in anatomical position. 

7. Determination of gender and age by various methods (vide infra: 3.4 and 3.5) and 

data collection of the results in another specific file model. 

8. Macroscopic analysis of surfaces looking for the various pathologies present in the 

individual and its justification by differential diagnosis, as well as data collection in 

a separated file. 

9. If necessary, microscopic or X-ray approach to certain bones which possibly would 

require a more specific analysis in order to define the differential diagnosis. 

10. Photography of observed pathological lesions. 

11. Careful packaging of human remains and transfer back to the store of human 

remains. 

In the case of the packaging system of human remains, mention here that the ASP follows a 

specific system: numbered boxes organized by context within which the human remains are 

packaged in sets of bones that represent the various anatomical sections (skull, torso, pelvic 

girdle, shoulders, arms, hands, legs and feet), showing a specific label in each bag that 

contains elements. The bones are organized inside the box, as far as possible, through a 

system that ensures that groups of heavier bones occupy the bottom of the box, so that the 

most delicate remain above and do not support excessive weights which could lead to 

damage. The ASP human osteology laboratory follows procedures in packing skeletons as 

recommended by Barc, University of Bradford (Plate 3.1).

PLATE 3.1. Diagram which displays the correct way of packing skeletal remains. We can appreciate 

the fact that the most heavy groups should be concentrated in the bottom of the craft, in order to 

preserve better the lighter ones in the top (From: University of Bradford, UK). 

The work space also required specific preparation and constant maintenance and cleaning. 

Since the space provided in the laboratory of osteology had a hard, rigid surface (tiles), a 

double layer to lay the bones, consisting of two materials was prepared: a first layer of 

bubble wrap, to cushion contact of the bones with the hard surface, and a second surface 

layer of cardboard of a coloration that was not present in the human remains (a blue tint 

that would standardize the surface while facilitating the process of photo shoot). 

The lay of human remains in anatomical position was made following the traditional model 

in extended supine position (Plate 3.2), with legs and feet parallel in top view, arms also 

parallel to the torso and hands facing up. In case of missing skeletal parts, was tried to 

maintain anatomical spaces, to facilitate a better understanding of the skeleton and more 

effective photographic record.

PLATE 3.2. Individual 2247 from Ille Cave, displayed over the work space in anatomical position.  

Sometimes the cleaning of human remains was necessary to facilitate their study (Plate 

3.3): when requested, a dry cleaning of the bones was carried out, using soft bristled brush 

or wooden sticks, with several repetitions but without making excessive force that could 

affect the samples. In very specific cases, where the sediment adhering to the bones could 

not be easily removed, "wet" cleaning was the best option: in this case the bone surface was 

never directly wet (much less placed under water directly), but the bristles of the brush 

slightly moistened prior to brushing the samples. 

As can be deduced from the work plan above, restoration work was not carried out (any 

consolidation or glue process, because we wanted to avoid chemical affection on the bone 

structure). Unfortunately was not possible to make any kind of cleaning of the profuse 

concretions which were affecting several of different bone surfaces, since this procedure 

requires the use of chemicals (such as dilute acetic acid) which were not available.

PLATE 3.3. Photographic sequence taken during the process of bone cleaning: dry cleaning with wood 

stick (left and central images) and wet cleaning with brush (right). 

3.3. INVENTORY, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PRELIMINARY MACROSCOPICAL 

ANALYSIS. 

Once the complete skeleton had this initial treatment outlined above (section 3.2), it was 

time to start recording it. For that was made a first specific file of data collection relating to 

the inventory, organized in anatomical sections, including all the bones present in each 

individual (also dental pieces, annotated by the FMI international system). Also was 

performed a briefly outlining about their level of fragmentation and which parts of each 

bone were present or not (vid infra: 3.7 and Annex I). 

In parallel, and continuously during the rest of the process of data collection over the 

human remains, was initiated at this time a phase of photographic work, for the preparation 

of the corresponding photographical archive, which would serve to illustrate both this paper 

and the files catalog itself, and that at the same time would serve as visual justification of 

the various interpretations given to the human remains. 

The photographs were taken with a reflex camera: model Canon EOS 600DTM, with 

58mm objective. At no time tripod or support element was used either for lack of 

availability or practical reasons, given the conditions of the workspace (as can be observed 

in Plate 3.4).

Two complementary photographic series can be distinguished, for which external 

conditions change significantly: 

? Main series: this is the serial used to capture from the vertical the complete skeleton 

in anatomical position (which would associate the inventory of individual bones), 

using both adjustment and automatic focus. Blue background was used to clearly 

mark the boundaries of the image. In addition, each individual would be 

accompanied by a chart with the number of context to which it belongs, as well as a 

metric scale (an IFRAO scale was used because, besides marking ten centimeters 

and being more visible in the final picture, it adds additional information about 

color that could be of interest). The photographs were pulled from the vertical, 

orthogonal to the plane surface and without the use of flash, but serving the artificial 

lights of the own laboratory and auxiliary lights in some specific cases. In some 

cases the height of the laboratory is not high enough to capture the entire extended 

skeleton: in these cases two separate pictures were taken, with an area of overlap of 

at least 30%, so that a photogrammetric composition could be made with both the 

shots, corrected by using Photoshop
TM

. 

? Macro/details series: in this case the macro mode is used with manual focusing and 

adjustment, and again on blue background, but with a smaller metric scale (5 

centimeters). In some cases it was not possible to include images scale due to the 

difficult positioning in the working plane of skeletal remains which were too fragile, 

but the necessary measurements could be obtained from general pictures. We shoot 

the photos as orthogonally as possible in the case of general views of whole bones, 

while in the case of photographs of detail this standard became secondary, intending 

to best reflect the areas of interest. In this series the use of additional artificial lights 

became a mandatory part of the process, in order to bring out details by the use of 

light.

PLATE 3.4. For the photographical register The use of artificial auxiliary lights, a uniformed color 

background and different measurement scales was also recurrent, in order to present as much 

information as possible in each series (right). 

3.4. SEX DETERMINATION. 

In reference to the sex determination of the individuals, a number of methods are employed, 

based in physiological aspects or skeletal landmarks that vary in men and women between 

populations. In the Plate 3.5, for example, we can see the case of the skull in men and 

women: in general terms, the male is larger and heavier, with more apparent muscle 

attachments, further development of the occipital prominence and mastoid (in the 

supramastoid, female is more curved ridge and ends on the acoustic meatus) and the 

supraorbital ridge, causing a rounded supraorbital margin (FLANDER, 1978). 

The elements showing the sexual dimorphism become especially visible in the skull and 

pelvic girdle, so analyzing the morphology of both will be relatively easy to determine the 

sex of the individual to which they belong (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994). To do this, 

analysis over a series of landmarks in both the skull (Chart3.2, Plate 3.6) and the pelvis 

(Chart 3.3, Plates 3.7 and 3.8) was committed separately, which are listed in the charts 

below, and ideally identifiable as male or female according to its shape, by macroscopic 

observation and comparison with the reference collection of the ASP laboratory or with 

literature references (including comparative photographs and designs). Finally, the sum of 

all values will enable us to determine the sex of the

individual, depending on whether more values of one sex or the other among those granted 

to each landmark is repeated. 

In case this method is not applicable (no skull or pelvis present, or are highly fragmented, 

etc), it is possible to employ other methods based on the measurement of various bones and 

compared to “cut off” or discriminant equations (methods of osteometrical-statistical basis): 

the maximum length of the tibia, the vertical length of the glenoid fossa or diameter of the 

head of the humerus are just some examples (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.387-392). 

Although the present study is based in the methodologies referred, since there is not much 

statistical information of reference in the case of the ancient Philippine populations.

3.5. DETERMINATION OF THE AGE AT DEATH. 

Growth processes are also reflected in the human skeleton, and so does the degenerative 

processes that lead maturity to senescence. The reflection of them will serve, in a similar 

way to that seen for sexual determination, to identify the age that the study subjects had 

reached before death. 

While sometimes a method can give a largely reliable result, is always better to use several 

to get more accurate conclusions. Therefore, all possible methods had been applied in each 

case exposed below. 

It is important to consider two factors before exposing the various methodologies used to 

determine the age: 

? The younger the person, the more accurate the age we get as result of our analysis, 

given the homogeneity of the processes of growth compared to the individual 

irregularities of physical deterioration in the elderly (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, 

pp.363). 

? We can´t give an exact number as result of our ageing process: the result of our 

analysis is always given by an approximate range of years (WHITE, FOLKENS, 

2005, pp.364). 

 

To express these age ranges, resort to the following table of intervals (Chart 3.4. - BAKER 

et al. 2005; BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994): 

Chart 3.4. AGE RANGES IN THE AGE DETERMINATION PROCESS

? 3.5.1. Degree of fusion of the epiphysis. 

The first method to determine the age of an individual may be the degree of fusion of the 

epiphysis of various bones of the skeleton (MCKERN, STEWART, 1957), a method 

especially useful for infant-juvenile cases, but which fails for adults, since the last epiphysis 

which is completely fused, the medial epiphysis of the clavicle, closes in around 30 years 

old. The peculiarity of this method is that the merging of the various epiphysis occur in a 

predictable sequence (as in Plate 3.9), so if we look at the progress status in the merger of 

them we can define more precisely the age range in which the individual was (with the 

limit, as we say, in &gt;30 years old, when all appear fused and the method is not so useful 

anymore). 

? 3.5.2. Fusion of the cranial sutures. 

Another similar method is to analyze the level of fusion of the cranial sutures (MEINDL, 

LOVEJOY, 1985), which also reach various levels of fusion throughout life and in a certain 

order, to finish reaching the status of obliteration (maximum degree of closing). In this case 

it is a useful method for individuals who exceed 30 years of age, when these sutures begin 

to fuse significantly. 

There are two sub-methods which focus in different cranial sutures, always analyzed from 

the external surface of the skull (MEINDL, LOVEJOY, 1985): 

- Method of the cranial vault: sutures 1-7 (midlamboid, lambda, obelion, anterior 

sagittal, bregma, midcoronal and pterion). 

- Lateral-anterior method: sutures 6-10 (midcoronal, pterion, sphenofrontal, inferior 

sphenotemporal and superior sphenotemporal). 

 

Depending on the level of fusion, a different value is assigned to each suture (0 = open, 1 = 

starting to obliterate, 2 = almost obliterated, 3 = completely obliterated), always looking to 

the point indicated in the lower charts (Plate 3.10), with a maximum expansion of 1 cm 

around it, and subsequently the values of the two methods are added separately. The score 

will have a range of age associated as a result, range which we can obtain from the 

reference chart (always taking into account the standard deviation associated with the 

result, also expressed in the charts).

48 
 

? 3.5.3. Eruption of the teeth. 

The third method by which we can determine the age is the eruption of teeth (UBELAKER, 

1989), since the replacement of deciduous teeth ("milk” teeth) by the permanent teeth (20-

32 teeth) also follows a rhythm and order along constant growth process, reaching its final 

state around 32 years old (approximate limit of the method, although it varies greatly 

between individuals), as in Plate 3.11.

different grades of fusion of them (superior, right). In the inferior charts, we can observe the age ranges 

expected trough the adding of values by the two different submethods (From: WHITE, BLACK, 

FOLKENS, 2012, pp.392). 

? 3.5.4. Tooth wear analysis (Brothwell). 

Teeth also help determine the age of the owner if we consider the level of tooth wear: 

comparative tables of Brothwell (like the one included in Plate 3.12: BROTHWELL, 1981) 

allow us to establish several approximated age ranges in each population, considering the 

progressive wear of the teeth throughout life, because of the attrition process. The method 

is not useful in cases of non-natural wear patterns: abrasion, dental modification and 

alterations as a result of a specific activity. Hence, as shown in the Plate 3.9, the third molar 

appears in the second age group, and is the last in suffering the wear at the end of the 

process.

? 3.5.5. Pubic symphysis surface. 

Another interesting method of determining age is the method of the pubic symphysis 

(BROOKS, SUCHEY, 1990), which also noticed that this surface thereof suffers a 

degenerative process throughout life, which is also slightly distinguishable depending on

sex. The description of each phase and the comparison with the images published by both 

authors (Plate 3.13) make this one of the methods that allows a greater accuracy: we just 

analyze the material we have and compare it with their descriptions and their sequence of 

images of the process, we assign a degenerative process phase, and finally we compare with 

the reference tables (organized by sex) in order to get a quite accurate age range (Chart3.6). 

The description of each phase of this degenerative process (rated from 1 to 6, as follows) is 

presented in the next table (Chart 3.5). 

Chart 3.5. DEGENERATIVE PROCESS IN THE SURFACE OF THE PUBIC 

SYMPHYSIS (as in BROOKS, SUCHEY, 1990). 

PHASE DESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACE 

1 The surface of the pubic symphysis appears covered with an undulating 

surface (mountains and valleys of horizontal layout). Ossification nodules 

may appear at the top, but at this stage the inferior limit does not appear yet. 

2 Nodules begin to appear defining the bottom edge of the pubic symphysis, 

and also on the top limit if they didn´t had developed from the start of the 

process. You can begin to glimpse a lifting of the central area, or a wall on 

the undulating surface of the ventral side. 

3 Upper and lower limits are shown, as well as the wall on the ventral edge. Is 

already possible to notice some degeneration in the undulating surface. 

4 The surface of the pubic symphysis goes from wavy to grainy, but may be 

still visible remains of the undulating surface. The wall of the ventral side is 

closed with the upper and lower limits, and also develops on the outside, 

leading to a marked oval boundary around the entire surface. Lipping may 

appear in the dorsal edge, as well as some brands in the ventral ligament. 

5 Smooth surface completed, fine sandy texture, the surface is shown as a 

depression with respect to the edge of it. Degeneration and possible rupture 

of the ventral upper edge. More lipping and ligament brands. 

6 Erosion of the edge and wall, erratic ossification processes which give the 

surface a rough appearance.

? 3.5.6. Auricular surface of the ilium. 

Finally, there is another method for calculating the age also based on the degeneration of 

another contact area in the skeleton: the method of the auricular surface of the ilium 

(LOVEJOY et al., 1985). This area also suffers a progressive degeneration (as seen in Plate 

3.14), so LOVEJOY et al. also described phases in a similar way to the previous method 

(section 3.5.5: pubic symphysis method), which also comes with sample images, as 

displayed in Plate 3.11, so that the method again is based on the comparison (after sexing, 

because this method also distinguishes between both sexes) and the recurrence to reference 

tables to establish the age of the individual being studied, based on their equivalence with 

one of said stages of the degenerative process. These stages of degeneration have been 

ranked from 1 to 8, as follows (Chart 3.7). 

Chart 3.7. STAGES OF DEGENERATION OF THE AURICULAR SURFACE 

OF THE ILIUM AND AGE RANGES ASOCIATED  

(as in LOVEJOY et al., 1985). 

STAGE AGE RANGE DESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACE  

1 20-24 years Undulating surface with a fine grain. 

2 25-29 years Less undulating, but retains a youthful look. 

3 30-34 years Stretch marks begging to appear, thickening granulometry. 

4 35-39 years Coarse grain size throughout the surface uniform. 

5 40-44 years Transition to a dense surface, usually in "islands". 

6 45-49 years Fully dense surface without grain. 

7 50-59 years Dense and wrinkled surface, periauricular moderate 

activity. 

8 &gt;60 years Marginal lipping, microporosities, preauricular 

irregularities. 

 

Of course there are countless other studies on various methods of calculating age (looking 

from the external extremity of the ribs to the structure of the spongy tissue of the proximal 

epiphysis of the humerus or femur, within others: WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.381-385),

but the ones shown here are the most frequent and, therefore, we have decided to base our 

study on its functionality.

The data related to sexual diagnosis and estimation of the individual's age were also 

recorded in the corresponding record file model (Chapter 3.7), which also will be attached 

to this work (Annex II). 

3.6. DETERMINATION OF PALEOPATHOLOGIES AND DIFFERENTIAL 

DIAGNOSIS.  

As for the registration of paleopathologies which we carried out on each individual, again 

the direct macroscopic observation would be the procedure to follow: the location of the 

different markers associated with each disease. Through the study of symptoms we could 

understand what kind of pathological condition was affecting each individual, as well as 

analyzing also which anatomical region would suffer this aim. 

For the diagnosis of every disease we turn to two sources that facilitated the comparative 

study: 

- Bibliography and photographs on paleopathology and current pathology. Atlases of 

paleopathology offer a good first approximation, since they distinguish and classify 

the various ailments according to the markers present in the osteological material, 

giving good definitions of the symptoms of each disease and offering visuals 

(photographs, X-rays, etc.) that allow us to establish comparative relationships. For 

more specific cases, the consult of specialized references about particular 

pathologies or case studies was also committed. 

- Reference collection: the comparison with other cases present in the human 

osteology laboratory of ASP. 

It is also important to introduce a concept from the current medical science here which also 

becomes a basic tool in paleopathology studies when defining the disease that we face: the 

differential diagnosis, which involves distinguishing a disease or condition within others 

presenting similar signs and symptoms (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 1994, pp.107-112). 

This process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases was 

used in cases of nosological charts which presented similar manifestations, in order to 

discard those farthest options to the real ones. 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

56 
 

Is also relevant to understand that all diagnoses offered in this and other works on 

paleopathology are always presumptive diagnosis (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, 

pp.33-34): even in modern medicine is sometimes difficult to determine exactly pathology; 

in paleopathology we use to arrive at our diagnosis by exclusion, differential diagnosis, 

what sometimes is not enough to prove, as required by the clinical medicine of our time. 

All information and photographs obtained in relation to each individual paleopathological 

study were recorded in the corresponding file model (vid infra: 3.7) and organized in a files 

catalog which we present appended to this paper (Annex III). 

3.7. MICROSCOPICAL ANALYSIS AND X-RAY: COMPLEMENTARY 

TECHNIQUES. 

When was expected to get some data not shown from direct inspection of human remains, 

also two complementary techniques where used, that serve to guide with certainty the 

nature of the injury: 

- Microscope and binocular lenses (Plates 3.15 and 3.16). The use of a microscope 

(model SMZ-745 C-Leds of Nikon), in which a digital camera was implemented 

(Nikon D5000) was really useful both for the determination of pathological marks 

impossible to detect macroscopically, and also for documenting them through 

photography (this technique was used mainly in cases of DEH or in some unusual 

dental patterns). 

- X-Ray (CHHEM, BROTHWELL, 2008). Radiological analysis was also required 

for the diagnosis of three different pathologies of three different individuals from 

Ille. The UP Health Services equipment and human resources participated in this 

part of the project. Digital radiography was done over the individuals, focusing in 

the anatomical regions of interest, in which a previous macroscopical analysis was 

done in the osteology laboratory.

PLATE 3.15. The use of binocular lenses was especially useful during the laboratory analysis, especially 

for a first microscopical evaluation which didn´t pretend to get into deeper proceedings. 

 

PLATE 3.16. Thanks to the connection of our reflex camera (Nikon D500) to the microscope, and 

trough USB connection to a computer, using the software of the own camera, we were able to prepare a 

microscope which would allow us to make our observations trough the computer screen in a more 

comfortable way, and also to take photographical series for documenting our work.

3.8. THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A 

FILE CATALOGUE. 

All data obtained both in relation to inventory, sexual diagnosis, estimation of the 

individual's age and pathologies present in each case were collected using a digital records 

system (Microsoft Excel
TM

) which is described and presented as many annexes to the next 

work (Annex I-III), as a file catalog data collection: 

? Inventory and bone description files: include the different anatomical regions with a 

list of all the bones in them, so that was possible to specify if they were present or 

not, and also make a brief description about preservation (number of fragments, 

percentage of the bone present, missing parts, etc). 

? Biological profile I (sex and age) files: the results of all the different approaches 

presented before in both cases (3.4. and 3.5.). 

? Biological profile II (paleopathologies) files: compilation of every pathology 

registered in each individual (organized by groups: degenerative joint diseases, 

trauma, dental pathology, infectious, non-specific, etc), describing the symptoms 

and its location, explaining the reasons for the differential diagnosis and attaching 

illustrations.

*NOTE: For reasons of space and narrative, to ease the reading of the results, it has been chosen 

to maintain the differential diagnosis of the pathologies in the files catalogue (Annex III). 

4.1. INTRODUCTION: THE RESULTS OF SEX AND AGE DETERMINATION.  

The laboratory study, brought from the techniques and methodologies described in Chapter 

3, let to study a total of 20 individuals for the period and ageing range defined for our work, 

a minimum number of individuals (MNI) which coincided with the sample of context 

numbers selected for the study (Chapter 3.2).  

The determination of the stature of the individuals is not part of the study because of the 

preservation status made impossible the analysis, as already explained in Chapter 1.2. 

About the age and sex determination of the individuals analyzed, the following situations 

could be defined: 

? 4.1.1. Age estimation (Chart 4.1).  

Of the 20 individuals analyzed, we could age 11 cases, and all of them formed part of our 

study, since they were adult individuals. 

9 cases which couldn´t be aged, presented such a poor status of preservation that no 

pathologies where registered in them. As displayed at the chart below (Chart 4.3), in which 

up to 9 individuals which didn´t show evidence of pathological lesions where recorded, 

sexual diagnosis and estimation of the age of these individuals wasn´t also possible, since 

their condition was really fragmented (for example, in the case of context 1911) or the 

anatomical regions represented didn´t allow us to commit such studies (context 1245, 

context 1803).

? 4.1.2. Sex determination (Chart 4.2). 

The determination on 6 of the 20 individuals was also accomplished. The rest of them 

couldn´t be sexed (recorded as indeterminate sex, “Indet.”), being 9 of them part of the 

group of skeletons which were badly preserved (vide supra: 4.5), and which also couldn´t 

be aged nor presented pathological results.  

The other 6 individuals presented pathologies: 

- 2 clearly male. 

- 1 a probable male.  

- 0 clearly female. 

- 3 probable female.

4.2. PALEOPATHOLOGIES REGISTERED IN THE ASSEMBLAGE. 

As explained before (Chapter 4.1), of the total of 20 individuals studied, 11 of them had 

positive results in terms of identifying pathologies, all of them also sexed (Chapter 4.1.2), 

being the previously discussed 9 cases of bad preservation status the ones which didn´t 

offer positive results (4.1.1). 

In this groups of 9 adults which presented pathologies, the distribution of age ranges was as 

follows: 

- 4 young adults (20-30 years old). 

- 2 middle adults (35-49 years old). 

- 0 old adults (&gt;50 years old).  

- 2 young-middle adults. 

- 3 adults.

Two groups of pathological conditions have been registered in the assemblage, according to 

their anatomical location: 

- Dental pathologies (Chart 4.5): diseases affecting the teeth, the mandible and/or the 

maxilla. Several variables have been documented: signs of infection (root exposure, 

infectious tissue in the alveolar surfaces, calculus, caries), AMTL (ante mortem 

tooth loss), DEH (dental enamel hypoplasia, also referred in the specific 

bibliography as LEH, linear enamel hypoplasia) and different patterns of teeth wear 

(both natural and as a result of the attrition process, as a result of the implication of 

the teeth in different kind of cultural-economical activities). 

- Non-dental pathologies (Chart 4.6): all those documented diseases outside the 

mouth, which were classified into different groups. Various cases of degenerative 

joint diseases were registered (Schmorl's nodes, osteoarthritis in the column or other 

joints, and also non-specific joint diseases), as well as infectious diseases 

(periostitis, osteitis, osteomyelitis), metabolic diseases (cribra orbitalia) and a few 

cases of traumatism (some cases of healed fractures). 

In the following pages, the summary charts of the results of the analysis are displayed, both 

for the age (Chart 4.1) and sex determination (Chart 4.1), and also the distribution of the 

different pathologies (dental and non-dental paleopathologies) beneath the different groups 

of sex and age, as well as the different pathological markers.

4.3. DENTAL PATHOLOGY. 

In 8 of the 20 cases analyzed in Ille Cave, the presence of various dental pathologies 

was documented, although only one of this cases presented a framework of tooth wear 

by attrition (because of the condition of the individual from context 800, part of this 

group: very fragmented, covered with concretions that prevented the analysis of 

surfaces). In all other individuals (contexts 67, 727, 755, 907, 1337, 1825 and 2247) a 

series of teeth pathologies where registered; paleopathologies from which we can infer 

issues of dental health and diet of the study population: exposure of the dental roots, 

brands of infection in the alveolar surfaces of both maxilla and mandible, ante mortem 

teeth loss (AMTL), accumulations of calculus or caries presence. Meanwhile, other 

pathologies such as dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH), allow us to approach from the 

perspective of their subsistence during subadult age. 

Unfortunately, given the limited results inferred of the laboratory study (which was 

positive in the presence of pathologies in only 11 cases out of 20 adults studied, in 

whose group 8 had the indicated teeth conditions), and the fact that sexual diagnosis 

offered no decisive results in many cases (only 2 clear male individuals presenting 

dental pathology, plus a possible male, three possible feminine and two cases where 

sexual diagnosis was not possible), will not allow us to commit comparative studies 

between sexes, which could have led to establish dietary or activity differences between 

the sexes, as has been achieved in other archaeological sites in Southeast Asia later 

(PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.210; OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM 

DUNG, 2010, pp.90). The corresponding statistical chart follows (Chart 4.7). 

All the results obtained for dental pathology, which will be covered below, will be 

interesting for inferring certain patterns regarding dental health, diet and some potential 

activities undertaken within the population represented in the assemblage (Chapter 5).

? 4.3.1. Periodontal disease. Root exposure, alveolar infection, calculus. 

Periodontal disease (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.188-190) involves an 

inflammatory process which responds to the presence of several irritant factors, being 

the main one the presence of bacterial dental plaque (sticky coating formed by proteins, 

food particles and both living and dead microorganisms), or specially the calculus 

deposits (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.185-186), result of the mineralization 

of the plaque, and which can be registered in archeological record in the shape of hard 

concretions over the tooth surface (normally around the junction area between the 

crown and the root (ORTNER, 2003, pp.593; HILLSON, 1996, pp.255). The presence 

of calculus is, then, one of the three markers which allow us to determine a case of 

periodontitis: in the collection of Ille Cave, all the 6 individuals cited (context numbers 

67, 727, 755, 907, 1337 and 2247) presented calculus deposits distributed in the crown-

root area of all the dental pieces.  

Both plaque and calculus suppose a stimulus for the inflammation of the soft tissues 

(gums) around the tooth, known as gingivitis. The untreated gingivitis can develop to 

cases of periodontitis, in which also the alveolar bone suffers the infection (ORTNER, 

2003, pp.593). The second marker which permits the diagnosis of this pathology, and 

which we documented in all the cases of Ille except of the context 727 (bad preservation  

status) is the presence of reactive alveolar bone around the teeth (alveolar resorption). 

An immediate consequence after this loss of alveolar bone caused by the expansion of 

the infection is the exposure of the dental roots, which is the third indicator that we

67 
 

should consider for determine the presence of the periodontal disease, and which again 

we registered in all the individuals of our study. Other possible consequences of the 

spread of the infection can be the appearance of periodontal abscess (which we couldn´t 

identify in any case of Ille assemblage), or the affection of the periodontal ligament and 

the subsequent teeth loss (ORTNER, 2003, pp.594, HILLSON, 1996, pp.262). We can 

observe an example of all this features in Plate 4.1. 

The periodontal disease is the main paleopathology which could be observed in the case 

of the teeth collection of Ille Cave, which was registered in 6 of the 8 individuals. 

Because of preservation factors already discussed (Chapter 4.2 introduction) was not 

documented in the rest of individuals analyzed, and also was not clearly present in the 

case of context 1825, but the presence in this individual of a case of root exposure could 

point to another possible case of periodontitis. Also, one of this 6 individuals which 

gave positive results to periodontal disease, the one from the context 727, doesn´t show 

signs of alveolar resorption, but other markers of the pathology are present (root 

exposure and significate calculus), so we can explain the absence of the third 

diagnostical factor as consequence of the preservation status, which led to a poor 

conservation status of the alveolar surfaces (concretions in both maxilla and mandible). 

 

PLATE 4.1. Sample picture displaying the right mandibular molars from context 2247, in which we 

can observe calculus deposits (green arrows), root exposure (gingival margin before its recession 

marked in red) and the reactive alveolar bone around the dental insertions (between the yellow 

arrows).

? 4.3.2. Carious lesions. 

Caries is defined as “a disease process characterized by the progressive decalcification 

of the enamel or dentine” (WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.455), which 

normally is the result of the accumulation of dental plaque in the mouth and a diet 

which includes fermentable carbohydrates. The dental plaque will be the matrix in 

which a community of acid-producing bacteria (mainly streptococcus mutans associated 

with other secondary contributor bacteria) will inhabit, so the infection will start in the 

tooth surface, expanding latter into the tooth structure, in both crown and root (this last 

one in cases of root exposure), and demineralizing the enamel and lately the dentin, 

destroying both the hard and soft tissues (ORTNER, 2003, pp.590; HILLSON, 1996, 

pp.270; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.171-172). 

Macroscopically, the caries can be noticed in several formats: can appear as smooth 

opaque spots in the crown of the teeth, but also, in more advances status, as cavities or 

pits of variable size which can affect the teeth surfaces in various aspects (normally in 

the fissures of the crowns in the occlusal aspect of the teeth, but is also frequent that 

they appear between the teeth, in the interproximal areas).  

In the case of Ille Cave, two cases where registered (context 755, possible masculine, 

young adult; and context 2247, clearly male, young-middle adult) which correspond to 

different status in this process: the individual from the context 755 presented some 

small black pits in the occlusal aspect of the second and third molars of both left and 

right sides of the mandible, in which the destructive process just affected the enamel; 

meanwhile, in the case of individual 2247, the caries were registered in the left first 

molar from the mandible, in the interproximal surface with the second molar, and also 

in the buccal-labial aspects of both M2 and M3 in the same side. In this second case, the 

caries lesion appeared with a more advanced aspect: deep black-colored cavities which 

extended all over the surfaces of the three molars, with a complete destruction of the 

enamel but also of almost all the dentine, giving the teeth the appearance of being 

almost emptied.  

The Plate 4.2 displays both cases, so than the different status can be observed.

PLATE 4.2. Carious lesions (pointed with green arrows) observed in the mandibular molars of the 

individual from context 755 (left images) and the right mandibular molars of the skeleton from 

2247 (right images).  

Normally, as secondary effects of the appearance of dental caries and their development 

to advanced states, the spread of the infection inside the pulp cavity results in the 

massive destruction of tissue in the base of the tooth root (ORTNER, 2003, pp.593), and 

also the creation of pus which would drain through the alveolar process by the creation 

of an abscess (although, in the case of Ille Cave, no abscess where registered in the 

studied assemblage, neither associated to the caries presence nor to any other 

pathological conditions). 

? 4.3.3. Ante mortem teeth loss (AMTL). 

Some teeth can be missing during the life of the individuals who suffer different 

pathological conditions (for example, periodontal disease). In this case, the loss of 

alveolar bone due to periodontitis, along with the periodontal ligament, which 

undermines the support structure for the dental pieces (ORTNER, 2003, pp.592-593), 

can finish with ante mortem teeth loss (AMTL). So then, there are several different 

reasons for the manifestation of AMTL (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.193): 

presence of caries, accidental removal, intentional removal or tooth wear associated to 

exposition of the pulp.

In the case of Ille Cave, one case of AMTL with alveolar resorption was recorded in the 

third right molar of the maxilla of the individual from context 1337 (Plate 4.3), a young 

adult probable female individual. The surface of the alveolar bone clearly suffered a 

remodeling process, what discards the intentional removal of the tooth. Possibly the 

tooth finished falling because of the infectious process documented in the rest of the 

mouth: this individual also presented signs of alveolar infection in both mandible and 

maxilla, as well as teeth root exposure and the most significant deposits of calculus of 

all the collection, present in all the dental pieces both in lingual and labial aspects. 

 

PLATE 4.3. Ante mortem tooth loss (AMTL) in the space left by the right third molar of the 

maxilla, part of the skeleton from context 1337 of Ille Cave. Can be observed that the remodeling 

process has been partially completed. 

? 4.3.4. Dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH/LEH). 

An interesting case of abnormal quality of teeth is also typically documented in 

Southeast Asian ancient populations (Chapter 5), and the case of Ille is also a good 

example: the dental enamel hypoplasia, which is manifested by the presence of 

horizontal linear grooves in the surfaces of the teeth, together with a fine porosity all 

over the enamel (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.193-194; ORTNER, 2003, 

pp.594-595; WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.455-456). The explanation to this 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

71 
 

presence of these hypoplastic lines, which is particularly more evident in the maxillary 

incisives (but which are specially easy to identify in both mandibular and maxillary 

incisives and canines, as in the case of Ille Cave), is an indicator of the interruption of 

enamel formation (or amelogenesis) during the teeth formation processes in childhood.  

Different factors of stress can stimulate this interruption in the formation of the enamel, 

always manifested by the individual before the timing for the formation of the dental 

crowns of the permanent dentition (around 6 years old), and the study of the different 

sequences of the lines can give us clues about the age in which the individual suffered 

this stress periods: trauma, infections, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, etc (ORTNER, 

2003, pp.595). 

In the case of Ille Cave, DEH was registered in 5 of the 8 individuals which allowed 

dental analysis (in the other 3 individuals which presented postaxial pathologies, the 

mouth and the dental pieces where not preserved): individuals from the context 67, 727, 

755, 1337 and 2247. As we can see in the Chart 4.8, the presence of these defects in the 

tooth enamel were always recorded in the frontal area (mandible and maxilla, always 

incisives and canines), except in the case of the context 67, in which also both 

mandibular first premolars where affected.   

Plate 4.4 offers a good example of this condition documented in one of Ille Cave 

individuals. 

? 4.3.5. Teeth wear: attrition and abrasion.  

Among all the individuals in whom dental study was carried on, can be observed that all 

of them presented really similar wear patterns. The consequences of the attrition process 

(natural teeth wear caused by the continuous contact and friction between the teeth 

during the masticatory process and the chemical affection of them caused the mixture of 

the food residues with the saliva and mouth mucosa) in Ille Cave prehistoric population 

showed exposition of the dentine in almost all the teeth. For understanding better the 

possible groups of individuals associated to the different stages of occlusal wear, was 

committed an study based in a reference scoring system (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER, 

1994, pp.52-53), which results follow in Chart 4.9.

PLATE 4.4. A good example of the dental enamel hypoplasia in Ille Cave is the one presented in 

these images of the mandibular teeth of the individual from context 67. We can observe the DEH 

typical linear grooves marked with black arrows. A) LC, B) LPM1, C) RC, D) RPM1. 

The teeth assemblage studied presents normally and advanced status of teeth wear: half 

part of the cases present large dentine areas with a surrounding enamel ring in the 

frontal teeth (including premolars) occlusal surfaces, even some times giving the teeth a 

“shovel” aspect; meanwhile, more than a quarter part of the surfaces of each molar 

quadrants exhibit dentine in isolated islands, even in concave shapes, although the 

occlusal surface is still surrounded by an enamel ring. Plate 4.5 shows examples of all 

the different status of wear documented in Ille. 

If taken in account that the individual from context 727 presents a case of unusual wear 

pattern (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.205) related to a specific non-

masticatory habit in the molars (Chapter 5), could perfectly fit in this group wear 

patterns. Also, two unusual wear patterns were documented in the frontal mandibular 

teeth of the individuals from contexts 755 and 2247, which we will explain in the 

discussion of Chapter 5.  



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

74 
 

The first of the unusual wear pattern (Plate 4.6) was documented in the frontal teeth 

(incisives and canines) of the mandible of two of the individuals (context 755 and 

2247): all the referred dental pieces showed a pattern of wear in oblique sense, in 

lingual-labial direction, giving the surface of the enamel a smooth aspect which 

followed a rounded shape (not flat, like in cases of advanced states of attrition or 

malocclusion). 

In the case of the skeleton from context 2247, other interesting markers where registered 

during the microscopical analysis (Plate 4.7): 

- Longitudinal microrotures of the enamel of an incisor (RI2), in a vertical sense 

of the lingual surface. 

- Microscopical grooving pattern over the occlusal surface of the incisors 

(particularly in LI1 and LI2), all of them linear and in vertical direction. 

These markers confirm the presence of a constant strength supported by the frontal 

teeth, strength which would follow a lingual-labial direction, with a vertical component 

which would go from up to down (which would explain both the direction of the 

grooves and the vertical disposition of the shelling in RI2). 

The second unusual wear pattern which we registered in the Ille Cave osteological 

assemblage was the one of the mandibular molars of context 727 (middle adult 

individual, probable female). While the rest of the teeth of this individual shows normal 

patterns of erosion caused by attrition (occlusal surfaces), the molars of both sides of the 

mandible showed a concave wear pattern in lingual-buccal direction: scoped dentine, 

weared to almost a short of chisel shape, as can be appreciated in Plate 4.8. This 

particular form of erosion, together with the fact that both third molars where 

completely flat-weared to the roots (what is kind of strange if we take in account the 

fact than the third molar is the last one in erupt: then, why is more weared than M1 and 

M2?), as well as that the damages over the enamel and dentine presented a more 

advanced status in the right side of the mouth (asymmetrical), allowed us to discount 

any natural reasons (attrition, malocclusion) or parafunctional habit (like the 

bruxism/teeth grinding), so this particular case could point to the use of the molar region 

in some kind of cultural habit or activity, as will be analyzed in Chapter 5.

4.4. NON-DENTAL PATHOLOGY. 

Speaking about non-dental pathologies, again 8 of the 11 cases in which we registered 

signs of disease presented this variety, which corresponds to several types of illness 

(healed trauma, degenerative joint disease, infections and metabolic disease): the 

individuals from the contexts 484, 703, 727, 755, 800, 1825, 2240 and 2247. 

Also in a similar way to the exposed for the dental pathologies (vide supra: 4.3), the 

problematic of the non-definite sex and age diagnosis of some individuals won´t allow

us to refer any comparative study about the presence of these pathologies by gender, nor 

age. In any case, the corresponding statistical chart of pathological conditions 

distributed by sex follows (Chart 4.10). 

 

? 4.4.1. Metabolic diseases. Cribra orbitalia. 

In the case of the skeleton coming from the context 800 (young adult, probable female), 

we could notice an area of porosity associated with a process of bone remodeling in the 

roof of its right ocular orbit (unfortunately the left one is missing, so we couldn´t 

determine if it would appear in both sides). After discarding the fact that the porosity 

could be result of postdepositional factors, and since in this case the reactive bone 

process confirmed the pathological condition, a case of cribra orbitalia could be 

diagnosed, pathology normally present in the archaeological skeletal register of ancient 

populations, really interesting from the perspective of the dietary studies: the affection 

of the bone in the orbit roofs is normally the result of the hyperplasia of the diploë, the 

spongy bone structure between the compact bone surfaces of the flat bones present in 

the orbits (WALKER et al., 2009, pp.109; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.546). 

The presence of cribra orbitalia is often diagnosed through several markers which tend 

to characterize it (NAVEED et al., 2012, pp.394): the reduction of the cortical bone 

density in the orbital roof, an increased granularity in the medullary layer of the bone 

surface, a representative thickening of the orbital roof in several cases (especially in 

advanced states of the condition) and an increase in the middle table of bone (possibly 

to approach trough X-Ray tests) are the four characteristics which use to be present.

Several states had been identified in the progress of this pathology (NAVEED et al., 

2012, pp.395), as shown in Plate 4.9: 

- Grade 0: normal bone surface. 

- Grade 1: capillary-like impressions in the bone surface. 

- Grade 2: scattered fine foramina in the bone surface. 

- Grade 3: large and small isolated foramina in the bone surface. 

- Grade 4: foramina with trabecular involvement phase of remodeling (typical in 

adult individuals, since the pathology is more evident in subadults). 

- Grades 5-6: presence of partial destruction of the roof of the orbit.

In the case of context 800 (Plate 4.10), we could observe remodeling in the several 

foramina present in the roof of the orbit, so we could determine a Grade 4, what is 

logical following the previous pattern if we take in account that the individual is a 

young adult: the disease affected the individual during early vital phases, but the arrival 

to adulthood and a possible access to a better diet, together with a stronger organism, 

made easier the healing process.

from Ille Cave.  

? 4.4.2. Degenerative joint diseases. Osteoarthritis and Schmorl´s nodes. 

Several degenerative conditions which affected the joints of some individuals where 

documented during the laboratorial analysis of the assemblage. 

The first of these conditions was spinal osteoarthritis. This pathology is associated with 

the presence physical stress in the area (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.340-

341), which variates in every point of the spine (since it´s curved, not completely 

vertical), so that the variation of frequency of the pathology does as well. 

Three main components are normally present in the development of osteoarthritis, 

which presence allowed the determination of the pathology in the studied assemblage 

(ORTNER, 2011, pp.546): first, the breakdown of the articular cartilage, which would 

lead to the contact and abrasion between bone surfaces; second, the formation of 

reactive bone, mainly in the subchondral compact and trabecular bone; and third, the 

consequent growth of new cartilage and bone in the margins of the joint. 

As the result of this process, three markers can be generally observed in the bones 

affected by this condition: marginal lipping, as the result of the new bone formation 

(example in Plate 4.11); eburnated surfaces, as the result of the contact and abrasion 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

between bone surfaces after the cartilage loss; and osteophytes and bonny plaques 

(example in Plate 4.12), also a result of the creation of new tissue (ORTNER, 2011, 

pp.546; AUFDERHEIDE, RODRÍGUEZ-MARTÍN, 1998, pp.96). These characteristics 

where documented in two individuals of the assemblage studies: the ones from contexts 

727 (middle adult, probable female) and 2247 (male young-middle adult), as illustrated 

in Chart 4.11. Unfortunately, no signs of eburnation where documented in any case, but 

this fact was attributed to the poor preservation status of the column in both individuals.

an osteophyte near to its posterior edge. 

The second joint disease marker which was noticed in the vertebral column of the 

studied assemblage was the presence of Schmorl´s nodes (Plate 4.13), in this case in the 

last lumbar (L8-12) vertebrae and the first thoracic vertebra of the individual from 

context 484 (an adult of indeterminate sex), and again in all the five lumbar vertebrae of 

the individual from context 2247 (which had also signs of osteoarthritis, as already 

discussed). This kind of nodes, which appear as concavities in the superior and/or 

inferior surfaces of the vertebral bodies, normally rounded or oval-shaped, are symptom 

of an hernia: the inflammation of the intervertebral bodies makes the cartilage to expand 

inside the adjacent vertebral bodies, causing the depressions observed 

(AUFDERHEIDE, RODRÍGUEZ-MARTÍN, 1998, pp.96-97; PENG et al., 2003, 

pp.879).

assemblage (please, refer to Annex III), again in the vertebrae (cases of marginal lipping 

in cervical vertebrae of the individuals from contexts 755 and 2240), but also in other 

anatomical regions: the left elbow of the individual from context 2240 (guiding ridge of 

the ulna), and also the shoulder joint (clavicle and scapulae) of the individual from 

context 2247.

? 4.4.3. Infectious diseases. Osteomyelitis, periostitis and osteitis. 

Three different varieties of infectious diseases were also registered in the study phase of 

the selected assemblage of prehistoric individuals from Ille: 

- Context 703 (adult of indeterminate sex): osteomyelitis in forearms (ulna and 

radius) and legs (tibia and fibula). 

- Context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult): periostitis in legs and arms; also, 

osteitis in pubis and sacroiliac joint. 

The osteomyelitis is an infectious disease which normally starts with the introduction of 

pyogenic bacteria in the bone tissue, normally staphylococcus aureus, although other 

agents (virus, fungus, parasite) can also cause the genesis of this condition (BAPTISTA, 

TARDIVO, 2012, pp.6; ORTNER, 2011, pp.181; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, 

pp.408-409). If the infection spreads through the cortex and/or the periosteum, the case 

would be recognized as secondary osteomyelitis; meanwhile, once the infection affects 

the medullary cavity, the pathology would manifest in its strongest modality.  

The creation of pus inside the medullary cavity makes the diaphysis of the bone support 

and stress, which naturally results in the creation of round-shaped openings in its 

surface (cloacae or fistulae), which would allow the drainage of it to the exterior 

(ORTNER, 2011, pp.182-184; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.318). Also, the pus can 

produce the elevation of the periosteum of the bone, and as well the creation of new 

bone surrounding the original bone cortex: the involucrum or sequestrum (ORTNER, 

2011, pp.182-186; WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.318), which would give the bone a 

deformed shape. 

The individual recovered in the context 703 of Ille Cave, an adult which sex could not 

be determined, clearly showed this pathological condition (Plate 4.14), since both 

cloacae and involucrum could be noticed in both forearms (ulna x2 and radius x1) and 

down legs (tibia x2 and fibula x1).  

The next pathological condition documented was the periostitis, although is important 

to explain here that it´s not considered as a disease by itself (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, 

pp.318): periostitis is a term normally used to define the inflammatory process of the 

periosteum of the bone (normally long bones), and which can be a consequence of 

multiple factors (both traumatic or infectious).  



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

86 
 

The origin of the periostitis comes normally from the formation of microtraumatisms 

wich appear in the periostium of the long bones in the legs, caused by locomotor intense 

activities (for example, intense running: the vibrations caused for the constant impact of 

the limbs in the floor can be one factor wich could cause the microrotures). This 

microrotures will be the focus from where the infection will expand a posteriori. As a 

consequence of this, the periosteum supports the surface formation of new lamellar 

bone, normally following an organized striated pattern in parallel lines (ORTNER, 

2011, pp.206-207; ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417-418): this pattern allows 

the differential diagnosis, like happened in the only case registered in Ille Cave, the 

individual from context 2247 (a male young-middle adult), as can be noticed in Plate 

4.15. Is interesting that the distribution of this new bone formations affects specially to 

the inferior limbs of the individual, and even more in the case of the tibia, another 

evidence for the diagnosis, since normally this kind of infectious disease manifest 

stronger in the tibial diaphysis (ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417). 

But, overall this conditions, the same individual also presented a case of pubic osteitis, 

the third infectious manifestation registered in the assemblage. While the terms 

osteomyelitis or periostitis offer more defined descriptions for particular conditions, the 

term osteitis has worked in the bibliography as a more general term for the 

“inflammation of bone tissue caused by infection or injury and which is not specific as 

to cause” (as in WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.317). 

The pubic osteitis is frequent in sportive people, especially in cases of people which 

make a lot of exercise with the down limbs (MAJOR, HELMS, 1997, pp.711-712; 

GABARRÓ et al., 2008, pp.346), what would fit well with the case of periostitis 

determined for individual from context 2247. Normally the intense changes of rhythm 

during the locomotion, such as abrupt accelerations or decelerations, climbing activities 

or kick movements, are the detonation facts for the spread of the infection (MAJOR, 

HELMS, 1997, pp.712; GABARRÓ et al., 2008, pp.346). This high intensity of the 

activity makes the pubic area suffer quite big stress situations (Plate 4.16): the strong 

abdominal efforts can create micro-traumatisms, which would be the focus of the 

immediate infection, being pseudomonas aeuriginosa the most recurrent bacteria 

(GABARRÓ et al., 2008, pp.346).

In advances states of the pubic osteitis, the loss over the pubic symphysis outline is 

quite evident, like in this case of study from Ille Cave, and also the symptoms can 

extend to the sacroiliac joint (GABARRÓ et al., 2008, pp.347; MAJOR, HELMS, 1997, 

pp.712-717): in the same case could be noticed reactive bone and marginal lipping in 

both sides of the articulations of the pelvic griddle with the sacrum. 

  

PLATE 4.16. Detailed pictures of the pubic symphisis of the individual from the context 2247, in 

wich we can observe the degeneration of the bone surface and the complementary growth of new 

bone.  

? 4.4.4. Trauma. Ante mortem fractures. 

Beneath all the individuals registered in Ille Cave which presented pathological 

conditions, also three different cases of trauma where registered: 

- Context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult): lateral healed fracture of the 

right nasal bone. 

- Context 1825 (young adult, indeterminate sex): healed oblique fracture of the 

left femur. 

- Context 484 (adult, indeterminate sex): healed traumatism in the thorax with 

costovertebral involvement (right side). 

About the case of the nasal fracture in the individual recovered from the context 2247 of 

Ille Cave (Plate 4.17), the differential diagnosis was committed (for distinguish it from 

possible morphological anomalies) attending to different aspects normally used in this 

cases (as in LESSA, MENDOÇA DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.134): “formation of new bone, 

absence of bone, bone resorption, interruptions or breaks in anatomical structures, 

cortical healing indicated by high-density areas, active resorption indicated by porotic 

areas associated with bone loss, and fissures and depressions that might indicate 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

90 
 

morphological change associated with trauma”. In this sense, the fact that the individual 

from Ille presented some of these aspects would point to a clear case of nasal 

traumatism: 

- The presence of fracture lines and dislocation: easy to notice in the surface of the 

nasal bones, since no callus covered them (except possibly in the superior limit 

between both nasal bones). We could notice that the right nasal bone suffered a 

horizontal fracture, possibly as a product of a lateral impact, and that the inferior 

part of it also suffered a dislocation. 

- The fact that the fracture lines healed in a misaligned position: the dislocated 

fragment healed in a misaligned position, as we can observe in the presence of 

empty spaces (inferior part of the connection between the fragment and the 

maxilla) and the irregular surface of connection between both nasals. This 

unaligned healing is frequent in this cases of nasal fracture, in which “the 

fragments can rarely be reduced to the original position or stabilized, thus 

resulting in badly aligned healing, with aesthetic and functional consequences” 

(LESSA, MENDOÇA DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.134). 

- Possible absence of bony microfragments in the areas described, which could be 

consequence of the reabsorption or expulsion of them by the organism. 

- The septum seemed deviated, although this could be a consequence of 

postdepositional process. 

The second case of traumatism that which was documented in Ille assemblage was the 

healed oblique femoral shaft fracture in the left down limb of the individual from 

context 1825 (WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.434; ROBERTS, 

MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.226-227). The healed fracture was registered on the 

midshaft of the bone, as can be observed in Plate 4.18, but we couldn´t determine the 

presence of any callus, what together with the formation of lamellar/woven bone, which 

was already being replaced in some areas with trabecular bone, make thought that the 

process of fracture repair was in the an advanced phase, the remodeling stage 

(ROBERTS, MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.232-234).

PLATE 4.17. Right nasal fracture of the individual from context 2247 from Ille Cave. We can 

notice in the images the misaligned healed fracture lines, and also de deviation of the septum. 

Also, a modern fracture, possible result of the excavation process, crossed perpendicular 

to the healed fracture, that allowed to confirm again that the fracture was oblique and 

that it didn’t repair in its original aligned position, but in a lateral superposition between 

both broken ends (both medullary cavities appear in a parallel position in the visible 

cross section), possibly as a result of the muscular spams following the stress, which 

would have pulled the broken end past each other (WEBB, 1995, pp.196).  

The X-Ray analysis allowed proving the overlapping between both femoral fragments, 

which carried the posterior misaligned fracture (Plate 4.18).

PLATE 4.18. Anterior (left picture) and posterior (right) views of the left femur of the individual, 

in which we can appreciate the healed oblique fracture in the medial diaphysis, which was repaired 

in a misaligned position. In the X-Ray vision (anterior), the overlapping of fragments seems more 

visible (marked with white arrows). 

Finally, the individual retrieved from context 484 presented a case of costovertebral 

trauma, which implied the dislocation of the ribs of the right side of the thorax (from 2
nd

 

to 8
th

), and which started a healing process without being reinserted in their original 

position, as can be appreciated in Plate 4.19. Since the rest of the thorax is not 

preserved, but the scapula from the same side doesn´t present any sign of pathological 

condition (what could point to a vertical direction of the strength which caused the 

trauma), could be the result of  a big strength projected over the back of the individual, 

which dislocated the ribs (some examples of possible causes would be: fall back from a 

considerable height, or over a hard surface, the impact of a heavy object falling over the 

back of the individual, etc).

93 
 

The individual survived, at least, enough time for the ossification process to start (Plate 

4.20): even if the ribs where not fused, the bone reacted creating new cortical surfaces, 

which adapted their shape to the spaces left between the contiguous ribs and other 

organs. Possibly, the infectious signs observed over the vertebrae, and which are 

especially visible in the right side (same side in which the trauma is present), are a 

direct consequence of the trauma.

? 4.4.5. Activity related stress markers. 

In the case of the individual recovered in context 2247 (masculine young-middle adult), 

also some interesting signs of occupational stress markers where registered in the 

shoulder articulation bones: new bone was growing in both scapulae, in the acromion 

process of both bone (Plate 4.21); but new bone was specially evident in both clavicles, 

over the ligament insertion areas (conoid and costoclavicular ligaments), and also 

arround the attachment of the deloid muscle (as shown in Plate 4.22). 

The literature (LAI, LOVELL, 1992, pp.224-226) refers to this cases as markers of 

ocupational stress asociated with labours wich imply the reiterative movement of the 

shouders, such as the ones asociated with the typical circular movement in rowers, or in 

activities sich as carring, lifting and padding. (in the case of Ille Cave, since the sea is 

not inmediate to the site, we can point to these other activities). The hypertrophy of 

these muscles requires a compensation from the bone, wich creates this new bone 

arround the inserction areas for developeing a stronger conection with the muscle.

5. INTERPRETING THE DATA 
COLLECTED: FINAL DISCUSSION AND 

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES. 

 
 

5.1. INTERPRETATION AND CONTEXT OF ILLE CAVE PATHOLOGIES IN 

A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN BIOARCHAEOLOGY. 

This chapter will focus on developing explanations referred to the pathologies registered 

in Ille Cave prehistoric population, already presented in Chapter 4 as the results of the 

analysis. The establishment of interpretative models will be presented for some 

particular pathologies which would require a deeper explanation that the ones referred 

previously, since in Chapter 4 just descriptive approach was accomplished. Some of 

these cases are the unusual teeth wear patterns registered in the assemblage (section 

5.2.4), which were studied in order to understand their causes, with positive results: 

some interesting notes about the activities developed by these prehistoric societies could 

be inferred from them. Also, other diseases such as the healed traumatisms present in 

the assemblage (section 5.1.8) would lead the reader trough ideas about the accidental 

origins of the paleopathologies in Ille Cave, and also to understand some questions 

relative to the perception of the pathological conditions among the people who 

inhabited the site during Prehistoric times, about some ideas relative to first aids or 

health care. 

In every case, also a comparative analysis with other sites inside the Southeast Asia-

Pacific region will be committed, in order to offer the reader a basic idea about the 

current status of the investigations and the knowledge we have about each group of 

pathologies in the area, what also would help us to understand different dynamics 

related to the paleopathologies and the indicators of health care through all these 

extended area, in which different social models and ambiental responses will be noticed. 

Finally, after all this perspectival approaches to the pathologies registered, the work will 

be closed with a final discussion about the health care perspective and the social and 

environmental implications about it in Ille Cave, crossing the osteological data collected 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

with other aspects already studied in the site, such as the ambience (flora and fauna), 

landscape or some dietary ideas (section 5.4). A critical approach to the present work 

will be also provided, in the shape of a final section (section 5.5) which will offer some 

tasks which were not developed and which could be included as future perspectives or 

ideas for future studies. 

5.2. DENTAL PATHOLOGY. 

? 5.2.1. Dental calculus and signs of buccal infection. 

As may be observed in Chapter 4.3.1, the presence of calculus in the teeth of Ille Cave 

individuals is present in all the studied cases, what is really normal in other prehistoric 

places of Southeast Asia for similar chronologies. A good example is the case of Non 

Nok Tha, a good representative of the Neolithic and the Metal Ages (till the 

preangkorian Iron Age) of Thailand. This site, which we can recognize as an important 

cemetery area (just a few industrial and occupational episodes in all the stratigraphy, 

which offers a complete sequence from around 5000/4500 years BP to around 1800 

BP), is a good example of the high rates of frequency of registered calculus in adults 

(TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.203-204). This possibly would be related to some 

kind of factors which would create an alkaline ambience in the mouth which would 

make the dental plaque to appear easily or maybe to a poorer oral hygiene. In any Non 

Nok Tha seems an interesting case, since the masculine individuals present calculus 

much more frequently than the females, although the explanation to this phenomenon is 

not conclusive (in the case of Ille, the distribution doesn´t seem to response to gender 

reasons, affecting to all the cases without any distinction).  

If the advanced calculus is present in more than half part of the individuals of Non Nok 

Tha, the alveolar resorption is present in almost the third part of the population 

(TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.214), while in Ille Cave appears in almost every 

case. This doesn´t mean in any case that Ille Cave shows a higher rate of frequency in 

periodontal disease that the ones from the series of Non Not Tha: we need to insist 

again in the fact that our skeletal remains are quite worst preserved, and also in the fact 

that our statistical analysis can´t be achieved, since we made it just over 20 individuals 

(not enough for this kind of studies), so the representativeness of the individuals 

analyzed inside of the collection is still a big question to be solved with the study of

other chronologies inside of the site and the recovery of other prehistoric human 

remains still buried. 

Some factors, that we will analyze latter for the case of the caries (vid infra: 4.2.2), can 

be great enhancers for the presence of calculus in the dental pieces. The chewing of 

betel nut and some dietary components (such as the water hardness or the presence of 

silicon contents, present in rice or beer, for example) could explain the high profusion 

of the condition in Ille populations (TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.214). As we will 

see in the next section of this chapter, the rice agriculture can´t explain the particular 

case of Ille Cave (hasn´t been documented), but for example the betel nut has been 

registered in several ways (MEDRANA, 2002, pp.44; CARLOS, 2010, pp.19). 

? 5.2.2. Dental caries. 

Is interesting to notice that several studies (ORTNER, 2003, pp.591; TOOMAY 

DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.191) have concluded that carious process are more typically 

associated to agriculturalist societies, in which their frequency of appearing is much 

higher than in the case of hunters-gatherers, as the result of the presence of more 

fermentable carbohydrates associated to the consumption of different species of plants.  

Although, is important to introduce here an interesting idea that affects to Southeast 

Asia populations: the fact that the grasses and grains of rice, typically consumed by 

these populations, are not as cariogenic as other plants consumed by other agriculturalist 

societies around the world (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.192). As a result of this 

fact, is true that normally the presence of caries manifest in a smaller amount in the 

osteological register from archaeological sites in this areas: proportionally, less 

individuals present this condition in Southeast Asia sites. Some good examples in this 

sense are the few cases registered in the permanent dentition of Neolithic-Iron Age sites 

as Non Nok Tak in Thailand (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.203), which offers a 

long chronology between 5000/4500 and 1800 BP, and where we can also observe the 

fact than the carious process are more frequent in the mandibular molars that in other 

parts of the mouth (actually in Ille Cave both the cases documented also appear in 

mandibular molars) and in the occlusal or interproximal surfaces of the teeth, as we 

referred before. In Ille Cave, as introduced in Chapter 4.3.2, we have one case of each 

of these situations (occlusal and interproximal), so the pattern seems comparable. Also 

in the Bronze Age site of Ban Lum Khao or the pre-angkorian Iron Age site of Noen U-

Loke (DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006a, pp.230; TAYLES, DOMETT, NELSEN, 2000, 

pp.71-72), both in the Thai valley of the Nun River, we can observe again that the total 

proportion of carious lesions was really similar between samples, always in this low 

ranges exposed for other sites: 4.5% of the osteological assemblage from Ban Lum 

Khao and 4.8% for the case of Noen U-Loke.                        

Even if these three cases serve as a good example, the low rates for carious lesions are 

generalized for all Southeast Asia, as the extended bibliography written about these 

explanations states. For example, multi-regional studies such as the ones carried out by 

Mark Oxenham, who can give a good perspective about the very low frequencies of 

carious lesions in the pre-agricultural (c.5000 BP) and rice-based agricultural (c.2500-

1700 BP) period of Northern Vietnam, with ratios of frequency for carious lesions 

between 1.5% and 10.9%  in all the collections of these area, insisting again in the rice-

based diet explanation, and in which enumerates a long list of up to 12 sites which also 

show a bigger frequency of carious lesions in the posterior mandibular teeth 

(OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, KIM THUY, 2006, pp.274). 

The problem that we have with the previous interpretation is the fact that rice 

agriculture has not yet been identified in the archaeological record of Ille Cave. 

Therefore, this generalized model for other regions can´t be applied to the particular 

case of Ille. Maybe the low rate of carious lesions in Ille (present just in two of the eight 

cases of individuals which conserved dental pieces) could be explained as a result of the 

small sample size of human remains or the preservation status. Maybe trough other 

factors which speak about dental care and hygiene, such as the consumption of betel nut 

(areca catechu), which has been documented in the paleobotanical record (CARLOS, 

2010, pp.19), but could also be indirectly inferred from the unusual teeth wear pattern of 

one of the individuals in our study (section 4.2.5) and other previous studies of the 

dentition in Ille (MEDRANA, 2002, pp.44). The consumption of betel nut is quite 

frequent in ancient Asian populations and especially documented in the case of the 

Philippine archipelago, both through the archaeology (OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, 

KIM THUY, 2006, pp.264) and the ethnographical records of the precolonial era 

(HENRY SCOTT, 1994, pp.49). The chewing of betel nut has been associated in the 

literature with cariostatic properties (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.216), as the 

addition of lime to the chew results in an alkaline environment in the mouth which

difficult the presence of carious bacteria (but contributes to the appearance of calculus, 

for example).  

Would be necessary to introduce here also the case of the early metallurgic site of Man 

Bac, in Vietnam North-East coast (OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, 

pp.87-88), the site in all Southeast Asia with a higher rate of representation of carious 

lesions between the populations: 11%, lightly superior than the 10.9% of the close site 

of Khok Phanom Di. While in Khok Phanom Di the high rate has been explained 

through the consumption of some cariogenic foods, such as the taro, the banana or the 

yam; the case of Man Bac remains a mystery. The introduction of rice in the diet of Man 

Bac has been long documented, and their diet included more than 50% of seafood and 

fish, but no cariogenic food has been registered in their diet furthermore. Is important to 

introduce here this case as an example of how much variables out of the topics exposed 

here can be present in this kind of studies. 

Is also interesting to mention here an study (OXENHAM, LAN CIJONG, KIM THUY, 

2006, pp.273) which have allowed to determine that the presence of carious lesions is 

more frequent between female individuals than in males for the case of Southeast Asian 

populations, possibly not because of biological reasons (for example, the different 

rhythm in teeth exposure), but in relation to different cultural behaviors within the 

population: diversifications of activities by gender (women would be more linked to 

agricultural labors, while the males would maintain the hunter activities), or the 

differences of diet as a result of these labor links, since they would eat more 

carbohydrates (they are more close to the products proceeding from the agriculture) and 

the males more proteins (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.192). In this sense, the 

Vietnamese sites of Man Bac and Da But are again a good example, since gender-

related studies where committed (OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, 

pp.87). Unfortunately in the case of Ille Cave, as stated (section 4.1.2), we can´t stablish 

any gender-related analysis as the assemblage doesn’t present enough cases for a 

statistical analysis, but we can state that both the caries samples that where noticed 

belong to a clear male and a probable male individual.

? 5.2.3. Dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH/LEH). 

As could be appreciated in the previous chapter (Chapter 3.3.4), all the cases of DEH 

detected in Ille Cave appeared in the frontal teeth (incisives and canines, a case of first 

premolars) of both mandible and maxilla. This prevalence in the frontal teeth is logical 

according to the teeth formation patterns during childhood (giving us information about 

the period between 7-12 years, when this teeth erupt, according to Ubelaker 1989: 

WHITE, BLACK, FOLKENS, 2012, pp.386), and actually is present in the rest of 

Southeast Asia sites which will afford us a comparative study (vide infra), sites which 

also focused their diagnosis process in the frontal dentition. 

As we said, the presence of DEH in our studied assemblage is of 50% of the individuals 

in which we documented pathological conditions, or 62.5% if we attend to the 

individuals in which dental pieces where still present (just 8 cases). This would position 

Ille Cave as a case study of high presence of DEH within its population, comparing to 

other Southeast Asia sites. Definitely not in the line of sites as Man Bac in Vietnam, 

with a 100% of frequency ratio, or the neighbor Da But, with a 72% (OXENHAM, 

MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, pp.90), both cases which we could consider as 

exceptional cases with too high rates. The case of Ille, instead, presents a percentage 

more in the line of the general patterns: 37.1% in Shi San Hang (Taiwan), the Thai sites 

of Ban Chiang (20.8%) or Khok Phanom Di (43.8%), or even the percentage of 32.5% 

registered in the Marianas Islands (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.212).  

These cases point always to a high presence of infant stress, but which we always have 

to understand inside of the parameters of the normality for this ancient societies, even 

when we find other specific cases in the region which point to societies with lower 

infantile stress (Ban Lum Khao, with 12.1%, and Noen U-Loke, with 10.7%, are 

interesting examples in Thailand preangkorian Bronze and Iron ages, especially in cases 

of big demographic index which will sustain the development of the Khmer empire; or 

the prehistoric Hawaii, with just a 7.7% of cases of DEH: PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 

2003, pp.212). 

Is necessary to remember again that the assemblage studied for the case of Ille was quite 

reduced for a representative statistical study, so we have to be cautious with this kind of 

comparisons, which possibly will suffer modifications when more prehistoric sites are 

studied in the Philippines.

All the cited places, in fact, also offered interesting information about the differential 

presence of DEH between both sexes: in all the cases, female individuals presented 

DEH in quite bigger percentages that the ones for male individuals. In every case this 

was explained from a plausible difference in the diet of the female children in 

comparison with their male partners (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003, pp.210; 

OXENHAM, MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, pp.90). Again, Ille can´t be 

introduced in this kind of studies, since just a few individuals sustain the analysis and 

the sexual diagnosis was not confident in many cases. 

? 5.2.4. Non-masticatory tooth wear patterns and their possible cultural-

functional implications. 

As was already introduced in Chapter 4.3.5, several unusual tooth wear patterns where 

noticed in Ille Cave assemblage. The first of it, the one affecting the frontal mandibular 

teeth of the individuals recovered from context 755 and 2247, possibly would response 

to a practice of the use of the mouth as third hand in any kind of activity. 

Several paramasticatory activities have been documented for contemporaneous 

aboriginal human groups, especially in the case of the Eskimos/Inuit and the Australian 

aborigines. The same marks that the ones observed in our two individuals are related in 

these groups to activities which imply the use of the mouth as third hand, and the action 

of pulling outward and downward with both hands over the object which they hold with 

the frontal teeth (normally related to the treatment of animal skins for the manufacture 

of leathers, as can be observed in Plate 5.1). This non-masticatory pulling and stripping 

activities produce a “relative severe and often rounded wear” on incisors and canines” 

(HINTON, 1981, pp.556) of both Eskimos and Australian tribal groups, following 

exactly the same pattern that the one documented for the individuals from the contexts 

755 and 2247 of Ille Cave (Chapter 4.3.5). The Inuit case is quite evident, since women 

still play the practice of softening the skin thought this pulling process, as we can see in 

Plate 5.1, while men perform different labors inside the community, more oriented to 

get the food by hunting (RAYE WOOD, 1992, pp.30). So furthermore we can recognize 

the documentation of the use of the mouth as third hand in pulling and stripping 

activities (possibly leather softening) in our site of study.

PLATE 5.1. Pictures showing two Inuit women performing an activity which implies the use of the 

frontal teeth as third hand: the chewing of animal skins. Below, dentition recovered from a 

prehistoric Eskimo site, in which we can observe the wear pattern left by this kind of activities 

(From: HINTON, 1981). 

Is interesting the fact that has been proved (TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.191) that 

the human groups which follow subsistence regimes typical in hunter-gatherer societies 

(like the ones referred, for example) tend to exhibit this relatively heavy wear in the 

frontal dental pieces of adult individuals as a result of the use of the mouth as third 

hand, especially in the case of the mandibular teeth, with also this tendency to the 

rounded wear pattern (HINTON, 1981, pp.562-563). Meanwhile, groups which 

somehow depend to varied degrees in food production present the molars quite more 

weared that in the hunter-gatherer societies, and the pattern in frontal dentition uses to 

give the pieces a cupper wear appearance, linked to the grinding functions developed in 

the frontal mouth area. This, together with the light presence of the caries and an only 

case of AMTL would point, a priori and always according to this studies, to a hunter-

gatherer economic model for Ille Cave, although the intrinsecal limitations of our study 

(small sample analyzed, not representative enough) and the particularities of the

prehistoric societies of the Philippines have to make us feel cautious about this kind of 

definition (actually is really possible that we can be facing a mix economic model, as 

we will observe in section 5.4). 

The other unusual wear pattern registered in Ille Cave, as displayed before (Chapter 

4.3.5), affected the mandibular molars of the individual retrieved in the context 727. 

Normally, this wear patterns which affect so much the molar area but don´t affect the 

frontal teeth are associated with several activities which involve the deeper dentition 

(MICKLEBURGH, 2007, pp.50-52), such as the following ones: 

- Crashing bones with the molars. 

- Killing fishes with a bite during fishing labors, or cracking crabs or shells. 

- Chewing hard rubbery aliments (for example, seal dry skin in Inuit populations, 

as we can see in the image below). 

- Consumption of hard nuts. 

- Some activities which pretend the creation of industries which require the 

chewing of lianas. 

Among these options, the case of the chew of hard aliments was discarded immediately: 

the diet in Ille Cave didn´t include any rubbery aliment, plus the bibliographical 

research allowed us to confirm that the wear pattern in this cases, although similar to the 

one present in our individual, used to had more repercussion over the mesial and distal 

surfaces of the teeth (in our case the disposition is lingual-buccal), as we can observe in 

Plate 5.2, from the Inuit site of Sadlermiut (RAYE WOOD, 1992, pp.136-138). 

 

PLATE 5.2. Image of the wear pattern shown in the mandibular molars of the individual 61 of the 

archaeological Inuit site of Sadlermiut: similar to the case from context 727 of Ille, but in this case 

explained because the chew of hard-rubbery aliments (From: RAYE WOOD, 1992).

The most probable option for the case of Ille Cave was the chew of nuts, since, as was 

discussed for the case of the carious formations of our assemblage (4.2.2), the chew of 

betel nut (areca catechu) has been documented in Southeast Asian skeletal collections 

in similar patterns than the one been studied here (PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY, 

DOUGLAS, 2011, pp.74), or in other close regions (FITZPATRICK, NELSON, 

REEVES, 2003). But has also been documented in Ille Cave in other previous dental 

analysis (MEDRANA, 2002 pp.44), and also in the paleobotanical studies (CARLOS, 

2010, pp.19), as well as in the ethnographical register of prehispanic Philippines 

(HENRY SCOTT, 1994, pp.49) and other several cases of the region. In fact, some 

authors have even documented the origins on the use of betel nut in the southern 

Philippines (Visayas-Mindanao) and Borneo, with a posterior expansion to the rest of 

Island Southeast Asia and the continental lands (FULLER et al., 2011). 

This practice, quite common not also in prehistoric Asian populations, but even between 

the contemporaneous indigenous people (in almost all the territory: Northern Palawan, 

Visayas, diverse regions of Mindanao and in the Cordillera region of central Luzon) 

uses to follow the same ritual: the preparation before the chewing process would start 

with the cut of the areca palm nut into segments, which was wrapped in a leaf of betel 

piper vine, together with lime made of shells and other possible aromatic or flavoring 

elements (we ourselves could observe the use of tobacco leaves in this sense during our 

stance in the Cordillera region, but the ancient registers speak us also about the use of 

cinnamon sticks in the Visayas, just for give an example: HENRY SCOTT, 1994, 

pp.49), giving as a result of the process the quid which would be chewed. This sequence 

of preparation and the materials used can be observed in Plate 5.3. 

 

PLATE 5.3. Process of the preparation of betel nut (nga-nga) in Philippines: A,B) recovery of the 

areca catechu, C) preparation of raw materials (1: sliced nut without the pulp of the fruit, 2: 

including the pulp, 3: betel leaves or ikmo; 4: mascada or dry chewing tobacco leaves, 5: some lime 

or apog), D) chewing quid (From: author, over HENRY SCOTT, 1994).

The chew of betel nut has several properties which would explain why the Asian 

populations would have introduced it as a habit. The main one is its cariostatic effect 

(TOOMAY, DOUGLAS, 2006, pp.216): the lime helps to develop an alkaline 

environment which prevents the appearance of carious lesions, as we saw before (vid 

supra: 4.2.2). Unfortunately, this alkaline ambience makes easier the appearance of 

calculus deposits over the teeth, dental infections process, etc (vid supra: 4.2.1). 

Apart of the different pathologies which the consumption of betel nut would leave in the 

soft tissues of the mouth and its mucosa (TRIVEDY, CRAIG, 

WARNAKULASURIYA, 2002), also different markers have been observed in the 

dental pieces of archaeological populations thought Asia: the wear pattern of our 

individual would fix quite well inside this patterns, which are always present in the 

molar area (being specially abrasive in the case of the last molar pieces, since the quid is 

chewed in the deeper part of the mouth) and over the buccal-labial surfaces (is chewed 

between the dentition and the cheeks, for avoiding choking, since after the process all 

the remains of the chewed quid are spited out). The only problem we have in our case of 

study is that the remain enamel is not tinted in the typical reddish coloration (Plate 5.4), 

as in other cases of Ille Cave (MEDRANA, 2002 pp.44) or other archaeological 

registers, but could be the result of a strong chemical attrition or postdepositional 

process (actually the exposed pulps are quite orange-colored, but not much enamel is 

present, so we can´t determine clearly the coloration of it). So, furthermore, we can 

conclude a possible, but not definitive, case of non-dietary chewing of betel nut for the 

individual from the context 727. 

Although is true that this betel nut consumption case was registered in a probable 

female individual, and the frontal teeth wear pattern appeared in two males (a definite 

male and a probable one: vid supra), we can´t speak about the division of these labors or 

practices between genders in Ille, since the activity patterns are not representative 

enough (just three cases in a small group of 20 individuals studied). Maybe deeper 

studies in the future could allow us to commit this kind of studies in the prehistoric 

Philippines archipelago.

? 5.3.1. Cribra orbitalia. 

This manifestation has been traditionally associated with hematological imbalances in 

the diet of ancient populations (NAVEED et al., 2012, pp.394): anemias, bone marrow 

malignances, metabolic disturbances). But currently the debate about this question is 

still going: new medical studies suggest that, more than iron-deficiency anemia, the 

probable reason for the presence of this pathological condition would be a lack of 

vitamin B-12 in these populations (WALKER et al., 2009, pp.119). In any case, this 

lack of nutrients can be explained trough different perspectives: a lack of nutrients 

during the pregnancy which would affect the neonatal or cases of malnutrition 

(especially in subadults individuals, since the pathology is specially prominent beneath

the younger age rates) seem reasonable factors to take into account, but also infectious 

diseases (for example diarrheal diseases, normally present in this kind of populations 

because of the unsanitary living conditions and the profusion of parasite loads, and 

which cause significant nutrient loss) or a lack of animal products in the diet (especially 

meaningful in agriculturalist societies in which the ambience doesn´t offer enough 

faunal-origin supplies -for example, cases of overexploitation of animal resources-, or in 

the case of the people with lower social ranks, which can be linked to a worst access to 

this resources in diet) are other possible explanations to the presence of this pathology 

(WALKER et al., 2009, pp.119-120). 

Other studies which have been committed in Southeast Asia (a good example are the 

Vietnamese sites of Man Bac and Da But, previously cited: OXENHAM, 

MATSUMURA, KIM DUNG, 2010, pp.90) also seem to suggest a bigger presence of 

the pathology in feminine individuals, what could be related to a dietary differences, 

possibly as a response of a lack of the described nutrients in the women diet, which 

would be closer to agricultural products, while the men would consume more animal 

products as a consequence of their direct relation with hunting activities. Unfortunately, 

in the case of Ille Cave we just could register a case, so we can commit this kind of 

studies (although is interesting to notice that, in our case, we were facing a probably 

female individual).  

? 5.3.2. Degenerative joint disease. 

In Chapter 4.2.2 the results for the determination of degenerative joint disease where 

already presented: 5 of the 20 individuals (25%) studied presented any variety of this 

condition, distinguishing between: osteoarthritis (individuals 727 and 2247: 2/20), 

Schmorl´s nodules (individuals 484 and 2247: 2/20), minor markers of degeneration in 

the column (individual 755: 1/20) and signs which appeared in other articulations 

outside of the column (the elbow of 2240 and the shoulder of 2247: 2/20). These 

varieties accumulated in the same individual for the cases from context 2240 (with 

minor lipping both in the column and in the elbow) and 2247 (which offered positive 

results for vertebral osteoarthritis and Schmorl´s nodes, plus some minor signs of 

degeneration in the shoulder joint). 

In a general perspective, the presence of degenerative joint disease is almost absolute in 

Southeast Asian skeletal assemblages (DOMETT, O´REILLY, 2009, pp.72), although

not so many studies focused their attention in these pathological variety (the literature 

seems to be much more prolific in dental health and skeletal trauma). Study cases as the 

ones committed over several central Thailand sites of the Metal Period (LIU, 2012, 

pp.374-375 - Several sites; DOMETT, O´REILLY, 2009, pp.72 - Phum Snay) shown 

that, between other several factors (age, genetics, physical condition), the degeneration 

process in the column and, more specifically, the vertebral osteoarthritis, can be also a 

response to activities which induct stress over the anatomical region: a good example is 

the site of Non Mak La, in which 19 individuals reported degenerative joint diseases, 

and in which the agriculture labors and the transport of weight can explain perfectly the 

presence of this pathological conditions in the column of the skeletons. Even if this 

presence of the columnar affections is, as said before, recurrent, sites as Ban Mai 

Chaimongkol or Ban Pong Manao (LIU, 2012, pp.241) shown that other areas can be 

affected (in the case of Ban Mai Chaimongkol, 4 individuals present degenerative joint 

disease in the column, but also a case in the shoulder and another one in the knee where 

documented; in Ban Pong Manao, aside of the 5 columnar cases, one in a hip and three 

in the feet). In this sense, the most typical areas affected are wrist/hands, as a 

consequence of the ceramic manufacture labors (LIU, 2012, pp.375; DOMETT, 2001, 

Chapter 5); the feet, as the result of intense locomotion (as in Bun Lum Kao: DOMETT, 

2001); or the shoulders, possibly because of paddling activities (DOMETT, 2001, 

Chapter 5). 

Again, the case of Ille Cave presented here doesn´t allow a comparative study, nor the 

relation of the conditions to any specific practice. 

? 5.3.3. Infectious diseases. 

As presented in Chapter 4.4.3, two of the 20 individuals analyzed also presented cases 

of infectious diseases: a case of osteomyelitis in the individual from context 703, and 

signs of periostitis and pubic osteitis (together with other smaller markers of non-

specific infectious process) in the individual from context 2247. 

The literature about infectious diseases in Southeast Asia is still quite brief for allow a 

comparative study, although the team of Marc Oxenham, which worked in several sites 

in Northern Vietnam, has already noticed some interesting facts in the area. According 

to his study, carried on over 96 individuals of the Da But period (Neolithic) and other 

96 individuals from the Metal Age phases of several close sites in the same region 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

111 
 

(OXENHAM, KIM THUY, LAN CUONG, 2005, pp.372-373), the infectious diseases 

are present in a small proportion in the Neolithic times (just 1/96 cases of the studied 

assemblage), while in the Metal Period their presence increases considerably (10/96 

cases). He explains this increase because of the presence of new pathogen agents, which 

appeared with the sedentary way of life and the domestication of some animal species, 

and which become more virulent trough time, being especially strong during the Metal 

Period because of the demographical growth. Other recent studies of the same author, 

for sites such as Ban Chiang, continue pointing in the same direction 

(PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2011, pp.169-171). 

Unfortunately, not much more studies have been done about infectious diseases in other 

areas of Southeast Asia yet, although the incoming publications of other Vietnamese 

sites (soon the well-studied Man Bac, for example) hopefully would ease the 

development of the bibliography by other teams working in other regions. 

In the case of Ille Cave, with a presence of infectious diseases of 10%, can´t be 

concluded yet how representative this proportion is of the real situation (note: two cases 

over a sample of 20 individuals). Is necessary, in this sense, to continue studying other 

individuals recovered on the site for a better statistic, plus compare it with other 

Philippine sites which could contribute to this point of view about the infections in the 

Prehistoric Southeast Asia which is still under construction.  

For conclude, can be noticed that the diseases present in the studied assemblage are 

quite normal and well known in the archaeological register for other areas (in fact, the 

periostitis is the most typically registered between the infectious diseases: ROBERTS, 

MANCHESTER, 2010, pp.417), so the results shouldn’t surprise the reader in this 

sense, since are within the parameters of normality. 

? 5.3.4. Healed fractures (trauma). 

Three cases of healed fractures were also presented in Chapter 4.4.4. The first of these 

cases was the healed nasal fracture in the individual from context 2247. Normally this 

kind of contusions are quite representative in cases of interpersonal violence or as a 

result of accidents from everyday activities which are conducted in an inhospitable 

environment (as in Plate 5.5; TORRES-ROUFF, COSTA-JUNQUEIRA, 

LLAGOSTERA, 2005, pp.78), but in any case couldn´t be determined exactly what 

caused this injury, although it seems the consequence of a lateral impact. Anyway, as 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

we will observe in the other healed fractures, seems logical to understand that in Ille 

Cave couldn´t be registered any phase of strong social violence, since just a few cases 

where documented and in all of them the fact than the fractures where healed pointed to 

situations of social care. 

 

 

 

PLATE 5.5. Some examples of nasal fractures from the archaeological site of Coyo Oriente, 

Atacama Desert, Chile (pre-Tiwanaku). Notice the misaligned overlapping bonny fragments in the 

upper image, and the horizontal fracture in the inferior one, similar to our case of study (From: 

LESSA, MENDOÇA DE SOUZA, 2006, pp.135; TORRES-ROUFF, COSTA-JUNQUEIRA, 

LLAGOSTERA, 2005, pp.78).

The second healed trauma documented is a healed oblique fracture in the left femur of 

the individual recovered in context 1825. This kind of trauma would have clearly 

affected to the mobility of the individual for the rest of his life time (WEBB, 1995, 

pp.198), so we could infer here questions related to his care from the rest of the 

community. Obviously this kind of fracture would have resulted in the fact than this leg 

was shorter than the opposite limb, producing locomotional disturbances, or even 

making impossible the movement of the individual. Although we can notice little 

attempt or lack of success in reducing this fracture, given the overlapping heal process 

(presumable lack of first aids: WEBB, 1995, pp.196), is true that this individual 

survived at least till the fracture was completely healed (process which takes at least 10 

months), so some help from his partners would have been required for his subsistence 

(maybe he was not able to provide food anymore cause of this condition, but was able to 

contribute to the community life otherwise). 

In the same sense would point the third case of trauma registered in the assemblage: the 

costovertebral trauma of the individual from context 484. If the healed femoral fracture 

would have, somehow, made more difficult the locomotion of the individual who 

suffered it, this case seems even worst: the dislocated superior ribs of the right side of 

the thorax, accumulated over the 8
th

 rib after the trauma, would have been a clearly 

focus of strong pain and infections (as show the different signs of the process registered 

in the column). The thoracic cage would have partially lost his shape, making the 

movement really painful, if not impossible, for an individual which surely survived 

enough time for allow the ribs to react trough the growth of new bone tissue, around 

their extremity of insertion with the column, creating the several flat surfaces which can 

be observed now in the bones and which showed the overlapping between bones which 

allowed the reassemblage of the thoracic cage.  

Unfortunately not much more bones of this individual where present, so that was not 

possible to infer potential consequences of this strong trauma in other parts of the 

organism couldn´t be noticed (the few bones present didn´t show any kind of 

pathological marker). Although, if the case of the healed femoral fracture already 

offered some ideas about the lack of knowledge of first aids in Ille Cave communities, 

in this case the idea becomes stronger: logical, since the reduction of a femoral fracture 

seems a much more simple proceeding that the stabilization of several dislocated ribs. 

In a more positive sense, as in the femoral case, this strong thoracic trauma is again a

114 
 

prove than the community had a perception of the health care which worked much 

better in long terms: the individual survived, at least for some time, and of course this 

would have been impossible without the support of a community which took care of 

him, and was able to understand his importance furthermore the fact that maybe was not 

so “useful” for the daily activities anymore. 

In a more general sense, the bibliographical references we have about traumatic lesions 

in Southeast Asia are quite brief, and normally referring to archaeological sites in which 

the presence of this kind of pathologies is more representative because of specific social 

dynamics. A good example in this sense are sites as Phum Snay, in Cambodia, where 

the high rates of traumatic lessons in the skull and facial area have been interpreted as 

the results of convulse times which would lead to the establishment of the Angkorian 

reign, times in which the interpersonal violence markers and the frequent appearance of 

weaponry in archaeological contexts (DOMETT, O´REILLY, BUCKLEY, 2011). Also 

the Indus Valley civilizations (Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro: 2600-1900 BP) are a great 

example of high rates of traumatic lesions (especially nasal fractures, as the one we 

registered in Ille Cave, and which together with the injuries of the cranial vault appear 

in up to 15,5% of Harappa necropolis) linked to violent periods associated with the 

formation of big states (ROBBINS SCHUG, GRAY, MUSHRIF-TRIPATHY, 

SANKHYAN, 2012, pp.9). 

If we leave apart these specific cases of convulsions over big demographically 

developed societies, the general pattern for the prehistoric incidence of traumatic lesions 

is Southeast Asia gets significantly reduced. During the Neolithic of sites as Ban Chiang 

in Thailand (PIETRUSEWSKY, TOOMAY DOUGLAS, 2002, pp-170-171), the 

presence of trauma is explained as the result of ambience and accidental origins, given 

the much more random distribution in the sequence for this period. In the posterior 

phases of the same site, we can observe that actually the presence of traumatisms 

increases significantly during the Bronze Age, possibly as consequence of the 

intensification of the agriculture, the sedentary lifestyle and the bigger population 

density, but in any case never with such a presence as the one documented from the 

preangkorian Iron or the Indus Valley. In the same sense, we have several sites in 

Vietnam (OXENHAM, 2006, pp.227), as the case of Da But, in which the presence of 

transverse fractures of the midshaft femur with diaphyseal overlapping (like the one we 

registered in Ille context 1825) just arrives to a 6,5% (being one of the biggest rates in 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

115 
 

the region of study), a percentage than together with the low presence of weaponry in 

the site allowed the scientist to infer that the traumatism in this sites proceeded from 

accidental falls or even animal attacks (OXENHAM, 2006, pp.232). Island sites, as the 

ones previously treated for Taiwan (PIETRUSEWSKY, TSANG, 2003) continue 

pointing to these lower rates. 

Also, comparative studies such as the ones accomplished in Thailand sites for the 

transition from Neolithic to Bronze Age (Khok Phanom Di, Nong Nor, Ban Lum Khao, 

Ban Na Di: DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.190) show again this idea that the fractures 

in the bones are more frequent with the intensification of the agriculture, possibly as a 

result of the presence of activities directed to create new spaces for developing this 

activities (DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.198-199), while the few cases of facial 

fractures start to be significant in the later phases, as a result of possible cases of 

interpersonal violence (DOMETT, TAYLES, 2006b, pp.203-204). 

The case of Ille Cave possibly would point to accidental-origin traumas: the 

costovertebral and femoral fractures registered are cases which point in this sense, since 

we have no evidence of particular moments of social convulsions. The hunting practice 

and its locomotional implications, as well as the landscape (geological relief), are two 

factors to take in account for trying to explain the small presence of bone trauma in the 

assemblage, which furthermore was healed in every case (the misaligned healed 

fractures would point to a lack of knowledge about first aids, but at the same time to the 

preoccupation by the rest of the community). We can´t determine if the case of nasal 

fracture has its origin in an accident or in interpersonal violence, since is just one case 

over 20 individuals analyzed, but again we insist that the presence of trauma (3/20 

individuals) points to an accidental origin more than to internal social fights. Again, the 

fact that the stratigraphic sequence is so difficult to interpret, and that our study just 

focus on a small part of the osteological assemblage in the site, together with the fact 

that we had no signs of rice agriculture practice in the site, made impossible 

evolutionary analysis as the ones explained for mainland Southeast Asia.

5.4. CONCLUSION: SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND THE 

LIFESTYLE OF ILLE CAVE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS. 

From the present work, some basic conclusions can be extracted here relative to the 

lifestyle and the health care in the prehistoric populations from Ille Cave: 

? The main objective of our study, the assessment of the evidence of pathological 

lesions in the prehistoric populations of Ille Cave, clearly succeeded, as the 

results exposed in Chapter 4 and Annex III can prove. 

? In relation to the dental pathologies registered in Ille assemblage, is interesting 

to notice the frequent presence of periodontal disease and calculus, which appear 

in almost all the individuals, as explained in section 5.2.1. This could be a 

consequence of the frequent use of elements such as the lime from the betel nut, 

which creates an alkaline environment in the mouth which facilitates the 

presence of these conditions. Although, is important to say here that in other 

similar sites from Southeast Asia, as the ones used in the present study for the 

comparative, the presence of both this conditions is also a constant, which could 

also be interpreted from the absence of dental hygiene. In this sense, Ille Cave is 

inside the parameters of what can be considered a normal pattern. 

? The chew of betel nut (section 5.2.4), which was already proved for Ille Cave 

before the development of the present work (MEDRANA, 2002), has also 

benefits for the dental health, such as the cariogenic properties: in this sense, 

maybe some ideas about dental care could be inferred for this population, 

although is true that its consumption could be the result of other factors (cultural 

reasons, avoid the altitude sickness, vice). This could explain the low rates of 

carious lesions in the assemblage studied (5.2.2), which furthermore is 

comparable to other sites of Southeast Asia in which the low rates can be 

explained by the introduction of rice as dietary base (in Ille there are no signs of 

rice agriculture). 

? The fact that the people of Ille used their teeth as third hand in the development 

of some kind of cultural-economical activities has been proved trough the 

analysis of the non-masticatory wear patterns of the frontal teeth in two of the 

individuals studied, as displayed also in section 5.2.4. This pattern is normally 

associated with activities which are normally developed by hunter-gatherers 

societies. 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

117 
 

? Some metabolic disturbances can be observed also in the adult individuals which 

origins we have to search in the childhood. The DEH (see section 5.2.3) points 

to this kind of disturbances, normally related to diet, in an interval between 7 

and 12 years old (the time in which the frontal definitive teeth erupt). 

Meanwhile, the case of cribra orbitalia points to a particular case of anemia or 

lack of vitamin B-12 (still in debate) during the sub-adult times, as discuses in 

section 5.3.1. Both this cases can point to dietary disturbances associated to the 

younger periods of the life of Ille people. 

? Some other pathologies, such as the trauma (5.3.4), can be understood also 

inside the normal patterns for this kind of societies, as shows the comparison of 

Ille Cave ratios of presence with the ones from the other Southeast Asian sites 

described. Their reduced presence can be a sign of the accidental origin of the 

conditions, together with the fact that no determinative signs of interpersonal 

violence or conflicts have been noticed in Ille Cave, as discussed in section 

5.3.4. 

? The environment around Ille Cave is also an important factor to take into 

account: the geological relief (for example in the karst itself), the profuse forest 

which covers the territory (CARLOS, 2010, pp.90-91) or the presence of savage 

animals which could actually wound the inhabitants during their quotidian 

labors of hunting, such as big mammals and possibly felines (OCHOA, 2009, 

pp.111-112), are just some examples of a risky ambience which could become 

hostile enough for causing the pathologies present in the assemblage. 

? In this sense, the present work proves that, nowadays, we have no signs of the 

practice of first aids over this presumably accidental injuries (actually no one of 

the registered traumas was reduced, as explained in section 5.3.4); although the 

consumption of medicinal plants and the possibility of palliative cares could be a 

reality. Actually, several plants have been documented in Ille Cave which have 

medical properties (CARLOS, 2010, pp.55): buchanania arborescens, 

traditionally used for healing wounds and cuts; eupatorium odoratum, for skin 

wounds and reducing the fever; or eleusine indica, another febrifuge. 

? What seems clear is that, in cases such as the femoral fracture or the hard 

costovertebral trauma (5.3.4), the growth of the bone (which completely healed, 

although misaligned, the femoral fracture, and which was also present in the 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez. 

 
 

118 
 

costovertebral case) demonstrates that the individuals survived to this injuries, 

which would have made them incapable at least for some time. The long term 

care of these individuals by the community seems logical and proves that, at 

some point, there was some concern about the pain of the others and the 

presence of these unfortunate conditions as part of their daily lives. 

? All this notes could be understood from the perspective of a mix economic 

model: hunter-gatherers which had some punctual domesticated plants and 

animals, but which still have the forest resources as first focus of their activities 

and main source of their food and raw materials, what would imply the necessity 

of movement around the territory, and so the exposure to possible risks which 

could cause the injuries.  

? This idea of an economical model based in the forest resources was already 

noticed in previous works on Ille Cave, such as the study of the macrobotanical 

remains (CARLOS, 2010, pp.90). Actually, the current tribal populations of 

Northern Palawan, the Tagbanwa and Batak peoples (DRESSLER, 2005; 

BOISSIÈRE, LISWANTI, 2006), still maintain this model which combines the 

hunting/fishing and gathering of natural resources in the inland forest with 

punctual domestication of animals and a little non-monocrop horticulture 

(swidden farming: small surfaces in the forest which they burnt, plant and 

abandon after the land loses fertility). In Plate 5.6 we can see some sample 

images of the Batak people performing these subsistence activities. 

? Furthermore, no signs of sexual diversification where registered in Ille, neither 

for the pathological conditions, nor for the possible activities registered, as 

displayed in Chapter 4. This could represent the reality or be just a consequence 

of the reduced assemblage selected as sample for this work.  

? In the same sense, the lack of absolute data in Ille Cave site for the layers 

studied makes impossible any case of evolutionary study about the health 

perceptions, as was also discussed in Chapter 4.

5.5. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES OF THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION. 

For finishing the present work, some ideas or future perspectives related to the facts 

which were exposed in the main text can be concluded here: 

? Since not all the cases of the assemblage studied where sexed or aged with the 

methods selected, maybe the use of other ways of approximation would be 

successful: the sex determination methods based on teeth analysis seems 

plausible for the particular case of Ille, since several cases presented here 

preserved the dentition (good references about some of this methods can be 

found in WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.387); and about the ageing of the 

individuals, the analysis of the sternal rib end or the radiographic analysis of 

some bone groups (WHITE, FOLKENS, 2005, pp.381) seem good examples 

which perfectly could be accomplished in Ille bone assemblage. 

? This possibility of sexing and ageing more individuals could be interesting for 

trying to infer patterns which could relate the presence of paleopathologies and 

activity markers with sex and age groups. 

? Would be interesting also to expand the study about Ille Cave paleopathologies 

to other chronologies: the comparison of the pathologies registered in the present 

work with the ones proceeding from the cremation cemetery or a potential study 

of the colonial phase would give us interesting results from the perspective of 

the evolution of the health in the population which inhabited Ille in a wide 

chronological point of view. 

? In the same sense, the comparison with the pathologies documented in the sub-

adults individuals from Ille would give us new information about this life period, 

and also would allow us to understand better some pathologies which were 

presented here (cribra orbitalia, DEH) and which pointed to possible cases of 

malnutrition during the childhood. Fortunately, the researcher Jessica Peña, from 

the ASP, is currently working on it, and the results of her master thesis 

(provisional title: Taphonomical analysis and bone representation on non-adult 

individuals of Ille Cave and Rockshelter, Palawan) will be presented soon. 

? Also, for understanding better the activity patterns of Ille archaeological 

populations, an interesting work is being developed currently in the ASP: the 

researcher Sarah Agatha Villaluz is currently studying entheseal changes 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

(musculoskeletal stress markers) and bone cross sectional geometry trough 3D 

scanning, in order to infer and reconstruct activity patterns of these populations. 

Her master thesis (provisional title: Reconstructing physical activity of adults 

from Ille archaeological site, El Nido, Palawan) will be presented soon as well. 

? Would be also potentially interesting to develop an archaeological-

ethnographical based study of the said medicinal plans recovered from the site 

(section 5.4), in order to understand the use of them and other cases in the 

current populations of Palawan island and try to understand if actually they 

where used in prehistoric times, what also would offer an interesting perspective 

about the conscience of health care in Ille Cave. 

? Also, dietary studies could be accomplished in the future trough the skeletal 

assemblage from Ille. In this sense, since the dental calculus deposits are present 

in the majority of teeth of the assemblage chosen for the present study, and in 

some cases these deposits seem to be considerable (although for the present 

work the quantification of calculus was not accomplished), and since calculus is 

known to be a really good source of information on paleodietary reconstructions, 

seems reasonable to take them as an starting point for potential investigations. 

Their observation with scanning electron microscope (SEM), isotopic analysis 

or even phytolith analysis (which also would offer information related to 

paleoenvironment) would definitely offer valuable information about the 

lifestyle of Ille Cave prehistoric inhabitants.

? POSTCRANIAL AXIAL SKELETON: 

Bone Description 

Vertebrae (7 cervical) At least five of them are present, since the anterior part of 

four of their vertebral bodies are present (vertebral process 

fragments are preserved, but is not possible to reconstruct 

and individualize this vertebrae), plus the axis, which is 

complete (including the odontoid process). Atlas hasn´t 

been identified. 

Vertebrae (12 thoracic) Present, but really fragmented, can´t be reconstructed 

(impossible to determine the exact number). At least five 

spinous process are present, plus some fragments of 

transverse process and periferical parts of the vertebral 

bodies. 

Vertebrae (5 lumbar) Present, really fragmented, like in the previous cases, but 

the presence of the typical morphology of the transverse 

process of this group (posterior view) allows us to 

determine that all the lumbar vertebrae are represented. 

Ribs (12 right) Present, really fragmented. The first rib is complete, but the 

rest of them are totally disconnected. Preserved the heads 

(articulation with the column) of at least another eight 

cases. The sternal ends are missing. 

Ribs (12 left) Present, really fragmented. Preserved the head of six of 

them. A group of 5 ribs fragments was recovered cemented 

over a shell during the excavation, so is still possible to see 

them in their original position, connected with the 

sediment. 

Sternum Missing. 

Sacrum Present, fragmented in several small pieces. The only 

recognizable parts (bigger fragments) correspond to the 

ventral arc (including the transverse lines), the dorsal Wall 

(including the medial crest) and the right sacroiliac joint 

(auricular surface). 

Coccyx Missing.

border and the glenoid fossa). 

Clavicle (right) Present, fragmented in three pieces. Remains the articulation with 

the acromial process of the scapula, but not the sternal articulation. 

Clavicle (left) Present, divided in two pieces (medial part of its body). Missing 

fragments in both its extremes (articulations with sternum and

(articulation with scapula) is separated, and the bone is also 

fragmented around the middle the diaphysis. 

Humerus (left) Present, once again fragmented in three pieces (head separated and 

divided in the middle diaphysis, like in the case of the opposite 

limb). In this case the distal epiphysis is also missing. 

Ulna (right) Present, fragmented in three pieces (broken twice around the distal 

diaphysis). 

Ulna (left) Present, also fragmented like in the opposite limb (three pieces, 

distal diaphysis), but in this case the distal epiphysis is also 

missing. 

Radius (right) Present, divided in four fragments: three of them which connect 

the proximal epiphysis and the diaphysis, and a separated one 

which correspond to the distal epiphysis (articulation with the 

hand). Unfortunately a fragment of the diaphysis, the one which 

connects the epiphysis with the rest of the bone, is missing. 

Radius (left) Present, fragmented twice along the diaphysis (in three pieces of 

similar dimensions). The distal epiphysis is missing in this side.

Vertebrae (7 cervical) All the cervical vertebrae are represented. The atlas (C1) is 

present, but just the vertebral arch, and in the case of the 

axis (C2) just appeared a fragment corresponding to the 

vertebral body and the odontoid process. C3 and C4 are 

also present and almost complete (except of a small 

fragment of the transverse process in both cases). Finally, 

C5-C7 are all represented but really fragmented. 

Vertebrae (12 thoracic) All the thoracic vertebrae are also represented. From T1-3 

was preserved the complete vertebral arches, excluding the 

left transverse process in the three of them. None of the 

vertebral bodies from T1-3 where found. In the case of T4, 

a fragment of the vertebral body is still preserved together 

with the vertebral arch, which in this case has lost the 

spinous process. T5 repeats the conservation status from 

T1-3, but in this case the missing transverse process is the 

right one. T6-7 and T9 present the complete vertebral arch 

still together with fragments of the vertebral bodies. T8 

instead just preserves the frontal edge of the vertebral body 

and the right transverse process. T10 and T11 preserves 

complete the vertebral body and almost all the complete 

vertebral arch. Finally, T12 misses almost all the vertebral 

arch (just preserved a fragment of the right transverse 

process), but preserved all the external edges of the 

vertebral body (which central part is also missing). 

Vertebrae (5 lumbar) All of them are present and complete, in quite a good 

conservation status. 

Ribs (12 right) All of them are present, but some fragments are missing 

(normally from the frontal edges, since the heads and the 

neck are perfectly represented in all cases).

infraglenoid tubercle and the scapular neck), but not the coracoid 

process. 

Scapula (left) Similar case to the previous one, but in this case is missing the 

inferior half part of the glenoid cavity and a big part of the scapular 

neck.

(SEX AND AGE). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 67   
 

? SEX DETERMINATION: 

Method of the cranial and pelvis morphologies (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER; 1994):

Ascending ramus (mandible) X  

 

Since the pelvic griddle is missing in this case, and we can just observe some features of 

the cranial remains, which mainly pointed to masculine characteristics (7/9 masculine 

vrs. 2/9 feminine), we conclude that we´re facing a MASCULINE INDIVIDUAL. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Not applicable 

(all the epiphyses used in this method are missing). 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(sutures are all disconnected and so fragmented that the cranial vault can´t be 

reconstructed). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): The third molars 

from the maxilla have already erupted, and so does the one of the right side of the 

mandible. The one of the left mandibular side, instead, seems not yet erupted: the root is 

still growing (we can see the cut in the apical extreme of it, not yet developed), and the 

alveolar surface of the mandible shows how the dental piece would fix in an 

intermediate grown position. Also, no calculus is shown yet in this dental piece (the 

only, possibly cause was still half-hidden). According to the method, this would include

the individual in an age interval between 15+/-3 years old (when the roots start 

growing) and 21 years old (when the molar has already erupted), so a SUBADULT 

individual or a YOUNG ADULT in its first years. Taking in account that all the other 

molars are already erupted, and that this one almost should be as well (root almost 

complete, ascending position in the mandible of the piece, etc), we would point more to 

the second case, with an age or circa 21 years old. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): The enamel of M1 and 

M2 is starting to be affected, starting to appear flat surfaces over the crowns, but M3 

seems still intact in both mandibular and maxillary sides. Also, the dentine is not 

appearing in any of the molar pieces. According to Brothwell, this wear pattern could 

determine an age of 17-25 years old, so it points to a YOUNG/SUBADULT-YOUNG 

ADULT individual. 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

We can conclude than the age rate of the context 67 individual of Ille Cave corresponds 

to a YOUNG ADULT individual, possibly of around 21 years old, so an individual 

which possibly just left the puberty behind.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE I 

(SEX AND AGE). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 484   
 

? SEX DETERMINATION: 

Method of the cranial and pelvis morphologies (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER; 1994): 

Since both the skull and the pelvic griddle are missing in this case, we can´t determinate 

the sex of this individual, so we conclude that the context 484 has an 

INDETERMINATED SEX. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the only 

preserved epiphysis in this individual are the ones located in the scapula (scapular 

acromion and scapular medial border), and since both of them are fused around 23 years 

old, this method allow us to determine than the individual had, as minimal, this age. So 

we seem to be facing, an ADULT INDIVIDUAL. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(skull is missing). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Not applicable 

(dentition is missing). 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): Not applicable 

(dentition is missing). 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

We can conclude than the age rate of the context 484 individual of Ille Cave 

corresponds to an ADULT individual, but we can´t be more precise about the age.

? SEX DETERMINATION: 

Method of the cranial and pelvis morphologies (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER; 1994): 

Since both the skull and the pelvic griddle are missing in this case, we can´t determinate 

the sex of this individual, so we conclude that the context 703 has an 

INDETERMINATED SEX. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Not applicable 

(all the epiphysis used in this method are missing). 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(skull is missing).

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

We can´t conclude the age rate for the context 703 individual of Ille Cave with any of 

the methods used in this study, so we will record it as a case of INDETERMINATED 

AGE.

The pelvic features don´t offer a clear result, since they seem contradictory and the 

analysis of almost them all is not possible (fragmented, not present parts, etc), but is 

interesting the presence of the preauricular sulcus, quite a feminine feature. Since the 

cranial skeleton offers us a wider variety of features to analyze, and (with just an 

exception) they use to point to feminine dimorphic morphologies, we can consider the 

context 727 individual as a PROBABLE FEMALE INDIVIDUAL. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the sternal 

epiphysis of the clavicles are not conserved (last epiphysis to get fused in the human 

skeleton), the higher age rate which we can determine for the context 727 corresponds 

to a minimal of 22-23 years (so a YOUNG ADULT), since the epiphysis which fuse 

before (scapular acromion, humeral proximal end, distal ulna) are completely closed 

around this age. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(fragmented skull). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third 

molar is already erupted, we can assume more than 21 years for the individual, which 

makes it to be a YOUNG ADULT. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): In the maxillary the 

three molars are quite worn, affected mainly in the inner part of the crown, in which the 

enamel is missing (maintained the periferical enamel). This should correspond to an age 

ratio of 25-35 years old (YOUNG ADULT?), but in the mandible all the molars are 

much more worn, losing completely the enamel, especially in the case of the third molar 

(which would surround the age to an older individual). Possibly this is because of 

dietary reasons, so in this case the method is not too much dependable. 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not 

applicable (just preserved a fragment of the right side pubic symphysis, which doesn´t 

give enough information). 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Is just 

preserved the auricular surface of the right ilium, but the conservation status seems quite 

good. Since the porosity of the surface is already lost (seems quite flat beside the 

concretions) and there is no presence of deterioration process associated to the elderly 

(porosity, lipping, etc), we can determine than the individual would be in the phases 5 

or 6 proposed by Lovejoy et al., but we can´t determine the level of densification of the 

surface clearly cause the taphonomical problematic. That’s why this method results in 

an age of 40-49 years old, which corresponds to a MIDDLE ADULT.

The pelvic griddle is not preserved in this individual, so we just could approach to part 

of the features from the skull. There, we could observe a dominant presence of male 

features, but some other pointed to more feminine characteristics (10 male features, 6 

female features, 3 not determinable). As we will show in a while, the age of the 

individual seems quite young, so the physiological changes that human body suffers in 

the adolescence possibly where still developing in his organism. So, we could determine 

that we are facing a PROBABLE MALE INDIVIDUAL. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Neither one of 

the epiphysis analyzed in this method are preserved, so we can´t use it. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(almost all the cranial sutures are missing). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third 

molar is already erupted, we can assume more than 21 years for the individual, which 

makes it to be, at least, a YOUNG ADULT.

179 
 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): In this case, we can 

observe clearly all the mandibular molars, which offer a similar wear pattern in both 

sides: since the first molars are starting to supper the exposition of the dentine, M2 and 

M3 just show some superficial wear of the cones. This could point to an age of 17-25 

years old (YOUNG ADULT, or even SUB-ADULT). 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): The pubic 

symphysis is not preserved, so this method is not useful in this particular case. 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): The ilium is 

not preserved, so we can´t approach trough this method. 

We can conclude than the age rate of the context 755 individual of Ille Cave probably 

corresponds to a YOUNG ADULT individual of around 21-25 years old, according to 

the only two methods which we could use (dental eruption and teeth wear), which in 

this case are quite accurate if we attend to the good conservation status of the 

mandibular dental pieces.

Since the pelvis is not present in this individual and we could just analyze some features 

of the skull (4 feminine vrs. 1 masculine), we can determine that this individual is a 

PROBABLY FEMALE one. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the sternal 

epiphysis of the right clavicle (last epiphysis to get fused in the human skeleton) is 

conserved and fused, we can assume at least 30 year for this individual, so is an OLD 

YOUNG ADULT-MIDDLE ADULT. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(disconnected and incomplete sutures). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third 

molar is already erupted in both mandible and maxilla, we can determine at least 21 

years for this individual, so it would be At least a YOUNG ADULT. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): The crowns of M1 and 

M2 in both sides of the mandible are quite weared, especially in the case of M1, in

which the dentine is shown and the cavities which appeared where the crowns used to 

be are now connected (not so much in the case of M2, in which the cavities are still 

isolated). Instead, M3 surface just started to flat the enamel, while there are no signs of 

exposition of the dentine yet. According to Brothwell´s method, this would be 

equivalent to an age of 25-35 years old, so a YOUNG ADULT individual. 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Not 

applicable (pelvic griddle is missing). 

We can conclude than the age rate of the context 800 individual of Ille Cave 

corresponds to a YOUNG ADULT of, at least, 30 years old (so almost middle adult 

already, as the clavicle suture shows).

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE I 

(SEX AND AGE). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 907   
 

? SEX DETERMINATION: 

Method of the cranial and pelvis morphologies (BUIKSTRA, UBELAKER; 1994): 

Since the pelvic griddle is missing (except of a fragment of the left sacro-iliac joint, 

which doesn´t offer any dimorphic landmark to analyze) and the only part of the skull 

represented is the fragmented maxilla and mandible (which offers some characteristics 

that could point to a male -gonial angle, thick ascending ramus and inferior edge-, but 

which we can´t consider enough for a clear sexual diagnosis), we can say that the 

individual from the context 907 of Ille Cave has an INDETERMINATED SEX. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since almost all 

the skeleton is missing, is not possible to use this method. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(no cranial sutures preserved). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third 

molar is already erupted in both sides of the mandible, we can assume more than 21 

years for the individual, which makes it to be a YOUNG ADULT. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): The erosion of the third 

molars in both sides of the mandible is quite light, since just affects to the enamel in the 

buccal-labial side. The first molar of the right side and both the M2 are, instead, quite 

weared: the crowns seem almost flat, and the erosion is starting to show part of the 

dentine. This pattern is associated with an age of 25-35 years old in Brothwell´s study, 

so we can assume we´re facing a YOUNG ADULT individual. 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): The pubic 

symphysis is not preserved, so we can´t approach trough this methodology. 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): The 

conservation status of the sacro-iliac joint which is present is so bad than this method 

can´t be used. 

 

We can conclude than the age rate of the context 907 individual of Ille Cave probably 

corresponds to a POSSIBLE YOUNG-MIDDLE ADULT individual of 25-35 years 

old according to Brothwell method, but we have to be sceptic about this results, since no 

other method was used and the context status is really deteriorated.

Since the pelvis is not preserved and the skull is so fragmented than just two of the 

features could be observed (offering, by the way, contradictory results), we can´t 

determine the sex of the individual in the context 1825, so INDETERMINATE SEX. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Not applicable 

(fragmented bones, all the epiphysis are missing). 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third

makes it to be a YOUNG ADULT. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): In the right mandible 

side (the only part of the mouth which preserves all the molars), M1 seems more wear 

than M2 and M3, but we still can identify the cusps in all of them. The wear level is still 

quite light, corresponding to the phase of 25-35 years old suggested by the method. So 

is possibly a YOUNG ADULT.

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the only 

preserved epiphysis are the scapular acromion (closes at 23 years old) and the ones from 

the arm bones (humeral medial epicondyle and distal radius, which closes at 20; 

proximal radius and ulna, which are closed by 19; and distal ulna, which closes at 24-25 

years), we can assume a minimal age of 24-25 years for this individual, so it would be at

the bone is really degenerated around it, so maybe its due to the conservation status 

itself), we can consider the context 2247 individual as a clearly MALE INDIVIDUAL. 

? AGE DETERMINATION: 

Method of the epiphyseal closure (MCKERN, STEWARD; 1957): Since the sternal 

epiphysis of the clavicles are not conserved (last epiphysis to get fused in the human 

skeleton), the higher age rate which we can determine for the context 2247 corresponds 

to a minimal of 24-25 years (so a YOUNG ADULT), since the epiphysis which fuse 

before (distal ulna and iliac crest) are completely closed around this age. 

Method of the cranial suture closure (MEINDL, LOVEJOY; 1985): Not applicable 

(almost all the cranial sutures are missing). 

Method of the dental eruption development (UBELAKER; 1989): Since the third 

molar is already erupted, we can assume more than 21 years for the individual, which 

makes it to be a YOUNG ADULT. 

Method of the dental wear analysis (BROTHWELL; 1981): In this case, we can just 

observe clearly the molars in the right side of the mandible (the left side is covered by 

concretions, and the maxillary dentition is missing, with the exception of the first 

incisives). It could point to an age of 25-35 years old (YOUNG ADULT), but since the 

pieces are also partially covered with concretions, we can´t completely trust in this 

method for approaching this particular case. 

Method of the pubic simphyseal surface (SUCHEY, BROOKS; 1990): The pubic 

symphysis of the right side (the only one preserved) doesn´t allow the analysis, since is 

affected by a possible pathology which deteriorated the bone structure, so this method is 

not useful in this particular case. 

Method of the auricular surface of the ilium (LOVEJOY et al.; 1985): Is just 

preserved the auricular surface of the right ilium, but the conservation status seems quite 

good. We can observe that the porosity of the surface is starting to disappear, revealing 

some areas in which the surface seems now much denser. So, we can determine than the 

individual would be in the phase 5 proposed by Lovejoy et al., which results in an age 

of 40-44 years old, which corresponds to a MIDDLE ADULT.

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

About the TEETH WEAR of this individual, we could observe that the erosion of the 

dental pieces affected lightly just some surfaces, always occlusal, which could be a 

consequence of the natural ATRITION. Anyway the individual was still a young one 

(just passed from subadult to adult), so it´s not strange that the dental pieces are almost 

intact yet. We couldn´t see any other pattern of wear which pointed to any particular 

activity or to any abrasive component in the diet. 

We could also determine a case of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE which was evident in 

both maxillary and mandibular sides, as well as the presence of REACTIVE BONE IN 

THE ALVEOLAR SURFACES, which could point to a possible infectious disease, 

for example a possible case of periodontal disease. The presence of several deposits of 

mineralized plaque over the surface of the teeth (CALCULUS) in almost all the pieces 

could also point to the presence of an infectious disease. The calculus deposits appeared 

in labial-buccal aspect in all the pieces of both maxilla and mandible (except the 

mandibular LM3, since was not still completely erupted), and also in the lingual aspect 

of the premolars and molars. 

Also, an ENAMEL PEARL was noticed in the buccal-lingual aspect of the left 

maxillary M3. The enamel accumulation appears in the edge of the teeth, just in the 

upper limit of the tooth root 

 

A): Lateral and inferior views of the mandibular LM3, in which we can appreciate that the root is 

not still completely developed. B): Detail of the buccal-lingual surface of maxillary M3, in which we 

can observe the enamel pearl registered.

Finally, it has also been registered the presence of a case of DENTAL ENAMEL 

HYPOPLASIA, characterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the 

surface of tooth crowns, clearly visible in this case in the four upper maxillary incisors 

(LI1, LI2, RI1, RI2) and in the mandibular canines and first premolars (LC, RC, LPM1, 

RPM1). Even if the macroscopical analysis already allowed us to determine its presence 

in these dental pieces (the grooves where easy to distinguish), a microscopical analysis 

was made over the 8 dental pieces, with positive results in all the cases (as we display in 

the following pictures). 

 

Results of the microscopical analysis made over several mandibular dental pieces of the skeleton in 

the context 67, in which we can appreciate the typical transverse lines of DEH. From A) to D): 

mandibular LC, LPM1, RC and RPM1. Notice that the teeth are not displayed in anatomical 

position (their roots are pointing up), but upside down, cause of photographical reasons (the 

microscope light worked better in this position, helping to illuminate the grooves and making easier 

the register of the pathology).

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 484   
 

? TRAUMA. 

This individual presented evidence of paleopathological conditions in the costovertebral 

area, in the right side of the thorax (the ribs of the left side are missing): 

- Vertebrae: all the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae preserved, from T8 to L1, 

presented signs of possible infection, especially profuse in the right side, around 

the area of insertion of the corresponding ribs. The area appeared covered with 

porosity and reactive bone, plus some thin osteophytes which were projected out 

of the vertebral bodies (possible ossification of the radiated ligaments, which 

hold the articulations of each rib with the corresponding vertebra). 

- Ribs: all the ribs preserved, from the 2
nd

 rib and till the 11
th

 one, presented an 

irregular shape on their heads, around the articulation process with the vertebral 

column. In all the cases new bone growth around the heads, which deformed the 

original shape of the cortical surfaces. This new tissue growth in interior 

direction, extending the bone head and the beginning of the rib bodies inside the 

thoracic cage, creating flat-shaped surfaces. In some other cases (5
th

, 6
th

, 9
th

, 10
th

 

ribs), the surface of the new bone presented negative semicircular marks, which 

could point to the overlap of another structure which made impossible the 

growth of the bone in this direction, being a limitation for it. Finally, in the case 

of the 6
th

 rib, an osteophyte developed from the interior side of the head directed 

to the inner thorax, in a vertical sense, giving it the aspect of a vertical bonny 

spike. 

X-Ray analysis was done over all the ribs, both in superior and inferior views, in order 

to detect possible conditions which where not identifiable macroscopically (for 

example, lines of healed fractures). Although the results didn´t show any hidden marker 

which was not registered during the laboratorial analysis, confirmed and helped the 

understanding of the growth dynamics of the bone remodeling in the rib heads, 

confirming again their direction (pointed to the interior of the thoracic cage). 

Some pathological conditions which presented similar markers where selected for the 

differential diagnosis, being all of them discarded because of different reasons: 

- Costovertebral joint osteoarthritis: the arthropaties present signs of contact 

between bone surfaces, which cause the growth of new bone tissue, but in this 

case no signs of this contact was observed (such as the eburnation of any 

surface), and the new bone growth in a too regular pattern which suggested that 

other anatomical structures could have guided it.

X-Ray results for the right side ribs of the individual from context 484 of Ille Cave. Several cases of 

bone remodeling can be observed in every rib head (white arrows), altering the original 

morphology of the bone. 

- Ankylosing spondylitis: discarded because there was no presence of 

morphological changes in the intervertebral surfaces (inflamated tissues, 

Andersson´s lesions) nor simetric syndesmophytes (calcified soft tissues, such as 

ligaments). Also not present the tipical intervertebral fusion of the advances 

stages of this condition.  

- Brucellar spondylitis: althought this kind of spondylitis doesn´t imply the 

destruction of the intervertebral discs, the signs previously descripted for the 

ankylosing variety where not present, what allowed to discard it. 

- Tuberculosis with spinal and rib involvement: discarted, since no signs of 

vertebral colapse, paravertebral abscess or tubercular abscess. 

For understanding better the process of the bone growth, the ribs where reassembled 

attending to the possible connection between the flat surfaces and the few concavities 

and circular-shaped negatives. Was noticed that the head of the 8
th

 rib fixed in the 

original articulation process of T8, but the growth of new bone in the rib head had

eroded partially the vertebral body. Even in this status the connection was still possible. 

Since all the superior vertebrae where missing, the reassemblage of the superior ribs 

was done attending to their surfaces and some signs of contact beneath them. The result 

showed a compression and overlap of all the ribs from 2
nd

 to 7
th

 over the 8
th 

rib, wich 

possibly remained in situ, as we can see in the inferior images. The inferior ribs possibly 

where also disconected, since the new bone formation completely disfigured the 

articulation process of their corresponding vertebrae. 

 

Proposal of reassembly of vertebrae and ribs of the individual from context 484, which displays the 

original position of the ribs during the bone alterations suffered after the trauma. 

This interpretation pointed to a probable case of COSTOVERTEBRAL TRAUMA, 

wich implied the dislocation of the ribs of the right side of the thorax, and which started 

a healing process without being reinserted in their original position. Since the rest of the 

thorax is not preserved, but the scapula from the same side doesn´t present any sign of 

pathological condition (what could point to a vertical direction of the strenght wich 

caused the trauma), we point to a possible blunt force injury from the back, wich 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

dislocated the ribs (some examples of possible causes would be: falling back from a 

considerable height, or over a hard surface, the impact of a heavy object falling over the 

back of the individual, etc). 

The individual survived, at least, enough time for the ossification process to start: even 

if the ribs where not fused, the bone reacted creating new cortical surfaces, wich 

adapted their shape to the spaces left between the contiguous ribs and other organs. 

Possibly, the infectious signs observed over the vertebrae, and wich are especially 

visible in the right side (same side in wich the trauma is present), are a direct 

consequence of the trauma.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 703   
 

? INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 

The only pathology which we could determine in the case of this individual was an 

infectious disease which affected absolutely all the surfaces of all the present bones 

(both tibia and both fibulae in the legs, and both ulna and the left radius of the 

forearms). All the bone surfaces presented a really irregular texture (with a wooden 

texture in some parts, or covered by reactive bone in others, as well as with a recurrent 

porosity), and also some shape irregularities (the big size of the neck in the proximal 

epiphysis of the left ulna, the big section of the neck of the right tibia –which we could 

compare to a much more natural size in the left side- and its bulging aspect, and also the 

irregularities in the cylindrical shape of both the tibial diaphysis) affected the bone 

structures. Also, all the bones where covered with lot of different openings (all of them 

with oval or circular shapes) which go through the bone cortex. 

This aspects could point to a case of SUPPURATIVE/PYOGENIC 

OSTEOMYELITIS, an illness which normally affects (like in this case) the long bones 

and which is easy to distinguish from other infectious diseases because of the presence 

of two distinctive markers: the INVOLUCRUM, a coarsely woven bone which 

surrounds the original long bone cortex (and which normally is easy to identify thought 

X-Ray analysis), and the CLOACAE/FISTULAE, oval or round-shaped openings which 

go thought the cortex (or even though the involucrum which could cover it) and which 

allow the drainage of the pus from the medullary cavity, where the bacteria originally 

caused the infection. 

Since the presence of this characteristics are particular from this specific infectious 

disease (so the differential diagnosis is clear in this case), we had to discard the 

possibility of that the particular morphology of the bones was a consequence of post-

depositional factors. The macroscopical analysis allowed us to identify the involucrum 

in all the described altered surfaces (the bones where fractured in this points, so the 

observation of the sections would allow us to see the differences in the texture between 

the original cortex and the new bone which surrounded it, much more woven), so we 

could discard the taphonomical explanations. 

X-Ray analysis was also committed over all the bones in which the pathological 

markers where identified macroscopically, giving again positive results: both the 

cloacae and the new bone growth where identified.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 727   
 

? DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. 

In the case of the context 727 of Ille Cave, we could diagnose that suffered a case of 

OSTEOARTHRITIS, which, in this case, was located just in the vertebral column area 

(not possible to find signs of the disease in any other joint). Normally the disease 

manifest in three peculiar aspects, which we can see below: 

ASPECT LOCATION 

Osteophytes and 

bonny plaques 

Small nodules of reactive bone where documented in the surface 

of several vertebrae (cervical, thoracic and lumbar areas), 

normally over the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral 

bodies. 

 

*Marked in green color in the following images. 

Marginal lipping Located in several vertebrae, especially in the ones ascribed to the 

last thoracic and the lumbar ones. The lipping is generally 

associated to the edges (superior and inferior) of the vertebral 

discs, growing laterally from them as consequence of the 

mechanical action between the surfaces of both following bones, 

caused by the lost cartilage of the joint between them. 

 

*Marked with red arrows in the following images. 

Eburnated 

surfaces 

In this case we couldn´t find any case, since the taphonomical 

conditions (concretions all over the surface) didn´t allow us to 

make a deeper analysis over the bones. 

   

 

A): connected vertebrae from the cervical area. B): osteophyte over the superior vertebral body of 

one of them (marked in a green circle). Notice that the bad preservation status didn´t allow us to 

determine the exact position of each bone inside the vertebral column.

In this serial of photography, we can see several cases of osteophytes (marked in Green circles) and 

marginal lipping (red arrows) over the bodies of several vertebrae. All the cases seem to belong to 

the thoracic area, but is not possible to determine the correct anatomical order, cause of the bad 

conservation status of the spine.

209 
 

 

 

Another three cases of marginal lipping (marked with red arrows) documented in the vertebral 

body edges of several vertebral fragments (thoracic-lumbar area). 

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

The first fact which called our attention over the dental pieces of this individual was the 

strong level of EROSION OF THE TEETH WEAR, clearly visible in all the dental 

pieces (missing morphology and enamel), but which affects specially to the molars, and 

in a higher grade to the ones of the mandibular side (inferiors). Some interesting facts 

about this particular erosion kind let us to associate this wear case to some kind of 

activity (maybe holding ropes or fibers with the molars?): the third molar was much 

more eroded than the first and the second one in both sides (which is quite strange, since 

is the last dental piece in erupt), losing completely all its crowns (which still a little bit 

visible in M2 and M3), and with a different siding than the other teeth (the erosion 

surface sides to the front, meanwhile in M2 tends to be lateral or goes to the interior of 

the mouth). Beneath all the possible explanations for this phenomenon, we have 

associated this case to a POSSIBLE CONSUMPTION OF BETEL NUT, since the 

wear pattern is similar to other ones proceeding from archaeological register (see main 

text, Chapter 4) and it has also been documented in macro-botanical register of our site. 



PALEOPATHOLOGIES OF THE PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS OF ILLE CAVE.                              Guillermo Pérez Gutiérrez.

The wear pattern registered in the molars of both sides of the mandible make us thought about a 

possible case of abrasion, owned to some kind of human activity. In the image we can see the case of 

the right molars, in occlusal, labial and lingual aspects. 

Is also interesting the TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE (possible case of periodontitis?), 

caused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible. This disease is 

particularly easy to verify in the case of the incisive, canines and premolars of both 

sides (both mandible and maxilla are quite fragmented around the molar area, so is not 

possible to determine if the visibility of the roots is caused because of a pathology or 

because taphonomical reasons). 

It has been also documented a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, 

characterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, 

clearly visible in this case in all the four canines (mandibular and maxilla) and in three 

of the mandibular incisives (RI1, LI1 and LI2). The strong tooth wear level and the 

calcium carbonate which cover all the surfaces made impossible to analyze the rest of 

dental pieces in order to determine its presence in all the teeth, but microscopical 

analysis was made over the seven dental pieces in order to clarify the diagnosis, with 

positive results. 

The presence of CALCULUS (mineralized dental plaque) in almost all the dental 

pieces (both inside and outside the mouth cavity, in a yellowish color) is also an 

interesting sign of possible infections, but we couldn´t find any other sign (reactive 

bone, irregular or granulose surfaces, porosity, etc) which could help us to determine the 

presence of a clear case, once again because of taphonomical reasons. The calculus are 

present in the sides of tooth crowns, both in mandible (RI1, RI2, LI1, LI2, RC, LC, 

RPM1, RPM2, LPM1, RM2, RM3) and maxilla (RI1, RI2, LI1, LI2, RC, LC, RPM1, 

LPM1, LPM2, RM2, LM1, LM2). 

? NON-METRIC TRAILS. 

Finally, was also documented a case of non-metric trails, which manifest in the maxilla 

in the shape of a too big mental foramen in both sides.

We can observe the teeth wear patterns, being especially interesting the one present in the 

mandibular molars (possibly caused by activity), and also the calculus distribution ant the 

exposition of the roots. Also interesting the big mental foramen (non-metric trail).

 CONTEXT Nº: 755   
 

? DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. 

In the case of the context 755 of Ille Cave, we could observe some cases of MINOR 

MARGINAL LIPPING in all the cervical vertebral bodies surfaces after C2 

(included), but we can´t speak about any proper joint disease. For example: the most 

common case, the osteoarthritis, manifest presence of bone lipping, but is normally 

linked to other aspects (osteophytes, bonny plaques, eburnated surfaces, etc) which are 

not present in this study case.

216 
 

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

The first fact we tried to analyze in the dental pieces of the individual of the context 755 

from Ille Cave was the TEETH WEAR, clearly visible in all the dental pieces 

preserved, which missed their original shape with the consequent missing of the enamel 

and, in some cases, even part of the dentine.  

We could observe the effects of the ATTRITION in the molars of both sides of the 

mandible, and as well in the teeth preserved from the right maxilla (RPM1-RM2). The 

teeth wear is quite light, since the individual is still young, as we can appreciate thought 

the fact than the enamel is just starting to appear in the first molars. 

At the same time, we observed that the wear pattern from the frontal teeth of the 

mandible (incisives, canines and premolars) was different: it didn´t affect the surfaces 

with an horizontal pattern as in the molar crowns, or in the typical oblique shape that the 

attrition causes in this part of the mouth. Instead, the curved pattern of erosion in the 

labial aspects of this teeth, suggested a case of ABRASION which remembered us the 

case of the context 2247 of Ille Cave (as we can see in its pathological summary, a 

similar wear case which pointed to a POSSIBLE CASE OF USE OF THE 

FRONTAL TEETH AS THIRD HAND associated with some specific cases of 

cultural activities, like the WORK OF ANIMAL SKINS AND LEATHERS, as 

deduced from cultural parallelisms with native populations still alive). Unfortunately, 

the microscopical analysis in this case didn´t show us any mark (vertical sulcus, micro-

fractures, chipping, etc) which allowed us to point so clearly to this kind of activities, so 

we have to be cautious with this case. 

Also we could notice the presence of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, 

caused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which 

appeared together with a little of REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the 

alveolar process of both maxilla and mandible. All this facts together could point to a 

case of infectious disease, more specifically to a possible case of periodontal disease. 

The idea of the buccal infection gains weight if we notice also the presence of some 

CARIES which started to appear in the occlusal surfaces of  the mandibular molars 

(RM2, RM3, LM2 and LM3), even if the tissue still shows a small level of damage (just 

some small pits which affect mainly to the dentine). Also CALCULUS was noticed in 

all the dental pieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. 

Finally, it has been also documented a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, 

characterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, 

clearly visible in this case in the RC labial aspect (mandible). The other dental pieces 

doesn´t show it clearly, since are covered with the calculus and their surfaces are 

affected by the described wear pattern, but the microscopical analysis made over this 

individual tooth makes clear the diagnosis.

Dentition of the context 755. We can observe the labial-buccal accumulation of calculus in the 

different teeth, the curved wear pattern of the frontal teeth (possibly because of the use of the 

mouth as third hand for some activities), the root exposure and the signs of infection in the alveolar 

bone in the mandible. Also, marked with green arrows, several caries in the mandibular molars, 

and in black arrows some horizontal grooves in the RMC which prove the diagnosis of DEH.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 800   
 

? DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. 

This individual also had an interesting case of exostosis over bone surface: a small 

bonny plaque of new bone tissue (HYPEROSTOSIS) was formed in the right clavicle 

sternal end. We couldn´t determine if we are facing just new generated bone or maybe a 

process of calcification over the soft tissues of the sternoclavicular joint, but in any case 

both process appear normally together in joint pathologies.  

We determined that we were facing a PROBABLE CASE OF STERNOCOSTO-

CLAVICULAR HYPEROSTOSIS, a rare pathology which can appear in this area 

sometimes, and in which both new bone growth and ossification of articular soft tissues 

are present. We based our differential diagnosis in two other similar pathologies which 

can manifest in the same area and with similar markers: 

? Osteochondroma/osseocartilaginous exostosis: a kind of benign tumor that is 

really rare in clavicles. Is associated with a differential growth of the medial 

clavicle, which we can´t determine here (missing) and with the presence of 

reactive bone around the clavicle´s epiphysis (not just in the joint surface itself), 

which we didn´t record in this case. 

? Aseptic osteonecrosis, different arthropaties, etc: the also present erosion and/or 

degeneration process aver the joint surfaces, process which didn´t appear in our 

case. 

 

Anterior and lateral views of the right clavicle sternal end of our individual, in which we can

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

No dental diseases where documented in this case because of the poor conservation 

status of the bones (concretions all over the surfaces and almost all the maxilla is 

disintegrated, plus the middle part of the mandible is missing). About the TEETH 

WEAR of this individual, we could observe that the erosion of the dental pieces 

affected lightly just some surfaces, always occlusal, which could be a consequence of 

the natural ATRITION.  

 

Dentition of the context 800. As we can see, the attrition caused a horizontal wear pattern over the 

occlusal surfaces of the molars. We didn´t record any wear pattern which could point to any kind of 

dietary information or activity reason. No other pathologies documented. 

? METABOLIC DISEASES. 

Also, the skeleton from the context 800 of Ille Cave presented a concentration of 

porosity in the right supraorbital ridge (the left one is not present). We immediately 

determined that should be a pathological sign, since the porosity appeared located in a 

concentrated shadow in the orbit roof, while the rest of the bone surface had no any 

other kind of marks. We determined a case of CRIBRA ORBITALIA, since this kind 

of porosity accumulations around the orbital roof are a characteristic landmark of this 

pathology.

 CONTEXT Nº: 907   
 

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

The first fact we tried to analyze in the dental pieces which we could ascribe to this 

individual (the context included extra dental pieces, and the conservation status of both 

mandible and maxilla didn´t allow us to determine in some cases which one of the 

possible options was actually part of the individual, so we decided to base our study in 

the few one which surely where part of it) was the TEETH WEAR. The occlusal 

surfaces of the teeth showed an advances level of erosion, which showed concavities in 

the crowns of the molars. We assumed that was a consequence of an intense 

ATTRITION case, which normally develops these concavities in the occlusal surfaces 

(when the wear arrives to the dentine, which degenerates faster than the enamel). Since 

no signs of activity patterns where founded, we can´t speak about any kind of activity 

signs, but is possible that the wear process was stronger and faster cause dietary reasons 

(abrasive food?). In any case, since almost all the dental pieces are missing, once again 

we should be cautious about these ideas. 

Another feature that we could observe in this individual was an advanced level of 

TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE, with a strong recession of the alveolar bone, which also 

seemed to show signs of a possible infection (POROSITY and CALCULUS). All this 

could be signs of a possible periodontitis, but in any case would be quite light compared 

to the one documented in other individuals of Ille Cave (the calculus is really light and 

affects just to some pieces, the alveolar process presents a lighter porosity, etc). Again, 

since almost all the dental pieces are missing, we can´t determine more than the fact of 

that this signs are markers of a possible infection, but we can´t go deeper in our 

analysis.

Dentition of the context 907. We can observe the occlusal wear pattern and the root exposure. 

Unfortunately, the conservation status (several missing pieces) ant the concretions of carbonate 

which cover all the surfaces, made impossible a deeper analysis in this case of study. Even like that, 

we were able to determine the presence of a thin calculus accumulation in the labial side of the 

teeth, and also some porosity in the preserved alveolar surfaces which could point to a possible 

buccal infection.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 1337   
 

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

About the TEETH WEAR patterns of the individual 1337 from Ille Cave, we can just 

say here that we didn’t notice the presence of any kind of abrasive material between the 

teeth (no marks of activity, nor dietary elements, which could break with the normal 

ATTRITION between opposite teeth, which is clearly resent here with the natural 

occlusal pattern: flat surfaces in molars and oblique ones in the frontal teeth).  

We noticed again the presence of the TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, 

caused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which 

appeared together with a light case of alveolar infection, manifest thought the presence 

of REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the alveolar process of both mandible 

and maxilla. All this facts together could point to a possible case of infectious disease, 

as also does the presence of CALCULUS deposits, which where noticed in all the 

dental pieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. The 

calculus accumulated in the dental pieces of this individual is the most significate of all 

which we registered in our study of Ille Cave: specially in the buccal side of the 

mandibular incisives, the deposits of mineralized dental plaque where so big that they 

even made contact beneath them, giving an uniform appearance of the surface. 

Another interesting fact that we could register in this individual is a complete process of 

ALVEOLAR RIDGE RESORPTION in the surface of the maxilla, where previously 

would have been the RM3, so we can determine that the individual lost this dental piece 

during his life time (ante mortem).

the alveolar ridge around the lost RM3 (red circle).

Dentition of the context 1337. We can observe the teeth attrition, the root exposure and the signs of 

infection in the alveolar bone in both mandible and maxilla. Notice also the big deposit of calculus 

over all the teeth, especially in the case of the lingual aspect of the mandibular incisives and canines 

(pink boxes). 

Finally, it has been also documented a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, 

characterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, 

clearly visible in this case in the labial surface of several dental pieces: in the maxilla, 

DEH was registered in LI1, RI2 and both C; in the case of the mandible, was founded in 

both I1, the right I2 and again in both C. As usual, microscopical analysis was done 

over all this teeth, giving positive results in all the cases studied.

BIOLOGICAL PROFILE II 

(PALEOPATHOLOGIES). 

 

 CONTEXT Nº: 1825   
 

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

Between the dental diseases of this individual, we just could determine an advanced 

level of TEETH WEAR which affected de frontal dental pieces of both mandible and 

maxilla in an oblique buccal pattern, and the molars in a horizontal pattern over the 

occlusal surface. Since no marks of any kind where documented during the microscopic 

analysis, we assume that was just a consequence of the natural ATTRITION. 

Also, called our attention the advanced level of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE, with the 

recession of the alveolar bone, in both mandible and maxillary surfaces. Unfortunately, 

the big accumulations of carbonate concretions (taphonomy) all over the surfaces of 

both teeth and alveolar surfaces made impossible to determine any other condition 

(calculus, abscess, reactive bone, enamel hypoplasia, etc), so we couldn´t point to any 

specific disease. 

 

Dentition of the context 1825. We can observe the root exposure, especially in the upper frontal 

teeth and in the sequence RPM2-M3 of the mandible. No more pathologies where registered in this 

case of study, since the conservation status didn´t allow us.

? TRAUMA. 

The individual also presented a healed fracture of the left femur: on the midshaft of the 

bone we can observe a case of oblique/transverse fracture, healed but misaligned, which 

would have clearly affected to the mobility of the individual for the rest of his life time.  

Even if unfortunately the fractured area was affected with an orthogonal modern 

fracture, this event allowed us to analyze the section of the bone in the area, getting 

interesting information: we could see, in fact, that the fracture was oblique and that it 

didn’t repair in its original aligned position, but in a lateral superposition between both 

fragments, since both medullary cavities appear in a parallel position in the visible 

section.  

We couldn´t determine the presence of a callus, what together with the formation of 

lamellar/woven bone, which is already being replaced in some areas with trabecular 

bone, make us thought that the process of fracture repair was in the latter possible phase 

(remodeling stage). 

Of course X-Ray analysis was also used over this case, what allowed us to confirm the 

type of fracture and see more clearly the process of misaligned healing in this case of 

traumatism, as we can observe in the following pictures. 

 

View of the section (contemporary fracture) of the healed oblique fracture present on the medial 

left femur of our individual, in which we can appreciate two parallel medullary cavities, as the 

result of the non-aligned repair of the traumatism.

 CONTEXT Nº: 2240   
 

? DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. 

In the case of the context 2240 of Ille Cave, we could diagnose some degeneration signs 

in the vertebral column, in the few cases of vertebrae preserved. These small markers 

(some marginal lipping in the cervical area and a light Schmorl´s node in the only 

lumbar vertebrae preserved, in the inferior surface of the vertebral body) could point to 

pathological facts but, however, are not enough for pointing to an specific disease. 

In the same way could point the reactive bone documented in the guiding ridge of the 

left ulna, possible marker of a light degeneration of the elbow joint. However, no other 

signs of degeneration where documented in any other joint of both arms, so again we 

haven´t got enough proves for determine a clear diagnosis.

 CONTEXT Nº: 2247   
 

? DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES. 

In the case of the context 2247 of Ille Cave, we could diagnose that suffered a case of 

OSTEOARTHRITIS, which, in this case, was located just in the vertebral column. As 

we can see below, two of the three typical markers of this pathology are present in 

several vertebrae: 

ASPECT LOCATION 

Osteophytes and 

bonny plaques 

Small nodules of reactive bone where documented in the surface 

of several vertebrae, over the superior and inferior surfaces of the 

vertebral bodies: C3-4, T10-12 and L3. 

 

*Marked in green color in the following images. 

Marginal lipping Located in several vertebrae: C3-4, T4-12 and L1-5. The lipping 

is generally associated to the edges (superior and inferior) of the 

vertebral discs, growing laterally from them as consequence of 

the mechanical action between the surfaces of both following 

bones, caused by the lost cartilage of the joint between them. 

 

*Marked with red arrows in the following images. 

Eburnated 

surfaces 

We couldn´t determine the presence of any eburnated surface in 

2247 vertebrae, but the presence of both the previous markers 

seems enough for the diagnosis. 

  

Also was possible to identify several SCHMORL´S NODES in all the vertebrae of the 

lumbar area (L1-5), located in all the cases in the central vertebral body superior and 

inferior surfaces, and which appear as small pits or depressions over the bone surface 

(caused by the inflammation and protrusion of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc 

thought the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebrae). Even if Schmorl´s 

nodes can be linked also the osteoarthritis in some cases (can be part of its 

symptomatology), is not necessary that this occurs, so we registered both cases as 

different paleopathological evidences. We can observe them also in the attached 

photography (next page, marked in yellow). 

? TRAUMA. 

We also registered a case of a HEALED NASAL FRACTURE in this individual, 

which we could determine by the presence of an horizontal groove which crossed the 

right nasal bone (fracture line), the irregularities in the articulation with the opposite 

nasal and the right maxilla (the nasal fragmented piece healed in a different position to 

the original one) and also because of the presence of a deviation in the vomer bone (the 

deviation of the nasal septum is normally present in this cases of nasal trauma).

In this series of photography, we can see several cases of osteophytes (marked in green circles) and 

marginal lipping (red arrows) over the bodies of several vertebrae (C3-4 and L1-2), considered 

markers of osteoarthritis, as well as some Schmorl´s nodes in the lumbar area vertebrae (marked in

? DENTAL DISEASES. 

In the individual of the context 2247 from Ille Cave, we could observe two different 

patterns of TEETH WEAR, in different areas of the mouth, and which had a different 

interpretation: 

? In the deeper part of the mouth, the erosion of the dental pieces follows an 

occlusal pattern of wear in horizontal plane. As we can see in the mandible 

molars and first premolars, the horizontal wear has already arrived to the point 

of transforming the original shape of the dental pieces: the crowns have already 

disappeared, and the dentine starts to appear beneath the enamel loss. This kind 

of horizontal occlusal pattern corresponds to the natural ATTRITION: the wear 

of the dental pieces because of their friction with the opposite ones during the 

masticatory process. 

? Instead, the frontal teeth of this individual present a different scenario in the 

mandible: all the mandibular incisives and the first premolars have an oblique 

pattern of wear, as normally happens because of the attrition. But, in this case, 

the surface appears curved in the labial aspect (macroscopically, is easy to 

observe this rounded shape of the enamel in the premolar area), what suggest a 

non-natural factor of erosion: this particular shape could be the result of the 

ABRASION, so the involvement in the process of a third element between both 

teeth files (abrasive element on the diet, object, etc). Comparing this case with 

ethnographical studies made over other contemporaneous native populations 

(Ex: Inuit, Australian aborigines, etc), we noticed that this wear pattern is 

normally associated with the development of some specific cultural practices or 

economic activities. We could determine the presence of a POSSIBLE CASE 

OF USE OF THE FRONTAL TEETH AS THIRD HAND. The analysis of 

the mandibular frontal teeth in the microscope also gave us some interesting 

clues: we could register a microrotures of the enamel of LI2, which goes over all 

the labial aspect of the tooth, from the occlusal edge to the root, in a vertical 

disposition which normally is related to a vertical strength made over these teeth 

line, from up to down. Again, the ethnographical comparative allowed us to give 

a possible explanation: the WORK OF ANIMAL SKINS AND LEATHERS 

causes the same wear pattern in the Inuit, with the presence of the same shape 

and the same kind of microrotures, as a result of the vertical strength made over 

the animal skin, pulling down of it while holding it with the teeth. 

Also we could notice the presence of TEETH ROOT EXPOSURE in this individual, 

caused by the alveolar bone recession of both maxilla and mandible, and which 

appeared together with a little of REACTIVE BONE and POROSITY around all the 

alveolar process of both maxilla and mandible. All this facts together could point to a 

possible case of infectious disease, more specifically to a possible case of periodontal 

disease. 

The idea of the buccal infection gains weight if we notice also the presence of some 

CARIES which appeared in the mandibular molars (in LM1 inter-dental aspect with

Dentition of the context 2247. We can observe the accumulation of calculus in the different teeth, 

the curved wear pattern of the frontal teeth, the root exposure and the signs of infection in the 

alveolar bone and the caries in the three molars of the right side of the mandible.

LM2, and in buccal-labial aspect in LM2 and LM3), and which had quite an advanced 

status: the pits where really deep, arriving in all cases to the center of the teeth, and 

covering almost all the lateral surfaces. Also CALCULUS was noticed in all the dental 

pieces preserved, distributed horizontally in bot labial and lingual aspects. 

Finally, it has been also registered a case of DENTAL ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA, 

characterized by the typical transverse lines and grooves on the surface of tooth crowns, 

clearly visible in this case both macroscopically and under the microscope in maxillary 

first incisives of both sides (RI1 and LI1) and in the LC of the mandible.

the surface of LC.

? INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 

About the infectious diseases, is really interesting the case of the pathology registered in 

both limbs of this individual: the epiphysis of both legs (both femurs and tibiae) and 

arms (both humerus, left ulna and right radius) where covered with several areas in wich 

the original cortical surfaces where covered with an extra layer of new bone formations, 

normally in the shape of small plaques and fine pitting, giveing the bone a woven 

porous aspect. The disposition of this new bone tissue in longitudinal striations allowed 

us to determine a case of PERIOSTITIS in both arms and legs: the differential 

diagnosis is inmediate with other cases of infrectious diseases, because this particular 

organization of the new bone in paralel striae is typical and definitory of the periostitis. 

Also, some small osteophyte was doccumented in the distal left fibula (marked in a 

circle in the next photography), another characteristic wich normally comes associated 

with the periostitis. 

Is interesting that the distribution of this new bone formations affects specially to the 

down limbs, and even more in the case of the tibia, another clue for the diagnosis, since 

normally this kind of infectious disease manifest stronger in the tibial diaphysis. The 

origin of the disease comes normally from the formation of microtraumatisms wich 

appear in the periostium of the long bones in the legs, caused by locomotor intense 

activities (for example, intense running: the vibrations caused for the constant impact of 

the limbs in the floor causes the microrotures). This microrotures will be the focus from 

where the infection will expand a posteriori. 

 

New bone formation over the distal-medial surfaces of both left (A) and right fibulae (B), marker of 

the registered case of periostitis.

? NON-SPECIFIC DISEASES. 

Finally, another pathology was registered in the pelvic gridle: the surface of the pubic 

simpysis of the right side presents several pits and irregularities, together with shape 

loss, what seems to be caused by a degenerative process. Also, the growth of new bone 

tissue contributed to the current alterated aspect of the bone. 

Several options where take in account for the fdifferential diagnosis: 

? Osteitis. 

? Arthropaties. 

? Non specific infectious disease (part of the generalized case wich we shown 

before). 

? Trauma (Ex: pubic bone stress fracture) wich could cause a posterior infection. 

After discarting the presence of any significative fracture, we opted for diagnose a 

POSSIBLE PUBLIC OSTEITIS, since is a pathology wich can appear as the result of 

infectious process (but not in every case: that´s why we decided to catalogue this case as 

a non-specific disease). Is normally frecuent in sportive people, specially in cases of 

people wich makes a lot of exercise with the down limbs (what would fit well with the 

previous case of periostitis wich we analyzed), an normaly with intense changes of 

rhythm (abrupt acceleration/deceleration, climbing activities, kick movements, etc). 

This high intensity of the activity makes the pubic are suffer quite big stress situations: 

the strong abdominal efforts can create microtraumatisms, wich would be the focus of 

the inmediate infection. But also the ilness can be originated after the introduction of 

bacteries in the organism, arround the abdominal area, so the activity explanation ins 

not definitive in any case. 

In advances states of the pubic osteitis, the loss over the pubic simphysis outline is quite 

evident, like in our case of study, and also the symptoms can extend to the sacroiliac 

joint (in our case we could register reactive bone and marginal lipping in the same side 

joint, so the differential diagnosis worked, and even in the opposite side joint). 

Is really unfortunate the fact than the other pubic simphysis is missing, cause normally 

this pathology is symetric (manifest in both sides of the body, as we could deduct from 

the fact that both sacroiliac joints present lipping and new bone growth). The same thing 

happens for the attachment area of the gracillis ligament, wich is also missing in this 

case, since is another area in wich the pubic osteitis manifest in advances states. This 

missing informations make us to avoid a definitive diagnosis, so we can just say that the 

pubic osteitis is probably related to the markers that we can observe in the pelvic gridle 

of this individual.

Detailed pictures of the pubic symphisis of the individual from the context 2247, in wich we can 

observe the degeneration of the bone surface and the complementary growth of new bone.  

 

 

In advances states, like the one we have registered, the pubic osteitis manifest trought the reflection 

of the degenerative process in the sacroiliac joint. In the images, we can observe two perspectives of 

the marginal lipping in the right (A) and the left (B) sacroiliac joints.

? PHYSICAL STRESS MARKERS. 

Finally, some signs of new bone groth where registered in the shoulder area of the 

skeleton: 

- Clavicles: new bone accumulation over the ligament insertion areas (conoid and 

costoclavicular ligaments), and also arround the attachment of the deloid 

muscle. 

- Scapulae: bilateral signs of new bone formation and small osteophytes over the 

acromion process of both scapulae.  

 

For the differential diagnosis, two scenarios where present: 

- Some kind of infection in the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder articulation. 

- The alterations on the bone (new bone growth) as a response to an activity stress 

suffered in the area. 

 

We pointed to a case of OCUPATIONAL STRESS MARKERS IN BOTH 

SHOULDER ARTICULATIONS, since the bone was growing in the ligament and 

muscular insertions of the clavicles and the articulation of them with both scapulae. 

Similar lesions have been identified in the literature with rowers or people wich 

supported considerable levels of stress in their shoulders (carring, lifting and padding 

activities). In this cases the hyperdevelopement of the muscles wich participate in the 

joint circular movement provoques the new bone formation at entheses and 

syndesmoses, as in this particular case, in order to stabilize the attachment.

individual.
