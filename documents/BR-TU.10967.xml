ABSTRACT

Predictive maintenance is important to prevent catastrophic accidents in

oil and gas distribution networks, since failures in pipelines and other me-

chanical components may lead to serious economic and environmental

consequences. A possible approach to perform predictive maintenance is

to monitor periodically loads that act on these structures. This task can be

carried out through the Hole-Drilling Method to measure residual stresses,

a consolidated semi-destructive technique for both in-field and in-lab ap-

plications. Standardised by ASTM E837 – 13a, this method is based on a

blind hole drilling that relieves local stresses; the stress relief that occurs

after material removal induces a microstructure reorganization, settling

the material in a new equilibrium state after producing strains on the hole

surrounding surface. These strains are related to the stresses that caused

them according to Hooke’s law in linearly elastic isotropic materials. The

measurement result provided by this technique is intrinsically sensitive

to the drilling process and produced hole characteristics, since machining

induced residual stresses can mislead the true stress value. Besides, the

hole geometry may differ significantly from the model recommended by the

standard, provoking further errors in stress calculation. This work aims to

investigate a cutting tool and cutting parameters combination that presents

the best performance for residual stress measurements through the Hole-

Drilling Method from two perspectives: machining and Electronic Speckle

Pattern Interferometry application to measure strains. Two square end mills

(two and four flutes) with TiAlN coating were used to drill the following

workpiece materials: aluminium alloy AA 6061, carbon steel AISI 1020 and

stainless steel AISI 304L. Chip and burr formation are investigated in pre-

liminary analysis concerning the optical technique application since these

elements can cause loss of correlation and produce unreliable data. Rota-

tional speed and feed rates effects on machining induced residual stresses

are analysed through analysis of variance. Chip analysis is performed to

assess qualitatively plastic deformation suffered during the process. This

information are complemented with microhardness measurements to ver-



ify microstructural changes caused by the drilling process. Four-flute end

mill presented lower machining induced residual stress absolute values.

Particularly, the cutting tool and cutting parameters combination yielded

satisfactory results when drilling AA 6061 and AISI 1020. However, AISI

304L presented highly compressive machining induced residual stresses for

almost all conditions. The most influential cutting parameter on machining

induced residual stress introduction was the feed rate in the majority of the

tested conditions.

RESUMO

A manutenção preditiva tem um papel importante na prevenção de aci-

dentes catastróficos em redes de distribuição de petróleo e gás, uma vez

que falhas em dutos e componentes mecânicos integrantes destas malhas

podem trazer graves consequências econômicas e ambientais. Um dos pro-

cedimentos usados para tal fim é o monitoramento periódico dos esforços

que atuam sobre estas estruturas; isto pode ser feito através do Método do

Furo Cego para medição de tensões residuais, uma técnica semi-destrutiva

consolidada tanto em aplicações em campo quanto em laboratórios. Este

método, normatizado pela ASTM E837 – 13a, consiste na produção de um

furo cego, o qual alivia tensões localizadas; o alívio proporcionado pela re-

moção de material provoca a reorganização da estrutura, a qual se acomoda

em uma nova condição de equilíbrio, que se expressa em deslocamentos na

superfície vizinha ao furo. Os deslocamentos estão associados às tensões

que as provocaram através de lei de Hooke em materiais isotrópicos linear-

mente elásticos. O resultado de medição desta técnica é intrinsicamente

susceptível à qualidade do processo de furação e do furo produzido, pois

tensões induzidas pela usinagem podem mascarar o valor de tensão que se

deseja conhecer, além de produzir características geométricas que diferem

significativamente do modelo padronizado pela norma e podem provocar

erros no cálculo das tensões. Este trabalho visa estudar uma combinação

de parâmetros de corte e ferramenta que apresente o melhor desempenho

para medição de tensões residuais através do Método do Furo Cego tanto do

ponto de vista da usinagem quanto da aplicação da Interferometria speckle

na medição dos deslocamentos. Duas fresas de topo reto (dois e quatro

gumes) com revestimento de TiAlN foram utilizadas na furação de corpos

de prova dos seguintes materiais: liga de alumínio AA 6061, aço carbono

AISI 1020 e aço inoxidável AISI 304L. Formação de cavaco e rebarba são

avaliados em análise preliminar quanto à utilização da técnica óptica para

medição de deslocamentos, uma vez que podem provocar perda de corre-

lação e inutilizar pontos de medição. Os efeitos da rotação e da velocidade



de avanço na tensão residual induzida pela usinagem são analisados através

de análise de variância. Análise do cavaco é usada para avaliar qualitativa-

mente a deformação plástica sofrida durante o processo; estas informações

são complementadas com medições de microdureza para verificar alter-

ações na microestrutura causadas pela furação. Fresas de quatro gumes

apresentaram menores valores absolutos de tensão residual induzidas pela

usinagem. Em particular, a combinação de ferramenta e parâmetros de corte

mostrou-se satisfatória no caso do AA 6061 e AISI 1020, no entanto para

o AISI 304L foram encontrados valores de tensão residual induzidas pela

usinagem de caráter bastante compressivo em quase todas as condições.

Observou-se que o parâmetro de corte de maior influência na introdução de

tensões residuais pela usinagem foi a velocidade de avanço na maioria das

condições testadas.

UMA AVALIAÇÃO DO PROCESSO DE FURAÇÃO

EMPREGADO PELO MÉTODO DO FURO CEGO PARA

MEDIÇÃO DE TENSÕES RESIDUAIS

Introdução

A manutenção preditiva de equipamentos e componentes mecâni-

cos é uma atividade de importância vital na indústria de petróleo e gás; em

sua ausência, paradas não planejadas no ciclo de produção e contratempos

devido a falhas catastróficas podem acarretar prejuízos em várias esferas,

principalmente no âmbito econômico e ambiental. Uma das possíveis causas

de falha é a combinação de tensões mecânicas de operação e tensões residu-

ais no componente, que caso supere limites de resistência do material pode

provocar a ruptura da peça. Sabe-se que o estado de tensões residuais no

material pode sofrer modificações após a sua instalação, seja por condições

de operação ou fatores externos (por exemplo, um deslizamento de terra

que atinge as vizinhanças de um duto de transporte de petróleo). Deste

modo, monitorar as tensões residuais que atuam na peça é uma atividade

crucial para garantir a segurança de pessoas e do ambiente em que se in-

sere, além de evitar intervenções emergenciais que seriam muito custosas

para a indústria. Neste contexto, insere-se o Método do Furo Cego para

medição de tensões residuais, que apresenta como vantagens em relação a

outras técnicas concorrentes um custo acessível de operação, possibilidade

de portabilidade para inspeção em campo, além de ser um método que

já foi amplamente estudado cuja aplicação é consolidada tanto em ambi-

entes industriais quanto em laboratórios. Ademais, permite verificar tensões

residuais macroscópicas, que são as de maior interesses de engenharia. No

entanto, o resultado de medição deste método é sensível à produção do

furo, devido ao fato que a furação sempre introduzirá uma tensão residual

oriunda da usinagem.



Objetivos

Recentes atualizações na norma ASTM E837 – 13ª, que fornece

instruções sobre a aplicação do Método do Furo Cego, permitiram que a

faixa de parâmetros de corte fosse estendida. Este trabalho visa fornecer

dados acerca de novas combinações de parâmetros de corte (rotação e

velocidade de avanço) que minimizem a tensão residual oriunda do processo

de usinagem e consequentemente diminua a invasividade do procedimento

de inspeção, de forma que sejam fornecidos valores de tensão medidos mais

próximos ao valor do estado de tensões originais em dutos de petróleo e gás.

Tais dados servirão para melhorias no módulo de furação do equipamento de

medição de tensões residuais MTRES desenvolvido pelo LABMETRO/UFSC
que são previstas para futuros desdobramentos do projeto.

Metodologia

Medições de tensão residual através do Método do Furo Cego foram

executados usando como máquina-ferramenta o centro de usinagem de 5

eixos Hermle C42U, no qual foram acoplados o electrospindle Minitor SFIDA

MZ01 e o módulo de controle Minitor SFIDA MT01CP. Foram escolhidos os

seguintes parâmetros de corte: rotações de 25.000 e 40.000 rpm; veloci-

dades de avanço de 10 e 20 mm/min. As ferramentas de corte utilizadas
foram fresas de topo reto revestidas com TiAlN, de dois e quatro gumes.

Os materiais dos corpos de prova empregados foram materiais largamente

utilizados na indústria: aço carbono SAE1020, aço inoxidável austenítico

AISI304L e liga de alumínio AA6061. Os principais atributos analisados

foram a forma e dimensão do cavaco através de microscopia eletrônica de

varredura; medição de tensões residuais induzidas pela usinagem através

do Método do Furo Cego aliado à interferometria speckle; indícios de al-

terações na microestrutura nas vizinhanças do furo através de medições

de microdureza; finalmente, perfil do furo obtido através de microscopia

óptica. Estes atributos foram analisados para cada material e combinação

de parâmetros de corte tendo em vista uma solução de compromisso entre

boas características de usinagem e adequação ao uso do Método do Furo



Cego com a interferometria speckle. Análises de variância foram utilizadas

para avaliar as maiores fontes de variação dentre os parâmetros de corte na

introdução de tensão residual, enquanto testes pareados de Welch foram

empregados para verificar variação significativa da microdureza devido ao

processo de furação.

Resultados e Discussão

Foram observados que cavacos longos são bastante danosos à

aplicação da técnica de interferometria speckle devido ao fato que propiciam

a raspagem da superfície vizinha ao furo, causando a perda de correlação

e inutilizando os dados de medição. Cavacos de AISI 304L e AISI 1020

apresentaram uma estrutura com lamelas bem definidas, das quais pode-se

depreender que a condição de corte através do deslizamento de planos de

cisalhamento foi alcançada, sendo um indicativo de condições favoráveis

de corte de material. Cavacos de AA 6061 apresentaram aspecto bastante

viscoso, provavelmente devido à facilidade com a qual este material se adere

à superfície da ferramenta de corte e dificulta sua saída da zona de corte.

Verificou-se que a ferramenta de quatro gumes produziu, em geral,

menor nível de tensões residuais do que a ferramenta de dois gumes, além

de ter menor desvio padrão da amostra. Ao menos uma combinação de

parâmetros de corte produziu baixos valores absolutos de tensão residual

induzida pela usinagem para todos os materiais, com valores máximos e

mínimos dentro da faixa ± 10 MPa. A velocidade de avanço foi apontada
na maior parte dos casos como o fator mais importante na introdução de

tensões residuais induzidas pela usinagem. Foram detectados aumentos nos

valores de microdureza dos materiais testados na maior parte dos casos

quando houve alteração significativa, indicando um baixo aquecimento

da peça apesar do uso de altas rotações. O perfil do furo obtido com as

ferramentas selecionadas apresenta melhores características para aplicação

do Método do Furo Cego do que a fresa dental atualmente empregada pelo

módulo de furação do MTRES.



Conclusões

Resultados satisfatórios quanto à introdução de tensões residuais

induzidas pela usinagem foram encontrados e as melhores combinações de

parâmetros de corte foram selecionados para cada material. Estes resulta-

dos também se apresentaram adequados do ponto de vista da usinagem,

apresentando formação de cavaco mais favorável do que processo atual em-

pregado pelo dispositivo de furação do MTRES devido ao maior avanço por

gume, portanto com esmagamento de material e fricção entre ferramenta

de corte e peça menos intensos.

Ademais, múltiplos furos foram feitos com uma única fresa de topo

reto sem significativos aumentos nos níveis de tensão residual introduzidos

pela usinagem para uma dada combinação de parâmetros de corte, indi-

cando que o desgaste sofrido pela ferramenta selecionada é bem menos

agressivo do que a atual fresa odontológica que é descartada após único uso.

As fresas de topo reto produziram uma geometria de furo mais adequada

àquela exigida pela norma, com cantos vivos e geometria mais cilíndrica. Uti-

lizando a configuração experimental deste trabalho, notou-se que a rigidez

do módulo de furação do MTRES requer melhoras, pois exerce grande in-

fluência na qualidade do furo produzido e na dispersão dos resultados de

medição de tensão residual.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 CONTEXT

The aim of predictive maintenance is to spot the degradation mech-

anism onset and to correct the affected part prior to the structure or compo-

nent failure. In oil and gas industry, predictive maintenance is an activity of

major importance since great amounts of petroleum and its derivatives are

daily transported across long distances. In particular, the pipelines safety is

a crucial concern, as any significant harm in their integrity may lead to a

leakage, having as immediate consequences valuable raw material losses,

interruption in the transport network and nearby zone contamination.

In-service pipelines are subject not merely to mechanical stresses

originated by the workload; almost always, residual stresses are also present.

As they exist in the absence of any external load, residual stresses are often

neglected despite the fact that they can play an important role in the failure

of mechanical structures [1]. There are four main sources of residual stresses:
assembly process, thermal gradients, manufacture process and interactions

with the environment [2], which means that the stress state in the material
can change during service and should be monitored regularly in order to

avoid catastrophic failures.

Pipelines predictive maintenance calls for non-destructive or semi-

destructive techniques, i.e. those that do not harm the mechanical structure

integrity. Among them, the Hole-Drilling Method (HDM) is one of the most

widely employed techniques to evaluate residual stresses, conventionally

using strain gages for this purpose accordingly to the standard that en-

dorses this testing procedure, ASTM E837 – 13a: Standard Test Method

for Determining Residual Stresses by the Hole-Drilling Strain-Gage Method

[3]. However, in the past few years strain gages are being successfully re-
placed by Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI), since the latter

technique allows for non-contact and faster displacement measurements

portable interferometer.

cross-sections [6].

1.2 THE PROBLEM

The most recent version of the residual stress measurement device

MTRES (Figure 1.2) developed by Laboratório de Metrologia e Automatização

– LABMETRO/UFSC incorporates an air turbine drill, which presents the
following drawbacks: low and unstable torque, poor rotational speed control

and compressed air supply dependence; rotational speed depends on the

material being machined and its average value is around 210,000 rpm

[7]. Furthermore, MTRES employs carbide inverted-cone dental end mills
without coating; these cutting tools are used to drill only a single hole to

assure its quality, since the cutting tool suffers severe tool wear as reported

by Blödorn [7].

It is worth mentioning that both the pneumatic turbine and the

inverted-cone dental end mill have been recommended by the standard over

decades, however the configuration yielded by this combination may not de-

liver the less disturbing drilling procedure due to the resultant unfavourable

machining conditions [7].

The current standard version released in 2013 decreased the rota-

tional speed lower bound from 50,000 rpm to 20,000 rpm. Thus, better chip

formation can be expected from lower rotational speeds since higher feed per



1.3. Objectives 39

tooth can be achieved for a given feed rate, approaching the recommended

cutting parameters values accordingly to the machining theory.

Another element that can be easily improved is the cutting tool,

the inverted-cone dental end mill currently used can be substituted with a

square end mill properly designed to metal cutting.

Figure 1.2 – Main elements of the residual stress measurement device with
linear guides developed by LABMETRO/UFSC.

1.3 OBJECTIVES

From the aforementioned matters, an important modification in

the MTRES design concerns the high speed pneumatic drill replacement,

which can be substituted with an electric drill in order to allow a better

rotational speed control and higher torques. In addition, coated square end

mills were selected as the cutting tools.

The main objective of this work is to test the proposed cutting

parameters combinations and cutting tools to provide the best configuration

for further MTRES design improvements. This tailored configuration must be

a compromise solution between machining attributes and appropriateness

to the ESPI utilisation requirements.



40 Chapter 1. Introduction

To verify the suitability of the proposed drilling process for residual

stress measurement purposes, hole drilling experiments were carried out,

varying the rotational speed, feed rate, cutting tool and workpiece material.

Burr formation was also observed in a preliminary analysis to verify if their

size could compromise the measured area. Chips were qualitatively anal-

ysed to provide information about chip formation and plastic deformation

suffered during this process. Residual stresses introduced by the drilling

process were measured through ESPI technique, and their effect on the

surrounding material were investigated with microhardness testing.

This work is developed within the CARD3 project (Load Evalu-

ation in Pipelines from Residual Stresses), a partnership between LAB-

METRO/UFSC and Petrobras.

2 RESIDUAL STRESSES AND THEIR MEASUREMENT

The aim of this chapter is to present a brief overview about residual

stresses and their main measurement techniques, focusing particularly on

the Hole-Drilling Method combined with Electronic Speckle Pattern Interfer-

ometry for strain measurement, since MTRES operating principle is based

on these techniques.

2.1 RESIDUAL STRESSES

Residual stresses correspond to the stress state found within the

bulk material in the absence of an external loads and are self-equilibrating;

in other words, the resultant force and moment must be zero through the

whole body [1, 2]. They are an elastic response to an incompatible local
strain in the structure, such as a non-uniform plastic deformation, and

are created in order to preserve the dimensional continuity of the body

[8]. Their importance is often overlooked because residual stresses occur
without the application of any external force; depending on the operational

conditions a structure is exposed to, particularly in corrosive environments

and alternating service loads, such negligence can lead to the component

failure, as the residual stresses and mechanical stresses superposition can

surpass the material yield strength.

Residual stresses are introduced to mechanical parts by almost all

manufacturing processes (some examples are illustrated in Figure 2.1), but

they can also be developed during the component service life. The most

common mechanisms to produce residual stresses are non-uniform plas-

tic deformations, originated from many manufacturing processes such as

machining and forming, also happen in components under operating condi-

tions, such as railway rails or pipelines close to landslide locations. Another

mechanism consists of material phase and/or density changes, often in the
presence of high thermal gradients, that happen in some manufacturing

processes such as welding, casting, quenching, nitriding, among others;



42 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

during service life, this alteration may happen as corrosion [8].

Figure 2.1 – Examples of residual stress distributions caused by manufac-
turing processes [8].

Three main types of residual stresses can be discerned according

to their extent. Residual stresses of the first type have a macroscopic nearly

homogeneous characteristic that extends over several grains of the material,

and are equilibrated over the whole body. In a body that presents the

first type residual stress, any change in the equilibrium state will affect its

dimensions. Residual stresses of the second type, also known as structural

microstresses, are nearly homogeneous across microscopic small areas of a

material, affecting one grain or part of grain. They are equilibrated across

a certain number of grains; if the equilibrium of forces and moments is

disturbed sufficiently, macroscopic changes in the dimensions of a body

may be produced. Residual stresses of the third type are inhomogeneous

across submicroscopic small areas and range over several atomic distances

within a grain. Forces and moments are equilibrated over a small portion

of the grain. Third type residual stresses do not provoke macroscopically

noticeable modifications in the body dimension [1].



2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 43

Residual stresses can bring beneficial or prejudicial effects to the

material behaviour depending on their sign and location, impacting sig-

nificantly on material strength, fatigue life and dimensional stability [8].
Compressive residual stresses are known to have a favourable effect as they

improve fatigue life, retard crack propagation and delay stress corrosion. On

the other hand, tensile residual stresses generally have the opposite effect,

jeopardizing the component performance [2]. For this reason, monitoring
periodically the actual residual stress state in a component is vital to keep a

safe and reliable operation in many engineering applications.

2.2 RESIDUAL STRESS MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES

The inherent locked-in nature of residual stresses makes their mea-

surement a challenging task. Many residual stress measurement techniques

have been developed over the years to assess residual stresses either quan-

titatively or qualitatively; they vary in equipment costs, operational costs,

complexity, time required to acquire data and suitability for a given mea-

surement duty [9]. A comparison between many methods is provided in
Figure 2.2 concerning to their penetration and spatial resolution. James

[2] suggests that the main parameters that should be analysed to make a
proper selection are:

• nature of the material (crystallographic structure, chemical com-

position, phase, etc.);

• type of residual stress (microstress or macrostress);

• residual stress gradient (through the thickness of the part or only

near the surface);

• geometry of the component and the zone to be studied (depth,

dimension and shape of the region of interest);

• where the measurement is carried out (on-site or in laboratory);

• type of intervention (destructive or non-destructive);

• measuring time rates;

• precision and repetitiveness;

• measurement cost and the price of the equipment required.



44 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

Figure 2.2 – Penetration and spatial resolution for various residual stress
measurement techniques [8].

Destructive methods are based on the destruction of residual stress

equilibrium state by material removal or cutting, provoking a relaxation

(deformation) that is typically elastic. For this reason, a linear relationship

can be established between the released residual stress and the deformation

magnitude. The relaxation itself is not measured, but rather the conse-

quences of this effect, being the strain change the most used analysed

parameter. Among destructive methods, there are semi-destructive methods

that introduce little harm to the structure or component, which remains

fully functional even after the intervention. The most widespread totally

destructive methods are the Sectioning Method and the Contour Method,

while the most extensively used semi-destructive methods are Ring-Core

technique and the Hole-Drilling Method [10]. These techniques are sensitive
to macroscopic stresses, which are the most important residual stresses for

engineering applications [2].



2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 45

Sectioning Method (Figure 2.3) is based on the principle that resid-

ual stresses are relieved by cutting the component in several strips of smaller

cross sections. Heat and plasticity effects during the cutting process must

be minimal to mitigate the contamination of the original residual stress

value. Released strains are commonly measured with mechanical or electri-

cal gauges. This method is more suitable when longitudinal stresses alone

are significant and allows the measurements of residual stress profiles accu-

rately, being largely used to evaluate residual stresses in steel and aluminum

structural components [10, 11].

Figure 2.3 – Sectioning method [8].

The recently developed Contour Method (Figure 2.4) is a full-field

technique that consists of cutting through the component cross section using

a wire electrical discharge machining, measuring the freshly cut surface

heights profile with a coordinate measuring machine or a laser profilometer.

The cut releases residual stresses that provoke deformations in the surface,

pulling inwards for tensile stress and bulging outwards for compressive

stress. The original residual stresses normal to the cut are determined using

finite element method to calculate the stress required to flat the deformed

surface. This novel technique great advantage is the residual stress 2D map

generation [8].



46 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

Figure 2.4 – Contour Method [8].

Non-destructive methods operating principle relies on the relation-

ship between physical or crystallographic parameters and residual stresses,

typically little or no material removal is necessary. However, some meth-

ods must need some "stress free" reference state and intact residual stress

that are hard to obtain with reliability. Depending on the technique, both

microscopic and macroscopic residual stresses can be inspected. The main

non-destructive techniques are: X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, ultra-

sonic and magnetic methods [2, 8]. Both magnetic and ultrasonic methods
can be used to measure all three types of residual stresses, however they

are not able to make a clear distinction between them [2].

Both diffraction methods are based on measuring lattice strains

that arise from modifications in the polycrystalline material interplanar

spacing and they can be used to study all three types of residual stresses

with high spatial resolution. While X-ray diffraction allows the residual

strains inspection on the material surface, neutron diffraction measures

residual strains within a volume of the specimen [2, 8].

Ultrasonic techniques use variations in the ultrasonic waves flight

time differences, and a relationship between the wave velocity in the medium



2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 47

and the residual stress state can be established. However, the flight time is not

only affected by stresses, but also by other microscopic characteristics such

as the grain size, presence of voids and other phases, crystallographic texture

and so on. These elements decrease measured residual stress accuracy and

makes this method suitable to very specific cases. It allows the measurements

in a few seconds within volumes of several cubic millimetres [2, 8].

Magnetic methods take advantage of the interaction between mag-

netisation and elastic strain in ferromagnetic materials. Among magnetic

methods, the most popular uses the Magnetic Barkhausen Noise, that con-

sists in the measurement of abrupt magnetic re-orientations number and

magnitude made by magnetic domains during magnetization reversal. The

application is limited to ferromagnetic materials, but measurements can

be performed in seconds with spatial resolutions smaller than a millimetre

[2, 8].

Even though non-destructive techniques seem to be the best option

to inspect in-service components due to their non-invasive approach, they

often require a delicate and expensive hardware that must be operated in

laboratory conditions, which makes them unsuitable to measure in harsh

environments.

Semi-destructive methods are a good compromise solution as they

avoid the component total destruction and provide information about greater

depths than non-destructive approaches. As said beforehand, the main semi-

destructive techniques are the Ring-Core Drilling and the Hole-Drilling

Method.

The Ring-Core Method consists of ring core drilling, typically 15–

150 mm internal diameter; the relieved strains are measured on the surface

inside the ring and allow the inspection depth range between 25–150% of

the internal diameter. Compared to the Hole-Drilling Method, the Ring-Core

Method presents higher sensitivity to the relieved strains and insensitivity

to minor diameter errors or eccentricity at the cost of more damage and

invasiveness to the structure [12].



48 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

Figure 2.5 – Main semi-destructive techniques: (a) Hole-Drilling Method
and (b) Ring-Core technique [8].

The Hole-Drilling Method is probably the most well-established

and largely used technique to measure residual stresses; it consists basically

in the stressed material local removal by drilling a hole, typically 1-4 mm

diameter, to a depth approximately equal to its diameter, followed by the

strain relief measurement in the adjacent material. Even though the relieved

strains decay quickly with their depth from the surface, this technique

allows a much more localized residual stress measurement than the Ring-

Core Method [12]. Further detail about the Hole-Drilling Method follows in
the forthcoming topic, due to its popularity and use in the residual stress

measurement device developed by LABMETRO/UFSC.

2.3 HOLE-DRILLING METHOD

The Hole-Drilling Method is based on the pioneering work of

Mathar [13] and since then has become the most widespread general-
purpose technique to measure residual stresses due to its relative simplicity,

low cost, versatility, compactness and consequent portability, being an effec-



2.3. Hole-Drilling Method 49

tive outside-lab solution [14]. Currently, this procedure is endorsed by the
ASTM E837 – 13a [3] and can deliver quickly reliable results of uniform
stresses in workpieces that have a thickness comparable to the tool diameter;

otherwise, if the workpiece thickness is much greater than the tool diameter,

both uniform stresses and non-uniform stresses can be obtained. In practice,

the method can provide satisfactory results if the residual stresses do not

exceed about 80% of the material yield stress when measuring a thick work-

piece, since a linear-elastic behaviour is assumpted [3]. Figure 2.6 shows a
schematic comparison between before and after the drilling, and the effect

in the surrounding material detected by the measuring technique.

Figure 2.6 – Schematic cross-sections around a hole drilled into tensile resid-
ual stresses (a) before hole drilling and (b) after hole drilling
[8].

For the application of the Hole-Drilling Method to determine resid-

ual stresses, the following assumptions are made: the material is elastic

and isotropic; the measured stresses are below the elastic limit of the ma-

terial; the stress normal to the surface component is negligible; in each

layer removed, the in-plane stress gradients are small; the shear forces are

negligible between layers and the hole bottom is flat [3, 15]. This method
is constituted by three main features: drilling process, strain measurement

and computational technique.

Conventionally, deformations are measured with strain gages, which

are being replaced by full-field optical techniques [8, 9]. Optical methods
present features that make their application for residual stress measure-

ments attractive: they are non-invasive techniques and allow for full-field



50 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

data obtained at high speeds. The former feature provides a measurement

that does not cause any deformation or damage to the specimen and avoids

demanding surface preparation; the latter feature regards the great amounts

of 2D data acquired at light speed that make possible complex residual stress

analyses [4, 5]. Particularly for the Hole-Drilling Method, Beghini et al. [16]
affirms that optical methods are more adequate than the strain gage meth-

ods if significant plastic effects are present since the whole strain field can

be measured. The most widespread optical techniques to measure residual

stresses are: ESPI, Moiré interferometry and digital image correlation [5];
the first technique will be detailed, since the investigation to be developed

by this work uses ESPI.

Figure 2.7 – Comparison between the full-field technique ESPI and strain
gage data [8].

The ESPI technique combines speckle interferometry with elec-

tronic detection and processing. The speckle effect results in a high contrast

fine-scale granular pattern characterized by the random distribution of scat-

tered light that arises when a rough surface is illuminated with laser light,

shown by Figure 2.8. This distribution is sensitive to changes in the illumi-

nation and observation geometry, rotation and diffuse surface displacement,

laser wavelength and medium refractive index. These features make speckle

suitable to measure rough surface out-of-plane and in-plane deformation

components, 3D shapes and surface displacements derivatives, since the

random distribution that characterises this pattern can be deterministically



2.3. Hole-Drilling Method 51

changed by displacements and rotations of the diffuse body that scatters

incident light [6]. This is possible because each speckle is ideally surrounded
by an unique combination of speckles, creating a particular signature for

each measured point.

Figure 2.8 – Typical speckle pattern [6].

ESPI allows displacement, deformation and vibration measure-

ments typically in fraction of micrometres. This technique enable the com-

parison between two non-simultaneous wave fronts generated by rough or

curved object two different states. An interferometric pattern arises from

these wave fronts interference, providing information about the change

(vibration, displacement or deformation) that the object experienced, as

illustrated in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.10 shows the steps to retrieve information

about the change the body suffered from this transformation recorded effect,

known as specklegram.

Figure 2.9 – Typical ESPI interferogram of residual stress relief and conse-
quent displacements around a drilled hole [17].



52 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement

Figure 2.10 – Steps to analyse ESPI interferograms [6].

This technique presents a 5–15% in-lab accuracy, but the test set-up

needs interferometric stability: a stiff assembly free of vibration and without

significant thermal gradients nearby, since the interferogram is extremely

sensitive to the slightest changes in its optical path [5].

Since mechanical stresses are virtually impossible to be measured

during operation, their quantification is made based on the relationship

between stresses and their consequent strains [6]. Strains arise also on the
material surface, making possible their measurement using either strain

gages or optical rosettes; in the Hole-Drilling Method, these measurement

techniques are sensitive to radial displacements ur . From ur , the principal

residual stresses ?1 and ?2 and their direction ? are obtained using the nu-

merical solution developed by Makino and Nelson (1994 apud Suterio[19],
2005) from Kirsch’s analytical solution in polar coordinates:

(2.3)

in which a? and b? are dimensionless calibration constants, almost material-

independent, that correspond to the relieved strains due to unit stress within

the hole depth. These calibration constants are geometric functions obtained

from finite element method calculations; the standard provides numerical

values for these coefficients according to the rosette type, hole depth and

diameter [3, 20].

There are two considerations concerning the drilling process that

must be taken into account: the produced hole quality and the additional

stresses that may be added by the machining process [14]. The drilled hole
features exert a strong influence on the measurement results. If the optical

system is not orthogonal to the hole, an error of 17% may be present in the

stress value result for a misalignment in the range of ± 15°; furthermore,
a circularity error in the order of 2% of the diameter may cause a 4.5%

error in the obtained stress value. In addition, the stresses introduced by

the drilling process should not surpass 3% of the measured residual stress

[21]. Thus, the importance of a meticulous drilling process for a successful
residual stress measurement is very clear; however, little attention has been

paid to the hole-drilling process, in which often the cutting tool and the

cutting parameters are poorly detailed.

3 MACHINING INDUCED RESIDUAL STRESSES

In this chapter, first a brief exposition about the drilling process

and the milling cutting tools is provided to understand the particularities

associated with the procedure proposed by ASTM E837 – 13a [3]. A sum-
mary about residual stresses introduced by machining processes closes the

literature review.

3.1 DRILLING

Drilling is a hole-making operation in which the cutting tool with

rotational motion enters the workpiece axially and cuts a hole. The hole-

making comprises an important family of machining processes, as illustrated

by Figure 3.1). Drilling operations produce about 60% of the chips and it is

the most time-consuming metal cutting operation, adding up to about 36%

of all machine hours [22].

Figure 3.1 – Examples of basic drilling operations [23].



56 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

3.1.1 Drilling regime

The prime parameters that constitute the solid drilling regime

(Figure 3.2) are the cutting speed and the cutting feed. In drilling, the

cutting speed vc [m/min] varies along the cutting edge, since the rotating
point linear velocity is proportional and perpendicular to the rotation radius.

The maximum vc obtained at the tool periphery is given by Eq. 3.1,

vc =
? · dd r · n

1000
(3.1)

where dd r [mm] is the drill diameter and n [rpm] is the rotational speed.
The depth of cut ap [mm] is half the drill diameter in solid drilling.

Figure 3.2 – Components of solid drilling regime [24].

The cutting feed f [mm] is defined as the distance in the feed
motion direction at which the drilling tool advances into the workpiece per

revolution. Feed rate vf [mm/min] is calculated

vf = f · n (3.2)



3.1. Drilling 57

The cut is defined by ISO 3002/3 standard as the layer of the
workpiece material to be removed by a single action of a cutting part. The

cut parameters for one cutting tooth are the nominal thickness of cut, the

nominal width of cut and the nominal cross-sectional area [24].

The nominal thickness h [mm] (also known as the uncut chip
thickness or chip load) is one of the most important parameters in any

machining process, because it significantly influences many other features

such as tool life, cutting forces and power, contact stresses on the tool-chip

interface, amount of plastic information of the layer being removed, among

others [25]. The parameter h is calculated as

h = fz sin
?
?p

2

?
(3.3)

where ?p [°] is the drilling tool point angle, while the nominal width of cut
or uncut chip width b [mm] is given by

b =
ap

sin(?p/2)
(3.4)

and finally, the nominal cross-sectional area or uncut chip cross-sectional

area AD [mm] is obtained by

AD = h · b (3.5)

Figure 3.3 shows the main forces developed during drilling. The

cutting forces Fc correspond to the circumferential components that act onto

the tool rake face at the cutting edge and their direction is perpendicular to

the lips projection in the plane normal to the drill axis; they are the most

important forces and arise from chip shearing. Thrust forces F f oppose

to the tool feed and have a direction parallel to the drill axis. Finally, the

passive forces Fp oppose to the tool radial motion into the workpiece and

have a direction parallel to the drill lips projections on the plane normal to

the drill axis [26, 27, 28].



58 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

Figure 3.3 – Forces in drilling [26].

3.2 MILLING

Milling principally refers to a machining process performed with a

rotating, multi-edge cutting tool which performs programmed feed move-

ments in almost all directions against a workpiece. This operation is very

efficient and versatile, allowing the production of prismatic, polyhedrical or

free-form shapes, as shown in Figure 3.4; in addition, it is an alternative to

produce holes, threads, cavities and surfaces that are traditionally obtained

by turning, drilling or tapping [22, 29].

The intermittent action of each cutting edge during material re-

moval is an important aspect inherent to all milling operations; each tooth

undergoes periodical impacts and thermal cycling due to the interrupted

nature of the cut. Each cutting edge cuts during less than half of a revolu-

tion of the tool, often only in very small fractions of the cycle, producing in

general small chips [22, 26, 28].



3.2. Milling 59

Figure 3.4 – Examples of milling operations [29].

Often, a distinction is made based on the milling direction. If the

workpiece feed direction is the same as that of the cutter rotation at the

area of cut, up-milling is being performed (Figure 3.5b); the milling cutter

enters the workpiece at null theoretical undeformed chip thickness, which

increases until the end of the cut. In this case, rubbing and burnishing effects

with friction, high temperatures and work-hardened surfaces are present.

Otherwise, when the feed direction of the workpiece is opposite to that of

the cutter rotation at the area of cut, the operation is called down-milling

(Figure 3.5a); the milling cutter enters the workpiece at the maximum

undeformed chip thickness and it will decrease to zero until the end of the

cut. The large chip thickness helps to keep lower burnishing effects, with

less heat and work-hardening [26, 29].

3.2.1 Milling cutting tools

Many different shapes of milling cutting tools are available for

different uses. The most popular are, by far, end mills and milling cutters,

shown in Figure 3.6. While milling cutters are often developed for a specific

purpose, end mills are versatile cutting tools that can be used for a variety

of applications (face milling, shoulder milling, slot milling, plunge milling,

profile milling, chamfering, threading and drilling, among others) due to

the wide range of diametrical sizes and design characteristics [29]. The
main geometrical parameters of an end mill are illustrated in Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.6 – Most common milling cutting tools: (a) Milling cutters and (b)
end mills [29].

The number of flutes is a significant parameter that should be taken

into account when selecting an end mill; two to four flutes end mills are the

most common types for small diameter tools, whereas larger diameter tools

may have six, eight or more flutes. The fewer the flutes, the more material

is removed with each tool rotations, making rougher cuts with greater chip

loads that prevent heat from building up. More flutes favours the creation

of smoother surface finish. Increasing the flute number improves flexural

rigidity due to higher cross-section area, but on the other hand decreases

the space for chip ejection [31, 32]. The number of flutes is related to an
important parameter, the feed per tooth fz [mm], defined as

fz =
vf

zc · n
(3.6)

where zc is the number of teeth in the cutter, which is equal to the number

of flutes in an end mill.

Among the geometric parameters (Figure 3.8), the most important

concerning machining induced residual stresses are clearance angle, rake

angle and tool edge radius. The clearance angle ? is the angle between the

workpiece surface and the tool flank, responsible for diminishing the friction

between these elements. If clearance angle is too small, the wedge does

not penetrate in the workpiece and the wear is intensified, making the tool

blunt precociously. If the clearance angle is too large, the tool mechanical

resistance is reduced and it may chip easily [23, 33].

The rake angle ? can be positive, null or negative, being the main

responsible for the metal cutting. The wedge stability strongly depends

on the rake angle magnitude. When the rake angle is very positive, lower

cutting and feed forces are required to produce chips, also better surface

finishing is achieved; however, it tends to produce a continuous chip and

the wedge becomes too fragile and susceptible to break. Negative rake angle

favours tool stability, but plastic deformation is increased, demanding higher

cutting forces and exposing the wedge to severe thermal loads [23, 33].



3.2. Milling 63

Figure 3.8 – Chip formation and tool geometric parameters [34].

The cutting edge radius ? (Figure 3.9) influences the separation

of the total uncut chip thickness h into two components, the actual uncut

chip thickness ta and the crushed layer thickness h1 caused by the round

part adjacent to the tool flank. When h/? ? 10, the cutting tool can be
considered perfectly sharp; otherwise, the material is significantly burnished

by the tool and the cutting edge radius influences must be taken into account

[33].

Figure 3.9 – Cutting edge radius and chip thickness [33].



64 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

3.3 CHIP FORMATION

During cutting processes, the chip formation consists of the cutting

edge penetration into the workpiece material, which suffers elastic and

plastic deformation until the maximum permissible material shear stress

is reached and the material begins to flow, forming a chip; it is worth

mentioning that the chip formation will take place if the minimum chip

thickness hm is surpassed [23].

A schematic representation of the chip formation (continuous chip,

for the sake of didactics) is shown in Figure 3.10 in which four zones

constitute a continuous plastic deformation. Simple shear provokes the

transition from the workpiece structure (a) to the chip structure (b). Small

deformations on the shear plane are able to produce material detachment

during machining of brittle materials, whereas in a material with higher

deformability the detachment begins in the front of the cutting edge in zone

(e). Great amounts of deformation in the surroundings of the rake face (c)

and the cut surface (d) arise from the combined action of tensile stresses,

perpendicular active pressure and high temperatures in the detachment

zone.

Figure 3.10 – Chip initiation [23].



3.3. Chip Formation 65

Depending on the stress direction and magnitude, the material

behaviour can be either tough or brittle; hence, chip formation mechanism

is strongly influenced by these variables. The stress direction is defined

by the tool normal rake angle, tool cutting edge angle and tool cutting

edge inclination, while the magnitude of a stress is affected by the cutting

speed, feed rate and depth of cut [23, 35]. Interactions between factors that
influences chip formation are summarised in Figure 3.11.

Figure 3.11 – Influences during chip formation [23].

The chip formation mechanisms that arise from this set of elements

are illustrated in Figure 3.12. Continuous chip formation occurs when an

evenly deformed material slides off along the rake face in temporally highly

uniform friction conditions (constant speed in a stationary flow) between the

chip and the tool, as a consequence of positive rake angles, low undeformed

chip thickness and an uniform, high ductility workpiece material [23, 35].

Lamellar chip formation is a continuous, periodic mechanism char-

acterized by an unevenly material deformation, in which the lamellae arise

from thermal or elastomechanical processes with a high formation fre-

quency in the kHz range that results in cleavages or concentrated shear



66 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

bands. Lamellar chips are often produced from highly ductile workpiece

materials with an increased strength, in particular at high cutting speeds

[23, 35].

Segmented chip formation is a discontinuous mechanism that

presents slightly connected elements that are separated in the shear plane

and fused immediately after; chip segments are characterized by signifi-

cant differences in the degree of deformation, occurring mostly by the use

of negative rake angles, lower cutting speeds and higher chip thickness

[23, 35].

Discontinuous chip formation occurs in materials with very brit-

tle properties or when predefined slide paths are present due to profuse

inhomogeneities; bits of the workpiece material are ripped up from the

bulk without significant deformation, consequently the freshly machined

workpiece surface is a result of these small breakages [23, 35].

Figure 3.12 – Chip formation mechanisms [35].



3.4. Size effect 67

3.4 SIZE EFFECT

Size effect occurs when the cutting edge radius becomes compara-

ble to the cutting thickness. With this configuration, cutting happens with a

highly negative rake angle and the proportion between the cutting thick-

ness and cutting edge radius determines the chip formation mechanism, as

shown by Figure 3.13. Chip will not be formed if the cutting thickness is

smaller than the minimum chip thickness; in this circumstance, the mate-

rial undergoes an elastic-plastic deformation known as ploughing, without

forming chips effectively. As the cutting thickness approaches and surpasses

the minimum chip thickness, ploughing decreases and chips are efficiently

produced [36, 37, 38, 39].

Figure 3.13 – Effect of the proportion between minimum chip thickness
[38].

The dramatic increase in specific cutting force during machining

with small cutting thickness happens due to the increasing specific shear

energy caused by ploughing and actual chip thickness accumulation, that

keeps building up until the material removal can take place [40].

Oliveira et al. [41] suggest that any minimum chip thickness can be
within 1/4 and 1/3 of the cutting edge radius, regardless of the workpiece
material. In processes dominated by size effect, chip formation with intermit-

tent nature may arise from the several revolutions made by the cutting tool

without properly forming a chip, which may overload tool bearings or bend

and even break the cutting tool [42, 43]. Determination of micromilling
cutting parameters cannot be based on conventional milling information

since size effect takes place concomitantly to the micro end mill low strength

[36].



68 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

3.5 MACHINING INDUCED RESIDUAL STRESSES

During metallic materials chip-forming machining process, elastic

and plastic deformations, lattice imperfection variations and heat produc-

tion occurs near the workpiece surface [44]. A large amount of the power
consumption is converted into heat in the cutting edge surroundings due to

frictional effects in the interface tool-workpiece and the plastic deformation

of material being removed [45].

Residual stresses are always originated from ihnomogeneous plastic

deformations and/or phase transformations associated to volume changes.
Plastic deformations due to forces perpendicular and parallel to the work-

piece surface favours the production of compressive residual stresses, while

plastic deformations due to local heating tends to generate tensile resid-

ual stresses; phase transformations can lead to the development of both

compressive and tensile residual stresses depending on the volume changes

and plastic deformations associated with [44]. Figure 3.14 explains the
formation of thermally and mechanically induced residual stresses, while

Figure 3.15 focuses on the chip-forming relationship with residual stresses.

Figure 3.14 – Residual stress formation mechanisms [23].

Heat generation influences strongly the cutting tool performance



3.5. Machining induced residual stresses 69

and is, concomitantly, a consequence of its characteristics. Furthermore, it

affects strongly the freshly cut work surface quality, the material proper-

ties and the residual stress state due to the severe temperature gradients

developed during the metal cutting [46]. On the other hand, the heat gen-
erated can be beneficial since it decreases the shear stress, facilitating the

chip formation and decreasing the plastic deformation in the workpiece.

Indeed, Sadat [47] showed that extension of the residual stresses beneath
the machined surface increases as the cutting speed decreases, which can

be explained by lower temperatures for lower cutting speeds.

Figure 3.15 – Classification of processes producing residual stresses during
chip-forming machining operations [44].

Brinksmeier et al. [48] presented a vast compilation comprising
residual stresses measurement and causes in many machining processes.

Particularly in milling, compressive residual stresses are found due to the

considerable plastic deformation associated with this process; furthermore,

higher feed rates and rotational speeds increase compressive stresses and

their penetration depth, which is also favoured by tool wear. Tool sharpness

strong influence in residual stress introduction was also noticed by Jang

et al. [49] in a study that analysed surface residual stresses through X-ray
diffraction in austenitic stainless steel turning and found mostly compressive

stresses. El-Khabeery and Fattouh [50] studied residual stresses caused by



70 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses

milling and concluded that residual stress reached highest values with

increasing feed rate, depth of cut and material resistance.

Particularly in the case of the hole drilling process for residual

stress measurement purposes, Flaman [51] compared the low-speed end
mill to the high-speed drill; it was observed that the high-speed-drilled hole,

when compared to the hole obtained by the low-speed end mill, presented

a much smoother and straighter sides (Figure 3.16), a much flatter and less

rounded bottom; in addition, the first technique resulted in smaller and

more equi-dimensional chip. In short, the high-speed drill provided a hole

with better characteristics to be used to measure residual stresses.

Later, Flaman and Herring (1985 apud Grant et al.[14], 2006)
studied four drilling techniques, comparing induced stresses, hole geometry

and controllability, portability and ease of use. The author concluded that

the drilling with low-speed modified end mill was the only inadequate

technique as high stresses were produced; the drilling with high-speed drill

was suitable for most materials, except extremely hard ones.

Figure 3.16 – Comparison of the low-speed end mill and the high-speed
drill [51].

Recently, Steinzig et al. [53] tested the Hole-Drilling Method us-
ing a two-flute end mill with 1.59 mm diameter, 3 mm/min feed rate and
rotational speeds within the range between 2,000 and 40,000 rpm. They

observed that chattering possibly caused inadequate holes when using rota-

tional speed below 10,000 rpm and above this limit repeatable residual stress



3.5. Machining induced residual stresses 71

measurements could be carried out, indicating that high-speed commonly

advised by the standard may not be necessarily required.

4 EXPERIMENTAL PLANNING

This chapter details the experimental planning used to achieve

the aims of this investigation. An explanation on the standardised drilling

process idiosyncrasies opens the chapter to provide understanding about

the choices that culminated in the final experimental design, followed by

a description about the materials and methods used in this study. Further

information in provided in an organic fashion to furnish understanding

about the chain of decisions taken during this work development.

4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE DRILLING PROBLEM

The drilling process recommended by ASTM E837 – 13a [3] should
be performed with an carbide inverted-cone dental burr or small carbide

end mill; in other words, this machining process is a boring operation

with drilling dynamics acting on a milling cutting tool. Besides, rotational

speeds must be in the range within 20,000 rpm and 400,000 rpm due

to the historical use of high-speed pneumatic turbines by many research

groups and companies to measure residual stresses through the Hole-Drilling

Method. Despite its widespread utilisation, these rotational speeds are often

much higher than the recommended values for this cutting tool material and

diameter [3, 54, 55]. Concerning the pneumatic turbine, another relevant
aspect is the air compressibility that restrains feed rates to very low values

to avoid stalling and unacceptable run-outs. Extremely low feed rates and

excessively high rotational speeds combination results in an unfavourable

chip formation, the minimum chip thickness is barely reached and the

process is dominated by burnishing instead of cutting due to ploughing

effects [42].

Concerning the ESPI use to measure strains from which residual

stress are calculated, an essential requirement is to free the reference surface

from any foreign body between measurement steps, including moisture,

chips, burrs, among others. This precaution is taken because these undesired



74 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

elements will provoke a change in the acquired image that is not related to

strain, leading to spurious data. For this reason, dry machining is obligatory.

Summarising briefly given the problem constraints, dry drilling is

performed with an end mill, using very high rotational speeds and fairly

low feed rates.

4.2 DRILLING TEST STAGES

Two drilling test stages were performed: screening tests and final

tests. Screening tests were drilling operations performed using two and four-

flute square end mills in the most difficult-to-machine workpiece among

the preselected materials to check technical viability and to reduce the

experimental matrix to the most suitable cutting parameters combinations

concerning machining aspects and how they relate to the Hole-Drilling

Method alongside ESPI application. Residual stress measurements were not

performed at this stage. From three rotational speeds and three feed rates,

this test outputs are the two best rotational speed and two best feed rates

to be used in the next stage. During this first analysis, particular attention

was paid to the following aspects:

• the resulting burr around the hole that may act as a noise source

in the phase map depending on its extent;

• the chip formation, that provide information about the plastic de-

formation the material is suffering, and consequently a qualitative

evidence about the residual stresses being introduced into the

workpiece;

• the chip form, since long and continuous chip may scratch the

measuring surface during the cutting tool rotation.

During the second stage in which the final tests were carried out,

residual stress measurements through the Hole-Drilling Method were per-

formed in three types of workpieces using the four cutting parameters

combination using two and four-flute square end mills. Further detail about

the cutting tools, workpiece and cutting parameters are provided in the next

sections.

4.3 WORKPIECES

Three different types of workpieces were used, which are materials

commonly used in the industry: AISI 304L austenitic stainless steel, AISI

1020 carbon steel and AA 6061 aluminium alloy. These materials were

acquired as flat sheets with 6.35 mm, 6.30 mm and 12.00 mm respectively

and their relevant physical properties are shown in Table 4.1.

The above-mentioned dimensions correspond to the case in which

the hole depth is much smaller when compared to the specimen thickness,

being denominated as thick workpieces by ASTM E837 – 13a [3]. The stan-
dard recommends that the minimum thickness should be 5.13 mm for a hole

diameter between 1.52 and 2.54 mm to measure uniform stresses in these

situations. These sheets were cut into 135 mm strips using plasma cutting;

afterwards, these strips were divided equally into 25 mm wide pieces using

a band saw. After the cutting process, these 25 mm wide and 135 mm long

specimens have undergone a heat treatment to relieve stresses from the

previous manufacturing processes in order to assess only the influence from

machining induced residual stress introduced by the hole drilling. Heat



76 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

treatment certificates can be found in Annex A. The preparation was con-

cluded by spraying the workpieces with a thin white paint layer to produce

a matte finish, since a non-reflective surface is desirable in ESPI technique

application. In Figure 4.1, workpieces ready to be drilled are shown.

Figure 4.1 – Workpieces after preparation [7].

Austenitic stainless steels, such as AISI 304L, are considered difficult-

to-machine materials due to their work-hardening tendencies, high tensile

strength, high ductility combined with poor thermal conductivity. High

cutting forces are developed during the machining process, accompanied

by intense heat generation around the cutting edge [57, 58]. In particular,
the combination of high strength and high ductility makes chip breaking a

difficult task, propitiating tool vibration that may cause a severe harm to

the cutting tool [59].

AISI 1020 is a plain low-carbon steel that consists principally in

ferrite, having small amounts of pearlite. Low-carbon steels undergo rapid

work-hardening, especially when clean [58]. Ferrite is easily cut and has
little contribution to tool wear, but favours built-up edge formation and poor

finishing. The main responsibles for tool wear when machining AISI 1020

are pearlite and oxide particles, that have higher hardness and can be very

abbrasive to the cutting tool. Nonetheless, plain carbon steels are almost

always easily machined than alloys steels of comparable carbon content and

hardness [60], having also a thermal conductivity three times higher than



4.4. Cutting parameters selection 77

the AISI 304L that removes heat from the cutting zone more efficiently.

AA 6061 is magnesium-silicon aluminium alloy with excellent cor-

rosion resistance that can be machined to a good finish in the cutting fluid

absence and are more machinable in the heat-treated tempers than in softer

annealed solutions, which are more prone to the built-up edge formation

because of melting from heat generation. High cutting speed has a benefi-

cial effect keeping the workpiece cool, as most of the heat generated in a

given rotation is removed with the freshly cut chip during the subsequent

rotation. Short diffusion times given by the aluminium alloy high thermal

conductivity also helps to dissipate heat from the cutting area [60].

4.4 CUTTING PARAMETERS SELECTION

Cutting parameters were selected having the following premises:

• take advantage of the decrease in the rotational speed allowed by

the last standard version, from 50,000 to 20,000 rpm;

• propose an evolution from the former MTRES process (0.1–0.2

mm/min feed rates and approximately 210,000 rpm rotational
speed), presenting lower rotational speeds, higher and yet moder-

ate feed rates to favour proper chip formation;

• choose rotational speeds within the operating range offered by

brushless motors without auxiliary fluid-based cooling subsystem,

as they constitute the most likely replacement for the pneumatic

turbine, considering that most devices reach 60,000 rpm and higher

rotational speeds are associated with decreasing torque.

Therefore, the following rotational speeds were chosen to per-

form screening tests: 10,000, 25,000 and 40,000 rpm. Even though 10,000

rpm is out of bounds, in a preliminary test it will be used to dig for any

improvements in association with the selected feed rates.

The selected feed rates were 1, 10 and 20 mm/min. The lower
feed rate, 1 mm/min, was chosen as an intermediary solution between the
current MTRES and the higher feed rates, which are two order of magnitudes



78 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

greater than those reached currently by the equipment.

4.5 CUTTING TOOL SELECTION

A major concern in the tool selection is the tool geometry, since

geometrical characteristics impact directly on machining performance: chip

flow, breakage and direction; cutting force components direction and mag-

nitude; machining productivity; tool life; sliding velocity at the tool-chip

interface; thermal energy and cutting edge temperature distributions; ma-

chining quality (surface integrity and machining induced residual stress),

and so forth [61, 62].

There are two types of cutting tools allowed by ASTM E837 – 13a:

carbide inverted-cone dental burrs or small carbide end mills, aiming to

produce a hole with cylindrical shape and flat bottom [3]. Since inverted-
cone dental burrs are designed to machine teeth, their performance may be

far from optimal during metal cutting.

Another feature that could be improved is to use a coated cutting

tool. Coatings are used in the machining industry is to improve the tribo-

logical condition at the cutting tool-chip and the cutting tool-workpiece

interfaces [25]. Choosing the right coating helps to minimize adhesion and
friction effects, and the thermal load in the tool is reduced by the small

heat penetration [63]. The use of coatings broadened the dry machining
operations range, enabled the use of higher rotational speeds and feed

rates, enhanced performance in high temperature environments such as

abrasive and difficult to machine materials [63, 64]. A comparison between
coatings used in cutting tools are provided in Table 4.2. Recapitulating

that dry machining is a requirement imposed by ESPI technique and high

rotational speeds are demanded by ASTM E837 – 13a [3], choosing TiAlN
that presents high oxidation temperatures seems a reasonable decision.

Taking into account the previous considerations, square end mills

with a 1.5 mm diameter were chosen. Two tools were selected: two-flute

and four-flute tungsten carbide square end mills, coated with TiAlN, which



4.5. Cutting tool selection 79

are shown in Figure 4.2.

cutting edge; on each cutting edge, geometric parameters tool nose radius

?, clearance angle ?, wedge angle ? and rake angle ? were measured in

50 parallel sections to the cutting speed vectors; measurement samples are

illustrated in Annex A. These results are presented in Table 4.3 and 4.4 with

4.6 DRILLING EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE

Hole drilling experiments were carried out at the SENAI Institute

for Innovation in Manufacturing Systems facilities on a 5-axis machining

center Hermle C42U (Figure 4.3). The spindle motor maximum rotational

speed is 18,000 rpm and the maximum feed rate is 60 m/min. Since the
minimum rotational speed allowed by the current standardised method

surpasses the machine tool maximum rotational speed, a Minitor SFIDA

MZ01 electrospindle that reaches 60,000 rpm was coupled to the system,

accompanied by the control pack Minitor SFIDA MT01CP.



4.6. Drilling experimental setup and procedure 81

Figure 4.3 – Machine tool overview.

4.6.1 First stage

During the first stage, dry drilling was performed without mea-

suring residual stresses and MTRES was not used. Nonetheless, drilling

operations were divided in ten increments, simulating the procedure to be

used at the second stage. Naturally, AISI 304L stainless steel was the chosen

material to perform screening tests due to the challenges its mechanical and

thermal properties pose to machining, using the worst case scenario to verify

the coupling between machine tool dynamics and cutting tool when drilling



82 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

the chosen cutting parameters. Another feature that was being tested is

whether the end mills would be capable of drilling multiple holes without

being severely worn to a prohibitive level culminating in tool breakage as

observed in the dental end mills currently used by MTRES [42].

Workpieces were fastened directly on the machining centre table

using strap clamps. Two new cutting tools were used, a four-flute square

end mill and a two-flute square end mill. Each cutting tool was used to test

all cutting parameters combinations shown in Table 4.5.

Each cutting tool was used to perform a single repetition for each

cutting parameters combination, totalising nine drilling operations for each

end mill. Holes were drilled in a row according to the longitudinal work-

piece direction, with a 10 mm distance between hole centres to prevent

any influences from the previous and next drilling sites. This experiment

workflow is given by 4.4.

4.6.2 Second stage

The experiment second stage consisted of machining induced resid-

ual stress measurements using the Hole-Drilling Method with ESPI in three

kinds of workpieces as already described. To measure stresses, MTRES was

employed. This device is composed by two independent subsystems: the

drilling module and the measurement module. The drilling module was

disassembled from the equipment, freeing the diameter socket in which this

subsystem is fixed (dimensions in Annex C). This way, the set composed by

cutting tool and electrospindle shank MZ01 – SK40 was able to dive into



84 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

the socket and drill the hole without colliding against the device, since a

clearance annulus having a 6 mm maximum distance between those parts

was possible given the electrospindle characteristics as specified in Annex

B. A schematic MTRES in-scale view and electrospindle positions during

measuring and drilling is provided in Figure 4.5.

Figure 4.5 – Drilling and measuring positions.

After positioning MTRES on the machine tool table and adjusting a

proper height, i.e. aligning the interferometer arms to have the same length,

a probe coordinate measurement was conducted to reference the socket

cylindrical surface. This referencing procedure was also performed on the

workpieces upper surface to find a plane that describes their heights to drill

the first step correct depth.

Workpieces were fixed as in the previous stage using strap clamps,

which were bolted as far as possible from the drilling points with the mini-

mum required torque to keep the specimen in place without introducing

undesired stresses into it. The workpiece lateral surface was propped against



4.6. Drilling experimental setup and procedure 85

a flat metal strip along which the specimen could slide forward to the next

drilling position, which preserved the same 10 mm spacing as the one used

in the previous stage. The metal strip was aligned perpendicularly to MTRES

linear guides using a set-square, yielding the disposition shown in Figure

4.6.

Figure 4.6 – Drilling experiments key elements mounted on the machine
tool table.

Each end mill was assigned to only one material and all the cutting

parameters according to the sequence shown in Table 4.6 were tested using

a single tool for all repetitions; test short nomenclatures are provided since

they were used to make clean plots in the next chapter. This sequence was

chosen based on the conventional machining knowledge that lower feed

rates are less aggressive than higher ones, since the most favourable chips

chosen in the previous stage seemed to be satisfactorily formed at least for

AISI 304L. However, clear distinction between chip formation regime due to

size effect was not easily discerned since there was evidence of a transition



86 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

between these two regimes during the preliminary tests.

Since the tool edge radius (9.3&lt;?&lt;17.7 µm) was much greater
than the feed per tooth (0.06&lt;fz&lt;0.40 µm), during the planned tests
the cutting edge would not experience the transition from sharp to blunt

condition, otherwise it would modify significantly the metal cutting regime.

Furthermore, drilling several holes with a single end mill and verifying that

the machining induced residual stresses were kept at satisfactory levels also

represent an improvement from the current MTRES state, as each dental

end mill is discarded after drilling only a single hole [7]. Three repetitions
were planned for all materials in each cutting parameters combination, but

due to tool breakage in the beginning of the final tests during AISI 304L

drilling only two repetitions were made for this material. Three repetitions

could be made during AISI 1020 and AA 6061 machining without replacing

the cutting tool.

Another care taken during the experiments concerned the reference

from the measuring area without contact after each drilling step prior to

the image acquisition. Cutting edges were similarly cleaned after each

increment. Figure 4.7 provides the step-by-step procedure followed during

the experiment.

4.7 TECHNIQUES AND ANALYSES

The forthcoming topics consist of information about the techniques

employed and the analyses that were derived from them during the devel-

opment of this work; the relationships between the experiments inputs and

outputs, techniques and their respective analyses are synthesized in Figure

4.8.

Figure 4.8 – Overview of analyses and techniques used in this work.

4.7.1 Analysis from the Hole-Drilling Method

In this work, uniform residual stresses evaluation were performed

using the Hole-Drilling Method as aforementioned. For this purpose, MTRES

measurement module, which is a double-illumination ESPI system to mea-

sure pure radial in-plane displacement fields that makes use of an axis-

symmetrical binary diffractive optical element (DOE) as a beam-splitting

grating (Figure 4.9). Further information about this system can be found in

[6, 65].

The assumption of an uniform stress field is based on the fact that

the workpieces have undergone a heat treatment to relieve prior manufac-

turing residual stresses before the hole drilling experiments. In addition,

uniform stress calculation can be done to find the representative size of a

residual stress field, being an average within the hole depth, weighted in

favour of the stresses that act near the measured surface [3]. Therefore, the



4.7. Techniques and analyses 89

uniform stress assumption to assess the drilling process overall effect on the

machining induced residual stress seems to be a reasonable approach. For

this reason, results are expressed in terms of the principal stresses ?1 and

?2. To assess the cutting parameters effects on machining induced residual

stresses, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted.

cross-section.

(b) Illumination principle

4.7.2 Analysis from microhardness testing

Microhardness testing was performed to analyse the drilling ef-

fect on the hole surroundings microstructure. Metallographic specimen

preparation was carried out prior to microhardness testing observing stan-

dardised guidelines from ASTM and ASM [66, 67]. The hole cross-section
was obtained with a metallographic cut-off machine which uses wet abrasive

cutting to impinge less damage than other sectioning techniques; afterwards,

specimens were hot mounted using a phenolic resin at 150°C and 14.7 MPa

during 10 minutes. Grinding and polishing steps are found in Table 4.7.

Microhardness measurements were made using a Shimadzu HMV-

2 microhardness tester at LABCONF/UFSC – Laboratório de Conformação
Mecânica following instructions from ISO 6507-1:2005 – Metallic materials

– Vickers hardness test – Part 1: Test method [68]. Due to the different ma-
terials behaviour, i.e. the extent of indentation influence is greater in softer

materials such as aluminium, two microhardness measurement schemes

were used. The hole wall dimensions allowed four hole wall indentations



90 Chapter 4. Experimental planning

and three hole bottom indentations in aluminium alloy (Figure 4.11), while

six hole wall indentations and five hole bottom indentations could be made

in both steels (Figure 4.10). Microhardness test loads and their application

times are provided in Table 4.8. In order to verify microhardness changes

around the hole, hole bottom and hole wall values were tested against the

base material values using a paired Welch t-test for unequal variances.

4.7.3 Analysis from scanning electron and optical microscopy

When a sample is exposed to an electron beam, various signals

are produced from the interactions between the atoms in the sample and

the incident electrons: this is scanning electron microscopy (SEM) basic

principle. Some examples of signals are secondary electrons, backscattered

electrons, characteristic X-rays, Auger electrons, and so forth; depending on

the signal nature, different types of information about the sample can be

obtained.

In this work, chips and burrs were visualised through secondary

electron imaging (SEI), since secondary electrons are low-energy electrons

generated near the surface and for this reason images produced from this

kind of signal provide information about the surface topography [69]. For
this purpose, a JEOL JSM-6390LV scanning electron microscope was used

at LCME/UFSC – Laboratório Central de Microscopia Eletrônica.

To look into the hole profile produced by the selected square end

mill and provide a comparison with the current drilling process, hole cross-

section micrographs were acquired with a LEICA DM 4000 M optical micro-

scope at LCM/UFSC – Laboratório de Caracterização Microestrutural. The
hole cross-section images were obtained in specimens properly prepared

and prior to microhardness measurements.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Results are grouped by workpiece material in order to provide

whole comprehension of the findings. For each material, the following

topics are investigated: chip formation, machining induced residual stress

and microhardness changes. As AISI 304L austenitic stainless steel was the

only material used in both stages, its section presents also a brief additional

discussion about the formed burr. The chapter is closed with a comparison

between hole geometries obtained with the square end mills and the dental

inverted-cone end mill currently employed by MTRES.

5.1 STAINLESS STEEL AISI 304L

5.1.1 Burr and chip formation

The first attribute to be analysed during the first stage was the

burr formation, to verify whether its size may pose a problem to the optical

technique. Figure 5.1 shows Polar software interface, used to process data

and calculate stresses, in which three areas can be discerned: the circle inside

red circumference is the hole, the annulus between the red circumference

and the blue inner circumference corresponds to the discarded area, while

the annulus between the blue inner and outer circumferences is the useful

area that actually provide information about strains and has its boundaries

defined by ASTM E837 – 13a [3] for type A strain gage.



94 Chapter 5. Results and discussion

Figure 5.1 – Measuring area and discarded area.

Burr formation was negligible for the optical technique utilisation,

since it was always restrained to a very thin area around the hole border,

having an extension of approximately 1 µm, as observed in Figure 5.2 and

5.3. Since the measuring inner boundary has about 2.20 mm and the drilled

holes have around 1.55 mm, burr formation does not seem to be a concern

to the optical measurement technique and for this reason this analysis were

not performed in the second stage for all workpiece materials. A similar

trend was already reported by Blödorn [7] for AA 6061, AISI 304L and AISI
1020, in which burrs were very small and do not interfere in the optical

measurement.

5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 97

Austenitic stainless steels present high plastic deformability due to

their face-centred cubic crystal lattice, which results in several slip systems.

This feature favours not only the built-up edge and gluing-points formation,

but it also contributes to the production of undesired ribbon and snarled

chips [23].

An overview comparison of the formed chips during AISI 304L

drilling using a two-flute end mill is provided in Figure 5.4. In fact, using a

two-flute end mill, snarled chips were formed using the lowest rotational

speed (10,000 rpm) for all feed rates. These snarled chips proved to be a very

prejudicial feature, as seen in Figure 5.2, where radial scratches can be seen

to the corresponding cutting parameters combinations. This can be better

understood seeing Figure 5.5, in which radial scratches caused by continuous

chips invaded the measuring area and provoked loss of correlation where

the strains are intenser, near the measuring perimeter inner boundary.

Using the lowest feed rate (1 mm/min), the most similar condition
to the one used currently by MTRES drilling module, unfavourable chip

formation was detected for all the rotational speeds: a very thin snarled

chip was formed, indicating that the minimum chip thickness was barely

surpassed. In addition, a powdery and irregular aspect was seen for higher

rotational speeds, similar to those chips reported by Blödorn [7]. Using 10
and 20 mm/min feed rates, two chip widths can be observed due to the two
asymmetrical cutting edges: the minor produced around 80 µm wide chips,

while the major cut approximately 450 µm wide chips. Particularly using

higher rotational speeds (25,000 and 40,000 rpm) associated to higher feed

rates (10 and 20 mm/min), chips seemed to be properly formed without
favouring continuous morphology due to smaller thickness that facilitated

chip breakage; these are desirable characteristics in the aimed application.

5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 99

Figure 5.5 – Radial scratches caused by continuous chip and their intrusion
in the measuring area.

In higher magnification (Figure 5.6), intense plastic deformation

can be seen for all rotational speeds at 1 mm/min. In contrast, for the higher
feed rates (10 and 20 mm/min) using all the rotational speeds, a regular chip
formation was reached possibly because the feed per tooth was greater than

the minimum chip thickness. This transition from favourable to unfavourable

chip formation occurs because plastic deformation process changes as the

uncut chip thickness and the grain size become comparable; when this

condition is reached, grain boundaries, impurities and crystal defects matter.

In this regime, shear energy increases as the uncut chip thickness gets thinner

[70]. Plus, the patterns observed when using vf =1 mm/min suggests that
the chip load in a single rotation was insufficient, therefore only after several

rotations as the feed advances the chip load was enough to form a chip;

meanwhile, the material suffered rubbing and work hardening as the end

mill rotates without metal cutting [71].

5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 101

On the other hand, long and snarled chips were barely observed

using a four-flute end mill, as the higher flute number favoured chip break-

age, and all conditions seem to provide a more favourable chip size, mostly

having a width about 250 µm, as seen in Figure 5.7. Nonetheless, fluctua-

tions in the drilling process may happen and long, continuous chip may also

be formed, as radial marks in Figure 5.3e indicates. Concerning the lowest

feed rate (1 mm/min), a similar tendency as the two-flute end mill towards
poor chip formation was observed for all rotational speeds, thin chips with

a fragile appearance were seen instead of the powdery aspect observed

for the two-flute end mill, worsening as the feed per tooth decreases with

increasing rotational speed. Looking at the chip upper surface in Figure

5.8 using the lowest feed rate, the same poor cutting process dominated

by intense plastic deformation observed with a two-flute end mill is seen.

However, examining the chip upper surface for all the other cutting param-

eters combinations, regular material layers arise and may indicate that the

minimum chip thickness is close to the feed per tooth.

Considering the chip size and form discussion for both cutting tools,

the highest feed rates (10 and 20 mm/min) and highest rotational speeds
(25,000 rpm and 40,000 rpm) were chosen, since they provided smaller

chip sizes without excessive plastic deformation.

5.1.2 Machining induced residual stress

During the first residual stresses measurements, two catastrophic

tool breakages took place while attempting to drill the first holes. For this

reason, it was established that only two repetitions would be made for

each cutting parameter combination during AISI 304L drilling. Snarled

chips were also formed by chance, despite eliminating the most favourable

cutting parameters for their inception, since the material nature is prone

to their production. For this reason, some points that delivered unreliable

data were eliminated and only a single point for those cutting parameters

combinations (b and B) was available to conduct this analysis and therefore

MTRES maximum error was used for these tests instead of sample standard

deviation. Collected data can be found in Table B.1 – Appendix B.

In Figures 5.9 and 5.10, maximum and minimum machining in-

duced residual stresses mean values are plotted for each cutting parameter

combination for both end mills types, accompanied by their sample standard

deviation whenever applicable; their values can be found in Tables 5.1 and

5.2. The sample standard deviation was plotted instead of the confidence

interval in order to focus on the data dispersion. Since the flute number

evidently exerts an influence on residual stress introduction, ANOVA was

applied separately to assess the rotational speed and feed rate effects for

each cutting tool.

Compressive stresses with higher magnitudes have been introduced

into the workpiece for almost all cutting parameters combinations, indi-

cating that intense plastic deformation occurred in the hole walls, possibly

associated with ploughing action that occurs with a protusion of the primary

deformation zone below the tool nose given by material adhesion [50]. In
addition, when uncut chip thickness drops below two times the tool edge

radius, cutting efficiency decays dramatically and chip is barely formed at

the cost of increased temperature, residual stresses and forces [72]. In this
case, this effect was very aggressive since the feed per tooth and tool edge

radius ratio was between 0.41% and 3.1%.

Feed rate seems to be the most important cutting parameter using

a four-flute end mill. The lowest machining residual stresses occurred when

drilling with a four-flute end mill using lower feed rate (10 mm/min) for
both rotational speeds. A possible explanation for this behaviour is an

equilibrium between thermal and mechanical contributions, since lower

feed rates mean higher interaction times between a rotating cutting tool

and the workpiece. Mechanical effects that tend to compressive stresses are

counterbalanced with higher heat generation which favours tensile stress.

In Figure 5.11, interaction plots show feed rate and rotational speed

effects on the maximum residual stress ?1 using a two-flute cutting tool,

while its ANOVA is presented in Table 5.3. Feed rate presented the strongest

source of variation, while non significant interaction and rotational speed

effects were noticed. Using vf = 20 mm/min and n= 25,000 rpm, absolute
residual stress values were less pronounced than using vf = 10 mm/min
and n= 40,000 rpm.

became more and more compressive for all rotational speeds.

Summarising the results about machining induced residual stresses

during AISI 304L drilling, the feed rate effect was by far the most significant

factor. Opposing trends were observed for two-flute and four-flute cutting

tools, since higher feed rate seemed to produce less residual stresses using

the two-flute end mill and more residual stresses with a four-flute end mill.

Using four-flute end mill, two plateaux could be discerned for each feed

rate, with little effect for rotational speed. This is in good agreement with

literature, as the feed rate was already pointed out as the most relevant

process by previous work and cutting speed exerted little effect in residual

stress introduction [73].



5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 111

Intense compressive residual stress fields are also associated with

strain hardening tendencies AISI 304L presents. Plus, Capello [74] affirms
that in general the level of residual stresses increases with increasing me-

chanical properties. Brinksmeier et al. [48] suggests that considerable plastic
deformation leads to compressive residual stresses, having the tool sharp-

ness has a major influence. Compressive residual stresses were also observed

during AISI 304 stainless steel turning by [49]. Given the feeds per tooth,
cutting edge radius and AISI 304L mechanical properties, the high magni-

tude machining induced residual stresses found for most conditions is an

expected result. The author believes that high speed machining may actually

bring some benefits in the case of alloys prone to intense work hardening

as AISI 304L, as the material resistance limits decrease with increasing

temperatures in the shearing zone.

5.1.3 Microhardness

Microhardness mean values were plotted with a 95% confidence

interval in Figure 5.15 and 5.16 using a two-flute end mill and a four-flute

end mill respectively; the Sample 0 correspond to the base material. Paired

Welch t-tests are presented in the Tables C.1, C.2, C.3 and C.4 and their

respective results are commented further.

Figure 5.16 – Drilling effect on AISI 304L hardness using a four-flute square
end mill.

In Table C.1, the drilling effect on the hole bottom microhard-

ness using a two-flute square end mill is analysed. The combinations vf =
10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm, vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm did
not produce significant changes in the hole bottom microhardness, while

for the other cutting parameters combinations the microstructure were

significantly changed.

Hole wall microhardness change using a two-flute square end mill

is investigated in Table C.2. The hole walls microhardness increased for all

the cutting parameters combinations, which endorses the highly compressive

residual stresses found in the previous section.

Using a four-flute square end mill, the hole bottom microhardness

suffered noticeable changes for most cutting parameters combinations,

except for the vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm, as seen in Table
C.3, which was also the one that presented less machining residual stress

introduction.

Table C.2 shows that significant changes in microhardness were

found for n = 25, 000 rpm, which are possibly associated with chip rubbing
and burnishing at higher rates against the hole walls, as the chip pockets

are smaller in a four-flute tool and their disposal becomes problematic.

Looking into an overall panorama, using a four-flute end mill



5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 113

provokes less changes in the hole wall microstructure than using a two-flute

end mill. However, no general trend was observed concerning the hole

bottom microhardness values for both cutting tools. A possible explanation

for this behaviour is the random built-up edges formation since AISI 304L

favours this condition, concomitant to the excessive material smearing in

the end mill centre, which happens in a more uncontrolled way since the

cutting tool is not properly designed for drilling operations.

Since Blödorn [7] observed that hole walls suffered microhardness
increases for all conditions tested and the present study found the same result

for the two-flute square end mill, the mechanical influence predominance

over the thermal effect is very clear, despite the low thermal conductivity

and heat generated from tool friction and plastic deformation that makes

the cutting zone reach high temperatures.

5.2 CARBON STEEL AISI 1020

5.2.1 Chip formation

Carbon steel AISI 1020 has two main constituents: ferrite and

perlite. Ferrite presents a tendency to form unfavourable chips such as

snarled and ribbon types due to its high deformability, being also prone to

adhesion and built-up edge formation. On the other hand, perlite reduces

adhesion and built-up edge formation tendencies, also helping to form more

favourable chip forms [23]. Since the main carbon steel components present
opposite effects, depending on their proportions good machining conditions

may be expected.

(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm

AISI 1020 drilling.



5.2. Carbon steel AISI 1020 115

AISI 1020 drilling employing a two-flute end mill produced the

chips shown in Figure 5.17. Using vf = 10 mm/min, very thin and therefore
fragile chips were formed for both rotational speeds, which is a desirable

feature because it facilitates chip breakage. Thicker chips were obviously

formed using vf = 20 mm/min, presenting wider widths (about 400 µm)
due to the larger cutting edge engagement. Using vf = 20 mm/min and
n = 25, 000 rpm, a more continuous chip was formed, but it still seems to
be very thin. Figure 5.18 shows in higher magnification that chip forma-

tion presented regular and periodic shear fronts, without excessive plastic

deformation for all the tested conditions.

Figure 5.19 – Chip comparison using a four-flute square end mill during
AISI 1020 drilling.

Four-flute square end mill produced narrow and small chips as seen

in Figure 5.19, with widths not greater than 70 µm. Using n = 40, 000 rpm,
narrower chips were noticeably formed. Figure 5.20 shows that similarly to

two-flute cutting tool utilisation, chip formation occurred in regular shear

fronts, but plastic deformation appears to be slightly worse in the chip

borders as the feed per tooth is half of those obtained by a two-flute end

mill. As commented previously, the cutting edge is not fully engaged in metal

cutting using these cutting parameters combinations; nevertheless, the small

portion that penetrates into the workpiece seems to be cutting satisfactorily

the material. For these reasons, these chips seem to be adequate both from

the machining point of view and ESPI utilisation.

5.2.2 Machining induced residual stress

Figures 5.21 and 5.22 show maximum and minimum machining

induced residual stresses mean values with their sample standard deviation

for both cutting tools. AISI 1020 drilling with a four-flute end mill clearly

introduces less machining induced residual stresses than using a two-flute

end mill for almost all cutting parameters combinations and have a slightly

tensile nature. In addition, their absolute values are considerably small,

which is the close to the desired solution when applying the Hole-Drilling

Method. Raw data are presented in Table B.2 – Appendix B. Machining

induced residual stresses mean values and sample standard deviation are

plotted in Tables 5.7 and 5.8.

Figure 5.23 shows interaction plots for maximum residual stress ?1
using a two-flute square end mill. Even though both feed rate and rotational

speed provoke changes in the amount of machining induced residual stresses,

the interaction between these two variables undoubtedly influences heavily

this process, as reported in Table 5.9. However, using vf =10 mm/min seems
to be a better choice as the absolutes values are close to zero using both

rotational speeds; a similar trend was also observed for minimum residual

stress ?2, as seen in Figure 5.24. Table 5.10 shows that interaction between

vf and n also produces heavier effects on machining induced residual stress

when compared to solely rotational speed, while feed rate did not exert

much influence.

Using a four-flute end mill, better results were obtained by the

combination of vf =10 mm/min and n = 25,000 rpm for maximum residual
stress ?1, since the measured values were closer to zero as seen in Figure

5.25. Figure 5.26 shows that very small minimum residual stress ?2 are

introduced, but lower values are reached using n = 25,000 rpm. ANOVA
presented in Tables 5.11 and 5.12 confirms the suspicion from Figure 5.21

and 5.22 that neither vf nor n impact on machining induced residual stresses

for the cutting parameters combinations tested. As mentioned before for

the AISI 304L case, higher mechanical properties result in higher residual

stress produced; comparing these two steels, this behaviour was observed.

Using a four-flute end mill, the hole bottom microhardness suf-

fered alteration solely using the combination vf = 20 mm/min and n =
25, 000 rpm; however, this is not a sure assertive since P-value was too close

to the significance level and the null hypothesis were barely rejected, as

seen in Table C.7. Only for the hole wall drilled with vf = 10 mm/min and
n = 40, 000 rpm microhardness values increased, according to Table C.8.

Following the same trend seen in machining induced residual stress

measurements in which little modification was introduced into the mi-

crostructure, microhardness values were barely changed when drilling AISI

1020 with a four-flute end mill. Particularly in the case in which the smaller

feed per tooth is reached (vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm), changes
in microhardness were recurrent for both cutting tools. Blödorn [7] found
decrease in microhardness on the hole surroundings for this material, sug-

gesting that the thermal load in the present process is much lower than those

achieved with MTRES due to much smaller rotational speeds, which results

in lower interaction times with a rotating cutting tool and heat generation

from frictional effects.



5.3. Aluminium alloy AA 6061 125

5.3 ALUMINIUM ALLOY AA 6061

5.3.1 Chip formation

Due to AA 6061 aluminium alloy composition, hard and brittle

silicon inclusions facilitate chip breakage. Aluminium alloys often present

more favourable chips the harder they are [23], for this reason AA 6061–T4
and AA 6061–T4 are known by their good machinability. However, workpiece

material is AA 6061–O corresponding to annealed condition, too soft and

for this reason chip formation may be problematic since this temper favours

built-up edge formation [58].

Figure 5.29 – Chip comparison using a two-flute square end mill during AA
6061 drilling.



126 Chapter 5. Results and discussion

Using a two-flute end mill, Figure 5.29 shows that AA 6061 chips

that are significantly thicker (around 100 µm) than those formed during

both steels machining. A viscous and irregular appearance was observed.

The stick-slip mechanism is crucial in the chip formation process since it

affects chip curl and the degree of plastic deformation [70]. This mechanism
is particularly influenced by the strong adhesion tendency presented by this

soft material, especially when in contact with a cutting edge with a grooved

surface finish. Figure 5.30 shows that for vf = 10 mm/min, chips present
more intense plastic deformation effects than using vf = 20 mm/min,
in which more organized layers were formed as the chip slips. Using vf =
20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm particularly, a lamellar pattern is observed.

Figure 5.31 shows chips formed using a four-flute end mill. Em-

ploying vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm, thicker structures that
barely resembles a chip were formed, while for vf = 20 mm/min there
are regions that present regular layers and others that seem to be melted

material agglomerates. These images suggest that the cutting parameters

combination tested are in a cutting regime transition range, microstructural

changes and process oscillations seem to exert great influence in chip for-

mation. Figure 5.32 suggests that vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm
produces a chip mostly by ploughing effects instead of proper metal cutting,

since this cutting parameter combination results in smaller feed per tooth

than the other cases, that seem to generate more regular shear fronts.

stress measurements can be found in Table B.3 – Appendix B. Four-flute end

mill performed better than two-flute end mill for most cutting parameters

combinations, reaching lower residual stress absolute values and sample

standard deviations. Machining induced residual stresses mean values and

A contrary trend is perceived when hole drilling is performed with a

four-flute end mill (Figure 5.37), as lower maximum residual stresses ?1 can

be achieved with vf = 20 mm/min or n = 40, 000 mm/min. For this case,
feed rates also impact significantly on the residual stress ?1 introduction,

from ANOVA analysis in Table 5.17. The same behaviour was detected in

Figure 5.38 and Table 5.18 for minimum residual stresses ?2.

Tensile machining induced residual stresses were found for both

cutting tools, indicating the thermal load predominance over the mechanical

effects, since low energies are required to shear soft metals. This behaviour

is in good agreement with literature, since tensile residual stresses in 7075

aluminium alloy high-speed milling was already reported by Tang et al. [75]
using a worn cutting tool. Even if a new cutting tool was used during this

experiment, the end mill can be considered dull since the first drilling given

the ratio between fz and ? as aforementioned.

5.3.3 Microhardness

During the microhardness measurements in aluminium alloy AA

6061 samples, the bulk material microhardness differed from workpiece to

workpiece. To keep a fair comparison, each hole microhardness value was

compared to bulk material microhardness value for the same workpiece.

Microhardness mean values were plotted with a 95% confidence interval in

Figure 5.39 and 5.40.

Figure 5.40 – Drilling effect on AA 6061 hardness using a four-flute square
end mill.

In Table C.9 the effect of the drilling using a two-flute end mill on

the hole bottom microhardness is analysed. Drilling using the lowest feed

rates (vf = 10 mm/min) provoked an increase in the hole bottom micro-
hardness; H0 was not tightly rejected for both cases at ?= 0.05 level. On
the other hand, drilling performed with higher feed rates (vf = 20 mm/min)
barely affected the hole bottom microhardness; strong evidences of this fact

are provided by the high P-values found.

Hole wall microhardness values were not significantly changed

by the drilling using a two-flute end mill in all the tested combination of

parameters, as shown in Table C.10. High P-values obtained for this set

of tests indicate weak evidence that the metal cutting introduced severe

non-homogeneities into the hole wall. Heat generation was not intense



136 Chapter 5. Results and discussion

since microhardness values did not suffer a noticeable decrease, which is

a reasonable outcome since the energy consumed to machine aluminium

alloys are relatively low when compared to other metals. Even though ASTM

E837 – 13a [3] expresses a concern about the rubbing between the hole
wall and a square end mill peripheral cutting edges, low friction between

cutting tool and workpiece can also be deduced from this result, indicating a

favourable combination of cutting tool coating and workpiece material; thus,

the utilisation of an inverted-cone end mill to avoid unnecessary rubbing as

recommended by the standard may not bring much benefit over a properly

selected square end mill.

As seen in Table C.11, the hole bottom microhardness values were

not strongly affected by drilling for almost all cases (vf = 10 mm/min and
n = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min
and n = 40, 000 rpm). It is worth mentioning that H0 could be barely
rejected in vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm at ? = 0.05, since the
P-value was 0.047; i.e. there is not strong evidence to assert that the drilling

is producing a significant change in the hole bottom microhardness for this

condition.

In Table C.12, a similar trend is observed in the hole wall mi-

crohardness for the following cutting conditions: vf = 10 mm/min and
n = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min
and n = 25, 000 rpm, in which the drilling seems to exert little influence in
the surrounding microstructure. However, for the case vf = 20 mm/min and
n = 40, 000 rpm, the hole wall microhardness value increased significantly,
indicating a work hardening. A possible explanation is the chip adhesion

on the cutting tool surface that may have happened during this drilling

operation, in a way that the material was smeared against the hole wall

since chip disposal becomes more problematic with increasing flute number.

Summarising briefly, aluminium alloy AA 6061 drilling produced

minor changes in the hole surroundings microhardness for both two-flute

and four-flute end mills, indicating that the microstructure was not strongly

disturbed by the metal cutting process; this outcome corroborates the small



5.3. Aluminium alloy AA 6061 137

machining induced residual stresses measured, as explored in the previous

section, and denotes a good choice of cutting tool and cutting parameters for

HDM residual stress measurement purposes in this type of material. During

AA 6061 drilling, Blödorn [7] reported a decrease in the hole surroundings
microhardness, i.e. the temperature rise was excessive despite the material

high thermal diffusivity that dissipates heat quickly. For this reason, the

process seems to be less aggressive than the used by MTRES also for this

material.

5.4 HOLE GEOMETRY

Figure 5.41 presents a comparison on the same scale between the

hole cross-sectional profile obtained when drilling all tested materials with

the 1.6 mm inverted-cone dental end mill currently employed by MTRES

and the selected square end mills. All holes are 1 mm deep, as advised by

the standard [3].

Figure 5.41 – Hole profiles comparison.

Clearly, square end mills generate a geometry closer to the ideal

cylindrical profile suggested by ASTM E837 since they do not present the



5.4. Hole geometry 139

chamfer. This element was introduced in the inverted-cone dental end

mill design to increase tool tip robustness. Even with the chamfer, tool tip

breakage was often reported using the inverted-cone dental end mill [7, 42].

When using this inverted-cone end mill, residual stress calculations

may present significant errors if correction coefficients in the computational

model are not properly adjusted to this complex geometry, since the chamfer

size is comparable to a drilling step and changes significantly the stress

relief distribution. Sharper corners were obtained using the square end mills,

which have a radius much smaller than the drilling steps and therefore

standardized correction coefficients could be used without introducing

significant errors.

Another important influence that contributed to the obtained hole

geometries is the machine tool. Even though the employed end mills differ

only 0.1 mm in diameter, the hole diameters obtained with MTRES clearly

are at least 0.2 mm wider. The pneumatic turbine use associated with low

rigidity bearings may have provoked significant run-outs. Certainly, these

features must be improved in the new MTRES drilling module design and

will also help to avoid constant tool breakages.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this chapter, the main conclusions drawn from this work are

summarized and ideas for further works are pointed out.

6.1 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, cutting tools and cutting parameters combinations

were selected and tested concerning the Hole-Drilling Method application

with ESPI to measure displacements both from machining and metrological

perspectives. Feed rate and rotational speed effects on machining induced

residual stresses and microhardness were investigated in three types of

material.

During preliminary tests, snarled chips were formed in AISI 304L

drilling using n = 10,000 rpm at all feed rates, and for this reason this
rotational speed was not used further. This continuous chip proved to be ex-

tremely prejudicial to the interferogram data reliability, since the reference

surface was scratched during the end mill rotation. Hence, cutting param-

eters that favour continuous chip formation should be avoided whenever

ESPI is being used to measure strains. Powdery or too thin chips associated

with poor metal cutting process were observed when using vf =1 mm/min,
being also eliminated from the final tests. Burr formation do not pose a

problem to the optical measuring process, since the burr is very small and

the useful measuring area is far from it.

The combination of workpiece material, cutting tool geometry, cut-

ting tool coating and cutting parameters during stainless steel AISI 304L dry

drilling provoked an intense compressive stress state, inadequate to residual

stress measurement purposes for most tested parameters, except for vf =10
mm/min and n = 25,000 rpm, which resulted in a machining induced
maximum residual stress ?1 = 4±10 MPa. Microhardness values increased
in almost all the cases when this property experienced significant change,



142 Chapter 6. Conclusions

which means that the plastic deformation is the predominant effect over

heating from frictional effects; this is in good agreement with compressive

residual stresses found in most conditions, which may be explained by the

AISI 304L tendency to work hardening.

Favourable chips were formed during AISI 1020 drilling, presenting

small sizes and being properly cut as the chip upper surface presented

regularly formed shear fronts, however the vf =20 mm/min and n = 25,000
rpm using a two-flute end mill seemed to favour the undesired continuous

chip formation. Using a four-flute cutting tool, smaller and narrower chips

were obtained, being possibly the preferred option since chip removal by

suction would be easier; besides, low machining induced residual stresses

were observed for all cutting parameters combinations, in particular using

vf =10 mm/min and n = 25,000 rpm that resulted in a machining induced
maximum residual stress ?1 = 6±14 MPa. Another good combination was
vf =10 mm/min and n = 40,000 rpm using a two-flute end mill, that yielded
?1 = 4±14 MPa. As in AISI 304L steel, microhardness values increased with
drilling in almost all the conditions this property was significantly altered.

When drilling AA 6061, minimum chip thickness is likely within

the tested feed per tooth range, as two chip upper surface patterns were

clearly distinguished. Even though AA 6061 chips seemed to be intensely

deformed, it may be a consequence of how material softness, low melting

temperature and its tendency to adhere on the cutting tool surface affects

the stick-slip mechanism, as the chip is removed from the cutting area at

lower rates than it is produced. In general, four-flute square end mills overall

performance was better than those of two-flute square end mills; while the

former presented lower machining induced residual stresses absolute values

and low data dispersion, the latter presented greater data scattering and

introduced higher stress levels. A machining induced maximum residual

stress ?1 = 8±2 MPa obtained with vf =20 mm/min and n = 40,000 rpm
seemed to be the best solution for AA 6061. Microhardness values were

mostly unaffected by drilling and increased in all instances a significant

modification was spotted.



6.1. Conclusions 143

The main outputs of this work are shown in Table 6.1, in which

the recommended solutions and their characteristics are summarised.

Another important remark is that residual stress measurements

presented low sample standard deviation, despite having only few available

samples. This result may be attributed to the machine tool high rigidity, and

also indicates that the end mill used in this work can properly drill several

holes without suffering aggressive tool wear that would justify the frequent

replacement by a new cutting tool.

The microhardness increases in almost all samples suggest that the

thermal effect on the microstructure due to high rotational speeds was lesser

than the plastic deformation influence likely related to the chip burnishing

against the hole surfaces.

Hole geometries obtained with the selected square end mills were

compared to the inverted-cone end mills currently employed by MTRES.

The new cutting tool produces a hole geometry closer to the ideal geometry

suggested by ASTM E837 – 13a. Evidence shows that MTRES drilling module

rigidity is an attribute to be improved.



144 Chapter 6. Conclusions

No general trend or rule of thumb can be given for the tested mate-

rials regarding both machining induced residual stresses and microhardness

change, since the author believes that the cutting parameters combinations

were in the transition from micromachining to macromachining; in this gray

zone range, phenomena are not well-delineated. Nonetheless, feed rate was

highlighted in many ANOVA analyses as the most important factor concern-

ing machining induced residual stress within the tested cutting parameters

range.

Among the cutting tool and cutting parameters combinations, some

conditions introduced low machining induced residual stresses into the

workpieces material and can be incorporated in a future MTRES version.

With this improvement, errors associated to the drilling process can be

minimized during a real residual stress evaluation.

6.2 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

Further work is yet to be done in the following aspects, regarding

the Hole-Drilling Method context:

• decrease even more the allowed rotational speed, to reach values

recommended by machining literature and verify whether a less

retroactive residual stress measurement is possible;

• include recommendations also about the feed rates, instead of only

informing the cutting tool types and the rotational speed;

• use a proper tool to perform a drilling operation and change the

standardised coefficients accordingly.

Concerning MTRES design, the proposed improvements are:

• design and validate an electrical drill using a brushless motor for

better rotational speed control in a closed-loop;

• implement the cutting parameters and cutting tool used in the

present work;

• study the cutting tool effect using the dental inverted-cone end

mill currently used in MTRES, under the same cutting conditions



6.2. Suggestions for future work 145

explored by this work;

• investigate tool wear evolution using a single end mill to drill

using only one cutting parameter combination with the purpose of

establishing the tool life that can be achieved with the proposed

drilling process;

• provide a more stable, smoother and continuous feed replacing

the stepper motor with a sliding linear motor, such as ball screws

actuators;

• replace the dental turbine assembly in which only dental burrs fit

with a chuck compatible with drills for metal cutting to make the

drilling module more versatile;

• improve the drilling module rigidity;

• test API grade steels that are actually used in the oil and gas industry

as workpiece material.
