ABSTRACT

The internal surfaces of aluminum tubes, both unlined and lined with epoxy resin, which are used for
packaged medicines such as creams, ointments, gels, etc., were evaluated chemically, and microbiologically
with regard to microorganism adherence. Proof of porosity of the unlined aluminum surface and lined with
epoxy resin, and the resistance to removal of the resin were observed using a scanning electron microscope
and a stereoscope, with a digitalized image system. To evaluate the microorganisms adherence to the
aluminum surface, unlined and lined with epoxy resin, sterilized disks (10mm in diameter) were immersed in
Mueller Hinton Broth and placed in tubes of polypropylene with screw caps. The liquid culture medium
was then inoculated with suspensions (109CFU/ml) of the following microorganisms: Streptococcus
agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida albicans and incubated at 37°C
under constant agitation (100rpm) for 12 days. The culture broth was changed every 3 days, after which the
disks were removed, and observed under the scanning electron microscope. Microscopic observations
revealed adherence of the microorganisms and biofilm on the aluminum surfaces both unlined and lined
with epoxy resin.

Key words: Microbial adherence, biofilm, biofouling, aluminum packaging.

INTRODUCTION

The benefical or non-benefical effects of the microorganisms
on surfaces have been known for centuries. Guy de Chaulic
first noted the effects of foreign bodies on the subsequent
healing of wounds in the 14th century A. D.. The first detailed
description of microbial adherence on surfaces was made by
Zobell (19) and in 1970 the word biofilm was introduced into the
scientific literature (9). Biofilms are defined as an accumulation
of cells immobilized on a substratum in a matrix of extracellular
polysaccharides of microbial origin (5).

The effects of microorganisms on surfaces is now almost
universally accepted. There are many different types of surfaces
preferred by microbes (9). The presence of biofilm on a surface
can have many different types of effects, i.e. in the field of

health where the quality of water is extremely important in
industrial processing (9).

One of the detrimental effects of biofilms is that they can cause
tooth decay, biocorrosion on metallic surfaces, and contamination
of industrialized food and pharmaceutical products (3).

Walker et al. (18) concluded that no surface could be
considered microbiologically clean. Microorganisms are present
in water even in low numbers and can use a solid interface as a
substratum for colonization. Lucas et al. (12) warned against the
use of aluminum tubes as containers for medicines because of
possible alterations, and Martindale (13) observed that on the
aluminum lid used in containers for liquid medicines with sugar, a
black polysaccharide formed. In 1988 Pozetti (16) observed that
medicines in the form of gel could suffer alterations when
packaged in aluminum tubes lined with epoxy resin.

According to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (1)
in RDC n° 33/2000, under the item “Labelling and Packaging”,
recipients for hand made medicines should guaranty physical
and chemical properties, and microbiological stability. Tubes
used in pharmaceutical packaging are usually made of 99.5%
commercialy pure aluminum plus secondary substances such
as ferric oxide, silicium, and titanium (16). The aluminum forms a
passive layer of oxide on the surface, and as a consequence
improves resistance to corrosion (7).

The aluminum used to produce tubes for pharmaceutical
packaging have a smooth surface resulting from cold process
lamination varying in thickness from 0.00635 to 0.200mm and
possessing special characteristics resistant to destruction of
the lining, toxicity, and porosity (2).

The objective of the present study was to evaluate, using
chemical and microbiological methods, the behavior of
commercially pure aluminum surfaces, both unlined and lined
with epoxy resin to be used in the manufacture of tubes for the
packaging of medicines for external use in alopathic,
homeopathic or phitotherapic medicine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Commercially pure aluminum unlined
To evaluate the porosity of the unlined aluminum surface,

rectangular pieces of different sizes, were cut from unlined
aluminum tubes before being filled with medicines, and then
submitted to the action of a 5% (p/v) solution of mercury
chloride for 5 minutes, according to CBE-Bandeirante de
Embalagens Ltda (4).

Commercially pure aluminum lined with epoxy resin
To test the porosity of the epoxy resin lining the aluminum

surface and the resistance to removal of the lining, rectangles
of different sizes were cut from aluminum tubes lined with epoxy
resin ready to receive the medicines. The samples were submitted
to the action of a solution of 20% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide
for 3 hours, followed by friction with cotton swabs for lining
removal, according to instructions of CBE-Bandeirante de
Embalagens Ltda (4).

Microbiological Evaluation
For microbiological evalutions of the unlined and lined

aluminum surface with epoxy resin, disks of 10mm in diameter,
were cut from the same tubes above mentioned.

The microorganisms Streptococcus agalactiae ,
Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter lwoffii were
cultivated in Blood Agar and Candida albicans were cultivated
in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, all mediums used were from Difco
(10). These microorganisms were chosen because they are
isolated with facility from biological and industrial environments.
Suspensions were made in a Brain Heart Infusion and incubated

at 37°C until an optical density of 1.0 (540nm) was reached;
200µl of each cellular suspension (109UFC/ml) was used to
inoculate 15ml of Mueller Hinton Broth. The metallic samples
were autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. and placed in 50ml
polypropylene tubes [Corning] (8), containing 15ml of inoculated
Mueller Hinton Broth, and incubated at 37°C under constant
agitation of 100 revolutions per minute. The culture medium
was changed every 3 days at 12 day intervals. After which the
samples were removed from the liquid culture medium, prepared
and examined using the scanning electron microscope (15).

Electron Microscope Procedures
The samples were immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M

phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) to fix the microorganisms, dehydrated
in aqueous solutions of ethanol (15, 30, 50, 70, 95 and 100%) for
15 min. each one, and dried in a centrifuge under vacuum, then
coated with gold and examined under the scanning electron
microscope JEOL-JSM [T330A] (15).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Samples of aluminum unlined and lined with epoxy resin,
obtained from tubes used for packaging medicines, were
submitted to chemical evaluation with regard to the porosity.
The surface observed macroscopically showed the formation
of an amalgam of aluminum on the epoxy resin lined surface,
after treatment with 5% HgCl2. A chemical reaction was
observed because the surface lined with epoxy resin was shown
to be porous. The mercury chloride had reacted with the
aluminum producing an alloy of mercury and aluminum easily
observed. As a control aluminum samples without lining were
used. According to the literature, porosity can be an undesirable
factor, as the pores lead to stress and diminish mechanical
resistence (14).

Regarding the proof of resistance to removal of the lining, a
parcial removal of the resin was observed after an aluminum
surface treatment with 20% ammonium hydroxide and friction
with cotton swabs. This proof is used in order to verify the
resin adherence on the aluminum surface.

In the present study, the physical surface of aluminum lined
with epoxy resin was observed using the Leica (MZ12)
stereoscope microscope showing an invasion of the external
lining as well as flaws in the internal lining. Sharp points of
aluminum and flaws in application of the resin were also noted,
according to Pozetti (17).

The tubes of aluminum used in pharmaceutical packaging
can at times show defects such as: internal or external dirt, foreign
bodies, or deformed tubes, extremities of tubes either deformed
or torn; breaks in the body of the tube when pressed, and other
defects in production. On the internal lining following alterations
can occur: high porosity, low adherence or elasticity of the resin,
high solubility in acetone; low resistance to ammonia and acetic

acid; the resin can also be rough, and non uniform. The interior
resin could be contaminated by the exterior coating, and thus
transfer particles of grease or oil into the product, according to
CBE- Bandeirante de Embalagens Ltda. (4).

Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on a commercially
pure aluminum surface, lined with epoxy resin, was observed
after samples incubation in Mueller Hinton Broth inoculated
with Streptococcus agalactiae (Fig. 1), Candida albicans (Fig.
2), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 3), and on an unlined surface,
Acinetobacter lwoffii (Fig.4), Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 5)
and Candida albicans (Fig. 6).

The microbiological evaluations observed using scanning
electron microscope showed that the surface lined with epoxy
resin, attracted a microbial colonization (Figs 1-3) and also,
according to Montanaro, Arciola (14), and Pizzolitto et al. (15),
the microorganisms seemed to have a preference for irregular or
porous surfaces. These types of surfaces furnish niches in
which the microorganisms can attract, stick to, and grow in
microcolonies forming biofilms. It was also observed there was
a microbial adherence on unlined aluminum surfaces (Figs. 4-6).
Our results coincide with those of other researcher (12) who
disapprove the use of aluminum tubes even those which are
lined, due the fact that the contents prepared using plants such
as hamamelis, aromatic chamomile, eucalyptus, etc., are
incompatible with metallic salts, including those of aluminum.
Aluminum can also form inumerous complexes of all the groups,
both soluble and insoluble. Aluminum can precipitate Ag, Cu,
Hg, Sn, Sb, Cd, etc., by reduction (6). According to Lucas (12)
aluminum is incompatible with mercury salts, and in general

with alkalis, alkaline carbonates, acid and acids salts in general.
In reference to tubes manufactured using aluminum lined with
epoxy resin Clark et al. (7) observed that this resin is incompatible
with vegetable oils, gums, resins, and cellulosic polymer. Pozetti
(17) recommended that the metallic tubes should not be used as
recipients for products used in oral hygiene, homeopathic,

alopathic and phitotherapic medicines. According to Ferreira
(11) pharmaceutical packaging should be clean, and non interact
physically or chemically with the contents. The quality and
purity of the preparation, must be preserved and should be
paint resistant, protecting the contents from the action of light,
as well as being tightly closed to avoid external contamination.

Our results showed that aluminum both unlined and lined with
epoxy resin used for packaging pharmaceutical products permit
microbial adherence.
