SUMMARY

Palm swanp formations, the so-called veredas, typically occur in the Brazilian
biome known as “Cerrado” (savanna-like vegetation), especially on flattened areas
or tablelands (chapadas). The aim of this study was to characterize the mineralogy
and micromorphology of soil materials from a representative toposequence of the
watershed of the vereda Lagoa do Leandro, located in Minas Novas, state of Minas
Gerais, Brazil, on plains in the region of the upper Jequitinhonha valley, emphasizing
essential aspects of their genesis and landscape evolution. The toposequence is
underlain by rocks of the Macaúbas group and covered with detrital and
metamorphic rocks (schists of Proterozoic diamictites). The soil profiles were
first pedologically described; samples of the disturbed and undisturbed soils were
collected from all horizons for further micromorphological and mineralogical
analyses. The mineralogical analysis was mainly based on powder X ray
diffractometry (XRD) and micromorphological descriptions of thin sections under
a petrographic microscope. The soils from the bottom to the top of this
toposequence were classified as: Typic Albaquult (GXbd), Xanthic Haplustox, gray
color, here called “Gray Haplustox” (“LAC”), Xanthic Haplustox (LA) and Typic
Haplustox (LVA). The clay mineralogy of all soils was found to be dominated by
kaolinite. In soil of LA and LVA, the occurrence of goethite, gibbsite, and anatase
was evidenced; “LAC” also contained anatase and the GXbd, illite, anatase, and
traces of vermiculite. The micromorphological analyses of the LVA, LA and “LAC”
soils showed the prevalence of a microaggregate-like or granular microstructure,

RESUMO:     CHAPADAS DO ALTO VALE DO JEQUITINHONHA, MG. II –
MINERALOGIA, MICROMORFOLOGIA E EVOLUÇÃO DA
PAISAGEM

As veredas são formações típicas que ocorrem no Cerrado brasileiro, principalmente nas
áreas aplainadas denominadas chapadas. O objetivo deste trabalho foi caracterizar
mineralógica e micromorfologicamente os solos de uma topossequência representativa da
microbacia da Vereda Lagoa do Leandro, localizada no município de Minas Novas - MG,
situada nas chapadas do Alto Vale do Jequitinhonha, enfatizando aspectos de suas gêneses e
da evolução da paisagem. A topossequência está embasada em rochas do Grupo Macaúbas,
com cobertura detrítica e rochas metamórficas (xistos diamictitos do Proterozoico). Os solos
foram descritos em trincheiras, e amostras deformadas e indeformadas foram coletadas em
todos os horizontes, para análises mineralógicas e micromorfológicas. As análises mineralógicas
da fração argila foram determinadas pela técnica de difração de raios X (DRX), e as
micromorfológicas, por descrições de lâminas delgadas em microscópio petrográfico. Os solos
caracterizados da base da vereda para o topo foram Gleissolo Háplico (GXbd), Latossolo
Amarelo, de cor cinzenta, aqui denominado “Latossolo Acinzentado” (“LAC”), Latossolo Amarelo
(LA) e Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo (LVA). A mineralogia da fração argila em todos os solos é
dominada pela caulinita. Nos LVA e LA foram identificadas goethita, gibbsita e anatásio; no
“LAC”, anatásio; e no GXbd, ilita, anatásio e traços de vermiculita. A micromorfologia do
LVA, LA e “LAC” é dominada pela microestrutura do tipo granular ou microagregados e
porosidade do tipo empilhamento/empacotamento, típicos de Latossolos. No GXbd predomina
a estrutura maciça, com a presença de cutãs de iluviação e ferri-argilãs. Paleogleissolos foram
latolizados pela ação da fauna escavadora e deram origem aos atuais “LAC”. Os GXbd da
base da vereda preservaram atributos físicos, mineralógicos e micromorfológicos que tiveram
suas gêneses em períodos secos.

Termos de indexação: microagregados, pedogênese, Latossolos, Gleissolos.

INTRODUCTION

Chapadas (highlands) predominate on the
Jequitinhonha plateau, in Northeastern Minas Gerais
(MG); these are extensive areas of flattened terrain
(at about 900 m asl).  The original biome was the
Cerrado vegetation and the area was separated by the
Jequitinhonha and Araçuaí River and their affluents.
Some of these chapadas, which cover over 10,000 ha,
are drained by streams with swamps (veredas) at their
source.

According to Campos (1998), the drainage system
of the upper Jequitinhonha valley is immensely
important for the soil and landscape evolution because
structural, tectonic, and lithological factors induced
changes in this environment.  Veredas may occur

under varied hypsometric, lithostratigraphic,
pedologic, and pluviometric conditions (Melo, 1992).
Red, Red Yellow, Yellow, and gray-colored Latosols
predominate on the chapadas of the upper
Jequitinhonha; and Gleysols and Plinthosols are found
in the valleys (Ferreira et al., 2010).

The mineral material of the dominant soils in the
Cerrado biome is clayey, composed mainly of kaolinite,
iron oxides, gibbsite, and also Ti and quartz oxides
(Moura Filho &amp;amp; Buol, 1972; Weaver, 1974; Curi &amp;amp;
Franzmeier, 1984); these in turn reflect the soil
genesis and weathering stages, related with the
landscape evolution.  Ferreira et al. (2010) characterized
the mineralogy of the Latosols on the Jequitinhonha
plateau, which contain mostly kaolinite and gibbsite
with significant crystallinity in the clay fraction.

Detailed micromorphological studies deepen the
understanding of the origin of soils (Brewer, 1976).
Such studies have demonstrated clay illuviation/
eluviation, microaggregation, and pore quantity and
size distribution as soil forming processes (Bullock et
al., 1985), which are also related with the landscape
evolution.

The purpose of this paper was to study the
micromorphology and identify the mineral material
of the clay fraction of soils in a representative
toposequence of a highland swamp (vereda located on
a chapada) of the upper Jequitinhonha valley, MG,
focused on the genesis and relation with the landscape
evolution.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Location, geomorphology, and geology

The studied soils are part of a toposequence in the
Vereda Lagoa do Leandro, in the municipality of
Minas Novas, Alto Vale do Jequitinhonha, Minas
Gerais State, Brazil (latitude 17 º 19 ’ to 17 ° 20 ’
South, longitude 42 º 28 ’ to 42 ° 29 ’ West).

The region around Minas Novas is drained by the
Araçuaí, Fanado, Capivari, and Setubal rivers.  There
are two hydrogeological domains: Cenozoic dendritic
cover, and Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks (CPRM,
2005).

The planation surface on the Jequitinhonha plateau
was formed in the Lower or Middle Tertiary Period,
and originated the current chapadas, which are
underlain by lithologies of the Macaúbas group; the
summits are flattened and were fragmented by intense
dissection of the landscape.  There are Cenozoic
dendritic-lateritic sediments in these dissected areas,
converging to the Fanado and Capivari river basins
(Minas Gerais, 1982; Campos, 1998).

A deep pedologic cover on the chapadas facilitates
water infiltration; part of this water supplies deep
regional water tables, and another part rises to the
surface as localized surface flow in the lower portions
of the chapadas; the headwaters are commonly named
“veredas” (Projeto RADAMMINAS, 1977).

The planation surfaces of the Lower or Middle
Tertiary Periods overlay Proterozoic diamictite schists
(Minas Gerais, 1982; Campos, 1998).  This author
also claims that this region defines the beginning of
the caatinga vegetation in the State of Minas Gerais.

The Macaúbas lithology is a pre-Cambrian
Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequence consisting of
quartz-biotite-schists with interbedded quartzite,
conglomerates, philites, limestone lenses,
amphibolites and green schists, underlying the
evolution of the regional terrain (Pedrosa Soares,
1996).

Field work
Based on the Brazilian Soil Classification System

(Embrapa, 2006), four profiles representing the
landscape (top, mid-slope, foot slope, and bottom of
the vereda) were described in a toposequence on the
hillside of the Lagoa do Leandro microbasin in the
upper Jequitinhonha valley: top – typical dystrophic
Red Yellow Latosol (LVA); mid-slope – typical
dystrophic Yellow Latosol (LA); foot slope – grayish
colored dystrophic Yellow Latosol, here named
dystrophic “Grayish Latosol” (“LAC”); and the base of
the vereda – argisol dystrophic tb Haplic Gleysol
(GXbd).  Based on the Soil Taxonomy (United States,
1975) the same soil profiles were classified, respectively,
as: Typic Haplustox (LVA), Xanthic Haplustox (LA),
Xanthic Haplustox, gray color, here called “Gray
Haplustox” (“LAC”) and Typic Albaquult (GXbd).

The soils sampled in trenches in horizons were
described morphologically, according to Santos et al.
(2005).  Disturbed samples were collected for mineral
material analysis of B horizons, since there was no
mineralogical variation across the layers, and non-
disturbed samples preferably of the A and B or
transition horizons for micromorphological analyses.
The aim was to sample a surface layer (affected by
organic matter) and a subsurface (diagnostic) horizon.

Laboratory work

Mineralogical analyses

The mineral material of the clay fraction was
analyzed by X ray diffraction (XRD).  Samples were
prepared and the mineral material of the clay fraction
detremined according to Jackson (1975).  Samples were
treated according to Kämpf &amp;amp; Schwertmann, (1982),
using a method modified by Singh &amp;amp; Gilkes (1991) for
concentrates to identify iron oxides.

Diffraction X ray was carried out using a Shimadzu
XRD 6000 diffractometer with a copper anode and
coupled graphite crystal monochromator, operating
at 40 kv and 20 mA.  Samples were diffracted in the
form of aggregates on slides, scanned in 3–35 º2?
intervals at a speed of 1.5 º2? min-1 in continuous
mode.  Natural clay and oxide concentrates were
analyzed as non-oriented dust scanned in 3–70 °2?
intervals, also at 1.5 º2? min-1 in continuous mode.

The criteria for interpreting diffractograms and
identifying the mineral material of the clay fraction
were based on interplanar (d) spacing and the
diffraction peaks following thermal and saturation
treatments, as described by Jackson (1975), Brown &amp;amp;
Brindley (1980), and Moore &amp;amp; Reynolds (1989).

Micromorphological analyses

Non-disturbed samples were collected on card paper
covered with film paper to maintain the structural
integrity.  The samples were then impregnated with
a 1.0 # 08 crystal resin + styrene monomer +
fluorescent pigment and catalyzer, after which the

sections were polished, glued onto glass slides, and
again sectioned and polished to the ideal thickness
for micromorphological analysis, as recommended by
Murphy (1986).  The thin sections were analyzed under
a Zeiss petrographic microscope and described
according to Bullock et al. (1985), Brewer (1976), and
Stoops &amp;amp; Jongerius (1975).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Characterizing the mineralogy

The mineral material of the clay fraction in all
study soils consisted mostly of kaolinite (K), with some
titanium oxide occurrences (Anatase - An), as often
observed in regions with latosols (Curi &amp;amp; Franzmeier,
1984) (Figures 1 to 4).  Goethite (Gh) and gibbsite (Gb)
may be found in LA and LVA (Figures 3 and 4).  Illite
(I) and a low intensity diffraction peak corresponding
to the basal spacing of vermiculite (V) was found in
the Btg2 horizon of the GXbd (Figure 1).

Kaolinite was found by the presence of diffraction
peaks at basal spacings of 0.722 nm (12.24 °2? d001)
and 0.359 nm (24.74 °2? d002), which collapsed after
heating to 550 ºC.  Heating the sample to 550 °C causes
destruction of Al oxides and collapse of this mineral.
The presence of 1.026 nm (8.61 °2? d001), 0.505 nm
(17.52 °2? d001), and 0.336 nm (26.48 °2? d001)
diffraction peaks indicated the presence of illite
(Figure 1).  Anatase was found at a 0.351 nm (25.3
°2? d101) diffraction peak, which becomes clear after
heating the oxide concentrate to 550 ºC (Figures 1 to
4).  Vermiculite was found in the GXbd because of a
weak 1.4 nm (6.3 °2? d001) diffraction peak that was
not displaced after treatment with glycerol, and which

collapsed after heating to 550 ºC (Figure 1).  Diffraction
peaks at 0.483 nm (18.35 °2? d001) and 0.437 nm
(20.3 °2? d001) indicated the presence of gibbsite.
Goethite was found because of 0.416 nm
(21.34 °2? d001) and 0.269 nm (33.25 °2? d001)
diffraction peaks, which collapsed after thermal
treatment at 350 ºC (Figures 3 and 4).

Kaolinite was predominant in the Btg2 horizon of
the GXbd; there were occurrences of illite and traces
of vermiculite.  This material was concordant with
the Ki &amp;lt;2.0 and pH &amp;lt;5.0 values for all horizons of
this soil type (Melo, 1992; Bispo, 2010) also found 2:1
traces of minerals at the bottom of veredas on a plateau
in northwestern Minas Gerais.

According to Mala (2002), vermiculite formation
may be associated with alteration in micaceous or
feldspathic minerals.  According to Ramos (2000), the
occurrence of vermiculite traces in waterlogged soils
of the vereda may be explained by stagnant water
that results in less intense weathering and
neoformation of these minerals under the effect of
silica and bases.

Horizons Bw in LA and LVA consist essentially of
kaolinite, goethite, and gibbsite, which are typical clay
minerals formed under intense weathering conditions
and excellent drainage.  Low Ki values and a low Feo/
Fed ratio support these results.  Iron oxides were not
found in the “LAC”, which is supported by a low content
of Feo and Fed and a much higher Feo/Fed ratio than
in the LA and LVA, and at a lower ratio than that of
GXbd (Bispo, 2010).

Kämpf &amp;amp; Schwertmann (1983) have suggested that
increased moisture and lower pH values in LA and

LVA profiles result in (hydrated) goethite rather than
(dehydrated) hematite formation.  Ferreira et al.
(2010) found no Fe oxides either in a gray latosol profile
in the upper Jequitinhonha region.

The Latosols of the Lagoa do Leandro swamp are
formed by pre-weathered materials (in prior  weathering
cycles) which, in association with the current terrain
and climate, are at an advanced weathering stage;
thus they are essentially kaolinitic and oxidic.

Micromorphology

The A horizon of GXbd is homogeneous; it contains
a single porphyric-enaulic zone.  The microstructure
consists of subangular, prismatic, and microgranulated
blocks (Figure 5a).  The plasma is black-reddish and
isoptic, probably because of organic matter.  The
predominantly inter-aggregate porosity has a stacked/
packed structure, with some filled biological cavities,
channels, and microfissures (Figure 5b).  Pedologic
features such as quartz-containing orthotubules,
organic matter, micro-aggregates, and empty
pedotubules may be found.  There are also many roots
along this horizon.

The Btg2 horizon of the GXbd is homogeneous.
There is a dense porphyric zone with a microstructure
of prismatic and subangular polyhedral aggregates
(subangular blocks), confirming the morphological
description of its structure.  The plasma is gray isoptic
and predominant cavity porosity (inter-aggregates);
there are also chambers and microfissures.  The
microstructure of these soils is typically prismatic.
There are also illuvial ferriargillan and cutans
(Figure 5c) composed of illuvial clay and unfilled
pedotubules in small quantities.  These cutans and
ferriargillans are evidence of the occurrence of
argilluviation in the GXbd, as proposed by Ranst &amp;amp;
Coninck (2002), and help explain the high B/A texture
gradient found in these soils.

According to Cooper &amp;amp; Vidal-Torrado (2000), the
main processes that form textural B horizons are clay
translocation and deposition in pores as illuvial cutans.
Fedoroff &amp;amp; Eswaran (1985) also suggested that illuvial
cutans are the main feature for classifying textural B
horizons.

The Bw2 horizon of the “LAC” is homogeneous and
contains a single porphyric-enaulic zone, which
consists mostly of a dense microgranulated
microstructure with a granular substructure
(Figure 6b).  The inter-aggregate porosity consists of
cavities and chambers, and the plasma is isoptic gray-
yellow.  Iron compound-filled orthotubules were found
as well as a few rounded elongated iron nodules in
regions of mottling.  Coal fragments are found
constantly in this horizon (Figure 6a), showing that
the plant cover of this soil had been burned, with the
likelihood of root carbonization.  These fires probably
occurred following landscape dissection because of
improved drainage conditions in the current position
of the foot of the slope.  The microgranulated
microstructure suggests an effect of the fauna and
demonstrated the latosolic nature of this horizon.
Ferreira et al. (2010) published similar descriptions
for a gray latosol in the region of Itamarandiba (MG).

The granular microstructure described by Bullock
et al. (1985) may be observed in the “LAC”, and
indicates a typical latosol structure, especially in more
weathered soils (Buol &amp;amp; Eswaran, 1978).  Another
feature of latosols found in the “LAC” is isoptic plasma
(Brewer, 1976).

subangular polyhedral aggregates, and aggregate
agglomerates; zone B also consists of subrounded
microaggregates and subangular aggregates.  The
plasma in both regions is isoptic, and contains clay
and Fe oxides; yellow is its prevailing color.  In Zone
A, porosity was predominantly structured by complex
inter-aggregate stacking; there were also filled
biological cavities, channels, and microfissures.  The
porosity of Zone B was predominantly structured by
complex inter-aggregate stacking.  Pedological features
included rounded iron nodules, unfilled pedotubules,
iron oxide-filled agrotubules, quartz, and clay;
biological activity was evidencecd by excrements and
roots filled with microaggregates and quartz.

The Bw horizon of the LA contained a single
homogeneous porphyric-enaulic zone, with a
predominantly coalesced microaggregate microstructure,
subangular microaggregates, and aggregate

The A horizon in the LA contains two zones – a

(zone B).  Zone A contained subrounded microaggregates,

agglomerates.  The plasma was yellow red isoptic,
and interaggregate porosity was predominantly
structured by stacking with a few biological cavities
and microfissures.  Pedological features include Fe
nodules (Figure 7a) and Fe oxide and clay-filled
agrotubules (Figure 7b); roots were also common.

The A horizon of the LVA contains a homogeneous
porphyric-enaulic zone, which consists of a
microstructure with predominantly coalesced
microaggregates, subangular aggregates, and
aggregate agglomerates.  Porosity was predominantly
structured by stacking, biological cavities, channels,
and microfissures, and the plasma is red isoptic.  There
are rounded Fe nodules and agrotubules filled with
iron oxides, quartz, and clay; coal that contains
microaggregates is common (Figure 8a).

The BA horizon contains two rather heterogeneous
zones.  Zone A is enaulic, and zone B is porphyric.
The microstructure of both is a coalesced and
granulated microstructure.  Inter-aggregate porosity
in the former consists of stacking, channels, and
microfissures; in the latter, of biological cavities and
microfissures (Figure 8b).  The plasma is red isoptic.
Agrotubules are filled with clay, quartz, and Fe oxides;
iron nodules are an additional pedological feature.

The micromorphological features of the horizons
of these latosols are similar to those reported by
Andrade et al. (1997) and Silva &amp;amp; Vidal-Torrado (1999).

Origin of soils in the toposequence

The presence of illite and vermiculite traces in the
Btg2 horizon of the GXbd (Figure 1) is evidence of drier

periods, as illite is formed when there is more
evaporation (dry seasons) in sedimentary environments
(Thompson &amp;amp; Ukrainczyk, 2002).  Further evidence
is provided by the argisolic nature of the GXbd.

Buol et al. (1980), Vidal-Torrado &amp;amp; Lepsch (1993),
and Breemen &amp;amp; Buurman (2002) have suggested that
one of the main B/A texture differentiating processes
in soil profiles is the movement of suspended clays
from surface to subsurface horizons.  To make clay
migrate downwards across profiles, aggregates must
break apart by a sudden entry of water into the
aggregate pores, resulting in explosion of the
aggregates by the air leaving the pores.  Rupture is
more common when seasonality is significant, with
well-defined dry periods when soils dry out completely,
and short wet periods with intense rains that quickly
saturate the soil, thereby “exploding” the aggregates.
Thus, argilluviation in the GXbd as shown by the
presence of illuviation cutans (Figure 5c) and
ferriargilans is strong evidence of a past climate with
a pronounced dry season and torrential rains at the
beginning of a short wet period (Breemen &amp;amp; Buurman,
2002) in the Lagoa do Leandro swamp region.  This
structure was preserved because a change to a wetter
climate raised the water table in this soil, minimizing
the homogenizing effect of biological activity in the profile.

In the current climate, ferrolysis may have further
increased the B/A textural differentiation observed in
the GXbd.  This horizon is water-saturated during
the rainy season, and dries out during the dry season.
Water saturation reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+, which displaces
the cations from the exchange complex, thereby
reducing the pH.  In the dry season, oxidation of Fe2+
to Fe3+ causes H+ formation, resulting in a further
pH decrease; H+ then penetrates the surface of silicate
clay (K, I, and V – Figure 1), changing positions with
the Al in its octahedrons, resulting in their break up
(Brinkman, 1970; Breemen &amp;amp; Buurman, 2002; Ranst
&amp;amp; Conick, 2002).  This soil-forming process may have
contributed significantly to the clay destruction in the
A horizon of GXbd.

Good drainage in the LVA and the LA favor profile
homogenization due to the fauna activity in soils.  In
the “LAC”, landscape dissection the helped improve
drainage, and the fauna homogenized the profile.  The
presence of coal fragments in the Bw2 horizon of the
“LAC” (Figure 6a) suggests that the plant cover of
this soil had been affected – and remains exposed to –
fires, which carbonized mainly the roots.  These fires
can only have occurred after landscape dissection and
the resulting improved drainage conditions.  A
microgranulated microstructure suggests the effect
of the fauna, and is evidence of the Latosolic nature of
this horizon.

Landscape evolution and origin of soils in the
Lagoa do Leandro swamp

The chapadas of the upper Jequitinhonha valley
extend over 10,000 to 40,000 ha and are separated by

dissected areas.  In the region of Minas Novas (MG),
chapadas contain drained microbasins in oval, pear-
shaped, depressed areas named veredas.

Figure 9 presents a model of the evolution of
vereda-drained microbasins on the chapadas of the
upper Jequitinhonha region.  Field work, satellite
images, and geomorphological studies (King, 1956;
Boaventura, 1978; Saadi, 1995; Campos, 1998; Motta
et al., 2002) played important roles in developing the
model and understanding the current landscape.

The regional terrain was formed on a uniformly
flattened surface during a prolonged period in the
Lower Tertiary (Figure 9a); it corresponds to a
peneplan resulting from the South American erosion
cycle (King, 1956).  Chapadas at 800 to 1,000 m asl
are evidence of the relief imposed by the South
American Surface (Saadi, 1995).

The oval shape of the vereda of the Lagoa do
Leandro microbasin may have been originated by
“geochemical dissolution” processes (Lima &amp;amp; Queiroz
Neto, 1996) associated with erosion (Figure 9b).
“Geochemical dissolution” may have occurred due to
the presence of less weathering-resistant minerals in
the parent material (Macaúbas).  A low-grade drainage
network dissected the chapadas during the Tertiary
period, (Figure 9c).

The chapadas in the region of Minas Novas (MG)
are a more recent dissection, compared to those studied
by Ferreira et al. (2010).  The soil distribution in the

HIGHLANDS OF THE UPPER JEQUITINHONHA VALLEY, BRAZIL. II – MINERALOGY...                 1089

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1081-1091, 2011

Lagoa do Leandro microbasin appears to be significant
evidence of the current drainage network.  The
occurrence of Latosols (Figure 9d) is similar to that
found on surface I, as described by Motta et al. (2002),
for soils of the Brazilian Central Plateau, which is in
turn related with the South American Surface as
described by King (1956).

The soils of the vereda underwent an intense
deferrification process, resulting in grayish colors;
unlike on the chapadas, where reddish or yellowish
soils predominate, due to better drainage (UFV, 1980).
The color of the B horizon of Latosols in the microbasin
under study is yellowish and burnished and can be
grayish at the base of the vereda.

On gently undulated areas that correspond to the
“LAC”, alternating reduction and oxidation because
of water table oscillations in the swamp led to mottling
in the subsurface of this soil.  Gleysolization of the
GXbd probably occurred because of permanent water
saturation during most of the Pleistocene, interrupted
by dry periods (Salgado-Labouriau et al., 1998).

In the “LAC”, formed in lower and poorly drained
areas of the landscape during the Pleistocene (Ferreira
et al., 2010), drainage improved gradually, but the
grayish colors remained as probably almost all Fe3+
was removed during the long period under reducing
conditions (Schwertmann &amp;amp; Taylor, 1989;
Peterschmitt et al., 1996; Kämpf &amp;amp; Curi, 2000).

As drainage improved, the action of the
bioturbating fauna (ants, termites, and annelids) in
the pedologic cover may have been intensified, changing
the blocky structure of old gleysolized soils into a
granulated structure (Figure 6b).  These Gleysols were
gradually latosolized by biological and chemical
processes; however, as the grayish colors were not
lost, they originated the gray Latosols, or “LAC”
(Ferreira et al., 2010).

Thus, Argisols may have been formed during
climates with more pronounced dry seasons and
torrential rains at the beginning of short wet seasons,
(Breemen &amp;amp; Buurman, 2002).  Drainage lines became
deeper and soils in higher parts of microbasins that
drain to the veredas may have become homogenized
by the action of the soil fauna supported by the wet
climate during the more humid Pleistocene period.
As dissection progressed, soil drainage in lower
portions of the past landscape improved, and the fauna
caused material to become homogeneous and formed
microaggregates – latosolizing the ancient
hydromorphic soils.

The current veredas would have formed in the
newer, more depressed parts of the landscape, a result
of the interconnection of circular depressions
(exudation points) located in poorly drained areas on
the chapadas.  At these sites, Gleysols are currently
found, preserving evidence of dry periods or inherited
material, such as illite and vermiculite in the clay
fraction, and illuvial cutans and ferriargilans in the

Btg horizon.  Ferrolysis in horizon A would have
contributed significantly to a high texture gradient
between horizons A and B.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Paleogleysols were latolized by excavating fauna/
bioturbating fauna and gave rise to the current LACs.

2. The past seasonal climate and current ferrolysis
are evidence of a high B/A texture gradient in Haplic
Gleysols.

3. Haplic Gleysols at the base of the vereda conserve
original physical, mineralogical, and micromorphological
features of their formation during dry periods.

4. The soils and landscape of the Lagoa do Leandro
swamp were formed and developed together with a
drainage network that is related with Pleistocene
climate changes.
