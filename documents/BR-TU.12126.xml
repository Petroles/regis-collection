STRUCTURES IN JURASSIC ROCKS OF THE WESSEX BASIN, SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND - II: DIAPIRISM IN EVAPORITE LAYERS 

LUIZ JOSE HOMEM D'EL-REY SILVA 

ABSTRACT The Jurassic Purbeck Beds of the Fossil Forest cliff, Lulworth Cove (southern England) encloses a ~ 10 m-thick wedge in which 
four juxtaposed levels (L2-L5) of differential strain have been characterized, between two levels of non deformed rocks (LI and L6). Within 
the zone of strain, level L2 comprises basal calcareous marls displaying 1 cm-thick zones of bed-parallel foliation developed in an anastomosed 
pathway to form pillow-like features, and upper layers of evaporite where tens of mushrooms or diapirs are observed. They commonly display 
a~ 1 m-sized circular geometry on bed-parallel sections, a ~0.5 m high central zone forming a generally bed-perpendicular tail, and are surrounded 
by rim synclines where the evaporite layers are entrapped together with chert and shale; level 3 consists of evaporite and shales displaying cm- 
to dm-scale extension and contraction structures; level L4 comprises remnants of evaporite layers embedded in a shale matrix - a tectonic 
melange; and level L5 comprises blocks of evaporite and limestone involved in a shale / argillite matrix, a limestone breccia (the so-called 
Broken Beds) inside which some layers are still preserved and exhibit 1-10 m-scale contraction and extension structures. Level L5 results from 
the westwards displacement of a wedge above an extensional detachment (the interface L3 / L4) and below another detachment established on 
a layer of shale at the contact with level L6. The mushrooms clearly deform the L3 / L4 detachment and are interpreted as thermal convection 
structures formed by a progressive down-sucking of the layers back in the direction of an imaginary point at the center of the diapirs - a 
centripetal suction leading to contraction and coeval extension, soon after initial displacement of the wedge. The pillow-like features result from 
percolation of fluids across the marls simultaneously with the evolution of the mushrooms.

RESUMO No afloramento Fóssil Forest da localidade de Lulworth Cove, no sul da Inglaterra, a Formação Purbeck (Jurássico) engloba uma 
cunha (espessura ~ lOm) de rochas divididas em quatro andares verticalmente justapostos, os quais diferem quanto a estilos / intensidade de 
deformação (L2-L5) e ocorrem encaixados entre dois andares de rochas não deformadas (LI e L6). O andar L2 consiste, na base, de margas 
carbonáticas que exibem zonas de 1-2 cm de espessura nas quais a rocha é foliada e que se dispõem de modo a formar um padrão anastomosado 
ou em almofadas e, no topo, de camadas de evaporitos exibindo dezenas de estruturas na forma de cogumelos (ou diápiros) que têm geometria 
normalmente circular (~lm de diâmetro) em seções paralelas ao acamamento, e que normalmente exibem uma zona tubular central com cerca 
de 0.5 m de altura, formando uma chaminé ou cauda perpendicular às camadas; tais estruturas são comumente circundadas por dobras sinclinais 
asimétricas e apertadas, na zona interna das quais o evaporito, folhelho e chert são trapeados e deformados. O andar L3 consiste de evaporitos 
e folhelhos afetados por estruturas compressionais e extensionais de escala sub-métrica; o andar L4 consiste de fragmentos de camadas de 
evaporito misturados caoticamente em matriz de folhelhos, ou seja, típica melange tectônica; e o andar L5 apresenta camadas brechadas de 
evaporito e calcáreo, com intercalações de folhehos e argilitos, todas afetadas por estruturas compressionais e extensionais de escala = l 0 metros. 
O andar L5 resulta do deslocamento, para oeste, das camadas superiores da cunha ao longo e acima de um descolamento extensional estabe- 
lecido na interface dos andares L3 e L4, e abaixo de um outro descolamento estabelecido ao longo de camada de folhelho no contato com o andar 
L6. Os cogumelos do andar L2 claramente deformam o descolamento L3 / L4 e são, portanto, estruturas tectônicas, aqui interpretadas como 
devidas a processo de convecção termal que teve lugar logo após o deslocamento inicial das rochas acima da interface L3/L4. Em consequência 
do processo convectivo, as camadas foram sugadas para baixo e para trás, em direção a um ponto imaginário no centro dos diápiros - uma 
espécie de sucção centrípeta responsável pela formação simultânea de estruturas contracionais e extensionais. Simultaneamente, formaram-se 
as almofadas da base do andar L2 por percolação de fluidos através das margas.

INTRODUCTION The area surrounding the locality of West 
Lulworth, southern England (see geological map and cross section in 
the Introduction to the companion paper) has specially charmed 
geologists, as the rocks that form its substratum - limestones of the 
Upper Jurassic Portland-Purbeck Beds, and the Cretaceous argillites, 
arenites (Wealden Group), gault, greensands and chalk, as well as 
Tertiary (Paleogene) sands, gravel and clays - contains well-exposed 
important geological features around Lulworth Cove, such as: two 
megasequence boundary unconformities, hm-scale folds that affect 
Wealden Group rocks and constitute the Lulworth crumple (to the west 
of the cove), and the Broken Beds plus a series of mushroom structures 
recorded within the Purbeck Formation that crop out along the Fossil 
Forest cliff, to the east of the cove (West 1975, Underhill &amp;amp; Paterson 
1998). 

The Upper Jurassic Purbeck Formation, or Purbeck Beds, consists 
of carbonate and clay sediments (West 1975). The detailed structural 
analysis presented in the companion paper has allowed to show that, at 
the Fossil Forest cliff, the Purbeck Formation encloses a ~ 10 m-thick 
wedge of highly deformed rocks divided in four juxtaposed structural 
levels (L2-L5) situated above non deformed limestones (level L I )  and 
below non deformed limestones with intercalated shales / argillites 
(level L6). Structural level L2 comprises basal calcareous marls 
displaying 1 cm-thick zones of bed-parallel foliation developed in an 
anastomosed pathway to form pillow-like features, and upper layers of 
evaporite plus chert / shale deformed around the mushrooms. Level 3 
consists of evaporite and shales displaying cm- to dm-scale extension 
and contraction structures such as boudinage, domino- and listric-style 
normal faults; a bedding sub-parallel foliation affected by recumbent 
folds; and thrust faults as well as asymmetric folds verging either to the 
west or to the east. Level L4 comprises remnants of evaporite layers 

and fragments of these layers embedded in a shale matrix, a typical 
tectonic melange. Level L5 (the so-called Broken Beds) comprises = 
Im-sized blocks of evaporite and limestone involved in a shale / 
argillite matrix (a typical limestone breccia) and also some still 
preserved layers exhibit 1-10 m-scale contraction and extension 
structures such as asymmetric folds, thrust, and planar- and listric-style 
normal faults. 

The detailed description of the structures led to the conclusions 
that: (1) - Structural level L5 results from the westward displacement 
of a wedge above a top-down to the west extensional detachment 
established on levels L3 and L4 and below a detachment established 
along a layer of shale at the contact with level L6. The Broken Beds 
formed by intense fracturing associated to inter-layer slip and also to 
the folding that resulted from this slip; (2) - The westward 
displacement may be part of a more regional tectonic event, if one 
considers that the close spatial relationship of the Broken Beds and the 
evaporite layers, at the Fossil Forest cliff, is remarkably noticed across 
several localities of the Dorset coast, according to a detailed 
description in West (1975); (3) - The displacement of the wedge took 
place earlier in the Alpine inversion of the Wessex basin, that ended 
the tilting of Purbeck Beds to the north. The chaotic structure of the 
breccia was finally attained by further slip associated to this latter 
tilting; (4) - The record of varied style and intensity of strain, even for 
adjacent parts of a single layer or in juxtaposed structural levels makes 
the Fossil Forest outcrop a key field locality for understanding crustal 
deformation processes that have been described in recent literature 
(summary in Axen et al. 1998); and (5) -The east-west flow along the 
basal evaporite detachment was followed in time by the north-south 
compression of the whole area, implying in a vertical juxtaposition of 
nearly orthogonal kinematics that may fit in the transpression-related 
Cenozoic inversion of European basins (Ziegler 1989).

Structures in Jurassic Rocks of the Wessex Basin, southern England - II: Diaprism in evaporite layers 

This paper adds to the structural analysis in the companion paper, 
and presents a detailed description and interpretation of the origin of 
the pillows and the mushrooms of structural level L2 of the Fossil 
Forest cliff. As will be shown, the mushrooms are tectonic features 
most probably originated by thermal convection, and the detailed 
analysis of deformation around their rim synclines provides important 
elements to understand how the process evolves. The results in here 
show that systematic studies of particular outcrops may lead to 
alternative ways to understand natural features in the field, helping to 
constrain their possible interpretations. Adopting a similar ki nd of 
approach, Prof. J.G. Ramsay (1992) concentrated his attention to the 
small-scale structures of another particular outcrop situated about 10 
km to the east of West Lulworth, and obtained results that allowed him 
to argue for caution on the indiscriminate application of the theory of 
propagation of thrust faults. 

STRUCTURES WITHIN LEVEL L2 The p i l l o w - l i k e  
structures These features are restricted to a~ 0.5 m-thick layer of 
brown calcareous marl that West (1975) named Dirt Beds. Pillows are 
drawn in the rock by anastomosed 1 cm-thick zones where the rock 
acquires a brownish y ellow color and an internal, border-parallel 
foliation (Fig. la), giving to the Dirt Beds the aspect of a collage of 
pillows, the geometry of which implies that the termination of the 
bodies commonly looks l i ke  a folded f o l i a t i o n  (Fig. 1b )  seen in 
surfaces of any orientation. Geometrically speaking, the pillows are 
oblate ellipsoidal bodies that on bed-parallel sections appear as ellipses 
with maximum axis no greater than a meter, and maximum / minimum 
axial ratio close to 1, whereas in bed-perpendicular sections they 
appear as ellipses with minor axis no greater than 10 cm and axial ratio 
between 3-5. 

The mushrooms The process responsible for the mushrooms to 
develop certainly made them more resistant, as many (tens) remain 
higher than the surrounding layers (Fig. 2a), as t y pi c a l  dome-like 
structures, or true 3-D diapirs surrounded by r i m  synclines inside 
which the layers are strongly deformed. As a common characteristic, 
all mushrooms are bui l d on evaporite layers and contain a ri m of 
synclines where the layers situated above are enclosed and highly  
deformed. 

On bedding-parallel sections most mushrooms display a circular 
shape with diameter around a meter, and contain an empty central tube 
perpendicular to bedding (Fig. 2a), like a cylinder or a tail with a sub- 
circular basal section with diameter around 0.5 m and a height of 50- 
60 cm. At a first look, these appear to be characteristic for all 
mushrooms, but a more careful search indicates other important 
particularities: (1) - Some mushrooms have central tubes with = 1.5 in- 
long axis disposed parallel to the beds, and their partial erosion results 
in a rather e l l i p t i c  geometry (center of Fig. 2b); (2) - Mushrooms 
exposed to less erosion display a central tube only few centimeters 
wide (the left, Fig. 2b), or s i m p l y  display  a ring structure of the 
evaporite layers at their top, instead of the tube (Fig. 2c); (3) - A strong 
striae lineation (Fig. 2d-e) may be observed on the walls of the central 
tube, parallel to the tube axis; (4) - The mushrooms occur randomly 
across level L2, and are normally separated one from each other by a 
distance of one to more meters. At one p a r t i c u l a r  place, two 
mushrooms shared space during t he i r evolution and develop the 
geometry of an eight ("8") at the surface (Fig. 2 f ) ;  (5) - Layers of 
bluish gray chert and light brown calcareous shale that lie on the top of 
the mushrooms are normally found entrapped and deformed inside the 
rim synclines (Fig. 3a-f, Fig. 4a-c), but the deeper hinge of the ri m 
synclines is invariably built on folded evaporite layers (Fig. 3b-d). A 
set of closely-spaced partition planes is sub-parallel to the axial plane 
of the rim syncline and affects the chert (Fig. 3e); (6) - On the outer 
surface of the mushrooms, the contact between the evaporite layers and 
the chert (in the single place where it could be closely observed - Fig. 
5a) is marked by a through-going ductile-brittle and ~ 1 cm-thick zone 
of deformation (Fig. 5b) that consists of a fine-grained matrix, 
probably of calcareous shale or marl, enclosing fragments of chert and 
evaporite. Otherwise, the contact may be normal and displaying a 
striae lineation that turns around the outer surface and points to the 
central tube (Fig. 5c); and finally  (7) -The mushrooms with bedding- 
parallel central tube also di spl a y  r i m  sy nclines w i t h  the same 
characteristics as those with bedding-perpendicular tube (Fig. 6a-b). 

 

Figure 1 a-b : The pillows of level L2. These structures are bound by cm-thick 
anastomosed zones of brownish yellow material displaying an internal, 
border-parallel foliation, as pointed by the arrow in ( a ) .  The termination of 
the pillows often displays geometry of folds (b). 

TIMING FOR EVOLUTION OF THE MUSHROOMS    Key 
contact relationships, observed j u s t  a few meters to the west of the 
lower steps of the stairs that give access to the outcrop (see Fig. 3c in 
the companion paper), clearly indicate that some mushrooms stay 
higher than the basal detachment and that they pushed up and 
deformed the layers of structural level L3 and the tectonic melange of 
structural level L4 (Fig. 7a-d). These findings demonstrate that the 
mushrooms are tectonic features that must have developed soon after 
the i n i t i a l  displacement of the rocks of level L5 along the basal 
detachment, or after cessation of the entire movement. 

Other evidence indicates evolution of the mushrooms under the 
same conditions of viscous flow as those for the evolution of the 
structures already described in level L3, in the first paper of this series. 
This evidence (ahead in this section), plus the lack of north trending 
lineations that could be indicative of a northward driven flow along the 
evaporite layers of levels L2 and L3, together w i t h  all the 
characteristics of the mushrooms described in the previous section, all 
indicate an evolution soon after the beginning of the displacement of 
the wedge to the west, still before the final tectonic inversion that led 
to overall tilting of the Purbeck Beds to the north. 

T I M I N G  FOR DEFORMATION WITHIN THE PURBECK 
BEDS Thus, by considering also the results of a companion paper, 
the following sequence of Cenozoic events that contributed for the

ultimate structural configuration of the Purbeck Beds in the Fossil 
Forest cliff may be envisaged: / - Start up of viscous How within the 
evaporite layers of level L3, leading to small-scale contemporaneous 
extension and contraction structures, followed by displacement of the 
layers above to form the tectonic melange (L4) and the Broken Beds 
(L5); 2 - Viscous How within the layers below the basal detachment 

leading to the mushroom and pillow-like structures of level L2; 3 - All 
the Purbeck Beds are tilted to the north, late in the tectonic inversion 
of the Wessex Basin. Further slip to the north took place within level 
L5 and contributed for the final shaping of the Broken Beds. This later 
deformation may have been f a c i l i t a t e d  by the large amount of a 
lubricant matrix of shale / argillite within level L5.

EVOLUTION OF THE MUSHROOMS In order to understand 
the evolution of the mushrooms, attention should be driven to key 
features provided by the layers of chert and shale that are entrapped 
and strongly deformed in the rim synclines (Fig. 3-4). In fact, chert 
layers commonly occurs in close association with the mushrooms, 
surrounding them or resting between two or more of these features 
(Fig. 3a). The chert layers are thickened inside the rim synclines, as 
well as at the upper part of these folds, relatively to the adjacent areas, 
and vanish towards the top of the mushrooms (Fig. 3b-d). The same is 
also valid for layers of shale. Going into the rim synclinc (Fig. 3e) the 
chert (or shale) is submitted to strong compression and acquires (in 
that particular case) a set of closely-spaced fractures, and the alignment 
of many of them leads to a set partition planes sub-parallel to the axial 
plane of the fold - such as a spaced cleavage. 

The fact that chert (or shale) entrapped into the ri m synclines is 
systematically well below its original topographic level (Figs. 3d-e) 
demonstrates that the mushrooms formed as a consequence of viscous 
flow during which layers of evaporite were pulled down and carried 
into the rim synclines, together with layers situated above (chert or 
shale) as indicated by the larger arrow in Figure 3c. Once the synclines 
turn around all the periphery of the mushrooms, the matter must have 
been p u l l e d  back and down towards a central point, l i k e  the one 
i n d i c a t e d  by the bl ue  bag in Figure 3c. In other words, the r i m  
synclines correspond to the areas into which the evaporite layers were 
sucked down, and this movement led to a centripetal underthrusting of 

the evaporite layers and uplift of the top of the mushrooms. The vast 
majority of them are up-facing, but down-facing mushrooms of smaller 
scale may be also observed locally in the Fossil Forest outcrop (Fig. 
3f). 

The viscous flow is also demonstrated by evidence for a 
progressive evolution of the rim synclines, or suction zones, as in the 
locality of Figure 4, where the well-defined lamination of the light 
brown shale allows to identify subtle variations in thickness, from the 
inside to the outside of the rim sy nclines, as well as a kind of 
"unconformable" relationship between layers that are more internal in 
the synclines and others situated above (Fig. 4a-c). 

Thickness variations and the "unconformable" relationship are 
tectonic features indicative of progressive entrapment into the rim 
synclines (Fig. 8): the first layers entrapped in synclines are thickened 
and leave no room for much more material to be sucked down, so that 
the last layers to enter in the rim syncline remain at the top of the folds 
and are only slightly thickened. The tectonic unconformity develops at 
that part because the suction of the layers into the rim syncline has to 
be accommodated by extension of adjacent parts of the same layers 
outside and even inside the zone of contraction. This strain is taken up 
by d u c t i l e  t h i n n i n g  of the layers above the head of the same 
mushroom, or above the head of the adjacent one (Fig. 8), whereas 
layers coming later into the suction zone show less variation of 
thickness and truncate the borders of the layers that entered first in the 
rim synclines. Even the external limb of the syncline may be thinned 
or affected by extension faults, as a consequence of this process of 
underthrusting. 

DISCUSSION Given that the mushrooms are a consequence of 
viscous flow w i t h i n  evaporite layers of level 2, and that this flow 
succeeded shortly in time the onset of the tectonic melange (level L4), 
why is it that the How in level L2 took place and why is it that it obeys 
a 3-D concentric pattern, rather than being directed to the west, as the 
initial flow in level L3 and above?. 

The mushrooms of the Fossil Forest outcrop have all t h e  
characteristics of typical diapirs that Jackson et al (1990) described in 
detail in the Great Kavir of Iran, and interpreted as thermal convection 
structures: the overall shape, the rim synclines and the overall pattern 
of deformation associated, the central tube, the lineation parallel to the 
axis of the tubes. Moreover, down-suction of the upper chert (or shale) 
layers into the rim synclines and uplift of the lower evaporite layers to 
form the head of the mushrooms lead to an stratigraphic inversion 
normally associated to diapirism (Schenk &amp;amp; Jackson 1993). In 
addition, the contact relationships of Figure 5 may be taken as 
evidence for the radial friction between evaporite layers and others 
above, along the outer surface of the mushrooms. This friction and the 
central tube are due to the flow of the matter up and around the head 
of the diapirs (Fig. 8), as has been extremely well portrayed in Figures 
2.8 and 2.9 of Jackson et al. (1990). But yet: why is it a thermal driven 
process? 

Salt (or evaporite) layers have a viscosity that is naturally lower 
t h a n  t h a t  of other sediments, and is suffi c i e nt l y  close to the low 
viscosity that allows the critical Rayleigh number to be achieved, 
triggering thermal convection in these sediments (Jackson et al. 1990). 
These authors described thermal convection features much smaller or 
as big as the mushrooms of Lulworth Cove, and calculated that even a 
small increase in temperature is sufficient to make the natural viscosity 
of cvaporites equal to the critical value for onset of the process. 
Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of salt (evaporite) is a factor of 
two to three times higher than that of typical sediments, and this is a 
key factor for heat to be transported upwards, across the salt layers in 
order to facilitate thermal maturation of oil in the sediments above 
(Petersen &amp;amp; Lerche 1996). As the evaporite layers of structural levels 
L4 and L5 lost cohesion - giving rise to the melange and Broken Beds 
- they also lost the natural capacity for a sufficiently fast transport of 
the heat generated by friction along the basal detachment (level L3 / 
L4). Thus, it is quite realistic to t h i n k  that going down into the 
cohesive layers of evaporites of level L2 the friction heat found a much 
more favorable way to dissipate. Finding a highly thermal conductive 
but sub-horizontal layer, heat had to dissipate very fast laterally, and 
thermal convection is the most efficient process if compared to other 
processes such as thermal radiation (Elder 1976). Another factor that 
may have significantly contributed for thermal convection to take place 
is the high salinity of the evaporite layers that West (1975) noticed

L4. (b) Detail of the previous picture to show (arrow X) the tectonic melange curved down towards the rim syncline, and (arrow Y) the fracturing of a remnant

across the southern coast of Dorset. High salinity is one of the factors 
that positively contribute to rendering the thermal convection process 
easier and more vigorous (Elder 1978). It may facilitate that micro 
electric-magnetic currents propagate within the layers: these currents 
are a key factor for convection of natural fluids, according to Van 
Heijst &amp;amp; Flor (1989) and, despite of the lack of further investigation, 
these currents may also be important for convection of rock matter 
with very low viscosity, such as salts and evaporites. 

Once the bottom of the evaporite layers occur no more than 1-2 m 
below the bottom of the Broken Beds (West 1975, see Fig. 2b in the 
companion paper) and discounting the thickness of levels L4 and L3, 
then the best way for the quickest propagation of heat was laterally 
within the 0.5 m-thick blanket of level L2, where thermal conductivity 
should have been much higher than in the layers above and below. If 
so, the lateral propagation of heat w i t h i n  t hi s horizontal corridor 
contributed for lowering even more the viscosity of the evaporite 
layers and helped to trigger thermal convection. This situation may 
explain the occurrence of the mushrooms along a single stratigraphic 
level at Lulworth Cove, and also across the several localities of the 
southern coast of Dorset, always at s i m i l a r  proximity to the lower 
contact of the Broken Beds (West 1975, his Figs. 2 and 3). His detailed 
study indicates that two stratigraphic levels w i t h  diapiric structures, 
such as those described here, are found only at the Perryfield Quarry,

Structures in Jurassic Rocks of the Wessex Basin, southern England - II: Diaprism in evaporite layers 

Dirt Beds. These are the layers that contain the pillow-like structures 
found at the Fossil Forest cliff. The flow of fluids that likely generated 
the pillows may well mark the lower level significantly affected by 
dissipation of the friction heat. 

CONCLUSIONS Among several other points of geological 
interest, the surroundings of West Lulworth, Dorset, southern 
England, also enclose outcrops of the Upper Jurassic Purbeck Beds 
along a cliff to the west of Lulworth Cove, at which tens of mushrooms 
and an impressive limestone breccia claim the observers' attention. 
Abundant field data summarized in this paper demonstrate that: (1) - 
The mushrooms are ~ Im-scale diapiric structures developed within a 
single set of evaporite layers that overly a set of marls and these 
display = 1 cm-thick pillow-like structures formed by an anastomosed 
array of zones where the rock acquires an internal, layer-parallel 
foliation; (2) - Mushrooms and pillows form a " 1 m-thick structural 
level situated above non deformed limestones and below another level, 
as thick as = 1 . 3  m, in which a top-down to the west extensional 
detachment developed and gave Origin to a typical tectonic melange; 
(3) - The mushrooms push-up and deform the melange, and are 
tectonic structures (diapirs) that evolved soon after the onset of 
displacement along the detachment; (4) - The diapirs result from 
viscous flow in the evaporites, under a progressive down-suction of the 
layers back in the direction of an imaginary central point within the 
mushrooms - a centripetal movement leading to contraction of the 
layers by underthrust and formation of the rim synclines that exist all 
around. A sequence of progressive tectonic events has been 
established: 1 - A ~ 10 m-thick wedge of layers of evaporite, limestone 

and shale / argillite moved to the west, above the extensional 
detachment. Intra- and inter-layer slip within the wedge resulted in 
folding and fracturing of the layers and formed the Broken Beds. 2 - 
Heat due to friction along the basal detachment found the easiest way 
to dissipate along the evaporite layers situated below, generating the 
diapirs by thermal convection. 3 - Tilting of the whole set of Purbeck 
Beds to the north, as the result of the ultimate tectonic inversion of the 
Wessex Basin, with further movement within the Broken Beds 
contributing for its final chaotic appearance. 

Acknowledgements This and the companion paper result from 
field work that I carried out at three opportunities, in parallel with my 
PhD research (RHUL, Egham-UK, 1989-1992). I acknowledge CNPq- 
Brazil for Grants 200025/88-3, 301102/92-9, 400037/93-9 and 
520.241/95-9. Dr. I, Davison and Dr. D. Bosence (RHUL) are much 
thanked for introducing me to the Fossil Forest outcrop and for their 
highly valuable supervision during a field excursion across the Wessex 
Basin (1990). Prof. K.R. McClay, my PhD supervisor, is much thanked 
for discussing the geology of the outcrop during a special meeting at 
his house, by December, 1995. He is also thanked for providing key 
references on the geology of the Purbeck Beds, together with Dr. T. 
Liverton, my colleague during the PhD years and during his lectures at 
the Universidade de Brasilia (UnB; 1996-1997). Prof. R.A. Fuck 
(UnB) and an anonymous referee (RBG) are much thanked for review 
and criticism of both manuscripts.
