Resumo 

As invasões biológicas são uma das maiores ameaças à biodiversidade e aos ecossistemas marinhos 

nos dias de hoje. A introdução de espécies não-indígenas começou a ser comum no início do século XX 

devido ao grande aumento do tráfego marítimo decorrente da globalização. Regra-geral, a introdução 

de novas espécies não é propositada. Grande parte dos indivíduos pioneiros são transportados em águas 

de lastro ou viajam encrustados em navios transoceânicos. Os indivíduos transportados para fora da sua 

zona original de distribuição podem assumir um estatuto de espécie invasora se detiverem determinadas 

características: elevada resiliência a mudanças ambientais, grandes taxas de recrutamento e crescimento, 

grande variabilidade genética, curto período de gestação, maturidade sexual precoce, grande capacidade 

reprodutiva e/ou uma dieta muito diversificada.  

A costa sudeste do Brasil, onde este estudo foi desenvolvido, não apresenta formações recifais de 

coral, contudo existem algumas espécies de coral na região, como é o caso do coral cérebro endémico 

Mussismilia hispida e do coral invasor Tubastraea spp.  

Este trabalho tem como principal objetivo perceber de que forma o coral invasor, Tubastraea spp., 

influencia a estrutura da comunidade local e o seu impacto na teia trófica. Para tal, foram desenvolvidos 

dois estudos em paralelo, no verão de 2017. O primeiro visa compreender como a presença de coral-sol 

influencia a macrofauna associada ao substrato rochoso, tendo em conta três coberturas de coral 

diferentes (0%, 50%, 100%), em dois locais distintos na Ilha de Búzios, SP, Brasil (capítulo 2). Enquanto 

que o segundo trabalho pretende caracterizar a teia trófica facilitada pelo coral-sol e elucidar se o bivalve 

invasor Leiosolenus aristatus recebe alimento do seu anfitrião, Tubastraea spp (capítulo 3). Ambos os 

estudos focam questões em aberto sobre o efeito do coral-sol como engenheiro ecossistémico na região. 

O género Tubastraea refere-se a um coral ahermatípico e azooxantelado, pertencente à ordem 

Scleractinia. É o único género de escleractíneos a invadir o Brasil atualmente, tendo uma alta taxa de 

invasão que o torna numa das maiores ameaças à biodiversidade marinha local. Coral-sol é a designação 

em português, devido à disposição dos seus pólipos e coloração amarela/alaranjada. As principais 

espécies a ocorrerem em águas brasileiras são Tubastraea coccínea e Tubastraea tagusensis. O coral-

sol é nativo do Indo-Pacífico tendo uma vasta distribuição geográfica. O seu sucesso como espécie 

invasora advém da posse de algumas características, tais como o hermafroditismo, uma estratégia 

reprodutiva diversificada, uma elevada capacidade de fixação em substrato natural e artificial, altas taxas 

de recrutamento e crescimento, e uma preferência de assentamento em estruturas verticais. No oceano 

Atlântico, o início da sua invasão ocorreu no mar das Caraíbas (anos 1940) e o primeiro registo no Brasil 

foi nos anos 1980, numa plataforma petrolífera, na baía de Campos, a norte do estado do Rio de Janeiro.  

O Capítulo 1 introduz o tema em estudo, apresentando os principais objetivos de trabalho da tese, o 

Capítulo 2, foca o impacto do coral-sol na fauna bentónica, o Capítulo 3 descreve a teia trófica em que 

se insere o coral-sol, com recurso a análise de isótopos estáveis, e o Capítulo 4 apresenta as conclusões 

gerais e perspetivas futuras sobre este tema.   

O trabalho apresentado no Capítulo 2 contou com a recolha de amostras em dois locais distintos, 

separados por 3km, ao longo da Ilha de Búzios, São Paulo, Brasil, e duas áreas de amostragem em cada 

local, distanciadas por algumas dezenas de metros. O trabalho de campo consistiu na raspagem de três 

réplicas em cada área, em regiões saturadas pelo coral, parcialmente cobertas (aproximadamente 50% 

de cobertura) e sem presença do invasor. Todo o material recolhido foi lavado e peneirado em 9 crivos 

de malha com diâmetros decrescentes, onde ficou retida a macrofauna. Após separação, identificação e 

armazenamento da fauna encontrada, procedeu-se à análise de variáveis univariadas (abundância, 

biomassa e tamanho médio), à utilização do índice de diversidade e riqueza Shanon-Wiener e à análise

multivariada da estrutura da comunidade. Todas as análises referidas seguiram o mesmo modelo, tendo 

“coral cover” como o principal fator (“no coral, half-coral e full coral”), examinados à escala espacial 

de dois locais e duas áreas. O coral-sol provou ser um elemento de exclusão de alguns macro-

invertebrados (ex. tanaídeos, ostracodes e copépodes) e o responsável pelo declínio da abundância e 

riqueza na estrutura da comunidade local. É sugerida a existência de um cenário satisfatório, em termos 

de abundância, biomassa e riqueza, em regiões onde a presença do coral-sol é parcial ou inexistente.  

Perante os resultados obtidos, pode-se sugerir, também, que o limiar da resiliência do ecossistema 

estudado está iminente. Este estudo confirma o coral-sol como um importante engenheiro ecossistémico 

– organismo cuja presença ou atividade altera as características físicas circundantes, criando e 

modificando habitats e influenciando todas as espécies aí presentes. Medidas terão de ser tomadas 

rapidamente para evitar perdas permanentes de biodiversidade local. 

Por outro lado, a análise isotópica do ?

N apresentada no Capítulo 3 revelou que a teia trófica 

associada ao coral é maioritariamente composta por organismos filtradores e que as novas comunidades, 

após a invasão, são dominadas por seres heterotróficos, em vez de autotróficos (organismos dominantes 

antes da invasão). Para além da importante expansão do coral-sol, o mitilídeo Leiosolenus aristatus, 

nativo do mar das Caraíbas, mas com uma distribuição geográfica muito alargada, foi frequentemente 

encontrado no interior das bases rígidas do coral invasor. Tubastraea spp. e Leiosolenus aristatus são 

originários de localizações geográficas distintas, portanto a sua associação apenas ocorre em locais onde 

ambos são alóctones. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que tanto o coral-sol, como o bivalve, são 

organismos filtradores. Uma das hipóteses para a ocorrência desta associação, seria a de que o bivalve 

beneficiaria de alimento providenciado pelo coral, mas tal não se verificou. A invasão do mitilídeo é 

facilitada pelo coral, por este encontrar refúgio nas suas bases calcárias. É expectável que a continuação 

da invasão pelo coral-sol seja acompanhada pela expansão da distribuição deste bivalve invasor.  

Conclui-se que a rápida invasão do coral-sol no litoral norte de São Paulo, é uma grave ameaça à 

biodiversidade local por estar iminente uma importante alteração do ecossistema, juntamente com a 

facilitação da introdução de um bivalve invasor, competidor com outras espécies nativas. A alteração 

de habitats, pode vir a ter consequências profundas nas comunidades locais. Ambos os estudos, são 

pontos de partida para o conhecimento do impacto negativo que o coral-sol pode ter na estrutura da 

comunidade associada aos fundos rochosos, como engenheiro ecossistémico. Sugere-se a continuação 

de estudos dentro desta temática, com o intuito de aumentar o conhecimento, contribuindo para a 

eventual gestão, minimização dos impactos ou erradicação desta espécie invasora.

Abstract 

Invasive species are a serious threat to biodiversity because they displace native species, change 

community structure and food webs and alter fundamental processes (such as nutrient cycling and 

sedimentation). Any organism that is outside of its native geographic range that may or has become 

injurious to animal or human health, the economy and/or natural environment is considered as invasive 

species. Globalization (i.e. increase of the international ship traffic) is the main driver of invasive species 

introduction. Tubastraea spp., commonly designated sun coral, is an ahermatypic and azooxanthellate 

scleractinian coral, the only scleractinian which has been introduced in Brazilian waters and one of the 

most widespread invaders in the world. The present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea 

spp. in the local biological community, examining the rocky shore associated macrofauna, in an area 

under rapid invasion, at Búzios Island, São Paulo, Brazil, under three different coral coverages (0%, 

50% and 100%) (chapter 2) and characterizing the food web associated with Tubastraea spp., using 

stable isotopes (chapter 3), during the summer of 2017. Chapter 1 introduces the basis for this work and 

describes the main aims of this thesis. Chapter 2 investigates the impact of the sun coral on the benthic 

macrofauna, chapter 3 describes the food web where this coral is included, and chapter 4 presents the 

main conclusions and future perspectives. 

The alteration of mobile invertebrate assemblages according to the degree of sun-coral space 

occupation was examined on vertical walls (with 3 different coral cover levels) and the differences found 

among two study sites and areas, within each study site were examined. It was observed that the sun 

coral may exclude major invertebrate groups (i.e. tanaids, ostracods and copepods). Abundance, biomass 

and richness of associated macrofaunal species declined in areas saturated by the sun coral, confirming 

that this coral is an ecosystem engineer. 

The structure of the food web associated to the colonies of Tubastraea spp was previously unknwon. 

At the basis of this coral another invasive species is very often found, the bivalve Leiosolenus aristatus, 

a borer species that perforates the base of hard corals. Stable isotopic analysis was applied to all 

organisms occurring at the microhabitat built by Tubastraea spp. to 1) provide the first trophic 

characterization of the food web facilitated by Tubastraea spp., while also 2) elucidating if L. aristatus 

receives nutrition from its coral host Tubastraea spp. Stable isotopic analyses showed that the food web 

that accompanies this invasive coral seems to be mostly composed of suspension feeders, confirming 

that the new community established after Tubastraea spp. invasion is dominated by heterotrophs. It was 

also concluded that both Tubastraea spp. and L. aristatus are suspension feeders consuming similar 

resources. This way, L. aristatus seems to profit from the expansion of Tubastraea spp. because the 

coral provides it with a structure to live, but not a source of nutrition. As Tubastraea spp. progresses in 

its invasion of new areas, this borer bivalve should follow. 

This work describes for the first-time the impact of Tubastraea spp. on the southeast Brazilian rocky 

bottoms’ associated macrofauna and food webs. The rapid expansion of this ecosystem engineer is 

leading to the alteration of the native macrofaunal community. This work indicates that this invasion 

will result in a decline in local biodiversity and in profound alterations to the food web of subtidal rocky 

shores.

1.1 General Introduction 

1.1.1 Brazilian coastline characteristics and coral population distribution 

Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world (Rosenberg, 2018) and includes an extensive coastline. 

The Brazilian coast has approximately 10800Km – from Cape Orange (4° N) to Chui (34°S) (Amaral et 

al., 2016). To define all the Brazilian coast, AB’SÁBER (2003) divided the Brazilian coast in six sectors: 

Equatorial Amazonian Coast, North Northeast, East Northeast, East, Southeast, and South. The Northern 

region (constituted by dunes, extensive sandy beaches with a considerable amount of rivers flowing 

down, being the Amazon River mouth one of the greatest and most complex in the world); the Northeast 

region (with more narrow beaches with sandstones reefs, which are often associated with calcareous 

algae and corals reefs); beaches with fine to very fine sand can be found in the Eastern region of the 

country;  and the Southeast (where our study was carried out, at the north shore of São Paulo), which is 

the most diverse and rugged coastal sector in the country, having distinct morphological characteristics 

from the northern and southern regions (Amaral et al., 2016). Temperate shallow reefs are mainly 

covered by large browns macroalgae (Vermeij, 1978; Witman &amp;amp; Dayton, 2001), while tropical and 

subtropical reefs are dominated by a complex mosaic of very diverse assemblages of small macroalgae, 

mostly red and colonial fouling invertebrates (Witman &amp;amp; Dayton, 2001; Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004; 

Porter et al., 2013). 

Leão &amp;amp; Dominguez (2000) described the tropical Brazilian Coral Reefs as “one of the most 

prominent marine ecosystems, particularly because of the unique character of its low-diversity coral 

fauna which is rich in endemic species”. This statement indicates the great importance of Brazilian Coral 

Reefs. They are distributed from 0°50’S to 18°00’S (Leão et al., 2016). In the Southeastern and Southern 

regions, from the mouth of the Doce River (19º 30’S) to the coast of the state of São Paulo, no coral 

reef is known, although corals are present, including the endemic brain coral species Mussismilia hispida 

(Migotto, 1995; Migotto et al., 1999; Creed, 2006, Leão et al., 2016).  

Despite the heterogeneous distribution of corals along the Brazilian coast, corals can be found almost 

all over the coastline. The great latitudinal variance of the Brazilian coastline is under the influence of 

a diverse set of oceanographic and ecological conditions. Locally, areas may be under the continuous 

influence of the oligotrophic tropical waters of the Brazilian Current, or seasonally affected by upwelling 

of cold, nutrient-rich waters (Ekau &amp;amp; Knoppers, 1999). The nature of the substrate varies from rocky, 

to considerable coral cover, conferring the Brazilian coast a great diversity of ecosystems and associated 

species (Floeter et al., 2001). 

 

1.1.2 Invasive species 

The term “invasive species” is commonly used in the field of  “invasion ecology theory”, but can be 

subjectively interpreted (Colautti &amp;amp; Macisaac, 2004). Non-indigenous species are those which can be 

found outside off their native range, usually introduced by human activity (Colautti &amp;amp; Macisaac, 2004). 

Alien, exotic, non-native and allochthonous species are all synonyms of non-indigenous species (NIS), 

according to (Olenin et al., 2010). NIS can have four main stages: “localized and numerically rare”, 

“widespread but rare”, “localized but dominant” or “widespread and dominant” (Olenin et al., 2010). 

Invasive species are included in the “widespread and dominant” stage of NIS because they are able to 

fix, to develop, to reproduce and to compete actively outside of their native range (Colautti &amp;amp; Macisaac 

2004; Olenin et al., 2010). That means that invasive species are NIS, which are locally dominant and 

widespread (Colautti &amp;amp; Macisaac, 2004).  



 

4 
 

Invasive species are a serious threat to the local biodiversity community because they “displace 

native species, change community structure and food webs and alter fundamental processes (such as 

nutrient cycling and sedimentation)” (Molnar et al., 2008). Hereupon, it is acceptable to define invasive 

species as “any organism that is outside of its native geographic range that may or has become injurious 

to animal or human health, the economy and/or natural environment” (Ziska et al., 2011).  

Due to the increase in human population in the last decades, “many species have invaded and continue 

to invade new regions at an unprecedented rate, exerting strong impacts on ecosystems and human 

welfare” (Kleunen et al., 2010). Globalization is the main driver of invasive species introduction, the 

major vector being the international ship traffic (Murray et al., 2011; Chainho et al., 2015). Invasive 

species have some general characteristics in common, such as environmental tolerance, high genetic 

variability, short generation time, early sexual maturity, high reproductive capacity, and a broad diet 

(Essink &amp;amp; Dekker, 2002; Parker et al., 2013). All these attributes, together with proliferation in 

ecosystems without natural enemies, provide the ideal conditions for the highly successful establishment 

of the species in new regions and, consequently, for the invasion in those areas (Torchin et al., 2003). 

Typically, invasive species have a rapid establishment rate on non-invaded areas because of their 

great capacity for rapid dispersal and colonization. This phenomenon is accelerated in marine 

environments, due to the lack of natural barriers, leading to a risk of native biological heritage loss (Ruiz 

et al., 2000; Secord, 2003; Sammarco et al., 2010). On the other hand, there are some studies that support 

that NIS cannot be harmful to the native species, and invasional meltdowns can occur (Simberloff &amp;amp; 

Holle, 1999; Parker et al., 2013). 

 

1.1.3 The sun coral (genus Tubastraea Lesson, 1829) and the beginning of its invasion 

The present study focuses on the ahermatypic/azooxanthellate scleractinian coral, of the genus 

Tubastraea Lesson, 1829 (Order: Scleractinia Bourne, 1900; Suborder: Dendrophylliina Vaughan and 

Wells, 1943; Familly: Dendrophylliidae Gray, 1847), commonly called “sun coral” or “orange cup 

coral” because of its orange/yellow pigmentation (De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2004; Sammarco et al., 2010).  

The natural range of the sun coral Tubastraea spp. is the Indo-Pacific region and it has two main species 

(T. coccinea and T. tagusensis), which are at the epicentre of the invasion (Creed et al., 2016), even 

though T. coccinea had a greater research effort by the scientific community. In general terms, both are 

hermaphrodites with a vast reproductive strategy, with sexual and asexual reproduction, both have a 

great planulae release, a great fixing capacity in natural (cave ceilings and undersides of big rocks) or 

artificial (dock pilings and buoys) substract, high recruitment and growth rates and settlement preference 

in vertical surfaces (Cairns, 2000; Creed &amp;amp; De Paula, 2007; De Paula et al., 2014; Mizrahi et al., 2014 

(b)). However, there are some differences between both species, such as that T. tagusensis seems to be 

more sensitive to environmental changes (e.g. water temperature variation), the depths at which they 

can occur (T. coccinea from 1 to 110 m in its native range and until 16m at Ilhabela, Brazil; T. tagusensis 

from 3 to 43 m in Galapagos region and until 15m in Ilhabela, Brazil), the growth rate (T. coccinea with 

1.01 cm/year against 0.92 cm/year in Brazil), as well as it being documented that T. coccinea has a 

longer reproductive period than T. tagusensis (Wells, 1982; Glynn &amp;amp; De Weerdt, 1991; Creed &amp;amp; De 

Paula, 2007; De Paula et al., 2014; Mizrahi, 2014; Creed et al., 2016). Sun coral (a direct translation of 

coral-sol in Portuguese) is the term that has been used, by researchers in Brazil, when referring to the 

two Tubastraea species (Mangelli &amp;amp; Creed, 2012; De Paula et al., 2014; Creed et al., 2017) invading 

Brazilian shores. Independently of the species, all of the previously mentioned features make the sun 

coral the most rapidly invading species of the Brazilian rocky shore, negatively affecting the native 



 

5 
 

biodiversity, as evidenced by the decreasing population of the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia 

hispida. (Creed, 2006).  

The sun coral invasion started in the Caribbean Sea (first recorded in 1943 by Vaughan &amp;amp; Wells) and 

began its descent towards Southwestern Atlantic (late 1980s), passing by the Gulf of Mexico and Florida 

(1977) ( Cairns, 2000; Castro et al., 1999; Fenner &amp;amp; Banks, 2004; De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2004). De Paula 

&amp;amp; Creed (2004), reported that the orange cup coral invasion in Brazil started in the late 1980s, when 

some specimens were found at offshore oil platforms in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro State, at 

the Campos oil basin. After that, colonies were identified in Ilha Grande bay (1990s) and Itajaí, Santa 

Catarina State (2000). Joel Creed (2016) and his colleagues concluded that T. coccinea is native in the 

Indo-Pacific, cryptogenic in the North Pacific and North-eastern Atlantic, and invasive in the Caribbean 

Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern Atlantic. On the other hand, it is possible to assume that T. 

tagusensis has a significantly smaller distribution around the world, being native to the Galapagos, 

cryptogenic in Indo-Pacific and Persian Gulf, and invasive in Southwestern Atlantic. It is important to 

mention that the sampling region for the present study was São Paulo’s north shore where the first sun 

coral colonies were recorded in Ilhabela, between 2008 and 2010. (Mantelatto et al., 2011).  

 

1.1.4 The sun coral as an ecosystem engineer   

“Ecosystem engineer” can be defined as “an organism whose presence or activity alters the physical 

surroundings or changes the flow of resources, creating or modifying habitats and influencing all 

associated species” and that “modulates the availability of resources to other species, by causing 

physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials, so, they modify, maintain and create habitats” (Jones 

et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1997). The “ecosystem engineering” concept proposed by Jones et al., (1994, 

1997) was accepted by some authors (Dangerfield et al., 1998; Casas-Crivillé &amp;amp; Valera, 2005; Wild et 

al., 2011), trivialized by others (Holdsworth et al., 2007; Menge et al., 2008), criticized (Reichman &amp;amp; 

Seabloom, 2002) and updated by Andrew Wilby (2002). This concept caught the attention of many 

ecologists, for the most varied reasons. 

The present study will use the concept given by Jones (1994, 1997), exploring the idea that an 

ecosystem engineer is responsible for changing the ecosystem, being a biodiversity mechanism of 

exclusion or facilitation. Ferreira (2003) and Lages et al. (2011) reported the important impact of 

Tubastraea spp. on native local biodiversity of Brazilian rocky shores. Creed (2006) showed how the 

sun coral can cause tissue necrosis on the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia hispida and 

highlighted the possibility of sponges, coralline algae and even sun coral recruits overgrowing in the 

invaded regions (Creed, 2006).   

 

1.1.5 Aims and scopes of the dissertation 

Given that the sun coral is an important invasive species in the Southwestern Atlantic, and that its 

proliferation in non-native regions is a serious threat to the local biodiversity maintenance (Lages et al., 

2011; Silva et al., 2011; Mizrahi et al., 2014 (a)), it is important to understand the impact of this invasion 

and its trophic role in the rocky shore ecosystem. 

The present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological 

community, examining the rocky shore associated macrofauna under three different levels of coral 

coverage (100%, 50% and 0%), (chapter 2) and to characterize the food web associated with Tubastraea 

spp., using stable isotopes (chapter 3), in an area under rapid invasion, southeast Brazil.

Impacts of the sun coral invasion on the structure of mobile invertebrate 

assemblages in a tropical rocky reef 

2.1 Abstract 

Invasive species are a serious threat to the local biodiversity community because they displace native 

species, change community structure and food webs and alter fundamental processes (such as nutrient 

cycling and sedimentation). Tubastraea spp., commonly designed as sun coral, is an ahermatypic and 

azooxanthellate scleractinian coral, being the only scleractinian which has been introduced in Brazilian 

waters, one of the most widespread invaders and it is becoming a serious threat to the local biodiversity. 

The present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological community, 

examining 1) the associated macrofauna on vertical rocky reef substrates with 3 different coral cover 

(0%, 50% and 100%) and 2) understand the differences found among study sites (PEL and POL) and 

areas (PEL1 and PEL 2; POL1 and POL 2), during the Summer of 2017 in an area under rapid invasion, 

at Búzios Island, SP, Brazil. It was observed that sun coral may exclude (i.e. tanaids, ostracods and 

copepods) major invertebrate groups. Abundance, biomass and richness declined in areas saturated by 

the sun coral. The potential role of sun coral as an ecosystem engineer for the local community structure 

was confirmed.

2.2 Introduction 

In general, corals are considered extremely sensitive to environmental change and have low survival 

rates during transport (Lages et al., 2011). The sun coral, Tubastraea spp., belongs to the group of 

organisms that seems to have a great resilience to environmental exchanges, high recruitment and 

growth rates – the invasive species main features that allow them to invade (Bax et al., 2003). The sun-

coral is the only scleractinian that is invasive in Brazilian waters (De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2005).  

The Brazilian southeast coast has a great ecosystem complexity, with a wide range of habitats and 

reefs mainly covered by small macroalgal beds and associated macrofauna, which are the primary 

production and primary consumers, respectively. Lubchenko (1978) demonstrate that the abundance and 

algae species are controlled by marine herbivorous. Moderate grazing allows inferior algal species to 

persist and intense grazing eliminates most individuals and species. The effect of this consumers on 

plant species diversity depends on the relationship between herbivore food preference and competitive 

abilities of the plants. Space has been shown to be a primary limiting resource in many rocky intertidal 

communities (Paine, 1966; Lubchenco &amp;amp; Menge, 1978).  

On rocky bottoms ecosystems it is possible to find communities of sessile benthic invertebrates and 

macroalgae matrix, both with different associated macrofauna and algae species, which will attract 

diverse species of consumers with diversified food habits. The precise consumer effect, probably, 

depends on the relationship between its preferences and food’s competitive abilities and on the intensity 

of the grazing or predation pressure (Lubchenko, 1978). Mobile invertebrates such as small crustaceans 

(copepods, tanaids, ostracods, amphipods and isopods), bivalves, gastropods and polychaetas are, 

mainly, detritivores and suspension feeders, fundamental organisms for primary predators such as 

juvenile fishes, included fishes with high economic value (Floeter et al., 2007). Coasts invaded by the 

sun coral in Brazil have changed from being dominated by macroalgae and zooxanthellate cnidarians to 

being dominated by this azooxanthellate hard coral, thus changing from autotrophic to heterotrophic 

communities (Lages et al., 2011). 

Scleractinian corals are ecosystem engineers that create microhabitats and modify nearby physical 

and chemical processes because they are principle architects (Lages et al., 2011). Tubastraea spp, once 

established, tends to dominate altering community structure and function (De Paula, 2007, Miranda et 

al., 2016). An ecosystem engineer can be considered as an organism responsible for creating or 

modifying habitats, influencing all associated species around (Jones et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1997). 

Autogenic and allogenic engineers are the two main groups of ecosystem engineers (Jones et al., 1994). 

Corals, in general, are considered autogenic engineers whose alter the surrounding environment via their 

own physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues) (Jones et al., 1994).  

Given that the sun coral is an important invasive species in the Southwestern Atlantic, and its 

proliferation in non-native regions is a serious threat to the local biodiversity maintenance (Lages et al., 

2011; Silva et al., 2011; Mizrahi et al., 2014 (a)), it is important to understand the impact of this invasion 

and its trophic role in the rocky shore ecosystem. 

The present work aimed to investigate the impact of Tubastraea spp. in the local biological 

community, examining 1) the associated macrofauna on vertical rocky reef substrates with 3 different 

coral cover (0%, 50% and 100%) and 2) understand the differences found among study sites (PEL and 

POL) and areas (PEL1 and PEL 2; POL1 and POL 2), in an area under rapid invasion, at Búzios Island, 

SP, Brazil.

2.3 Materials and Methods 

2.3.1 Study area 

This study was undertaken at Ilha de Búzios (Búzios Island: 23 48’ 11” S; 45 08’ 21” W), which 

belongs to the Ilhabela Archipelago off-shore São Sebastião, Southeastern Brazil (Fig.2.1). Búzios 

Island is 755 ha large and is inhabited by nearly 200 people. Artisanal fisheries is the main economic 

activity in the area. The island is located 8 km northwest off Ilhabela and 25 km southeast from the 

nearest mainland. A tropical climate prevails in the region, with hot and humid summers, when tropical 

storms are frequent, and a drier winter. Coastal waters are often oligotrophic to mesotrophic, with 

eventual pulses of primary production during summer, owing to episodical upwelling after prolonged 

periods of northwesterly winds, and winter, after the passage of cold fronts (Stech &amp;amp; Lorenzzetti, 1992, 

Calado et al., 2006; Ciotti et al., 2010). Coastal plumes containing large inputs of terrestrial organic 

matter are frequent after heavy rainfall, but their contribution to benthic food webs is largely unknown. 

The relative abundance of benthic macroalgae and sessile or encrusting invertebrates that dominate the 

shallow rocky reefs in the study area is given in Mizrahi et al. (2017). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3.2 Sampling 

We aimed to investigate how mobile invertebrate assemblages change according to the degree of sun 

coral space occupation. During the summer of 2017, we surveyed vertical rocky reef substrates, at a 

depth ranging from 3 to 15m, at two areas several tens of meters apart (PEL1 and PEL2; POL1 and 

POL2), within two sites nearly 3 km from each other (Pedra Lisa - PEL; S 23°47’54.2”; W 45°09’24.6”; 

and Ponta Leste - POL; S 23°48’6.79”; W 45° 7’21.65”; Fig.2.1). At each area, three replicate plots (0.5 

m
2 
quadrats) were haphazardly sampled at each of three habitat types; no coral, half coral cover (around 

50%), and full coral cover. Sun coral colonies were removed with chisels and encrusting invertebrates 

or turf / canopy-forming algae were scrapped off the substrates and suctioned using an air-lifting device 

coupled to SCUBA tanks (Munro, 2013).

2.3.3 Laboratory procedures 

All samples were vigorously washed to release mobile invertebrates from any surfaces, and then 

sieved in different size classes (mm) to obtain estimates of average individual size (i.e. 0.5-1.2, 1.2-1.7, 

1.7-2.8, 2.8-4.0, 4.0-6.3, 6.3-8.0, 8.0-12.5, 12.5-25.0). All organisms were preserved in a saline 

formaldehyde (4%) solution. Identification to main taxonomic groups and counting were carried out on 

white trays, with the naked eye, for individuals retained in the six coarser sieves (i.e. with a body size 

larger than 1.7mm), or under a dissecting microscope, for smaller individuals. Subsamples were 

obtained for size fractions retaining an exceedingly high number of individuals (n ? 150 indivuduals). 

A Folsom plankton splitter was used for this purpose because very large numbers were only observed 

for very small organisms, in the smallest fractions, that could be easily suspended in the rotating drum. 

All organisms were stored in containers with ethanol 70%. 

 

2.3.4 Data analyses 

Univariate variables abundance, biomass, average size, Shannon-Wiener diversity and richness, and 

the multivariate variable community structure, were all analysed using the same mixed linear model, 

with the fixed main factor ‘coral cover’ (no coral, half-coral cover, full coral cover), examined at both 

the ‘site’ (POL, PEL) and ‘area’ (nested in ‘site’; 1, 2) spatial scales (both random factors). For 

univariate variables, variance heterogeneity was first tested using the Cochran’s C test, appropriate data 

transformations were undertaken when needed to meet homoscedasticity, and F-ratios were obtained 

through analyses of variance. The SNK procedure was used for post-hoc comparisons to further explore 

signficant sources of variation. Community structure was examined using permutational analyses of 

variance to generate pseudo–F statistics. Data were first fourth-root transformed and the resemblance 

matrix was calculated using Bray-Curtis distances. Significant sources of variation were further 

investigated using pairwise comparisons, based on 9,999 unrestricted permutations of raw data. Non-

metric multidimensional scaling (NMDs) plots were used to visualize sample clustering.

2.4 Results 

Analyses of univariate metrics of the sampled invertebrate assemblages indicate that effects of sun-

coral are complex. There were no pervasive changes across the spatial scales tested, with differences 

among assemblages holding only at sites, separated by a few km, or only even at areas within sites, just 

tens of meters apart (Table 2.1). Abundance followed the former trend (Table 2.1; Fig. 2.2A). There was 

a clear decreasing tendency in invertebrate overall abundance from no-coral to full-coral cover habitats 

in Pedra Lisa, with statistical support for higher abundance at no-coral compared to the remainder 

habitats, while at Ponta Leste abundance was higher at the half-coral habitat compared to the others 

(SNK; p &amp;lt;0.05). Biomass contrasts were consistent in Pedra Lisa, higher on no-coral and half-coral 

compared to full-coral plots, but not in Ponta Leste, where biomass was higher on half-coral compared 

to the rest at Area 2, but no differences were observed at Area 1 (Table 2.1; Fig. 2.2B). Decreasing 

overall trends of richness, especially no-coral and half-coral compared to full-coral cover, were observed 

across areas (Fig. 2.2C) and backed by a marginal, although not significant, p-value (0.067; Table 2.1). 

Processes not addressing here and operating at the ‘area’ spatial scale (Table 2.1), were important and 

probably masked any effects of the sun-coral cover. No effects on average individual size or diversity 

were detected (Table 2.1). 

 

 

Sixteen major taxonomic groups were found in this study (Fig. 2.3). Amphipods, polychaetes and 

tanaids clearly dominated target assemblages, followed by copepods, ostracods, isopods, gastropods and 

bivalves which were common, and brachyuran crabs and ophiuroids which were only occasional. Other 

five groups, i.e. nemerteans, nematodes, hermit crabs, caridean shrimps and sea urchins, accounted 

separately for less than 1% of the whole sample and were considered rare.

Changes in community structure were also intricate and ‘area’ specific (Table 2.2). Again, samples 

obtained from plots with no or only half-coral cover tend to cluster together, aside from samples from 

full-coral cover plots (Fig. 2.4). The exception is Area 1 at Pedra Lisa (Fig. 2.4A). Pairwise comparisons 

did not however fully support visual trends. Marginal p-values, between 0.093 and 0.104, were obtained 

for contrasts of no coral vs. half-coral cover (PEL1; Fig. 2.4A), no coral vs. full-coral cover (PEL1, 

PEL2, POL1, POL2; Fig. 2.4A-D), and half-coral vs. full-coral cover (PEL2, POL2; Fig. 2.4B,D). Seven 

taxonomic groups contributed substantially (above 10%) to at least one pairwise comparison, and 2 to 

3 groups were typically responsible for cumulative 50% dissimilarity across comparisons (SIMPER; 

Table 2.3). The abundance of taxonomic groups contributing the most to dissimilarities in each area is 

shown in Figure 2.5. Abundance patterns of tanaids (Fig. 2.5A-C), ostracods (Fig. 2.5A-B) copepods 

(Fig. 2.5B-C) and, to a lesser extent, gastropods (Fig. 2.5D) apparently underlie the clustering of no-

coral and half-coral cover plots, apart from full-coral cover plots. The distribution of polychaetes follows 

a similar pattern, except for PEL1 (Fig. 2.5C). Exceedingly high variance to average ratios precluded a 

clear interpretation of the patterns observed for amphipods and isopods (Fig. 2.5 C-D).

2.5 Discussion 

This study reports for the first time the effects of invasive sun corals on mobile invertebrate 

assemblages inhabiting subtropical rocky reefs, otherwise dominated by native colonial fouling 

invertebrates, algal turfs and canopy of varying complexity. Although there were some spatial 

inconsistencies at different scales, a case is made for a frequent tipping point between half and full coral 

cover, beyond which main taxonomic groups (i.e. tanaids, copepods and ostracods) become much less 

abundant or collapse. Most vertical or nearly-vertical walls at Búzios Island present a sun-coral cover 

varying within this range, indicating that resilience to further increase of sun coral abundance is very 

unlikely.   

Changes in the abundance and of main invertebrate groups and community structure are apparently 

related to the loss of the intricate physical structure of several native fouling species, as the sun coral 

cover becomes predominant. Compared to temperate shallow reefs where most complex habitat consists 

of large brown macroalgal beds, namely fucoids and kelps (Vermeij, 1978; Witman &amp;amp; Dayton, 2001), 

tropical and subtropical rocky reefs are usually dominated by a complex mosaic of very diverse 

assemblages of small macroalgae, mostly red, colonial fouling invertebrates, such as sponges, ascidians 

and bryozoans, and both soft and hard corals (Witman &amp;amp; Dayton, 2001; Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004; 

Porter et al., 2013). In southeastern Brazil, filamentous and articulated coralline algal turfs, together 

with canopy-forming algae such as Sargassum, Hypnea, Laurencia and Padina build up major habitats 

within healthy reefs (Oigman-Pszczol et al., 2004), and aggregate diverse fish assemblages (Floeter et 

al., 2007) at higher densities compared to other important coastal systems (Eggersten et al., 2017). It is 

still unclear whether fish use those reef vegetated habitats as shelter or foraging grounds, but the latter 

is very probable as seaweeds tend to aggregate very high densities of potential prey (Tano et al., 2016). 

The complex structure of most seaweeds also favours the accumulation of sediments and detritus coming 

from land by frequent rain showers and local hydrodynamics, adding environmental heterogeneity at 

spatial scales within the range of body sizes of common accompanying fauna (Airoldi, 2003). The mixed 

matrix of algal tissues and trapped sediments is preferential habitat for an array of invertebrate groups, 

including tanaids, ostracods and copepods (Berghe &amp;amp; Bergmans, 1981; Danielpool et al., 1996; Pereira 

et al., 2014). This likely explains why those groups were almost absent at patches saturated by sun corals 

in Búzios Island. Interestingly, the effects on amphipods, which include several species that directly 

graze on host algal tissues (Neckles et al., 1993; Duffy &amp;amp; Hay, 2000), were not affected in any evident 

way. This reinforces the notion that the provision of physical complexity, not the supply of algal tissues 

to mesoherbivores, drives the abundance and distribution of the main invertebrate groups found in 

samples.     

The crustacean groups that were most affected by the sun coral invasion at Ilha de Búzios are all very 

important prey for larval and juvenile nearshore fish. Tanaids were the most abundant group in areas 

with only partial or no sun coral cover. Because they rank among the most important food items for 

intermediate fish size-groups (5.0-10.0 cm; Pereira et al., 2014), their exclusion as patches develop to 

sun coral saturation may negatively impact fish populations. Tanaids have also low dispersal capacity 

(Pereira et al., 2014) and therefore migration from seaweed to coral-dominated habitat (i.e. 

recolonization) is very unlikely. Ostracods and harpacticoid copepods are not only consumed by early 

fish stages but also considered important trophic links in bentho-pelagic food webs. Ostracods are a 

major food source for many vertebrate and invertebrate species (Mbahinzireki et al., 1991) and 

harpacticoids, the most abundant copepods in this study, are an important food source for penaeid shrimp 

and many larval and juvenile fish species (Nelson &amp;amp; Coull, 1989; Pinto et al., 2001). Unlike the complex 

seaweed architecture, sun coral colonies do not provide interstitial spaces compatible to the size of small 

crustaceans, and do not retain sediments or detritus that can be used as food sources (Airoldi, 2003; 



 

24 
 

Berghe &amp;amp; Bergmans, 1981; Danielpool et al., 1996). The rapid invasion of Tubastraea spp. may 

therefore alter the nearshore trophic web and lead to the loss of endemic fauna and flora. In the worst 

case-scenario declines of small mobile invertebrate groups which are prey for demersal consumers may 

affect whole ecosystem services, particularly artisanal fisheries aiming reef species.  

Polychaetes were also affected by the presence of sun corals but this group was present in all samples, 

including patches fully covered by the orange cup coral. Effects on lower taxonomic levels, not 

addressed in this study, may underlie their generalized occurrence at the different reef habitats. 

Polychaetes exhibit remarkable functional diversity (Wouters et al., 2018), with many groups 

successfully colonizing hard bottoms (Hutchings, 1981; Gobin, 2010). On reef habitats, polychaetes are 

mostly found in crevices or holes within calcareous rock (Nogueira et al., 2001), providing shelter 

against predators and the supply of different food sources, including debris, small invertebrates and 

algae. Nogueira and Martin (2002) found that the endemic Brazilian brain coral Mussismilia hispida 

(Verril, 1868) supports a very rich and diverse assemblage of polychaetes, similarly as reported by others 

for coral habitats in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, as well as other Atlantic regions 

(Mccloskey, 1970; Kohn &amp;amp; Lloyd, 1973; Arvanitidis &amp;amp; Koukouras, 1994). While providing important 

physical structure to reef habitats, sun corals may also exert strong negative allelopathic effects. For 

instance, Creed (2006) showed that sun corals infringe necrosis on Mussismilia hispida colonies up to a 

distance of five centimetres. Negative allelopathy through the release of water-borne toxic substances 

(Coll et al., 1982; Sammarco et al., 1983; Gunthorpe &amp;amp; Cameron, 1990) may not only intensify 

interspecific competition for the occupation of primary space, but also restrict coral habitat to species 

that tolerate the presence of toxic substances to some extent. It is known that some polychaete species 

are associated to toxic sponges (Skilleter et al., 2005), and can absorb low concentrations of different 

toxins and heavy metals (Bryan &amp;amp; Hummerstone, 1971; Mebs, 1998). It is possible that the widespread 

occurrence of polychaetes over the different reef habitats at Búzios Island is a result of their generalized 

tolerance to water-borne allelochemicals. 

The trends discussed above are however prone to substantial change at the spatial scales examined. 

Most important, the effects of sun coral abundance were clearer at Pedra Lisa (PEL) compared to Ponta 

Leste (POL). PEL is a relatively sheltered area, facing north, while POL is close to the eastern end of 

Búzios Island, and thus more frequently exposed to the larger swell that build from prevailing easterly 

winds (Fontes &amp;amp; Castro, 2017). Because this coastal region is often oligotrophic (Ciotti et al. 2010), 

wind-driven upwelling and wave-action more likely impacting POL may substantially increase nutrient 

supply and the flow of feeding particles to invertebrate consumers. Those effects may partially obscure 

the effects of sun coral cover. Smaller scale inconsistencies, as shown for richness, are more difficult to 

interpret. Differences in richness are often dictated by the distribution patterns of rare groups, which, in 

turn, may reflect the occurrence of the host biogenic habitat, such as sponges, ascidians and particular 

algal canopies to name a few microhabitats that may play an important role in rocky reef systems. Even 

at nearly saturated coral patches, secondary habitat built by filamentous algae, solitary ascidians 

Phallusia nigra or even small clumps of mytilid bivalves Isognomon bicolor, may host distinct species 

assemblages. Clearly, further work is needed to tease apart potential factors that may operate at smaller 

spatial scales.  

Invasive species can be considered a great threat to marine ecosystems, displacing native species and 

ultimately causing overall changes of community structure, food-web topologies and ecosystem 

functioning (De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2005; Molnar et al., 2008). Moreover, invasive species such as sun 

corals are autogenic engineers, as long as their own physical structure modifies the surrounding 

environment (Jones et al., 1994). We report severe impacts of the sun coral invasion on populations of 

major invertebrate groups, chiefly tanaids, ostracods and copepods, deeply modifying community 



 

25 
 

structure when coral cover exceeds 50%. Our findings add to the results of Mizrahi and colleages (2016), 

who suggested higher impacts at habitat patches where the diversity of native fouling assemblages is 

highest and reinforce the perception that the sun coral invasion will have far-reaching consequences. 

Vast areas of shallow-water reef habitat at Búzios Island, as well as other places (e.g. Ilha Grande, RJ), 

are invaded by sun-corals beyond tipping point estimates and there is no evidence supporting any 

reversals of past invasive trends. Given that long-standing reef ecosystem services might be 

compromised, including artisanal fisheries, this study further highlights the need to control the sun coral 

spread and its eradication at places where its occurrence is still restricted and removal efforts feasible.

Food web associated with the habitat-modifying and invasive sun coral 

Tubastraea spp. 

 

3.1 Abstract 

The sun coral, Tubastraea spp, is an azooxanthellate coral that is rapidly invading North and South 

Atlantic tropical coasts. It is also an ecosystem engineer that once established, tends to dominate altering 

the local community structure and function. However, there are no studies on the food web associated 

to the colonies of Tubastraea spp. At the basis of this coral another invasive species is very often found, 

the bivalve Leiosolenus aristatus, a borer species that perforates the base of hard corals. Stable isotopic 

analysis was applied to all organisms occurring at the microhabitat built by Tubastraea spp to 1) provide 

the first trophic characterization of the food web facilitated by Tubastraea spp., while also 2) elucidating 

if L. aristatus receives nutrition from its coral host Tubastraea spp. Stable isotopic analyses showed that 

the food web that accompanies this invasive coral seems to be mostly composed of suspension feeders, 

confirming that the new community established after Tubastraea spp. invasion is dominated by 

heterotrophs. It was also concluded that both Tubastraea spp. and L. aristatus are suspension feeders 

consuming similar resources. This way, L. aristatus seems to profit from the expansion of Tubastraea 

spp. because the coral provides it with a structure to live, but not a source of nutrition. As Tubastraea 

spp. progresses in its invasion of new areas, this borer bivalve should follow.

3.2 Introduction 

The sun coral is the most rapidly invading species of the Brazilian rocky shore, negatively affecting 

the native biodiversity, as evidenced by the decreasing population of the endemic Brazilian brain coral 

Mussismilia hispida. (Creed, 2006). The natural range of the sun coral Tubastraea spp. is the Indo-

Pacific region and it has two main species (T. coccinea and T. tagusensis), which are at the epicentre of 

the invasion in Brazil (Creed et al., 2016). The two species are very difficult to distinguish and thus we 

will refer to them as Tubastraea spp. The sun coral invasion started in the Caribbean Sea (first recorded 

in 1943 by Vaughan &amp;amp; Wells) and began its descent towards Southwestern Atlantic (late 1980s), passing 

by the Gulf  of Mexico and Florida (1977) (Castro et al., 1999; Cairns, 2000; De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2004; 

Fenner &amp;amp; Banks, 2004). In Brazil, the first sun coral colonies were found in offshore oil platforms in 

Campos oil basin, Rio de Janeiro. Is notorious the rapid invasion by the scleractinian along the Brazilian 

shore, from north to south, in the last thirty years (De Paula &amp;amp; Creed, 2004; Mantelatto et al., 2011). 

In general terms, both species are hermaphrodites with a vast reproductive strategy – with sexual and 

asexual reproduction –, early reproductive maturity, a great planulae release, a great fixing capacity in 

natural (cave ceilings and undersides of big rocks) or artificial (dock pilings and buoys) substrate, high 

recruitment and growth rates and settlement preference in vertical surfaces (Cairns, 2000; Creed &amp;amp; De 

Paula 2007; De Paula et al. 2014; Mizrahi et al. 2014 (b); Creed et al., 2016). The orange cup coral is, 

also, able to produce antifouling chemical compounds which prevent the fish and invertebrate predation 

(Creed et al., 2017). All the features previously mentioned, are the responsible for giving the “invasive 

species” status to the sun coral, thus, are gathered all the conditions for a successful and rapid 

establishment and proliferation in regions outside of their native range. An example of the rapid 

expansion of this coral (De Paula et al., 2014) is the notorious invasion in areas where the presence of 

sun coral was rare and started to be abundant or dominant and, was estimated, in Ilha Grande (RJ, Brazil) 

region an expansion rate of 2.1km/year (Lages et al., 2011; Creed et al., 2017).  

Little is known about the relationship established between borer bivalves and the organisms they 

perforate. Leiosolenus aristatus (Dillwyn, 1817) is a borer bivalve which its native range is the 

Caribbean Sea but with a large worldwide distribution. Is possible to find this specimen in the Pacific 

and Atlantic Ocean (from Portugal to Senegal on the North Atlantic and from North Carolina to 

Venezuela in the Western part of the Atlantic) (Simone &amp;amp; Gonçalves, 2006; Lopes., 2011). In Brazil, 

the first record of the invasion was in 2005 in two States, Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo (Simone &amp;amp; 

Gonçalves, 2006). Leiosolenus aristatus is the accepted scientific name nowadays but the genus of this 

mytilid it was, already, recognize as Litophaga (Röding, 1798) and Myoforceps (Fischer 1886) (Lopes, 

2011). Despite this species had been several names in the past, its primary recognition is very simple if 

we look to the pointed, crossed tips at the posterior part of the shells, which cross like fingers (Lopes, 

2011; Ignacio et al, 2012). The preferential habitat of the bivalve is hard surfaces, such as shells, corals 

and barnacles (Lopes, 2011), boring substrata and soft rocks from intertidal to 5m depth (Simone &amp;amp; 

Gonçalves, 2006; Ignacio et al., 2012). Having regard to the preferred habitat, is acceptable to admit 

that we are talking about a species which needs to perforate to survive. Such perforation may have 

possible damage to native species, because the “datemussels” (common name for the posterior part of 

the shells being crossed like fingers) perforate the living shells, causing deformation of the host and 

even its death (Simone &amp;amp; Gonçalves, 2006). Because of its habit of penetrating corals and because its 

presence often goes unnoticed initially, it may significantly change the structure of local coral 

communities and is considered an invasive species (Lopes, 2011). Mariculture can be the primary (even 

if is not an intended biological introduction vector) vector for the introduction of the species in the 

Brazilian coast but, also, ballast water and hull fouling are other potential vectors (Ignacio et al., 2012). 



 

33 

L. aristatus is native to the tropical Northwest Atlantic, thus the two species (the bivalve and the sun 

coral) do not overlap at their native distribution range. The association between the two only occurs 

when their invasive ranges of distribution meet. There is no information on the trophic relations between 

these two invasive species. 

Stable isotopic analysis was applied to all macro-organisms occurring at the microhabitat built by 

Tubastraea spp. agglomerates to 1) provide the first trophic characterization of the food web facilitated 

by Tubastraea spp. while also 2) elucidating if L. aristatus receives nutrition from its coral host 

Tubastraea spp. 

 

3.3 Materials and Methods  

3.3.1 Study area 

The study area is in the Búzios Island (23 48’ 11” S; 45 08’ 21” W), off the southeast coast of Brazil 

(Fig.3.1). The island has 7.5 km
2
 and is scarcely inhabited, mostly by traditional fishermen. The climate 

is wet tropical. Summers in this area are typically warm and wet, with frequent tropical storms. The 

numerous heavy rain showers (often more than once a day) mean that the input of terrestrial matter is 

highly variable on a fine temporal and spatial scale. This way, punctual collection of particulate matter 

(POM) for stable isotope analyses will necessarily result in highly variable values. This also applies to 

phytoplankton and zooplankton. For this reason, sampling did not include POM, phytoplankton and 

zooplankton.

3.3.2 Sampling 

Sampling took place during summer, in February of 2017, at two sites, PEL (S 23°47?54.2” - W 

45°09?24.6”) and POL (S 23°48?6.79“- W 45° 7?21.65“) distanced approximately 3 km (Fig 3.1). Both 

sites have vertical rock walls covered with Tubastraea spp. At each site, a diver collected all organisms, 

with a chisel and an air-lifting device coupled to SCUBA tanks (Munro, 2013), from two 0.5 m
2
 squares 

distanced approximately 5 m. Sampling was conducted at a mean depth of 5 m. Samples were preserved 

on ice and taken to the laboratory at CEBIMar (Centre for Marine Biology of the University of São 

Paulo).  

 

3.3.3 Laboratory Procedures 

Tentacles of Tubastraea spp. were plotted for stable isotope analysis. Muscle tissue samples were 

dissected from molluscs and crustaceans. Tissues of all species were dried at 60ºC and ground to fine 

powder with a mortar and pestle. 

The isotopes analysed were ?
13

C and ?
15

N. These isotopes are commonly used for the description of 

food webs in a wide variety of ecosystems because they allow the estimation of the food sources used 

by organisms over time, allowing a characterization of their feeding habits and trophic levels (Peterson 

et al., 1985; Riera &amp;amp; Richard, 1996; Kwak &amp;amp; Zedler, 1997; Baeta et al., 2009; Vinagre et al., 2015).     

The carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of the samples was determined using a Flash EA 1112 

Series elemental analyser coupled on line via Finningan ConFlo III interface to a Thermo delta V S mass 

spectrometer. The carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios are expressed in delta (?) notation, defined as the 

parts per thousand (‰), a deviation from a standard material (PDB limestone for ?

3.3.4 Data Analysis 

Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to test if Tubastraea spp, L. aristatus and 

Cassostrea virginica showed isotopic differences. Both Tubastraea spp, L. aristatus have never been 

isotopically characterized, so we compared their values not only between each other but also with the 

oyster C. virginica, which is a well-known suspension feeder and could thus be used as a reference. The 

ANOVA assumptions were previously investigated. Normality was investigated through the Shapiro-

Wilk's test and homoscedasticity through Levene's test. A significance level of 0.05 was considered in 

all test procedures.

3.4 Results 

The food web associated with Tubastraea spp. seems to be dominated by primary consumers, most 

of them suspension feeders, like the ascidian Phallusia nigra, the sun sponge Hymeniacidon heliophila, 

the barnacle Tetraclita stalacifera and the oyster Crassostrea virginica.  

Eleven species/groups were analysed in this study (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). Two macroalgae were 

analysed, the red macroalgae Amphiroa sp. and “turf”, a mix of small intertwined filamentous 

macroalgae that are difficult to separate and were thus analysed as a bulk. Amphiroa sp. is clearly not 

contributing to this food web, since its isotopic values are clearly distinct from those of all consumers. 

The isotopic values of the mix we called “turf” are consistent with it being consumed by the two non-

suspension feeding species analysed, the speck-claw decorator crab Omalacantha bicornuta and the sea 

snail Morula nodulosa (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). Worms of the Nereididae family may also be feeding on 

turf. The barnacle Tetraclita stalactifera is also a well-known suspension feeder, however its isotopic 

values are more enriched in ?
13

C, than the other suspension feeders analysed (Table 3.1, Fig 3.2). The 

isotopic values of Tubastraea spp., L. aristatus and C. virginica did not present significant differences, 

neither in ?
15

3.5 Discussion 

This work shows that the food web associated with the sun coral is dominated by primary consumers, 

most of them suspension feeders, like ascidians, sponges, bivalves and barnacles, confirming the work 

by Lages et al. (2011), which stated that invaded rocky shores in Brazil change from being dominated 

by macroalgae and zooxanthellate cnidarians, autotrophic organisms, to being dominated by 

heterotrophic organisms. Furthermore, the non-suspension feeders analysed in the present study were 

also heterotrophic organisms, the gastropod M. nodulosa, polychaetes from the Nereididae family and 

the crab O. bicornuta. 

The only autotrophs found were the macroalgae Amphiroa sp and the mix of filamentous algae we 

designated by “turf”. Fractionation at the base of this food web seems to be within what is usually 

assumed between trophic levels, which is an increase in 2.5-4.5 from prey to predator (Owens, 1987; 

Peterson &amp;amp; Fry, 1987). That can be observed between ascidians, sponges, “turf”, and the primary 

consumers, namely M. nodulosa, Nereididae polychaetes and O. bicornuta. However, the distinct 

isotopic values of Amphiroa sp indicate that this species does not contribute as nutrition for the primary 

consumers. Only ascidians, sponges and “turf” had isotopic values consistent with being consumed by 

organisms higher up the food web.  

It must be pointed out that Tubastraea spp. isotopic values do not rule it out as a potential food source 

for the primary consumers analysed in the present study, quite the opposite, its values are very similar 

to those of other species (sponges) that were pointed as probable food sources for the primary 

consumers. However, this species has been described as having no natural predators (Campbell, 1983). 

Its rapid invasion capacity certainly suggests that it is free from predation, however studies on the 

feeding behaviour of the gastropods, polychaetes and small crustaceans observed here, should elucidate 

if Tubastraea spp. has a role as food source for any consumers in its associated food web. Since no 

significant differences, neither in ?
15

N, nor in ?
13

C, were detected among Tubastraea spp., L. aristatus 

and C. virginica, it can be concluded that they share the same food source or a similar mix of food 

sources. Since, the oyster C. virginica, is a well-known suspension feeder, it can be concluded that these 

species are probably also feeding on suspended materials. The barbacle, T. stalactifera is also a well-

known suspension feeder, however its isotopic values were very distinct from those of the previously 

mentioned suspension feeders. T. stalactifera presented considerably more enriched ?
13

C values. 

This wide difference in ?
13

C values at the food web basis is common in other coastal food webs and 

indicates the existence of two energy pathways, pelagic and benthic (Darnaude, 2005; Le Loc’h et al., 

2008; Vinagre et al., 2015). The pelagic pathway originates in the photosynthetic activity from 

phytoplankton while the benthic pathways is based on detritus, carried from by currents and/or 

transported by terrestrial drainage (Rafaelli &amp;amp; Hawkins, 1999). Marine producers (especially 

phytoplankton) have more enriched ?
13

C values than terrestrial primary producers, this way allowing 

the tracing of the origin of carbon in coastal environments (Haines &amp;amp; Montague, 1979; Riera &amp;amp; Richard, 

1996; Bouillon et al., 2000). T. stalactifera enriched ?
13

C values in comparison to the other suspension 

feeders indicates that this species is probably mainly consuming phytoplankton, while the others are 

mostly consuming detritus. 

Since the isotopic evidence presented here suggests that L. aristatus is a suspension-feeder, feeding 

on the same source as its host Tubastraea spp. it can be concluded that this invasive borer bivalve has 

its invasion facilitated by Tubastraea spp. because the coral provides structural refuge, not because it is 

a source of nutrition. As the coral expands its invasion range, it creates a structural niche for the invasive 

bivalve to occupy. It should thus be expected that L. aristatus will follow Tubastraea spp. as it rapidly 

invades new coasts.

4.1 Final Considerations 

The present work demonstrates, for the first time, how the sun coral can act as an ecosystem engineer, 

both affecting the rocky bottoms associated macrofauna and the local food web structure. The results 

suggest a higher abundance, diversity and richness of species in areas without or partially covered by 

the sun-coral and on macroinvertebrates, such as tanaids, ostracods and copepods. On the other hand, 

an invasive bivalve is often found on the hard basis of Tubastraea spp. and the community structure 

associated to the sun coral is, mainly, composed by heterotrophs instead of autotrophs organisms. These 

are clear evidences that the sun coral is an ecosystem engineer, acting as excluder of some species and 

facilitator for other species, changing the habitat and all surrounding life.  

This study adds to the knowledge on the impact of the sun coral on the rocky shores of Brazil. Further 

research should lead to new insights into how environmental features, such as food availability, 

temperature, depth and hydrodynamics, affect the invasion of this coral. It is also important to 

understand if there are mechanisms of sun coral exclusion. A potential bio-mechanism to slow down the 

invasion is if the invasive bivalve L. aristatus makes the corals hard basis more likely to break because 

of its perforation. The mytilid could make the calcareous coral basis weaker and prone to break down 

during storms. This would be a potential mechanism of exclusion of both invaders, the coral does not 

have the ability to survive without a foundation and the bivalve would not have a sheltered place to live, 

protected from predators. It is also possible that some native fish prey on the sun coral, like showed by 

Mirzrahi et al. (2018) for the damsel Abudefduf saxatilis, in the same study area. Such fish, or any other 

predators, could eventually lower the rate of invasion of the sun coral.  

If the sun coral invasion does not stop (naturally or due to human intervention), the southwest 

Atlantic rocky bottoms are likely to continue to be severely invaded. The main consequence of this will 

be a deep alteration of the local habitats, which means a radical change on the native biotic assemblages. 

In general terms, an important alteration in the rocky shore food webs and marine biodiversity is taking 

place at an accelerated rate, affecting the balance of the ecosystems and possibly the local economy via 

a potential interreference with fisheries.
