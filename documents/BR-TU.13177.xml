Resumo
Objetivo: Avaliar e correlacionar os valores de densidade óssea radiográfica, altura óssea peri-implantar e de frequência 
de ressonância nos implantes curtos e convencionais instalados na região posterior da mandíbula após a instalação 
da prótese provisória. Material e método: Esse estudo piloto clínico prospectivo contou com a participação de 
11 pacientes que foram divididos previamente em dois grupos: implantes curtos (n=18) (5,0 x 5,5 mm e 5,0 x 7,0 mm) e 
implantes convencionais (n=23) (4,0 x 10 mm e 4,0 x 11,5 mm). Foram executadas análise da frequência de ressonância, 
altura óssea e densidade óssea peri-implantar. Os implantes foram avaliados nos períodos T0 (imediatamente após a 
instalação do provisório), T1 (após 90 dias) e T2 (após 180 dias). Resultado: Não houve diferenças estatisticamente 
significativas entre os grupos com relação a densidade óssea radiográfica (152,50 ± 15,39 vs. 157,60 ± 28,46, 
para implantes convencionais e curtos respectivamente no período T2), estabilidade dos implantes (Implantes 
convencionais: 66,76 ± 10,39 no período T0 e 61,85 ± 8,38 no período T2 vs. Implantes curtos: 57,50 ± 12,17 no 
período T0 e 61,53 ± 7,39 no período T2) e quanto a perda óssea periimplantar (0,03 mm vs. -0,17 mm, em implantes 
convencionais e curtos no período T2, respectivamente). Adicionalmente a isso, não foram detectados correlação 
significativa entre densidade radiográfica com altura óssea peri-implantar e nem com a frequência de ressonância. 
Conclusão: Verificou-se que os implantes curtos apresentaram um comportamento semelhante aos implantes de 
comprimento convencionais com relação à frequência de ressonância, a densidade radiográfica peri-implantar e a 
manutenção dos níveis ósseos periimplantares.

Abstract
Objective: To evaluate and correlate the values of radiographic bone density, peri-implant bone height and resonance 
frequency analysis (RFA) of short or conventional implants placed in the posterior region of the mandible after 
installing a prosthesis. Material and method: Eleven patients were selected for this prospective parallel pilot study. 
The prostheses were supported by two types of implants: short implants (n = 18) (5.0 x 5.5 mm and 5.0 x 7.0 mm) 
and conventional implants (n = 23) (4.0 x10 mm and 4.0 x 11.5 mm). The implants were evaluated by RFA, by 
measuring the bone height, and peri-implant bone density. The implants were evaluated at the periods T0 (immediately 
after installation of the prosthesis), T1 (after 90 days), and T2 (after 180 days). Result: There were no statistically 
significant differences between groups with respect to radiographic bone density (152.50 ± 15.39 vs. 157.60 ± 28.46, 
for conventional and short implants, respectively at T2), stability of the implants (Conventional implants: 66.76 ± 10.39 
at T0, and 61.85 ± 8.38 at T2 vs. Short implants: 57.50 ± 12.17 at T0, and 61.53 ± 7.39 at T2) and peri-implant bone 
loss (0.03 mm vs.-0.17 mm, for conventional and short implants, respectively at T2). Additionally, a significant 
correlation between the evaluated parameters was not detected. Conclusion: The short and conventional implants 
presented similar stability, bone level and density after the activation of occlusion loading.

INTRODUCTION

Dental implants have been used predictably for the treatment 
of all forms of edentulism1,2. However, anatomical conditions such 
as bone atrophy create technical difficulties for the installation of 
implants of a conventional size3,4.

Techniques such as guided bone regeneration, inlay block grafts5, 
sinus floor augmentation6, osteodistraction7, and lateralization of 
the inferior alveolar nerve8 have been proposed for individuals with 
decreased bone height and thickness to allow for placement of a 
conventionally sized implant. These techniques are more complex 
and are rarely accepted by patients due to risks such as increased 
morbidity, surgical time and the extra costs for implant-supported 
rehabilitation9,10.

One alternative that has been proposed is the use of short implants 
that would have the advantage of eliminating additional surgical 
procedures to increase bone availability following installation of 
the implants6,11. A literature review reports that previous studies 
have shown that the use of short implants had a high failure 
rate compared to conventional implants12. However, with the 
improvement of engineering materials, there have been changes 
in the external/internal design and the surface of the implant that 
have allowed treatment with short implants to obtain success rates 
similar to the use of conventional implants6. In addition, there is also 
contradictory information regarding success rates (e.g. prosthetic 
complications, marginal bone loss) of short implants. One study 
showed that success rates of short implants installed in the posterior 
region of the jaws were 65.2% after a follow up of 16 to 57 months, 
which is lower than expected for conventional implants in this same 
type of situation13. On the other hand, a clinical study that evaluated 
the success rates of short and conventional implants placed in fully 
edentulous mandibles and followed up for 12 months showed an 
equal success rates for these both types of implants14.

Considering that short implants may interfere with the success 
and survival of the oral rehabilitation, the aim of this study was 
to evaluate and compare the values of radiographic bone density, 
peri-implant bone height and resonance frequency analysis of short 
and conventional implants installed in the posterior region of the 
mandible after installation of the temporary implant-supported 
prosthesis.

MATERIAL AND METHOD

Patient Selection

This prospective parallel study was approved by the Ethics 
Committee on Human Research (1302/11) and was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were asked 
respectfully to participate in this study and signed an informed 
consent before they were included in the study.

Eleven patients were selected for this study. Eight of them were 
female and three were male, and the mean age of participants was 
53.44 years. The exclusion criteria adopted for this study were 
1) presence of systemic alterations; 2) chronic use medications that 

alter bone metabolism; 3) smoking; 4) alcoholism; and 5) presence 
of parafunctional habits.

Two types of implants were placed in these patients, and the 
selection was defined according to the tomographic analysis of 
the posterior region of the mandible: Group I: Short Implants 
(5.0 x 5.5 mm and 5.0 x 7.0 mm); Group II: Conventional implants 
(4.0 x 10 mm and 4.0 x 11.5 mm). The short implants were placed 
in areas with a distance from the alveolar crest to the upper wall 
of the mandibular canal of less than 11.5 mm (Short, Conexão 
implant Systems), whereas the conventional implants were installed 
in areas where this distance exceeded 11.5 mm (Master Grip, 
Conexão implant Systems). All the implants were installed by the 
same operator.

Prosthetic Rehabilitation

All patients received a provisional prosthesis for four months 
after the implant placement. Micro-Unit abutments were installed 
to permit the connection of multiple screw-retained prostheses 
(Conexão implant Systems). The provisional acrylic prostheses 
were fitted using Micro Unit intermediaries. All the prostheses 
were installed by the same operator.

Radiographic Analysis (Bone Level and Density)

The radiographic analyses were performed using a digital 
periapical radiograph of each implant (Gendex?). A device made 
of acrylic resin (Figure 1A) (Jet Clássico) was used to standardize 
the radiographic position to ensure the cone of the X-ray apparatus 
was perpendicular to the digital film, which eventually became 
parallel to the long axis of the implant (Figure 1B-F). All radiographs 
were performed using the same X-ray device (Gnatus) with the 
same exposure parameters: 65-90 Kv, 7.5-10 mA and a controlled 
time of 0.2s.

For the analysis of peri-implant bone level, the images were 
graded according to the length of the implant, and the measurements 
were made using the superior portion of the implant platform as a 
reference point for the bone contact with the implant body. Regarding 
the analysis of the bone density, five areas with 20x20 pixels were 
defined, four of them were delimited to the side regions of the 
implant (coronal and the middle third region of the implants) and 
the implant body (Figure 1G). The radiographic density calculations 
were performed using the average gray levels of the regions of interest, 
which were defined from the implant gray tone to compensate for 
minor differences between x-rays because the density of the metallic 
pattern of the implant was the same in all samples. Radiographs 
were assessed at periods T0 (immediately after installation of the 
interim), T1 (after 90 days) and T2 (after 180 days). These analyses 
were performed using image analysis software (Image J, National 
Institutes of Health) by a single calibrated examiner.

Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA)

The RFA was made with an Osstell? apparatus (Osstell), which 
is an apparatus using transducers connected to the implant or 
prosthetic components available for many systems. The transducers 
(smartpegs) induce a lateral force to the fixed components, and the 



Rev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 319-324 Clinical comparison of short... 321

displacement of the system is measured. The value obtained with 
the Osstell? was automatically translated into an implant stability 
quotient (ISQ) that ranged from 1 to 100. The smartpeg A3, which is 
coupled to the system unit with torque from 4 to 6 N.cm, was used 
for this evaluation. The measurements were made in the mesial, 
distal, buccal and lingual areas, and the average of these values was 
considered the final value for RFA for each implant.

Statistical Analysis

The numerical data of all the parameters analyzed in this study 
were subjected to a Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p&gt; 0.05), which 
determined the application of parametric tests for inferential 
analysis. The unpaired t-test was used to compare the different 
types of implants in each evaluation period, whereas the repeated 
measurements one-way ANOVA test was used to assess intra-group 
data. Additionally, the Pearson correlation test was used to evaluate 
the correlation of bone density, bone level and RFA data. GraphPad 
Prism 5 software was used to perform statistical analysis, and all 
tests were applied with a confidence level of 95% (p&amp;lt;0.05).

RESULT

A total of 41 implants were installed in 11 patients. Of this 
total, 18 were short implants and 23 were conventional implants. 
No implants were lost during the evaluation period of this study.

Bone Density

In the analysis of the bone radiographic density, no statistically 
significant differences between the groups were detected for any of 
the evaluated periods. There were also no differences among the 
groups for the different periods of evaluation. Even by segmenting 
the evaluation of bone radiographic density into cortical and 
medullary areas, there were not statistically significant between-group 
differences in any of the evaluation periods. Within the group with 

conventional implants, there was a reduction in bone radiographic 
density in the period T1 compared to the period T0 (p&amp;lt;0.05). 
The average and standard deviation data of the radiographic density 
analysis for all of the groups is included in Table 1.

Bone Level

Analysis of the bone level showed that the short implants had 
a lower distance between the implant platform and the bone crest 
compared to conventional implants for all of the evaluation periods 
(1.87-1.95 mm for conventional implants vs. 0.51-0.68 mm for 
short implants) (p&amp;lt;0.05). Additionally, there were no intra-group 
differences regarding bone level variation during the experimental 
period. However, the variation of the bone loss between the 
groups were not different (0.05 mm at T1 and 0.03mm at T2 for 
conventional implants vs. -0.08 mm at T1 and -0.17 mm at T2 for 
short implants). Table 1 shows the average and standard deviation 
of the bone level (mm) for all of the groups.

RFA

The RFA showed that the conventional implants (66.76 ± 10.39) 
presented greater stability values compared to the short implants 
(57.50 ± 12.17) during the T0 period (p&amp;lt;0.05). However, this 
difference was not detected in other periods. Regarding the 
intra-group analysis, there was a reduction in the stability of 
conventional implants in the T2 period compared to the T1 period 
(p&amp;lt;0.05) and an increase in stability of the short implant in the 
T1 period compared to the T0 period (p&amp;lt;0.01). Table 1 shows the 
average and standard deviation of the RFA for all of the groups.

Correlations

A negative correlation was found between the bone level and 
RFA data in the conventional implant group T0 period (p = 0.04). 
With respect to the correlation between the bone level and bone

significant. For the correlation data between the bone radiographic 
density and the RFA, a negative correlation was detected for short 
implants only detected in period T1 (p = 0.04). Table 2 shows the 
values of the correlations performed in this study.

DISCUSSION

Areas with severe bone resorption and limitations in bone 
height and thickness represent a challenge for oral rehabilitation 
with dental implants11,14, especially in the posterior regions of the 
mandible and maxilla where the mandibular canal and maxillary 
sinus floor are located6,15. Short implants have emerged as a less 
traumatic and invasive alternative than reconstructive procedures 
with bone grafts6,14,15. However, despite the good predictability and 
high success rate of bone grafting procedures, patients are often 
reluctant to undergo additional surgeries because of the risks and 
morbidity associated with them15.

Loss of implants after the installation of the provisional 
implant-supported prosthesis did not occur in our study. Although 
it has been stated that the short implants presented a higher failure 
rate than conventional implants12, some authors showed a survival 

rate for short implants ranging from 87.5%-100%6,11,16,17, and this rate 
was very similar to the survival rate for conventional implants fitted 
in native bone areas14 or grafted areas6,15. This rate was confirmed 
by this study, although the follow-up time was short (6 months 
after installation of the prosthesis).

It was shown in this study that short implants have lower 
distance between the implant platform to the bone crest compared 
to conventional implants. However, these results do not represent 
greater vertical bone loss in the group with conventional implants, 
because that differences already occurred in T0. The absence of 
differences in bone loss around conventional implants and short 
implants has also been reported in other studies6,14. One clinical 
study with higher follow-up time than this study showed that 
short-implants have cumulation bone loss of 0.3 ± 0.5 mm at 
48 months. These authors showed that the crow- implant ratio is 
one of the parameters that significant influence the bone loss in 
short implants13. The effect of this parameter in long-term evaluated 
should be better estimated.

Finite element studies have shown that the increase in diameter 
of the implant causes a better distribution of masticatory stress18,19 
and improves primary stability14,20. However, this trend was not 
observed in our study, although the short implants were 5 mm in 
diameter while the conventional implants were 4 mm in diameter.

Another important factor that can influence the bone level data 
is that although both implants present a switching platform, the 
short implants presented a higher rate of mismatch between the 
abutment and the implant platform (0.525 mm) compared to the 
conventional implants (0.075 mm). It has been demonstrated that 
higher mismatching between the abutment and the implant platform 
reduces bone loss21 and the occlusal tension around implants22. It is 
likely that the short period of evaluation in our study did not allow 
for identification of major changes at the peri-implant bone level.

The implant stability analysis demonstrated that the conventional 
implants had higher RFA values in the immediate period after 
installing the prosthesis. However, with the establishment of stability 
after application of occlusal loads, there were no differences of 
this parameter between the implants. The conventional implant 
was greater in length than the short implant, and consequently 
presented an increased contact area with the bone tissue that may 
have been responsible for greater stability prior to the provisional 
prosthesis installation20. However, there has also been a progressive 
increase in the stability of the short implant and a reduced stability 
of conventional implants, and this increase may be related to the fact

that short implants with larger diameter may reduce the intensity 
of stress transmitted to the surrounding bone19,20, which suggests 
that the conventional implants applied a higher tension to the 
surrounding bone that could induce increased bone turnover and 
consequently reduce the stability values.

The values of bone radiographic density showed no statistically 
significant difference between the implants, even when the different 
bone regions were compared (cortical and medullary). These data 
show that the implants were installed in areas that had similar 
bone density that was not altered by the osseointegration process 
and prosthetic loading of the implants. A study that evaluates the 
effects of progressive occlusal loading of the implants compared 
to conventional loading demonstrated that different types of 
prosthetic loading presented no difference in bone radiographic 
density around the implant23. This outcome suggests that after the 
osseointegration period, if prosthetic principles are respected, the 
occlusal load will not promote changes in the peri-implant bone 
even around implants with different heights and diameters.

Although the parameters analyzed in this study are factors that 
influence the success rates of implants24, none of the parameters 
showed a statistically significant correlation. One of the reasons 
for this lack of correlation is that increased bone density probably 

did not influence the increased contact between the implants and 
the bone, which may have made the correlation between the bone 
density and RFA and the bone level very weak25. In addition, it 
has been demonstrated that the peri-implant bone level was not 
influenced by bone density26. Moreover, it is possible that the low 
number of implants evaluated in this study and the short follow-up 
period may have influenced the absence of significant differences 
between short and conventional implants for the parameters that 
were evaluated. Another limitation of this study was that the 
crown-implant ration was not measured, and this parameter is 
an important variable for understanding the results of long-term 
evaluations. New long-term studies need to be performed to 
consolidate the functional outcomes for short implants either with 
a temporary or definitive prosthesis.

CONCLUSION

Given the methodology used and the results obtained, it can be 
concluded that 1) short implants had similar results compared to 
conventional-length implants; 2) there was no significant correlation 
between the parameters of radiographic density, implant stability 
and the height of the peri-implant bone.
