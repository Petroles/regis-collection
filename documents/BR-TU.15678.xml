ABSTRACT: Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) yield and its quality are dependent of the status of the root system.
Root distribution information is also valuable for soil and water management. An analysis of methods to
evaluate the root distribution of grapevines for both, drip and microsprinkler irrigation in a Typic Acrustox
is presented for the table grape cv. Italia grafted on the rootstock IAC-313, in northeastern Brazil. Measured
root parameters using the monolith method were root dry weight (Dw) and root length density (Lv), while root
area (Ap) was estimated using the soil profile method in combination with digital image analysis. For both
irrigation systems, roots were present to the 1 m soil depth and extended laterally to 1 m distance from the
trunk, but grapevines irrigated by microsprinkler showed greater root presence as the distance from the trunk
increased. Values of Ap were reasonably well correlated to Dw and Lv. However, correlation values were
higher when fractional root distribution was used. The soil profile method in combination with image analysis
techniques, allows proper grapevine root distribution evaluation.

DISTRIBUIÇÃO RADICULAR DE VIDEIRAS IRRIGADAS POR
GOTEJAMENTO E MICROASPERSÃO

RESUMO: A produção de uva (Vitis vinifera L.) em termos quantitativos e qualitativos depende do estado
das raízes. Além disso, informações sobre a distribuição radicular são úteis para o manejo de solo e água. Por
isso, uma análise de métodos para a avaliação da distribuição radicular de videiras cv. Itália / IAC 313 num
Latossolo Vermelho Amarelo irrigadas por gotejamento e microaspersão foi realizada em Petrolina – PE e
Juazeiro - BA, no Vale do São Francisco. Os parâmetros medidos pelo método do monolito foram a matéria
seca (Dw) e densidade de comprimento de raízes (Lv), enquanto a área de raízes (Ap) foi estimada pelo
método do perfil de solo combinado com a análise de imagens digitais. Para ambos os sistemas de irrigação,
as raízes estiveram presentes até 1 m de profundidade e estenderam-se lateralmente até 1 m de distância do
tronco, mas as videiras irrigadas por microaspersão apresentaram uma maior presença de raízes com o aumento
da distância do tronco. Os valores de Ap apresentaram uma boa correlação com Dw e Lv, mas essa correlação
foi maior quando se utilizou a distribuição fracional de cada parâmetro. O método do perfil auxiliado pela
análise de imagem digital permite a avaliação da distribuição radicular.

 INTRODUCTION

The root system serves important physiological
and biochemical functions, and it has been shown that
both grape yield and quality are dependent on the health
status of the roots (Morlat &amp;amp; Jaquet, 1993). Many soil
and management factors, such as temperature, mechani-
cal resistance, aeration, texture, water and nutrient avail-
ability, pH, frequency and depth of tillage, mulching and
organic matter content, affect root distribution of grape-
vines (Kirchhof et al., 1991; Morlat &amp;amp; Jaquet, 1993;
Richards, 1983). In addition, root functionality is variable

and depends on the grapevine cultivar or rootstock (Perry
et al., 1983; Nagarajah, 1987; Morano &amp;amp; Kliewer, 1994).
Regarding water supply to roots, the type of irrigation
system has been shown to affect root distribution (Morano
&amp;amp; Kliewer, 1994) as influenced by irrigation frequency,
soil water availability, and spatial distribution of water
and nutrients (Araujo et al., 1995; Clothier &amp;amp; Green,
1997; van Zyl, 1988). Moreover, actual root water uptake
not only depends on root distribution and its functioning,
but also on soil water availability and salinity. In addi-
tion to water stress in periods of low water availability,
root water uptake is also reduced when concentrations of

soluble salts exceed plant-specific threshold values
(Homaee, 1999). In irrigated soils, particularly in arid and
semi-arid regions, plants are generally exposed to both,
salinity and water stress. In these regions, soil and water
management practices are based on maintaining a favor-
able soil water content and salinity status in the root zone,
thereby minimizing periods of water stress while control-
ling leaching to minimize salinity stress. Furthermore,
there is an increasing interest in the influence of soil water
stress on grape and wine qualities (Bravdo &amp;amp; Hepner,
1987; Freeman, 1990; Matthews &amp;amp; Anderson, 1988;
Myburgh, 1994; van Zyl &amp;amp; van Huyssteen, 1984). These
issues, in combination, justify studying the interrelation-
ships between irrigation water management, root distri-
bution grape, yield and quality.

Grapevine root growth initiates after bud burst
and growth rates increase rapidly to a maximum at the
blooming stage, after which the growth rate decreases.
However, a new growth period starts after harvest (van
Zyl, 1988).  Depending on age, structural roots vary in
diameter but are usually between 6-100 mm. From the
main framework, smaller permanent roots (diameter 2-6
mm) arise and grow either horizontally or vertically.
These roots extend and branch in a few main extension
roots that are generally thin (diameter 1-2 mm) and grow
rapidly. These finer roots die within weeks after emer-
gence but are replaced continuously (Richards, 1983).

Root distribution refers to the presence of roots
within a fixed grid. Typically, root distribution studies in-
clude root biomass or root length as a function of soil
depth, distance from the plant stem, and position between
neighboring plants. Measurement of root distribution in
agricultural communities often includes roots of more
than one plant. Root architecture refers to the spatial con-
figuration of the root system, specifically focusing on the
geometric properties of root axes and laterals, mostly con-
cerned with the entire root system characteristics (Lynch,
1995). Image analysis may provide all required informa-
tion on root distribution and architecture, allowing for an
explicit characterization of water and nutrient exploration,
comparisons between plant cultivars and soil and water
management practices.

Root analysis as a tool to study root behavior may
benefit from using a combination of various measurement
methods (Atkinson, 1980). Although root distribution
analysis by the monolith method is difficult, laborious and
time-consuming (Bohm, 1979), it provides detailed infor-
mation on root length and diameter within a soil profile.
Despite the fact that finer roots are more likely involved
in plant water uptake, evidence has been presented that
the larger suberized roots can also be effective in water
and nutrient acquisition (Kozinka, 1991; van Zyl, 1988).
However, because of uncertainties about the relationship
of root diameter to their function, generally, the root
length within a soil volume unit has been adopted (root

length density, Lv) to characterize root presence (Klepper,
1992). In the trench or profile wall method (Bohm, 1979),
digital image analysis can provide information for the re-
quired quantitative root analysis. From the digital pictures
of roots exposed in a trench wall, root area (Ap) and root
length (Lp) can be estimated using an image processing
technique (Crestana et al., 1994). Moreover, root biom-
ass can be determined from root area measurements, as
suggested by Ruark &amp;amp; Bockhein (1988) in aspen roots
analysis in trench walls. Many other studies have shown
the feasibility, accuracy and procedures of digital image
analysis to estimate root area, root length and root diam-
eter (Bauhus &amp;amp; Messier, 1999; Commins et al., 1991;
Dowdy et al., 1998; Kaspar &amp;amp; Ewing, 1997; Kimura et
al., 1999; Murphy &amp;amp; Smucker, 1995; Tagliavini et al.,
1993).

The objectives of this study were to analyze root
distribution of grapevines, and to determine root distri-
bution as affected by irrigation methods and soil types.
Specifically, differences in root characteristics were
measured for microsprinkler and drip irrigation systems
for the IAC-313 rootstock in Petrolina, PE, Brazil. For
this purpose, both the soil profile method with digital
image analysis (Crestana et al., 1994; Bassoi et al.,
1999) and the monolith method (Bohm, 1979) were
used. In another commercial grape growing area located
in Juazeiro, BA, Brazil, an evaluation of root distribu-
tion of the same rootstock in a different soil type was
also conducted, using the trench method only. Both
neighboring counties are sited along the São Francisco
River and are important table grape production areas of
the São Fancisco Valley of the semi-arid region of north-
eastern Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Petrolina County
Two field trials were carried out in Petrolina, PE,

Brazil (09° 09’ S, 40° 22’ W, altitude 365.5 m). The re-
gion has characteristics to grow grapevine with two har-
vests a year, because of the warm temperatures that pre-
vail throughout the year (Araújo, 1994). The grapevines
cv. Italia grafted on the rootstock IAC-313 were planted
in September 1991 in a 4 x 2 m grid (rows x plants) on
a Typic Acrustox of average bulk density 1.6 Mg m-3.
The soil is classified as medium-textured (140 g kg-1,
80 g kg-1 and 780 g kg-1 of clay, silt and sand, respec-
tively), and the average soil water retention corresponds
to 128.4 g kg-1 and 44.9 g kg-1 at 10 kPa and 1500 kPa,
respectively. The chemical characteristics of the soil pro-
file (Table 1) were determined down to the 1 m depth
as described by EMBRAPA (1997). Grapevines were ir-
rigated either by microsprinkler (flow rate of 40 L h-1

with a wetting radius of 2 m), spaced every 4 m along
the plant row and centered between two plants, or by

drip emitters  (flow rate of 3.7 L h-1), spaced 1 m apart
along a double drip line (10 cm distance between plant
row and drip lines on either side of the grapevines). Ir-
rigation scheduling was based on pan-A evaporation
data, using crop coefficients obtained in 1994 in the
same area (Teixeira et al, 1999), and identical daily wa-
ter application amounts were used for both irrigation
systems. Root distribution was measured after bloom-
ing in two subsequent growing seasons, using the soil
profile method combined with digital image analysis
(Crestana et al., 1994; Bassoi et al., 1999) and the mono-
lith method (Bohm, 1979).

Soil profile method
For crops on both irrigation systems, 1-m deep

and 2-m wide trenches were dug between plant rows to
expose half of the root system of each of the two grape-
vine plants, in October 1995 and for other two in April
1996 (2 m long wall, one plant along each side of the
trench). The distance between trench wall and center of
plant row was 1 m.

A thin layer of soil (1-2 cm) was carefully re-
moved from the excavated vertical soil wall along the
whole trench, and visible roots (generally with diam-
eter larger than 1 mm) were painted with white ink to
enhance color contrast of the roots and the soil. A 1 ×
1 m wire-wood frame with a wire grid of 0.2 × 0.2 m
was pressed against the trench wall and video images
were collected for each of the 0.04 m2 areas along the
whole trench. The image collection procedure was re-
peated in several distances (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2
m) from plant row. Root images were digitized with a
resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, saved as BMP files and
processed by the Integrated System for Root and Soil
Coverage Analysis (SIARCS®) software (Crestana et
al., 1994). From each image, root areas (Ap, m

2) were
determined.  Average Ap values ( pA ) were computed
from  two subsequent trench walls, e.g., making up
the front and back of each 0.2 m thick soil slab, corre-
sponding to distances of 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and
0.8-1.0 m from the plant row.

Monolith method
After image collection of each trench wall, mono-

liths of 0.008 m3, corresponding to the 0.2 × 0.2 m imaged
area and to the 0.2 m soil thickness, were sampled for two
plants, in 1995 and 1996. As the trenches were excavated
between two plant rows, sampling was performed on root
systems on each side of the trenches. Monoliths were col-
lected at distances of 1.0-0.8, 0.8-0.6, 0.6-0.4, and 0.4-0.2
m from plant rows. In the field, the roots of the monoliths
were carefully separated from the soil using a 4 mm mesh
sieve. Subsequently, fresh roots were washed in the labo-
ratory, classified in four diameter (d) intervals: d ? 2 mm,
2 &amp;lt;d ? 5 mm, 5 &amp;lt;d ? 10 mm, and d &gt; 10 mm, and oven
dried at 65°C before counting. For each diameter interval,
dry weight (Dw, g) and root length  (L, m) was estimated
using the line intersection method (Tennant, 1975). Grid
sizes of 0.01 x 0.01 m and 0.02 x 0.02 m were used for
counting root line intersections for d ? 10 mm and d &gt; 10
mm, respectively. Root length density (Lv, m m

-3) was ob-
tained from the estimated L divided by the monolith vol-
ume (V = 0.008 m3).

Statistical analysis
The root parameters (Dw, pA  and Lv) for the two

irrigations systems were analyzed in relation to four dis-
tance intervals from plants, and five soil depths using a
repeated measure design. As measurements were repeated
over the soil profile, the root count at one depth (soil layer
0.2 m thick) is not independent of the root count of the
next depth, for a homogeneous soil. So counts over sev-
eral depths were considered repeated spatial measure-
ments (Morano &amp;amp; Kliewer, 1994). For each irrigation sys-
tem, two replications were sampled and analyzed for Dw,

pA  and Lv data of 1995 and 1996.
To better understand the relationships between root

measurements, pA - was calculated from the front and the
back sides of a monolith - was correlated with Dw and Lv,
obtained from the inside of the same soil volume. Values
of Dw, Lv, and pA  were added over each 0.2 m soil depth
and along the trench wall, and  fractional distributions of
root parameters were also correlated. These comparisons
were performed for all distance intervals and for both irri-
gation systems.

Model application
A simple model to predict the vertical root dis-

tribution was applied to root parameters measured by
both, the trench wall and monolith methods, based on an
asymptotic equation (Gale &amp;amp; Grigal, 1987): Y = 1 – (BD),
where Y is the cumulative fraction of a root density pa-
rameter (between 0 and 1) measured from soil surface to
a depth D (m), and B is a fitting coefficient.

Juazeiro County
In a separated field experiment in 1997, the root

distribution of the grapevine cv. Piratininga, grafted on

the rootstock IAC-313, was measured using the soil pro-
file method combined with digital image analysis, to dem-
onstrate its application in a farmer’s field. Grapevines
were planted in 1990 using a 3.5 x 2 m spacing, in a
clayey soil (540 g kg-1, 90 g kg-1, 370 g kg-1 of clay, silt
and sand, respectively), and with a bulk density of 1.4
Mg m-3). Average soil water retention at 10 kPa and 1500
kPa were 19.6 g kg-1 and 10.3 kg-1, respectively. Chemi-
cal characteristics of this soil (Table 1) were also deter-
mined as described by EMBRAPA (1997). Vines were ir-
rigated using furrows on each side of the vine row. Two
trenches (1 m deep and 2 m long) were excavated to ex-
pose the rooting system of one vine trunk in the center
of each trench. Field procedures for image collection were
the same as described earlier. Root distribution was ana-
lyzed at several distances (1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 m)
from the trunk. In addition the Ap, root length in the soil
profile (Lp, m) was measured in this trial. Average val-
ues ( pA  and pL , respectively) were obtained from two
subsequent trench walls as described in the Petrolina
County experiment. In addition, root length density data
were computed from the images, assuming that the volu-
metric root fraction (VRF, m3 of roots per m3 of soil) is
equal to the areal root fraction (ARF, m2 of roots per m2

of soil), and that the total root volume within each 0.2 x
0.2 x 0.2 m3 bulk soil volume is equal to ? 2r?  pL  (Bassoi
et al., 1999):

VRF = ARF =&gt; (? 2r?  pL ) / (0.2 × 0.2 x 0.2) = pA  / (0.2 × 0.2)

pL  = ( pA  × 0.2) / (?
2r? )

L
v,p

 = pL  / (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2) = ARF / (? 2r? )

where Lv,p denotes the root length density as estimated
from the soil profile method (m m-3), and r?  (m) is the
average root radius as estimated by the (Ap / Lp) ratio of
both images of the 0.008 m3 root  volume (both trench
faces).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Petrolina County
A considerable variation on the total value

(whole plant) of Dw and L was observed between the
two grapevines in both years, even on a same irrigation
system. In 1995, total Dw values were 1.23 and 0.34 kg
for microsprinkler, and 1.03 and 0.71 kg for drip irri-
gated plants. Corresponding total L values were 473.5
and 252.5 m for microsprinkler, and 475.8 and 417.2 m
for drip irrigated plants. In 1996, total Dw from vines
irrigated by microsprinkler were 1.36 and 0.46 kg, while
for those irrigated by drip values were 0.84 and 1.06 kg.
Respectively, total L values were 564.5 and 264.2 m for
microsprinkler, and 396.8 and 506.0 m for drip irrigated
plants. In both years, roots with d ? 5 mm were approxi-

mately 50 % or more of total Dw, while roots with d ? 2
mm corresponded to at least 80 % of total L. Other stud-
ies have shown that most of the roots were found within
d &amp;lt;0.5 mm (van Zyl, 1988), d &amp;lt;1 mm (Morlat &amp;amp;
Jacquet, 1993), and d &amp;lt;2 mm (Morano &amp;amp; Kliewer,
1994; Padjett-Johnson, 1999). The variation is possibly
a consequence of the extension and direction of root
growth, which is predominantly a random phenomenon
influenced by gravity, soil resistance, temperature and
availability of carbohydrate from the leaves, nutrient and
water availability and gaseous exchange within the soil
(Rowe, 1993). Also, strong spatial heterogeneity of root
distribution, volumetric root expansion, frequent asym-
metry on either side of plant rows, and a great variabil-
ity in root diameter are the main constraints for root
studies in vineyards (Morlat &amp;amp; Jacquet, 1993). The av-
erage L for drip (448.93 ± 50.64 m) was higher than
that of microsprinkler-irrigated plants (388.70 ± 155.05
m), which is similar in relation to other results (Stevens
&amp;amp; Douglas, 1994). Variability of total root length of
vines did not make possible any conclusion on the ef-
fect of soil texture on root development (Nagarajah,
1987).

There were no differences between root param-
eters under both irrigation systems while all comparisons
were significant between soil profiles, soil depths and
their interactions. The closer to the trunk, the greater is
the amount of roots in the horizontal direction, as well
as in the vertical direction. Dw was not significant for ir-
rigation and soil profile interaction in 1995, and for irri-
gation and soil depth interaction in 1996, while Lv and

pA presented significant differences for both years (Table
2).

In the horizontal direction (irrigation and soil pro-
file interaction), the t-test was significant for root param-
eters in some sites. For the most distant samples from
trunk (0.8-1 m), Dw and pA  of the microsprinkler-irri-
gated grapevines presented higher values (except for pA
in 1995), while near the trunk (0.2-0.4 and 0.4-0.6 m),
drip-irrigated plants presented significant higher root pa-
rameters. In the vertical direction (irrigation and soil

depth interaction), soil layers until 0.6 m presented some
root parameters with higher values for plants irrigated by
drip, and some higher values for plants irrigated by
microsprinkler for the deeper soil layer (Table 3).

In the significant interactions between irrigation
and soil profile and soil depth, the t-test between the
same soil depth interval in the same soil profile indi-
cated that few portions of the root system had differ-
ences between both irrigation systems. But for those
with differences, this occurred at the greatest distance
from the trunk (0.8-1 m soil profile) and in the deepest
soil layer (0.8-1 m depth); microsprinkler-irrigated
plants presented greater root presence than those irri-
gated by drippers, in almost all sampling sites. A clear
tendency of greater values of drip irrigated plants ap-
peared in the upper 0.6 m soil depth and in the soil pro-
files between 0.2 and 0.6 m. Lv and pA  values of 1996
trial are presented over the entire trench walls in verti-
cal and horizontal directions in Figures 1 to 4. Closer
to the trunk, values increased as well as the ones under
microsprinkler presented higher values than those un-
der drip irrigation in 0.8-1 and 0.6-0.8 m soil profiles,
while the opposite occurred for 0.4-0.6 and 0.2-0.4 m
soil profiles. Higher values of Lv and pA  were found
near the soil surface due to manure application, a com-
mon practice of the grapevine production system in the
São Francisco Valley. Generally, table grape growers
have been applying 0.02-0.04 m3 of manure per vine in
every growing season.

As grapevine root distribution in the soil profile
is dependent of edaphic conditions (Nagarajah, 1987;
Morlat &amp;amp; Jacquet, 1993). Soil depth of highest root pres-
ence varied around 0.4 m (Nappi et al., 1985), 0.5 m
(Padgett-Johnson, 1999), 0.8 m (Stevens &amp;amp; Douglas,
1994), 1.0 m (Araújo et al., 1995), and 2.4 m (Williams
&amp;amp; Smith, 1991). Some of the influence factors are the ir-
rigation system, age of the plant, rootstock, spacing grid,
and physic-chemical soil conditions. In this study, the
upper 0.4 m soil profile presented the highest amount of
root in both soils. Supposedly application of mamure has
provided better root proliferation conditions in this soil

layer. Higher grapevine root presence in a sandy soil ho-
rizon was observed and related to higher organic matter
content (Morlat &amp;amp; Jacquet, 1993). The main factors for
shallow rooting in tropical soils are low pH, high exchange-
able aluminum, compaction, inadequate aeration, and low
retention and movement of water (Reichardt, 1981). In this
study, soil pH ranged from 4.4 (deeper to upper layers) to
6.0 (upper layers), and organic matter content in deeper lay-
ers was low. Also, this soil presented over the 1 m depth
low level of sodium, medium levels of calcium and mag-
nesium, high contents of potassium and phosphorus, and
medium base saturation (Table 1).

Stevens &amp;amp; Douglas (1994) found that in the hori-
zontal direction, roots of drip-irrigated plants were con-
centrated under the vine row, and 50% of the root length
was within the 45 cm distance from the plant row in com-
parison with 35% of the plants irrigated by
microsprinkler. A decrease in the grapevine root length
from 0.3 m to 0.9 m distance from the trunk was also ob-
served by Nagarajah (1987). In this study area, a greater
amount of roots was within the 0.6 m distance from the
plant row.

Water application by drippers close to the trunk
provides smaller wetted soil volume mainly in the closer

soil portions at vertical and horizontal directions to trunk.
Therefore, in some portions of the soil near the trunk, Lv
and pA  were higher for drip than for the correspondent
positions in plants irrigated by microsprinklers. But root
growing was spread over the longitudinal direction in re-
lation to the plant rows, because of the 2 m wetting ra-
dius of the microsprinklers, emitter disposals on each 1
m along the drip line, and the manure application, close
and along plant rows. Besides of the differences on meth-
ods used for root sampling and measurement, Lv values
are in accordance with other authors (Nagarajah, 1987;
van Zyl, 1988).

Normal precipitation (1963-1996) at Petrolina,
measured at the climatic station located within the ex-
perimental area, was 573 mm per year, and 512 mm oc-

cur between November and April (rainy season). As
grapevine is cultivated over the entire year in this tropi-
cal fruit growing area, with two harvests per year
(Araujo, 1994), the root growth during the rainy sea-
son may contribute also to minimize differences in root
development under microsprinkler and drip irrigation
systems.

Correlations obtained between Dw, Lv and pA
for 1996 data were slightly better than those for 1995,
but in both years the r2-values were not sufficiently
high, even those between parameters measured inside
the monolith. This occurred because the trench wall ex-
poses part of the root system present inside the soil
volume, and because roots with same Dw may have dif-
ferent L values or vice-versa because of different root

diameter. Correlation performed between the averaged
fractional distribution of the root parameters for each 0.2
m soil layer along the trench wall, considering each
plant and each soil profile, were high. The integration
of the root parameter values provided this better rela-
tionship (Table 4). It means a good correspondence and,
therefore, a support to the feasibility of the digital im-
age analysis for this purpose.

The model to predict vertical root distribution
was tested with Dw, Lv, and pA  measured in 1996

in two vines irrigated by microsprinkler for all soil
profiles together (Figure 5). The variability of the
values for a same soil depth is attributed to the varia-
tion of root presence in the different distances from the
trunk, as already discussed. The equations presented high
r2 values, and the Dw, Lv, and pA variances were explained
by 91.3, 89.5, and 95.2 %, respectively. Therefore, the
vertical root distribution analysis can be accomplished
using the parameters measured by both methods with this
simple model, with acceptable accuracy.

Grapevine root distribution 385

Scientia Agricola, v.60, n.2, p.377-387, Abr./Jun. 2003

Juazeiro County
Root distribution of the grapevine cv. Piratininga

grafted on rootstock IAC-313 was evaluated by digital
image analysis to obtain pA , pL , and Lv,p, and an ex-
ample of these results is presented for pA  in Figure 6
for comparison with results from the experimental area
(Petrolina County). Roots reached the 1 m depth and the
1 m distance from the trunk and the amount increased in
relation to the decrease of the distance from the plant row.
This soil presented a higher pH and nutrient content than
that of Petrolina (Table 1). The lack of roots near soil sur-
face, specially in 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1 m distances,
can be attributed to no manure application in this area.
A much less fine root proliferation was observed in the
field, particularly in the 0-0.4 m depth, as compared to
the Petrolina County trial.

As observed for the experimental area, higher
correlation coefficients were obtained with the fractional
distribution correlation than with the parameter compari-
sons (Table 4). Lv calculated by monolith data in the ex-
perimental area ranged from 10 to 2730 m m-3, while Lv,p
(using trench wall data) of the Juazeiro County trial var-
ied from 1 to 930 m m-3. The differences in magnitude
between both root parameters are a consequence of the
whole and partial exposure of the roots for measurement
(respectively, L in the monolith method, and Ap and Lp
in the soil profile method). In an indirect way, we found
that fractional Lp and Lv,p may be used to evaluate root
distribution, given their correlation with pA .

The range of root diameter over the trench wall
and estimated by Ap/Lp ratio was 2.1 - 3.4, 2.1 - 3.3, 2.2
- 3.7, 1.9 - 2.7, 0.9 - 2.9 mm, for soil profiles at 0.2, 0.4,

0.6, 0.8, and 1 m from plant rows. These estimations are
within the diameter intervals where most of Dw and L
were found in the Petrolina County and by other studies
already mentioned.

In conclusion, the grapevine cv. Italia, grafted on
the rootstock IAC-313 and grown under drip and
microsprinkler irrigation, presented a root system that
reached 1 m in the vertical and horizontal directions from
the trunk, in a coarse textured soil. However, much of the
root system was present in the soil volume covered by
the 0.4 m depth and by the perpendicular distance of 0.6
m from plant row. In some portions of the soil, root
amounts were higher as the distance from the trunk in-
creased (vertical and horizontal directions) for plants un-
der microsprinkler irrigation, while drip irrigated grape-
vines presented higher root presence near to the trunk.
Roots with diameter less than 2 mm were at least 80%
of the total root length.

Correlation among dry weight, root length den-
sity and root area were reasonable, but correlation among
their fractional distributions over the soil profile were
higher, which lead to similar conclusions on root distri-
bution. Because of its good correlation with root length
density, root area or root length estimated by the soil pro-
file method combined with digital image analysis can be
used to evaluate grapevine rootstocks.
