resumo
As descargas dos estuários formam uma pluma que é advetada para a região costeira
adjacente, durante a maré vazante, modulando a circulação e hidrografia costeiras. Na
costa central portuguesa, a pluma do Estuário do Tejo influencia a hidrografia da região,
controlando a dinâmica local. Na atualidade, estudos de plumas estuarinas são realizados
utilizando modelos de circulação e de transporte de alta-resolução e sofisticados métodos
de análise de dados, como as redes neuronais. O objetivo deste estudo consiste em analisar
os padrões da descarga estuarina do Tejo na zona costeira adjacente, sob diferentes
condições de vento e eventos de descarga estuarinas elevadas.

Neste âmbito, implementou-se o modelo 3D de circulação e transporte MOHID, utilizando
um método de downscaling do modelo Operational Model for the Portuguese Coast
(PCOMS) (6 km) para a ROFI do Estuário do Tejo (500m). De modo a melhorar
os forçamentos atmosféricos do modelo costeiro, implementou-se uma nova aplicação
de alta-resolução (2 km) do modelo WRF para a região. A validação dos modelos de
circulação e de transporte foram realizadas para o período de Julho a Dezembro de 2012.
Resultados numéricos demonstram uma reprodução correta dos padrões superficiais
quando comparados com dados observados de velocidade da corrente, salinidade e
temperatura da água. O erro médio quadrático (RMSE) das correntes de superfície
mostrou um desvio médio inferior a 16 cms?1. Comparação da temperatura superficial
da agua com os dados remotos do sensor MODIS-Aqua identificaram um desvio inferior
a 2oC, demostrando a qualidade das previsões do modelo em reproduzir os padrões
dinâmicos costeiros.

De modo a estudar a variabilidade costeira causada pela descarga estuarina do Tejo,
simularam-se 5 cenários utilizando ventos favoráveis de upwelling e downwelling, e
descargas do Rio Tejo de 1500, 3000 e 5000 m3s?1. As simulações dos cenários foram
realizadas para o período de 8-31 de Novembro de 2012, devido à ocorrência de padrões
favoráveis de vento. Com o objetivo de quantificar a variabilidade costeira, realizou-se
uma analise SOM com 1x4 padrões espaciais dos campos de salinidade à superfície. Os
resultados demonstram que as descargas fluviais são o principal forçamento nas simulações,
só superados pelo vento aquando se registam baixas descarga fluviais. Secções transversais
da salinidade mostraram uma profundidade da pluma estuarina com cerca de 15 m na
zona da embocadura do estuário, reduzindo-se para 10 m na zona costeira adjacente
ao Cabo da Roca. A tensão do vento revelou ter um papel importante na dispersão da
pluma, sendo responsável pelo transporte para norte ou para sudoeste da mesma. Em
todos os cenários, os ventos favoráveis a downwelling transportam a pluma para norte
encostada à costa, enquanto ventos de upwelling transportam a pluma para sudoeste.

A nova implementação de alta resolução em 3D desenvolvida neste trabalho permite
retirar informação extra acerca da dinâmica da pluma estuarina sob diferentes condições
de vento e descarga do Rio Tejo. Padrões distintos de dispersão foram observados,
permitindo uma melhoria do conhecimento da circulação e hidrografia da região. Para
trabalhos futuros, este modelo pode permitir o acoplamento de modelos biogeoquímicos
ou de derrame de hidrocarbonetos, temas importantes e desafiantes para a complexa
zona costeira adjacente ao Estuário do Tejo.

abstract
Buoyant discharges from estuaries form an outflow plume that is advected onto the near
shelf during the ebb tide, modulating the circulation and hydrography of the adjacent
coast. In the central coast of Portugal, the plume from the Tagus Estuary influences
the hydrography of the area, controlling local dynamics. Nowadays, estuarine plume
propagation studies are performed using high-resolution circulation and transport models
and sophisticated data analyses tools, as the artificial neural networks. The main aim
of this work consists in studying the Tagus Estuarine outflow behaviour under different
wind forcing conditions and variable river discharge events.

For this purpose, a 3D circulation and transport model (www.mohid.com) was imple-
mented for the region, using a nested downscaling approach from the Operational Model
for the Portuguese Coast (PCOMS) (6 km) to the Tagus ROFI (500 m). To improve
the atmospheric circulation model forcing, a new high-resolution atmospheric model (2
km) was implemented for the region, using the WRF model. To validate the circulation
and transport models, a simulation period between July and December 2012 was used.
Numerical predictions shown an accurate reproduction of the surface patterns when
compared with observed data of current velocity, salinity and water temperature. The
root mean square error (RMSE) of surface currents revealed a mean deviation lower
than 16 cm s?1. SST comparison with MODIS-Aqua remote sensing imagery shows a
deviation lower than 2oC, revealing the model accuracy in reproducing coastal dynamics.

In order to study coastal variability due to the Tagus estuarine outflow, five scenarios were
simulated under upwelling and downwelling favourable winds and Tagus river discharge
of 1500, 3000 and 5000 m3s?1. The scenarios simulations were performed for the days
8-31 of November 2012 because of favourable distinct wind patterns. In order to quantify
the region variability 1×4 Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of the surface salinity fields were
performed. The results show that river discharge is the main controlling forcing for the
scenarios simulation, only overtaken by the wind, when low discharge values were present.
The cross-shelf sections show a depth of the plume bulge of 15 m near the mouth of
the estuary, reducing to 10 m in the far region, near Cabo da Roca. The wind stress
played a powerful role in the dispersion of the bulge, being responsible for the north or
southwest transport of the plume. In all scenarios, under downwelling favourable winds
the plume is compressed toward the coast, and under upwelling winds the plume follows
a SW direction, being advected offshore.

The new high resolution 3D implementation developed in this study provides extra
information about the Tejo estuarine plume dynamic under different conditions of winds
and river discharge. Distinct spatial dispersion was observed improving the knowledge of
the region circulation and hydrography. Thus, this validated implementation can be used
for new studies, such as coupling of a biogeochemistry or oil spill models, topics that
are important and challenging for a complex coastal region such as the off the Tagus
Estuary.

Introduction

1.1 Motivation and aims

Coastal hydrography is highly affected by the interaction between land, water and
atmospheric forcing. Both forcings are very much influenced by natural and anthropogenic
factors, being crucial to analyse the joint influences.

In general, in studies of coastal processes, estuarine regions are not included, since
estuaries and near coastal regions are preferentially treated separately because of spatial
resolution needed to represent local physical processes (Otero et al., 2008; Oliveira et al.,
2009). Estuaries are usually related with zones of high primary productivity, nurseries for
fish species, sheltering for vessels and harbour industries. These characteristics contributes
to a population increase around estuaries borders that can increase the anthropogenic
stress.

Usually, the impact of estuaries in the coastal region is in the form of a buoyant plume,
that affects circulation and transport of soluble and particulate materials to the near coast.
These plumes are dynamical structures resulting from the discharge of low salinity water
over a heavier (denser) ambient (Kourafalou et al., 1996). The plumes can change physical,
chemical and biological features of those regions and also effect the transport of soluble
and suspended materials that can lead to an increase in coastal primary production (Sousa
et al., 2013).

The pressure caused by anthropogenic factor in estuaries and coastal systems may
turn these regions into vulnerable systems, requesting frequent monitorization and damage
control.

The central region of Portugal, comprising the Tagus Estuarine region, is influenced by

1



2 Introduction

numerous storms which can impact coastal systems due to strong winds and considerable
amount of precipitation, promoting changes in circulation and hydrography.

Another forcing that affects estuarine and coastal dynamics is the freshwater discharge,
which is quiet important once the Tagus river drains one of the largest watershed areas
of the Iberian Peninsula, retaining a huge amount of precipitable water able to produce
high river discharge. That can have a major impact in the estuary (Vaz and Dias, 2014).
Moreover, according to Dagg et al. (2004) river outflows can be related with the plume
extension in the near coastal region.

Another forcing that influences estuarine and coastal circulation is the wind intensity
and direction. In fact, the typical wind pattern in the Portuguese west coast, during the
summer, is from the north. These winds are commonly referred as upwelling favourable,
since they promote an offshore advection of surface waters and a vertical advection of rich
nutrient upwelled waters toward the surface. During these upwelling events an increase in
primary productivity can be observed (Vaz et al., 2015).

Several studies have been performed regarding the Tagus estuary dynamics. Nevertheless
there are not many studies regarding the adjacent coastal region circulation. Only a few
studies have been performed for the near coastal region of the Tagus Estuary. In fact,
Fortunato et al. (1999) and Vaz et al. (2009b, 2011, 2015) studied the region close to the
estuary mouth, highlighting topics as the mouth hydrodynamics, coastal circulation and
surface sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll patterns.

The main objective of this study is to highlight the main features of the Tagus estuarine
plume under different wind stress and freshwater discharge conditions in order to increase
the knowledge of the impact of the large estuarine discharge in the hydrography and
circulation of the region. To achieve these goals, a nested implementation of an high
resolution circulation model (based on MOHID) is used. Also, a recent methodology to
compute the main variability is also used, the self-organizing maps (SOM) method. Merged
with the main objective, there are important steps for model validation using different
datasets, such as: sea surface elevation (SSE) from tide gauge, surface current validation
using Sistema de Monitorização Operacional de Correntes Costeiras (SIMOC) and Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.



1.2. Literature review 3

1.2 Literature review

1.2.1 Estuarine plumes

Estuarine plumes impact in the coastal ocean in the form of a buoyant plume that
transports land and rainfall materials from the river discharge. From the dynamical point of
view, the discharge area of rivers in the coast can be considered as an input of momentum
and buoyancy caused by the release of a less dense fluid (river discharge) into a heavier fluid
(coastal waters). This structure is known as buoyant river plume (Kourafalou et al., 1996).

Thus structures are vital for the transport of sediments, nutrients and organic mater
from estuaries to the near coast, playing an important role in their transport.

The main characteristics of these plumes have been studied since the early 50’s of the XX
century using numerical model applications. One of the first studies were realized by Takano
(1954a,b, 1955) using an idealized model with a straight coast. In the following years the
impact of diverse river plumes was analyzed using numerical model applications: as examples
are the Columbia River Estuary (USA) (Stefnsson and Richards, 1963), Chesapeake Bay
(USA) (Boicourt, 1973) and the Connecticut River Estuary (USA) (Garvine, 1974).

The characterization of the plume anatomy was studied, firstly, by Garvine (1982). The
author split the surface plume in three regions: source, near-field and far-field plume. These
regions have distinct characteristics and also different impact in the transport of soluble and
dissolved materials. More recently, Horner-Devine et al. (2009) have proposed an alteration
to the previous classification, decomposing the near-field plume in pulse, tidal plume and
residual re-circulating plume.

Also, the influence of submarine canyons in plume outflow was studied by Weaver and
Hsieh (1987). Here the authors observed that in the presence of a canyon near the estuary
mouth, the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief provides a strong forcing term for the
barotropic flow, resulting in an along shelf propagation of the plume where is observed an
increase of the energy; following the previous study, Chao (1988) has concluded that the
existence of a shelf slope reduces the seaward excursion of the plume bulge.

The influence of the estuarine outflow in the adjacent coastal shelf was also identified
by Yankovsky (2000). In this work, the role of the outflow channel shape and the width-to-
depth ratio of the estuary mouth was observed, revealing an important role in dynamics of
the plume.

Kourafalou et al. (1996) identified the plumes structure for different wind stress scenarios,
and they have found that during favourable downwelling wind, the plume enhanced the effect



4 Introduction

of the coastal current in the region, confining the buoyancy close to the coast. Conversely,
favourable upwelling winds produce a larger offshore plume propagation (or expansion).
The same conclusion was obtained by Hickey et al. (1998), Fong and Geyer (2001) and
Fong and Geyer (2002) in their studies.

During the last decade, the plume dynamics of several Portuguese estuaries has been
studied. In 2010, Mendes had implemented a circulation and transport model for the Ria
de Aveiro Lagoon, classifying it as near-field and surface-advected plume, according to the
Hetland (2005) proposed methodology. Sousa et al. (2014a,b) evaluated the influence of
the Minho river in the Rias Baixas (NW Spain) hydrography using different wind pattern
and river discharge scenarios. Those authors concluded that under northward wind, the
Minho river plume can reach Ria de Pontevedra (Spain).

For the adjacent area of the Tagus estuary there are a few studies about plumes
propagation and characteristics. One of the first analysis of the plume propagation behaviour
was realized by Vaz et al. (2009b). These authors studied the estuarine plume propagation
based on a nested 3D baroclinic model with 35 vertical layers highlighting the impact of
the Tagus Estuarine plume in the coast. Offshore Ekman transport induced by southward
winds produces a maximum displacement of the plume water of about 40 km offshore. Also,
Valente and da Silva (2009) have studied the turbid signal in the Tagus Estuary mouth
using a 3 year sequence of MODIS-Aqua nLw551 satellite product, concluding that the
plume has a fortnightly scale variation, presenting small dimensions after neap tides and
higher dimensions after spring tides. The dimension of the turbid area can increase with
river discharge and winds which are consistent with the results obtained by Mendes et al.
(2014) for the Douro river plume, where was not observed an evidence of an existing plume
for river flow lower than 148 m3s?1.

More recently, Vaz et al. (2015) reveal the impact of Tagus estuary plume in adjacent
coastal waters properties, such as, water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll concentration.
In their study, the authors propose as future work, the implementation of better atmospheric
forcing, justified by the existence of topographic features, such as Serra de Sintra, which
can influence the impact of the Tagus estuarine plume in the circulation and hydrography
of the adjacent coast.

1.2.2 Circulation model - MOHID

The use of circulation models brings a strong forecasting and hindcasting capability
to the study of coastal and estuarine areas. One of those models is the numerical model
Water Modelling System (MOHID), a 3D baroclinic finite volume marine model designed
for the study of estuarine and coastal regions. This model uses several modules to compute
circulation, water properties transport and biogeochemical features of estuarine and coastal
systems, being possible the addition of new ones, once that the model is an open source
code.

MOHID is used in many different systems, presenting a large versatility. As examples,
Gomez-Gesteira et al. (1999) evaluated the residence time of the NW region of Spain,
taking advantage of the particle tracking module. Saraiva et al. (2007) have used MOHID
to investigate the impact of nutrients loads in the main Portuguese estuaries, while Sousa
et al. (2013) evaluated the Minho river plume dynamic and its influence in the Rias Baixas.

The Ria de Aveiro lagoon has been also studied during the last years thought the
application of MOHID. In fact, studies focused on circulation (Vaz et al., 2007; Picado
et al., 2013) and transport of properties (Vaz et al., 2009a; Mendes, 2010) were performed in
order to fully characteriz the lagoon’s hydrodynamics. The impact of bathymetric changes
in the Lima estuary hydrodynamic were investigate by Rodrigues et al. (2012) using also
MOHID.

Moreover, the hydrodynamic of the Tagus Estuary has been studied through numer-
ical experiments based on MOHID applications. Leitão et al. (2000) implemented a 3D
application for the Tagus region of fresh water influence in which, the authors observed
the influence of Serra de Sintra in the rotation of the wind field capable of generate strong
barotropic currents. Fernandes (2005) implemented an operational application for the Tagus
Estuary and Vaz et al. (2009b) take one first step on the characterization of the Tagus
estuarine plume. In the following years several circulation and water transport studies were
performed in order to highlight the estuarine and coastal features of the system, evaluating
aspects as the tidal propagation, residual circulation and cohesive sediments dynamics (Vaz
et al., 2011; Dias et al., 2013; Vaz and Dias, 2014; Franz et al., 2014). One recent work
studies the SST and chlorophyll in the adjacent region of the estuary (Vaz et al., 2015).

This model was also used to study the hydrodynamics and transport process at other
estuarine system. In fact, Coelho et al. (2000) conducted a circulation and water transport
study in Guadiana Estuary, where they concluded that with river discharger higher then
1000 m3 s?1 fulfil the entire estuary with fresh water. A Sado Estuary implementation of



6 Introduction

MOHID was performed by Martins et al. (2001) using a generic vertical discretization to
highlight estuarine dynamics in the system. A 3D implementations for the Lagoon of Ria
Formosa was performed by Silva et al. (2002) aiming to understand the Faro-Olhão inlet
processes. The effect of coastal waves on sea level inside Obídos Lagoon was assessed by
Malhadas et al. (2009), where results showed that lagoon sea level remains above offshore
sea level during storm wave periods.

The versatility of MOHID system allows the necessary conditions to be used as a
operational model. In fact, the Technical University of Lisbon (UTL) used the Portuguese
Coast Operational Modelling System (PCOMS) based on MOHID application, that covers
all the continental Portuguese territory to produce daily forecast of coastal circulation,
hydrography and biogeochemistry (oxygen, chlorophyll and nutrients) maps (Mateus et al.,
2012).

1.2.3 Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

Coupled ocean-atmosphere datasets from observations and numerical model output are
steadily increasing the amount of available data to produce estuarine and coastal studies
(Liu and Weisberg, 2005). Petrou (2004) estimates that less of 5% of all remote sensing
images are ever seen or used by the scientific community. Therefore, new pattern detection
techniques have been developed to analyse those datasets.

The non-linearity of ocean and atmospherics dynamic make the pattern recognition
harder and challenging. One of those new techniques is the Self-Organizing Map (SOM),
an unsupervised neural network based on competitive learning (Kohonen, 1988; Vesanto
et al., 2000). To demonstrate the SOM capability, Liu et al. (2006b) have performed a
comparative test using the sum of a sinusoidal wave and concluded that SOM successfully
identified all the input wave periods. Futher studies by Liu and Weisberg (2007) concluded
that the SOM patterns were more intuitive and accurate than the principal mode of the
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) method.

SOM algorithm implementation in climatology field began in the late 1990s, using
daily sea level pressure data to identify atmospheric circulation patterns (Hewitson and
Crane, 2002), sea level patterns over North Atlantic Region (Schuenemann and Cassano,
2010) and air temperature and humidity spatial variability (Reusch et al., 2005). Also,
Kropp and Klenke (1997) have used SOM for the analysis of 170 sediments samples with
different biological and geochemical conditions, concluding that SOM managed to shrink a
11-dimensional data manifold into a 2-dimensional subspace preserving all relevant features

of the data set.
Richardson et al. (2003) and Risien (2004) retrieve surface pattern currents and variability

of the Benguela upwelling region (Southeaster Atlantic), while Cheng and Wilson (2006)
used SOM to identify vertical pattern of currents for the Hudson River estuary (USA) using
233 day Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) segments.

Liu and Weisberg (2005) and Liu et al. (2006a,b, 2007) have characterized the West
Florida Shelf region (USA) using different datasets (SST, High-Frequency (HF) radar and
ADCP). Liu et al. (2009) used a 3D model dataset, for the region of Columbia River (USA),
to identify the pattern of estuarine plume, highlighting its bi-directional propagation. The
authors observed the influence of wind on the plume dimension, with a smaller bulge under
downwelling wind events and larger bulges under upwelling wind events.

1.3 Structure of this work

Concerning the structure of this dissertation it was divided in five chapters. Chapter 1
presents a description of the main objectives and a literature review of relevant aspects to
the study. In Chapter 2, a detailed description of the study region, giving special focus
to the adjacent coastal area of Tagus estuary, is performed. In Chapter 3, the numerical
model implementation and methodology followed during thesis are described.

The results and discussion of the validation and scenarios results are presented in
Chapter 4. Finally, in Chapter 5 an overview of the results, presenting final conclusions
and providing some future research suggestions is made.





Chapter 2

Study Region

The study region is located on the Portuguese central west coast between 38.0?N and
39.5?N, and comprises the Tagus Estuary and the near coastal ocean (Figure 2.1). This
region is located in a highly populated region, subject to an enormous natural and human
stress. The topography of the adjacent region of Tagus estuary is considered relatively flat,
with the 200 m isobath located roughly at 30 km offshore of Tagus estuary mouth. However
the area comprises a complex bathymetry, constituted by three submarine canyons: the

(SC), Lisbon (LC) and Nazaré canyons (NC) locations. Blue circle represent QuickScat
location and white triangle the EMG.

10 Study Region

Nazaré, the Lisbon and the Setubal canyons. These canyons extend beyond the 10?N with
more than 2000 m depth.

The wind regime in the region is strongly influenced by the Azores high-pressure system.
The pressure difference between the centre of Azores high-pressure and Portugal varies
from 1 mbar in winter to 8 mbar in the Summer. This gradient is responsible by the rise of
strong north/north-westerly winds, affecting the region (Fiúza et al., 1982).

In this region, wind-driven upwelling occurs when equatorward winds induce net offshore
Ekman surface transport, resulting in a divergence of nearshore transport, conversely
favourable downwelling winds induce an Ekman surface transport toward the coastal region
(Fiúza et al., 1982; Silva, 2008).

In adition to the wind effect on coastal currents, the Portuguese west coast presents an
generally equatorward flow, known as the Portuguese Current (PC). PC is characterized
as an upper circulation flow with little seasonality that extends from the 10oW to about
24oW (Maillard, 1986). In the continental shelf, during autumn and early winter, a
north poleward flow (near the 200 m depth) is observed. This is known as the Portugal
Coastal Counter Current (PCCC) (Ambar and Fiúza, 1994). This flow results from the
geostrophic adjustment of weak eastward oceanic flow, driven by the large-scale meridional
baroclinic pressure gradient (Frouin et al., 1990; Pérez et al., 2001). During the upwelling
season, PCCC fades because of the northerly winds, giving place to the Portugal Coastal
Current (PCC). Both currents are typically located in a narrow band between 10 ? 11oW
(Pérez et al., 2001). All these coastal currents may act to change the propagation pattern of
the Tagus estuarine plume, since they can intensify (or de-intensify) the wind and estuarine
discharge currents.

According to Mason et al. (2005), the main water source of the upper layers (&gt;300 m)
of the West Iberian coastal waters is the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water sub tropical
branch (ENACWst). During upwelling events, ENACWst is the main source of the advected
water south of Nazaré canyon and, according to Ríos et al. (1992) the main observed water
source in the Lisbon bay.

2.1 Tagus Estuary

Estuarine circulation and exchange processes are forced by tide, freshwater discharges
and atmospheric conditions. It is fundamental to assess the circulation and hydrographic
characteristics of the estuary, once that these will have a direct role on the estuarine-coastal



2.1. Tagus Estuary 11

exchange.
The Tagus Estuary covers an area of about 320 km2 of which 40% are tidal flats (Silva,

2012). It is the largest estuary of the Iberian Peninsula and one of the most extensive
wetlands in Portugal (Dias, 1993). On its shores is located the highest population density
zone of Portugal, the metropolitan region of Lisbon (Figure 2.2).

The estuary has a pear-shape with roughly 30 km long and can be morphologically split
in three distinct zones (Rusu et al., 2009; Neves, 2010):

• An upstream area with low average depth (? 2 m), presenting large intertidal zones.
Here, the connection with the river is made through a channel with an average width
of 200 m (location in 38.86oN, 9.03oW );

• The Central area (known as Mar da Palha) with an average depth of 7 m. This zone
is the largest of the estuary, reaching 15 km wide. In this zone freshwater is mixed
with the ocean water (located between 38.65oN, 9.12oW and 38.86oN, 9.03oW );

• The inlet channel or corridor (known as corredor) has 15 km length and is 2 km wide
and present the deepest area of the estuary, with a maximum depth of about 40 m.
This region is the connection with the ocean and presents the faster flow, over 2 ms?1

(Vaz et al., 2011) . The mouth of the estuary is usually considered the section São
Julião da Barra - Bugio.

Figure 2.2: Tagus Estuary region.



12 Study Region

The estuary hydrography is mainly controlled by the tidal propagation and fluvial
discharge (Vaz et al., 2011). The estuary is mesotidal, with a typical neap tide of 0.8 m and
spring tide of 4.0 m (Fortunato et al., 1997). The tide has a dominant role in the estuary
dynamics, since the tidal prism is on the order of 600 × 106 m3 in comparison with the
8.2 × 106 m3 of river flow per tidal cycle (Neves, 2010).

According to Fortunato et al. (1999), floods take normally one hour more in comparison
to ebb, leading to a dominant ebb flow. This ebb dominance results in higher current
velocities during ebb, reaching 2 ms?1 in spring tides (Portela, 1996; Vaz and Dias, 2014).

2.1.1 River discharge

The main freshwater tributary of the estuary is the Tagus river. The river rises in Serra
de Albarracin (Spain) and travels around 1000 km before discharging in the Atlantic Ocean
near Lisbon. In its route, drains a basin which is the second largest of Iberian Peninsula
reaching almost 81 000 km2, of which 30% are in Portuguese territory (Vis et al., 2010).

The Tagus river discharge usually presents pronounced annual and inter-annual variations
(Vale and Sundby, 1987). The discharge regime becomes modulated after the 50’s decade
of the XX century after the building of several dams in the Tagus river basin (Macedo,
2006). The annual average discharge of Tagus river is between 300-400 m3s?1 (Macedo,
2006; Neves, 2010; Vaz et al., 2011) but monthly averages can vary between 1 m3s?1 and
2200 m3s?1 (Loureiro, 1979). The estuarine freshwater budget is controlled by the inflow of
three main rivers (Tagus, Sorraia and Trancão rivers). A statistical analysis for these rivers
inflow was performed using daily river discharge data available from Agência Portuguesa
do Ambiente (APA) website (snirh.pt). The Tagus river analysis was performed using data
from the the Ómnias station (18E/04H) for a period ranging between 1978 and 2001. For
this period an average discharge of 335 m3s?1 was observed.

The other two rivers (Sorraia and Trancão) display a lower average annual discharge,
when compared to the Tagus River (Figure 2.3a). As for both rivers there are no monitoring
stations available near the connection with the Tagus estuary, were considered the nearest
measuring stations to the discharge point. For the Sorraia River, data from the stations of
the Ponte de Coruche (20F/02H) and Ponte de São Estevão (20E/02H) were used, for the
period of 1976-1980. The same approach was implemented for the Trancão River, using the
stations of Ponte Canas (20C/01H) and Ponte Pinhal (21C/01H), for a period between the
years of 1979 and 1989. From the data analysis annual river discharges of 39.3 m3s?1 and
1.7 m3s?1 for Sorraia and Trancão rivers, respectively. These values are consistent with

those found by Fortunato et al. (1999) (with 35 and 2.5 m3s?1, respectively).
From Figure 2.3b a strong seasonality on total freshwater discharge to the estuary is

observable, with higher values registered during the winter period. On the other hand,
during the summer the freshwater discharge is considerable low. The statistical analysis of
freshwater discharge in the estuary reveals that the Tagus River contributes with 80% of
the total inflow, leaving 19% to the Sorraia River and less than 1% to the Trancão River.

In Tagus River, during winter, 5% of the discharge observations are lower than 44 m3s?1

or higher then 1875 m3s?1, showing high variability (Table 2.1). In Summer, the variability
is lower, with 5% of observations below 14 m3s?1 or over 340 m3s?1.

2.2 Wind influence

The influence of the wind stress on ocean surface circulation and hydrography has
been largely observed on plumes and other oceanographic features (Sousa, 2013). For
the study region, upwelling regimes are highly dependent of the northern wind stress
component (Vaz et al., 2009b). Therefore, the use of inaccurate surface wind intensity
and direction, as atmospheric forcing may modify the circulation model results. Thus, an
accurate reproduction of wind patterns is a key point for numerical model applications,
especially for a study region characterized by its large spatial variability. To illustrate this,
three wind roses generated with data for the full years of 2004-2008 at three locations
(Figure 2.4), located 50 km apart of each other, are presented in Figure 2.5.

The QuickScat data corresponds to daily remote sensing wind sensor observations.
These data show a predominance of winds from N and NNW, with 19.6% and 16.7% of
occurrence, respectively (Figure 2.5a). Regarding the Estação Meteorológica da Guia (EMG)
station, representative of the Tagus estuary mouth, a N (17.0%) and NNE (16.4%) wind
predominance for the same period was observed (Figure 2.5b). Finally, the station near
the Lisbon airport shows a NW/NNW predominance with 18.5% and 18.2%, respectively
(Figure 2.5c).

These results suggest a strong spatial wind variability in the study region, both in terms
of wind intensity and direction. The presence of the Serra de Sintra, 20 km north of EMG,
that might be the reason for the rotation of dominant winds and intensity changes. These

results show the importance of the application of a high-resolution atmospheric model to
provide accurate boundary conditions to the coastal/oceanic circulation model.

Numerical Models and Methodology

3.1 Circulation model

In this study an implementation of MOHID (MOdelação HIDrodinâmica) is used.
MOHID is a three-dimensional model developed and maintained by the Marine and Envi-
ronmental Technology Research Center (MARETEC) at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST).
This open-source project allows any person to submit a new set of functions to the model.
Open-source models permit researchers from different areas to give further contributes to
the models.

The first version of MOHID stacks back to the middle 80’s of the XX century, when
the model was only a two-dimensional tidal model written in IBM Mathematical Formula
Translation System (FORTRAN) 77 (Neves, 1985). Since then, MOHID has suffered signif-
icant advances, such as: three-dimensional capacity (Santos, 1995), lagrangian transport
module (Leitão, 1996) and water quality modules (Miranda, 1997).

One important feature of MOHID is the ability to simulate estuarine environments (Vaz
et al., 2007; Malhadas et al., 2009; Franz et al., 2014; Vaz and Dias, 2014; Vaz et al., 2015),
and also, large scale circulation (Leitão et al., 2005; Vaz et al., 2009b; Sousa et al., 2014a,b).
To accomplish the objectives of this work two model applications were implemented: one
for the estuarine area and other for the coastal adjacent area.

3.1.1 Physical descritization

MOHID solves the three-dimensional incompressible primitive equations assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium and the Boussinesq and Reynolds approximations. The primitive

17

equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates for incompressible flows. The following
equations have been derived taking into account these approximations and more details
can be obtained in Santos (1995), Leitão (2003) and Vaz (2007).

pressure, ? the density and ?? is anomality, ?(?) is the free surface density, t is the time, h
is the depth, ? is the earth velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.

The calculation of ? is obtained as function of water temperature and salinity by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) equation of
state (Fofonoff and Millard, 1983).

where C is the property concentration, K the diffusion coefficient and FP is the gain or
loss term.

The surface fluxes (importante for the heat transport) are composed by the momentum,
sensible heat, latent heat, evaporation and infrared radiation (Chapra, 1997). The wind
stress is calculated according to Equation 3.4:

?uw = ?aCau10
?
u210 + v210 (3.4)

where ?uw is the surface stress induced by the wind, ?a the air density, u10 and v10 are the
horizontal components of the wind measured at 10 m height above sea surface and Ca is
the drag coefficient (Riflet, 2010).

The model horizontal discretization is performed using an Arakawa C grid (Arakawa,



3.2. Model implementation 19

1966), while for the vertical coordinate an hybrid and generic scheme, which allows to choose
between z-level, sigma and lagrangian coordinates (Martins et al., 1998; Riflet, 2010).

3.2 Model implementation

As previously referred, two model implementations were used throughout this thesis.
Both applications are composed by nested grids and follow the downscaling methodology
used by Leitão et al. (2005) and Vaz et al. (2011).

The applications use three levels of one-way nested grids with different resolution. The
estuarine model is a full 2D application that runs offline and is used to calculate the
exchange flow between the Tagus estuary and the adjacent coastal area, while the coastal
model is a full 3D application used to compute the propagation of the estuarine discharge
on the coastal region.

3.2.1 Tagus Estuary model

The estuarine model implementation follows the procedure developed by Vaz et al.
(2011) and Silva (2012). They present a 2D nested implementation with three domains
(Figure 3.1). The first domain (E1) covers the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula and
Morocco and is a 2D barotropic tidal model that is forced at the open ocean boundary with
the tidal solution from the Finite Element Solution 2004 (FES2004) model (Lyard et al.,
2006). The grid has an horizontal resolution of 0.06o (? 6 km). The second domain (E2) is
a 2D domain with 0.01o resolution, covering the West coast of the central and southern
regions of Portugal. Finally, the third domain (E3) is composed by 335 × 212 cells with
variable horizontal resolution (0.01-0.002o) covering all the Tagus Estuary and the adjacent
coast.

Freshwater discharges from the Tagus, Sorraia and Trancão rivers, were imposed at E3
land boundary, obtained from APA website (snirh.pt). Atmospheric forcing was imposed,
in all E3 domain, using data from the EMG station. The models time step was 180 s, 60 s
and 15 s for E1, E2 and E3, respectively. Further description is available in the Table 3.1.

The estuarine model has been validated by Vaz et al. (2011), using harmonic analysis
results of measured and predicted sea surface elevation in 12 stations along the estuary.
The results of the validation show a deviation lower than 5% of the local tidal amplitude
for most of stations, with an average difference of 5o in phase for the main constituent M2.

Consequently, the implementation of this model was considered to be able to reproduce the
main patterns of the Tagus estuarine circulation.

The estuarine model was used to calculate the exchange flow between the estuary and
the near shelf that will be used as landward boundary condition for the coastal model.

3.2.2 Coastal model

The coastal implementation used in this work follows the procedure developed by Vaz
et al. (2009b) and uses three nested domains to compute circulation, heat and salt transport
in the region off the Tagus Estuary (Figure 3.2).

The first domain (D1) represents the entire Portuguese continental coast (10.5oW,
36.6oN and 6.1oW, 43.9oN), and is a 3D baroclinic model based on PCOMS model (Mateus
et al., 2012) with an horizontal resolution of 0.06o (? 6 km) and 50 vertical layers (7 sigma
+ 43 Cartesian until the bottom). The second domain (D2) works as a 3D downscaling
level with 0.02o (? 2 km) of horizontal resolution, representing the region between Sines
(37.6oN) and Figueira da Foz (40.4oN). At last, the third domain (D3) represent the region
of the Tagus estuary with a spatial horizontal resolution of 0.005o (? 500 m) between 38.2o

and 39.5o N.
The model D1 gives the SSE, u, v and w velocity components, salinity and water

temperature to model D2, which is a 3D baroclinic model with 47 vertical layer used to
downscale the solution to the coastal model D3, which is used to compute the propagation
and main features of the Tagus estuarine plume. D3 is a baroclinic model with 46 vertical
layers (7 sigma layers on the first 8.7 m and Cartesian coordinates from this depth to the
bottom).

Additionally, the atmospheric forcing for D1 was provided by the MM5 atmospheric
model forecast, with a spatial resolution of 9 km interpolated for the circulation model grid



22 Numerical Models and Methodology

Figure 3.2: Numerical bathymetries used in each domain of the coastal model, with depth
in meters relative to the hydrographic null.

(Sousa, 2002; Trancoso, 2012).
The bathymetry of D1 is based on SRTM 30" topo-hydrographic database. D2 and

D3 grids are based on the grids from ETOPO1 and GEBCO topo-hydrographic data. D3
numerical grid also uses other high-resolution available data for the estuary mouth. See
Table 3.2 for summary of the coastal implementation. The model time step is 180 s, 60 s
and 15 s for D1, D2 and D3, respectively.

The atmospheric forcing that was imposed in the D2 and D3 domains is predicted from
the WRF model run by the Núcleo de Modelação Estuarina e Costeira (NMEC) (Rodrigues
et al., 2015). The data were composed by hourly outputs of air temperature, relative
humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, with spatial resolution of 2 km.

At the D3 landward boundary, water exchange with the estuary is imposed, using the
calculated output from in the Tagus Estuarine model application.

3.3 Validation

Model validation is defined as the procedure where the model outputs are compared
with in situ measurements to prove the ability of the model in reproduce observations
trends or patterns. Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be realized for SSE, u and v
components of surface current, temperature and salinity.

In this study, two different water statistical parameters will be calculated, following the
procedure by Dias and Lopes (2006). The parameters are:

• RMSE - the root mean squared error calculates the absolute measure of the model
deviation from data, being one of the most used error parameter to assess tidal model
performance (Dias and Lopes, 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006):

RMSE =

where N corresponds to the number of records and Xobs and Xmodel represent observed
and calculated data, respectively. For local comparison of SSE, values between 5 and
10 % should be considered very good (Dias et al., 2009).

where values of 1 correspond to a perfect adjustment between predictions and obser-

should be considered excellent (Dias et al., 2009).

The validation was performed using different datasets. SSE validation was performed
using water elevation measurements from the Cascais tide gauge. Surface currents are from
an HF radar of the Portuguese navy installed to cover the region near the mouth of the
Tagus Estuary, confining the "discharge bay". Salinity and water temperature observations
are from the AQUA-MODIS remote sensor.

In this study the SSE predictions from the model D3 was compared with observations
of the Cascais’s tide gauge. A period of 31 days, between 3-July-2012 and 3-August-2012
was simulated and were used two distinct approaches to evaluate the results: time series
and harmonic constituents comparison.

Data from coastal HF radar have increased surface information on coastal currents.
The project SIMOC (http://www.hidrografico.pt/simoc.php) maintained by the Instituto
Hidrográfico (IH), is responsible for two radars in the study region, located in Forte de São
Julião da Barra (38o 40’N, 9o 19’W) and Cabo Espichel lighthouse (38o 24’N, 9o 12’W).
The HF radar follows the implementation of the Sines radar (Fernandes and Agostinho,
2008) and works at a 12 MHz frequency with a spatial resolution of 1.4 km. Radar data
are obtained in a irregular grid covering all the region near the Tagus Estuary mouth, with
a hourly time step. Circulation model predictions were interpolated to the radar data grid,
with the same time step. According to Stewart and Joy (1974) and Sentchev et al. (2013),
for a 12 MHz frequency, the radar measures correspond to the integration of the first meter
of the water column.

3.3.1 Satellite data

The use of remote sensing imagery (i.e. MODIS ocean colour data) of SST is a valuable
tool in the observation of large-scale oceanic processes. Furthermore, the spatial high-
resolution of these images (? 1 km) are useful to the validation of heat transport models.



3.4. Atmospheric model 25

The remote sensing data used in this study was obtained from the MODIS sensor, a
key instrument onboard of the Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. MODIS sensor acquires data
in 36 spectral bands in a 2300 km wide swath with a nadir nominal resolution of 1000
m (Nishihama et al., 1997). The data used here were Level2 (Lv2) products available at
Oceancolor website (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov). The long-wave SST product used
was obtained applying an algorithm that uses the MODIS 31 and 32 bands at 11 µm and
12 µm. In each image the sensor performs a quality evaluation of the remote data. A quality
flag of 0 indicates best quality while 4 indicates complete failure. therefore, for the analysis
comparison all pixels with quality flags higher than 1 were removed from the images. This
threshold was used since a quality flag of 1 can be representative of upwelling events (low
temperatures of SST not expected in the sensor climatology), high river discharge or even
clouds (NASA, 2015).

Salinity is a natural tracer for river plumes, but, in coastals region remote sensing
imagery do not provide good resolution. For this variable several studies have identified
a significant correlation between the surface salinity and turbidity (Valente and da Silva,
2009; Mendes et al., 2014; Fernández-Nóvoa et al., 2015), based on the diference of optic
properties from the estuarine discharge to the ocean waters.

The identification of the Tagus estuarine outflow was performed using as proxy the
high reflectivity plume waters, which are probably justified by the existence of suspended
particulate matter in it. Taking advantage of the available radiance bands in Lv2 product,
diverse tests were performed using the bands in 483-672 nm range. The most suitable for
this study was the 555 nm (nLw555) radiance band, which is consistent with the results
from Nezlin and DiGiacomo (2005) and Mendes et al. (2014) for their studies on San Pedro
Shelf (southern California) and Douro estuarine plume, respectively.

The evaluation of the water temperature and turbidity from the model was performed
using a period from July to December of 2012, which was concurrent with the HF Radar
observations.

3.4 Atmospheric model

As previously referred, wind stress plays a key role on the spreading of estuarine plumes,
therefore a proper meteorological forcing condition should be taken into account for an
accurate reproduction of the water-air interaction (e.g. costal circulation and hydrography).

For the study region there are no high resolution atmospheric data available, being



26 Numerical Models and Methodology

difficult to successfully force the circulation model and present accurate results. Also,
the orography of the Serra de Sintra, which acts as a natural wall to the northern wind
propagation generating a "shadow" effect to the estuary mouth, can produce misleading
results regarding coastal hydrography and circulation as pointed out by Vaz et al. (2015).
Therefore, in order to overcome this difficulty was implemented an atmospheric model for
the study area, with 2 km of spatial resolution. For this purpose, and in the frame of this
work, was implemented for the region under study the Weather Research and Forecasting
model (WRF) version 3.6.1 (Skamarock et al., 2008). This model has being widely used, not
only by researchers, but also by institutions as national meteorological institutes (Pereira
et al., 2013). The implementation developed uses three two-way nested domains. The
downscaling methodology follows a domain ratio of 1/3, with the father domain (WRF1)
covering most of the Iberian Peninsula with a spatial resolution of 18 km. The two other
domains (WRF2 and WRF3) present 6 and 2 km resolution, respectively (Figure 3.3).

The atmospheric model boundary condition is predicted each 6 hours by the Global
Forecast System (GFS) model (NCEP, 2003) with 1o spatial resolution. The vertical
discretization was composed by 28 unequal spaced layers at each domain.

Figure 3.3: Nested domains used for atmospheric simulations.

3.4.1 Validation of the WRF model

Aiming to validate the meteorological model outputs, was performed an assessment
of the WRF3 model. Model predictions of air temperature, wind intensity and direction
were compared with EMG station measurements (Figure 2.4). The visual assessment of the
model results revealed that it can accurately reproduce the general variability of the data
(for both variables). Then a quantitative evaluation was performed comparing the model
predictions and the EMG station observations. The EMG station is located near Cascais,
a very urbanized area, situated south of Serra de Sintra.

The wind intensity and direction are two important variables to characterize the
atmosphere dynamics. However, they are difficult to predict with accuracy, especially at
the Lisbon Bay due the existence of Serra de Sintra. From Figure 3.4 is noticeable that
model overestimates wind intensity, presenting RMSE values of 4.89 ms?1 (27% of the local
wind intensity amplitude). For the wind direction, the model presents better performance
(RMSE of 41.8o (13.4% of the local amplitude)), which reveal an adequate reproduction of
the temporal patterns. Some discrepancies could be attributed to the fast changes induced
by maritime breeze in this area (Alcoforado and Lopes, 2003).

Concerning the air temperature predictions, the WRF outputs show a SKILL score of

predictions.

0.83 with a RMSE of 1.91oC (17.5% of the local amplitude). Regarding solar radiation and
relative humidity a very good correlation between in situ data and model predictions was
computed, with SKILLS of 0.97 and 0.82, respectively. Full quantitative assessments are
presented on Table 3.3.

The atmospheric model implementation was considered successfully validated for the
study region. The results show that the model is able to accurately reproduce the main
atmospheric features of this region, being able to produce accurate boundary conditions for
the coastal model.

3.5 Wind patterns assessment in the Tagus region

The influence of the wind stress on the surface of the ocean has a large impact on surface
current variability. This is quite true in estuarine plume propagation studies. The adjacent
coast of the Tagus Estuary is highly influenced by the wind variability. For that reason
a seasonal assessment was performed in order to identify the dominant wind patterns, in
terms of more frequent and significant wind directions and intensity.

The wind characterization was performed through the analysis of data from the meteo-
rological station of the Lisbon airport (Figure 2.4). This station is located in the middle of
the city presenting one of the longer time series of data in the region, and can be considered
representative of the wind patterns in the study region. The available data comprises the
period from 2001 to 2007.

The events were splinted following the Beaufort wind force scale that relates the wind
speed to observed conditions at sea. The statistics of wind intensity and direction (Table
3.4) has identified the probability of calm winds (bellow 1.5 ms?1) to be near 8.1%. Light,
gentle and moderated breezes present similar percentages, corresponding to a total of 84.6%
and in only 7.3% of the cases the wind is higher than 8 ms?1.

The seasonal variability was evaluated in order to identify the main wind direction
for each season. The original data was divided in winter (DJF - December, January and
February), spring (MAM - March, April and May), summer (JJA - June, July and August)
and autumn (SON - September, October and November) and wind roses for each season
are presented in Figure 3.5.

During winter, the dominant direction is from NE with about 20% of the occurrence,
followed by NNW direction with 12% of occurrences (Figure 3.5a). 80% of the wind intensity
was lower than 5.5 ms?1.

Spring season shows a strong influence (37%) of winds from NW and NNW (Figure
3.5b). The wind intensity increases comparatively to the winter, with less than 70% of the
cases below 5.5 ms?1. Strong winds from the N-NW quadrant were identify in the region.

The Summer season results are very similar to the spring results (Figure 3.5c). Here
energetic winds with over 40% of observations higher than 5.5 ms?1 are observed. The major
predominant directions are: NW and NNW with 30% and 28% of occurrences, respectively.

Autumn season presents a similarity with the winter season, specially in intensity. More
then 80% of the observations show a wind intensity lower than 5.5 ms?1 (Figure 3.5d).

The previous results are similar to those obtained by Angi (2011) and Lopes et al.
(2013). Moreover, Alcoforado (1987) has identified about 45% of the days with predominant
northern winds.

3.6 Self-Organizing Maps

In order to analyse the model predictions, a new method based on a neural network
is used to study the region surface variability. The method is similar to a classic EOF
analysis, but presents more effective results on the computation of coastal variability (Liu
et al., 2006b)

The Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that
have the capacity of learning without supervision. This algorithm was developed in the



3.6. Self-Organizing Maps 31

early 80’s of the XX century by Kohonen (1982) during the research of auto-associative
memory. Here, the SOM as "visualization and analysis tool for high dimensional data" is
described. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for clustering, dimensional ordering and
reduction, classification and sampling (Lobo, 2009).

The SOM analysis was performed using the SOM Toolbox 2.0 (Vesanto et al., 2000).
This toolbox was generated for MATLAB R© being maintained by the Helsinki Technical
University. It is a freely available on the institution website (http://www.cis.hut.fi/).

To perform a SOM analysis, each data series was reshaped to a row vector forming a
2D matrix (data array). At each interaction, the row vectors are used to update the weight
of the SOM via an unsupervised learning algorithm. The final weight vectors are then
reshaped back to the original grid and provide different data patterns depending on the
mapping requested (illustrative of SOM working system in Figure 3.6).

This training is an interactive process. At each training step one sample vector x from
the input data set will be chosen randomly and the distance between it and all the weight
vectors will be calculated. The calculation follow the Euclidian distance method, where the
closer neuron to the input vector x is the wining neuron, called Best-Matching Unit (BMU).

Figure 3.6: Schematic illustration of SOM organizing system (adapted from Richardson
et al. (2003)).



32 Numerical Models and Methodology

The toolbox BMU calculation follows the procedure from equation 3.7:

?x?mc? = min{?x?mi?} (3.7)

where ?.? represents the distance measure. The toolbox has improved from the original
code, introducing interpolation of missing values and mask for excluding certain variables.

After the identification of the BMU, the SOM weight vectors are updated moving the
BMU closer to input vector. This leads to a stretching of the BMU and is topological
neighbours in direction of the vector sample. The calculation of unit i weight vector follows
equation 3.8:

mi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ?(t)?(t)[x(t) ?mi(t)] (3.8)

where t stand for time, x(t) is a random input vector from input data set at time t, ? the
neighbourhood kernel around the winner c and ? the learning rate for the snapshot t.

The training of SOM is usually performed in two phases: the first one, using a high
learning rate and neighbour radius; in the second phase, both of the previous parameters
are set for small values right from the beginning of evolution calculus. This action leads the
first training of the SOM to reproduce the same space of the input data and then adjust
the previous information’s improving the training map (Vesanto et al., 2000).

3.7 Scenarios description

Once the coastal model is validated, it may be used to assess the impact of several
scenarios of river inflow and wind in the Tagus estuarine plume propagation, namely in
salinity and water temperature variability.

In order to study the region variability, a set of scenarios were designed and the effect
of the wind and river inflow in the coastal hydrography studied (Figure 3.7).

In this study three scenarios were simulated: Scenario A (ScA) considered as reference,
composed by discharge and wind forcing, Scenario B (ScB) without wind forcing and
Scenario C (ScC) without Tagus estuarine discharge. In each scenario three distinct
Tagus River discharges (Figure 3.8) were implemented: 1500 m3s?1 (Discharge1) and
3000 m3s?1 (Discharge2) representative of the 90 and 99 percentile results of the long
discharge series analysis, respectively, and a 5000 m3s?1 (Discharge3) river discharge
representative of a high discharge event registered in March-April of 2013. The scenario

simulation was performed for a 23 days period, starting in 8 November of 2012.
Two new scenarios were calculated from scenarios A to C. Scenario D (ScD) results

from the difference of ScA and ScB while Scenario E (ScE) results from the difference of
ScA and ScC, aiming to understand the influence of wind and river inflow, respectively.

Results and Discussion

4.1 Model validation

The estuarine model used in this study was previously implemented by Vaz et al. (2011)
and used to study circulation and hydrography features of the Tagus Estuary (Vaz et al.,
2011; Silva, 2012). More details on the model’s implementation can be found in these
studies. Therefore, the results presented in this section are only related with the coastal
model validation procedure.

4.1.1 Sea surface elevation

SSE from the model was compared with data from the Cascais tide gauge, in order to
evaluate the model skill in reproducing water elevation in the coast near the Tagus mouth
(Figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1: Predicted (?) and observed (•) normalized SSE (m) for Cascais tide gauge
used in the validation of the coastal application.

36 Results and Discussion

The predicted SSE follows the observed records, with a root mean squared error (RMSE)
and SKILL of 0.33 m (9.8% of relative error to local observed amplitude) and 0.96,
respectively, revealing the model’s accuracy in reproducing the tidal wave propagation in
the region near Tagus mouth.

In order to quantify the main differences between model predictions and observed data, a
comparison of the amplitudes and phases of the main solar (K1, O1, Q1) and lunar (M2, S2,
N2) constituents was performed using the harmonic analysis software T_Tide (Pawlowicz
et al., 2002). A 31 days time series of hourly observed and predicted SSE data was used
(Table 4.1). The overall distribution of the observed and predicted amplitude and phase
are similar. The M2 and S2 constituents are responsible for more than 80% of the tidal
energy. M2 presents an amplitude error of 0.5 cm and a phase lag of 3.4 (about 7 minutes),
while for S2 the amplitude error was 0.4 cm with a lag of 4.5o (about 9 minutes). For the
diurnal constituents the amplitude errors range from 0.3 to 1.4 cm and for the phase errors
between 0.6 and 26.5o, respectively. The tide is semi-diurnal, with a Form Number (FN) of
0.14 (Defant, 1960).

In general, the harmonic analysis results show that the circulation model reproduces
well the tide amplitude and phase.

4.1.2 Surface current

The model skill in reproducing surface currents was also tested. These are key and
challenging validation parameters due to their characteristic high spatial and temporal
variability. Here surface water velocity (first meter) from the model was compared with
data from the HF radar installed in the region. As a measure of the mean deviation of the



4.1. Model validation 37

model predictions to the HF radar observations, the RMSE and SKILL were calculated
using data of November 2012. For this period, 622 HF radar data fields (of 744 possible)
were available. Both error calculations were performed for the zonal (u) and meridional (v)
current components, at each radar grid cell.

The mean RMSE value across the region is 14.9 cms?1 and 15.9 cms?1 for zonal and
meridional component, respectively. That is, these values represent relative errors to local
amplitude of 22.0 and 17.8% in u and v current components, respectively (Figure 4.2).
SKILL assessment for the same period (Figure 4.3), shown a better representation by the
circulation model of the v current component, with a mean value of 0.71, while for the u
current component, the obtained mean value was 0.52.

HF radar measures could suffer from limitation that may produce erroneous RMS and
SKILL values. One of those limitations is the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP),
that appears when the angle between two radial vectors is too large to enable accurate
resolutions of the component perpendicular to the radial (Chapman et al., 1997; Trujillo
et al., 2004; O’Donncha et al., 2015). This limitation could be the reason for the low
quality results obtained in the baseline region (line that connect the two HF radar stations),
specially for the u current component.

Despite the RMS and SKILL values, those are consistent with studies by other authors.

38 Results and Discussion

Figure 4.3: SKILL assessment between model simulations and HF radar measure current in
the (A) zonal and (B) meridional component of velocity.

In fact, O’Donncha et al. (2015) performed a similar study in Galway Bay (Ireland), where
they obtained a mean RMSE deviation over 23.8 cms?1 with SKILL score of 0.7 (zonal)
and 0.56 (meridional) for current velocity.

In order to evaluate the temporal variability of surface currents in the region, and to
compare model predictions with radar data at specific points within the plume pathways
(Figure 4.3 - P1, P2, P3 and P4), several monitoring points were chosen (Figure 4.4).

In P1 is visible the influence of the tide on both current components. Additionally, the
estuary mouth bathymetry presents special features, as the existence of a small island, Bugio.
For that region, a circulation model using a grid of 500 m could not be enough to fully
describe the circulation here, the RMS error is 18.2 and 20.7%, respectively. Moreover, this
region present complex circulation features with two “permanent eddies” (Fortunato et al.,
1997; Vaz and Dias, 2014), which can modulate the circulation, turning it less predictable
with a 500 m resolution model. However, for other points is found a good reproduction of
the observed data, with RMSE values of local amplitude for u velocity component of 18.1,
23.7 and 20.3% and for v velocity component of 12.6, 16.4 and 17.5%, for stations P2, P3
and P4, respectively.

Despite of differences, the model predictions can describe the spatial and temporal
variability of surface currents, therefore, was considered validated for the region.

zonal component and right column the meridional component of current.

4.1.3 Satellite vs model SST and salinity

Once the circulation model is considered validated, it is necessary to evaluate the
transport model. One way to evaluate water temperature and salinity predictions is to
compare model outputs with satellite imagery. This would give a spatial assessment of
the local patterns for these variables. In this thesis an assessment was performed for the
simulation period, from July to December of 2012 (Figures 4.5 and 4.6). Images that present
more valid pixels after quality flag cleaning were chosen to compare with model outputs.

Overall deviation of predicted SST comparatively to the remote sensing images shows
values under 2oC. In spite of the low difference value, the objective is the accurate spatial
variation reproduction. The model could reproduce the general spatial variability of SST,
with higher values found in regions far of the coast, decreasing towards the coast region.
Despite the similar patterns found, it is important to highlight the existence of small
deviations. Low temperature bands near coast tend to be thinner in the predicted than in
the remote sensing data, while offshore high temperature zones, observed in remote sensing
images, have lower temperature values in the model predictions.

In order to evaluate salinity surface patterns, images from the MODIS nLw555 were used
as plume tracers (Figure 4.6). Low salinity fields resulting from the Tagus Estuary discharge
were compared with the high turbidity values. In general, the model could reproduce the
spatial pattern of the plume, with the low salinity regions located in the same regions of
high turbidity. Under southward winds, remote imagery shows a S-SW propagation of the

plumes followed by the predictions of the transport model (Figure 4.6 - A,B,C - F,G,H).
For transitional (Figures 4.6 - D and I) and downwelling winds (Figures 4.6 - E and J), the
model predictions of the plume follow the high turbidity values with good accuracy.

Occasionally, high turbidity regions were observed under southward winds. This could
be the result of chlorophyll blooms, which may change the optical properties of the waters.
Similarly, near the Sado Estuary mouth region (south of Cabo Espichel) high turbidity
values are observed, resulting probably from the estuarine discharge. However, this estuarine
outflow is not implemented on the transport model disallowing their comparison.

Taking into account all the previous results, the transport model was considered validated
and, therefore, it can be used to study issues concerning water temperature and salinity
local variations.

4.2 Scenarios

4.2.1 Self-Organizing Maps

In this work, the variability of the salinity in the coast off the Tagus Estuary was study
using the SOM toolbox. The evaluation of coastal variability was performed using predicted
fields of surface salinity from the previously defined scenarios: ScA, ScB and ScC.

The results of the simulation with atmospheric forcing (observed wind intensity and
direction, Figure 4.7 - F) and a maximum river discharge of 5000 m3s?1 (ScA-A3, Figure
4.7 - G) are depicted in Figure 4.7. Four nodes were used to reproduce the spatial salinity
variability identified by the SOM analysis, in which the Node 1 is representative of the pre-
discharge signal, and represents 28.2% of the local variability, while Node 2 is representative
of a transitional wind regime, and represents 25.1% of the local variability. Node 3 represents
a upwelling favourable wind period after high river discharge (28.5% of the local variability).
Node 4 is representative of the high river discharge signal and counts for 18.2% of the total
variance of the system.

A BMU number represents each SOM spatial node, at each instant. BMU’s time series
were sorted by plume size and compared with local wind stress and river discharge time
series (Figure 4.7 - E, F and G). The relation between discharge and BMU’s time series
is well reproduced for the high discharge event observed until day 18, following a BMU
sequence of 1-2-3-4-3-2-1. For the rest of the simulation period, the wind stress obtains
the higher relation with BMU’s 1 and 3, being representative of strong and weak upwelling

favourable winds, respectively. Under downwelling favourable winds, BMU3 is the most
representative.

In Figure 4.8 is depicted the SOM analysis of the ScB-B3 in order to obtain the influence
of the freshwater inflow, with a maximum estuarine discharge of 5000 m3s?1 (ScB-B3,
Figure 4.8 - F) without wind stress forcing. The four nodes represent the stages of the
plume evolution, under high discharge without wind forcing (Figure 4.8 - A, B, C and D).
The Node 1 represent the initial state, representing 24.5% of the total variance. Nodes 2
and 3 are the result of the increasing estuarine discharge and represent 12.5 and 19% of the
total variability, respectively. The full developed plume resultant of the high river discharge
is represented by the Node 4 (44% of the total variance).

From the SOM analysis is visible that all nodes show a surface bulge confined to shore.

Similar effects were identified in several studies of surface-advected plumes on the North
Hemisphere (Chao and Boicourt, 1986; Chao, 1988; Kourafalou et al., 1996). These authors
have concluded that the surface buoyant outflows spread radially from the estuary mouth
and are deflected to the right by the Coriolis force.

BMU’s time series were ordered by the plume dimension and compared with the river
discharge time series (Figure 4.8 - E and F). The relation between series shows a delay in
the maximum river discharge and the observation of the BMU4. The BMU’s follow the
1-2-3-4 sequence followed by a slow reduction from 4-3-2. The slow reduction of the surface
salinity may be the result of the lack of wind mixing and lower transport velocities.

The results of the simulation without estuarine discharge (ScC-C3) to evaluate the wind
effect on the plume propagation are represented in Figure 4.9. SOM analysis used four
nodes to reproduce the spatial salinity field. Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3 were representative
of 16.8%, 14.4% and 10.3% of local variability, respectively, while Node 4 is the dominant
node, with 58.5% of the local variability. In all nodes is visible that the salinity variability
is controlled by a northward coastal circulation observed during the simulation period, that

could be the PCCC, observed during the winter months. In the region of Tagus Estuary
mouth is observed the salinity signal produced by the period of spin up before the scenario
implementation.

Each SOM spatial node was represented by a BMU number, at each instant, being
ordered by the dimension of high salinity region and compared with local wind stress time
series (Figure 4.9 - E and F). It was not identified a relation between SOM salinity BMUs
time series and wind stress. Nevertheless, when performing a relation with the node’s
surface current was possible to identify that under downwelling favourable winds (Node 3)
is observed an increase of the surface current towards north.

4.2.2 Influence region

In this section, the propagation area of the Tagus estuarine plume is identified, evaluating
the role of the main forcings and how estuarine buoyancy affects the hydrography in different
areas of the study region, by identifying regions where salinity increase or decrease.



46 Results and Discussion

In this section the calculated scenarios, ScD representative of the wind influence and
ScE for discharge influence were used. In both scenarios, downwelling (16th November) and
upwelling (18th November) favourable wind events were identified, and the mean salinity
for each day calculated. The spatial salinity fields are obtained by subtracting ScB (coastal
current + estuarine outflow) and ScC (coastal current + wind) to ScA (coastal current +
estuarine outflow + wind) in order to obtain ScD (wind effect) and ScE (discharge effect).
The river inflow for ScA and ScB is 3000 m3s?1.

The effect of southern/northern winds in the horizontal salinity structure is depicted
in Figure 4.10. It can be observed a band of positive values of salinity close to the coast
during downwelling (further south) and upwelling periods. This is induced by the wind
stress that confines (expands) the plume close to the coast (to offshore) during downwelling
(upwelling) periods. This is the result of the subtraction of the results of ScA and ScB,
in which, this last scenario produces a low salinity band advected to the north with low

4.2. Scenarios 47

salinity values (estuarine).
It can be observed in the velocity fields that, surface currents are modulated by the

wind, and that during downwelling (upwelling) the currents are to the north (south) in the
region close to the west coast and near estuary mouth.

The effect of the estuarine discharge in the horizontal salinity structure is depicted in
Figure 4.11 and is the result of the subtraction of ScA and ScC. In opposition to the results
shown in Figure 4.10, here the effect of the estuarine discharge produces bands of negative
values. That scenario of wind plus coastal current (ScC) presents higher values of salinity
in the coastal region, which is expected since a null estuarine discharge was considered in
this scenario. In the Figure 4.11 it is shown that, during downwelling events a band of
negative values is found close to the estuary mouth and in the west coast. During upwelling
events, the estuarine discharge is advected towards the south in the region of the Lisbon

and no winds periods under different Tagus River discharges. Blue color represents a typical
northward wind period, when the plume is confined close to the west coast in a direct
response to wind forcing. Here, is observed a plume that goes from the Lisbon Bay until
north of Peniche is observed. Orange color represents the observed SW path followed by the
plume under southward winds, where it is advected onto the shelf as result of the combined
effect of estuarine discharge and favourable upwelling winds. At last, the dashed grey lines
represent the region of influence of the estuarine discharge under the no wind scenario.
Here, the plume forms a bulge in the region close to the estuary mouth and due to the high
estuarine discharge there is a band of estuarine water, which is advected up to the mouth
until the regions close to Peniche.

4.2.3 Cross sections

The definition of surface-advected plume lies in the fact that the buoyant inflow re-
mains primarily in shelf top, forming a thin layer that has little contact with the bottom,
exceptionally near estuarine mouth (Yankovsky and Chapman, 1997). In this section,
the x and y velocity components are evaluated through the cross-sections depicted in
Figure 4.13. Here the main objective is to evaluate the plume thickness and preferential
velocity directions, through, three cross-sections defined. Section S1, located at 38.67oN
aims to represent the Tagus Estuary predominant outflow directions, therefore, u current

component was evaluated. In S2 cross-section the narrowest region of the D3, located at
38.79oN, v component is evaluated aiming to analyse the velocity component and plume
path under northward winds. Finally, cross-sections S3 is a meridional slice at 9.52oW used
to analyse the water movement due to a southern and northern wind pattern (u component
is analysed). All the analysis in these sections were performed for ScA-A3, the scenario
with full atmospheric forcing and the maximum river discharge value (5000 m3s?1).

For each section was chosen a downwelling (A), transitional (B) and upwelling (C) wind
representative period. The results are depicted in Figures 4.14-4.16.

Under northward winds in S1 sections, the plume is observed between the 9.5oW and
the coast. In the region adjacent to the coast (9.3oW) the plume comprises the full water
column, while in the rest have a thickness of about 15 m (Figure 4.14 - A). The predicted
currents show an intense negative u current component on the region where is observed the
plume near the surface layers. Under the plume bulge is observed a positive u flow, that
could be the reposition of the surface offshore advected waters, in order to maintain the
equilibrium. A transition period in section S1 results in a lower thickness of the buoyant
plume and its offshore displacement (Figure 4.14 - B). The thickness of the plume is reduced
to 10 m, while in all the region located west of 9.5oW a negative u current velocity in
the water column is observed, due to the water offshore advection. Finally, Figure 4.14
- C describes an upwelling event where the plume is confined to a region between 9.3oW

negative (dashed lines) values. (A) downwelling, (B) transitional (C) and upwelling winds.

and the shore. The overall analysis of the S1 section reveal three different regions: near
the estuary mouth mainly controlled by the estuarine discharge (9.3oW - coast) with a
negative u current component; a region between 9.5-9.3oW with bottom positive u velocity
component and an offshore region (west of 9.5oW) that responds directly to wind.

In cross-sections S2, located in the region of Cabo da Roca, is possible to identify the
estuarine buoyant flow in the first 10 m of the water column, in a narrow band of 12 km
adjacent to coast during a downwelling event (Figure 4.15 - A). In this region, on the
surface a strong northward flow induced by the plume is observed, while in depth a larger
area with negative flow is observed. This could be due to a compensatory mechanism,
observed by other authors under buoyant plumes (Mestres et al., 2007; Jurisa and Chant,
2013). Offshore region of S2 (9.6oW to west) shows positive v current components in all the
column water, with higher values located in the middle section (near 9.7oW) with values
over 0.2 ms?1.

In the transition between northward and southward winds, the plume spreads offshore
for 18.5 km with a reduction of the plume thickness (Figure 4.15 - B). A detachment of the
plume from the shore is noticeable. This could be the result of the negative v component
high values. The offshore region presents a decrease of the positive v values in the superficial
layers.

For southward winds the existent plume vanishes, while new buoyancy plumes are not

and negative (dashed lines) values. Downwelling winds (A), transitional (B) and upwelling
winds (C).



52 Results and Discussion

transported to this cross-shelf sections once that, under southward winds, the plume path is
to SW (Figure 4.15 - C). Surface currents present a negative v component, while the vertical
column present three distinct areas: near shelf with negative v component, an intermediate
region (9.8-9.65oW) with a positive intense v jet (near 30 m depth) compressed between
negative v flows (top and bottom) and an offshore region with positive v component in
most of the column.

Cross-sections S3 covers a wide region of the adjacent coast to Tagus Estuary. In
this sections, under northward winds the plume can be identified in the region between
38.6-39.1oN with a depth of about 15 m (Figure 4.16 - A). The south region of S3 presents
negative u velocity values, while the northern region presents positive u velocity values. The
central region have a complex pattern with the surface layer being forced by the buoyant
plume.

With the wind rotation to south (upwelling favourable), surface currents begin to
present negative u values (Figure 4.16 - B). The salinity field gradient decreases while is
observed vertical mixing and an horizontal surface spreading. For the upwelling event, a
plume break-up is observed and is possible to identify two distinct areas with low salinity
(Figure 4.16 - C). The southern area is the offshore advection of the Tagus Estuary outflow,
while the northern area is the result of the old plume field being advected from the coast

to offshore (crossing the section in analysis). Negative u velocity are observed for all the
section. Nevertheless, bellow the 30 m is observed a positive u flow region, due to the
upwelling of waters from the deeper areas.

North-south S3 cross-section analysis allowed to classify three distinct current zones
(Figure 4.16): a southern region that presents negative u velocity values; a central region,
between 38.6 and 39.4oN, controlled by the wind and estuarine inflow; and the northern
region where was observed positive u velocity. These results show a distinct hydrodynamic
pattern between south and north regions of the domain, illustrating the region of influence
of the Tagus estuarine plume.

An overall illustration of the typical observed plume pattern and v velocity component for
the S2 cross-shelf section was performed and presented in Figure 4.17. The cross inside the
circle represented positive v velocity and negative flows are represented by concentric circles;
the dimension of the circles represents the magnitude of the signal. Under downwelling
winds the presence of a plume confined to the shore is noticeable, with strong positive v

positive values in the upper layers (Figure 4.17a).

For an upwelling event, the offshore spreading of the plume (to the west)is observed,
while the plume shrunk (Figure 4.17b). Positive v velocities were observed in the near shelf,
in the bottom and top layers, though is observed a relative strong negative v jet in the
middle of the water column.

Conclusion

All the proposed objectives for this study were achieved, within the main goal to research
the Tagus Estuarine plume under different wind regimes and river discharges. With that
purpose, a new circulation and transport model (MOHID) application was implemented.

An offline 2D circulation and transport model was implemented for the Tagus Estuary.
This implementation was previously validated by Vaz et al. (2011) and Silva (2012) and
used to calculate the exchange flow between the estuary and the near shelf region, to be
used as landward boundary condition in the coastal model.

The costal application is a 3D baroclinic model based on PCOMS model, with a spatial
horizontal resolution of 0.06o and 50 vertical layers. A downscaling methodology was used
to improve spatial resolution to 500 m in the Tagus ROFI. The model validation was
successfully performed comparing predictions with avilable data sets.

The coastal model predictions of surface currents were validated trough the comparison
with a Portuguese Navy HF radar dataset. The results show a good reproduction of the
observations with a mean RMSE of local amplitude of 22.0% and 17.8% for u and v velocity
components, respectively, with the same accuracy degree of other identical studies. The
coastal model transport validation (water temperature and salinity) was performed by
comparing model results and remote sensing imagery from MODIS sensor. Results shown
that model SST show an identical surface pattern, with a maximum deviation lower than
2 oC. For surface salinity field assessment, MODIS nLw555 turbidity band was used to
identify the plume bulge at the Lisbon Bay. Results showed that the model predictions of
the plume dimension and location were identical to remote sensing high turbidity regions
at the region.

The coupling methodology was then considered able to reproduce observations and,

55



56 Conclusion

therefore able to simulate estuarine and coastal processes for the study region.

After the model validation, five scenarios were implemented to study the plume under
different wind and discharge events. Scenario A was considered as the reference scenario,
with a complete atmosphere and river discharge forcing; scenario B is a no wind stress
scenario and scenario C does not consider estuarine discharges. Scenarios D and E resulted
from the subtraction of scenario A - scenario B and scenario A - scenario C, respectively.
For each scenario, three distinct simulations were performed using different river discharges
(1500, 3000 and 5000 m3s?1).

The use of self-organizing maps, an unsupervised neural networks, allowed to identify
the variability of the region. That methodology was used to assess the scenarios A, B and
C. Results showed that the salinity pattern was controlled by the discharge during high
river discharge, while for low discharge values the wind stress was the main forcing. In
absence of estuarine discharge, surface salinity has no relation with wind, and the coastal
circulation was the predominant forcing.

The differences obtained in the scenarios D and E results give a spatial idea about
regions of influence of discharge and wind, respectively. This study allowed to identify the
influence area of the wind and discharges in the plume propagation. The results show that
the river discharge has a direct role on the plume dimension, with higher discharge values
producing larger bulges. Surface currents were also analysed and the results show that
the estuarine discharges produce an increase of current velocity, under downwelling winds,
near 0.9 ms?1 for a 3000 m3s?1 river discharge, while for upwelling winds, an increase of
0.2 ms?1 was observed.

The plume path under downwelling favourable winds follows a northward direction,
following the coastline, while for upwelling favourable winds, the observed flow directions is
the SW. This represents a confinement and expansion of the Tagus estuarine plume to and
from the coast. In the absence of wind stress, the estuarine jet is controlled by the Coriolis
force with a rotation to the right of the flow and the plume propagation to the north. For
all the analysed wind regimes, the buoyant plume dimensions were controlled by the river
discharge.

In order to evaluate the plume thickness, three cross-sections for salinity along the
D3 domain were set. At same time, the horizontal velocity components were analysed.
Results shown that with a river discharge of 5000 m3s?1, the estuary mouth region is
fully dominated by estuarine waters in all wind regimes. The higher plume thickness was
registered under downwelling events, 15 m depth, being reduced with the wind rotation to



57

south (10 m). Horizontal currents show the quick response of the circulation to the wind
rotation, specially in the region near shore. Under the plume bulge a persistent jet was
observed, with opposite direction to the plume propagation.

In overall, under downwelling events the plume is advected to the north, reaching, as far
as, Peniche for a river discharge of 5000 m3s?1, while for a river discharge of 1500 m3s?1

its excursion is limited to Cabo da Roca. Upwelling events shown a SW plume advection
confined to the Lisbon Bay for all the studied river discharge.

Estuarine plumes are relevant to many coastal environments aspects, such as: biological
production enhancement, primary production improving, costal pollution and geochemical
transport. Many of those factors have strong impact and are socio-economic important
to the region population. As future work, the incorporation of a biogeochemical model
is proposed. Recent news indicate that the Barreiro Harbour will be upgraded to an
important harbour, expecting an increase of maritime traffic. That possibility, increases
the importance of the study of oil spills, being that a possible new module incorporation to
the model. An increase of the atmospheric model horizontal resolution could improve the
circulation predictions, especial in the mouth region of the estuary. The online coupling of
the estuarine and coastal application in a unique one, is also one of the future objectives.
