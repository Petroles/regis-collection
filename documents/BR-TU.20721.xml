agradecimentos 
 

Esta tese demorou a ver a luz do dia mas, ainda assim, dificilmente teria sido 
concluída sem o apoio de muitos que quero aqui reconhecer. 
 
Gostaria de começar por agradecer aos meus orientadores Luís Pinheiro e
Cristina Bernardes por apoiarem o meu projecto de doutoramento. A
curiosidade, espírito de trabalho e amizade do Luís foram uma enorme força
para levar este trabalho a bom porto. Faltam-me palavras para reconhecer 
com justiça os inúmeros contributos da criatividade e esforço do Luís para a 
realização desta tese.  
 
Ao Pedro Terrinha e à Fátima Abrantes, do Departamento de Geologia
Marinha (DGM) do LNEG, ex-INETI, ex-IGM (e isto apenas durante a minha 
estadia), agradeço os muitos anos de amizade e apoio que me permitiram
beneficiar da experiência de um grupo de trabalho único, onde o trabalho de
equipa funciona e o bom ambiente fazem passar rapidamente os dias mais 
difíceis. Agradeço em particular aos que me acompanharam no grupo de
Geologia e Recursos, Pedro Terrinha, Hipólito Monteiro, Vasco Valadares,
Cristina Roque, Rui Quartau, Gabriela Carrara, João Duarte, Tiago Alves,
Tiago Cunha, José Vicente, João Noiva, Luís Batista e Carlos Pinto. 
 
A visão sobre o Método Científico perfilhado neste trabalho foi fortemente
influenciada pelas discussões com o António Ribeiro e o Hipólito Monteiro.
Estou-lhes grato pela amizade constante e por me terem mostrado porque é 
que a Ciência também tem o nome de Filosofia Natural. 
 
Durante este trabalho houve uma voz de crítica racional inquebrantável que 
muito melhorou esta tese. É escusado procurar uma saída fácil quando se 
discute interpretação sísmica (ou qualquer outra coisa!) com o Pedro Brito.
Agradeço-lhe a paciência, perseverança e amizade durante as nossas muitas,
longas e por vezes acesas discussões. 
 
Ao Vitor Magalhães, Serguei Bouriak, Cristina Roque, Rui Quartau e José 
Vicente agradeço toda a ajuda na preparação e execução dos cruzeiros. 
Agradeço ao Francisco Teixeira, à Zuzia Stroynowski e ao Tiago Cunha a
revisão de partes do manuscrito. 
 
Um agradecimento especial é devido à Margarida Henriques, cuja inteligência 
e esforço para ultrapassar a plasticidade da “burocracia moderna” na ciência
muito me facilitaram a vida.

agradeço terem partilhado a vasta experiência e conhecimento da Ria, bem
como o apoio que deram durante os cruzeiros, muito para além das suas
obrigações profissionais, sem o qual muitos dos perfis sísmicos adquiridos
nunca veriam a luz do dia.  
  
Este doutoramento foi apoiado por uma bolsa da Universidade de Aveiro e por
uma bolsa (FSRH/BD/2017/2004) da Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia 
(FCT). Os dados sísmicos foram adquiridos na Ria de Aveiro graças ao
projecto EICOS (PRAXIS/2/2.1/MAR/1750/95), ao projecto INGMAR (FCT-
PLE/4/98) e a três Acções Ciência Viva da FCT. 
 
O processamento e interpretação de muitos dos dados sísmicos foi possível 
graças ao apoio dado ao Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e
Inovação pela Landmark Graphics Corporation, via a Landmark University
Grant Program, e também, ao apoio à Universidade de Aveiro pela Seismic 
Micro-Technology, via um Kingdom Suite Educational User-License Grant. 
 
À minha família e amigos agradeço a paciência e os momentos perdidos,
passados longe ou atrás de um teclado. 
 
Não há páginas suficientes para agradecer à Sara, e mesmo que houvesse, 
creio que as minhas palavras não lhe fariam justiça.

resumo 
 
 

O metano é um gás de estufa potente e uma importante fonte de energia. A 
importância global e impacto em zonas costeiras de acumulações e escape de
gás metano são ainda pouco conhecidas. Esta tese investiga acumulações e
escape de gás em canais de maré da Ria de Aveiro com dados de cinco
campanhas de reflexão sísmica de alta resolução realizadas em 1986, 1999, 
2002 e 2003. Estas incluem três campanhas de Chirp (RIAV99, RIAV02 e
RIAV02A) e duas campanhas de Boomer (VOUGA86 e RIAV03). O
processamento dos dados de navegação incluíram filtros de erros, correcções
de sincronização de relógios de sistemas de aquisição de dados, ajuste de
“layback” e estimativa da posição de “midpoint”. O processamento do sinal
sísmico consistiu na correcção das amplitudes, remoção de ruído do tipo
“burst”, correcções estáticas, correcção do “normal move-out”, filtragem passa-
banda, desconvolução da assinatura e migração Stolt F-K. A análise da 
regularidade do trajecto de navegação, dos desfasamentos entre horizontes e
dos modelos de superfícies foi utilizada para controlo de qualidade, e permitiu 
a revisão e melhoria dos parâmetros de processamento. A heterogeneidade da
cobertura sísmica, da qualidade do sinal, da penetração e da resolução, no
seu conjunto constrangeram o uso dos dados a interpretações detalhadas,
mas locais, de objectos geológicos da Ria. É apresentado um procedimento 
para determinar a escolha de escalas adequadas para modelar os objectos
geológicos, baseado na resolução sísmica, erros de posicionamento
conhecidos e desfasamentos médios entre horizontes. As evidências de 
acumulação e escape de gás na Ria de Aveiro incluem turbidez acústica,
reflexões reforçadas, cortinas acústicas, domas, “pockmarks” e alinhamentos 
de “pockmarks” enterradas, horizontes perturbados e plumas acústicas na
coluna de água (flares). A estratigrafia e a estrutura geológica controlam a 
distribuição e extensão das acumulações e escape de gás. Ainda assim,
nestes sistemas de baixa profundidade de água, as variações da altura de
maré têm um impacto significativo na detecção de gás com métodos acústicos,
através de alterações nas amplitudes originais de reflexões reforçadas,
turbidez acústica e branqueamento acústico em zonas com gás. Os padrões 
encontrados confirmam que o escape de bolhas de gás é desencadeado pela
descida da maré. Há acumulações de gás em sedimentos Holocénicos e no
substrato de argilas e calcários do Mesozóico. Evidências directas de escape
de gás em sondagens em zonas vizinhas, mostraram gás essencialmente
biogénico. A maioria do gás na área deve ter sido gerado em sedimentos
lagunares Holocénicos. No entanto, a localização e geometria de estruturas de
escape de fluidos em alguns canais de maré, seguem o padrão de fracturas do
substrato Mesozóico, indicando uma possível fonte mais profunda de gás e 
que estas fracturas funcionam como condutas preferenciais de migração dos 
fluidos e exercem um controlo estrutural na ocorrência de gás na Ria.

abstract 
 

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and an important energy source. The
global importance and impact in coastal zones of methane gas accumulation
and seepage in sediments from coastal lagoon environments is still largely 
unknown. This Ph.D. investigates gas accumulation and seepage in tidal
channels of the Ria of Aveiro with data from five high resolution seismic 
surveys carried out in 1986, 1999, 2002 and 2003. These include three Chirp 
surveys (RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A) and two Boomer surveys (VOUGA86 and 
RIAV03). The navigation data processing included instrumental error filters, 
system clock synchronization corrections, layback adjustment and trace
midpoint position estimate. The seismic signal processing consisted in 
amplitude corrections, burst noise removal, static corrections, normal move-out 
corrections, band-pass filtering, spike deconvolution and Stolt F-K migration. 
The analysis of the track line regularity, the horizon misties and the first-break 
surface models were applied as quality control procedures, and allowed the
revision and improvement of the processing parameters. The heterogeneity of
the seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and resolution all constrain the
use of the data to mostly local but detailed interpretations and modeling of the 
geological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. A procedure is presented to determine
adequate choice of scales of these geological models based on the seismic
resolution, known positioning errors and mean mistie values. Evidence of 
extensive gas accumulation and seepage in tidal channel sediments from the
“Ria de Aveiro” barrier-lagoon includes acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections,
acoustic blanking, domes, pockmarks and buried aligned pockmarks, disrupted 
horizons and acoustic plumes in the water layer (flares). The stratigraphy and
the structural framework control the distribution and extent of the gas
accumulations and seepage in the study area. However, in these shallow
systems, tidal altitude variations have a significant impact on gas detection with 
acoustic methods, by changing the raw amplitude of the enhanced seismic
reflections, acoustic turbidity and acoustic blanking in gas-prone areas. 
Amplitudes are clearly stronger during low tide with maxima during ebb, 
decreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this pattern confirms that
bubbling and gas escape is triggered mainly by the falling tide. There are
accumulations of gas both in the Holocene sediments and in the Mesozoic
bedrock of marls and clays. Direct evidence of gas escape from drill-holes in 
the surrounding area has shown that the gas recovered in the “Ria de Aveiro” 
consists of biogenic methane. Most of the gas in the study area was probably
mainly generated in Holocene lagoon sediments. Nevertheless, the location 
and geometry of fluid escape features in some channels follows the fracture
pattern affecting the Mesozoic bedrock, indicating a possible deeper source of
gas and that these fractures function as preferential pathways for fluid 
migration and exert a structural control on gas occurrences in the Ria of Aveiro.

with profile P02C, profile P02B has a poorer signal to noise ratio and more burst noise. The 
change in acquisition speed imposed by the strong currents is clearly illustrated by the

Figure III-18: Rock piles from harbor infrastructure observed on a boomer profile as side

Analysis of these profiles illustrates the practical seismic resolution of the two datasets. The

corresponding to 18 cm for a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). The minimum separation of the 
reflections observed in the boomer profile is of 5 samples (0.5 ms, corresponding to 38 cm for 
a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). ................................................................................................... 73

Figure III-21: Relationship between profile separation, positioning errors and angular error of the 
modeled direction of a linear feature. This abacus plots lines of equal angular error for a given 
relationship of positioning error and profile separation. Increases in positioning error and/or 
decreases in profile separation result in a greater error of the modeled direction of a linear 
feature. The positioning error related irregularity of a modeled linear feature can be minimized 
by limiting data input from profiles with adequate separation. Axes are labeled in arbitrary but 
consistent distance units............................................................................................................ 78 

Figure IV-1: The study area: a tidal channel domain of the Ria de Aveiro barrier lagoon, 
Northwestern Portugal, that includes part of the Espinheiro and the Vila channels. The 
bathymetry of the study area shown here was derived from first break picks of the Chirp data 
acquired during the RIAV02 and RIAV02A cruises. This figure also shows the supra-tidal zones 
(dark grey) and the intertidal zones (light grey) surrounding the study area. ............................ 87

location of the seismic profiles shown in this paper. The inset shows the location of the 
available seismic lines and boreholes in the vicinity of the study area. Although there are no 
boreholes within the study area, the extent of the seismic coverage allowed the use of the 
particularly dense borehole data in the southern edge of the inset to calibrate the main seismic 
units, in particular the reflection corresponding to the top of the Cretaceous limestones and 
marls, and to adjust the vertical datum of the seismic surveys. ................................................ 90

profiles in the Espinheiro Channel. Also notice the marked difference in the strength and extent 
of the gas evidence on the profiles 2 and 3, acquired at low tide (stronger and more extensive), 
with the evidence on the profile 5, acquired at high tide (weaker). Location of the profiles is

the same features are observed here. The interpretation shows the Mesozoic horizons H1 
through H5. The evidence for the pockmark features are v-shaped depressions, most clearly 
seen in horizon H5, and acoustic transparency columns (indicated by fluid flow arrows) that 
affect most of the vertical section shown. There is good evidence for a fault (dashed line) which 
supports the hypothesis that the pockmark features were caused by fluid flow through fractured

Horizon H1 is mostly horizontal and the other horizons dip gently to the west. Horizon H3 has 
central area, 70m long by 40m wide, where interpretation is not possible due to strong acoustic

shear zones (possibly right lateral strike-slips – map view in inset b). The limited expression of 
the intense strain may result from hydraulic fracture processes caused by fluid flow through the 
higher permeability shear zones. The irregular Holocene reflectors observed above some 
shear zones may be a result of escaping fluids....................................................................... 130

amplitude values; the Cidade Channel data has no obvious clustering. Least squares linear

First break time coverage for the various tidal stages in the Terminal Sul area is heterogeneous 
with smaller TWT ranges during low tide and flood (75% of the samples between 5 and 7 ms) 
when compared with the TWT ranges during high tide and ebb (75% of the data between 5 and 
14 ms). First break times in the Cidade channel have a more homogenous range for all tidal 
stages (75% of the data is roughly between 12ms and 18ms). The TWT range heterogeneities 
of the Terminal Sul are greater than the tidal range (approximately 2m – 3ms) indicating that 
different zones of the Terminal Sul were sampled during the various tidal stages. ................ 140 

Figure V-26: Histograms of unstandardized residual first break amplitudes of the Chirp profiles 
acquired during cruises RIAV02 and RIAV02A, in the Terminal Sul and Cidade channel areas. 
Residual values were determined from the least square linear regression lines previously 
determined (see text for explanation). The Terminal Sul histogram is skewed towards a higher 
frequency of negative residuals, i.e. first break amplitudes lower than predicted are more 
frequent. This indicates that the linear regression may be a poor model for the observed time 
and amplitude samples, and is in contrast to the bell shaped histogram of the Cidade Channel.

Figure V-27: Box plots of first break amplitudes at each tidal stage of the Chirp profiles acquired

Amplitudes for the Terminal Sul are concentrated towards the upper end of the systems 
recording range (positive half of the 16 bits integer – 32767) indicating that many may have 
been clipped due to excessive gain during acquisition. Overall, amplitude values in the 
Terminal Sul are smaller during high tide with minima during ebb. Amplitudes for the Cidade

channel are broadly spread over the recording range, with higher values during ebb and low 
tide, and lower values during flood with minima during high tide. ........................................... 142 

Figure V-28: Box plots of unstandardized residual first break amplitudes at each tidal stage of the 
Chirp profiles acquired during cruises RIAV02 and RIAV02A, in the Terminal Sul and Cidade 
channel areas.  Residual amplitudes for the Terminal Sul are mostly within -2000 and +2000 
(75% of the observations). Interpretation of this plot difficult due to the suspected sampling 
problems of the various tidal stages in the Terminal Sul, and because of the linear regression 
was found to be a poor model of the sampled data. Residual amplitudes for the Cidade channel 
vary have different biases according to the tidal stage, with greater than predicted amplitudes 
during low tide with maxima during ebb; residual amplitudes during flood are evenly distributed 
around 0; the lowest residual amplitudes occur mostly during high tide. ................................ 143

Chapter 1. Introduction 
 

1.1 Nature and scope of this work 
 

Estuaries and coastal lagoons are prime locations from both a human and 

environmental perspectives. These systems encompass some of the most 

productive and diverse regions of the globe, and are the breeding grounds for 

multiple species. This wealth also attracted and still attracts human settlement, 

making these the areas with the highest population density of the globe. The 

economic importance of estuaries and coastal lagoons is also obvious, with 

oceanic and river trade lanes meeting at the harbor facilities that seem to grow 

relentlessly along its shores. Also, for all these reasons, anthropogenic impact is 

usually significant because of the widespread construction and polluting activities 

changing the landscape and ecosystems. The knowledge about the geological 

processes governing the evolution of estuaries and coastal lagoons is essential for 

the adequate assessment and management of its natural resources, for the 

evaluation of the risk of geological hazards and to provide fundamental knowledge 

for environmental impact studies. 

The Associated Laboratory, Center for Environmental and Marine Studies 

(Centro de Estudos do Ambiente e do Mar, CESAM) of the University of Aveiro 

Research Institute has a research group on Geological and Geophysical 

Processes which focuses on the dynamics of coastal and marine sediments. The 

work presented here was done within the framework of CESAMs’ Geological and 

Geophysical Processes research line, and its initial aim was to study the 

geological evolution of the Ria of Aveiro, a barrier lagoon located in on the west 

Portuguese coast, and its adjacent continental shelf using high resolution seismic 

reflection methods and borehole log data from water wells (see location of the Ria 

of Aveiro in figure 1). The initial exploration of the available data and of the first 

results from the seismic reflection surveys showed previously unknown seismic

evidence of gas in the profiles of the Ria of Aveiro (Pinheiro, L., pers. 

communication), and was intensively investigated by several cruises (Monteiro 

and Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a; 

Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). The investigation of these 

occurrences became the topic of this thesis (Duarte et al., 2007).

Introduction 
 
 

 

Estuaries and coastal lagoons are depocenters of organic-rich sediments 

which are sources of methane (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and Middelburg, 

2000). These systems are excellent and easily accessible natural laboratories to 

investigate the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation, migration and 

escape (e.g. Garcia-Gil, 2003). Nevertheless, the geological investigation of 

estuaries and, in particular, barrier lagoon environments is particularly difficult, 

because these are complex, very dynamic, fast changing and evolving systems 

that require extensive and detailed data for their study. In addition, the acquisition 

of large data sets is hindered by the methodological limitations imposed by the 

difficulty in accessing the geological objects, usually partially or permanently 

submerged, which also involves access to ship time. Furthermore, the spatial and 

temporal variability and the complexity of these shallow gas systems require 

dense grids of geophysical data in order to get representative sampling. As a 

result, the importance of the escape of methane gas from sediments of estuarine 

and lagoon environments to the atmosphere is still poorly known or 

underestimated, and has not been taken into account in the International Panel for 

Climate Change assessment reports of the geological emissions of methane 

(Hovland et al., 1993; I.P.C.C., 2001; Etiope, 2004; Judd, 2004). Estuaries and 

coastal lagoons where the loci in the geological past for the generation of large 

accumulations of oil and gas now being exploited. Accumulations of shallow gas in 

such present-day systems where the volume and concentration are adequate, 

may also be exploited for biogas, for local use in the near future, similarly to what 

is already happening in  African lakes and in artificial dairy lagoons (e.g. Williams 

and Frederick, 2001; Hirsch et al., 2005). Thus, understanding the importance, the 

controlling factors and the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation and 

escape in coastal shallow water systems may yield useful indicators for oil and gas 

exploration and contribute to the evaluation of the potential of present day biogenic 

methane gas in estuaries and coastal lagoons as a possible alternative energy 

source. 

This work was planned in order to implement methods to overcome the 

difficulties with processing sub-surface data from the Ria of Aveiro, acquired at

different times. Furthermore, it aimed to investigate the seismic evidence of gas in 

the sediments of coastal lagoons and the importance of understanding the 

controlling factors and the mechanisms of methane gas generation, its 

accumulation and escape. The work was structured around three major questions: 

 

• What are the best procedures to acquire and process the seismic 

reflection data in a shallow barrier-lagoon environment? 

• What are the types of seismic evidence of gas in the tidal channels 

of the Ria of Aveiro and what is the appropriate way to map them? 

• What are the geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage 

in the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro? 

 

This thesis was structured to present in separate chapters a self-sufficient 

answer to each of these questions. The chosen organization of the chapters 

allows for an efficient preparation of the work for publication in scientific journals, 

whilst, at the same time, maintaining an evolving character, addressing more 

technical issues first and addressing the more theoretical issues towards the end. 

The introduction, Chapter I, consists on the presentation of the nature and 

scope of the thesis, as well as, of the objectives and methods of the research. A 

more detailed and adequate account of the state of the art and methods specific is 

provided in later chapters. A general description of the study area, the Ria of 

Aveiro, is provided in Chapter II. The next three chapters are structured as 

research papers, each one of them addressing a specific topic this thesis. The 

methodological issues related to the acquisition and processing of high resolution 

seismic reflection data in shallow lagoons such as the Ria of Aveiro are dealt in 

Chapter III. Chapter IV, already published as a paper in Geo-Marine Letters, 

presents the main types of seismic evidence of gas in the Ria of Aveiro using the 

Espinheiro tidal channel sector as a case study (Duarte et al., 2007). The 

structural and tidal controls of gas in the Ria are discussed in Chapter V, using the 

data from the Cidade Channel and the Terminal Sul. The final chapter of this work, 

Chapter VI, presents a review of the answers to the questions that guided 

research, discusses the new issues that arose from this investigation and

Introduction 
 
 

proposes guidelines for future work in the study of gas generation and flow in the 

Ria of Aveiro, and in similar coastal environments. The thesis includes one 

Appendix with seismic evidence of gas, mainly to complement the figures of 

Chapter IV, which were of limited number due to constraints established by the 

rules of its publication in Geo-Marine Letters. The appendix also serves to 

document evidence of gas in other surveyed sectors of the lagoon that were not 

investigated in detail due to the sparse seismic coverage. 

 

 

1.2 Objectives 
 

This Ph.D. thesis studies gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of 

Aveiro barrier-lagoon with seismic reflection data. The distribution and extent of 

seismic evidence of gas were mapped out in major tidal channels of the lagoon 

and the structural and tidal controls of gas were investigated. The specific 

objectives were the following: 

1. To describe the data acquisition systems and to document the 

operational procedures used for future reference. 

2. To propose processing flows of the seismic signal and navigation 

data and discuss the results of the application of these flows.  

3. To assess the constraints imposed by the processed seismic dataset 

on the interpretation and mapping of geological features. 

4. to map the high-resolution seismic evidence of gas accumulation and 

seepage in the sediments of the surveyed tidal channels in the “Ria 

de Aveiro” barrier-lagoon 

5. to characterize the 3D geometry of the Holocene lagoon sediments 

architecture and of the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock, allowing 

the identification of structural controls on the fluid migration pathways 

and gas accumulation zones. 

6. to perform a statistical analysis of the amplitudes of the bottom 

reflection of the Chirp data in order to determine if there is a 

significant change in amplitude strength as the tidal cycle evolves

1.3 Methods 
 

The study of gas in the Ria of Aveiro presented here was based on very 

high-resolution 2D seismic reflection surveys (Boomer and Chirp), complemented 

by log data from water wells and geotechnical soundings. The seismic reflection 

data acquired in the Ria of Aveiro is of multiple vintages, and the acquisition 

systems used were an EG&amp;amp;G Uniboom system with a boomer source and a 

Datasonics Chirp system with a modulated chirp source. High resolution seismic 

reflection surveying of the Ria of Aveiro started in 1986 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 

1986) and a total of five surveys with Chirp and Boomer systems were carried out 

until late 2003 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; 

Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). 

Three of these surveys were done during the timeframe of this work: the Chirp 

surveys RIAV02 (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a), RIAV02A (Pinheiro and Duarte, 

2003b) and the Boomer RIAV03 survey (Pinheiro et al., 2003), and the author 

participated in the latest two (RIAV02A and RIAV03); the two earliest ones, the 

VOUGA86 Boomer survey (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986) and the RIAV99 Chirp 

survey (Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999), were revisited and also used here. The 

boomer data consists of approximately 65km of analog profiles and 47km of digital 

profiles. The digital chirp profiles total over 200 km. Positioning of the seismic 

profiles was done with GPS, DGPS and RTK-GPS systems. 

Seismic processing was carried out with SPW software package (Seismic 

Processing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience Corporation), and with Radex Pro 

(from Deco Geophysical). SEG-Y seismic data management and interpretation 

was carried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-technology Inc) and the 

Openworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics Corporation) seismic 

interpretation software packages.  

The available hydrological and geotechnical sounding log data of Ria of 

Aveiro is relatively extensive due to the significant human occupation of the area. 

Unfortunately, only a couple of hydrological core logs are available close to the 

seismic profiles. Still, these logs are close enough to the seismic profiles to allow a 

calibration of the main geological units. The geotechnical logs are mainly near 

 6 



Introduction 
 
 

harbor infrastructures in parts of the lagoon, and several are located in the 

neighborhood of the surveyed areas. These logs were used for the calibration of 

the vertical datum of the seismic profiles and for the geological interpretation. 

All available borehole, seismic and geographical data were collated into a 

GIS database (ArcGis, ESRI) which was used throughout this work for spatial 

computations.

Chapter 2. Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 

 

The Ria de Aveiro is a barrier-lagoon system, located along the northwest 

Portuguese coast, composed of a complex network of tidal channels, tidal flats, 

salt marshes and supra-tidal sand isles, separated from the sea by a sand-barrier 

and inlet, encompassing an area of approx. 530 km2, making it the largest coastal 

lagoon system in Portugal. It is located at the mouth of a drainage basin of 3,635 

km2, fed mainly by the Vouga River and its tributaries. The lagoon is a sedimentary 

basin overlying a Mesozoic bedrock whose topmost sediments consist mainly of 

Upper Cretaceous age (Maestrichtian). These Cretaceous sediments are mainly 

mad up of clays also deposited in a barrier-lagoon environment. At depth, the 

Cretaceous sequence consists of more diverse lithologies (sands, marls, and 

limestones) and hosts a multilayer coastal aquifer, the Aveiro Cretaceous aquifer, 

which extends over 1,800 km2 in the Aveiro region (Condesso de Melo, 2002). 

The main morphological, hydrographic, climatic, and geological features 

that characterize the Ria of Aveiro are presented in the following paragraphs, in 

order to introduce the basic background necessary to understand the object of this 

study. Some of this information is partly revisited and further detailed in chapters 

III, IV and V, tailored to the specific problems addressed in these chapters. 

 

2.1 The barrier-lagoon 
 

Sand-barrier 

The natural protection to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon is its shoreface sand 

barrier system that extends for 100 km, from Espinho, to the north, to Cape 

Mondego to the south (Fig. I-1). The sand beaches are of an intermediate dynamic 

domain (between reflective and dissipative) with a prevailing unique submarine bar 

at water depths of less than 10 m (Teixeira, 1994). The sub-aereal segment of the 

 9



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

beaches extends for 50 to 100 m, and is commonly characterized by a frontal 

dune, occasionally replaced by sand dykes, that reaches 9 m above the ZH 

(Hidrographic Zero). Littoral drift transports sediments from the northern river 

basins (e.g. Douro river basin) and feeds the beaches at the coast of the Ria de 

Aveiro. This fluvial sediment output as been steadily decreasing for the last 200 

years (Teixeira, 1994), and, nowadays, the Ria of Aveiro shoreline suffers from 

sedimentary deficit, particularly to the south of the lagoon inlet where significant 

shoreline retreat is occurring (Baptista et al., 2002). 

 

Inlet 

The lagoon communicates with the Atlantic Ocean via a dynamic inlet that 

suffered significant migration in the last 1000. By the late XVIII century the inlet 

was mostly closed and communication with the Atlantic interrupted (see the 

evolution of the Ria of Aveiro in Fig. II-1). Only after extensive engineering work at 

the inlet from the early XIX century until 1950s did the inlet acquire self-regulating 

capacity; with episodes of shoaling reducing the channel section causing 

increased current velocities and consequent greater erosion and, conversely, 

episodes of greater erosion increasing the channel section causing a decrease in 

current velocities, sediment deposition and shoaling (Abecasis, 1954; Teixeira, 

1994; da Silva and Duck, 2001).  

 

Tidal channels 

The inner lagoon is composed by a network of tidal channels that crisscross 

extensive tidal flats and salt marshes. The tidal channels are the deepest 

morphological elements of the lagoon, and distribute the tidal prism to the interior 

of the lagoon (see the main tidal channels location in Fig. II-2). A local terminology 

describes the hierarchy of the hydrographic network: first order channels, also 

called “Cales”, are always immerse and, generally, become deeper closer to the 

inlet; second order channels, called ”Esteiros”, promote the connection between 

”Cales”, isolate inner isles and almost dry up during more extreme low tides (e.g. 

neap tides); third order channels or ”Regueiros”, make up the incipient network 

over the tidal flats and salt marshes; they undergo considerable emersion and are 

 10

usually only totally flooded during the second half of the flooding (Teixeira, 1994).

unknown author of the black and white original from Abecasis, 1954). 

 
 

 

Tidal flats 

The tidal flats correspond to sandy to muddy deposits neighboring the tidal 

channels that emerge during low tide and submerge during the highest tides 

(Klein, 1967; Woodroffe, 2003). Teixeira (1994) described the three main evolution 

mechanisms for the tidal flats of the Ria de Aveiro. 

 

1. Natural differentiation of tidal flats from the marginal deposits of tidal 

channels is the primary mechanism for the generation of tidal flats. Margin 

sediments are reworked by changing tides forming flat surfaces which are 

drained by an incipient runoff channel network, and dip slightly towards the 

tidal channels.

 12 



 Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

2. Increasing tidal amplitudes during the second half of the 20th century are 

responsible for the majority of the tidal flats in the Ria de Aveiro (Teixeira 

94). This process increases channel bottom erosion, steepens channel 

margins and favors marsh levee construction, frequently colonized by 

Spartina. In this case tidal flats are formed from levee reworking. 

3. The increase in tidal amplitudes sometimes causes the formation confined 

basins dominated by tidal flats. This confinement is accomplished within an 

area delimited by connected tidal channels through marsh levee buildup, as 

described in point 2. The levees only allow inundation to occur near high 

tide, when most sediment transport occurs through suspension, causing the 

shoaling of these basins with flattened fine sediment deposits. 

 

Salt marshes 

The salt marshes are upper intertidal environments of mostly muddy 

sediments covered by a variety of halophyte vegetation (salt tolerant). They can be 

sub-divided in upper and lower salt marshes according to their degree of emersion 

which, in turn, determines flora distribution. The lower salt marshes are 

characterized by relatively higher salinity and longer periods of emersion, whereas 

the upper salt marshes are characterized by lower salinity and better oxygenation. 

Teixeira (1994) presents a case study illustrating the speed of the evolution of salt 

marshes in the Ria de Aveiro, where a tidal flat evolved to a salt marsh in 

approximately one century, indicating sedimentation rates of approximately 1.0 

cm/year. The upper marshes comprise 90% of all marshes of the Ria de Aveiro, 

cover approximately 35% of the intra-lagoon space, and most of the marsh 

deposits were already in place by late XVIth century (Teixeira, 1994). 

 

2.2 Climate and river discharge 
The climate of the Aveiro region is characterized by a prevalence of 

westerly winds during the winter which induce instability and precipitation.  Arid 

conditions prevail during the summer due to the northwards movement of the 

North Atlantic anti-cyclone, which carries with it the precipitation front. Thus, winter 

 13



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

precipitation tends to be three times larger than the precipitation during the 

summer. 

Average temperature fluctuates between 6ºC during the winter and 20ºC 

during the summer (Faria and Machado, 1979; Rebelo, 1992). Average annual 

precipitation in the lagoon is about 1000mm, and, usually, the October-March 

period receives ca. 75% of the annual precipitation and the summer trimester only 

receives 5%. The total drainage network that feeds the Ria of Aveiro is of 3109 

Km2 and includes nine hydrographic basins: 1 - Ovar creek; 2 -  Antuã river; 3 - 

Vouga river; 4 - Angeja creeks; 5 - Aveiro creeks; 6 – Águeda river; 7 - Boco river; 

8 - Cértima river; 9 – Mira river (see Fig. II-3). According to Loureiro et al. (1986) 

potential evapotranspiration of the Ria de Aveiro basin is of 730 mm, i.e. smaller 

than the average precipitation in the same area. 

The annual surface runoff to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon is approximately 2.0 

km3, corresponding to an average output of 1.37x106 m3 for each half tidal cycle 

(6h) (Teixeira, 1994). It should be noted that there are strong asymmetries in the 

runoff during the year, with the average annual runoff being approximately one 

tenth of the maximum annual runoff. 

Wind regime in the Ria de Aveiro is dependent on the dynamics of the 

Azores anticyclonic cell (Fiúza et al., 1982). The regime of steady northerly winds 

during the summer changes to more volatile conditions during the winter with 

frequent changes in wind direction. The thermal gradient between the ocean and 

continent, that changes with the day and night cycle, causes a local breeze climate 

that overprints the annual wind regime. Typically, daytime is marked by a westerly 

to northwesterly wind, which becomes increasingly stronger towards the afternoon. 

During the night, the winds rotate, blowing from the east to southeast, usually with 

lower velocity than during the day. The local wind regime is more obvious during 

the summer, when the regional wind regime is weaker. 

 

2.3 Hidrography 
The tide is the main forcing factor inside the lagoon. The tidal currents 

mobilize and distribute the sediments, producing the tidal flats and feeding the 

 14 



 Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

sediments to the marsh. The tidal flooding carves an internal channel network and 

carries marine salt into the lagoon. Tides are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an 

average amplitude at the inlet of 1.90 m, ranging between 1.22 m and 2.57 m, 

during neap and spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude 

decreases with the distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. 

The phase lag, variable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, 

with low and high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of 

the lagoon (Dias et al., 2000a). Water volume at low spring tides is 65 hm3 and the 

tidal prism at spring tides is about 80 hm3, with an estimated time of residence of 

the water of three days (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal prism has gradually increased 

since the beginning of the century due to the engineering work done on the inlet. 

According to Teixeira (1994, and work referred therein), from 1900 to 1930 the 

spring tide tidal prism should not have been larger than 25x106 m3, and the neap 

tide tidal prism half of this value. As the inlet and tidal channels stabilized with the 

engineering works post 1930, gradually the tidal prism increased by 1x106 m3 per 

year to the actual values and marine invasion spread into the lagoon (see Fig. II-

4). Also, the tidal prism is significantly larger than the fluvial input to the lagoon, 

with the fluvial input being only equal to the volume of the prism of neap tides for 

one tide every 5 years.

 15



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

 

 

 
 

Figure II-4: Tidal prism evolution of the Ria of Aveiro in the last 125 years (Teixeira, 1994). 

 

 

The tidal prism is distributed asymmetrically into the lagoon; the Mira 

channel to the south of the inlet receives 10% of tidal prism volume, whereas the 

three subsidiary channels of the main navigation channel, S.Jacinto, Espinheiro 

and Cidade, receive respectively 34, 34 and 12% of the prism and the remaining 

10% occupy the surface of the common channel (Teixeira, 1994). 

The offshore wave agitation is related to the North Atlantic wind regime, 

with predominant directions from the North during the summer, and with 

increasingly varying directions as the winter progresses. The modal and average 

wave origin direction is from WNW and maximum wave heights decrease as the 

wave origin direction rotates to the NW. The observed wave period ranges from 6s 

to 18 s, with a modal value around 9-11 s, for every wave direction. The average 

wave height is 2 m and approximately 35% of waves recorded during a year have 

greater heights. According to Teixeira (1994), three quarters of the sediment 

transport is carried by waves lower than 6 m, whereas storm conditions are only 

responsible for 20% of the sediment transport. Wave conditions at the shoreface 

of the Ria de Aveiro are relatively stable due to the fact that the relatively smooth 

water bottom and linear coastline preclude the occurrence of preferential locations 

for wave energy concentration (Abecasis et al., 1968).  

 16 



 Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

The Ria of Aveiro functions as a well mixed estuary close to the inlet, and 

progressively behaves as a more stratified estuary upstream. During high tide, the 

salinity is maximum, and falls during ebb until it reaches minimum value at low 

tide, with a resultant residual salt transport into the lagoon (Matos, 1990). Salinity 

values are typically high, around 3.5%, comparable to marine salinity, under the 

more common conditions of low fluvial runoff (Teixeira, 1994). As with the tidal 

prism, and for the same reasons (i.e. changes in the inlet), the salinity regime in 

the lagoon was significantly different in the beginning of the century, with high 

salinity limited to the proximity of the inlet and to the lower water layer up to 

S.Jacinto channel (Nobre, 1915 in Teixeira, 1994).  

The analysis of previous work on the tidal and salinity regimes of the lagoon 

allowed Teixeira (1994) to conclude that the work on the Aveiro inlet during the 

1950s significantly altered the hydraulic regime of the lagoon: “The tidal amplitude 

and the daily water outflow nearly doubled at the inlet. As a consequence, the 

relative importance of the fluvial debit contracted, allowing the appearance and 

expansion of the sedimentary environments of lagoon zones. The Ria de Aveiro, 

that, during the last centuries, had the common attributes of an estuarine 

environment, literally grow, and, from 1950 onwards, became a genuine coastal 

lagoon (translated from the original).” 

 

 

2.4 Geological framework 
 

The Ria of Aveiro is a Holocene sedimentary basin located in the 

northernmost part of the Lusitanian basin, a rift-basin formed during the Mesozoic 

opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. The basement underlying the Lusitanian 

basin is the Variscan orogen, mainly made up of igneous and sedimentary rocks 

metamorphosed during the Paleozoic (see geological map of the region in Fig. II-

5). The geodynamic evolution of the Ria of Aveiro region reflects the major 

extensional and compressional events caused by the relative movements of the 

Eurasia, Africa and Iberia from Triassic till the Present (for an overview of the 

geodynamic evolution of the Iberian Peninsula see Andeweg, 2002) . 

 17



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

 

 
Figure II-5: Geological map of the Aveiro region  (from the Geological Map of Portugal 1:500.000; 
Oliveira et al., 1992). 

 

The Western Iberian margin experienced two major stages of rifting 

separated by periods of quiescence, from the Triassic to the Cretaceous, which 

strongly controlled the stratigraphy and tectonic evolution of the Meso-Cenozoic 

sedimentary basins of the Portuguese continental margin (Boillot et al., 1979; 

Ribeiro et al., 1979; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Uchupi, 1988; Wilson et al., 

1989; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Andeweg, 2002; Alves et al., 

2003b). Folds and thrusts within the Hercynian basement trend NW-SE, at an 

angle to the NNE-SSW trend of the main Lusitanian rift faults. Various NNE-SSW 

left-lateral strike-slip faults, formed during the late Variscan fracturing event of 

Permian age faults, functioned as rift half-graben faults, defining syn-rift fluvial 

 18 



 Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

clastic depocenters. These faults were also later reactivated with strike-slip 

movement, during the Tertiary Alpine orogenesis (Uphoff et al., 2002). 

The first rifting stage occurred during Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. The 

important regional hiatus that follows the Early Jurassic rifting is probably related 

to the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean, for it coincides with the beginning of 

oceanic spreading at the Iberian Abyssal plain at 126 Ma  (Whitmarsh and Miles, 

1995).  

Two other extensional phases are described, one during the Late Jurassic 

and another during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Wilson et al., 1989; 

Rasmussen et al., 1998). These phases of deformation were more pronounced in 

outer basins of the Western Iberian Margin and the Lusitanian basin became part 

of an aborted rift with relatively limited subsidence since then. Regional uplift 

occurred during the Callovian to Early Oxfordian and, in the Lusitanian basin, this 

was followed by fault-block rotation and rapid subsidence along NNE-SSW 

trending faults during Late-Oxfordian-Earliest Kimeridgian. 

During the Early Cretaceous the Lusitanian basin sedimentation was 

characteristic of a post-rift regime (Dinis et al., 2008). Fault controlled subsidence 

and halokinesis determined the deposition of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic 

system. The sedimentation changed laterally from shallow carbonates in 

topographic highs to fluvial-deltaic siliciclastic deposits close to the water lines, 

which gradually passed to marine shale and limestones towards the deeper parts 

of the basin (Bernardes, 1992). 

In sharp contrast with the Mesozoic, the Cenozoic in the Western Iberia is 

characterized by periods of compressional deformation related to the Pyrenean 

and Alpine orogenies. The closure of the Bay of Biscay-Piyrenean zone migrated 

to the west and caused the inversion of the Mesozoic extensional basins (Garcia 

Mondejar, 1988). The short-lived southward subduction of the oceanic crust in the 

Biscay region during the latest Cretaceous to Early Eocene (Boillot and Mallod, 

1988) formed the Cantabrian Cordillera in the north of the Iberia. Sedimentation in 

the Lusitanian basin during the Pyrenean compression was controlled by pre-

existing late Variscan basement faults, often amplified by halokinesis, sometimes 

leading to the formation of diapirs that pierced the entire sedimentary cover (Alves 

 19



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

et al., 2003a). 

Sedimentation during the Paleogene consisted mostly of sands and 

conglomerates, while in the Neogene, sedimentation evolved to shallow marine 

clastic and carbonate deposits due to subsidence and marine transgression. The 

NNW-SSE compression was mostly accommodated by ENE-WSW thrusts and by 

pre-existing NNE-SSW and NW-SE faults. 

The main NNW convergence between Africa and Eurasia changed to NW in 

Tortonian, and triggered the build up of the Betic range. The end of the frontal 

convergence of Iberia and Eurasia around 30 Ma also marked the activation of the 

right lateral Azores-Gibraltar plate boundary (Srivastava et al., 1990).  

According to a review by Andeweg (2002), the whole of Iberia exhibits high 

level of internal deformation during the Plio-Pleistocene, evidenced by crustal 

scale folding (Cloetingh et al., 2002), large scale Pliocene uplift of several 

hundreds of meters in coastal areas (Janssen et al., 1993), present day seismicity 

(Buforn et al., 1988) and the development of new crustal shear zones in the 

Alboran basin (Andeweg, 2001) as well as south of Portugal in the Gulf of Cadiz 

(Rosas et al., 2008; Zitellini et al., 2009). All this evidence records the ongoing 

convergence between Africa and Iberia (Argus et al., 1989). In the North 

Lusitanian basin, Pliocene sedimentation recorded multiple transgression and 

regression cycles. Several erosional surfaces developed during the Quaternary, 

and deposition consisted mainly of coarse sand and gravel, often affected by mild 

neotectonic movements (Rocha, 1993; Granja et al., 1999; Dinis, 2004). 

Recently compiled evidence in Western Iberia of regional progressive 

rotation of the compression direction (S-Hmax), from NNW-SSE to WNW-ESE, 

since the upper Pliocene the led Ribeiro et al. (1996; 2002) to propose the 

hypothesis that a North Atlantic westwards subduction is initiating in the western 

Iberian margin, marking a major shift of plate dynamics in the region.  

 

Lithostratigraphy 

The lithostratigraphy of the Aveiro region comprehends, from bottom to top, 

Proterozoic-Paleozoic Variscan metasediments and plutonic rocks, followed by 

Mesozoic Atlantic-rift deposits, culminating in Pleisto-Holocene estuarine and 

 20 



 Setting of the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

lagoon sediments (see synopsis of the lithostratigrapy in Table II-1). Rocha (1993) 

points out the occurrence of Tertiary “relics” in the geological logs of boreholes 

drilled along the Aveiro littoral, between the villages of Gafanha and Muranzel. 

This section provides a short lithostratigraphic account of these rocks with 

emphasis on the Upper Cretaceous and Quaternary sedimentary units, which, as 

will be explained in future chapters, are of particular relevance for this work. 

The Variscan bedrock consists of mica schists and schists of Proterozoic 

age, with occasional Proterozoic gneisses, migmatites and Paleozoic granitoids in 

the northern part of the Aveiro region. It is exposed close to the Porto-Tomar fault, 

along a NNW-SSE trend, east of the Ria of Aveiro. The basement dips westward 

and is faulted by N-S and NNE-SSW faults, forming a system of horsts and 

grabens. 

The onshore and offshore stratigraphy of the Lusitanian basin has been 

investigated by multiple authors (e.g. Berthou, 1973; Teixeira and Zbyszewski, 

1976; Berthou and Lauverjat, 1979; Boillot et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1979; 

Barbosa, 1981; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Wilson et al., 1989; Bernardes, 

1992; Rocha, 1993; Alves et al., 2003a; Dinis et al., 2008). The Ria of Aveiro 

region corresponds to the northernmost part of the “Beira Litoral” sub-basin of the 

Lusitanian basin. It is characterized by two significant hiatus in the stratigraphic 

sequence during the Carixian-Aptian and Late Cretaceous-Pliocene. 

The Mesozoic lithostratigraphy ranges from the Upper Triassic, Rhaetian 

stage, red marly-clayey sandstones of the “Grés de Eirol” formation, to the clays, 

marly clays and carbonates of the Upper Cretaceous, Campanian-Maastrichtian 

stage, “Argilas de Aveiro” formation (see synopsis in Table II-1). 

The “Argilas de Aveiro” formation is of particular interest for this work 

because the Pleisto-Holocene sediments of the Ria of Aveiro frequently occur 

directly on top of it. The “Argilas de Aveiro” formation consists of the grayish marly 

clays, with occasional important sand content and with marly limestone layers 

deposited during a long regression in temperate climate. Towards the base, 

sediments become gradually coarser marly-sands, with bottom deposits mostly of 

sandstones. Clay mineralogy is very homogenous, dominated by illite followed by 

calcium smectite (Rocha and Gomes, 1989).

The unit is roughly uniform in the Aveiro region, with thicknesses over 150 m near 

the coast. Bernardes (1987) defined four facies associations of a coastal plain 

system for the Argilas de Aveiro formation. Association I corresponds to subtidal 

conditions of a barrier-lagoon complex, with central and marginal lagoon deposits 

as well as washover deposits. Association II deposited in intertidal conditions, 

consists of mud flat deposits with recurrent exposure and inundation periods. 

Association III includes sandy deposits of high sinuosity tidal channels, small tidal 

creeks with simple architecture and larger and more complex tidal inlets. 

Association IV deposited in supratidal conditions, with sedimentation governed by 

vegetation colonization. 

The Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene deposits are mainly recent alluvial 

and sand dunes of Holocene age, old beach deposits and fluvial terraces of 

 22

Pleistocene age (mainly clays and clayey sands in the upper part and coarse 

sands and pebbles at the bottom). Lagoon sedimentation occurs over a marine 

ravinement surface related to the Holocene marine transgression (see Dias et al., 

2000b for a synthesis on coastal evolution and marine transgression in Portugal). 

Investigation of the sediment record in the sand barrier has provided some insights 

on the onset and development of estuarine and lagoonal sedimentation in the Ria 

of Aveiro. Galera et al (1997) described three minor sedimentation cycles in the 

Mira channel related to the last 1000 years: 1) “Ancient Cycle” of estuarine 

sedimentation of muddy facies, prior to the 16th century; 2) “Recent cycle” of 

subtidal channel deposits of sands and intertidal mudstones and tidal sand bars; 

3) “Present cycle” sedimentation of subtidal channel sands and mudstones related 

to the opening of the artificial inlet. A more recent study of the sand spit evolution 

between Torreira and Furadouro, the northern branch of the sand-barrier 

(Bernardes and Rocha, 2007), also describes three sedimentary units which may 

in part correlate with the sedimentation cycles described by Galera (1997): a lower 

unit of estuarine lagoonal deposits developed in retrograding conditions of 

stationary sea level which indicates the lagoon was formed prior to 1997-1992 

years BP; a middle unit related to landwards prograding sand ridges, possibly 

associated with minor sea level rise; and an upper dune unit related to a period of 

shoreline stability. 

 

 

2.5 Gas in the Lagoon 
 

Early descriptions of possibly methane gas related phenomena in the 

lagoon area date back to the 1755 great Lisbon earthquake. The answers from 

local parishes to the Marquês de Pombal enquiries on the 1755 earthquake report 

that the Vouga river waters “boiled as if they were on fire” and that the waters from 

the Mira lagoon (at the south end of the Ria) “appeared to boil so hard that they 

would break at the lagoon shore as if they were sea waves” (Coelho, 2005; 

Oliveira, 2005); these tales may be explained by gas releases from seismically 

destabilized sediments. The first unequivocal direct observations of escape of 

 23

biogenic methane from several drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area 

surrounding the Ria of Aveiro were reported by the Portuguese Geological Survey 

in 1967 (Faria et al., 1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed in 

other land wells for water exploration. During previous work, Duarte et al. (2003) 

identified several high-backscatter patches on sidescan sonar images acquired in 

the Ria de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which they 

interpreted as related to gas escape. Recently, in September of 2006, gas 

samples were collected from extensive bubble trains observed during falling tide in 

a docking pier (“Doca Pesca”) in the Ria of Aveiro (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2006, 

unpublished data). The analysis of the samples revealed that the gas composition 

was mostly methane (Luis Pinheiro and João Coutinho, personal communication).

Abstract 

This paper addresses the methodological problems and limitations 

associated with the acquisition and processing of high-resolution seismic reflection 

data (Boomer and Chirp systems) in very shallow water systems such as estuaries 

and lagoons. Examples from the Ria of Aveiro, a shallow barrier lagoon located in 

NW Portugal, are shown. The main limitations are: ship traffic, tides and channel 

morphology and bathymetry, which often affect the deployment and operation of 

the seismic systems, and the extent of the profile coverage. The processing of the 

navigation data included data errors detection, system clock synchronization 

corrections, layback adjustment and trace midpoint position estimation. The 

seismic signal processing consisted in amplitude corrections, burst noise removal, 

static corrections, normal move-out corrections, frequency band pass filtering, 

signature deconvolution and migration. The analysis of the track line regularity, the 

horizon misties and the first-break surface models were applied as quality control 

procedures, and allowed the revision and improvement of the processing 

parameters. The heterogeneity of the seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration 

and resolution all constrain the use of the data to mostly local but detailed 

interpretations of the geological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. A new procedure is 

proposed to determine adequate scales for the geological interpretation based on 

the seismic resolution, known positioning errors and mean mistie values.

3.1. Introduction 
 

3.1.1. Objectives 

The present work addresses the methodological problems faced in the 

study of the bedrock structure and sediment architecture in shallow water 

estuarine and lagoon systems using very high-resolution 2-D seismic reflection 

systems (Boomer and Chirp). A case study of the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon 

(Portugal) is presented. The study of the bedrock structure and sediment 

architecture with seismic reflection methods requires adequate and reliable 

seismic imaging of the geological features. For this purpose, a precise control of 

the seismic data acquisition conditions and of the accuracy in the positioning is 

essential. Data processing is frequently necessary to improve positioning quality, 

as well as to enhance the interpretability of the seismic signal.  

The persecution of such broad methodological goals in this study met with 

an uncommon conjunction of obstacles for the case of the Ria of Aveiro. The 

seismic reflection data acquired in the Ria of Aveiro is of multiple vintages, with 

various acquisition systems, navigation systems and operational procedures and 

conditions. Various characteristics of the Ria of Aveiro further constrained the 

seismic acquisition, affecting signal quality, the systems deployment geometry and 

the characteristics of the seismic coverage. Variable and frequently high current 

speeds caused by tides and winds affected signal quality due to turbulence 

caused by drag effects on the towed equipment; the system geometry was 

affected by frequent changes of ship direction due to the abundant navigation 

hazards (e.g. fishing nets, ship traffic, etc) that are common in the lagoon; also, 

the 2 meter tidal range and several hours tidal lag inside the lagoon caused a 

constant and difficult to control change in the vertical datum of the seismic data. 

The very shallow waters in most of the lagoon meant that seismic acquisition was 

limited to the deeper, navigable, tidal channels, and that the seismic coverage was 

very irregular within the lagoon.  

In order to address these problems the following specific objectives of this 

paper are: 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

1. To describe the data acquisition systems and to document the operational 

procedures used. 

2. To propose specially tailored data processing flows of the seismic signal 

and navigation data and to discuss the results of the application of these 

flows to the available data.  

3. To assess the constraints imposed by the processed seismic dataset on the 

interpretation and mapping of geological features. 

 

3.1.2. State of the art 

High resolution seismic reflection surveying of the Ria of Aveiro started in 

1986 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Moreira, 1988; Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998) 

and a total of five surveys with Chirp and Boomer systems were carried out until 

late 2003. Three of these surveys were done in the scope of this project and data 

from earlier surveys were revisited and also discussed here. Most of the 

publications from other high resolution seismic reflection surveys conducted in 

somewhat similar systems, conditions and environments such as the Venice 

lagoon (McClennen et al., 1997; Zechhin et al., 2008)  and the Rias Bajas of 

Galicia (Ferrin et al., 2003; Garcia-Gil, 2003), do not address in detail the data 

acquisition and processing challenges of acquiring high resolution data in very 

shallow coastal environments. 

A seismic survey of a sub-tidal to intra-tidal area in the Bay of Fundy, 

Canada, bypassed a significant part of the navigation and geometry control 

problems addressed in this work through technical innovations of the seismic 

acquisition systems (Dashtgard et al., 2007). The authors of that study used a 

boomer system that had its signal source mounted together with the receiver array 

in a single catamaran, which simplified the deployment geometry, and also 

resorted to RTK-GPS to infer tidal heights with centimeter precision.  

Research in very high-resolution 3-D seismic reflection systems is the 

current field of study where the issue of the relationships between shallow water 

seismic acquisition and processing and the characteristics of the study object has 

had more attention. Marsset et al. (1998) have emphasized the importance of tidal 

 27



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

correction in shallow coastal environments in order to improve the correlation 

between profiles. Missiaen  (2005) provides insights on how the work in shallow 

water environments and at high frequencies implies constraints on sampling, array 

directivity and positioning accuracy, constraints that are in good part also found in 

the work in the Ria of Aveiro. An example of how to tackle the challenges in 

positioning of 3-D seismics that deals with issues such as data quality control and 

navigation and seismic systems integration, which are also present in this work, 

can be found in the technical report of a 3-D seismic survey in the Gulf of Cadiz 

(Duarte, 2006).  

General signal processing workflows for single and multi channel seismics 

can be found in multiple books (e.g. Yilmaz, 1987; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

Proposed processing flows for chirp systems generally consist of match filtering, 

Hilbert transform and instantaneous amplitude computation (for reviews on chirp 

processing see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). Published boomer signal 

processing flows typically include static corrections to compensate for swell and/or 

tides, spherical divergence correction, frequency bandpass filtering, spike 

deconvolution and, occasionally, a constant velocity time migration (Dashtgard et 

al., 2007). 

3.1.3. Seismic surveying and the hydrography of the Ria 

of Aveiro 

The seismic reflection acquisition in the Ria of Aveiro was significantly 

controlled by morphological characteristics of the navigable waterways, as well as 

by its tidal and current patterns. The Ria of Aveiro is composed by an intricate 

network of tidal channels that crisscross extensive mud flats and salt marshes 

(see Fig. III-1). The tidal channels correspond to the deeper lagoon segments 

through which the tidal prism is distributed to the interior of the lagoon.  A local 

nomenclature describes the hierarchy of the hydrographic network: first order 

channels, also called “Cales”, are always immersed and, generally, become 

deeper closer to the only inlet of the lagoon barrier; the second order channels, 

called “Esteiros”, promote the connection between different “Cales”, isolate inner 

isles and almost dry up during more extreme low tides (e.g. neap tides); third order 

 28 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

channels, or “Regueiros”, make up the inicipient network over the tidal flats and 

salt marshes, undergo considerable emersion and are usually only totally flooded 

during the second half of the flooding (Teixeira, 1994).  

The tidal flats correspond to flattened deposits neighboring the tidal 

channels that occur at depths between spring low tide altitude and the average 

tidal altitude. The upper limit corresponds to the surface marking predominant 

emersion and coincides with the minimal altitude for the halofite colonizations, 

typically Spartina (Teixeira, 1994). The salt marshes are upper intertidal 

environments of mostly muddy sediments covered by a variety of halofite 

vegetation (salt tolerant).  

As the surface area of the Ria of Aveiro consists predominantly of tidal flats 

and salt marshes (over three quarters of the lagoon area), seismic coverage of the 

lagoon was spatially constrained, for it was limited to the deeper tidal channels. 

The first order, navigable tidal channels, where most of the Aveiro harbor facilities 

are located, suffer from heavy cargo ship traffic. This heavy traffic coupled with the 

abundant fishing nets deployed haphazardly, sometimes with poor signalization, 

constituted serious navigation hazards during acquisition and were the cause of 

multiple trackline irregularities. Also, hydrographic surveys were not available 

outside the main harbor area and navigation channels, and all the surveying into 

those areas required careful monitoring of the water depth. Still, even with great 

care, the towed equipment was accidently grounded a couple of times. Success in 

navigating the uncharted waters was due to the vast experience and personal 

knowledge of the lagoon of the harbor pilots that commanded the survey vessels. 

Tides in the Ria of Aveiro are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an average 

amplitude at the inlet of 1.90 m, ranging between 1.22 m and 2.57 m, during neap 

and spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude decreases with 

the distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. The phase lag, 

variable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, with low and 

high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of the lagoon 

(Dias et al., 2000). Available tide prediction data had to be used to control this 

complex tidal behavior, because no altitude data was recorded during acquisition 

(see tide prediction locations in Fig. III-1).

prediction stations, followed by the estimated delay of the low tide during spring tides, according to

The strong influence of tides in the lagoon was particularly felt during ebb 

when current speeds could reach up to 5 knots closer to the inlet. Such strong 

currents caused significant difficulties in handling the ship at the low survey 

speeds (normally 4-5 knots). Navigation against the tide caused increased drag on 

the towed equipment, and the turbulence produced noise was recorded by the 

seismic systems. On the other hand, navigation with the tide direction sometimes 

caused the equipment to lose its planned deployment geometry because current 

speeds closely matched surveying speeds. 

Currents in the Ria of Aveiro are also sometimes significantly influenced by 

winds. The Ria of Aveiro has a regime of steady northerly winds during the 

summer that changes to more volatile conditions during the winter, with frequent 

changes in wind direction. Typically, daytime is marked by a westerly to 

northwesterly wind, which becomes increasingly stronger towards the afternoon 

(Teixeira, 1994). The stronger afternoon wind promoted stronger currents and 

turbulence in the upper water layer, which introduced noise to the seismic records. 

The worst surveying conditions occur when a strong afternoon wind coincides with 

an ebbing tide close to the lagoon inlet. 

 

 

3.2. Methods and data 
 

The seismic data used in this work was acquired between 1986 and 2003 

(Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; Pinheiro and Duarte, 

2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). Naturally, the seismic 

and navigation systems deployed and modes of operation were specific to each 

survey and evolved through time. This chapter presents the data acquisition 

systems and the geometry parameters that describe their deployment which are 

relevant for data processing. This is followed by the technical summary specific to 

each survey, including objectives, equipment and operational details. Finally, the 

data quality control protocol is described, and the navigation and seismic signal 

processing flows explained.

3.2.1. Data acquisition systems 
The seismic data acquisition systems in this work were an EG&amp;amp;G Uniboom 

system with a boomer source and a Datasonics Chirp Sonar system with a 

modulated chirp source. In broad terms, these systems comprise an energy 

source that powers a signal source, a hydrophone receiver array and  a recording 

unit (for an overview on high resolution seismic reflection systems see Mosher and 

Simpkin, 1999).  

 
The EG&amp;amp;G Uniboom system (Boomer) 

The EG&amp;amp;G 230-1 UNIBOOM (Unit Pulse Boomer) is a high resolution 

seismic reflection system with a boomer source which has a signal frequency 

bandwidth ranging from 400 to 14000 Hz. This boomer unit has three modes of 

operation: 700-14000 Hz and a maximum of 6 pings per second (pps) for 100 

watt-second energy level; 500-10000 Hz and 5 pps for 200 watt-second and 400-

8000 Hz and 3.3 pps for 300 watt-second. The signal source is mounted on a 

catamaran that can be towed at 2 to 8 knots with a 30.5m long cable. This signal 

source is powered by a EG&amp;amp;G Model 232-A power supply with an EG&amp;amp;G Model 

231 triggered capacitor bank. 

Twenty four Aquadyne AQ-1 hydrophones with an Aquadyne AQ-200 

amplifier are arrayed in a streamer with 2 sections, and a total 15 m active length. 

This streamer can be towed at speeds of up to 15 knots and records a frequency 

bandwidth of 0.5 Hz to 3 KHz. 

A Technical Survey Services, Ltd. (TSS) analog filtering unit was used to 

process the analog signal. This unit included a TVG amplifier, model 307B; a Tape 

Replay Unit, model 306 and a Stacking Unit, model 303.  

During the earliest survey (VOUGA-86, described below) an EPC 4603 

printer was available to control the signal trigger and plot the analog signal. The 

later Boomer survey (RIAV03) was carried out with an Analog-to-Digital signal 

Converter (ADC) installed on a workstation powered by an INTEL P4 processor 

unit. The software BoomDiRec (INGMARDEP 19/FCT/2003) was used in this 

workstation to control the triggering mechanism and record the digital signal in a 

SEG-Y format file. A simplified schematics of the deployment of the boomer

system is presented in figure III-2. The nominal signal penetration depth of this 

Boomer unit is of up to 75 m with a resolution of 75 cm to 1 m, depending on the 

type of sub-bottom materials and on the energy level used. 

 

The Datasonics Chirp system 
The Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar has a signal bandwidth of 1.5 to 

10 KHz, with 1 KW power. The chirp length can be of 5, 10, 20, 50 or 60 ms, with 

possible ping rates of 0.25 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s, 2.0 s, 4.0 s, 8.0 s. The nominal 

resolution of the system is between 8 and 15 cm and the depth measurement 

precision is approximately 0.1% of the depth, with a known sound velocity. The 

sub-bottom penetration may reach, in ideal conditions, 30 to 40 m, depending on 

the sediment type. 

The sonar fish has a towing speed of 1 to 10 knots, has four AT-472 

transducers and a hydrophone array of 8 elements with +12 dB of pre-

amplification. This fish can be operated down to 300m depth. 

Processing of the uncorrelated chirp data is automated and done prior to 

recording, inside the fish. The processing flow includes a match filter and the 

determination of the amplitude envelope (for a detailed discussion on chirp signal 

processing see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). 

 

 

The GPS 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio navigation 

system managed and operated by the United States (U.S.) Government. It 

comprises three segments, known as the Space Segment, the Control segment 

and the User Segment. The Space Segment and the Control Segment are 

maintained and operated by the U.S. Government (detailed description can be 

found in Stenbit, 2001). In general terms, the Space Segment consists of 24 

satellites that emit their spatial position and time information to the surface of the 

earth, and the Control Segment consists of a main control station and 5 monitoring 

stations that command and keep track of the satellites, as well as process and 

correct the information that these satellites emit.

The User Segment is specific to each of the data acquisition surveys. It 

pertains to the user receivers, GPS antennas and software that allow the 

reception, decoding and processing of GPS signals emitted by the satellites. It is 

the User Segment that calculates the position, velocity and timestamp of the 

antenna. The GPS data acquisition methods for the user segment can divided into 

three types according to the way the GPS signal carrier waves (called L1 and L2) 

are handled: 

 

1) The “Absolute Mode” or “Single Point” is the simplest method of operation 

that involves a single frequency receiver of the GPS signal information 

modulated by L1. The received data is processed to obtain the navigation 

information of the receiver Antenna. This method of operation has an 

approximate error in the range of 1 to 10 m in static mode, for continental 

Portugal; 

2) The “Differential GPS” method (also known as DGPS) and the “Real-Time 

Kinematic GPS” (RTK) method both imply the use of two receivers, one 

placed on a location with known coordinates and another one mobile. The 

static station receives the L1 and L2 carrier waves and determines the 

differences between the known and received coordinate information. When 

these differences are applied in real time (more precisely near real time) to 

the pseudo distances to the mobile receiver, the method is called DGPS. 

When the differences are applied in real time to the wave phase, the 

method is called RTK. The DGPS has an accuracy of approximately 1 m 

and the RTK has an accuracy in the order of 1 to 2 cm. 

 

An important aspect of the GPS is that, until the 1st of May, 2000, the United 

States Government imposed intentional civilian GPS signal degradation called 

“Selective Availability” that reduced the accuracy of data acquired in “Single Point” 

mode to values in the order of 30m. 

The GPS navigation data for the seismic profiles presented in this work was 

acquired with either handheld single frequency receivers, working in “Single Point” 

mode, or with dual frequency receivers from the Aveiro Harbor Authority (APA) 

 36

operating in RTK-GPS mode and a single frequency receiver, operating in “Single 

Point” mode for backup.  

The synchronization of the GPS clocks with the clock of the seismic 

acquisition systems was done manually, due to the lack of an integrated hardware 

solution, and the maximum bias, estimated by periodic comparison of the clock 

displays, was approximately 1 s. 

 

3.2.2. Acquisition geometry parameters of the deployed 

systems 
The spatial configuration of the various components of the seismic 

reflection and navigation systems (i.e. signal source, receiver array, GPS antenna) 

constitute part of the basic framework that must be adequately described in order 

to determine and parameterize both the navigation and the seismic data 

processing flows. The system geometry is fundamental in this work to estimate the 

seismic trace horizontal positions; to establish a common vertical datum for all the 

seismic traces; and to obtain a constant vertical sample interval, normal to the 

horizontal datum (see Fig. III-4 and Fig. III-5 for a representation of the relevant 

geometry parameters respectively of the boomer system and the chirp system). 

 

Horizontal geometry parameters 
The horizontal geometry parameters, described hereafter, refer to the 

parameters used in this work to estimate the horizontal coordinates of the seismic 

traces (see figures III-4 and III-5).  

 

Layback – distance measured along the GPS antenna track-lines, between the 
GPS antenna position and the across-track line (i.e. line perpendicular to the track-

line) that contains a certain reference point (e.g. the center of the receiver array, 

the center of the signal source, etc). Under normal conditions the layback 

corresponds to a distance towards the stern, for seismic equipments are normally 

towed behind the vessel. For this reason, in this work, layback distances are 

always measured as positive values. The types of layback are receiver layback, 

 37



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

source layback and mid-point layback, and are explained below (see figures III-4 

and III-5). 

 

Offset (definition only used for the horizontal geometry parameters) – distance 
measured along the lines that are perpendicular to the GPS antenna track-line, 

and that contain a certain reference point (e.g. the center of the receiver array, the 

center of the signal source, etc). As a convention for this work, offset distances 

measured towards starboard are positive, whereas distances measured towards 

port are negative. The types of offset are receiver offset, source offset, source-

receiver offset and mid-point offset, and are explained below (see figures III-4 and 

III-5). 

 

Receiver offset (RecO) – The offset between the GPS antenna track-line and the 
center of the receiver array. The RecO is relevant to the acquisition with a 
separate source and receiver such as the boomer system (see figure III-4). 

 

Receiver layback (RecL) – The layback between the GPS antenna position and 
the across-track line containing the center of the receiver array. The RecL is 
relevant to the acquisition with a separate source and receiver such as the boomer 

system (see figure III-4). 

 

Source offset (SrcO) – The offset between the GPS antenna track-line and the 
center of the signal-source. The SrcO is relevant to the acquisition with a separate 
source and receiver such as the boomer system (see figure III-4). 

 

Source layback (SrcL) – The layback between the GPS antenna position and the 
across-track line containing the center of the signal-source. The SrcL is relevant to 
the acquisition with a separate source and receiver such as the boomer system 

(see figure III-4). 

 

Mid-point offset (MptO) – The offset between the GPS antenna track-line and the 
mid-point (trace position). The mid-point offset depends on both the source and 

 38 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

receiver offsets according to the Equation III-1. The MptO is relevant to the 
acquisition with both boomer and chirp systems (see figures III-4 and III-5).

Mid-point layback (MptL) – The layback between the GPS antenna and the

the source and receiver laybacks according to the Equation III-2. The MptL is 
relevant to the acquisition with both boomer and chirp systems (see figures III-4 

and III-5).

Vertical geometry parameters 
The vertical geometry parameters described hereafter refer to the 

parameters used to establish a common vertical datum for the seismic traces, and 

to obtain a constant vertical seismic sample interval, normal to the horizontal 

datum. 

 

Source-receiver offset (SrcRec) – The distance between the center of the signal 
source and the center of the receiver array, according to the Equation III-3. In this 

work, the SrcRec is derived from horizontal geometry parameters, despite being 
considered a vertical geometry parameter. The SrcRec is relevant to the

Tidal altitude – Water height relative to the local mean sea level datum at the time 
of the data acquisition. For the Ria of Aveiro the so called “Zero Hidrográfico” (ZH) 

is used as the vertical datum relative to which tidal altitudes are measured. 

According to Barahona Fernandes (1971), the ZH is slightly bellow the maximum 

low tide, and is the reference surface for the depths of the Maritime Charts and for 

the predicted tidal altitudes published in the Tide Tables of the Instituto 

Hidrográfico. The tidal altitude is relevant to the acquisition with both boomer and 

chirp systems (see figures III-4 and III-5). 

 

 

3.2.3. Seismic reflection surveys 
 

The seismic reflection data used in this work was acquired during 5 

scientific cruises in the Ria de Aveiro: the VOUGA86 Boomer survey (Monteiro 

and Pinheiro, 1986), the RIAV99 Chirp survey (Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999), the 

RIAV02 Chirp survey (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a), the RIAV02A Chirp survey 

(Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b) and the RIAV03 Boomer survey (Pinheiro et al., 

2003).

The seismic profiles are 313 km long (112 km of Boomer profiles and 201 

km of Chirp profiles) and cover the navigable channels of the lagoon (see 

simplified representation of the available seismic coverage of the Ria de Aveiro in 

figure III-6)

The Vouga 86 boomer survey 

The Vouga 86 survey (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986) was carried out the Ria 

de Aveiro between the 19th and the 21st of September of 1986, and was 

undertaken by the Instituto Geológico e Mineiro (IGM) in cooperation with the 

University of Aveiro (UA). 

The objective of this survey was to explore the subsurface geology of the 

Ria of Aveiro and to characterize the lagoon sediment architecture and bedrock 

structure, as well as test the recently acquired Uniboom seismic reflection system. 

 43



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

The Uniboom was deployed on the tugboat “Porto de Portimão” (courtesy of 

Somague Ltd.) and 65 km of seismic profiles were acquired along the main 

channels of the Lagoon. In this work, the navigation fixes were obtained with a 

sextant every 10 minutes and were marked on a navigation chart and on the 

profile paper plots. The sextant navigation fixes have an estimated accuracy of 

150 meters (J. H. Monteiro, personal communication). The navigation chart was 

digitized, geo-referenced and the resulting coordinates of the navigation fixes and 

estimated trace positions (figure III-6) were extracted to ASCII files. 

The inferred systems deployment geometry parameters for the Vouga 86 

survey are 15 meters for the mid-point layback and 10 meters for the source-

receiver offset. Both the boomer catamaran and the streamer were towed near the 

surface, at most 10-20 cm below the water surface. The remaining geometry 

parameters were considered irrelevant, because their variations were an order of 

dimension smaller than the 150 meter accuracy of the navigation method. 

The Vouga 86 profiles used in this work were acquired with a firing rate of 

two shots per second and an energy source level of 100 Joules. The vertical 

resolution varied with the EPC printer plotting parameters but these values were 

not documented (J.H. Monteiro, personal communication). 

 

The RIAV99 Chirp survey 
The RIAV99 survey (Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999) occurred on the 27th and 

28th May of 1999, onboard the “Pangim” launch of the Aveiro Harbor Authorities 

(Administração do Porto de Aveiro – APA), equipped with the Chirp sonar; Drs. 

Hipólito Monteiro (IGM) and Luis Pinheiro (UA) were the co-chief scientists. 

Twelve profiles, 23.9 km long in total, were acquired during this survey 

(Figure III-6), three of which have no navigation data. The chirp impulse used was 

10 ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 2 shots per second. 

The navigation tracks were obtained with a GPS from the University of 

Aveiro and the position fixes were affected by signal quality deterioration due to 

the Selective Availability (SA) still imposed by the government of the United States 

of America at the time of the RIAV99 survey. Values for the geometry parameters 

 44 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

were not estimated because the GPS error of 30 m was significantly greater than 

the combined effect of the geometry parameters (less than 5 m).  

 

The RIAV02 Chirp survey  
The RIAV02 survey (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a) was integrated in a 

science promotion action called “Acção Ciência Viva da Geologia no Verão” 

(which translates approximately as “Live Science Activity of Summer Geology”), 

coordinated by the Geosciences Department of the Unviersity of Aveiro (DG-UA), 

in collaboration with the Marine Geology Department of the Instituto Geológico e 

Mineiro (DGM-IGM) and by the Aveiro Harbor Authority (APA).  The scientific aims 

of this survey were twofold: 

 

1) To image the sediment architecture and bedrock structure of the Ria of 

Aveiro sedimentary basin;  

 

2) To do a detailed survey near the Northern Terminal (“Terminal Norte”) of 

the Aveiro harbor, for the Underwater Archeology Group of Aveiro, to 

search for evidence of shipwrecks. 

 

The campaign was carried out between the 17th and the 19th of September 

of 2002, on board the “Ria Azul” launch of the Aveiro Harbor Authority, under the 

supervision of Prof. Luis Menezes Pinheiro (DG-UA). Ninety kilometers of Chirp 

profiles were acquired along the channels Espinheiro, São Jacinto, Vila, Mira, 

Aveiro and Boco (see seismic coverage in figure III-6). The chirp impulse used 

was 10ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 2 shots per second. 

Navigation data was acquired with a RTK GPS system of the Aveiro Harbor 

Authorities, with the antenna placed aft, on the port side, less than half a meter 

away from the Chirp fish, using a single frequency GPS receiver from the 

University of Aveiro (for redundancy), placed inside the pilot’s cabin, 2-3 meters 

away from the Chirp fish. 

The seismic profiles were digitally recorded in a Datasonics native format, 

later converted to SEG-Y. The GPS geographic coordinates referred to the datum 

 45



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

WGS84 were recorded in ASCII files, together with their respective UTC 

(Coordinated Universal Time) timestamps. 

For more technical information on the RIAV02 survey please consult the 

survey report by Pinheiro and Duarte (2003a).  

 

The RIAV02A Chirp survey 
Similar to the survey RIAV02, the survey RIAV02A (Pinheiro and Duarte, 

2003b) was coordinated by the DG-UA, in collaboration with the DGM-IGM and 

the APA. The purpose of this survey was to improve the Chirp profile coverage of 

the Ria of Aveiro that was started with surveys RIAV99 and RIAV02, and continue 

the geophysical study of the sub-surface geology of the Ria of Aveiro. Also, a 

detailed survey was carried out for APA on the Aveiro Channel, near the “Terminal 

Sul” (the Southern terminal of the Aveiro Harbor, see Fig. III-6), to determine the 

unconsolidated sediment thickness in order to investigate the causes of recent, 

unexplained problems of harbor maintenance dredging operations. 

The RIAV02A cruise was carried out onboard the “Ria Azul” launch of the 

APA, between the 21st and the 23rd of October, 2002. The Chirp profiles were 

acquired in the channels Espinheiro, São Jacinto, Mira, Aveiro, Ovar and Boco, 

totaling 87 km in length (see schematic coverage in figure III-6). The chirp impulse 

used was 10 ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 4 shots per 

second. 

Navigation data was acquired in same conditions of the RIAV02 survey, 

with a RTK GPS system of the Aveiro Harbor Authorities, with the antenna placed 

aft, on the port side, less than half a meter away from the Chirp fish, and, with a 

single frequency GPS receiver of the University of Aveiro (for redundancy), placed 

inside the pilot’s cabin, 2-3 meters away from the Chirp fish. 

The seismic profiles were digitally recorded in a Datasonics native SEG 

format, later converted to SEG-Y. The GPS geographic coordinates referred to the 

datum WGS84 were recorded in ASCII files together with their respective with 

UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timestamps. 

For more technical information on the RIAV02A survey please consult the 

survey report by Pinheiro and Duarte (2003b).

Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

The RIAV03 Boomer survey 
The RIAV03 boomer survey (Pinheiro et al., 2003) integrated the science 

promotion activity called “Acção Ciência Viva da Geologia no Verão”, as did 

survey RIAV02, but this time integrated in a 2003 activity, and was coordinated by 

the DG-UA, in collaboration with the DGM-IGM and APA,. 

The scientific purpose of this campaign was to continue the exploratory 

geophysical surveying of the sub-surface geology of the Ria of Aveiro, with 

improved navigation and digital recording methods (when compared with previous 

boomer data of the Vouga 86 survey). 

This survey lasted for 4 days, from the 2nd to the 5th of September, 2003, 

and was carried out onboard the “Ria Azul” launch of the APA. A total of 47,1 km 

of boomer profiles were acquired along the channels Vila, S. Jacinto, Espinheiro, 

Sama and Bulhões (see seismic coverage in figure III-6). The source energy level 

used was 100 watt-second, with a ping rate of 2 shots per second. 

The navigation fixes were obtained with the Aveiro Harbor Authorities RTK-

GPS and with the DG-UA single frequency GPS receiver (again, for the sake of 

redundancy), both placed close to the pilot’s cabin. The following geometry 

parameters of the acquisition systems and the DGPS were estimated onboard 

during the operations: 

 

• Receiver offset (RecO) = 3 m  

• Receiver layback (RecL) = 20 m 

• Source offset (SrcO) = 7 m 

• Source layback (SrcL) = 14 m 

• Mid-point offset (MptO) = +2 m      (see Equation III-1)  

• Mid-point layback (MptL) = 17 m      (see Equation III-2)  

• Source-receiver offset (SrcRec) = 10.5 m  (see Equation III-3) 

 47

The seismic profiles were digitally recorded in SEGY format (little endian 

byte order) and the geographic coordinates of the navigation fixes, referred to the 

Datum WGS84, were stored in ASCII files together with their respective 

timestamps. 

For more technical information on the RIAV03 survey please consult the 

survey report by Pinheiro et al. (2003). 

 

 

3.2.4. Data processing flow 

 

The data processing flow tested with the seismic data acquired in the Ria of 

Aveiro can be divided into three stages, as depicted in figure III-7. The first stage 

consisted of navigation data processing to obtain trace position estimates. The 

second stage consisted of processing procedures applied to the seismic files to 

obtain a common vertical datum and to improve the signal quality. Finally, the third 

step consisted of quality control procedures to evaluate the consistency of the 

processed data. The errors diagnosed through the quality control procedures 

provided better constrained parameters for the processing flow, in a feedback 

loop. The necessary processing steps were repeated until either the quality control 

results were acceptable or no further improvements were obtained. The recorded 

Chirp profiles did not preserve phase information and, for that reason, the 

processing flow for the Chirp profiles was limited to gain corrections and static 

corrections. 

The navigation processing procedures were applied using C++ or Visual 

Basic code specifically developed to accommodate the data file formats. The 

seismic signal processing procedures were applied using the seismic processing 

software tools SPW (developed by Parallel Geosciences Corporation) and ProMax 

and PostStack Data Loader (developed by Landmark Graphics Corporation). 

The processing flow diagram used in this work is illustrated in Fig. III-7. The 

description of each processing step is illustrated with real data examples in the 

next chapter, together with the processing results.

3.3. Data processing results 
 

This section presents the results of the processing flow as applied to the 

Boomer and Chirp datasets. First, each processing step is briefly described and 

illustrated with data examples. Then, the most common problems detected 

through the quality control procedures and the strategies to address them are 

described. Finally, representative examples are presented of the seismic coverage 

after navigation processing, and of the processed boomer and chirp profiles used 

for seismic interpretation. 

 

3.3.1. Estimation of seismic trace positions 
The aim of the navigation data processing was to integrate the GPS 

navigation data with the seismic trace headers in order to estimate trace positions. 

The processing flow applied to the navigation data involved the removal of corrupt 

navigation data entries and outlier position fixes, as well as correcting the clock 

bias between the seismic system and the GPS. After these data corrections, the 

midpoint layback was factored into the GPS timestamps and, finally, the trace 

positions were estimated based on the relationship between the navigation 

timestamps and the trace timestamps. A more detailed description of the 

navigation processing procedures is presented and illustrated below (process 

numbering indicates the order of execution and follows the flowchart in Figure III-

7). 

 

N1. Repeated GPS sentences filter 

GPS navigation data frequently includes sentences with either repeated 

position fixes or repeated timestamps that were removed, always preserving the 

first sentence. 

 

N2. Outlier position fixes filter 

The GPS navigation track frequently has outlier fixes that are identified as 

artifacts because their time and spatial distances relative to their neighbors are 

 50 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

excessive, given the vessels speed. A specific code was developed in this work to 

filter outlier position fixes; position fixes were filtered out if the distance to their 

neighbors exceeded a user input threshold value. The maximum valid distance 

parameter was chosen according to the relationship between the GPS sentence 

output frequency and the ship average speed, e.g. for an output frequency of 1 Hz 

and a speed of 4 knots a ballpark value of 4 m was used for the outlier filter (at 4 

knots a vessel covers approximately 2 m in 1 second). 

 

N3. Synchronism error correction 

All detected systematic biases between the acquisition system clock and 

the GPS clock were corrected on the timestamps of the navigation files. 

 

N4. Midpoint layback adjustment 

The midpoint layback correction was applied to the position fixes through an 

adjustment to the positioning timestamps: the time for the vessel to cover the 

layback distance was added to the position timestamp. This procedure assumes 

that the midpoint follows closely the track line of the GPS antenna, which usually 

only approaches reality when the vessel’s travel direction is constant and the 

towed equipment is not affected by cross currents. Figure III-8 shows a 

comparison of a fault mapped pre- and post-layback adjustment. 

 

N5. Trace position interpolation 

The trace numbers and respective timestamps were extracted from the 

SEG-Y headers. Repeated or corrupted timestamp values were removed and new 

timestamps interpolated using valid neighboring timestamps. Trace X,Y 

coordinates were interpolated based on the X,Y timestamp processed navigation 

data (geographic coordinates were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator 

Zone 29N coordinates in the World Geodetic System datum for 1984 – WGS84). 

For each trace number, the Interpolation algorithm used the coordinates of the two 

closest time neighbors found in the navigation data, and computed a linear 

position interpolation weighted by the relative time difference of the trace to each 

coordinate pair. The algorithm used is expressed in Equation III-4. 

 51

TR(x,y) = N1(x,y) + (TRt – N2t) / (N2t-N1t) x (N2(x,y) – N1(x,y))  (Equation III-4) 

 

 

Were TRt and TR(x,y) are respectively the timestamp and the x,y 

coordinates of the trace and N1t, N1(x,y) and N2t, N2(x,y) are, respectively, the 

timestamp and coordinates of the two time neighbors of the trace. The figure III-9 

shows the relationship between the processed navigation fixes and the trace 

position estimates obtained with the algorithm developed in this work.

3.3.2. Processed seismic signal 
 

The aim of processing the seismic signal was twofold: (1) to improve the 

geometrical consistency of the seismic data, and, (2) to enhance the seismic 

imaging of the sub-surface geology. The improvement of the geometrical 

consistency of the seismic data was attempted with static corrections for tidal 

altitude variations. The boomer data also required normal move-out corrections to 

minimize the differences between normal move-out time and the recorded two way 

time (TWT) affected by the system acquisition geometry. The main processing 

steps to enhance the geological imaging of the boomer records included: (1) a 

bandpass frequency filter to reduce noise; (2) a predictive deconvolution filter to 

 53



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

attenuate the water multiples; (3) an amplitude correction to compensate for the 

spherical divergence of sound propagation; (4) a spike deconvolution to compress 

the wavelet energy; and (5) a Stolt F-K migration procedure to correct for the “flat 

layer” assumption.   

As mentioned previously, the Chirp data was processed by automated 

hardware algorithms of the Chirp system that include match filtering, Hilbert 

transform and instantaneous amplitude computation (for a review of the chirp 

processing flow see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). For this reason the 

recorded Chirp data did not preserve phase information which prevented wavelet 

processing, such as data migration.  

The processing flow described below was fully applied to the boomer 

profiles, whereas the Chirp profiles were only corrected for static shifts and, later 

processed with an automated gain control to improve the identification of reflection 

continuity patterns. Both Chirp datasets, with and without AGC were used for 

interpretation, so that AGC-related artifacts could be easily detected. 

The applied seismic processing steps, in order of execution, are as follows: 

 

S1. Early mute 

The water column portion of the seismic records was muted in all 

processed boomer profiles. When required, an unprocessed profile was used to 

interpret the water column portion of the profile. The early mute was applied to 

prevent the introduction of unnecessary noise to the signal frequency spectrum 

analysis and to the spike deconvolution and migration processes. 

 

S2. Spherical divergence correction 

The amplitude values were corrected with a linear time variant gain, 

common to all boomer profiles, to compensate for the energy loss due to the 

spherical divergence of the propagating signal.  

 

S3. Normal move-out correction 

The normal move-out corresponds to the sound travel time for a 

hypothetical geophone placed at the source point. The source-receiver offset of 

 54 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

 55

the Uniboom system can result in significant differences between the recorded 

two-way travel times and the normal move-out time. For very shallow water 

acquisition (less than 5 m), these time differences can be of a magnitude 

equivalent to tidal altitude variations (see effect of source-receiver offset in 

recorded travel times in Fig III-10). 

 

S4. Static shifts 

 

The static shifts were applied to the seismic profiles in order to refer their 

time axis to a common vertical time datum, and thus minimize the vertical misties 

between profiles. The static shifts accounted for the correction of towing depths of 

the Chirp fish and for the tidal altitude variations inside the lagoon. The equipment 

towing depths were estimated onboard, during the data acquisition. The tidal 

altitude variations were estimated according to the tidal altitude tables and tidal 

delays table for the Ria of Aveiro, provided by the Hidrographic Institute of the 

Portuguese Navy (Instituto Hidrográfico). For each profile, a single mean tidal 

altitude value was used to compute the static shift. A test was done at a later date 

to correct tidal altitude variations on a trace to trace basis, using software 

specifically developed for the effect, but due to time constraints, the method was 

not applied to the full data set. An example of the importance of the tidal correction 

can be seen in figure III-11. 

 

S5. Burst noise removal 

 

The burst noise removal algorithm aims to remove high amplitude noise 

bursts from the seismic traces. This algorithm compares the amplitude of a sample 

with an amplitude average of samples from neighboring traces. It interpolates new 

amplitude values for samples that are N times greater than neighboring average 

(where N is a processing parameter). The boomer profiles had abundant burst 

noise and relatively low N values (N=2) had to be used to sensibly reduce the 

noise bursts. This meant that local and sudden changes in amplitude of geological 

significance were filtered out and had to be interpreted on unprocessed profiles.

S6. Bandpass frequency filter 

An Ormsby bandpass frequency filter was applied to the boomer data to 

attenuate noisy frequencies and to obtain a minimum phase dataset, necessary for 

the spike deconvolution filter.  The frequency spectrum of typical profile segments 

was calculated in order to determine approximate low and high pass frequencies 

(see figure III-12 for a typical frequency spectrum of boomer profiles). The low-cut 

and low-pass frequencies used were 50 and 100 Hz, respectively, and the high-

pass and high-cut frequencies were 1500 and 2500 Hz, respectively.

bandpass frequency filter. 

 

 

S7. Spike deconvolution 

 

The spiking deconvolution desired output is ideally the earth’s impulse 

response, which is obtained by compressing the wavelet energy as close as 

possible to a single spike, thus improving resolution and clarity of the seismic 

record (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The deconvolution operator length used here 

was 9 ms, based on the analysis of the autocorrelation function, with 0.5% white 

noise applied before the inverse filter calculation. The high frequency noise 

 58

 59

generated by the spike deconvolution was then filtered with a bandpass frequency 

filter (the parameters used were the same as in step S6). 

S8. Stolt F-K migration 

 

According to Sheriff and Goldart (1995) “…migration involves repositioning 

data elements to make their locations appropriate to the locations of the 

associated reflectors or diffracting points”. In other words, unmigrated data 

presents an image which is only correct for flat-layers, since reflector dip is not 

taken into account. As the imaged geological objects frequently are not flat, the 

seismic image is distorted and migration aims to correct that distortion. Stolt F-K 

migration is a simple migration method in the frequency-wavenumber domain, that 

assumes a constant medium velocity (Stolt, 1978). Trace spacing for the boomer 

profiles varied between ~0.5 m and 1 m due to frequent changes in traveling 

speeds (a consequence of navigating the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro). This 

fact, together with the natural medium velocity variations, affected the migration 

results, with evidence for both under migration (hyperbolae) and over migration 

(crossovers), which frequently coexist in the same profile.   

 

A comparison of the various processing stages of the boomer data is 

presented in figure III-13. 

 

 

 

3.3.3. Quality control results 
 

Quality control procedures aim to detect processing errors, caused either 

during the execution of the non-automated procedures or due to inadequate 

choices of the processing parameters. As discussed earlier, quality control results 

feedback into the processing flow, which is partially or totally repeated until the 

necessary non-random errors are corrected. Next, the results of the last iteration 

of the quality control procedures, prior to the geological interpretation of the 

seismic data, are presented and discussed.

Trackline analysis 

 

A visual analysis of the track lines was first carried out to identify gross 

trace position estimate errors, such as position estimates over land and sharp 

navigation turns not documented on the survey logbook. Most non-automated 

procedural errors tend to be detected during this step of quality control. If trace 

positioning data repeatedly fails this quality check, then it should not be used for 3-

D modeling (e.g. seismic unit mapping). The RIAV02 Chirp profiles acquired in the 

Terminal Norte for the underwater archeology survey had significant track line 

anomalies with multiple mismatches between documented ship turns and the 

plotted tracks. These errors, caused by triggering and recording problems of the 

chirp system, were not quantified, and could not be corrected, which meant that 

these profiles were not used for 3-D interpretation. Apart from these Chirp profiles 

no significant track line anomalies were observed in the interpreted datasets. 

 

 

Residual misties 

 

The first break reflection was picked in every seismic profile and the 

intersection misties were computed. These misties are referred here as residual, 

for they are determined after the NMO, towing depth and tidal altitude corrections 

were applied. Non-random residual misties may result from errors in estimates of 

the mentioned static corrections and/or from errors in trace position estimates. The 

final residual misties have a mean value of 0.75 ms with a maximum of 2 ms and a 

minimum below the sampling interval (&lt;0.1 ms). 

 

 

First break surface analysis 

 

The analysis of systematic irregularities of the first break time surface 

allows the estimate of non documented variations of the geometric parameters 

(both horizontal and vertical). Figure III-14 illustrates one case of poor static 

 61

correction that was found and corrected through of this procedure. A particular 

type of position error related artifacts were frequently observed on the first break 

surface of the processed dataset: V-shaped patterns that can be significantly 

pronounced near profile intersections when the lines cross steep morphologies. In 

the cases where residual misties are minimal, these artifacts can be explained 

either by GPS errors (e.g. non differential receiver data) or by the un-corrected 

midpoint offset value: this last situation may be aggravated by lateral currents 

affecting the towed equipment. 

 

 

 

3.4. Discussion 
 

The processing flows described aim at improving the interpretation 

conditions, to allow for a better identification, seismic characterization and 

mapping of the geological features of interest. Still, an assessment of several 

characteristics of the processed data set is required before the start of the 

interpretation work. The focus of the present discussion on the processed data is 

threefold: 

 

1. to inspect the signal quality and penetration on typical profiles and assess 

how noise and artifacts interfere with the geological signal; 

 

2.  to determine the theoretical vertical and horizontal resolutions and 

compare them with data examples in order to determine practical resolution 

values; 

 

3.  to assess what are the appropriate 3-D imaging scales according to the 

shape and size of the studied geological features and the relevant 

properties of the multiple seismic datasets (i.e. resolution, positioning 

quality and profile separation).

3.4.1. Signal quality and penetration 

The unprocessed boomer data shows frequent burst noise and a very long 

direct arrival that frequently interferes with first break and deeper reflections. The 

long direct arrival also provides evidence for a long ringing wavelet that 

significantly affects interpretation below strong reflections.  The occurrence of 

deep reflections below transparent zones in processed profiles indicates that the 

spike deconvolution appears to effectively reduce some of these ringing effects 

and that most of the deeper coherent events are primary reflections (see Fig. III-

15). The boomer signal had an observed penetration that varied between 50 and 

90 ms, i.e. approximately 68 m, assuming a constant sediment velocity of about 

1500 m/s. 

When present, sub-bottom coherent reflections in Chirp profiles usually 

have high continuity and amplitude. Signal penetration rarely exceeds the 15 to 20 

ms. Some weaker coherent reflections were recognized through comparison of 

data sets with and without automatic gain control (AGC) amplitude treatment (see 

Fig. III-16). This lack of variety of the seismic facies and poor penetration 

determines that distinguishing seismic units can be done mostly either locally or 

through correlation with the interpretation of boomer profiles from the same area, 

where available. 

Navigation conditions, tidal and wind currents in particular also seriously 

affected data quality. The characteristic mid to late afternoon northerly winds that 

cross the Ria of Aveiro tended to generate turbulence on the upper water layer 

which degraded the signal quality. When navigating against strong tidal currents, 

in particular closer to the lagoon inlet, the towed equipment suffered significant 

drag, which caused turbulence and added noise to the data. The changes in the 

surface current speeds caused by both wind and tides affected the navigation 

speed (varying between 2,5 and 7 knots). These speed variations resulted in the 

variable trace separation already described and, occasionally, in sudden changes 

in the pitch of the Chirp fish that are recognizable on the profiles by series of blank 

traces. Profiles Riav03-P02B and RIAV03-P02C illustrate some of these issues 

(see Fig. III-17).

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

Strong coherent reflections corresponding to side echoes were identified 

both in boomer and chirp data when tracklines run near harbor infrastructures or 

docked vessels (see Fig. III-18). As expected given the shallow water conditions of 

acquisition, the water multiple is the most generalized and strongest seismic 

artifact observed on both boomer and chirp profiles. 

An ubiquitous amplitude pattern in the Chirp data not discussed in this 

chapter should be mentioned here: the mean amplitude values of each profile 

appear to vary significantly with tidal altitude, independently of the source to 

reflector distance. This particular characteristic of the data set and its impact on 

the resolution and geological interpretation is analyzed and discussed in a later 

chapter of this work. 

3.4.2. Resolution of seismic data 
 

In seismic data, resolution commonly refers to “…the minimum separation 

between two features such that we can tell that there are two features rather than 

one”  (Sheriff, 1985; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The horizontal and vertical 

resolutions, and related interpretation scales of the Boomer and Chirp profiles will 

now be discussed here and illustrated using some features surveyed with both 

systems.  

 

Horizontal resolution 

In theory, the horizontal resolution of un-migrated seismic data corresponds 

roughly to the diameter of the “footprint” of the seismic wave on a reflector. This 

footprint can be described as the area of constructive signal reflection off a 

reflective surface. This area is called the First Fresnel Zone and is a function of the 

signal frequency and of the distance of the reflector to the signal source (see 

Equation III-5). Note that when reflector dimensions are smaller than the Fresnel 

zone, their response is that of a diffraction point (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

Radius of the first Fresnel Zone = 
f
tV

2
  (Equation III-5) 

where V is the average sound velocity, t the depth in time and f the signal 

frequency.

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

Horizontal resolution of the Boomer profiles 

The boomer data has a predominant signal frequency of approximately 1 

KHz at shallower depths, which decreases to 350 Hz at depth. For these 

frequencies and an average sound velocity of 1500 m/s, the horizontal resolution 

of the boomer profiles ranges from 4 m at shallow depths, up to 25 m at greater 

depth. Considering that the trace separation of the boomer profiles ranges from 

0.5 to 1 m, the Fresnel zone of each boomer shot overlaps those of 2 to 4 

neighbor shots at shallow depths and 25 to 50 shots at depth.  

Migration of seismic data aims to collapse the Fresnel zone energy (thus 

“repositioning” energy to its point of origin). The horizontal resolution of migrated 

data is harder to assess and is affected by issues such as errors in migration 

velocities and noise rearrangements. Still, assuming the sampling theorem that at 

least two samples must be obtained per feature wavelength, then the horizontal 

resolution of the migrated data should be greater than two migration bin widths. 

For the migrated boomer profiles the bin size corresponds to the trace separation, 

which means that the horizontal resolution of the migrated boomer data probably 

varies between 1.5 to 3 m (for three bin widths).   

The resolution values presented above for the migrated boomer profiles are 

optimistic for two reasons: (1) side echoes remain un-migrated and, where these 

occur, horizontal resolution is reduced; (2) trace separation varies along the same 

profile due to ship velocity variations and, as the Stolt F-K migration algorithm 

used requires constant trace separation and a constant sound velocity, the 

migrated profiles have under-migrated and over-migrated reflections which also 

contribute to reduce horizontal resolution.  

 

Horizontal resolution of the Chirp profiles 

The chirp data has a dominant frequency circa 2.5 KHz and a 

corresponding Fresnel zone of approximately 2.5 m at 5m depth and of 10 m at 30 

m depth (assuming a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). Trace separation of the chirp 

data also varies between 0.5 and 1 m, as with the boomer profiles, which means 

that each trace Fresnel zone roughly overlaps three Fresnel zones of neighboring 

shots, at the shallowest depths. According to the documentation provided by the 

 70 



Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – seismic reflection in shallow environments 
 
 

chirp manufacturer (Datasonics Corp.), the automated processing flow of the chirp 

data also has a “collapsing” effect of the Fresnel zone and the characteristic 

horizontal resolution of the processed chirp data is 1 to 2 m. 

 

Vertical resolution 

The vertical resolvable limit between two reflections was proposed by Lord 

Rayleigh as a half-cycle in order to minimize interference effects. In practice, the 

ballpark value used to estimate vertical resolution of most seismic reflection 

systems is ¼ of the dominant wavelength. In the case of the boomer data, the 

vertical resolution is estimated according to depth, to account for the perceptible 

changes in the dominant frequencies and seismic velocities with depth. At shallow 

depths, for a frequency of 1 KHz and a seismic velocity of 1500 m/s, the boomer 

vertical resolution is roughly 35 cm, whereas at greater depths, for a frequency of 

350 Hz and a seismic velocity of 2000 m/s, the boomer vertical resolution is 

approximately 1.5 m. 

The vertical resolution for the Chirp data corresponds approximately to the 

inverse of the source bandwidth (Gutowski et al., 2002). For the 8.5 KHz 

bandwidth of the Chirp data and an average sound velocity of 1500 m/s, the 

estimated vertical resolution is of approximately 17 cm. 

A visual comparison of a Boomer and chirp profiles crossing the same 

features is shown in figure III-19, which illustrates the differences in the resolution 

of both systems discussed above, providing a practical assessment of the 

theoretical estimates.  

 

Seismic resolution and interpretation scale 

 

The horizontal resolution for migrated boomer data is 1.5 to 3 m (varying 

with trace separation), and the vertical resolution is between 35 cm near the 

surface and 1.5 m at depth. Thus, the maximum interpretation scales for migrated 

boomer data are between 1:3000 and 1:6000, in the horizontal plane, and 1:700 

near the surface to 1:3000 at depth, in the vertical plane. Chirp data has 

theoretical horizontal resolutions of 1 to 2 m, and vertical resolution of 17 cm, 

 71

which correspond to maximum horizontal interpretation scales between 1:2000 

and 1:4000, and maximum vertical scale of 1:340. 

 

3.4.3. Coverage constraints on seismic imaging 

The positioning errors, profile separation and signal penetration are, together, the 

properties of a 2-D seismic coverage that will constrain the imaging of geological 

features. This section discusses the impact of positioning errors and misties on 3-

D imaging of a geological feature with 2-D seismic data from two different 

perspectives: 1) the production of accurate images, versus 2) the production of 

consistent images. A simple method to determine maximum 3-D imaging scales is 

proposed. This is followed by the discussion on how profile separation and signal 

penetration determines if a geological feature can beadequately imaged in 3-D.  

 

Positioning errors and misties 

The problem of dealing with the impact of positioning errors and misties on 

3-D imaging of a geological feature with 2-D seismic data can be stated according 

to two different approaches: 

1) Accurate 3-D imaging: the 3-D image has to be an accurately 

positioned representation of the seismic observations; 

2) Consistent 3-D imaging: the 3-D image has to be a consistent 

representation of the seismic observations; i.e. the horizon 

misties at profile intersections are below the scale of the 

representation of the image. 

From the accurate 3-D imaging point of view, positioning errors and the seismic 

resolution values will determine the maximum 3-D imaging scales. Given the 

variability in the positioning errors of multiple surveys, the data with the poorest 

positioning will control maximum scale of an accurate 3-D image. A slightly 

different problem is presented when the main objective is to obtain a consistent 3-

D image. In these cases, it is the residual interpretation misties, determined on a 

feature by feature basis, taken together with seismic resolution values that 

determine the maximum 3-D imaging scales.

Figure III-19: Reflections of the same structure imaged both by Boomer and Chirp profiles. 
Analysis of these profiles illustrates the practical seismic resolution of the two datasets. The 
minimum separation of the reflections observed in the chirp profile is of 2 samples (0.242 ms, 
corresponding to 18 cm for a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). The minimum separation of the 
reflections observed in the boomer profile is of 5 samples (0.5 ms, corresponding to 38 cm for a 
sound velocity of 1500 m/s). 

 73



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

It should be noted that the misties are a result of both horizontal and vertical 

positioning errors (as described in a previous sub-chapter), as well as a result of 

interpretation problems. Also, the misties of an interpreted feature are differently 

affected by the positioning errors depending on the relationship between the real 

positioning errors and the shape of the feature (e.g. the misties of a flat horizontal 

feature will only be the result of the vertical positioning errors and of the 

interpretation errors). 

A 3-D image that is both accurate and consistent will respect the seismic 

resolution, the positioning error and the horizon misties. It is possible to obtain a 

ballpark value for the scale of such 3-D image by adding the seismic resolution, 

the known positioning errors and the misties. Still, the resulting image may not be 

fully accurate for some positioning errors may remain unaccounted due to the 

complex relationship between positioning errors and misties.

the seismic data of the Ria of Aveiro, determined following the guidelines 

presented above.

Profile separation and seismic penetration 

An estimate of the expected wavelength and directionality of the geological 

features to be imaged should be done a priori to assess if the available or planned 

seismic coverage (i.e. profile separation and signal penetration) can adequately 

image those features. The preliminary estimate of the shape and size of the 

geological objects can be based on multiple seismic profiles (if available) that 

image the same feature. According to Hengl (2006), the signal frequency that 

describes an object can be determined by the density of inflection points. 

Therefore a simple assessment can be done by determining by minimum distance 

(?x, ?y, ?z) between inflection points observed along the feature’s major axis, as 

well as the strike and dip of these axes. These can be determined by resorting to 

stereographic projection methods. Large scale, reasonably flat surfaces like a 

marine transgression erosion surface may be described as having long 

wavelengths (i.e. ?x, ?y of several kilometers and a comparatively small ?z) dipping 

towards the offshore. Such a surface can be adequately modeled with widely 

spaced profiles perpendicular to the surface dip sense. In contrast to these simpler 

features, channel features like the modern small irregular tidal channels of the Ria 

of Aveiro are characterized by comparatively smaller wavelengths. A simple model 

of these tidal channels can be described by ?x (1/2 length) &amp;lt;250 m; ?y (1/2 width) 

&amp;lt;50 m; ?z (1/2 depth) &amp;lt;5 m), with various dominant trends and very gentle dips. 

Such features would require more densely packed, orthogonal and equally spaced 

profile coverage (less than 250 m apart). 

According to the sampling theorem, for a wave to be properly represented it 

has to be sampled at least twice per cycle (Nyquist sampling frequency). From a 

3-D imaging point of view, this means that the maximum profile separation directly 

determines the minimum width between inflection points for a feature to be 

properly imaged. In other words, if we consider that a geological feature can be 

characterized by certain wavelength, e.g. the extent of a symmetrical sedimentary 

basin, then this basin has to be crossed at least by two parallel profiles separated 

by a maximum of half the basins diameter. A greater separation between profiles 

will result in spatial aliasing of the features to be imaged. Nevertheless, the way 

 75



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

profile separation limits the choice of model scale is also dependent on the 

preferred orientation of the modeled object.  

The penetration of the seismic signal adds another dimension to this 

problem. A geological feature may have a shape and size that could, theoretically, 

be adequately imaged by a profile grid, and yet, modeling this feature may not be 

possible if the changes in dip (a function of the ratios of ?x/?z and ?y/?z) put the 

feature “beyond reach” of the seismic system penetration. A simple method to 

assess if a certain seismic coverage allows the correct imaging of a feature is to 

compare the ratio of profile separation (?prof) to system penetration (?pen) with 

the ratios of ?x/?z and ?y/?z that describe the shape and size of the feature. If 

?prof /?pen is greater than ?x/?z or ?y/?z, then the object cannot be reliably imaged 

with the available seismic coverage. This means that either more closely spaced 

profiles or a system with better penetration are required to properly image this 

feature.  

The adequate 3-D imaging and consequent geometrical characterization of 

a geological feature with 2-D seismic reflection profiles is further complicated by 

the frequently fractal nature of the geological features (for an introductory overview 

of fractals in nature see Mandelbrot, 1983). Although fractal objects are self-similar 

or scale-invariant, i.e., are made of parts that resemble the whole object, Euclidian 

measures of fractal objects are not scale independent as they are for Euclidian 

shapes (Barton et al., 1992). In other words, Euclidian measures of fractal objects 

are only comparable when made at the same scale. This means that problems 

arise when attempting to characterize the geometry of a geological object with a 

variable 2-D seismic coverage. Measures such as length or strike determined on 

profiles with various resolutions, signal penetration and profile separations can 

vary significantly for the same geological object, simply because the scale of 

observation changes from place to place, and not because of a significant 

difference in the objects geometry. Figure III-20 illustrates this problem applied to 

the mapping of a morphological feature and of a fault surface with variably spaced 

profiles.

Finally, when trying to determine the orientation of linear features, the 

relationship between sample proximity and positioning errors has to be inspected 

in order to determine if the interpreted orientation is sufficiently accurate to suit

research needs. For certain threshold relationships between profile separation and 

trace positioning errors, interpreted rectilinear features will present significant 

angular deviations that tend to produce “kink” like patterns. This is a common 

artifact observed near profile intersections, related to positioning errors. Therefore, 

there is a minimum effective profile separation for reliable interpretation of this type 

of features, which depends on trace positioning errors. The relationship between 

profile separation, positioning errors and error of the modeled direction is 

presented in figure III-21. This figure can be used as a guide to assess whether 

irregularities in an imaged linear feature are positioning error related artifacts or a 

reliable representation of the interpreted feature.

modeled direction of a linear feature. This abacus plots lines of equal angular error for a given 
relationship of positioning error and profile separation. Increases in positioning error and/or 
decreases in profile separation result in a greater error of the modeled direction of a linear feature. 
The positioning error related irregularity of a modeled linear feature can be minimized by limiting 
data input from profiles with adequate separation. Axes are labeled in arbitrary but consistent 
distance units.

In the case of the Ria of Aveiro, the separation between the profiles varies 

significantly, mainly because the navigation was strongly constrained by the 

lagoon’s hydrography. Profile separation ranges from near coincidental (tens of 

centimeters apart along several tens of meters), up to hundreds of meters apart, in 

a same tidal channel, and kilometers apart when considering profiles acquired in 

different channels. A generalized value for the profile separation in different 

areas/channels of the lagoon is difficult to determine because local track line 

variations are very common and often significant. Consequently, the choice of the 

appropriate interpretation scale as a function of the seismic coverage will have to 

be done on a case by case situation.  The final decision will be one of whether to 

use a single interpretation scale or to make multiple interpretations at different 

scales for different locations. 

 

3.5. Summary and conclusions 
 

The seismic data set used for this study has multiple vintages and the 

profile coverage was significantly constrained by the lagoon’s hydrography. This 

work shows that appropriate documentation of the acquisition procedures and 

adequate processing of the navigation data are necessary for a reliable estimate 

of the trace positions. Corrections such as static corrections to compensate for 

tides and normal move-out corrections allow for a better constrained common 

vertical datum and time scale of the seismic profiles. These data positioning 

improvements result in a better spatial consistency for different data vintages.  

The study of the relatively small geological objects on a coastal system like 

the Ria of Aveiro requires closely spaced profiles. For profile separations smaller 

than 100 meters, errors in the seismic trace position estimates are significantly 

influenced by the systems acquisition geometry and tidal altitude variations. Errors 

in the order of several meters due to the use of single mode GPS, lack of control 

of mid-point layback/offset values, tidal altitudes of up to 2.5 meters all add up. 

These errors can be comparable or even greater than 2-D seismic resolution of 

boomer and chirp systems. This will significantly degrade the quality of the seismic 

 79



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

interpretation and 3-D imaging, with effects being more relevant the smaller the 

object of study. 

Ideally, trace and sample positioning errors should be less than half the 

seismic resolution, so that no sample is placed within the sampling area of a 

neighbor sample (for a discussion on this issue see Hengl, 2006). This could be 

achieved with full horizontal and vertical RTK GPS positioning of both source and 

receiver; synchronization of the GPS and the seismic acquisition system should be 

within 10 ms, so that, when surveying at 5 knots, errors are at most equal to the 

RTK-GPS. RTK GPS altitude data is essential to properly correct the tidal and or 

the eventual swell effects on the towed equipments.  

The seismic signal processing proposed in this work, particularly of boomer 

data, provides significant improvements in signal quality and interpretability. Of 

particular importance when surveying shallow environments is the normal moveout 

correction, which allows shallower samples to be adjusted to a common vertical 

datum and improve significantly the ability to correlate interpretations between 

different seismic data vintages.  

The heterogeneity of the seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and 

resolution all constrain the use of the data to mostly local but detailed 

interpretations of the geological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. Particular care must 

be taken in assessing the impact of the variable horizontal coverage implied by the 

variable profile separation, and the probable fractal nature of the imaged 

geological features. The greatest profile separation used in a 3-D image should 

constrain the maximum imaging scale because imaging a fractal object at different 

scales may lead to unreliable results (see Fig III-20). To a certain extent, a parallel 

can be drawn between the approach that has to be adopted in this type of studies 

and onshore geological mapping. As with onshore geological mapping, the coastal 

geological map will have to be constructed from local meso-scale observations, 

where densely packed seismic data has to be locally interpreted in a similar way to 

the interpretation onshore of available rock outcrops. Correlation between these 

windows of observation (clusters of profiles or outcrops), if possible, has to be 

inferred from other indirect evidence (nature of soil, morphology etc). A good 

example of what can be accomplished in 3D imaging with 2D seismic data, by

following the workflow presented here, is the 1:5000 map of horizon isobaths 

shown in figure V-21 of the Chapter V of this thesis. Producing a map at such a 

detailed scale was only possible after a strict control and correction of the 

numerous processing issues discussed in the work. 

The relative scarcity of published works that deal with the problems of 

acquisition and processing of very resolution seismic reflection data in shallow 

waters probably reflects the fact that the typical study sites and objectives of other 

shallow water studies allowed for the use of more straightforward surveying 

strategies. Typical study targets extend for several kilometers and regular survey 

grids appropriate for such targets are reasonably followed. Positioning 

requirements it these cases can be met by the available navigation methods such 

as GPS, and the uncertainties in the geometry of the deployed system are 

irrelevant given the typical scale of the studies. Navigation constraints inside a 

lagoon like the Ria of Aveiro require different exploration strategies, which involve 

locally detailed studies of relatively small targets (less than 100 meters wide). This 

requires greater integration and control of navigation and of the deployed seismic 

system in order to describe the study targets with sufficient detail. The priorities in 

future work should include improving the operational conditions and positioning 

control, in order to acquire data over the shallower areas of the lagoon (water 

depth less than 2 meters) and better constrain such factors as tidal altitude and 

synchronization between the seismic system and the navigation system. 

Developments in these areas can contribute to the development of a functional 

very high resolution 3-D seismic reflection system capable of operating in these 

environments and with sub-meter resolutions and signal penetration of up to 100 

meters. Such a system would be well suited towards the study of costal 

environments characterized by geological features with highly variable shapes and 

sizes.

Abstract 
Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and an important energy source. 

The global importance and impact in coastal zones of methane gas accumulation 

and seepage in sediments from coastal lagoon environments is still largely 

unknown. This paper presents results from four high resolution seismic surveys 

carried out in the "Ria de Aveiro" barrier-lagoon (Portugal) in 1999, 2002 and 

2003. These include three Chirp surveys (RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A) and one 

Boomer survey (RIAV03). Evidence of extensive gas accumulation and seepage in 

tidal channel sediments from the “Ria de Aveiro” barrier-lagoon is presented here 

for the first time. This evidence includes: acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, 

acoustic blanking, domes and acoustic plumes in the water layer (flares). The 

stratigraphy and the structural framework control the distribution and extent of the 

gas accumulations and seepage in the study area. However, in these shallow 

systems, tidal altitude variations have a significant impact on gas detection with 

acoustic methods, by changing the raw amplitude of the enhanced seismic 

reflections, acoustic turbidity and acoustic blanking in gas-prone areas. Direct 

 83



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

evidence of gas escape from drill-holes in the surrounding area has shown that the 

gas present in the “Ria de Aveiro” consists of biogenic methane. Most of the gas in 

the study area was probably mainly generated in Holocene lagoon sediments. 

Evidence of faults affecting the Mesozoic limestones and clays underlying some of 

the shallow gas evidence, and the presence of high amplitude reflections in these 

deeper units, raise the possibility that some of this gas could have been generated 

in deepersedimentary layers, and then migrated upwards through the fractured 

Mesozoic strata. 

 

 

4.1. Introduction 
 

Estuaries and coastal lagoons are depocenters of organic rich sediments 

which are sources of methane (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and Middelburg, 

2000). These systems are excellent and easily accessible natural laboratories to 

investigate the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation, migration and 

escape (e.g. Garcia-Gil, 2003). However, the spatial and temporal variability and 

the complexity of these shallow gas systems require dense grids of geophysical 

data in order to get representative sampling. As a result, the importance of the 

escape of methane gas from sediments of estuarine and lagoon environments to 

the atmosphere is still poorly known or underestimated, and has not been taken 

into account in the International Panel for Climate Change assessment reports of 

the geological emissions of methane (Hovland et al., 1993; I.P.C.C., 2001; Etiope, 

2004; Judd, 2004). Estuaries and coastal lagoons where responsible for the 

generation of large accumulations of oil and gas now being exploited. 

Accumulations of shallow gas in such present-day systems were the volume and 

concentration are adequate, may also be exploited for biogas, for local use in the 

near future, similarly to what is already happening in African lakes and in artificial 

dairy lagoons (e.g.Williams and Frederick, 2001; Hirsch et al., 2005). Thus, 

understanding the importance, the controlling factors and the mechanisms of 

methane generation, accumulation and escape in coastal shallow water systems 

may yield useful indicators for oil and gas exploration and contribute to the 

 84 



Duarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas 
 
 

evaluation of the potential of present day biogenic methane gas in estuaries and 

coastal lagoons as a possible alternative energy source. 

Seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in sediments has been 

reported in all marine and coastal environments, both in deep and shallow water 

(e.g. Hovland and Judd, 1988). Seismic reflection methods have proven to be 

particularly useful for the identification, characterization and mapping of the 

distribution of gas accumulations and seepage. Nevertheless, comprehensive 

seismic investigations of barrier-lagoon environments are still sparse (e.g. the 

Venice lagoon in McClennen et al., 1997). 

The aim of this paper is to present, for the first time, high-resolution seismic 

evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in the sediments of a tidal channel in 

the “Ria de Aveiro” barrier-lagoon, and to characterize the stratigraphic and 

structural control of these occurrences. Data from 4 different cruises carried out in 

1999, 2002 and 2003, all with a very dense seismic coverage, was used. The 

purpose was three-fold: (1) to have enough detail and resolution to adequately 

map small gas accumulations (of the order of 30 m long); (2) to verify the 

consistency of these gas accumulations in a period of several years; (3) to analyze 

profiles acquired in the same area at different tidal altitudes, in order to investigate 

the likely influence of tidal effects on the detection of gas accumulations and 

escape. 

 

 

4.2.  Setting: The “Ria de Aveiro” 
 

The Ria de Aveiro is a very recent barrier-lagoon system, located in the 

Northwest Portuguese coast (Fig. IV-1). It is a remarkable example of a fast 

coastal evolution, from an open bay to the sea, formed ca. the Xth century, to the 

present barrier-lagoon system (Abecasis, 1954). The Ria de Aveiro is composed 

of a complex network of tidal channels, tidal flats, salt marshes and supra-tidal 

sand isles and it encompasses an area of approximately 530 km2, making it the 

largest coastal lagoon system in Portugal. It is located at the mouth of a drainage 

basin of 3,635 km2, covered mostly by the Vouga River and its tributaries.  Water 

 85

 86 

depths are usually quite shallow, of 1 to 2 meters, reaching locally more than 20m 

on the navigable channels. Water breaks and harbor installations are common 

along several of the navigable channels of the lagoon, and the communication with 

the sea, originally through a natural migrating inlet, is now made via an artificial 

inlet created in 1808. Tides are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an average 

amplitude at the inlet of 1.90m, ranging between 1.22m and 2.57m, during neap 

and spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude decreases with 

the distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. The phase lag, 

variable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, with low and 

high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of the lagoon 

(Dias et al., 2000). Water volume at low spring tides is 65hm3 and the tidal prism at 

spring tides is about 80 hm3, with an estimated time of residence of the water of 

three days (Teixeira, 1994). 

 

Onshore geology reveals dune, beach and lagoonal sediments of 

Quaternary age, composed essentially of unconsolidated sands and clays, 

overlying a sedimentary succession of Mesozoic clays and limestones of the 

Lusitanian Basin gently dipping to the west. Borehole data ranging from a few 

meters to over 200 meters and seismic reflection profiles (Chirp and Boomer) 

show that the Quaternary sediments are less than 10 meters thick to the East of 

the study area, and over 100 meters thick to the West (the deeper sediments are 

probably Neogene), with an erosive lower boundary, locally channelized, mostly 

flat and gently dipping less than 1º to the west (Marques da Silva, 1992; Teixeira 

and Pinheiro, 1998). Direct observations of escape of biogenic methane from 

several drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area surrounding the Ria of 

Aveiro were reported for the first time by the Portuguese Geological Survey in 

1967 (Faria et al., 1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed on other 

land wells for water exploration. More recently, Duarte et al. (2003) identified 

several high backscatter patches on the sidescan sonar imagery acquired in other 

parts of the Ria de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which 

they interpreted as related to gas escape; some of these features may correspond 

to pockmarks.

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

The study area discussed in this paper (Fig. IV-1) consists of a tidal channel 

domain of the Ria de Aveiro (roughly 1 km2) that includes part of the Espinheiro 

and the Vila channels, where a dense seismic coverage was acquired to 

investigate the seismic stratigraphy, the structural control and the existence of gas 

accumulations. The Espinheiro channel is the main outflow conduit of the Vouga 

River. It feeds the Vila channel that communicates with the lagoon inlet. The 

Espinheiro channel has an inner meandering channel and a prograding sand body 

where it meets the Vila channel. The Vila channel is regularly dredged to maintain 

ship navigation conditions. 

 

4.3. Database and Methods 
Four high resolution seismic reflection surveys, RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A 

and RIAV03, were carried out in the "Ria de Aveiro", on board the “Ria Azul”, from 

the Aveiro Harbor Authority, to investigate the seismic stratigraphy, the structural 

control and the existence of gas accumulations. Over 220 km of Chirp profiles 

were digitally acquired with a Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar during the 

RIAV99, RIAV02 and RIAV02A cruises. The signal bandwidth was 1,5-10KHz, the 

output power was 1KW and the chirp length 10ms (approximate vertical resolution 

of 10-15cm). During the RIAV03 cruise, 47km of additional Boomer profiles 

(EG&amp;amp;G Uniboom) were also acquired. The output energy used was 100-watt s-1 

and the receiver array consisted of a single-channel streamer with 24 

hydrophones. The signal frequency spectrum ranged from 250 to 1400Hz 

(estimated vertical resolution&amp;lt;2m). Seismic processing was carried out with the 

SPW software package (Seismic Processing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience 

Corporation).  

The processing of the boomer records included frequency band-pass 

filtering and time-variant amplitude gain correction. Deconvolution was also 

applied on some of the boomer records. The estimated depths of the seismic 

reflections were calculated using velocities of 1,500 m/s for the seawater and 

1,700 m/s as an average for the soft sediments. From these 4 surveys, 11.5 km 

and 59 km of Boomer and Chirp profiles, respectively, were selected to obtain a 

 88

dense grid of seismic profiles that covers the navigable part of the channels in the 

study area, with a separation between profiles that ranges from 10 to 75m (Fig. IV-

2). The ship speed was about 4-5 knots. Dynamic positioning of the profiles was 

done with differential GPS in the 2002 and 2003 cruises, and with conventional 

single-frequency GPS (affected by Selective Availability) in the RIAV-99 cruise 

(the 6 km of profiles in the study area from this cruise were mainly used for 

interpretation, but not for mapping, given the large associated positioning errors).  

A constant time shift was applied to each profile to account for tidal 

fluctuations and the depth of the towed equipment (fish and streamer). Residual 

misties, in general, did not exceed 1 ms. The vertical datum of the surveys was 

corrected to match the Hydrographic Zero Datum used by the Portuguese 

Hydrographic Survey, by matching the estimated horizon depths with the true 

depths for the same horizons derived from geotechnical soundings that cut 

through the Mesozoic bedrock (based on unpublished reports from the Harbor 

Authority kindly made available for this study). SEG-Y seismic data management 

and interpretation was carried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-

technology Inc.) and the Openworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics 

Corporation) seismic interpretation software packages. All the available borehole, 

seismic and geographical data was inserted into a GIS database (ArcGis, ESRI; 

see Fig. IV-2 for location of seismic lines and borehole data), which was used 

throughout this work for spatial computations.  

 

4.4. Results 

4.4.1. Acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and 

seepage 

The changes in acoustic character that characterize gas evidence (as described 

for marine environments by Hovland and Judd, 1988; or, for coastal environments, 

by Garcia-Gil et al., 2002) are not always easily perceptible due to specific 

characteristics of the seismic acquisition conditions in a shallow lagoon 

environment.

Duarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas 
 
 

In these shallow systems, the survey coverage variability, the frequent changes in 

profile direction, the strong and variable bottom multiple interference caused by 

shallow water depth and the tidal altitude changes (about 2 meters), and the 

scarcity of reflections, due to sediment homogeneity or the lack of signal 

penetration in the presence of sandy sediments, all limit the identification of gas 

evidence. Taking into account all these limitations, all diagnostic seismic features 

that could potentially be related to gas in the Ria de Aveiro were identified on each 

seismic line, compared with the neighboring lines to check for the lateral 

consistency, and mapped. 

The seismic evidence of the presence of gas identified on the seismic data 

falls into two main groups: 

1. Sub-bottom/bottom seismic features: acoustic turbidity in the sediment 

layers, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, domes; 

2. Water-column seismic features: acoustic plumes (flares), bottom 

acoustic turbidity and cloudy acoustic turbidity in the upper water layer 

(cloudy turbidity; Garcia-Gil et al., 2002). 

 

Sub-bottom/bottom seismic features 
 
Acoustic Turbidity 

Acoustic turbidity (AT) is recognized as a variable degree of disturbance on 

the seismic record (AT in Fig. IV-3), which sometimes allows coherent reflections 

to be followed through, with reduced amplitude (Hovland and Judd, 1988; Garcia-

Gil et al., 2002). Acoustic turbidity can be caused by gas bubbles or vesicles in 

typically impermeable sediments, although it can also be caused by other point 

scatterers like e.g. coarser grains in poorly sorted sediments. Small percentages 

of gas volume (1%) are enough to generate acoustic turbidity (Fannin, 1980). 

 
Enhanced reflections 

Enhanced reflections (ER) are characterized by a marked lateral increase in 

the amplitude of coherent reflections (ER in Fig. IV- 3). They can be caused by the 

accumulation of gas bubbles below an impermeable interface, generally at the top 

of a sediment bed or at an angular truncation, or by the presence of methane-

derived authigenic carbonates. Lateral facies variations non-related to gas can 

 91

 92 

also cause enhanced reflections. The frequency content of gas-related enhanced 

reflections will in general be lower than the original reflections and phase reversal 

generally occurs (Hovland and Judd, 1988).  

 

Acoustic blanking 
Acoustic blanking (AB) is characterized by a transparent or signal-starved 

domain in the seismic section, topped either by an enhanced reflection, broken or 

coherent, or by acoustic turbidity (AB in Figs. IV-3, IV-4 and IV-5). The signal 

starvation is interpreted as the result of the attenuation of the acoustic signal 

caused by gas in the sediments. Depending on the amount of gas, reflections that 

cross or lie below the area with gas often exhibit a pull-down effect caused by the 

lower sound propagation velocity in the gassy sediments. In areas such as the Ria 

de Aveiro, where old shipwrecks are abundant, it should also be noted that 

wooden debris can also cause localized acoustic blanking because the acoustic 

response of dry wood in wet sediments is similar to that of gas (Quinn et al., 

1997).  

 

Domes  
The domes (DM) observed in the study area (DM in Figs. IV-3 and IV-5) are 

small elongated elevations, 2 meters high and 30 to 50 meters long, found at the 

bottom of the lagoon, usually capped by a strong reflection at the water-sediment 

interface, and are associated with acoustic evidence of gas accumulations (Fig. 

IV-3). Although the nature of these features is not yet fully understood due to the 

lack of sampling, they may result from mud extrusion caused by gas overpressure 

of clayey sediments, from accumulation of organic debris, or they may correspond 

to small (methane related?) carbonate  build-ups.  

 

 Seismic features in the water column 
 

Acoustic plumes (flares), acoustic turbidity near the channel bottom, and 

cloudy turbidity in the upper water layer (upper 10 ms) are extensively observed 

on the Chirp records from the study area (Figs. IV-3 and IV-6). These features 

may result from a variety of factors, including gas bubbles in the water column, 



Duarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas 
 
 

suspended matter, gas in fish swimming bladders, acquisition system artifacts, or 

ship noise.  

 

Acoustic plumes 

The Chirp records reveal several localized areas with well defined plumes 

(PL in Fig. IV-3) of acoustic turbidity in the water layer (flares), usually elongated, 

either vertical or strongly dipping, often starting near the water-bottom and 

extending towards the surface (Fig. IV-6). The amplitude of the acoustic reflections 

in these plumes is often stronger in their upper part. These features are similar to 

those described in other locations (e.g. the Ria de Vigo, Spain, Garcia-Gil et al., 

2002) as resulting from sound reflecting off gas bubbles that are escaping from the 

sediments to the water column. Occasionally, some of these plume-like features 

do not start at the water-bottom. Although in some cases they may correspond to 

fish shoals, several of them are interpreted here as gas bubbles escaping 

obliquely to the seismic profile, particularly when they are found over sediments 

with other evidence of gas accumulation.  

 

Bottom acoustic turbidity 

Bottom acoustic turbidity is also locally observed on Chirp sections in the 

Ria de Aveiro, close to the lagoon bottom, usually above enhanced reflections or 

acoustic blanking (Fig. IV-3). These features can be caused by gas escape, where 

the gas is being quickly dissolved as it rises through the water column, or by a 

high density of benthic/pelagic organisms, possibly benefiting from a gas-enriched 

feeding environment.    

 

Cloudy acoustic turbidity in the upper water layer 

Cloudy turbidity, similar to that  described by Garcia-Gil (2002) in the Ria de 

Vigo, is also frequently observed in the upper water layer, on the Chirp seismic 

sections (upper 5-10 ms; Fig. IV-7). It can be caused by point scatterers in the 

water column, like gas bubbles, matter in suspension or gas in the swimming 

bladders of fish. The fact that this shallow turbidity in the study area generally 

occurs at a typical water depth, suggests the existence of some sort of control on 

 93



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

the occurrence of these point scatterers or the existence of a water depth 

detection threshold for these features, possibly due to signal energy loss in the 

water column. The observed frequency of point reflections is also clearly related 

with the tidal altitude. Point reflections counted on a total of ca. 20000 traces, are 

10 times more frequent at lower tidal altitudes (37 point reflections per 1000 traces 

during low tide, ebb and flood) than at high tidal altitudes (4 point reflections per 

1000 traces during high tide).  

 
 
Figure IV-3: Acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage from the NW gas field (GF1) 
observed on Chirp profiles. Note the association of the observed dome structure (40x20 m and 2 m 
high) with evidence of gas accumulation in the sediments observed on these 5 Chirp profiles in the 
Espinheiro Channel. Also notice the marked difference in the strength and extent of the gas 
evidence on the profiles 2 and 3, acquired at low tide (stronger and more extensive), with the 
evidence on the profile 5, acquired at high tide (weaker). Location of the profiles is represented in 
the lower left map of gas evidence, (see Fig. IV-2 for the location of this inset in the study area).

See discussion in the text. 
 

4.4.2.  Distribution and extent of gas accumulation and 
seepage 
 

Acoustic evidence of gas accumulation in the sediments is abundant in the 

study area (ca. 14% of the total area) and it is concentrated in two main gas fields 

in the northeast and in the southwest sectors (GF-1 and GF-2; Fig. IV-8), where 

 97



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

 98 

the water is shallower, usually less than 4 meters. Both gas fields exhibit several 

of the characteristic acoustic evidence of gas accumulations. 

On the Chirp sections, acoustic evidence of gas accumulations is generally 

observed in the first few meters of the sediments and rarely reaches the water-

bottom interface. Where a dense seismic coverage is available and the 

interpretation well constrained, the gas accumulations generally consist of roughly 

circular or elongated patches, 30 to 150 m long. This shows why it is necessary in 

these systems to acquire a dense seismic coverage, with separations between 

lines of less than 15m, in order to adequately map these accumulations without 

spatial aliasing. As such, in this study, interpolation and extrapolation of gas 

anomalies for mapping was only carried out when the separation between 

adjacent profiles was less than 20 meters, and therefore the mapped evidence of 

gas accumulation may underestimate the total area of gas accumulation.  

Areas with acoustic blanking are frequent and are often associated with 

adjacent enhanced reflections. These reflections are interpreted as resulting from 

gas migration from the zones of acoustic blanking, to the neighboring sedimentary 

layers. Acoustic blanking is also frequently adjacent to and in apparent continuity 

with acoustic turbidity on neighboring profiles. Often, this adjacent acoustic 

turbidity is very similar to the top of the acoustic blanking zones but it is not 

mapped as such, given the difficulty in sometimes unambiguously determining the 

occurrence of blanking below the turbidity (either due to multiple interference, 

absence of reflections due to an homogeneous sedimentary section or poor signal 

penetration in sandy sediments). It has also been observed that gas-prone areas 

with strong evidence of acoustic blanking on profiles acquired at low tide, often 

appear as areas of acoustic turbidity (sometimes very tenuous and of reduced 

extent) on almost coincident profiles acquired at high tide (see Fig. IV-3 and 

compare the overall strength and extent of gas evidence on profiles 2 and 3, 

acquired at low tide, with the gas evidence on profile 5, acquired at high tide).  

In the study area, the acoustic evidence of gas accumulation is generally 

observed in the upper seismic unit that corresponds to Holocene tidal channel-fill 

sediments (probably ca. 800-200 years BP, Duarte et al., 2005). The typical 

dimensions of the areas with spatially  coherent acoustic  evidence  of gas

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

accumulation (typically 30 to 150 meters long)  probably reflect the size of the host 

sedimentary bodies.Considering that the tidal channels in the "Ria de Aveiro" are 

usually 20 to 300 meters wide, it should be expected that their sediment infill 

bodies, where gas may be generated or trapped, have a similar range of 

dimensions. 

The two roughly elliptical, 40 meters long domes observed in the study area 

are strongly spatially associated with clear evidence of gas accumulation in the 

sediments. This relationship is particularly obvious in the northwestern dome on 

GF1 (Fig. IV-3), where the dome clearly mimics the shape of an acoustic blanking 

zone located down-dip, a few meters to the west (Fig. IV-3). On the Chirp profile 

that crosses the southern edge of this dome, there is no evidence of acoustic 

blanking; instead, a 20 meter-wide graben is observed, with a small offset affecting 

the sediment layers and the water-bottom, suggesting that the degassing of the 

deeper sediments might be causing the subsidence and deformation of the upper 

sedimentary layers (Fig. IV-3).  

Unlike the other gas evidence, the eight acoustic plumes observed in the 

study area occur in deeper waters (more than 6 meters), where currents are 

stronger, the bottom sediments are coarser and where, sometimes, the Mesozoic 

clays and limestones outcrop. No clear evidence of a nearby source of gas 

accumulation was found for the acoustic plumes. Nevertheless, six of the eight 

observed plumes occur above a 1.5 km-wide graben with an offset of 

approximately 40 meters, that affects the Mesozoic bedrock (Fig. IV-9). A spatial 

relationship of gas evidence with the Mesozoic bedrock fracture pattern is also 

observed in other places, such as near the GF1 where a possible dome rests 

above the faulted Mesozoic bedrock (Fig. IV-5).  

 
 

4.5. Discussion and Conclusions 
 

Middelburg (2002) estimates that estuaries emit between 1.8 and 3.0 Tg 

CH4 yr-1. This estimate represents&amp;lt;9% of the total oceanic emission (Bange et 

al., 1998), which in turn is a very small component of the global methane emission. 

 100 



Duarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas 
 
 

While the well mixed assumption is most probably valid for the larger, open 

systems, evidence presented here for the tidal channels of these smaller but very 

organic rich environments, points to the existence of focused fluid escape 

structures and a very heterogeneous spatial and time control of distribution and 

extent of gas accumulation. 

 

 
Figure IV-9: NW-SE oriented graben affecting the Mesozoic bedrock, observed on the Boomer 
profile RIAV03-P01 (see location in Fig. IV-2). The acoustic plumes observed on Chirp profiles in 
the study area occur mostly above this graben structure. AB: Acoustic Blanking; S1 – erosive top of

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

This focusing of gas escape and space and time heterogeneities suggests 

that the premise of good water mixture might not hold true in this specific type of 

coastal lagoon systems and that the kind estimation presented by Middelburg 

(2002) may significantly underestimate gas emissions from small coastal lagoons.  

The variability in space (distribution and extent) and time (with the tidal 

cycle) of the acoustic evidence of gas in the studied area is in accordance with 

and illustrates in detail the fact that methane concentrations in rivers, estuaries 

and other coastal environments are highly variable at various spatial and temporal 

scales (Sansone et al., 1999). Unlike other very high resolution seismic-reflection 

gas studies of coastal environments, such as Chesapeake Bay (Hagen and Vogt, 

1999) or the Ria de Vigo (Garcia-Gil et al., 2002), that recognized and mapped 

large gas accumulations with a typical seismic profile separation of 200-250 

meters, the seismic investigation of gas accumulation and seepage in the 

sediments of the "Ria de Aveiro" required specific surveying and mapping 

strategies. This is because of the high spatial and temporal variability of barrier 

lagoon environments like the "Ria de Aveiro". Aspects like the strong and variable 

bottom multiple interference caused by shallow water depth and tidal altitude 

changes (about 2 meters), and the scarcity of high-amplitude laterally continuous 

reflections, due to sediment homogeneity or the lack of signal penetration in the 

presence of sandy sediments, all limit the ability to detect gas evidence, in 

particular the characteristic blanking effect or lateral changes of amplitude of the 

reflections. Also, the typical acoustic evidence for gas in the Ria de Aveiro consists 

of patches, 30 to 150 meters long, probably due to the characteristic size of the 

tidal channel infill sediment bodies that host the majority of the gas accumulations. 

Thus, the sizes of the gas-related objects to be studied required a profile 

separation of the order of 10 meters, or less, to adequately to map the gas 

evidence.  

Comparison of approximately coincident seismic sections acquired at 

different tidal altitudes, revealed that the acoustic detection of gas in the sediments 

and in the water layer of the Ria de Aveiro is particularly influenced by tides, with 

amplitudes and size of the evidences being stronger and larger in profiles acquired 

during low tide than on profiles acquired during high tide. The same influence is

also apparent on the observation of the cloudy turbidity in the water layer of the 

Chirp seismic lines, which could be gas-related, and that probably corresponds to 

the cloudy turbidity also observed in the Ria de Vigo (Garcia-Gil et al., 2002). 

Again, the frequency of these turbidity events varies with the tidal cycle, being 

roughly 10 times more frequent at low tide than at high tide. The simplest 

explanation for the observed tidal altitude control on the frequency of the 

occurrence of cloudy turbidity is a possible tide-related control on the behavior of 

some specific fish assemblages, more easily detectable by the acoustic systems 

used in this study. Nevertheless, it should be noted that ichthyofauna studies in 

the Ria de Aveiro (e.g. Garnerot et al., 2004; Pombo et al., 2005), showed that a 

decrease in marine influence results in a decrease in total density and biomass of 

fish assemblages; this is in disagreement with the pattern observed here: if the 

point reflections result from fish, then a higher density of reflections in the water 

column would be expected during high tide, which is just the opposite of what is 

observed. An alternative explanation is that there is a tidal control on the 

abundance of gas bubbles of optimal resonance-size for the acoustic frequencies 

used in this investigation (250 Hz to 1.4 KHz of the Boomer system and 1.5 to 10 

KHz of the Chirp system) caused by changes in pressure and or salinity resulting 

in ebullition and/or bubble size variation. This is consistent with a preferential 

detection of gas bubbles at low tide, when lower hydrostatic pressure and salinity 

could trigger ebullition and/or bubble size variations. An increase in bubble size 

towards the surface could explain why most point reflections are observed in the 

upper part of the water column (need for the bubbles to reach an optimal 

resonance size for detection with the frequencies used). 

The described relationships between tidal altitude and the gas evidence in 

the Ria de Aveiro can probably be explained by tidal fall triggered methane 

ebullition (e.g. Jackson et al., 1998) and/or by tidal induced changes in the number 

of optimal resonance size bubbles for the used frequencies (Best et al., 2004). 

Therefore, one needs to be careful when using acoustic methods to map gas 

accumulations, because areas with a similar amount of methane content in the 

sediments may produce a different acoustic response, such as seen in the Ria de 

Aveiro, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle during which they where

surveyed. Further data acquisition and modeling of the methane solubility and the 

variations in bubble size with the tidal cycle in the Ria de Aveiro is required to 

understand the relative importance of methane ebullition and the relationship of 

bubble resonance with the frequency range of the seismic reflection system in the 

detection acoustic evidence of gas.  

The fact that, where the acoustic plumes are observed, the sediments are 

generally relatively coarse and permeable (fine to coarse sands, Duarte et al., 

2003), could indicate a more diffuse fluid escape through these sediments. On the 

other hand, the lack of associated evidence of gas accumulation in the Holocene 

sediments, and the observed spatial relationships between the acoustic plumes 

and the fracture pattern of the Mesozoic bedrock, support the hypothesis of 

focused gas escape through the fractures in the Mesozoic bedrock. It should be 

noted, however, that a clear association between the acoustic plumes and some 

sort of gas source in the Mesozoic bedrock was not unambiguously found in the 

study area, nor gas analyses are yet available, and therefore the gas source of 

these acoustic plumes still remains unknown. 

The results obtained with this high resolution seismic study have shown that 

the Ria of Aveiro is an interesting natural laboratory to study the generation, 

migration and escape of shallow gas on a typical barrier lagoon system. The 

dense grid of seismic data allowed the detailed mapping of the different types of 

seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage. Moreover, seismic data 

acquired in different years showed that these gas accumulations are found 

consistently in the same area for long time periods, although minor changes in the 

character of the reflections can be observed. The interpreted evidence of gas 

accumulation and seepage ranges from acoustic blanking and turbidity, enhanced 

reflections in the sediments, to the presence of flares in the water column and, 

also possibly, the occurrence of small domes at the bottom of the lagoon, closely 

associated with gas accumulations at depth. Boomer records, in particular, 

suggest that the faults observed in the Mesozoic bedrock may also constitute 

pathways for the escape of deeper gas of yet unknown source and composition.

Abstract 

This work presents results from a Chirp high-resolution pseudo 3D seismic 

survey carried out in 2002 to investigate the occurrence of shallow gas in major 

tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon (Portugal). Evidence of gas 

includes: acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, pockmarks 

and buried trough pockmarks, disrupted horizons and acoustic plumes in the water 

column (flares). The impact of the tidal altitude variations on the detection of gas 

with seismic methods is analysed and a quantitative analysis of the changes of the 

amplitude strength of reflections with tidal altitudes is presented. Reflection 

amplitudes in gas-prone areas are clearly stronger during low tide with maxima 

during ebb, decreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this pattern 

confirms that ebullition and gas escape is triggered mainly by the decrease of 

pressure (hydraulic load) that occurs during the falling tide. Detailed mapping 

showed evidence of gas accumulations both in the Holocene sediments and in the 

Mesozoic bedrock of marls and clays. The location and geometry of fluid the 

escape features follows the fracture pattern that affects the Mesozoic bedrock, 

indicating that these fractures are preferential pathways for fluid migration and 

exert a structural control on the gas occurrences in the Ria of Aveiro.

5.1. Introduction 
 

The study of gas occurrence and seepage, mainly methane, is of significant 

interest for its role as a greenhouse gas and potential contribution to climate 

changes (Hovland et al., 1993; Houghton et al., 2001; Etiope, 2004; Judd, 2004), 

as an important energy source and as a cause of natural hazards (Best et al., 

2006). According to Best (2006), understanding these roles of methane gas 

requires the development of models of methane gas generation and gas flux, as 

well as the acquisition of reliable model input data, such as sediment accumulation 

rates, organic matter concentrations, amount of gas present, sediment shear 

strength, etc. Considering that the organic rich muddy sediments of estuaries and 

coastal lagoons are prime sources of methane gas (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der 

Nat and Middelburg, 2000), modern day estuaries and coastal lagoons are 

preferential objects for these studies on methane gas generation and gas flux 

(Garcia-Gil, 2003; Duarte et al., 2007).  

The present work presents new data from a Chirp high-resolution pseudo-

3D seismic survey, carried out to investigate shallow gas occurrences in a main 

tidal channel of the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon, located in North-West Portugal 

(Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b). This study aims at understanding the geological 

controls of the distribution and extent of acoustic evidence of gas accumulations 

and seepage, continuing previous work carried out in other areas of the Ria 

(Duarte et al., 2007). The dense pseudo-3D seismic coverage was chosen to 

characterize the 3D geometry of the Holocene lagoon sediments architecture and 

of the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock, allowing the identification of the 

structural controls on the fluid migration pathways and gas accumulation zones. 

The abundance of seismic data, both in time and space allowed a 

quantitative investigation of the hypothesis that the tidal cycle affects the extent 

and distribution of seismic evidence of gas, which was proposed in previous work 

in the Espinheiro Channel sector (see chapter IV; Duarte et al., 2007). The 

amplitudes of the bottom reflection of the Chirp data were investigated at the same 

locations at different tides in order to determine if there was a significant change in 

 106

amplitude strength as the tidal cycle evolved and the main results are presented 

here.

5.2. Setting: the Ria de Aveiro 
 

The Ria de Aveiro is a recent barrier-lagoon system, located along the 

northwest Portuguese coast, composed of a complex network of tidal channels, 

tidal flats, salt marshes and supra-tidal sand isles. It encompasses an area of 

approx. 530 km2, making it the largest coastal lagoon system in Portugal (Fig. V-

1). It is located at the mouth of a drainage basin of 3,635km2, fed mostly by the 

Vouga River and its tributaries. Water depths are usually quite shallow, 1-2m, 

locally reaching more than 20m in the navigable channels, with maxima greater 

than 29m at the artificial inlet that establishes communication with the sea. 

The semi-diurnal tidal cycle is the strongest forcing mechanism in the 

dynamics of the Ria of Aveiro. The small water volume at low spring tides is 

65x102 m3, and barely covers the main tidal channels. The tidal prism at spring 

tides is about 80x102 m3, and more than doubles the water mass in the lagoon, 

covering the extensive tidal flats and salt marshes the constitute the majority of the 

lagoon area. The estimated time of residence of the water in the lagoon is of 3 

days (Teixeira, 1994). Tidal amplitudes at the inlet average 1.90 m, ranging 

between 1.22 and 2.57 during neap and spring tides, respectively (Teixeira, 1994). 

The tidal amplitude decreases with distance from the inlet but it is measurable in 

the entire lagoon. The phase lag, variable at high and low water, increases 

upstream up to 5h, with low and high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in 

different parts of the lagoon (Dias et al., 2000).  

The coastal and lagoon sediments are essentially unconsolidated dune, 

beach, barrier and lagoonal sands and clays, deposited during the Pleisto-

Holocene transgression and highstand. Elevated sand and gravel beach deposits 

from prior Quaternary cycles are described towards inland (Teixeira and 

Zbyszewski, 1976). The Quaternary sedimentary sequence lays unconformably 

over the Mesozoic sedimentary succession of clays and limestones of the 

Lusitanian basin, deposited during the opening of the Atlantic. Borehole log data 

reaching down to 200m in depth and seismic reflection profiles (Chirp and 

Boomer) show that the Quaternary sediments are less than 10m thick to the 

eastern end of the lagoon, and over 100m thick closer to the inlet; the deeper 

 108

sediments in this area are of unknown age, possibly Neogene (Marques da Silva, 

1992; Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998). 

The consolidated lagoon bedrock of Mesozoic age is cut by a marine 

ravinement surface that dips gently westwards (less than 1º) and by an older 

fluvial erosion surface probably dating from the last glacial maximum, 18Ky BP 

(Duarte et al., 2007). The Mesozoic units dip approximately 3-6º to the west. The 

major structural feature cutting the Cretaceous rocks is a 2km wide, 40-60m deep, 

NNW-SSE trending graben of unknown age mapped in the Espinheiro sector 

(Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998; Duarte et al., 2007) and that probably extends 

through much of the lagoons’ bedrock (see Figs V-2 and V-3).

Early descriptions of possibly methane gas related phenomena in the 

lagoon area date back to the 1755 great Lisbon earthquake. The answers from 

local parishes to the Marquês de Pombal enquiries on the 1755 earthquake report 

that the Vouga river waters “boiled as if they were on fire” and that the waters from 

the Mira lagoon (at the south end of the Ria) “appeared to boil so hard that they 

would break at the lagoon shore as if they were sea waves” (Coelho, 2005; 

Oliveira, 2005); these tales may be explained by gas releases from seismically 

destabilized sediments. 

The first unequivocal direct observations of escape of biogenic methane 

from several drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area surrounding the Ria 

of Aveiro were reported by the Portuguese Geological Survey in 1967 (Faria et al., 

1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed in other land wells for 

water exploration. During previous work, Duarte et al. (2003) identified several 

high-backscatter patches on sidescan sonar images acquired in other parts of the 

Ria de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which they 

interpreted as related to gas escape; some of these features may correspond to 

pockmarks. More recent investigations with chirp and boomer high resolution 

seismics in the Espinheiro tidal channel of the Ria de Aveiro (Pinheiro and Duarte, 

2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Duarte et al., 2007) have 

shown extensive acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage, including 

acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, domes and acoustic 

plumes in the water column (flares). Recently, in September of 2006, gas samples 

were collected from extensive bubble trains observed during falling tide in a 

docking pier (“Doca Pesca”) in the Ria of Aveiro. The analysis of the gas samples 

composition by chromatography revealed that the gas was mostly methane (L.M. 

Pinheiro, personal communication) 

The study area investigated in this work (Fig. V-1) consists of two tidal 

channel domains in the Ria de Aveiro, including the Cidade channel and the 

Terminal Sul harbor docks area, each surveyed over an area of roughly 0.5km2. 

These tidal channels are part of the main navigation channel of the Aveiro harbor 

and are frequently dredged for ship navigation purposes down to a minimum water 

depth of approximately 6,5 m below the hydrographic zero.

5.3. Database and methods 
 

A major pseudo 3D chirp high resolution seismic survey, RIAV02A, was 

carried out in 2002 in the Terminal Sul harbor area of the Ria de Aveiro (Pinheiro 

and Duarte, 2003b). This pseudo 3D data set was complemented with a second 

chirp survey and a boomer survey, RIAV02 and RIAV03 (Pinheiro and Duarte, 

2003a; Pinheiro et al., 2003). All surveys were carried out onboard the launch Ria 

Azul of the Aveiro Harbor Authority. More than 220 km of chirp profiles were 

digitally acquired with a Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar from the Marine 

Geology unit of LNEG (DGM-LNEG) during the RIAV02 and RIAV02A cruises. The 

signal bandwidth was 1.5-10 kHz, the output power 1 kW, and the chirp length 10 

ms (approx. vertical resolution of 10-15 cm). During the RIAV03 cruise, 47 km of 

additional boomer profiles (EG&amp;amp;G Uniboom, also from DGM-LNEG) were also 

acquired. The output energy used was 100 W s-1, and the receiver array consisted 

of a single-channel streamer with 24 hydrophones. The signal frequency spectrum 

ranged from 250 to 1,400 Hz (estimated vertical resolution&amp;lt;2 m). 

Seismic processing was carried out with SPW software package (Seismic 

Processing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience Corporation), and with Radex Pro 

(from Deco Geophysical). The processing of the boomer records included 

frequency band-pass filtering and time-variant amplitude gain correction. 

Deconvolution and Stolt-FK migration (single sound velocity model of 1500 m s-1) 

were also applied on some of the boomer records. The estimated depths of the 

seismic reflections were calculated using velocities of 1,500 m s-1 for seawater, 

and 1,700 m s-1 as an average for soft sediments. The pseudo 3-D data set 

consists of 18km of profiles, covering an area of 1000x150m, with inlines 10 m 

apart and crosslines 40 m apart. The remainder boomer and chirp profiles have a 

more heterogeneous layout, with a separation of roughly 50 m, and extend the 

seismic coverage northwestards onto the Cidade channel (see Fig. V-1). The ship 

speed was about 4 knots. Dynamic positioning of the seismic profiles was done 

with a Real Time Kynematic GPS. A constant time shift was applied to each profile 

to account for tidal fluctuations and the depth of the towed equipment (fish and 

streamer). Residual misties for the pseudo 3-D data set do not exceed 0.5 ms 

 112

 113

(approximately 38cm, for a sound velocity of 1500m/s), whereas for the remainder 

of the profiles this value is slightly greater, of approximately 1ms (approximately 

76cm, for a sound velocity of 1500m/s). 

The vertical datum of the surveys was corrected to match the Hydrographic 

Zero Datum used by the Portuguese Hydrographic Survey, by matching the 

estimated horizon depths with the true depths for the same horizons derived from 

geotechnical soudings cutting through the Mesozoic bedrock (based on 

unplublished reports from the harbor; see Fig. V-4 for a example of the location of 

the geotechnical soundings near the chirp and boomer profiles, and the correlation 

of the two types of data). SEG-Y seismic data management and interpretation was 

carried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-technology Inc.) and the 

Openworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics Corporation) seismic 

interpretation software packages.  

Hydrological and geotechnical probing of Ria of Aveiro is relatively 

extensive due to the intensive human occupation of the area. Cores drilled for 

hydrological purposes frequently aim at the confined aquifer lying below the 

“Argilas de Aveiro” formation of the Maestrichtian Sedimentary Complex (Teixeira 

and Zbyszewski, 1976), including descriptions of rocks down to the Middle 

Cretaceous (Marques da Silva, 1992). The geotechnical log data of Standard 

Penetration Tests (SPTs) are usually shorter than the hydrogeological ones, 

normally reaching the top of the Mesozoic consolidated sediments, usually the 

“Argilas de Aveiro” formation. Only a couple of hydrological core logs are available 

close to the seismic profiles in the structurally more complex area of the lagoon 

(see core locations in Fig V-4). Still, these logs are close enough to the seismic 

profiles to allow for a calibration of the main geological units. The geotechnical 

logs are located near harbor infrastructures and the Terminal Sul area has been  

densely surveyed (see core locations in Fig. V-4). Over 120 geotechnical logs 

were used for the calibration of the vertical datum of the seismic data and for the 

geological interpretation. 

All available borehole, seismic and geographical data were collated into a 

GIS database (ArcGis ESRI), which was used throughout this work for spatial 

computations.

5.4. Results 
The acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in the studied 

area consists of acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, 

pockmarks and buried trough pockmarks, disrupted horizons, cloudy turbidity and 

acoustic plumes (flares) in the water column (see also Duarte et al., 2007). With 

the exception of the pockmarks, buried trough pockmarks and the disrupted 

horizons, all other types of evidence of gas were previously found and described in 

the Espinheiro channel of the Ria of Aveiro (Duarte et al., 2007), and the terms 

used here respect the meanings described in that work. Pockmarks are a type of 

gas related features not found in previous work in the Espinheiro area. These are 

circular to elliptical depressions with a common v-shaped cross-section, formed by 

fluid escape through the sediments that promote localized erosion and generate 

circular to elliptical depressions in the water bottom. When this fluid escape is 

focused through fractures, sometimes trough-like alignments of pockmarks occur 

on the water bottom along the fracture line. Buried pockmarks are past fluid 

escape structures such as those just described that were filled by sediments 

(Hovland and Judd, 1988). The disrupted horizons observed in the seismic profiles 

(e.g. Figs. V-7 and V-11) are probable/possible fluid escape structures that consist 

of near vertical ruptures of consolidated layers that exhibit uncommon localized 

deformation, indicating that hydraulic fracture processes may have contributed to 

their deformation.  

All the interpretation problems related to the specific seismic acquisition 

conditions in a shallow lagoon environment that Duarte et al. (2007) described in 

the study of the Espinheiro channel, also occurred here, e.g. the survey coverage 

variability, the frequent changes in profile direction, the strong and variable bottom 

multiple interference caused by shallow water depths and tidal altitude changes 

(about 2 m in the present case), and the scarcity of reflections due to lack of 

sediment heterogeneity or the lack of signal penetration in sandy sediments, 

limiting the identification of gas evidence. Taking into account these constraints, all 

gas related features identified in each profile were mapped for the Cidade channel 

and the Terminal Sul (see Figs. V-5 and V-6). The main structures affecting

Mesozoic guide horizons were also mapped and overlaid on isobath maps of the 

those horizons. 

 

5.4.1. Distribution and extent of gas in the Terminal Sul 
sector 

The Terminal Sul area has been covered by a very dense, pseudo-3D chirp 

profile coverage, with inlines approximately every 10m and crosslines 

approximately every 50m, which allows a confident determination of the 

distribution and extent of the areas of gas accumulation and mapping of the 

various seepage-related features. The evidence for gas in the Terminal Sul 

consists of: (1) two gas accumulations, named here as Terminal Sul Western Gas 

Field (TS-WGF) and Terminal Sul Eastern Gas Field (TS-EGF), (2) pockmarks 

and buried pockmarks, and (3) possible generalized gas accumulations within the 

outcropping/sub-cropping Mesozoic Marls and clays (Fig. V-5). 

The TS-WGF gas field is characterized by acoustic blanking and acoustic 

turbidity covering an area of 60,440m2 (22% of the seismic coverage area of 

Terminal Sul). These accumulations occur approximately 1m below the channel 

floor, and appear to be trapped underneath soft Holocene tidal channel deposits 

(black muds: Pinheiro and Duarte, 2002). An acoustic plume was observed 

ascending from this gas pocket (see profiles over TS-WGF in Figs. V-7, V-8 and 

V-9). 

The Mesozoic clays and marls outcrop or subcrop (less than 1 m below the 

channel bottom) over a significant part of the Terminal Sul area. The majority of 

these Mesozoic horizons have enhanced reflections that may result from either 

gas bubbles in the sediments, or sharp differences in the physical properties 

between the soft Holocene sediments and the consolidated Mesozoic marls and 

clays. The sharp changes in the patterns of enhanced reflections with tidal altitude 

suggest that these enhancements are more likely related to gas bubbles in the 

sediments (see Fig. V-10). Pending confirmation of the presence of gas, the 

Mesozoic enhanced reflections observed may correspond to an important gas 

accumulation zone with an area of 74,300m2 (27% of the seismic coverage area of 

Terminal Sul).

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

 
 
Figure V-8: Acoustic flare observed over acoustic turbidity zone (AT), on profile P07, cruise 
RIAV02, in the Terminal Sul. The flare possibly results from fluid seepage channeled through the 
dipping sediments layers. (a) – red line indicates profile location; (b) – profile R2-P07. 
 
 

The outcropping Mesozoic marls and clays are affected by an elliptical 

depression 70m long, 40m wide and 2m deep found in the central part of the 

channel bottom in the Terminal Sul area. This depression is underlined by 

coincident near bottom acoustic blanking and is interpreted as a possible active or 

recently active pockmark (see Figs V-7 and V-13).

Further to the east, two buried trough pockmarks, 10-20m wide and 1-2m 

deep, extending beyond the limits of the mapped area (at least 100m long), are 

observed cutting the Mesozoic horizons in the chirp and boomer profiles (see Figs. 

V-11, V-12 and V-13). Gas evidence in the form of acoustic turbidity and enhanced 

reflections are common in the sediments that cover these pockmarks, raising the 

possibility that gas may still be rising through the pockmark structures. The trough 

pockmarks are aligned NNW-SSE (24ºW and 15ºW, quadrant notation), with the 

eastern pockmarks slightly closer to the North-South direction. These directions 

are common to many tidal channels in the lagoon, and the eastern buried 

pockmark is aligned in the continuation of a modern tidal channel. At low tide, the 

chirp profiles show an overall strong acoustic turbidity in the water column (cloudy 

turbidity), similar to what was previously observed in the Espinheiro Channel 

(Duarte et al., 2007), above the area of the buried pockmarks (see Fig 14).

high tide. The amplitude of the reflections is stronger and acoustic turbidity is more abundant 
during low tide. (a) – red line indicates profiles location; (b) – profile P02; (c) – profile P03B.

Duarte, H. &amp;amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) – Structural and tidal controls on gas 
 
 

The TS-EGF, in the easternmost part of the Terminal sul area, is 

characterized by enhanced reflections and acoustic turbidity that vary significantly 

with tidal height; stronger amplitudes and more abundant acoustic turbidity are 

observed during low tide when compared with high tide (see Fig. V-10). The TS-

EGF occurs near the top of the Mesozoic bedrock, 1 to 3m below the channel 

bottom. Here, the Mesozoic sediments are faulted and the eastern blocks are 

downthrown to the East as confirmed by the geotechnical cores logs, more than 

15m down and do not intercept the Cretaceous “Argilas de Aveiro” formation. The 

potential gas accumulation area is of 14,240m2, 5% of the total seismic coverage 

area of the Terminal Sul (see Fig. V-5). 

 

 

5.4.2. Distribution and extent of gas in the Cidade 
Channel sector 

 

The seismic profiles in the Cidade channel area cover the central 100m 

wide portion of the main navigation channel. Profile separation is locally irregular 

ranging from a few meters to approximately 25m (see Fig. V-1), which means that 

some smaller areas of gas accumulation areas were probably not imaged. The 

Cidade channel has a gas field in its northern half (CC-NGF), and a few smaller 

patches of less unequivocal evidence of gas towards the south (Fig. V-6).  

The CC-NGF has an area of 31,460m2 (17% of the seismic coverage area 

of the Cidade Channel) and is mainly characterized by acoustic blanking. The 

acoustic blanking occurs below an enhanced reflection, approximately 1-2m below 

the channel bottom, which clearly blocks the acoustic signal from the normally 

strong Mesozoic reflectors below (see Fig. V-15). One relatively weak flare was 

observed at the northern edge of this gas field, where the top of the acoustic 

blanking reaches the channel bottom (see Fig. V-15). 

The CC-NGF occurs above folded and faulted Mesozoic horizons. The 

structural pattern of strongly dipping faults with apparent reverse kinematics, with 

limited spatial extension of the strain accommodation, is interpreted as a series of 

strike-slip shear zones (see Fig. 16). Towards the eastern margin of the channel,

Figure V-15: Acoustic blanking of deeper Mesozoic bedrock reflections observed in the chirp 
profile P05 (b), acquired in the Cidade channel during cruise RIAV02 (a – red line indicates profile 
location). A weak flare is observed where the enhanced reflection of the Holocene layer traps the 
gas front intercepts the channel bottom (c – flare shown with a spectrum color amplitude display). 
 

the disrupted Mesozoic horizons are clearly observed in both chirp and boomer 

profiles (Figs. V-16 and V-17. These horizons are partially or totally blanked below 

the gas accumulations closer to the western margin of the channel. It is 

emphasized that the disrupted Mesozoic strata is only well imaged below the

Holocene sediment cover where the gas trapping horizon is absent. Also, the gas 

accumulation occurs specifically in the area above the disrupted Mesozoic clays 

and marls and is absent to the north and to the south of this disrupted zone (see 

Fig V-17). The association between the shear zones that affect the Mesozoic 

bedrock and the overlying gas accumulation raises the possibility that the shear 

zones serve as fluid pathways and, also, that part of the intense strain 

accommodated by the Mesozoic bedrock were possibly caused by hydraulic 

fracturing processes. 

Evidence for gas in the southern half of the Cidade channel area is also 

commo

 

5.4.3. Structural control of fluid escape structures 

he Cidade channel and the Terminal Sul areas both show evidence of

faults affect the Mesozoic horizons and an unconformity of unknown age (intra- 

n, although less unequivocal. Acoustic turbidity is the most frequently type 

of evidence, and is observed in the first couple of meters of the Holocene 

sedimentary cover. Absence of reflections possible due to a homogenous 

sedimentary section and lack of signal penetration did not allow the identification 

of significant acoustic blanking, and no other strong type of evidence of gas was 

observed associated with the acoustic turbidity (Fig. V-18). The potential gas 

accumulations occur in a couple of patches with total area of 26,120m2 (covering 

14% of the total seismic coverage area of the Cidade channel).

rally controlled fluid migration pathways in the Mesozoic bedrock (see Figs 

V-11, V12, V-16 and V-17). The general structural pattern in the Terminal Sul area 

follows the trend of the Ria of Aveiro of gently dipping Mesozoic marls and clays 

(10-20ºW,4-6ºESE) covered by soft Holocene lagoon sediments. However, the 

Mesozoic bedrock in the Terminal Sul area appears to constitute a structural high, 

bordered by NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW normal faults (Figs. V-19, V-20 and V-21). 

The west dipping NNW-SSE normal fault is inferred at depth from a drape fold of 

the outcropping Cretaceous bedrock, and from the possible intra-Cretaceous 

unconformity on the hanging wall (Fig. V-20). The east dipping NNE-SSW normal

red, c and d – profile without and with interpretation). The disturbed layers are cut by 
predominantly sub-vertical faults with local evidence of shortening, suggesting that these are shear 
zones (possibly right lateral strike-slips – map view in inset b). The limited expression of the 
intense strain may result from hydraulic fracture processes caused by fluid flow through the higher 
permeability shear zones. The irregular Holocene reflectors observed above some shear zones 
may be a result of escaping fluids.

the active/recent pockmark as well as the buried pockmarks (Figs. V-11, V-12, V-

20 and V-21). A small wavelength, gentle fold appears to affect the drape fold 

suggesting that it is a ductile bead (a zone of ductile deformation near fault tips; for 

a discussion see Hossack, 1983) of a right lateral strike-slip WNW-ESE shear 

zone (fold axis is gently undulating along the 98º azimuth) that post-dates the 

NNE-SSW normal faulting (see Figs V-21).

There is a clear spatial association between the gas fields in the Terminal

Sul (TS-WGF and TS-EGF) and the hanging walls of the main normal faults; also 

the pockmark evidence is also spatially associated with vertical fault zones in the 

oic bedrock (see Figs. V-20 and V-22). These clear spatial relations 

between fluid evidence and fault structures strongly suggest that the faults in the 

Mesozoic bedrock constitute preferential fluid migration pathways.  

The disrupted horizons of the Mesozoic bedrock in the Cidade channel 

underlie gas accumulations in trapped in the Holocene sediments. The Mesozoic 

structure in this area follows the westerly gently dipping monocline

ent folding observed in the profiles appears to be a result of the intersection 

of an arcuate trackline with the west dipping monocline). The localized strain 

shown by the disrupted horizons materialize shear zones of flower structure 

patterns with general WNW-ESE trends (68ºW) suggestive of transpressive 

deformation (both shortening and strike-slip). Considering the hypothesis that the 

gas accumulated in the Holocene sediments has escaped through the disrupted 

Mesozoic horizons, then fluid escape in the Cidade channel is controlled by these 

WNW-ESE fractures of the Mesozoic (see Fig. V-22). The gas composition found 

until now in the Ria of Aveiro consists mainly of methane and, therefore appears to 

be of biogenic origin. The interpretation proposed here raises the possibility of also 

a potential deeper source for the gas. 

Stratigraphic and geometrical evidence of the relative chronology and 

kynematics of the structures observed in the study areas is incomplete and, until 

further evidence is found, an explana

 be based on the proposed Meso-Cenozoic regional geodynamical evolution 

of the Western Iberian Margin. In this sense, the observed deformation can be 

explained by the roughly E-W extension related to the late Cretaceous Atlantic 

rifting, and by the NW-SE convergence of the Eurasia and Africa plates during the 

Miocene (for an overview of post-Jurassic tectonics in Iberia see Wilson et al., 

1989; Ribeiro et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990; Rasmussen et al., 1998; 

Andeweg, 2001; Alves et al., 2003). 

The strain accommodated by the NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW normal faults 

probably occurred during the late Cretaceous extension. During the Miocene

inversion, these faults were probably reactivated with oblique movements with 

predominance for left lateral strike-slip component. The 68-82ºW and 15-24ºW 

vertical faults may constitute conjugate fault family pairs with a tight angle of 44-

67º and a corresponding compression direction roughly on 45ºW, compatible with 

the Miocene NW-SE convergence. In this setting, the 68-82ºW fault set would 

have had right lateral strike-slip movement and the 15-24ºW fault family left lateral 

strike-slip movement.  

 

5.4.4. Tidal altitude and the amplitude of the bottom 
reflection 
 

One of the initial purposes of the pseudo-3D Chirp coverage was to study 

and map amplitude variations of reference horizons. The map of raw amplitudes 

(unprocessed data) extracted from the bottom reflection of the Chirp profiles 

revealed a systematic pattern of higher amplitudes in the profiles acquired at lower 

tides (mainly E-W profiles) when compared with the amplitudes from profiles 

acquired at higher tides (mainly N-S lines, see Fig. V-23).

geological interpretation of maps of reflection amplitudes. Possible explanations for this pattern
were sound energy loss and attenuation related to differences in two way time to first break and/or
the abundance/size of gas bubbles in the sediments.

Attempts to balance amplitudes between the various profiles were 

unsuccessful and the evidence of a possible effect of tidal height on the gas 

evidence (see Fig. V-10) led to the test of the hypothesis that the changes in 

bottom amplitudes were in part related to gas bubbling during falling tides. The 

data used for this specific purpose was the bottom amplitudes measured in the 

Chirp profiles in the Terminal Sul and the Cidade Channel areas. 

The analysis of the first break two-way times (TWT) versus amplitudes 

scatter plots shows that the Terminal Sul data is strongly clustered towards low 

TWT and high amplitude values, whereas the Cidade Channel data has no

altitudes (e.g. from 2.5m decreasing to 1.5m altitude in the northern end of the

altitudes (e.g. from 1.5 m decreasing to 1m and increasing to 1.5m altitude in the 

northern end of the cidade channel) and; Class 4 flood – corresponds to the 

increasing quarter of tidal altitudes (e.g. from 1.5m increasing to 2.5m altitude in 

the northern end of the cidade channel). 

The box plots of the first break TWT at each tidal stage (Fig. V-25) show 

that the TWT coverage for the various tidal stages in the Terminal Sul is 

heterogenous with smaller TWT ranges during low tide and flood (75% of the 

samples between 5 and 7ms) when compared with the TWT ranges during high

The residual first break amplitudes were determined from the least squares 

linear regression lines determined previously. The histogram of the residual 

amplitudes of the Terminal Sul is skewed with marginally positive amplitudes more 

frequent and a long tail of negative amplitudes (Fig. V-26). This indicates that the 

linear regression is a poor model for the observed time and amplitude samples 

and is in sharp contrast with the bell curve shaped histogram of the Cidade 

channel (Fig. V-26).

during cruises RIAV02 and RIAV02A, in the Terminal Sul and Cidade channel areas.  Amplitudes 
for the Terminal Sul are concentrated towards the upper end of the systems recording range 
(positive half of the 16 bits integer – 32767) indicating that many may have been clipped due to 
excessive gain during acquisition. Overall, amplitude values in the Terminal Sul are smaller during 
high tide with minima during ebb. Amplitudes for the Cidade channel are broadly spread over the 
recording range, with higher values during ebb and low tide, and lower values during flood with 
minima during high tide.  
 

The relationship between the residual amplitudes determined from the least 

squares regression line and each tidal stage was analyzed to see if changes in 

tidal stage could explain part of the dispersion of the amplitude versus TWT 

scatter plots (Fig. V-28). The residual amplitudes for the Terminal Sul are mostly 

within -2000 and +2000 (75% of the data). Interpretation of this plot is probably 

meaningless due to the suspected sampling problems described before (poor 

spatial coverage for each tidal stage, poor linear regression model and amplitude 

clipping during acquisition) but is shown for reference. The Cidade Channel 

residual amplitudes have different biases for each tidal stage, with greater than 

predicted amplitudes during low tide with maxima during ebb; residual amplitudes 

during flood are evenly distributed around 0; the lowest residual amplitudes occur 

mostly during high tide. 

The analysis of the first break amplitudes of the Chirp data shows that the 

Terminal Sul area data has sampling problems that prevent a comparative 

is of the amplitude data. Nevertheless, the Cidade Channel data shows an analys

inverse linear relationship between amplitude and two way time which can be 

explained by sound energy reduction processes related to sound wave spherical 

divergence and energy attenuation in the water column. The residual amplitudes 

determined from the linear regression show different biases for each tidal stage.

the various tidal stages in the Terminal Sul, and because of the linear regression was found to be a 
poor model of the sampled data. Residual amplitudes for the Cidade channel vary have different 
biases according to the tidal stage, with greater than predicted amplitudes during low tide with 
maxima during ebb; residual amplitudes during flood are evenly distributed around 0; the lowest 
residual amplitudes occur mostly during high tide.  
 

 

This means that a tide related phenomenon is affecting the recorded amplitudes 

independently of the distance of the seismic source to the reflector. Considering 

the widespread evidence of gas in the Ria of Aveiro, the stronger than expected 

amplitudes during low tide with maxima during ebb may be explained by gas 

ebullition and/or gas bubble size changes triggered by falling pressure with falling 

tide (Best et al., 2004). 

 The methane gas bubbles obs

” pier of the Ria de Aveiro, outside the study areas, showed a similar pattern 

with tidal altitude to the one between amplitude strengths and tidal altitude. The 

gas bubbling started with falling tide and petered down as the tide turned and rose. 

This independent observation supports the hypothesis that bubbling and gas 

escape in the Ria de Aveiro is triggered mainly by falling tide and that its effect is 

detected pervasively by the chirp system.

5.5. Discussion and conclusions 
 

Evidence of gas in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel covers 

respectively, 28% and 31% of the total seismic coverage area, a value that, for the 

Terminal Sul, may reach 55% if the possible evidence for gas in the Mesozoic 

bedrock is added. The evidence occurs at a wide range of depths below the water 

surface, from 3m downw to 15m. The distribution and extent of seismic evidence 

of gas in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors, as well as, the increase in 

relative extent and depth range of gas accumulations when compared to the 14% 

area and 4m depth of the gas accumulations in the Espinheiro Channel sector, 

ave methodological and natural explanations. 

The analysis of the data from the Espinheiro Channel (Chapter IV, Duarte 

hannel and Terminal Sul sectors. The 

loser proximity of the water bottom multiple in the shallower Espinheiro Channel 

hortens the window of observation of the seismic profiles and limits the ability to

et al., 2007) showed that the use of seismic evidence to map gas accumulations 

tends to underestimate the areas of accumulations because the absence of 

seismic evidence of gas does not necessarily imply its absence. This is particularly 

important when comparing the gas accumulation areas of the shallower Espinheiro 

Channel sector with the deeper Cidade C

identify diagnostic reflection patterns, thereby underestimating the extent of the 

mapped areas of gas accumulation. Furthermore, the distance between profiles in 

the Espinheiro Channel sector reaches 75m which is three times more than the 

maximum distance between profiles in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel 

sectors. This means that the extent of pockets of gas smaller than 75m is most 

probably underestimated

The problems of the depth of the survey area and the profile separation in 

mapping gas accumulations with seismic methods have implications for the 

assessment of uncertainty of measured gas accumulation areas; these should be 

addressed in subsequent surveys. Mapping gas accumulations in shallow waters 

will probably require a dense groundtruthing sampling for gas in order to clarify the 

expectedly ambiguous seismic evidence of gas in shallow waters. If this 

disambiguation through groundtruthing is

data in shallow water will be limited to exploratory studies, i.e. to making new 

findings of gas accumulations where observation conditions are optimal. The issue 

of vari

constant profile separation. In the 

presen

ting the existence of higher 

perme

able profile separation is a problem of observation scale already discussed 

in Chapter III. The gas accumulations in the Ria of Aveiro have a wide range of 

sizes and shapes probably reflecting the sizes and shapes of the potential gas 

traps, which in a coastal lagoon environment probably include a multitude of 

sediment bodies that fill small tidal channels. Furthermore, it is probably safe to 

assume that the size and extent of these gas traps have fractal properties; as 

discussed before (see Chapter III) this means that the interpretation and 

comparison of maps of seismic evidence of gas accumulations require the use of a 

constant scale of observation, in this case a 

t work, the Terminal Sul sector has the most regular profile separation and, 

therefore, is the sector that provides the best conditions to study the size, 

distribution and controls of the gas accumulations. 

The distribution of the evidence of gas accumulation in the Terminal Sul 

and Cidade Channel sectors has strong spatial correlation with the fracture pattern 

of the Mesozoic bedrock (see Fig V-22). Since the Mesozoic structure appears to 

exert a control on the distribution of gas, this implies the existence of a fluid source 

in the Mesozoic bedrock. The corresponding fluid my be either rich in methane gas 

or have chemical properties that promote methanogenesis in the Holocene 

sediments. The study of the Espinheiro Channel sector already raised the 

hypothesis of a deeper source of methane (see chapter IV), and the data from the 

Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel again raises this possibility. The Mesozoic 

bedrock in Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors has a denser fracture pattern 

when compared with the Espinheiro sector, indica

ability pathways for fluid migration. Furthermore, the Terminal Sul sector 

Mesozoic bedrock appears to constitute a structural high that may function as a 

trap for gas migrating from depth (Fig. V-20), which is in agreement with the 

occurrence of focused fluid escape structures such as the observed pockmarks 

(Figs. V-11, V-12 and V-13), as well as with the overall enhanced reflections in the 

Mesozoic bedrock. 

The relationship between the deformation history and fluid flow history is

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

 146 

unclear. The intensity of the strain accommodated by the disrupted horizons in the 

Cidade Channel raises may be in part related to hydraulic fracturing processes. If 

the fluids overpressure conditions necessary for such processes were achieved 

through seismic pumping then fluids may have migrated through the WNW-ESE 

and NNW-SSE faults during the Miocene inversion tectonic episodes. Reports of 

extensive fluid escape in the Ria of Aveiro were recorded in the XVIII century 

during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake (Coelho, 2005; Oliveira, 2005). If these reports 

are true then, tele-seismic effects related to Quaternary tectonics may also be a 

driving mechanism for fluid migration in the Ria of Aveiro. 

The association between the gas escape and accumulation features in 

Holocene lagoon sediments and the Mesozoic bedrock structure is indicative that, 

whether or not tectonic events were responsible for fluid flow, the present fractures 

are probably functioning as permeable pathways for fluid migration from depth to 

the Holocene sediments and out to the Ria of Aveiro and to the atmosphere. This 

means that deeper older accumulations of gas are probably a source of the gas 

accumulating and escaping from the Holocene sediments.  

The existence of gas traps in the Holocene sediments also controls the 

distribution and extent of gas accumulation and escape in the Terminal Sul and 

Cidade Channels, as illustrated by acoustic turbidity in the sedimentary fills of the 

buried pockmarks in the Terminal Sul (Fig. V-13), and the extent of the CC-NGF 

and related gas escape evidence in the Cidade Channel (Fig. V-17). The 

importance of the Holocene sediment architecture in the distribution of gas 

accumulations was also evident in the Espinheiro Channel sector, for the main gas 

fields appear to have been trapped within layers of a prograding sediment wedge 

and within layers of a tidal channel sedimentary fill (see Chapter IV; Duarte et al., 

2007). 

Local changes in gas related seismic features (see Fig. V-10) as well as the 

data on first break amplitudes from the Cidade Channel sector provide very strong 

evidence that tides have an effect on the acoustic response of gas rich sediments. 

This effect will impact the mapped distribution and extent of gas evidence and its 

use to quantify gas volumes. The relative increase in reflections amplitude during 

tidal fall probably reflects changes of methane solubility due to decreasing

pressure; either ebullition as observed in other parts of the lagoon or as observed 

in tidal marshes by other authors (e.g. Jackson et al., 1998), or changes towards 

resonant bubble sizes (Best et al., 2004) cause an increase in gas reflectors 

detected by the seismic systems and influence the interpretation of gas evidence. 

Either way, 4D surveying will be required to determine the impact of this semi-

diurnal control on the extent and distribution of gas.  

There are several other factors that may control the distribution and extent 

of the gas accumulation and escape in the study areas, for which the available 

data is insufficient to assess its importance. The organic rich Holocene sediments 

are pro

bably a modern source of biogenic methane gas and bio-geochemical data 

is required to study the methane production. In fact, primary biological production, 

a pre-requisite for biogenic methane production, is very high in coastal 

environments like the Ria of Aveiro (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and 

Middelburg, 2000) and primary biological production and geochemical conditions 

of the Holocene organic rich sediments influence methane gas production, 

accumulation and escape patterns; factors such as season

tion, water salinity, depth of oxygen reduction within the sediments, etc, all 

will affect the location and extent of methane gas production (Hagen and Vogt, 

1999). 

Anthropogenic activity may also affect the distribution and extent of gas. 

The Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors in particular, are places of intense 

human activity with heavy construction, freight ship traffic, fishing and dredging. 

These activities change the water and sediment chemistry, the morphology of the 

channels, as well as strongly influence the hydrodynamics of the lagoon. 

In summary, the seismic evidence of gas covers approximately one third of 

surveye

y, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, pockmarks and buried trough 

pockmarks, disrupted horizons and acoustic plumes in the water column (flares). 

The tidal altitude variations impact the detection of gas with seismic methods. 

Reflection amplitudes in gas-prone areas are clearly stronger during low tide with 

maxima during ebb, decreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this 

pattern confirms that ebullition and gas escape is triggered mainly by the decrease

of pressure (hydraulic load) that occurs during the falling tide. The location and 

geometry of fluid the escape features follows the fracture pattern that affects the 

Mesozoic bedrock, indicating that these fractures are preferential pathways for 

fluid migration and exert a structural control on the gas occurrences in the Ria of 

Aveiro. This structural control raises the hypothesis of the existence of a deep 

source of methane, possibly thermogenic, in or below the Mesozoic bedrock.

Chapter 6. Conclusions and future work 
 

The subject of this thesis was the investigation of gas accumulation and 

seepage in the Ria of Aveiro barrier-lagoon using high resolution seismic reflection 

methods. The main problems addressed ranged from practical aspects of 

observation and data acquisition to questions related to the study of natural 

processes. The three main questions that were addressed were: 

1. What are the best procedures to acquire and process seismic reflection 

data in a shallow barrier-lagoon environment? 

2. What are the types of seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage 

in the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro and what is the appropriate way to 

map them? 

3. What are the geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage in the 

tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro? 

This final chapter presents a summary of the results obtained when trying to 

answer these questions, discusses the main issues that arose from this 

investigation and proposes guidelines for future work in the study of gas 

generation and flow in the Ria of Aveiro, also applicable to other similar coastal 

environments. 

 

6.1. Acquisition and processing of high resolution 
seismic reflection data in a shallow water environments 

 

High resolution seismic reflection methods present significant advantages 

for the investigation of the sub-surface geology in shallow barrier-lagoon 

environments. The ability to survey the water column and sub-surface geology, 

both in time and space, over extensive areas of difficult access, provided the 

opportunity to make several new discoveries in the Ria of Aveiro, and illustrates 

the value of the use of seismic reflection in such an environment. 

 149



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

Nevertheless, seismic reflection systems have some limitations when 

applied in coastal environments. The ship traffic, tides, channel morphology and 

shallow bathymetry affects the deployment and operation of the seismic systems 

as well as restricts the extent of the profile coverage. The heterogeneity of the 

seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and resolution all constrain the use of 

the data to mostly local but detailed interpretations and modeling of the geological 

objects. 

Considering all these constraints, control of the acquisition geometry of the 

seismic systems and navigation systems and reliable information of tidal altitude 

variations during acquisition are of paramount importance. It was shown here that, 

when acquiring seismic data in an environment such as the Ria of Aveiro, changes 

in the system geometry parameters that may be safely disregarded in surveys of 

much larger scope (i.e. significantly greater profile separation) have to be well 

controlled. Changes of few meters in acquisition geometry such as the depth or 

the layback of the towed equipment, have significant impact on the accuracy and 

consistency of the interpretation of geological features (e.g. fault plane 

morphology, see chapter III). Also of significant importance for data positioning is 

the synchronization of the seismic acquisition and navigation systems. Trace 

positioning estimates depend strongly on matching the data timestamps of each 

system and, given acquisition speeds of 4-6 knots, a single second of 

synchronization error results in a 1-2m positioning error. 

The processing flows for the navigation data and the seismic signal 

developed in the scope of this thesis improves and constrains the uncertainties in 

data positioning and interpretability of the seismic features. The case of the Ria of 

Aveiro shows that position estimates obtained through navigation data processing 

resulted in a mean horizon mistie value of 0.75ms, which allowed a confident 

correlation of the interpretation between profiles, without which mapping of the 

seismic evidence of gas would have been very difficult. Furthermore, the quality of 

the trace position estimates of the pseudo 3D Chirp survey in the Terminal Sul 

sector was clearly illustrated by the consistency and detail of the gas evidence, 

horizon isobats and structural maps. These maps allowed the identification of the 

spatial relationships between evidence of gas, sediment architecture and the 

 150

Mesozoic bedrock structure in the Terminal Sul, which was a major objective of 

this thesis. 

The seismic signal processing improves not only signal to noise ratio, but 

also the geometric interpretability of the seismic/geological features. Of particular 

importance are the normal moveout correction and the Stolt F-K migration 

processes. The normal moveout correction of boomer data allows the correct 

correlation of the interpretation between chirp and boomer profiles in very shallow 

domains, such as those found in certain parts of the Espinheiro Channel sector. 

The Stolt F-K Migration has significant impact in collapsing diffraction from point 

diffractors in the Holocene sediments, improving profile interpretability and in 

improving the geometry of channels and deformation structures.  

Concerning the issues of acquisition and processing of the seismic data, it 

should be emphasized here that best processing results are only accomplished 

after strong quality control procedures involving the analysis of the track line 

regularity, horizon misties and first-break surface models, which allows the 

revision and improvement of the processing parameters. 

The main priority regarding future work in acquisition and processing of 

seismic data in shallow coastal environments is related to the most important 

limitation of seismic reflection methods. Models derived solely from geophysical 

methods, methods of indirect observation, require testing through groundtruthing. 

In this work, groundtruthing was mostly provided by available borehole log data, 

critical for the calibration of the seismic stratigraphy, but of no practical use in 

determining if specific reflections were caused by gas in the sediments. In the 

case of the Ria of Aveiro, direct observation of gas escape from the sediments, in 

other locations of the lagoon, provides support for the interpretation of the seismic 

evidence of gas. Nevertheless, future work must take into account that it is 

important that the reflector(s) responsible for the reflection events interpreted as 

gas are identified through groundtruthing at the surveyed locations. Furthermore, 

groundtruthing should be done, if possible, at the time of the seismic surveying in 

order to prevent errors in testing due to the temporal variations in gas generation, 

accumulation and flow. 



Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

As concerns the practical aspects of seismic acquisition and data 

processing, the following improvements will increase the range of usability and 

reliability of seismic surveying in shallow coastal environments such as the Ria of 

Aveiro: 

 

1. Maintain a constant acquisition speed. Considering that this requirement is 

extremely difficult to respect in environments such as the Ria of Aveiro, 

then binning and stacking of the trace data should also be considered in 

order to obtain a constant trace separation; 

 

2. Follow survey plans with regularly spaced, orthogonal profiles, both to 

improve interpretability and to maintain a constant observation scale,  

allowing for the comparison of Euclidian properties of the geological 

features to be mapped; 

 

3. Improve real time synchronization of the clocks of the seismic acquisition 

and navigation systems, either through hardware or software; automate the 

positioning estimate procedure during acquisition in order to allow quality 

control of the data and cut post-processing times; 

 

4. Acquire navigation data exactly above source and receivers, e.g. placing 

GPS antennas over the towed equipment. This will provide accurate 

geometry parameters for navigation and geometry related seismic signal 

processing; 

 

5. Acquire 3D Kinematic GPS data to estimate source and receiver altitudes 

and infer tidal altitude for each trace, thus bypassing the need to measure 

tidal altitudes at control stations and having to resort to tide propagation 

models within the lagoon to estimate tidal altitudes for each trace location. 

 

6. Test and implement predictive deconvolution processing to attenuate first 

break multiples, which are a major obstacle to interpretation in shallow

waters surveying. In the case of chirp data, this would require recording 

data in raw or pre-envelope processing formats; 

 

6.2. Seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage  
 

Seismic evidence of gas accumulations in the Holocene sediments and 

possibly, in the Mesozoic bedrock of the Ria of Aveiro are extensive, covering 14% 

to 55% of the surveyed tidal channels area. Types of seismic evidence for gas 

accumulations in the study area included acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections 

and acoustic blanking. Gas escape through the water column was also detected 

as acoustic flares and, possibly, cloudy turbidity. Of particular interest for such a 

dynamic system as the Ria of Aveiro was the finding of mounds and pockmarks 

that indicated that gas generation and flow in the sediments of the lagoon may 

have played a role in shaping the morphology of the tidal channels. The 

relationships between the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock and the overlying 

lagoon sediments were also clarified by the new seismic data. Also, the high 

resolution and density of the seismic profiles allowed the geometrical 

characterization of a 2km wide, 50m deep graben and of families of fractures that 

appear to exert a structural control on the extent and distribution of gas. 

Furthermore, the high resolution of the Chirp and Boomer systems allowed the 

mapping of the typically small gas accumulations (30 to 150m long), whose size 

probably reflects that of the host sedimentary bodies. 

Searching for seismic evidence of gas in tide-dominated environments such 

as the Ria of Aveiro had unexpected results. Comparison of seismic profiles 

acquired at different tidal altitudes and the statistical analysis of changes of first 

break amplitude strengths with changing tidal altitude, together revealed that the 

seismic records changed significantly during the tidal cycle.Independent 

observation of tidal fall triggered methane ebullition in other locations of the lagoon 

support the hypothesis that gas ebullition is being detected by the seismic systems 

and that, therefore one needs to be careful when using acoustic methods to map 

gas accumulations in tidal dominated environments, because areas with a similar 

amount of methane content in the sediments may produce a different acoustic

response, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle during which they where 

surveyed. 

The impact of tidal fall triggered ebullition on the seismic records can be 

viewed as a constraint on future work, but also as an opportunity. In fact, future 

surveying can be planned to study the diurnal dynamics of gas generation and 

flow in a 4D perspective, through qualitative and quantitative analysis of the 

reflection data. Such data, coupled with bio-geochemical analysis of sediment, 

pore water, and water column samples, would provide the input data necessary to 

model short term generation and flow of methane gas in the Ria of Aveiro and 

similar environments. 

 

6.3. Geological controls on gas accumulation and 
seepage 

 

The geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage in the tidal 

channels of the Ria of Aveiro are shown in the diagrams for each sector shown in 

Fig. VI-1, and are summarized below. 

 

1. The Holocene prograding wedge and the tidal channel fill deposits 

(Espinheiro sector) and Quaternary (Holocene?) sediments of unknown 

nature (Terminal Sul Sector) are probable producers of biogenic gas of the 

Ria of Aveiro. 

2. Gas accumulations occur in the gas producing sediments and beneath what 

appear to be impermeable horizons, such as those occurring in the 

Holocene marine/lagoonal sediments of the Cidade channel and in the 

sediment fills of the buried pockmarks of the Terminal Sul.  

3. Evidence of widespread gas accumulation in the Mesozoic bedrock, 

evidence of fluid escape structures (pockmarks) and gas accumulations on 

the hanging walls of the major extensional faults that bound the structural 

high of the Mesozoic bedrock in the Terminal Sul, all suggest that structural 

highs in the bedrock also constitute traps for gas migrating from depth.

Gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro 
 
 

4. The accumulation and seepage of gas in the sediments affects the 

morphology of the tidal channels in the form of pockmarks (70x40x2m, 

Terminal Sul sector) and gas domes (40x20x2m, Espinheiro sector). 

 

5. The dynamics of gas flow and escape from the sediments is controlled by 

the tidal cycle, with falling tides causing ebullition. Focused fluid seepage 

occurs in the form of gas escaping from accumulations in the sediments, 

building bubble trains that rise through the water column (evident in every 

studied sector of the lagoon). 

 

6.4. Future work 
 

The present work provides strong evidence on the occurrence and controls 

on gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro. Given the exploratory 

nature of much of the research done, several key issues such as the seasonality 

of gas generation and seepage or the methane flow rates to the atmosphere could 

not be tackled and must be addressed in the future, in order to create a 

comprehensive model on gas generation and flow. 

Considering that gas accumulations are extensive in the Ria of Aveiro, that 

gas escapes to the water column and the atmosphere, and that gas generation 

and flow affects morphology of the tidal channel floor, it is clear that the Ria of 

Aveiro is an excellent natural laboratory to study gas generation and flow in 

coastal sediments. Future work should emphasize two main questions, the first 

related to energy and climate issues, and the second related to geomorphology 

dynamics. 

 

1. How much of the gas generated in the lagoon escapes to the water column 

and atmosphere? Conversely, how much of the gas generated in the 

lagoon remains trapped in the sediments?  

 

The answer to this question will provide valuable information on the 

extrinsic and intrinsic factors that determine the capacity of a coastal system to 

 156 



Conclusions and future work 
 
 

 157

trap or lose the methane generated in the sediments. Such knowledge will provide 

energy exploration guidelines to find gas trapping coastal systems (modern and 

past), as well as inform climate models on the relative importance of coastal 

systems as a source of atmospheric methane.  

 

2. Does fluid escape from the sediments exert a control on location and 

morphology of tidal channels? More specifically for the case of the Ria of 

Aveiro, is fluid escape the process through which the bedrock structure 

(faults and other permeable fluid migration pathways), buried beneath 

several meters of Holocene sediments, exerts a control on the location and 

morphology of the channels that mimic bedrock fault trends? 

 

Modern drainage basins frequently show patterns that mimic deep seated 

structures without any apparent cause. The evidence of morphology shaping due 

to gas generation and flow in the Ria of Aveiro, a very dynamic system, provides 

an explanatory hypothesis for a mechanism of morphology control by deep 

structure: fluid escape from the sediments is capable of influencing erosion-

transport-deposition patterns, thus shaping morphology.

APPENDIX 
 

Other seismic evidence of gas 
 
 

This appendix presents seismic evidence of gas that, for various reasons, 

was not presented in the main text of the thesis. It serves mainly to complement 

the figures of Chapter IV, which were limited in number because of the constraints 

of the chapters’ publication in a scientific journal. It also serves to document 

evidence of gas in other surveyed sectors of the lagoon that were not investigated 

in detail due to the sparse seismic coverage.
