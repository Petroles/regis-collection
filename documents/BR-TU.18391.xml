resumo 
 
 

As bactérias desempenham um papel chave na reciclagem de energia e 
matéria nas teias tróficas aquáticas. No entanto, as suas pequenas dimensões, 
curto tempo de geração e o facto de os seus genomas constituírem uma 
grande porção do seu volume celular, tornam as bactérias mais suscetíveis às 
alterações ambientais que os organismos superiores. O aumento dos níveis de 
radiação UVB (280-320 nm) constitui uma ameaça particularmente importante 
para as comunidades bacterianas dos sistemas aquáticos, uma vez que a 
radiação consegue penetrar até profundidades consideráveis. No entanto, os 
mecanismos através dos quais a radiação causa danos nas bactérias ainda 
não são claros, o que impede a modelação precisa dos efeitos da radiação UV 
nas comunidades bacterianas naturais. O bacterioneuston habita a 
microcamada superficial (primeiro milímetro da coluna de água), estando 
naturalmente exposto a níveis de radiação UV superiores aos que o 
bacterioplâncton está exposto. Deste modo, a microcamada superficial pode 
ser vista como um nicho ecológico modelo para estudar as interações entre as 
bactérias e a radiação UV.  

Os objetivos deste trabalho foram (i) avaliar a influência do nível de exposição 
natural à radiação das comunidades bacterianas na sua sensibilidade à 
radiação UV, através da comparação das respostas fotobiológicas do 
bacterioneuston e bacterioplâncton; (ii) aprofundar o conhecimento acerca dos 
mecanismos através dos quais a radiação UV causa danos, bem como dos 
fatores que afetam a interação entre a radiação UV e as bactérias; e (iii) avaliar 
o potencial da proteína RecA, que medeia a resposta SOS das bactérias, para 
ser usada como marcador de danos induzidos por UV nas comunidades 
bacterianas. 

Verificou-se que o bacterioneuston é mais resistente à radiação UVB que o 
bacterioplâncton e recupera de modo mais eficiente dos danos induzidos por 
UV, particularmente em condições de escassez de nutrientes, indicando assim 
que o nível de exposição natural das comunidades bacterianas à radiação 
afeta a sua sensibilidade à radiação UV. Os resultados das análises 
independentes do cultivo revelaram o potencial da radiação UV para afetar a 
estrutura das comunidades bacterianas ao selecionar bactérias resistentes. A 
análise do perfil de utilização de fontes de carbono usando o sistema de 
Ecoplacas Biolog ® e a determinação das taxas de incorporação de leucina e 
timidina permitiu também verificar que a radiação UV modifica o funcionamento 
das comunidades bacterianas. Os resultados obtidos indicam a possibilidade 
do bacterioneuston conter um conjunto de estirpes resistentes a UV que, 
mediante as condições meteorológicas apropriadas, podem ser selecionadas 
aquando da exposição à radiação.

 A determinação dos efeitos da radiação UV de diferentes comprimentos de 
onda na abundância e atividade bacterianas, bem como nos níveis de vários 
marcadores de stress oxidativo (produção de ROS, quebra de cadeias do 
DNA, peroxidação lipídica e carbonilação proteica), permitiu verificar que a 
sobrevivência aquando da exposição à radiação UVA (320-400 nm), UVB e 
UVC (100-280 nm) é determinada pela extensão dos danos ao nível do DNA, 
oxidação lipídica e níveis intracelulares de ROS, respetivamente. 
Adicionalmente, estudos de espetroscopia do infravermelho revelaram uma 
variedade de modificações oxidativas, composicionais e estruturais nos lípidos 
e proteínas das bactérias com a irradiação. 

Usando diferentes antioxidantes, verificou-se que o oxigénio singleto 
desempenha um papel crucial na inativação das bactérias durante a exposição 
à radiação UVB, potencialmente devido à sua participação na oxidação 
lipídica. Verificou-se também que a adição de metais, particularmente ferro, 
cobre e manganês, acentua a inativação das bactérias durante a exposição à 
radiação UVB, o que sugere que a homeostasia dos níveis de metais na célula 
durante a irradiação é crucial para atenuar os efeitos nocivos dos ROS. 
Experiências conduzidas com estirpes bacterianas incubadas a diferentes 
temperaturas (15 ºC e 25 ºC), em diferentes fases de crescimento (fase 
exponencial e estacionária) e diferentes meios de cultura (rico e pobre em 
nutrientes) revelaram que as condições de crescimento são determinantes 
cruciais da extensão dos danos oxidativos induzidos pela exposição à radiação 
UVB nas bactérias. Verificou-se também que o ambiente abiótico (conteúdo 
em nutrientes e qualidade do meio de suspensão) das comunidades 
bacterianas influencia a sua sensibilidade à radiação UVB. 

O estudo da filogenia da proteína RecA revelou grande coerência com a 
filogenia do gene 16S rRNA, demonstrando uma elevada conservação da 
proteína, e não qualquer adaptação particular à resistência ao stress. Vários 
plasmídeos contendo homólogos do gene recA ainda não descritos na 
literatura foram identificados e a análise do contexto genómico revelou a 
possibilidade dos genes recA presentes nos plasmídeos poderem 
complementar os genes recA cromossomais na resposta SOS. 

No seu conjunto, os resultados obtidos neste trabalho fornecem novas 
perspetivas acerca da fotobiologia ambiental das comunidades bacterianas. 
Novas informações acerca dos mecanismos e fatores que influenciam os 
efeitos inibitórios da radiação UV nas bactérias foram também obtidas. Esta 
informação poderá ajudar a uma melhor compreensão da interação entre as 
bactérias e radiação UV no contexto das alterações globais, bem como o 
desenvolvimento de tecnologias de desinfeção baseadas em UV mais 
eficientes.

abstract 
 

Bacteria play a key role in the cycling of energy and matter in aquatic food 
webs. However, their small size, short generation time and the fact that their 
genomes make up a large portion of their cellular volume, make bacteria more 
susceptible to environmental changes than higher organisms. Increased UVB 
radiation (280-320 nm) levels pose a particularly important threat to bacterial 
communities in aquatic systems, due to the ability of radiation to penetrate to 
considerable depths. However, the mechanisms of UV-induced damage to 
bacteria are still not clear, preventing the accurate modelling of the effects of 
UV radiation on natural bacterial communities. Located at the sunlit surface 
microlayer (SML, top millimetre of the water column), bacterioneuston is 
naturally exposed to higher levels of UV radiation than the bacterioplankton 
bellow. Therefore, the SML can be viewed as a model ecological niche to study 
the interaction between bacteria and UV radiation. 

The objectives of this work were (i) to study the influence of the light history of 
bacterial communities in their UV sensitivity, by comparing the photobiological 
responses of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton; (ii) to gain further insights 
into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage, as well as the factors that affect 
the interaction between UV radiation and bacteria; and (iii) to assess the 
potential role of the SOS response mediator RecA protein as a marker of UV-
induced damage in bacteria.  

Bacterioneuston was found to be more resistant to UVB radiation than 
bacterioplankton and to recover more efficiently from UV-induced damage, 
particularly under nutrient depleted conditions, thus indicating that the light 
history of bacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity. Results from 
culture-independent analysis suggest that UV radiation can affect bacterial 
community structure by selecting for UV-resistant bacteria. UV radiation was 
also found to modify the functioning of bacterial communities, as indicated by 
sole-carbon-source use profiling with Biolog EcoPlatesTM, as well as leucine 
and thymidine incorporation measurements. The results obtained indicate the 
possibility that bacterioneuston may contain a pool of UV resistant strains that, 
under appropriate meteorological conditions, may be selected for upon UV 
exposure.  

By measuring the effects of UV radiation of different wavelengths in bacterial 
abundance, activity, as well as several oxidative stress markers (ROS 
generation, DNA strand breakage, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation), 
survival under UVA (320-400 nm), UVB and UVC (100-280 nm) wavelengths 
was found to be best explained by the extent of DNA damage, oxidative 
damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, respectively.

 Additionally, mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed an array of oxidative, 
compositional and structural modifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria 
following irradiation. 

Singlet oxygen was found to play a pivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation, 
potentially due to its effects in lipid peroxidation, as revealed by using specific 
ROS scavengers. Metal amendment, particularly with iron, copper and 
manganese, was found to enhance bacterial inactivation during UVB exposure, 
thus suggesting that metal homeostasis during irradiation is crucial to attenuate 
the detrimental effects of ROS. Experiments with bacterial strains grown at 
different temperatures (15 ºC and 25 ºC), growth phases (exponential and 
stationary) and growth media (nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor) revealed that 
growth conditions preceding irradiation are pivotal in determining the extent of 
the oxidative damage induced by UVB exposure. The abiotic environment 
(nutrient content and quality of the suspension medium) of bacterial 
communities was also found to influence their UVB sensitivity. 

The study of the phylogeny of the RecA protein revealed high coherence with 
that of the 16S rRNA gene, reflecting high evolutionary conservation of the 
protein, rather than particular adaptations to stress resistance. Several 
plasmids containing recA homologs not yet reported in the literature were 
identified, and gene context analysis suggested that plasmid-encoded recA 
genes could complement the activity of chromosome-encoded recA genes in 
the bacterial SOS response. 

Taken together, the results obtained in the present work provide new insights 
into the environmental photobiology of bacterial communities. New information 
regarding the mechanisms and factors influencing the inhibitory effects of UV 
radiation on bacteria was also acquired. This information may contribute for a 
better understanding of the interaction between UV radiation and bacteria in the 
context of environmental changes, as well as the development of more efficient 
UV-based disinfection technologies.

Thesis Outline 

Microorganisms are highly responsive to environmental changes since their large 

surface-to-volume ratio facilitates close contact with the surrounding environment. 

Furthermore, due to their relatively short generation times, microbial communities are 

among the fastest components of an ecosystem to respond to environmental changes. 

UV radiation, in particular, can be highly detrimental for microorganisms inhabiting 

aquatic systems, since UV radiation can penetrate to considerable depths.  

The surface microlayer (SML) represents the top millimetre of the water column. 

Due to its location and exposure to high levels of UV radiation (UVR), the SML could 

be viewed as an interesting niche to investigate the interaction between UV radiation 

and bacteria that could provide valuable predictive information on how bacterial 

communities respond to enhanced levels of UV radiation, in terms of function and 

structure. However, information on the comparative responses of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton to UV radiation are still scarce in the literature. Likewise, information 

on the mechanisms that are initiated at the cellular level upon exposure to UV radiation, 

particularly the more biologically relevant UVB (280-320 nm), in different bacteria is 

also absent from the literature, preventing a thorough understanding of the 

consequences of UV radiation to natural bacterial communities, as well as the 

development of more efficient UV-based disinfection technologies. This work aimed to 

address this lack of information.  

In Chapter 1 a brief contextualization of the known mechanisms of UV-induced 

cellular damage and protection/repair, the role of UVR as a driver of the functioning 

and structure of bacterial communities and the relevance of bacterioneuston in 

environmental photobiology studies is presented.  

Chapter 2 addresses the comparative effects of UVB radiation on the structure and 

function of bacterioneuston inhabiting the SML and bacterioplankton inhabiting 

underlying waters (UW). The results revealed that bacterial abundance and DNA 

synthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton, while protein synthesis was more 

inhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB exposure led to a reduction in ribotype diversity, 

demonstrating the potential of UVR to affect community structure, probably by 

selecting UV-resistant bacteria most notably belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, 

particularly abundant in bacterioneuston. These observations raise the hypothesis that 



Thesis Outline 

12 

bacterioneuston may contain a pool of UV-resistant strains that are selected for upon 

UV exposure.  

The comparative analysis of the UV responses of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton is extended in Chapters 3 and 4 which describe the isolation of UVB-

resistant bacterial strains from both communities that were then tested for their 

individual UVB sensitivity. Bacterial numbers were more reduced by UVB in 

bacterioplankton, while leucine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioneuston. 

UVB irradiation was accompanied by a shift in sole-carbon source use profiles, assessed 

with Biolog EcoPlatesTM, characterized by a reduction in consumption of amines and 

amino acids and increased use of polymers, particularly in bacterioneuston isolates. 

Recovery from UV-induced damage under starvation was generally enhanced compared 

to nourished conditions, especially in bacterioneuston isolates.  

Chapter 5 describes the study of the wavelength dependence of UV-induced 

cellular damage in a set of bacterial isolates, used as tentative biological models. 

Biological effects (survival and activity) and molecular markers of oxidative stress 

(DNA strand breakage, generation of reactive oxygen species [ROS], oxidative damage 

to proteins and lipids, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and 

superoxide dismutase) were quantified and statistically analyzed in order to identify the 

main determinants of cell inactivation under the different wavelengths. The reduction in 

survival and activity was stronger for shorter wavelengths, as expected. DNA damage 

followed the same pattern. The generation of ROS, as well as protein and lipid 

oxidation, showed the inverse trend. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that 

survival under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths was best explained by DNA damage, 

oxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, respectively. The wavelength 

dependence of biomolecule damage was further investigated by mid-infrared 

spectroscopy analysis of the effects of irradiation on the proteins and lipids of two 

representative bacterial isolates in Chapters 6. Mid-infrared spectroscopy was proven 

to be an excellent tool to study changes in bacterial components upon UV exposure, 

revealing an array of modifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria following 

irradiation and providing critical clues to drive future studies concerning the 

mechanisms involved in the inactivation of bacteria by UV irradiation. 

In Chapter 7, the investigation of the identity and targets of ROS produced during 

UVB exposure in a set of isolates displaying different UV susceptibilities is addressed. 

For that, specific exogenous ROS scavengers (catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase 



Thesis Outline 

13 

[SOD], sodium azide and mannitol) were used. Biological effects were assessed from 

colony counts and heterotrophic activity (glucose uptake and respiration). DNA strand 

breakage, ROS generation and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids were used as 

markers of oxidative stress. Sodium azide conferred a statistically significant protection 

in terms of survival and lipid oxidation, suggesting that singlet oxygen might play a 

pivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation. Mannitol exerted a significant protection 

against DNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation, assigning hydroxyl radicals to 

DNA and protein damage. The addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly 

protected the capacity of the cells for glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that 

impairment of metabolic activity during UVB exposure has a contribution of superoxide 

and hydrogen peroxide.  

Chapter 8 reports the investigation of the role of transition metals (cobalt, copper, 

iron, manganese, zinc) in UVB-induced damage to bacterial isolates. In general, UVB 

irradiation of metal-amended cell suspensions, particularly those with iron, copper and 

manganese, contributed synergistically to enhance bacterial inactivation. Amendment 

with iron exacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and oxidative damage to lipids 

during irradiation. Additionally, lipid damage during UVB exposure was also enhanced 

after incubation with copper and cobalt. Despite attenuating the formation of protein 

carbonyls during irradiation, manganese decreased survival during irradiation. The 

results indicate that iron, copper, cobalt and manganese play a role in UVB-induced 

inactivation and that metal homeostasis may be crucial in limiting oxidative stress 

during UVB exposure. 

Chapter 9 analyzes the influence of nutrients and water properties in the UVB-

sensitivity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, as well as in a set of representative 

bacterial strains. UVB-induced inhibition was generally attenuated upon inoculation in 

high nutrient medium, compared to unamended conditions. Under low nutrient 

conditions, bacterioneuston was less affected by UVB exposure than bacterioplankton 

in marine samples. For brackish water samples, nutrient conditions did not substantially 

affect inactivation, but a high nutrient concentration attenuated the reduction in activity. 

Resuspension in natural surface or subsurface estuarine water attenuated inactivation 

during irradiation, compared to suspensions prepared in an artificial mineral solution. 

These results indicate that the biological consequences of UV exposure are influenced 

by the composition of the suspension medium. Accordingly, the abiotic environment of 



Thesis Outline 

14 

the surface microlayer and underlying water potentially influences the UV sensitivity of 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, respectively. 

Chapter 10 describes the influence of growth conditions, in particular, growth 

phase (mid-exponential, late-exponential and stationary), growth temperature (15 ºC and 

25 ºC) and growth medium (nutrient-rich TSB and nutrient-poor M9) in UVB-induced 

cellular damage in a representative bacterial strain. In general, oxidative damage did not 

follow a linear dose-dependent variation, suggesting a dynamic interaction between 

damage induction and repair, particularly at high UVB doses, and/or saturation of 

oxidative damage. Stationary phase cells usually survived better and showed lower 

levels of oxidative damage than exponential phase cells. Oxidative damage, most 

notably in mid-exponential phase cells, was generally higher at 25 ºC than at 15 ºC, 

suggesting that ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with the cellular targets is 

temperature-dependent. Survival during UVB exposure was generally higher when cells 

were grown in nutrient-rich media, than under nutrient-deprived conditions. Growth 

conditions might influence bacterial UVB sensitivity by affecting the temporal 

progression and magnitude of biomolecule damage. 

Chapter 11 examines the diversity of RecA proteins among completely sequenced 

bacterial genomes and the reliability of the recA gene as a molecular marker. The 

presence of multiple RecA copies in sequenced genomes and the frequency of plasmid-

encoded recA genes were also examined. Phylogenetic analysis of the RecA protein 

revealed, in general, support for the phyla defined by 16S rRNA gene analysis. recA 

gene trees of Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were in general agreement with 16S 

rRNA trees, but were more divergent in Gammaproteobacteria. Duplication of the recA 

gene was found to be a widespread feature in myxobacteria and frequent among 

Firmicutes. Sequence analysis revealed that the extra recA copy could, in some cases, 

have resulted from an endogenous duplication event. In other cases, divergence of the 

G+C content of the recA gene and the genome raises the possibility of horizontal 

transfer of the additional gene. The presence of recA homologs in plasmids and, in some 

cases, the presence of transposases in the vicinity of recA genes could support the 

possibility of plasmid-mediated mobility of the recA gene. Gene context analysis 

suggested that these plasmid-encoded recA genes could complement the activity of the 

chromosomal recA in the bacterial SOS response. 

Chapter 12 briefly discusses the main results of this work in an integrated 

perspective. Chapter 13 is a general conclusion of the thesis.

CHAPTER 1 

Introduction 

UV radiation 

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (100-400 nm) corresponds to the region of the 

electromagnetic spectrum located between visible light and X-rays (Iqbal, 1983) and, as 

a natural component of sunlight, it is part of the environment in which life evolved and 

to which it adapted. UV radiation has been proposed to be involved in the evolution of 

DNA base composition and sequence (Lesk, 1973; Boulikas, 1992), the ecology, 

biochemistry and evolution of the first life forms (Sagan, 1973) and the pattern of early 

evolution (Walker et al., 1976). The importance of solar UV radiation as an 

evolutionary driving force is reflected by the development of several protection 

mechanisms against the deleterious biological effects of UV radiation, including several 

partly redundant enzymatic pathways for the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, very 

early in evolution (DiRuggiero and Robb, 2004). The genotoxic effects of solar UV 

radiation are thought to have precluded the development of terrestrial life for two or 

three billion years, before the stratospheric ozone layer was formed. 

The use of sunlight by cells was an achievement of utmost importance for life on 

Earth. The Sun not only provided an unlimited source of energy and assured a 

dependable supply of food but also drastically changed the Earth’s atmosphere by 

helping to generate molecular oxygen through photosynthesis which, in turn, had a 

dramatic influence on the abundance and diversity of life forms on Earth (Falkowski, 

2006; Holland, 2006; Payne et al., 2008). The interaction of sunlight with the increasing 

amounts of accumulating oxygen allowed the formation of the ozone molecule and 

subsequently the ozone layer, approximately 2 billion years ago (Canuto et al., 1982). 

The newly formed ozone layer altered the solar spectrum, preventing high energy 

radiation photons (short-wavelength UVC radiation, 100-280 nm) from reaching the 

lower troposphere, where life was developing. Once the ozone layer matured, survival 

was no longer dependent on protection against UV radiation by a layer of water or other 

physical shields. Life became possible on the top of the water column and eventually on 

the surface of the land (Goldblatt et al., 2006). 



Chapter 1

Depletion of the ozone layer 

The first doubts about the effectiveness of the stratospheric ozone layer in 

protecting the Earth’s surface from damaging solar wavelengths raised upon the 

observation of a latitudinal gradient in skin cancer incidence, correlating with UV 

radiation incidence (Urbach, 1969). In 1985, a paper published in Nature surveying the 

variation in total column ozone over the Antarctic for four seasons, unequivocally 

described massive ozone losses during the spring (Farman et al., 1985), an event which 

was latter dubbed as the “ozone hole”. Further analysis of the ozone records retrieved 

from scientific bases in the Antarctic demonstrated a trend for decreasing thickness of 

the ozone layer since the 1970s, progressing at increasing rates (Crutzen, 1970). Ozone 

loss events were later also observed at mid-latitudes and in the Arctic, although not to 

the same extent as over Antarctica (W.M.O., 1988; W.M.O., 1991). The implications of 

massive ozone depletion stimulated the interest in the mechanisms of ozone degradation 

and the biological consequences of increased UV fluxes, particularly UVB (280-320 

nm), the major known outcome of ozone depletion (Nolan and Amanatidis, 1995).  

Molina and Rowland (1974) first proposed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 

released to the atmosphere by human activity were responsible for the depletion of the 

ozone layer, indisputably associating a global environmental change with anthropogenic 

activity. According to the authors, the photochemical breakdown of CFCs and other 

ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) in the stratosphere resulted in the release of chlorine 

(Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms, which catalyzed the destruction of ozone. The pioneer 

work of Molina and Rowland led to the Nobel Prize for the authors in 1995. 

Subsequently, the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) was also identified as 

an important catalyst for large ozone loss in Polar Regions, by creating sites on which 

fast heterogeneous chemical reactions can occur, rapidly increasing ozone-destroying 

molecules in the stratosphere (Solomon, 1999). 

The early prolific scientific research in the field of ozone depletion culminated in 

the first World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/United Nations Environment 

Program scientific assessment of ozone depletion in 1985 (WMO, 1985), which 

provided the scientific consensus that CFCs and halons posed a critical threat to the 

ozone layer. In response to the conclusions of the report, the landmark Montreal 

Protocol agreement was negotiated in 1987, which regulated the production of CFCs 

and other ODSs (Velders et al., 2007). Since 1987, 193 nations have signed the 



Chapter 1 

17 

Montreal Protocol leading to a worldwide decrease in the production of ODSs. 

Accordingly, the cumulative levels of chlorine and bromine from ODSs in the 

troposphere (Montzka et al., 1996) and stratosphere (Anderson et al., 2000; Froidevaux 

et al., 2006; Mäder et al., 2010) have shown a decreasing trend. 

Based on the reduction of ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere, normal 

ozone levels were initially expected to be restored by around 2050 (Schrope, 2000). 

However, interactions between stratospheric ozone loss and other observed or potential 

atmospheric changes associated with global warming are expected to change the 

timeline. For example, increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are responsible for 

warming in the lower atmosphere (i.e., troposphere), but have the opposite cooling 

effect on the stratosphere. Ozone loss in itself also cools the stratosphere since less 

radiation is absorbed. The cooling of the stratosphere results in an enhanced chance of 

PSCs forming and existing for more prolonged periods at high altitudes. This mediates 

further ozone loss processes, accelerating ozone depletion and cooling the stratosphere 

even more in a positive feedback effect. On the other hand, increases in greenhouse gas 

concentrations, by influencing the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange 

between the stratosphere and the troposphere, can also potentially affect UV levels 

reaching the Earth’s surface (Bais et al., 2011).  

As a result of the interplay between climate change and changes in UV fluxes 

reaching the Earth, the most recent predictions indicate that the UV radiation index is 

expected to decrease by 9 % in northern high latitudes, but to increase by 4 % in the 

tropics and by up to 20 % in southern high latitudes in late spring and early summer, up 

to the year 2095 (Hegglin and Shepherd, 2009). These changes in tropospheric ozone 

budget and the ultraviolet index will likely have consequences for tropospheric radiative 

forcing (Velders et al., 2007), air quality (Wilson et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2011) and 

human and ecosystem health (Ballaré et al., 2011; Häder et al., 2011; Norval et al., 

2011; Zepp et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2012). Warming, acidification and changes in 

ocean stratification patterns are also expected to increase the penetration of UV 

radiation in the water column and enhance organism exposure to UVB in forthcoming 

years (Andrady et al., 2010). Besides these modelled, predicted effects, unpredicted 

events could also potentially affect the UV radiation index. For example, in 2011, an 

unprecedented Arctic ozone loss was recorded as a result of unusually long-lasting cold 

conditions in the Arctic lower stratosphere (Manney et al., 2011). Whether such Arctic 

ozone depletion events may be matched or exceeded in the future, is unknown. These 



Chapter 1 

18 

concerns continue to make the study of the effects of UV radiation on the Earth’s biota a 

critical and timely subject. 

 

Effects of UV radiation on microorganisms 

The recognition of the involvement of UV radiation as a cause or contributing 

factor for skin cancer and eye cataracts, as well as its connection to the development of 

immune deficiencies, prompted the scientific interest on the biological effects of UV 

radiation (Kligman et al., 1985; Kraemer et al., 1987; Kripke, 1988; Taylor et al., 1988). 

The detrimental impact of UV radiation on ecosystem structure and function was also 

soon recognized, and is now known to include decreased primary productivity, altered 

species composition and potential consequences to biogeochemical cycles and food 

production (Caldwell et al., 1998; Zepp et al., 1998; Searles et al., 2001; Caldwell et al., 

2003; Häder et al., 2003; Paul and Gwynn-Jones, 2003; Caldwell et al., 2007; Häder et 

al., 2007; Zepp et al., 2007; Ballaré et al., 2011; Häder et al., 2011). 

UV radiation can be a particularly important selective force in aquatic systems, 

since radiation can penetrate to considerable depths (Fleischmann, 1989; Smith, 1989; 

Worrest and Häder, 1989; Smith et al., 1992; Tedetti and Sempéré, 2006). For example, 

in the subtropical open Atlantic, the 10 % radiation level for 320 nm, 340 nm and 380 

nm wavelengths is at &amp;lt;25, 35 and 60 m deep, respectively (Obernosterer et al., 1999) 

and UV penetration has been detected to a depth of 70 m in Antarctica (Smith et al., 

1992). Early studies focused on the UV sensitivity responses of phytoplankton, due to 

its contribution to the primary productivity of ecosystems (Smith et al., 1980; Smith, 

1989; Karentz et al., 1991; Helbling et al., 1992; Behrenfeld et al., 1993; Cullen and 

Neale, 1994; Helbling et al., 1994; Vernet et al., 1994; Häder et al., 1995). However, the 

short generation time, simple haploid genomes with little or no functional redundancy 

and small size, which might preclude effective cellular shading or protective 

pigmentation, make bacteria particularly susceptible to UV radiation (Garcia-Pichel, 

1994). Considering the role of bacteria in the cycling of nutrients and energy in 

ecosystems (Azam et al., 1983), the knowledge of the effects of UV radiation on 

bacterial communities becomes of utmost importance, as demonstrated by the 

considerable number of reviews covering the effects of UV radiation in both freshwater 

and marine systems (Häder and Worrest, 1991; Karentz, 1994; Siebeck et al., 1994; 



Chapter 1 

19 

Herndl et al., 1997; Häder et al., 1998; Moran and Zepp, 2000; Vincent and Neale, 

2000; Whitehead et al., 2000; Häder, 2001; Buma et al., 2003; Häder et al., 2003). 

In the natural environment, UVR effects are generally attenuated by protection 

and repair strategies (Becker-Hapak et al., 1997; Cabiscol et al., 2000; Tedetti and 

Sempéré, 2006). The overall stress imposed by UV exposure thus reflects an 

equilibrium between damage, repair and the energetic costs of protection, which may 

affect energy consumption and the biochemical composition of the cellular material of 

individuals, ultimately resulting in decreased survival and growth rate (Moriarty, 1986; 

Vincent and Neale, 2000). Consequences at the organism level can, in turn, affect the 

microbial community, creating shifts in ecosystem carbon cycles, and in the fluxes of 

energy and nutrients (Schimel et al., 2007). 

 

Mechanisms of UV-induced damage  

At the cellular level, the toxic effects of UV radiation can be initiated by direct 

and indirect photochemical mechanisms (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, 2000). 

The direct mechanism involves the absorption of UV photons by chromophores present 

in certain biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Upon UV absorption, these 

molecules are photochemically degraded or transformed, resulting in impairment or 

even loss of biological function. The indirect mechanism involves the absorption of UV 

photons by a photosensitizer molecule inside or outside the cell (namely flavins, 

porphyrins, quinones, protein-bound tryptophan and also humic compounds present in 

environmental samples) (Curtis et al., 1992; Davies-Colley et al., 1994). Upon 

excitation, the photosensitizer is able to transfer energy in two different ways, often 

called type I and type II mechanisms (Foote, 1987; Foote, 1991). In the type I process, 

the electronically excited sensitizer reacts directly with the cellular component, 

subtracting one electron or hydrogen atom from the cellular target, resulting in the 

formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals (e.g., superoxide 

ions and hydroxyl radicals) which initiate free-radical chain reactions. The type II 

mechanism involves energy transfer from the sensitizer to molecular oxygen with the 

consequent formation of an excited state of oxygen, singlet oxygen, which can then 

attack biomolecules (Hélène, 1987).  

In the case of the direct pathway, the magnitude of the damage caused by UV 

exposure is determined by the amount of radiation absorbed and the quantum yield of 

photodestruction (i.e., the number of molecules damaged per photon absorbed), which 



Chapter 1 

20 

in turn depends on the incident UV wavelength (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, 

2000). UVR can be divided in three wavelength ranges: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB 

(280-320 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm). Although, on a proton basis, UVA radiation 

contains less energy than UVB radiation, the greater fraction of solar UV radiation in 

the UVA (95 %) spectrum than in the UVB spectrum (5 %) makes it a potentially 

significant source of biological damage (Moan et al., 1999). DNA absorbs only weakly 

at longer UV wavelengths (Wells and Han, 1984). Therefore, the biological effects of 

UVA are usually considered to be mostly indirect, resulting from intracellular 

generation of ROS which cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Tyrrell, 

1973; Girotti, 1985; Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Girotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, 

2006). The UVB component of solar radiation can directly induce the formation of 

DNA lesions that block DNA replication and RNA transcription and, left unrepaired, 

lead to cell death (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). UVB-induced damage can also arise 

from increased production of intracellular ROS upon irradiation, as suggested by the 

enhanced expression of ROS scavenging systems following irradiation (Qiu et al., 2004; 

Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Di Capua et al., 2011). The resulting damage can be 

even more detrimental than the direct effects of UV radiation, since oxidative lesions 

are energetically expensive to prevent and very resource intensive to repair (Halliwell 

and Gutteridge, 1999; Lister et al., 2010).  

Although almost entirely screened out by the ozone layer, high-energy UVC 

wavelengths remain useful in laboratorial experiments to assess UV sensitivity in 

bacteria that are highly tolerant or insensitive to elevated doses of UVB (Sundin and 

Jacobs, 1999). Additionally, UVC wavelengths are also well known for their potential 

to inactivate microorganisms in several settings, including hospitals (Andersen et al., 

2006), the pharmaceutical/medical industry (Rastogi et al., 2007), water treatment plants 

(Høibye et al., 2008) and food products (Chun et al., 2009; Sommers et al., 2009). 

 

Reactive oxygen species and the importance of metals 

The autoxidation of flavoenzymes (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate 

reductase, NADH dehydrogenase I and II, glutamate synthase, lipoamide 

dehydrogenase, and sulfite reductase) is a key biological source of both superoxide 

(O2
?-) and H2O2 in the cell (Imlay, 2008; Spiro and D'Autreaux, 2012). Superoxide 

toxicity arises from its ability to directly oxidize and inactivate proteins containing iron-

sulphur (4Fe-4S) clusters (e.g., aconitases, fumarases, serine dehydratase, threonine 



Chapter 1 

21 

deaminase, isopropylmalate isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase). The reaction 

results in inactive [3Fe-4S] clusters and releases free iron ions [Fe2+] and H2O2, which 

can participate in Fenton and Haber-Weiss oxidative reactions that generate the potent 

hydroxyl radical (OH?) (see below). Superoxide can also participate in lipid 

peroxidation (Thomas et al., 1985).  

While H2O2 is poorly reactive compared to other ROS, its long half-life and 

capability to diffuse across the cell membranes makes it significant in oxidative stress. 

H2O2 can also be produced as a result of the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase 

(SOD) (McCord and Fridovich, 1969; Imlay, 2008) and from the photooxidation of 

tryptophan (McCormick et al., 1976). H2O2 is able to directly oxidize and inactivate the 

iron-sulphur clusters of key enzymes. H2O2 can also react with the intracellular pool of 

incorporated ferrous iron and thereby generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. As a 

consequence of its reactions with iron, H2O2 interferes with iron homeostasis and 

metabolism, diminishing the delivery of iron into new metalloproteins (Valko et al., 

2006; Imlay, 2008). 

The hydroxyl radical (OH?) is highly reactive with a half-life in aqueous 

solution of less than 1 ns (Liochev and Fridovich, 2002). The majority of hydroxyl 

radicals are produced from H2O2 and superoxides in a Haber-Weiss reaction (Bast et al., 

1991; Kehrer, 2000; Koppenol, 2001): 

H2O2 + O2
?- ? O2 + OH

- + OH? 

or in a transition metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction, involving Fe2+: 

Fe2+ + H2O2 ? Fe
3+ + OH- + OH? 

Other metals, like Cu+ and Co2+, can also favour the generation of the hydroxyl 

radical but, since they are only present in very small amounts in the cell, the reaction is 

less favourable (Bucher et al., 1983). Additionally, the hydroxyl radical can also be 

formed by metal-independent processes, as a result of the decomposition of 

peroxynitrite, an oxidant formed by the combination between nitric oxide and the 

superoxide radical (Hogg et al., 1992).  

The extremely short half-life of the hydroxyl radical limits its reactivity to the 

immediate vicinity from where it is formed, such as near iron-sulphur clusters or in 

enzymes using iron as a prosthetic metal (Imlay, 2006). Iron bound to DNA can also 

catalyze the formation of the hydroxyl radical which then attacks DNA bases or the 

deoxyribosyl backbone of DNA to produce damaged bases or strand breaks (Imlay et 



Chapter 1 

22 

al., 1988). A role for the hydroxyl radical in sunlight-induced damage in Escherichia 

coli has been proposed (Oppezzo, 2012). 

Among different ROS, singlet oxygen (1O2) is the only electronically excited 

state of molecular oxygen. The relatively short lifetime of singlet oxygen (~ 4 µ s) limits 

the distance it can diffuse in cells and, therefore, restricts its reactivity (Krasnovsky Jr, 

1981; Egorov et al., 1989; Baker and Kanofsky, 1992; Gorman and Rodgers, 1992). 

Singlet oxygen readily reacts with DNA, lipids (mainly unsaturated fatty acids) and 

particularly with proteins (Davies, 2003; Miyamoto et al., 2007). Upon reaction of 

amino acids with singlet oxygen, short-lived endo- or hydroperoxides are formed which, 

in turn, decompose into reactive radicals in the presence of redox-reactive metal ions 

and can cause oxidative damage to other biomolecules (Miyamoto et al., 2007). Singlet 

oxygen has also been shown to induce the formation of protein carbonyls and modify 

the prosthetic groups of proteins (Davies, 2003). Interaction of singlet oxygen with 

unsaturated lipids can form lipid hydroperoxides, which are able to diffuse in cells and 

initiate chain oxidation reactions at sites distant from the site of initial photodamage 

(Howden and Faux, 1996). Additionally, in the presence of Fe2+ or Cu+, lipid peroxides 

formed as a result of singlet oxygen attack can participate in Fenton-like reactions to 

produce oxy- and peroxy- radicals capable of inducing damage to DNA and proteins 

(Nowis and Golab, 2008). Singlet oxygen has been implicated in UVA-induced damage 

(Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Baier et al., 2006). 

Understanding the role of metals in UVB-induced damage is necessary for a 

realistic perspective of the interaction of bacteria with radiation in a natural context, 

where these metals can be enriched, particularly when industries and agricultural areas 

are located nearby (Zhou et al., 2008). Furthermore, information regarding the 

contribution of metals for UV-induced bacterial inactivation may help develop more 

efficient photocatalytic disinfection strategies (Sciacca et al., 2010). 

 

Cellular targets of UV radiation 

DNA 

The most notable molecule affected by UV radiation is DNA. The absorbing 

centres within DNA are the purine and pyrimidine bases, which have absorption 

maxima at 260-265 nm (Diffey, 1991). Therefore, UVC and UVB wavelengths are able 

to cause direct damage to DNA, in an oxygen-independent manner, while DNA damage 

by UVA wavelengths generally arises as a result of photosensitized reactions involving 



Chapter 1 

23 

ROS (Ravanat et al., 2001; Cadet et al., 2005b). The main lesions induced by UVB and 

UVC wavelengths are the DNA photoproducts cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 

and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs), resulting from the formation 

of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidines (Cadet et al., 2005b) (Fig. 1.1). CPDs 

are generally produced in higher amounts than 6-4 PPs upon UV irradiation of DNA. 

Formation of CPDs under UVA has also been observed (Ikehata et al., 2008). The 

generation of these lesions by UV radiation is influenced by the DNA sequence. For 

example, sequences that facilitate bending and unwinding are favourable sites for 

damage (Becker and Wang, 1989; Lyamichev, 1991). In bacteria, the distribution of 

bipyrimidine photoproducts within UVB-irradiated DNA has also been found to be 

profoundly affected by the G+C content of the genome (Matallana-Surget et al., 2008). 

Therefore, the pattern and amount of UV-induced damage to DNA is expected to be 

variable among bacterial strains.  

 
Fig. 1.1. Main types of DNA photoproducts resulting from exposure to UVB radiation: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 

pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs). CPD formation: upon UV exposure, a bond (red line) is formed between 

adjacent thymine (or cytosine) residues (C5 and C6). Since these bonds are shorter than the spacing between the planes of adjacent 

thymines, the DNA helix becomes distorted, causing the stalling of the DNA polymerase at the site of the lesion. 6-4 PPs are formed 

similarly to CPDs, but the covalent bond (red line) is established between the C6 of the 5’ pyrimidine and the C4 of its adjacent 3’ 

pyrimidine. R = H or CH3 (Maloy et al., 1994). 

 

Other DNA lesions that can occur to a smaller extent during UVB exposure 

include photohydration of cytosine, oxidation of guanine into 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine 

and the formation of adducts between either two adjacent adenine bases or between 

adenine and a vicinal thymine (Cadet et al., 2005b). Additionally, reactive oxygen 



Chapter 1 

24 

species generated during photosensitized reactions can interact with DNA to form 

modified bases, strand breaks, alkali-labile sites and DNA-protein cross-links (Mitchell, 

1995). 

 

Lipids 

The action spectrum for UV effects does not correlate with the absorption 

spectrum of lipids. Therefore, UV-induced damage to lipids is likely to be a result of 

photodynamic action (Girotti, 2001). ROS, most notably singlet oxygen, cause damage 

to lipids, particularly unsaturated ones, by directly oxidizing their double bonds or by 

initiating a chain of auto-catalyzed reactions of one oxidizing lipid reacting with another 

(lipid peroxidation) (Garmyn and Yarosh, 2007). Lipid peroxidation end products, such 

as malondialdehyde or 4-hydroxy-nonenal, induce a number of cellular responses, 

including changes in the electrical properties and ionic permeability of the membrane 

and, at higher concentrations, are cytotoxic (Girotti, 1998). Furthermore, these 

compounds can also interact with DNA (Park and Floyd, 1992) and proteins, potentially 

leading to loss of protein function (Esterbauer et al., 1991; Stadtman, 1992; Szweda et 

al., 1993; Berlett and Stadtman, 1997). 

 

Proteins 

The absorption maximum of proteins in the UV region is at approximately 280 

nm due to absorption by the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe) 

and tryptophan (Trp), as well as cysteine (Cys). These proteins can be direct targets of 

UVB, which can induce the scission of disulphide bridges between cysteine residues, 

important for the tertiary structure of many proteins, thus affecting protein structure and 

function (Creed, 1984). Direct UV photolysis of aromatic amino acids or disulphide 

bridges can also cause inactivation of proteins and enzymes, if the affected residues are 

included in the active site (Hollósy, 2002; Pattison and Davies, 2006).  

Proteins are also key targets of photosensitized damage, which may cause 

functional changes in structural and enzymatic proteins. Oxidative reactions may result 

in modification of amino acid side chains, fragmentation of polypeptide chains and 

intra- and intermolecular cross-linking of proteins and peptides (Nowis and Golab, 

2008). Proteins that contain iron as a prosthetic metal are particularly noteworthy targets 

of oxidation through Fenton reaction, being readily oxidizable by hydrogen peroxide 

(Beyer and Fridovich, 1991; Tamarit et al., 1998; Murakami et al., 2006). Lysine (Lys), 



Chapter 1 

25 

arginine (Arg), proline (Pro) and threonine (Thr) can be directly oxidized upon the 

absorption of UV radiation by the protein or bound chromophore groups through 

photosensitized reactions (Pattison and Davies, 2006). Upon oxidative attack of Pro, 

Arg, Lys and Thr, carbonyl (C = O) groups are introduced in the side chains of the 

protein, generating aldehydes or ketone products (Nyström, 2005). Quantitatively, the 

most prominent products of the carbonylation reaction are glutamic semialdehyde from 

Arg and Pro, and aminoadipic semialdehyde from Lys (Requena et al., 2001). In 

addition, carbonyl groups can be introduced into proteins by reaction with reactive 

carbonyl compounds produced by oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids (Nyström, 

2005). Protein carbonyl levels have, therefore, been used as a marker of ROS-mediated 

protein oxidation (Dukan and Nyström, 1999; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Nyström, 2005; 

Daly et al., 2007; Bosshard et al., 2010b).  

 

Repair and protection strategies against UV-induced damage 

DNA repair 

In response to UV-induced damage, bacteria have evolved several DNA repair 

mechanisms that can essentially be divided in dark repair and light-dependent repair. At 

least three dark repair mechanisms can be found in bacteria that are inducible to a 

greater or lesser extent as a part of the SOS regulon: (1) excision repair, which includes 

nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER); (2) post-replication 

recombinational repair; and (3) error-prone or mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) 

(Simonson et al., 1990; Smith and Walker, 1998) (Fig. 1.2 A-C). Nucleotide excision 

repair involves the creation of dual incisions at the 5’ and 3’ extremities of the damaged 

site and removal of the section of the DNA containing the lesion, being the resulting gap 

subsequently filled by DNA polymerase, using the complementary strand as a template, 

and sealed by DNA ligase (Reardon and Sancar, 2005). In base excision repair, the 

enzyme DNA glycosylase removes the damaged or modified DNA base, generating an 

apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site which is then excised by an AP endonuclease or an AP 

lyase. The remaining deoxyribose phosphate residue is removed by a phosphodiesterase. 

The resulting gap is filled by a DNA polymerase, and the strand is sealed by DNA 

ligase (Sakumi and Sekiguchi, 1990; Seeberg et al., 1995). Recombinational repair is 

involved in the repair of double-strand breaks and single-strand breaks in damaged 

DNA, which cannot be directly repaired (Shinohara and Ogawa, 1995). In this process, 

the intact parental strand invades the other duplex containing the break allowing the 



Chapter 1 

26 

filling of the gap. The gap that is left in the previously intact strand is then filled by the 

DNA polymerase and sealed by DNA ligase (Kuzminov, 1999).  

 
Fig. 1.2. Main mechanisms involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. (A) Mutagenic repair, SOS mutagenesis or 

error-prone repair. In this process, a modified DNA polymerase is able to read through damaged DNA, misincorporating 

nucleotides in the section of the copy strand opposite the lesion. Mutagenic repair involves the recA, umuD and umuC (organized in 

the umuDC operon) genes. The RecA protein activates the cleavage of UmuD to an active form, UmuD’. While the exact 

contribution of UmuC and UmuD’ to mutagenic repair is still unclear, it seems that the UmuC-UmuD’ complex directly interacts 

with RecA and the stalled DNA polymerase, inhibiting its editing function, thus promoting error-prone replication. (B) 

Recombinational repair. During DNA synthesis, the DNA polymerase encounters a DNA lesion and leaves a gap in the copy 

strand opposite the lesion. To repair the gap, RecA-dependent recombination occurs whereby the good template copy strand is 

cleaved and invades the gap in the damaged copy strand. A crossover intermediate forms that, after cutting and sealing, results in 

filling the gap with the complementary DNA from the sister strand. The gap formed in the sister strand is filled by the DNA 

polymerase and the gaps are sealed by the DNA ligase. The lesion is then remover by nucleotide excision repair or simply diluted 

out during growth. (C) Excision repair. The excision repair mechanism is an ATP-dependent, multistep enzymatic process. The 

first step of the mechanism corresponds to an incision step, which can occur by two mechanisms. In E. coli, a repair endonuclease 

recognizes the distortion of the DNA helix produced by the DNA lesion and makes two cuts (at the 5’ and 3’ extremities of the 

lesion) in the sugar-phosphate backbone. At the 5’ incision site, a 3’-OH group results which the DNA polymerase uses as a primer 

to synthesize a new strand while displacing the DNA segment that carries the lesion. In the final step the newly synthesized segment 

is joined to the original strand by DNA ligase. In other systems (e.g., Micrococcus luteus and E. coli phage T4), the incision step 

occurs in two distinct stages. In the first step, the N-glycosidic bond is cleaved in the 5’-nucleotide of the dimer. The incision is 

completed by an endonuclease activity that recognizes a deoxyribose lacking a base. The enzyme makes a single cut at the 5’ side of 

the remaining thymine in the dimer site. The deoxyribose is removed afterwards and the polymerase acts at the new 3’-OH group, 

displacing the strand and filling the gap. The displaced strand is subsequently excised enzymatically. (D) Light-dependent repair, 

photoenzymatic repair or photoreactivation. In this process, the enzyme DNA photolyase, encoded by the phr gene in E. coli, 

reverses the dimerization reaction induced by UV radiation upon absorbing blue light (300-500 nm). The enzyme uses the light 

energy absorbed to cleave the dimers (Maloy et al., 1994; White, 1995). Further details on the photoreactivation mechanism are 

provided in Fig. 1.3. 



Chapter 1 

27 

Mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) involves the activation of low fidelity repair 

polymerases, which are able to perform DNA synthesis across damaged regions of 

DNA (translesion DNA synthesis) in a template-independent manner, therefore rescuing 

stalled replication forks and allowing complete replication of the genome, but carrying 

the cost of an increased mutation rate (Goodman, 2002; Rattray and Strathern, 2003). 

MDR-mediated UV tolerance seems to provide a critical ecological advantage for 

microorganisms inhabiting UV-exposed habitats, such as epiphytic plant pathogens 

(Sundin and Murillo, 1999). 

In bacteria, dark repair systems are regulated by the RecA protein. Exposure to 

UVA and UVB radiation has been shown to result in increased levels of the RecA 

protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Elasri and Miller, 1998), Vibrio natriegens (Booth 

et al., 2001b) and Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). Since 

RecA levels correlate with the cell’s capacity to repair DNA damage (Miller, 2000), 

RecA induction levels have been used as a dosimeter of the repair potential in both 

isolates (Booth et al., 2001b) and bacterial communities (Booth et al., 2001a). 

 

 
Fig. 1.3. Catalytic cycle of the repair of bipyrimidine photoproducts by DNA photolyase. The photolyase enzyme contains two types 

of cofactors: the redox-active cofactor flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the light harvesting factor, which can be 5,10-

methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF) or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF). In the repair process, the DNA photolyase 

binds to its substrate. The light harvesting factor (MTHF or 8-HDF) absorbs light (300-500 nm) and the excitation energy is 

transferred to FADH-. The flavin in its excited form (*FADH-) transfers one electron to the pyrimidine dimer, generating a 

flavin/substrate radical pair. The excited pyrimidine dimer radical (T&lt;&gt;T*) suffers a bond rearrangement, which results in the 

cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond of the pyrimidine dimer. The electron of the excited dimer is transferred back to the 

flavin radical (FADH*). FADH- and a repaired dinucleotide result from the process (Stochel et al., 2009). 

 

Light-dependent repair, also known as photoenzymatic repair (PER) or 

photoreactivation, depends on the DNA photolyase enzyme that can be activated by 

blue light (300-500 nm) (Mitchell, 1995) (Fig. 1.2 D). Photolyases contain two 

chromophores, one of which (5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate or 8-hydroxy-

5-deazaflavin) harvests light energy, transferring it to a reduced flavin chromophore that 

acts as the reaction centre in the reversal of the DNA lesion (Sancar, 1994) (Fig. 1.3). 



Chapter 1 

28 

During photoenzymatic repair, photolyase binds the DNA lesion (CPDs in the case of 

CPD photolyase or 6-4 PPs in the case of the 6-4 PP photolyase), reverses the lesion in 

a light-dependent step and dissociates from the repaired DNA (Kim et al., 1994; Sancar, 

1994; Sancar, 1996; Thoma, 1999).  

The importance of photoreactivation and dark repair for bacteria has been 

deduced from field and laboratorial studies of the kinetics of formation of DNA 

photoproducts in bacterioplankton (Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Jeffrey et al., 1996b; Meador et 

al., 2002). For example, the occurrence of PER in natural bacterial communities has 

been inferred from analyses of CPD kinetics in bacterioplankton samples obtained from 

the marine water column throughout the solar day (Jeffrey et al., 1996b). Similar field 

studies have also shown a reduction in the amount of CPDs from the day to the night 

period in bacterioplankton, suggesting that much of the DNA damage induced by UV 

exposure during the day is repaired at night, thus indicating that NER is an important 

repair mechanism as well (Lyons et al., 1998; Pakulski et al., 1998).  

 

ROS scavenging systems 

ROS are produced abundantly by a variety of metabolic pathways in cells 

(Halliwell, 2006). By increasing the activity of oxidases and peroxidases, UV exposure 

enhances ROS production in the cell (Apel and Hirt, 2004; Beak et al., 2004). 

Throughout the course of evolution, bacteria have evolved several defence mechanisms 

against oxidative stress, most notably antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide 

dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (Imlay, 2003).  

SOD is considered to be one of the primary antioxidant defences of the cell, 

because it catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide (O2
?-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 

preventing further generation of free radicals (McCord and Fridovich, 1969). The 

resulting H2O2 is then decomposed by CAT to oxygen and water.  

The radioprotective effect of SOD is conferred not only by its ability to remove 

the potentially dangerous radical superoxide, but also by preventing the redox cycling of 

metals involved in the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Fridovich, 1995). However, 

SOD may actually sensitize organisms and enhance oxidative damage since H2O2 

(scavenged by the photosensitive enzyme CAT), resulting from the activity of SOD, is a 

more oxidant species than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). 

Low UVA doses have been shown to result in substantial up-regulation of SOD 

activity (Hoerter et al., 2005a). High catalase activity also seems to play a role in UV 



Chapter 1 

29 

tolerance, in some bacterial strains (Di Capua et al., 2011). However, CAT has been 

shown to be inactivated by UV radiation (Wood and Schallreuter, 2006). A direct role 

of CAT in generating oxidants in response to UVB light has also been proposed (Heck 

et al., 2003). Therefore, reducing the levels of CAT activity upon exposure to UV 

radiation could be a protective mechanism to minimize damage. Decreased enzyme 

synthesis or altered assembly of enzyme subunits have been suggested to account for 

decreased CAT activity upon UV exposure (Hertwig et al., 1992). 

 

Effects of UVR on bacterial communities 

UV radiation affects microorganisms in natural communities both directly and 

indirectly. In the microbial loop, bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton and bacterivores 

interact closely (Azam et al., 1983). Therefore, it is expected that if one group of 

organisms is directly impacted by UV radiation (e.g., DNA damage) this will indirectly 

affect carbon flow through the other groups (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, 2000). 

For example, since systems dominated by different phytoplankton communities usually 

have different associated bacterial communities (Pinhassi et al., 2004) and bacterial 

communities are influenced by phytoplankton exudates (Van Hannen et al., 1999; 

Riemann et al., 2000), variations in the light regime that affect phytoplankton will 

indirectly influence the bacterial community. Predation by bacterivores is also 

influenced by UV-radiation which in turn can affect the outcome of UV exposure for 

bacteria (Sommaruga et al., 1996; Chatila et al., 1999).  

Effects of UVR on bacteria are also influenced by the photochemical alteration 

of the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to bacteria by radiation. On the 

one hand, irradiation of DOC can result in the production of low molecular weight 

compounds that are easily degradable by bacteria, stimulating bacterial growth (Kieber 

et al., 1989; Wetzel et al., 1995; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998). On the other hand, 

refractory products and ROS might also be formed in the process which could exert an 

overall inhibitory effect on bacteria (Obernosterer et al., 1999; Tranvik and Bertilsson, 

2001). 

 

Effects on bacterial abundance 

Decreased bacterial abundance seems to be a common effect of exposure to solar 

UV radiation (Müller-Niklas et al., 1995; Joux et al., 1999; Maranger et al., 2002; 

Sinton et al., 2002; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Hoerter et al., 2005b; Berney et al., 2006d;

Bosshard et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a; 

Santos et al., 2012b). Detrimental effects of UV radiation on cell abundance can arise as 

a result of membrane dysfunction elicited by reactive oxygen species, eventually 

leading to increased membrane permeability and cell death (Berney et al., 2006b; 

Bosshard et al., 2010a). Genomic instability and mutagenesis as a result of UV-induced 

DNA damage (Friedberg et al., 2004) can also contribute to decrease cell abundance 

during irradiation. By disrupting the ability of bacteria to properly replicate, 

cyclobutane dimers formed upon UV exposure can contribute to the reduction in 

bacterial numbers during irradiation, as well (Karentz et al., 1994). Likewise, UV-

induced lysogeny of virus-infected cells is also a contributing factor for decreased cell 

abundance during irradiation (Maranger et al., 2002). Finally, a detrimental effect of the 

photoproducts resulting from DOM (dissolved organic matter) irradiation on bacterial 

numbers has also been found (Ortega-Retuerta et al., 2007). 

Some beneficial effects of UVR on bacterial abundance have also been reported 

(Lindell et al., 1995; Lindell et al., 1996; Mostajir et al., 1999; Chatila et al., 2001; De 

Lange et al., 2003), as a result of the release of exudates by UV-stressed phytoplankton 

and UV-induced photolysis of high molecular weight DOM into smaller molecules that 

can subsequently be incorporated by bacterioplankton, promoting bacterial growth. 

Additionally, negative effects of UV radiation on bacterivores can also account for 

enhanced bacterial numbers upon UV exposure (Sommaruga et al., 1996; Mostajir et al., 

1999).  

 

Effects on bacterial community structure 

Variability in the UV responses and subsequent repair strategies of bacterial 

isolates (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; Santos et 

al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a) have been considered indicative of the potential of UV 

radiation to affect microbial community structure. However, results on the effects of UV 

radiation on bacterial community composition are contrasting, with some studies 

reporting only minimal effects of UV radiation on the community structure (Winter et 

al., 2001; Norris et al., 2002; Piquet et al., 2010) and others indicating a substantial 

dependence of the bacterial community structure on radiation (Langenheder et al., 2006; 

Dobretsov et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2011a; Manrique et al., 2012; Pajares et al., 2012; 

Santos et al., 2012b). UV effects on bacterial community structure may involve the 

selection of phototolerant members of the community by radiation. For example, 



Chapter 1 

31 

members of Gammaproteobacteria have been found to dominate bacterial assemblages 

exposed to UV radiation (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). Differences in 

the efficiency of the systems involved in the repair of damage induced by UV radiation 

can contribute for the variability in UV sensitivity among different bacteria (Joux et al., 

1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos 

et al., 2012a) and help to explain the effects of UV radiation on bacterial community 

structure.  

Effects of UV radiation on bacterial community structure can, in turn, lead to 

shifts in the pathways of DOM use by bacteria (Morris et al., 2002), since different 

bacterial groups have different susceptibilities to UV radiation and also differ in their 

activities and patterns of DOM utilization (Cottrell and Kirchman, 2000). For example, 

Alphaproteobacteria, which are UV-sensitive, are responsible for a large part of low-

molecular-weight-DOM uptake in the ocean, while Bacteroidetes, considered as more 

UV-resistant, are specialized in high-molecular-weight-DOM uptake (Cottrell and 

Kirchman, 2000; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006).  

 

Effects on bacterial metabolic activity 

Field studies have indicate that, in general, exposure to UVR results in a 

decrease in amino acid uptake (Bailey et al., 1983), exoenzymatic activities (Herndl et 

al., 1993; Müller-Niklas et al., 1995; Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption 

(Pakulski et al., 1998), leucine and thymidine incorporation (Aas et al., 1996; Lindell et 

al., 1996; Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Visser et al., 2002; Santos et al., 

2012b), as well as single-cell activity (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; Pérez and Sommaruga, 

2007; Ruiz-González et al., 2012), in bacterioplankton. However, results are sometimes 

contrasting among studies and variable even between bacterial isolates tested in the 

same study (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; 

Hörtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a).  

Monitoring diel cycles has been frequently used to infer the inhibitory potential 

of solar radiation on bacterioplankton activities, particularly leucine and thymidine 

incorporation, in the field. Leucine and thymidine incorporation have been found to be 

inhibited during the day and recover during the night period (Pakulski et al., 1998; 

Chróst and Faust, 1999; Visser et al., 1999; Visser et al., 2002; Hernández et al., 2007; 

Van Wambeke et al., 2009). However, leucine and thymidine incorporation do not seem 



Chapter 1 

32 

to follow the same pattern of inhibition and the extent of the photoinhibition of 

incorporation can also vary during the day (Pakulski et al., 1998; Visser et al., 2002).  

Conclusions on the waveband of the solar spectrum most responsible for the 

inhibition of activity also seem to vary among studies. For example, while many studies 

identify UVB radiation as the main solar waveband contributing for the inhibition of 

leucine and thymidine (Herndl et al., 1993; Aas et al., 1996; Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Conan 

et al., 2008), others highlight the inhibitory potential of UVA and even PAR 

(Gourmelon et al., 1994; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Hernández et al., 2007). Some studies 

have also indicated that leucine and thymidine incorporation are affected differently by 

different UV wavelengths (Aas et al., 1996).  

Solar radiation also affects bacterial activities at the single-cell level. For 

example, in the northwestern Mediterranean Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes 

seem to be highly resistant to solar radiation, displaying small changes in activity after 

irradiation, while Alphaproteobacteria are more sensitive to radiation (Alonso-Sáez et 

al., 2006). More recently, the seasonality of bacterial responses to solar radiation was 

also reported, with autumn and winter irradiances too low to cause changes in single-

cell activity ([3H]leucine uptake), and variable effects in spring and summer (Ruiz-

González et al., 2012). 

Stimulatory effects of UV exposure, particularly UVA wavelengths, on leucine 

and thymidine incorporation have been reported as a result of DOM 

phototransformation (Gustavson et al., 2000; Carrillo et al., 2002; Xenopoulos and 

Schindler, 2003; Pakulski et al., 2007; Piccini et al., 2009; Vähätalo et al., 2011). 

However, inhibitory effects of DOM phototransformation on bacterial activity have also 

been observed (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; Pérez and Sommaruga, 2007). DOM 

characteristics, such as its age and origin, seem to contribute to determine the effects of 

solar radiation on the availability of DOM for bacteria (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; 

Obernosterer et al., 1999; Anesio et al., 2000; Tranvik and Bertilsson, 2001). Freshly 

produced or autochthonous DOM is prone to become more recalcitrant for bacteria upon 

irradiation (Tranvik and Kokalj, 1998; Pausz and Herndl, 1999), while irradiation of old 

or allochthonous DOM produces readily usable products which stimulate bacterial 

growth (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; Anesio and Granéli, 2003). Furthermore, solar 

radiation is able to reverse the bioavailability of DOM to bacterioplankton, being the 

biological reactivity of irradiated DOM inversely related to its bioavailability prior to 

irradiation (Obernosterer et al., 2001). The effects of DOM phototransformation on 



Chapter 1 

33 

bacterial activity have been associated with the changes induced in bacterial community 

composition by the process (Pérez and Sommaruga, 2007; Piccini et al., 2009).  

UVR also exerts a significant detrimental effect on the activity of extracellular 

enzymes (Herndl et al., 1993; Müller-Niklas et al., 1995). Aminopeptidase activity 

appears to be particularly susceptible to UV exposure (Wetzel et al., 1995; Lindell and 

Edling, 1996; Espeland and Wetzel, 2001; Santos et al., 2011a). While UVB contributes 

the most for the inhibition of extracellular enzyme activity upon exposure to natural 

solar radiation (Espeland and Wetzel, 2001), UVA exposure can also result in 

significant enzyme inhibition (Tank et al., 2005). Inhibition of extracellular enzymes by 

UVB exposure has been attributed to their direct photolytic cleavage (Müller-Niklas et 

al., 1995). However, direct photoinactivation of enzymes by natural sunlight, at least in 

lakes, has been considered negligible (Scully et al., 2003). Alternatively, inactivation 

might occur through photochemical processes whereby enzymes are inactivated through 

binding of Fe (III) resulting from the oxidation of Fe (II) by H2O2 (Scully et al., 2003).  

Whether UV radiation can exert a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on bacterial 

metabolism seems, therefore, dependent on the physical, chemical and biological 

properties of the water body studied. However, despite the variability of the reported 

results, most studies are unanimous in concluding that UVR has the potential to alter the 

efficiency by which dissolved organic matter is transformed into bacterial biomass and, 

thus, affect global biogeochemical cycles. 

 

Factors influencing the responses of microorganisms to UVR 

The impact of solar UVR on marine microorganisms is complex and several 

factors, including species composition, environmental factors such as temperature, 

salinity and nutrients, as well as intrinsic properties, like DNA repair potential and cell 

size, are crucial in determining their sensitivity. 

 

Temperature 

Inactivation of bacteria by UVC and UVB radiation has been found to be either 

insensitive to temperature, suggesting that DNA damage arises as a result of a purely 

photochemical process (Severin et al., 1983; Abu-ghararah, 1994; Pakker et al., 2000), 

or increase with enhanced temperature (Takeuchi et al., 1996; Li et al., 2002; 

Waterworth et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). On the other 



Chapter 1 

34 

hand, the photoreactivity of isolated DNA has been reported to decrease with increasing 

temperature (Douki, 2006). 

Consistent with enzyme-catalyzed reactions being temperature dependent, DNA 

repair rates in bacteria (Dorrell et al., 1995; Salcedo et al., 2007) and archaea (Eker et 

al., 1991) increase with temperature. Increased temperatures have also been found to 

reduce bacterioplankton sensitivity to UVR, as determined by [3H]leucine incorporation 

(Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010), while the activity of antioxidant enzymes during exposure 

to UV radiation has been shown to decrease with temperature (Borgeraas and Hessen, 

2000). 

 

Nutrients 

Organic and inorganic nutrients can influence the susceptibility of bacterial 

communities to UV radiation by affecting the penetration of radiation in the water body 

(Joux et al., 2009) or altering bacterial physiology (Steinberger et al., 2002). For 

example, nitrogen (N) limitation can potentially increase susceptibility to UVR by 

constraining the defences of the cell, since proteins involved in DNA repair require 

nitrogen (Lesser and Shick, 1989; Roy, 2000). Phosphorus (P) is a constituent of nucleic 

acids (DNA and RNA) and occurs in the phospholipids of cell membranes, as well as 

theichoic acids and teichuronic acids of the Gram-positive cell wall. Phosphate is also a 

component of ADP and ATP which is required, for example, for the activity of the 

nucleotide excision repair system (Moolenaar et al., 2000). Therefore, phosphorus and 

nitrogen availability could influence bacterial responses to UVR by affecting bacterial 

physiology (Pausz and Herndl, 1999; Medina-Sánchez et al., 2002; Pausz and Herndl, 

2002).  

 

Growth phase and growth rate 

Cell specific growth rate is also a critical determinant of bacterial susceptibility 

to UV radiation (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). UV effects are 

also influenced by the growth phase, with stationary phase cells generally being more 

resistant and recovering faster from the lethal effects of UV radiation than exponential 

growing cells (Dantur and Pizarro, 2004). The influence of growth rate and growth 

phase on bacterial susceptibility to stress seems to be determined by the global regulator 

RpoS, controlling the general stress response in E. coli, whose expression increases with 

decreasing specific growth rate (Notley and Ferenci, 1996; Ihssen and Egli, 2004). 



Chapter 1 

35 

Intrinsic DNA repair potential 

The intrinsic DNA repair potential of bacteria can also influence their 

susceptibility to UV radiation. For example, the enhanced UVB resistance of the marine 

bacterium Photobacterium angustum, compared to that of Sphingopyxis alaskensis, was 

assigned to the presence of three genes coding for DNA photolyase type I enzymes in P. 

angustum compared to only one in S. alaskensis. The presence of additional photolyase 

enzymes in P. angustum was proposed to not only enhance the efficiency for 

photoenzymatic repair but also for nucleotide excision repair (Matallana-Surget et al., 

2009b). The presence of two recA genes was also proposed to account for UV resistance 

in Myxococcus xanthus (Nahrstedt et al., 2005), while two plasmid-encoded recA in 

Deinococcus desertii, in addition to the chromosomal recA, were suggested to provide 

higher levels of RecA protein for efficient error-free repair of DNA damage (Dulermo 

et al., 2009). 

 

The surface microlayer (SML) as a model system for environmental 

photobiology studies 

In the environment, the effects of UVR on aquatic organisms depend on the dose 

of harmful radiation to which individuals are exposed, which in turn depends on 

organism positioning in the water column (Sommaruga, 2003). Thriving at the top 

millimetre of the water column, also known as surface microlayer (SML), 

bacterioneuston is naturally exposed to high levels of solar radiation, including in the 

UV spectrum. However, enhanced bacterial abundance and microbial activity at the 

SML comparatively to underlying waters (Norkrans, 1980; Hardy, 1982; Agogué et al., 

2004) suggest a possible adaptation of bacterioneuston to high levels of UV radiation. 

Several factors have been suggested to contribute to the enhanced resistance of 

bacterioneuston to high levels of solar radiation, including the accumulation of 

exopolysaccharides and chromophoric DOM and POM (particulate organic matter) at 

the air-water interface (Plane et al., 1997; Elasri and Miller, 1999; Whitehead and 

Vernet, 2000; Obernosterer et al., 2005).  

Its location and exposure to high levels of UV radiation make the SML an 

interesting model compartment to investigate the interaction between UV radiation and 

bacteria that can provide relevant predictive information on how bacterial communities 

respond to enhanced levels of UV radiation, in terms of functioning and structure.  



Chapter 1 

36 

As the role of the SML in the regulation of global air-water gas exchange, and 

consequently in global biogeochemistry, has increasingly been recognized in recent 

years (Upstill-Goddard et al., 2003; Calleja et al., 2005; Ploug, 2008; Cunliffe and 

Murrell, 2009; Cunliffe et al., 2011; Dixon and Nightingale, 2012; Cunliffe et al., 

2013), the assessment of the biological responses of bacterioneuston to UVR gains even 

further ecological relevance. 

 

Objectives of this thesis 

The understanding of the significance of UV radiation as a controlling factor of 

bacteria is still limited, since comprehensive mechanistic studies of the targets of UV 

radiation on bacterial cells are scarce. This, in turn, limits the knowledge of the potential 

effects of changes in environmental UV levels in the function and structure of microbial 

communities.  

The following research questions were addressed in this thesis: 

- Does the light history of the bacterial communities from the SML and UW 

influence their UV sensitivity? 

- What are the cellular targets of UV radiation, how are they affected by 

irradiation and do they vary among bacteria? 

- Which ROS are involved in UVB-induced damage to bacteria? 

- Do metals play a role in UVB-induced damage to bacteria? 

- How do extrinsic (quality of the irradiating medium) and intrinsic (growth phase 

and temperature) properties influence the UV sensitivity responses of bacterial 

communities and bacterial isolates? 

- Does RecA evolution reflect an adaptation to withstand stress, including UV 

radiation, in particular bacterial groups? 

 

These questions were addressed by:  

- Studying the effects of UV radiation on natural bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton communities and the photobiological responses of bacterial 

isolates retrieved from the SML and UW in the laboratory (Chapters 2, 3 and 

4).

- Determining the cellular and biological effects of UV radiation of different 

spectral regions in selected environmental bacterial isolates, used as tentative 

biological models (Chapters 5 and 6).  

- Studying the influence of amendment of cell suspensions with ROS scavengers 

and metals on UVB-induced damage (Chapter 7 and 8) 

- Assessing the influence of resuspending bacterial cells in aqueous media with 

different nutrient content and origin in the UV-sensitivity responses of bacterial 

communities and representative isolates (Chapter 9) and studying the influence 

of growth conditions in UV-induced damage (Chapter 10).

recA gene duplication or lateral gene transfer events in the adaptation to UV 

radiation during bacterial evolution (Chapter 11).

Effects of UVB Radiation on the Structural and Physiological Diversity of 

Bacterioneuston and Bacterioplankton

Abstract 

The effects of UV radiation (UVR) on estuarine bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton were assessed in microcosms experiments. Bacterial abundance and 

DNA synthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton. Protein synthesis was more 

inhibited in bacterioneuston. Community analysis indicated that UVR has the potential 

to select resistant bacteria (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria), particularly abundant in 

bacterioneuston. 

 

Introduction 

Global changes over the next decades are expected to increase the exposure of 

aquatic organisms to damaging UV wavelengths, particularly UVB (280-320 nm), with 

far reaching ecological consequences (Andrady et al., 2010). Therefore, a thorough 

understanding of the effects of UV radiation (UVR) on the diversity and function of 

bacterial communities, key players in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems, is 

necessary.  

The effects of UVB on aquatic organisms depend on the dose of harmful 

radiation to which they are exposed that is, in turn, determined by the positioning of the 

organism in the water column (Sommaruga, 2003). The surface microlayer (SML) 

represents a unique microbial niche in which the bacterial community (bacterioneuston) 

is exposed to high doses of solar UVR (Agogué et al., 2005). The higher abundances of 

microorganisms at the SML in comparison to underlying waters (UW) (Agogué et al., 

2004) could indicate that bacterioneuston may have adapted to this “extreme 

environment”, making it an interesting model system for the assessment of UV effects 

on aquatic organisms by testing the hypothesis that bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton respond differently (in terms of abundance, activity, and structural and 

functional diversity) to UVB radiation.

Sampling and experimental setup 

Samples from the SML and UW were collected in triplicate (n = 9) from an 

estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, latitude 40º38’N, longitude 08º46’N) on 

three consecutive days in June 2008. Samples were collected around noon, with clear 

sky and minimum wind (&amp;lt;2 m s-1) and solar radiation levels ranged 30-35 kJ m-2 

(climetua.fis.ua.pt/legacy/main/current_monitor/cesamet.htm). Water properties of the 

original samples are presented as supplementary material (Appendix). Bacterioneuston 

was sampled with glass plates (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). Samples from underlying 

water were taken at the depth of 20 cm. A total of three irradiation experiments (one in 

each day), with triplicate sub-samples, was conducted using unfiltered water samples 

since preliminary experiments did not show a significant effect of grazers on the 

photobiological responses in terms of abundance, activity or diversity of the bacterial 

communities (data not shown). For the experiments, sub-samples were transferred to 

uncovered Petri dishes forming a 1.5 mm layer. Irradiation was conducted with UVB 

lamps (Philips, UVB TL 100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm, pre-burned for 

1 h to ensure stability of light emission) during 4 hours, at room temperature (25 ºC ± 

0.5) with magnetic stirring. The cumulative UVB dose (60 kJ m-2, determined using a 

spectro-radiometer DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) was equivalent to 

ambient surface UVR levels at 40 to 44º N latitude on clear summer solstice days 

(Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Aliquots were collected at pre-determined UVB doses (0, 12, 

24, 36, 48, 60 kJ m-2) for analyses. Dark controls were included in all experiments.

(n = 27) were plotted. Error bars represent standard deviations. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small 

to see on the scale used.

Effects of UVB on abundance and community composition  

Bacterial abundance, determined from colony counts and epifluorescence 

microscopy (Pernthaler et al., 2001), was less reduced (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) in 

bacterioneuston than in bacterioplankton (Fig. 2.1 A, B), indicating enhanced UV 

tolerance of bacterioneuston, as previously observed in experiments with bacterial 

isolates (Santos et al., 2011b). DGGE profiling (Santos et al., 2011a) of 16S rDNA 

sequences showed a reduction in structural diversity (assessed from Shannon diversity 

index) (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) of 14 and 25 % in bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton, respectively (Fig. 2.2) thus demonstrating the relevance of UVB 

radiation as driver of the structure of bacterial communities.  

 

 

Fig. 2.2. Representative DGGE gel of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton exposed to different UVB doses (0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 

kJ m-2), in which sequenced bands are indicated by an arrow. M: marker; N: bacterioneuston; P: bacterioplankton. 

 

Sequencing of selected cloned DGGE bands (supplementary material in 

Appendix) revealed the predominance of ribotypes affiliated to Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi 

(band 1), Firmicutes (band 2) and Gammaproteobacteria (bands 3 and 4) in the original 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton samples. After irradiation, Gammaproteobacteria-

affiliated ribotypes dominated both communities. Two strong bands (identified in Fig. 

2.2 as bands 3 = 9 = 18 and 4 = 20) affiliated to Gammaproteobacteria, persisted 

throughout the irradiation period in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, suggesting 



Chapter 2 

42 

the selection of resistant strains by UVR in both communities. These bands were 

already prominent in the original bacterioneuston sample and occurred with equal 

predominance in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton after irradiation. 

Gammaproteobacteria have already been reported as resistant to UVR (Alonso-Sáez et 

al., 2006).  

 

  

  

Fig. 2.3. Mean relative abundance (expressed as the percentage of total DAPI counts) of specific bacterial groups detected by FISH 

before and after exposure of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton communities to a total dose of 60 kJ m-2 of UVB radiation. Mean 

values (n = 27) were plotted. 

 

The effects of UV exposure on community composition were also studied by 

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes for 

the domain Bacteria (Amann et al., 1990; Daims et al., 1999) and classes 

Alphaproteobacteria (Glöckner et al., 1999), Betaproteobacteria (Manz et al., 1996), 

Gammaproteobacteria (Manz et al., 1996), Cytophaga-like bacteria (Manz et al., 1996) 

and Actinobacteria (Manz et al., 1996). The appropriate controls were included. FISH 

results confirmed the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria in bacterioneuston and an 

increase of up to 10 % (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) in the relative abundance of 

Gammaproteobacteria after irradiation of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (Fig. 

2.3). In general, the different bacterial groups quantified by FISH followed a similar 

trend of variation in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (supplementary material in 



Chapter 2 

43 

Appendix), with the exception of Actinobacteria, which increased in abundance by 32.2 

% in bacterioneuston during irradiation, remaining un-affected in bacterioplankton. 

Actinobacteria have been proposed to be genetically adapted to high UV levels 

(Warnecke et al., 2005). The results suggest that bacterioneuston may contain a pool of 

UV-resistant bacteria that are selected for upon UV exposure.  

 

  

Fig. 2.4. UVB dose-dependent variation of (A) leucine incorporation (protein synthesis) and (B) thymidine incorporation (DNA 

synthesis). Results are expressed as % of the dark controls. Mean values were plotted. Error bars represent standard deviations. 

Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used.  

 

Effects of UVB on activity 

The rates of leucine and thymidine incorporation were used as proxies for 

protein and DNA synthesis, respectively (Moriarty, 1986; Simon and Azam, 1989). 

Leucine incorporation was more affected by UVB in bacterioneuston (Fig. 2.4 A), while 

thymidine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioplankton (Fig. 2.4 B) (1-way 

ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Reducing protein synthesis upon UVB exposure could be a 

metabolic strategy to enhance survival, as actively growing bacteria are more 

susceptible to stress (Fischer and Sauer, 2005) and this could underlie the lower impact 

of UVB on bacterioneuston abundance. 

The effect of UVR on the physiological profiles of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton assessed with Biolog EcoPlatesTM (Sala et al., 2010) revealed a shift in 

the spectrum of carbon sources used, as well as substantial differences in the metabolic 

profiles of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton before and after UV exposure (Fig. 

2.5). In bacterioneuston, UV exposure resulted in a 31.2 %, 14.4 % and 6.3 % decrease 

in the use of amino acids, amines and carboxylic acids and an increase in consumption 

of carbohydrates and phenolic compounds by 42.3 % and 11.6 %, respectively. In 

bacterioplankton, irradiation caused a decrease in the utilization of carbohydrates and 



Chapter 2 

44 

phenolic compounds by 21.7 and 42.9 %, respectively, and an increase in consumption 

of amino acids and carboxylic acids by 42.2 and 22.5 %, respectively.

In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that UV radiation has clear effects 

on the structure and function of estuarine bacterial communities and that the SML 

environment may select for a bacterial community metabolically adapted to high UV 

exposure.

Abstract 

Aims: To assess the variability in the UVB (280-320 nm) sensitivity of bacterial isolates 

from the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (UW) of the Ria de Aveiro 

(Portugal) estuary and their ability to recover from previous UV-induced stress.  

Methods and Results: Bacterial cell suspensions were exposed to UVB radiation (3.3 W 

m-2). Effects on culturability were assessed from colony counts and effects on activity 

determined from [3H]leucine incorporation rates. Among the nine isolates tested a wide 

variability in terms of UVB-induced inhibition of culturability (37.4-99.3 %) and 

activity (36.0-98.0 %) was observed. Incubation of UVB-irradiated cell suspensions 

under reactivating regimes (UVA, 3.65 W m-2; PAR, 40 W m-2; dark) also revealed 

diversity in the extent of recovery from UVB stress. Trends of enhanced resistance of 

culturability (up to 15 %) and enhanced recovery in activity (up to 52 %) were observed 

in bacterioneuston isolates. 

Conclusions: Bacterioneuston isolates were less sensitive and recovered more rapidly 

from UVB stress than bacterioplankton isolates, showing enhanced reduction of their 

metabolism during the irradiation period and decreased culturability during the recovery 

process compared to bacterioplankton. 

Significance and Impact of the Study: UV exposure can affect the diversity and activity 

of microbial communities by selecting UV-resistant strains and alter their metabolic 

activity towards protective strategies. 

 

Introduction 

Since the discovery of the stratospheric ozone hole, concerns regarding the 

ecological consequences of UV radiation have extensively increased (Häder et al., 

2007). In the face of a changing global environment, the assessment of the toxic nature 



Chapter 3 

46 

of UV radiation, most notably in the UVB wavelength (280-320 nm) that is expected to 

increase as a result of the interaction of changes in UVB fluxes resulting from ozone 

depletion and other climate changes (Andrady et al., 2010), has gained pertinence. 

Bacteria play a key role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems (Azam and 

Malfatti, 2007), but their small size, short generation times and the fact that their 

genome comprehends a large portion of the cell volume, might make them more 

susceptible to the effects of UV radiation than higher organisms (Garcia-Pichel, 1994).  

The main biological effect of UVB results from UV-induced formation of 

covalent links between adjacent pyrimidine residues, known as cyclobutane pyrimidine 

dimers. These dimers cannot be replicated and are lethal to the cell, unless damage is 

repaired (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). In response to UV-induced damage, bacteria 

have evolved several repair mechanisms that can basically be divided in dark repair and 

photoreactivation, a light-dependent repair mechanism that uses the photolyase enzyme, 

activated by UVA (320-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 to 

700 nm) (Walker, 1984).  

Located at the air-water interface, the surface microlayer (SML) represents a 

stressful environment for microorganisms, where pollutants and heavy metals 

accumulate due to its lipophilic nature, and the intensity of solar UV radiation is at its 

highest (Maki, 1993). Adding to their individual effects, pollutants and UV radiation 

can also act additively or synergistically on aquatic microbes (Pelletier et al., 2006), 

through the generation of photo-oxidative products that might impose an additional 

stress on bacterioneuston, i.e., bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer. Reports of 

higher bacterial abundance and activities at the SML (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002) have 

suggested enhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to stress, most notably, UV-related. 

However, such a trend has not yet been demonstrated, and recent work has indicated 

similar UV resistance in bacterial isolates from the SML and underlying water (UW) 

(Agogué et al., 2005), though the authors only monitored the optical density of the 

cultures after the irradiation period. To our knowledge, information on the variability of 

the responses of bacterioneuston isolates in terms of culturability and activity, as well as 

their repair potential under different reactivating regimes following UV exposure, is 

virtually inexistent.  

The aim of this work was the characterization and comparative analysis of the 

sensitivity of bacterial isolates from the SML and UW of the estuarine system Ria de 

Aveiro (Portugal) and the assessment of their repair potential under different light 



Chapter 3 

47 

regimes after UVB exposure. The variability in the extent of UV-induced inactivation 

and the influence of different light regimes on the recovery of selected bacterial isolates 

following UVB stress were determined in laboratory experiments using artificial 

radiation.  

 

Materials and methods 

Sampling and isolation of marine bacterial strains  

Bacterial strains were isolated from the SML and UW of the estuarine system 

Ria de Aveiro, located in the western coast of Portugal. Samples from the SML were 

collected using a glass plate sampler (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). Samples from 

underlying waters were collected by submerging a polycarbonate bottle and opening it 

at a depth of 0.5 m. For the isolation of UV-resistant bacteria from the SML and UW, 

samples from both water layers were exposed to UVB doses between 0 and 2200 J m-2 

(Philips UVB TL 100 W/01 lamp, maximum emission peak at 302 nm; intensity of 3.3 

W m-2), with agitation (50 rpm) and at ~20 ºC, as described by Zenoff, et al. (2006). 

Sample aliquots (100 µ L) were removed at pre-determined intervals and plated in 

marine agar 2216 plates (MA 2216; Difco, Detroit, Mich.). After incubation in the dark 

at 20°C for 7 to 14 days, isolates were selected from the plates according to 

morphological differences and purified. Molecular typing of the isolates was performed 

by BOX-PCR, according to the procedure described by Rademaker, et al. (2004) and 

isolates displaying distinct BOX profiles were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA 

gene using the primer 27F and an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing 

Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were 

compared with sequences available in the GenBank database by using the BLAST 

(Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) service to determine their approximate 

phylogenetic affiliations (Altschul et al., 1990). The sequences obtained were deposited 

in the GenBank database (see Table 3.1 for accession numbers). 

 

Preparation of cell suspensions and irradiation conditions  

Bacterial isolates growing in marine broth were harvested during the exponential 

phase by centrifugation (3,200 x g, 15 min) and the pellet was washed three times with 

filtered-sterilized autoclaved seawater to remove all traces of the culture medium. Cells 

were resuspended in filtered-sterilized autoclaved seawater and bacterial abundance was 



Chapter 3 

48 

adjusted to 106 cells mL-1, as determined by epifluorescent microscopy counts. Bacterial 

suspensions were transferred to sterile plates (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY) 

without the lid and irradiated under the UVB source used for the initial isolation for 20 

min (corresponding to a final UVB dose of 3.931 kJ m-2). During irradiation, samples 

were kept at ~20 ºC and incubated under slow shaking (50 rpm). All experiments were 

conducted in the absence of ambient light to minimize photoreactivation. After 

irradiation, appropriate dilutions were plated on marine agar (MA 2216, Difco, Detroit, 

Mich.). Each experiment was conducted with triplicate replicates in four independent 

times.

Repair potential 

To determine the repair properties of the bacteria, UVB-irradiated cell 

suspensions were subjected to three different treatments: (i) photoreactivation with 

PAR, provided by white cool lamps (13.44 W m-2; Philips TLD 58 W/84), (ii) UVA 

provided by Philips TL 100W/10R lamps (wavelength range 350 to 400 nm; intensity 

3.65 W m-2), and (iii) darkness, by incubating the suspensions in the dark. Aliquots of 

samples were collected before and after incubation of the cells for 60 and 180 min under 

the different recovery regimes for culturable counts and bacterial activity assessment. 

Each experiment was conducted with triplicate replicates in four independent times. 



Chapter 3 

49 

Culturable counts  

The UV-inactivation kinetics was followed by collecting triplicate 100 µ L 

aliquots at pre-determined intervals. Aliquots were serially diluted in aged 0.2 µ m 

filtered autoclaved sea-water and plated in Marine agar 2216 plates (Difco). Colonies 

were counted after 2-7 days of incubation in the dark at 20 ºC. The fraction of surviving 

cells was calculated by dividing the number of CFU in the treated sample by the number 

of CFU in the unirradiated sample at time zero. The dilution and plating procedures 

were carried out under low-luminosity conditions to avoid photoreactivation.  

 

Bacterial activity 

The bacterial activity of cell suspensions before irradiation, after irradiation and 

after reactivation was assessed from the rates of protein synthesis estimated by the 

incorporation of [3H]leucine (Amersham, specific activity 63.0 Ci mmol-1) into bacterial 

protein at 480 nM final concentration in triplicate aliquots (1.5 mL) and one 

trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) fixed blank (2 % final concentration). 

After 1 hour of incubation in the dark, proteins were precipitated by addition of 20 % 

TCA and samples were centrifuged. TCA-washed pellets were resuspended in 1.5 mL 

of Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, USA). The radioactivity 

incorporated into bacterial cells was counted in a Packard Tri-Carb 2000 Liquid 

Scintillation Counter using the external standard ratio technique (Simon and Azam, 

1989). 

 

Results  

In this study, UV-resistant strains isolated after irradiation of samples from the 

SML and UW were used to assess the variability of UVB sensitivity and recovery 

potential in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates. UVB-induced inhibition of 

culturability ranged from 37.4 % in Micrococcus sp. (NT25I3.2AA) (Fig. 3.1 A) to 99.3 

% in Staphylococcus sp. (NT25I2.1) (Fig. 3.1 E).

Under the UVA and PAR regimes, recovery of culturability (up to 90.0 % of the 

initial value) was observed for 8 out of 9 of the isolates tested (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). 

Recovery in bacterial culturability (up to 98.0 % of the initial value) was also observed 

under the dark regime for 6 out of the 9 isolates tested (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). The 

bacterioneuston isolates Micrococcus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA (73.5 %) (Fig. 3.1 A) and 

Paracoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A (99.0 %) (Fig. 3.1 B) showed the highest efficiencies 

in the recovery of bacterial culturability under the UVA and dark regimes, respectively, 

while the bacterioplankton isolate Bacillus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA (90.0 %) (Fig. 3.2 B) 

recovered the most under the PAR regime. In general, significant differences between 

the patterns of recovery under the different light regimes were not detected. However, 

when considering the SML and UW in separate, differences emerged. For SML isolates, 

the most favourable light regime for the recovery of bacterial culturability was UVA 

(average recovery of 11.4 %), while PAR induced the lowest recovery rate (6.4 %). For 

bacterioplankton isolates, PAR led to the highest recovery rates (9.5 %), while the 

lowest recovery was observed under UVA irradiation (4.6 %). 



Chapter 3

Bacterial activity also recovered, at variable extensions (0 to 78.4 %), under the 

different light regimes (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). In general, UVA radiation was the most 

favourable light regime (up to 78.4 %) in the recovery of bacterial activity, while 

significant differences between recovery under PAR (up to 14.6 %) and in the dark (up 

to 17.2 %) were not found (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). Bacterioneuston isolates 

Paracoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A (78.4 %) (Fig. 3.1 B) and Pseudomonas sp. strain 

NT5I1.2B (14.6 %) (Fig. 3.1 C) showed the highest recovery rates in bacterial activity 

under the UVA and PAR regime, while the planktonic isolate Bacillus sp. strain 

PT15I3.2CB (17.2 %) (Fig. 3.2 B) recovered the most under the dark regime. When 

considering the compartment from which the bacterial isolates were retrieved, the 

patterns observed for bacterial culturability were maintained, though for 

bacterioplankton isolates, significant differences were observed in the extent of the 

recovery in the dark and under UVA radiation (twice as high than under the dark 

regime).  

 

Discussion 

Several studies on UV sensitivity and recovery potential in bacteria present in 

diverse aquatic environments have been carried out (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 

2000; Agogué et al., 2005). However, to our knowledge, no information exists on the 

diversity of the UV responses of bacterioneuston isolates in terms of culturability, 

activity and recovery from previous UV-induced stress. Therefore, in this study the 

variability in the UV-sensitivity and recovery potential of selected UV-resistant 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates was assessed under standardized 

experimental conditions using a number of isolates similar to previous studies (Joux et 

al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b). 

Exposure to UVB radiation revealed considerable variability in sensitivity to UV 

stress among the tested isolates, in agreement with previous reports in different aquatic 

environments (Arrieta et al., 2000; Ordoñez et al., 2009). Micrococcus sp. 

(NT25I3.2AA) showed the smallest reduction in culturability upon UVB exposure. 

High UV resistance of several Micrococcus strains isolated from other UV-exposed 

environments is well documented (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; Ordoñez et al., 

2009). The characteristically high G+C content of Actinobacteria has been proposed to 

confer a protective effect against UV radiation, by protecting DNA against damage by 

thymidine dimerization (Singer and Ames, 1970). However, recent work by Matallana-



Chapter 3 

53 

Surget, et al. (2008) has suggested that microorganisms with high G+C content could, 

in fact, be more prone to UV-induced mutations, since cytosine containing 

photoproducts are highly mutagenic. The determinants of UV-resistance in Micrococcus 

sp. remain, therefore, unknown. 

Considerable differences were also observed in the extent of UV-induced 

inhibition of bacterial activity probably as a result of differences in the extent of the 

damage inflicted to bacterial membranes. The observation that Staphylococcus sp. 

(NT25I2.1) was the strain most inhibited in terms of culturability but less inhibited in 

terms of activity is intriguing, since one would expect the two biological parameters to 

be correlated. A similar trend was also observed in Micrococcus sp. (NT25I3.2AA) that 

was least affected in terms of culturability but was the second most affected strain in 

terms of activity (80.4 % inhibition), as assessed from the rates of leucine incorporation. 

A possible explanation would be the induction of a metabolic shift from growth (protein 

synthesis) to survival upon UVB exposure, recently proposed to occur in Bacillus 

cereus in response to acid stress (Mols et al., 2010). However, further studies are needed 

to reveal if such a response also occurs upon UVB stress.  

The most important biological effects of UVB radiation are probably a 

consequence of the stalling of replication fork complexes by UVB-induced DNA 

lesions that block replisome movement or the synthesis by the polymerase subunits. 

Therefore, the ability of bacteria to survive UVB radiation is closely related to their 

ability to either bypass or correct such damaged DNA segments (Friedberg, 1985).  

Following UVB exposure, the recovery potential of the bacterial isolates was 

assessed under different light regimes. UVA and PAR were the most effective regimes 

in the recovery of culturability, but recovery under the dark regime was also observed 

for most isolates. Such observation demonstrates the importance of photoreactivation, 

and particularly the enzyme photolyase, in the recovery from UVB stress, in accordance 

to previous studies (Kaiser and Herndl, 1997). The importance of photoreactivation for 

bacterial communities to cope with UV-induced damage might be related to its extreme 

efficiency, splitting approximately one dimer for every blue-light photon absorbed. 

Furthermore, unlike dark repair, photoreactivation does not require energy mobilization 

and may be particularly important in nutrient-limited aquatic microbial populations 

(Joux et al., 1999). Recovery in terms of bacterial activity was also observed under the 

different light regimes, demonstrating that UV-induced impairment of biological 



Chapter 3 

54 

functions was not irreversible being, in general, UVA the most effective light regime for 

activity recovery.  

Though the number of isolates used in this study is too small to attempt the 

establishment of a correlation between the origin of the isolates and their UV sensitivity, 

some trends were in fact identified. For example, UV-induced reductions in bacterial 

culturability were up to 15 % lower in bacterioneuston, which might indicate the 

presence of bacteria displaying enhanced resistance to UV radiation at the SML. The 

average recovery in terms of culturability was generally higher in bacterioplankton 

isolates (up to 76 %) than in bacterioneuston for all light regimes. On the other hand, in 

terms of activity, the recovery was higher in bacterioneuston (up to 52 %) under all the 

reactivating conditions tested. The observation of enhanced recovery in activity 

accompanied by reduced recovery in culturability in bacterioneuston isolates could 

indicate the engagement in a viable but non culturable condition as a stress response 

and/or defence mechanism that allows for the rapid re-establishment of bacterial activity 

when UV exposure is terminated. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, 

in some cases, the UV-induced decrease in total cell numbers, determined by 

epifluorescence microscopy counts of acridine orange-stained preparations, was much 

lower than the one of CFU numbers (data not shown). Such a strategy has been 

reported, for example, in species of the genus Vibrio sp. upon exposure to thermal, 

saline and acidic stress (Wong and Wang, 2004).  

While addressing the resistance of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton strains 

to solar UV radiation, by directly isolating culturable bacteria from the SML and 

underlying waters and monitoring the optical density of the irradiated cells, Agogué, et 

al. (2005) concluded that UV resistance was similarly distributed in bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton. In fact, several studies have indicated that the bacterial community 

structure of both compartments itself is similar and that the neustonic community might 

arise from the passive accumulation of members of the planktonic populations at the air-

water interface (Joux et al., 2006). In this study, an alternative approach was used, in 

which samples from the SML and UW were exposed to UVB radiation and the UV-

resistant species were isolated (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006a). While the ecological 

information retrieved from studies with culturable bacteria is considered limited, this 

alternative approach is likely to provide a new, ecologically relevant perspective on 

UV-sensitivity and resistance among culturable bacteria, since these strains are likely 

the most relevant members of the culturable community upon exposure to UVB-induced 



Chapter 3 

55 

stress, and their metabolic strategies may drive the functioning of the communities 

under UVB stress conditions. 

By the selective elimination of sensitive phenotypes and the enrichment in 

resistant strains, differences in the UV-sensitivity of bacteria inhabiting the SML and 

underlying waters seem to emerge, that can indicate the presence of UV-resistant 

members in the bacterioneuston population.

The UV Responses of Bacterioneuston and Bacterioplankton Isolates Depend on 

the Physiological Condition and Involve a Metabolic Shift

Abstract 

Bacteria from the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying waters (UW) were 

isolated upon exposure to UVB radiation and their individual UV sensitivity in terms of 

CFU numbers, activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon source use 

profiles, repair potential (light-dependent and independent), and photoadaptation 

potential, under different physiological conditions, was compared.  

Colony counts were 11.5-16.2 % more reduced by UVB exposure in 

bacterioplankton isolates (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Inhibition of leucine incorporation 

in bacterioneuston isolates was 10.9-11.5 % higher than in bacterioplankton (1-way 

ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). These effects were accompanied by a shift in sole-carbon source 

use profiles, assessed with Biolog EcoPlatesTM, with a reduction in consumption of 

amines and amino acids and increased use of polymers, particularly in bacterioneuston 

isolates. Recovery under starvation was generally enhanced compared to nourished 

conditions, especially in bacterioneuston isolates. Overall, only insignificant increases 

in the induction of antibiotic resistant mutant phenotypes (RifR and NalR) were 

observed. In general, a potential for photoadaptation could not be detected among the 

tested isolates.  

These results indicate that UV effects on bacteria are influenced by their 

physiological condition and are accompanied by a shift in metabolic profiles, more 

significant in bacterioneuston isolates, suggesting the presence of bacterial strains 

adapted to high UV levels in the SML. 

 

Introduction 

Among the different factors that affect bacteria, solar UV radiation (UVR) (280-

400 nm) could be particularly deleterious because of their simple haploid genomes with 

little or no functional redundancy and their small size which precludes the accumulation 

of protective pigments (Garcia-Pichel, 1994). The importance of microorganisms in 



Chapter 4 

58 

global biogeochemical cycles and the expected increases in the exposure of aquatic 

organisms to damaging UV wavelengths over the course of the next decades (Andrady 

et al., 2010) makes the study of the interaction between UV radiation and 

microorganisms a timely subject. 

Studies of photobiological responses of marine bacterial isolates have shown 

large variability in their sensitivity to UVR (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; 

Agogué et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2011b). UV-induced changes in bacterial production, 

growth, survival and species composition, through the selection of phototolerant strains 

or by inducing photoadaptation, can, in turn, cause changes in the trophodynamics of 

microbial communities (Arrieta et al., 2000; Winter et al., 2001).  

The toxic effects of UVB radiation are considered to be, for the most part, the 

result of the absorption of photons by DNA, resulting in DNA photoproducts that block 

DNA replication and RNA transcription and, left unrepaired, can lead to cell death 

(Walker, 1984). Additionally, absorption of UV radiation by endogenous (e.g., 

porphyrins, nicotinamide coenzymes) and exogenous (e.g., humic substances and 

photosynthetic pigments) photosensitizers can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen 

species and cause oxidative damage, potentially impairing bacterial activity and 

viability (Baxter and Carey, 1983; Cooper et al., 1988; Glaeser et al., 2010).  

In response to UV-induced damage, bacteria have evolved several DNA repair 

mechanisms that can basically be divided in dark repair and light-dependent repair. At 

least three dark repair mechanisms can be found in bacteria: (1) nucleotide excision 

repair (NER), (2) post-replication recombinational repair and (3) error-prone or 

mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) (Walker, 1984). The latter involves the activation of low 

fidelity repair polymerases, which are able to perform translesion DNA synthesis across 

damaged regions, at the expenses of an increased mutation rate (Goodman, 2002; 

Rattray and Strathern, 2003) and seems to confer an ecological advantage for 

microorganisms inhabiting UV-exposed habitats (Sundin and Murillo, 1999). Light-

dependent repair, also known as photoenzymatic repair (PER) (Walker, 1984), uses a 

photolyase enzyme that can be activated by UVA (320-400 nm) and photosynthetic 

active radiation (PAR) (400-700 nm) (Sancar, 1994). 

Variability in UV sensitivity among bacterial strains is mainly determined by 

differences in intrinsic susceptibility and/or defence and repair strategies in response to 

damage. However, several intrinsic factors such as the nutritional state (Nyström et al., 

1992) and growth phase (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010), or 



Chapter 4 

59 

external factors like temperature (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010) can also influence UV 

sensitivity.  

The bacterioneuston inhabits the surface microlayer (SML), i.e. the top 

millimetre of the water column, being naturally exposed to high levels of solar 

radiation, including in the UV spectrum. Reports of enhanced prokaryote abundance at 

the SML in comparison to underlying waters (UW) (Agogué et al., 2004; Aller et al., 

2005; Obernosterer et al., 2005; Joux et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2009) have raised the 

possibility of the presence of bacterial strains adapted to multi-stress conditions, 

including UV radiation, at the air-water interface. However, experimental testing of the 

individual sensitivity of strains isolated from the SML and UW did not confirm the 

different resistance to solar radiation of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates 

(Agogué et al., 2005). A more ecologically relevant approach to address UV resistance 

in natural bacterial communities can be the preliminary selection and isolation of UVB-

resistant strains, likely to be relevant in the functioning of the communities under 

increased UVB stress conditions (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b).  

The hypotheses of this work are: (1) UV-resistant bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton isolates respond differently to UV radiation, in terms of damage, repair 

and potential for photoadaptation; (2) physiological/nutritional conditioning (starvation 

versus nourishment) affects the photobiological responses of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton isolates; and (3) the pattern of photobiological responses is related to 

the environment of origin of the isolates. 

 

Materials and methods 

Sampling 

Samples from the SML and UW were collected at Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), a 

tidal estuary in the western coast of Portugal. Sampling was conducted on three 

sequential days in 2008, shortly after the summer solstice, when UVB levels are the 

highest (Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Daily solar radiation doses on the period of sampling 

in the South of Europe range 30-35 kJ m-2 (Abboudi et al., 2008). At the time of 

sampling the sky was clear and minimum wind conditions (&amp;lt;2 m s-1) were observed. 

Triplicate samples with three sub-samples (n = 9) were collected in each sampling 

moment. Bacterioneuston samples were collected using a 0.25 m wide x 0.35 m 

Plexiglas plate, which removes the upper 60-100 µ m water layer (Harvey and Burzell, 

1972). Samples from underlying water were taken directly by submerging sterile glass 



Chapter 4 

60 

bottles at the depth of approximately 20 cm. Water samples, kept at 4 ºC and in the 

shade, were processed within 3 h of collection. 

 

Kinetics of community photoinactivation and isolation of UV-resistant bacteria 

Samples (30 mL) from the SML (n = 9) and from UW (n = 9) were transferred to 

uncovered 150 mm-diameter Petri dishes and irradiated with UVB (Philips, UVB TL 

100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm, pre-burned for 1 h to ensure stability of 

light emission), with magnetic stirring, at 25 ± 0.5 ºC. UV intensities were measured 

with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, 

Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK). The inactivation kinetics of whole bacterioneuston 

and bacterioplankton communities was assessed until an accumulated UVB dose of 120 

kJ m-2. Aliquots were taken at pre-determined intervals to monitor the dose-dependent 

variation of culturable counts during irradiation, as described below. After incubation in 

the dark at 25 °C for up to 7 days, colonies were counted and the log of survival was 

plotted as a function of the energy dose. UVB-resistant isolates were selected from the 

best dilution of plates corresponding to a cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2, which is 

equivalent to ambient surface UVR levels at 40 to 44º N latitude on sunny days near the 

summer solstice (Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Colonies were selected according to colour 

and shape and streak-plated at least three times for purification. The purity of the strains 

was verified by microscopic observation after Gram-staining. Pure isolates were 

transferred to marine broth 2216 (MA 2216; Difco, Detroit, Mich.) and the cultures 

were used for subsequent molecular characterization.  

 

Molecular characterization of the strains 

Bacterial isolates were grown in marine broth on a laboratory shaker at 25°C. 

Cells from stationary phase cultures in marine broth were collected by centrifugation 

(3,200 x g for 15 min) and the pellet was used for total genomic DNA extraction, as 

previously described (Henriques et al., 2006b). BOX-PCR fingerprinting was used for 

molecular typing of the isolates using the BOX A1R primer (5’-

CTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGACG-3’) (Versalovic et al., 1994) as previously 

described (Rademaker et al., 2004). 

For isolates displaying distinct BOX-PCR profiles, the 16S rRNA gene was 

amplified by PCR using primers 27F (59-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and 

1492R (59-GG TTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39) as previously described (Lane, 1991). 



Chapter 4 

61 

The PCR products were purified (Jetquick PCR Purification Kit, GENOMED Gmbh, 

L?hne, Germany) and used as templates in the sequencing reactions, carried out using 

the primer 27F at an external laboratory (StabVida, Oeiras, Portugal). All PCR reactions 

were performed in an iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, 

USA) using Taq polymerase, nucleotides and buffers purchased from MBI Fermentas 

(Vilnius, Lithuania). Sequences were compared with sequences available in the 

GenBank database by using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) service to 

determine their approximate phylogenetic affiliations (Altschul et al., 1990). The 16S 

rRNA gene sequences obtained (&gt; 430 nucleotides) along with those of related bacteria 

deposited in GenBank were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The analysis was 

performed by the neighbour-joining method (Kimura two-parameter distance optimized 

criteria) using MEGA version 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011). The robustness of the tree was 

confirmed by bootstrap analysis based on 1000 resamplings. Nucleotide sequences 

generated in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under the 

accession numbers GQ365194-GQ365211 and GU084169-GU084170. 

 

Preparation of the isolates for the irradiation experiments  

To establish nourished conditions, bacterial isolates were grown in marine broth 

on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) at 25 °C until late-exponential phase. For starvation 

experiments, cells were grown in minimal nine-salt solution glucose medium (MNSS) 

containing 4.0 g L-1 of glucose, 2.2 g L-1 of (NH4)2SO4, and 0.54 g L
-1 of K2HPO4, as 

previously described (Nyström et al., 1992). The starvation regime was imposed by 

harvesting 5 mL of an exponentially growing culture by rapid filtration through a 

Millipore filter (pore size, 0.45 µ m), washing the cells twice and ressuspending in 0.2-

µ m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved seawater, followed by a 40 h incubation on an orbital 

shaker (100 rpm) at 25°C (Nyström et al., 1992). 

Cells grown under the different nutritional conditions were harvested by 

centrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, 20 ºC) and the pellet was washed three times in 

0.2-µ m-pore-size-filtered, autoclaved aged seawater. Cells were resuspended in 0.2-µ m-

pore-size-filtered, autoclaved seawater. Bacterial abundance was determined by 

epifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et al., 1977) and adjusted with 0.2-µ m-pore-size-

filtered autoclaved seawater to 106 cells mL -1.

Experimental testing of isolated strains 

Irradiation experiments 

A convenient volume of cell suspension for each isolate was transferred to 150 

mm-diameter Petri dishes so that the depth of the liquid was &amp;lt;2 mm. The lid was 

removed from the culture plate and the bacterial suspension was irradiated as previously 

described for whole SML and UW samples with a total dose of 60 kJ m-2. Dark controls 

were covered with aluminium foil and included in all experiments. Each experiment 

was conducted with triplicate replicates and repeated in three independent moments. 

Culturable counts and activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation rates and sole-

carbon source use profiles) were assessed as described below.  

 

Recovery experiments 

To assess cell recovery, UVB-irradiated cell suspensions were subjected to three 

different treatments: (i) exposure to PAR provided by white cold lamps (Philips TLD 58 

W/84, total dose of 193.6 kJ m-2), (ii) exposure to UVA provided by Philips TL 

100W/10R lamps (wavelength range 350 to 400 nm, total dose of 52.6 kJ m-2), (iii) 

incubation in the dark for 4 hours. Aliquots of the cell suspensions were collected 

before and after incubation under the different recovery regimes for culturable counts 

and leucine and thymidine incorporation assessments.  

For mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) assays, 1-mL aliquots of UVB-irradiated cell 

suspensions were added to 1 mL of 2 x LB medium (Difco BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) 

and grown for 12 h in total darkness with shaking. Appropriate dilutions were then 

plated on LB agar, and on LB agar containing either nalidixic acid (100 µ g mL-1) or 

rifampin (75 µ g mL-1) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The salinity of LB medium was 

adjusted to 36 PSU to correspond to that of marine broth routinely used for the 

maintenance of the cultures. The frequency of mutation to nalidixic acid resistance 

(NalR) and rifampin resistance (RifR) was calculated as the number of NalR or RifR 

mutants per 108 cells as previously described (Zhang and Sundin, 2004). 

 

Photoadaptation experiments 

In order to identify UVB photoadaptive responses, the procedure described by 

Joux et al. (1999) was adopted. Briefly, cell suspensions were irradiated under UVB 

(Philips, UVB TL 100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm) for a total dose of 60 

kJ m-2. Cell suspensions were subsequently exposed to UVA for a total dose of 52.6 kJ 



Chapter 4 

63 

m-2, which was followed by a 10 hour period of incubation in the dark. Cell suspensions 

were then subjected to a second round of UVB radiation for a total dose of 60 kJ m-2. At 

every point in the procedure, aliquots of cell suspensions were removed for the 

determination of culturable counts.  

 

Biological parameters 

Culturable counts 

Triplicate 100 µ L aliquots were collected before and after irradiation, serially 

diluted in 0.2-µm-pore-size-filtered autoclaved seawater and pour-plated in marine agar 

2216 (Difco, Detroit, Mich.). Colonies were counted after 7 days of incubation in the 

dark at 25 ºC. The dilution and plating procedures were carried out under low-

luminosity conditions to avoid photoreactivation.  

 

Leucine and thymidine incorporation 

The effects of UV irradiation on bacterial activity were estimated by the 

incorporation of [3H]leucine (Simon and Azam, 1989)and [3H]thymidine (Moriarty, 

1986). Triplicate 1.5 mL samples and one blank (TCA-fixed sample) were incubated 

with a mixture of [3H]leucine or [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Specific Activity 64 Ci 

mmol?1) and the equivalent nonradioactive substrate at final saturating concentrations of 

485 and 456 nM, respectively. Samples were incubated in the dark at 25 ± 0.5 ºC for 1 

h. Incubations were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final 

concentration of 5 %, after which samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. 

After discarding the supernatant, 1.5 mL of 5 % TCA were added and the samples were 

subsequently shaken vigorously on a vortex and centrifuged again. The supernatant was 

discarded and 1.5 mL of UniverSol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, 

USA) were added. The radioactivity incorporated in bacterial cells was measured after 3 

days in a Beckman LS 6000 IC liquid scintillation counter using the external standard 

ratio technique (Fuhrman and Azam, 1982; Simon and Azam, 1989). 

 

Sole-carbon source use profiles 

Customized Biolog EcoPlatesTM containing 31 ecologically relevant C sources 

(6 amino acids, 2 amines, 10 carbohydrates, 7 carboxylic acids, 2 phenolic acids and 4 

polymers) were used to assess changes in bacterial metabolic profiles during UVB 

exposure. For operational constraints, the effect of UV exposure on sole-carbon source 



Chapter 4 

64 

use profiles was only assayed under nourished conditions in representative strains of 

each genus retrieved (Acinetobacter sp. strain PT5I1.2G, Bacillus sp. strain 

PT15I3.2CB, Brevibacterium sp. strain PT5I3.3L, Micrococcus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA, 

Paracoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A, Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, Psychrobacter 

sp. strain PT15I3.2CA, Sphingomonas sp. NT15I1.2B, Staphylococcus sp. strain 

NT25I2.1). 

Biolog EcoPlatesTM were inoculated with 150 µ L of cell suspension 

(unirradiated and irradiated) per well (OD600 = 0.2) and incubated for 72 hours at 25 ºC. 

After incubation, the optical density (OD) of the Biolog EcoPlateTM wells was measured 

using the microplate reader FL 600 (Bio-Tek, VE). The OD of the control well was 

subtracted from the OD of all the other wells to correct for background activity. Data 

were exported into Microsoft Excel and treated using standard software (Garland and 

Mills, 1991).  

 

Statistical analysis 

All experiments were repeated in three independent assays and parameters were 

always determined in triplicate. Differences between treatments were assessed by 1-way 

ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess 

homogeneity of variances. If variances were not homogeneous, the non-parametric 

Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall effect of treatment. Differences with p 

values &amp;lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.  

 

Results 

Kinetics of community photoinactivation and isolation of UV-resistant strains 

In bacterioplankton, irradiation with a 72 kJ m-2 dose resulted in the reduction of 

CFU concentration to the detection limit. Complete inactivation of bacterioneuston 

occurred with a dose of 120 kJ m-2. Exposure to 60 kJ m-2 of UVB radiation resulted in 

a 1 log and 2 log reduction in CFU counts in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, 

respectively (Fig. 4.1).  

A total of 21 distinct isolates resistant to up to 60 kJ m-2 (10 from the SML and 

11 from the UW) were retrieved and identified. Isolates were affiliated with the genera 

Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, 

Psychrobacter, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus (Table 4.1). The 16S rRNA gene

Irradiation experiments with isolated strains 

Culturable counts 

In the set of isolates tested, the average reduction of CFU counts (Fig. 4.3 A) by 

UVB irradiation was significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) higher in 

bacterioplankton (63.9 ± 12.5 %) than in bacterioneuston (52.4 ± 13.0 %). Under 

starvation, the average reduction of colony counts was significantly (1-way ANOVA, p 

&amp;lt;0.05) higher in both bacterioplankton (76.0 ± 11.1 %) and bacterioneuston (59.8 ± 

13.2 %), compared to nourished conditions, and also significantly higher in 

bacterioplankton than in bacterioneuston (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

Leucine and thymidine incorporation 

The reduction of leucine incorporation was stronger (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) 

in bacterioneuston (38.5 ± 15.8 %) than in bacterioplankton (27.6 ± 10.0 %) isolates. 

Starvation did not significantly alter (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) the effect of irradiation 

on leucine incorporation neither in bacterioneuston (39.3 ± 16.6 %) nor in 

bacterioplankton (28.7 ± 13.5 %) isolates (Fig. 4.3 B). The average inhibition of 

thymidine incorporation was similar in the sets of bacterioneuston (15.3 ± 9.6 %) and 

bacterioplankton isolates (16.3 ± 4.6 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 4.3 C). Under 



Chapter 4 

66 

starvation, inhibition of thymidine incorporation was significantly enhanced compared 

to nourished conditions and was higher in bacterioneuston isolates (30.2 ± 15.0 %) than 

in bacterioplankton (22.1 ± 10.9 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 4.3 C). In the set 

of bacterioneuston isolates, the incorporation of leucine was more inhibited than the 

incorporation of thymidine (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). In bacterioplankton, the effect 

of irradiation was similar for the two monomers.

Sole-carbon source use profiles 

UVB exposure of representative bacterial strains was also accompanied by a 

shift in sole-carbon source use profiles. On average, amino acids (30.3-46.9 %) and 

polymers (12.8-34.6 %) were the substrates preferred by bacterioneuston before UV 

exposure. After UV exposure, a significant decrease in the relative consumption rate of 

amino acids and amines was observed (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), and the metabolism 

of bacterioneuston isolates became more dependent on polymers (up to 100 %) (Fig. 4.4 



Chapter 4 

69 

A). On average, before UV exposure bacterioplankton consumed mostly carbohydrates 

(15.0-38.1 %) and amino acids (24.0-35.5 %). UVB exposure did not significantly 

change this pattern (Fig. 4.4 B).

Post-irradiation recovery 

Recovery under nourished conditions during post-irradiation incubations, as 

described by CFU counts, was similar (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) in bacterioneuston 

and bacterioplankton isolates with all recovery regimes. Under starvation, recovery in 

CFU counts in the dark regime was significantly higher in bacterioneuston (55.0 ± 16.0 



Chapter 4 

70 

%) than in bacterioplankton (41.4 ± 19.3 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Compared to 

nourished conditions, recovery under starvation conditions was enhanced by up to 27.0 

% with UVA for bacterioplankton isolates and with all recovery regimes (up to 37.9 %) 

for the bacterioneuston isolate set (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 4.5 A-C). 

The extent of recovery in leucine incorporation rate did not differ significantly 

(1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) between illumination regimes or isolate sets, under 

nourished conditions. Under starvation, bacterioneuston recovered 14.4 % and 18.6 % 

better (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) than bacterioplankton, during the PAR and dark 

incubations, respectively. Compared to nourished conditions, bacterioneuston isolates 

recovered better under starvation conditions (up to 16.9 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) 

in all recovery regimes tested (Fig. 4.5 D-F).  

In nourished cell suspensions, significant differences in the extent of recovery of 

thymidine incorporation rates between bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates 

were only observed for the PAR regime, for which recovery was on average 24.2 % 

higher in bacterioneuston isolates (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Under starvation 

conditions, the extent of recovery of thymidine incorporation was significantly higher in 

bacterioneuston than in bacterioplankton under the PAR (by 14.8 %) and dark (by 21.9 

%) regimes (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). In bacterioplankton, the extent of recovery of 

thymidine incorporation in the dark regime was 17.1 % higher in nourished conditions 

than under starvation (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 4.5 G-I).

In general, exposure to UVB did not result in a significant average increase in 

the frequency of the RifR or NalR phenotypes (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 4.6 A, 

B). Statistically significant differences between averaged NalR or RifR frequencies of 

mutation in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates and between nourished and 

starved conditions were not found (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05).

On average, the reduction in CFU counts during the second UVB treatment was 

higher (7.1-22.0 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) than during the first treatment, for both 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton sets of isolates, regardless of the nutritional 

condition (Fig. 4.7 A, B).  

 

Discussion 

Despite the importance of estuaries in providing crucial ecosystem functions 

(Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000), studies on the effects of UV radiation on estuarine 

bacterial assemblages are still scarce in the literature. In the present work, UV-resistant 

bacteria were isolated from the surface microlayer and underlying waters of an estuarine 

system and their individual UV sensitivity was assessed in terms of CFU numbers, 

activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon source use profiles, repair 

potential (light-dependent and independent), and photoadaptation potential under 

different physiological conditions. The fact that only a relatively small number of 



Chapter 4 

72 

bacterial isolates was tested limits the ability to make generalizations for the entire 

natural bacterioneuston or bacterioplankton communities. However, since these were 

the only isolates retrieved upon irradiation of samples from the SML and UW, they 

probably represent the dominant culturable members of the bacterial assemblages 

inhabiting these compartments. Studying their UV sensitivity responses can, therefore, 

provide important clues to understand how the corresponding communities might 

respond to enhanced UV levels. 

 

UV resistance in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton 

Irradiation of samples from the SML and UW resulted in a steady decrease in 

the abundance of total culturable bacteria. Culturable survivals in bacterioneuston were 

still detected after an accumulated radiation dose of 108 kJ m-2, while bacterioplankton 

was inhibited below the detection limit with 72 kJ m-2. This could indicate the presence 

of bacteria with enhanced tolerance to UVB at the sunlit SML, already reported in other 

light-exposed habitats, such as the plant phyllosphere (Sundin and Jacobs, 1999) and 

high altitude wetland waters (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b). The bacterial isolates 

retrieved at different UVB doses were affiliated to four microbial groups: the Gram-

negative Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria and the Gram-positive 

Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.  

The average results of the individual testing of the isolated strains revealed a 

lower (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) UV-induced reduction in CFU in the bacterioneuston 

set, compared to bacterioplankton. The reduction in colony counts during irradiation 

was accompanied by a decrease in bacterial metabolic activity, assessed from the rates 

of leucine (protein synthesis) and thymidine (DNA synthesis) incorporation. On 

average, leucine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioneuston isolates (1-way 

ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), while thymidine incorporation was equally inhibited in both sets of 

isolates. Furthermore, in bacterioneuston isolates leucine incorporation was significantly 

more inhibited than thymidine incorporation, suggesting uncoupling of DNA and 

protein synthesis rates upon UVB exposure, already reported in other bacterial strains 

(Arrieta et al., 2000).  

UV exposure was accompanied by a shift in the profile of sole-carbon sources 

used by bacteria. This shift was particularly significant in bacterioneuston isolates, for 

which a statistically significant decrease in the utilization of amines and amino acids 

was observed, which could indicate a metabolic restructuring to compensate for UV-



Chapter 4 

73 

induced damage to the protein synthesis apparatus (Sommaruga et al., 1997). 

Furthermore, in 7 out of the 9 isolates tested, a tendency towards the use of the 

polymers Tween 40 and Tween 80 as a preferable carbon source was observed upon 

irradiation. The observed changes in metabolic profiles could result from an active 

transcriptional reaction of the cells to UV stress, involving a shift in metabolic strategies 

from growth to defence/repair, and/or could be a metabolic restructuring to compensate 

for UV-induced damage to sensitive enzymes. For example, in Escherichia coli 

exposure to stressful conditions (temperature shift, oxidative stress and carbon 

starvation) induces a reduction in metabolites of the central metabolism (TCA cycle and 

glycolysis), as well as an increase in free amino acids, as a result of protein degradation 

and stalling of translation (Jozefczuk et al., 2010). Further characterization of the 

metabolites induced by UV radiation in bacteria could help to clarify the significance of 

the observed metabolic shift during UVB exposure.  

 

Recovery from UVB-induced damage and photoadaptation potential 

Variability in the extent of the repair of UV-induced damage was also observed 

among the tested isolates. Only small, non significant increases, if any, in the 

frequencies of NalR and RifR mutant phenotypes, used to assay the occurrence of 

mutagenic DNA repair (MDR), were observed. Since the expression of MDR is 

differentially induced depending on the amount of DNA damage experienced by the cell 

(Walker, 1984; Smith and Walker, 1998), the reduced induction of the mutagenic repair 

pathway observed in the present study could indicate that bacteria are probably able to 

effectively repair UVB-induced DNA damage by error-free mechanisms (e.g., light 

dependent repair and NER).  

Whether bacterial photoadaptation occurs in aquatic environments has not been 

clearly established (Pakulski et al., 1998). In the present work, occurrence of 

photoadaptation to a second round of UV exposure was not observed and the reduction 

of CFU numbers during the second UV exposure was, in fact, higher than in the first. 

Unlike DNA photoproducts, which can be effectively reversed by photoreactivation, the 

overproduction of ROS caused by exposure of organisms to UVB can have far wider 

ranging consequences, causing oxidative lesions to biomolecules that are energetically 

expensive to repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Therefore, it is possible that after 

the first UV exposure, the surviving cells accumulated lesions that made them more 

vulnerable to the second round of irradiation, which is in accordance with our 



Chapter 4 

74 

observations of accumulation of oxidative products in bacteria after UV exposure is 

terminated (unpublished results). 

 

Effects of nutritional conditioning on UV-sensitivity responses 

Starvation significantly enhanced UV-induced reduction in CFU counts in 

relation to nourished conditions. This observation suggests that starvation could 

enhance the sensitivity of bacteria to UV-induced damage, probably as a result of the 

synergistic action of energy deprivation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species 

during starvation (Hengge-Aronis, 2002), which is accentuated by UV exposure. 

Starvation enhanced the inhibition of thymidine incorporation but had no 

significant effect on the response of leucine incorporation to irradiation. This indicates 

that UVB inhibition of DNA synthesis, but not protein synthesis, is modulated by the 

nutritional status of the cell, probably due to enhanced affinity of the protein synthesis 

system for ATP and GTP under starvation (Jewett et al., 2009). 

Nutritional conditions also affected recovery from UV-induced damage. The 

extent of recovery was generally higher in starved cells, particularly for bacterioneuston 

isolates. Since starvation also induces oxidative damage (Hengge-Aronis, 2002), 

defence mechanisms activated in response to starvation might allow for a more efficient 

recovery once UV exposure is terminated. Enhanced resistance to UV radiation under 

oligotrophic conditions has been reported for Vibrio sp. strain S14 (Nyström et al., 

1992) and Enterococcus faecalis (Hartke et al., 1998).  

Despite the fact that dissolved organic compounds (e.g., free amino acids) 

accumulate at the SML, bacterioneuston seems to display lower bacterial growth 

efficiencies than bacterioplankton, suggesting differences in the physiological state of 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002; Reinthaler et al., 

2008). Rapidly growing cells are often more susceptible to inactivation than slower 

growing ones, because of the shorter time for excision repair between rounds of 

replication (Harm, 1980; Jagger, 1985). Whether the natural differences in physiological 

state of the bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton could influence their UV sensitivity 

and account for the enhanced UV resistance of bacterioneuston is unknown.

Conclusion 

The photobiological responses (UV-induced damage, repair and potential for 

photoadaptation) of bacterial isolates retrieved from the SML and UW upon exposure to 

enhanced UVB levels were studied under different nutritional conditions. Regardless of 

the nutritional condition, CFU counts were more affected in bacterioplankton than in 

bacterioneuston, while protein synthesis was more inhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB 

exposure was accompanied by a metabolic shift, most notably in bacterioneuston. 

Recovery from UV-induced damage was enhanced under starvation conditions, 

particularly in bacterioneuston isolates. These observations suggest that the SML may 

contain a pool of bacteria adapted to cope with UV-induced stress.

Abstract 

The biological effects of UV radiation of different wavelengths (UVA, UVB and 

UVC) were assessed in nine bacterial isolates displaying different UV sensitivities. 

Biological effects (survival and activity) and molecular markers of oxidative stress 

(DNA strand breakage/DSB, generation of reactive oxygen species/ROS, oxidative 

damage to proteins and lipids, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase and 

superoxide dismutase) were quantified and statistically analyzed in order to identify the 

major determinants of cell inactivation under the different spectral regions. Survival and 

activity followed a clear wavelength dependence, being highest under UVA and lowest 

under UVC. The generation of ROS, as well as protein and lipid oxidation followed the 

same pattern. DNA damage (DSB) showed the inverse trend. Multiple stepwise 

regression analysis revealed that survival under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths was 

best explained by DSB, oxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, 

respectively. 

 

Introduction 

Bacteria are very susceptible to the effects of UV radiation, due to their small 

size, short generation time and absence of effective UV-protective pigmentation 

(Garcia-Pichel, 1994). Bacterial isolates have different susceptibilities to UV radiation 

(Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Berney et al., 2006d; Chun et al., 2009; Santos et 

al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a), and UV sensitivity is dependent on the wavelength 

(Sundin and Jacobs, 1999; Qiu et al., 2004; Bauermeister et al., 2009). Since different 

biomolecules (e.g., DNA, proteins and lipids) absorb UV radiation at different 

wavelengths, a portion of this variability is likely due to differences in the preferable 

cellular targets of the various wavelengths. DNA is considered the major target of UV 

radiation. However, comparable levels of DNA photoproduct accumulation are 



Chapter 5 

78 

observed in bacteria displaying different sensitivities to UV radiation (Joux et al., 1999; 

Matallana-Surget et al., 2008). In addition, DNA damage alone cannot account for the 

inhibition of bacterial activity in surface waters (Visser et al., 2002). Accordingly, it is 

likely that damage to other biomolecules contributes to the inhibitory effects of UV 

radiation and the variation in UV sensitivity among bacterial isolates. 

UV radiation can be divided into three regions: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (280-

320 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm). UVC is filtered by the ozone (O3) layer and does not 

reach the Earth’s surface. Terrestrial radiation, often called sunlight, contains about 8 % 

UVA and less than 1 % UVB (Coohill and Sagripanti, 2009). The biological effects of 

UVA are usually attributed to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 

which results in oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Chamberlain and Moss, 

1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; Girotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, 2006; Zeeshan and 

Prasad, 2009). UVB and UVC photons cause direct DNA damage by inducing the 

formation of DNA lesions (photoproducts), most notably pyrimidine dimers, which 

block DNA replication and RNA transcription (Pfeifer, 1997). Exposure to UVB also 

causes oxidative stress, as evidenced by the expression of antioxidant defences 

following UVB irradiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). Although 

the UVC region is not environmentally relevant, it is useful for assessing the UV 

sensitivity of bacteria that are highly tolerant or insensitive to high doses of UVB 

(Sundin and Jacobs, 1999). UVC radiation is also well known for its bactericidal 

potential (Jagger, 1985; Coohill and Sagripanti, 2008; King et al., 2011).  

Most studies addressing the cellular effects of UV radiation on bacteria 

conducted to date have focused on one target (either proteins, lipids or DNA) in one 

bacterial strain (Abboudi et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et 

al., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b), which has prevented a full understanding of the 

molecular basis for the variability in UV sensitivity. Such information is crucial to 

understand the role of UV radiation as a driver of microbial diversity and function in 

ecosystems, as well as to the development of efficient and ecologically-friendly UV-

based disinfection strategies targeting a broad range of bacteria. 

The objective of this study was to identify the major determinants of cell 

inactivation under different UV wavelengths in a set of bacterial isolates displaying 

distinct UV sensitivity.

Experimental layout 

The bacterial isolates used in this study were previously isolated from the 

surface waters of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) and characterized in 

terms of UV sensitivity (Santos et al., 2011b) (Table 5.1). In all irradiation experiments, 

only vegetative cells were used.

Fresh bacterial cultures were prepared in Marine Broth 2216 (Difco, Detroit, MI) 

and grown with agitation (120 rpm) at 25 ºC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 

(3,200 x g for 15 min) in the late-exponential phase (defined as the inflection point of 

the growth curve, at the transition between the exponential and stationary phase, which 

was usually achieved in 8-14 h). The growth rates (µ ) of the isolates were determined as 

previously described (Berney et al., 2006c) as µ  = ?ln OD546/?t. The pellet was washed 

three times in 0.2-µ m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl solution and cells were 

resuspended in filter-sterilized autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl. Bacterial abundance was 

determined by epifluorescence microscopy after acridine orange staining (Hobbie et al., 

1977), adjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1 and homogenized 

by gentle vortexing. 

For each isolate, 30 mL of bacterial cell suspension (corresponding, on average, 

to a biomass of approximately 1 mg mL-1 of protein) was transferred to sterile 150 x 25 

mm plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that 



Chapter 5

the depth of the liquid was &amp;lt;2 mm. For irradiation, the lid was removed and cell 

suspensions were exposed to UVA (Philips TL 100 W/10R lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, 

The Netherlands, main emission line at 365 nm, intensity of 50 W m-2), UVB (Philips 

TL 100 W/01 lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission line at 302 

nm, intensity of 2.3 W m-2) and UVC (low pressure mercury lamp NN 8/15, Heraeus, 

Berlin, Germany, main emission line at 254 nm, intensity of 0.66 W m-2). UV sources 

were placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities were measured with a 

monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, Bentham 

Instruments, Reading, UK) and the UV dose (in J m-2) was calculated by multiplying the 

intensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). The total cumulative doses applied were 

300 kJ m-2, 90 kJ m-2 and 180 J m-2, for UVA, UVB and UVC, respectively. During 

irradiation, samples were stirred by magnetic agitation and temperature was kept at ± 25 

ºC. A dark control (covered in aluminum foil) treated in the same way as the irradiated 

samples was included in every experiment. Survival curves for each isolate were 

generated separately for UVA, UVB and UVC for the determination of the LD50 (UV 

dose resulting in 50 % inactivation). Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected before 

irradiation and at LD50 for assessment of activity, indicators of oxidative damage and 

activity of antioxidant enzymes. Samples were immediately placed at 4 ºC in order to 

avoid repair until further processing, which was generally conducted in less than 1 hour. 

All experiments were repeated in three independent assays. Parameters were always 

determined in a minimum of three analytical replicates. Positive (50 mM H2O2-treated) 

and negative (untreated) controls were always included and processed along 

experimental samples in order to ensure proper functioning of the procedures on all 

strains. All determinations were carried out in a red-dark room to minimize 

photoreactivation. 

 

Colony forming units (CFU) 

Sample aliquots of irradiated samples and non-irradiated controls were serially-

diluted in filter-sterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and 100 µ L aliquots were spread-

plated in agar plates (Difco). Colonies were counted after 3 days of incubation in the 

dark at 25 ºC.  



Chapter 5 

81 

Bacterial activity 

Bacterial activity was estimated from the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation 

(Smith and Azam, 1992) in cell suspensions before and after UV exposure. Triplicate 

1.5 mL aliquots and a TCA (5 %) fixed control were incubated with a mixture of 

[3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity 160 Ci mmol?1) and 

nonradioactive leucine at a previously determined saturating concentration of 480 nM. 

Samples were incubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. Incubations were 

stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (5 % final concentration), after 

which samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was 

discarded and 1.5 mL of 5 % TCA were added. The samples were then vortexed, 

centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 90 % 

ethanol, dried overnight at room temperature and resuspended in 1.0 mL of Universol 

liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals). The radioactivity incorporated in 

bacterial cells was measured after 3 days in a Beckman LS 6000 IC Liquid Scintillation 

Counter.  

 

Intracellular ROS generation 

Intracellular production of ROS was detected using the probe 2',7'-

dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and 

irradiated samples were centrifuged and washed with 10 mM potassium phosphate 

buffer (pH 7.0), amended with the probe (final concentration 10 µ M), and incubated for 

30 min in the dark. Cells were subsequently washed, sonicated and 100 µ L of the cell 

extracts were mixed with 1 mL of potassium phosphate buffer. The fluorescence of the 

samples was measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer at room temperature, with an 

excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 519 nm. The fluorescence 

intensity at 519 nm was corrected against blank controls without cells and then 

normalized to the protein content (see below for procedure) in comparison with control 

samples.  

 

DNA strand breakage 

UV-induced DNA damage was assessed using the quantification of DNA strand 

breaks (DSB) as a proxy, due to the inability to detect the more routinely used CPDs in 

some of the strains even after exposure to 180 J m-2 of UVC, potentially due to 

experimental constraints. On the other hand, DSB accumulation, as well as the variation 



Chapter 5 

82 

of the other parameters assessed, generally followed a dose-dependent trend (data not 

shown). 

DSB were determined following a modified version of the FADU (Fluorimetric 

Analysis of DNA Unwinding) method (He and Häder, 2002). In addition to the test 

samples (so-called P-samples), the method requires two sets of untreated control 

samples: samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples 

subjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by 

centrifugation (3,000 x g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final 

concentration) in EDTA solution, followed by proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final 

concentration). A volume of 300 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the three sets of 

samples: (1) T-samples were neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 

s, following a 30 min incubation at room temperature; (2) B-samples were sonicated for 

2 min, neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl after a 30 min incubation and sonicated 

again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 µL of 

0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. 

A final concentration of 5 µ M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples and, 

after centrifugation, a 1 mL volume of supernatant was used for fluorescence 

measurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer. The fraction 

of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was calculated as dsDNA = (P?B)/(T?B)×100, 

where T, P and B were fluorescence intensities of T-, P- and B-samples normalized to 

the protein content, respectively.  

 

Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  

Lipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive 

substances (TBARS) as previously described (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated 

cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium 

phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) added of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM PMSF 

(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation to remove 

cellular debris, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 mL of 20 % trichloroacetic acid 

and centrifuged (10,000 x g for 5 min). Supernatants were removed, mixed with 1 mL 

of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid in 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. 

Samples were heated at 100 ºC for 1 h, after which 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled 

and then mixed with 1.5 mL of butanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the 

organic fraction was removed and the absorbance at 535 nm was determined using a 



Chapter 5 

83 

Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer. TBARS content was determined 

using an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1 cm-1 and values were normalized to the 

protein content.  

 

Protein oxidation 

Protein oxidation was assessed from carbonyl levels as previously described 

(Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated for 1 h at room 

temperature with 10 mM dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was 

omitted in the blanks. Proteins were precipitated with 500 µ L of 20 % trichloroacetic 

acid, centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min) and the pellet was washed three times with 1 mL 

of 1:1 (v/v) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 M 

guanidine hydrochloride. Samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed against a blank 

of 1 mL of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM potassium 

phosphate). The absorbance at 360 nm was determined and the molar absorption 

coefficient of 22 mM-1 cm-1 was used to quantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Values 

were normalized to the protein content.  

 

Antioxidant enzymatic activity 

Irradiated and non-irradiated cells were resuspended in cold 50 mM potassium 

phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EDTA and sonicated in ice. The extracts 

were centrifuged (10,000 x g, 15 min) and the supernatant frozen at -80 °C until 

analysis.  

Catalase (CAT) activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the 

rate of decomposition of H2O2 (Beers and Sizer, 1952). One unit of CAT activity was 

defined as the amount of activity required to decompose 1 µ mol of H2O2 per minute 

under the assay conditions. The strain Enterococcus faecalis was used as a negative 

control. An additional negative control consisting of a mixture of 18 mM hydrogen 

peroxide with sterile potassium phosphate buffer (1:5) was also included in every 

experiment (Anderl et al., 2003). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined 

according to McCord and Fridovich (1969) in which a xanthine-xanthine oxidase 

system is used to generate O2
- and nitroblue tetrazolium is used as an indicator. One unit 

of SOD activity was defined as the amount of SOD that resulted in 50 % inhibition of 

the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Potassium phosphate buffer was used as a blank. 

Protein concentration in cell suspensions was determined by the method of Bradford

(1976). The specific activity of antioxidant enzymes was expressed as units per 

milligram of cellular proteins.  

 

Statistical analysis 

Differences between treatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the 

statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of 

variances. If variances were not homogeneous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test 

was used to assess the overall effect of the treatment. Differences with p values &amp;lt;0.05 

were considered statistically significant. Principal component analysis (PCA), used to 

reduce the variability of the data sets and identify the main parameters contributing to 

the discrimination between UV treatments, was performed using software Primer 5. 

Stepwise multiple regression, used to identify groups of independent variables that 

would predict the dependent variable (LD50) with optimal efficiency, was conducted on 

SPSS v. 17.

LD50 values showed expected wavelength dependence, being highest under 

UVA and lowest under UVC. LD50 values for UVA ranged from 51.9 ± 3.7 kJ m
-2 in 

Staphylococcus sp. to 297.5 ± 16.3 kJ m-2 in Micrococcus sp. Under UVB, LD50 values 

ranged between 29.6 ± 1.5 kJ m-2 in Psychrobacter sp. and 50.1 ± 3.8 kJ m-2 in 

Micrococcus sp. and for UVC LD50 values varied between 13.7 ± 0.3 J m
-2 in 

Acinetobacter sp. and 45.0 ± 2.4 J m-2 in Micrococcus sp.

Data are presented as group means ± standard deviations of the mean of three experiments. Absence of error bars indicates that 

standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. 

 

Inhibition of activity also showed a clear wavelength dependence, with UVC 

wavelengths causing the highest average inhibition (77.5 ± 2.1 %) and UVA the lowest 

(30.0 ± 20.2 %). For UVA, at LD50 inhibition of activity ranged from 5.1 ± 0.1 % in 

Pseudomonas sp. to 56.8 ± 7.2 % in Psychrobacter sp. Exposure to LD50 of UVB 

resulted in an inhibition of activity ranging between 38.9 ± 3.4 % in Sphingomonas sp. 

and 80.6 ± 7.6 % in Bacillus sp. Under UVC, exposure to LD50 resulted in an inhibition 

of activity ranging between 72.7 ± 6.5 % in Sphingomonas sp. and 79.4 ± 7.0 % in 

Staphylococcus sp. (Fig. 5.2). 

 

ROS generation and oxidation of biomolecules  

ROS generation also followed a wavelength-dependent trend of variation, being 

highest under UVA (42.1 ± 9.4 %) and lowest under UVC (8.2 ± 4.1 %). The 

enhancement of ROS generation was more marked in Staphylococcus sp. with UVA

(56.4 ± 5.9 %) and UVB (39.1 ± 3.9 %) and Micrococcus sp. (15.2 ± 1.8 %) with UVC 

(Fig. 5.3 A).  

The increase in DNA strand breaks (DSB) showed a wavelength dependence as 

well, being highest under UVC (23.2 ± 8.4 %) and lowest under UVA (7.9 ± 5.7 %). 

DSB generation ranged from 1.4 ± 0.1 % (Bacillus sp.) to 19.0 ± 2.0 % (Staphylococcus 

sp.) under UVA, from 5.3 ± 0.6 % (Micrococcus sp.) to 31.3 ± 3.1 % (Staphylococcus 

sp.) under UVB and from 10.7 ± 0.9 % (Acinetobacter sp.) to 35.7 ± 4.2 % 

(Psychrobacter sp.) under UVC (Fig. 5.3 B).

means ± standard deviations of the mean of three experiments. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small 

to see on the scale used.

The increase in TBARS, used as proxies for the extent of oxidative stress 

damage to the membrane lipids, varied from 37.1 ± 4.4 % (Pseudomonas sp.) to 54.2 ± 

5.3 % (Psychrobacter sp.) with UVA, from 22.0 ± 2.5 % (Brevibacterium sp.) to 36.2 ± 

3.5 % (Bacillus sp.) with UVB and from 6.3 ± 0.5 % (Pseudomonas sp.) to 14.7 ± 1.5 % 

(Staphylococcus sp.) with UVC (Fig. 5.3 C). A wavelength trend of variation was also 

observed for TBARS, which showed the strongest generation under UVA (47.7 ± 6.2 

%) and the lowest under UVC (11.4 ± 3.5 %). 

The increase in protein carbonyl levels ranged from 15.2 ± 1.6 % (Bacillus sp.) 

to 97.0 ± 11.5 % (Sphingomonas sp.) under UVA (45.7 ± 31.8 %), from 1.2 ± 0.1 % 

(Micrococcus sp.) to 103.6 ± 10.8 % (Brevibacterium sp.) under UVB (36.1 ± 30.9 %), 

and from 6.3 ± 0.7 % (Sphingomonas sp.) to 68.4 ± 6.8 % (Staphylococcus sp.) under 

UVC (26.5 ± 21.8 %) (Fig. 5.3 D).  

 

Antioxidant enzyme activity 

The effects of UVA on CAT activity (51.6 ± 48.3 %) (Fig. 5.3 E) ranged from a 

62.8 ± 6.9 % inhibition (Acinetobacter sp.) to a 99.5 ± 9.8 % stimulation 

(Brevibacterium sp.). The effects of UVB (8.3 ± 49.7 %) varied between a 89.1 ± 6.5 % 

reduction (Micrococcus sp.) and a 62.9 ± 6.6 % increase (Brevibacterium sp.) and UVC 

effects (19.4 ± 25.1 %) ranged from an inhibition of 29.3 ± 3.1 % (Bacillus sp.) to a 

48.8 ± 5.8 % increase (Paracoccus sp.) in CAT activity. 

Irradiation with UVA and UVC caused an overall decrease in SOD activity (by 

an average of 28.5 ± 25.8 % and 24.5 ± 20.1 %, respectively), while UVB caused an 

average increase of 21.5 ± 19.3 %. The effects of UVA ranged from a 53.0 ± 5.7 % 

inhibition (Bacillus sp.) to a 30.4 ± 3.0 % stimulation (Staphylococcus sp.) of SOD 

activity. UVB either had no significant effect (Staphylococcus sp.) or enhanced SOD 

activity by as much as 59.1 ± 6.2 % (Brevibacterium sp.) and UVC effects ranged from 

an inhibition of 47.3 ± 4.9 % (Bacillus sp.) to a 18.0 ± 1.7 % increase (Staphylococcus 

sp.) (Fig. 5.3 F). 

 

Differences between wavelengths and determinants of inactivation 

PCA was applied to the data set to identify the main determinants of the 

differences between the effects of the three UV spectral regions tested (Fig. 5.4). The 

different radiation regimes were clearly separated along PC1, with UVA-treated 

samples displaying the lowest PC1 scores, mostly related to ROS (-0.495), TBARS (-

0.496) and carbonyl levels (-0.231). UVC-treated samples displayed the highest PC1 

scores, related to activity (0.484) and DSB (0.363), while UVB-treated samples were 

located in between UVA and UVC-treated samples. 

 

 
Fig. 5.4. Principal component analysis (PCA) score plot of data (activity, ROS levels, lipid oxidation, protein oxidation, DNA 

lesions, CAT and SOD activity) used to determine the parameters contributing the most for the separation of UVA, UVB and UVC 

treatments. A total of 27 data points (9 bacterial isolates x 3 replicates) was used for PCA analysis. 

 

Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to assess the main 

determinants of bacterial inactivation, expressed as LD50, following exposure to UV 

radiation of different spectral regions. Results are presented in Table 5.2. Under UVA, 

34.2 % of the variability in LD50 could be accounted for by DSB and SOD activity. 

Under UVB, 57.7 % of the variability in LD50 could be explained by the combination of 

TBARS, DSB and activity. Under UVC, ROS and DSB levels accounted with statistical 

significance for 55.8 % of the variation in LD50 values.

Discussion 

In this study, the cellular and biological effects of UVA, UVB and UVC were 

assessed for a set of isolates characterized by different UV sensitivities using biological 

and biochemical methods. Additionally, multivariate analyses (principal component 

analysis and regression analysis) were conducted to identify the determinants of cell 

inactivation under different UV spectral regions.  

 

Interspecific variation in UV sensitivity 

Responses of the different isolates tested to each UV spectral region varied 

greatly. Several factors can account for this variability. Specifically, the preferential 

molecular target (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, lipids) of UV radiation may differ among 

strains. For example, it has been suggested that the extent of UV-induced DNA damage 

in Gram-positive bacteria is lower than that in Gram-negative bacteria because of a 

shielding effect by the cell wall (Jagger, 1985). Another factor is that the relative 

contribution of different reactive oxygen species involved in eliciting UV-induced 

damage may differ among strains, which may then affect the extent of the damage. For 

instance, the presence of high concentrations of intracellular iron in Shewanella 

oneidensis MR-1 promotes ROS proliferation and the production of the highly toxic 

hydroxyl radicals via Fenton-type chemistry; accordingly, this strain is extremely 

susceptible to UV radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a). Finally, the efficiency of the defence and 

repair strategies to cope with damage may also differ among bacteria (Arrieta et al., 

2000; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009b; Santos et al., 2011b).  

In the present study, the set of isolates tested showed in general a much higher 

resistance to UVA radiation than that reported in similar studies using Shewanella 

oneidensis MR1 (Qiu et al., 2004) and Escherichia coli (Ubomba-Jaswa et al., 2009). 

UVB LD50 values were, on average, up to 10 times higher than those observed in 

Antarctic marine bacteria (Hernandez et al., 2006) as well as in a set of marine bacterial 

isolates and the enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimurium CIP 60.62T (Joux et al., 1999). 

On the other hand, the average UVC LD50 (26.6 J m
-2) determined in the present study 

was lower than that detected in Clavibacter michiganensis (UVC LD50 of approximately 

75 J m-2) (Jacobs and Sundin, 2001) and even lower than the average minimal inhibitory 

UVC dose observed in a set of isolates retrieved from the peanut phyllosphere (Sundin 

and Jacobs, 1999).

In this study, the Gram-positive, high G+C content Actinobacteria Micrococcus 

sp. showed the highest resistance to each UV spectral region. Highly UV-resistant 

Micrococcus strains have previously been isolated (Ordoñez et al., 2009). It has been 

suggested that Gram-positive bacteria are better adapted to UV stress because their cell 

walls screen out a considerable fraction of UV radiation (Jagger, 1985). The genomic 

composition of microorganisms, particularly the G+C content and bipyrimidine 

nucleotide frequency, also affects the frequency and spectrum of DNA lesions formed 

during exposure to UV radiation (Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Moeller et al., 2010). 

The high G+C content of Actinobacteria has been proposed to confer protective 

adaptation against UV radiation by minimizing the formation of cyclobutane dimers 

(Warnecke et al., 2005). However, the other Actinobacteria tested in this study 

(Brevibacterium sp.) was quite sensitive to UV radiation, which is in agreement with 

observations by Ordoñez et al. (2009), demonstrating that cell wall characteristics and 

G+C content are not the sole determinants of UV resistance. The presence of protective 

pigmentation (Shick and Dunlap, 2002) and specialized DNA repair systems (Dodson et 

al., 1994) in Micrococcus sp., but not Brevibacterium sp., could contribute to the 

discrepancy in UV sensitivity of these Actinobacteria.  

Gammaproteobacteria have been reported as the most UV-resistant group in 

several aquatic environments (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; Ordoñez et al., 2009; Santos et 

al., 2012b). In the present study, Pseudomonas sp. showed high levels of resistance to 

the different UV spectral regions, in agreement with previous studies (Ordoñez et al., 

2009). UV-resistant Acinetobacter strains have also been isolated and their resistance 

associated with efficient DNA repair mechanisms (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; 

Hörtnagl et al., 2011) and high catalase activity (Di Capua et al., 2011). However, in 

this study, Acinetobacter sp. was found to be UV-sensitive. UV-sensitive and UV-

resistant Acinetobacter strains have been isolated even from the same environment 

(Ordoñez et al., 2009), suggesting that UV resistance is not a phylogenetic 

characteristic.  

The alphaproteobacterium Sphingomonas sp. also showed high resistance to UV 

radiation, which is in accordance with previous reports of reduced accumulation of 

DNA lesions in Sphingomonas strains following UV exposure (Joux et al., 1999).

General trends in the effects of UV radiation 

Despite the interspecies variability observed, some wavelength-dependent trends 

in the variation of biological and biochemical parameters studied were identified. 

Specifically, shorter UV wavelengths caused the greatest bacterial inactivation (denoted 

by lower UV doses being required to reduce bacterial numbers) and reduction in 

activity, while longer UVA wavelengths had more subtle effects in accordance with 

their indirect, ROS-mediated mode of action (Eisenstark, 1998). Intracellular ROS 

generation, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonylation, which are indicative of 

indirect UV effects, showed the strongest response to UVA irradiation. DSB formation 

resulting from direct interaction of UV with DNA was highest under UVC. The 

magnitude of UVB effects was generally between those of UVA and UVC, supporting 

the suggestion that UVB-induced damage comprises elements from both the direct and 

indirect pathways of damage (Qiu et al., 2005a). No wavelength-dependent variation 

was detected for CAT or SOD, suggesting that the type of ROS involved in eliciting the 

damage and the degree to which the interconnected mechanisms of ROS generation and 

removal by antioxidant enzymes act in each particular strain are extremely variable and 

ultimately shape the individual patterns of response of CAT and SOD to irradiation. 

Principal component analysis applied to the entire data set clearly separated the 

effects of different irradiation treatments. The extent of the oxidative damage to lipids 

and proteins, as well as ROS levels, were found to be involved in differentiating UVA 

effects from the other UV regimes, suggesting that membrane lipids and proteins are 

major targets of UVA-induced oxidative modifications, in accordance with previous 

studies (Pizarro and Orce, 1988; Bosshard et al., 2010b). The effects of UVC were more 

related to the extent of damage to DNA (assessed using DSB as a proxy), which is in 

agreement with the mutagenic nature of UVC wavelengths (Friedberg et al., 1995), as 

well as their inhibitory effects on activity. The PCA bidimensional plot showed that 

UVB-treated samples were positioned between UVA and UVC treatments, supporting 

the intermediate nature of the effects of UVB when compared with those of UVA and 

UVC (Qiu et al., 2005a). 

 

Determinants of bacterial inactivation 

Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to assess the main 

determinants of bacterial inactivation following exposure to different UV spectral 

regions. The amount of DSB emerged as the major determinant of inactivation upon 



Chapter 5 

92 

exposure to UVA. UVA-induced damage has traditionally been attributed to 

photodynamic reactions mediated by cellular chromophores since DNA does not 

strongly absorb light in the UVA range (Cadet et al., 2005a). More recently, 

investigations conducted on eukaryotes have highlighted the high mutagenic potential of 

UVA (Rünger et al., 2012) and the role of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, rather than 

oxidative lesions, in UVA-induced damage (Ikehata et al., 2008). The finding that UVA 

induced the lowest reduction in CFU among the investigated spectral regions 

demonstrates that bacteria are able to minimize UVA-induced DNA lesions. This may 

involve light-dependent repair mechanisms mediated by photolyase activated by UVA 

radiation itself, as well as light-independent repair (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). 

Additionally, most UVA sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of DSB 

and TBARS (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that the 

extent of oxidative damage to biomolecules and counteracting protective mechanisms 

underlie the variability in UVA susceptibility among different bacteria, but that the 

accumulation of DNA damage ultimately leads to cell death. 

Under UVB, oxidative damage to lipids (TBARS), accumulation of DNA 

damage, and loss of metabolic activity were the main determinants of inactivation. 

These results indicate that, in addition to DNA damage, changes in the integrity of 

membrane structure and functionality during UVB exposure play an important role in 

bacterial inactivation. Such changes may compromise the ability of the cell to generate 

energy necessary to sustain its activity and elicit repair strategies following irradiation 

(Bosshard et al., 2010a). Most UVB-sensitive strains displayed significantly higher 

levels of protein carbonyls than resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), which also 

identifies protein oxidation as an important determinant of bacterial susceptibility to 

UVB radiation. UVB was the only irradiation regime to enhance SOD activity levels in 

all bacteria when compared with non-irradiated controls, indicating that SOD may play 

an important protective role against UVB. The superoxide radical is able to directly 

cause oxidative damage to the bases of DNA (Misiaszek et al., 2004). Additionally, 

superoxide can attack Fe-S clusters of enzymes, rendering them inactive. The released 

ferrous iron can, in turn, react with H2O2, resulting in the formation of the highly toxic 

hydroxyl radical which is able to attack virtually any biomolecule (Imlay, 2006).  

Regression analysis revealed that ROS levels together with DNA damage were 

the best predictors of cell inactivation under UVC. However, the extent of DNA damage 

did not differ significantly between resistant and sensitive strains, which is in 



Chapter 5 

93 

accordance with previous observations (De La Vega et al., 2005). On the other hand, 

most UVC sensitive strains displayed significantly higher TBARS and carbonyls levels 

than resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), which suggests that the extent of 

oxidative damage to lipids and proteins interferes with vital biological functions and is 

therefore an important component of UVC-induced inactivation (Krisko and Radman, 

2010; Schenk et al., 2011). Unexpectedly, ROS levels were significantly higher in 

resistant strains (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05); however, it is unclear if these findings have 

any biological significance. Accordingly, additional studies to investigate whether ROS 

generation is involved in eliciting specific defence strategies in response to UVC 

exposure, as in cyanobacteria (Dillon et al., 2002) and plants (Murphy and Huerta, 

1990), are warranted. 

 

New insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage in bacteria 

The present work aimed to dissect the wavelength dependence of the damage 

induced by UV radiation. In order to do so, a combination of a multitude of UV-

sensitivity tests and their statistical analysis was applied. Using this combined 

innovative approach new clues regarding the targets of UV radiation of different 

spectral regions across a range of bacteria with different UV susceptibilities emerged. In 

particular, the involvement of DNA damage in eliciting bacterial inactivation upon 

UVA exposure was observed, which is in accordance with work reporting the induction 

of the SOS response in UVA-irradiated bacteria (Qiu et al., 2005a; Berney et al., 

2006a). Oxidative damage to lipids was found to be determinant for bacterial 

inactivation during UVB exposure. Such observation is in agreement with recent reports 

of enhanced expression of the glyoxalase protein and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase 

AhpC, involved in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation by-products, following UVB 

exposure of Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). Finally, 

oxidative stress was also found to be crucial for cell inactivation under UVC, supporting 

evidence accumulating in recent years (Gomes et al., 2005; Krisko and Radman, 2010; 

Schenk et al., 2011). 

Most investigations on the effects of UV radiation on bacteria have been 

conducted on a small number of genetically-well characterized microorganisms that are 

not always representative of natural environmental communities. By using bacterial 

strains originating from a photo-stressed microbial community (Santos et al., 2011b), 

the information gained from the isolates used in the present work could provide clues to 



Chapter 5

understand how natural microbial assemblages might react to global changes, 

particularly changes in environmentally relevant UV radiation.

Abstract 

The knowledge of the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation by UV radiation of 

different wavelengths can contribute for a better understanding of the environmental 

effects of enhanced UV levels associated with global environmental changes, as well as 

the optimization of UV-based disinfection strategies.  

In the present work, the effect of exposure to UV radiation of different spectral 

regions (UVC, 100-280 nm; UVB, 280-320 nm; UVA, 320-400 nm) on the lipids and 

proteins of two bacterial strains with distinct UV sensitivities was studied by mid-

infrared spectroscopy. Exposure to UV radiation caused a general increase in lipid 

methylation, accompanied by lipid oxidation and potentially altered lipid composition, 

which could reflect UV-induced damage to enzymes involved in lipid metabolism 

and/or a metabolic strategy to preserve the resources of the cell for defence/repair 

strategies. Mid-infrared spectroscopy also revealed effects of UV radiation on protein 

conformation and/or composition, oxidative damage to amino acid side chain residues 

and potentially changes in the propionylation, glycosylation and/or phosphorylation 

status of proteins. These results highlight the array of modifications induced by UV 

radiation on the lipids and proteins of bacteria, giving further support to the role of 

modifications induced in these biomolecules in the UV-based inactivation process. 

 

Introduction 

UV radiation is an important stress factor for aquatic bacterial communities 

(Herndl et al., 1997; Moran and Zepp, 2000; Häder, 2001; Buma et al., 2003). UV 

radiation can be divided in three categories: UVC (100-280 nm), UVB (280-320 nm) 

and UVA (320-400 nm). Most environmental photobiology studies have focused on 

UVB effects on bacteria (Wängberg et al., 1998; Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; 

Gustavson et al., 2000; Buma et al., 2001; Chatila et al., 2001; Fernández Zenoff et al., 



Chapter 6 

96 

2006a; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; Wängberg et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2009; 

Santos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2012b). Though on a photon basis UVA radiation 

contains less energy than UVB radiation, the fraction of solar radiation in the UVA (95 

%) spectrum is greater than that in the UVB spectrum (5 %) and can potentially cause 

substantial biological damage (Frederick and Lubin, 1988; Nunez et al., 1994; Moan et 

al., 1999), which is explored in the process of solar disinfection (Wegelin et al., 1994). 

UVC radiation does not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, but it is a convenient 

experimental tool to assess UV sensitivity in bacteria that are highly tolerant or 

insensitive to high doses of UVB (Sundin and Jacobs, 1999). Furthermore, its ability to 

inactivate bacteria is widely recognized (Jagger, 1985; Coohill and Sagripanti, 2008; 

King et al., 2011).  

The biological effects of the different UV wavelengths are distinguished in their 

preferential cellular targets and mechanisms by which they induce damage. The effects 

of UVA are considered to be mostly indirect, that is, mediated by reactive oxygen 

species (ROS) formed by photodynamic reactions involving intracellular or 

extracellular photosensitizers (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; 

Girotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, 2006; Zeeshan and Prasad, 2009). These ROS can 

react with cellular constituents, most notably proteins and lipids, leading to altered 

membrane permeability and/or disruption of transmembrane ion gradients that 

eventually can result in cell death (Bose and Chatterjee, 1995; Futsaether et al., 1995). 

UVC radiation is the most detrimental to living cells, because it is directly absorbed by 

DNA, causing the formation of cyclobutane dimers and single-strand breaks in the 

sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA (Pfeifer, 1997). UVB radiation produces both direct 

and indirect damage (Moran and Zepp, 2000). 

Iron is a key mediator of the processes of ROS generation, due to its 

involvement in the Fenton reaction which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical 

(Wardman and Candeias, 1996). Fenton reactions are accelerated by light (photo-Fenton 

reactions) (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987). Accordingly, Fenton-mediated oxidative 

damage is enhanced upon UV exposure (Moss and Smith, 1981). The presence of high 

amounts of iron sequestered in membranes, particularly associated with respiratory 

proteins, makes bacterial cell membranes potentially important targets of oxidative 

reactions (Kohen et al., 1995).  

While there are several studies of the effects of UV radiation on DNA (Moeller 

et al., 2007a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010; Moeller et al., 



Chapter 6 

97 

2010), the observation of comparable levels of DNA photoproduct accumulation in 

bacteria displaying different sensitivities to UV radiation (Joux et al., 1999; Matallana-

Surget et al., 2008) and the fact that DNA damage alone cannot account for the 

inhibition of bacterial activity in surface waters (Visser et al., 2002) seems to imply that 

damage to other biomolecules contributes to the inhibitory effects of UV radiation. 

Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins may play a role in the process (Chamberlain 

and Moss, 1987; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Bosshard et al., 2010b). 

The knowledge of the targets of UVA and UVB on bacterial cells is crucial to 

understand their roles as drivers of bacterial community structure and function and fully 

comprehend how enhanced UV fluxes resulting from global changes (Andrady et al., 

2010) can impact biogeochemical cycles. Additionally, integrated information of the 

effects of UV radiation of different wavelengths may contribute for the design of more 

efficient and ecologically-friendly UV-based disinfection strategies applicable either in 

the industrial setting or in a solar disinfection context.  

The objective of this work was to study the modifications induced by exposure 

to UV radiation of different spectral regions on the lipids and proteins of two bacterial 

strains displaying different UV sensitivities using mid-infrared spectroscopy. 

 

Materials and methods 

Bacterial strains and irradiation conditions 

The bacterial strains used in this study (Acinetobacter sp. strain PT5I1.2G, 

NCBI accession number GQ365202 and Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, NCBI 

accession number GU084169) were isolated from the surface waters of the estuarine 

system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) (Santos et al., 2011b) (Table 6.1). Two 

Gammaproteobacteria strains were selected because this group is dominant in the UV-

exposed surface layers of water bodies and several of their members have been 

proposed to be UV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; Santos et 

al., 2012b). The Pseudomonas strain used in the present study is UVB-resistant (LD50 

for UVA, UVB and UVC of 221.3 kJ m-2, 49.3 kJ m-2 and 40.6 J m-2, respectively), 

recovering efficiently from UVB-induced damage, while the Acinetobacter strain is 

more sensitive to UVB radiation (LD50 for UVA, UVB and UVC of 159.3 kJ m
-2, 34.1 

kJ m-2 and 18.0 J m-2, respectively) and less able to recover from UVB-induced damage 

(Santos et al., 2011b).

Bacterial isolates were grown in Marine Broth 2216 on an orbital shaker (100 

rpm) at 25°C until late-exponential phase (defined as the inflection point of the growth 

curve, at the transition between the exponential and stationary phase, which was usually 

achieved in approximately 10 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for 

15 min, 20 ºC, Eppendorf centrifuge 5415R, Hamburg, Germany) and the pellet was 

washed three times in 0.9 % NaCl, in order to remove all traces of nutrients originating 

from the culture medium. Bacterial cells were then resuspended in 0.9 % NaCl and 

bacterial abundance was adjusted with 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1, as determined by 

epifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et al., 1977).  

Cell suspensions were placed in sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 mm; Corning) and 

irradiated (without the lid) with UVA (Philips TL 100 W/10R lamps, Philips, 

Eindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission line at 365 nm, intensity of 50 W m-2), 

UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission 

line at 302 nm, intensity of 2.3 W m-2) and UVC (low pressure mercury lamp NN 8/15, 

Heraeus, Berlin, Germany, main emission line at 254 nm, intensity of 0.66 W m-2). For 

each spectral region tested, the samples were irradiated to their LD50 (UV dose resulting 

in 50 % inactivation). UV sources were placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities 

were measured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level 

(DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) and the UV dose (in J m-2) was 

calculated by multiplying the intensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). 

During irradiation, samples were stirred by magnetic agitation and temperature 

was kept at approximately 25 ºC. A dark control (covered in aluminum foil) treated in 

the same way as the irradiated samples was included in every experiment. Aliquots of 

cell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation, washed with ultrapure water 

and immediately used for lipid and protein extraction. For every irradiation treatment, 

experiments were repeated in three independent assays with three biological replicates.

Dark controls (covered in aluminium foil), treated in the same way as the irradiated 

samples, were included in every experiment. 

 

Lipid extraction 

Total lipid extracts were obtained according to standard protocols (Bligh and 

Dyer, 1959). Briefly, irradiated and unirradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and 

the pellet was washed with pure desalted water. The suspensions were centrifuged again 

and the supernatant discarded. A volume of 125 µ L of chloroform and 250 µ L of 

methanol was added to the pellet and the mixture was vortexed vigorously. Then, 8.4 

µ L of hydrochloric acid (6 M) and 125 µ L of chloroform were added and the mixture 

vortexed again. Finally, 125 µ L of pure desalted water were added, the solution was 

vortexed again, and centrifuged for 20 min at 300 x g. Total lipid extract was collected 

in the lower phase and immediately used for spectra acquisition. 

 

Protein extraction 

Proteins were extracted according to previously described procedures (Ojanen et 

al., 1993). Briefly, irradiated and unirradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and the 

pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The suspension was sonicated in 

an ice bath four times for 5 s using a sonifier (Branson 450, Danbury, CT, USA), 

followed by a centrifugation step at 15,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was 

resuspended with 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and sarcosyl (Sigma, St. Louis, 

MO, USA) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 % (v/v). After incubation at room 

temperature for 20 min, the protein extract was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 x g 

for 90 min at 4 °C and suspended in ultrapure water. 

 

Spectra acquisition and analysis 

Mid-infrared spectra were obtained using a GoldenGate single reflection 

diamond ATR system in an infrared (IR) spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX 

System 2000) equipped with a DTGS detector. Measurements were recorded over the 

wavelength range of 4000 to 700 cm-1 with a spectral resolution of 8 cm-1. The final 

spectra of the samples were achieved averaging 32 scans. A total of 6 spectra were used 

for chemometric analysis. Spectra were normalized and baseline-corrected and then 

used to obtain difference spectra (irradiated minus control) using OPUS version 6.5 

software (Bruker, Germany). Additionally, the original spectra were transferred via 



Chapter 6

JCAMP.DX format into the data analysis software package described in Barros (1999) 

for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

 

Results and discussion 

Fig. 6.1 (A to D) shows the original mid-infrared spectra of the extracted lipids 

and proteins of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B. In order to 

gain further insights into the modifications induced by the different UV treatments in 

lipids and proteins, difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the controls to the 

irradiated spectra. Difference spectra are shown in Fig. 6.2 and Fig. 6.4. In the resultant 

irradiated-minus-control difference spectra, upward-moving bands correspond to mid-

infrared bands that appear (or increase in intensity) after irradiation, while downward-

moving bands correspond to mid-infrared bands that disappear (or decrease in intensity) 

upon irradiation.

The spectra were normalized, baseline-corrected and a 13-point smooth was applied. The presented spectra correspond to the 

average of 6 replicate spectra. Spectra are shown offset to facilitate visualization. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1 

corresponding to the CO2 region was removed from the spectra.

UV effects on lipids 

In general, exposure to the different UV spectral regions resulted in similar 

overall effects on the lipids of the two strains tested. These effects included a drastic 

decrease in intensity of bands assigned to lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids 

(? 3290 cm-1, ? 1650 cm-1 and ? 1540 cm-1) (Fig. 6.2). Lipoproteins are known to be 

susceptible to oxidative damage, due to the presence of aromatic side chains residues 

(such as tryptophan or tyrosine) that act as chromophores during photosensitized 

reactions (Esterbauer et al., 1987; Salmon et al., 1990). Therefore, reducing the amount 

of lipoproteins in the cell could be a mechanism to minimize oxidative damage.

difference spectra. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1, corresponding to the CO2 region, was removed from the spectra.

On the other hand, it is also possible that photosensitized reactions occurring in 

the protein fraction of the molecule could have interfered with lipid-protein interactions, 

resulting in the dissociation of the lipid and protein moieties of the molecules (Salmon 

et al., 1990). As a result, during the process of lipid extraction, proteins previously 

associated with lipids could have been lost. 

Exposure to UV radiation of different wavelengths also resulted in an increase in 

intensity of methyl bands (? 2950 cm-1, ? 2870 cm-1, ? 1460 cm-1, ? 1380 cm-1) (Fig. 

6.2). This effect was particularly accentuated in UVC-treated Acinetobacter sp. 

PT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.2 C). Increasing methyl groups disrupts the packing of acyl chains and 

reduces the number of interactions in the membrane, leading to enhanced membrane 

fluidity (Zhang and Rock, 2008). Changes in membrane fluidity can also be inferred by 

the change in frequency of methylene bands at ? 2920 cm-1 and ? 2850 cm-1 that can be 

observed in the original spectra. Altered membrane fluidity, mediated by the expression 

of specific membrane proteins, have been shown to have a positive effect on cellular 

adaptation of Oenococcus oeni to stress (Delmas et al., 2001). Changes in membrane 

fluidity have also been associated with signal transduction involved in the activation of 

intracellular mechanisms of protection, following exposure to stress factors. For 

example, in plants, membrane fluidization is implicated in the activation of the heat-

shock response (Sangwan et al., 2002). Whether such a mechanism could be involved in 

the response of bacteria to UV radiation is unknown. Additionally, changes in 

phospholipid composition of the cell, consistent with the observed changes in the band 

at 1740 cm-1 assigned to esters of fatty acids (Rothschild et al., 1980), could also explain 

the increase in methyl bands verified in irradiated samples.  

In most cases, UV exposure also resulted in oxidative damage to lipids, denoted 

by the increased intensity of bands at 1018 cm-1 assigned to O-O bonds of 

hydroperoxides (Merle et al., 2010), 972 cm-1 assigned to trans C = C bonds (Le Dréau 

et al., 2009), as well as 1402 cm-1 assigned to carboxyl groups formed during the 

oxidation process (Nadtochenko et al., 2005) and 888 cm-1 assigned to CH2 and CH3 

rocking modes of oxidized lipids (Nadtochenko et al., 2005). In the case of UVC-treated 

Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G there was also an increase in intensity of a band at 1720 

cm-1 (Fig. 6.2 C), reflecting the possible formation of aldehydes due to lipid 

peroxidation (Le Dréau et al., 2009). In Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.2 A-C) 

effects on oxidative damage marker bands were noted mostly under UVC, while in 



Chapter 6 

103 

Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B oxidation seemed to occur under every spectral region (Fig. 

6.2 D-F).  

In the case of Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B exposed to UVB, a marked increase 

in the area between 1200-900 cm-1 and a general increase in the area between 3000 and 

3500 cm-1, dominated by OH bands particularly associated with polysaccharides 

(Gonzaga et al., 2005), as well as a decrease in all the CH region (3000 to 2800 cm-1) 

and the ester carbonyl band (1740 cm-1), were observed. Together, these observations 

suggest an alteration in the lipid composition of the cell, with an increase in the relative 

abundance of glycolipids in detriment of fatty acids. A relative increase in glycolipids 

could contribute to enhance the stability of the cell membrane when confronted with 

environmental changes due to the ability of these compounds to undergo interlipid 

hydrogen bonding via glycosyl headgroups (Curatolo, 1987) and has been reported in 

the response of bacteria to acid stress and temperature shifts (Hunter et al., 1981; 

Fernández Murga et al., 2000; Taranto et al., 2006). On the other hand, Pseudomonas 

species are known to produce extracellular glycophospholipids containing fatty acids 

with 10 and 12 carbons (Silipo et al., 2002; Andolfi et al., 2008). The production of 

such kind of compound could also account for the increase in glycolipids and at the 

same time explain the smaller effects of UVB on the lipoproteins of Pseudomonas sp. in 

the UVB treatment (Fig. 6.2 E), since these molecules contain amide links (Silipo et al., 

2002). 

PCA scores and loadings plots of the analysis of the spectra of lipids of 

Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G exposed to the different irradiation regimes are presented in 

Fig. 6.3 A and 6.3 B. The PCA score plot revealed a clear separation between control 

and irradiated samples along PC1, while the different wavelength treatments were 

separated along PC2. Among the different irradiation regimes, UVA and UVC were 

found together in negative PC2, whereas UVB was in positive PC2. Control samples 

(negative PC1) were separated from irradiated samples (positive PC1) by higher 

intensity of bands assigned to ester carbonyls from phospholipids and triglycerides 

(1740 cm-1), amide I and amide II of lipoproteins (1654, 1546 cm-1) as well as bands 

assigned to phospholipids and/or glycolipids (1230, 1074 cm-1). Irradiated samples 

displayed enhanced intensity of methyl bands (2954 and 1460 cm-1) as well as bands 

associated with lipid peroxidation products, including trans C = C bonds (970 cm-1) and 

CH2 and CH3 rocking modes of oxidized lipids (888 cm
-1). Therefore, PCA confirmed 

the involvement of changes in lipid composition and/or structure, as well as effects

exerted on lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids, in differentiating irradiated 

and non-irradiated samples, as suggested from the analysis of difference spectra.

sp. PT5I1.2G (A, B) and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B (C, D). 

 

The different UV treatments were discriminated mostly along PC2 being UVB 

irradiated samples characterized by higher intensity of bands assigned to methylene 

groups (2914 cm-1, 2846 cm-1), ester groups of phospholipids and triglycerides (1740 

cm-1) and nitrogen-containing lipids and/or lipoproteins (1654, 1546 cm-1), while UVC-

treated samples were mostly differentiated by higher intensity of bands assigned to 

phospholipids and/or glycolipids (1214, 1158 cm-1) and oxidation products (888 cm-1). 

PCA scores and loadings plots of the spectra of the lipids of Pseudomonas sp. 

NT5I1.2B are presented in Fig. 6.3 C and 6.3 D. Contrary to what was observed in 

Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, PCA analysis of the lipids of Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B 

in the different irradiation regimes did not show a clear separation between controls and 

irradiated samples, with the UVB treatment located together with the control samples in 

negative PC1, and separated from the remaining UV regimes located in positive PC1. 

Control and UVB-treated samples were differentiated from UVA-treated samples by 

enhanced intensity of bands assigned to carbonyl ester groups of phospholipids and 



Chapter 6 

105 

triglycerides (1740 cm-1), N-H stretching vibrations of amide and amine (3300 and 1656 

cm-1) and bands assigned to phospholipids and glycolipids (1216, 1180 cm-1), while 

UVA-treated samples were differentiated by enhanced intensity of CH3 bands (2940 cm
-

1) and bands associated with lipid oxidation products (888 cm-1). PC2 basically 

separated the UVC treatment from UVA-irradiated samples and controls. Separation of 

these sets of samples was mostly associated with bands assigned to CH bonds (2940, 

2926, 2896, 2842, 1458, 1378 cm-1), esters of phospholipids (1740 cm-1) as well as 

lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids (1656 and 1544 cm-1). 

Taken together, PCA results identify methyl and/or methylene groups associated 

with lipids, as well as lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids, as targets of UV 

radiation. Additionally, variations in bands assigned to phospholipids and/or glycolipids 

were also observed denoting changes on bacterial lipid composition upon exposure to 

UV radiation. Altered lipid composition can be a result of UV-induced damage to lipid 

metabolic pathways, for example, damage to enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. On 

the other hand, changes in lipid composition may also reflect a metabolic strategy of 

bacteria to cope with UV radiation. For instance, the general decrease in the relative 

abundance of phospho- and glycolipids in UV-treated samples, revealed in PCA results, 

could possibly be explained by the high susceptibility of unsaturated fatty acids to 

oxidative damage (Panagopoulos et al., 1990; Kramer et al., 1991). Decreased 

phospholipid and glycolipid content was also reported in the marine cyanobacteria 

Phormidium tenue in response to UV radiation and attributed to oxidative damage of the 

membrane (Bhandari and Sharma, 2011). Alternatively, UV-induced changes in the 

allocation of elements to biomolecules could also account for the observed changes in 

the relative proportion of phospho- and glycolipids with irradiation. Bacteria are known 

to replace their phospholipids with membrane lipids that do not contain any phosphorus 

in response to phosphorus limitation, so that less phosphorus is consumed for the 

formation of membranes (López-Lara et al., 2005). A reduction in phosphorus directed 

to membranes could be a mechanism elicited in order to ensure that enough phosphate 

supply is present for cellular repair strategies, such as nucleotide excision repair, which 

requires ATP (Batty and Wood, 2000).

UV effects on proteins 

UV irradiated samples were characterized by increased intensity of methyl (? 

2950 cm-1) and particularly methylene (? 2920 cm-1, ?2850 cm-1) bands associated with 

proteins and amino acids, especially in Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.4 A-C). The 

observed increase in intensity of methylene bands associated with proteins and amino 

acids with irradiation could be attributed to changes in protein composition, specifically, 

an increase in the relative proportion of amino acids rich in CH2 groups, like proline, 

lysine, isoleucine, glutamine or glutamic acid. The concentration of proline has been 

shown to increase upon UV exposure in the green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda and 

hypothesized to be a stress-defence response (Ková?ik et al., 2010).

difference spectra. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1, corresponding to the CO2 region, was removed from the spectra. 



Chapter 6 

107 

Additionally, enhanced intensity of bands assigned to methyl and methylene 

stretching vibrations can arise as a result of the introduction of CH3 and CH2 groups 

during the process of propionylation of lysine residues (Singh et al., 2012). However, 

the fact that lysine is not an strong infrared absorber and that its two main bands located 

near 1626 cm-1 and 1526 cm-1 are hidden by the amide I and amide II bands, 

respectively (Barth, 2000), limits further analysis. Propionylation is involved in the 

regulation of the activity of some enzymes in bacteria (Garrity et al., 2007). Whether 

this process could play a role in the metabolic response of bacteria to UV-induced stress 

is unknown. 

Mid-infrared spectroscopy also revealed a decrease in the intensity of bands 

assigned to aromatic amino acids, most notably tyrosine (1518 cm-1) and tryptophan 

(1452 cm-1) in all Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G irradiated samples (Fig. 6.4 A-C) and in 

UVB-irradiated Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B (Fig. 6.4 E). This decrease can be 

attributed to oxidative modifications of amino acid side chains (Lasch et al., 2001), that 

have also been observed upon exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide and gamma-

irradiation (Gault et al., 2005). Additionally, it is known that, at least in Escherichia 

coli, exposure to severe oxidative stress results in the inability of the cell to synthesize 

aromatic amino acids (Benov and Fridovich, 1999). Therefore, the observed decrease in 

intensity of mid-infrared bands associated with tyrosine and tryptophan can also be 

attributed to decreased synthesis of aromatic amino acids upon exposure to UV 

radiation.  

UV exposure also caused a general decrease in the intensity of the main bands 

detected in the region between 1200-900 cm-1. This spectral region comprises vibrations 

of amino acids, as well as sugar and phosphate moieties associated with glycosylated 

and phosphorylated proteins. Understanding the modifications in this region in response 

to UV radiation is, therefore, more difficult. Possible explanations for the observed 

changes in this spectral region include decreased protein phosphorylation levels, which 

have been found to occur in Xanthomonas oryzae upon UVC exposure (Huang et al., 

1995) and/or decreased protein glycosylation. Protein glycosylation is known to be 

involved in the regulation of the activity of specific proteins, including the RecA protein 

which mediates the SOS response of bacteria (Fischer and Haas, 2004). Whether 

decreased protein glycosylation levels fulfil a physiological role in the response of 

bacteria to UV radiation is unknown.  



Chapter 6 

108 

A substantial increase in intensity of the N-H bands around 3300 and 1650 cm-1 

was observed in Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G exposed to UVA (Fig. 6.4 A) and 

Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B exposed to UVB (Fig. 6.4 E), potentially denoting the 

accumulation of protein oxidation products, such as kynurenine which results from the 

oxidation of tryptophan. This is also consistent with the observed decrease in intensity 

of the tryptophan band at 1452 cm-1. Additionally, ROS-mediated conversion of 

histidine to asparagine (Cabiscol et al., 2000) could also account for the increase in the 

intensity of N-H bands. 

All irradiation treatments resulted in changes in the intensity and/or frequency of 

the component bands of amide I, which characterize the secondary structure of proteins, 

thus denoting changes in protein conformation with irradiation. Conformational changes 

in proteins upon UV exposure may be elicited in order to protect sensitive amino acid 

residues from direct UV-induced damage. For example, the proteins involved in 

protecting spore DNA from UV damage undergo a major conformational change upon 

binding to DNA (Hayes et al., 2000), which protects the protein against methionine 

oxidation and asparagine deamidation (Hayes and Setlow, 1997; Hayes et al., 1998). 

Protein conformational changes may also be involved in eliciting stress mechanisms and 

repair strategies, as observed in the case of the activation of the OxyR regulon which 

initiates the bacterial response to oxidative stress (Demple, 1991). Changes in bands 

characteristic of the secondary structure of proteins can also arise as a result of oxidative 

modifications of amino acid side chains, conformational stability alteration and/or 

aggregation of proteins (Lasch et al., 2001). Besides altered protein conformation due to 

UV-induced damage, it is also possible that synthesis of proteins with different 

conformation, including proteins involved in DNA repair, ROS scavenging, iron 

homeostasis and chaperones (Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b), 

may have occurred in response to UV radiation, and contributed for the observed 

changes in the amide I band. 

UV exposure also resulted in variable changes in the intensity of carboxylate 

bands. In the case of UVB- and UVC-treated Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, an increase 

in the intensity of the carboxylate bands (1590 and 1390 cm-1) was observed, which can 

reflect the occurrence of deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. This process can 

alter the tertiary structure of the protein and affect its biological properties and has been 

associated with a number of stress conditions, including UV exposure (D'Angelo et al., 

2001). In vivo deamidation of proteins can be used as a mechanism to initiate the 



Chapter 6 

109 

production of unique proteins of biological significance (Robinson and Robinson, 

2001). Whether such mechanism could be involved in the coordination of the response 

of bacteria to UV radiation is unknown. 

PCA analysis of the protein spectra of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G showed a 

general separation between control and UVB-treated samples (negative PC1) and UVA- 

and UVC-treated samples (positive PC1) (Fig. 6.5 A, B). UVA- and UVC-treated 

samples were characterized by enhanced intensity of the N-H band (3294 cm-1) and 

amide I band (1652 cm-1), potentially denoting the accumulation of protein oxidation 

products, while control and UVB-treated samples were characterized by enhanced 

intensity of bands assigned to the aromatic amino acid tyrosine (1518 cm-1) and CH3 

deformation of amino acids (1380 cm-1), as well as bands assigned to phosphorylated 

and/or glycosylated proteins (1084, 1064 cm-1). PC2 separated UVC-treated samples 

from the remaining irradiation regimes and was mostly associated with enhanced 

intensity of CH2 bands and carboxylate bands (1594, 1392 cm
-1) in UVC-treated 

samples, while the remaining irradiation regimes were characterized by enhanced 

intensity of the N-H band (3294 cm-1), tyrosine band (1518 cm-1) and bands assigned to 

phosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1084, 1064 cm-1).

In Pseudomonas sp, PCA analysis showed the separation of control and UVC-

treated samples (negative PC1) from UVA- and UVB-treated samples (positive PC1) 

(Fig. 6.5 C, D). Separation along PC1 was mostly due to bands 2924 and 2854 cm-1 

assigned to CH2 bands, as well as amide I (1656 cm
-1) and the carboxylate band at 1596 

cm-1 which were enhanced in UVA- and UVB-treated samples. Control and UVC-

treated samples showed enhanced intensity of amide II (1532 cm-1), as well as enhanced 

intensity of bands assigned to phosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1218, 1042 

cm-1). PC2 mostly separated UVA- and UVC-treated samples (negative PC2) from 

UVB-treated samples (positive PC2). Bands contributing the most for the separation 

along PC2 included 3294 cm-1 (N-H band), 1656 cm-1 (amide I) and bands assigned to 

phosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1222, 1048 cm-1), which were enhanced in 

UVB-treated samples. Bands assigned to CH2 groups (2924, 2854 cm
-1) and carboxylate 

groups (1590 and 1394 cm-1) were enhanced in UVA- and UVC-treated samples.  

Taken together these results highlight the involvement of changes in protein 

secondary structure, aromatic amino acids, protein phosphorylation, glycosylation 

and/or propionylation levels, as well as the potential formation of protein oxidation 

products, in the effects of UV irradiation in the two bacteria. 

 

Interspecific variability in UV effects on lipids and proteins 

While, in general, the two strains tested shared common effects upon exposure 

to each UV spectral region, substantial differences also occurred. For example, while 

effects of UVA radiation on the lipids of the two strains tested were very similar, effects 

of UVB differed considerably, particularly in the bands corresponding to lipoproteins 

and/or nitrogen-containing lipids (3300, 1650, 1540 cm-1) and the CH region (3000-

2800 cm-1). UVC effects also showed some differences between strains, particularly in 

the region between 1300-800 cm-1. Regarding proteins, differences of the effects of each 

spectral region in the two strains were mostly associated to effects on the N-H band (? 

3300 cm-1), carboxylate band (? 1590 cm-1), amide I component bands and tyrosine 

band (1518 cm-1). 

Differences in the original lipid and protein composition of the two strains can 

contribute to explain the different effects of each spectral region in each strain. For 

example, enhanced abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, highly susceptible to oxidative 

damage, can make bacteria more sensitive to photoreactions elicited by UV exposure 

(Ferreri and Chatgilialoglu, 2009). On the other hand, high abundance of aromatic 



Chapter 6 

111 

amino acids, which act as chromophores during photosensitized reactions (Pattison and 

Davies, 2006), might also render bacteria more susceptible to UV radiation. 

Alternatively, differences in the efficiency of defence mechanisms elicited to counteract 

the damage induced to proteins and lipids can also contribute to the differences 

observed in the type of damage produced by the same spectral region in the different 

strains. Further studies using complementary approaches to mid-infrared spectroscopy, 

such as mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and proteomics analysis, will help to 

explore the hypothesis emerging in the present study in order to gain further insights 

into the mechanisms of UV-based bacterial inactivation. 

 

Conclusions 

In the present work, the effects of exposure to UV radiation of different spectral 

regions on the lipids and proteins of two bacterial strains with distinct UV sensitivities 

were studied by mid-infrared spectroscopy. Exposure to UV radiation of different 

spectral regions caused a general increase in lipid methylation, accompanied by 

oxidative modifications and potentially altered lipid composition. Effects of UV 

radiation on proteins included changes in protein conformation and/or composition, 

oxidative damage to amino acid side chain residues and potentially changes in the 

propionylation, glycosylation and/or phosphorylation status of cellular proteins. 

Whether such modifications reflect UV-induced damage to biomolecules or could 

actually be the basis of a UV-stress response mechanism in bacteria is unknown and 

warrants further research.  

Infrared spectroscopy was proven to be an excellent tool to study changes in 

bacterial components upon UV exposure, providing detailed clues to drive future studies 

concerning the mechanisms involved in the inactivation of bacteria by UV irradiation.

Abstract 

The present work aimed to identify the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced 

during UVB exposure and their biochemical targets, in a set of bacterial isolates 

displaying different UV susceptibilities. For that, specific exogenous ROS scavengers 

(catalase/CAT, superoxide dismutase/SOD, sodium azide and mannitol) were used. 

Biological effects were assessed from total bacterial number, colony counts and 

heterotrophic activity (glucose uptake and respiration). DNA strand breakage, ROS 

generation, oxidative damage to proteins and lipids were used as markers of oxidative 

stress. Sodium azide conferred a statistically significant protection in terms of lipid 

oxidation and cell survival, suggesting that singlet oxygen might play an important role 

in UVB-induced cell inactivation. Mannitol exerted a significant protection against 

DNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation, assigning hydroxyl radicals to DNA 

and protein damage. The addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly protected 

the capacity for glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that superoxide and H2O2 are 

involved in the impairment of activity during UVB exposure. The observation that 

amendment with ROS scavengers can sometimes also exert a pro-oxidant effect 

suggests that the intracellular oxidant status of the cell ultimately determines the 

efficiency of antioxidant defences. 

 

Introduction 

UVB radiation represents the most cytotoxic waveband of solar radiation 

reaching the Earth’s surface, causing several structural and physiological effects in 

aquatic organisms (Moran and Zepp, 2000; Bancroft et al., 2007). UVB-induced 

damage to biological systems has traditionally been attributed to the direct absorption of 

UV photons by nucleic acids, resulting in lesions (photoproducts) that block DNA 

replication and RNA transcription and can ultimately lead to cell death (Mitchell and 

Karentz, 1993). Additionally, damage can also arise indirectly via photosensitization 



Chapter 7 

114 

processes involving the absorption of UV light by an endogenous or exogenous 

photosensitizer (Muela et al., 2002; Bolton et al., 2010). The electronically excited 

sensitizer can harmlessly revert back to its ground state via intramolecular decay 

processes or can damage other cellular material via reactive oxygen species (ROS) 

(Pattison and Davies, 2006). 

Cellular damage by photosensitization can occur by two major pathways, often 

called type I and type II mechanisms. In the type I process, the electronically excited 

sensitizer reacts directly with the cellular component, subtracting one electron or 

hydrogen atom from the cellular target, resulting in free radical formation (e.g., 

superoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals) which initiate free radical chain reactions. Type 

II mechanism involves energy transfer from the sensitizer to molecular oxygen with the 

consequent formation of an excited state of oxygen, singlet oxygen (Pattison and 

Davies, 2006). As a consequence of photosensitization, several cytotoxic reactions are 

triggered in the cells, including disruption of cell membrane, inactivation of different 

enzymes and damage of DNA that can eventually lead to cell death (Luksiene, 2003; 

Demidova and Hamblin, 2004; Luksiene, 2005). 

Several studies addressing the effects of UV radiation in aquatic bacteria have 

reported extensive variability in the UV sensitivity of bacteria (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta 

et al., 2000; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a), which can affect the structure 

and functioning of aquatic bacterial communities faced with changes in environmental 

UV levels. However, the observed variability does not seem to be supported by 

differences in the extent of DNA damage among different bacteria (Joux et al., 1999), 

suggesting that heterogeneity in susceptibility to UVB radiation could be due to 

differences in: (i) the type and magnitude of oxidative damage, (ii) the ability to cope 

with oxidative damage, and/or (iii) differences in the ROS involved in eliciting the 

damage in different bacteria. Furthermore, unlike DNA photoproducts, which can be 

effectively reversed through the process of photoreactivation, enhanced ROS production 

during UVB exposure and subsequent oxidative damage can have far wider 

consequences, since oxidative damage to biomolecules is energetically expensive to 

prevent and repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). However, the identity and role of 

ROS involved in UVB-induced damage to different bacteria remains mostly unknown.  

The objectives of this work were to ascertain the identity and the targets of ROS 

involved in UVB-induced damage using specific exogenous ROS scavengers and

monitoring their effects on biological and biochemical parameters in a set of 

phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates with different UVB sensitivities. 

 

Materials and methods 

Bacterial isolates 

The bacterial strains used in this study (Table 7.1) are representatives of the four 

culturable bacterial groups (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, 

Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) retrieved after irradiation of samples from the surface 

layers of an estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) (Santos et al., 2012a) and thus 

considered to represent the most relevant culturable members of a UV-stressed 

community. The isolates were grown in Marine Broth 2216 (Difco, Detroit, MI) at 25 

ºC with agitation (120 rpm). In the late-exponential phase (usually achieved in 8-14 h), 

cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, Thermo Scientific Heraeus 

Pico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were washed and resuspended in 

0.2-µ m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl solution and bacterial abundance was 

adjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1. Cell suspensions (30 

mL) were transferred to sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 mm; Corning) and irradiated 

(without the lid) with UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, main emission line of 302 

nm). Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected at pre-determined times to construct 

the inactivation curves, which were used to determine the LD50 (UVB dose necessary 

for the inactivation of 50 % of bacteria). UV intensities were measured with a 

monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, Bentham 

Instruments, Reading, UK).

In order to identify the different ROS involved in UVB-induced damage and 

assess their impact on bacterial survival and activity (glucose uptake and respiration), 

cell suspensions were amended with the exogenous scavengers sodium azide (specific 



Chapter 7 

116 

singlet oxygen scavenger), mannitol (specific hydroxyl radical scavenger), 

catalase/CAT (specific hydrogen peroxide scavenger) and superoxide dismutase/SOD 

(specific superoxide radical scavenger). Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared 

in PBS and 0.2-µ m-filter-sterilized, stored and used at a final concentration of 10 mM in 

the cases of sodium azide and mannitol, and at a 50 U mL–1 concentration for SOD and 

20 U mL-1 for CAT. These concentrations were chosen from preliminary experiments, 

as those that resulted in the highest reduction of intracellular ROS levels and minimal 

inhibition of the cells (data not shown). The cells were pre-incubated with the 

antioxidants for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, with agitation (120 rpm), after 

which cells were washed and resuspended in double distilled water (Joshi et al., 2011). 

Cell suspensions were irradiated at UVB LD50 (50.1 kJ m
-2 for Micrococcus sp., 40.3 kJ 

m-2 for Paracoccus sp., 49.3 kJ m-2 for Pseudomonas sp. and 37.0 kJ m-2 for 

Staphylococcus sp.) (Table 7.1). Aliquots for biological and biochemical analysis were 

collected before and after irradiation. During irradiation, temperature was kept at 25 ºC. 

Non-irradiated dark controls (cell suspensions unamended and amended with each 

tested scavenger), otherwise treated in the same way as the irradiated samples, were 

included in every experiment.  

For the determination of protein content and protein carbonyl levels, cell 

homogenates were prepared by collecting cells by centrifugation immediately after 

irradiation, resuspending them in cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) 

containing 1 mM EDTA, followed by sonication in ice (Branson Instruments Co. 

Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, 30-s pulses, 1-min cooling). Homogenates were 

stored at -80 ºC until the measurements. All experiments were repeated in three 

independent assays. Parameters were always determined in a minimum of three 

analytical replicates. Positive (H2O2-treated) and negative (untreated) controls were 

always included and processed along experimental samples in order to ensure proper 

functioning of the procedures.  

 

Colony counts 

Before and after each treatment, sample aliquots were serially-diluted in filter-

sterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and spread-plated in triplicate on marine agar 2216 

plates (Difco, Detroit, MI). The number of colony forming units per mL (CFU mL-1) 

was counted after 3 days of incubation at 25 ºC in the dark. The dilution and plating 



Chapter 7 

117 

procedures were carried out under low-luminosity conditions to minimize 

photoreactivation. 

 

Total bacterial number (TBN) 

For the determination of total bacterial numbers, samples were filtered through 

0.2-µ m-pore-size black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics, Livermore, CA, USA), and 

stained with 0.03 % (w/v) acridine orange (Hobbie et al., 1977). Cells were counted by 

epifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope (Leitz Me?technik, 

Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. At least 200 cells or 20 

microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate membranes.  

 

Glucose incorporation and respiration 

The effects of UV radiation on bacterial activity were estimated from glucose 

incorporation and respiration. Triplicate 10 mL aliquots of bacterial suspension plus a 2 

% (vol/vol) formalin-fixed control were incubated with [14C]glucose (Amersham 

Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK; SA 310 mCi mmol?1). The tracer concentration 

was 8.1 nM. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h, after 

which incubations were stopped by adding 2 % formalin (vol/vol) (Sigma, St. Louis, 

MO, USA). Samples for glucose incorporation were filtered through nitrocellulose 

filters (0.2-µm-pore-size; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) and rinsed three times with chilled 5 

% trichloroacetic acid. For the determination of bacterial respiration, samples were 

transferred to respiration bottles to which 200 µ L of 5 N HCl were added to drive out 

the 14CO2. A strip of filter paper saturated with 200 µ L of ethanolamine was suspended 

above the sample in the respiration bottle and used to absorb the emitted 14CO2 over a 

period of 24 h. The efficiency of 14C recovery was determined from a similar volume of 

water treated with [14C]bicarbonate. Nitrocellulose filters and paper filters from 

incorporation and respiration experiments, respectively, were then transferred to mini-

vials to which a volume of 1.5 mL of Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN 

Biomedicals, USA) was added. The radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was 

counted in a Beckman LS 6000 IC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, 

Inc., Fullerton, CA) (Gocke, 1977).

Intracellular ROS production 

Intracellular ROS production was detected using the probe 2',7'-

dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Cayman Chemical Co. Ltd., MI, 

USA) (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and 

washed with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), amended with the probe 

diluted in the same buffer (final concentration 10 µ M), and incubated for 30 min in the 

dark. Cells were subsequently washed, sonicated and 100 µ L of the cell extracts were 

mixed with 1 mL of the potassium phosphate buffer. The fluorescence of the samples 

was measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, 

Japan) at room temperature, with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission 

wavelength of 519 nm. The fluorescence intensity at 519 nm was corrected against 

blank controls (cell-free suspensions) and then normalized to protein content (see below 

for procedure) and compared with the values obtained before irradiation. Unless 

otherwise specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). 

Results were expressed per mg of protein. 

 

DNA strand breakage 

UV-induced DNA damage was assessed by the quantification of DNA strand 

breaks (DSB) using a modified version of the FADU (Fluorimetric Analysis of DNA 

Unwinding) method, as described by He and Häder (2002). In addition to the test 

samples (so-called P-samples), the method requires two sets of untreated control 

samples: samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples 

subjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by 

centrifugation (3,000 g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final 

concentration) in EDTA solution, followed by proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final 

concentration). A volume of 300 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the three sets of 

samples: (1) T-samples were neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 

s, following a 30 min incubation at room temperature; (2) B-samples were sonicated for 

2 min, neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl after a 30 min incubation and sonicated 

again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 µL of 

0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. 

A final concentration of 5 µ M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples and 

after centrifugation, a 1 mL volume of supernatant was used for the fluorescence 

measurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan 



Chapter 7 

119 

Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The fraction of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) 

was calculated as dsDNA = (P?B)/(T?B)×100, where T, P and B were fluorescence 

intensities of T-, P- and B-samples normalized to the protein content, respectively (He 

and Häder, 2002). All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). 

 

Lipid peroxidation 

Lipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive 

substances (TBARS) as described by Pérez et al. (2007). Control and irradiated cells 

were centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate 

buffer (pH 7.4) added of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM PMSF 

(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation in order to 

remove cellular debris, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 mL of 20 % 

trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was 

transferred to a new microtube and mixed with 1 mL of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid 

in 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. Samples were heated at 100 ºC for 

1 h, after which 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled and then mixed with 1.5 mL of 

butanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the organic fraction was removed and 

the absorbance at 535 nm was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV 

spectrophotometer. TBARS content was determined by the extinction coefficient of 156 

mM-1cm-1. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Results 

were expressed per mg of protein. 

 

Protein oxidation  

The carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined according to 

Semchyshyn et al. (2005). Aliquots of homogenates were incubated for 1 h at room 

temperature with 10 mM dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was 

omitted in the blanks. Proteins were precipitated with 500 µ L of 20 % trichloroacetic 

acid, centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min) and the pellet was washed three times with 1 mL 

of 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 

M guanidine hydrochloride. Samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed against a 

blank of 1 mL of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM 

potassium phosphate). The absorbance at 360 nm was determined and the molar 

absorption coefficient of 22 mM-1cm-1 was used to quantify the levels of protein 



Chapter 7

carbonyls. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Results 

were expressed per mg of protein. 

 

Protein concentration 

Protein concentration in cell homogenates was determined by the Bradford 

method using BSA as a standard (Bradford, 1976). 

 

Statistical analysis 

All experiments were repeated in three independent assays and biochemical and 

microbiological analysis were always conducted in triplicate. Differences between the 

treatments with and without scavengers were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the 

statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of 

variances. If variances were not homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was 

applied. If variances were still not homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test 

was used to assess the overall effect of treatment (Sokal and Rolf, 1995). 

 

Results 

Sodium azide significantly attenuated the reduction in colony counts upon 

irradiation in all strains tested (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), from 16.2 % to 45.8 %. Pre-

treatment of bacterial cell suspensions with CAT, SOD, or mannitol did not 

significantly affect survival during UVB exposure in any of the strains tested (Fig. 7.1 

A). Sodium azide was also the only scavenger to mitigate the UVB reduction in total 

bacterial number, by up to 32.2 %, in all of the strains tested (Fig. 7.1 B).

Amendment with CAT significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) attenuated the 

inhibition of bacterial activity by UVB in all the strains tested, from 14.1 % to 49.6 %. 

SOD also exerted a significant protective effect against UVB-induced inhibition of 

bacterial activity in all strains tested ranging from 14.6 % to 55.4 %. Mannitol exerted a 

similar protective effect against UVB inhibition of bacterial activity ranging from 17.1 

% to 52.4 %. Effects of sodium azide ranged from a 31.4 % exacerbation to a 53.2 % 

attenuation of the detrimental effects of UVB on activity (Fig. 7.2 A). CAT and SOD 

also significantly attenuated the inhibition of glucose respiration in all the strains tested, 

by up to 48.6 % and 50.3 %, respectively (Fig. 7.2 B).

Sodium azide significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) attenuated ROS 

generation during UVB exposure in all strains ranging from 6.3 % to 20.8 %. A similar 

effect was observed in mannitol-amended cells, which displayed a 5.3 % to 40.2 % 

reduction in ROS generation during UVB exposure, compared to unamended cells. 

Effects of amendment with CAT ranged from a 13.7 % attenuation to a 4.9 % increase 

in ROS generation during irradiation, while amendment with SOD either did not 

significantly affect ROS generation or resulted in a 17.6 % increase in ROS levels under 

UVB (Fig. 7.3). 

Amendment of cell suspensions with mannitol significantly (1-way ANOVA, p 

&amp;lt;0.05) attenuated the formation of DSB during UVB exposure in all strains tested, 

from 2.2 % to 10.0 %. Amendment with CAT increased DSB from 6.3 to 15.7 % (1-

way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Pre-treatment of cells with SOD also increased DNA damage 

during UVB exposure from 6.4 to 13.8 % (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Sodium azide

either had no significant effect or increased DSB during irradiation by up to 9.2 % (Fig.

Sodium azide significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) decreased TBARS 

generation upon UVB exposure from 8.5 % to 21.7 %. Effects of amendment with CAT 

ranged from a 26.7 % attenuation to a 18.8 % increase of TBARS levels during 

irradiation. Pre-treatment of cells with SOD also resulted in variable effects on lipid 

peroxidation during UVB irradiation, ranging from a 25.1 % attenuation to a 27.2 % 

increase, while in mannitol-amended cells TBARS levels were either decreased by up to 

17.5 % or increased by up to 24.1 % (Fig. 7.5).

Mannitol significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) attenuated protein carbonyl 

levels during UVB exposure in all strains tested, ranging from 4.4 % to 23.1 %. CAT 

amendment either had no significant effect or increased carbonyl levels by up to 13.6 %. 

Effects of amendment with SOD ranged from a 33.3 % attenuation to a 66.7 % increase 

(Fig. 7.6). In sodium azide-amended cells protein carbonyl levels were either decreased

generation is an important outcome of the exposure of bacteria to UVB radiation and 

can actually be a more prominent threat to microorganisms than direct DNA damage 

(Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Yet, information on the role of UVB-induced ROS in 

biological and biochemical damage to bacteria is rather scarce and mostly obtained 

indirectly from transcriptomic and proteomic studies reporting the induction of 

antioxidant defences upon exposure of bacteria to UVB radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; 

Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). 

In the present work, the involvement and targets of ROS in UVB-induced 

damage was investigated in a direct experimental approach using specific scavengers 

for different ROS (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and superoxide 

radical) and assessing the effects on biological and biochemical parameters. A set of 

isolates with distinct UV sensitivities, isolated after irradiation of estuarine surface 

water samples, were used as tentative representatives of the culturable fraction of a UV-

stressed community. Therefore, their responses can provide insights into the 

mechanisms by which global changes, such as changes in UVB levels, are affecting the 

functions of bacterial mixed communities and may impact biogeochemical cycles. 

The effects of ROS scavengers on biological and biochemical parameters were 

variable among the different isolates tested. In the present work, two Gram-positive 

(Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp.) and two Gram-negative (Paracoccus sp. and 

Pseudomonas sp.) phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates were used. Due to their 

cell wall characteristics, Gram-positive bacteria have been proposed to be more resistant 

to UV radiation than Gram-negative strains (Jagger, 1985). However, significant 

fundamental differences in neither UVB sensitivity, nor in the responses to amendment 

with different scavengers, between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were 

observed, in accordance with previous works (Agogué et al., 2005). 

 

Singlet oxygen  

Sodium azide exerted a significant protective effect on culturable and total 

bacterial abundance (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) during UVB exposure. Singlet oxygen 

also protected against lipid peroxidation (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) during irradiation. 

These results suggest that singlet oxygen (1O2) is an important mediator of UVB-

induced cell inactivation, in which lipid oxidation probably plays an important role. 

Previous studies had already demonstrated the ability of 1O2 to react with the double 



Chapter 7 

125 

bond of unsaturated fatty acids leading to the formation of lipid hydroperoxides (Vile 

and Tyrrell, 1995). 

 

Hydroxyl radical 

The observation that mannitol was the only scavenger that significantly reduced 

the amount of DSB during UVB exposure confirms the involvement of hydroxyl radical 

(•OH) in DNA damage, in accordance with previous observations (Peak and Peak, 

1990). Mannitol was also able to significantly attenuate protein carbonylation during 

UVB exposure, suggesting the importance of the hydroxyl radical in protein oxidative 

damage during UVB exposure.  

In the cell, the hydroxyl radical can be formed via the Fenton reaction in which 

the divalent metal ions Fe2+ or Cu+ catalyze the degradation of hydrogen peroxide (Bast 

et al., 1991; Koppenol, 2001), according to the reaction: 

H2O2 + Fe
2+ ? OH- + Fe3+ + •OH 

To a lesser extent, the hydroxyl radical can also be formed via the Haber-Weiss 

reaction in which superoxide reduces Fe2+ or Cu+, which can subsequently combine 

with hydrogen peroxide to form the hydroxyl radical (Kehrer, 2000)  

O2
?? + H2O2 ? 

•OH + OH- + O2 

Additionally, the hydroxyl radical can also be formed by metal-independent 

processes, as a result of the decomposition of peroxynitrite, an oxidant formed by 

combination between nitric oxide and the superoxide radical (Hogg et al., 1992). 

The extremely short half-life of the hydroxyl radical limits its reactivity to the 

immediate vicinity from where it is formed. Therefore, Fe-S clusters of proteins and 

enzymes using iron as prosthetic metal are major targets of oxidative damage by the 

hydroxyl radical (Imlay, 2006). Iron bound to DNA can also catalyze the formation of 

the hydroxyl radical which then attacks DNA bases or the deoxyribosyl backbone of 

DNA to produce damaged bases or strand breaks (Imlay et al., 1988). 

 

Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide 

Glucose incorporation and respiration were effectively protected from UVB by 

amendment with exogenous CAT and SOD, suggesting that superoxide and/or hydrogen 

peroxide are involved in the impairment of bacterial activity. Glucose incorporation was 

also protected by amendment with mannitol, suggesting a role of the hydroxyl radical in 

the impairment of membrane processes. The auto-oxidation of flavoenzymes is 



Chapter 7 

126 

probably the predominant endogenous source of both O2
•- and H2O2 (Imlay, 2003), but 

the activity of SOD itself is also an important source of H2O2 (Buettner et al., 2006). 

Detrimental effects of H2O2 could be related to its ability to directly oxidize and thus 

alter the activity of proteins containing deprotonated cysteine residues (Pattison and 

Davies, 2006). Superoxide oxidizes and inactivates proteins containing Fe-S clusters, 

such as respiratory chain proteins of the membrane, releasing Fe2+ ions and hydrogen 

peroxide that can further produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical by the Fenton 

reaction. The resulting hydroxyl radical is very reactive and therefore preferentially 

affects the neighbourhood in which it is generated, compromising membrane integrity 

and the function of membrane transport proteins (Girotti and Giacomoni, 2007).  

 

Role of antioxidant defences in UVB-induced damage 

The antioxidant status is an important determinant of the magnitude of UVB-

induced oxidative injuries, with SOD and CAT usually considered as the first line of 

defence of cells against ROS (Apel and Hirt, 2004). However, in some cases 

amendment with ROS scavengers exacerbated the detrimental effect of UVB radiation 

on biological parameters. Such effect was not attributed to toxicity of the scavenger, 

since significant differences between dark controls without scavenger and dark controls 

amended with every scavenger tested were not found for any of the biological and 

biochemical parameters tested (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). In particular, a statistically 

significant increase in the amount of DSB was observed in SOD- and CAT-amended 

samples, suggesting that the activity of these enzymes can contribute to oxidative 

damage to biomolecules during exposure to UVB. It is well established that CAT is 

involved in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide and a potentially protective role of 

CAT in UV resistance among Acinetobacter sp. isolates was recently proposed (Di 

Capua et al., 2011). However, when intracellular antioxidant moieties are limited, CAT 

activity can generate ROS during UVB exposure (Heck et al., 2003; Heck et al., 2010). 

SOD can also increase the oxidative burden of the cell since hydrogen peroxide 

generated from its activity is a more oxidant species than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). 

Ultimately, depending of the intracellular oxidation status, the activity of these 

antioxidant enzymes in response to UVB light can be either protective or cytotoxic.

Conclusions 

The present work identifies an important role of singlet oxygen in UVB-induced 

cell inactivation, potentially by mediating oxidative damage to lipids, as suggested by 

attenuation of the reduction in cell abundance (culturable and total) and TBARS levels 

in sodium azide-amended samples. DNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation 

during UVB exposure were attenuated in samples amended with mannitol, suggesting 

the involvement of the hydroxyl radical in DNA and protein damage. Superoxide and 

hydrogen peroxide could play important roles in impairment of membrane transport and 

respiration during UVB exposure.

Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to explore the possible link between metals and 

UVB-induced damage in bacteria. The effect of growth in the presence of enhanced 

concentrations of different transition metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) on UVB 

sensitivity of a set of bacterial isolates was explored in terms of survival, activity and 

oxidative stress biomarkers (ROS generation, damage to DNA, lipid and proteins, and 

activity of antioxidant enzymes). Metal amendment, particularly Fe, Cu and Mn, 

enhanced bacterial inactivation during irradiation by up to 35.8 %. Amendment with Fe 

increased ROS generation during irradiation by 1.2 %-13.3 %, DNA damage by 10.8 %-

37.4 % and lipid oxidative damage by 9.6 %-68.7 %. Lipid damage during irradiation 

also increased after incubation with Cu and Co by up to 66.8 % and 56.5 %, 

respectively. Mn amendment decreased protein carbonylation during irradiation by up 

to 44.2 %. These results reveal a role of Fe, Co, Cu and Mn in UVB-induced bacterial 

inactivation and the importance of metal homeostasis to limit the detrimental effects of 

ROS generated during irradiation.  

 

Introduction 

UVB radiation (280-320 nm) is the most detrimental wavelength of the solar 

radiation spectrum. The severest biological consequence of UVB radiation has been 

traditionally considered to be DNA damage, most notably the formation of DNA 

photoproducts (Häder and Sinha, 2005). However, UVB induced cell damage can also 

arise as the result of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during 

irradiation and subsequent oxidative damage to biomolecules (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 

1999). Studies reporting the induction of antioxidant defences during UVB exposure of 

bacteria support the hypothesis of the contribution of oxidative stress to UVB-induced 

damage (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). The cellular and biological 

consequences of ROS are strongly influenced by metal ion homeostasis (Halliwell and 



Chapter 8 

130 

Gutteridge, 1999). Metal ions, most notably iron (Fe2+) and copper (Cu+), play a 

catalytic role in the generation of ROS through participation in Fenton and Haber-Weiss 

reactions that generate toxic hydroxyl radicals that can damage biomolecules and cause 

cell death (Wardman and Candeias, 1996). Since many of the respiratory chain proteins 

use iron as a cofactor, they are among the first targets of oxidative damage through the 

Fenton reaction (Choksi et al., 2008). The hydroxyl radicals generated in the process 

can in turn attack membrane lipids and other membrane proteins (Bourdon and Blache, 

2001; Niki et al., 2005). On the other hand, cobalt (Co2+) can compete directly with 

iron, thereby affecting the synthesis of Fe-S clusters (Ranquet et al., 2007; Thorgersen 

and Downs, 2007), leading to decreased iron bioavailability and eventually oxidative 

stress (Fantino et al., 2010).  

Recently, a possible protective role of transition metal ions against ionizing 

radiation has been discussed. A high capacity for intracellular copper ion sequestration 

was detected in Kineococcus radiotolerans (Domain Bacteria, Phylum Actinobacteria) 

that provided protection against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation (Bagwell et 

al., 2008). Manganese (Mn2+) ions also seem to play a role in the prevention of 

oxidative damage during exposure to different types of stress including UVC radiation, 

gamma-irradiation, wet and dry heat and H2O2 (Daly et al., 2007; Barnese et al., 2008; 

McEwan, 2009; Daly et al., 2010; McNaughton et al., 2010; Slade and Radman, 2011). 

Zinc (Zn2+) uptake is also a key component of the adaptive response to peroxide stress 

(Gaballa and Helmann, 2002), protecting copper-treated Escherichia coli against 

superoxide killing (Korbashi et al., 1989) and countering the effects of oxidative stress 

in Lactococcus lactis (Scott et al., 2000). 

Increased levels of proteins involved in iron homeostasis, induction of iron-

sequestering protein-encoding genes and repression of genes involved in iron uptake 

have been observed in bacteria irradiated with UVB (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-

Surget et al., 2009a), suggesting the importance of regulation of the intracellular iron 

ion pool following UVB exposure. However, whether certain transition metal ions play 

a physiological role in bacterial resistance to environmentally relevant UV radiation, 

most notably UVB radiation, remains uncertain. This information is critical to 

understanding the effects of UV radiation on the ecological context of natural 

communities, where these metals can be particularly enriched when industries and 

agriculture facilities are located nearby (Zhou et al., 2008). Furthermore, understanding 

the role that metals play during UV-induced bacterial inactivation can help develop 



Chapter 8 

131 

more efficient photocatalytic disinfection strategies (Sciacca et al., 2010). Accordingly, 

the objectives of this study were to investigate the potential synergistic effects of 

transition metals and exposure to UVB radiation in bacterial cells and evaluate their 

potential protective role against structural and functional cellular damage elicited during 

UVB exposure in a set of bacterial isolates. 

 

Materials and methods 

Culture conditions and experimental layout 

The bacterial strains used in the present study were previously isolated from the 

surface waters of an estuarine system. The isolates are affiliated to different 

phylogenetic groups: Alphaproteobacteria (Paracoccus sp.), Gammaproteobacteria 

(Pseudomonas sp.), Bacilli (Staphylococcus sp.) and Actinobacteria (Micrococcus sp.) 

and display different UVB sensitivities (Santos et al., 2011), which are presented in 

Table 8.1 as LD50 values (UVB dose necessary for the inactivation of 50 % of bacteria).  

Stock solutions (10 mM) of various transition metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) 

were prepared in deionized, filter-sterilized water from the corresponding metallic salts: 

ferrous ammonium sulfate, manganese chloride, zinc sulfate, cupric sulfate and cobalt 

sulfate. In order to select the metal concentration that affected the least the growth curve 

of the different bacterial strains, and that was subsequently used for UV exposure 

assays, preliminary experiments were conducted with different metal concentrations (1 

µ M, 10 µ M, 100 µ M) in TGY medium (1.0 % tryptone, 0.1 % glucose, 0.5 % yeast 

extract) (Bagwell et al., 2008). Growth curves obtained in these conditions were 

compared with those obtained in the absence of added metals. Cultures were incubated 

for up to 72 h at 25 ºC with agitation (120 rpm). At pre-determined intervals, triplicate 

aliquots were collected and the optical density (OD) at 600 nm was determined.

From the results of the preliminary experiments, 1 µ M was found to be the 

maximum non-inhibitory concentration for all metals (see results sections) and used in 

the UV irradiation assays. Liquid cultures of each isolate were grown to mid-

exponential phase (OD600 of 0.2-0.3) in TGY or TGY amended with 1 µ M of Co, Cu, 

Fe, Mn or Zn. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, Eppendorf 

Centrifuge 5415R, Hamburg, Germany) and the pellet was washed three times with 50 

mM EDTA/ 10 mM Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; pH 7.5) to remove cell surface-

adsorbed transition metals (Bagwell et al., 2008). Cells were then resuspended in 10 

mM PBS for determination of bacterial abundance by epifluorescence microscopy 

(Hobbie et al., 1977), and adjusted to 106 cells mL-1 with 10 mM PBS. A convenient 

volume of cell suspension was transferred to sterile 150 x 25 mm plastic tissue culture 

dishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that the depth of the liquid 

was &amp;lt;2 mm. The lid was removed from the culture during UVB irradiation (Philips TL 

100 W/01 lamps, main emission wavelength line of 302 nm). Metal-amended and 

unamended dark controls (covered in aluminum foil) treated in the same way as the 

irradiated samples were included in every experiment. Inactivation curves of bacterial 

strains under the different metal-amended and unamended regimes were determined by 

irradiating bacterial suspensions under UVB for a total light dose of 60 kJ m-2 and 

collecting aliquots at pre-determined light doses for CFU determination, as described 

below. UV intensities were measured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed 

at the sample level (DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK). Inactivation curves 

were used to determine the LD50 in metal-amended and unamended conditions. 

Additionally, aliquots of cell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation at 

the LD50 of unamended samples (50.1 kJ m
-2 for Micrococcus sp., 40.3 kJ m-2 for 

Paracoccus sp., 49.3 kJ m-2 for Pseudomonas sp. and 37.0 kJ m-2 for Staphylococcus 

sp.) (Table 8.1) for biological and biochemical analysis. For protein carbonyls and 

antioxidant activity (catalase/CAT and superoxide dismutase/SOD) determinations, 

cells were immediately resuspended in cold 50 mM PBS (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM 

EDTA and sonicated in ice (Branson Instruments Co. Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, 

30-s pulses, 1 min cooling). The extracts were centrifuged (10,000 x g, 15 min) and the 

supernatant frozen at -80 °C until analysis. All experiments were repeated in three 

independent assays. Parameters were always determined in a minimum of three 

analytical replicates. Positive (50 mM H2O2-treated) and negative (untreated) controls 



Chapter 8 

133 

were always included and processed along experimental samples in order to ensure 

proper functioning of the procedures on all strains. 

 

Colony forming units (CFU) 

Before and after irradiation, sample aliquots were serially-diluted in 1 x PBS and 

spread-plated in triplicate in agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI). Colonies were counted 

after up to 7 days of incubation in the dark, at 25 ºC. The dilution and plating 

procedures were carried out under low-luminosity conditions to minimize 

photoreactivation.  

 

Glucose uptake 

The effects of UV radiation combined with the exposure to metals on bacterial 

energy metabolism were assessed from glucose uptake activity, using a protocol adapted 

from Harada et al. (2010). Triplicate 1.5 mL aliquots of bacterial suspension and a 5 % 

(wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid-fixed control were incubated with [14C]glucose (Amersham 

Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK; SA 310 mCi mmol-1) at a saturating concentration 

of 150 µ M. Samples were incubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. 

Incubations were stopped by the addition of chilled 5 % (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid 

(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters 

(0.2-µm-pore-size; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). Filters were then rinsed three times with 

chilled 5 % trichloroacetic acid and transferred to eppendorfs. A volume of 1.5 mL of 

Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, USA) was added. The amount 

of radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was determined in a Beckman LS 6000 

IC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). 

 

In vivo production of ROS  

In vivo production of ROS was detected using the probe 2',7'-

dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Cayman Chemical Co. Ltd., MI, 

USA) (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated samples were centrifuged and washed 

with 10 mM PBS (pH 7.0). After amendment with the probe (final concentration 10 

µ M), the mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min. Afterwards, cells were washed, 

sonicated and the cell extracts were mixed with potassium phosphate buffer. The 

fluorescence of the samples was measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan 

Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature (?ex. 490 nm; ?em. 519 nm). 



Chapter 8 

134 

The fluorescence intensity at 519 nm was corrected against the blank control (without 

cells) and then normalized to the biomass, determined as the amount of cellular protein 

according to the method of Bradford (Bradford, 1972). Unless otherwise specified, all 

reagents used for this and subsequent protocols were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St 

Louis, MO).  

 

DNA strand breakage 

UV-induced DNA damage was assessed using the quantification of DNA strand 

breaks (DSB) as a proxy, following a previously described procedure (He and Häder, 

2002). The method requires three sets of samples: test samples (so-called P-samples), 

samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples subjected to 

complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 

x g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final concentration) and proteinase 

K (0.25 mg mL-1 final concentration). A volume of 300 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was added 

to the three sets of samples: (1) T-samples were immediately neutralized with 300 µL of 

0.1 M HCl, incubated at room temperature for 30 min and sonicated for 15 s; (2) B-

samples were sonicated for 2 min, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, 

neutralized with 300 µ L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples 

were incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 µ L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 

s. 

A final concentration of 5 µ M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples. After 

centrifugation, the supernatant was used for fluorescence measurements (?ex. 350 nm; 

?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, 

Japan). The fraction of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was calculated as dsDNA = 

(P?B)/(T?B)×100, where T, P and B were fluorescence intensities of T-, P- and B-

samples normalized to the biomass, respectively.  

 

Lipid peroxidation 

Lipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive 

substances (TBARS) as previously described (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated 

cells were centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 

mM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM of the protease inhibitor PMSF 

(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Afterwards, cell suspensions were sonicated and 

centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 20 % 



Chapter 8 

135 

trichloroacetic acid. Following another centrifugation step at 10,000 x g for 5 min, 

supernatants were removed and mixed with 1 volume of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid 

in 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. After incubation at 100 ºC for 1 h, 

aliquots were removed, cooled and mixed with 1.5 volumes of butanol. The mixture was 

centrifuged (4,000 x g, 10 min) and the organic fraction was removed. The absorbance 

at 535 nm was read using a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer and 

TBARS content was determined using an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1cm-1. 

Results were normalized to the cell biomass. 

 

Protein oxidation 

The carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined as previously reported 

(Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of sonicated cells were incubated with 10 mM 

dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl for 1 hour at room temperature. In blanks, 

DNPH was omitted. In order to precipitate proteins, 20 % trichloroacetic acid was 

added, after which suspensions were centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min), and the pellet 

washed three times with 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was 

dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance at 360 nm was determined 

against a blank of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM 

potassium phosphate), and a molar absorption coefficient of 22 mM-1 cm-1 was used to 

quantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Results were normalized to the biomass. 

 

Antioxidant enzymatic activity 

Catalase (CAT) activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the 

rate of decomposition of H2O2 (Beers and Sizer, 1952). One unit of CAT activity was 

defined as the amount of activity required to decompose 1 µ mol of H2O2 per minute 

under the assay conditions. The strain Enterococcus faecalis was used as a negative 

control. A mixture of 18 mM hydrogen peroxide and sterile potassium phosphate buffer 

(1:5) was used as an additional negative control (Anderl et al., 2003). Superoxide 

dismutase (SOD) activity was determined according to McCord and Fridovich (McCord 

and Fridovich, 1969), in which a xanthine-xanthine oxidase system is used to generate 

superoxide and nitroblue tetrazolium is used as an indicator. One unit of SOD activity 

was defined as the amount of SOD that resulted in 50 % inhibition of the reduction of 

nitroblue tetrazolium. Potassium phosphate buffer was used as a blank. Results were 

normalized to the biomass. 



Chapter 8 

136 

Bacterial biomass 

Bacterial biomass was determined from the protein concentration in cell 

homogenates according to the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as 

a standard (Bradford, 1976). 

 

Statistical analysis 

All experiments were repeated in three independent assays and biochemical and 

microbiological analysis were always conducted in triplicate. Differences between 

treatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS v.17. 

Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of variances. If variances were not 

homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was applied. If variances were still 

not homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall 

effect of treatment. Stepwise multiple regression, used to identify groups of independent 

variables (ROS, DSB, TBARS and carbonyls levels, as well as SOD and CAT activity) 

with the most significant contribution to the variability of the dependent variable 

(bacterial inactivation expressed as LD50), was conducted with SPSS v. 17. 

 

Results 

Effects of UV-Irradiation on Biological and Biochemical Parameters 

To select metal concentrations that would not significantly affect neither the 

growth curve of bacterial isolates nor the level of oxidative stress markers on 

unirradiated cells, thereby minimizing any potential toxic effect of the metals during 

irradiation experiments, different metal concentrations were tested. A concentration of 1 

µ M affected the least the growth curve and did not significantly alter the levels of 

oxidative stress markers of cells (Table 8.2) and was therefore chosen for subsequent 

UV-assays. 

UVB inactivation curves of bacterial isolates grown with and without added 

concentrations of metals are represented in Fig. 8.1. Dark controls for every metal 

treatment were also performed but not included in the figure for simplicity, since 

significant differences between dark controls of unamended and metal-amended 

samples were not observed (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05).

replicas (n = 9). Error bars are standard deviation of the mean. Where error bars are not visible, they are smaller than the graph 

symbol. D.C. – dark control. L.C. – light control (without metal). 

 

Compared to unamended samples, metal amendment generally reduced the LD50 

by up to 21.4 kJ m-2. This effect was particularly significant for the Cu, Fe and Mn 

treatments and variable depending on the bacterial isolate (Table 8.1). The effects of 

different transition metals on survival and activity during UVB exposure are represented 

in Fig. 8.2. Amendment with Cu, Fe and Mn significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) 

decreased survival following exposure to UVB by 10.8 %-27.7 %, 16.5 %-35.8 % and 

13.1 %-31.0 %, respectively, in all isolates tested (Fig. 8.2 A). Depending on the strain, 

the effects of metal treatment were not significant, protective or detrimental to glucose 

incorporation during irradiation (Fig. 8.2 B).  

Treatment with Co and Zn resulted in either an increase or attenuation of ROS 

generation, depending on the strains. Cu and Fe treatments were responsible for a net 

increase in ROS generation during UVB exposure by up to 9.8 and 13.3 %, respectively. 

Amendment with Mn significantly attenuated ROS generation during irradiation (up to 

20.5 %; 1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) in all strains (Fig. 8.3 A).

Cultures grown with additional concentrations of Co, Cu and Fe displayed 

increased TBARS formation during irradiation by 56.5 %, 66.8 % and 68.7 %, 

respectively. Treatment with Zn either had no effect or increased TBARS generation 

during irradiation by up to 53.5 %, while Mn either attenuated or increased UV-induced

Multiple Stepwise Linear Regression 

To obtain further insights on the influence of metals on UV-induced 

inactivation, a multiple stepwise linear regression analysis was applied to the dataset 

using LD50 as a dependent variable and oxidative stress markers (ROS levels, DSB, 

TBARS, protein carbonyls, CAT and SOD activity) as predictor variables (Table 8.3).

Co, 96.5 % of the variation in LD50 was predicted by the contributions of SOD, 

carbonyls and CAT. In Cu-treated samples, variations in LD50 were not significantly 

explained by any of the independent variables used. In the Fe treatment, 99.3 % of the 

variability in LD50 was explained by ROS, TBARS and DSB, while in Mn treatments, 

32.7 % of the variation in LD50 was explained by TBARS. In the Zn treatment, 99.8 % 

of the variations in LC50 was explained by CAT, carbonyls and ROS. 

 

Discussion 

Research conducted with several biological systems has highlighted the role of 

transition metal ions in protecting against the detrimental effects of gamma-radiation, 

UVC radiation, wet and dry heat and H2O2 (Daly et al., 2004; Bagwell et al., 2008; 

Ghosh et al., 2011; Granger et al., 2011). However, the role of transition metals on the 

susceptibility of bacteria to environmentally relevant UV radiation remains unknown. 

This lack of information impairs the realistic understanding of UV effects in bacterial 



Chapter 8 

142 

communities in natural environments where metals are frequently present, seasonally 

variable and can represent additional stress factors (Zhou et al., 2008).  

In the present work, the effect of five transition metals on the UV sensitivity and 

UV-induced cellular damage on a set of bacterial isolates was studied. The 

concentrations of metals used were generally in agreement with reported environmental 

concentrations in aquatic systems, particularly in the runoff of urban areas (Mudhoo et 

al., 2012). The importance of metals to UVB-induced damage was evident from the 

shift in the descriptors that contributed the most to explain bacterial inactivation 

(expressed as LD50) following treatment with different metals, as revealed by linear 

regression. 

 

Role of Co, Cu and Fe 

Despite the observed variability in the effects of UV-induced damage in the 

different strains tested, amendment with metals generally decreased the dose necessary 

for inactivation by UVB (LD50), thereby suggesting a synergistic effect of metals and 

UVB radiation in bacterial cell damage.  

The Fenton reactive metals Fe and Cu had a significant detrimental effect on 

bacterial survival during irradiation, potentially associated to enhanced ROS and 

TBARS generation following irradiation in metal-treated bacterial suspensions. In the 

case of Fe, an increase in DNA damage compared to untreated controls was also 

observed, and together with ROS generation and TBARS, accounted for 99.3 % of the 

variation in LD50, as shown by linear regression. Such effects are in line with the role of 

the divalent Fe ion (Fe2+) in promoting the generation of the powerful oxidant hydroxyl 

radical according to the following reaction:  

Fe2+ + H2O2 ? Fe
3+ + OH- + OH? 

The hydroxyl radical can in turn cause damage to any biomolecule. The current 

study confirms the involvement of Fe in UVB-induced oxidative damage and the 

importance of Fe homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in Fe influx, 

storage and expression of Fe-containing enzymes (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et 

al., 2009a) in limiting the detrimental effects of exposure to UVB.  

Under aerobic conditions, Cu (similarly to Fe) can participate in Haber-Weiss 

reactions to mediate the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Santo et al., 2011). In 

accordance to what was observed with Fe, treatment with Cu increased TBARS and 

ROS generation. However, as opposed to Fe, it did not significantly increase DNA 



Chapter 8 

143 

damage during irradiation. This observation can be explained, at least in Gram-negative 

bacteria, by the compartmentalization of hydroxyl radicals generated by Cu in the 

periplasm of the cell, which limited its damage to the membrane and cell wall 

(Macomber et al., 2007), thus accounting for the observed increase in TBARS in Cu-

amended samples.  

Irradiation of cell suspensions after treatment with Co also caused a significant 

increase in TBARS levels which, in Gram-negative bacteria, can be attributed to the 

ability of Co to react with H2O2 generated inside the cell by a Fenton-type reaction 

within the periplasmic space (Barras and Fontecave, 2011). The resulting hydroxyl 

radicals are able to subsequently attack membrane and cell wall components 

(Moorhouse et al., 1985; Barras and Fontecave, 2011).  

Together, these results suggest that the toxicity of ROS generated during UV 

exposure is mediated by intracellular metals, particularly by the more biologically 

relevant Fe and Cu, whose homeostasis plays a crucial role in limiting the detrimental 

effects of oxidative damage during UVB irradiation. 

 

Role of Mn 

Mn was the only metal that reduced protein carbonyl levels during UV exposure 

in all strains tested. High levels of intracellular Mn have also been shown to contribute 

to resistance of bacteria to UVC radiation and ionizing radiation by mitigating protein 

oxidation (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., 2011; Granger et al., 2011). The protective 

effect of Mn against protein carbonylation seems to stem from its ability to metallate 

mononuclear enzymes containing Fe-S clusters, thereby replacing Fe ions and 

preventing the formation of damaging hydroxyl radicals (Anjem et al., 2009). 

Additionally, Mn is also able to form complexes with metabolites that can scavenge 

superoxide, H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (Daly et al., 2010). Accordingly, cell 

suspensions added of Mn showed significantly lower (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) ROS 

generation, compared to the unamended counterparts. Surprisingly, the protective effect 

of Mn against protein carbonylation and ROS generation was accompanied by a 

statistically significant reduction in survival during exposure to UVB, compared to non-

amended controls, and in three of the strains tested, a significant increase in DNA 

damage was observed. The reason for such effects is still unclear, in face of current 

knowledge. Recently, a transcriptomic study surveying UVC effects on Deinococcus 

gobiensis reported an over twofold reduction in the levels of the Mn transporter mntA, 



Chapter 8 

144 

thus suggesting reduced Mn influx during irradiation (Yuan et al., 2012). It has been 

suggested that, by replacing Fe ions in the Fe-S clusters of proteins, Mn can selectively 

protect the function of metabolic pathways (e.g., pentose phosphate pathway), which 

may or may not be favourable for survival depending on the stressful condition (Berlett 

et al., 1990; Sobota and Imlay, 2011). Such replacement could have also compromised 

the correct functioning of the biochemical pathways on which these proteins participate, 

resulting in a detrimental effect on survival during UV exposure.  

The intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratio is also crucial in determining the 

protective effect of manganese against ionizing radiation (Daly et al., 2004; Daly et al., 

2007). For example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae accumulates Mn2+, but is sensitive to 

ionizing radiation due to its high requirement for Fe2+ (Archibald and Duong, 1986). It 

should be noted that the concentrations of Mn used in this study were chosen so that no 

significant effects on bacterial survival, activity and markers of oxidative stress were 

observed in the respective dark controls, in order to minimize the possible confounding 

effects of metal toxicity in the UV response. As a result, concentrations used were up to 

25 times lower than those reported in similar studies (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., 

2011; Granger et al., 2011), which could have hindered the detection of a potential 

protective role of Mn in UVB-induced damage that might require higher concentrations 

of manganese. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of Mn in photooxidative 

stress in bacteria. 

 

Experimental limitations on the determination of metal oxidation status 

The oxidation status of transition metals is important in determining their 

biological effects. The cycling between oxidation states is involved in oxidative stress, 

as in the case of Cu and Fe. When Cu2+ enters the cell it is readily reduced to the toxic 

Cu+ form which establishes complexes with thiol groups and certain amino acid 

residues, such as cysteine or ascorbic acid (Silver and Phung, 2005). In Escherichia coli 

the CueO protein in the periplasm converts Cu+ into the less permeable and thus less 

toxic Cu2+ (Singh et al., 2004). Metal iron, on the other hand, can be readily acquired by 

bacteria through the reduction of insoluble Fe3+ to soluble and potentially more toxic 

Fe2+, followed by transport of Fe2+ to the cytoplasm (Kammler et al., 1993; Braun et al., 

1998). 

Cycling between oxidation states is also involved in the protective effect of Mn 

against oxidative stress. Quenching of the superoxide radical and peroxyl radical species 



Chapter 8 

145 

by Mn2+ results in the formation of Mn3+ species, which are stabilized by coordination 

ligands such as pyrophosphate or carboxylic acids, thus lowering the redox potential of 

the Mn2+-Mn3+ couple (Stadtman et al., 1990).  

However, the ability of metal ions to undergo redox cyclying poses some 

complications in terms of experimental work. For example, while free Cu2+ ions are 

stable in air-exposed neutral aqueous solutions, free Cu+ can only be maintained at very 

acidic pH or in complexed forms (Magnani and Solioz, 2007). In the case of iron, in the 

presence of oxygen at a pH of ?7, Fe2+ is readily converted into the almost completely 

insoluble Fe3+ (Crossley et al., 2007). 

Another difficulty in the study of the interaction between cells and metals is the 

ability of metals to form complexes with biological molecules, which compromises the 

determination of the actual concentration of free, bioavailable metal in a biological 

system (Magnani and Solioz, 2007). Accordingly, by using a complex growth medium 

like TGY it is likely that some of the metal added to the bacterial cultures could have 

complexed with the components of the medium and it is therefore virtually impossible 

to predict the metallic species present in the system. However, it is unlikely that in 

natural aquatic systems these metals are freely available in solution in their cationic 

form, which makes our experimental conditions more similar to what probably occurs in 

the environment, than using, for instance, solution buffers with low metal-binding 

properties. 

 

Conclusions 

Metal amendment generally acted synergistically with UVB exposure to 

promote bacterial inactivation. Fe and Cu amendment exacerbated oxidative damage 

during UVB exposure, highlighting the importance of regulating the availability of these 

metals in the cell in response to irradiation. Mn attenuated the UV-induced formation of 

protein carbonyls but had a negative impact on survival, suggesting that displaced Fe 

ions might promote oxidative damage in other targets of the cell. Furthermore, the 

observation of some differences in the responses of Gram-negative and Gram-positive 

bacteria to the synergistic effects of metal amendment and irradiation (data not shown) 

might suggest that the presence of metals in the environment could influence the effects 

of UV exposure on bacterial community composition.

Abstract 

The influence of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability and the 

properties of the suspension medium on the UV sensitivity responses of two distinct 

bacterial assemblages (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) was assessed in laboratory 

experiments in which marine and brackish water communities were inoculated in (i) 

water of different nutrient contents (unamended and amended with high and low 

nutrient concentrations) and (ii) water of different origins (surface and subsurface). The 

effects on bacterial abundance and activity (leucine incorporation) were determined. 

Additionally, the influence of the suspension media on UV sensitivity responses was 

also studied in a set of bacterial isolates.  

Inoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient medium attenuated UV-

induced inhibition (by up to 34.2 % for abundance and 54.4 % for activity) compared to 

unamended conditions. Under nutrient depleted conditions, marine bacterioneuston was 

less affected by UV radiation than marine bacterioplankton (by up to 17.8 % for 

abundance and 21.4 % for activity). In brackish water, nutrient conditions did not affect 

inactivation but high nutrient concentrations attenuated the UV-induced inhibition of 

activity (up to 53.2 %). Suspension in natural water resulted in less pronounced 

inhibitory effects of UV exposure compared to suspensions prepared in a mineral 

solution (by up to 11.8 % for abundance and 13.2 % for activity). The effects of the 

different suspension media were more variable on isolated strains than in mixed 

assemblages.  

These results demonstrate that the nutrient content and quality of the suspension 

medium affect bacterial photobiological responses and that the abiotic environment of 

bacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity.

Introduction 

In aquatic ecosystems, UV radiation (UVR) can reach considerable depths (&gt; 20 

m) in the water column (Smith, 1989). Climate changes, namely, warming, acidification 

and modifications of ocean stratification patterns, are expected to increase the 

penetration of UVB wavelengths (280-320 nm) in the water column and enhance the 

exposure of aquatic organisms to UVB in forthcoming years (Andrady et al., 2010). 

These concerns make the study of the effects of UVB radiation on the structure and 

function of aquatic microbial communities a critical and timely subject. 

Field and laboratory studies indicate that exposure to UVR results in a general 

decrease in total bacterial abundance (Müller-Niklas et al., 1995; Pakulski et al., 1998), 

monomer incorporation (Bailey et al., 1983; Santos et al., 2011a), exoenzymatic 

activities (Müller-Niklas et al., 1995; Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption 

(Pakulski et al., 1998; Joux et al., 2009), protein and DNA synthesis (Herndl et al., 

1993; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Hernández et al., 2007; Joux et al., 2009; Santos et al., 

2012b) and single-cell activity (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006). 

UVB radiation has both direct and indirect effects on cells. The direct effects of 

UVB result from the absorption of UV photons by DNA and proteins (Cadet et al., 

2005b; Pattison and Davies, 2006). Additionally, damage can arise as a result of 

photosensitized reactions whereby a photosensitizer (endogenous or exogenous) absorbs 

light, enters an excited state and initiates damaging photodynamic reactions that can 

affect lipids, proteins and DNA (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; 

Girotti, 2001; Pattison and Davies, 2006). Endogenous photosensitizers include 

porphyrin derivatives and flavins present inside the cell, while exogenous 

photosensitizers include humic substances and photosynthetic pigments (Curtis et al., 

1992).  

The impact of solar UVR on marine microorganisms is complex and depends on 

both the radiation levels received and on several environmental (temperature, salinity, 

and nutrients) (Ogbebo and Ochs, 2008; Joux et al., 2009; Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010; 

Matallana-Surget et al., 2010) and biological (specific sensitivity, repair mechanisms, 

nutritional state, and growth phase) (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010) 

factors. Nutrients, in particular, can influence susceptibility to UVR by affecting the 

penetration of radiation in the water body (Joux et al., 2009) or altering bacterial 

physiology (Chrzanowski and Kyle, 1996; Bowden and Li, 1997; Ferenci, 1999; 

Klan?nik et al., 2009).  



Chapter 9

The light history of a bacterial assemblage can also affect the response of 

bacterial communities to UVR. For example, exposure to solar radiation inhibits 

bacterial productivity in surface waters (0.5 m) but stimulates activity in deep waters 

(80 m) (Hernández et al., 2007). The reduced sensitivity of bacterioneuston inhabiting 

the top millimetre of the water column (or surface microlayer, SML) compared to 

bacterioplankton inhabiting underlying waters (UW) is also considered indicative of the 

influence of light history on the effects exerted by UVR on bacterial communities 

(Santos et al., 2011a). Accumulation of exopolysaccharides and chromophoric dissolved 

and particulate organic matter at the air-water interface has also been suggested to 

account for the enhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to solar radiation (Elasri and 

Miller, 1999; Whitehead and Vernet, 2000; Obernosterer et al., 2005). However, 

exogenous photosensitizers, such as humic substances and phenolic compounds, which 

can affect bacterial photobiological responses (Muela et al., 2000), concentrate at the 

SML (Liss, 1975; Carlson, 1982) and may influence the UV sensitivity responses of 

microorganisms at the air-water interface.  

The objectives of this work were to study the role of nutrients and suspension 

medium on the UV sensitivity of bacterioplankton and bacterioneuston. Additionally, 

the variability of the effects of different suspension media on UV-induced damage was 

also addressed in a set of bacterial isolates.  

 

Materials and methods 

Sampling  

Samples were collected from an outer oligotrophic marine section (CN, 40º 38’ 

N, 08º 46’ W) and an inner mesotrophic brackish water section (I6, 40º 35’ N, 08º 41’ 

W) of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). Sampling was conducted on three consecutive days in 

June 2010, around the time of the summer solstice when UVB levels are the highest 

(Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Daily solar radiation levels on the period of sampling ranged 

from 30 to 35 kJ m-2 (climetua.fis.ua.pt/legacy/main/current_monitor/cesamet.htm). At 

the moment of sampling, the sky was clear with minimum wind conditions (&amp;lt;2 m s-1). 

Samples were collected approximately at noon at high tide. This time was previously 

determined as the moment during the tide that best corresponded to minimum 

differences in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) concentrations (an 

indicator of the optical properties of water samples) between water from the SML and 



Chapter 9 

150 

UW (data not shown) to minimize the interference of optical properties in UV 

sensitivity responses of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton.  

Two 0.25-m x 0.35-m glass plates that roughly collect the upper 60-100 µ m of 

the water column were used for bacterioneuston sampling (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). 

SML water was transferred to acid-rinsed sterilized glass bottles. Samples from 

underlying water were taken directly by submerging acid-rinsed sterilized glass bottles 

to a depth of approximately 20 cm. The samples were maintained in the shade at 4 ºC 

during the transport to the laboratory and were processed within 3 h of collection.

sensitivity responses of bacterioneuston, bacterioplankton and bacterial isolates. SML – surface microlayer, UW – underlying water, 

AMS – artificial mineral solution. 

 

Physical and chemical properties of the original samples  

Temperature and conductivity were measured in the field using a WTW LF 196 

Conductivity Meter (WTW, Weilheim, Germany). Chlorophyll a was estimated 

fluorometrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 100 mL triplicate 

samples through Whatman GF/C glass filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and 

overnight cold extraction in 90 % (v/v) acetone. Samples for nutrient analysis were 

filtered through 0.45-µm-pore-size cellulose acetate membrane filters (GE Osmonics 

Labstore, Minnetonka, MN). Nutrient concentrations (dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 

phosphate, silicate and ammonia) were determined using standard procedures 



Chapter 9 

151 

(Grasshoff et al., 1983). A spectrophotometer (Thermo, Spectronic Genesys 10UV, 

USA) and Merck reagents were used in all determinations. The determination of the 

concentration of suspended solids (seston) was performed after filtration of 500 mL 

triplicate samples through Whatman GF/C (47 mm diam.) pre-weighted, pre-combusted 

filters. The filters were dried at 60 °C for 24 h, and the seston content was calculated as 

the difference in weight. Particulate organic matter (POM) was determined by the 

difference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 h incineration at 525 °C (Parsons 

et al., 1984). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50 % of the POM 

(Rodier, 1996). 

 

Preparation of dilution cultures 

An overview of the experimental layout, identifying the conditions that were 

experimentally manipulated, is presented in Fig. 9.1. 

 

Influence of nutrient concentration  

 Dilution cultures were prepared as previously described (Pausz and Herndl, 

2002). Water samples from the SML and UW were pre-filtered and filtered through 0.8-

and 0.4-µm-pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore), respectively, to remove particles 

and most phytoplankton and zooplankton cells. The filtrate containing the &amp;lt;0.4 µ m 

fraction was taken as the inoculum and used in a 1:10 (v/v) proportion to obtain cell 

dilution cultures in artificial mineral solution (AMS, 0.009 M KCl, 0.009 M 

CaCl2· 2H2O, 0.026 M MgSO4· 7H2O, 0.023 M MgCl2· 6H2O, and 0.002 M NaHCO3) 

containing 0.425 M NaCl for marine samples or 0.213 M NaCl for brackish water 

samples. Suspensions were then amended with a mixture of amino acids (L-arginine, L-

histidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-

threonine, L-tryptophan, and L-valine) (0.4 µ M), glucose (100 or 20 µ M), NH4
+ (10 or 2 

µ M) and PO4
3– (1 or 0.2 µ M) at different concentrations to simulate high- and low-

nutrient availability, as previously described (Pausz and Herndl, 2002). Cultures were 

incubated at 25 ºC in the dark for 24 h. Subsequently, the dilution cultures were split in 

aliquots to which PO4
3– (40 or 8 µ M) and NH4

+ (4 or 0.8 µ M) were added at different 

concentrations to establish high nutrient and low nutrient conditions. Nutrient-

unamended samples were prepared as described for nutrient amendments, except that no 

PO4
3– or NH4

+ was added to the dilution cultures. After 12 h, cultures were irradiated as 



Chapter 9 

152 

described below. Bacterial activity and abundance were determined immediately before 

and after irradiation. 

 

Influence of dissolved components of the suspension medium  

 Marine and brackish bacterioneuston (SML) and bacterioplankton (UW) inocula 

(&amp;lt;0.4 µ m filtrates) prepared as described above were diluted (1:10) in 0.2-µ m-pore-size 

filtered water from the SML and UW of the corresponding estuarine site (marine or 

brackish) and incubated at 25 ºC in the dark for 24 h before irradiation. The following 

experimental conditions were tested: (i) bacterioneuston inoculum in SML water, (ii) 

bacterioneuston inoculum in UW water, (iii) bacterioplankton inoculum in SML water, 

and (iv) bacterioplankton inoculum in UW water. Bacterial suspensions were irradiated 

as described below. Bacterial activity and abundance were determined immediately 

before and after irradiation. 

 

Bioassays with bacterial isolates 

To evaluate the interspecies variability of the influence of the suspension 

medium during UVB irradiation, bioassays were conducted with environmental 

bacterial isolates (Micrococcus sp., Paracoccus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and 

Staphylococcus sp.) selected by their differences in terms of UVB sensitivity (Santos et 

al., 2011b). Fresh cultures were prepared in Marine Broth 2216 (Difco, Detroit, MI), 

and cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 ×g for 15 min; Thermo Scientific 

Heraeus Pico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany) in late-exponential phase. The 

pellets were washed three times with filter-sterilized autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and 

resuspended in the same solution, and the bacterial abundance was adjusted to 107 cells 

mL-1. Bacterial suspensions were then diluted (1:10) in AMS or in 0.2-µ m-pore-size 

filtered samples of SML and UW from the marine or brackish water sites. 

 

Irradiation conditions 

Dilution cultures or cell suspensions were transferred to sterile 150 x 25 mm 

plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that the 

depth of the liquid was &amp;lt;2 mm. For irradiation, the lid was removed, and cell 

suspensions were exposed to UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, main emission 

wavelength line of 302 nm) for a total dose of 37 kJ m-2, approximately corresponding 

to UV levels detected in the field at the sampling period. UV intensities were measured 



Chapter 9 

153 

with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, 

Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK). During irradiation, the temperature was 

maintained at 25 ºC. Dark controls (covered in aluminum foil) for every experimental 

condition, treated in the same way as the irradiated samples, were always included. 

Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation to assess 

bacterial abundance and activity. All experiments were conducted in three independent 

assays. 

 

Bacterial abundance 

Bacterial abundance was determined by epifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et 

al., 1977) after fixing triplicate samples from each condition tested with 2 % 

formaldehyde (final concentration). Samples were then filtered through 0.2-µ m-pore-

size black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics Products, Livermore, USA) and stained 

with 0.03 % acridine orange (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan, USA). Cells were 

counted by epifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped 

with a BP 450-490 exciter filter and an LP 515 barrier filter (Leitz Meßtechnik, Wetzlar, 

Germany). At least 200 cells or 20 microscopic fields were counted for each of the three 

replicate measurements for each condition tested.  

 

Bacterial activity 

Bacterial activity was estimated from the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation 

(Smith and Azam, 1992). Triplicate 1.5-mL sample aliquots and a 5 % TCA-fixed 

control were incubated with a mixture of [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences, 

Buckinghamshire, UK; specific activity 160 Ci mmoL?1) and nonradioactive leucine at 

a previously determined saturating concentration of 83 nM and 483 nM for 

environmental samples and suspensions of bacterial isolates, respectively. Samples were 

incubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. Incubations were stopped by the 

addition of TCA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to a final concentration of 5 %; then, the 

samples were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min (Thermo Scientific Heraeus Pico 21 

Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was discarded, and 1.5 mL of 5 

% TCA was added. The mixture was vortexed, centrifuged and the supernatant was 

discarded. The pellet was washed with 90 % ethanol, dried overnight at room 

temperature and resuspended in 1.0 mL Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN 

Biomedicals, USA). The radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was measured 



Chapter 9 

154 

after 3 days in a Beckman LS 6000 IC Liquid Scintillation Counter (Beckman Coulter, 

Inc., USA). 

 

Statistical analysis 

All experiments were repeated in three independent assays, and parameters were 

always determined in triplicate. Differences between treatments were assessed by a one-

way ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL). 

The Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of variances. If variances were not 

homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was applied. If variances were still 

not homogenous, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall 

effect of treatment.

Influence of nutrient amendments on UVB effects on bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton  

For marine bacterioneuston, the effects of UV exposure on bacterial abundance 

and activity after amendment with a low nutrient concentration were not significantly 

different from those observed in AMS (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). The amendment with 

a high nutrient concentration attenuated the UV-induced reduction in abundance and 

activity by 15.6 and 46.7 % (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), respectively, compared to the 

effects in AMS (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.2). For marine bacterioplankton, the effects of 

UV exposure on bacterial abundance and activity after amendment with a low nutrient 



Chapter 9 

156 

concentration were also not significantly different from those observed in AMS. The 

amendment with a high nutrient concentration attenuated the UV-induced reduction in 

bacterial abundance and activity by 34.2 and 54.4 % (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), 

respectively, compared to the effects on AMS (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.2).  

Marine bacterioplankton in AMS suspensions and in low nutrient concentration 

dilution cultures was significantly more affected by irradiation than marine 

bacterioneuston, in terms of both cell abundance (up to 17.8 %) and leucine 

incorporation (up to 21.4 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.3).

For brackish water bacterioneuston, the effects of the different nutrient 

treatments on the variation of bacterial abundance upon UV irradiation were not 

significantly different from those observed in AMS (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). The 

amendment with a low nutrient concentration also did not significantly affect the 

inhibition of bacterial activity during irradiation (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) compared 

to the AMS treatment, while the amendment with a high nutrient concentration 

attenuated the inhibition of bacterial activity by 51.8 % (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.2). For 

brackish bacterioplankton, the amendment with a low nutrient condition did not 

significantly affect the reduction in bacterial abundance and activity during irradiation 

(1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) compared to AMS dilution cultures, while the high nutrient 

treatment attenuated UV effects on bacterial abundance and activity by 7.3 and 50.1 %, 

respectively, compared to the AMS treatment (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.2). 

In AMS suspensions, the effects of irradiation in terms of abundance were 

similar in brackish bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05), 

but bacterial activity was 7.1 % less inhibited in bacterioplankton than in 



Chapter 9 

157 

bacterioneuston (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). Under the low nutrient regime, bacterial 

abundance was 8.2 % less inhibited by UV exposure in bacterioneuston than in 

bacterioplankton (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), while the effects on activity were not 

significantly different between the two communities. In the high nutrient treatment, the 

effects of UV exposure on bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were similar (1-way 

ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 9.2 A, B, Table 9.3).

Influence of dissolved components of the suspension medium 

To test the influence of the suspension medium on UV-induced damage, samples 

of marine and brackish bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were diluted in water from 

the SML and UW of the corresponding origin sites, and their UV sensitivity responses 

were compared to those observed in AMS suspensions. 

For marine bacterioneuston, inoculation in SML water attenuated the UV-

induced reduction in bacterial abundance and activity by 11.8 and 13.2 % (1-way 

ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), respectively, compared to samples in AMS. Inoculation in UW did 

not affect bacterial inactivation but attenuated the reduction of activity during 

irradiation by 7.4 % compared to the AMS treatment. The variation of abundance and 

activity was similar in SML and UW cell suspensions (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2). For 

marine bacterioplankton, significant (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) attenuations in the 

reduction in bacterial abundance (up to 11.1 %) and activity (up to 12.0 %) during 

irradiation were observed upon inoculation in SML and UW compared to AMS (Fig. 

9.3 A, B, Table 9.2).  



Chapter 9 

158 

For brackish bacterioneuston, significant differences in terms of inactivation 

between the different suspension media were not observed. Inoculation in SML 

attenuated the UV-induced reduction in activity by 12.0 % (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) 

compared to AMS dilution cultures, whereas the reduction in activity in samples 

inoculated in UW and AMS was not significantly different (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2). 

For brackish bacterioplankton, inoculation in SML attenuated the UV-induced reduction 

in abundance and activity by 8.4 and 9.6 %, respectively, compared to the AMS 

treatment, whereas inoculation in UW did not significantly affect the reduction in 

abundance and activity compared to the dilutions in AMS (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2).  

In marine and brackish water samples, the inhibition of bacterial abundance and 

activity by UV radiation was generally higher in bacterioplankton than in 

bacterioneuston by up to 19.9 and 15.7 %, respectively (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.3). 

 

Fig. 9.4. Effects of irradiation on different media (AMS – artificial mineral solution, SML – surface microlayer, and UW – 

underlying water) on (A) abundance and (B) activity (expressed as leucine incorporation) in bacterial isolates. Data are presented as 

the group means ± standard deviations of the mean of three experiments. The absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations 

are too small to see on the scale used. 

 

Bioassays with bacterial isolates 

To address the interspecies variability of the effects of the suspension medium 

on UV sensitivity, four bacterial isolates were tested for their photobiological responses 

upon inoculation in AMS and in marine or brackish water of the SML or UW. Dark 

controls were included for all treatments but are not shown in the figures for simplicity 

because these controls were not significantly different (1-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) from 

the dark controls performed in AMS.  

Depending on the isolate, inactivation compared to that observed in AMS ranged 

from 4.0 % less to 7.0 % more in marine SML water, from 3.0 % less to 11.7 % more in 

marine UW, from 23.1 % less to 17.8 % more in brackish SML water and from 5.9 % 



Chapter 9 

159 

less to 6.7 % more in brackish UW (Fig. 9.4 A, see Table 9.4 for statistical 

significance). 

Similar results were observed for leucine incorporation. Compared to the AMS 

treatment, the effects of irradiation in different media on UV-induced inhibition of 

leucine incorporation ranged from a 4.3 % attenuation to a 6.2 % enhancement for 

marine SML, from a 1.2-14.6 % enhancement for marine UW, from a 3.0-23.6 % 

attenuation for brackish SML and from a 2.4 % enhancement to a 17.5 % attenuation for 

brackish UW (Fig. 9.4 B, see Table 9.4 for statistical significances).

Discussion 

The effects of UV exposure on marine microorganisms are influenced by several 

environmental and biological factors. In the present work, we compared the influence of 

the availability of inorganic nutrients and the type of the suspension medium on the UV 

responses of estuarine bacterial communities that are naturally exposed to different 

nutrient and light regimes (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) and that originate 

from different sites within an estuary (marine and brackish water). The variability of the 

effects of the suspension medium on different bacterial isolates was also assessed.  

 

Effects of nutrient concentration 

Inhibition by UV radiation, in terms of abundance and activity, was generally 

attenuated when the suspension medium was amended with high nutrient concentrations 

(40 µ M NH4
+ and 4 µ M PO4

3-). Repair processes elicited in response to UVR require 

nitrogen for synthesis of proteins involved in DNA repair and ROS scavenging and thus 

can potentially be inhibited by a limitation in nitrogen supply (Beardall et al., 2009). 

These repair processes are also energy dependent, requiring ATP, and are consequently 



Chapter 9 

160 

susceptible to limitation in the supply of organic matter and inorganic phosphorus 

(Beardall et al., 2009). Our results indicate that the high nutrient amendments may have 

provided sufficient amounts of the elements required for nucleic acid and protein 

synthesis, including those involved in repair of UV-induced damage, which were likely 

not fulfilled with the low nutrient regime. Such observations are in accordance with 

previous reports of the ability of nutrient inputs to promote recovery from UV-induced 

damage (Joux et al., 2009).  

In general, under the unamended (AMS) and low nutrient conditions, 

bacterioneuston was more resistant to UV inactivation than bacterioplankton. The 

differences in UV sensitivity of the two communities, particularly of those originating 

from the brackish water site, were attenuated upon amendment with high nutrient 

concentrations. Rapidly growing cells are considered to be more sensitive to 

inactivation than slow growing cells due to the shorter time interval required for 

excision repair between subsequent rounds of replication (Harm, 1980; Jagger, 1985). In 

the original samples, bacterioplankton growth rates, estimated from bacterial secondary 

production and bacterial biomass (Hernández et al., 2006), were up to 25 % higher than 

those of bacterioneuston (data not shown). Leucine incorporation is also enhanced at the 

UW, though bacterial abundance is higher in the SML (Lindroos et al., 2011; Santos et 

al., 2012b). The higher growth rates of bacterioplankton could be a contributing factor 

for its higher susceptibility to UVR observed in the present work and previous reports 

(Santos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2012b). Low bacterial growth rates at the SML have 

been reported by other authors and attributed to the low lability of dissolved organic 

compounds (e.g., free amino acids) accumulating in this layer (Reinthaler et al., 2008). 

Taken together, these observations may suggest that bacterial cells at the SML are 

intrinsically adapted to nutritional stress and thus are less affected in their UV 

sensitivity by variations in nutrient concentrations. This finding is in agreement with our 

previous observations of the enhanced ability of starved bacterioneuston isolates to 

recover from UV-induced damage compared to bacterioplankton isolates in the same 

nutritional conditions (Santos et al., 2012a). 

Differences in the community composition of bacterial assemblages from the 

SML and UW at the oligotrophic and mesotrophic estuarine sites may also account for 

the differences in the observed responses. Marine and brackish water bacterial 

communities from Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) are physiologically (Almeida et al., 2001) 

and structurally (Henriques et al., 2006a) distinct. Bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton 



Chapter 9 

161 

community structure in this estuary also seems to differ, as suggested by the occurrence 

of SML-specific bacterial members affiliated with Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, 

Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Azevedo et al., 2012), as well as the 

dominance of the UV-resistant Gammaproteobacteria in bacterioneuston (Santos et al., 

2012b). 

 

Influence of dissolved components of the suspension medium 

The influence of dissolved components of the suspension media on the UV-

induced effects on bacterial communities was tested by inoculating bacterial 

assemblages in cell-free water from the SML or UW. The effects of irradiation on 

bacterial numbers and activity were monitored and compared to those observed in an 

artificial medium (AMS). For marine communities of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton, suspension in SML and UW attenuated the inhibitory effects of UV 

radiation. In brackish water bacterial communities, the UV-induced effects on 

abundance and activity were generally attenuated upon suspension in SML water.  

Attenuation of the inhibitory effects of UV exposure in bacterial communities 

irradiated in SML and/or UW compared to the AMS treatment may be due to 

stimulation of bacterial metabolism by low molecular weight compounds resulting from 

the photolytic cleavage of DOM present in environmental samples (Amador et al., 1989; 

Bushaw et al., 1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; 

Obernosterer et al., 1999), thus compensating for the direct negative effects of 

irradiation. Furthermore, natural environmental samples could have provided the cells 

with nutrients necessary for the synthesis of repair proteins (Beardall et al., 2009), 

allowing them to cope with the effects of irradiation better than those maintained in 

AMS. Finally, a shield and quenching effect of DOC and humic materials present in the 

environmental samples (Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005) may have also 

mitigated the inhibitory effects of irradiation in samples diluted in SML and/or UW, 

compared to samples in AMS. Together, these results demonstrate that the medium in 

which bacteria are suspended influences the effects of UV radiation and also suggest the 

importance of the SML and UW abiotic environments in determining the UV responses 

of the corresponding bacterial communities.  

Additionally, to gain further insights into the influence of the irradiating medium 

on UVR sensitivity, bioassays were also conducted with individual isolated strains. 

Bacterial isolates were inoculated in different suspension media, and variations of 



Chapter 9 

162 

abundance and activity with irradiation were determined. The responses of the different 

isolates to the tested treatments were widely variable, either protecting or accentuating 

the inhibitory effects of UVB, depending on the suspension medium and the isolate. 

However, in general, brackish SML water attenuated the inhibitory effects of UVR on 

cell activity. The protective effect of inoculation in brackish water may have resulted 

from a shield effect of organic matter and humic compounds concentrated in these 

samples and/or from the enhanced production of low molecular weight compounds from 

the phototransformation of DOM that was used for bacterial growth (Amador et al., 

1989; Bushaw et al., 1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; 

Obernosterer et al., 1999; Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005).  

The variability in the effects of the suspension media in UV-induced inactivation 

and inhibition of activity observed in the different isolates may be attributed to 

interspecies differences in protection and repair mechanisms (Fernández Zenoff et al., 

2006b; Santos et al., 2011b). Alternatively, differences in the ability to use the products 

of phototransformation of DOM for bacterial growth can also contribute to the variable 

effects that each suspension medium exerted on the different bacterial isolates. For 

example, Gammaproteobacteria are negatively affected by the photochemical alteration 

of cDOM or outcompeted by the other bacterial groups during phototransformation 

experiments (Piccini et al., 2009), and Actinobacteria are favoured under those 

circumstances (Pérez and Sommaruga, 2007). 

These results indicate that the suspension medium in which bacteria are 

irradiated is important for determining the biological consequences of UV exposure, 

which likely depend on the compromise between the protective effects of organic 

matter, the stimulatory effects of UV radiation mediated by the photolysis of organic 

matter and the oxidative stress imposed by ROS generated during the process.  

 

Conclusions 

The availability of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the overall 

composition of the medium in which cell suspensions for irradiation experiments were 

prepared, influenced the UV effects on bacterial abundance and activity. Nutrient 

amendment attenuated the inhibitory effects of UV exposure. Attenuation of the 

inhibitory effects of irradiation was also observed when cells were suspended in water 

from the SML and/or UW, compared to AMS. This effect likely occurs as a 

consequence of photoreactions resulting in the formation of low molecular weight 



Chapter 9 

163 

compounds that promote bacterial growth or a shield effect by humic material present in 

natural samples that compensates for the detrimental effects of UVR. These results 

demonstrate that the role of UVR as an environmental regulator of the abundance and 

activity of aquatic bacteria is modulated by interactions with abiotic water properties 

and can vary significantly in different aquatic niches.

Abstract 

The dose-dependent variation of oxidative cellular damage imposed by UVB 

exposure in a representative estuarine bacterial strain, Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B, was 

studied at different growth phases (mid-exponential, late-exponential, and stationary), 

growth temperatures (15 ºC and 25 ºC) and growth media (nutrient-rich Tryptic Soy 

Broth [TSB] and nutrient-poor M9). Survival and markers of oxidative damage (lipid 

peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA strand breakage, and DNA-protein cross-

links) were monitored during exposure to increasing UVB doses (0-60 kJ m-2).  

Oxidative damage did not follow a clear linear dose-dependent pattern, 

particularly at medium-high UVB doses (&gt; 10 kJ m-2), suggesting a dynamic interaction 

between damage induction and repair during irradiation and/or saturation of oxidative 

damage. Survival of stationary phase cells generally exceeded that of exponential phase 

cells by up to 33.5 times; the latter displayed enhanced levels of DNA-protein cross-

links (up to 15.6-fold) and protein carbonylation (up to 6.0-fold). Survival of mid-

exponential phase cells was generally higher at 15 ºC than at 25 ºC (up to 6.6-fold), 

which was accompanied by lower levels of DNA strand breaks (up to 4,000-fold), 

suggesting a temperature effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and/or 

ROS interaction with cellular targets. Survival under medium-high UVB doses (&gt; 10 kJ 

m-2) was generally higher (up to 5.4-fold) in cells grown in TSB than in M9.  

These results highlight the importance of growth conditions preceding 

irradiation on the extent of oxidative damage induced by UVB exposure in bacteria.

Introduction 

Bacteria are highly susceptible to solar radiation, particularly in the UV range, 

due to their small size, short generation time, and the fact that their genetic material 

comprises a significant portion of their cellular volume (Garcia-Pichel, 1994).  

The main biological effects of UVB radiation (280-320 nm) have traditionally 

been attributed to its ability to induce direct DNA damage (DNA photoproducts), most 

notably cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts 

(Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). However, the observation of the accumulation of similar 

levels of DNA photoproducts in bacteria with distinct UV sensitivities (Joux et al., 

1999; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008) and the fact that DNA damage alone cannot 

account for the inhibitory effects of UV radiation on bacteria inhabiting surface waters 

(Visser et al., 2002) suggest that UV-induced damage to other biomolecules, 

particularly lipids and proteins, may play a role in the inhibitory effects of UV radiation 

on bacteria. 

The action spectrum for UV effects does not correlate with the absorption 

spectrum of lipids. Therefore, UV-induced damage to lipids is likely to be a result of 

indirect oxidative damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Girotti, 2001). 

Proteins are also key targets of photosensitized damage, which may cause functional 

changes in structural and enzymatic proteins (Bosshard et al., 2010b). Proteins that 

contain iron as a prosthetic metal are particularly noteworthy targets of oxidation 

through the Fenton reaction, being readily oxidizable by hydrogen peroxide (Beyer and 

Fridovich, 1991; Tamarit et al., 1998; Murakami et al., 2006). Besides direct damage, 

DNA can also be damaged by ROS generated during photosensitized reactions, 

resulting in the formation of strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and DNA-protein cross-

links (Mitchell, 1995).  

The importance of oxidative damage in UVB-induced bacterial inactivation has 

recently been highlight in studies directly quantifying oxidative stress markers during 

irradiation in a set of estuarine bacterial isolates (Santos et al., 2013), as well as studies 

reporting enhanced levels of transcripts and proteins involved in the response to 

oxidative stress upon UVB exposure in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and 

Photobacterium angustum S14 (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). 

Contrary to DNA dimers, which can be effectively reversed by photoreactivation, 

oxidative damage resulting from ROS overproduction upon UVB exposure is more 

difficult and energetically expensive to repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). These 



Chapter 10 

167 

observations make the study of UVB-induced oxidative damage in bacteria, and the 

factors that influence it, of utmost importance. 

It is well known that the biological response of microorganisms to UV radiation 

is influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Among extrinsic or 

environmental factors, temperature, nutrient concentration, and light availability have 

all been shown to affect the biological responses of microorganisms to UV radiation by 

affecting light penetration and/or the physiological condition of cells, with variable 

results (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010; Matallana-Surget et al., 

2010). For example, the effects of increased temperature on UV sensitivity have been 

reported to be non-significant in Escherichia coli (Gayán et al., 2011), protective in 

bacterioplankton (Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010), and detrimental in Sphingopyxis 

alaskensis (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010).  

Intrinsic properties of microorganisms also influence the biological 

consequences of UV exposure. For example, cell size, by affecting the pathway of light 

penetration, seems to contribute to the vulnerability for DNA damage accumulation in 

planktonic organisms, with smaller cells displaying higher levels of DNA damage 

(Karentz et al., 1991; Garcia-Pichel, 1994; Buma et al., 2001). Cell-specific growth rate 

is also a key determinant of the effects of UVA (Berney et al., 2006c) and UVC 

exposure in E. coli (Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). UVA effects have also been found to 

depend on the growth phase, with stationary phase cells recovering faster and being 

more resistant to the lethal effects of irradiation than exponential growing cells (Dantur 

and Pizarro, 2004). Other authors have reported that, at least in S. alaskensis, the growth 

phase does not affect total DNA photoproduct formation during exposure to simulated 

solar radiation (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). However, to our knowledge, studies on 

the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic properties on UVB-induced oxidative damage in 

bacteria are virtually nonexistent. 

The present work aimed to study the influence of the growth conditions of cells 

(growth phase, growth temperature and growth medium) and light dose on UVB-

induced oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins in bacteria. 

 

Materials and methods 

Bacterial strain and growth conditions 

The bacterial strain used in this study (Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, NCBI 

accession number GU084169) was isolated from the surface waters of the estuarine 



Chapter 10 

168 

system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) (Santos et al., 2011b). This strain shows a 98 % 16S 

rRNA gene similarity with the hexazinone-degrading Pseudomonas kuykendallii strain 

H2A and a 97 % 16S rRNA gene similarity with Pseudomonas putida strain DAPG5. 

Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B shows a minimal growth temperature of 9±1 ºC and a 

maximal growth temperature of 37±1 ºC. The optimal growth temperature of the strain 

is 27±1 ºC (data not shown). A Gammaproteobacteria strain was selected because this 

lineage seems to dominate UV-exposed surface waters and has been proposed to be 

UV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). 

Furthermore, Pseudomonas strains seem to be particularly enriched in the sunlit surface 

microlayer of the Ria de Aveiro estuary which could suggest enhanced resistance of the 

genera to environmental stress factors at the estuarine water surface, particularly 

enhanced UV levels (Azevedo et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012b). Finally, the resistance 

and repair mechanisms of the Pseudomonas genus have been well studied (Kokjohn and 

Miller, 1985; Simonson et al., 1990; Kokjohn and Miller, 1994; Kidambi et al., 1996).  

The strain was grown in either nutrient-rich Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Difco 

Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) or nutrient-poor M9 medium (22 mM KH2PO4, 42 mM 

Na2HPO4, 19 mM NH4Cl, 9 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.09 mM CaCl2 , pH 6.8, 

containing 5.5 mM glucose as a carbon source) adjusted to 36 PSU (Practical Salinity 

Units) at 15 ºC or 25 ºC with agitation (120 rpm). The temperatures 15 ºC or 25 ºC were 

chosen because they represent the approximate maximum and minimum temperatures 

detected in the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro throughout the year (Santos et al., 

2011c). Aliquots were collected at pre-determined intervals and the absorbance at 600 

nm (OD600) was measured in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer 

(Thermo Fisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain) and used to construct the respective 

growth curves. Cells in the mid-exponential phase, late-exponential phase and stationary 

phase grown in the different media and at different temperatures were used for 

subsequent irradiation experiments. These growth phases were chosen because they 

correspond to the growth phases that have most commonly been used in studies of UV 

effects on bacteria (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2004; Agogué et al., 

2005; Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b; Hörtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos 

et al., 2012a).

169 

Total bacterial number (TBN) and cell biovolume 

Cells in the different growth conditions were characterized in terms of total 

bacterial number (TBN) and biovolume. For the determination of TBN, samples were 

filtered through 0.2-µ m-pore-size black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics, Livermore, 

CA, USA), and stained with 0.03 % (w/v) acridine orange (Hobbie et al., 1977). Cells 

were counted by epifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope 

(Leitz Me?technik, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. At 

least 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate 

membranes per sample. 

Cell biovolume was determined on acridine orange-stained preparations by 

epifluorescence microscopy by using an ocular grid with black and transparent circles. 

For cell volume calculations, bacteria were assumed to represent cylinders with 

hemispherical ends (Jürgens and Jeppesen, 2000).  

 

Irradiation conditions 

Cells in the different growth conditions were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 

x g for 15 min, Thermo Scientific Heraeus Pico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, 

Germany), washed and resuspended in 0.2-µ m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl 

solution and bacterial abundance was adjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to 

106 cells mL-1.  

Cell suspensions (30 mL, corresponding, on average, to a biomass of 

approximately 1 mg mL-1 of protein) were transferred to sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 

mm; Corning) and irradiated (without the lid) under UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, 

main emission line of 302 nm). Suspensions were stirred during irradiation using a 

magnetic stirrer. UV sources were placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities were 

measured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer (DM 300, Bentham Instruments, 

Reading, UK) placed at the sample level. The UV intensity during irradiations 

corresponded to 2.3 W m-2. The UV dose (in J m-2) was calculated by multiplying the 

intensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). A cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2 was 

applied. Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected at pre-determined doses (0, 2, 4, 6, 

8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kJ m-2) to construct the inactivation curves and for oxidative 

stress marker analysis and immediately reserved at 4 ºC in order to avoid cell recovery. 

During irradiation, temperatures were kept at 15 ºC or 25 ºC, depending on the growth 

temperature of the treatment being considered. Cell homogenates for protein content 



Chapter 10 

170 

and protein carbonyl levels analysis were prepared by collecting cells by centrifugation 

immediately after irradiation, resuspending them in cold 50 mM potassium phosphate 

buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EDTA, followed by sonication in ice (Branson 

Instruments Co. Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, 30-s pulses, 1-min cooling). 

Homogenates were stored at -80 ºC until the measurements. Positive (H2O2-treated) and 

negative (untreated) controls were always included and processed along experimental 

samples in order to ensure proper functioning of the procedures. All experiments were 

repeated in three independent assays and biochemical and microbiological analysis were 

always conducted in triplicate. All the procedures were conducted under low-luminosity 

conditions to minimize photoreactivation. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-

Aldrich (St Louis, MO), unless otherwise specified. 

 

Colony formation assay 

Control and irradiated sample aliquots collected at different UVB doses were 

serially-diluted in filter-sterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and spread-plated in triplicate 

in the solid medium corresponding to the one used to prepare cell suspensions (i.e., 

either Tryptic Soy Agar or agarized M9 medium). After 3 days of incubation in the dark 

at 15 ºC or 25 ºC, depending on the treatment, colonies were counted. Survival was 

calculated from the ratio between the number of colony forming units (CFU) after 

irradiation and at time zero.  

 

DNA strand breakage 

DNA strand breaks (DSB) were quantified using a modified version of the 

FADU (Fluorimetric Analysis of DNA Unwinding) method, as previously described 

(He and Häder, 2002). The procedure requires two sets of untreated control samples, 

besides test samples (so-called P-samples): samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding 

(T-samples) and samples subjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). 

Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 x g, 15 min) and treated with 

lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final concentration) and proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final 

concentration). A volume of 300 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was then added to the three sets of 

samples: (1) T-samples were immediately neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl, 

followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature and sonication for 15 s; (2) B-

samples were sonicated for 2 min, neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl after a 30-min 



Chapter 10 

171 

incubation, and sonicated again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, 

neutralized with 300 µL of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. 

A final concentration of 5 µ M of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) 

was added to all samples. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for 

fluorescence measurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer 

(Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Data were expressed as the strand 

scission factor (SSF), defined as SSF = -ln(Ft/F0), where Ft is the fluorescence of the 

treated sample at time t and F0 is the fluorescence of the sample at time 0 (Baumstark-

Khan and Horneck, 2007).  

 

DNA-protein cross-links 

DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) were determined as previously described 

(Nguyen et al., 2000). Briefly, control and irradiated samples were treated with 1 % 

SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 1 M NaCl. After vigorous vortexing, two volumes of 

chloroform:isopentyl alcohol (24:1) were added and the mixture was vortexed again. 

After centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 15 min, the absorbance at 260 nm of the aqueous 

phase was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain). The fraction of DNA-protein cross-linking 

was determined according to the equation: 

Fraction cross-linked = (A0 - At)/A0 

where A0 is the absorbance of sample at time 0 and At is the absorbance of the treated 

samples at time t. 

 

Lipid peroxidation 

Lipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive 

substances (TBARS), as previously described (Pérez et al., 2007). Control and 

irradiated cells were centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium 

phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A final concentration of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene 

and 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was added to prevent further lipid 

oxidation. After sonication and centrifugation, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 

mL of 20 % trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min. The 

supernatant was removed and mixed with 1 mL of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid in 0.1 

M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene in a new tube. After heating at 100 ºC for 

1 h, 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled at room temperature and then mixed with 1.5 



Chapter 10 

172 

mL of butanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the absorbance at 535 nm of the 

organic fraction was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer 

(Thermo Fisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain). TBARS content was determined 

using an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1cm-1. Results were expressed per mg of 

protein. 

 

Protein oxidation  

The carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined as previously 

described (Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of homogenates were mixed with 10 mM 

dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was omitted in the blanks. After 

incubation at room temperature for 1 hour, proteins were precipitated with 500 µ L of 20 

% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min), and the pellet 

was washed three times with 1 mL of 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final 

precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance at 

360 nm was determined, using guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 

mM potassium phosphate) as a blank. A molar absorption coefficient of 22 mM-1cm-1 

was used to quantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Results were expressed per mg of 

protein. 

 

Protein concentration 

Protein concentration in cell homogenates was determined by the Bradford 

method using BSA as a standard (Bradford, 1976).  

 

Statistical analysis 

Prior to statistical analysis, data normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test. Differences between treatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using 

the statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of 

variances. If variances were not homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was 

applied. If variances were still not homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test 

was used to assess the overall effect of the treatment (Sokal and Rolf, 1995).

Results 

Initial characterization of cell suspensions 

The growth curve of Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B under different 

conditions is presented in Fig. 10.1. Table 10.1 summarizes the characteristics of the 

cell suspensions used in the subsequent irradiation assays. Mid-exponential phase, late-

exponential phase and stationary phase were achieved in 4-12 h, 6-14 h and 12-18 h, 

respectively. Total bacterial abundance, determined by epifluorescence microscopy, 

ranged between 5.2 x 107 and 1.4 x 109 cells mL-1 in mid-exponential phase, between 

6.4 x 107 and 1.8 x 109 cells mL-1 in late-exponential phase and 6.6 x 107 and 2.0 x 109 

cells mL-1 in the stationary phase. These results were consistent with CFU 

determinations (data not shown), suggesting that cells remained culturable under all 

growth conditions tested. Cell biovolume varied between 0.192-0.360 µ m3 in the mid-

exponential phase, 0.390-0.740 µ m3 in the late-exponential phase and 0.529-1.266 µ m3 

in the stationary phase.

Influence of light dose 

UVB inactivation curves of Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B under the 

different growth conditions are shown in Fig. 10.2. Dark controls were always 

performed for every growth condition tested and did not vary significantly (1-way 

ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) throughout the duration of the corresponding irradiation period. 

Therefore, only a representative dark control is shown in Fig. 10.2. The survival of 

Pseudomonas sp. in the mid-exponential phase grown in different media and at different 

temperatures followed a general dose-dependent variation. The percentage of cell 

survival at 60 kJ m-2 ranged between 1.8 and 11.7 % (Fig. 10.2 A). Late-exponential 

phase cells grown in TSB at 15 ºC and in M9 at 25 ºC showed a linear decrease in cell 

survival up to a cumulative dose of 10 kJ m-2, after which cell survival stabilized. Cells 

grown in M9 at 15 ºC displayed a linear decrease in survival up to a cumulative dose of 

40 kJ m-2 and stabilized thereafter. For cells grown in TSB at 25 ºC, survival decreased 

progressively up to the end of the irradiation period. The percentage of cell survival at 

60 kJ m-2 varied between 18.4 and 52.2 % (Fig. 10.2 B).

mean of three experiments. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. 

 

Stationary phase cells grown in M9 at 15 ºC showed a progressive decrease in 

cell survival up to a cumulative dose of 50 kJ m-2. The survival of cells grown in TSB at

15 ºC decreased steadily up to a cumulative dose of 30 kJ m-2 and stabilized afterwards. 

The survival of cells grown at 25 ºC in M9 and TSB varied in a dose-dependent pattern 

up to a cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2. Cell survival at 60 kJ m-2 ranged between 24.6 and 

59.1 % (Fig. 10.2 C). 

In late-exponential and stationary phase cells, TBARS levels varied in a dose-

dependent pattern up to a cumulative UVB dose of 10 kJ m-2. In general, TBARS levels 

peaked at 19.4-52.5 pmol/ mg of protein upon exposure to low UVB doses (2-10 kJ m-

2), showing different trends of variation in the period thereafter (Fig. 10.3 A-C).

of the mean of three experiments. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. 

 

DNA strand breaks, expressed as SSF (strand scission factor), increased in a 

general dose-dependent fashion up to 10 kJ m-2 in all treatments. In mid-exponential 

phase cells, SSF peaked at 0.2-0.8 after 40 kJ m-2, varying thereafter (Fig. 10.4 A). SSF 

in late-exponential and stationary phase cells oscillated strongly at UVB doses over 10 

kJ m-2, peaking at 0.3-0.8 between 30-60 kJ m-2 (Fig. 10.4 B, 10.4 C). 

The levels of DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) also showed a general dose-

dependent variation up to 10 kJ m-2 of UVB. For mid-exponential phase cells, DPC 

levels peaked at 0.3 after 10 kJ m-2 for cells grown in TSB at 15 ºC, and at 0.3-0.5 after 

a cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2 for the remaining treatments (Fig. 10.5 A). For late-

exponential phase cells, DPC levels peaked at 0.2-0.3 after exposure to 10 kJ m-2 and 50 



Chapter 10 

176 

kJ m-2 for cells grown in M9 and TSB, respectively (Fig. 10.5 B). Stationary phase cells 

showed maximum levels of DPC (0.1-0.4) after exposure to 10 kJ m-2 of UVB (Fig. 

10.5 C). 

With the exception of cells grown in TSB at 25 ºC, carbonyl levels in mid-

exponential phase cells peaked (22.0-48.5 µ mol/mg of protein) after exposure to 8 kJ m-

2, strongly decreasing afterwards and tendentially increasing again towards the end of 

the irradiation period (Fig. 10.6 A). In late-exponential phase and stationary phase cells, 

carbonyl levels generally peaked at 16.5-67.0 µ mol/mg of protein at 50-60 kJ m-2 of 

UVB (Fig. 10.6 B, 10.6 C).

are too small to see on the scale used. 

 

Influence of growth phase 

Survival was generally enhanced in late-exponential and stationary phase cells 

compared to mid-exponential phase cells, by up to 33.5-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) 

(Fig. 10.2). At medium-high UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2), TBARS levels were generally 

enhanced in late-exponential and stationary phase cells, compared to mid-exponential 

phase cells, by as much as 6.8-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.3). Regarding 

DSB levels, consistent significant differences between growth phases could not be 

detected (Fig. 10.4). DPC levels were generally higher in exponential phase cells than in

stationary phase cells by up to 15.6 times (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.5). 

Carbonyl levels showed the same trend, being up to 6-fold higher in exponential phase 

cells than in stationary phase cells (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6).

means ± standard deviations of the mean of three experiments. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small 

to see on the scale used. 

 

Influence of growth temperature 

Mid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 ºC generally survived up to 6.6-fold 

better than cells grown at 25 ºC, particularly at low-medium UVB doses (? 30 kJ m-2) 

(1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.2 A). Survival of late-exponential and stationary 

phase cells grown at 25 ºC in TSB and M9 was generally enhanced compared to cells 

grown at 15 ºC, by as much as 4.0-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.2 B, 10.2 

C).  

The levels of TBARS of mid-exponential phase cells grown in TSB and M9 at 

25 ºC were up to 6.0 times higher than those of cells grown at 15 ºC (1-way ANOVA, p 

&amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.3 A). This temperature trend was inverted in stationary phase cells (Fig. 

10.3 C). For late-exponential phase cells, TBARS levels were either enhanced at 15 ºC 

or 25 ºC, depending on the medium (Fig. 10.3 B). 



Chapter 10 

178 

In all growth phases and growth media tested, the DNA strand scission factor 

(SSF) was enhanced in cells grown at 25 ºC compared to cells grown at 15 ºC, by up to 

4,000-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.4 A-C). 

The levels of DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) in mid-exponential and stationary 

phase cells grown in M9 medium were up to 14.0-fold higher in cells grown at 15 ºC 

than at 25 ºC (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.5 A, 10.5 C). The inverse pattern was 

observed in late-exponential phase cells (Fig. 10.5 B). Mid-exponential phase cells 

grown in TSB at 25 ºC showed 2.7 times more DPC levels than cells grown at 15 ºC 

(Fig. 10.5 A). The opposite trend was observed in late-exponential phase cells (Fig. 10.5 

B). For stationary phase cells, DPC levels were 1.8-fold enhanced in cells grown at 25 

ºC for low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2) (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), being this trend 

inverted at higher UVB doses (Fig. 10.5 C). 

Mid-exponential phase cells grown at 25 ºC showed up to 4.4 times more levels 

of carbonyls than cells grown at 15 ºC (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6 A). In late-

exponential and stationary phase cells, carbonyls levels were enhanced by up to 2-fold 

at 15 ºC or 25 ºC, for cells grown in M9 or TSB, respectively (Fig. 10.6 B, 10.6 C).

Influence of growth medium 

 For mid- and late-exponential phase cells grown at 15 ºC, survival at low UVB 

doses (? 20 kJ m-2) was generally enhanced when cells were cultivated in M9 than in 

TSB by as much as 2.5-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). At higher UVB doses, this 

trend was inverted, with cells grown in TSB surviving up to 5.4 times better than those 

grown in M9. For cells grown at 25 ºC, survival was generally higher in TSB than in 

M9 by as much as 2.2-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.2 A, 10.2 B). In 

stationary phase cells, survival was either enhanced in TSB (by up to 1.8-fold) or not 

significantly different between growth media (Fig. 10.2 C). 

For cells grown at 15 ºC in the mid-exponential phase, TBARS levels were up to 

19.6 times higher in M9 than in TSB (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.3 A). For cells 

in the late-exponential and stationary phases, TBARS were either enhanced in M9 or 

TSB depending on the growth temperature (Fig. 10.3 B, 10.3 C). 

Mid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 ºC in M9 showed up to 3 times more 

levels of DSB than when grown in TSB (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.4 A). In the 

remaining treatments, DSB levels were generally enhanced when cells were grown in 

TSB, by up to 16.8-fold, particularly for medium-high UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2) (1-way 

ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.4 A-C). DPC levels were either enhanced in M9 or TSB 

depending on the growth temperature and growth phase (Fig. 10.5). 

In mid-exponential phase cells, at low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2) carbonyl levels 

were enhanced in M9, by up to 7-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6 A). In late-

exponential and stationary phase cells, carbonyls levels were generally enhanced in 

TSB, particularly at medium-high UVB doses (&gt; 10 kJ m-2), by as much as 5.3 fold (1-

way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6 B, 10.6 C). 

 

Discussion 

Oxidative damage is an important component of the mechanism of action of 

UVB radiation in bacteria, as denoted by the rapid induction of oxidative stress defences 

following irradiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Matallana-

Surget et al., 2012). The present work investigated the influence of the light dose and 

growth conditions (growth phase, growth temperature, and growth medium) on the 

oxidative damage elicited by exposure to UVB radiation in a bacterial isolate 

representative of Gammaproteobacteria, which have been found to dominate sunlit 

surface waters and proposed to be UV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-Sáez et 



Chapter 10 

180 

al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). The Pseudomonas strain used in the present study is 

affiliated with P. putida, which accumulates only low levels of DNA damage following 

UVB exposure and shows low repair capabilities (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006b). 

Certain P. putida members also contain a plasmid (pWW0), which encodes an error-

prone DNA polymerase involved in mutagenic DNA repair, that confers evolutionary 

fitness to plasmid-carrying strains upon exposure to UV radiation (Tark et al., 2005). 

 

UVB dose-dependence of cellular damage 

The markers of cellular damage used in the present study (lipid oxidation, 

protein carbonylation, and DNA damage) varied in a general dose-dependent manner 

for low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2). Frequently, maximum levels of oxidative stress 

markers were observed in this period, particularly in mid-exponential phase cells. For 

higher UVB doses, the levels of oxidative stress markers either stabilized or oscillated, 

suggesting that oxidative damage is eventually compensated by the appropriate repair 

mechanisms. The alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) protein plays an important role 

in the reduction of organic hydroperoxides and in the defence against sulphur-

containing radicals (Poole, 2005), and has been proposed to be involved in the 

protection against lipid peroxidation (Mishra et al., 2009). Enhanced levels of the AhpC 

protein have been shown in UVB-irradiated Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-

Surget et al., 2012). Since protein carbonylation is an irreversible process, variation in 

the levels of protein carbonyls during the course of irradiation may reflect enhanced 

activity of proteases involved in the degradation of carbonylated proteins, including 

DnaK, GroEL, and Clp (Fredriksson et al., 2005). Accordingly, the abundance of these 

proteins has been shown to increase in response to UV exposure (Matallana-Surget et 

al., 2009a).  

Alternatively, there can be a saturation of oxidative damage in the cell, 

potentially associated with the formation of multiple lesions as a result of consecutive 

molecule excitation by high UV doses, resulting in a complex, non-linear dependence of 

oxidative damage on the irradiation dose (Byeong et al., 2007). Further studies, 

potentially using more powerful and sensitive techniques (e.g., mass spectrometry-based 

assessment of quantitative and qualitative changes in proteins and lipids during 

irradiation) are necessary to elucidate the lack of a dose-dependence in oxidative stress 

markers at high UVB doses. 

 



Chapter 10 

181 

Influence of growth phase 

In general, survival upon UVB exposure was highest in stationary phase cells. 

Enhanced survival of stationary phase cells was also associated with lower levels of 

DNA-protein cross-links and protein carbonyls, compared to exponential phase cells. 

Several studies have suggested that cells with reduced specific growth rates, such as 

stationary phase cells, are more resistant than exponential phase cells to multiple 

stresses, including extremes of temperature and osmolarity, oxidative stress, UV and 

gamma irradiation, iron and copper toxicity, as well as acid and base shock (Nair and 

Finkel, 2004). Enhanced survival during the stationary phase has been attributed to the 

expression of different biosynthetic pathways, gene regulators, and enzyme systems that 

confer an adaptive advantage to cells in the stationary phase (Rees, 1995; Dodd et al., 

1997). The alternative sigma factor RpoS or ?38 encoded by the rpoS gene, plays a 

critical role in stress resistance of stationary phase cells by regulating the expression of 

antioxidant enzymes, particularly catalase (Hengge-Aronis, 1999; Oppezzo et al., 2011).  

Mid-exponential phase cells were the least resistant to irradiation, displaying 

high levels of protein carbonyls, especially at low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2). An 

intrinsically weaker oxidative stress defence stock (Eisenstark et al., 1996) coupled with 

enhanced ROS production associated with high aerobic respiration rates of mid-

exponential phase cells (Nyström, 2004) and small size (Garcia-Pichel, 1994), 

potentially contributed to the high sensitivity of mid-exponential phase cells to UVB 

radiation. 

 

Influence of growth temperature 

Mid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 ºC showed greater survival after UVB 

exposure than cells grown at 25 ºC, particularly at low UVB doses. The levels of DNA 

strand breaks were higher in cells grown at 25º C than at 15 ºC in all treatments, which 

was also accompanied by enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation in mid-exponential 

phase cells. These results are consistent with previous studies documenting a higher 

yield of UV-induced DNA damage at higher temperature (24 °C versus 12 °C) in 

Sphingopyxis alaskensis (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010), thus suggesting that the 

formation of DNA lesions during UV exposure is temperature-dependent. The 

temperature dependence of DNA damage has been attributed to a possible influence of 

temperature on the conformational state of DNA (Li et al., 2002) and/or an indirect 

effect on DNA by affecting DNA-binding proteins (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010).  



Chapter 10 

182 

The reactions involved in the interaction of ROS and their targets might also be 

temperature-dependent (Li et al., 2002). The electron transport chain is a key source of 

ROS in the cell (Imlay and Fridovich, 1991; González-Flecha and Demple, 1995). 

Lower temperatures could have reduced oxygen consumption rates, particularly in the 

highly active mid-exponential phase cells, which in turn reduced the rates of normal 

ROS production and the risk of oxidative damage. On the other hand, low temperature 

can also modify the metabolic status of the cell, increasing the efficiency of damage 

repair and/or production of antioxidants (Borgeraas and Hessen, 2000).  

However, in stationary phase cells, particularly at high UVB doses, the trend 

observed for mid-exponential phase cells was inverted, with cells grown at 25 ºC 

surviving better and showing lower levels of oxidative stress markers. One possibility to 

account for this observation is that in stationary phase cells, in which there is a lower 

oxidative burden associated with respiration (Nyström, 2004), enhanced temperature 

might stimulate the enzymatic processes involved in defence against UV-induced 

lesions (e.g., the activity of antioxidant enzymes) (Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010). 

Additionally, enhanced cell size, by providing higher internal self-shading (Garcia-

Pichel, 1994) could have also contributed for enhanced survival during UVB exposure.  

 

Influence of the growth medium 

Cells cultivated in nutrient-rich TSB generally survived better to medium-high 

UVB doses (&gt; 10 kJ m-2) than those grown in nutrient-poor M9 medium. These results 

are consistent with the enhanced sensitivity of a set of bacterial isolates exposed to 60 

kJ m-2 of UVB radiation under nutrient depleted conditions, compared to nourished 

counterparts (Santos et al., 2012a). Nutrient-rich TSB, but not M9, could possibly have 

provided sufficient amounts of the chemical elements required for the synthesis of 

macromolecules necessary to withstand high UVB doses (e.g., enzymes involved in 

DNA repair and ROS scavenging), thus accounting for the enhanced UVB resistance of 

cells grown in TSB. Accordingly, supply with high nutrient concentrations (nitrogen 

and phosphorus) has been found to result in reduced UV-sensitivity and enhanced repair 

capabilities in bacterioplankton, compared to the amendment with lower nutrient 

concentrations (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Joux et al., 2009).  

However, it is possible that the higher rates of macromolecule synthesis in cells 

grown in TSB could carry an increased risk of oxidative damage to the cells, as 

indicated by the generally enhanced levels of oxidative stress markers during irradiation 



Chapter 10 

183 

in cells grown in nutrient-rich media, compared to cells grown in M9. It is known that 

the composition of the growth medium affects the lipid composition of the bacterial cell, 

and this can in turn affect susceptibility to oxidative stress. For instance, supplementing 

the bacterial growth medium with free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is known to 

result in enhanced incorporation of a given PUFA into bacterial fatty acids (Kankaanpää 

et al., 2004) which are the main targets of peroxidation (Imlay, 2003). Further studies 

are necessary to elucidate the role of the growth medium in bacterial cell composition 

and in the subsequent sensitivity to UVB-induced stress. 

 

Importance of growth conditions for UVB-induced damage 

 Most studies reporting UVB effects on bacterial isolates have typically 

considered cells in the mid-exponential and late-exponential phase (Joux et al., 1999; 

Arrieta et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2004; Agogué et al., 2005; Fernández Zenoff et al., 

2006b; Hörtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a). The results 

obtained in the present study indicate that the growth phase, growth temperature, and 

growth medium of bacteria influence their levels of oxidative damage during UVB 

exposure, thus highlighting the importance of the growth conditions of bacteria in 

determining their responses to UVB exposure. This is in accordance with previous 

studies conducted with Escherichia coli exposed to different UV wavelengths (Berney 

et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). These results also highlight the difficulties 

in understanding UV-bacteria interaction in natural bacterial communities and the 

limitations of extrapolating results from laboratorial experiments with bacterial isolates 

to the environment. 

The temporal variation in survival and oxidative damage to different 

biomolecules is illustrated in the representative conceptual graphs shown in Fig. 10.7 

for the interval corresponding to 0-10 kJ m-2, in which survival was dose-dependent in 

all treatments. Growth conditions preceding irradiation might influence bacterial 

sensitivity to UVB radiation potentially by affecting the temporal progression of 

biomolecule damage. For instance, cells in the mid-exponential phase displayed a strong 

increase in TBARS levels with irradiation, which preceded damage to the other 

molecules (Fig. 10.7). This observation suggests an important role of lipid damage in 

determining the reduction of cell survival during the very early stages of UVB exposure. 

There is increasing experimental evidence suggesting that lipid peroxidation is 



Chapter 10 

184 

physiologically important in microorganisms (Semchyshyn et al., 2005; Pérez et al., 

2007; Pérez et al., 2008).

NT5I1.2B upon exposure to low UVB doses (0-10 kJ m-2). Late-exponential and stationary phase cells followed a broad similar 

pattern of variation. Therefore only the temporal variation of stationary phase cells is shown. 



Chapter 10 

185 

The observed importance of lipid damage in UVB-induced inactivation is 

consistent with recent results obtained for a set of bacterial isolates (Santos et al., 2013), 

and the strong induction of the AhpC protein, involved in the defence of the cell against 

lipid peroxidation, in UVB-irradiated Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget 

et al., 2012).  

In late-exponential and stationary phase cells, DNA damage (DNA strand breaks 

and DNA-protein cross-links) seems to play a more determinant role in the reduction of 

cell survival, generally preceding damage to lipids and proteins (Fig. 10.7). The growth 

temperature and medium might affect UVB sensitivity by strongly influencing the 

magnitude of the damage to particular biomolecules. 

These results indicate that the variability of the effects associated with the 

different growth conditions must be considered for an in-depth understanding of the 

mechanisms of UVB-induced damage in bacteria. In order to gain environmentally 

relevant information from laboratorial studies with isolated bacteria, the growth 

conditions of those bacteria should be as similar as possible to the ones observed in the 

natural environment. 

 

Conclusions 

In general, a linear dose-dependent variation of oxidative damage parameters 

upon exposure to UVB was observed for low doses (0-10 kJ m-2) only, suggesting the 

occurrence of a dynamic process between damage induction and repair and/or potential 

saturation of oxidative damage at high UVB doses. Stationary phase cells were the most 

resistant to UVB radiation, and mid-exponential phase cells were the least resistant. 

Differences in UVB sensitivity between growth phases were mostly associated with the 

extent of protein carbonylation and DNA-protein cross-links. In mid-exponential phase 

cells, oxidative damage was generally higher at 25 ºC than at 15 ºC, suggesting a 

temperature dependence of ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with cellular targets 

at low UVB doses. At high UVB doses, survival was enhanced in cells grown in TSB 

than in M9. Growth conditions preceding irradiation are important determinants of 

survival and oxidative damage imposed by UVB exposure, potentially by affecting the 

temporal progression and the magnitude of the biomolecular damage.

Abstract 

The RecA protein plays a crucial role in the processes of homologous 

recombination and in the bacterial SOS response elicited by exposure to DNA damaging 

agents. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the importance of recombination and 

ability to cope with DNA damage during the life history of microorganisms could be 

reflected in RecA phylogeny and frequency in the genome. 

In the present work, the diversity of recA genes among completely sequenced 

bacterial genomes was studied. Additionally, recA and 16S rRNA gene trees of 

Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were constructed and 

compared. The presence of multiple recA copies in sequenced genomes and the 

frequency of plasmid-encoded recA genes were also examined. 

RecA was confirmed to be absent only in bacterial endosymbionts. Phylogenetic 

analysis of the RecA protein was, in general, coherent with the phyla defined by 16S 

rRNA gene analysis. recA gene trees of Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were in 

general agreement with 16S rRNA trees, but were more divergent in 

Gammaproteobacteria. Duplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread in 

myxobacteria, and also frequent among Firmicutes. Putative recA paralogs, resulting 

from a recent duplication event, were identified in some genomes. In other cases, 

divergent genomic G+C content suggests that this extra copy of recA could have arisen 

through horizontal gene transfer. The presence of recA homologs in plasmids and, in 

some cases, in the vicinity of transposase genes supports the possibility of plasmid or 

transposon-mediated mobility of the recA gene. We suggest that these plasmid-encoded 

recA genes could complement the activity of one or several of the chromosome-encoded 

recA genes in the bacterial SOS response.

Introduction 

Exposure to DNA damaging agents can cause halting of bacterial replication 

forks at sites of DNA lesions. Rescue of stalled DNA replication forks is mediated by 

homologous recombination, a process which is critical for genomic stability and cellular 

viability, contributing also for the generation of genetic diversity (Cox, 2007). The 

multifunctional RecA protein is the central factor in homologous recombination and 

recombinational DNA repair. In this process, RecA binds stretches of single-stranded 

DNA, unwinds duplex DNA, finds regions of homology between chromosomes and 

then promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA molecules. 

RecA also has a regulatory role in the induction of the SOS response involved in DNA 

repair through its co-protease activity, responsible for inducing the autocatalytic 

cleavage of the LexA repressor which initiates the expression of several DNA repair 

genes (Radman, 1975). Additionally, the RecA co-protease activity facilitates the 

activation of UmuD, a component of the error-prone DNA polymerase V that mediates 

replicative bypass of DNA lesions during the SOS response (Schlacher and Goodman, 

2007). Another catalytic activity of RecA is the self-cleavage of bacteriophage 

repressors, like CI from lambda, inducing the shift from lysogeny to lytic growth 

(Galkin et al., 2009). Recently, disruption of the recA gene in Acinetobacter revealed a 

pleiotropic effect on phenotypes like antibiotic resistance, virulence and heat-shock and 

oxidative stress responses (Aranda et al., 2011).  

The RecA activity is found in virtually all bacteria, with the exception of 

obligate intracellular symbionts that have undergone dramatic genome size reductions, 

which adopt alternative strategies for sustainable DNA replication and repair (Sharples, 

2009). The wide distribution of bacterial recA genes, in phylogenetic groups that took 

separate evolutionary paths during Precambrian times, including Bacteria, Archaea and 

Eukarya, indicates that the RecA protein ancestor preceded the separation of the three 

major biological domains (Roca and Cox, 1990). Based on studies of the RecA of 

Escherichia coli, the protein (352 aa) is generally divided into three domains (Bianco et 

al., 1998): an N-terminal domain (aa 1-33), involved in filament formation; the central 

‘core’ region (aa 33-240), which contains the residues involved in ATP binding; and the 

C-terminal domain (aa 241-352) which is involved in the DNA strand exchange reaction 

(Lusetti et al., 2003). At the amino acid level, the degree of conservation stretches 

basically across the entire sequence with the exception of the highly acidic C-terminus, 

less conserved. The near universality and degree of conservation of the recA gene has 



Chapter 11 

189 

made it a potentially useful tool for molecular systematic studies of bacteria (Eisen, 

1995; Ludwig and Klenk, 2001; Zeigler, 2003) and has been proposed as an alternative 

phylogenetic marker to 16S rRNA genes in several bacterial groups (Van Waasbergen 

et al., 2000; Torriani et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2005; Scholz et 

al., 2008; Sepe et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2009; Costechareyre et al., 2010; Landeta et al., 

2011). 

Evidences suggest that structural or kinetic properties of RecA are related to 

specific requirements of DNA damage repair systems in some species. For example, 

although the overall fold of the RecA of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus 

radiodurans is similar to that of E. coli, there is a large reorientation of the C-terminal 

domain involved in binding dsDNA. Additionally, it displays unique amino acid 

residues around a flexible ?-hairpin that is implicated in DNA binding (Rajan and Bell, 

2004). 

Most known bacterial species possess only one recA. The presence of two recA 

genes has been documented in Bacillus megaterium (Nahrstedt et al., 2005) and 

Myxococcus xanthus (Norioka et al., 1995). Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 seems 

to possess seven copies of this gene, four of which located in four out of its nine 

plasmids (Swingley et al., 2008). A recA gene homolog is also present on a 65 kb 

conjugative lactococcal plasmid (Garvey et al., 1997) and on a 53 kb plasmid from an 

environmental Vibrio strain (Hazen et al., 2007). More recently, the presence of two 

recA (recAP1 and recAP3) in two different plasmids in Deinococcus deserti in addition to 

the chromosomal recA was also reported (Dulermo et al., 2009). The authors proposed 

that the extra recAP1 and recAP3 genes may provide higher levels of RecA protein for 

efficient error-free repair of DNA damage.  

With the increasing number of bacterial genomes available in public databases, 

opportunities for more extensive analyses and contextualization of genes and proteins 

among complete sequenced organisms arise. The aims of this study were: (1) to inspect 

the presence of recA genes in sequenced bacterial genomes, including 

extrachromosomal replicons; (2) to evaluate the performance of the recA gene and 

deduced amino acid sequence as phylogenetic markers and (3) to search for evidences 

of events contributing for genome evolution, such as duplication or lateral transfer of 

recA genes.

Materials and methods 

Data retrieval 

The recA nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences within fully 

sequenced bacterial genomes were retrieved from GenBank NRAA database 

(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and manually inspected for the presence 

of sequences annotated as “recA”, “recombination protein A” or “recombinase A”. For 

the genomes where such annotation could not be found, the presence of recA homologs 

was inferred by searching for sequences with high similarity to the recA gene of E. coli 

using BLASTN (E value = 0.0). To search for homologs of the recA gene in plasmids, 

all the retrieved sequences were used as queries in BLASTN, TBLASTN, and PSI-

BLAST searches. Genes wrongly annotated as recA that displayed no similarity with 

recA homologs were excluded from the analysis (supplementary material in Appendix). 

G+C contents of genomes and recA genes were estimated based on nucleotide 

sequences retrieved from KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) (Kanehisa, 

2002) using locally developed Perl scripts. The genomic context of recA genes was 

manually retrieved from the GenBank database. 

 

Phylogenetic analyses 

To study the evolution of the RecA protein, phylogenetic trees using the amino 

acid sequence of the most conserved core region of RecA (aa 33-240 in E. coli) were 

constructed. DMC1 (Homo sapiens and Danio rerio), Rad51 (Drosophila simulans and 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and RadA (Pyrococcus abyssi) sequences (homologous of 

the bacterial RecA) were included in the phylogenetic tree as outgroups. Preliminary 

multiple sequence alignments were carried out with CLUSTALX 1.8 (Thompson et al., 

1997). Preliminary Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees were then generated using MEGA 3.0. 

To reduce the complexity of the phylogenetic tree, one representative sequence was 

chosen for closely related branches (diverging by less than 4 %). Each representative 

sequence was aligned again separately and then combined by using profile alignment in 

CLUSTALX. Different tree construction methods (Neighbour-Joining, Minimum 

Evolution and Maximum Parsimony) were compared and yielded similar results. The 

final Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed with MEGA 3.0 using the pairwise gap 

deletion option, Poisson correction as distance measure and 1000 bootstrap replicates.  

To address the congruence between the phylogenetic information provided by 

recA and 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, alignments of the corresponding genes were 



Chapter 11 

191 

produced using MEGA 3.0 with the pairwise gap deletion option. Phylogenies for 

specific bacterial groups (Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes) 

were reconstructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and distances estimated using 

the Jukes-Cantor model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. 

 

Results and discussion 

Distribution of the recA gene in sequenced bacterial genomes  

Fig. 11.1 shows the distribution by phylum of the 1076 genomes considered in 

the present study. Sequences belonging to Proteobacteria (41.7 %), Firmicutes (24.4 %), 

Actinobacteria (12.5 %) and Bacteroidetes (8.9 %) were the most represented in the 

database. The presence of the recA gene was detected in all the analyzed genomes, 

except those of the endosymbionts Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola 

(Alphaproteobacteria), Candidatus Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), Buchnera 

aphidicola (Gammaproteobacteria), species belonging to the Candidatus Blochmannia 

genus (Gammaproteobacteria), Candidatus Ruthia magnifica (Gammaproteobacteria), 

Candidatus Vesicomyosocius okutanii (Gammaproteobacteria) and phytoplasmas 

(Mollicutes). In these cases, the absence of recombination confers genetic stability to 

the mutualistic bacteria by precluding the occurrence of genetic rearrangements and 

lateral gene transfer (Sharples, 2009).

phylum in the total sequenced bacterial genomes is presented in brackets. 

 

In general, the recA genes analyzed contained 888 to 1341 nucleotides. On 

several genomes, smaller or larger sequences annotated as recA were also found. These 



Chapter 11 

192 

smaller sequences frequently corresponded to the C- or N- terminal regions of the RecA 

protein annotated separately and, in some cases, interrupted by introns or intein-coding 

sequences (Table 11.1). In other cases, longer recA gene sequences were also detected, 

that were subsequently found to contain introns or inteins. Introns are non-coding 

sequences located within genes that are transcribed but not translated into proteins, 

being removed by self-splicing whereby the intron catalyzes its own removal from the 

gene and the joining of coding sequences (exons) (Haugen et al., 2005). Inteins are 

protein intervening sequences that are able to cleave themselves from a precursor 

protein while joining the flanking sequences (Boles and Horswill, 2008). 

As the result of the presence of intein-coding sequences, longer recA genes were 

identified in a plasmid of E. coli (779 aa), several mycobacterium species (up to 790 aa) 

and in the soil-living actinomycete Thermobifida fusca (1172 aa, two inteins) (Table 

11.1). The presence of RecA inteins in the obligate intracellular mycobacterial 

pathogens have led to the hypothesis that these inteins might play a role in 

mycobacterial functions related to pathogenesis or virulence (Davis et al., 1994). In M. 

tuberculosis and M. leprae the RecA intein contains a catalytically active homing 

endonuclease domain which determines an endonuclease that promotes the spreading of 

the intein (Haugen et al., 2005). In the present work, the presence of a sequence 

encoding a homing endonuclease motif associated with an intein was also detected in 

the recA genes of the deep-sea actinomycete Verrucosispora maris and the thermophilic 

actinomycete Thermomonospora curvata, suggesting a recent spread of recA inteins 

among Actinomycetales. 

In several strains of Bacillus sp. and Geobacillus sp. the recA gene was also 

found to be interrupted by group I or group II introns (Table 11.1), which differ by their 

splicing mechanism (Haugen et al., 2005). Intein-coding sequences and introns in the 

recA of mycobacteria and Bacillus species have been proposed to be evolutionary 

related (Ko et al., 2002), though an endonuclease activity has not been found in the recA 

introns of Bacillus sp. (Nord et al., 2007). In B. anthracis the presence of an intron does 

not affect RecA activity nor the expression, pathogenicity, or the survival of the host 

organism (Ko et al., 2002). In Geobacillus kaustophilus the presence of the recA intron 

does not affect UV sensitivity (Chee and Takami, 2005). These observations suggest 

that the current function of recA intron seems dispensable (Ko et al., 2002), indicating 

that the spread of recA introns could have occurred through neutral evolution.

RecA is a potential phylogenetic marker 

To construct the phylogenetic tree of RecA, only sequences within the range 

between 296 and 447 amino acids were used. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree of RecA 

protein revealed the early divergence of sequences from Tenericutes from the remaining 

bacterial phyla (Fig. 11.2). Such observation is in accordance with previous work 

(Dybvig et al., 1992), and probably results from the rapid evolutionary rate of 

mycoplasmas compared to other prokaryotes and is consistent with 16S rRNA 

phylogeny (Woese, 1987). 

In general, the phylogenetic tree of RecA was consistent with the bacterial 

groups defined on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis (Ludwig, 2010), 

demonstrating the high degree of conservation of RecA which broadly parallels that of 

16S rRNA. However, some discrepancies were observed, which are identified in Fig. 

11.2 by red boxes. In the case of Gammaproteobacteria, the phylogenetic tree of RecA 

showed a separation of Acidithiobacillus and representatives of Chromatiales and 

Legionellales from the remaining Gammaproteobacteria members, which is in 

agreement with the polyphyletic nature of Gammaproteobacteria previously proposed 

based on a set of 356 protein families (Williams et al., 2010). The 

gammaproteobacterium Cellvibrio gilvus was found to cluster with Actinobacteria, 

which is in accordance with recent observations leading to the proposal of the 

reclassification of this species (Christopherson et al., 2012). Sequences from 

Deltaproteobacteria were located distantly from the remaining proteobacterial 

members, suggesting that the Proteobacteria phylum itself does not have a monophyletic 

origin, in accordance with conclusions drawn by several authors using molecular 

markers alternative to rRNA-coding genes (Zouine et al., 2002; Gophna et al., 2005; 

Dagan et al., 2010). Furthermore, the representative sequence for phylum Acidobacteria 

used in the present study clustered within the class Deltaproteobacteria, in agreement 

with a previous work that used 31 gene orthologs to reconstruct the tree of life 

(Ciccarelli et al., 2006). In conclusion, these results suggest that the RecA protein is a 

useful molecular marker to infer evolutionary relationships among bacteria since, in 

general, it reflects 16S rRNA phylogeny. 

In order to gain further insights into the suitability of the recA gene as a 

phylogenetic marker, as suggested by the RecA protein tree, the phylogenetic 

information provided by recA and the 16S rRNA genes was compared by constructing 

phylogenetic trees using the two genes for Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes, which 



Chapter 11 

196 

were found to contain several bacterial members with multiple recA copies (see section 

bellow). Additionally, since the RecA protein tree suggested a polyphyletic nature of 

Gammaproteobacteria, recA and 16S rRNA trees were also constructed for this group.

shown at the appropriate nodes. Labels and colour shadings are used to put in evidence commonly used subdivisions. 

 

The phylogeny of Gammaproteobacteria based on recA and 16S rRNA gene 

sequences is represented in Fig. 11.3. Both trees indicate that several of the established 

gammaproteobacterial orders, including Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales, 

Pseudomonadales and Chromatiales, are not monophyletic, in accordance with the 

conclusions of Williams et al. (2010) based on a set of 356 protein families. 

Additionally, in the recA tree the representative sequences of the Enterobacteriales 

order did not cluster together, being the sequences from Edwardsiella species more 

close to those from members of Pseudomonadales than to the remaining 



Chapter 11 

197 

Enterobacteriales. Additionally, sequences from Shewanella species, belonging to the 

Alteromonadales order, were found to cluster within Enterobacteriales. 

Gammaproteobacteria show particularly high rates of lateral gene transfer events (Abby 

et al., 2012) which could be a contributing factor for the higher degree of divergence 

between recA and 16S rRNA trees observed in this group. 

The phylogeny of Deltaproteobacteria based on recA and 16S rRNA genes is 

represented in Fig. 11.4. In general, the phylogenetic information provided by both trees 

was analogous, including the possibility of Desulfobacterales being a polyphyletic 

group. On the other hand, while the 16S rRNA gene tree suggested that 

Desulphurellales might represent a lineage distinct from the remaining 

Deltaproteobacteria, the same was not observed in the recA tree, in which 

Desulphurellales clustered together with Bdellovibrionales.  

The phylogenetic trees of Firmicutes based on 16S rRNA and recA genes are 

represented in Fig 11.5. A general agreement in the phylogenetic information of both 

trees was also observed in the case of Firmicutes, including the clustering of the 

Alicyclobacillaceae Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and Kyrpidia tusciae, usually 

classified as Bacilli, within the Clostridia cluster. On the other hand, while the two 

representative Negativicutes sequences clustered together in the 16S rRNA gene tree, 

this did not occur in the recA tree. 

 

recA duplication and horizontal gene transfer 

The presence of more than one copy of the recA gene was detected in 28 out of 

the 1076 chromosomes analyzed (2.6 %) (Table 11.2). The identity between the two 

recA gene copies (median = 63.5 %) ranged from 41 % in Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis 

KF147 to 91 % in Frankia sp., which could indicate that, in general, the two genes are 

unlikely to have resulted from a recent duplication event. The presence of more than 

one recA copy in bacterial chromosomes had been previously described in Myxococcus 

xanthus and Bacillus megaterium DMS 319 (2 copies), as well as in the cyanobacterium 

Acaryochloris marina (3 copies) (Norioka et al., 1995; Nahrstedt et al., 2005; Swingley 

et al., 2008). The present work indicates that the duplication of the recA gene may be 

common in certain bacterial groups, particularly Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes.

recA duplication in Deltaproteobacteria 

Two (and, in the case of Corallococcus coralloides DSM 2259, three) copies of 

the recA gene were found in all the available complete genome sequences of members 

of the Myxococcales order. The identity of the two copies ranged between 49 % in 

Stigmatella aurantiaca and 74 % in Anaeromyxobacter sp. K. When Karlin et al. (1995) 

first reported the presence of two recA genes in M. xanthus, the authors suggested that 

the higher amount of the RecA repair protein would allow this topsoil bacteria to 

withstand UV irradiation. The present observation of the widespread duplication of recA 

in myxobacteria inhabiting various environments suggests that UV radiation is not the 

only factor underlying the presence of additional copies of the recA gene. 

Myxococcales typically display large genomes ranging from ~10 to 13 Mb, 

while anaerobic myxobacteria belonging to the genus Anaeromyxobacter have smaller 

genome sizes (~5 Mb). The typically large genome size of myxobacteria seems to be 

due to genome expansion as a result of duplications of specific categories of genes, 

particularly those involved in cell-cell signaling, small molecule sensing and 

multicomponent transcriptional control. Such genome expansion allowed the evolution 

of the complex molecular machinery required for the development of a multicellular 

lifestyle typical of myxobacteria (Goldman et al., 2006). As hypothesized for the 

cyanobacteria Acaryochloris marina (Swingley et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011), it is 

possible that the presence of multiple copies of recA and related genes in a 



Chapter 11 

200 

myxobacteria ancestral could have mediated the gene duplication and/or integration of 

foreign genes that led to their genome expansion, and at the same time would allow 

genome stability, through its role in the DNA damage repair and DNA recombination. It 

is interesting to notice that in the case of Candidatus Solibacter usitatus (Phylum 

Acidobacteria), which also possesses a very large genome (10 Mb), there are also three 

annotated copies of the recA gene in the genome (though two of them are smaller than 

the expected size). Since not all large bacterial genomes display multiple copies of the 

recA gene, it is possible that recA duplication could have played an important role in the 

expansion of the genome of bacteria belonging to particular phylogenetic groups, such 

as the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, myxobacteria and the Acidobacteria 

Candidatus Solibacter usitatus.  

 

recA duplication in Firmicutes 

Duplication of the recA gene was also detected in some Firmicutes genomes 

such as those of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus species and Bacillus megaterium which 

belong to Bacilli, and the Clostridia Moorella thermoacetica (Table 11.2). In the case of 

M. thermoacetica the second gene copy was found to be more similar to the homologs 

of Bacilli than Clostridia (Fig. 11.5). The identity between the two gene copies ranged 

between 41 % in Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis KF147 and 76 % in Bacillus megaterium 

QM B1551. The presence of two recA copies in B. megaterium had previously been 

reported and proposed to contribute to increase its ability for recombinational repair and 

enhance its resistance to DNA damage compared to other Bacillus species (Nahrstedt et 

al., 2005). The presence of two copies of the recA gene among members of Firmicutes 

of different phylogenetic lineages (Clostridia and Bacilli) could either be explained by 

horizontal acquisition of the extra recA gene or an ancient duplication event in a 

Firmicutes ancestor with subsequent loss of the gene in all other Clostridia except M. 

thermoacetica.  

In order to address the possible horizontal acquisition of recA genes in 

Firmicutes, the G+C content of the gene and the respective genome was compared 

(Table 11.3). Among Firmicutes, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris A76 and 

Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc 705 displayed considerable differences between the G+C 

content of the second recA gene and the average genomic G+C content, by 

approximately 13 % and 10 %, respectively.

Such difference could indicate an exogenous acquisition of the second recA copy 

in these organisms. Furthermore, in the case of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris A76, 

BLASTP searches using the second RecA as a query revealed it was most related with 

the RecA homolog (RecAlp) from the plasmid pNP40 of Lactococcus lactis, raising the 

possibility of the mobility of the recA gene being mediated through mobile genetic 

elements.

The high similarity observed between recA copies in Bacillus megaterium 

strains (87 %) could be indicative of a recent duplication event. A much lower similarity 

of the two recA copies in Lactobacillus (60 %), Lactococcus (45 %) and Moorella (65 

%), suggests that divergence between the copies could have taken place earlier in their 

evolution or eventually the second copy could have been acquired by horizontal gene 

transfer. Nevertheless, the concordance between recA and 16S rRNA trees suggests that 

potential gene transfer events have not obscured the phylogenetic relationships.  

In B. megaterium both copies seem to be functional (Nahrstedt et al., 2005), 

while in the other Firmicutes members this is not known. The investigation of the 

functionality of the two recA copies among other Firmicutes could shed further light 

into the potential role of RecA in the evolution of these lineages. Speculations can only 

be made about the significance of the presence of the extra recA among these bacterial 

members. Lactococcus and Lactobacillus are microaerophilic organisms that under 

certain conditions can tolerate oxygen. However, oxygen consumption results in altered 

redox state with the formation of reactive oxygen species which can pose a significant 

threat (Duwat et al., 1995). The involvement of RecA in resistance to oxidative and 

thermal stress has been reported in Lactococcus lactis, in which it seems to play an 

important role in the repair of damage induced by the hydroxyl radical generated by the 

Fenton reaction (Duwat et al., 1995). Whether the presence of an extra recA gene 

confers a supplementary protection to DNA damage in these bacteria, is not known. 



Chapter 11 

203 

Moorella thermoacetica, on the other hand, is strictly anaerobic, making additional 

protection against oxidative stress as the explanation for the presence of a second recA 

copy paradoxical. However, previous investigations showed the presence in M. 

thermoacetica of a gene cluster coding for proteins involved in oxidative and nitrosative 

stress protection, including an aerobic type Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 

catalase (Das et al., 2005). Based on these observations, one possible explanation for the 

presence of two recA copies in M. thermoacetica was the presence of the two recA 

genes in an ancestral common to Bacilli and Clostridia that was latter lost from the 

remaining Clostridia and then from most Bacilli. As before, whether this extra copy is 

functional and possesses a role in the fitness of this organism, is unknown and merits 

further research. 

 

recA duplications in other bacterial groups 

In the gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas mendocina ymp, the second recA 

gene displayed a high deviation in its G+C content compared to the average of the 

genome (51.7 % versus 64.6 %, Table 11.3). The corresponding protein showed a 

maximum identity of 77 % with the RecA from Shewanella sp. MR-4. These 

observations indicate that the second recA gene of Pseudomonas mendocina ymp could 

have been acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event. Furthermore, analysis of the 

genomic context of the second recA copy revealed the presence of two genes coding for 

putative transposases immediately downstream. Genes encoding for the presence of 

transposases in the immediate vicinity of the recA gene were detected in other 22 

genomes (supplementary information in Appendix), four of them associated to recA 

duplicates (Lactococcus lactis KF147, Frankia sp. EAMI1pec, Moorella thermoacetica 

ATCC 39073 and Pseudomonas mendocina ymp). In the case of the 

Gammaproteobacteria Frankia sp. EAMI1pec and Pseudomonas mendocina ymp the 

presence of putative transposases belonging to the same family (IS4) was observed. 

Whether these genetic elements could have played a role in the acquisition of the 

additional recA, is unknown.  

 

Presence of recA in plasmids 

The presence of recA homologs was detected in 31 plasmids deposited in the 

NCBI database (Table 11.4). The existence of plasmid-located recA genes was already 

reported in Lactococcus lactis (Garvey et al., 1997), Vibrio sp. (Hazen et al., 2007), 



Chapter 11 

204 

Acaryochloris marina (Swingley et al., 2008) and Deinococcus deserti (Dulermo et al., 

2009). In the present work, plasmid-encoded recA genes were also detected in plasmids 

of members of the gammaproteobacterial genera Escherichia, Serratia, Pseudomonas, 

Yersinia and Salmonella, the Firmicutes Paenibacillus and the Chloroflexi 

Thermomicrobium. Inter-subspecies lateral gene transfer of recA has been demonstrated 

at least in Salmonella species (McQuiston et al., 2008), and our observations raise the 

possibility of the involvement of plasmids in the process. 

In general, plasmid-encoded recA genes showed the highest identity with recA 

genes encoded in the chromosome of the host organism, but some exceptions were 

observed (Table 11.4). For example, the recA gene in plasmid pSM22 of Serratia 

marcescens strain B-6493 (Enterobacteriales) encoded a protein that showed its highest 

identity to the RecA of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus ATCC 33389 (Pasteurellales). In 

this case, a notable difference (7 %) was also observed between the G+C content of the 

plasmid-encoded recA gene and the G+C content of the plasmid, which could indicate 

an exogenous origin. It is also noteworthy the presence of a gene encoding a transposase 

in the vicinity of the plasmid-encoded recA (Fig. 11.6 A, B). The presence in the 

plasmid of a gene coding for DNA polymerase V subunit, which performs translesion 

DNA synthesis during the SOS response, immediately adjacent to the recA gene (Fig. 

11.6 A, B) could suggest that this plasmid-encoded copy might fulfil a role in 

complementing the chromosomally elicited SOS response.

Thermomicrobium roseum. In both cases, DNA polymerases involved in error repair are present in the vicinity of the recA gene. The 

displayed length is proportional to the size of the corresponding open reading frame. 

 

In the Chloroflexi Thermomicrobium the protein encoded by the plasmid recA 

gene showed a maximum identity (31 %) to the homologous of the 

alphaproteobacterium Hyphomicrobium denitrificans ATCC 51888.

Also in this case, an error prone DNA polymerase was found upstream the 

plasmid recA, suggesting a role in the SOS response (Fig. 11.6 B). However, whether 

these plasmid-located recA genes are functional and actually contribute for the SOS 

response of the cell, or play any part in increasing the fitness of these organisms, is 

unknown and an interesting matter of research. 

 

Conclusions 

The recA gene is ubiquitous in eubacteria, being absent only in endosymbionts. 

In the latter the absence of this gene seems to confer genetic stability, which may be 

advantageous for the intracellular lifestyle. In some bacterial strains such as those 

belonging to the Mycoplasma genus, the recA gene is interrupted by intein-coding 

sequences with a homing endonuclease function. In some Bacillus and Geobacillus 

species recA is also interrupted by introns, which might have played an evolutionary 

role. In general, the phylogeny of the RecA protein supports the phyla defined on the 

basis of rRNA gene analysis demonstrating its high degree of conservation resulting 

from its fundamental housekeeping role in bacteria. recA and 16S rRNA trees of 

Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were broadly in agreement. Results were more 

divergent in Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that recA may not be a good molecular 

marker for this group. The presence of two copies of the recA gene seems to be a 

common feature of myxobacteria, where it could have mediated its genome expansion. 

recA duplication is also frequent among some Firmicutes. Further work is necessary to 

assess the functionality of the newly detected extra copies of recA. Additionally, our 

results point to the possibility of acquisition of extra recA genes by horizontal gene 

transfer with a possible involvement of plasmids in mediating the acquisition.

CHAPTER 12 

DISCUSSION 

The combined effects of global changes, such as ocean acidification and thermal 

stratification, and changes in solar UV fluxes are expected to result in enhanced 

exposure of aquatic organisms to damaging UV wavelengths over the course of the next 

decades, with far reaching ecological consequences (Andrady et al., 2010).  

The effects of UV radiation are well known to be wavelength-dependent (Sundin 

and Jacobs, 1999; Qiu et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2005a; Bauermeister 

et al., 2009). A relatively large number of studies have addressed the effects of UV 

radiation, particularly in the UVB range, on natural bacterioplankton assemblages from 

various geographic locations (Bailey et al., 1983; Herndl et al., 1993; Müller-Niklas et 

al., 1995; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Pakulski et al., 1998; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006; 

Langenheder et al., 2006; Hernández et al., 2007; Joux et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2011a; 

Santos et al., 2012a; Santos et al., 2012b).  

In the environment, the interaction between UV radiation and microorganisms is 

complex and influenced by several factors, including species composition, 

environmental factors such as temperature, salinity and nutrients, as well as intrinsic 

properties, like DNA repair potential, cell size and growth phase (Berney et al., 2006c; 

Joux et al., 2009; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). In the case of the UVB range, the 

effects on aquatic organisms are, at least in part, determined by the dose of harmful 

radiation to which an individual organism is exposed which, in turn, is affected by both 

the positioning of the organism in the water column and the optical characteristics (i.e. 

UVB transmittance) of the water body (Sommaruga, 2003).  

 

Bacterioneuston as a model community for environmental photobiology 

studies 

Located at the air-water interface, the surface microlayer (SML) represents a 

unique microbial niche (Norkrans, 1980) inhabited by a bacterial community, i.e. 

bacterioneuston, that is particularly exposed to high doses of solar UV radiation (Hardy, 

1982). Despite these harmful conditions, the surface microlayer has been reported to 

contain higher abundances of microorganisms than underlying waters (UW) (Norkrans, 

1980; Hardy, 1982; Agogué et al., 2004), suggesting that bacterioneuston might have 



Chapter 12 

208 

developed strategies to survive in this “extreme environment”. Therefore, 

bacterioneuston emerges as an interesting model system for the assessment of UVB 

effects on aquatic organisms, which might provide valuable predictive information on 

the consequences of future changes in UV radiation levels in the underlying water 

column. 

In the present work, the influence of the light history of bacterial communities to 

their UVB sensitivity was assessed on two levels (1) by studying and comparing the 

effects of UVB exposure on the bacterial communities of the SML and UW in terms of 

abundance, activity, phylogenetic and physiological diversity, and (2) by studying and 

comparing the photobiological responses of bacterial isolates retrieved from the SML 

and UW.  

Effects of UVB radiation on bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton 

Regarding experiments with communities from the SML and UW, irradiation 

was found to have a lower impact on the abundance of culturable and total bacteria in 

bacterioneuston than in bacterioplankton, suggesting the possibility of enhanced UVB 

resistance of bacterial communities from the SML. Decreases in cell abundance were 

accompanied by a reduction in the phylogenetic diversity of both bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton, revealed by DGGE fingerprinting, thus demonstrating the relevance 

of UVB radiation as a driver of the structure of bacterial communities. UVB-induced 

changes in bacterial community structure can mainly be attributed to (i) differences in 

UVB sensitivity among bacterial members (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; 

Agogué et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2011b) and/or (ii) selection for bacterial community 

members specialized on photochemically modified dissolved organic matter (DOM) 

compounds and resistant to oxidative stress induced by inhibitory photoproducts (Fisher 

et al., 2008). Using DGGE analysis and sequencing, two ribotypes affiliated to the UV-

resistant Gammaproteobacteria class (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006) were found to persist 

throughout the irradiation period in both bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton 

suggesting the occurrence of selection of resistant strains by UVR. 

FISH analysis supported the qualitative information provided by DGGE, 

confirming Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant group in bacterioneuston (Franklin 

et al., 2005). Furthermore, FISH results revealed that the relative abundance of the UV-

resistant Gammaproteobacteria class increased with UVB exposure, dominating both 

irradiated bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton. The observations made in the present 



Chapter 12 

209 

work indicate that UVB exposure might select photo-resistant members of the bacterial 

community. Furthermore, the dominance of the UV-resistant Gammaproteobacteria 

group in the original SML community suggests that bacterioneuston may contain a pool 

of UV-resistant bacteria. This hypothesis is in accordance with earlier suggestions that 

members of bacterioneuston may have adapted to cope with the stressful conditions of 

the SML (Hermansson et al., 1987). More recently, Stolle et al. (2011) also observed 

that the strongest differences between the active communities of the non-attached size 

fraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton occurred in response to high radiation 

levels. The authors suggested that UV radiation altered the community composition of 

non-attached, active bacterioneuston members, particularly under low wind conditions, 

resulting in increased differences between bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton.  

In general, UVB-induced inhibition of protein synthesis was higher in 

bacterioneuston, while DNA synthesis was more inhibited in bacterioplankton. 

However, the observation of a lower UVB-induced decrease in cell abundance (total 

and culturable) in bacterioneuston compared to bacterioplankton, suggests enhanced UV 

resistance of bacterioneuston. It is possible that reducing protein synthesis upon UVB 

exposure could be a metabolic strategy that contributes to enhance survival, as actively 

growing bacteria are more susceptible to stress (Fischer and Sauer, 2005). Such a 

hypothesis would also help to explain the consistently reported lower bacterial biomass 

productivity at the SML compared to UW (Obernosterer et al., 2008; Reinthaler et al., 

2008; Stolle et al., 2010), though nutrients often concentrate at the air-water interface 

(Williams et al., 1986). 

UVB also caused a shift in the physiological profiles of sole-carbon-source 

utilization of the communities, assessed by the Biolog EcoPlateTM approach. Though 

limited in assessing the functional diversity of bacterial assemblages, Biolog 

EcoPlatesTM have been used in the study of carbon source use patterns in different 

environments (Christian and Lind, 2006). Biolog EcoPlatesTM have also been used to 

assess changes induced by sea ice melting in the functional diversity of bacterioplankton 

(Sala et al., 2010) and, together with the present work, reveal the potential of this tool to 

study the impact of global changes in the functioning of aquatic microbial communities.  

The use of Biolog EcoPlatesTM also provided new insights into the biology of 

bacterioneuston, specifically, the existence of clearly distinctive metabolic profiles in 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton. The original bacterioneuston community was 

able to use 11 out of the 32 substrates provided, being ?-ketobutyric acid (14.2 %) and 



Chapter 12 

210 

glucose-1-phosphate (13.4 %) the most used substrates. On the other hand, the original 

bacterioplankton community was able to use 4 out of the 32 substrates provided, being 

i-erythritol (41.6 %) the most used one. These observations suggest substantial 

differences in the function of these structurally similar communities. Such results are in 

accordance with previous reports of differences in the relative abundances of bacterial 

groups incorporating leucine, as well as differences in terms of functional traits 

associated with trace gas metabolism, in the two communities (Cunliffe et al., 2008; 

Obernosterer et al., 2008; Hörtnagl et al., 2010).  

UVB exposure caused not only a decrease in the number of substrates used by 

both communities but also a shift in the type of substrate preferably used. In 

bacterioneuston, the observed overall trend was from a metabolism relying mostly on 

carbohydrates and amino acids in the original community to a metabolism mostly 

dependent on carbohydrates upon UVB exposure. In the case of bacterioplankton, the 

metabolism of the original community was heavily dependent on the use of phenolic 

compounds and relied mostly on the use of amino acids after irradiation. 

UVB-induced shifts in metabolic profiles can be related to alterations in 

microbial community composition or adaptation of the prevalent community to UVB 

radiation (Insam and Goberna, 2004). In the latter case, changes in the profiles of 

carbon sources preferably used are expected to be a consequence of a shift from cellular 

growth to DNA repair and other processes to ameliorate UVB-induced damage. 

However, the meaning of the observed metabolic shifts is still difficult to explain, in 

light of current knowledge. Further studies using, for instance, a metabolomic approach 

will help to gain more insights into the metabolic events that follow UVB exposure and 

their biological and ecological consequences. 

Experimental considerations 

The effects of UVB radiation on the structural and functional diversity of 

bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were studied using a microcosm setup under 

laboratorial conditions. The depth of the irradiated SML and UW samples was similar 

and corresponded to approximately the averaged depth of the SML described in the 

literature (Cunliffe et al., 2011). Clear effects of UVB on the abundance, diversity and 

activity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were observed, and a potential for the 

SML to contain bacterial members adapted to cope with high UV levels emerged. 

However, the possibility that these effects were exacerbated by the experimental setup 



Chapter 12 

211 

used cannot be excluded, as it most likely limited natural avoidance mechanisms, such 

as vertical migration, and did not allow the diffusion of toxic by-products of DOM 

photodegradation (Sommaruga, 2003). Nevertheless, such biases were present in both 

SML and UW experimental setups and should not compromise the comparison of the 

responses of both communities.  

Preliminary experiments indicated that the removal of neither zooplankton nor 

phytoplankton from water samples affected, with statistical significance, the 

photobiological responses of the two bacterial communities, in accordance to previous 

works (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006). The possibility that the overall bacterial responses 

observed may have a contribution of the effects of UVB on other members of the SML 

and UW communities, namely virus, cannot be excluded, but this can actually help to 

contextualize bacterial photobiological responses in the context of the microbial food 

web. 

Isolation of UV-resistant bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton 

In order to gain further insights into the influence of the light history of bacterial 

communities on their photobiological responses, UVB-resistant bacteria were isolated 

from the surface microlayer and underlying waters of the estuarine system of Ria de 

Aveiro. The individual UVB sensitivity of the retrieved isolates was then assessed in 

terms of CFU numbers, activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon 

source use profiles, repair potential (light-dependent and independent), and 

photoadaptation potential under different physiological conditions.  

As observed with experiments conducted with communities, isolates from the 

SML were, on average, significantly more resistant to UVB-induced damage than those 

retrieved from the UW, as assessed from culturable counts. Leucine incorporation was 

more reduced in bacterioneuston isolates than in bacterioplankton isolates, while 

thymidine incorporation was equally inhibited by UVB exposure in both sets of isolates. 

A shift in the physiological profile of the bacterial isolates with UVB exposure, assayed 

using Biolog EcoPlatesTM, was also observed, in accordance with the results obtained in 

the experiments with bacterial communities. Such a shift was particularly considerable 

in bacterioneuston isolates, which displayed statistically significant decreases in the 

utilization of amines and amino acids with irradiation. This shift in the physiological 

profile could reflect an active transcriptional reaction of the cells to UVB stress, 

involving a change in metabolic resource allocation from growth to defence/repair, 



Chapter 12 

212 

and/or could be a consequence of metabolic restructuring to compensate for UV-

induced damage to sensitive enzymes.  

UV sensitivity and repair potential was found to be affected by the nutritional 

condition of the cell, with nutrient depleted cells displaying enhanced sensitivity to 

UVB radiation and enhanced inhibition of thymidine incorporation. This observation 

denotes modulation of UVB responses by the nutritional status of the cell. In 

bacterioneuston, but not in bacterioplankton, recovery from UVB-induced damage was 

enhanced under nutrient starvation, suggesting the possibility of an intrinsic adaptation 

of bacterioneuston to nutrient depletion. Dissolved organic compounds (e.g., free amino 

acids) are known to accumulate at the SML (Williams et al., 1986). However, 

bacterioneuston seems to display consistently lower bacterial growth efficiencies than 

bacterioplankton, indicating differences in the physiological state of bacterioneuston 

and bacterioplankton (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002; Reinthaler et al., 2008). Rapidly 

growing cells are often more susceptible to inactivation than slower growing ones, 

because of the shorter time for excision repair between rounds of replication (Harm, 

1980; Jagger, 1985). The present work raises the possibility that natural differences in 

physiological state of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton could influence their UV 

sensitivity and help to explain the enhanced UVB resistance of bacterioneuston. 

 

New insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage 

Though UV radiation of different wavelengths is well known to cause damage to 

cells, ultimately resulting in cell death (Moan and Peak, 1989), the cellular targets of 

UV radiation, particularly in the UVB range, in bacteria and the mechanisms whereby 

radiation elicits damage to the cell are still unclear.  

In order to gain further insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage, a 

set of bacterial isolates with different UV sensitivities was used as biological models to 

study (1) the wavelength-dependence of the biological damage elicited by UV radiation, 

(2) the identity and targets of the ROS involved in UVB-induced damage, (3) the 

influence of transition metals in the oxidative damage elicited by UVB exposure and (4) 

the role of abiotic properties and bacterial growth conditions in UVB-induced damage.



Chapter 12 

213 

Wavelength-dependence of UV-induced damage 

Reduction in cell numbers and activity, as well as DNA damage, displayed a 

clear wavelength-dependent variation following exposure to UV radiation of different 

spectral regions (UVA, UVB and UVC), being highest under UVC and lowest under 

UVA. Intracellular ROS generation, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and protein 

carbonylation, showed an inverse pattern, being highest upon exposure to UVA 

irradiation. These observations are in good agreement with earlier observations denoting 

the indirect, oxidative nature of UVA-induced damage (Eisenstark, 1970; Webb and 

Lorenz, 1970; Reed, 1997) and the high genotoxic potential of UVC radiation (Moan 

and Peak, 1989). 

Principal component analysis confirmed the involvement of the extent of the 

oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, as well as ROS levels, in separating UVA-

treated samples from the remaining, while the extent of DNA damage, assessed as DNA 

strand breaks (DSB), contributed the most for the separation of UVC-treated samples. 

Effects of UVB were found to be intermediate between those of UVA and UVC, in 

accordance with previous observations (Qiu et al., 2005a). 

In order to identify the main determinants of bacterial inactivation under the 

different UV wavelengths, multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was applied to 

the data set. Despite the fact that UVA-treated samples were differentiated from the 

remaining treatments by enhanced levels of ROS and protein and lipid oxidation, 

surprisingly the amount of DSB emerged as the major determinant of inactivation upon 

exposure to UVA. DNA does not have a strong absorption in the UVA range. 

Therefore, UVA-induced damage to DNA is usually considered to be a result of 

photodynamic reactions mediated by cellular chromophores (Cadet et al., 2005a). 

However, recent investigations conducted in eukaryotes have highlighted the high 

mutagenic potential of UVA (Rünger et al., 2012) and the role of cyclobutane 

pyrimidine dimers, rather than oxidative lesions, in UVA-induced damage (Ikehata et 

al., 2008). The most UVA sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of DSB 

and TBARS (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05) than resistant ones. Taken together, these 

results suggest that the extent of oxidative damage to biomolecules underlies the 

variability in UVA susceptibility among different bacteria but, ultimately, it is the 

accumulation of DNA lesions that leads to cell death under this radiation regime. 



Chapter 12 

214 

Under UVB, the main determinants of inactivation were found to be oxidative 

damage to lipids (TBARS), accumulation of DNA damage, as well as loss of metabolic 

activity. These results indicate the involvement of changes in the integrity of membrane 

structure and functionality, besides DNA damage, in bacterial inactivation by UVB 

radiation. The most UVB sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of 

protein carbonyls than resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a role of 

protein oxidative damage in determining bacterial sensitivity to UVB radiation. 

Enhanced levels of protein chaperones were previously reported in Sphingopyxis 

alaskensis following UVB exposure (Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a), denoting the 

importance of maintaining proper protein structure and function upon irradiation under 

UVB.  

Regression analysis revealed that ROS levels together with DNA damage were 

the best predictors of cell inactivation under UVC. The most UVC sensitive strains were 

characterized by significantly higher TBARS and carbonyls levels than resistant ones 

(1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). These results suggest that the extent of ROS-mediated 

damage to lipids and proteins, probably by interfering with vital biological functions, is 

a critical component of UVC-induced inactivation (Krisko and Radman, 2010; Schenk 

et al., 2011). Unexpectedly, ROS levels were significantly higher in resistant strains 

than in sensitive ones (1-way ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0.05). ROS are known to be involved in 

eliciting specific defence strategies in response to UVC exposure in cyanobacteria 

(Dillon et al., 2002) and plants (Murphy and Huerta, 1990). The present work raises the 

possibility that ROS might play a physiological role in mediating the responses of 

bacteria to UVC radiation that deserves further investigation. 

In order to gain additional insights into the cellular targets of UV radiation of 

different wavelengths, the effects of irradiation on the lipids and proteins of two 

representative bacteria with distinct UV sensitivities were studied by mid-infrared 

spectroscopy. In general, exposure to UV radiation of different wavelengths resulted in 

an increase in lipid methylation, denoted by the increase in the intensity of mid-infrared 

bands at approximately 2950 cm-1, 2870 cm-1, 1460 cm-1 and 1370 cm-1. Lipid 

methylation strongly affects the fluidity of cellular membranes and changes in 

membrane fluidity have been associated with cellular adaptation to stress in Oenococcus 

oeni (Delmas et al., 2001) and signal transduction in higher organisms (Sangwan et al., 

2002). Whether such changes could be involved in eliciting the bacterial response to UV 

radiation, is unknown. 



Chapter 12 

215 

Additionally, changes in the intensity of methyl bands together with decreased 

intensity of bands associated with esters and glyco- and/or phospholipids were also 

observed, suggesting altered lipid composition upon UV exposure. Such changes could 

reflect a consequence of damage to enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. 

Alternatively, it could represent a metabolic strategy to preserve the resources of the cell 

for repair strategies, for example, by using less phosphorus for phospholipid synthesis, 

diverting it for DNA repair strategies that require ATP. 

UV exposure also resulted in a general increase in the intensity of mid-infrared 

bands associated with lipid oxidation products, denoting the potential of UV radiation to 

induce lipid oxidation also suggested from the measurement of TBARS levels. 

Mid-infrared analysis of proteins extracted from irradiated cells showed UV-

induced changes in the frequency and/or intensity of the components of the mid-infrared 

amide I band centred at approximately 1650 cm-1, thus suggesting altered protein 

conformation and/or composition with irradiation. The observed changes in protein 

conformation could be associated with (1) induction of repair strategies (Demple, 1991), 

(2) aggregation and/or oxidative modifications of amino acid side chains, also consistent 

with the observed decrease in intensity of the mid-infrared band of tyrosine at 

approximately 1518 cm-1 (Lasch et al., 2001), and (3) synthesis of proteins with 

different composition and/or conformations in response to UV radiation (Matallana-

Surget et al., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b). 

Additionally, mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed that UV exposure was also 

accompanied by a substantial increase in the intensity of methylene/CH2 (and to a lesser 

extent, methyl/CH3) bands associated with proteins and/or amino acids. This 

observation can reflect changes in protein composition, specifically, an increase in the 

relative proportion of amino acids particularly rich in CH2 groups, like proline, lysine, 

isoleucine or glutamine/glutamic acid, potentially involved in stress protection (Ková?ik 

et al., 2010). Additionally, enhanced intensity of bands assigned to CH3 and CH2 

stretching vibrations can arise as a result of the addition of these groups to proteins 

during the process of propionylation of lysine residues (Singh et al., 2012). 

Propionylation is involved in the regulation of the activity of some enzymes in bacteria 

(Garrity et al., 2007). Whether this process could play a role in the metabolic response 

of bacteria to UV-induced stress is unknown and an interesting matter of research.  

Finally, UV exposure also resulted in a general decrease in intensity of mid-

infrared bands associated with glycosylated and/or phosphorylated proteins in the region 



Chapter 12 

216 

between 1200-900 cm-1. This observation could possibly denote a decrease in the 

phosphorylation level of proteins, which was previously observed in Xanthomonas 

oryzae following UVC exposure (Huang et al., 1995), and/or decreased protein 

glycosylation levels. Changes in protein glycosylation levels are known to be involved 

in the regulation of the activity of specific proteins, including the RecA protein 

coordinating the SOS response of bacteria (Fischer and Haas, 2004). 

Whether the modifications observed by mid-infrared spectroscopy in bacterial 

lipids and proteins reflect UV-induced damage to biomolecules or could actually be 

involved in a UV stress response mechanism is unknown and warrants further research. 

Additional studies using complementary techniques, such as mass spectrometry-based 

lipidomics and proteomics, could help to address the specific questions raised during 

this investigation. 

Identity and targets of ROS in UVB-induced damage 

In order to identify the ROS involved in UVB-induced damage and their 

biological targets, bacterial suspensions were pre-treated with specific scavengers for 

different ROS (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and superoxide 

radical) before irradiation and their photobiological responses compared with those of 

isolates not amended with the scavengers.  

Amendment of cell suspensions with sodium azide, a singlet oxygen scavenger, 

enhanced survival during UVB exposure and conferred a statistically significant 

protective effect against lipid oxidation. These observations indicate that singlet oxygen 

might play a pivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation, previously identified in 

eukaryotic cells (Vile and Tyrrell, 1995).  

The hydroxyl radical, on the other hand, might be involved in DNA damage, as 

suggested by the observation of statistically significant lower levels of DSB in 

mannitol-amended samples. Such observation is in accordance with previous reports of 

the contribution of the hydroxyl radical to DNA damage in human cells exposed to UV 

radiation (Peak and Peak, 1990). Mannitol also significantly attenuated protein 

carbonylation during UVB exposure, indicating the participation of the hydroxyl radical 

in oxidative damage to proteins during UVB exposure. 

The addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly protected the capacity 

for glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that superoxide and H2O2 potentially 

participate in the impairment of metabolic activity during UVB exposure.  



Chapter 12 

217 

However, in some cases amendment with ROS scavenger resulted in an 

exacerbation of the detrimental effect of UVB radiation on biological parameters. In 

particular, a statistically significant increase in the amount of DSB was observed upon 

pre-treatment of cells with SOD and CAT, suggesting that the activity of these enzymes 

can contribute to the oxidative damage of biomolecules during exposure to UVB. Such 

observation is in accordance with previous work reporting the ability of CAT activity to 

generate ROS during UVB exposure when the antioxidant capabilities of the cell are 

diminished (Heck et al., 2003; Heck et al., 2010). SOD can also contribute to enhance 

the oxidative burden of the cell since H2O2 generated from its activity is a more oxidant 

species than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). Ultimately, depending on the intracellular 

oxidation status of the cell, the activity of these antioxidant enzymes in response to 

UVB radiation can be either protective or cytotoxic. 

Role of metals in UVB-induced damage 

Metals play a crucial catalytic role in the production of free radicals and 

oxidative stress. In recent years, research conducted in different biological models has 

highlighted the role of divalent cationic metals in protection against the detrimental 

effects of several stressors (Daly et al., 2004; Bagwell et al., 2008; Ghosh et al., 2011; 

Granger et al., 2011). However, the role of transition metals on the susceptibility of 

bacteria to environmentally relevant UVB radiation is unknown. This information is 

crucial to fully understand the effects UV radiation in bacterial communities in natural 

environments, where metals are frequently present and may represent an additional 

stress factor (Zhou, et al., 2008) 

In general, UVB and metal amendment, most notably iron, copper and 

manganese, contributed synergistically to enhance bacterial inactivation. In particular, 

iron amendment exacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and lipid oxidative damage 

during irradiation. Oxidative damage to lipids was also enhanced in cells pre-treated 

with copper and cobalt. Such observations are in accordance with the involvement of 

iron in promoting the generation of the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical through the 

Fenton reaction (Buda et al., 2003). Copper can also participate in Haber-Weiss 

reactions that mediate the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Santo et al., 2011). 

Previous investigations have reported altered expression of genes and proteins involved 

in iron influx and storage, as well as iron-containing enzymes, in bacteria exposed to 

UV radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Qiu et al., 2005b; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). The 



Chapter 12 

218 

present work indicates that metal homeostasis during irradiation might be important in 

limiting oxidative stress associated with UVB exposure. 

Amendment of cell suspensions with manganese resulted in a statistically 

significant reduction in protein carbonyl levels during UVB exposure in all the strains 

tested, as well as a reduction in ROS levels. High levels of intracellular manganese have 

also been shown to contribute for the resistance of bacteria to UVC radiation and 

ionizing radiation by mitigating protein oxidation (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., 2011; 

Granger et al., 2011). This protective effect results from the replacement of the iron 

present in the Fe-S clusters of enzymes by the Mn2+ ion, thereby preventing the 

formation of damaging hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction (Anjem et al., 

2009). Additionally, Mn2+ is also capable of forming complexes with metabolites which 

can scavenge superoxide, H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (Daly et al., 2010).  

Surprisingly, the protective effect of manganese against protein carbonylation 

and ROS levels was accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in survival 

during exposure to UVB, compared to non-amended controls and, in three of the strains 

tested, a significant increase in DNA damage levels. The reason for this detrimental 

effect is unclear in the face of current knowledge, but some speculations can be made. 

For example, the protective effect of Mn2+ is known to be dependent on the high 

expression of antioxidant enzymes, particularly catalase (Schellhorn et al., 1998), but 

CAT can be inactivated by UVB (Zigman et al., 1996). This could have contributed for 

the observed enhanced inactivation by UVB in the presence of manganese. On the other 

hand, it is possible that the Fe2+ that is displaced by Mn2+ in proteins could be able to 

participate in damage to DNA or lipids, thus overriding its protective effect against 

protein carbonylation. 

Taken together, these results indicate that the toxicity of reactive oxygen species 

generated during UV exposure is mediated by intracellular metals and that metal 

homeostasis is decisive in limiting the detrimental effects of ROS generated during 

UVB exposure in bacteria. The corollary following these observations is that enhanced 

metal concentration in the environment might increase the sensitivity of bacteria to 

UVB-induced damage. Accordingly, photoreactions on cell surfaces have been 

proposed to contribute to the biological damage caused by copper in polluted 

ecosystems (Hayase and Zepp, 1991). 



Chapter 12 

219 

Factors influencing UVB-induced inactivation and their mechanisms of interaction 

UV properties (wavelength, dose, mode of delivery), as well as environmental 

(temperature, salinity, nutrients) (Ogbebo and Ochs, 2008; Joux et al., 2009; Bullock 

and Jeffrey, 2010; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010) and biological (specific sensitivity, 

repair mechanisms, nutritional state, growth phase) (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-

Witschel et al., 2010) factors, influence the effects of UV exposure on bacteria. 

In the present work, the influence of different extrinsic and intrinsic factors on 

the photobiological responses of bacteria was also studied. 

Influence of nutrients and the suspension medium 

Properties associated with the medium in which bacterial cells are suspended for 

irradiations can influence their UV sensitivity by affecting bacterial physiology, 

photodynamic reactions and/or light penetration through the medium (Muela et al., 

2002; Steinberger et al., 2002; Arana et al., 2004). 

In the present work, the influence of nutrient concentration on the 

photobiological responses of bacteria was studied by inoculating bacterial assemblages 

of different origins (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) in water containing different 

nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content (high and low). UV-induced inhibition was 

generally attenuated upon inoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient 

medium, compared to unamended conditions. Repair processes elicited in response to 

UVR require nitrogen for synthesis of proteins involved in DNA repair and ROS 

scavenging, and thus can potentially be inhibited by a limitation in nitrogen supply. 

These repair processes are also energy-dependent, requiring ATP, and are consequently 

susceptible to limitation in the supply of phosphorus (Beardall et al., 2009). The results 

obtained indicate that nutrient amendment potentially attenuates UV-induced inhibition 

of bacteria by providing the elements required for synthesis of proteins, including those 

involved in repair of UV-induced damage. These observations are in accordance with 

previous work reporting the ability of nutrient inputs to promote recovery from UV-

induced damage in bacterioplankton (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Joux et al., 2009).  

The influence of the quality of the suspension medium on the UV-sensitivity 

responses of bacterial communities was studied by inoculating bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton samples of marine and brackish origin in cell-free water of different 

origin (surface and subsurface of marine and brackish origin). Their photobiological 



Chapter 12 

220 

responses in terms of culturable numbers and activity (leucine incorporation) were 

determined and compared to those observed upon inoculation in an artificial mineral 

solution (AMS).  

In general, inoculation of bacterial communities in SML and UW water 

attenuated the inhibitory effects of radiation, compared to those observed upon 

inoculation in AMS. The UV protective effect of inoculation of bacterial communities 

in SML and/or UW compared to the AMS treatment can be attributed to stimulation of 

bacterial metabolism by low molecular weight compounds resulting from the photolytic 

cleavage of DOM present in the natural samples (Amador et al., 1989; Bushaw et al., 

1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; Obernosterer et al., 1999) 

which could have compensated for the direct negative effects of irradiation. On the 

other hand, DOC present in the environmental samples can also exert a shield and 

quenching effect (Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005) that might have contributed 

to mitigate the detrimental effects of irradiation in samples diluted in SML and/or UW, 

compared to samples in AMS. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the media 

in which bacteria are suspended for irradiations influence the biological effects of UV 

radiation, thus pointing to the importance of the SML and UW abiotic environment in 

determining the UV responses of the corresponding bacterial communities. 

Influence of light dose and growth conditions 

In order to test the influence of growth conditions in UV-induced oxidative 

damage, a representative estuarine bacterial strain was grown to the mid-exponential, 

late-exponential or stationary phase at 15 ºC or 25 ºC under nutrient-rich (TSB) or 

nutrient-poor (M9 medium) conditions and irradiated up to a cumulative dose of 60 kJ 

m-2. Cell numbers and markers of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, protein 

carbonylation, DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links) during irradiation were 

monitored.  

In general, oxidative damage only followed a linear dose-dependence for low 

UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2), suggesting that oxidative damage levels during irradiation 

result from a dynamic interaction between damage induction and repair. Another 

possibility is that, at high UVB doses, there is a saturation of oxidative damage as a 

result of consecutive molecule excitation by high UV fluences, which gives rise to a 

complex, non-linear dependence of oxidative damage on the irradiation dose (Byeong et 

al., 2007). 



Chapter 12 

221 

Stationary phase cells generally survived better and showed lower levels of 

oxidative damage than exponential phase cells, particularly at low and intermediate 

UVB doses. Enhanced survival of stationary phase cells to several stress factors has 

been attributed to the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS or ?38, encoded by the 

rpoS gene, that is active in the stationary phase of many bacteria and induces a number 

of mechanisms that ensure resistance to environmental stress (Loewen and Hengge-

Aronis, 1994; Chen et al., 1996; Schellhorn et al., 1998; Hengge-Aronis, 1999).  

Mid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 ºC survived better to UVB exposure 

and showed lower levels of oxidative damage than cells grown at 25 ºC, particularly at 

low UVB doses. These results suggest a potential temperature effect on ROS generation 

and/or ROS interaction with the cellular targets. UV-induced DNA damage, assessed by 

CPD and/or 6-4 PP quantification, was previously found to be enhanced at higher 

temperatures (Takeuchi et al., 1996; Waterworth et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Matallana-

Surget et al., 2010). A possible influence of temperature on the conformational state of 

DNA (Li et al., 2002) and/or an indirect influence of temperature on DNA lesions, by 

affecting DNA-binding proteins (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010), could contribute for 

such a temperature trend. Furthermore, it is also possible that the chemical reactions 

involved in the interaction of ROS with their targets might be temperature-dependent 

(Li et al., 2002). The electron transport chain is a major source of ROS in the cell (Imlay 

and Fridovich, 1991; González-Flecha and Demple, 1995). It is possible that, by 

reducing oxygen consumption, lower temperatures might attenuate ROS production and 

the risk of oxidative damage (Borgeraas and Hessen, 2000).  

Cells cultivated in nutrient-rich TSB generally survived better to medium-high 

UVB doses (&gt; 10 kJ m-2) than those grown in nutrient-poor M9 medium. Nutrient-rich 

TSB, but not M9, could possibly have provided sufficient amounts of the chemical 

elements required for the synthesis of macromolecules necessary to withstand high 

UVB doses (e.g., enzymes involved in DNA repair and ROS scavenging), thus 

accounting for the enhanced UVB resistance of cells grown in TSB. These results are 

consistent with the enhanced UVB resistance of a set of bacterial isolates in nourished 

conditions, compared to their starved counterparts (Santos et al., 2012a), and enhanced 

UVB resistance of bacterioplankton and bacterioneuston upon amendment with high 

nutrient concentrations (Chapter 9). 



Chapter 12 

222 

These results reveal that growth conditions preceding irradiation are important 

determinants of survival and oxidative damage imposed by UVB exposure, potentially 

by affecting the temporal progression and the magnitude of biomolecule damage.  

 

The role of RecA as an indicator of UV repair potential 

The RecA protein is the primary regulator of dark repair mechanisms in bacteria 

(Miller and Kokjohn, 1990). Because the recA gene is itself regulated as part of the SOS 

gene expression system, measurement of the concentration of RecA protein in the cell 

allows monitoring of its repair capacity. Accordingly, RecA levels have been proposed 

as a barometer of the repair potential of bacterial isolates and communities in response 

to incident solar UV radiation (Booth et al., 2001a; Booth et al., 2001b). Transcriptomic 

and proteomics studies have supported the potential role of RecA as a biomarker of UV-

induced damage (Courcelle et al., 2001; Qiu et al., 2005a; Qiu et al., 2005b; Berney et 

al., 2006a; Moeller et al., 2007b; Matallana-Surget et al., 2012).  

Evidences suggest that structural or kinetic properties of RecA are also related to 

specific requirements of DNA damage repair systems in some species. For example, the 

RecA of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans and that of E. coli show 

differences in terms of orientation and composition of the C-terminal domain involved 

in binding double-stranded DNA (Rajan and Bell, 2004). These observations raise the 

hypothesis that the ability to cope with DNA damage, particularly that induced by UV 

radiation, during the life history of microorganisms could be reflected in RecA 

phylogeny and/or in the number of its gene copies in the genome. 

In the present work, it was investigated whether RecA phylogeny and recA 

frequency among fully sequenced genomes could reflect an adaptation to cope with UV-

induced damage. Phylogenetic analysis of the RecA protein was, in general, coherent 

with the phyla defined by 16S rRNA gene analysis, demonstrating the high degree of 

conservation of RecA resulting from its fundamental housekeeping role in bacteria. 

Duplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread among myxobacteria 

(Deltaproteobacteria) and some Firmicutes members. Earlier work by Karlin et al. 

(1995) suggested that the presence of two recA genes in the myxobacteria Myxococcus 

xanthus could provide higher amounts of the RecA repair protein that would allow this 

topsoil bacteria to withstand UV irradiation. However, our observations of the 

widespread duplication of recA in myxobacteria inhabiting various environments 



Chapter 12 

223 

suggest that UV radiation is not the only factor underlying the presence of additional 

copies of the recA gene. 

Duplication of the recA gene was also detected in several Firmicutes members. 

In Bacillus megaterium, both recA copies seem to be functional, and the second recA 

copy is known to complement the loss of recA1 in terms of UV sensitivity (Nahrstedt et 

al., 2005). The authors suggested that a greater amount of RecA might increase the 

capacity of the cell for recombinational repair. Whether this is applicable to the other 

Firmicutes members in which recA duplication was observed, is unknown.  

Several new cases of plasmids encoding the recA gene that had not been 

previously reported in the literature were also identified by database mining. The 

presence of two recA (recAP1 and recAP3) in two different plasmids in Deinococcus 

deserti, in addition to the chromosomal recA, was proposed to provide higher levels of 

RecA protein for efficient error-free repair of DNA damage (Dulermo et al., 2009). In 

the present work, in some of the plasmids the presence of a gene coding for DNA 

polymerase V subunit, which performs translesion DNA synthesis during the SOS 

response, immediately after the recA gene was observed. This could suggest that the 

plasmid-encoded recA copy might fulfil a role in complementing the chromosomal recA 

in the SOS response, including during the response to UV exposure. However, further 

studies are necessary to clarify whether the newly detected plasmid-encoded RecA 

proteins are actually functional and can, in fact, complement the chromosomal RecA in 

the SOS response.

CHAPTER 13 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

 

The results of this thesis indicate that: 

- The light history of bacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity. 

Results from community assays comparing the responses of bacterioneuston and 

bacterioplankton to UVB radiation revealed that bacterial abundance and DNA 

synthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton, while protein synthesis was 

more inhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB exposure seemed to select for UV-

resistant Gammaproteobacteria, particularly abundant in bacterioneuston. 

Enhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to UVB radiation, in terms of 

abundance, was confirmed in investigations conducted with isolated bacterial 

strains. Furthermore, UVB irradiation was also found to be accompanied by a 

shift in sole-carbon source use profiles in bacterial isolates. Recovery from 

UVB-induced stress was enhanced in bacterioneuston, particularly under 

nutrient-depleted conditions. These results suggest that bacterioneuston may 

contain a pool of UV-resistant strains that, under appropriate meteorological 

conditions, may be selected upon UV exposure.  

- DNA damage, oxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels 

account for bacterial inactivation under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths. 

Using a combination of several UV-sensitivity tests and their statistical analysis, 

applied to a range of bacteria, new information regarding the process of UV-

based inactivation was gained. Mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed an array of 

modifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria following irradiation. These 

results provide new insights into the targets of different UV wavelengths in 

bacterial cells, as well as clues to the underlying common mechanisms involved 

in the inactivation of different bacteria. This information can contribute for a 

better understanding of the environmental effects of UV radiation and allow the 

optimization of UV-based disinfection strategies. 

- Singlet oxygen is pivotal in UVB-induced cell inactivation. Using specific 

ROS scavengers, singlet oxygen was also found to be important in lipid 

peroxidation. The hydroxyl radical was found to participate in DNA strand 

breakage and protein carbonylation, while the impairment of glucose 



Chapter 13 

226 

incorporation and respiration during UVB exposure had a contribution of 

hydrogen peroxide and superoxide.  

- Metal amendment, particularly iron, copper and manganese, enhances 

bacterial inactivation during UVB exposure. Amendment with iron 

exacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation during 

irradiation. Copper and cobalt also enhanced lipid peroxidation. Despite 

attenuating the formation of protein carbonyls during irradiation, manganese 

amendment decreased bacterial survival. These results indicate that iron, copper, 

cobalt and manganese play a role in UVB-induced inactivation and that metal 

homeostasis is crucial in limiting the detrimental effects of ROS generated 

during UVB exposure. 

- The abiotic environment (nutrient content and quality of the suspension 

medium) influences the UVB sensitivity of bacterial communities. In general, 

inoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient medium attenuated UVB-

induced inhibition of abundance and activity, compared to unamended 

conditions. Suspension in natural water resulted in less pronounced inhibitory 

effects of UVB exposure, compared to suspensions prepared in an artificial 

mineral solution. 

- Growth conditions preceding irradiation are crucial to the extent of the 

oxidative damage induced by UVB exposure. In general, stationary phase 

cells survived better and showed lower levels of protein carbonyls than 

exponential phase cells. Oxidative damage to biomolecules was generally higher 

at 25 ºC than at 15 ºC, particularly in mid-exponential phase cells, pointing to a 

temperature effect on ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with the cellular 

targets. Growth conditions seemed to affect UVB sensitivity by influencing the 

temporal progression and the magnitude of the damage to biomolecules. 

- RecA phylogeny reflects the high degree of conservation of the protein, 

rather than particular adaptations to withstand stressful conditions. 

Duplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread in myxobacteria and 

also frequent among Firmicutes. Several plasmids containing recA homologs not 

yet reported in the literature were identified. Gene context analysis suggested 

that plasmid-encoded recA genes could complement the activity of 

chromosome-encoded recA genes in the bacterial SOS response.
