Scientific Note

The more stirring the better: cichlid fishes associate with foraging

potamotrygonid rays

Domingos Garrone-Neto1 and Ivan Sazima2,3

One hunting tactic of freshwater rays (Potamotrygonidae), termed “undulate the disc and stir substrate”, is here reported to
attract cichlids at two sites in the upper Paraná River. The ray species involved in such association are Potamotrygon falkneri
and P. motoro, whose activity attract four cichlid species, namely Crenicichla britskii, Satanoperca pappaterra, Cichla
kelberi, and Geophagus proximus, the two latter non-native species to the study area. The cichlids approach a ray when it
begins to stir the substrate and form sediment clouds, and remain close to the ray during this activity only. The association is
here regarded as following behavior even if very transient.

Uma tática de caça das raias de água doce (Potamotrygonidae), chamada de “ondular o disco e agitar o substrato”, é aqui
relatada como atrativa para Cichlidae em dois locais da bacia do alto rio Paraná. As espécies de raias envolvidas nesta
associação são Potamotrygon falkneri e P. motoro, cuja atividade atrai quatro espécies de ciclídeos, Crenicichla britskii,
Satanoperca pappaterra, Cichla kelberi e Geophagus proximus, as duas últimas exóticas à área de estudo. Os ciclídeos se
aproximam de uma raia quando esta começa a remexer o substrato e formar nuvens de sedimento, e permanecem na proximidade
da raia apenas durante esta atividade. A associação é aqui considerada como comportamento de seguir, ainda que transitório.

Several fish species that feed on benthic preys often
associate with substrate-disturbing, generally larger fish
species. So called following association comprise a fish or a
fish group that excavate or otherwise disturb the substrate
while foraging, and one or more opportunistic species that
capitalize on the small animals and other food types displaced
by the foraging activity of the former (Strand, 1988; Lukoschek
&amp;amp; McCormick, 2000). This association is a well-known one in
the marine environment (see Strand, 1988; Sazima et al., 2007
for overviews), although a few instances are reported from
freshwater habitats as well (e.g., Sazima, 1986; Baker &amp;amp; Foster,
1994; Leitão et al., 2007; Teresa &amp;amp; Carvalho, 2008).

Several species of rays (particularly of the Myliobatoidei)
forage with use of a tactic we termed “undulate the disc and
stir substrate”, as illustrated by species of the freshwater

Potamotrygonidae (Garrone-Neto &amp;amp; Sazima, 2009). Here we
report on four cichlid species attracted to the stirring by two
Potamotrygon species at two sites in the upper rio Paraná,
Southwestern Brazil.

The study sites are in the vicinity of Campinal, SP (about
21°32’S 52°03’W) and Três Lagoas, MS (about 20°47’S
51°37’W) on the border of São Paulo and Mato Grosso do
Sul, Southeastern Brazil. The association and the behavior of
the fishes were recorded underwater while snorkeling or
scuba-diving (Sabino, 1999) at day and night hours in the
middle of the dry season in August and at the onset of the
rainy season in November 2007 and 2008. A total of 84 h of
underwater observations was made through the study, most
of them with snorkeling (78 h at depths of 0.5 to 12 m) and the
remainder time with scuba-diving (6 h at depths of 8-18 m).



Cichlid fishes associate with foraging potamotrygonid rays500

“Ad libitum” and “behaviour” sampling rules (Martin &amp;amp;
Bateson, 1986) were used throughout the observational
sessions, mostly recorded on a plastic slate (Garrone-Neto &amp;amp;
Sazima, 2009). Size estimates (total length TL for the cichlids,
and disc width DW for the rays) were calibrated against actual
specimens or objects of known size.

The beginning of association may be conveniently
exemplified by a ray stirring the unconsolidated (loose)
substrate to uncover small invertebrates such as insect larvae,
crabs, and snails. This activity stirs the substrate particles
and discrete sediment clouds are formed near the foraging
ray (Fig. 1). These clouds apparently catch the attention of
nearby cichlids that approach the ray and feed on small preys
and other food types exposed this way (Fig. 2). Clouds of
sand and other sediment types are one of the most important
visual cues for followers to approach a substrate-disturbing
fish (e.g., Fricke, 1975; Fishelson, 1977; Sazima et al., 2006;
Leitão et al., 2007).

Cichlids were attracted to foraging activity of P. falkneri (n
= 6) and P. motoro (n = 1). We recorded four cichlid species
attracted to rays, namely Crenicichla britskii, Satanoperca

food types such as plant debris (see Sazima, 1986 for S.
pappaterra). The duration of the association varied 8-1,320 sec
(x = 12,1; sd = 4,94; N = 7). While close to the ray, the cichlids
were unusually wary and do not allowed close approach of the
observer (this behavior also precluded photographs). No
cichlid or any other fish was recorded close to rays foraging at
night. From a total of 42 recorded instances of rays’ foraging
over unconsolidated bottoms, association with cichlids was
recorded for only seven (17%) of these. Thus, the association
may be regarded as rare, possibly related to the recent
colonization of the upper Paraná River by potamotrygonid rays
(Garrone-Neto et al., 2007; Garrone-Neto, 2009).

Although the cichlids only approached the ray while it
was already stirring the substrate, the association is here
regarded as following behavior even if a very transient one
(see Sazima et al., 2007; Leitão et al., 2007; Teresa &amp;amp; Carvalho,
2008). The association between cichlids and rays was recorded
in still water (marginal ponds and dammed river portions),
which favors sediment deposition. This latter, in turn, favors
“cloud” formation during foraging by rays and attracts
zoobenthivorous and opportunistic cichlids. No association

Fig. 2. Association between a foraging freshwater ray
(Potamotrygon falkneri) and two species of cichlid fishes
(Crenicichla britskii on the left and Geophagus proximus
on the right). The ray settles close to the bottom, begins to
undulate the disc and stir the substrate, which cause the
cichlid to approach (a); as the ray proceeds foraging and
forms a fine sediment cloud, the cichlids hover head-down
close to the disc and watches potential prey to be uncovered
by the ray’s movements (b).

pappaterra, Cichla kelberi and Geophagus proximus, the two
latter non-native species introduced about a decade ago in the
upper Paraná River for fishery purposes (Graça &amp;amp; Pavanelli,
2007). From these, the species most commonly recorded
associated with a ray were C. britskii (n = 3), Geophagus
proximus (n = 2), and C. kelberi (n = 2). The cichlids’ sizes
varied from about 6 cm TL (C. britskii, G. proximus, and S.
pappaterra) to about 14 cm (C. kelberi), and the rays’ sizes
varied from 32 to 45 cm DW. Thus, in most instances both the
rays and the cichlids were juveniles.

Up to four individuals of two cichlid species were attracted
to a single ray (Fig. 2). Once close to a foraging ray (Fig. 2a),
the cichlids hovered head-down near the ray’s undulating disc
(Fig. 2b), watched intently and lunged forwards to snatch
disturbed small prey (mostly larval aquatic insects) and other

was ever recorded for rays hunting in flowing water.
It is noteworthy that no characid species was recorded

close to foraging rays, as tetras are opportunistic foragers
and a few species are already reported as followers of
substrate-disturbing fishes (Sazima, 1986; Teresa &amp;amp; Carvalho,
2008). Although not much probable, one explanation could
be that the rays prey occasionally on small characids
(Lonardoni et al., 2006; Garrone-Neto, 2009). However, further
field studies may disclose additional associations of fishes
other than cichlids and even other aquatic animals with
foraging freshwater rays.
