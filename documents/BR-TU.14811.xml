Agradecimentos 
 

Esta tese é o culminar de uma etapa que se iniciou quando em Agosto de 2006 embarquei rumo a 
Aracajú, a capital do Estado de Sergipe na Bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas. Nessa altura não poderia 
imaginar o quão importante aquele momento seria para os anos seguintes – talvez porque nunca 
antes tivesse ouvido falar de Aracajú ou da Bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas. No entanto esse momento 
foi decisivo e o Brasil, em particular a Bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas, fizeram parte da minha vida diária 
nos anos que se seguiram. Durante este tempo várias pessoas contribuíram directa ou 
indirectamente para esta conquista. Tentando não esquecer ninguém, os meus agradecimentos: 
 
Ao meu orientador, Duncan Lockhart sem o qual esta tese concerteza não seria a mesma. Não há 
palavras que descrevam a minha gratidão por me ter ensinado, corrigido e guiado ao longo deste 
tempo. Melhor era impossível. Muito obrigado! 
 
Ao meu orientador, Prof. Luís Menezes Pinheiro por todas as ideias que apresentou para o 
enriquecimento deste trabalho, pela disponibilidade, e pela enorme paciência em ler e reler todo 
o trabalho. A sua ajuda foi crucial para levar este projecto a bom porto. 
 
Ao Exploration Manager da GALP Exploração, Roland Muggli, por ter depositado em mim a sua 
confiança e me ter apoiado em todos os momentos.  
 
Aos colegas da UNL, U. Aveiro e UALG (Filipa, Leonardo, Hugo, Prof. José António Almeida, Prof. 
Carlos Kullberg, Prof. Conceição Neves), cujo trabalho foi a base desta tese. 
 
Ao Dr. Rui Baptista por me ter dado a oportunidade de entrar para o desafiante mundo que é a 
indústria petrolífera e para a GALP Energia, quando em 2006 me convenceu a aceitar a bolsa de 
estudo, que me levou até Sergipe.   
 
Ao João Afonso. O wingman, o irmão (“vocês são irmãos?”), que embarcou comigo nesta 
aventura brasileira e que me entende como muito poucos, mesmo em silêncio e à distância.  
 
À Carolina por existir perto de mim e ser o fiel da balança. 
 
Aos colegas da GALP Exploração &amp;amp; Produção com quem todos os dias partilho o espaço e que são, 
sem dúvida, uma espectacular equipa de trabalho. Não nomeio ninguém em particular pois todos 
contribuíram para que esta tese visse a luz do dia.  
 
A todos na Petrogal Brasil, em particular ao Carlão, ao Manuel Peres, ao Torres, ao Cohen, ao 
Flávio e ao Allyson com quem passei muitas horas e muitos dias na DF-02 e 06 e sempre me 
fizeram sentir como parte da equipa, ensinando-me quase tudo o que hoje sei sobre 
geologia/engenharia de sonda e tantas outras coisas que me fizeram crescer. Ao Kléber, ao 
Alcimar e à Dulce Cid.  
 
Ao João Antunes e à Vera Lourenço. A comida, o calor, o pó e a lama, as mutucas, o barulho e as 
noites mal dormidas, são tudo parte da experiência que passámos juntos, que tenho a certeza 
nunca esqueceremos e de que, quem sabe, um dia até teremos saudades. 
 
Ao Douglas, o verdadeiro Master Yoda, e ao Carlos Gonçalves, um professor sempre disposto a 
ajudar. Talvez agora o Outlook tenha descanso…  
 



Ao Professor Antônio Garcia, por ter acolhido da melhor forma em Aracajú um jovem 
inexperiente e apreensivo, e por ter sido um professor e amigo em doses certas.  
 
Ao Dr. João Pacheco pelo exemplo de vida e pelos conselhos. É assim que quero ser quando 
crescer.   
 
Às equipas da Drillfor-02, que me mostraram o que é ter uma vida dura e ainda assim saber rir e 
ser feliz; e à equipa da CWA com quem passei muitas horas nos vários poços: Leonardo, Samir, 
Jetro, Allany, Tales, Leandro e muitos outros que nunca deixaram perder uma amostra de calha 
ou passar um indício de hidrocarboneto.  
 
À galera do Brasil. Aos amigos da UFS, que acolheram “o Portuga” e me fizeram sentir 
verdadeiramente em casa: Bero, Luana, Jamyle, Aline, Bira, Laiany, Pel, Ulisses, Humberto. Um 
obrigado especial à minha amiga de sempre e à sua família, Shauane. Ao colega Cristiano Rancan, 
um geólogo brilhante cujo entusiasmo todos contagiava. Às Julianas que me ensinaram a gostar 
de Recife, visse!  
 
Aos que tiveram paciência para me ouvir falar incessantemente deste trabalho nos últimos meses, 
compreenderam a minha ausência em muitas ocasiões, e me apoiaram. Os amigos: Gonçalo, Levi, 
Bernardo, Pedro, JP, B. Cunha, Rita T., Pudinzinho, Firmino. E a família: Tia Lélé, Tia Mimi, Avó 
Emilia, Avó Maria, Leonor. 
 
Aos que partiram mas que tenho a certeza sentiriam orgulho nas minhas pequenas conquistas: 
Chico, Artur e Carlos. 
 
Finalmente, aos meus pais que me incutiram o gosto pela geologia e pelo conhecimento. 
Ensinaram-me a questionar o mundo, a pensar e a viver, e apoiaram-me incondicionalmente 
mesmo quando as minhas escolhas me enviaram para longe. São o meu maior orgulho.  
 

 



Resumo 
 
A bacia onshore de Sergipe-Alagoas, onde a GALP Energia detém dois blocos exploratórios, possui 
um exemplo provado de um Reservatório Naturalmente Fracturado no soco cristalino 
(Embasamento na terminologia brasileira utilizada nesta tese). Nestes blocos, sete poços verticais 
foram completados com sucesso, e em todos, o Embasamento Fracturado (cujas características 
foram provadas através do uso da ferramenta de imagem – Formation Micro Imager ou FMI – e 
de testes a poço aberto – Drill Stem Tests ou DST) foi o intervalo que apresentou os melhores 
resultados.  
Nesta tese, foi feita uma análise extensiva da estratégia exploratória, desde a aquisição sísmica 
aos resultados e procedimentos dos poços, e uma Estratégia de Exploração alternativa foi 
apresentada como conclusão. Esta análise integrou dados provenientes dos sete poços realizados 
com dados do Projecto de Modelação do Embasamento Fracturado (uma parceria entre GALP e 
uma equipa composta por elementos da Universidade de Aveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 
Universidade do Algarve e Instituto Superior Técnico). Neste projecto as equipas utilizaram dados 
sísmicos (planos de falhas interpretados manualmente) e dados de FMI (a partir dos quais as 
principais orientações de fracturação foram extraídas) para simular um elemento geométrico 
correspondente ao Embasamento. A essa rede foram aplicados princípios de geomecânica 
juntamente com modelação DFN (Density Fracture Network), permitindo simular a 
permeabilidade de fractura para cada uma das famílias extraídas dos dados de FMI. Estes dados 
permitiram ao autor calcular o volume de hidrocarbonetos presentes e simular um poço 
direccional para ser que deverá ser efectuado em alternativa os poços verticais perfurados até 
agora.

This thesis is the closure of a stage that began when; in August 2006 I embarked towards Aracajú, 
the capital of Sergipe State in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, Brazil. At that time, I was far from imagining 
how important that moment would be for the following years – maybe because ever before I had 
heard about Aracajú or the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. However, that moment was decisive, and 
Brasil, and in particular this Basin, were part of my daily life in the years that followed. During this 
time several people directly or indirectly contributed to this achievement. Trying not to forget 
anyone, I thank to:

when my choices took me to distant places. You are my greatest pride. 

 

 

 



Abstract 
 
The Sergipe-Alagoas, onshore Basin, where GALP Energia holds two exploration blocks, has an 
example of a proven Naturally Fractured Basement Reservoir. In these blocks seven vertical wells 
were successfully drilled, and in all seven, fractured Basement (which was proven by the use of 
Formation Micro Imaging – FMI – tool and the results of the Drill Stem Tests - DST) presented the 
best results.  
In this thesis an extensive analysis of the exploration strategy, ranging from seismic acquisition to 
drilling /testing results and procedures, was made, and an alternative Exploration Workflow was 
presented as a conclusion. This analysis integrated data from the study of the drilling and testing 
procedures, with data from the Fractured Basement Project (a joint project with Universidade de 
Aveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior Técnico). In 
this project the team used seismic data (mainly interpreted fault surfaces) and FMI data (from 
which fracture families were extracted), and by applying geomechanical principles together with 
Density Fracture Network (DFN) modelling created permeability maps per fracture family. This 
allowed the author to calculate the Hydrocarbons Initially in Place (HIIP) and simulate a 
directional well to be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells drilled so far.   

 

key-words: Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, basement, fractures, Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, 
Drill Stem Test, Formation Micro Imager, whole-core Ant-Tracking, seismic attributes,

Figure 4-1: Proposed workflow for the present study. Inside the green squares are the key

points of the workflow: the identification of the fracture system properties, the well design,

well results and Pre and Post-Drill volumes calculation. This method involves several sources of

information, gathered at different times during the Exploration process. 

It is first important to assess if there is the possibility of the presence of fractures. If it is, then

the geologist should understand the Fracture System properties. To do that, he can use old

well data, outcrop data, regional geology, and if available, seismic. Old well data and outcrop

analysis will give information on the lithology, orientation of fracture patterns and on rock

mechanical properties, which will allow the geologist to derive the Fracture Properties

Affecting Reservoir Performance and how Fractures and Matrix Interact. Regional geology in

its turn will supply the regional tectonic regimes and the structural setting of the area, which

allows for the classification of the Fracture System Origin. Together, data from these three

sources will constrain the Geomechanical Models that allow the creation of DFN models to

simulate the Fracture System Properties (fracture and permeability distribution) leading

ultimately to the classification of the Reservoir Type. If seismic is not available in the first

phase, the analysis of the other data can help on the decision on whether it should or not be acquired and on the parameters to do so. 

Notice that emphasis is also given on processing, as complex settings as NFR’s (especially in

Basement contexts) require special processing steps. All these have the ultimate objective of

finding a suitable well location. Prior to drilling there is the need of calculating HC volumes in

place. This will be based on the properties simulated by the models, and using parameters

given by the previous analysis. Well design will be subjected to the fracture system properties

(orientation and permeability distribution), in terms of orientation as in most cases NFR’s wells

are drilled directional and underbalanced. The evaluation of the wells will give more

information about the reservoir properties and consequently help readjusting the models

previously created as well as accessing Post-Drill Volumetrics. This is an iterative workflow.

consists of four vertically aligned fractures (left) and for model that consists of seven vertically

the received waveforms is significantly reduced and there is also a shift in the peak amplitude

towards lower frequency. Source: Sugiri, O. I. (2010).

Figure 4-16: Diagram (A) and formula (B) of Darcy’s Law (1856) which states that the total

discharge,  Q (units of volume per time, e.g., m
3
/s) is equal to the product of

the permeability of the medium,  k (m
2
), the cross-sectional area to flow, A  (units of area,

e.g., m
2
), and the pressure drop (Pb-Pa), all divided by the viscosity, ?  (Pa.s) and the length

the pressure drop is taking place over. The negative sign in k  is essential because fluids flow

from high pressure to low pressure. So if the change in pressure is negative (where Pa &gt; Pb ) 

then the flow will be in the positive 'x' direction.

permeability of the fracture plus intact rock system, k fr (A) and equation for permeability of a

parallel plates, that fluid flow across any fracture/matrix surface does not alter the flow of

either system, and that the fractures are homogeneous with respect to orientation, width, and

spacing. Where: e = distance between plates or aperture (mm, cm, etc.); D= fracture distance,

probable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large area.

Two different sections divided by a very visible spike in transit time at around 1025m, can be

identified in the sonic log within the Basement (Figure 6-62) like in Echo well. The spike is also

noticeable in the NPorosity and Density logs, and Resistivity also responds differently in the

upper and lower section of the basement. The continuous registration of this spike reinforces

the hypothesis of it being a transition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-

altered lower Basement, than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no probable that an isolated

fracture extends for such a large area.

149

Figure 6-62: As in Echo Well, each of the two individualized areas in Fox well (red and green)

as evidenced by the increase in back-pressure during the flow periods and by the rapid 

increase in pressure. The pressure was tending to stabilize in the second build-Up period. The 

very strong blows and the sampled oil cut with gas are consistent with this analysis. Also 

shows the well was highly overbalanced.

Figure 6-70: Again in Golf Well, each of the individualized areas (red, and green) have different

average transit times and corresponding responses of the sonic and density logs. There is also

a sonic spike at around 1035m (not as clear as in other wells) similar to what was registered in

Charlie, Echo and Fox wells. The continuous registration of this spike reinforces the hypothesis

of it being a transition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower

Basement, rather than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no probable that an isolated fracture

extends for such a large area.

158

Figure 6-71: Golf well DST-01 pressure plot. With only one cycle and a very little volume of oil

produced (which is not stated in the reports) it is not possible to make any conclusions on the

reservoir pressures or permeability, even tough the pressure stabilized very quicly. Having

tested a very large extension of well, including two different formations, with very different

lithological properties, doesn’t help to evaluation. Only the fact that a very strong gas blow,

with a 5m flame, was registered at surface allows the interpretation that this is a good

reservoir. Even though no conclusions can be taken on the specific interval that should be

considered for future production.

Figure 6-85: Predicted small-scale discontinuities density distribution in the SEAL-T-A block for:

(A) N30W and (B) N40E normal faulting regimes. Cold coloured (blue, green) zones represent

regions of low discontinuities density and hot coloured (yellow to red) zones regions of

enhanced discontinuities density. Low densities occur along and sideways of large faults and

high densities at their tips. The linkage of large-scale faults by small scale fracturing is favoured

at particular locations, which depend on the faulting regime. (C) Predicted discontinuities

density distribution in the T-412-429 block for the N30W/E-W strike-slip faulting regime. The

predicted density of small-scale transfer faults is much higher than the predicted density of

small-scale normal faults (in figure 5.8). The clusters of predicted transfer faults are also more

widely distributed in these regimes. The dominant trends of the most intense fault clustering

(red regions) follow approximately the N10° and N120° azimuths. Source: UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp;

ones in SEAL-T-A block. (C) Predicted discontinuities density distribution in the for the E-

Table 4-4: Examples of producing oil and gas fields by reservoir type. Notice that the

largest reserves stand in Type 3 reservoirs that account for some of the largest fields in

the world. Fractures here give the voluminous flow rates, which make these fields so

economic (flow rates often in excess of 100,000 barrels of oil per day [BOPD]). Type 2

reservoirs have also large reserves when compared to Type 1, which reflects the larger

storage volume associated with matrix porosity (up to 20–30 percent in the matrix as

opposed to up to 1–2 percent in the fractures). The smallest volumes of HC are

encountered in Type 1 reservoirs, being the largest known field of this type, the Amal field

in Lybia. Here the reserves are substantial due to its large thickness and very large aerial

extent (100,000 acres, 800 ft. thick), as the fracture porosity is close to 1.7% and the

matrix has no porosity. Adapted from Nelson,2001.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Basement rocks (any metamorphic or igneous rocks, regardless of age, which are unconformably 

overlain by a sedimentary sequence) are not usually seen by the oil industry as having the 

capacity to hold hydrocarbons (HC) in sufficient quantity to be considered a profitable reservoir. 

Their lithological characteristics, with matrix porosity usually close to zero (or inexistent) causes 

storage space to be given only by fractures, placing Basement reservoirs in the category of 

Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, having for that reason very specific exploration strategies (full 

diameter coring, directional and underbalanced drilling as well as detailed geological field studies 

are crucial) . All this leads most to exploration wells reaching their total depth (TD) when the 

basement rock is intersected, hence not fully evaluating the basement potential for HC storage. 

This procedure is common despite many successful examples of Basement reservoirs around the 

world, of which Bach Ho field in Vietnam, Mara Field in Venezuela and Habban Field in Yemen, are 

probably the most prominent.   

 

The Sergipe-Alagoas, onshore Basin, where GALP Energia holds two exploration blocks, has an 

example of a proven Naturally Fractured Basement Reservoir. In these blocks seven vertical wells 

were successfully drilled, and in all seven, fractured Basement (which was proven by the use of 

the Formation Micro Imaging – FMI – tool and the results of the Drill Stem Tests - DST) presented 

the best results.  

In this thesis an extensive analysis of the exploration strategy, ranging from seismic acquisition to 

drilling /testing results and procedures, was made, and an alternative Exploration Workflow was 

presented as a conclusion. This analysis integrated data from the study of the drilling and testing 

procedures, with data from the Fractured Basement Project (a joint project with Universidade de 

Aveiro, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior Técnico). In 

this project the team used seismic data (mainly interpreted fault surfaces) and FMI data (from 

which fracture families were extracted), and by applying geomechanical principles together with 

Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modelling created permeability maps per fracture family. This 

allowed the author to calculate the Hydrocarbons Initially in Place (HIIP) and simulate a 

directional well to be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells drilled so far.

In the alternative Exploration Workflow, this author recommends that the following exploration 

procedures should be executed in the future:  

- Detailed geological field studies over the Basement outcrops that are present in the Basin, 

in order to better understand the fracture system.  

- Wide-Azimuth Seismic acquisition.  

- Pre-stack seismic processing with detailed velocity analysis. 

- Full-diameter cores to be taken from at least one well. 

- Drill-Stem Tests to be executed equally in all the wells. Testing the same intervals and 

having the same mechanical procedures is crucial to understand how the fracture system 

behaves during production. 

- Image logs to be run equally in all the wells and to TD.  

 

If the option of drilling another exploration well is taken, then this thesis demonstrates that it 

should be drilled aiming for a specific family of fractures (Family A), which was ranked as the best 

fracture family in terms of density, permeability and porosity relative to two other families 

(Family B and B1). This well should have a 30º inclination and should be drilled in the direction of 

the 240º azimuth in order to perpendicularly intersect the N22ºW/60ºNE Family A fractures. 

Underbalanced drilling should be considered as a valid option as it became proven by the 

economic simulation, where the increment in cost for drilling a directional and underbalanced 

well was not significant (close to $600K). The benefits of using such techniques are proven by 

worldwide analogues, such as Ninotsiminda Field, where a directional well drilled in 2003 

increased daily production by as much as ten times; or by the more than 100 successfully drilled  

underbalanced wells in Canada (Lunan, B, 1995). 

 

The lack of accurate data (no geological field studies, no coring data and vertical wells mean that 

the fracture system is not fully evaluated) may be considered as a handicap in the way that the 

SEAL Fractured Basement was evaluated, and consequently a weakness of the Workflow. Even 

tough, and considering that to the present a considerable amount of funds have been spent 

without relevant results, this author believes that this methodology will allow for an optimisation 

of procedures, with the equation cost vs. results to be favourable to GALP.

2. THE SERGIPE ALAGOAS BASIN 

 

2. 1 INTRODUCTION 

The Sergipe-Alagoas Basin (SEAL) (Figure 2-1), is located in the north-eastern coast of Brazil 

between the parallels 11 and 9.30. Its onshore part corresponds to a narrow band of about 35 km 

wide, stretching for about 350 km in the direction N45ºE. The boundary of the basin to the sea is 

not well defined, but it certainly extends beyond the isobathic line of 2000 m, corresponding to an 

approximate area of 45,960 km
2
, of which around 13.200 km

2

The SEAL basin is one of the sedimentary basins along the Brazilian coast, formed during the 

opening of the South Atlantic in the late Jurassic and Cretaceous, crossing various tectonic 

compartments of the Pre-Cambrian basement. Much of this basement belongs to the Province

Borborema (Almeida et.al.1977), represented in the basin by the Sergipe Fold Belt and the 

Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif, which will be presented in detail ahead. 

This basin presents the most complete stratigraphic sequence of all of the Brazilian Eastern 

Margin Basins (Figure 2-2), with 5 sequences, mostly separated by regional unconformities.

Figure 2-2: Sergipe Sub-basin Litho-stratigraphic Column (Campos Neto et al., 2007).  

 

Structurally, the basin is a half graben dipping to SE (Figure 2-3), and can be divided into four sub-

basins: sub-basins of Jacuípe, Sergipe, Alagoas and the Cape sub-basin, with different histories 

and distinct tectono-sedimentary infills. The Rio Real River high separates the sub-basin of Sergipe 

from Jacuípe sub-basin. The sub-basins of Sergipe and Alagoas are separated by Japoatã and 

Penedo highs, along the São Francisco River, while the Maragogi high separates the Alagoas sub-

basin from the Cape sub-basin (formerly considered the southern portion of Pernambuco-Paraíba 

basin). 

 

 

 

2.2 TECTONOSTRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCES 

For locating the following stages and corresponding sedimentary in the stratigraphic record, 

please refer to Figure 2-2. 

Stage I: this stage is represented by sediments that were deposited in large depressions 

associated with intracratonic basins.  These depressions that extended from West Africa to NE 

Brazil, allowed the preservation of part of the Paleozoic sedimentary record. In the SEAL basin the 

Aracaré Fm. (desert, deltaic and shallow marine Permian sediments) and the Batinga Fm. (glacial, 

alluvial-deltaic Carboniferous sediments) are examples of such depositional systems. 

 

Stage II (Pré-Rift): This stage, which occurred from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, is 

characterized by crustal doming as a response to the heating caused by hotspots presence in the 

central Gondwana. This doming created a series of shallow peripheral depressions that were filled

by continental deposits such as red-beds, in fluvial-lacustrine and eolian environments, during 

Tithonian times. The Candeeiro Fm. (fluvial sandstones), Bananeiras Fm.  (lacustrine red-beds), 

and Serraria Fm. (fluvial sandstones), are the examples of such depositional conditions.

Stage III (Rift): The evolution of the continental break-up was conditioned by the predominant 

structural directions in the cratons and fold belts that formed the Basement of the newly formed 

sedimentary basins. Thus, from the most southern margin to the region of the Camamu basin, the 

break-up was influenced mainly by the lineaments inherited from the Brasilian Orogeny (late 

Proterozoic), of NE-SW orientation, and  created a long and narrow rift. In the region of the SEAL 

basin these structural lineaments - of which the Pernambuco lineament is a good example - were 

perpendicular to the later. This caused the subsidence to be much slower than the adjacent 

regions, limiting the crustal extension, and causing this region to be one of the last to detach from 

Africa – while the rifting was already happening in Berriasian/Valanginian in the southern areas, it 

only occurred in the Albian, in the equatorial basins.  

The predominant sedimentary processes were of siliciclastic origin in several depositional 

environments: alluvial, fluvial, deltaic and lacustrine. These were controlled by the normal faults 

that bordered the basin. At the base of the Rift sequence and deposited during the Valanginian 

are the deltaic-lacustrine shales with interbedded sandstones of the Feliz Deserto Fm. This 

interval is limited at the top by the Pre-Aratu unconformity.  

From the Pre-Aratu unconformity to the end of the Rift stage, the alluvial/fluvial conglomerates of 

the Rio Pitanga Fm. were deposited in the proximal areas of the basin. Distally, however, two 

different intervals can be defined. From Hauterivian to Barremian times, the Rio Pitanga Fm. 

grades laterally to the alluvial/fluvial sandstones of the Penedo Fm., and the lacustrine/deltaic 

shales with interbedded sandstones of the Barra Itiúba Fm. From Barremian to Aptian times the 

Rio Pitanga Fm. grades laterally to the Morro do Chaves Fm. coquinas, and the alluvial-deltaic and 

lacustrine sandstones and shales of the Coqueiro Seco Fm. At the top of the sequence, the Rio 

Pitanga Fm. grades laterally to the lacustrine-deltaic shales and sandstones of the Maceió Fm. 

 

Stage IV (Transitional):  the separation between the South American and African plates, allowed 

the intermittent entrance of sea water in the elongated gulf created during the rift stage. This 

event marks the beginning of the Transitional stage, and started between the Aptian and the 

Cenomanian depending on the location.   

The influx of sea water was controlled by a transversal structural feature between South America 

and Africa – the Rio-Grande Walvis Sea mounts chain – which worked has a barrier for the water 

circulation between the proto-ocean that was forming and the Austral Atlantic already developed 

(Figure 2-4). This controlled water influx plus the high evaporation rates – these events were

happening at a particularly warm climate and near the equator – contributed for the 

accumulation of evaporites in the gulf.   

This stage is represented by the Muribeca Fm. that has three Members:  

- The basal alluvial-fluvial and deltaic siliciclastics of the Carmópolis Mb., which correspond to 

a Lowstand and Transgressive System Tracts (LST and TST) and were deposited over the Pre-

Muribeca unconformity.  

- The shallow marine evaporites, microbial carbonates and shales of the Ibura Mb., deposited 

over the Carmópolis siliciclastics corresponding to a Highstand System Tract.  

- The carbonates and shales of the Oiteirinhos Mb. that were deposited at the top of the 

sequence in the Highstand System Tract.

of Rio Grande- Walvis sea mounts that conditioned the sedimentation on the marginal basins.  

 

Stage V (Drift): With the continuous separation of both land masses, the Rio Grande Walvis Sea 

Mount lost its influence in controlling the sea water influx, which now became definitive. From 

the Albian to the Late Cenomanian, the deposition of the predominatly marine sediments, of the 

Riachuelo Fm. occurs (In proximal areas the deltaic sandstones of the Ângico Mb. were deposited, 

varying to the shallow marine oolitic carbonates of the Maruim Mb., and the mudstones and 

shales of the Taquari Mb.). From the late Cenomanian to the Coniacian, a major transgressive 

event occurred allowing the deposition of the ramp carbonates of the Cotinguiba Fm. The

continuous drifting modified the climate and inhibited carbonate sedimentation, leading to the 

evolution of a predominantly siliciclastic system and the deposition of the Marituba Fm. 

sandstones in the platform and shales with interbedded turbiditic sands of the Calumbi Fm. in the 

slope and basin floor. 

 

 

 

2.3 STRUCTURAL MODELS  

In terms of structural setting, SEAL basin is associated with a system of NE and SW trending 

normal faults and subsidiary E-W and NW-SE transfer faults (e.g. Mohriak et al., 1998). There are 

several theories for the evolution of the rifting process, but all agree that the structural evolution 

of the basin occurred in several phases of extension. The three main hypotheses are:    

• Lana and Milani (1983): according to these authors the basin evolved in two main stages: 

the initial stage through N45ºE sinistral transtension where en-echelon N-S normal faults, 

N30ºE and N30ºW strike-slip faults develop and a second stage characterized by NW-SE 

extension where the N30ºE faults were reactivated as normal faults.  

• Falkenhein et al. (1985): this author considers that the basin has undergone three main 

stages of rifting corresponding to different stress regimes: (1) a normal faulting regime 

dominated by E-W extension, (2) a strike-slip regime in which NNW-SSE strike-slip faults 

developed and N-S faults were reactivated, and (3) a normal faulting regime dominated by 

NW-SE extension. 

• Chagas et al. (1983) (Figure 2-5): The Chagas theory is presently the most accepted 

hypothesis. Through regional mapping these authors concluded that the main extensional 

faults, i.e. the ones that created the large depocenters along their strike, were oriented in 

two directions – NS and NE-SW – which indicated two different stress regimes. Associated 

with the large normal faults others occurred - transversally or orthogonally - which were 

interpreted as transfer faults. Hence, this model considers that there was an initial, purely 

extensional, stage of EW direction that generated N-S normal faults and E-W transfer faults; 

and a second stage of NW-SE extension that created NE-SW and NNW-SSE normal and 

transfer faults respectively (Figure 2-5). The rifting process occurred transversally to the 

pre-Cambrian basement structures, which acted as a barrier for the propagation of the 

normal faults that have been deviated or interrupted. At the same time, these pre-existing

structures contributed for the development of the transfer faults that exerted a very strong 

influence on the rift development.

2.4 THE BASEMENT IN SEAL BASIN 

The SEAL basin basement is formed by a great variety of lithologies ranging from low grade 

metamorphosed sedimentary rocks to high grade metamorphic rocks with acid and basic 

intrusions. These are the product of a very complex geological evolution that goes back to 

Proterozoic ages. Because the focus of this thesis is on Hydrocarbon (HC) exploration on the 

metamorphic basement rocks of SEAL basin, a brief description of its evolution is presented here. 

 

In order to understand the evolution of SEAL basin basement rocks we have to go back 1500 

Million years to the Greenville Orogeny. The Grenville Orogeny was a long-lived Mesoproterozoic 

mountain-building event associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Its record is 

a prominent orogenic belt which spans a significant portion of the North American continent, 

from Newfoundland to Mexico, as well as to Scotland (Figure 2-6).

The Grenville Orogeny is thought to have given origin to the Supercontinent Rodinia (Figure 2-7) 

which, according to present day plate tectonic reconstructions, existed between 1100 and 750 

million years ago, in the Neoproterozoic era. Its configuration is still very controversial, but its 

breakup is fairly well understood and believed to have started around 750 million years ago.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2-7: Alternative Neoproterozoic configurations for the supercontinent Rodinia (after Torsvik, 2003) 

 

As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed between the continental masses of 

present-day Australia, eastern Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side, 

and later Laurentia, Baltica, Amazonia and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the 

other (Figure 2-7). The first group of cratons would eventually, around 550 million years ago (on 

the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian), fuse again with Amazonia, West Africa and 

the Rio de la Plata cratons in what is called the Pan-African orogeny (Brasilian Orogeny in south 

america context), creating a configuration of continents that would remain stable for hundreds of 

millions of years in the form of the continent Gondwana (Figure 2-8). It is in the fragmentation 

and the subsequent collision of the continental masses that lays the key for understanding the 

SEAL basin basement rocks.

The landmasses of the Congo-São Francisco Craton and the West African Craton that collided 

during the Pan-African/Brasilian Orogeny mentioned above, generated what are today the 

basement rocks in the SEAL basin. Locally, these are divided in three provinces which are the 

remnants of the cratonic masses: 

- Borborema Province: the south-american remnant of the West African Craton. 

- São Francisco Craton: the south-american counterpart of the Congo craton. 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 13 

- Sergipano Fold Belt:  a triangle shaped orogenic belt lying between the Borborema Province 

(represented here by the Pernambuco-Alagoas massif) and the São Francisco Craton. It is the  

southern segment of a Brasiliano-age (?600 Ma) continental collision zone which extends 

over NE Brazil and continues into Central Africa as the North Equatorial Fold Belt 

 

It is this last province that forms the basement in the studied area. For this reason it will be 

discussed ahead with more detail.  

 

 

2.4.1 The Sergipano Fold Belt 

The Sergipano Fold Belt (SFB) borders the NE rim of the São Francisco Craton (Figure 2-9). It 

represents a small southern part of a complex collision zone of much larger proportions. The SFB 

is one of the few places in NE Brazil where probable Late Proterozoic low-grade metasediments 

are preserved, the main part of the deformed zone being high-grade gneisses or older 

metasediments. Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1968), Allard (1969), Allard &amp;amp; Hurst (1969) were pioneers in 

suggesting its continuation to the African continent, and presently the Sergipano Fold Belt is 

regarded as the central part of a megaorogen connecting the Oubangides Belt (or North 

Equatorial Belt) of Africa, with the Rio Preto Belt in Brazil (Davison &amp;amp; Santos, 1989; Trompette, 

1994) throughout the Riacho do Pontal Belt (Jardim de Sa et al., 1992; Jardim de Sá, 1994). This 

megaorogen stretches for more than 2000 Km and is a key element for global reconstructions 

whereby the northern margin of the São Francisco- Congo Craton faced a continuous ocean, the 

closure of which was part of the final amalgamation of western Gondwana about 500Ma ago (cf. 

Hoffman, 1991; Dalziel, 1992) (Figure 2-9).  

 The tectonic evolution of the SFB is interpreted as result of a half graben inversion by a low angle 

décollement of a listric fault system, in the continental crust (Figure 2-10). This evolution occurred 

between 670 and 600 Ma Rb/Sr (D’el-Rey Silva, 1995) or between 630-600 Ma U/Pb (Oliveira et. 

al., 2006), as a consequence of the frontal to oblique collision between the São Francisco-Congo 

Craton and the Pernambuco Alagoas Massif (West African Craton), as mentioned above. This 

author considers that structurally, the evolution of the SFB can be simplified by the analysis of the 

structural model of D’el-Rey Silva for the Itabaiana Dome area, which is represented in Figure 2-

11.

The Sergipano Fold Belt is cross-cut by the Phanerozoic Sergipe-Alagoas and Tucano-Jatobá 

sedimentary basins and, according to its structural and metamorphic features, may be divided 

longitudinally, from north to south, into an internal, an intermediate, an external and a cratonic 

zone, whereas its lithotypes have been grouped by Santos et al. (1988), Davison and Santos (1989) 

and Silva Filho (1998) into seven lithotectonic domains, named Sul-Alagoas, Canindé , Poço 

Redondo, Marancó, Macururé, Vaza Barris and Estância. These domains are all bounded by high-

angle thrusts associated with sinistral and dextral sense strike-parallel movement, respectively, to 

the east and west of the Tucan-Jatobá basin (Jardim de Sá et al.,1986; D'el-Rey Silva, 1992, 1995a) 

(Figure 2-12 and 2-13).

Monte-Jeremoabo fault (BMJF) stretches up to the border of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin, and separates the 
internal zone (to the north) from the intermediate, external and cratonic zones (to the south). The internal 
zone stands for a Meso-Neoproterozoic Andean-type margin. The other zones stand for a deformed passive 
continental margin (D’el-Rey Silva, 1999).

and D'el-Rey Silva and McClay (1995). Sedimentation lasted from ?1.0 Ga (U±Pb zircon data in 
metavolcanics of the Marancó domain (Brito Neves et al., 1993)) to possibly 0.65 Ga. New U±Pb data from 
zircons in volcaniclastics indicate an older age of 810 Ma for the Ribeirópolis Formation (D’el-Rey Silva, 
1999). 

 
 

Based on age determinations in Brito Neves et al. (1993), Van Schmus et al. (1995), and on is own 

work, Silva Filho (1998) proposes a sub-division into 6 main domains (Figure 2-12, 2-13 and 2-14):  

 

• Marancó and Canindé Domains: intraoceanic arcs consisting respectively of metasediments and 

metavolcanics displaying zircon U±Pb ages of 10452±20 Ma and 10072±10 Ma, along with a 1940 

Ma suite of juvenile gabbros and associated metasediments/metavolcanics. Both domains exhibit 

deformed S-type granites with 1715 Ma U±Pb zircon ages;  

 

• Poço Redondo Domain: consists of tonalitic migmatites and paragneisses;

• Sul-Alagoas Domain: comprises lithotypes typical of an accretionary prism, as well as the Jirau 

do Poncian basement dome that is overlain by a sillimanite-bearing quartzite formation all 

intruded by tonalitic granitoids displaying a Rb±Sr age of 966214 Ma. 

 

• Macururé Domain: a&amp;lt;13 km-thick wedge comprising the Macururé Group (siliciclastic and 

carbonate metasediments and metavolcanics of eugeoclinal affinities), a suite of syn- to post-

tectonic calc-alkaline granites, also found in the internal zone, as well as in the Pernambuco-

Alagoas Massif (Giuliani and Santos, 1988; Fujimori, 1989; Silva Filho et al., 1992), and the Juá 

Formation: undeformed psephites derived from rocks of the Marancó domain and infilling a small 

graben (Silva Filho et al., 1978a; Santos et al., 1988). 

 

• Vaza Barris Domain: a 1 to 4 km-thick wedge of platformal (miogeoclinal), shallow marine 

siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments and minor volcanic rocks occurring around basement 

domes and divided into the Miaba, Simão Dias, and Vaza Barris groups. 

 

• Estância Domain: a 1±3 km-thick blanket of continental to shallow marine siliciclastic and 

carbonate sediments resting unconformably on the São Francisco Craton and divided into the 

Estancia and Simão Dias groups.

2.5 PETROLEUM SYSTEMS 
 

2.5.1 Sources and Migration 

For locating the Formations referred in t in the stratigraphic record, please refer to Figure 2-2. 

The main source for the SEAL Basin is the Maceió Fm. (Aptian) – Figure 2-2 - black shales, with 

type II Organic Matter (OM) and average Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of 3.5%. The 

hydrocarbon generation started between 108 and 67 Ma, and lasts to present day. This source 

rock is not present in the entire basin and in most onshore areas charge depends on medium to 

long distance migration. Typically, migration occurs through normal faults to the Carmópolis Mb. 

sandstones, and then laterally to structural highs. 

Other proved source rocks are the Barra de Itiúba shales, with hydrocarbon generation starting 

115 Ma and lasting to the present day, and the Coqueiro Seco lacustrine shales. It is generally 

considered that the Ibura Mb shales and the Aracaré Fm. black shales are potential source rocks 

in some areas. The migration for all the sources in the Pre-Rift and Rift stages is similar to the one 

that occurs for the Maceió Fm. source. 

 

2.5.2 Reservoir and Seal Pairs 

The main reservoirs for the basin are the Carmópolis Mb. sandstones, sealed by the Ibura Mb. 

evaporites and shales, and the Calumbi Fm. turbidite sands, sealed by the encasing shales. 

The secondary reservoirs are the Serraria Fm. Sandstones, sealed by the basal shales of the Barra 

de Itiúba Fm., and the fractured and porous carbonates of the Riachuelo and Cotinguiba 

Formations, both sealed by intra-formational shales. Ahead it will be demonstrated that the 

Basement, which is sealed by the Ibura Mb., evaporites should also be considered a reservoir. 

 

2.5.3 Trap Styles 

For the fractured Basement and reservoirs of the Pre-Rift and Rift stages, traps are structural. The 

Carmópolis Mb. accumulations occur in mostly stratigraphic traps related with the Pre-Muribeca 

unconformity. Traps in the remaining Transitional stage intervals, as well as early Drift stage, are 

structural, mainly rotated fault blocks or structures associated with salt displacement. Finally, the

3. ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM 

In 2005, GALP acquired a set of exploration blocks located in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin – Sergipe Sub-

Basin. Four exploration wells were drilled in these blocks, all with the Ibura Member carbonates 

as the primary objective and the intercalated sandstones of the Calumbi Formation as the 

secondary objective.  The results of the first well demonstrated the potential of the fractured 

Basement play and by the time of the fourth well it had become the primary objective. The results 

of the four wells proved that the fractured Basement – together with the similarly fractured Ibura 

Member carbonates– should become the primary objective for future drilling campaigns in the 

area.  

The second drilling campaign, executed in 2010, confirmed the results of the previous campaign. 

Three wells were drilled, and in all three, fractured metamorphic basement rock presented the 

best results in the cuttings and when Drill Stem Tested. The results of the two drilling campaigns 

in the area had clearly proven the presence of a Naturally Fractured Reservoir, and in particular a 

fractured metamorphic basement rock.  

As a consequence of these findings, GALP created a joint team from Universidade de Aveiro, 

Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Algarve and Instituto Superior Técnico to 

structurally characterize the Basement rock and as a final product create a Discrete Fracture 

Network and simulate 3D permeability maps. The objective of this project was to provide GALP 

with a better understanding of this complex reservoir, and allow future drilling campaigns to be 

planned in a manner which would best exploit the potential petroleum resources of the area.  

This thesis integrates all the data and results that the project team has gathered and the analysis 

of the drilling and testing procedures with the final objective of providing a technically supported 

recommendation on how future exploration operations in this area should be run, by presenting 

an A to Z Exploration Workflow for Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, using SEAL’s Basement as a 

case-study. 

 

 In order to achieve the objective described above the following strategy was used:  
 

- Re-interpretation of the available seismic, focussing primarily on the Ibura Member and 

Basement horizons, with detailed fault interpretation in order to achieve a better 

understanding of the structural setting; 

- Creation of new structural maps of the Basement horizon based on the re-interpretation; 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 22 

- Detailed analysis of the well results: drilling and testing procedures (focussing on the 

fractured Basement); 

- Analysis of the Fractured Basement Project results in light of the present day knowledge 

on Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, so that they may be integrated into an overall 

petroleum exploration strategy, and provide a technically supported recommendation for 

drilling locations, along with the optimal azimuth and angle for future directional 

exploration wells; 

- Use of world analogues to demonstrate how different exploration strategies (compared 

to the traditional approach on typical reservoirs) can improve the results and optimize the 

resources. 

- Economic analysis of Traditional Methodologies VS Fractured Reservoirs Exploration 

Strategies.

4. NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS – AN OMNIPRESENT REALITY 

 

4.1 INTRODUCTION 

Taking into account all the outcrops of sedimentary rocks that a geologist observes along the 

years, it is not likely to find any that is unfractured – exceptions made to those extremely ductile 

rocks, such as salt or certain shales. This happens because; unfractured rocks do not exist! It has 

also been demonstrated that the vast majority of fractures observed in outcrop are not solely the 

result of surface conditions, which means that the fractures that one can observe in outcrop can 

also exist in the subsurface. Therefore, it follows that hydrocarbon reservoirs in sedimentary rock 

s(and also in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks) all contain fractures and many are fractured 

enough to be treated as fractured reservoirs.  

Despite this, the practice of treating reservoirs as fractured rock masses is not a standard industry 

practice. Why?! This author considers that there are several reasons for this: 

1. As stated, virtually all reservoirs contain at least some natural fractures. However, the 

effect of these fractures on fluid flow is in most cases negligible and the reservoir can be 

treated, from a geological and reservoir engineering perspective, as a “conventional” 

reservoir. 

2. Most common naturally fractured reservoirs are characterized as hard rock of low 

porosity and permeability but still having most of the fluids stored in the matrix rock. The 

fractures are only providing the flow paths for those fluids. This means that, for most 

fractured reservoirs, the rock matrix accounts for the bulk of the reserves, and that an 

important part of the exploration strategy - and hence for the selection of prospective 

drilling locations - is the identification of fractured intervals with sufficient matrix 

porosity. In such cases it is more common that the traditional exploration approach is 

followed. Exceptions made for those cases where it is needed to intersect the fractures in 

order to assure flow.  

3.  Almost all fractured reservoirs respond in a manner unique to that specific reservoir. That 

is, despite the existence of a good, working fractured reservoir classification, each 

fractured reservoir responds in its own distinctive way. As a consequence, applying 

general rules of thumb to specific fractured reservoirs can be misleading.

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 24 

From this comes that, due to the desire of simplifying technical work and reducing cycle times in 

exploration and production, geologists and engineers tend to fall into the fracture denial 

paradigm. It is true that fractured reservoirs are more complicated than matrix reservoirs, and 

that they require more time and money to be evaluated correctly, but the problems with this 

denial or avoidance can be serious and include: 1) irreparable loss of recovery factor; 2) primary 

recovery patterns that are inappropriate for secondary recovery; 3) inefficient capital expenditure 

during development; 4) drilling of unnecessary in-fill wells; and 5) improper assessment of 

economic opportunities. To avoid this it is important to determine the effect of natural fractures 

on the reservoir that we are analysing, so that the exploration strategy can be adequate from day 

one.  

 

This thesis has the objective of providing a technically supported recommendation on how future 

exploration operations should be run, by presenting an A to Z Exploration Workflow for Naturally 

Fractured Reservoirs (NFR), using SEAL’s Basement as a case-study. As it will be shown ahead, this 

basement rock is a naturally fractured reservoir and therefore traditional exploration approaches 

do not work well here. The present chapter has the objective of presenting the geological and 

engineering aspects of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs. 

 

 

 

4.2 DEALING WITH NATURALLY FRACTURED RESERVOIRS 

Before any other consideration is made, it is important to define fracture and fractured reservoir. 

Because this work is dealing with the effect of naturally occurring fractures on reservoir rock, the 

definition will be restricted to this context. Hence, a reservoir fracture is a macroscopic planar 

discontinuity that results from stresses (due to deformation or physical diagenesis) that exceeds 

the rupture strength of the rock. Natural fractures may have either a positive or negative effect 

on fluid flow within the rock (Nelson, 2001). 

If the definition of a reservoir fracture is broad, the definition of fractured reservoir even more so: 

a fractured reservoir is defined as a reservoir in which naturally occurring fractures either have, or 

are predicted to have, a significant effect on reservoir fluid flow either in the form of increased 

reservoir permeability and/or reserves, or increased permeability anisotropy (Nelson, 2001). 

 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 25 

Having these definitions in mind, we can now approach the way of how to deal with a fractured 

reservoir. It is of paramount importance to know what we are looking for and what we have 

found in terms of reservoir properties. For this reason most authors consider that, despite the fact 

that each fractured reservoir has its particularities, a general set of information has to be 

gathered to evaluate any Naturally Fractured Reservoir: fracture origin, fracture properties 

affecting reservoir properties, fracture/matrix interaction and reservoir typing. Ultimately this 

information has the objective of supplying a well location. To gather this information the geologist 

can use several sources at different times during the exploration workflow, but if a logical 

sequence is followed, this process will be less time and money consuming and results will 

improve. Figure 4-1 represents the exploration workflow suggested by this author for the SEAL 

Basement Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR), but that can be applied for other similar situations.

Figure 4-1 (unfold next page): Proposed workflow for the present study.  Inside the green squares are the 
key points of the workflow: the identification of the fracture system and its properties (origin, properties 
affecting reservoir performance, fracture-matrix interaction), classification of the reservoir type, well 
design, well results and Pre- and Post-Drill volumes calculation. This method involves several sources of 
information, gathered at different times during the Exploration process.  
It is first important to assess if there is the possibility of the presence of fractures. If it is, then the geologist 
should understand the Fracture System properties. To do that, he can use old well data, outcrop data, 
regional geology and, if available, seismic. Old well data and outcrop analysis will give information on the 
lithology, orientation of fracture patterns and on rock mechanical properties, which will allow the geologist 
to derive the Fracture Properties Affecting Reservoir Performance and how Fractures and Matrix Interact. 
Regional geology, in its turn, will supply the regional tectonic regimes and the structural setting of the area, 
which allows for the classification of the Fracture System Origin. Together, data from these three sources 
will constrain the Geomechanical Models that allow the creation of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) 
models to simulate the Fracture System Properties (fracture and permeability distribution) leading 
ultimately to the classification of the Reservoir Type. If seismic is not available in the first phase, the analysis 
of the other data can help on the decision on whether it should or not be acquired and on the parameters 
to do so. Seismic interpretation - especially fault interpretation - of the available seismic will also help on 
the understanding of the fracture patterns and will be an input for any reservoir models that are created. 
Notice that emphasis is also given on processing, as complex settings as NFR’s (especially in Basement 
contexts) require special processing steps.  
All these have the ultimate objective of finding a suitable well location. Prior to drilling there is the need of 
calculating hydrocarbon (HC) volumes in place. This will be based on the properties simulated by the 
models, and using parameters given by the previous analysis. Well design will be subjected to the fracture 
system properties (orientation and permeability distribution), in terms of orientation as in most cases NFR’s 
wells are drilled directional and underbalanced. The evaluation of the wells will give more information 
about the reservoir properties and consequently help readjusting the models previously created as well as 
accessing Post-Drill Volumetrics. This is an iterative workflow. The following paragraphs will analyse the 
workflow in more detail.

4.2.1 Fracture System Identification 

The identification of the presence of fractures in the area of interest prior to the realisation of 

wells is of paramount importance as it will influence much of the future exploration strategy. 

Presently, some of the available methods allow the geologists to identify not only the presence of 

fractures, but in many cases – depending on the quality of the available data – their distribution 

and orientation in the rock volume. This section will describe the data that can be used to 

accomplish this objective.  

Well Data: The analysis of well data from past drilling campaigns is very important, as the 

presence of fractures might have gone unnoticed due to a lack of awareness of the geologists and 

engineers at the time. Well data includes cuttings, well logs, image logs, core data and production 

tests results. Some situations might indicate the presence of fractures (Nelson, 2001): 

• Mud losses might be associated with natural fractures, vugs, underground caverns or 

induced fractures and penetration rates can increase significantly while drilling all types of 

secondary porosity.  

• If from cores the permeability of a formation is 0.1 md, and the well produces 1,000 Bbl/day 

(Bbl = Barrels) in an Extended Well Test (EWT), it can be inferred that the rate is the result 

of some type of secondary porosity, including fractures.  

• Consider also the situation where a rock was described by the mudlogger as a crystalline 

rock – hence with no primary porosity – and good oil shows were detected. Some kind of 

secondary porosity should be inferred and image logs may help clarifying this. 

 

The analysis of this data also allows for the early calculation of parameters such as fracture 

porosity, permeability and fracture density, helping the geologist to plan future data acquisition 

and/or drilling campaigns (Nelson, 2001). Emphasis on how to use Drill Stem Test’s and Image logs 

information is presented in the Appendix of this thesis. 

 

Outcrops: A properly conducted outcrop study can probably provide the most useful information 

on the relation between fractures and the host rock. In other words, outcrops supply valuable 

information for the calculation of most rock parameters that need to be assessed when 

characterizing a NFR – fracture and matrix permeability, fracture density and fracture system 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 27 

orientation. The use of outcrops is obviously conditioned to one very simple factor – their 

existence. Assuming that outcrops are available, the geologist can face two different situations:  

1) the outcrop is the exact same formation as the one that is being targeted 

2) the outcrop can be used as an analogue for the targeted formation 

It is obvious that the first situation is much more convenient as it makes the gathered information 

more reliable, but if the correct analogue is chosen, the geologist can extrapolate the data 

collected from that analysis to his own situation.  

Outcrop studies should be conducted with care, taking into account the fact that the exposed rock 

was subjected to the effect of lithospheric unloading (creating joints) and weathering that altered 

many of the rock properties, relative to the same rock in burial conditions. 

 

Regional Geology: as in any other geosciences study, the regional geological context where our 

object of study is inserted is of paramount importance. It is the regional geological context that 

will determine some of the properties of the rock mass to be analysed. Information on the 

lithologies encountered, fault patterns, stress fields (present and past), geodynamic evolution, 

and the relations between all of this will allow for fracture system classification in terms of origin 

– which in turn will determine most of the fracture properties such as spacing, length, width and 

orientation. This knowledge can be used as an input in geomechanical modelling for prediction on 

fracture distribution. 

 

The facture properties mentioned, fracture morphology, fracture width and permeability, fracture 

spacing, origin of the fracture system, the interaction between matrix and the fractures and the 

reservoir classification will be discussed in detail ahead.  

  

Seismic Information: If seismic is available, the geologist can use it to obtain valuable information 

on the structural context of the area – by mapping horizons and faults – and even on fracture 

patterns - by extracting attributes from the seismic volume or by detailed azimuthal velocity 

analysis on pre-stack data. Both can also be used as an input to constrain any geomechanical 

modelling that is done. If seismic is not available, the analysis of the previous data will help in 

deciding if it should or should not be acquired. Seismic acquisition and processing for Naturally 

Fractured Reservoirs (NFR) will be described ahead.

Fractures can interfere with the propagation of the seismic waves and cause low P and S-wave 

velocities (Vp and Vs),  and lower seismic frequency and quality factor (Q). These characteristics 

help the interpreter to identify fractures in the seismic record. 

? Low Vp and Vs: Fractures lower seismic P and S-wave velocity due to the rock’s secondary 

porosity that was caused by the fractures. As fracture density increases, P-wave velocity 

decreases. A plausible explanation for this is that, as fracture density increases, the 

overall velocity becomes increasingly more sensitive to the fracture properties and less 

sensitive to the intact rock properties (Boadu, 1997). But if the fractures are filled with 

minerals (not fluid), the changes in Vp and Vs are dependent on the elastic properties of 

the minerals which filled the fractures. At the same time, Hilterman (1977) states that the 

compressional wave velocity (Vp) for hydrocarbon filled fractures is lower than brine filled 

fractures. The Vs of hydrocarbon filled fractures will be slightly higher than brine filled 

fractures. 

? Fractures also lower seismic frequency and quality factor (Q). The fractures cause a time 

delay in the propagating waveform and act as filter by attenuating the high frequency 

components in the spectrum of the waveform (Boadu, 1997)- Figure 4-2.

vertically aligned fractures (left) and for a model that consists of seven vertically aligned fractures (right) 
(Boadu, 1997). As the number of fractures increases, the amplitude of the received waveforms is 
significantly reduced and there is also a shift in the peak amplitude towards lower frequency. Source: Sugiri, 
O. I. (2010). 

 

Surface seismic data has long been used for detecting faults and large fractures, but recent 

developments in seismic attribute analysis have shown promise in identifying groups of closely 

spaced fractures or interconnected fracture networks. These significant advances in 3D seismic

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 29 

technology allow in many cases the interpreters to determine fracture orientation, anisotropy and 

fracture density. One of the greatest strengths of 3D seismic is the dense, regular sampling of data 

over the region of interest, providing images that accurately represent the areal extent of the 

features. Among the various geophysical techniques available for characterizing faults and 

fractures, 3D seismic attributes have proven to be some of the most useful, in particular those 

that are sensitive to reservoir impedance, thickness, or geomorphology. Although there are a few 

hundred seismic attributes that are in common use today, post-stack attributes such as dip-

magnitude, dip-azimuth, coherence and curvature, are the most useful, and proven to work, for 

fault/fracture detection.  

According to Chopra (2009), the benefits of using these discontinuity seismic attributes are: 

1. Easier recognition of detailed geology within a 3D seismic dataset. 

2. Interpretation of higher resolution faults/fractures in any orientation without 

interpretation bias. 

3. Clearer stratigraphic features for more accurate interpretations 

4. Features imaged in a consistent three-dimensional manner 

5. Suitable comparison with log data allows confident interpretation of faults/fractures 

6. Reduction of exploration and development risk by providing a more accurate 

understanding of subsurface geologic features recorded by 3D seismic data. 

7. Reduces interpretation cycle time and costs by providing a clearer picture of the 

subsurface 

8. Added value to existing 3D seismic investment by exploiting the data to its fullest.  

9. Represent a small percentage of the total seismic cost. 

 

The main attributes which have proven efficient for fault /fracture detection are, dip-magnitude, 

dip-azimuth, coherence and curvature. Notice that the quality of these attributes is directly 

proportional to the quality of the input seismic data. So, for extracting more accurate information 

from seismic attributes, the input seismic data needs to be cleared of all distortion effects, 

whether near-surface or amplitude/phase related. Curvature and coherence attributes are 

presently considered to be the most powerful tools to detect fractures. For that reason they will 

be given emphasis here.

Dip-Magnitude: computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) or line (2D) between its 

immediate neighbour traces on a horizon and outputs the magnitude of dip (gradient) of that 

plane or line measured in degrees – Figure 4-3. 

Dip-Azimuth: computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) between its immediate neighbour 

traces on a horizon and outputs the direction of maximum slope (dip direction) measured in 

degrees, clockwise from North- Figure 4-3. 

Coherence (Figure 4-4): measures the continuity between seismic traces in a specified window 

along a picked horizon. Similar traces are mapped with high coherence coefficients, while 

discontinuities have low coefficients. Regions of seismic traces cut by faults, for example, result in 

sharp discontinuities of trace-to-trace coherence, resulting in delineation by low coherence along 

fault planes. It is essentially a cube of coherence coefficients generated from the input 3D seismic 

data volume that portrays faults and other stratigraphic anomalies clearly, on time or horizon 

slices.  An advantage of the coherence cube is that it gives an unbiased view of the features in the 

seismic volume. No interpretation is required for viewing them. 

 

Curvature (Figure 4-5): A group of post-stack attributes that are computed from the curvature of a 

specified horizon or seismic volume. The concept of curvature applied to a specific task is 

illustrated in Figure 4-5. There are many curvature measurements that can be computed, but the 

most-positive and most-negative curvature measures are the most useful in that they tend to be 

most easily related to geological structures. 

 

 

Presently, curvature attributes can be computed using the full seismic volume instead of a specific 

horizon. As the name implies, horizon-based curvature is computed directly from a picked seismic 

horizon which in general requires that the data quality be good and that the horizon of interest 

corresponds to a prominent impedance contrast. Horizons picked on noisy surface seismic data or 

picked through regions where no continuous surface exists can produce misleading curvature 

measures. A way of addressing such problems is to spatially filter the horizon picks, with the 

objective of removing the noise and retaining the features of geologic interest (Bergbauer et al., 

2003; Chopra et al., 2006). Volumetric curvature begins by first computing dip and azimuth using 

a small analysis window (9 traces by +/-10 ms for the examples shown in the figures that follow) 

for every point in the 3D volume. By using a vertical analysis window and the analytic (original 

trace and its Hilbert transform) rather than just the original trace, volumetric estimates of dip and 

azimuth are in general more robust than horizon-based estimates.

At the same time, curvature computations with different wavelengths (Multispectral) enhance 

geologic features having different scales. Tight (short-wavelength) curvature often delineates 

details within intense, highly localized fracture systems. Broad (long wavelength) curvature often 

enhances subtle flexures on the scale of 100-200 traces that are difficult to see in conventional 

seismic, but are frequently correlated to fracture zones that are below seismic resolution, as well 

as to collapse features and diagenetic alterations (Figure 4-6).  

 

There are two possible explanations why the coherence image of Figure 4-4 b) does not provide 

as much detail as the curvature images. The first reason is geological: the faults can progressively 

lose throw and eventually become simple flexures; alternatively, there may be sediment drag 

along some of the faults that make them appear to be flexures. The second reason is geophysical: 

either the fault has insufficient throw to be resolved as a discontinuity or the velocities are 

inaccurate such that the faults are somewhat smeared and therefore only appear to be flexures. 

Be they faults or flexures, we might anticipate increased presence of natural fractures near these 

lineaments. We also note synthetic folds indicated by white arrows that are nearly perpendicular 

to the en echelon reverse fault system.

Curvature attributes exhibit detailed patterns for fracture networks that can be correlated with 

image logs and production data to confirm their authenticity. To do this correlation, the 

interpreter can manually pick the lineaments seen on the curvature displays for a localized area 

around the borehole, and then transform these lineaments into rose diagrams comparing them 

with similar rose diagrams obtained from image logs. Another way is to generate automated 3D 

rose diagrams from seismic attributes and correlate them with other lineaments seen on the 

coherence attribute, for example. 

If by using these attributes the interpreter establishes fracture orientation and distribution, it is 

possible to make conclusions about the fracture system origin (the next step in this evaluation 

sequence), and save resources evaluating logs and cores. 

 

By using these information sources, the geologist is now prepared to make conclusions on the 

fracture system itself. These are relative to the fracture system origin and the properties that 

influence the reservoir performance. In the following sections these topics will be discussed in 

detail. 

 

 

4.2.2 Fracture System Origin 

Understanding the origin of the fracture system has the objective of allowing the interpreter to 

predict how fractures will be distributed in the rock volume. The input data for this consists of 

fracture dip, morphology, strike, relative abundance, aperture, and the angular relationships 

between fracture sets. Full-diameter cores (oriented or conventional), borehole imaging logs 

(Dipmeter, FMI, CMI), or other less oriented logging tools, can supply this information, which can 

then be applied to one of the existent geological fracture models allowing the extrapolation and 

interpolation of fracture distribution. Geological fracture models, which are postulated from the 

combination of geological and rock mechanics approaches, classify fractures as being: tectonic 

(fold and/or fault related), regional, contractional (diagenetic) or surface related (Aguilera, 1998; 

Stearns and Friedman 1972; Nelson 1979). These models assume that natural fracture patterns 

depict the local state of stress at the time of fracturing, and that subsurface rocks fracture in a 

manner qualitatively similar to equivalent rocks in laboratory tests performed at analogous 

environmental conditions. This way, natural fracture patterns are interpreted in light of the 

laboratory-derived fracture patterns (Handin and Hager, 1957) and in terms of postulated paleo-



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 35 

stress fields and strain distributions at the time of fracturing. In general, any physical or 

mathematical model of deformation that depicts stress or strain fields can, by various levels of 

extrapolation, be used as a fracture distribution model (Hafner, 1951; Ode, 1957; and Lorenz and 

others, 1993). 

Nelson (2001) presents an alternative version to the Stearns and Friedman (1979) model who 

divides fractures into those observed in laboratory experiments and those observed in outcrop

The following definitions are simplified from Nelson, 2001 according to Table 4-1. A detailed 

structural description of each type of fractures will not be made, as this is not the objective of the 

present work. Emphasis will be given on the occurrence of each type in terms of hydrocarbon 

production. 

 

Experimental Fracture Classification 

1. Shear Fractures: Shear fractures form when all three principal stresses are compressive having 

a sense of displacement parallel to the fracture plane. They form at some acute angle to the 

maximum compressive principal stress direction (?1) and at an obtuse angle to the minimum 

compressive stress direction (?3) within the rock sample. Potentially, two shear fracture 

orientations can develop in every laboratory fracture experiment, one on either side of, and 

oriented at the same angle to ?1. This is predicted by the Mohr-Coulomb Shear Stress theory.

2. Extension Fractures: These fractures also form when all three principal stresses are 

compressive and have a sense of displacement perpendicular to and away from the fracture 

plane. They form parallel to ?1 and ?2 and perpendicular to ?3 (Figure 4-7). In laboratory fracture 

experiments, extension fractures can and often do form synchronously with shear fractures.

shear fractures (B and C) are shown (Nelson, 2001). 

 

 

3. Tension fractures: Tension fractures also have a sense of displacement perpendicular to and 

away from the fracture plane and form parallel to ?1 and ?2. In terms of orientation of ?1 and 

sense of displacement, these fractures resemble extension fractures. However, to form a tension 

fracture, at least one principal stress (?3) must be negative (tensile) while to form an extension 

fracture, all three principal stresses must be positive (compressive). The distinction between the 

two is important because rocks have a much lower (10 to 50 times lower) fracture strength in 

tension tests than they do in extension tests, an observation that becomes important in 

mathematical prediction of subsurface fracturing. Also, it is likely that true tensile fractures only 

occur in near subsurface environment, while extension fractures can occur in all low mean stress 

subsurface conditions.

Geological Fracture Classification 

As stated, the geological fracture classification is based on the assumptions that natural fracture 

patterns (conjugate shear and extension or tensile fractures) reliably depict the local state of 

stress at the time of fracturing and that subsurface rocks and equivalent laboratory samples 

fracture in a manner that is qualitatively similar, when tests are performed at analogous 

environmental conditions. This means that one can consider that natural fracture patterns reflect 

the same geometry with respect to applied loads as do fractures generated in laboratory 

experiments and naturally occurring fractures can be classified on the basis of the origin the 

forces that caused them as determined from laboratory data and fracture system geometry (Table 

4–1).  

 

Tectonic Fractures: Tectonic fractures are those whose origin can, on the basis of orientation, 

distribution, and morphology, be attributed to or associated with a local tectonic event. They are 

formed by the application of surface forces and form in networks with specific spatial 

relationships to folds and faults. Historically, most hydrocarbon production has been obtained 

from tectonic fractures. 

a) Fault Related Tectonic Fractures: Fault planes are, by definition, planes of shear motion. 

The majority of fractures developed in relation with faults are the result of the same stress field 

that caused the fault. These are shear fractures parallel or conjugate to the fault or extension 

fractures bisecting the acute angle between these two shear directions (Figure 4-8). The 

intensity of fracturing associated with faulting appears to be a function of lithology, distance 

from the fault plane, amount of displacement along the fault, total strain in the rock mass, 

depth of burial, and possibly the type of fault (thrust, growth, etc.) (Nelson, 2001). Which of 

these parameters will dominate fracture intensity varies from fault to fault.

b) Fold Related Tectonic Fractures: these types of fractures are very complex, because the 

way stress and strain act in folds is not as linear as in faults. The best way to present the 

total fracture geometry is by using Stearns (1964, 1968a, 1968b) work, resumed in Table 

4-2.

Regional Fractures: regional fractures are developed over large areas of the earth’s crust with 

relatively little change in orientation, show no evidence of offset across the fracture plane, and 

are always perpendicular to major bedding surfaces (Stearns, 1968a, 1968b, 1972; and Nelson and 

Stearns, 1977). They differ from tectonic fractures in that they are developed in a consistent and 

simple geometry, have a relatively large spacing, and are developed over an extremely large area 

crosscutting local structures. The origin of regional fractures is still dubious but theories ranging 

from plate tectonics to earth tides (fatigue) have been proposed; however, none have proven 

conclusive. Presently they are considered as a result of the application of external or surface 

forces (refer to Lorenz et al., 1993; Engelder and Geiser, 1980 for details).  

Regional fracture systems produce hydrocarbons in numerous fields; examples of such are the Big 

Sandy Field in Kansas and the Altamont-Blue Bell in Uinta Basin, Utah.  

 

Contractional Fractures: This class is a collection of tension or extension fractures associated with 

a general bulk volume reduction throughout the rock and are a result of: desiccation; syneresis; 

thermal gradients; or mineral phase changes. Details of these processes are not going to be 

described as cases of HC production from contractional fractures are not very common except for 

thermal contraction fractures, which allow storage in rocks such as basalts (ex.: West Rozel Field, 

Salt Lake, Utah). 

 

Surface Related Fractures: these fractures have not proven to be important in hydrocarbon 

production to date in other than weathering surfaces. This class includes fractures developed 

during unloading, release of stored stress and strain, creation of free surfaces or unsupported 

boundaries, and weathering in general. Surface-related fractures are often developed due to the 

application of body forces. 

 

4.2.3 Fracture Properties Affecting Reservoir Performance 

After determining the origin of the fracture system, it is necessary to understand if they represent 

an advantage or handicap to the reservoir performance. To do this we need to address the 

petrophysical properties of the rock-fracture system. The four petrophysical determinations most 

useful in this evaluation are, in order of increasing difficulty of calculation: fracture permeability; 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 40 

fracture porosity; fluid saturations within the fractures and the recovery factor expected from the 

fracture system. These properties are directly dependent on three fracture properties:  

• fracture morphology,  

• fracture width and permeability, 

• fracture spacing.  

 

For determining these, core analysis, well tests and image logs are the best methods. Core 

analysis is used to determine reservoir quality and performance by summing the individual small-

scale elements of the reservoir. Well testing, on the other hand, is used to determine the bulk 

response of a relatively large volume of the reservoir and is a summary of the relative 

contribution of all its individual parts. Image log analysis has been used successfully to delineate 

fracture occurrence and distribution in the wellbore. The quantification of the subsurface 

reservoir properties such as porosity and permeability of fracture systems by image logs is, 

however, much more uncertain. For this reasons most authors agree that cores represent the 

most important source of information. 

 

4.2.3.1 Fracture Morphology 

An important factor that determines fracture porosity and permeability is the morphology of the 

fracture planes, which can be observed in core and outcrop and inferred from some well logs. 

There are four Basic types of natural fracture plane morphology (Nelson, 2001): 

1. Open fractures 

2. Deformed fractures 

a. Gouge-filled fractures 

b. Slickensided fractures 

3. Mineral-filled fractures 

4. Vuggy fractures 

 

1. Open Fractures: When the natural fractures are open and have a negligible amount of 

secondary mineralization the hydrocarbons move from the matrix to the fractures in an 

unrestricted way. As the name implies, open fractures virtually possess no deformational or 

diagenetic material filling the width between the walls of the fracture. Permeability of open 

fractures is a function of:  



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 41 

 

 

• the initial fracture width; 

• the roughness of the fracture walls;  

• the contact area of the fracture walls  

• the in situ effective stress component normal to the fracture plane; 

In general, open fractures greatly increase reservoir permeability parallel to the fracture plane but 

will have little or no effect on fluid flow perpendicular to the fracture plane (Figure 4-9). 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Figure 4-9: Example of 3-D whole-core permeability 
associated with an open fracture. K= permeability in 
mili-darcys (md). Notice that KHmax is parallel to the 
fracture plane (Nelson, 2001). 

 

 

2. Deformed Fractures:  formed as a relative ductile shear zone or initially open and subsequently 

physically altered by tectonic shear motions; deformed fractures create strong anisotropy within 

the reservoir. Two types are considered: gouge-filled (Figure 4-10 and 4-12) (deformation bands) 

and slickensided (Figure 4-11 and 4-13). Both types reduce the permeability of the fracture.  

 

3. Mineral Filled Fractures: these fractures have been filled or constricted by secondary or 

diagenetic mineralization. This secondary cement is usually quartz, carbonate, or both. Its effect 

on permeability depends on the mineralization grade which can be complete or incomplete 

depending on the diagenetic history of the material (Figure 4-14 and 4-15).  

 

4. Vuggy Fractures: vuggy fractures can have very large porosities and several darcies of 

permeability. They form when fluid in disequilibrium with the rock matrix enters a low-

permeability rock along fracture planes. This causes dissolution, and vugs to form along and

adjacent to the fractures. These vugs are usually restricted to a narrow zone surrounding the 

fracture channel. Vuggy fractures exist in all types of lithologies. Examples of which are the Bach 

Ho Field, offshore Vietnam (hydrothermally altered and fractured granitic basement) and the 

carbonate reservoirs of Iran.

To summarise, fracture morphology influences the directional permeability of the host rock:  

• Open Fractures: increase permeability parallel to fracture plane. Permeability across the 

open fracture is identical to normal matrix permeability in that direction. 

• Gouge-filled Fracture: reduces reservoir permeability across the fracture.  

• Slickensided Fracture: creates the largest permeability anisotropy, of all fracture 

morphologies by increasing permeability parallel to the fracture and decreasing it across 

the fracture. 

• Vuggy:  similar to open fractures if diagenetic alteration of the vug walls doesn’t occur. 

 

4.2.3.2 Fracture Width and Permeability 

The effect of individual fractures on fluid flow is dependent on the character and morphology of 

the fracture plane. This means that fractures do not always enhance permeability, as in some 

cases they may act as a barrier to fluid flow.  

Despite not being an easy task, there are some indicators that can give the geologist or engineer 

clues if the fractures present in a rock, play or not an important role in fluid production:  

• Direct observation of oil-stained or “bleeding” fracture planes in core samples can 

indicate fracture control. 

• High permeability derived from flow tests in zones of relatively low pressure plug (core-

derived) permeability can indicate flow control by natural fractures. 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 45 

• Fluid flow control can also be revealed by three-directional whole-core permeability 

analysis (Khmax, Kh90º, Kv) as explained in the previous section. 

The first and general equation for a quantitative description of fluid flow was formulated by Darcy 

(1856). This equation was derived for laminar, incompressible, single-phase, Newtonian flow in a 

continuous, homogeneous, porous material. To summarise, Darcy's law is a simple proportional 

relationship between the instantaneous discharge rate through a porous medium, the viscosity of 

the fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance (Figure 4-16). 

Despite being a good approximation for fluid flow across a porous medium, Darcy’s law could not 

be applied to flow along a fracture. Therefore, the theory of parallel flow was developed. Here, 

flow is assumed to occur between two smooth parallel plates separated by a distance e (Figure 4-

17).  

The next logical step was to combine both equations (Darcy’s and parallel plates fluid flow), which 

was made by Parsons (1996). The resulting equation is resumed in Figure 4-18, and it is 

considered to be a good approximation of total reservoir flow for subsurface reservoirs prior to 

production (Nelson, 2001 and Jones, 1975). This equation assumes that flow across the 

fracture/matrix surface does not alter the flow of either system, which is true for rocks of either 

high or near nonexistent matrix permeability. This means that, if matrix permeability is high, that 

same matrix will respond individually to the overall pressure gradient rather than to the relative 

pressure drop of the fracture. If, alternatively, the matrix permeability is close to being null, cross-

flow becomes unimportant. In a rock of relatively low or intermediate matrix permeability, cross-

flow becomes more important and Parsons Equation becomes a poorer approximation of the 

total flow. There are alternative approximations, but their complexity and the fact that Parson’s 

Equation has shown successful in laboratory experiments leads to the conclusion that it is an apt 

semi-quantitative representation of fractured reservoir flow for use in exploration.

cross-sectional area to flow, A (units of area, e.g., m

), and the pressure drop (Pb-Pa), all divided by 

the viscosity, ? (Pa.s) and the length over which the pressure drop is taking place over. The negative sign 
in k is essential because fluids flow from high pressure to low pressure. So if the change in pressure is 
negative (where Pa &gt; Pb) then the flow will be in the positive 'x' direction.

4.2.3.3 Fracture Spacing 

Fracture spacing can be directly quantified by observation of outcrops, wellbore and cores and 

does not change when the reservoir is perturbed. However, the quantification is complicated due 

to the small size of subsurface sampling methods (core and wellbore observations) with respect to 

the fracture spacing or matrix block size. 

The definition which is mostly used in theoretical fracture permeability equations, considers that 

fracture spacing is defined as the average distance between regularly spaced fractures measured 

perpendicular to a parallel set of fractures of a given orientation (Parsons, 1966). This definition 

allows the calculation of fracture spacing by counting the number of fractures along a line of some 

given length perpendicular to the fracture set of interest, for each of the fracture sets present and 

dividing by the length of measurement line (Nelson, 2001). This calculation is similar to what 

modern FMI tools automatically operate.The effect of fracture spacing on both fracture porosity 

and permeability is shown in Figures 4-19, 4-20 and 4-21.

4.2.4 Fracture and Matrix Interaction – Porosity Communication 

Reservoirs in which fractures play a significant role must be treated as a dual-porosity system – 

one system is the rock matrix, and the other the fractures. What is important to understand is the 

relation between these two systems, i.e. how flow communication between the fractures and the 

matrix occurs and how it will condition reservoir productivity. Like matrix porosity, fracture 

porosity is the percentage of a particular void volume in a rock mass compared to its total volume. 

The difference lies in the fact that in fracture porosity only those voids occurring between the 

walls of fractures are considered. Matrix porosity, on the contrary, accounts for all voids within a 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 49 

rock other than those within fractures. The two basic relationships used to calculate fracture 

porosity and matrix porosity are presented below (Figure 4-22): 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 
Figure 4-22: mathematical formulas for matrix (A) and fracture (B) porosity calculation. Where: V- volume 
of pores (other than fractures; Vb- bulk volume; D- average spacing between parallel fractures; e-average 
effective width of fractures. 

 

 

Some characteristics of fracture porosity are: 

- Relative small increases in fracture porosity have great influence in permeability parallel 

to fracture because of the high interconnectivity of fractures. 

- Fractures compress or reduce in porosity and permeability much more readily than the 

matrix when subjected to external stress increases (below the yield point) due to either 

increasing depth of burial or reservoir depletion.  

- Fracture porosity is generally a small number compared to “normal” matrix porosity. 

Most fractured reservoirs have fracture porosities less than 1% (Nelson, 2001). 

 

Fracture porosity estimations can be made by: 

1. Core analysis 

2. kf/?f relationship 

3. Field determinations 

4. Logs 

5. Multiple well tests 

 

Only core analysis, logs and well tests will be approached here in more detail. For further reading 

please refer to Nelson, 2001.  

 

Core analysis: despite the fact that larger volumes of rock are sampled when whole cores are 

taken, fracture porosity calculation is determined by the orientation and spacing of the fractures

Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 50 

relative to the direction and diameter of the core. For that reason it is important to try to 

determine general fracture orientation before collecting a whole core. 

 

 Logs: There is no direct method for calculating fracture porosity from well logs. Several authors 

have developed methods to detect natural fracture systems through logs (Aguilera and van 

Poollen, 1977; and Aguilera, 1995), but none can calculate ?f directly. Presently, the image tools 

allow for this calculation by recording not only the fractures orientation but also their aperture 

and intensity (density) which can be used for fracture porosity calculation. However, as the tools 

have a limited radius of investigation within the formation, fracture porosity values cannot be 

considered absolute. See the Appendix for more details. 

 
Well Test Analysis: Pulse tests and transient pressure analysis (see Appendix for details), can be 

used for ?f calculation. However, they require close-spaced wells for testing and are usually only 

applicable in well-developed areas where production can be ceased in several wells long enough 

to perform the tests. Well test analysis is further discussed ahead.  

 

Note: Modeling for NFR’s will be presented in Section 5 as part of the implementation of the 

workflow for SEAL Basement Fractured Reservoir. 

 

 

4.2.5 Reservoir Classification 

Once fracture origin, fracture properties affecting reservoir performance and fracture/matrix 

interaction has been defined, we can classify the reservoir which we are dealing with. This 

classification is done on the basis of what positive effects the fracture system provides to overall 

reservoir quality. Nelson (2001), based on Hubbert and Willis (1955) classification proposes the 

following classification (Figure 4-23):  

• Type 1: Fractures provide the essential reservoir porosity and permeability. 

• Type 2: Fractures provide the essential reservoir permeability. 

• Type 3: Fractures assist permeability in an already producible reservoir. 

• Type 4: Fractures provide no additional porosity or permeability but create significant   

reservoir anisotropy (barriers). 

From these four types of reservoir, those classified as Type 1, are those where fractures play the 

most important role, by providing both porosity and permeability. For this reason an early 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 51 

calculation of fracture porosity or fracture volume existent per well is essential, so that total 

reserves are calculated, and to predict if initially high flow rates will be maintained or will drop 

rapidly with time.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure 4-23: A schematic cross plot of percent reservoir porosity versus percent reservoir permeability 
(percent due to matrix versus percent due to fractures) for the fractured reservoir classification used by 
Nelson, 2001.  Reservoir type IV is outside the box because fractures provide no additional porosity or 
permeability but create significant reservoir anisotropy. M = matrix.  

 

For these estimations, fracture width and fracture spacing values are crucial. For reservoirs of 

Type 2 and 3 accurate fracture porosity calculations are much less important because the fracture 

system only provides permeability (porosity or storage volume is given by the matrix). In these 

later cases, the matrix pore volume is usually several orders of magnitude greater than fracture 

volume and overshadows it so much that early calculations of fracture porosity are not important. 

However it is important to understand how fractures and matrix interact to predict if the fluids 

stored in the matrix porosity can be drained through the fractures. Each of these categories has 

its particularities, which are better described if we use a table, where examples of each reservoir 

type are also shown – Figure 4-24 and Tables 4-3 and 4-4. 

One characteristic of fractured reservoirs is that each is a particular case, meaning that even if 

they are of the same Type, they can have very different exploration and production stories. One 

example of such difference is the Edison Field in California and Big Sandy in Kentucky (Nelson, 

2001). Both are Type 1 reservoirs, but in Edison Field the fractured Jurassic schist has a 395 m 

thick section of producing tectonic fractures formed over a structural high, over an area of 28

; while Big Sandy Devonian shale, despite having variable thickness, is spread over an area of 

2600 km

and the fracture system is believed to be of regional origin. As it can be seen from Table 

4-4, the difference in reserves between these two shallow, low-pressure fields is dramatic. The 

explanation for such difference is in the horizontal area of the fractured reservoir and in the type 

of fractures found. In Edison, fractures are related to the development of the structural high. As 

such, the fractures are restricted to the size of that structure (7,090 acres). At Big Sandy, however, 

the regional fractures crosscut numerous structures and consequently the area of fracture 

development is very large (650,000 acres). Regional fractures will by definition be developed over 

much larger areas than tectonic fractures, thus giving the potential for larger reserves in Type 1 

fractured reservoirs.

Table 4-4: Examples of producing oil and gas fields by reservoir type. MMBO= million of barrels of oil. Notice that the largest reserves stand in Type 3 reservoirs that 
account for some of the largest fields in the world. Fractures here give the voluminous flow rates, which make these fields so economic (flow rates often in excess of 
100,000 barrels of oil per day [BOPD]). Type 2 reservoirs have also large reserves when compared to Type 1, which reflects the larger storage volume associated 
with matrix porosity (up to 20–30 percent in the matrix as opposed to up to 1–2 percent in the fractures).  The smallest volumes of HC are encountered in Type 1 
reservoirs, being the largest known field of this type, the Amal field in Lybia. Here the reserves are substantial due to its large thickness and very large aerial extent 
(100,000 acres, 800 ft. thick), as the fracture porosity is close to 1.7% and the matrix has no porosity. Adapted from Nelson,2001.

4.2.6 Seismic Acquisition for Fractured Reservoirs  

During a 3D seismic survey, the main objective is that every subsurface point at the target is 

properly illuminated and has reflected seismic energy with a uniform distribution of source 

receiver offsets, azimuths and incidence angles. Similar to a photographic session in a studio, 

several light sources are required to fully illuminate the subject being photographed so that an 

unblemished and uniformly high resolution image may be possible to capture. The big 

difference between a photographic session and seismic acquisition is that in the later there is a 

continuously variable medium in all directions – Earth. This causes energy not to propagate 

equally in all directions and in many cases the effects of the Earth’s materials cause such 

influence in wave propagation that targets cannot be imaged coherently. 

Fractured reservoirs are an example of a rock medium that causes directional differences in 

the velocity, amplitude, reflection waveform as well as in the phase of the seismic energy. If a 

normal seismic acquisition campaign (Narrow-Azimuth) is implemented, and the inline 

direction is about parallel to the direction of the faults or fractures for example, the final image 

can be poor. To try to solve that problem most surveys try to adjust the inline direction 

perpendicularly to the main structural direction, i.e. perpendicularly to the main faults strike or 

to the fold hinges. The problem arises when those directions are not clearly known or when 

there are several structural trends caused by differently oriented stresses. In such cases Wide-

Azimuth seismic acquisition might be a solution.  

 

The distinction between narrow and wide azimuth surveys is made on the basis of the aspect 

ratio of the recording patch. The aspect ratio is defined as the cross-line dimension of the 

patch divided by the in-line dimension. Recording patches with an aspect ratio of less than 0.5 

are considered narrow azimuth, while recording patches with an aspect ratio of greater than 

0.5 are wide azimuth (Figure 4-25). Wide-Azimuth acquisition is considered superior to narrow-

azimuth in the aspects of image resolution, coherent noise attenuation as well as in other 

characteristics mentioned below, and that are directly related to fracture imaging (Cordsen 

and Galbraith, 1999):

Figure 4-25: Example of Wide-Azimuth VS Narrow- Azimuth patches. Wide-Azimuth patch consists of 12 
lines with 60 stations per line, and Narrow-Azimuth patch of 6 lines with 120 stations each (Cordsen and 
Galbraith, 1999). 

 
 
Imaging: By using single fold 3D data sets with limited extent (e.g. a cross-spread or a shot 

gather) Vermeer, 1999, proved that the resolution was dependent on the position of the 

output point with respect to the centre of the data set. This way, by limiting the extent in one 

direction (cross-line) it was possible to obtain different resolutions in the in-line and cross-line 

directions. Combining such data sets did not change these resolution properties. The final 

combined result therefore shows variations in resolution that depend on the period of overlap 

of the data sets and the in-line and cross-line offsets of the basic data set (e.g. shot). Clearly 

the best results are obtained from a square patch (equal in-line and cross-line offsets), which is 

the configuration closer to the wide-azimuth patch. Spatial continuity can be enhanced by 

maximizing the extent of the basic data set in all directions. 

Another consideration is that a 3-D shot recorded by a wide patch receives more widespread 

signal (specular reflections) than a narrow patch. Thus for areal geometries, a wide patch 

forms more consistent (artifact free) images than a narrow 

 
Azimuths: The azimuth dependent trace count proves the more even distribution of source 

receiver pairs for the wide patch (Figure 4-26). The rose diagram (Figure 4-27), where colour 

indicates the multiplicity of the occurrence of a particular source–receiver pair (in offset and 

azimuth distribution), is extremely focused for the narrow azimuth patch, and shows that for 

the wide patch the source-receiver pairs are much more distributed.

than narrow-azimuth (Cordsen and Galbraith, 1999). 

 
 

AVO: If azimuthal anisotropy is present in an AVO response, for example in a fractured rock 

(with variable oriented fractures) a narrow patch would merely give consistent AVO 

measurements in one direction of the survey and not measure the anisotropy in other 

azimuths. Therefore anisotropy (which means AVO response due to some fractures with 

certain orientations) might go undetected with a narrow azimuth patch. These cases of 

anisotropical AVO’s may require higher fold so that there is sufficient fold in each azimuth slice 

for reliable AVO estimation. Only a wide patch would allow such operation.

Wide-Azimuth for fracture detection 

It is widely known that in naturally fractured reservoirs, permeability and therefore production 

can be controlled by fracture networks. These fractures are typically small, sub-vertical and 

well below the resolution of the seismic, so they are not directly observable (SEAL case). 

However, the cumulative effect of these small aligned fractures is measurable through the 

azimuthal variation of seismic attributes. Attributes, such as amplitude, velocity and 

impedance, can be correlated with available fracture data from wells. Literature often 

mentions the direct relationship between the magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy, fracture 

intensity and permeability. This can be used to derive seismic based fracture intensity 

estimates across fields. As it was stated previously, only wide-azimuth seismic is capable of 

dealing with situations like these. Seismic azimuthal anisotropy analysis can either be 

performed for specific horizons, or volumetrically for a much larger subsurface interval. The 

results can be visualized in a number of ways, and displays using anisotropy vectors are 

particularly intuitive, making them a powerful tool for interpretation (Figure 4-29).

faults in black.  Well data is shown with the mud-loss points in yellow indicative of permeable fracture 
zones. Outlined in red is the known conductive fracture corridor which correlates with high anisotropy 
intensity values and in green an area of low fracture intensity. Without the use of Wide-Azimuth 
acquisition it would not have been possible to produce such map. Source: CGG Veritas. 

 
 
Despite allowing for better imaging (Figure 4-28) it is true that a wide-azimuth survey is more 

expensive than a narrow azimuth due to all of the acquisition structure that is needed to do it. 

But it is also true that it will add much new information. This means that the information VS 

cost equation needs to be considered having in mind that any information is only useful if its 

value is greater than its cost. There is always pressure on saving money but this must be 

balanced against the need to solve the problem. It is also important to remember that 

acquisition costs are greater than processing costs, and that technical advances in processing 

can get more out of the data. However processing does not make miracles. If the data is not 

acquired properly and imaging is not good, not even the best processing technology will solve 

the problem.   At the end the reality is that “the most expensive 3-D seismic acquisition is one 

that does not meet its objectives” (Cordsen and Galbraith, 1999).

4.2.7 Seismic Processing For Fractured Reservoirs 

Seismic acquisition is not a zero-offset operation, i.e. source and receivers are at different 

locations, rock layers are not flat and, unlike sonar, the seismic energy is not directed in the 

Earth. Hence, when a geophysicist views the recorded energy from the receiver, he can only 

view the energy that was recorded at that location, but has no way of determining where it 

came from in the subsurface. Because of this, seismic data needs to be processed to create an 

accurate image of the subsurface. Apart from the processing steps to suppress noise and 

enhance signal and resolutuin, such as filtering and deconvolution, there is the need to 

geometrically correct the data, i.e., geometrically reposition the returning signals to show an 

event where it is being hit by the seismic wave rather than where it is being recorded– this 

process is called migration. Migration improves the spatial disposition of the reflecting layers 

and hence achieves ‘Imaging’. There are two main types of migration: Post-Stack Migration 

and Pre-Stack Migration.  

 

Post-Stack Migration: Post-stack migration is the migration done on stacked section (traces 

are stacked before migration) as indicated by its name. This migration is based on the idea that 

all data elements represent either primary reflection or diffractions. This is done by using an 

operation involving the rearrangement of seismic information so that reflections and 

diffractions are plotted at their true locations.  

 

Pre-Stack Migration: When the subsurface structure is complex, with significant dip variations, 

and velocity variation is also complex, reflection events are not hyperbolic and the stacking 

process does not work very well. Therefore, post stack migration will not give clear results. 

Pre-stack migration, as the name suggests, is done on pre stack data i.e. on CMP gathers and 

can be done in time or depth domain.  

Pre-stack migration is applied only when the layers being observed have complicated velocity 

and dip profiles, or when the structures are just too complex to see with post-stack migration. 

It is an important tool in modelling salt diapirs because of their complexity and this has 

immediate benefits if the resolution can pick up any hydrocarbons trapped by diapirs.  

Pre-stack migration is applied to avoid amplitude distortions due to CMP smearing and non-

hyperbolic move out. Hence, Pre-stack Time or Depth migration is a valuable tool in imaging 

seismic data. In the past, the main constraints on prestack migration were the computation 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 61 

requirement the time and skill required to construct velocity model within a reasonable time. 

Advances in computing technology and formation of new migration algorithms have eased 

these constraints. 

 

Pre-Stack Migration VS Post-Stack Migration – Fractured Basement Case 

When the subsurface structures are simple, post-stack migration works well. But post-stack 

migration is not faithful in areas with complex geology and complex variations in velocities. 

Pre-stack migration is a better imaging tool which works quite well in areas with complex 

structures and complex velocities.  

Relative to the Fractured Basement in Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam, Huy Ngoc and Quoc QuanThe 

(2011), state that applying state of the art “acquisition and processing technology such as 

Kirchhoff and Beam Anisotropic Pre-stack Depth Migration could provide good imaging not 

only for top of the basement but also for faults inside the basement”. Also in the website of 

Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (http://www.jogmec.go.jp), it is clearly stated 

that “PSDM is a model-based seismic imaging methodology that works well for complex 

geological structures such as subsalt layers and basement fractures”. 

The above examples prove that using Pre-Stack Migration, especially in Depth domain largely 

improves seismic imaging for Fractured Basement contexts.

4.2.8 Drilling Strategies in Naturally Fractured Reservoirs 

4.2.8.1 Directional Drilling 

Traditional exploration drilling practices are based on three premises: targeting the structural 

crest; maintain a vertical borehole; and drilling over-balanced for safety reasons. All three 

drilling practices may threaten success in naturally fractured reservoirs simply because well 

and reservoir flow depends on flow through natural fractures (Ehlig-Economides and 

Mohamed Taha, 2000). 

The vertical stress from the overburden represents the largest of the three present day in situ 

stress directions (the minimum being one of the horizontal directions), which means that most 

horizontal, or near horizontal fractures will tend to close (an example of such are those 

generated by thrust faulting), and most open – and therefore most productive –natural 

fractures have their planes perpendicular to the minimum stress direction, i.e. they are vertical 

or sub-vertical. Thus, what are the probabilities of intercepting a vertical fracture with a 

vertical well? Very slim, simply because a vertical well trajectory will be parallel to most of 

those fractures, and hence productivity will be low. A very simple example is shown in Figure 

4-30. 

If the reservoir we are dealing is of Type 3 or 4 – where most of the storage volume is in the 

rock matrix – although not the best option, a vertical well would probably still be able to 

present a reasonable productivity. But if we face a Type 1 or 2 reservoir – where fractures 

supply the porosity and permeability in Type 1 and permeability paths in Type 2 – drilling 

directional wells at an angle from vertical in a direction normal to fracture planes and parallel 

to the minimum in situ stress, where most fractures can be intersected is the recommend 

strategy by most authors (e.g. Nelson, 2001; Aguilera, 1995, Ehlig-Economides, 2000). In terms 

of wellbore stability, directional wells should not be a problem in most basins, because the 

borehole will be encircled by approximately balanced stresses from the overburden and the 

maximum horizontal stress (scenario for relaxed basins).

Figure 4-31: Schematic representation of an hypothetical set of wells in a fractured reservoir context. 
Notice that both Well 1 and 2 were done vertically, but only Well 1 intercepted a fracture (probably by a 
very lucky strike). Well 3, in its turn was deviated when reached the reservoir interval, and consequently 
intersected a much larger area of fractures (Aguilera, 1983). 

 

 

4.2.8.2 Underbalanced Drilling 

In traditional drilling procedures, the usual practice is to maintain the weight of the mud at such 

value that the hydrostatic pressure of the mud column exceeds the pressure of the fluids in the 

penetrated formations. This differential pressure towards the formation prevents formation fluids 

to flow into the wellbore, potentially causing a blow-out. This drilling practice usually alters the 

fluid content of the formation near the wellbore, due to the dislocation of the original fluids in the 

pores by the filtrate in a process known as invasion.   



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 64 

Most water base muds contain solids in suspension, apart from chemicals in solution. When the 

mud tries to flow into the pores of the wellbore rock, usually only the filtrate enters, leaving a 

deposit – the mud cake – on the face of the rock. In fractured formations this may not be true. 

Literature frequently mentions that when natural fractures are encountered in an overbalanced 

drilling condition, drilling fluids, including solids, penetrate deep into the most open fractures – 

the most productive – and the drilling fluid filtrate penetrates the matrix rock facing the invaded 

fractures. Besides the danger of losing well control due to lost circulation, the main sources of 

productivity are damaged, possibly permanently. An alternative to this method is to drill at 

balanced or underbalanced conditions, with better results achieved with the second method.  

In underbalanced drilling the pressure exerted on the well is less than, or equal to, that of the 

reservoir. It is performed with a light-weight drilling mud that applies less pressure than 

formation pressure preventing the mud to penetrate the formation and avoiding formation 

damage. This negative differential pressure between the reservoir and the wellbore induces 

production of formation fluids and gases, i.e. flow from the reservoir is driven into the wellbore 

rather than away from it in contrast to conventional drilling (Figure 4-31). 

 

There are four main techniques to achieve “underbalance” while drilling a well 

(http://www.rigzone.com):  

 

Lightweight drilling fluids: This is the simplest way to reduce wellbore pressure. Fluids such as 

fresh water, diesel and lease crude are used instead of the heavy mud. However, in most 

reservoirs the pressure in the wellbore cannot be reduced enough to achieve “underbalance” by 

this technique.  

 

Injecting gas down the drillpipe: this involves adding air or nitrogen to the drilling fluid that is 

pumped directly down the drillpipe. This technique can be used in wells not specifically designed 

for underbalanced drilling and improves penetration rates. On the other hand, there is a risk of 

overbalance conditions during shut-in and very specific tools of measurement while drilling 

(MWD) have to be used which may increase the costs. 

 Note: In air drilling a faster up hole volume is needed because cuttings will fall faster down 

 the annulus when the compressors are taken off the hole compared to having a higher 

 viscosity fluid in the hole, at the same time, because air is compressible, Measure While 

 Drilling (MWD) tools which require an incompressible fluid cannot work. Common 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 65 

 technologies used to eliminate this  problem are either electromagnetic MWD tools or 

 wireline MWD tools which are less  common and more expensive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   Conventional Drilling    Underbalanced Drilling 

 
Figure 4-32: Conventional drilling, with drilling fluid and fines flowing into the reservoir VS. Underbalanced 
drilling, with formation fluids flowing from the reservoir (Lyons, 2009). 

 
 

Gas injection via parasite string: here, a second pipe is run outside of the intermediate casing. This 

increases both the drilling costs and the time it takes to drill the well. However this technique 

applies constant bottom-hole pressure and requires no operational differences or unique MWD 

systems. 

 

Nitrogen foam: this method is less damaging to formations that exhibit water sensitivities, and 

the safety index is much greater when compared to other methods (nitrogen is inert and 

eliminating the possibility of down-hole fires). The problem resides in the additional nitrogen 

needed to generate stable foam, which makes this technique very costly. At the same time it can 

only be used in wells measuring less than 3600m deep due to temperature limitations. 

 

In sum, Underbalanced Drilling has two main objectives (Leading Edge Training Manual, 2002):  

1. Maximising hydrocarbon recovery 

2. Minimising drilling problems 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 66 

1. Maximising hydrocarbon recovery 

 

• Reduced formation damage: there is no invasion of solids or mud filtrate into the reservoir 

formation, which means that the lithological characteristics of geological formations will be 

preserved 

• Early production: Well is producing as soon as the reservoir is penetrated with a bit which 

could be a disadvantage if hydrocarbon production cannot be handled or stored on site or if 

the required export lines are not available, but if the correct procedures are executed then 

this will avoid doing post-drill evaluation tests such as Drill Stem Tests (DST’s – See 

Appendix) and save funds. 

• Reduced Stimulation: Stimulation procedures such as acid wash are proved to reduce the 

productivity of the reservoir. In underbalanced drilling, as there is no filtrate or solids 

invasion, the need for reservoir stimulation is eliminated. 

• Enhanced recovery: The combined effect of the higher productivity of underbalanced wells 

with the ability to drill infill wells in depleted fields, makes possible the recovery of 

bypassed hydrocarbons, which can significantly extend the life of a field.  

 

2. Minimising drilling problems 

 

• Higher rate of penetration: with less pressure at the bottom of the wellbore, it is easier for 

the drill bit to cut and remove rock. 

• Reduced probability of lost circulation: when the well is drilled underbalanced, mud will 

not enter the formation and the problem can be avoided. 

• Elimination of differential sticking: differential sticking is when the drill pipe is pressed 

against the wellbore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, 

while the rest will continue to be pushed by wellbore pressure. As a result the pipe 

becomes stuck to the wall, and can require thousands of pounds of force to remove, which 

may prove impossible. Because the reservoir pressure is greater than the wellbore pressure 

in UBD, the pipe is pushed away from the walls, eliminating differential sticking. 

• Extending the life of the drill bit: drilling gases cool the bit while quickly removing cuttings 

allowing for a longer usage.

 67 

In terms of costs, underbalanced drilling is always more expensive than a regular overbalanced 

well. The costs vary with the complexity of the reservoir and the consequent sophistication of the 

equipment required on the surface separation and data acquisition system. The reservoir fluids 

dictate the required separation equipment and the reservoir pressure dictate the pressure control 

equipment requirements as well as the gas lift requirements (Leading Edge Advantage, 2002). 

 

Leading Edge Advantage (2002) considers that a value of 10% of the well cost is the additional 

cost required for underbalanced drilling by comparing a number of operations in Europe, Canada 

and the middle East. They also define a rule of thumb to easily evaluate if the costs will be high or 

low: if the well is expensive because of the complex reservoir geometry, it is likely that the 

underbalanced drilling equipment will also have to be suited to the complex drilling systems 

required. If a simple vertical well is required in a homogeneous reservoir then the well costs as well 

as the UBD costs can be low.  

 

In terms of productivity, they consider that if a multi-well development can be drilled successfully 

underbalanced the reduction in well count (the number of wells drilled to achieve a certain 

productivity) could be as high as 25% as a result of the increased productivity. This benefit 

outweighs the obstacles and cost of underbalanced drilling significantly.

5. NATURALLY FRACTURED BASEMENT RESERVOIRS A PROVEN 

WORLDWIDE PLAY 
 

Naturally fractured reservoirs are often ignored due to the increased difficulty in exploration 

techniques. This is even more evident when the cases are basement reservoirs. Despite being 

known within the hydrocarbon industry for many years, naturally fractured basement reservoirs 

are generally regarded as non-productive and they have failed to draw the attention of the 

explorationist. These reservoirs are often seen as ‘of no economic potential’, and their 

investigation by exploratory drilling has been left to chance. This section is dedicated to 

demonstrate that these types of reservoirs have an underexplored potential, even though they 

are commonly distributed in various petroliferous regions throughout the world with many 

successful cases. 

 

Before any consideration is made on how to explore Basement reservoirs, it is important to define 

the concept of Basement: 

Berkley University Geological Glossary: The oldest rocks in a given area; a complex of 

metamorphic and igneous rocks that underlies the sedimentary deposits. Usually Precambrian or 

Paleozoic in age. 

 

Wikipedia: rocks below a sedimentary platform or cover, or more generally any rock 

below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. 

 

Landes (1960): basement rocks are considered as any metamorphic or igneous rocks (regardless of 

age) which are unconformably overlain by a sedimentary sequence.   

 

P’na (1982): considers two definitions of basement related to HC exploration: 

1) metamorphic and igneous rocks (regardless of age) that are unconformably overlain by a 

younger oil-generating formation (source rock). The oil, which is generated from the 

overlying sediments, is stored in the older metamorphic and igneous rocks.  

2) any rock that unconformably underlies oil generating or oil-bearing formations. 

 

Aguilera (1980, 1995): does not consider sandstones and carbonates as basement rock, even if 

they conformably underlie oil-bearing or oil-generating formations. 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 69 

North (1990): considers basement rocks to include those of sedimentary origin, if they have 

essentially little or no matrix porosity. He states that ‘basement’ should not be compared with 

‘Precambrian’ and that basement rock may have considerable fracture porosity due to 

deformation, weathering or both. 

 

From the above paragraphs, we can conclude that the definition of basement rock is very broad, 

and like most other definitions it depends on the objective and scientific context of the author 

who is giving the definition. Some authors consider basement rock only if it’s not of sedimentary 

origin (igneous or metamorphic), but others also include sedimentary rocks if they have little or 

no matrix porosity. From this it is obvious that the essential characteristic that a rock must have to 

be considered basement, is the inexistence or the very low matrix porosity. Adding to this it forms 

an unconformity with the above sedimentary sequence and it may or not be of Precambrian or 

Paleozoic age. In SEAL, the basement is a metamorphic rock, unconformably lying below a 

sedimentary sequence and dated from the Pre-Cambrian. For this reason this author considers 

Landes definition as the most accurate for the present study. 

 

Commercial, naturally fractured basement oil deposits have been found largely by accident, when 

looking for other types of reservoir (Aguilera, 1980; Landes et al, 1960). The proof of this 

accidental success is that in the Western countries, all the oil fields that produce from crystalline 

basements were discovered when aiming for other formations. Furthermore, most naturally 

fractured reservoirs (sandstones, carbonates, cherts, shales and not just basement reservoirs) 

were discovered by accident (Aguilera, 1995, Russell, 1995). In Russia and in other countries from 

the former USSR however, drilling into crystalline basements has been carried out intentionally 

(Kenney et al., 1996) for a long time. 

Landes et al.; (1960) considers that basement rock oil accumulations shouldn’t be considered 

rarities to be found solely by chance but are normal concentrations of hydrocarbons obeying the 

rules of origin, migration and entrapment. Therefore, in areas of not too deep basement, oil 

deposits should be sought with the same professional skill and zeal as accumulations in the 

overlying sediments.

5.1 FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS FOR HC ACCUMULATION IN BASEMENT ROCKS  

Like in any other HC reservoir, there a number of favourable conditions that a basement rock 

reservoir should have and that are mentioned by several authors (Gutmanis et al., 2005; Aguilera, 

several articles; Landes et al., 1960):  

Regional Unconformity: because basement rock is not a reservoir rock by nature, i.e. it usually has 

low porosity and permeability; the hydrocarbons have to be present in a typical reservoir rock 

(clastic, carbonate) or in the source rock itself before migrating into the basement. For this reason 

basement reservoirs have to underlie a regional unconformity. All basement reservoirs known 

comply with this and almost all lie on an uplift or high. This uplift or high was generally 

continuously uplifted for long periods of geologic time and was subject to a long period of 

weathering and erosion, which sculptured hills in the basement rock and created the differential 

geomorphology. Younger sediments, which act as hydrocarbon sources, either flank or directly 

overlie basement providing the opportunity for entrapment of oil in the basement rock. These 

younger sediments may either be a reservoir rock to where HC have migrated, or even the source 

rock as in Yemen, where in the Habban field,  Khulan Formation intraformational shales provide 

the source of the HC. 

 

Seal: It is important that the reservoir is overlain by a seal. In most cases the cap rock for 

basement accumulations is a relatively tight sedimentary rock (Sergipe-Alagoas case, where the 

seal is formed by Ibura Mb. anhydrite). However, at the Mara field in Venezuela, a tight zone 

within the basement rock may act as the seal. At the other extreme is the situation in several 

California fields where a thick oil column extends from an oil-water interface within the 

basement rock upward through a continuous reservoir, which includes such permeable material 

as wash and basal sandstone, until a tight rock is reached somewhere above the base of the 

sedimentary section, Landes et al (1960). 

 

Migration: As in any other reservoir, a migration path as to exist. As most basement rocks are 

hard and brittle with very low matrix permeability, the migration route occurs through higher 

permeability sedimentary units, active faults and the basement/sedimentary cover interface, into 

the basement (Figure 5-1). There are three most common possible sources for oil accumulation in 

basement reservoirs:  

1. Overlying organic rock from which oil is expelled downward during compaction. 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 71 

2. Lateral, off-the-basement, but topographically lower, organic rock. The oil is then squeezed 

from this rock, into an underlying carrier bed through which it migrates up dip into the 

basement rock, or directly into the Basement 

3. Lower, lateral reservoirs from which earlier trapped oil is spilled due to tilting or overfilling. 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Figure 5-1: probable basement migration routes at the Rona Ridge, West of Shetland, and UKCS. Notice the 
lateral migration of the HC (signed by the red arrows) from the sedimentary sequence that unconformably 
lies over and at the sides of the Basement (Gutmanis, 2009; modified from Grant et al., 1999) 

 

Reservoir: Reservoir space is also needed. In most basement rocks matrix porosity is close to 

zero, and reservoir quality depends on the development of secondary porosity, which in most 

cases is given by the fractures. The degree of reservoir space, i.e. fracture porosity, depends on 

the mechanical properties of the host rock and on the applied stress over that rock.

5.2 WORLDWIDE EXAMPLES OF FRACTURED BASEMENT RESERVOIRS 

There are examples of Fractured Basement reservoirs all around the globe. Most reservoirs are 

granitic, volcanic or gneissic; rocks with brittle behaviour which contributes for the formation of 

fractures. Below are some examples that this author considers important due to their similarity to 

the SEAL Basin Fractured Basement, to their good production rates or operational procedures. It is 

important to highlight however that SEAL Basement rock is described as being a micashist, which, 

by its semi-ductile behaviour, is less prone to fracturing than brittle rocks. For a more complete 

list of Fractured Basement reservoirs please refer to Gutmanis and Batchelor, 2005; from where 

these examples were taken. 

 

China 

Yaerxia Oil Field: located in the Jiuxi Basin it was the first basement reservoir in China. The 

production comes from fractures in the Quannaogou Formation, a Paleozoic hard phylite, slate 

and meta-sandstone. The production from the wells ranged from around 70 bbl/day to 1050 

bbl/day.  

Dong Sheng Pu Buried Hill Reservoir: it is a metamorphic basement rock which started to produce 

in 1983 with a production of aroud 1300 bbls/day. By December 1987, there were 14 active 

producers and one observation well with cumulative volumes of oil and gas of around 7 MMbo 

and 2.3 Bcf respectively. With water injection, oil production rates varied between 7300 bbl/day 

and 11500 bbl/day which relates to an estimated cumulative oil production, at the end of the 

field's production life, of 160 MMbo. 

 

Georgia 

Ninotsiminda Field: Located 25 km east of Tbilisi, and discovered in 1979, the Ninotsminda Field 

represents the largest remaining oil accumulation in Georgia. It is an anticlinal trap, with 

production mainly from the fractured Middle Eocene volcaniclastics. The reservoir is 

underpressured at 0.38 psi/ft, and is dominated by sub-vertical micro and macro fractures that 

concentrate mainly in the hinge area of the fold. 

In 2000, a vertical well was drilled into the oil producing formation, with production tests 

stabilising at a flow of 200 bbl/day. In 2003 an appraisal horizontal well was drilled in 2003, this 

increasing the production to 2200 bbl/day. The area is being extensively developed by the NOC

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 73 

(Ninotsminda Oil Company), with a 5 well prospect likely to increase production from 2000 to 

4500 bbl/d (Durglishvili et al., 2004). 

 

Libya 

Nafoora-Augila Field: this is one of the main giant fields in the Sirte Basin, and on of the primary 

oil producing reservoirs is the basement granite. This reservoir is said to produce at rates that 

range from 1200 bbl/day to 14,000 bbl/day.  

 

Hungary 

In Hungary, hydrocarbon reservoirs within fractured and weathered zones of crystalline 

basements are of great importance, as the majority of hydrocarbon reserves found in recent years 

have come from this type of reservoirs. These metamorphic hydrocarbon-bearing formations are 

generally characterised by complex lithology, low porosity and a heterogeneous distribution of 

pore sizes and fractures (Kiss &amp;amp; Tóth, 1985). 

 

Thailand 

Sirikit Oil Field: The Sirikit field lies in the Phitsanulok Basin, one of a series of Tertiary rift-related 

structures in central and northern Thailand. About 14 wells had been drilled into the pre-Tertiary 

basement  to 1995. Many had oil shows and two have been placed under production. The Field 

has produced about 1.17 MMbo of oil from basement so far (November 1998).  Smitt, 1998, has 

presented a fracture simulation model using Frame and Poly3D sofwares to predict the fracture 

patterns in the basement. No information on how this impacted the reservoir production was 

found. 

 

Venezuela 

Mara Oil Field: lying Northeast of La Paz, Mara oil field used to be considered, the “champion” of 

Basement producers (Landes, 1959). The complex basement is composed of metamorphic and 

igneous rocks, with hydrocarbon storage exclusively in fractures (Landes, 1959). By 1956, the 

Mara field was producing from 29 wells in the basement reservoir at na average depth of 1,190 ft 

(363 m). Initial production was about 2,700 bbl/day but one well produced 17,000 bbl/day from 

the basement (Landes et al, 1960).

Vietnam - Cuu Long Basin  

Vietnam is one of the countries where oil and gas production from basement reservoirs are most 

important. Cuu Long Basin is estimated to contain 30% of the country’s hydrocarbon reserves, 

and presently it represents 95% of production, with 85% being produced from the fractured 

basement (Figure 5-2).  

 

Bach Ho Field: Vietnam's most important offshore asset is the Bach Ho field which generated over 

50 MMbbo in 1996 (Anon, 1997). This field is at a depth of 5,000 m, of which 4,000 m is fractured 

basement granite with a pay zone interval of 1,000 m (Russell, 1997). Production rates are listed 

at 202,000 bbl/day in September 2004 (see PES.GB, Jan. 2005). The volume in place has been 

recently calculated at 1.59 billion barrels of oil, with around 95% of this amount contained within 

the fractured basement. 

 

Dai Hung Field: was discovered in 1988, and is now operated by Vietsovpetro following transfer of 

ownership from BHP Billiton in 2000. The field contains significant accumulations of oil and gas in 

a fractured granitic basement (up to 730 MMbo of oil), sourcing from lacustrine shales. Current 

production is 22.9 MMbo/day of gas and 1385 bbl/day of oil.

Yemen 

With hydrocarbons being discovered in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs, Yemen 

has attracted the interest of the oil industry in the last few years.  

 

SOCO is currently developing the East Shabwa Block 10/10A, with four deviated appraisal wells 

having been drilled since August 2004. The primary drilling target was the fractured basement, 

with secondary targets lying in the overlying sedimentary sequence. Current production of the 

East Shabwa Development Area is 27,800 bbl/day, with around 30% of this figure being produced 

from the basement. 

 

DNO have also had significant successes in onshore Block 43. The  Nabrajah wells have primarily 

targeted both the Qishn Formation sandstone and the Kohlan Formation dolomite, however 

significant hydrocarbons have also been discovered in the basement. Production tests carried out 

in the basement resulted in 5800 bbl/day of 38.6º API crude and 4162 Mscf/day of gas using an 

ESP. Following a pressure build-up test, flow was 2812 bbl/day of 41.9º API crude, and 3054 

Mscf/day of gas with no pumping. Oil is also being produced from the basement in the 

neighbouring Blocks 10 and 14 (operated by TotalFinaElf and Nexen respectively) (see DNO press-

release, 13/04/05).  

 

OMV is operating Block 2, Block S2 and Block 29 in the onshore Yemen. Block S2, located in 

Sab’atayn basin had major discoveries in the fractured basement, which gave origin to the 

Habban Field.

5.3 SEAL BASEMENT FRACTURED RESERVOIR 

SEAL Basement fractured reservoir complies with most of the above conditions: 

 

Presence of a regional unconformity: The Basement rock in the SEAL basin is of Pre-Cambrian age 

(see Section 4 for details), and unconformably underlies a Mesozoic sedimentary sequence, as it 

can be seen by the analysis of the seismic lines (Figures 6-4 and 6-20). 

 

 

Proven presence of sedimentary reservoir rock with stored HC flanking and/or overlying the 

Basment rock: Carmopolis Mb. from Muribeca Fm. is an alluvial fan deposit and it is the main 

producing horizon in the area. Block-B is cut by the south part of Carmópolis Oil field which 

proves the presence of this sedimentary unit in the area.  

 

Presence of an effective migration path and sealing effectiveness: the presence of the Ibura Mb. 

in the seven drilled wells and the positive results of those wells – with HC presence in all of them 

– prove that there is an effective sealing capacity and that HC are migrating into the Basement 

rock.  

Reservoir space: the presence of open fractures, registered by the FMI, and the fact that the best 

results from the seven wells were registered in the Basement rock – a micashist with very low to 

inexistent matrix porosity and permeability – proves that this rock possesses reservoir space. Even 

though the fact that direct measurements of this reservoir space (porosity and permeability 

assessment) were not possible to make, quantifying it becomes an imprecise task.  

 

It is important to stress for future reference that this author considers that SEAL Basment 

Fractured Reservoir should be classified as a Type 1 reservoir, as no evidence of matrix porosity 

was found in the data acquired to the present.

6. APPLICATION OF THE NFR WORKFLOW ON SEAL FRACTURED 

BASEMENT 
 

 

In 2005 GALP acquired a set of exploration blocks located in Sergipe-Alagoas Basin – Sergipe Sub-

Basin. What started to be a traditional exploration campaign, revealed the presence of a Naturally 

Fractured Reservoir (NFR), and in particular a fractured metamorphic basement rock, when, after 

drilling seven wells, the best results were registered in this formation. This Section is dedicated to 

the analysis of the SEAL Fractured Basement Play, using the worlflow presented in the previous 

section as a guideline. 

 

 

6.1 FRACTURE SYSTEM PROPERTIES 

As shown in Section 4, identifying the fracture system can be done by using several sources of 

information: well data, outcrops, regional geology and seismic. These will then give information 

on the properties that affect the reservoir performance and on the fracture system origin, which 

will lead ultimately to the classification of the reservoir type – Figure 6-1. 

 

 

 

(unfold next page) 

 
Figure 6-1: Initial part of the workflow dedicated to the identification of the Fracture System and to extract 
information about its properties from the available sources (Well Data, Outcrops, Regional Geology and 
Seismic). Seismic processing and Acquisition are not listed here, because in the present case Seismic was 
available for use. As it will be seen ahead, the available seismic may not be the most adequate for the study 
of a NFR such as this, and acquisition and/or processing of new seismic should be considered. Volumes 
calculation and Well design are also excluded as they are going to be considered individually in another 
section.

6.1.1 Outcrop Study 

Despite the fact that several outcrops are present in the area none was studied for the present 

work.  

By its close geographical location relative to the areas of Block-A and Block-B, probably the 

Itabaiana Dome (Section 2) would have been a good area to collect information on lithology of the 

host rock and on fractures. As stated in the previous section, outcrop studies have to be 

conducted with care as most outcropping rocks will be altered by weathering, and probably more 

fractured than the same rock in burial conditions. However they supply very important 

information as a larger volume of rock is available, and apart from cores (which are much more 

expensive), are the only direct contact that the geologist can have with the fractured rock.  

This author considers that in the future some time should be dedicated to the study of the 

outcrops in Itabaiana Dome as they could clarify some doubts that remain unclear, even after the 

present study was conducted. 

 

 

6.1.2 Regional Geology 

The information that can be taken from the analysis of the regional geology is available in the 

literature, and it was presented in Section 2. From there we can conclude on the stress regimes 

that the Basin was subjected to – Figure 6-2. Presently the most accepted theory was proposed by 

Chagas, 1996. This was the premise used for geomechanical modelling which will be presented 

ahead.

By the analysis of the local geological maps, using the information available in the literature about 

the SEAL basement and the information from the wells (where lithology is described as phylite) 

this author considers that the studied blocks are located over the Vaza Barris Domain – see Figure 

2-12. 

 

6.1.3 Seismic  

The work previously developed for this area had the objective of assessing the blocks’ potential 

and recommend prospects to be drilled. As a result, the wells Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta 

were drilled on Phase I and then, after an evaluation of their results, Phase II was conducted with 

Echo, Fox and Golf wells being drilled. For the present work the interpretation of Phase I will not 

be described because Phase II re-interpretation replaced it and is considered to be more accurate. 

At the same time all the analysis made over the seismic volume for this work was done using the 

Phase II re-interpretation.  

 

Interpretation Workflow 

An analysis of the existing interpretation (Phase I interpretation) was carried out to determine 

what needed to be re-interpreted. Apart from the problem of the horizons that had been picked 

on the wrong seismic attributes it was also recognised that, after the drilling of Alpha, Bravo, 

Charlie, and in particular of Delta well, the top of Basement interpretation could be changed so 

that in the structural lows, this formation could be deeper than previously thought, allowing the 

deposition of Carmópolis sandstones in the paleo-valeys. The importance of this formation for 

this play was described in Section 2. The current interpretation does not contemplate this 

formation as it is unclear as to what seismic reflector it is represented by. This is due to its low 

thickness which causes it to be below seismic resolution. Probably with better quality data, 

Spectral Decomposition would allow us to detect it.  

At this time, Basement was considered as the main objective, and as a result of this analysis and 

of time constraints, it was decided to re-interpret only the top of the Ibura Mb. and the top of 

Basement. At a later stage, the base of the Calumbi Fm. horizon was interpreted for depth 

conversion purposes only, with the objective of giving another control for the velocity model. 

However, this horizon has some interpretation problems, especially in the area of the Bravo well. 

The faults were extensively reviewed.

 80 

Interpretation followed the regular workflow and it was undertaken in Seisworks?: faults were 

interpreted initially followed by the horizon interpretation over the time volume. Inevitably, some 

faults were reviewed or interpreted during the horizon interpretation. A Structure Cube (Figure 6-

6) was created and used only as a guide for fault interpretation due to the low S/N ratio (Figure 6-

3) of the seismic data which lead the interpretation to take longer than expected.  

The horizon interpretation started around the wells area, where a good well-tie was achieved and 

then expanded to the whole area. The Auto-tracking mode was preferentially used relative to 

other tracking options, although this was always limited to reflector continuity. This interpretation 

took longer than initially estimated mainly due to the poor quality data (Figure 6-4),  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6-3: (A) seismic line in Depth for Block SEAL-T-A (C) seismic line in Depth for Block SEAL-T-B. Notice 
the bad seismic quality and the low S-N ratio.   

 

Time-Depth Conversion 

The depth conversion was carried out using the DepthTeam Express
®
 application from Landmark, 

which allows the simultaneous use of seismic velocity cubes, well velocity functions, well picks, 

and corresponding time surfaces (Figure 6-5). The 3D seismic, horizons and faults were converted 

to depth, and maps were then created using the depth converted horizons. 

 

Attributes Extraction 
As stated, the S/N ratio of the available seismic was very low. This conditioned the use of seismic 

attributes for detecting structural features such as faults and fractures. Even though, as part of 

the previously recommend workflow, Coherence, Dip-Azimuth and Dip-Magnitude attributes 

were run. The Coherence attribute is not available in-house.

1. Coherence 

In Seisworks ? coherence is called structure cube. This attribute was run, and the result is 

presented in Figure 6-6. As it can be seen, the low S/N ratio of the seismic caused the 

identification of lineaments to be very difficult. Some faults can be identified when using seismic 

sections together with the structure cube, but no fracture patterns can be identified.

Notice that despite the low S/N ratio, there are still some structures that are visible when using

detected in the depth slices (yellow arrows).

Automatic Fault Extraction Workflow – SEAL Basement Project  

Automatic fault extraction algorithms are proven to reduce interpretation times by as much as 

three times (Silva, et al., 2005). For that reason, apart from the typical seismic interpretation, the 

Fractured Basement Project developed new methodology for automatic fault detection in 

complex geological settings with low quality seismic data. This methodology was developed by 

the Universidade de Aveiro, using the Ant Tracking algorithm existent in Petrel® software.  

 

In nature, ants find the shortest path between their nest and their food source by communicating 

using pheromones, a chemical substance that attracts other ants. The shortest path will be 

marked with more pheromones than the longest path and so the next ant is more likely to choose 

the shortest route, and so on. Ant-Tracking uses this concept as an analogy for fault detection. 

The idea is to distribute a large number of electronic "ants" in a seismic volume; and let each ant 

move along what appears to be a fault surface while emitting "pheromone." Ants deployed along 

a fault should be able to trace the fault surface for some distance before being terminated. 

Surfaces meeting expectations will be strongly marked by "pheromone." Surfaces unlikely to be 

faults will be unmarked or weakly marked. The Ant Tracking algorithm creates a new fault 

attribute highlighting the corresponding fault-surface features having orientations within some 

pre-determined settings. The algorithm automatically extracts the result as a set of fault-patches, 

a highly detailed mapping of discontinuities (Ant-Tracking Manual – Petrel). 

The Classical Ant Tracking workflow comprises three main stages: 1) seismic conditioning; 2) edge 

detection; and 3) edge enhancement (the Ant Tracking cube itself). This standard workflow 

normally achieves good results in areas of low geological complexity and when high quality and 

well migrated seismic data is available, resulting in faults enhanced with a great level of detail. 

However, when the S/N ratio is low, such as in the present case, this workflow has some problems 

in detecting the discontinuities. For that reason a new methodology was created by Universidade 

de Aveiro (Figure 6-9) and the results were then used together with the data extracted from the 

FMI for the geomechanical modelling.

Figure 6-9: Schematic representation of the New proposed Ant Tracking Workflow. Proposed seismic 
attributes are displayed inside boxes and seismic operations are in green (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling 
and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). 

 
 

In the new methodology proposed by the Universidade de Aveiro, a first derivative attribute was 

first calculated over the seismic volume cropped and trimmed by Top Basement horizon. This 

attribute acts as a high-pass filter where low frequencies are attenuated, high frequencies are 

enhanced and any zero-frequency component is suppressed (Figure 6-10). Then, structural 

smoothing was computed over the first derivative seismic cube (Figure 6-11). This increased the 

signal-to-noise ratio of the input seismic data, increasing seismic reflectors’ continuity, while the 

local orientation (dip and azimuth) of the seismic reflectors were honoured, enhancing the 

presence of edges. Finally a variance attribute was calculated. Its calculation results in a new cube 

with information only related with edges (discontinuities in the horizontal continuity of 

amplitudes), such as faults and fractures (Figure 6-12). In complement to the variance attribute a 

data volume with information corresponding to the local dip estimation of seismic reflectors was 

also computed as part of the edge detection step. Local Dip Estimation may be useful to enhance 

the presence of faults, and other discontinuities, as well as to distinguish between different 

seismic textures. In the presence of faults, estimated dip values change abruptly, while along the 

fault planes the estimated dip value remains barely constant (Figure 6-13) (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; 

Modelling and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011).

Figure 6-10: Vertical seismic sections from Block SEAL-A: (A) original seismic and (B) First Derivative 
attribute. The use of the First Derivative attribute enhances seismic reflectors’ continuity and produces an 
increase in the vertical resolution of the data. A 90º-phase rotation appears with the calculation of the 
attribute. (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P 
Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). 

 
 

After all the seismic conditioning steps were completed, Ant-Tracking was applied (Figure 6-14). It 

is noticeable that the final images generated by the Ant-Tracking algorithm greatly improved fault 

detection, when compared to the structure cube generated from the regular seismic volume 

(Figure 6-6).

Figure 6-13: Horizontal time slices from the flatten Local Estimation Dip cubes from: (A) Block 412N and (B) 
Block T-412-429. Black arrows are example of faults, which are better delineated with higher resolution 
using the Dip estimated volume when compared to others (compare for example with figure 3.3). (UNL, 
UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 
2011). 

 

In order to validate the proposed methodology, verification and re-interpretation of the faults originally 
provided by Galp was carried out. This interpretation process was independent from the automatic fault 
detection workflow development and from the faults derived from the automatic fault extraction, in order 
not to bias it. The faults were therefore interpreted exclusively on the original seismic data, using the 
traditional user interpretation, and were considered as “hard data” to validate the Ant Tracking proposed 
methodology, without being influenced by its results (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and 
Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). The results are 
presented in Figure 6-15 and 6-16. In Block-A most of the faults interpreted by U.Aveiro team had been 
already interpreted and received only some minor adjustments. Due to the better seismic quality and to 
more available working time, more faults were interpreted in Block-B, and with better positioning relative 
to the seismic. Figure 6-17 compares the Ant-Tracking cubes generated when the Standard or the U.Aveiro 
Workflow is used. It is easily noticeable that U.Aveiro workflow largely improves fault detection.

From the results presented above (Figure 6-17), the author considers that the U. Aveiro Ant-

Tracking workflow is a valid methodology for improving the seismic data quality and consequent 

fault detection in SEAL basin. The method allows the interpreter to visualize more faults than if 

the Standard Workflow or just manual interpretation is used and it can also be used to have a fast 

overview of the structural framework or as a base to a further and more detailed structural 

interpretation ((UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P 

Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). 

 

Based on his horizon interpretation and on the faults interpreted by the U. Aveiro team a Top 

Basement Horizon depth map, with the main interpreted faults was created. Not all faults are 

displayed, as they would overload the map not allowing for a good understanding. The wells 

displayed were not defined in this map as they were drilled previously to its elaboration.  The final 

product can be found in Figure 7-1. 

 

The interpreted and validated faults were then used for the construction of the Geomechanical 

Model that will be presented ahead.

6.1.4 Well Data  

In well data the geologist can use several sources of information for detecting the fracture system 

and to derive information on its properties. In this section the drilling and testing procedures as 

well as the test results and the Formation Micro Imager (FMI) data for the seven wells performed 

will be analysed. Cores were not taken. Notice that the interpreted seismic sections and depth 

maps shown were made prior to the Fractured Basement Project.  

 

 

6.1.4.1 Well Results Analysis  

 

Alpha Well 

• Primary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Ibura Fm.  

Reservoir: fractured carbonates intercalated with evaporites (anhydrite). 

• Secondary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Calumbi Fm. 

 Reservoir: sand bodies inside the turbidite levels of the Calumbi Fm. 

• Type of Well: Vertical 

• Mud: Conventional mud (8.7- 9 lb/gal) – Phase I 

 Perflex fluid (9.2-9.8 lb/gal) – Phase II 

 Perflex fluid (9.8-10 lb/gal) – Phase III (Mud weight when drilling through Basement) 

 

The Alpha well was a vertical well positioned over a structural high at the Basement level. Figure 

6-18 shows the pre-drill seismic interpretation on which the well location was based. The main 

horizons for the prospect identification (Top Ibura Mb. and Top Basement) are very poorly 

defined due to poor seismic imaging. Table 6-1 shows the comparison between the predicted and 

the actual drilled formation tops.

Mudlog Analysis 

For practical purposes, the mudlog shown in Figure 6-20 only displays the lower section of the 

well, from the Muribeca Fm. to Total Depth (TD). The oil shows found in Calumbi Fm. were not 

considered to be of importance due to the high content of shale in the sections where they were 

found. All the Retrievable Formation Test (RFT) samples made in Calumbi Fm. failed. Shows were 

recorded in the Cotinguiba Fm., but the sampling tests failed to recover any fluid.   

 

The main observations from the mudlog analysis are: 

• Oil shows were found from the top of the Muribeca Fm. (-878m) to TD.  

• Gas peaks were registered in Muribeca Fm. at 883/890m, 918m/920m and the most 

important at 957m/970m (Lower Ibura Fm., Top of Basement). 

• The Ibura Fm. did not contain as much anhydrite as expected, but the presence of 

carbonates levels were confirmed. 

• The best oil shows were recorded at the base of the Ibura Fm. and Top Basement. 

• Oil shows were recorded in the Basement down to a depth of approximately 1040m.

Wireline Logging  

Alpha Well was drilled in two phases. It was first drilled to 1000m and logging tools were run 

(including FMI). However, observations from the wireline logs indicate that zones of interest are 

not identified in when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-21). The FMI identified fractures 

along Oiteirinhos and Ibura Members and at the Basement and to test this interval, DST-01 was 

conducted. Due to the good results of the DST (See Appendix) it was decided to drill ahead (to 

actual TD) and test again (DST-02). Unfortunately, wireline tools were not run again not allowing 

for correlation between DST-02 and petrophysical properties or, even more important, with the 

images that the FMI could have recorded.

DST Results Analysis: Alpha Well  

The DST procedures for this well were not performed according to the conventional procedures 

outlined in the Appendix of this thesis, as only one cycle was undertaken (Figures 6-22 and 6-23). 

As a result, it is difficult to make valid conclusions on the reservoir properties of the interval which 

was tested. The first cycle should have been performed as a clean up of the well, so that the 

actual pressure behaviour of the formations being tested could be registered on the second cycle. 

However, based on graphic analysis of the test result, it can be seen that reverse circulation 

started prior to Static Pressure Stabilization (SP). The pressure build-up period only lasted for two 

hours, time during which the formation pressure did not stabilize. Two observations can be made 

about this: 

• The build-up time was very short, therefore making it difficult to make conclusive 

observations on the reservoir permabilities. 

• It would appear that the interval’s porosity is very tight and the pressure would have taken a 

extremely long time to recover based on the graphic rate of recovery.

Bravo well was a slightly deviated vertical well positioned over a Basement level structural high.  

Figure 6-24 shows the seismic interpretation made for the well positioning. The main horizons for 

the prospect identification (Top Ibura Mb. and Top Basement) are very poorly defined due to poor  

seismic imaging. Table 6-2 shows the comparison between the predicted and the actual drilled 

formation tops.

Mudlog Analysis  

For practical purposes the mudlog shown below displays only one section at Calumbi Fm. (Figure 

6-26) and another from the Muribeca Fm. to TD (Figure 6-27).  

 

Main observations from the log analysis: 

• In the Calumbi Fm. oil shows occurred from 535m to 570m and from 600m to 610m 

within sand prone sections (Figure 6-26(A)). MDT tests were performed in these zones 

(Table 6-3). Wireline logs demonstrated that the intervals had good reservoir 

characteristics (Figure 6-26(B)), but were too thin to be considered for future production. 

• Some minor oil shows were found in the Riachuelo Fm. but these were considered 

irrelevant due to the high content of shale in the Formation. 

• Shows were also recorded from 884m to 1070m, in Muribeca Fm. and the Basement.  The 

best were at the top of Ibura Mb. (Muribeca Fm.) and in the transition between this and 

the Basement (Figure 6-27).

Wireline Logging  

The analysis of the wireline logs for Calumbi Fm. (Figure 6-26), together with the results from the 

RFT, showed that the oil shows detected in the cuttings did not correspond to a section of interest 

because the sand prone interval was too thin to be considered for production. 

 

Like Apha Well, Bravo Well was drilled in two phases. It was first drilled to 1042m and logging 

tools were run (including FMI).  However, observations from the wireline logs indicate that zones 

of interest are not identified when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-28). Despite this FMI 

indentified fractures in Oiteirinhos Mb., Ibura Mb. and at the Basement. DST-01 was then 

performed and due to the good results it was decided to drill ahead (to actual TD) and test again 

in DST-02, which had very poor results.  Unfortunately wireline tools were not run again. This way 

we cannot correlate the results of DST-02 with any specific petrophysical property of the rock, or 

to take conclusions on if the Oil Water Contact was reached.

Figure 6-26: Mudlog (A) and composite log (B) showing the Calumbi Fm. section that was sampled. It may 
be observed that despite the good HC shows at 600m-608m the NTG ratio of clay in the interval is around 
50% which reduces its reservoir quality. The wireline also identified these intervals (marked in red) and 
confirmed that they have a lower content of clay (relative to the over and under burden) but are very thin.

Ibura Mb. and around 40m of Basement. It is therefore impossible to derive conclusive evidence about 

either the provenance of the sampled fluids or the pressure characteristics of each individual formation. 

The correct procedure would have been to test each formation independently.

Final Flow Pressure, SP – Static Pressure, FHP – Final Hydrostatic Pressure. It is possible to observe that 
after the FFP the pressure rose steeply and it started to stabilize after 3 hours. It would have been 
necessary to open the valves for a second cycle to take conclusions on the real pressure behaviour of the 
well. 

 

DST Results Analysis: Bravo Well 

The DST procedures for this well were not performed according to the conventional procedures 

(outlined in the Appendix of this thesis), as only one cycle was undertaken (Figures 6-29 and 6-

30). As a result it is difficult to make valid conclusions on the reservoir properties on the interval 

which was tested. The first cycle should have been done as a clean up of the well, so that the 

actual pressure behaviour of the formations being tested could be registered on the second cycle.  

 

The analysis of DST-01 graphic and the reported strong blow lead us to think that this is either an 

interval with a relatively good permeability, or at high pressure, as a rapid increase in pressure 

during the build-up period is observed. Taking into account that the Basement rock that was 

tested was identified in mudlogging as being a micaschist, we consider it to have very low or 

inexistent primary porosity. This lead us to think that it is not likely that the formation is at high 

pressure but that the strong blow is a result of the good permeability given by the open fractures 

registered by the FMI. The final recorded formation pressure remains 290 PSI below the FHP

which most likely indicates that the well was drilled overbalanced. Even tough the well pressure 

did not actually stabilize which contradicts the difference in the formation pressure. The pressure 

plot however does not show a flow period despite the fact that there was blow reported at the 

surface and a gas flow was also registered.  

 

Based on the DST-02 pressure plot, and the weak blow registered at the surface, it may be 

concluded that the lower section of the basement has low permeability.  

 

The DST’s should have been made planned and performed as in the Alpha Well, that is, the Ibura 

Mb. and the Basement should have been tested independently, as this is the only way to 

understand from which specific interval(s) the fluids are flowing from.

• Primary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Ibura Fm.  

Reservoir: fractured carbonates intercalated with evaporites (anhydrite).

 Perflex fluid (9.8-10 lb/gal) – Phase III (Mud weight when drilling through Basement) 

 

Charlie well was a deviated vertical well positioned over a Basement level structural high. It was 

deviated to try to intersect Carmopolis Mb. Figure 6-31 shows the seismic interpretation made for 

the well positioning. Table 6-4 shows the comparison between the predicted and the actual 

drilled formation tops. 

 

 

Table 6-4: Comparison of the predicted versus actual formation tops. Above (+). Below (-). The actual 
formation tops diverge from the predicted in a relatively high range of values, mainly due to interpretation 
errors related to the poor seismic data quality and the velocity model used to create a seismic depth cube.

Mudlog Analysis 

Main observations from the mudlog analysis are (Figure 6-33): 

1. Oil shows were relatively constant from the top of Muribeca Fm. to 700m. 

2. The best oil shows were found in the Ibura Mb. and at the top Basement.  

3. The Ibura Mb. presented a section of around 40m of carbonates below a 10m thick 

section of anhydrite. This section had good oil shows. 

 

Wireline Logging Analysis 

Given that: 

a) good oil shows were present over the Basement and Ibura Mb. intervals, 

 b) the established potential of fractured Basement in the region, and  

c) from our previous experience with Alpha and Bravo Well;  

the decision was taken to perform open hole Drill Stem Testing (test – drill ahead – test 

procedure) and run the wireline logging tools with the FMI.

Apart from the Ibura Mb. where it is possible to identify two intervals of good porosity, the 

analysis of the wireline logs indicate that no zones of interest are identified in either the 

Oiteirinhos Member or Basement when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-34). It may also 

be observed that two different sections can be identified in the Basement on the sonic log (Figure 

6-35): the average transit time in the upper section of the Basement (635m-650m) is higher than 

the lower section. This may indicate that the upper section has lower cohesion – therefore 

potentially more fractured – than the lower Basement. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact 

that the Basement was exposed prior to the sedimentation of Muribeca Fm. and this zone may be 

a weathered/soil profile. This change in the sonic transit time also coincides with a shift in the 

neutron and density logs over the same interval. 

 

For practical purposes, the mudlog and wireline log shown here display only the section from the 

Muribeca Fm. to TD (Figure 6-33).

lower Ibura Mb. and the upper 10m Basement together. It is therefore impossible to derive conclusive 

evidence about either the provenance of the sampled fluids or the pressure characteristics of each 

individual formation. The correct procedure would have been to test each formation independently.

sonic transit time over this interval. There is also a sonic spike at 730m which apparently doesn’t correlate 
to any specific feature in the well, but that can mean a different rheological state of the rock, or represent 
an isolated fracture.

Observations of the DST-01 results and pressure plot: 

- The weak to null blow registered at surface can indicate two possibilities: a low permeability 

interval or wellbore damage. 

- During the two flow periods there is a very small increase in back-pressure, which could mean 

low permeability.  

- The first build-up curve is well developed and seems to begin stabilizing after the five hours of 

build –up. The second curve does not stabilize, but it appears that if it did, it would never be 

as high as the first; this may indicate the presence of a low pressure interval that was 

depleted after the first cycle.

Observations of DST-04 results and pressure plot: 

• Low increase of pressure during the flow periods, maybe due to the fact that this is a gas 

reservoir. 

• The build-up curves show a very slow re-adjustment that tends to stabilize at very low 

pressures. This means that the interval has very low permeability.  

• The second build-up curve tended to stabilize at a lower pressure than the first, which 

indicates depletion of the reservoir.

Comparing this with the previous interval tested, it is fair to conclude that DST-03 tested a much 

better interval in terms of permeability. It may be observed that DST-03 and DST-04 had better 

results when compared to DST-02 which only tested the Ibura Mb. This leads to the conclusion 

that hydrocarbons are flowing from the Basement.

DST Results Analysis: Charlie Well 

As it can be seen from the well log in Figure 6-33, five DST’s were undertaken over the Muribeca 

and Basement formations. Considering the procedures described in the Appendix for DST’s, these 

were performed correctly as two cycles were run. DST-03 tested both the lower Ibura Mb. and the 

top 10m of Basement together. This procedure does not allow valid conclusions on the 

provenance of the sampled fluids and on the pressure characteristics of each particular formation. 

The correct procedure would have been testing each formation independently.

Delta Well  

Well Planning  

• Primary Objective I: testing the presence of HC in the Basement. 

 Reservoir: fractured metamorphic rock. 

• Secondary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Ibura Fm.  

Reservoir: fractured carbonates intercalated with evaporites (anhydrite). 

• Type of Well: Vertical. 

• Mud: Conventional mud (8.7- 9 lb/gal) –Phase I 

 Perflex fluid (9.2-9.8 lb/gal) – Phase II 

 Perflex fluid (9.8-10 lb/gal) – Phase III (Mud weight when drilling through Basement) 

 

Well Results  

Delta well was a vertical well positioned over a structural high, at Basement level. Figure 6-40 

shows the seismic interpretation on which the well positioning was based. The interpretation of 

Carmopolis Mb. is highly questionable. Table 6-5 shows the comparison between the predicted 

and the actual drilled formation tops. For practical purposes the mudlog shown here only displays 

one section of the well, from Muribeca Fm. to TD. The complete log can be found in the last 

chapter of this essay. 

 

Table 6-5: Comparison table of the predicted versus actual formation tops. Above (+). Below (-). The actual 
formation tops diverge from the predicted in a relatively high range of values, mainly due to interpretation 
errors related to the poor seismic quality and the velocity model used to create a seismic depth cube.

Mudlog Analysis 

The following observations from the mudlog may be made (Figure 6-42): 

• Oil shows were found from 800m (Muribeca Fm., Ibura Mb.) almost to TD. 

• The best shows were found in Lower Ibura Mb. and Top Basement. 

• The Lower Ibura Mb. is dominated by carbonates.  

 

Wireline Logging  

Observations from the wireline logs (Figure 6-43) indicate that zones of interest are not identified 

in the Ibura Fm. when utilising conventional attributes. In the Basement no conclusions can be 

made as the logs were not acquired to TD, covering only the top 20m of the formation. Given the 

presence of good oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement 

from other locations in the region, and from our previous experience with Alpha, Bravo and 

Charlie Wells the decision was taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).  

After wireline logging it was considered that what had been interpreted by the mudlogger as the 

Top Basement during drilling, was in fact the Carmopolis Mb. When comparing the logs from the 

Charlie to the logs from the Delta well however, it can be observed that the curves have the same 

shape (Figure 6-44). At the same time no siliciclastics were interpreted by the mudlogger at this 

interval (Figure 6-42). Therefore, this author believes that no Carmopolis Mb. was intersected in 

the Delta well, and what is being interpreted is actually a disaggregated section of basement rock 

caused by exposure to erosion in the past (Figure 6-44).

If we compare the DST-02 pressure plot (Figure 6-45) with typical plots for good and low 

permeability formations displayed in Figure 6-46, we can see that DST-02 plot is similar to A). The 

low increase of back-pressure during the flow-periods might suggest low permeability, but the 

strong blow at surface suggests the opposite. The fact that during build-Up, the formation 

pressure came close to stabilizing at around 285PSI below the FHP (Final Hydrostatic Pressure), 

and knowing that the mud density was 9,8 lb/gal, leads to the conclusion that this well may have 

been drilled highly overbalanced and that the registered blow is caused by the expulsion of the 

mud from the fractures.

radius of the second Build-Up period curve may be observed, indicating average permeability in the tested

Taking into account the data from the flows (weak and null blows) and the pressure behaviour 

observed during the build-up periods, it is fair to conclude that this is a very low permeability 

interval.

DST Results Analysis: Delta Well 

As it can be seen from the well log in Figure 6-42, four DST’s were undertaken over the Basement 

– as stated above this author does not consider that Carmopolis Mb. was intersected by this well. 

Considering the procedures described in the Appendix for DST’s, these were performed correctly 

as two cycles were run. DST-02 tested around 30m of Basement, and presented good results, but 

DST-03 and DST-04 had very poor results. This may be indicative that only the upper section of the 

Basement is permeable. FMI log analysis could help answering this question as it was done over 

the entire Basement interval.

Echo Well 

Well Planning  

• Primary Objective I: testing the presence of HC in the Basement. 

 Reservoir: fractured metamorphic rock 

• Secondary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Ibura Fm.  

Reservoir: fractured carbonates intercalated with evaporites (anhydrite). 

Secondary Objective II: testing the occurrence of HC in the turbiditic sandstones of 

Calumbi Fm.  

• Type of Well: Vertical 

• Mud: Conventional mud (8.7- 9 lb/gal) – Phase I 

 Perflex fluid (9.2-9.8 lb/gal) – Phase II 

 Perflex fluid (9.8-10 lb/gal) – Phase III (Mud weight when drilling through Basement) 

 

Well Results  

Echo well was a vertical well positioned over a Basement level structural high, testing an adjacent 

structure to the one that was tested by Alpha Well. Figure 6-49 shows the interpretation that was 

performed for the well positioning. Table 6-6 shows the comparison between the predicted and 

the actually drilled formation tops. 

 

Table 6-6: Comparison table of the predicted versus actual formation tops. Above (+).Below(-). The actual 
formation tops diverge from the predicted, mainly due to interpretation errors related to the bad seismic 
quality and the velocity model used to create a seismic depth cube. However, relative to the previous wells, 
the predictions are more accurate, indicating that the seismic re-interpretation improved the geological 
model.

Mudlog Analysis 

The main Observations from the mudlog are (Figure 6-51):  

• HC shows are observed from the base of Oiteirinhos Mb. to TD. 

• The basal section of Ibura Mb. contains a 5m thick section of carbonates that has good oil 

shows. 

 

Wireline logging 

Observations from the wireline logs indicate that zones of interest are not identified either in the 

Ibura Fm. or Basement when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-52). Given the presence of 

good oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement from other 

locations in the region, and from our previous experience with Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta 

Wells the decision was taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).  

Two different sections that can be identified in the sonic log within the Basement (Figure 6-53): 

the average transit time in the upper section of the Basement (971m-1030m) is higher than the 

rest, and these two sections are divided by a very visible spike in transit time at around 1030m. 

The spike is also noticeable in the NPorosity and Density logs, and Resistivity also responds 

differently in the upper and lower section of the basement. This may indicate that the upper 

section has a lower cohesion – more fractured – than the lower Basement. This hypothesis is 

consistent with the fact that the Basement was exposed prior to the deposition of the Muribeca 

Fm. It could also mean that two different basement lithologies exist.

FMI was run.  The DST intervals are indicated by numbers            to          notice that DST-3 tested together 

the lower Ibura Mb. and the upper Basement. It is therefore impossible to derive conclusive evidence about 

either the provenance of the sampled fluids or the pressure characteristics of each individual formation. 

The correct procedure would have been to test each formation independently.

was registered in Charlie well. Because Charlie well is relatively distant from Echo well, this spike is more 
likely to represent a transition zone between the altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower 
Basement, than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is not probable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large 
area.

DST’s Results Analysis:  

Considering the results of these DST’s we are lead to conclude that this is an interval of low 

permeability.  

It would have been useful if the DST’s had planned and performed similarly to the Alpha well (test 

Ibura Mb. and Basement independently). This would have allowed a direct comparison between 

both wells and made it possible to observe any trends in the reservoir behaviour.

The Fox well was a vertical well positioned over a Basement level structural high and was 

designed as an appraisal well of the Bravo well discovery. Figure 6-55 shows the pre-drill seismic 

interpretation made for the well positioning; notice the difference to the interpretation for Bravo 

well. Table 6-7 shows the comparison between the predicted and the actually drilled formation 

tops, and Table 6-8 the comparison between the measured formation tops at Fox and Bravo wells. 

 

Table 6-7: Comparison table of the predicted versus actual formation tops. Above (+). Below (-). The actual 
formation tops diverge from the predicted, mainly due to interpretation errors related to the poor seismic 
quality and the velocity model used to create a seismic depth cube even after the seismic had been re-
interpreted, and the velocity model updated.

Mudlog Analysis 

The main Observations from the mudlog are (Figures 6-57 and 6-60):  

• HC shows were found in sandstone levels within the Calumbi Fm.  

• HC shows were found from the top of Muribeca Fm. to TD. 

• The Ibura Mb. is very rich in anhydrite. 

• The basal section of Ibura Mb. contains a 15m thick section of carbonates that has good 

oil shows. 

 

Calumbi Fm Evaluation 

The Calumbi Fm. sandstone section was considered poor in terms of reservoir properties by the 

wireline logging (Figure 6-58).  The sandstone levels with oil shows in the Fox Well at 520m-540m, 

can be correlated with the sandstones with oil shows in the Bravo Well at around 600m (Figure 6-

26). The depth difference between these sandstones can be explained by a 14ºSE dip of the the 

Calumbi Fm. (see calculations below in Figure 6-58), similar to the dips registered at Riachuelo Fm. 

(15ºSE) by the FMI.  At this point in the sedimentary column, the Fox Well is on the hanging wall of 

a fault, and the Bravo on the footwall of that same fault.

Reservoir Geophysics for the Calumbi Fm. 

GALP’s geophysics team has attempted to make a body check the sandstones in the Calumbi Fm. 

using the following procedure (Figure 6-59): 

Data: through velocity analysis it was observed that the sands are acoustically harder than the 

shale. The seismic polarity convention for the SEAL dataset is such that a white loop corresponds 

to a soft kick (negative number). Therefore, a sand-body should be a black loop (positive number).  

Workflow: A quick inversion using Alpha and Bravo wells to derive the low frequency model was 

attempted. Bravo well was also used to derive a wavelet from the PSTM volume, which was 

subsequently inverted. After this, an attempt was made to isolate the P-impedance bodies 

between 1940-2400 g/cm
3
.m/s. 

Results: “A small body was found that could be the sand package that gave the good gas shows.``  

However the overall quality of the seismic is only fair and the seismic inversion result requires 

further analysis and should only be used as a qualitative guide. The extent of the body appears to 

be limited (400 x 450 m) and the thickness of the body needs to be verified. ” 

 

Calumbi Fm. Oil volumes: Two scenarios were run for the volumetrics:  

 High Case Scenario – connected sand body 

 Assuming an average velocity of around 2600 m/s 

 and 1m
3
 ? 6.29 bbl:  

•  thickness: 15 ms TWT corresponds to ~ 

19.5m; 

•  body volume: 2.4 x 106 m3; 

• HIIP: 93850 m3 ~ 590’000 bbl. 

 

 Low Case Scenario – connected sand body 

 Assuming an average velocity of around 2600 m/s 

 and 1m
3
 ? 6.29 bbl:  

•  thickness: 15 ms TWT corresponds to ~ 

19.5m; 

•  body volume: 7.2 x 105 m3; 

•  HIIP: 28225 m3 ~ 178’000 bbl.

 147 

It may be seen from the volumetric scenarios that the oil in place the Calumbi Fm. is limited even 

in the high case (Figure 6-59). A range of recovery factors from 15% to 35% will further reduce this 

volume to a point whereby it may not be a viable exploration target; it may however be a useful 

incremental addition in the event of any futher field development in this area. 

 

Wireline Logging Analysis 

Observations from the wireline logs indicate that zones of interest are not identified either in the 

Ibura Fm. or Basement when utilising conventional attributes (Figure 6-61). Given the presence of 

good oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement from other 

locations in the region, and from experience with the previous wells in the area, the decision was 

taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).

Figure 6-61: Composite well log for the Fox well at the Muribeca Fm. and Basement levels. Two different 
sections divided by a very visible spike in transit time at around 1025m, can be identified in the sonic log 
within the Basement (Figure 6-62) like in Echo well. The spike is also noticeable in the NPorosity and Density 
logs, and Resistivity also responds differently in the upper and lower section of the basement. The 
continuous registration of this spike reinforces the hypothesis of it being a transition zone between the 
altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower Basement, rather than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no 
probable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large area.

Figure 6-63: DST-01 pressure plot. The back-pressure almost did not increase during flow periods, and the 
build-up curves rise sharply but do not stabilize. This indicates very low permeability in the tested interval. 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6-64: DST-02 pressure plot.  This plot shows an interval with a reasonable permeability, as evidenced 
by the increase in back-pressure during the flow periods and by the rapid increase in pressure. The pressure 
was tending to stabilize in the second build-Up period. The very strong blows and the sampled oil cut with 
gas are consistent with this analysis. Also shows the well was highly overbalanced.

Comments on the DST’s procedures and results:  
 

• Only one DST was made at the Top Basement level, despite the fact that oil shows were 

observed in cuttings below that interval. A DST below DST-02 should have been made in 

order to understand if the pattern of results observed in the Bravo well (water production 

below the ?30m interval) were consistent with those seen in here, and to try to define a 

possible OWC. 

•  DST-02 was performed over a 30m of basement section; this does not allow us to 

understand exactly from where in the Basement the oil is being produced.

Golf  Well 

• Primary Objective I: testing the presence of HC in the Basement. 

 Reservoir: fractured metamorphic rock. 

• Secondary Objective: testing the presence of HC in the Ibura Fm.  

Reservoir: fractured carbonates intercalated with evaporites (anhydrite). 

Secondary Objective II: testing the occurrence of HC in the turbiditic sandstones of 

Calumbi Fm.  

• Type of Well: Vertical. 

• Mud: Conventional mud (8.7- 9 lb/gal) – Phase I 

 Perflex fluid (9.2-9.8 lb/gal) – Phase II 

 Perflex fluid (9.8-10 lb/gal) – Phase III (Mud weight when drilling through Basement) 

 

Golf well was a vertical well positioned over a basement level structural high. Figure 6-65 shows 

the interpretation that was performed for the well positioning. This was conditioned by the 

inexistence of seismic in cross-line direction but still the interpretation is quite precise Table 6-9 

shows the comparison between the predicted and the actual drilled formation tops.  

 
Table 6-9: Comparison table of the predicted versus actual formation tops. Above (+). Below (-). The actual 
formation tops diverge from the predicted, mainly due to interpretation errors related to the poor seismic 
data quality and the velocity model used to create a seismic depth cube. The well was positioned only using 
In-lines. The interpretation of Top Basement and Top Ibura Mb. is very precise comparing to the previous 
interpretations (Alpha, Bravo…).

Mudlog  Analysis 
The main Observations from the mudlog are (Figure 6-67 and 6-68): 

• A sand-body that had fair oil shows was intersected in the Calumbi Fm at 580m-600m 

(MD) 

• Oil shows were found from the top of Muribeca Fm. to TD. 

• The Ibura Fm. was poor in anhydrite but rich in carbonates, especially in its lower section 

where very good oil shows were found.

Wireline Logging Analysis 

Observations from the wireline logs (Figure 6-69) indicate that zones of interest are not identified 

in either the Ibura Fm. or the Basement when utilising conventional attributes. Given the 

presence of good oil shows over these intervals, and knowing the potential of fractured Basement 

from other locations in the region, and from previous experience with the wells in the area the 

decision was taken to run an FMI log and perform Drill Stem Testing (open hole).

Figure 6-70: Again in Golf Well, each of the individualized areas (red, and green) have different average 
transit times and corresponding responses of the sonic and density logs. There is also a sonic spike at 
around 1035m (not as clear as in other wells) similar to what was registered in Charlie, Echo and Fox wells. 
The continuous registration of this spike reinforces the hypothesis of it being a transition zone between the 
altered upper Basement and the non-altered lower Basement, rather than an isolated fracture, i.e. it is no 
probable that an isolated fracture extends for such a large area.

Figure 6-71: Golf well DST-01 pressure plot. With only one cycle and a very little volume of oil produced 
(which is not stated in the reports) it is not possible to make any conclusions on the reservoir pressures or 
permeability, even tough the pressure stabilized very quicly. Having tested a very large extension of well, 
including two different formations, with very different lithological properties, did not help to evaluation. 
Only the fact that a very strong gas blow, with a 5m flame, was registered at surface allows the 
interpretation that this is a good reservoir. Nevertheless no conclusions can be taken on the specific interval 
that should be considered for future production.

Considerations on Drilling and Testing Procedures 

To date all the wells have been drilled vertically and in overbalance, with mud weights ranging 

from 8.7 lb/gal to 10 lb/gal. Considering that the main targets are Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, 

this may not be the most efficient approach to drilling and evaluating these fractured reservoirs: 

- Vertical wells are not able to intersect most of the open fractures as these are not 

horizontally distributed.  

- Overbalanced drilling in a fractured reservoir will cause damage to the reservoir due to 

the amount of mud invasion that can occur. This will have an influence on the way the 

reservoir behaves when, for example a DST is operated.  

Well testing procedures were also erroneous, both in terms of the well sections tested and in the 

way the tests themselves were conducted: 

- The same sections should have been tested in different wells and independently; i.e. in 

each well Ibura Mb. and Basement should have been tested independently. 

- Every well should have been tested to TD with short to medium range DST’s. 

- The DST’s should have followed the standard procedure of two Flow-periods and two 

Shut-in periods, so that conclusions on the reservoirs pressure behaviour could have been 

taken. 

 

Due to these procedures, and to the fact that we do not have reliable pressure values for the 

tested intervals, it was not possible to take conclusions on the permeability of the Fractured 

Basement.

6.1.4.2 Image Logs Analysis 

To make the visualization easier and because this is one of the most important sections of the 

well analysis, the FMI logs that were run, will be analysed together for all wells. As all the wells 

were made in the same geographic area it’s not surprising that the features that were found are 

similar for all of them. These are: 

• Bed Boundary - these events are very common along the wells. They mark lithological 

changes in the sedimentary record.  

• Foliations: the events that were interpreted as foliations are very common particularly in 

the Basement. Figure 6-72 and 6-73 show them in detail for Alpha Well, but they appear 

in all of the drilled wells. These can be misinterpreted as natural open fractures, which 

very often occur parallel to the foliation due to decompression effect while drilling.  

 
Figure 6-72: dynamic and static images from the Basement, showing foliation – purple tadpoles – dipping 
around 50º towards NE. Vertical scale 1/20. The rock shows high resistivity.   
  

Natural Fractures: natural fractures, conductive (dark colour) or resistive (light colour) 

appearance (Figure 6-74) were observed along the several logged intervals, being more common 

than the induced. As these are the object of the present study, they will be given more 

importance than the other features observed and previously described. Fracture aperture and 

porosity can be calculated using the FMI data. The values presented below correspond to the 

calculations done using the interpretation software from Schlumberger.

Fracture Aperture (fracture width): fracture aperture is calculated taking into account the 

mud resistivity, the rock resistivity and specific tool parameters. Fracture dip angle and 

extension are also an input, as well as the degree of aperture (partially or totally open). Luthi 

and Souhaité (1990) describe the calculation algorithm:  

 

 

 

 W: fracture aperture 
 b and c: specific tool parameters 
 A: excess of current divided by the voltage integrated along a line perpendicular  
 to the fracture strike. 
 Rm: mud resistivity 
 Rxo: rock resistivity 
 

Considering that Rm and Rxo have influence on the calculation of the aperture, they should 

be as precise as possible. In general, if Rm is too high, it tends to increase the calculated 

aperture, and vice-versa. An high Rxo will diminish the aperture and vice-versa. Two types of 

fractures can be calculated: mean aperture and hydraulic. For porosity calculation it is the 

hydraulic aperture that is used. 

 

Fracture porosity: fracture porosity for this purpose is defined by the percentage of wellbore 

wall that is covered by the fracture. The calculation of this property uses the parameters 

fracture density and the area of wellbore that is covered by the image log. It is important to 

highlight that only the fracture porosity is being calculated here as there is no contribution of 

primary porosity. Literature shows that fracture porosity doesn’t normally go beyond 1.5% - 

2% (Nelson, 1985). 

 

Fracture aperture and fracture porosity values are presented in Table 6-10 

 

Induced Fractures: these are generated during drilling operations, and are related to the 

subsurface stresses. Their strike is in general parallel to the largest stress, and when associated 

with breakouts (well deformation in a preferential direction) they help characterizing the principal 

tensors in the region (Figure 6-75).

FMI Results 

The next pages will be dedicated to the analysis of the FMI data over the Basement with the 

objective of understanding the characteristics of the fractures that cut through it. Below, Table 6-

10 summarises some important qualitative results after the FMI analysis for the different wells, as 

previously described: 

 

Table 6-10: results from the FMI analysis for the different wells. Values of aperture corresponding to 
porosities below 0.01% were not considered. Notice that the porosities and apertures here presented are 
indirectly measured by the FMI tool, i.e. the values are extrapolated using the calculations presented above. 
As porosity is determined by the percentage of wellbore wall that is covered by the fracture, and the well is 
vertical, it is likely that porosity is highly underestimated.

In order to evaluate what were the main fracture trends in the wells, and consequently in the 

study area (Distribution of Fracture Patterns in the NFR Worlflow – Figure 6-1) Universidade Nova 

de Lisboa (UNL) team (part of the Fractured Basement Project) made an analysis of the dip and 

strike measurements taken from the FMI. These measurements were plotted in a Schmidt Equal 

Area Projection - southern hemisphere - grid and statistically analysed. The conclusions are 

presented below in the form of pictures (Figure 6-76 to 6-80). Notice that measurements for 

Charlie and Echo well were not available. This caused that for Block-B, models and predictions 

were based only in one well, causing them to be less accurate.

From the analysis of Figure 6-81, it is possible to take the following conclusions: 
 
Alpha: family Alpha-2 is located only in the Basement. 

Beta: family Beta-1 is the most expressive in the Basement, but Beta-2B has some measurements 

in the Basement. 

Delta: all measurements were made inside the Basement, but families Delta-1 and Delta-2B are 

more expressive. 

Fox: most measurements were made inside the Basement, but the most expressive family is Fox-

1A. 

Golf: Golf-1A is the most expressive, being the other two insignificant at Basement depths.

The next step was to harmonise all the measurements so that a general set of fracture families 

could be considered for the area. This can be done based on the assumption that deformation 

occurred over the entire area and thus fractures should be present in both blocks even if they are 

not identified in wells. Table 6-11 shows the final families after the comparison. Figure 6-82 helps 

comparing the families present in each well. 

 

Table 6-11: Correspondence of fracture families per well. Notice that the final family A is the most 
predominant fracture family with 104 measurements inside the Basement and present in every well. The 
general trends were obtained by averaging the strike and dip of the correspondent fracture families. It 
differs from the general trend calculated by UNL team because this team only used  measurements from 
Alpha, Beta and Delta wells. (Adapted from UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of 
Fractured Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011).

Final Considerations for FMI analysis 

From the analysis of Table 5-11 it is obvious that Family A, which strikes at N22ºW and dips 60º 

towards NE (GALP general trends differ from UNL trends because more wells were used for the 

calculation as Fox and Golf wells haven’t been drilled by the Fractured Basement Project was 

developed), is the most common, being present in every well (see Figure 6-82), with a total of 104 

measurements inside the Basement.  

Because all the wells were drilled vertically and the fracture planes are not horizontal, all 

measurements are underestimated. This means that the most accurate measurements are those 

of fractures which inclination is closer to horizontal (See Section 4), case of family B1 and E. From 

this comes that, if family A is dipping at 60º and still is the most common, it is probably the 

predominant fracture direction in the area, and the one that future drilling campaigns should be 

aiming to intersect.

6.2 FRACTURE SYSTEM ORIGIN 

The literature for SEAL Basin structural evolution describes the Basement as part of a complex 

fold belt, created by the collision of two cratonic masses – Section 1. For this reason, and because 

there was no data suggesting another origin, this was the premise used for the fracture system 

origin of the Basement.  

In tectonic related systems, fractures are formed by the application of surface forces and form in 

networks with specific spatial relationships to folds and faults, and generally are widespread 

across the Basin. In this case, and due to the mapped structures it was decided to study the SEAL 

Basement fracture system in light of these principles. This means that the location of the study 

area is not important as wherever it is, the fracture system will be generically be equal. By making 

this assumption it was possible to use geomechanical modelling to derive fracture density and 

orientation, as it will be demonstrated in the following section (Universidade do Algarve – UALG 

work). 

 

 

 

6.3 FRACTURE PROPERTIES AFFECTING RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE 

The four petrophysical determinations most useful in this evaluation are: fracture permeability; 

fracture porosity; fluid saturations within the fractures and the recovery factor expected from the 

fracture system. These properties are directly dependant on three fracture properties:  

• fracture morphology,  

• fracture spacing, 

• fracture width and permeability. 

For determining these, core analysis, well tests and image logs are the best methods. As 

previously stated, cores were not available at the time this study was carried, leaving us with well 

tests and image logs to try to obtain the properties that affect reservoir performance.

 175 

6.3.1 Fracture Morphology 

Defining the fracture morphology only from FMI data is a very imprecise task. It is only possible to 

detect if fractures are open, partially open or healed (amongst other physical characteristics), but 

not their physical shape. In order learn on the fractures morphology (which can influence the 

permeability of the reservoir – See Section 4.2.3.1), extracting full diameter cores would have 

been essential. 

 

 

6.3.2 Fracture Spacing and Permeability 

As evaluation of outcrops and cores (the most reliable source to determine fracture density) was 

not available, FMI data and faults mapped by seismic interpretation was used in the context of 

the Fractured Basement Project, (for further reading please refer to: Modelling and 

characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and SEAL-T-B Project Report – May 

2011).   

 

6.3.2.1 Geomechanical Modelling  

Despite being observed in borehole data (FMI Logs), fractures could not be detected in seismic – 

due to small their small size (which causes them to be sub-seismic), and to the poor seismic 

quality. For this reason these discontinuities could not be detected in the rock volume between 

the wells. The aim of the geomechanical modelling was to simulate the density and orientation of 

the fractures on that space. The following description is based on the final report of the Fractured 

Basement Project (Modelling and characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and 

SEAL-T-B Project Report – May 2011), more specifically on the UALG’s team work. Describing and 

explaining in detail the geomechanical modelling done for the SEAL area is outside the scope of 

this thesis, for that reason, only the input data and the results will be presented. For more detail 

please refer to the mentioned work.  

Initial Assumptions 

In any tectonic setting, the regional stress field is perturbed by local factors, of which mechanical 

discontinuities such as faults are the most important. The modelling used on this project assumed 

that the distribution of the small-scale discontinuities (the fractures) was determined by: 

a) the superposition the regional tectonic stress  

(b) the local perturbation of that stress state resulting from the nearby larger faults 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 176 

 

The larger mapped faults (faults interpreted by the U.Aveiro Ant-Tracking Workflow presented in 

section 6.1.3) were considered pre-existing structures and input for the model, and the predicted 

fractures were assumed to form later as the result of the interaction between those faults and the 

regional tectonic field.  Coulomb failure criterion (Jaeger and Cook, 1979) was used to estimate 

the fault strike: 

 

Where is the angle of the failure planes to the maximum principal compressive stress (  ), and 

is the coefficient of internal friction. The theory predicts that two conjugate failure planes 

intersect along the principal intermediate stress  (Figure 6-83), and the fault orientation is 

influenced only by and the orientation of the principal stresses. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Figure 6-83: According to Anderson’s theory of faulting, the 
principal stresses are vertical and horizontal. The most 
favourable fault planes intersect along the intermediate 
principal direction and make an angle with the maximum 
principal compressive stress and are equally probable (UNL, 
UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured 
Reservoirs -GALP E&amp;amp;P Internal Report; Lisbon; 2011). 

 

 

Assuming that the faulting regime is determined by Anderson’s theory of faulting, the optimally 

oriented conjugate shear fractures are the most likely planes to be formed on the vicinity of 

faults, and maximum Coulomb shear stress (MCSS) can be used to infer their densit (UALG, 2011): 

 

Where,?1&gt;?2&gt;?3. 
 

The development of the modelling carried out by UALG involved the following steps: 

•  Build the 3D model geometry after recognition of the basic structural scenario; 

•  Specify material properties; 

• Impose remote loading and local boundary conditions;

 177 

• Run the models to compute the stress and strain fields; 

• Apply a failure criteria to compute small-scale fracture density and orientation; 

• Perform sensitivity tests to boundary conditions and material parameters. 

 

The grid for the model was formed by quadrilateral elements in the horizontal and 30 elements in 

vertical direction, 5m thick. Faults interpreted previously (See Section 5.3) were embedded in this 

grid (Figure 6-84).

The linear-elastic behaviour that simulates the reservoir rock is characterized by two constants, 

the Poisson’s ratio,?, and the Young’s modulus, E. The values of these constants are essentially 

determined by the reservoir lithology at the time of deformation. For the present study it was 

decided to use E= 28 Gpa and ? = 0.14, values for shale (UALG, 2011)  

 

Because the pore pressure influences the normal components of the stress tensor, the value of 

the pore pressure (Pp) in the reservoir must also be given.  

• Beta Well: 98.85 kgf/cm2 at 1000-1052 m depth and 104.0 kgf/cm2 at 1043-1072 m depth.

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 178 

• Alpha Well: 49.66 kgf/cm2 at 969-1000 m depth and 96.48 kgf/cm2 at 1000-1030 m depth.  

 

It was decided to use a pore pressure value at 1000 m depth, corresponding approximately to the 

top of the basement in the SEAL-T-A Block, equal to 100 kgf/cm
2
. Hence, Pp for the Basement =10 

MPa, which is equivalent to consider hydrostatic pore pressure conditions; that is, a pore pressure 

gradient of 10 MPa/km. 

As the remote loading (the regional stress regimes) responsible for some large-scale faults seen in 

the seismic, was not enough to predict the small-scale discontinuities that were registered by the 

FMI logs, it was decided to adapt it. The result is listed in Table 6-12. 

 

Table 6-12: Remote stress loading in the final set of models. (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and

The effect of modelling two cycles of extension (1) E-W with N-S faults active; 2) NW-SE with N-S 

faults locked and remaining active) was tested, and it was concluded that modelling the second 

stage only with all faults simultaneously active would essentially produce the superposition of the 

predicted fault planes in the two stages. For this reason this last option was used.

Results: 

As the Mohr-Coulomb criterion predicts that the two conjugate shear discontinuities are in theory 

equally probable (Figure 6-83), for each tectonic scenario and at each grid observation point two 

conjugate predicted fractures were outputted. Hence, the outputs were the MCSS (Mohr-

Coulomb Shear Stress) values and the predicted conjugated fractures shear strikes and dips at 

each point of the reservoir grid, for each tectonic loading listed in Table 6-13. This information 

was used in the UNL Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. Table 6-14 shows the composite 

geomechanical scenarios (GMS1 and GMS2) from the combination of the three geomechanical 

models / stress regimes (I, II and III see table 6-13).

The analysis of the MCSS distribution in Figures 6-85 and 6-86 shows that the largest predicted 

fracture densities occur near the faults. The UALG team explains this by theoretical models of 

faulting but these theoretical predictions can also be proven by real examples. One example is the 

Natih Field, Oman where the chalky limestones are heavily fractured. The use of high-quality 3D 

data sets, allowed the detection of flexures and faults with throws as small as 3m. Overlaying the 

fracture orientation data from core and FMI on a seismic dip map (Figure 6-87a) allowed 

establishing a relation between fractures and faults. By doing this the operator was able to revise 

the well-targeting strategy and placed wells near small faults and flexures. These wells had an 

average improvement of 30% in gross productivity, indicating that these wells are intersecting 

more open fractures than before (Figure 6-87 b) (Whyte, S.; unknown date).   

The same association between fracturing and faulting was observed in FMI images from 

horizontal wells in Idd El Shargi Field, offshore Qatar. Here, combining borehole images with the 

relatively poor 3D seismic allowed to plan horizontal wells, resulting in immediate results with the

first and second horizontal wells producing ten times more than the earlier vertical wells (Figure 

6-88)  (Cosgrove, P and Jubralla, A.F.; unknown date). 

 

The geomechanical models together with the proven field situations where higher open fracture 

densities occur near the fault, is a very strong argument that should be taken into account when 

planning a well in SEAL, i.e. a future well should be planned so that it is drilled near a fault rather 

than between two faults, for example.

these regimes. The dominant trends of the most intense fault clustering (red regions) follow approximately 
the N10° and N120° azimuths. (UNL, UALG, UA, &amp;amp; IST; Modelling and Characterization of Fractured

6.6.2.2 Discrete Fracture Network Modelling (DFN) and Permeability Simulation 

Fracture width or aperture measurements can be taken from the FMI logs in the absence of cores. 

In Table 6-10 values for fracture aperture were presented, which are relative to the aperture 

interval found in each well. As already stated, the objective of this thesis is to provide a future 

drilling location (positioning and orientation), which depends on the evaluation of the properties 

of each of the fracture families found. Hence, values of Table 6-10 are not useful because with 

them it is not possible to accurately determine the aperture of Family A, for example.  

To try to solve this problem DFN models and Permeability Simulation (PS) based on them can be 

used. Again, the Fracture Basement Project was crucial. Below this methodology – developed by 

Universidade Nova de Lisboa (UNL) - and results are presented. For further reading please refer

to: Modelling and characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and SEAL-T-B Project 

Report – May 2011. 

 

In this phase of the project, equivalent permeability histograms of each FMI fracture family were 

generated by UNL, using both data from the FMI statistical analysis and from the geomechanical 

modelling. This was done in two steps: 

I) Characterize the relationship between fracture number (N), fracture area (P32) and linear 

fracture density (LFD index) per fracture family.  

 

II) Generation of histograms of equivalent permeability using the Oda method, conditioned 

to the LFD index, fracture family and reservoir block. 

 

“To simulate 3D fracture networks that allow the calculation of histograms of permeability it is 

necessary to characterize the relationship between the LFD (measured at wells with FMI data, 

Section 6.4.2), number of fractures (N) and fracture areas (P32) per fracture family. This means, 

for a specific 3D reservoir block, estimate the number of fractures by family and correspondent 

distribution of areas (P32) that match a specific LFD at vertical direction, the same direction 

evaluated by FMI.” - Modelling and characterization of fractured reservoirs, blocks SEAL-T-A and 

SEAL-T-B Project Report – May 2011. 

The problem that the UNL team faced to achieve this was that fracture orientation is not 

constant, which mean s that the relationship between LFD, fracture number (N) and area (P32) is 

unknown. To solve this problem, an inverse approach was used through the application of the 

FTRIAN software created by UNL, an algorithm of fracture simulation that allows the generation 

of equally probable fracture network scenarios within a volume constraint by a LFD index 

(Almeida, Barbosa, 2008) (Figure 6-89). Fracture networks are simulated using a polygonal 

approximation. In the present case squares were used, but triangles can also be used (Figure 6-

90): the software first generates random locations with Monte Carlo (each random location is the 

geometric centre of a fracture), and then for each creates a vector allowing the positioning of the 

first square vertex; successive rotations of the vector (four rotations of 90º) generates a square. 

After each cycle, the model is then sampled with scan-lines (simulating a well).  In the present 

study, it was considered enough generating three realizations for each evaluation and sampling 

the model with 1000 vertical scan-lines. After several iterations, look up tables relating N, P32 and 

LFD can be built.

For the present case, it was considered that simulating fractures as squares whose areas follow a 

power model distribution function of lateral sizes was the most adequate methodology, as it is 

geologically more realistic and at the same time runs efficiently allowing equivalent permeability 

calculation using expedite methods, such as the proposed by Oda, 1985

small-scale fractures). As the fracture areas follow a predefined distribution law, lookup tables will 

show LFD values conditioned only to the number of fractures (N). 

 

 

Results 

As it was referred above, the simulation is constrained by the Linear Fracture Density observed in 

the wells, using the FMI data. At the same time, and because the final objective is to provide a 

well orientation, it only makes sense to generate permeability histograms of fractures that are 

found in the wells even when in geomechanical modelling, other families are predicted. Hence, 

three permeability curves were generated for FMI fracture families A, B1 and B2 conditioned to

The permeability tensor derives from the fracture tensor Fij with the assumption that   Fij represents 
the flow along the fracture. In addition, fractures are impermeable at the perpendicular, thus Fij must 
be rotated to the fracture planes:

the LFD calculated from FMI data and to orientation statistics from correspondent geomechanical 

grid models (Table 6-15).  

It is important to note that in the geomechanical modelling two grids (one for Block A and other 

for Block B) were used to simulate fracture density but the applied stress regimes were the same 

(GMS1 and GMS2). This way, it is possible to use the same LFD index for both blocks and generate 

orientation classes (strike and dip) for each family according to the geomechanical scenarios 

(Tables 6-16 and 6-17). From the geomechanical modelling, it can be observed that families GB1 

and GB2, are generated only through one stress regime (normal). For that reason, histograms can 

be generated for GMS1 and GMS2 together.  

Table 6-15 lists the families of fractures from both the geomechanical modelling and FMI data 

with minimum and maximum observed LFD.  Tables 6-16 and 6-17 present two examples of 

frequency of azimuth and dip angle histograms for family A (A2 in GMS1) for Block-A and Block-B 

calculated from the geomechanical grid values.

Notice that the frequency of strike and dip values is different between the two blocks, meaning 

that when using the same stress regimes, the biggest influence on the way fractures are 

distributed is the grid over which the simulation is made. This is the same as saying that over the 

same stress regime, fracture orientation is conditioned by the shape of the rock volume and the 

faults embedded in it - in each Block the interpreted basement horizon and faults, that were used 

to generate the grids is different which means that when applying the same MCSS to both grids  

(which are geometrically different) the final result will be different.  

 

Tablesx 6-18 and 6-19, show the LFD results of three realisations and the resultant average value, 

for the model using the FTRIAN algorithm described before (fractures are approximated by 

squares and areas follow a power model distribution function of lateral sizes), within a 100 x 100 x 

5m reference grid, for the three fracture families and for both blocks. As an example, Table 6-18 

can be read in the following way:  

• It is necessary to generate approximately 175000 fractures of family A (A2 in GMS1) to 

reach a LFD index of 2.6 (maximum observed). 

• It is necessary to generate approximately  97500 fractures of family B1 to reach a LFD 

index of 1.6 (maximum observed) 

• It is necessary to generate approximately  62500 fractures of family B2 to reach a LFD 

index of 1.0 (maximum observed)

From here the relationship between LFD index and number of fractures by reference block of 

100m x 100m x 5m and by cubic meter could be found. Table 6-20 presents the results. Notice 

that A, is the fracture family which presents a higher density value, which had already been 

observed when using the FMI counting only (Table 6-11). 

The similarity in density values for both Blocks is due to the fact that LFD max used is the same. 

Again the small difference in the values is due to the differences in the grid shape and consequent 

simulated fractures strike and dip.

Using the values from Table 6-20 it was possible to estimate permeability for each of the fracture 

families using the Oda method (see page 194). Here, fractures are simulated considering the  

average strike azimuth at 0º and average dip at 90º, which causes the calculated permeability 

tensor to have two major components of permeability which are close to equality (Kx and Kz), and 

a component close to zero (Ky) – See Section 4.2.3.1. At the same, time fracture aperture, which 

largely influences fracture permeability, was set to 1mm. This way, it was possible to compare all 

the fracture families, which would not be possible if the orientation and aperture effects were 

taken into account.  Figure 6-91 shows the Maximum equivalent permeability graphics for each of 

the fracture families for Block-A and Block-B. The graphics were obtained by plotting the values of 

permeability obtained for a 5x5x5m dimension cell.

 Porosity is calculated by the ratio between the volume of fractures and the volume of each cell 

(which is 5x5x5m). The volume of fractures is calculated through fracture area x aperture.

Table 6-21 sums the results of the modelling by showing the maximum and minimum 

permeability and porosity values, as well as the average for each fracture family and exploration 

block. Again it is easy to conclude that Family A is the one which presents the highest values of 

both permeability and porosity. This result is not surprising as this family is the most expressive in 

terms of density. As the models assumed aperture values of 1mm for every family, then it is 

mainly density which is conditioning the final results.

Final Considerations on DFN Model 

Not having core or outcrop data and relying exclusively on seismic and FMI data to constrain the 

reservoir model creates a certain degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the same methodology was 

used for treating the data from the five wells, meaning that any possible error will affect that data 

the same way, hence allowing for a fair comparison between them.  

In terms of the presented results it can be seen that the permeability values are very high (they 

are actually overestimated as Wf used equals 1mm, when it is usually around 0.1-0.01mm) and 

porosity is very low, which is a typical characteristic of a fractured reservoir. At the same time, 

when testing the validity of these results by using the following empirical formula, 

 

Kfrac=83300 x Wf
3
x LFD x KF 

Where: Kfrac= fracture permeability; Wf= fracture aperture (millimetres); LFD= fracture 
frequency (fractures/meter), given by the Linear Fracture Density; KF= number of main fracture 
directions. 
 
, it can be seen that Kfrac = 83300 x 1

3
 x 2.6 x 1 = 216 darcys; which is a value with approximately 

the same magnitude of the presented maximum permeability value for family A.

Finally it is important to mention that unless long term well tests or laboratory core tests had 

been done to properly estimate permeability, this approach is probably the most complete and 

accurate that can be done by using only FMI data. 

 

 

Considerations on the Fracture System 

As it was already mentioned, the absence of core or outcrop data makes that any consideration 

about the fracture system will have the same level of uncertainty. At the same time the fact that 

the wells have been drilled vertically leads to an underestimation of the fracture families’ density. 

Even though, and considering what was observed in the previous section, from the 3 fracture 

families present, Family A is the best candidate to be intersected with a well, as it is the family 

that presents the best density, permeability and porosity indexes (Figures 2 and 3; Table 7). 

Relative to the fracture-matrix interaction, it was also already stated that this is a Type 1 reservoir 

(p. 76), which means that only fractures provide the essential permeability, and the rock matrix 

should not be considered in the models.  

 

The next section is dedicated to the Technical Recommendations for future work on Block-A and 

Block –B area, which should be seen as the main a conclusion of the present thesis.

7. TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS  

The final objective of this exercise is to provide GALP a well location which, relative to the seven 

wells drilled previously, assures better production rates. In order to establish a successful well 

location, i.e. a location which has higher chances of becoming a discovery well, the geologist must 

collect the most information he can on the area where he is placing that well location. This 

chapter is dedicated to provide a series of technical recommendations, based on what was 

presented in the previous sections, and that in the author’s opinion will lead to an improvement 

of the exploration and production results in the Basement of the SEAL Basin.  

 

This section is divided into two parts: the first will be dedicated to the data that should be 

acquired for better understanding of the fracture system; and the second to the actual definition 

of a well location and the associated volumes – which have not been previously calculated for this 

area. Figure 7-1 shows the new proposed exploration workflow for the part which is dedicated to 

volume calculations and drilling a well.

7.1 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING AND 

ACQUISITION 
 

7.1.2 Seismic Processing of the existing data  

Even though post-stack migration is much faster than pre-stack migration (because stacking 

reduces the number of traces that must be processed) and it is cheaper, pre-stack migration gives 

a better imaging quality and is the most efficient type of migration when geological structures are 

complex (Section 4.2.7). This is the case of SEAL, where the Basement rocks have undergone high 

deformation presenting complex structures and, most importantly for HC production, fractures. 

Re-processing the already available seismic with pre-stack techniques, giving more attention to 

the picking of the initial stacking velocities particularly at Basement depth, would probably 

produce better imaging, hence allowing for better definition of the fracture patterns, which in its 

turn allow for better planning of drilling campaigns.  

It is strongly recommended that this technique is applied before a new seismic acquisition 

campaign is considered as it represents a relatively low cost and it can largely improve the way 

the Basement is evaluated.  

 

 

7.1.1 Seismic Acquisition of new data – Narrow VS Wide Azimuth  

In the SEAL Basin, the use of Wide-Azimuth seismic, despite the fact that it would definitely 

improve seismic imaging and hence the way that the fracture system is understood, is determined 

by the volume of HC that can be proven to exist in the Basement reservoir. Calculating volumes 

for this reservoir is a very difficult task and has a high degree of uncertainty. As a result of this 

Wide-Azimuth seismic acquisition may be an operation harder to justify to the management, 

given its extra acquisition expense. Even though, the small area to be covered by the acquisition 

(Block-A and Block-B totalize an area of around 60 Km
2
) may represent a small cost increase 

relative to the gain in seismic quality and hence in the understanding of the fractures system. As 

such, acquiring Wide-Azimuth seismic should be an option to consider.  

If the option of Wide-Azimuth seismic acquisition is not taken, is still possible to improve the 

seismic image quality by applying different methods of processing than those that have been used 

to process the 3D seismic that was used for this work.

 198 

7.2 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DRILLING CAMPAIGNS 

 

The well location is supported by the following: 

 

• Results of the seven wells drilled previously. The current wells did not produce well during 

testing. All seven found HC, demonstrating that the area has good potential, and that 

these poor results in testing might be due to erroneous drilling procedures (vertical wells, 

overbalance, improperly executed DST’s). At the same time, it is not expected that 

maintaining these procedures will lead to different results. The proposed well will use 

different methodologies to try to overcome these problems. 

 

• Data Acquired in the wells. The FMI data acquired, shows that there are several fracture 

families present in the Basement. From these, Family A (Section 6, Table 6-11) is  the most 

promising due to its predominance. The proposed well will be projected in a way so that 

the contact of the well with the fractures is maximized – a directional well, intersecting 

fracture planes perpendicularly. 

 

• Geomechanical + DFN Modelling: predicted the fracture density, permeability and 

porosity of the several fracture families, data that will be used ahead for volumetric 

calculations. It also helps supporting the idea that in every Basement high, HC will be 

found because these fractures are distributed throughout the entire Basement.  

 

•  Worldwide Analogues. Similar situations for fractured basement are found everywhere 

around the globe. In these analogues the exploration techniques used are substantially 

different from the ones used in SEAL by GALP (Section 5), namely directional and 

underbalanced drilling.  

 

• Volume Calculations: In order to justify any well location, the calculation of the Oil-in-

Place is essential. Without a proper and reliable assessment it is not possible to evaluate 

which techniques are economically sustainable or even if drilling a well is justifiable.

7.2.1 Volumes Calculations for SEAL Fractured Basement Reservoir 

In order to justify any well location, the calculation of the Hydrocarbons Initially In Place is 

essential. Without a proper and reliable assessment it is not possible to evaluate which 

techniques are economically sustainable or even if drilling a well is justifiable. The following 

calculations are based on Figure 7-2 map. Notice that the Hydrocarbons Initially In Place are going 

to be assessed for the sum of the three fracture families defined previously.

locations. Not all interpreted faults are displayed, as they would overload the map precluding a good 
understanding. The wells displayed were not defined in this map as they were drilled prior to its 

construction. Map created using Petrosys
?

. 

 

 

Volumetrics can be assessed by using the Oil in Place formula, HIIP (Hydrocarbons Initially In 

Place):  

 

HIIP = GRV x NTG x Phi (?) x Shc x FVF 

 

Where: 

GRV: gross rock volume.  

NTG: Net-to-gross 

Phi (?): porosity 

Shc: Hydrocarbon saturation 

FVF: formation volume factor. 

 

For the present case study, it was decided to use this formula by changing the way each of the 

variables is calculated. Below is a description of the workflow used to calculate the HIIP for the 

SEAL Basement. Notice that for the reservoir characteristics that Naturally Fractured Reservoirs 

present, it is difficult to place a reasonable certainty on volumetric estimates of original HIIP, 

recoveries and hence reserves. As a consequence, the following volumetric calculations should be 

placed in the possible category.

GRV: Is the total rock volume of a potential hydrocarbon bearing trap. This can be assessed in two 

different ways:  

 

1.  Area/Depth graphs confined by the spill point* (which may or may not be deeper than the 

OWC contact). 

2. Geostatistical simulation. 

 

Both methods require the mapping of the prospect and the identification of the uncertainties 

which are usually large, depending on the type of opportunity under evaluation (structure, OWC 

type).  Commonly, the GRV is assessed by the first method in the following logic: 

 

GRV = Area of closure x Thickness 

 

The Area of Closure is assessed by measuring the areas enclosed by successive contours until the 

deepest closing contour of the structure. These areas are then plotted against the thickness 

(depth) of the reservoir, which is confined by the spill point (Figure 7-3).  Two options have been 

tested:

*Spill Point: the structurally lowest point in a hydrocarbon trap that can retain hydrocarbons. Once a 
trap has been filled to its spill point, further storage or retention of hydrocarbons will not occur for lack 
of reservoir space within that trap. The hydrocarbons spill or leak out and they continue to migrate until 
they are trapped in another structure.

1. Assessing GRV per Basement High: To quickly evaluate the validity of calculating the GRV – and 

consequently the volumes – for each single Basement structure, it was decided to make the 

calculation for the Basement high where the well with best results was located.  That was the 

Bravo and Fox structure (Section 6). For this, the 1060m contour (depth to which HC were found)  

was used. The map can be seen in Figure 7-4 and the GRV calculations for this structure can be 

found in Table 7-1. It can be seen that structure and consequently the HIIP that would have been 

calculated using this method would have been very small and economically not sustainable as the 

total area of the structure is less then 1km
2
. 

 

2. Assessing the GRV for the total Area of Basement above a certain depth: In Figure 7-2 it is 

possible to observe that Basement highs are structurally narrow which causes them to have small 

areas. It is possible that, as they are very close to each other they could be interconnected 

structures. In Figure 7-5 and 7-6 the red contour shows the maximum depth to which HC was 

found in GALP wells (1060m). It was considered to use it for GRV calculations, but the fact that in 

well BR-01 (a well from the database drilled in 1981), oil shows below 1200m depth, within the 

Basement, were found suggests that open fractures can be found at this depth.  At the same time 

the fact that HC were found in all the wells, makes reasonable to assume that every basement 

high was charged and consequently there are HC stored in the open fractures of those basement 

highs. These observations lead this author to consider that a common lowest closing contour can 

be chosen for calculation purposes, making the final GRV much higher. Table 7-2 shows the GRV 

values when the 1200m base contour is chosen for Block-A, and Table 7-3 for Block-B. 

 

After identifying the structure and calculating the GRV, it is necessary to identify the reservoir 

rocks by log analysis, calculate porosities on those intervals and to calculate the hydrocarbon 

saturation of those same intervals. It is necessary to calculate the Net-To-Gross (NTG), Porosity 

(?) and Saturation (Sh).

NTG and Phi (????) 

NTG or Net-to-Gross, is the average ratio of the net-reservoir-rock volume to the gross volume. 

Calculating NTG corresponds to identifying the percentage of rock that is reservoir. It is derived 

from petrophysical evaluation of well data allied with play analysis for lithological variation that 

can modify the NTG (Figure 7-7). 

 

 
Figure 7-7: example of table generated by Schlumberger IP software that shows the results of the 
petrophysicist interpretation. Of the B interval, 89.7% is considered to be reservoir – which means that NTG 
is 0.897 - while C is 100% reservoir. 

 

In a Basement Naturally Fractured Reservoir, where matrix porosity is close to zero, or non-

existent, all the storage space is in the fractures. Consequently, the net-to-gross calculation 

corresponds to an assessment of the percentage of rock volume that is occupied by fractures, 

which is the same as calculating the fracture density.  

In the case of SEAL Fractured Basement, fracture density was assessed using data from the FMI 

and data from the DFN modelling (Table 6-20 reproduced below). This way it is possible to obtain 

the theoretical fracture density per family. Here we can read the number of fractures that need to 

be simulated to reach the linear density found in the wells. Notice that these values have been 

calculated using FMI density data, which is underestimated as the wells have been drilled vertical 

and fractures are sub-vertical.  

In order to obtain the percentage of rock volume that corresponds to fractures, these were 

simulated by UNL team (in squares or triangles) using FTRIAN software in a 100 x 100 x 5 

reference block, until the density that was observed in the wells per family was reached (Section 

6.6.2.2) As the fractures are simple polygons, the area was calculated by FTRIAN software for each 

polygon using a polynomial law.

Example for Family A:  

In a reference block of 100m x 100m x 5m= 50000 m
3
 , 176685 fractures were simulated with an 

average area of 1.75 m
2 

so that the linear density value of 2.6 could be reached.  

For an apperture of 1mm comes: 176685*1.75*0.001= 309.19 m
3
. Which means that there is 

309.19m

 of fractures in a 50000m

volume. This is the same as having 0.00618 m

of fracture per 

cubic meter of rock volume. For obtaining net to gross: 0.00618 x 100% ?0.618 %. 

 

As apertures from the FMI vary within 0.01mm and 0.6mm, NTG will be calculated for these two 

extremes.  Table 7-4 shows the range of NTG values for Block A and Block B.

Now that NTG has been assessed, how is porosity calculated? 

Phi (?) or Porosity is a measure of the void spaces in a rock, and is a fraction of the volume of 

voids over the total volume of rock. In a regular clastic or carbonate rock, porosity is assessed by 

calculating the voids that exist in the volume of rock that was considered to be reservoir, i.e. the 

NTG. Using the example of Figure 7-7, in unit B, the NTG is 89.7%, and porosity is 8,2%. This 

means that of those 89.7% of rock that is considered reservoir, only 8.2% is pore space.  



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 211 

In a Basement rock, where there is no reservoir space apart from that given by the fractures, 

when NTG is calculated (in the present case it was calculated by DFN simulation), it is already 

accounting for the pore space that would be given by porosity, because what is being calculated is 

the total volume of rock that is occupied by open fractures, i.e. the volume of space that exists 

between fracture walls – or fracture porosity. Hence, for volume calculation purposes two 

alternatives can be used: 

 

1. Assess NTG and use ? = 1. 

2. Assess porosity (methods on how calculate fracture porosity are described ahead) and use 

NTG=1, using the same logic described above.  

 

For obtaining fracture porosity, the following methods can be used: 

 

1. Using the empirical formula:  

 

Phi = 0.001 x Wf x Df x KF1 

 

Where: Wf= fracture aperture (millimetres); Df= fracture frequency (fractures/meter); KF= 
number of main fracture directions (1, 2, 3…) 

 

Using data from the FMI measurements we can calculate the porosity for the three fracture 

families using Wf= 0.001-0.6 mm; Df= 2.6 + 1.6 + 1 (maximum observed density in wells for each 

family); KF=3 because we are calculating values for the three families. Table 7-6 shows the 

porosity values calculated for the three fracture families observed in the wells. The same values 

will be used for Blocks A and B.

2. Using Permeability modelling results where porosity was calculated through the area of 

fractures and apertures. Notice that the area was calculated by FTRIAN software for each polygon 

using a polynomial law and it has an average of 1.75 m
2
, which means that values of porosity are 

highly conditioned by this value, which in its turn is conditioned by the inputs given on the models 

(the FMI data). Porosity values per fracture family are presented in Table 7-7.

3. Using average porosity values found in the literature. Bulk fracture porosity values of between 

0.1 and 1% are typical for fractured reservoirs including basement (Nelson 2001, Narr et al 2000; 

Gutmanis, GeoSciense Ltd, 2010); hence, for volume calculation, a range of fracture porosity 

between a minimum of 0.1%  and a maximum of 1% and will be used. 

 

Notice that assuming that there is no matrix porosity is considered to be a valid approach because 

we are dealing with a micashist, and even if there was porosity, it would be so low that it would 

be insignificant in terms of storage capacity of the reservoir. 

 

Shc: Hydrocarbon Saturation is the average ratio of the pore volume occupied by hydrocarbons 

before hydrocarbon production. Water saturation is usually calculated first because of its direct 

derivation mainly from the petrophysical evaluation of well data. 

 

 Shc = 1- Sw Where Sw is the water saturation - the average ratio of pore volume in a 

   rock that is occupied by formation water.  

 

From the well logs presented in Section 6, determining water saturation is not possible, because 

accurate resistivity measurements to input in Archie’s equation, for Sw derivation are not possible 

to make. This way, and because we are calculating volumes for the HC bearing zone of the 

basement (given by the GRV) we assume that the fractures are saturated with hydrocarbons. 

Hence Shc= 100%. 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 213 

FVF: Formation volume factor (FVF) is the average ratio of the hydrocarbon volume (oil, gas) at 

standard surface conditions to the hydrocarbon volume (oil, gas) at reservoir conditions. 

When oil is produced, the high reservoir temperature and pressure decreases to surface 

conditions and gas bubbles out of the oil. As the gas bubbles out of the oil, the volume of the oil 

decreases. Stabilized oil under surface conditions (either 60º F and 14.7 psi or 15º C and 101.325 

kPa) is called stock tank oil.  

Oil reserves are calculated in terms of stock tank oil volumes rather than reservoir oil volumes. 

The ratio of stock tank volume to oil volume under reservoir conditions is called the Formation 

Volume Factor (FVF). It usually varies from 1.0 to 1.7. A formation volume factor of 1.4 is 

characteristic of high-shrinkage oil and 1.2 of low-shrinkage oil, and it should be calculated. FVF 

values are dependant on the hydrocarbon composition and depth (initial pressure) of the 

reservoir.  

For the SEAL Basin, FVF was calculated by using HC properties such as the API gravity, formation 

temperature and pressure data (taken from the DST’s at Basement depth). As Gas-Oil-Ratio (GOR) 

was not available, a series of plausible values were used, excluding the results which returned 

bubble point pressure values higher than the formation pressure. The results suggest that a range 

of FVF between a minimum of 1.07 (m
3
/Sm

3
) and a maximum of 1.23 (m

3
/Sm

3
) with a mode value 

of 1.14 (m
3
/Sm

3
) can be used in a Stretched Beta distribution. 

 

HC Water Contact: In the SEAL Basement, establishing the HCWC is a difficult task. As it can be 

seen from Section 6 the depth to where HC was found varies from well to well. The fact that DST’s 

have not been undertaken in a consistent manner, and the presence of a well with positive results 

in a structurally lower position than GALP wells,  does not help to determine where the OWC 

should be placed. Two situations were considered (Figure 7-8):  

 

HCWC determined by field wide communication: If a fracture extends below the HCWC, it can 

contain both water and HC, but if the fracture system is in pressure communication, which is 

common, it is expected to encounter a linear HCWC that reflects that pressure communication 

and does not let water rise above a certain depth. 

HCWC determined by fracture extension: in the case of a Basement reservoir, matrix porosity is 

null, and hence only fractures can contain HC or water. This causes the HCWC to be defined 

accordingly to the open fractures extension, which is not linear, and consequently it will be an 

irregular limit.  



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 214 

 

As the HCWC value had to be considered and there was no available data on a field wide fracture 

communication, it was decided to assume that this contact was irregular and determined by the 

fracture extension. HCWC was confined to the spill point, which was decided to position at the 

lowest contour, above which HC were found (1200m, as it can be seen in Figure 7-2, BR-01 well). 

As the deepest oil found (confirmed by DST testing) was at 1402m depth – Bravo and Golf wells – 

it was decided to use a uniform distribution between 1042 m and 1200m.

Notice that it is not linear, as some fractures may extend below the oil column and contain water. The 
water content will depend on the extent of the fractures below the oil column.

 215 

Spill Point: as stated the spill point was decided to position at 1200m, the lowest contour, above 

which HC were found.  

 

Reservoir Thickness: 455m for Block A and 610m for Block B corresponding to the maximum 

thickness between the lowest depth to which HC were found and the crest of the structure. 

 

Recovery Factor: without any long-term test data and/or historical data, establishing the 

Recovery Factors was based on analogues. For Haaban field in Yemen, fractured basement 

recovery factors are described to be around 15% (Legrand, Kok, Neff, &amp;amp; Clemens, 2010). It was 

then decided to assume a distribution of recovery factors between 10 and 20%.  

 
Several scenarios for volume calculations will be run for each of the fracture families. 

• Scenario 1: NTG is a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum values of 

Table 7-5 and ?=1 for each of the fracture families.  

• Scenario 2: Porosity is uniform distribution between minimum and maximum values of 

Table 7-6 and NTG=1 for each of the fracture families. 

• Scenario 3: Porosity is a stretched beta distribution between values of Table 7-7 and 

NTG=1 for each of the fracture families. 

• Scenario 4: uses porosity values taken from literature on Fractured Basement reservoirs in 

a uniform distribution and NTG=1.  

 

Calculations were made in GeoX? using the above parameters. Total Mean STOOIP (Stock Tank 

Oil Originally In Place) are shown in Table 7-8.

 217 

The following considerations can be made relative to the results presented in Table 7-8 and 

Figures 7-9 and 7-10: 

• Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 output similar volumes. Notice that both scenarios use FMI data 

(fracture aperture and maximum observed density in wells) to calculate NTG (Scenario 1) or 

Porosity (Scenario 2). The difference between them is the methodology: 

In Scenario 1, an inverse approach was used and NTG was assessed by simulating fractures 

with a determined area so that the linear density value of 2.6 could be reached, and then it 

was calculated what was the correspondent fracture density – the NTG – was calculated. 

In Scenario 2, a well known and empirical formula uses values of aperture and density 

together with a multiplication factor that corresponds to the number of families found, to 

calculate porosity.  

The fact that  NTG values from Scenario 1 and Porosity values from Scenario 2 are of the same 

order of magnitude, supports the logic used for volumes calculations described above (see page 

210), and explains why STOOIIP values are similar.  

 

• Scenario 3 shows very low values of STOOIIP. This method utilises data derived from modelling 

and can be seen as either highly pessimistic or realistic. Pessimistic due to the possibility of the 

existence of a series of compounding errors caused by the various inputs used to create the 

models. The low porosity, however may be a realistic estimation of fracture porosity within a 

non-brittle rock (such as this mica-schist) compared to the analogue data which represents 

more brittle fractured reservoirs – Scenario 4.    

 

• As expected, Scenario 4 shows the largest values of STOOIIP as fracture porosity used was taken 

from literature on Fractured Basement Reservoirs. Most of these consist of brittle rocks such as 

granites, gneisses or basalts, rheological characteristic that causes the rock to be more prone to 

fracturing and hence fracture density and fracture apertures to be larger. This, in its turn 

influences the storage capacity of the rock - more volumes of HC are capable of being stored in 

brittle rocks. Scenario 4 can be seen as the comparison term for the other three scenarios, as all 

parameters except porosity are the same. Notice that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 have STOOIP 

values which are close – but lower – than STOOIP outputted from this Scenario 4. This 

difference can be explained by lithological differences: SEAL Basement rocks are michashits 

which are less brittle than those rocks used as a model in Scenario 4 and consequently will have 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 218 

lower fracture density and porosity which will account for lower volumes of stored 

hydrocarbons. 

 

In sum, all the four simulated scenarios are relatively inaccurate, which is supported by the large 

variation of STOOIIP, ranging from 60 MMBo (Scenario 4 – Block-B) to 0.38 MMBo (Scenario 3 – 

Block A). Nevertheless, it was decided to consider Scenario 1 and 2 as the most acceptable. Notice 

that both are based on direct observations using the FMI tool (aperture and density), meaning 

that there are no errors related to modelling assumptions, and at the same time STOOIIP is 

probably higher than what has been calculated, as measurements from FMI tool are 

underestimated due to the relation between vertical well and sub-vertical fractures as stated 

previously. 

 

Considering this, and the recoverable factor that was decided to use (10%-20%) it’s expected 

around 4.5 to 7.8 MMBo to be recovered. Even though these values can be largely increased 

depending on the production methods used, and hence this estimation should not be considered 

as definitive as it can change along the field development cycle.

7.2.2 Directional and Underbalanced Drilling 

As it was mentioned in Section 4.2.8.1, drilling directional wells at an angle from vertical in a 

direction normal to fracture planes and parallel to the minimum in situ stress, where most 

fractures can be intersected, is the recommend strategy by most authors (Nelson, 2001; Aguilera, 

1995, Ehlig, 2000). Using an analogy with horizontal wells it’s useful to demonstrate how this 

strategy is standard use in the industry. 

Horizontal drilling was not a popular technique before the 1990’s. Oil companies only drilled 

horizontal wells in difficult situations as a “last resort”. Analysing a graphic of the global total for 

1989 it is easy to verify that only 200 horizontal wells had been drilled. In 1990 that total 

increased to almost 1200 wells, with nearly 1000 of these drilled in the USA (Figure 7-11). What 

was then the factor that determined this dramatic change? 

 

Figure 7-11: After great success in the USA in 1989, the global number of horizontal wells increased 
dramatically (www.slb.com – Horizontal Highlights). 

 

It was the great success obtained in the Austin Chalk play in Texas, which transformed horizontal 

drilling into a mainstream technique. Activity in this formation soared from just 10 horizontal 

wells in 1989 to more than 200 in 1990.  

The efficiency of this method relative to vertical wells is demonstrated by several examples:  

 

1. In Canada, horizontal drilling became the solution for the oil sands where the viscous oils 

resulted in excessive water and/or gas production through coning effect, when vertical wells were

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 220 

used. Through horizontal wells, oil can be produced at low pressures without reducing production 

rates and keeping gas and water away from production wells (Figure 7-12).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure 7-12: Comparison of oil production rates between vertical and horizontal wells in Canada’s Devonian 
Rainbow Reef Reservoir, adapted from F.J. McIntyre, et. al. (1994)  (www.slb.com – Horizontal Highlights). 

 

2. As stated previously in the Natih Field, Oman, the chalky limestones are heavily fractured. The 

difference in production rates between a directional well and a vertical well spans from around 

3700 bbl/day to 530 bbl/day, respectively. 

 

3. In Georgia’s Ninotsiminda Field, a vertical well was drilled in 2000 into the oil producing 

formation, with production tests stabilising at a flow of 200 bbl/day. In 2003 an appraisal 

horizontal well was drilled increasing the production to 2200 bbl/day.

 221 

These successful examples from different parts of the world prove that horizontal/directional 

drilling is a valid technique that can be used in very different geological settings. This author 

considers that in SEAL the execution of a directional well, instead of the traditional vertical wells, 

would lead to better results, i.e. higher production rates, by increasing the contact area of the 

well with the fractures. Adding to this, the well should be planned in a way so that it is drilled near 

a fault, particularly at a fault tip, as it was explained in Section 5.6.2.1. 

 

As stated previously Family A is the fracture family which should be intersected with this well. 

Two reasons support this option: 

 

- Higher Density: FMI well data show that Family A is the most frequent fracture family to be 

found with 104 measurements of open fractures inside the Basement. This is supported by DFN 

models.  

 

- Higher Permeability and Porosity: Permeability models based on DFN and Geomechanical 

modelling show that Family A is by far the fracture family with higher permeability and porosity 

values.  

 

According to Family A average fracture orientation taken from the FMI readings (Table 6-11), 

obtaining a well orientation which is perpendicular to it is straightforward (Figure 7-13) This well 

should have a 30º inclination and should be drilled in the direction of the 240º azimuth in order to 

perpendicularly intersect the N22ºW/60ºNE Family A fractures. With this orientation it is expected 

that the well (which is called Hotel following the same alphabetic logic used previously) presents 

better results than the seven wells drilled previously, as it is intersecting the open fractures which 

are predominant in the Basement rock. Figure 7-14 shows a schematic representation of Hotel 

Well relative to Bravo Well.

In any well proposal, justifying the costs is imperative. To do so, a well cost simulation was made, 

using as a reference Fox well, as well as other wells done in Brazil in a different basin but with 

similar drilling equipment, timeline and geological conditions. The simulation is presented in Table 

7-9.  The complete cost breakdown is presented in the Appendix of this thesis.

Table 7-9: Cost comparison between Fox Well and the Hotel Well. Hotel is simulated directional and 
directional+underbalanced, both for a maximum inclination of 30º and an average build-up-rate (BUR) of 
3º/30m.  Notice that the extra cost in order to drill in underbalanced conditions relative to a directional well 
is close to $70.000 and that the total cost of the well is of $2.9M, which is around $590K more than a 
regular vertical well.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

From this simulation, it can be observed that the extra cost in order to drill in underbalanced 

conditions relative to a directional well is close to $70.000 and that the total cost of the well is of 

$2.9M, which is around $590K more than a regular vertical well (relative to Fox). Hence, a 

directional well would have a 22% cost increase and a directional plus underbalanced well an 

increase of 25%. As such, and taking into account the advantages that were outlined in Section 

4.2.8.1 and 4.2.8.2 for directional and underbalance drilling , this author considers that:  

 

• Drilling the Hotel well directionally and according to the orientation that was presented 

above is imperative in order to maximize the contact are of the well with the fracture 

network of Family A. 

• With an increase of 3% in cost relative to a directional well, drilling Hotel underbalanced is 

an option to be taken into account, as examples show that the reduction in well count 

(the number of wells drilled to achieve a certain productivity) could be as high as 25% as a 

result of the increased productivity –  answering to this question immediately as there is 

early production of HC while drilling due to the non-invasion of the fractures by heavy 

drilling fluid.

8. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

 
The final considerations to sum the analysis of the SEAL Fractured Basement Reservoir can be 

divided in three general topics:  

 

1. Considerations on the fracture system that affects the Basement 

2. Considerations on the adopted workflow and on the achieved results. 

3. Considerations for future work. 

 

1. Considerations on the fracture system that affects the Basement 

From the analysis of the references in the literature, seismic, well data (FMI and DST data), it was 

possible to conclude that the Basement rock in the area of Block-A and Block-B is highly fractured.  

Statistical analysis of the FMI measurements allowed the identification of several fracture 

families, of which one – Family A – was considered to be the most common as it was found in all 

seven wells.  

Conjugating FMI data with seismic and by applying geomechanical principles, and DFN modelling, 

it was possible to simulate how fractures are distributed in the basement rock and as a final 

product  generate comparative simulated permeability and porosity graphics. These showed that 

fracture Family A is the one which presents the highest values of both permeability and porosity.  

 

2. Considerations on the adopted workflow and on the achieved results 

The fact that only indirect data (FMI, DST and seismic data) were used to create permeability 

models for the fractured Basement, lends some inaccuracy to these models, as fracture densities 

and apertures are underestimated due to the relation vertical-well VS sub-vertical fractures. Even 

though, and considering that the objective was to define a fracture family that could be 

intersected with a directional well, i.e. a comparison between the properties of the several 

fracture familes, the objective was totally achieved. If the permeability and porosity values are 

not accurate, the error will be in the underestimation direction which allows saying that better 

results than those that were predicted are expected.   

 

3. Considerations for future work. 

When dealing with Naturally Fractured Reservoirs, it is imperative to define a fracture family 

which presents the higher permeability index so that drilling campaigns can be planned 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 226 

accordingly, in order to achieve higher production rates. This thesis proved that Family A is the 

best candidate, and a directional well with 30º inclination drilled in the direction of the 240º 

azimuth should be drilled as an alternative to the vertical wells. At the same time, and because 

fractured reservoirs are a system sensitive to high pressures, an underbalanced well was 

proposed.

A. Cores 

Cores represent the most important direct source of information for fractured rock analaysis.  

They are used to determine reservoir quality and performance by summing together the 

individual small-scale elements of the reservoir that can be “read” on the core. Most authors 

recommend that, on the first exploratory wells, the fractured reservoir section should be cored. 

Two types of cores can be taken: side-wall cores and whole-core samples. Whole-core samples 

are useful in fracture evaluation for two reasons: 

 

1. They sample a relatively large volume of rock and consequently potentially sample more 

regularly-spaced reservoir fractures than side-wall cores; 

 

2. Standard permeability analyses can be performed in three dimensions on these samples 

(vertical, maximum horizontal and horizontal 90 degrees to maximum horizontal 

permeability).  

 

Permeability analysis, allows the calculation of the absolute permeability of a fracture (or fracture 

system) at surface conditions and the simulation of the permeability anisotropy that fractures 

cause. In addition, correlative fractured and unfractured plugs taken from the whole-core samples 

can be subjected to tests done in confining pressure or under a variety of mixed loading 

conditions that simulate burial conditions, with the objective of measuring the variation in 

fracture and matrix properties. Determinations of fracture permeability under confining pressure 

are very important because open fractures are generally higher in absolute permeability than the 

matrix, but also much more compressible and, therefore, reduce in permeability and porosity 

faster than the matrix with the application of force (Jones, 1975; Nelson and Handin, 1977; and 

Nelson, 1981b).  

 

Some general procedures that should be used in coring fractured formations are: 

1. Use a core barrel liner of either plastic or aluminium. It helps keep the core intact and 

prevents jamming.  

2. Most fractured rocks are usually the hardest most brittle rocks; hence there is a tendency 

to weight up on the bit to maintain penetration rate. However if weight on the string is 

too high, extension fractures in front of the coring bit might be generated. These are then 

captured in the core as “centerline fractures.” They will also show up in the borehole wall 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 229 

on image logs (FMI, etc.), and get in the way of interpreting the real fractures. This way it 

is important that the driller doesn’t put to much weight on the bit, and that this weight is 

as constant as possible throughout the coring.   

3. Special handling of the core is often needed. If we are interested in natural fractures, 

removing the core from the barrel with a sledge hammer is not a good idea. 

4. Care should also be taken during twist-off at the bottom of the core. Aggressive twist-off 

in breaking the core off bottom may generate helical induced fractures in the bottom of 

the core. 

5. Coring fractured rocks should be done as continuously as possible. The longer the core, 

the larger recovery rates obtained. 

6. In some hard rocks, some workers add the Hugel Knives to the mouth of the core barrel. 

These knives create the orienting scribes on the core when taking an oriented core. The 

idea is that the knives keep the fractured core from spinning as it enters the barrel and, 

therefore, prevents jamming. 

7. Drillers should not trip too fast, as this often causes problems and damage the core. 

 

A complete analysis of a core should include at least the following evaluations (Aguilera, 1993):  

• Fracture types description 

• Grain density 

• Petrophysical parameters “m” (cementation exponent) and “n” (saturation exponent) 

• Whole core porosity and permeability (at room conditions and some samples at simulated net 

overburden pressure) 

• Routine core analysis 

• Capillary pressures and relative permeabilities 

• Wettability determination in a preserved core 

• Imbibition recoveries if the rock proves to be water wet 

• Mechanical testing (Poisson’s ratio, Young’ modulus, stress strain analysis, matrix and fracture 

compressibility) 

• Thin section analysis 

• SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis 

• Epoxy impregnation 

• Spectrometric gamma ray and sonic velocity 

• Solubility

• Non-destructive permeability determinations with a pressure decay profile permeameter 

• Core scale pressure transient analysis  and microsimulation of the fractured core.

 231 

B. Drill Stem Tests 

Drill Stem Test (DST) is a procedure for isolating and testing the surrounding geological formation 

through the drill pipe. Generally DST’s main objectives are (Trilobite Testing Inc. Manual):  

• To assess the well potential  and hence its commerciality 

• To evaluate well damage 

• To evaluate the reservoir pressure and permeability and to characterize the reservoir 

heterogeneities 

• To estimate a connected volume  

• To obtain samples of the reservoir fluid, for PVT, flow assurance and process studies. 

 

These tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened 

and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve (Figure B-1). One or more 

pressure gauges are mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is 

completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the 

annulus between the drillstring and the borehole wall, thereby forcing any produced fluids to 

enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis 

is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with 

an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. In low-permeability formations or where the 

production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, 

surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the 

drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. 

Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental 

reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is 

accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottom-hole valve is opened. These tests are 

called closed-chamber tests.

Drillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining 

whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased 

prior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, 

therefore obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. 

The typical DST will be split into four periods, pre-flow, initial shut-in period, main-flow period and 

a final shut-in period (Figure B-3). Times for each test are dependent on conditions at the well 

site. DST’s can be run at any time during the drilling operation at the current depth, or may be 

used to test any interval in the hole after TD has been reached. Using these data, and based on 

the evaluation of engineers and geologists, management can base a decision to complete the hole 

for potential production of oil or gas or proceed with abandonment.  

 

Initial Flow Period: is a production period to clean up the well, and is used to remove any 

supercharge given to the formation due to mud infiltrating into the prospective formation during 

the drilling operation. 

Initial Shut-In Period: this period allows the formation to recover from pressure surges caused 

during pre-flow. Is often referred to as “closed in for the pressure build up” and is a longer period. 

It allows determining the initial reservoir pressure.  

Main Flow Period: a more lengthy production period designed to test the formation flow 

characteristics more rigorously. Flowing pressures and temperatures will be recorded. During this 

period surface blow is also recorded and interpreted.  

 

Surface Blow Interpretation (Figure B-2): surface blow action is caused by the entry of fluid or 

gas into the empty drill string. As the fluid or gas enters the empty drill string (through the 

test tool) the air is displaced out of the top of the drill string. This results in a blow of air at the 

surface that can be measured. The procedure normally used is to place one end of the bubble 

hose into a 5 gallon bucket of water. The “BLOW” description is based on the level of bubbling 

action in the bucket of water. 

 

Weak blow at surface indicates slow entry of recovery into the drillstem. This can be caused 

by several things: 

a. Tight zone-low permeability 

b. Plugged anchor or tool 

c. Highly damaged test zone 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 234 

d. Low Pressure test zone 

 

Strong blow usually indicates that there is rapid entry into the drillstem. This indicates: 

a. good zone-good permeability 

b. good pressure 

 

 

 

 

Figure B-2: surface blow equipment and blow classification. Source: Trilobite Testing Inc. DST guidebook 

 

Final Shut-In: formation pressure is recorded over this period. The shape of the pressure build up 

curve will tell us the permeability of the formation, the degree of formation damage (likely caused 

during drilling operation).  

 

As said, the drill stem testing technique, the well is controlled by a down hole shut in valve.  

Before the test, the well is usually partially filled with a liquid cushion designed to apply a 

hydrostatic pressure “B” above the valve, smaller than the formation pressure “E”. When the 

tester valve is opened, an instantaneous drop of pressure is transmitted to the formation, and 

fluids from the formation start to flow into the well, it’s the Initial-Flow Period (“C” to “D”). In 

case of liquid flow, the level rises in the production string and the backpressure due to the liquid 

column increases. The well is then shut-in for a pressure build-up (“D” to “E”) – Initial Shut-In 

Period. When no flow to surface is desired, the down-hole valve is closed before the liquid level 

has reached the surface. If surface production is possible, the flow time is extended until the well 

produces at surface and the rate tends to stabilize. The DST procedure then becomes similar to 

that of a standard production test.  



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 235 

The well is then opened for the test and, due to the backpressure of the rising liquid column, the 

bottom-hole pressure increases (“F” to “G”). Finally, the well is shut-in for a final build up period 

(“G” to “H”). The “I” point is the final hydrostatic pressure.

The registration of the reservoir pressures, and sampled fluids in a DST, allows the engineer or 

geologist to take some conclusions on the reservoir and on the wellbore conditions. Some 

important examples are: 

 

- Permeability 

- Wellbore Damage 

- Reservoir Depletion 

- Reservor Barrier 

 

Permeability: It is possible to state the relative level of formation permeability within the region 

of the wellbore being tested (assuming a fairly homogeneous interval). Below are three pressure 

graphics showing different levels of permeability (Figure B-4).

Figure B-4: DST pressure charts from three different formations. a) low permeability; b) average 
permeability c) high permeability. Source: PetroMehras.com 

 

A) low permeability formations produce build-up curves that suggest the pressure is 

beginning to stabilize. They have very low pressure increases, if any, during the flow 

periods. There will be a weak blow at the surface, small fluid recovery and fairly low flowing 

pressures. 

 

B) average permeability formations exhibit better developed build-up curves during the 

shut-in periods and some pressure build-up during the flow periods as fluids enter the 

wellbore. There should be a good blow, moderate fluid recovery, and increased pressures 

from one period to the next 

 

C) high permeability formations will have high flow rate (strong blow), high flowing 

pressures, and rapid stabilization of pressure during build-up. The one shown here has 

stabilized with the flow pressure almost equal to the final shut-in pressure. 

 

Wellbore Damage: Drillstem Tests are perhaps the best way to determine if the wellbore as 

suffered damage due to drilling procedures. It does not define the cause but it does estimate the 

presence and magnitude of damage. A low recovery on a test may be the result of damage rather 

than poor producing ability.  

 

Causes of Wellbore Damage 

1. Invasion of filtrate (clay content/chemical inbalance): filtrate invasion occurs when a zone 

has permeability and the mud system has a potential for water loss. The hydrostatic mud 

weight, water loss properties of the mud, and the chemical-osmotic potentials between 

the mud and formation determine the amount of filtrate that enters the formation.  

 



Universidade de Aveiro • GALP E&amp;amp;P 

S. Esperancinha   SEAL Basin Fractured Basement - Challenging the Exploration Paradigm 

 237 

2. Invasion of solids: solids invasion occurs when a zone has high permeability and a large 

pressure differential between hydrostatic and formation pressure. Drilling mud can be 

packed into the wellbore. The solids may be immobile when testing owing to the 

viscosities and pore geometries. 

 

3. Mechanical damage: Mechanical damage is induced by the rotary drilling procedure. 

Often fine particles, created by the grinding of rock chips, are forced into the wellbore. 

 

Wellbore damage DST’s exhibit a weak blow at the surface and very little recovery (Figure B-5). 

Pressure charts indicate low flowing pressures and a sharp pressure rise after the tool is shut-in. A 

short radius pressure transition during build up followed by a flat pressure increase is also 

characteristic of a damaged wellbore. If the wellbore cleans up during the test, then there will be 

a change in the character of the curves (Figure B-6).

radius pressure transition during build up followed by a flat pressure.

Depletion: In a normal DST, a drop in pressure between the initial and final stabilized shut-in 

values indicates a limited of finite reservoir provided the initial value has not been affected by 

supercharging. The produced fluids have caused a measurable depletion (“drawdown”) of the 

reservoir. A pressure change of 1.5% or greater is considered serious and more careful evaluation 

or re-testing is required. A barrier effect or nearby production may also the same effect to be 

recorded (Figure B-7 A). 

 

Reservoir Barrier: Figure B-7-B is an excellent example of a decrease in pressure build-up levels 

between the initial and final flow periods. These are caused by a reservoir barrier or a 

permeability problem as opposed to depletion. The change in the slope of the build-up curve 

indicates a reduction in transmissibility some distance from the wellbore.

C. Borehole Images (Formation Micro Imager ) 

 

Borehole images are electronic pictures of the rocks and fluids that are found when a wellbore is 

drilled. Such images are made by electrical, acoustic or video devices which are lowered into the 

well. Images are oriented, have vertical and lateral resolution, and provide critical information 

such as bedding dip, fractures, faults, unconformities, paleocurrent directions, vuggy and fracture 

porosity. These images are best used when in conjunction with other available wellbore data such 

as other logs, cuttings, cores and production data. For the present purpose, only electrical 

borehole images are of importance. 

 

Electrical borehole images are based on dipmeter technology that has been commercially 

available since the 1950s (Bigelow, 1985, Gilbreath, 1987) (Figure C-1). The recent tools are 

sophisticated versions of this kind of technology.

Logging Routine 

The modern imaging tools have microresistivity electrodes arranged around the tool on pads that 

are pressed against the borehole wall. The tool is first introduced in the well with the pads closed. 

At the start of each run, four, six or eight pads are pressed against the wall. The number of pads 

depends on the logging device which is being used (different companies, use different tools – 

Figures C-2 and C-3). 

Electrical current is forced into the rock through the electrodes, and remote sensors measure the 

current after it interacts with the formation (Figure C-4 and C-5). Data retrieved include multiple 

electrode readings, calliper readings from individual pads or pairs of paids, and x-, y- and z-axis 

accelerometer and magnetometer readings. Borehole deviation and tool orientation (relative to 

pad 1) are determined by the magnetometers. 

The sample rate for electrode and accelerometer data is very high (around 400 samples/), and thr 

areal coverage of the borehole face is a function of the width of the electrode arrays, number of 

pads, and borehole diameter. Generally, 40 to 80% of the borehole face is imaged, appearing the 

unimaged parts of as blank strips between the pads. The depth of investigation is small, usually 

less than 2,5 cm into the formation. Logging rate is comparable to other logs, being around 

550m/h.

Data Processing 
From what was said above, it is fair to conclude that a processed electrical borehole image is 

basically a map of rock resisitivity at the borehole face. As it is very difficult to examine borehole 

images in 3-D, it is common to “cut” the borehole along true north, and then unroll the cylinder 

until it becomes a 2D view. Planar features that intersect the cylindrical borehole will appear as 

sine waves in the 2D view (Figure C-6). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure C-6: Schematic diagram of a vertical cylindrical borehole intersected by a planar feature such as a 
steeply dipping fracture. After the cylinder correspondent to the borehole is unrolled and geo-referenced, 

the line of intersection becomes a sinusoidal curve which can be identified through strike and dip. Hurdley, 
2004; Borehole Images, in G. Asquish and D. Krygowski, Basic Well Log Analysis: AAPG Methods in 
Exploration 16. Newberry (1998) after Schlumberger (1983) and Höcker et al. (1990) 
 

 

Other processing steps that need to be operated: 

- Correcting the directional data – pad 1 azimuth, which gives the tool orientation – and 

hole azimuth for magnetic declination. 

- Accelerometer corrections to make sure that the accelerometer curve is on depth 

with the resistivity traces. The accelerometer accounts for differential sticking speed 

variations and resonant vibrations that occur as the tool moves up-hole (Figure C-7). 

- Depth shifting so that rows of buttons are in line where the same slice of the 

borehole, perpendicular to the tool, was imaged.

After the corrections have been made, the image assigned with a colour map to different ranges 

of resistivity values, which are then positioned in their popper geometric position around the 

wellbore. Normally the colour scale ranges from black to white, and yellows and browns in the 

middle. By convention low-resistivity features such as shales or fluid filled fractures appear as 

dark colours, and high-resistivity features such as sandstones and limestones, are displayed as 

shades of brown, yellow and white (Figure C-8).

Two types of processed images can be created: static and dynamic (Figure C-10).  

 

Static: images which have had on contrast setting applied to the entire well image. These images 

are useful to detect relative changes in rock resistivity along the borehole 

 

Dynamic:  dynamic images had a variable contrast applied in a moving window, providing 

enhanced views of features such as vugs, fractures and bed boundaries. They allow the 

interpreter to detect subtle features in rocks that have very low resistivities, such as shales, and 

very high resistivities such as carbonates and crystalline rocks.

Figure C-9: Comparison between static (left) and dynamic (right) images in a sandstone. Notice that the 
application of a dynamic colour bar, in which the image contrast is normalized in a 5-ft moving window, 
sharpens the image and allows sedimentary features easier to see. T is a truncation surface, and the green 

sine wave is fitted to a bedding plane. Hurdley, 2004; Borehole Images, in G. Asquish and D. 
Krygowski, Basic Well Log Analysis: AAPG Methods in Exploration 16. Newberry (1998) after 
Schlumberger (1983) and Höcker et al. (1990). 
 
Interpretation 

The interpretation of image logs, consists in scrolling through the processed log on a computer, 

viewing dynamic or static images and fitting sine waves to the geological features that are 

considered to be of importance – bed boundaries, fractures, foliations etc. Automated dip-picking 

programs are available, and the interpreter can choose to edit dips already picked by various 

computer algorithms. The most common use of borehole images is in the area of structural 

interpretation, especially detecting and orienting fractures and faults. These can be identified 

through the following features in the image log (Figure C-11): 

 

- Resistivity lineaments in the shape of a sine wave usually cross cutting the formation  

- Wellbore breakouts 

- Changes in bedding orientation

plane is obtained by an image log interpretation software (B). After the interpreter has identified a planar 
feature on the log, he draws a sine curve and the software positions the corresponding marker on a scale 
ranging from 0º to 90º of dip which is relative to the amplitude of the sine. The dip azimuth is located at the 
minimum of the sine wave and given by the small trace on the marker which points towards the correct 
direction.

When the wells are drilled with conductive mud (this is one important principle for the image logs 

to work), we can use this to identify and evaluate open faults and fractures. Hence, an open 

fracture will appear as a dark trace because is filled with low conductivity fluid (the mud) and a 

closed fracture will appear as a light trace on the log (Figure C-12). Healed fractures filled with 

calcite, anhydrite or quartz, will appear as a resistive trace, but if they are filled with clay or shale, 

then the fracture will show a conductive trace (dark). Using Gamma Ray logs can help solve these 

situations.

Natural and induced fractures can also be differentiated (Figure C-14 and C-14):  

Natural fractures: are created by the regional stress field and can occur as one or more 

fracture sets, each with a distinct orientation.  

Induced fractures: are generated during drilling by the subsurface stress, are commonly near 

vertical, have a well defined strike azimuth that is perpendicular to borehole breakouts, or 

oval elongations of the borehole.

Image logs can also be used to calculate fractures permeability. In the parallel-plate model for 

fluid flow in fractures (Brown, 1987), permeability is proportional to the square of fracture-

aperture with (Figure C-15). Present-day software already has an algorithm to make this 

calculation in an easy way.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure C-14: simple parallel-plate model for fluid flow in a fracture. L= length; d= aperture with; Q= flow 
rate; p= pressure; ?= viscosity; K= permeability. The Darcy equation for linear flow (Qx), when applied to 

this geometry, suggests that permeability is proportional to the square of the aperture width (Hurdley, 
2004; Borehole Images, in G. Asquish and D. Krygowski, Basic Well Log Analysis: AAPG Methods in 
Exploration 16; modified from Brown (1987)). 
 

 

Fracture density can also be calculated using two different calculation methods:  

 

Method 1: calculates the density of fractures within a certain unit interval along the wellbore. 

It is well applied in vertical wells (Figure C-16, red fractures).  

 

Method 2: corrects the density, by counting the number of fractures of an interval along a 

perpendicular line to the fracture plane. This is possible to account for the wellbore 

inclination. (Figure C-16, blue fractures).

Figure C-15: scheme of a directional wellbore showing the corrected fracture density – blue fractures. 

 
Breakouts can be used for indication of present-day in situ stress (Figure C-17). These breakouts 

when combined with the orientation of inferred natural and induced fracture sets may be related 

to directional permeability in the surface (Heffer and Lean, 1993). This information is important 

for optimizing the orientation of horizontal wells and configuring injection patterns is secondary 

and tertiary recovery schemes.
