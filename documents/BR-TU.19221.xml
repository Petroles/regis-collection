ABSTRACT 

The Brazilian oil and gas offshore exploration faces a high demand for advanced 

technology and know-how. For that reason, foreign suppliers of subsea equipment are 

increasingly attracted by this dynamic market.  

Against this background, this project develops an international strategy for the German 

marine cable distributor Friesland Kabel within the Brazilian offshore oil and gas supply 

chain. The project thus critically analyzes the external business environment and internal 

corporate resources by applying the PEST analysis, the Porter´s 5 Forces model and the VRIO 

framework. Core elements of the market entry strategy include a mission and vision 

statement, an objective setting, an entry mode selection, a SWOT analysis, a marketing 

concept and a strategic action plan. All business concepts and theories applied are prepared 

and assessed in detail. 

The result of the study shows, that despite the recent economic downturn in the country 

and the oil and gas industry, there is a certain market potential for Friesland Kabel in the long 

term. Additionally, the developed strategic measures provide a guideline about how the 

company can overcome main business barriers and leverage opportunities.

Sumário executivo 

No contexto da exploração de petróleo e gás offshore, o Brasil se torna um mercado de 

inovação para fornecedores de equipamento naval recebendo assim uma atenção significativa 

de investidores estrangeiros. O fornecedor alemão de cabos navais e tecnologia de rede 

offshore, Friesland Kabel, está avaliando este mercado como uma opção para a expansão de 

negócios há alguns anos. No entanto, a empresa ainda não chegou a uma conclusão se as 

condições de entrada no mercado são favoráveis e quais estratégias devem ser utilizadas. 

Neste contexto, o objetivo deste estudo é analisar o potencial da Friesland Kabel na indústria 

de petróleo e gás offshore do Brasil, bem como fornecer orientações para a gestão da entrada 

de mercado. Portanto, o estudo contém duas seções principais. 

 

Seção 1 avalia o potencial de mercado da Friesland Kabel em investigar o ambiente de 

negócios externo e os recursos internos da empresa. 

? A análise macroeconômica discute as restrições e oportunidades de negócios 

principais no mercado brasileiro através da aplicação do quadro PESTLE. Índices e 

estudos internacionais asseguram uma comparação entre países diferentes. 

? A análise da indústria investiga as oportunidades e as barreiras de negócios da 

indústria offshore brasileira e seus sub-segmentos relacionados. Além disso, o quadro 

Porter´s 5 Forces examina o ambiente competitivo da indústria. Dados sobre a 

rivalidade soã obtidas a partir de entrevistas com fornecedor de cabos navais que já 

operam no mercado. 

? O quadro VRIO serve como abordagem para determinar as capacidades e os recursos 

de Friesland Kabel. Estes são completados e avaliados por entrevistas com os 

principais executivos da empresa. 

 

Seção 2 trata da estratégia de entrada no mercado para Friesland Kabel. Assim, a estratégia 

é dividida nos seguintes elementos: 

? Em primeiro lugar, os principais objetivos corporatios são especificados através da 

produção de uma declaração de missão, visão e objectivos. 

? Através de uma análise SWOT são determinados os principais fatores que moldam a 

posição estratégica da Friesland Kabel. 



 

v 

 

? Com base nos fatores da análise SWOT são elaborados as ações estratégicas. Entre 

eles uma estratégia de estoque, gestão de clientes e uma abordagem passo-a-passo do 

mercado podem ser destacadas. 

? A decisão do modo de entrada é de principal importância. Aqui, o estudo centra-se em 

uma estratégia cooperativa, além de fornecer informações detalhadas sobre o design 

de parcerias potenciais. 

? Outra prioridade é a estratégia de marketing. Ao aplicar o enquadramento SAVE, um 

conceito de marketing baseado no valor é realizado. 

? Finalmente um plano de acção determina os conjuntos de medidas de gestão para 

Friesland Kabel.

Executive Summary  

In terms of the offshore oil and gas exploration, Brazil is in the process of becoming an 

innovation driven market for suppliers of marine equipment receiving significant attention 

from foreign investors. Friesland Kabel, a German supplier of marine cable and offshore 

network technology has been evaluating this market for several years as an option for 

business expansion. However, the company did not come to a conclusion as to whether the 

market entry conditions are favorable, and if so, which strategy should be pursued. Against 

this background, the objective of this study is to analyze the potential for Friesland Kabel in 

the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry and to provide guidance for managing the 

company´s market entrance. Therefore, the study contains two major sections. 

 

Section 1 assesses the market potential of Friesland Kabel by investigating the external 

business environment and the internal resources of the company.  

? The macroeconomic analysis discusses the main business restrictions and 

opportunities within the Brazilian market by applying the PESTLE framework. In 

doing so, international indices and studies provide an inter-country comparison. 

? The industry analysis investigates the opportunities and business barriers of the 

Brazilian offshore industry and its related sub-segments. Moreover, the Porter´s 5 

Forces framework examines the competitive environment of the industry. Data about 

the market rivalry is obtained from interviews with marine cable suppliers already 

operating on the market. 

? The VRIO framework serves as an approach to determine the competitive capabilities 

and resources of Friesland Kabel. This is completed and evaluated by interviews with 

key corporate members of staff. 

Section 2 deals with the market entry strategy for Friesland Kabel which is divided into the 

following elements: 

 

? First, the major corporate goals are specified by producing a mission and vision 

statement and setting the objectives. 

?  Through a SWOT analysis, the principal factors that shape the strategic position of 

Friesland Kabel are determined. 



 

vii 

 

? Based on the SWOT–factors, strategic actions are elaborated. Among them, a stock 

strategy, customer management and a step-by-step market approach can be 

highlighted. 

? The entry mode decision was of particular importance. Here, the study focuses on a 

cooperative strategy and provides detailed information on how to shape potential 

partnerships. 

? Another priority is the marketing strategy. By applying the SAVE framework, a value 

based marketing concept is introduced.  

? Finally, an action plan proposes the managerial measures of Friesland Kabel.

The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

1 

 

1. Introduction 

During the last two decades multinational enterprises (MNEs) have increasingly focused 

on emerging markets. In 2012 emerging economies have, for the first time, absorbed a higher 

share of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows than developed countries (United Nations, 

2013, p. 12) – a trend which continued in the following years (United Nations, 2014, p. 9). 

This development is in the interest of both parties - MNEs as investors and emerging 

economies as host markets. Western enterprises benefit from different sorts of local 

competitive advantages (Dunning, 2001, p. 176) whereas motives of the host countries 

include capital gains, job creation or transfer of know-how and technology. However, while 

emerging markets offer great opportunities, they also confront investors with different kinds 

of environmental challenges and transaction costs. For that reason, business organizations 

have to thoroughly assess these markets and consequently develop appropriate strategies. 

FDI in emerging countries is concentrated on a small group of markets characterized by 

wealth of natural resources, large populations and high economic growth rates (Weigel, et al., 

1997, p. 1). These include in particular the so-called “BRICS” which describes the association 

of the five major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa 

(O`Neill, 2001, pp. 1-11). 

 

1.1 Problem Formulation 

Being part of the BRICS group and the 7th largest economy in the world, Brazil nowadays 

is one of the most attractive markets for FDI. Especially the oil &amp;amp; gas industry, driven by 

recent discoveries of massive offshore petroleum and gas reserves, generates plenty of 

business opportunities. For the next two decades, the exploration of Brazilian offshore sources 

will require huge investments in infrastructure including the shipbuilding-, down- and 

upstream sector. According to experts, until 2020 half of the worldwide subsea equipment 

will be produced in Brazil. For that reason, international suppliers of business-related services 

and products increasingly focus on this dynamic market in which the demand for offshore 

technology, equipment and know-how is tremendously high (AHK; GTAI, 2014, p. 16). 

Germany has strong economic ties with Brazil, which is its Germany´s most important 

trading partner in Latin America. There are about 1.300 German companies in Brazil and the 

State of São Paulo is the biggest German business location outside the home country 

(Auswärtiges Amt, 2015). Some German companies have already become established within 

the Brazilian oil and gas supply chain. Friesland Kabel, a German distributor of marine

cables, wires and data system technology, also considers this possibility for expanding its 

business.  

1.2 Research Questions and Objectives 

Against this background, the present project deals with the potential and the market entry 

for Friesland Kabel in the Brazilian oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the work consists 

basically of two parts derived from two overriding questions: 

 

1. What is the potential for Friesland Kabel in order to create economic value within the 

Brazilian oil and gas industry? 

 

Based on this question, the first part of the work focuses on the attractiveness and the 

suitability of the Brazilian oil and gas market for Friesland Kabel. In this context, external 

market drivers and internal forces of the company will be identified and evaluated according 

to their business implications. To this aim, the research follows a top-down approach (Glowik 

&amp;amp; Smyczek, 2011, p. 66) by analyzing first the external macro environment, second the 

industry sector, and third the company´s internal resources and capabilities.  

 

2. How can Friesland Kabel ensure a successful market entry into the Brazilian offshore 

oil and gas industry? 

 

With regard to the previously identified external and internal forces, the objective of the 

second part is to develop an appropriate market entry strategy. This involves mainly the 

elaboration of measures to overcome business barriers and to leverage market opportunities. 

 

The two parts described above correspond to the first two phases of a strategic planning 

process: (1) Strategic Position and (2) Strategic Choice (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 49). In this 

sense, the present project can be understood as an international strategy for Friesland Kabel.  

Although the project focuses on one case, the results also provide inductive insights for 

other business organizations. The overall objectives of this project are to strengthen the 

bilateral trade between both countries, Brazil and Germany in general, to support German 

direct investment in the Brazilian offshore market and to guarantee long term market success 

for Friesland Kabel.

1.3 Methodology 

In accordance with the research questions, the case study approach is the most appropriate 

methodology for this project. In comparison with other research methods, case studies provide 

more insightful explanations (Yin, 2012, p. 5) and are preferred for contemporary (as opposed 

to historical events) and real-life events in which the researcher cannot control or manipulate 

the behavior of samples (Dul &amp;amp; Hak, 2008, p. 6). 

In terms of design the project focuses on one case and a single unit of analysis (holistic, 

single case) (Yin, 2012, pp. 7-8). This choice is the logical consequence of the research 

objective, which is to develop an international strategy for Friesland Kabel (single case) 

within the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry (single unit of analysis).  

The data used in this project mainly consists of derived data (secondary data) in contrast to 

data in natural settings (primary data) (Bromley, 1986, p. 13). This type of data is obtained 

from websites, articles, reports, statistics, books and economics magazines. 

Where the project deals with the internal resources of Friesland Kabel and the competition 

in the company’s related industry primary data is collected in addition.  

For the analysis of Friesland Kabels sources of competitive advantage it was important to 

identify the individual perceived strengths and weaknesses from an internal perspective. Due 

to the complexity of this research topic, semi-structured interviews based on two core 

standard questions have been conducted. By following this approach, it was possible to, on 

the one hand, use a uniform interview structure, and on the other, to address specific aspects 

in greater depth (Mitchell &amp;amp; Jolley, 2012, pp. 301-302). The selection of the respondents was 

restricted to a small group of individual experts in order to maintain a high level of expertise. 

Regarding the competition of Friesland Kabel, standardized (structured) interviews with 5 

major marine cable suppliers on the Brazilian market have been carried out. This method sets 

a fixed series of questions. Thus, comparability across the respondents could be guaranteed 

(Mitchell &amp;amp; Jolley, 2012, p. 301). The companies were selected through internet research and 

via personal contacts on the fair trades Brasil Offshore and Navalshore in 2015. The 

interviews have been conducted by telephone, since the willingness to participate and the 

probability to address the right contact person is significantly higher than through online 

surveys. In preparation for the interviews, a questionnaire (see appendix 5) was elaborated 

that include a mix of open-ended and closed-ended (multiple choice design) question types. 

The web-based survey platform SurveyMonkey served as a basis for this (SurveyMonkey, 

2015).

The data analysis pursues a qualitative approach since the overall objective of this study 

focuses on meanings and description of structural processes rather than on quantifiable 

phenomena or the measurement of specific variables (Patton, 2002, pp. 13-14). In order to 

organize and evaluate the acquired data in a systematic way, several frameworks and tools 

from the field of Strategic Management have been applied, including PESTLE; Porter´s 5 

Forces; VRION; SMART; SWOT; and SAVE. Additionally, basic summaries, graphs, 

diagrams, charts and tables summarize and visualize the major outcomes. 

1.4 Project Structure  

The present project is divided into 12 chapters. The introduction (chapter 1) gives an 

insight into the topic, research objective, methodology and provides information about the 

current state of research. Chapter 2 covers the macro business environment of Brazil 

including political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental aspects. Chapter 

3 focuses on the dynamics of the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry by analyzing market 

size, growth rates, market segments and competition. In the fourth chapter the resources and 

capabilities of Friesland Kabel will be identified and evaluated according to their competitive 

potential. 

The second part of the project begins with an introduction in strategy formulation (Chapter 

5) and the definition of Friesland Kabel´s mission, vision and objectives (Chapter 6). 

Afterwards, the overall strategic situation is investigated by applying the SWOT framework 

(Chapter 7). On this basis, strategic responses will be elaborated (Chapter 8.) including 

market entry mode (Chapter 9.) and marketing concept (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 deals with 

the implementation of the strategic choices. To this aim, an action plan is developed which 

lists all necessary activities and sets out a time frame for their implementation.  

The last chapter (Chapter12.) provides a summary of the key results and gives an outlook 

with regard to the initial questions.

1.5 State of Research 

The theoretical framework of this project is based on concepts and theories from 

international strategic management literature. In the context of globalization, this field of 

study is well researched and saw rapid growth during the last three decades (Lu, 2003, p. 

193). A range of strategic management publications divides the internationalization process of 

business organizations into three or four phases including: (1) analysis of the external and 

internal environment; (2) strategy formulation; (3) strategy implementation and (4) strategy 

evaluation (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 11); (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 6) or (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 49). 

For the strategic assessment of macroeconomic environments, research refers to political, 

economic, social, technological, legal and environmental aspects of markets. In particular, an 

emphasis is placed on the questions how these aspects influence the overall market potential 

and determine investment decisions of organizations (Johnson, et al., 2008, pp. 54-55) or 

(Piercy, 2012, p. 396).  



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

Due to the changing role of emerging markets, research interest is increasingly attracted by 

Brazil’s macro business environment. Most of the publications on this topic are country 

profiles from an external market seeking perspective and point out the country´s economic 

stability as well as its different sources of transaction costs (World Bank, 2014c), (CIA, 2014) 

or (BTI, 2014).  

The Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry is also integrated into this research area. 

Articles and reports of the past years show the importance of the sector for the country´s 

economic prosperity and emphasize its growth potential (Enst &amp;amp; Young, 2012) or (BNDES, 

2014). An important source for current industry information is the Brazilian National Agency 

of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP, 2014a) which provides continuously updated 

figures and statistics. 

Data and information about the Brazilian shipbuilding and marine equipment industry is 

limited to only a few sources. Particular mention should be made of the biannual market 

studies performed by the Brazilian Association of Naval Construction and Offshore 

Companies (SINAVAL, 2015). 

Research about internal environments deals with capabilities and resources of 

organizations and provides diagnostic tools in order to identify and evaluate the strengths and 

weaknesses of organizations. Common assessment criteria are therefore the ability to create 

competitive advantage and the relative cost position against competitors (Peng, 2009, p. 78); 

(Barney, 1991, p. 99) or (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 67).  

International strategy formulation is described as a process to determine how organizations 

enter a certain market. A range of literature specifies alternative components of this process, 

including mission and vision statements, the setting of corporate objectives, the entry mode 

selection, marketing strategies and the development of strategic actions (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 

11); (Perlitz, 2004, p. 64) or (Kotler &amp;amp; Keller, 2012, p. 48).  

Literature about missions, visions and objectives particularly highlights their relevance to the 

evaluation of business activities and to the determination of the overall goals of organizations. 

Additionally, several authors define key elements and provide formal criteria in order to 

define such statements (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19); (Baldegger, 2012, pp. 145-147)  or (Doran, et 

al., 1981, pp. 35-36). 

When it comes to the question of how to fulfill a company’s mission, vision and 

objectives, the academic research proposes the elaboration of strategic actions. These are 

usually defined as the allocation of resources and commitment. Basic concepts underlying the 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

implementation of strategic actions generally aim to maximize the competitive advantage of 

organizations by translating external and internal starting conditions into specific strategic 

decisions (Andersen, 2013, pp. 64-66) or (Griffin &amp;amp; Fleet, 2014, p. 157). 

A fundamental question of the market entry mode is the degree of internationalization 

ranging between national diversification and global orientation (Bartlett &amp;amp; Goshal, 1989, p. 

58) or (Buckley &amp;amp; Casson, 1998, pp. 541-543). Based on this dichotomy, different types of 

market entry modes are distinguished. Additionally, several approaches provide criteria for 

the selection between the alternative modes (Root, 1994, p. 41). 

In the academic inquiry of international strategic development, the marketing plan is one of 

the basic elements (Root, 1994, p. 4). Marketing strategies are usually separated into different 

decision areas. The most common framework is the 4P-model (McCarthy, 1960, p. 45). 

However, depending on specific business environments, other approaches are proposed 

(Ettenson, et al., 2013) or (Shimizu, 1989, pp. 63-102).

2 Macro Business Environment of Brazil: PESTLE-Analysis 

Business organizations are embedded into an external environment which is determined by 

the geographical area in which they operate (Johnson, et al., 2008, pp. 54-55). According to 

Kotler, the “macro environment includes forces that create opportunities and pose threat to the 

business units” (Jain, et al., 2011, p. 10). Companies doing business abroad must consider the 

particular conditions of the host country in addition to their domestic environment (Francis, 

2010, p. 57).  

There are several approaches for assessing environmental forces. For the following 

investigation the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and 

environmental) analysis has been selected since it includes all dimensions which are relevant 

to the present project.  

In implementing this framework, only those environmental aspects which have a potential 

impact on Friesland Kabel´s business activities have been considered. The data used 

originates mainly from international reports, rankings and indices since these types of sources 

enable an inter-country comparison.  

2.1 Political Factors 

The Federative Republic of Brazil is a stable growing democracy with a sustainable 

institutional system. After the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff in October 2014 the 

center-left party PT is expected to continuously stay in power for 16 years.  

Brazil has no political enemies, no ethnic or cultural conflicts and faces no threat of 

terrorism. This is a particular advantage compared to other oil and gas producing regions and 

countries such as North Africa, the Gulf region or Russia where political uncertainties have 

considerable impacts on the industry. 

During the last two years, national protests, directed mainly against the poor public 

services, corruption and the management of the PT government, increasingly took place. 

Since recently, Dilma Rousseff no longer has the support of the population, of which more 

than two-thirds are calling for her impeachment (Telles, 2015, pp. 7-14).  

According to the political risk index by the PRS Group, Brazil is ranked on 59th out of 100 

investigated countries (The PRS Group, 2015).  

In the following, the most significant political factors from a business perspective will be 

briefly explained: 

 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

Corruption: Despite the introduction of several new legal measures such as the Anti-

Bribery Law (Presidência da República, 2013), Brazil`s corruption continues to be an obstacle 

for business. Due to the federal structure and special legal standing of legislators, companies 

and businesspeople are increasingly facing corruption by public officials (Business Anti-

Corruption Portal, 2014). According to the corruption perception index by Transparency 

International, Brazil is ranked number 69 out of 175 countries. (International Transperency, 

2014). 

 

 Taxation: The Brazilian tax system is complicated and fragmented, which leads to time-

consuming processes of overcoming administrative burdens and to high uncertainty in fiscal 

matters (Rabobank, 2014). According to the World Bank, the Brazilian tax system is ranked at 

number 175 among 189 countries (World Bank, 2014a). Another study by PwC, World Bank 

and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) concluded that Brazil possesses the most 

time-consuming tax system worldwide (PwC, 2014, p. 21).  

 

Bureaucracy: Start-ups in Brazil face huge bureaucratic challenges. In the category 

“Starting a Business” of the World Bank report, Brazil is ranked at 123 out of 189 economies 

(World Bank, 2014a). During the last years, 40% of Brazilian start-ups did not survive their 

third year on the market (VEJA, 2012). This is mainly due to the legal and regulatory 

complexity in the country, which negatively affects the efficiency of the public administration 

and economic operators. It is estimated that Brazil`s bureaucracy annually generates a total 

cost of R$ 46.3 billion (FIESP, 2015, p. 1).  

2.2 Economic Factors 

Brazil is considered a solid and sustainable economy in the medium term. With a gross 

domestic product (GDP) of $ 2.346 trillion in 2014, the country is currently the seventh 

largest economy in the world and the biggest economic power in Latin America (Bradesco, 

2015, p. 62). 

FDI in Brazil has steadily increased during the last years. This is mainly due to a stronger 

market orientation, by which several public enterprises have been privatized and trade barriers 

have been reduced. In 2014, FDI in Brazil totaled $ 62,5 billion, which corresponds to 2.7% 

of the GDP (Bradesco, 2015, p. 62). According to the Foreign Direct Investment Confidence 

Index, in the same year Brazil was the fifth-most attractive market for FDI (A.T. Kearney, 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

10 

 

2014, p. 1). The biggest investment sectors in the country include agriculture, infrastructure, 

construction and oil and gas (BNDES, 2014, p. 2). 

Nevertheless, Brazil is currently affected by a deep economic recession. The GDP has 

fallen from 2,7 % in 2013 to 0,1% in 2014 and is estimated to decline to –1,8 % in 2015 

(Bradesco, 2015, p. 62). The effects are rapidly increasing unemployment rates, weak 

consumption and decreasing tax receipts. Moreover, rising inflation and currency depreciation 

are increasing the government´s debt (The Economist, 2015). As a result, at the end of august 

2015, President Dilma Rousseff submitted a loss-making budget proposal for the first time in 

the history of Brazil. According to the news agency Agência Brasil, the estimated structural 

primary deficit for the year 2016 corresponds to 0,5% of the GDP (Agência Brasil, 2015).  

In the following the most important economic causes and consequences of this crisis will 

be explained in more detail: 

 

Infrastructure: According to the 2013-2014 Global Competitiveness Report, infrastructure 

in Brazil is the biggest obstacle for business investors (Schwab &amp;amp; Sala-i-Martin, 2013, p. 38). 

This applies to both local transportation, including air traffic, ports, road and railways and 

international trading operations. According to the FGV institute, about 100 forms and 900 

pieces of information are required in order to import a container into Brazil. Another study 

shows that importing a container into Brazil costs about US$ 2215. Compared to other 

emerging countries (e.g. China US$ 500 or Chile US$ 795), this amount is significantly above 

the average (Rabobank, 2014, p. 3). 

 

Labor and Employment: There is a shortage of technical and skilled labor in Brazil. 

According to the “Talent Shortage Global Survey 2015”, Brazil was the fourth worst scoring 

country, having difficulty in filling vacancies in the 42 surveyed labor markets 

(ManpowerGroup, 2015, p. 7). Moreover, the OECD study “Education at a Glance 2013” 

shows a lack of qualified educated people in Brazil. Only 10% of the population has a post-

secondary degree, against 15% in Mexico and 25% in Chile (OECD, 2013, p. 28). 

Further restrictions refer to the rigid labor legislation, which leads to high uncertainty, 

informal employment relationships and increased labor costs compared to other emerging 

countries (Gill, et al., 2002, p. 221). 

 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

11 

 

Inflation: 1 US$ is worth R$ 3,90055 (Oanda, 2015) today (19.09.2015). Since 2014, the 

Real has depreciated around 30% against the Dollar (Borges, 2015). According to the Big 

Mac Index, the Real is the third most overheated currency (Big Mac Index, 2015), a fact 

which has particularly negative impacts for importing countries.  

Due to the low purchasing power of the currency, inflation remains high in the country. 

The average inflation in 2014 amounted to 6.4%. For this reason, the Central Bank of Brazil 

(Banco Central do Brazil) raised the so-called SELIC interest rate to 11,75%. Overall, with 

around 5.35%, Brazil thus had one of the highest real interest rates worldwide (Bradesco, 

2015, p. 2). 

2.3 Social Factors 

The Brazilian society is highly diverse in terms ethnic groups and cultural background. It is 

estimated that currently 202,656,788 people live in Brazil, with an annual growth rate of 

0.8%. The medium age of the population is relatively young at 30.7 years (CIA, 2014). 

Between 2003 and 2014, about 47,7 million Brazilians have risen into the “new middle class” 

which is estimated to encompass around 112 million people (Secretaria de Assuntos 

Estratégicos da Presidência da Presidência da República, 2014, pp. 24-25). 

In parallel to this, poverty fell from 20% in 2004 to 7% in 2009, while extreme poverty 

dropped from 10% to 4%. Income inequality also decreased steadily. From 2001 to 2009, the 

income of the poorest 10% of the population grew by 7% per year, while the income rate of 

richest 10% amounted to 1.7% (BTI, 2014, p. 13). Accordingly, Brazil´s GINI index 

improved from 54.52 in 2008 to 51.9 in 2012, and the Human Development Index (HDI) has 

also risen continually during the last years (Pieterse &amp;amp; Cardoso, 2014, p. 2). 

 The educational system in Brazil is characterized by an overall low level and limited 

access opportunities (Souza, 2011, pp. 8-9). According to the Program for International 

Student Assessment (PISA), Brazil performs below the average in mathematics (rank: 57/64), 

reading (rank: 55/56) and science (rank 58/60) (OECD, 2012). In contrast, the rate of people 

with primary education increased from 34.5% in 1995 to 61.7% in 2009 (Inequality Watch, 

2012). 

Robbery, rape, fraud, and residential thefts remain at critical levels in Brazil. According to 

the 2013 Brazilian Yearbook of Public Security, the national homicides rate amounted to 24.3 

victims against 6.9 of the global average. However, in some main cities and business centers, 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

12 

 

such as Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, the crime situation has improved significantly compared 

to previous years (Getulio Vagas Foundation, 2014, p. 7).  

2.4 Technological Factors  

Science, technology and innovation are key elements for Brazil´s economic development. 

Brazil is a world leader in agribusiness and a pioneer in biodiesel production. Additionally, 

the country plays a major role in the airplane and submarine industry, space research, deep 

water oil &amp;amp; gas exploration, telecommunications and software design. Thus, Brazil possesses 

a comprehensive technological infrastructure consisting of governmental departments, 

research centers and business organizations (OECD, 2011, p. 144). Brazil´s overall innovation 

strategy is based on the action plan “Plano Brasil Maior” (Plano Brasil Maior, 2014) which 

pursues three main objectives: (1) The reduction of foreign technology import, (2) the support 

of Brazil’s know-how in nature-related fields and (3) the development of the national research 

system.  

Nevertheless, Brazil is still highly dependent on foreign innovation and technology. The 

technological transfer is controlled by the patent office Instituto Nacional da Propriedade 

Industrial (INPI), an institution which is authorized to approve all technological cross-border 

agreements (INIPI, 2014). 

Brazil’s research and innovation indicators show significant developments over the last 

years. The country produces 10 times more PhDs (500.000 a year) than two decades ago and 

is among the 15 largest producers of scientific publications in the world (SCImago Journal 

and Country Rank, 2014). The research and development expenditure (% of GDP) of 1.21% 

in 2011 was the highest share among all Latin American countries (World Bank, 2014b) and 

in terms of the information and communication technology (ICT), Brazil achieved the 60
th

 

place out of 148 economies worldwide in the Network Readiness Index (NRI) (Schwab, et al., 

2013, p. 23). 

In recent years the Brazilian Government has initiated several efforts in order to improve 

the conditions of intellectual property (IP) rights. To this end, it has set up different national 

institutions such as the Conselho Nacional de Combate à Pirataria (=National Council for 

Combating Piracy and Intellectual Property). In the International Property Rights Index Brazil 

is ranked at 46 out of 96 countries (Soto, 2014). 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

13 

 

2.5 Legal Factors 

The principal source of Brazilian law is the Civil Code, which was enacted in 2002, 

replacing the 1916 code. Codes that specifically refer to business issues are the labor law, 

company law, consumer rights and contract and property law (Neto, 2013, pp. 3-22). The 

Brazilian legal system is highly complex. Enforcing contracts is time-consuming and 

arbitration is a common procedure for resolving commercial conflicts. For this reason, foreign 

investors should use international laws or engage a local lawyer.  

In 2014 Brazil acceded to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 

Sale of Goods (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 2014). FDI is 

regulated by the law 4131/62. In general, Brazilian law does not prohibit FDI, but in certain 

industry sectors, including communications, media, public utilities and transportation, foreign 

ownership is strongly limited. (Ernst &amp;amp; Young, 2011, pp. 7-8). Every FDI is obligated to be 

registered in the online electronic system of the Central Bank, called Electronic Registration 

of Foreign Direct Investments (RDE-IED), within 30 days (Banco Central do Brasil, 2014, p. 

9).  

According to the New Brazilian Civil Code (NBCC), there are no additional restrictions for 

foreign ownership of real estate property. The Brazilian law knows 9 different types of 

business entities. The most common forms of establishing subsidiaries are a liability company 

(limitada) or cooperation (Sociedade Anônima). There are some obstacles for entrepreneurs to 

incorporating and registering a company in Brazil. As already mentioned before, registration 

procedures require a lot of time and can involve high costs. Further information including all 

required procedures can be viewed in the “Doing Business Report of the World Bank” (World 

Bank, 2014c) . 

The major legislation norm regularizing labor activities in Brazil is the Consolidação das 

Leis do Trablaho. Labor legislation in Brazil is complex and guarantees certain rights and 

benefits to employees, including regulation of working hours, vacations, salary, notice 

periods, transportation and meals (Presidência da República, 1943). This is why labor costs 

are relatively high in comparison with other emerging markets.  

2.6 Environmental Factors 

As the world's fifth largest country, Brazil possesses a high diversity of natural resources. 

The country’s economic and financial status is extremely dependent on these products, which 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

14 

 

contribute to three major industries: (1) raw materials, (2) energy and (3) agriculture 

(Katsioloudes, 2011, p. 362). 

Nevertheless, the country faces different environmental problems including deforestation, 

species distinction, air and water pollution, land degradation and oil spills (CIA, 2014). In 

order to preserve its resources, the Brazilian Government has adopted different policies and 

set up several regulatory organizations. The main monitoring authority in this regard is the 

Brazilian Environment and Natural Resources Institute (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio 

Ambiente - IBAMA), which establishes and controls anti-pollution standards. The Brazilian 

law punishes environmental crimes strictly and contamination of the soil, water or air 

generally leads to civil and criminal prosecution (Presidência da República, 1998) .  

As the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, Brazil increasingly came under 

pressure to assume global responsibility. In this context, the country has ratified several 

international environmental agreements as the Kyoto protocol and hosted the United Nations 

Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20 (Fausto &amp;amp; Fausto, 

2014, pp. 399-400) . 

2.7 Business Implications 

In summary, the Brazilian business environment remains diversified. Based on favorable 

macroeconomic factors including a high occurrence of natural resources, population growth 

and economic potential, Brazil is currently one of the most sought-after investment 

destinations worldwide. Moreover, in aspects such as social equity and political stability, the 

country has shown great improvements during the last years.  

However, Brazil still exhibits significant business constraints. In this context, the term 

“Custo Brasil” stands for the competitiveness problem of operational extra cost making 

Brazilian goods and services more expensive compared to those of other (emerging) countries 

(Parra-Bernal, et al., 2011).  

It is possible to reduce some of these “costs” through good preparation. This is the reason 

why Brazil is not the right market for short-term profit-making. By contrast, long-term 

commitment and seeking economies of scale are key success factors for ensuring high return 

of investment.  

Where the individual influence is low, investors have no other option than to be patient. In 

this context, Julio Ramundo, director of the BNDES observed that:  



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

15 

 

“Sixty years ago, this country was not much more than a glorified coffee plantation but 

we have brought many new businesses through since then. There are very good 

opportunities in Brazil. Just don’t be put off if you have to have more than six meetings. 

We like to date” (Booth, 2013). 

 

For a better overview the table below presents the business opportunities and threats 

analyzed in this chapter. The classification of the PEST model is still maintained. 

Additionally, the factors were evaluated based on their potential business implications for 

Friesland Kabel´s market entry. Generally, environmental factors are assessed on two 

dimensions: First, according to the probability of occurrence and second according to the 

strength of the impact (Piercy, 2012, p. 396). The rating scale categories range from “1” to 

“3”. Challenges assessed as 3 have the most negative impact for Friesland Kabel. Likewise, 

opportunities evaluated as “3” provide great potentials. By contrast, factors rated with “1” 

correspond to small challenges or limited opportunities.

3 Industry Analysis 

After this outline of the macro environmental forces, in a next step the focus will be 

narrowed to the industry. Similar to the macro environment, the dynamics of a given industry 

also determine the scope of business organizations. However, industry forces are more 

concentrated and have a more direct impact on enterprises. Conversely, business 

organizations also have more influence on the industry variables than on macro environmental 

forces (Gimbert, 2011, pp. 46-47). For those reasons, industry analyses are important 

measures for companies when it comes to market entry and strategic decisions.   

 The overall aim of this chapter is to assess the market potential for Friesland Kabel within 

the Brazilian oil and gas industry and its relevant segments. Therefore, the study includes the 

following issues:  

 

? Overview of the development of the Brazilian offshore oil and gas industry: How 

attractive is the Brazilian offshore oil and gas sector in general and on an 

international comparison? 

? Identification of Friesland Kabel´s product segment: Which segments within the supply 

chain correspond to the products and services of the company? 

? Assessment of the competitive environment: What are the key competitive factors that 

most affect the industry? 

3.1 The Brazilian Oil and Gas Industry: Current Scenario and Perspective 

The Brazilian oil and gas sector is experiencing a defining moment of new opportunities 

and challenges. In the past 20 years, oil and natural gas reserves in Brazil have, in total, 

increased by 164% (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. 12). With an expected investment volume of R$ 

509 billion (ca. US$ 130 billion) between 2015 and 2018, the oil and gas industry is one of 

the largest investment sectors of the country (BNDES, 2014, p. 139). At a constant high 

production level over the last year, in December 2014 a new record of 2.497 million barrels 

oil per day (bpd) and 598 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) natural gas was reached (see figure 1) 

(ANP, 2014a, p. 11).

With regard to further unexploited sources, Brazil is expected to become one of the major 

global oil and gas producers. It is estimated that in the next 20 years, Brazil will rise to the 

fourth biggest oil and gas producing country worldwide after the U.S.A., Saudi Arabia and 

Russia (see figure 2) and produce nearly 5% of the world’s oil supply (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. 

20).  

Based on industrial growth and a growing middle class, Brazil is also gaining importance 

as a sales market. It is forecasted that with an increase of 29% in demand, the oil and gas 

consumption in the country will account for approximately 4% of the global demand in 2020 

(Enst &amp;amp; Young, 2012, p. 21).

Despite this positive outlook, the Brazilian oil and gas sector is currently facing a number 

of challenges. Apart from the global drop of the oil prices, key players on the market, such as 

the biggest national oil producer Petrobras, are involved in different corruption affairs. Over 

several years, managers of the company have taken bribes amounting to billions. The result of 

this is that thousands of contracts with suppliers and construction companies must be 

reconsidered and renegotiated. In this scenario, many supplier companies have already closed 

down and about 20.000 employees of the industry have been dismissed. According to the 

estimations of the Federal Police, the costs of Petrobras which are directly related to the 

corruption incidents amount to about R$ 19 billion (ca. US$ 5 billion) (Globo, 2015). Against 

this background, the company has reduced its investment plan for the next 4 years by 37 % 

(Petrobras, 2015, p. 8).  

3.2 National Actors 

3.2.1 ANP  

The Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) is the 

central regulatory organ that monitors oil, natural gas and biofuel activities in Brazil. Linked 

to the Ministry of Mines, the ANP sets national policies and announces bidding rounds for oil 

and gas resources (ANP, 2014b).  

3.2.2 Petrobras &amp;amp; Transpetro 

Petrobras is a publicly traded company whose major stakeholder is the Government of 

Brazil. As an integrated energy company, Petrobras operates in different sectors including 

exploration and production, refining, marketing, transportation, petrochemicals, oil product 

distribution, natural gas, electricity, chemical gas, and biofuels (Petrobras, 2014a, p. 1). With 

its share of 79% of the total national investment in the sector, Petrobras is by far the biggest 

oil and gas company in Brazil (Camerini, 2014, p. 6). Transpetro, a subsidiary of Petrobras 

specializes in transportation and logistics activities (Transpetro, 2014). 

3.2.3 Private Producer 

Apart from Petrobras, the remaining market share is distributed between a few private 

companies and multinationals. The table below shows the biggest 5 producer according to 

their production volume.

Shell Brasil 47.690 

Parnaíba Gás 37.954 

Chevron Frade 17.279 

 

3.2.4 Private Industry Organizations 

Private organizations which represent companies of the Brazilian oil gas industry include 

the National Organization of the Oil Industry (ONIP) and the Brazilian Institute for Oil, Gas 

and Biofuels (IBP). ONIP is a non-profit organization which serves as a communication and 

cooperation forum between companies, suppliers and government agencies involved in the 

Brazilian oil and gas sector (ONIP, 2014).  

IBP is a private association with 200 member companies. The main objective of IBP is to 

support the sustainability, competitiveness and the social responsibility of the national oil, gas 

and biofuels industry. (IBP, 2014).  

3.3 The Offshore Oil and Gas Sector: Pre-Salt 

3.3.1 Geographical Overview 

The total Brazilian offshore oil and gas reserves consist of ca. 7% of Shallow Water (0-

300m); 48% of Deep Water (300 – 1500 m) and 45% of Ultra Deep Water fields (&gt; 1500m) 

(Pinho, 2014, p. 4). “Pre-Salt” fields are oil and gas deposits that lie below under thick layers 

of salt, in areas of approximately 7.000 meter below the sea.  

The largest part of the pre-salt reserves is located ca. 300 km off the Brazilian South 

Eastern coast and extends across 5 federal states, from Espírito Santo over Rio de Janeiro and 

São Paulo to Paraná and Santa Catarina. The total pre-salt area discovered to date is estimated 

at 149,000 square kilometers (Petrobras, 2014e). Figure 3 provides an overview of the 

geographical location of the fields. In addition, a more detailed map is provided in appendix 6.

Figure 3: Oil and Gas Production in Brazil (Adapted from Enst &amp;amp; Young, 2012) 

 

3.3.2 Market Size and Growth 

The dynamic growth of the Brazilian oil and gas industry is mainly based on the discovery 

of offshore deep-water pre-salt fields. Research by Petrobras has shown that more than half of 

the global oil and gas sources discovered between 2005 and 2010 are located in the deep sea. 

Out of these, 62% belong to Brazil (AHK; GTAI, 2013, p. 15). Additionally, the ANP 

estimates that of the approximately 14.7 billion barrel of officially proven oil reserves at the 

end of 2013, 94% are from offshore sources. (ANP, 2013). It is supposed that the already 

discovered sources represent only a small percentage of the actual volume. The overall 

quantity of the seep-sea sources is estimated at 50-70 billion barrels. Between January 2013 

and February 2014, 38 new offshore sources were discovered, 14 of them in the pre-salt. 

Currently, 100% of all drillings lead to new findings. The table below provides an overview

of basins with their respective volumes and number of production facilities (ANP, 2014a, p. 

23).  

Table 4: Distribution of the Oil &amp;amp; Gas Production by Basin (ANP,2014) 

 

3.3.3 Business Opportunities 

Against the background of the deep-water oil and gas exploration there is a high demand 

for innovation and technology in this sector. Local content regulations set by the government 

are supposed to meet the most of the requirements by domestic resources. However, due to 

technological gaps and limited local expertise, the production volume cannot be achieved 

without foreign contribution. 

For this reason, manufacturers of products and providers of services which cannot be 

covered by local content will be specifically sought abroad in order to establish joint ventures 

with domestic companies. One of these projects already started in 2014 under the 

coordination of ONIP and the trade and investment promotion agency Apex Brasil (AHK; 

GTAI, 2014, pp. 13-14). In the first phase of these projects, potential Brazilian companies for 

strategic partnerships will be selected. Then, in the next two years at least 7 international road

appropriate foreign partner. (Appex Brasil, 2014a). 

3.4 Target Segment Definition  

The offshore oil and gas sector is a very complex and fragmented industry that includes a 

number of different processes. Thus, the objective of this section is to identify those industry 

segments that will present the most opportunities for Friesland Kabel in terms of market 

potential and product suitability. This enables a more focused assessment of the relevant 

segments in the further analysis.  

Therefore, first a brief overview of the main segments of the offshore oil and gas supply 

chain and the products of Friesland Kabel will be presented. On this basis, it will then be 

determined which segments and products fit together. After that, the related sub-segments will 

be analyzed according to market size and growth. 

3.4.1 The Offshore Oil and Gas Supply Chain 

The offshore oil and gas supply-chain can basically be divided into three distinct segments: 

Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream. The upstream sector includes processes related to the 

exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) of oil and gas. Midstream processes refer to the processing 

and the transportation of the oil and gas to the refineries through tankers or pipelines. The 

downstream industry covers the refining and the distribution of the products to the final 

consumer (Harrison &amp;amp; Hoek, 2008).

3.4.2 Product Definition 

Friesland Kabel is a distributor of wires, cables and network technology. The product 

range covers five main categories: (1) marine cables; (2) industrial cables; (3) cable and 

wires; (4) wind cables and (5) data systems technology. Among these, the marine cables and 

network technology specialized for offshore communication are the products that are most 

suitable for the offshore oil and gas industry. This equipment can be mainly used in the 

upstream and midstream sector for offshore constructions including platforms, rigs and 

vessels.  

3.4.3 Production and Development 

With regard to future investments, the E&amp;amp;P sector is by far the biggest and fastest growing 

segment. According to the new Business and Management Plan of Petrobras, until 2019 83% 

(US$ 108,6 billion) of the company´s total investment is supposed to flow into E&amp;amp;P activities 

(Petrobras, 2015, p. 8). This focus on E&amp;amp;P is mainly due to the production expansion of the 

pre-salt sources.  

Figure 5: Investement from Petrbras 2015-2019 (Petrobras, 2015) 

 

 

 

The bulk of the total expenditures for E&amp;amp;P will be invested in the construction of plants 

and platforms. Most of these activities are outsourced and performed by specialized industrial 

service providers and EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) companies (AHK; 

GTAI, 2014, p. 20).

3.4.4 Shipbuilding and Marine Equipment  

Due to the fact that the shipbuilding sector depends to a large extent on orders from the oil 

and gas industry, the Brazilian shipyards, for the first time in 15 years, are undergoing a major 

crisis. In the first half of 2015 around 14.000 employees were dismissed and the construction 

orders in the shipyards dropped from 381 in 2014 to 279 ongoing projects (SINAVAL, 2015, 

p. 2). At this point, the exact impact on the industry is difficult to predict. For that reason, 

both the past and estimated future orders for offshore vessels including tankers (1.6.1); oil 

production platforms (1.62); offshore support vessels (1.6.3) and drilling rigs (1.6.4) will be 

briefly presented in the following. 

3.4.5 Tankers 

In 2014 Brazil had the third largest portfolio of orders for oil tankers in the world 

(Transpetro, 2014, p. 1). Tanker vessels are crucial for the transportation of oil from platforms 

to terminals on land and of oil products along the Brazilian coast. Within the framework of 

the growth programs PROMEF and EBN, Brazil had planned to increase its tanker fleet by 88 

new vehicles until 2020, including 14 Suezmax, 8 Aframax, 4 Panamax, 38 Products, 8 gas 

tankers und 9 bunkers (AHK, 2014b, p. 20). 

Due to the decline in orders there are currently only 29 tankers under construction 

(SINAVAL, 2015, p. 4). The table below gives an overview of the recently confirmed 

projects.

3.4.6 Oil Production Platforms 

Offshore production platforms of different types such as FSPO´s (floating production, 

storage and off-loading) or SS´s (semi-submersible) generally support production and storage 

operations (Chakrabarti, 2005, p. 1065). In 2011, with 115 out of 194 FSPO projects, Brazil 

was at the top of the of all producing countries worldwide (Jacoby, 2012, p. 21) 

 

Figure 6: FSPO Projects by Country/Region (International Maritime Associates, Inc. ,2012) 

 

 

The former expansion plan provided the construction of 12 out of 27 platforms and 

production units on the domestic market (AHK, 2014b, p. 28). According to table 6 currently 

seven hulls are under construction and 10 production modules are ordered. Five further 

platforms are planned to be built in Asian yards (SINAVAL, 2015, p. 6).

3.4.7 Drilling Rigs 

In 2014 Sete Brasil Participações SA (Sete Brasil) intended to produce 29 offshore drill 

rigs for Petrobras, which were supposed to be manufactured completely in the domestic 

market and under strict local content requirements (2b1 Consulting, 2014). This number was 

recently reduced to 19 units. To acquire additional financial resources, Sete Brasil established 

partnerships with Kawasaki (Japan) KeppelFels (Singapore), SembMarine Corp (Singapore), 

the China Offshore Oil Engineering Corporation (COOEC) and the subsidiary Odebrecht Oil 

and Gas (see table 7) (SINAVAL, 2015, p. 7).

3.4.8 Offshore Support Vessels 

The reduction of orders for oil platforms and drilling rigs has a direct impact on the 

construction of support vessels. Last year the orders of supply boats until 2020 amounted to 

198 additional vessels (AHK, 2014b, p. 23). According to recent information, currently only 

32 offshore support vessels (OSVs) are under construction. Moreover, it is expected that in 

the context of Petrobras’ new investment plan, already tendered projects will be renegotiated 

and postponed. The company´s objective is to reduce the present support vessel fleet by 

around 90 ships (SINAVAL, 2015, p. 5).

3.4.9 National Shipyards: Locations 

The state of Rio de Janeiro with its 18 shipyards constitutes the center of the Brazilian 

shipbuilding industry. An overview of the main national shipbuilding locations and their 

production capacity can be gained from the table below.   

 

Table 9: Main Brazilian Shipyards (Sinaval, 2014) 

 

3.4.10 Marine Cables &amp;amp; Network Technology 

Information about the demand for Friesland Kabels´s specific products can be derived from 

the procurement lists for marine equipment (appendix 1-4) originally released by SINAVAL  

(AHK; GTAI, 2014, pp. 44-50) and lists of Petrobras’s supplying goods (Petrobras, 2014d). 

In both types of documents, marine cables and individual parts of network technology can be 

found. Nevertheless, it has to be taken into consideration that these documents were published 

before the crisis affected the shipbuilding sector and that at this time, no updated lists are 

available. Thus, it must be assumed that, in line with the shipbuilding industry, the demand 

for this kind of product has also declined.

3.5 Competitive Environment: Porter´s 5 Forces Analysis 

Identifying the competitive environment of a given industry is crucial for companies in 

order to assess the long-term profitability of markets. An extensive strategic management 

framework for this purpose is the Porter´s 5 Forces model. This framework focuses on five 

forces that shape the overall competitive environment of an industry: (1) threat of new 

entrants; (2) bargaining power of buyers; (3) threat of substitute products or services; (4) 

bargaining power of suppliers and (5) rivalry among existing competitors. The stronger each 

of the forces is, the less profitable is the industry, the weaker these forces, the more attractive 

it is. The application of this model helps companies to recognize threats and opportunities and 

to develop appropriate strategic responses (Porter, 2008a, pp. 36-46). 

Based on the Porter´s 5 Forces framework, the following analysis investigates how the 

competitive environment of the Brazilian oil and gas industry influences the profitability of 

Friesland Kabel in the market. In this connection, it must be noted that, depending on the 

force and the sub-factors affecting the company, the analysis covers different levels of the 

industry, ranging from the entire sector to the specific product segment of Friesland Kabel. 

Furthermore, only such factors will be considered which constitute particularities of the 

Brazilian oil and gas market or have a potential impact on the Friesland Kabel´s business 

activities.  

3.5.1 Threat of New Entrants 

The threat of entry depends on the presence and height of entry barriers (Porter, 2008a, p. 

3). Entry barriers are an advantage to firms that already operate in a given market. For a new 

entrant such as Friesland Kabel, entry barriers represent a challenge.  

The major obstacle within the Brazilian oil and gas industry are local content policies. As 

mentioned above, the Brazilian Government puts great emphasis on the preservation of 

national contribution within the oil and gas industry. The objective of this prospective policy 

is to integrate national suppliers and to promote domestic know-how. In order to obtain 

operation rights in the oil and gas supply chain, companies are required to pass several 

bidding rounds on the basis of cash bonus, work program and local content (Tordo, et al., 

2011, p. 89). In these rounds, the ANP sets the minimum acceptable share of local content and 

monitors the compliance. Additionally, the agency has established a certification system in 

which accredited certifiers determine the local content required for particular goods or 

services. Depend on the product and segment, local content requirements vary significantly. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

31 

 

For instance, E&amp;amp;P in the pre-salt area are subjected to particularly strict regulations (85 to 95 

% by 2020). This also includes ships, offshore units and marine equipment.  

As a consequence, national oil and gas companies have adopted local content policies in 

their operating strategies. For instance, suppliers who want to provide services and products to 

Petrobras are, among other criteria that have to be fulfilled, also assessed according to their 

local content (Barroso &amp;amp; Macedo, 2010, p. 65). 

3.5.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers  

Powerful buyers are able to bargain prices, demand better quality and services and possess 

negotiation leverages relative to other actors of the industry (Porter, 2008a, p. 7).  

As it is common in the oil and gas sector, in Brazil there is also one single dominating 

actor on the market (monopsony). Petrobras concentrates 79% of the total investments 

(Camerini, 2014, p. 6). This privileged position allows the company to control competition, 

select its vendors and set contractual conditions (Beato &amp;amp; Benavides, 2004, p. 97).  

For Friesland Kabel, it is difficult to compensate this market power. The product type of 

the firm does not leave much room for differentiation, which means that Petrobras faces few 

switching costs between other suppliers. Nevertheless, the products present some favorable 

properties (more detailed information in chapter 4). In this connection, it has to be considered 

that the oil and gas industry is highly service-intensive. Due to the potential costs of 

breakdowns, service is more relevant than financial investments (Reynolds &amp;amp; Lancaste, 2002, 

p. 202).  

3.5.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers 

Powerful suppliers affect the industry by charging higher prices, limiting production and 

services, or shifting costs to industry participants (Porter, 2008a, p. 6).  

Friesland Kabel is a cable distributor which obtains the completed products from one 

single producer. This is why the company, even on other markets such as Brazil, does not 

require additional suppliers. 

3.5.4 Threat of Substitutes 

The availability of substitute products or services limits the profitability of an industry 

(Porter, 2008a, p. 8).  

For marine cables and offshore network technology, only a few substitutes could be 

identified which are relatively similar in terms of type, quality and price. The marine cables 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

32 

 

can be distinguished by the materials used. Especially with regard to additional safety 

requirements for offshore oil and gas operations, there are different technical solutions. 

3.5.5 Competitive Rivalry 

Rivalry between companies can limit industry profitability depending on the intensity and 

the form of competition (Porter, 2008a, p. 9). 

Due to the fact that specific information about rivalry in the related industry could not 

derived from secondary data, structured interviews have been conducted with the following 

marine cable producers and suppliers operating on the Brazilian market: Cross Fox, Dova 

Supply, Nexans, Prysmian Group and Telefio Cabos. The detailed questions and answers can 

be found in appendix 5. 

The results of the interviews show that the overall market rivalry can be considered as 

moderate to highly competitive. On the one hand, only a few producers and suppliers could be 

identified. The major companies include Cofibam (Brazil), Eurocabos (Brazil), FNCE 

(Brazil), General Cable (Brazil) Nexans (France), Pan Electric (Brazil), Prysmian Group 

(Italy) and Wirex (Brazil). On the other hand, however, the market decline within the 

shipbuilding industry and the monopoly of Petrobras significantly intensify the market 

competition. 

The sources of rivalry are mainly technology and price. Especially for activities in deep-

water areas, technology that is advanced in terms of safety properties and physical resilience 

is of great importance. (Okun, et al., 2003, pp. 3-13). The individual companies offer different 

technical solutions. In this connection Friesland Kabel distinguishes itself by providing state-

of-the-art technology in combination with a comprehensive service performance (see chapter 

4). 

Concerning the price competition, it has to be considered that Friesland Kabel has a price 

disadvantage compared to suppliers of locally manufactured products, since companies 

pursuing an import based strategy are affected by additional import and transportation costs. 

Furthermore, it has been shown that local content requirements additionally increase the 

rivalry among foreign suppliers.  

3.5.6 Five Forces Summary 

The analysis has shown that the competitive environment of the related industry is shaped by 

only a few forces. Among them, the suppliers’ power and the threat of substitutes have the 

least potential effects on Friesland Kabel´s business activities and even provide favorable 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

33 

 

starting conditions. However, other aspects, in particular the predominance of Petrobras and 

local content policies have a great impact on Friesland Kabel´s expansion plans and require 

well-considered strategic responses. In order to provide a concise overview, the most 

important forces are presented and evaluated in table 10.

4 Internal Analysis: Resources and Capabilities 

The internal analysis is the third part within the strategic planning process. In contrast to 

the previous external analysis, this chapter has an internal focus on the strengths and 

weaknesses of Friesland Kabel. Only both perspectives seen together, external and internal 

provide a full overview, which is necessary for selecting an appropriate strategy and business 

model for the company (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 82). 

The investigation starts with a brief presentation of Friesland Kabel and the determination 

of the company´s tangible and intangible resources. In a second step, the competitive potential 

of the identified resources and capabilities will be assessed with the aid of the VRIO 

framework. 

4.1 Company Profile 

Founded in 2007, Friesland Kabel is a medium-size enterprise which currently employs 

worldwide 30 people. Headquartered near Hamburg (Germany), the company operates 

worldwide in on- and offshore projects and maintains subsidiary offices in Romania, Croatia, 

Czech Republic, Argentina and Brazil. Friesland Kabel is the exclusive distributor of the 

finish cable producer Helkama in almost all European countries, Russia and South America. 

The product portfolio includes marine- and industrial cables complying with the highest 

quality and safety requirements (Friesalnd Kabel, 2014).  

Friesland Kabel possesses a variety of different capabilities. Based on the company’s web 

presence the main tangible and intangible resources have been determined and complemented 

by the CEO of Friesland Kabel, Klaus Moorlampen. The results are outlined in the table 

below.

4.2 VRIO-Analysis 

4.2.1 Methodology  

In competitive markets, the profitability and competitive position of firms is strongly 

dependent on resources and capabilities (Ahlstrom &amp;amp; Bruton, 2010, p. 101). Resources are the 

tangible and intangible assets of organizations. Resources allow companies to develop 

capabilities which in turn are the basis for competitive advantage (Hitt, et al., 2009, p. 76). 

According to Barney, 

 “a firm is said to have a (sustainable) competitive advantage when it is implementing a 

value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential 

competitors (and when these other firms are unable to duplicate the benefits of this 

strategy)” (Barney, 1991, p. 102). 

 

In view of the strong competition Friesland Kabel faces in the Brazilian oil and gas sector, 

it is crucial to offer products and services that distinguish themselves from those of its 

competitors. 

An appropriate method for assessing whether resources of organizations provide them with 

sustainable competitive advantage is provided by the VRIO model. The acronym VRIO 

stands for four characteristics which determine the competitive potential of resources (Barney, 

1991, pp. 105 - 106): 

 

1. Value:  Does the resource enable the company to exploit environmental opportunities, 

and/or neutralize threats? 

2. Rarity:  Is the resource exclusively possessed by only a small number of 

organizations?  

3. Imitability:  Is the resource imperfectly imitable in order to avoid that other firms 

cannot obtain them? 

4. Organization:  Does the firm’s organization enable the exploitation of its valuable, 

rare and imperfectly imitable resources? 

 

According to the VRIO approach, resources can only lead to sustainable competitive 

advantage if you can answer all these questions with yes. The table below shows the 

competitive and economic implications, depending on which of the four criteria apply 

(Barney &amp;amp; Hesterly, 2010, pp. 68-86).

4.2.2 Application and Results 

In order to determine which of Friesland Kabel´s capabilities actual sources of sustainable 

competitive advantage are, a series of qualitative interviews with internal executives and key 

employees of the company has been conducted. The interviews were individual and carried 

out via telephone. The sample consists of three respondents who were selected because of 

their strategic knowledge: the CEO, the sales manager in Germany and the head of sales in 

Latin America. Based on the VRIO framework the interview included two main questions: 

 

1. Which are the main sources of Friesland Kabel`s competitive advantage and meet all 

the following criteria?  

a) Valuable to the company´s goals. 

b) Rare in comparison to competitors. 

c) Difficult to imitate for competitors. 

d) Exploitable by the company. 

 

2. In which areas is Friesland Kabel not competitive and shows few or none of the 

criteria above?  

 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

38 

 

For both questions, the experts were asked during the interview to determine a maximum 

of five resources and to justify their responses. This was intended to ensure that only the real 

core capabilities and disadvantages would be chosen.  

Generally, the interview participants replied to the questions very similarly. All three 

experts specified the material properties of the marine cables as the key source of Friesland 

Kabel´s competitive advantage. In this connection, especially the security features and the 

light weight of the cables have been emphasized as unique properties compared to 

competitors. Moreover, the company´s customer services including the overall logistical 

concept, fast production times and the capability to adapt the products to the customer´s needs 

were also named among all respondents. Additionally, two of them mentioned the experience 

and reputation which Friesland Kabel has acquired in several international offshore projects.  

The disadvantages included mainly the limited financial resources and the lack of price 

competitiveness against local suppliers. Moreover, it can be added that Friesland Kabel does 

not have long-standing knowledge about the Brazilian market. 

The relevant aspects are presented once more in table 13.

5 Strategy Formulation  

So far it has been analyzed which external and internal factors determine the scope of 

Friesland Kabel. On the basis of this analysis, the next major step is to select an appropriate 

set of strategic instruments through which the company is able to create and sustain 

competitive advantage.  

An appropriate strategy should therefore build on Friesland Kabel’s capabilities and 

compensate its weaknesses in order to take advantages of environmental opportunities and 

overcome external barriers (Hill &amp;amp; Jones, 2012, p. 7). Additionally, Porter considers the 

uniqueness of value proposition as the key success factor of a company´s strategy (Porter, 

1996, pp. 62-64).  

According to Mintzberg, strategy is “a pattern in a stream of decisions” (Mintzberg, 1978, 

p. 935). Core elements of strategic decisions include objectives, power, relationships, 

performance, resources and competencies (Gupta, 2013, p. 86). Two levels of strategies can 

be distinguished: (1) The corporate strategy and (2) the business strategy. On a business level, 

companies compete in a specific business area. In the case of this project, the business scope 

is determined by a specific industry and geographical area: the Brazilian oil and gas industry. 

 A further distinction is to be made between global and national operations. Due to 

differentiated resource bases and more complex environments, MNEs in an international 

environment face a wider range of strategic choices compared to domestic companies. For 

that reason global strategy formulation is generally more complicated and time-consuming 

(Tallman, 2009, p. 12).  

The literature provides several approaches to separating the individual components of 

market entry processes (Macharzina &amp;amp; Wolf, 2005, p. 946) or (Perlitz, 2004, p. 64). Adapted 

from Hill, Jones &amp;amp; Schilling, the strategy formulation of this project includes the following 

phases (Hill, et al., 2013, p. 11):  

 

1. Mission, vision &amp;amp; objectives  

2. Strategic position 

3. Strategic actions 

4. Entry mode 

5. Marketing plan 

6. Action plan 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

40 

 

It is important to note that the strategic framework developed here cannot be seen as the 

final solution. Strategic plans frequently have to be adapted in view of appearing or changing 

opportunities and risks. In this connection, Mintzberg coined the term “emergent strategy” 

which refers to strategic measures that were not intended from the beginning of the planning 

process or that were not realized due to unrealistic expectations, misjudgments, or inadequate 

implementation approaches (Mintzberg, 1978, p. 945).

6 Mission, Vision &amp;amp; Objectives  

Based on the assumption that the purpose of strategies is to ensure the achievement of 

corporate goals, the question arises which objectives Friesland Kabel actually pursues. In 

order to explicitly express corporate goals, statements of mission, vision and objectives are 

useful management tools. The correlation between these elements can be described as 

follows: A strategic plan determines the use of resources and objectives to accomplish the 

company´s mission that in turn will lead to the achievement of the vision (Wallace, 2009, p. 

29).  

6.1 Mission Statement 

The Mission is the overall purpose of a company and the reason for its existence (Ahlstrom 

&amp;amp; Bruton, 2010, p. 106). In the literature, the mission statement is often set as the first 

component of the strategic management process, since it constitutes a guiding framework that 

serves as an orientation for all business activities. Further functions of mission statements 

include legitimation, information, motivation, and public relations (Baldegger, 2012, p. 145).  

There are no common rules regarding the content and elements of mission statements. 

Generally, mission statements are structured in three parts: First, an introduction describes the 

purpose of the statement. The second part covers the company’s activities, including its 

products and markets. The third part defines the relationship with internal and external 

stakeholders. (Baldegger, 2012, p. 146).  

Mission statements are effective if they present certain characteristics such as: relevant, 

clear, realistic and achievable, flexible, current, enduring and inspiring (Evans, et al., 2011, p. 

16) or (Olsen, et al., 2004, p. 13). 

Missions can not only be helpful for the entire company, but also for specific business 

units. Especially for international business operations it is important to adapt the overall goals 

of the company to a host country level (Ahlstrom &amp;amp; Bruton, 2010, p. 106). In this connection, 

three fundamental dimensions can be distinguished: (1) customer groups (whom to satisfy?); 

(2) customer needs (what to satisfy?) and (3) key capabilities (how to satisfy?) (Hill &amp;amp; Jones, 

2012, p. 15).  

 

Customer groups: Friesland Kabel´s potential operations in Brazil are concentrated on 

Business-to-Business (B2B) markets in which the supply and the demand side exclusively 

consists of organizations (Wright, 2004, p. 3). The target organizations of Friesland Kabel can 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

42 

 

be further distinguished into two groups. The firs group is composed of the main oil and gas 

producers already presented in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. These companies constitute the final customer. 

The second group consists of some major suppliers of oil and gas production, including 

private shipyards, shipbuilding or platform manufacturers and marine engineering companies. 

 

Customer needs: Both types of customers need high complexity services and equipment. 

Which supplier requirements are actually demanded can be derived from Petrobras’ 

qualification and register process regulations. According to these, suppliers must meet 

technical, economical, legal and classificatory criteria. 

Technical requirements refer to the capacity of the company and the products of the firm. 

The economic stability is also important with regard to ensuring a reliable and continuous 

supply of products. Legal aspects include regulatory registration and a local representation in 

Brazil. Classificatory requirements cover health, safety, environmental and managerial 

standards (Petrobras, 2014b). 

 

Key Capabilities: The key capabilities of Friesland Kabel have already been determined in 

chapter 4. Due to the highly competitive environment of the industry (see chapter 3.5) 

competitive competences are of particular importance.  

 

Based on these principles, a preliminary business mission statement for Friesland Kabel´s 

expansion to the Brazilian oil and gas market has been drafted: 

 

 

 

 

 

6.2 Vision Statement 

Like a mission statement, visions are fundamental for the strategic development of 

organizations or individual business units. However, visions are broader. They constitute the 

context in which missions are embedded and formulated. Visions are also more future- 

oriented and enduring, while missions are subjected to changing environmental conditions.  

Friesland Kabel provides the major producers and suppliers in the Brazilian oil and gas 

industry with reliable and on time supply of safe, high quality and state of art products. By 

constantly adapting these capabilities to changing requirements we are striving to add value 

to our customers operations. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

43 

 

A vision can be defined as “a picture of what the firm wants to be and, in broad terms, 

what it wants to ultimately achieve” (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19). Thus, the vision sets the 

direction of the company or the intended corporate development. Three different functions of 

vison statements can be distinguished (Hungenberg, 2012, p. 26):  

 

? Identity: The vision should give the enterprise a unique and distinctive identity. 

? Identification: The vision should demonstrate to the members of an enterprise a deeper 

meaning and use of their work and thereby facilitate their identification with the 

organization. 

? Mobilization: The vision should encourage the members of the enterprise to achieve 

the intended goals.  

 

 Moreover, vision statements must meet certain criteria including: concisely and clear, 

simple and short, unique and distinctive, suitable to the company, show the social and moral 

responsibility of the company and be credible for the stakeholders (Siller &amp;amp; Grausam, 2013, p. 

204) and (Hitt, et al., 2007, p. 19). 

The development of a vision is a creative and intuitive process. According to Collins and 

Porras, vision statements consist of two major components: Core ideology and envisioned 

future. The core ideology describes what a company stands for and why it exists. This aspect 

includes the core values and the core purpose of a firm. The term “envisioned future” refers to 

the goals of the company in a 10 to 30 years’ time horizon and the description of what it will 

be like to achieve these goal. (Collins &amp;amp; Porras, 1996, pp. 65-67). By means of this approach, 

a provisional vision statement for Friesland Kabel has been elaborated: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Through innovation, high quality and reliability the purpose of Friesland Kabel is to help 

oil and gas producers work more efficiently and to take part in the Brazilian offshore oil 

and gas exploration. Therefore, in the next 10 years Friesland Kabel will strive to become 

the premier contracted and most recognized supplier for marine cables, wires and network 

technology in the Brazilian oil and gas industry.  



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

6.3 Objectives 

Objectives are short term to long term goals that an organization pursues in order to 

accomplish its corporate or business unit mission. The main purpose of setting objectives is 

translating an organization’s mission and vision into precise and detailed performance targets. 

Further functions include legitimacy, orientation, evaluation, coordination and motivation 

(Rao, et al., 2008, p. 88). 

A framework that helps in order to express strategic objectives is the SMART model, 

which describes the five most relevant criteria of corporate objectives: Specific, measurable, 

attainable, relevant, and time-relevant (Doran, et al., 1981, pp. 35-36). The table below 

explains the individual elements more precisely: 

 

Table 14: SMART MODEL (Doran, Miller, &amp;amp; Cunningham, 1981) 

S The objective should specifically define what is to be achieved and what requirements 

are necessary for this. 

M An objective should be measurable through quantified or qualified indicators in order 

to evaluate its achievement. 

A The company´s objective should be attainable through its capabilities and resources. 

R The objective should be relevant to the key result areas and the overall success of the 

company. 

T Effective objectives should be set in a time-frame including a deadline until when the 

goals have to be achieved. 

 

For Friesland Kabel´s market entry in the Brazilian oil and gas industry the key result areas 

of business activity, in which the firm will have to excel in order to beat competition and 

fulfill customer requirements, have been determined (Harvard Business Review, 2009, p. 37). 

Then, based on the SMART criteria, these areas have been converted into the following 

objectives: 

 

? Market standing: To steadily gain market share and volume until becoming the market 

leader for marine cable after 10 years of market presence. 

? Customer relationship: To become a main supplier for marine cables of Petrobras. 

Create incentives which increase the costs for Petrobras to switch to other supplier. 

? Product innovation: To adapt the products steadily according to the customers’ needs 

and requirements. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

? Customer service: Offering an overall exclusive service that meets all of the 

customer´s requirements including logistical support and pre-sale service. 

? Distribution and marketing: Intensifying and extending distribution. Creating new 

marketing channels and brand recognition.

7 Strategic Position: SWOT Analysis 

One core element of strategic development is the assessment of an organization’s strategic 

position. An established framework for this purpose is the SWOT analysis. Consistent with 

Friesland Kabel´s mission, the SWOT framework helps to analyze whether the current 

situation of the company is appropriate in order to react to environmental influences. Thus, 

the overall aim of this approach is to provide a basis for deriving strategies that exploit an 

organization´s opportunities and strengths, while neutralizing threats it faces and avoiding its 

weaknesses (Griffin &amp;amp; Fleet, 2014, p. 157). 

For the present SWOT analysis, the three to five most relevant external and internal factors 

from chapter 2, 3 and 4, have been determined with regard to potential business impacts. The 

results are presented in the matrix below:

8 Strategic Actions  

In a next step the previously determined SWOT-elements will be translated into practical 

strategic actions. In some cases it is necessary to develop new ways in order to accomplish 

positive outcomes, while in others, it is possible to complement individual SWOT elements in 

order to create mutual gain. With regard to the second option, three cases are possible 

(Andersen, 2013, pp. 64-66): 

 

? Using strengths to leverage opportunities 

? Take advantage of opportunities in order to overcome weaknesses 

? Using strengths to avoid or reduce threats 

8.1 Corporate Compliance 

Corporate Compliance “relies primarily on controlling employees’ behaviors and decisions 

through a strict set of rules and laws” (Cremer &amp;amp; Lemmich, 2015). As mentioned before, 

recent corruption scandals have had significant impacts on the Brazilian oil and gas industry. 

In this context, it is important to understand that the companies involved are the victims of 

this situation. Especially for German companies, which have a good reputation in terms of 

compliance, this offers new opportunities. For that reason, Friesland Kabel should implement 

anticorruption programs and ethical guidelines in its corporate strategy in order to signal to its 

customers that the company is a fair and reliable business partner.  

8.2 Value Based Marketing  

Concerning product prices, Friesland Kabel cannot compete with local Brazilian producers. 

Thus, Friesland Kabel has to pursue a marketing strategy which emphasizes the company´s 

capabilities such as product quality, customer service, innovation and industry experience 

(Ferrell &amp;amp; Hartline, 2011). A more detailed marketing plan is described in chapter 10. 

8.3 Staged Market Expansion 

Internalization in new unknown markets is often a sequential process whereby companies 

gradually acquire market knowledge and capabilities. Especially for small and medium sized 

enterprises (SMEs) with limited financial resources, a staged market expansion represents a 

good approach (Johnson, et al., 2008, p. 311). This also applies to Friesland Kabel. The 

company must initially consider entry modes that allow the firm to accumulate knowledge 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

48 

 

while minimizing the risks. Once Friesland Kabel has acquired sufficient cash flow and 

market experience, the company can then gradually increase its commitment. 

8.4 Strategic Partnerships 

Local content requirements are the most impactful business restrictions for Friesland 

Kabel. Moderate technological complexity and differentiation of Friesland Kabel´s product 

segment offer companies such as Petrobras few incentives for contracting a foreign marine 

cable supplier (Petrobras, 2014c).  

An effective solution to this might be strategic cooperation. Through alliances with local 

partners Friesland Kabel can overcome local content barriers and exploit its competitive 

advantage over local suppliers. A more detailed analysis of strategic partnerships is provided 

in chapter 10.  

8.5 Industry Specialists 

The term “Custo Brasil” summarizes different environmental factors identified in chapter 2 

including bureaucracy, corruption or infrastructure. A valuable solution for the company to 

prepare itself for these types of business restrictions is obtaining professional support from 

market experts. 

One option is to hire private experts such as local businessmen, lawyers and consultancies 

which are more familiar with the Brazilian market. A more cost-efficient alternative is 

requesting the support of governmental institutions such as embassies, industry associations, 

consulates or chambers of commerce.  

On the German side, these include especially the chamber of commerce (AHK) in Rio de 

Janeiro, which among other sectors is specialized in the oil and gas industry. The AHK 

provides German companies with comprehensive services ranging from general market 

information to individual entry strategies (AHK, 2014a). 

The Brazilian counterpart is the agency Apex-Brasil. By working closely together with 

Petrobras, ONIP, and other local trade associations, Apex-Brasil aims to facilitate the market 

entry of foreign investors though providing business information, network building, 

opportunity identification and support in site selection (Apex-Brasil, 2014b).  

Another helpful institution is the Federation of the Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro 

(FIRJAN). Besides other performance areas, the FIRJAN is specialized in the oil and gas 

industry and through its international business center (Centro Internacional de Negócios - 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

49 

 

CIN) supports the market entry of national and foreign firms into the oil and gas supply chain 

(FIRJAN, 2015a). 

8.6 Customer Acquisition and Retention 

Due to Petrobras’ privileged market position it is almost impossible to avoid this potential 

customer. For this reason, everything will revolve around the question how Friesland Kabel 

will manage to be selected by Petrobras.  

One option is to directly apply through the supplier registration system “Petronect”. For 

this purpose, it is essential to know how Friesland Kabel can present itself in the best way 

during this procedure. A guide about the registration process, requirements and key success 

factors for applicants is provided in the following (Petrobras, 2014c).  

Petrobras’ online registration system regulates the procurement process for contracting 

suppliers of goods and services. With the grant of CRCC, registered companies obtain access 

to different procurement parties, market demands and bidding rounds. The registration is valid 

for up to one year and has to be annually renewed by updating legal and economic documents. 

The initial registrations process starts with the login on the online portal Petronect 

(.https://www.petronect.com.br/). At this stage, the firm has to provide information including 

the scope of goods and services, contact information, and local representation.  

After successful completion of the “identification” phase, the company will be evaluated in 

the “questionnaire” phase. The scope of evaluation depends on the type of supplier. Friesland 

Kabel falls into the category “Trade Manufacturer” which is a “supplier that produces 

equipment, materials or inputs and trades them directly with Petrobras.” In this case, the 

evaluation is based on technical, legal, economic, managerial, health, safety and environment 

criteria. The most relevant aspects to each criterion for the supply of products are summarized 

in the following: 

Legal requirements 

? Evidence that the company is regularly registered in the country of origin 

? The company must have a legal representative in Brazil in form of a person or entity 

empowered to receive summons and to respond administratively and judicially. 

Additional commercial representation is not mandatory but advisable for foreign 

companies. 

? Evidence that the company is not bankrupt or indebted. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

50 

 

? Commitment letter: Describes formally the interest of the company in being a supplier 

of Petrobras.  

Economic requirements 

? Economic stability is required in order to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of 

the products 

? Accounting documents: balance sheet and income statement for the end of the last two 

fiscal years  

Note: Financial statements must be delivered according to international standards including 

IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP (Generally Accepted 

Accounting Principles) 

Technical requirements 

? Technical capacity of production facilities and production units 

? Product certification (API, ASME etc.) 

Note: For different product types specific requirements exists. An overview is provided 

under http://sites.petrobras.com.br/CanalFornecedor/portugues/index.asp 

Health, safety and environmental requirements 

? Evaluation of how the company implement health, safety and environment criteria in 

the managerial system ( on a scale from 0 to 10 points) 

? Certification according to ISO-14001 and OHSAS 18001 (not mandatory) 

Managerial requirements 

? Refer to the evaluation of the quality of  the company´s corporate governance 

? Certification of ISO-9001 (Mandatory) 

After passing the evaluation phase, suppliers either obtain the certification or Petrobras 

optionally requires additional documents and sends technical experts in order to inspect the 

company on-site. Companies should take into consideration that the whole application 

procedure is very time-consuming and complex. It usually takes ca. 30 days after completing 

the questionnaire phase. However, required on-site inspections can significantly extend this 

period.

An alternative to applying for the registration system is to supply to a smaller producer, 

which in turn sell its products to Petrobras. Thus, Friesland Kabel would be able to narrow the 

options of Petrobras. The purpose of supplying initially to smaller companies in the industry 

is for Friesland Kabel to “get a foot in the door” and establish itself step by step.  

Once having entered a contractual agreement with Petrobras, it has to find ways to create 

incentives for gradually establishing a long term relationship and “close the door” for other 

market entrants (Bryce &amp;amp; Dyer, 2007, p. 92). To this aim, Friesland Kabel should try to 

generate network effects and create brand recognition based on their sources of competitive 

advantage. 

8.7 Product Segmentation 

As already mentioned, marine cables and network technology are the two product types of 

Friesland Kabel which best fit the related industry. In particular, cables for fixed installations 

in offshore vessels show the highest potential in terms of demand. For that reason, Friesland 

Kabel should focus on products which meet the particular requirements of the oil and gas 

production. These characteristics include mainly resistance against flames, fire, heat, smoke 

and oil. In the following the products which fulfill all these needs are listed and briefly 

described.

8.8 Warehousing 

The oil and gas industry requires a quick supply according to the exact material needs of its 

customers. For that reason, it is advisable for Friesland Kabel to place a local warehouse in 

Brazil. In this warehouse, the finished products will be stored and delivered directly from 

there to the customer. This logistical approach enables Friesland Kabel to maintain a source of 

supply, react to demand and exploit its fast production time by overcoming time and distance 

restrictions (Voortman, 2004, p. 55).  

Relevant aspects regarding the warehouse design are related to ownership and location. In 

view of financial constraints, Friesland Kabel should lease stock facilities and optionally share 

them with partners. Except for the cost advantage, a jointly owned warehouse offers Friesland 

Kabel further benefits including contractual adaption to the firm´s requirements, risk 

minimizing and flexibility with regard of prospective changes (Voortman, 2004, p. 58).

For the strategic site selection of the warehouse, the most relevant criteria have been 

determined and rated based on their impact on costs and supply time.

Between the five states (Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina 

and São Paulo) that have been taken into consideration, Rio de Janeiro, as the center of the 

national oil and shipbuilding industry, represents by far the best location, despite having the 

highest renting costs in the country (FipeZap, 2015, p. 2). 60% of the national gas reserves 

and more than 80% of the oil reserves are concentrated in Rio de Janeiro. Moreover, 18 

shipyards, more than 60 production platforms, 8 oil and gas terminals, 5 logistic bases 

(FIRJAN, 2015b), and different R&amp;amp;D centers are located in the state.  

Within the state of Rio de Janeiro, the city Niteroi has been further identified as one of the 

most suitable sites. Niteroi is the principal center of the country´s shipbuilding industry 

having the highest concentration of shipyards (see figure 8), of which the majority produces 

production units and offshore vessels for Petrobras. Only the 5 biggest shipyards located in 

the city, Aliança, Mauá, Vard, Brasa e Renave, comprise about 10.000 employees. 

Furthermore, 13 out of 50 associated companies of Sinaval and other major players of the 

industry including Enaval, Naproservice, UTC Engenhaira, Equipemar and Dockshore are 

located in the city (SINAVAL, 2014).

8.9 Research &amp;amp; Development 

The Pre-Salt oil and gas exploration presents new challenges to technology. For that 

reason, Friesland Kabel should invest in research and development in order to constantly 

adapt its products and services to newly emerging customer requirements.  

This can be done through cooperation with local research centers. One of the leading 

research institutions in Brazil within the field of oil and gas technology is the American 

multinational conglomerate General Electric (GE). The Oil &amp;amp; Gas business unit in Brazil 

employs more than 2.000 people between 6 different locations within the states São Paulo and 

Rio de Janeiro. Among other areas, the GE Oil &amp;amp; Gas is also specialized in technologies for 

the oil and gas offshore processing and subsea exploration (General Electric, 2014).

9 Market Entry Mode 

The choice of the entry mode is one of the central strategic decisions (“frontier issue”) for 

a company´s international expansion (Wind &amp;amp; Perlmutter, 1977). An international market 

entry mode is “an institutional arrangement that makes possible the entry of a company’s 

products, technology, human skills, management, or other resources into a foreign country” 

(Root, 1994, p. 41). Thus, the entry mode defines the framework of company´s international 

value-added activities and influences its future corporate governance. In this connection, it is 

important to note that the choice of foreign market entry mode often constitutes a sequential 

process in which companies depending on the course of internationalization gradually 

increase their commitment (Chang &amp;amp; Rosenzweig, 2001, pp. 750-751). 

9.1 Types and Systematization 

There are several types of international market entry modes. Buckley &amp;amp; Casson determine 

a set of 12 market entry strategies which in turn are subdivided into alternative variants 

(Buckley &amp;amp; Casson, 1998, pp. 547-549). The main entry mode types are: export, licensing, 

franchising, international joint ventures (IJVs) alliances and Greenfield investments (Johnson, 

et al., 2008, p. 31).   

Entry modes differ basically in the local focus on company´s business operations. Thus, 

organizations can either emphasize domestic value addition or focus on the host country. This 

distinction criterion is directly linked to the organizational trade-off between a risk or control 

based management approach (Root, 1994). Based on this dichotomy, three main types of 

entry modes can be distinguished (Zentes, 2012, p. 26):  

 

? Investment entry modes: The establishing of wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries can 

be realized in form of “Greenfield Investment” (new physical facilities) or through 

acquisitions of established local firms. Both types are considered the most host 

country based approaches which gives organizations effective control but involves 

high risks especially regarding the invested capital.  

 

? Cooperative entry modes: This type of foreign market entry mode includes mainly 

contractual arrangements such as licensing, franchising, joint ventures or alliances. In 

comparison to investment entry modes, cooperative forms of institutionalization are 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

58 

 

less risky, since a transfer of capital doesn’t happen or is only marginal. However, the 

level of control is limited due to coordination costs with contractual partners.  

 

? Export entry modes: Export through direct sale forces, agents, representatives or 

distributors constitute the most traditional entry mode on an exclusively market- 

driven basis. Exporting goods or services abroad requires the lowest resource 

commitment of organizations while the degree of control is very limited.

      Control 

 

9.2 Entry Mode Decision 

The choice of foreign market entry mode involves the consideration of different 

interrelated variables and dimensions including location costs, financial variables, cultural 

factors, market structure and adaption costs (Buckley &amp;amp; Casson, 1998, p. 543). Basically, it is 

possible to distinguish between external factors of the host country, external factors of the 

home country and internal factors (Davis, et al., 2000, p. 239) or (Root, 1994). 

 For the market entry of Friesland Kabel, the analysis follows a two-step approach. First, 

based on Root´s decision matrix, the most relevant external and internal variables for 

Friesland Kabel will be selected. Then, these selected criteria will be used to evaluate the 

previously identified types of entry mode. This makes it possible to draw conclusions about

which entry mode best fits to preferences of Friesland Kabel. After this initial assignment, it 

will be analyzed which alternative variants of the selected entry mode exist and determined 

which is the most suitable with regard to Friesland Kabel´s strategic situation.  

9.3 Framework Application: Market Entry Decision Matrix 

Based on the most relevant external and internal conditions of Friesland Kabel, the 

dimensions and variables in the left columns of table 19 have been selected. Every entry mode 

received an individual rating from 0 to 3 points for each criterion. Additionally, the variables 

have been roughly ranked according to their importance for Friesland Kabel from top to 

bottom whereby the most significant factors are located in the upper half.

9.4 Strategic Cooperation 

IJVs and strategic Alliances are the most appropriate entry modes for Friesland Kabel. In 

the presented framework they obtained the highest number of points in total and show the best 

results with respect to the most important aspects. Strategic partnerships provide Friesland 

Kabel with favorable conditions regarding restrictive host country barriers and the 

competitive structure of the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, such a strategy is feasible in 

view of Friesland Kabel´s financial resources and matches the company´s long-term 

orientation on the Brazilian market. In summary, the main objectives of Friesland Kabel to go 

for a strategic cooperation are:  

 

? Accelerated access to the market  

? Overcoming business constraints (local content requirements) 

? Risk minimization (compared to investment modes) 

? Market knowledge of local partner 

? Collaboration with competitors 

 

In contrast, investment entry modes would exceed the financial means and thus imply too 

much risk for the firm.  

Strategies on an exclusively sales-driven basis constitute an alternative for an initial market 

penetration. However, they do not offer a solution concerning the increasing local content 

requirements and the supremacy of Petrobras.  

9.5 Joint Ventures vs. Strategic Alliances 

JVs and strategic alliances are alternative types of cooperative strategies. Basically, the 

difference between both forms is that JVs involve the creation of a third-party legal entity, 

whereas strategic alliances do not necessarily require equity sharing. For that reason, strategic 

alliances require less investment capital, provide more exit options and show less involvement 

between the partners (Walters, et al., 1994, p. 5).  

Despite these differences, the two terms will be used synonymously in the following 

analysis since such a determination requires more detailed information about the specific 

partners. Besides, the study focuses on the strategic settings of partnerships rather than on 

generic categories. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

9.6 Joint Venture Formation 

After deciding to engage in a cooperative strategy the next questions deal with finding the 

appropriate design and the right business partner.  

9.6.1 Joint Venture Design 

First, it will be analyzed how a potential JV between Friesland Kabel and a Brazilian firm 

may be broadly designed regarding the location and the ownership of production and 

distribution. Buckley &amp;amp; Casson distinguish in their international entry mode model five types 

of JV based market entry strategies (Buckley &amp;amp; Casson, 1998, p. 548): 

 

? JV in production: Partner firms share the production whereas distribution is separated. 

? JV in distribution: Partner firms share distribution whereas the production is separated. 

? JV exporting: The foreign partner exports to a joint distribution facility in the host 

country. 

? FDI/JV: The foreign partner alone owns the production whereas the distribution is 

shared. 

? JV/FDI: The foreign partner alone owns the distribution whereas the production is 

shared. 

 

Between these alternatives, in the first entry phase only the JV exporting option can be 

considered, since Friesland Kabel obtains the market relevant products already completed 

from its one single supplier. Thus, Friesland Kabel pursues a mutual distribution partnership 

which provides the company with different sorts of advantages including risk sharing, market 

knowledge of the local partner and product diversification. 

9.6.2 Partner Selection 

The success of JVs is crucially dependent on the right partner (Glaister &amp;amp; Buckley, 1999, 

pp. 136-138). According to Geringer, the partner selection “can influence the overall mix of 

available skills and resources, the operating policies and procedures and short- and long term 

viability of an IJV” (Geringer, 1991).  

9.6.3 Partner Classification 

The potential partner for Friesland Kabel can be categorized according to their size and 

product segment. Three different partner types have been considered as possible options. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

62 

 

Friesland Kabel should use all three strategies alternatively, with option A as a priority, 

followed by B and C. 

 

Big scale MNC: The first choice for Friesland Kabel`s partner is the market leader 

Petrobras. This option refers to a non-equity contract where Friesland Kabel directly exports 

its products to Petrobras after having been selected through the application process and 

entered into a contractual agreement.  

This asymmetric type of partnership is mainly based on the task-related dimension. Big 

scales MNs typically provide greater ‘staying power’ and a greater volume of resources 

(Williams &amp;amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234). For entering the market it constitutes the less risky option 

with the highest likelihood of returns of investment. However, the level of control for 

Friesland Kabel is very low in view of such a big partner. Therefore, it is crucial for the 

company to develop, in the curse of time, further incentives for maintaining a long-term 

cooperation. 

 

Middle scale producers: With regard to Friesland Kabel´s target segments middle scale 

companies are platform manufacturer and a vessel producer. Here, the contractual framework 

again constitutes a non-equity alliance with an import based strategy.  

 

Example 1: MODEC 

Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Tokyo, MODEC is a multinational contractor 

specialized in engineering, procurement, construction and installation of floating production 

storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessels and 

tension leg platforms (TLPs). In Brazil the company produces FSPOs in the shipyard Brasfels 

located in the state of Rio de Janeiro (MODEC, 2015). 

  

Example 2: BW Offshore 

Headquartered in Singapore and Oslo, BW Offshore is a global operator of FPSO. In more 

than 30 years of experience, the company has executed 38 FPSO and FSO projects. In Brazil 

BW Offshore has offices in Rio de Janeiro, São Paul and Vitória and already launched joint 

projects with the shipyard Quip in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (BW Offshore, 2015). 

 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

63 

 

Small scale producers: The third option is to cooperate with another smaller equipment 

producer. JVs of similar size companies generally are more compatible regarding the 

operational environment and corporate culture (Williams &amp;amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234). However, to 

guarantee successful cooperation the partner-related criteria are more important in comparison 

to the previous cases.  

Furthermore, the product relatedness is an essential factor since it determines to what 

extent Friesland Kabel can share the partner´s distribution channels, brand and product image, 

industrial knowledge and facilities for potential prospective production relocation (Yan &amp;amp; 

Luo, 2001, p. 24) and (Geringer, et al., 1989). For that reason the product fit constitutes the 

most fundamental criterion for this option. 

 

Example 1: Dova Supply 

Founded in 1964, Dova Supply is a Brazilian supplier for electronic equipment with a 

focus on power cables, cables for application in the construction sector and marine cables for 

the oil and gas industry. The company has a local warehouse in Rio de Janeiro with a total 

area of 2.000m². In collaboration with the major distribution partner cofibam and Wirex the 

company already supplies its products to Petrobras. In the view of further expansion, Dova 

Supply is searching for acquisitions with other national or foreign cable suppliers (Dova 

Supply, 2015).  

 

Example 2: HUMMEL 

Founded in 1948, Hummel AG is a German multinational company specialized in 

connection systems. In Brazil, the company operates through its subsidiary Hummel 

Connector Systems Ltda., based in Tatui, São Paulo, since 2004. The company’s products 

include cable glands, cable protection systems and plug-in connectors. These products are 

also certified according to several national and international approvals (Brasil Offshore, 

2015). 

9.6.4 Partner Selection Criteria 

The specific partner selection has to be carried out based on appropriate criteria. Basically, 

two dimensions of partner complementarity can be distinguished. Task-related criteria include 

tangible and intangible resources which organizations require in order to achieve their 

corporate goals. Partner-related criteria refer to aspects which influence the efficiency and 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

64 

 

effectiveness of partnerships (Geringer, 1989, p. 569). Based on this dichotomy, several 

dimensions can be subdivided (Glaister, et al., 2004, pp. 38-46) or (Yan &amp;amp; Luo, 2001).  

For the prospective partner identification of Friesland Kabel, the most relevant selection 

criteria with regard to the firm’s strategic goals have been determined and evaluated. In this 

connection, it must be emphasized that only aspects for initial partner identification were 

considered. A more detailed examination of compatibility requires contractual negotiations 

(Williams &amp;amp; Lilley, 1993, p. 234).

10 Marketing Plan: The SAVE Framework 

After having selected potential partners, the question arises how Friesland Kabel can 

convince them to collaborate. This is a matter of marketing. In the international entry strategy 

process, the development of a marketing plan is one of the basic elements (Root, 1994, p. 4).  

For developing a marketing strategy, one has to take into consideration that Friesland 

Kabel targets business markets (B2B) rather than consumer markets (B2C). Particularities of 

B2B markets include the complexity of products and services, the nature and diversity of 

industrial demand, a lower number of customers, a larger volume of customers and a closer 

long-term supplier-customer-relationship (Kotler, et al., 2006, p. 21). However, the core 

difference is related to differentiation of products and services. In B2C environments, 

differentiation can be equated with competition between firms, whereas in a B2B context, the 

focus on differentiation is to provide a product or service that meets the particular needs of the 

customers. 

Due to this distinction, for the marketing plan of Friesland Kabel, the so called SAVE 

framework will be applied since it considers the particularities of the business market 

environment. Based on the 4Ps (Product, Place, Price, and Promotion) (McCarthy, 1960, p. 

45) model the SAVE framework also consists of four basic elements: Solution, Access, 

Value, and Education (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  

10.1 Solution 

Customers do not merely buy products; they buy solutions in order to solve problems. 

Selling appropriate solutions in turn requires identifying the problems of customers (Freese, 

2010). So, what are the customer´s requirements for Friesland Kabel`s products? The most 

important aspect is that the products work reliably even under difficult environmental 

conditions. In other words, the function of the products is to avoid cause problems within 

already complex processes. In this regard, Friesland Kabel´s products have all the necessary 

characteristics including robustness and oil-, fire- and temperature resistance. 

Further customer needs are related to service. The firm has to be able to quickly adapt its 

products to the customer´s needs. This applies to the product characteristics as well as to the 

number of required products. Friesland Kabel offers customization, innovation and approved 

experience within different environmental, technical and cultural contexts. Moreover, 

Friesland Kabel ensures through its comprehensive logistic concept that products are 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

66 

 

delivered on time and complete and in case of increasing demand the company is able to 

deliver additional products from stock. 

10.2 Access 

Access is about making the product or service available to the customer. For this purpose, 

companies have to analyze where their customers are present and through what kind of 

channels they can reach them (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  

In this connection, trade fairs or industry related events present the best opportunity. The 

table below provides an overview about the major Brazilian trade fairs of the offshore sector.

A cheaper solution than fairs are ads in trade journals. The journal TN Petróleo offers 

companies of the industry different formats in order to present their products and services in a 

print run of over 15.00 exemplars per edition (TN Petróleo, 2015).  

Another approach is to intensify the local presence in Brazil via distributors and by 

establishing offices in the country. Due to the high concentration of oil and gas companies, 

suppliers, shipyards, industry-specific research centers and specialized labor, Rio de Janeiro 

constitutes the center of the Brazilian oil and gas industry. Further attractive industry related 

areas include the shipbuilding and maritime technology cluster in the southern state Rio 

Grande do Sul and the northern port complex Porto do Açu. (AHK; GTAI, 2014, pp. 52-54). 

At these locations, potential distributors of Friesland Kabel have to be present and build up 

networks.

Moreover, Brazil is one of the largest and fastest growing internet markets worldwide and 

is leading in the usage of social media (Barnett, 2011, p. 87). For that reason, investing in e-

commerce constitutes another possibility. Friesland Kabel already possesses a web presence 

in Portuguese, which is the first step in order to facilitate the online access for potential 

customers. Other possibilities are intensifying the presence on industry-specific platforms and 

portals. These includes memberships in associations such as the ABPG (= Associação 

Brasileira de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento em Petróleo e Gás), the ABPIP (=Associação A 

Associação Brasileira dos Produtores Independentes de Petróleo e Gás) or the search engine 

for operational ship suppliers SHIPSERV (Shipserv, 2015). 

10.3 Value 

According to the SAVE model firms should focus on “articulate the benefits relative to 

price, rather than stressing how price relates to production costs, profit margins, or 

competitor’s prices” (Ettenson, et al., 2013). This is because customers do not solely consider 

price but the value of products or services, which can be defined as the customer´s perceived 

benefits minus customer´s price (Leszinski &amp;amp; Marn, 1997).  

Due to the fact that Friesland Kabel has to import its products, it must charge higher prices 

than local producers. Nevertheless, Friesland Kabel can compensate its lack in price 

competitiveness through offering safe and high quality products in combination with a 

comprehensive service.  

By applying this to Porters´s generic framework, Friesland Kabel should follow a 

differentiation-focused strategy where the company concentrates on producing specified 

products for the unique needs of the customer (needs-based positioning) (Porter, 2008b, p. 42) 

(Porter, 1980, pp. 35-39). In contrast, cost leadership is of secondary significance.  

10.4 Education 

Instead of relying on advertising, PR and other promotional instruments Friesland Kabel 

should focus on providing information “relevant to their customer´s specific needs at each 

point of the purchase cycle” (Ettenson, et al., 2013).  

At the pre-purchase stage, the main objective of customer education is to provide 

customers with knowledge in order to increase their awareness and understanding of the 

product (Best, 2005, p. 69). This especially applies to technological product types where 

customers have to be educated about the applications of the product in order to assess the 

suitability for their usage. For this purpose, Friesland Kabel should consider different types of

68 

 

demonstration tools including face-to-face demonstration, video-clips, lectures and web-based 

presentations (Aubert, 2007, pp. 44-51).   

At the post-purchase stage, customer education aims mainly to provide customers with 

knowledge about how to use the products. To this aim, the company can use tutorials, 

computer-based training software and user hotlines (Aubert, 2007, pp. 44-51). 

For both purchasing phases, Friesland Kabel might additionally implement an internal 

system where into which all employees who are in direct contact with customers can enter 

customer requests in order to adapt the prospective communication process.

11 Action Plan 

After having chosen an appropriate set of strategies in chapter 8, these have to be translated 

into concrete actions. For this purpose, action plans involve appropriate means and provide 

strategy leaders with information in order to achieve specific strategic objectives. Thus, an 

action plan constitutes a link between strategy formulation and strategy implementation and 

provides a basis for the evaluation of whether the developed strategies and objectives are 

achievable according to the capabilities and limitations of the company.  

An action plan is a precursor of an implementation program and provides only broad 

directives without going into details. Moreover, an action plan cannot be seen as an ultimate 

solution but rather as a guideline which has to be adapted if objectives and strategies are not 

attainable (Rainey, 2010, pp. 413-415). 

There are many ways to develop an action plan. Typically it contains the following 

components (Harvard Business Review, 2009, p. 29): 

 

? Priority issue: Description of the broad area to be dealt with 

? The objectives of the strategic initiatives 

? The actions steps make up the main part of the action plan and specify in detail who 

will do what, by when, to make which changes happen. 

? Resources (i. e., money, staff) which are necessary in order to carry out the actions 

? Potential barriers  

? Communication lines that need to be active  

 

In the following, the different action steps according to the strategic objectives in chapter 9 

will be briefly explained. 

11.1 Compliance Officer 

For the compliance strategy of Friesland Kabel, first of all a compliance officer has to be 

appointed and trained via seminars. For this, the German Technical Inspection Association 

(TÜV) offers an internationally accepted compliance officer certification (TÜV Rheinland, 

2015). The chosen employee will be the first contact person for compliance issues and 

responsible for expressing the companies legal and ethical standards to the customers. The 

compliance officer will create a corporate code of conduction and work together with the 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

70 

 

marketing department in order to communicate the compliance activities through different 

channels. 

11.2 Customer Management 

Friesland Kabel has to ensure that its performance is perceived positively by its customers. 

Therefore, the firm should conduct annual surveys to evaluate the customer’s perception of 

Friesland Kabel´s products and services compared to those of other suppliers. Major 

customers should be asked to give a monthly feedback about their satisfaction with Friesland 

Kabels performance. Additionally, regular personal contact to customers has to be maintained 

by local distributors. Implementing these measures will give Friesland Kabel a closer tie to its 

key customers and a certain level of market feedback (Kaplan &amp;amp; Norton, 1993).  

11.3 Partnership with GE Oil &amp;amp; Gas 

A first step to provide state of the art technology and to adapt the products of Friesland 

Kabel to the changing industry requirements is to build up partnerships with a local research 

center. As already mentioned, the Oil &amp;amp; Gas research center of the American multinational 

conglomerate General Electric in Rio de Janeiro offers excellent conditions for this. Friesland 

Kabel should try to get in contact with employees from the GE Oil &amp;amp; Gas department. This 

task can be taken over by a local Brazilian distributor who is also able to frequently arrange 

personal meetings in order to discuss future joint projects. 

Furthermore, Friesland Kabel should register on the online GE online platform “Technical 

Enhancements &amp;amp; Notifications" in order to keep on the top of the latest technologies and 

technical upgrades applicable to their own products (General Electric, 2015).  

The acquired information has to be directly reported to Friesland Kabel´s supplier Helkma 

for the integration of new technological requirements into the production process. 

11.4 Partner Relations 

Similar to the contact with the research center, a regular exchange with the German-

Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AHK Rio) and the Brazilian Trade and 

Investment Promotion Agency (Apex-Brasil) has to be maintained in order to be informed 

about new possibilities to develop Friesland Kabel´s business. The contact with the AHK Rio 

could be done on a monthly basis in German language with the expert for oil and gas, Thomas 

Olsinger. For the communication with Apex-Brasil and the FIRJAN a local distributor or 

Portuguese speaking employee of Friesland Kabel is advisable. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry:

11.5 Stock Management 

An investment in a local warehouse in Brazil should be first evaluated from a financial 

perspective. Therefore, the management and the accounting department should check their 

financial resources for such a project by considering the costs and return of investments. Once 

the available funds are set, potential equity partners have to be identified and contacted.  

11.6 Product Segment: Oil &amp;amp; Gas 

Friesland Kabel´s products which are most suitable for the application in ultra-deep see 

areas (see chapter 8.7) have to be segmented into a specific category “oil and gas”. For any 

marketing strategies, these kinds of products and their special characteristics have to be 

emphasized. 

11.7 Partnership Selection 

Finding a strategic partner is a time-consuming task that should be carefully planned and 

divided into several steps. First, potential partners have to be determined. This can be 

achieved by internet research, visiting trade fairs and with the support of the institutions 

described above (AHK Rio, Apex-Brasil etc.). Then, these companies have to be contacted 

via letters and phone calls. In a next step, the interested firms will be evaluated based on the 

criteria outlined in chapter 9.6.4. Personal meetings complement the selection process and 

offer opportunities for fist contractual negotiations. 

11.8 Product Certification 

The first step to becoming a supplier for Petrobras is to apply for the company´s online 

registration system. For this, the guide in chapter 8.6 provides a basis. Of particular 

importance in this context is the presentation of technical and managerial certificates. As 

mentioned in chapter 4.1, Friesland Kabel´s supplier Helkama already possesses some of 

these certificates such as ISO-9001, ISO-14001 and several technical approvals (DNV, GL, 

etc.) (Friesland Kabel, 2015). Additionally, Friesland Kabel and Helkama have to ensure that 

other certificates required by Petrobras including API, ASME and OHSAS 18001 will be 

obtained.  

11.9 Market Entry Stages 

In view of the economic crisis which seriously affects the oil and gas industry as well as 

the shipbuilding sector, it is advisable that Friesland Kabel momentarily keep its investments 

in Brazil low in order to grant the possibility of restructurings or a temporary market exit. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

72 

 

This applies especially to acquisitions of tangible assets. Thus, at this stage the company 

should focus on sales and marketing activities via on-site distributors on-site who are building 

up networks and trying to find commercial partners. Then, when the market begins to recover 

and the demand increases, Friesland Kabel should invest in a local stock facility with sales 

offices in order to exploit economies of scale and finally offer better prices and on-time 

delivery to its clients.

12 Summary and Outlook 

In the first section of this study, Friesland Kabel`s potential to create economic value 

within the Brazilian oil and gas industry has been investigated on three dimensions: First, the 

macro environment, second the offshore oil and gas industry, and third the company´s internal 

resources and capabilities.  

Based on several macroeconomic forces such as a fast growing middle class, vast reserves 

of commodities and a diversified economy, Brazil is one of the most attractive emerging 

markets for foreign investment. However, investing in Brazil is associated with different sorts 

of business risks including corruption, inflation, infrastructure deficiencies and bureaucratic 

burdens. This is why Brazil is not the right place for short term and aggressive investments. In 

contrast, long-term commitment and thorough strategic preparation are key success factors for 

the performance in this dynamic market. 

After the economic boom in 2009, Brazil is currently fighting a “crisis of credibility” in 

which the country has to regain the confidence of the population and foreign investors. At this 

point, it is difficult to assess whether and when this downturn will stop. At any rate, in such a 

situation and especially for new market entrants and SMEs such as Friesland Kabel, it is 

important to adapt the company´s strategies to this situation in order to avoid expensive and 

time-consuming returns.  

Similar to the overall macroeconomic situation, the oil and gas sector as one of the major 

industries within the country is simultaneously experiencing a tangible decrease in growth. 

This is mainly caused by two factors: the fall in global oil prices and a series of corruption 

affairs involving the national energy cooperation Petrobras. Nevertheless, the market still 

offers huge potentials. This is especially true for the offshore sources in the pre-salt layer, 

where the production rates have been growing steadily over the last years and discoveries of 

new sources are expected. Although the current four-year business plan of Petrobras provides 

a reduction of expenses by 37%, the remaining amount of  US$ 130,3 billion still represents a 

huge investment volume which corresponds to a value of US$ 3,7 million per hour.  

With regard to Friesland Kabel´s target market, three segments have been determined and 

analyzed: First, the E&amp;amp;P sector as the overall segment, second the shipbuilding industry and 

third, the marine cable and network industry. Within the Brazilian oil and gas supply chain, 

E&amp;amp;P activities, which concentrate 83% of Petrobras future investments, show by far the 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

75 

 

biggest market size and highest growth rates. On the contrary, the shipbuilding industry as a 

sub-market of the E&amp;amp;P segment is experiencing a substantial contraction in which orders for 

tanker vessels, production units, supply vessels and drilling rigs have been radically reduced. 

For the specific product segment of Friesland Kabel, little information could be obtained. 

However, due to the fact that marine cables and individual parts of network technology appear 

on former procurement lists of Petrobras and Sinaval, a certain demand can be assumed.  

Concerning the competition within the industry, the Porter 5 Forces analyses highlighted 

the market predominance of Petrobras and the local content requirements as the key 

competitive factors. Whilst Petrobras already concentrates almost all suppliers of the market, 

local content requirement still increases the competition between foreign companies.  

From an internal perspective different tangible and intangible resources of Friesland Kabel 

could be identified. Among them, the specified product properties, the comprehensive 

customer service and the experience in international projects have been determined as sources 

of competitive advantage. Weaknesses of the company are mainly related to the absence of 

price competitiveness, few financial resources and limited market knowledge.  

In total, on all three investigated dimensions favorable aspects as well as business 

restrictions for Friesland Kabel have been identified. Despite the crisis within the country in 

general and within the oil and gas industry in particular, both markets still offer certain 

potentials. Moreover, Friesland Kabel´s services and products show characteristics that are 

sources of sustainable competitive advantage and requested on the market.  

Concerning the temporary crisis it has to be considered that other main oil and gas 

producing countries are also affected of the declining oil prices. Against the background of 

increasing global demand of energy resources by fast growing economies like India and China 

and in expectations of future rising oil prices, it can be assumed that the market will recover 

in the medium and long-term.  

 

For the strategy formulation of Friesland Kabel´s market entry into the Brazilian oil and 

gas industry, the following six strategy components have been developed (1) mission, vision 

&amp;amp; objectives; (2) strategic position; (3) strategic actions; (4) entry mode; (5) marketing plan 

and (6) action plan. 

By defining Friesland Kabel´s mission, vision and objectives it was possible to clarify the 

fundamental goals of the company within the market. As a first guiding framework, the 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

76 

 

mission statement includes information about the target customers, their needs and the key 

capabilities of the company. From a more contextual perspective, the vision statement focuses 

on the core purpose and the long term goals of the firm. In order to translate these two 

concepts into precise performance targets, basic objectives for Friesland Kabel´s key result 

business areas were set. 

The SWOT analysis served to specify the strategic starting position of Friesland Kabel by 

determining the most impactful external and internal factors from the first part of the study. 

On this basis, the following strategic actions in order to leverage market opportunities and 

overcome business restrictions have been developed: 

 

? Due to recent corruption scandals within the industry, a corporate compliance strategy 

signalizes to Brazilian customers that Friesland Kabel is a reliable and fair business 

partner.  

? A value-based marketing strategy emphasizes the company’s internal strengths and 

compensates the fact that the firm cannot compete on product prices with suppliers of 

locally manufactured products. 

? The cooperation with research centers such as GE has the objective to constantly keep 

the products and services adapted to the fast changing technical requirements of the 

industry.  

? Collaborations with institutions like the AHK Rio Janeiro, Appex Brasil or FIRJAN 

offer reliable support, especially in the first phase of the market entry. 

? The acquisition of a local warehouse in Brazil leads to reduced supplying times and 

import costs, which in turn will have positive effects on service quality and price 

competiveness. 

? Through product segmentation, Friesland Kabel can increase its marketing efficiency 

by offering the individual products to a specific market segment in accordance with 

the customer´s needs.  

? Through strategic collaboration with a Brazilian company, Friesland Kabel might be 

able to overcome local content barriers, share risk and use the market knowledge of 

the local partner. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

77 

 

? The customer acquisition of Petrobras can be achieved by applying directly for the 

registration system or via an intermediary company which is already registered as a 

supplier of Petrobras. 

? A staged marked expansion by which Friesland Kabel gradually increases its market 

commitment allows the firm to accumulate knowledge while minimizing the 

investment risk. 

 

Concerning the market entry, a strategic partnership is the most appropriate entry mode for 

Friesland Kabel. The main motives to choose a cooperative strategy are an accelerated market 

access, overcoming local content restrictions, financial risk minimization, compensating the 

lack of market knowledge and the reduction of competition. 

Based on the business model of Friesland Kabel, it has been shown that an export 

cooperation, by which the company exports its products directly to a joint distribution facility 

in the host country, is the most suitable option. This export variant is applicable to all three 

size categories of partners, big, medium and small size. Here, Friesland Kabel does not have 

to commit itself since at this stage all three strategies are consistent with the company’s vision 

and can be pursued simultaneously. For the evaluation of specific partners a framework based 

on the most relevant selection criteria has been additionally elaborated. 

In terms of Friesland Kabel´s marketing strategy, the SAVE model, as a special approach 

for B2B environments, has been applied. The concept has demonstrated that for the most 

relevant needs of Friesland Kabel´s potential customers, the company provides state-of-the-art 

solutions and comprehensive logistical services. 

Based on these capabilities and the cost-disadvantage in relation to local competitors 

Friesland Kabel should follow a differentiation-focused marketing strategy by which the 

company concentrates on producing specified products rather than pursuing cost leadership. 

In order to make these solutions accessible to its customers, international trade fairs and 

road shows represent the most convenient distribution channels. Other sales tools include 

local distributors, advertisements in trade journals, e-commerce and memberships within 

industry-specific platforms and portals. 

In regard to the message that will be transmitted through these channels at the pre-purchase 

stage, the objective is to increase the customer’s awareness and understanding of the products. 



The Brazilian Offshore Oil and Gas Industry: 

 

78 

 

The aim at the post-purchase stage is to provide knowledge about how to use the products. An 

internal customer system additionally helps to update both types of information. 

To sum up, the developed strategic tools provide an effective basis in order to overcome 

most of the identified business barriers, exploit market opportunities and leverage internal 

strengths. Nevertheless, the crisis in the related markets and segments still represents a huge 

challenge which is outside of Friesland Kabel´s sphere of influence. For this reason, a market 

entry at that time cannot be recommended without restrictions. In any case, Friesland Kabel 

should temporarily keep its commitment at a low level. This applies in particular to high 

financial investments such as the acquirement of equities. A sales-based strategy with a 

special focus on network-building is currently the best approach. However, it is important for 

the company to build a solid foundation at this stage, in order to be prepared when the market 

starts to return to grow.
