With the use of ethylene dibromide for mango disinfestation being ruled out, vapor heat or hot water treatments are the only

alternatives for quarantine treatments of mangoes. Physical treatments such as heat treatments have been implicated in higher

incidence of physiological disorders and enhancement of ripening processes. Therefore, the objective of the present work was

to determine the effects of hot water treatments on ethylene production and on the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase. Cv. Keitt

mangoes were immersed for 3 min in hot water at 53 °C or 90 min in water at 46 °C. Immediately after the treatments, some of
the mangoes were analyzed for ACC oxidase activity and others were stored to be analyzed after 4 days at 12 °C. There was a
significant increase in the ACC oxidase activity just after the hot water treatments. After 4 days, only the mangoes treated for

90 min maintained high ethylene production and ACC oxidase activity. Tissue from the outer layers of the mesocarp had higher

enzyme activity compared to tissues from the innermost layers of the mesocarp of heat-treated mangoes.

Efeito de tratamento térmico na atividade da ACC oxidase em mangas ‘Keitt’: Com a proibição do uso de dibrometo de

etileno para tratamento quarentenário, os tratamentos térmicos, água ou vapor quente, constituem as únicas alternativas

disponíveis para desinfestação de mosca-das-frutas em mangas. Considerando que os tratamentos físicos têm sido

responsabilizados pela ocorrência de distúrbios e pela aceleração do amadurecimento, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi

determinar o efeito do tratamento com água quente na produção de etileno e na atividade in vitro da ACC oxidase. Frutos da cv.

Keitt foram imersos, por 3 min, em água a 53 °C ou, por 90 min, em água a 46 °C. Logo após o tratamento, parte dos frutos foi
analisada quanto à atividade da ACC oxidase e, parte, armazenada por 4 dias a 12 °C. Houve um significativo aumento na
atividade da ACC oxidase em seguida aos tratamentos. Passados 4 dias, apenas os frutos imersos por 90 min mantiveram tal

atividade e a produção de etileno elevadas. Comparando a atividade em três profundidades do mesocarpo, as camadas mais

exteriores apresentaram o maior efeito dos tratamentos.

INTRODUCTION

Physical treatments to eliminate organisms of quaran-

tine concern, especially fruit flies (Anastrepha fraterculus and

Ceratitis capitata) were developed as alternatives to chemi-

cal treatments, which face severe restrictions, if not prohibi-

tion because of their negative environmental effects (Couey,

1989). For mangoes, hot water dips have been approved.

These treatments allow mango shipments out of areas where

fruit flies are endemic (Mitcham and McDonald, 1993b). The

use of hot water as a disinfestation treatment has spread be-

cause of its efficacy and the low incidence of damage to the

treated fruit (Jacobi et al., 1995). Nevertheless, some peel

disorders as well as quality losses have been observed (Jacobi

and Wong, 1991). Among those is accumulation of starch

grains in sub-epidermal tissues, probably resulting from heat

deactivation of starch hydrolases (Jacobi and Wong, 1992).

Negative effects on fruit color were also reported (Joyce et

al., 1993). All these effects were more pronounced on man-

goes harvested at the mature green ripeness stage than at later

stages (Jacobi and Wong, 1992).

Besides their use as quarantine treatments, hot water dips

are also effective in the control of anthracnose, a critical

postharvest pathogen that can cause severe losses in mango

(Coates et al., 1993). To control postharvest pathogens, the

use of higher temperatures has been recommended, though

for shorter exposure times in order to avoid damage to treated

fruit.

Mitcham and McDonald (1993a) measured an increase

in ethylene production as a response to heat stress. Increases

in ethylene production might stimulate ripening processes.

However, this stimulus could be limited because of the ef-

fects of elevated temperatures on the enzymes of the ethyl-

ene biosynthetic pathway (Paull and Chen, 2000). Therefore

the objective of the present work was to determine the ef-

fects of heat treatments on ethylene biosynthesis, and more

specifically on the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Cultivar Keitt mangoes were harvested at the mature

green ripeness stage from a grove located in Pine Island/Fort

Myers, Florida. Sixteen uniform fruit, average weight of 595.9

± 45.1 grams, preclimacteric, producing 0.0482 ± 0.0018 µL
C2H4 

. kg-1 . h-1, were immersed in hot water for either 3 min

at 53 °C or 90 min at 46 °C.
Shortly before the heat treatments, ethylene production

of each fruit was determined. One-mL headspace samples

were retrieved from 1.7 L glass jars and injected in a photo-

ionization gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a 60/80

mesh 760 x 3.16 mm activated alumina column. The GC de-

tector and injector were operated at room temperature. The

column temperature was slightly above ambient because of

heating by the UV source.

After the heat treatments the mangoes were left for 30

min at room temperature and then ethylene production of each

individual fruit was again determined. The mangoes from each

heat treatment were divided into two groups. One group of

eight fruit was transferred to a cold store to be analyzed after

4 days at 12 °C. The other eight fruit were immediately ana-
lyzed for the in vitro activity of ACC oxidase. Tissues from

three depths of the mesocarp, 5 mm underneath the epider-

mis, the median portion of the mesocarp, and from tissues

close to the seed, were used to determine enzyme activity.

ACC oxidase activity was determined according to

Fernandez-Maculet and Yang (1992) with modifications. In-

stead of TRIS (Tris[hydroximethyl]aminomethane), 0.4

mol.L-1 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid (MOPS) was

used in the extraction buffer. To the assay buffer in a test tube

were added 1.64 mL of 50 mmol.L-1 MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 %

glycerol (v/v), 20 mmol.L-1 sodium bicarbonate and 0.2 mL

of the crude extract of ACC oxidase. Prior to 1 h of incuba-

tion in the test tube at 30 °C, 40 µL of a mixture containing
250 mmol.L-1 sodium ascorbate, 1 mmol.L-1 FeSO4.7H2O,

50 mmol.L-1 dithiothreitol (DTT), and 50 mmol.L-1 ACC was

added to the assay.

After the 4 days of storage at 12 °C, ethylene production
and ACC oxidase activity were determined as described above

from tissue samples of three depths of the mesocarp.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The in vitro activity of ACC oxidase just after the heat

treatment was significantly higher in mangoes treated for 3

min in hot water at 53 °C compared to the 90 min treatment
at 46 °C (table 1). After 4 more days of storage at 12 °C, no
differences were determined in enzyme activity with regards

to water temperatures. However, comparing analysis periods

of enzyme activity, just after the treatment and after the stor-

age period, for either 3 or 90 min hot water dips, there was a

significantly higher ACC oxidase activity just after the heat

treatment in mangoes treated for 3 min at 53 °C. A longer
exposure time at a lower temperature did not result in in-

creased enzyme activity.

These increases in enzyme activity are probably a result

of the heat stress caused by the hot water treatments. Chan et

al. (1998) observed the same stimulus to ACC oxidase activ-

ity in papaya treated in hot water.

Antunes and Sfakiotakis (2000) working with kiwis con-

cluded that there is a pronounced inhibitory effect of heat on

ethylene biosynthesis. Storage treatments of 38 °C or 40 °C
completely suppressed ethylene production. The authors also

concluded that ACC oxidase is more susceptible to elevated

temperatures compared to ACC synthase.

These differences in ACC oxidase activity of cv. Keitt

mangoes did not result in significant increases in ethylene

production following the hot water dips (figure 1). However,

mangoes immersed in 53 °C water for only 3 min produced
an average of 0.06 µL C2H4 

. kg-1 . h-1 more ethylene than

mangoes treated for 90 min at 46 °C, which might be attrib-
utable to slight increments in enzyme activity, though not

statistically different.

On the contrary, mangoes immersed for 90 min in hot

water at 46 °C had after 4 days at 12 °C a significant peak of
ethylene production, above 0.2 µL kg-1. h-1, which might be
considered part of the climacteric peak. It might be further-

more considered that the climacteric peak was initiated by

the heat treatment. Bender (1996) concluded that the climac-

teric peak of mangoes lasts at least 5 days with maximum

ethylene production rates over 1 µL C2H4 
. kg -1. h-1.

Ketsa et al. (1999) though determined a 5-day delay in

the upsurge of the climacteric peak in heat-treated cv. Nam

Dormai mangoes. Verlinden and Woodson (1998) also re-

ported a 24-hour delay in the ethylene peak of carnations

treated for 1 day at 44 °C.
These differences in the start of the climacteric peak might

be related to the duration of the heat treatment. Ketsa et al.

(1999) applied hot air at 38 °C for 3 days, while in the present
experiment the longest treatment period was of 90 min. Most

probably treatment duration is an important factor to con-

sider in the indication if there are or are not effects on ripen-

ing processes of mangoes.

Analyzing the differences in the in vitro activity of ACC

oxidase extracted from different depths of the mango meso-

carp treated with hot water for 3 or 90 min, higher enzyme

activity was observed only just after the 3 min treatment and

only in the outermost layers of the mesocarp (table 2). In the

remainder of the tissues no stimuli to ACC oxidase activity

were observed.

McCollum et al. (1995) observed the same differences

in enzyme activity and ethylene production in heat-treated

cucumbers. The authors suggested the possibility of a more

complex control mechanism that goes beyond the regulation

of the enzymes of the ethylene pathway, specifically ACC

oxidase. However, the authors did not indicate which mecha-

nism or mechanisms could be involved in such regulation.

On the other hand, Ievinsh et al. (2001) observed that distinct

abiotic stimuli for increases in ACC oxidase activity were

followed with synchronous increases in ethylene production

of Pinus sylvestris needles. This conclusion diverges from

our observations with “Keitt” mangoes. Most probably the

climacteric ripening pattern of the mangoes and cucumbers

in contrast to pine needles is responsible for these differences.

After storage for 4 days at 12 °C, ethylene production was
higher in mangoes from the 90 min hot water treatment com-

pared to mangoes dipped in hot water for only 3 min. Man-

goes from the latter treatment did not exhibit significantly

altered ripening processes. After 4 days at 12 °C, they still
were preclimacteric. Ethylene production was below 0.2 µL
C2H4 

. kg-1. h-1, a concentration indicated by Bender and Brecht

(2000) as the beginning of the climacteric rise in ethylene

production of cv. Tommy Atkins and cv. Kent mangoes.

Treatments

Increased enzyme activity observed in the outermost layer

of mango tissue after the 3 min hot water dip at 53 °C indi-
cates that there is a tissue response to the treatment, how-

ever, this response does not permeate to the core of the mango

mesocarp. Yet there is a tendency for a slight increase in en-

zyme activity determined in tissues from the median portion

of the mesocarp, comparing 0.365 nL C2H4 
.  g-1 . h-1 to 0.600

nL C2H4 
.  g-1 . h-1 in table 2.

With  the  more  prolonged  heat  treatment,  90 min at

46 °C, no increases in enzyme activity were determined.
Reduced enzyme activity, nonetheless could be an indication

of a more remarkable and lasting effect of the hot water dip

on ACC oxidase. Most likely a lasting effect of the prolonged

heat treatment was the cause of the reduced ACC oxidase

activity in agreement with the observations of Jacobi and

Wong (1992) regarding starch hydrolysis of heat-treated

mangoes.

In interpreting the effects of the hot water dips on the in

vitro activity of ACC oxidase determined immediately after

treatment application, we need to consider that mangoes ini-

tiate ripening processes in the innermost layers of the meso-

carp (Mitcham and McDonald, 1993a). This behavior be-

comes evident in examining enzyme activity before treatments

(0.667 nL C2H4
. g-1. h-1) to the activity of tissues close to the

seed after the heat treatment and after 4 days at 12 °C. In
both analyses there is an indication of lower enzyme activity,

possibly a consequence of the increased temperatures at the

core of the mangoes as is required for quarantine treatment

(Sharp, 1986).

The significant increase in the in vitro activity of ACC

oxidase of cv. Keitt mangoes immersed for 3 min in hot wa-

ter at 53 °C and the return to initial levels of activity after 4
days at 12 °C indicates that the effect of short exposure to
heat only has a temporary effect on ethylene biosynthesis.

Higher rates of ethylene production during storage at 12 °C
of mangoes treated for 90 min with hot water at 46 °C prob-
ably derives from enhanced ACC oxidase activity of epider-

mal tissues since the innermost tissues there is no increment

in enzyme activity.
