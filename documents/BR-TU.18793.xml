Abstract  

To meet global energy demand both fossil and non-fossil energy sources will be required in the 

foreseeable future. The continued large-scale and widespread consumption of fossil fuels and in 

particular coal for power generation is necessary to sustain population and economic growth. Amongst 

a spectrum of measures, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have the potential to play a 

key role, in response to climate change, by decarbonizing on a large scale the energy and other 

industrial sectors.  

This thesis has been developed in the context of the COMET project, which is funded under the 

Seventh Framework Program. The COMET project goal is to assess the techno-economic feasibility of 

integrating carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructures in the West Mediterranean area. This 

project jointly coordinated by Portugal, Spain and Morocco considers several development scenarios 

for these countries energy systems within the time period 2010-2050. These scenarios include the 

location and development of the energy related and industrial major CO2 point sources and the 

available potential for geological storage in those countries. The long-term scenarios of the 

Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan energy systems are to be modelled and evaluated through the 

technical economic MARKAL/TIMES models.  

As part of the COMET project, this thesis presents the quantitative and qualitative input data needed to 

model the energy system of Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. The input data includes, among others: 

energy conversion, consumption and CO2 emissions trends of the energy sector and other industrial 

activities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the 

energy end-use sectors; an estimation of the domestic energy related resources; and an assessment of 

relevant energy policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of these 

policies within the energy sector.

Resumo 

As fontes de energia renovável não são, e não serão, num futuro próximo, suficientes para suprir as 

necessidades globais de energia e por isso os combustíveis fosseis irão continuar a ser utilizados em 

larga escala. De facto, o contínuo consumo dos recursos fósseis e, em particular, do carvão, para a 

geração de electricidade será necessário para sustentar o crescimento económico e populacional. Para 

fazer face às alterações climáticas, as tecnologias de captura e armazenamento de CO2, apresentam-se 

como uma opção para reduzir significativamente as emissões de CO2 para a atmosfera, associadas ao 

sistema electro-produtor e a outros processos industriais. 

Esta dissertação foi desenvolvida no âmbito do projecto COMET, financiado pelo Sétimo Programa-

Quadro. O objectivo do projecto COMET é estudar a viabilidade técnico-económica da integração de 

uma estrutura de transporte e armazenamento de CO2 na zona oeste do Mediterrâneo. Este projecto 

coordenado por Portugal, Espanha e Marrocos considera vários cenários dos sistemas energéticos 

destes países para o período 2010-2050. Estes cenários incluem a localização e desenvolvimento das 

pricipais unidades emissoras de CO2 e o potencial de armazenamento geológico nos países envolvidos. 

Os cenários dos sistemas energéticos dos três países serão modelados recorrendo aos modelos 

MARKAL/TIMES.   

Como parte integrante do projecto COMET, este trabalho apresenta a informação quantitativa e 

qualitativa para modelar o sistema energético de Marrocos via MARKAL/TIMES. Esta informação 

inclui: dados relativos à transformação, consumo e emissões de CO2 associadas ao sector enérgico e 

industrial; a identificação da capacidade instalada e perspectivas futuras; uma análise dos sectores 

consumidores finais de energia; uma estimativa dos recursos energéticos domésticos; e um 

levantamento das políticas relacionadas com o sector energético, uma vez que os modelos 

MARKAL/TIMES têm a capacidade de avaliar o impacto dessas políticas nesse sector. Esta 

dissertação apresenta também alguns dos resultados obtidos através da modelação e uma análise dos 

mesmos.

the techno-economic feasibility of integrating carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructures in 

the West Mediterranean area and it involves Portugal, Spain and Morocco. This project considers 

several development scenarios for those countries energy systems within the time period 2010-2050 

and takes into account the location and development of the energy related and industrial major CO2 

emission sources as well as the available potential for geological storage in those countries. These 

countries long-term energy systems scenarios are to be modelled and evaluated through the technical 

economic models MARKAL/TIMES.  

As part of COMET project this thesis presents the quantitative and qualitative input data to model the 

energy system of Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. The input data includes, among others: energy 

transformation, consumption and CO2 emissions? trends of the energy sector and other industrial 

activities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the 

energy end-use sectors; an estimation of the national energy resources; and an assessment of relevant 

energy related policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of policies 

within the energy sector. This thesis includes an analysis of the first modelling outcomes. 

The present work is divided in nine chapters. Chapter two summarizes the past and present status of 

the Energy Sector in a global perspective. It introduces the problematic of energy related GHG 

emissions and climate change and includes IEA energy scenarios for the next decades. The potential 

and main characteristics of the key climate change mitigation options are also reviewed in this chapter. 

Chapter three overviews the CCS technologies process chain within its different options and 

applications. It summarizes the current status of the technologies in terms of projects, costs and 

regulatory and legal framework in a general approach. The fourth chapter presents the goals and 

motivations of COMET project, its structure and the thesis?s role within the project itself. The fifth 

chapter presents the quantitative and qualitative information collected to model the energy system of 

Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. Chapter six presents the final remarks. Chapter seven presents the 

conclusions of the thesis. Chapter eight identifies future work.

2 Global Energy Demand and Energy-related CO2 Emissions 

2.1  Energy Demand and Supply  

Global energy demand has been steadily rising over the past several decades. Population and income 

growth are key driving forces behind the demand for energy (IEA, 2010). As the global energy 

demand upward trend is expected to continue in the coming decades, increasing uneasiness over 

energy security and environmental sustainability issues arise.  

In 1971 the total primary energy supply (TPES) has been of 5533.5 Mtoe and, by 2008, it reached 

12267.4 Mtoe, which means that within that period the TPES more than doubled (IEA 2010). Figure 

2-1 presents the global population, real GDP using purchasing power parities (ppp) and TPES 

evolution within 1971 and 2008.

The global energy intensity - the amount of energy necessary to generate each unit of GDP - has 

decreased progressively over the last decades owing to several factors such as energy efficiency (EE) 

improvements, fuel switching and structural adjustments in the global economy away from energy-

intensive industries (IEA, 2010b). If no improvements in energy intensity had been accomplished, 

global energy consumption would be much higher today (IEA, 2010b).  

In 1980 and 2008 almost 85% and 81% of the global energy demand was supplied from fossil fuels. 

Table 2-1 presents the world primary energy demand by fuel in 1980 and 2008 (IEA, 2010b).

In 2009 the global economic recession induced the first energy consumption decline since 1982 which 

was mostly felt in OECD countries and in the territory of the Former Soviet Union, in line with its

economies condition. In that year global oil consumption dropped 1.7%, representing the major 

decline since 1982. Coal consumption kept on fairly solid in 2009 representative of the minor annual 

change since 1999. In 2009 natural gas consumption registered the most rapid decline amongst fossil 

fuels and fell by 2.1%. In that year only hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy registered 

an output growth. Hydroelectric generation has been the world?s fastest-growing energy source in 

2009. Fiscal incentive, in many countries, among other government encouragement measures, induced 

the global wind and solar generation capacity growth by 31% and 47% respectively. China and the US 

accounted for 62.4% of the whole wind generation growth (BP, 2010).  

In 2010 driven by the economic recovery, global energy consumption grew by 5.6% which 

represented the largest increase in percentage terms since 1973. The growth in energy consumption 

has been felt worldwide: consumption in OECD countries grew by 3.5% and in non-OECD countries 

the energy consumption increased by 7.5% and was 63% beyond the 2000 totals. In that year, China 

energy consumption increased by 11.2% and became the world?s largest energy consumer followed by 

the US (BP, 2011).  

Energy prices development diverged. Oil prices rebounded worldwide (average oil prices for that year 

as a whole have been the 2
nd

 highest in history), whereas natural gas and coal prices varied by region. 

Natural gas prices increased significantly in markets indexed to oil prices. Coal prices increased 

strongly in Europe but remained weak in Japan and North America (BP, 2011). 

Accounting for 33.6% of global energy consumption, oil continued the world?s most consumed fuel. 

After two succeeding years declining, global oil consumption increased 3.1% (reaching a record level 

of 87.4 million b/d). OECD consumption grew by 0.9%, the first grow after 2005. Beyond OECD, 

consumption evolution recorded a 5.5% growth. Growth persisted strong in China and Middle Eastern 

countries, with Chinese consumption rising by 10.4%. Even if 2010 has recorded the biggest 

percentage grow in oil consumption since 2004, it represents a minor global growth rate amongst 

fossil fuels (BP, 2011). 

In 2010 coal accounted for 29.6% of global energy consumption and its consumption increased 7.6%, 

which represents the major overall growth since 2003. China accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 

global consumption growth. The coal consumption upsurge was also strong in OECD countries where 

consumption grew by 5.2%, the most solid growth since 1979 (BP, 2011).    

The global natural gas consumption increased by 7.4% in 2010, which represents the fastest growth 

since 1984. Except in the Middle East, consumption growth was beyond average in all regions. The 

US had the world?s largest rise in consumption in volumetric terms, growing by 5.6%. Russia and 

China both registered the largest volumetric increases in the country?s history. Consumption in other 

Asian countries grew fast as well (10.7%), with India increasing its consumption by 21.5% (BP, 

2011). 

Worldwide, hydroelectric and nuclear production registered the biggest upsurge since 2004. 

Hydroelectric output increased by 5.3%. China was responsible for more than 60% of global 

hydroelectric growth owing to new capacity and wet weather. Global nuclear production increased by 

2% with three-quarters of the growth coming from OECD economies. French nuclear production 

increased by 4.4%, which represented the major volumetric increase in the world. Globally, other 

renewable energy (RE) sources continued to grow rapidly. Biofuel production increased by 13.8% in 

that year and RE for power generation increased by 15.5%, owing to a steady growth in wind energy 

(22.7%) (BP, 2011). 

2.1.1 Energy-related CO2 Emissions  

In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its Second Assessment Report, 

concluded that there is a balance of evidence that suggests a discernible human influence on climate 

change (IPCC, 1995). Indeed, even if GHG such as CO2, CH4, and N2O are constantly being emitted 

to the atmosphere through natural processes, over the last 250 years anthropogenic activities related 

emissions have significantly altered their atmospheric concentrations.  



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    5 

 

The CO2 atmospheric concentration has risen from 280 ppm in the pre-industrial period to 390 ppm by 

the end of 2010 (IPCC, 2011).  One other noteworthy fact is that atmospheric CO2 concentration has 

increased by just 20 ppm over the 8000 proceeding years to industrialization whereas, since 1750, it 

has risen by more than 100 ppm. CO2 is one of the most prevalent GHG, and within the latter GHG 

specified, CO2 presents the highest radiative forcing (RF
1
) (IPCC, 2005).   

Among the many human activities that emit CO2, the energy sector represents by far the largest source 

of emissions and fossil-fuel combustion is a central issue within the climate change debate. Besides 

fossil-fuel combustion within the power and the transport sectors, there are several other processes that 

emit substantial quantities of CO2. These, among others, include the following industrial intensive 

processes: cement, iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, pulp and paper and aluminum 

manufacture (IEA, 2011h). Changes in land use and forestry practices may, as well, release significant 

amounts of CO2 or act as a sink for CO2.  

Between 1971 and 2008, global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion more than doubled, rising from 

14096.3 to 29381.4 million ton. In 2008, global CO2 emissions increased 0.4 Gt representing a growth 

rate of 1.5% comparatively to 2007 (IEA, 2010). In 2008, for the first time, the CO2 emission levels of 

the Annex I countries dropped below 1990 levels and the aggregate emissions of the developing 

countries has been superior to those from the developed countries (IEA, 2010). 

- Global Energy Related CO2 Emissions by Fuel 

Coal - the utmost carbon-intensive of fossil fuels with nearly twice the carbon content per unit of 

energy as that of natural gas - has been, during the last decade, the fastest-growing energy source and 

the rate of emissions from coal use has risen from 0.6% per year within 1990 and 2000 and 4.8% per 

year within 2000 and 2007 (IEA, 2010b1) (IEA, 2011). Figure 2-2 presents the global CO2 emissions 

by fuel, within 1971 and 2008. 

 
Figure 2-2 – Global CO2 emissions by fuel (IEA, 2010) 

This CO2 coal related emissions upsurge over a relatively short period can be explained by the 

growing energy demand in coal based economies and by the intensification of coal-fired power 

generation in response to higher oil and gas prices (IEA, 2010b1). In 2010, 44% of the estimated CO2 

emissions came from coal, 36% from oil and 20% from natural gas (IEA, 2011k).

The environmental concerns related to the use of coal comprise not only the associated CO2 emissions 

and the implications of those for Climate Change but, among others: the emission of other gases and 

particulates produced within the combustion process such as NOx, SO2 and toxic trace elements and 

the disposal of ash and spoil from processes associated with the mining of coal in the air, water and 

land.  

- Energy Related CO2 Emissions by Sector 

In 2008, within the energy system, the power and heat generation sector was categorically the major 

producer of CO2 emissions, being responsible for 41% of the CO2 emissions (Figure 2-4). In that year 

the electricity generation sector emitted 11 Gt of CO2. In 2008, the combined share of the power and 

heat generation and the transport sectors accounted for two-thirds of the CO2 emissions. The transport 

and the manufacturing industries and constructions sectors accounted for 23% and 20% respectively of 

the CO2 emissions in 2008 (IEA, 2010). Figure 2-3 presents the increasing share of the electricity and 

heat sectors on total energy related CO2 emissions.  

 
Figure 2-3 – CO2 emissions by sector (IEA, 2010) 

Generally, the power generation sector relies deeply on coal (IEA, 2010) (IEA, 2010b). Coal is crucial 

for global energy security, it is abundantly available, with sufficient supplies for more than 150 years, 

affordable, reliable and, easy and safe to transport (IEA, 2010b) (IEA, 2011a). In 1990 the global 

share of coal for power generation has been approximately 37%. In 2008, 41% of the global power 

generation came from coal, 21% from gas, 16% from hydro and 14% from nuclear (Table 2-2) (IEA, 

2010b). Countries such as Australia, China, India, Poland and South Africa generate between 69% and 

94% of their electricity and heat through coal combustion (IEA, 2010). Table 2-2 presents the global 

electricity generation by source in 1990 and 2008.

By 2008 almost two-thirds of the global coal demand was for power sector consumption and another 

one-fifth for industrial sector use (IEA, 2010b).  Since 1990 the share of coal in the power sector has 

grown by 10 percentage points while the share in industrial energy use has declined slightly (IEA, 

2010b).  

Decreasing CO2 emissions from coal-fired plants is a central concern within multiple proposals for 

mitigating GHG emissions. Options include capturing and sequestering the CO2 emitted from the coal 

plants, and increasing substituting coal-fired generation for other power sources such as wind or 

nuclear power. Another option is to replace coal power with increased use of natural gas generation 

since gas fired power using modern generating technology releases less than half of the CO2 per MWh 

as of a coal-fired power plant (CRS, 2010).  In fact, a typical 500 MW coal-fired power plant will emit 

around 400 tonnes of CO2/h, whereas a modern natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plant of the 

same size will emit about 180 tonnes of CO2/h in the flue gases (CSFL, 2010). 

2.1.2 Energy-related Past Trends Problematic  

Even if in the past decade: 

- There has been a substantial rise in investment in RE worldwide; solar PV and wind power 
have achieved considerable deployment; 

- The rate of EE development in OECD countries has begun to speed up again, after many years 
of modest gains; 

- Major car companies were adding hybrid and full?electric vehicles to their product lines and 
many governments had launched plans to encourage consumers to buy these vehicles; and 

- Public investment for RD&amp;amp;D in low?carbon technology reached an all?time high in 2009 
(2011, IEA); 

in 2010, according to the IEA, the energy-related CO2 emissions reached the highest level in history 

and the present energy use and CO2 emissions trends run directly counter to the constant warnings sent 
by the United Nations IPCC (IEA, 2011k) (IEA, 2010b1).  

2.2 Global Energy Scenarios and Climate Change 

The increasing demand of energy is considered a global multifaceted issue with ever rising 

complexity. It involves not just the question of whether the expected rise in energy demand can be 

met, but also whether this demand can be met sustainably, which mix of energy sources is optimal, 

and whether there may also be means to reduce demand without compromising the global economy.  

The IPCC stated that only scenarios resulting in a 50% to 80% reduction of global CO2 emissions by 

2050, compared to 2000 levels, can limit the long-term global mean temperature rise within 2.0ºC to 

2.4ºC. 

In December 2009 heads of state met for the 15
th

 Conference of Parties of the United Nations 

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen. The resulting Copenhagen 

Accord, to which all major emitting countries and many others associated themselves, established a 

non-binding goal of restraining the long-term average increase in the global temperature to 2ºC above 

pre-industrial levels. Major emerging-market and developing countries undertook abatement pledges 

http://www.iea.org/index.asp

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    8 

 

for the first time. The 2ºC goal has been further recognized as critical in the United Nations Climate 

Change Conference, held in Cancun, in 2010. 

Even if the GHG in the atmosphere long-term stabilisation at 450 ppm by no means guarantees that the 

temperature increase will be limited to 2°C, targeting a 450 ppm of CO2 equivalent concentration is 

often acknowledged as equivalent to the 2°C objective.  

For strategic analysis and long-term planning many energy scenarios are continually being reported by 

either national or international organizations such as the IEA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), 

the European Commission and the World Energy Council (WEC). All these organizations state that in 

the time frame of 2020-2030, worldwide energy demand will rise, keeping pace with population and 

economic growth in developing countries.   

- IEA Scenarios 

The 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), published by the IEA, provides energy 

demand and supply, updated projections until 2030 through three scenarios based on several different 

assumptions.  

Its central scenario, entitled the New Policies Scenario (NPS), takes into account the general policy 

strategies and commitments that have been announced by numerous countries worldwide, in order to 

restrict the greenhouse effect and address energy security concerns, even where the measures to 

implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. The potential impacts of the 

implementation of those policy commitments on energy markets can be weighed, by comparing them 

with the projections from the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) in which no change in policies as of 

mid-2010 is assumed to be implemented. The third scenario, the 450 Scenario, sets out an energy 

pathway consistent with the target agreed at the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen in December 

2009 to limit the increase in global temperature to 2ºC above pre-industrial levels. This scenario 

assumes the implementation of the high-end of national pledges and tougher policies after 2020 

including the nearly entire elimination of fossil fuel consumption subsidies (globally) to achieve the 

objective of limiting the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million of CO2 

equivalent (IEA, 2010b). 

All three IEA scenarios have the same assumptions about population growth. Global population is 

projected to grow from an estimated 6.7 billion in 2008 to around 8.5 billion in 2030 – an average rate 

of increase of nearly 1% per year. Most of the increase in global population will occur in non-OECD 

countries, particularly in Asia and Africa. In fact, these countries population is estimated to increase 

from 5.5 billion in 2008 to 7.2 billion in 2035 corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 1%. 

In the OECD countries, most of the population growth is expected in North America. Projections 

suggest that the OECD population will increase by  0.4% annually, between 2008 and 2035 (IEA, 

2010b).  

All three IEA scenarios have the same assumptions regarding economic growth as well. The three 

scenarios projections are extremely sensitive to the GDP growth rate estimations since energy demand 

tends to rise in line with GDP, yet usually at a lower rate (IEA, 2010b). The 2010 edition of the WEO 

assumes that within the 2008-2035 time period the world economy grows on average by 4.4% per 

year. OECD countries GDP annual growth is expected to reach 1.8% and non-OECD countries GDP is 

expected to grow by 4.6% per year over the same projection period.  

 

- Global Energy Demand  

For the 2008 to 2035 period the energy demand projections from the three WEO 2010 scenarios differ 

considerably. In the NPS global energy demand is projected to increase by 1.2% annually reaching 

16750 Mtoe by 2035. In the CPS, global energy demand is estimated to increase on a higher rate, by 

1.4% per year, reaching 18048 Mtoe by 2035. At a comparatively lower rate, in the 450 Scenario, the 

global energy demand grows by 1.7% annually reaching 14920 Mtoe by 2035 (Figure 2-6) (Energy 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage

prices warrant that projected supply and demand are in balance during the Outlook period in all 

scenarios) (IEA, 2010b). 

 
Figure 2-4 – World primary energy demand by scenario (IEA, 2010b) 

The policies that are assumed to be brought together in the NPS and 450 Scenario have a noteworthy 

impact on the energy intensity rate decline over the projection period. In the CPS, the energy intensity 

declines as well, but at an inferior rate. Compared to 2008, by 2035 the energy intensity declines 28% 

in the CPS, 34% in the NPS and 41% in the 450 Scenario (IEA, 2010b). 

By 2035 in all three scenarios, fossil fuels keep on being the dominant primary energy sources altough 

their share on the overall primary fuel mix differs significantly. By 2035 the fossil fuels share 

projections from the NPS, the CPS and the 450 Scenario are 74%, 79% and 62% respectively. The 

renewables and nuclear share projections are considerably higher in the 450 Scenario (Table 2-3) 

(IEA, 2010b).

- Energy-related CO2 Emissions 

According to the IEA, in order to embark into a trajectory that is compatible with the long-term 

stabilisation of the atmospheric concentration at 450 ppm CO2-eq, energy-related emissions need to 

fall to 21.7 Gt CO2 by 2035 (IEA, 2010b).    

Energy Related CO2 Emissions in the NPS 

Under the assumptions of the NPS, energy related emissions in the OECD countries peak before 2015 

and decay to 11.8 Gt in 2020, 7% above 1990 levels. Supposing  that OECD countries intensify 

domestic reduction efforts after 2020, OECD emissions gradually decline to 10 Gt in 2035. In non-



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    10 

 

OECD countries, energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to jump from 15.7 Gt in 2008 to 20.8 Gt 

by 2020 and 24 Gt by 2035 (IEA, 2010b).   

In 2008, coal has been responsible for the largest share on total CO2 emissions, followed by oil and 

gas. In the NPS this order remains identical by 2035. Still, the share of coal decreases to 41% and that 

of oil to 36%, while the share of gas extends to 24%. In 2008 emissions from bunker fuels accounted 

for 3.5% and by 2035 its share increases to 4.0% (IEA, 2010b). 

Even though the projection for GHG emissions in the NPS represents a clear improvement on current 

trends (emissions in the CPS reach 35.4 Gt in 2020 and continue to increase across the projected 

period), between 2008 and 2035, global energy related CO2 emissions increase by 21%, from 29.3 Gt 

to 35.4 Gt precluding the 450 ppm CO2 eq target. The NPS places the world in a path consistent with 

stabilising the concentration of GHG at just over 650 ppm CO2-eq, resulting in an estimated 

temperature rise of over 3.5ºC above pre-industrial levels in the long term (IEA, 2010b). 

Energy Related CO2 Emissions in the 450 Scenario 

The 450 Scenario sets a path consistent with the long-term stabilisation of the atmospheric 

concentration at 450 ppm of CO2 equivalent (emissions in the 450 Scenario reach 31.9 Gt in 2020 and 

decline to 21.7 Gt in 3035). The GHG atmospheric concentration in the 450 Scenario reaches a highest 

at some 520 ppm CO2-eq around 2040 before declining back to 450 ppm CO2-eq by around 2150. This 

scenario points out the most economical way of meeting the climate goals, presenting, given the 

current policy context, the scale of action required to do so (IEA, 2010b).   

In order to decarbonise the energy economy so drastically, the commitment of all countries to impose 

tougher supplementary and complementary abatement policies and measures as of 2020 is mandatory 
(IEA, 2010b).   

The elimination and reduction of subsidies on fossil fuels accounts for 1.4 Gt of CO2 emissions 

avoidances in 2035 compared with the CPS. Substantial spending on energy efficiency and low-

carbon technologies in order to achieve the 450 Scenario is required, and further spending in the 2010-

2035 period extends to $18 trillion compared with the CPS and $13.5 trillion compared with the NPS 

(IEA, 2010b).   

- Global energy related CO2 emission savings by policy measure – IEA 450 Scenario  

Atmospheric emissions avoidances in the 450 Scenario, comparatively to the CPS, amount to 3.5 Gt in 

2020 and to 20.9 Gt in 2035. The IEA identifies the most cost-effective portfolio of technologies to 

attain the latter emission reductions targets. The share of the different measures to be taken in pursuit 

of the 450 Scenario abatement commitments varies over time. Once low-cost options are exhausted, 

other expensive options have to be applied (Figure 2-7) (IEA, 2010b).

Figure 2-5 – World energy-related CO2 emissions savings by policy measure in the 450 Scenario 

(IEA, 2010b) 

Under the assumptions of the IEA 450 Scenario, the end-use efficiency share on the total CO2 
abatement compared to the CPS is 67% by 2020 (when total abetment is of 3.5 Gt CO2). Whereas, by 

2035, at the time when total CO2 abatement target amounts to 20.9 Gt (in relation to the CPS), the CO2 

abatement share of the end-use efficiency decreases to 47%. The CO2 price plays a critical role in EE 

developments (IEA, 2010b).   

As long as support policies that go beyond the impact of the price of CO2 are established, RE 

deployment together with biofuels, account for a rising share of CO2 savings throughout the projection 

timeframe, increasing from 19% in 2020 to 24% in 2035. Nuclear power share on CO2 abatement by 

the end of the projection period amounts to 8% (IEA, 2010b).   

Within the projection period CCS becomes a critical abatement technology and by 2035 it accounts for 

nearly one-fifth of the total CO2 abatement target. In this scenario, CCS is deployed in new coal and 

gas-fired power plants after 2020 in OECD+

 and Other Major Economies

 and is broadly used as a 

retrofit measure as well. CCS also becomes a fundamental abatement alternative in some emissions 

intensive industrial sectors, such as cement, iron and steel, chemicals, and pulp and paper, as well as in 

energy transformation processes such as coal-to-liquids (IEA, 2010b). 

According to the IEA, decarbonizing the power sector is of crucial importance to make deep cuts on 

CO2 emissions and even though fossil fuels keep on being the dominant fuels on the primary energy 

mix in the 450 Scenario, the power sector is considerably decarbonised by 2035, especially in 

developed countries, and over three-quarters of global electricity generation is low-carbon (IEA, 

2010b).  This low carbon target entails an intensive low-carbon technologies deployment in order to 
displace inefficient thermal plants, and to meet the growth in electricity demand, while keeping an 

affordable and secure service to consumers (Table 2-4) (IEA, 2010b).

- CCS deployment – 450 Scenario Requirements 

By 2030, in comparison with the 450 Scenario published within the 2009 WEO, CCS in the 2010 IEA 

450 Scenario plays a further significant role in emission reduction (to the extent of 1.2 Gt more). In the 

latter Scenario, CCS retrofit plays a larger role, particularly in China and the United States (IEA, 

2010b). This degree of CCS deployment involves a supplementary investement of $1.3 trillion of that 

within the  CPS in the 2010 to 2035 period, representing nearly 8% of the total investment required to 

achieve the 450 Scenario path. A large number of CCS projects take place in OECD+ countries, as the 

price of CO2 in the power and industry sectors certifies it as feasible options subsequently to a period 

between 2010 and 2020 in which government investments to fund CCS demonstration projects amount 

to an average annual of $3.5 to $4 billion (IEA, 2010b).   

Shortly after 2020, subsequently the introduction of a CO2 price, CCS deployment extents to Other 

Major Economies as well. By 2035, in OECD+, CCS technologies account for 25% of abatement or 

1.6 Gt of CO2 and in Other Major Economies accounts for 21% of abatement or 2 Gt of CO2 (IEA, 

2010b). 

In order to achive this sum of abatement, extended international co-operation and financing for CCS 

demonstration in developing countries is necessary, possibly through the Clean Development 

Mechanism (CDM) or an alternative financing mechanism generating offset credits. The 

implementation of legal and regulatory frameworks and systematic mapping of storage sites is also 

necessary (IEA, 2010b).  

The benefits and main characteristics of EE, RES and Nuclear energy are briefly overviewed within 

the following section. In the succeeding chapter, CCS technologies will be discussed in further detail 

in the context of the dissertation.  

2.3 Energy Efficiency  

Benefits of Energy Efficiency 

Energy Efficiency (EE) was first considered by some surveyed companies as early as 1970 and the 

average date for setting EE targets was 1998 (Hoffman, A.J., 2007). The history of EE is intimately 

bound up with the notions of progress, growth and power. Indeed, there is a continuous race between 

EE and economic growth. If the latter is faster than the rate of EE increase, then total energy 

consumption increases, as it has been historically (Boyle G., 2003).   

EE improvement is recognised by the International Community as an essential cost-effective 

requirement to address energy sustainability concerns and to serve multiple proposes, such as: 

- Enhance energy security (reduce domestic demand and imported energy to maximize exports, 
increase reliability and control energy demand growth); 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    13 

 

- Boost economic development and competitiveness (reduce energy intensity, improve 
industrial competitiveness, reduce production costs and achieve more affordable energy 

customer costs); 

- Reduce climate change (contribute to global mitigation and adaption efforts, meet 
international obligations under the UNFCCC); 

- Improve public health (reduce indoor and local pollution) (IEA, 2010c). 

Even if the global energy intensity has improved, at an average rate of 1.7% per year, since the early 

1970s, this enhancement must be measured against overall increases in energy consumption and CO2 

emissions resulting from population and economic growth (IEA, 2011). 

EE improvements can be pursued in all conversion and end-use processes in the energy system and EE 

can and should be enhanced worldwide, within all the different sectors ( IEA, 2011).  

Energy Efficiency opportunities by Sector  

Decarbonizing the power and heat sector is critical in order to achieve deep CO2 emissions cuts and 

one of the most important near-term approaches for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil-fired power 

generation is to improve the efficiency of new and existing plants. There are several solutions for 

maximizing EE within the power and heat generation sector, for instance, through the adoption of the 

best available technologies and the upgrading or replacement of older inefficient plants. This, along 

with EE improvements within power transmission and distribution would result in important fossil 

fuel savings and CO2 emissions reduction and consequently increase the sustainability of the overall 

energy sector.  

Pursuing EE improvements within residential, commercial and public-service buildings is also an issue 

of major importance since buildings account for close to 40% of energy used in most countries (IEA 

site). The energy use in this sector includes space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, 

appliances and cooking and business equipment (IEA, 2010b). Presently, space heating and cooling as 

well as hot water are estimated to account for approximately half of global energy consumption in 

buildings (IEA, 2011d). The largest technical potential for energy savings in residential, commercial 

and public-service buildings consists on EE building design, implemented together with efficient 

heating and cooling systems/equipment. For users and owners of buildings in general, EE measures 

are most often feasible, as savings pay for the additional investment costs over time. Within OECD 

and economies in transition, the low retirement rate of buildings and the relatively modest extension, 

implies that most of the energy savings potential involves retrofitting and purchasing new technologies 

for the prevailing building stock. In developing countries instead, where the construction expansion of 

new building is expected, opportunities exist to secure significant energy savings through improved 

EE standards for new buildings (IEA, 2010d).   

As regards the industrial sector, it has achieved considerable EE improvements in the last decades, but 

this progress pales beside the increased industrial production worldwide (IEA, 2010d). In fact, this 

sector is currently responsible for about one third of all the energy used worldwide and for almost 40% 

of global CO2 emissions. Therefore, reducing the CO2 intensity of the most widely produced 

commodities such as cement, iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, paper and paperboard and 

aluminium by decoupling energy consumption from output via enhancing EE within the industrial 

facilities and processes, and moving to best available technologies is necessary to reduce 

environmental problems (IEA, 2011e). 

As to the transport sector, it is the second-largest CO2 emitter followed by industry and buildings 

(IEA, 2010b) and the highest energy final consumer and it is forecasted to remain so if no EE 

improvements and additional measures are pursued. Accomplishing deep cuts in CO2 emissions in this 

sector will hinge on decelerating the increase in fuel transport use, by greater EE improvements and 

raising the share of low-carbon fuels (IEA, 2010d). In 2008 the IEA published EE recommendations 

for the transport sector. These have focused on road transport and policies on improving EE of tires, 

fuel economy standards for both light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles, and eco-driving. Fiscal 

measures were not incorporated in the current IEA transport EE recommendations. However, financial

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    14 

 

incentives or penalties would promote the purchase of more EE vehicles and therefore accelerate the 

deployment of EE technologies.  

Barriers to Energy Efficiency further deployment 

Abundant cost-effective EE potential is considered to be unexploited and EE can and should be 

enhanced across all sectors. Still, many EE projects with strong financial rates of returns remain 

unimplemented worldwide, but principally in developing and emerging countries. Indeed, despite the 

potential benefits, realizing EE improvements can be blocked by the following barriers: 

- Market: market organisation and price distortions impede customers from appraising the true 
value of EE; split incentive problems created when investors cannot capture the benefits of 

improved efficiency; transaction costs (projections development costs are high relative to 

energy savings); 

- Financial: up-front costs and dispersed benefits discourage investors; perception of EE 
investments as complex and risky, with high transaction costs; lack of awareness of financial 

benefits on the part of financial institutions; 

- Information and awareness: lack of necessary information and understanding, on the 
consumers side, to make rational consumption and investment decisions); 

- Regulatory and institutional: energy tariffs that discourage EE investment; incentive structures 
encourage energy providers to sell energy rather than invest in cost-effective EE, institutional 

bias towards supply-side investments; 

- Technical: privation of affordable EE technologies suitable to local conditions; unsatisfactory 
capacity to identify, develop, implement and maintain EE investments (IEA, 2010c). 

Policies to support Energy Efficiency 

In order to address the previously mentioned barriers to EE development, several governments at all 

levels have, over the years, introduced different policies, such as: 

- Pricing mechanisms: variable tariffs where higher consumption levels invoke higher unit 
prices; 

- Regulatory and control mechanisms: compulsory activities, such as energy audits and energy 
management, minimum energy performance standards, energy consumption reduction targets, 

EE investment obligations on private companies; 

- Fiscal measures and tax incentives: grants, subsidies and tax incentives for EE investments, 
direct procurement of EE goods and services; 

- Promotional and market transformation mechanisms: public information campaigns and 
promotions, inclusion of EE in school curricula, appliance labelling and building certification; 

- Technology development: development and demonstration of EE technologies; 

- Commercial development and capacity building: creation of energy service companies, 
training programmes, development of EE industry; 

- Financial remediation: revolving funds for EE investments, project preparation facilities, 
contingent financing facilities (IEA, 2010c). 

 

 

2.4 Renewable Energy 

Benefits of Renewable Energy 

The Renewable Energy (RE) potential is wide and can supply a large portion of energy demand. RE 

sources derive directly or indirectly from natural processes connected to sunlight, heat stored in the 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    15 

 

earth or gravitional forces and are continuously, naturally replenished (IEA, 2011f). The array of 

benefits arising from the greater development and deployment of RE - within a portfolio of low-

carbon and cost-competitive energy technologies capable of responding to the emerging major 

challenges of climate change, energy security, and access to energy - is well acknowledged and it has 

become a priority for both governments of IEA member countries and emerging economies. Indeed, 

more than 70 governments around the world, including all IEA members, have already introduced 

targets and policies to support the deployment of RE technologies (IEA, 2011g).  

Overview of the main RES characteristics  

Solar  

Solar energy is categorically the most abundant energy resource available on earth. At the time there 

are three main technologies to harness the solar energy: solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating 

solar power (CSP) to provide electricity, and solar thermal collectors for heating and cooling (IEA, 

2010b). 

PV systems are commercially available technologies that transform direct and diffused solar radiation 

into electricity, by means of a photovoltaic process, using semi-conductor devices. PV systems can be 

deployed anywhere in the world on apposite land and on houses. PV technology is very modular and 

can be installed close to centres of demand. These technologies are, as well proper for off-grid 

electrification. As solar PV is a variable source of power, its integration into the grid may be 

challenging for system operators where it is used on a large scale. Conversely, peak production takes 

place during the day, usually matching, in hot regions, with peak electricity demand, often driven by 

air conditioning loads (IEA, 2010b).  

CSP is a proven technology that produces high-temperature heat for electricity generation or for co-

generation of electricity and heat. CSP systems are only able to convert direct normal irradiation. 

Therefore, suitable areas for CSP deployment are those with strong sunshine and clear skies, 

frequently arid or semi-arid areas. CSP technology opens up the prospect of thermal energy storage 

and hybrid designs, for instance, with natural gas co-firing. If equipped with adequate storage 

capacity, CSP systems could provide base-load power (IEA, 2010b).  

Solar thermal collectors produce heat from solar radiation, by heating a fluid that circulates through a 

collector. Similar to PV panels, these systems are able to convert both direct and diffuse light and for 

that reason can be installed anywhere in the world. The collectors produce comparatively low 

temperature heat, apposite for space heating and hot water production in buildings and some lower 

temperature industrial applications. Since solar thermal heat is not always available when needed, 

solar thermal collectors are relatively inapt to replace other sources of heat, at least until inter-seasonal 

storage becomes affordable. The potential of these technologies for industrial proposes is almost 

unexploited for the moment (IEA, 2010b). 

Wind power   

The kinetic energy of wind is converted in wind turbines into electricity. Suitable wind speeds for 

electricity generation (from 4 m/s to 25 m/s) are virtually attainable all over the world, with the 

exception of certain equatorial areas. Wind power is converted onshore and off-shore, where typically 

wind speeds are higher and the wind is available for longer periods of time. The distance from centres 

of demand onshore and water depth are key aspects for the deployment of these technologies off-

shore. Similar to solar, wind is a variable source of power and the output increases and drops as wind 

strength fluctuates. Therefore, integrating wind power into grids, particularly once wind becomes a 

major component of the total system, is challenging (IEA, 2010b). 

 

Hydropower 

Hydropower uses the potential energy of water and converts it into electricity, either in run-of-river 

plants or reservoirs. Hydropower is the most mature renewable energy technology and can be explored 

almost all over world. In the OECD countries the most suitable areas, particularly for large hydro, 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    16 

 

have been explored by now, but there is still potential for small-scale developments unexploited. 

Significant potential for hydro generation still exists in Asia, Latin America and Africa.   

Some hydro plants can be operated as base load, while others serve as peaking plants, depending on 

the volume of the reservoirs and the electrical capacity of the dam relative to the total system; 

hydropower plants can be operated flexibly, particularly where pumped storage is available, and hence 

are capable to supply sudden fluctuations in power demand (IEA, 2010b).  

Biomass 

Biomass energy is produced from any organic material, of plant and animal origin, derived from 

agriculture and forestry production and resulting by-products, and industrial and urban wastes (OECD, 

2004). The type of technologies exploiting biomass resources is very varied and the selection of 

technology depends on both the final use and on the nature of the biomass feedstock (IEA, 2010b). 

The potential of this resource can be assessed, based on the land availability for dedicated crops and 

the availability forestry and agricultural residues and waste. The availability of land for crops and 

water use are major concerns of biomass exploitation (IEA, 2010b). 

Geothermal energy  

Geothermal energy is the energy available as heat contained in or discharged from the earth?s crust 

that can be exploited for power generation or for direct heat within a number of applications such as: 

space and district heating, water heating, aquaculture and industrial processes. Moderate or high 

temperatures geothermal resources are suitable for power generation. High-temperature geothermal 

resources usually exist in areas near plate boundaries or rift zones. If the temperature level is too low 

for power production, geothermal heat resources can be exploited for direct use in district heating 

systems and for some industrial and agricultural purposes, where local markets exist. Some of the 

positive features of this resource include the capability to provide base load power, the compatibility 

with both centralized and distributed energy generation; sources of low temperature geothermal heat 

exist in all over the world. The high capital cost, and the fact that exploited geothermal reservoirs 

require continuous management are some of the barriers for further exploitation of this resource (IEA, 

2010b).  

Marine power 

Marine energy technologies use the kinetic energy of tides, waves and currents of the sea, as well as 

temperature and salinity gradients, for the power generation. The technologies to exploit this resource 

are the least developed of the renewable energy technologies. This marine energy resource is, in 

principle, limitless and can be found in all world regions, but in practice it is only viable at sites close 

to demand centres and where, simultaneously, damage to local ecosystems can be controlled. Some 

marine technologies such as those that exploit tides have variable output, but on the other hand they 

are predictable (IEA, 2010b). 

RE share in the TPES  

During the last decade, the policy support for RE has increased considerably, mainly due to the 

necessity to reduce the GHG emission, to diversify the supply mix and to reduce the dependence on 

imported fossil fuels. Between 2000 and 2008 the total primary renewable energy supply grew from 

1319 Mtoe to 1590 Mtoe (IEA, 2010b).  

Biomass is currently the most exploited source of RE. In 2008 biomass use amounted to 1225 Mtoe, 

most of which was exploited in developing countries, in traditional ways by around 2.7 billion people. 

The use of modern biomass (refers to all biomass with the exception of traditional biomass, which 

refers to the biomass consumption within the residential sector in developing countries and includes 

the use of charcoal, agricultural residues and animal dung for cooling and heating) is lesser (amounted 

to 478 Mtoe in 2008), but is rapidly increasing, mainly for electricity generation and as feedstock for 

making transport fuels. Hydropower is, currently, the second largest RE source in primary energy 

demand (accounted for 276 Mtoe in 2008) and the dominant source of renewables-based electricity. 

Solar, wind, geothermal and marine power have been developing rapidly in recent years, but their total 

share within primary energy supplies is still modest (IEA, 2010b).  



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    17 

 

Electricity generation based on RE augmented by almost a third from 2000 to 2008. However, in 

absolute terms, this increase is offset by the escalation of fossil fuels based power generation (IEA, 

2010b).  

In the OECD region, electricity generation based on RE increased more than that based on coal within 

the same period, but much less than natural gas generation whereas, in non-OECD countries the 

increase in electricity generation based on RE was slightly lower than the corresponding increase from 

gas, but much lower than that from coal (IEA, 2010b).  

In 2008 RE supplied almost 3800 TWh worldwide, 19% of total electricity production. Globally, 

electricity based on RE increased by approximately 900 TWh. Even if this upsurge is mainly 

attributable to hydropower (responsible for 85% of RE based electricity in 2008), new forms of RE 

grew very quickly, particularly wind power, which expanded seven-fold. During the same period, 

solar PV electricity generation grew 16-fold. Biomass and geothermal power both increased as well, 

but at a modest pace, while marine power and CSP are just now starting to take-off (IEA, 2010b).  

As government policies to support renewables tend to focus more on electricity and transport, the 

development of RE for heat production at the point of use (and heat from district heating systems) was 

much more modest. Despite efforts to increase the access to modern fuels for underprivileged, the use 

of traditional biomass has increased since 2000 (IEA, 2010b). 

Biofuels are supplying a growing share of transport fuels and the global use of biofuels, consumed 

almost entirely within road transport, increased five-fold in the 2000 to 2008 period, reaching 1 mb/d 

and supplying almost 3% of total fuel demand in road transport. In 2009, biofuels use continued 

increase, as production capacity expanded (encouraged in most countries by government support), 

whereas oil demand for road transport decreased (for the first time since 1980) owing to higher prices 

and reduced economic activity (IEA, 2010b). 

Barriers to RE further deployment 

Despite progress, many challenges still need to be overcome in order to sustain the necessary growth 

of RE. Currently, most of the RE technologies are not able to compete with conventional ones since 

these are comparatively less capital-intensive. Therefore, it is of decisive importance to improve the 

policy framework for RE in order to bridge the competitiveness gap between RE and traditional 

alternative energy technologies. A continuous effort in research, development and deployment for RE 

technologies is also necessary to increase productivity and decrease costs (IEA, 2011f).  

The expansion of renewables raises significant system integration issues that must be taken into 

account. Some options and technologies, including smart grids, exist so as to increase the flexibility of 

electricity systems and to allow the integration of greater shares of variable renewable electricity (IEA, 

2011f).  

2.5 Nuclear Power  

The nuclear power was first demonstrated in the 1950s and in the early 1960s the first commercial 

nuclear power plants entered operation. Within the 1970s and 1980s, nuclear power capacity raised 

speedily as nations sought to decrease fossil fuel dependence, particularly after the 1970s oil crisis 

(IEA, 2010f).  

Benefits of Nuclear Power 

Nuclear power presents the potential to play an important role for decarbonizing the power sector and 

enhance energy security since it has the capability to deliver substantial amounts of very low carbon 

baseload electricity at costs stable over time (IEA, 2010e). Indeed, the indirect emissions of nuclear 

power plants are at least of an order of magnitude below the emissions of fossil fuels (NEA, 2009). 

Nuclear energy is at a very different stage of technological development and deployment than most 

other low-carbon energy options and is considered an established mature technology as a result of over 

50 years of development and operational experience. The newest projects for nuclear power plants, 

now under consideration, integrate the knowledge acquired over the years as well as the recent 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    18 

 

technological developments to enhance safety and performance (IEA, 2010f). Still, further 
development of reactor and fuel cycle technologies will be important if nuclear energy is to achieve its 

full potential. 

Barriers for Nuclear Power further deployment  

The barriers to a wider nuclear deployment in the short to medium term are predominantly policy, 

industrial and financial-related. In the long term, the potential of nuclear power will depend in 

uranium resources availability (IPCC, 2007). 

The construction of a nuclear power plant involves a large capital investment (IEA, 2010f). 

Governments aiming to increase nuclear capacity are required to provide support for financing new 

nuclear construction. When in operation a nuclear power plant entails comparatively small and 

predictable fuel, operating and maintenance costs which means that nuclear plants have low marginal 

costs of production, but require several years to recover their capital costs (IEA, 2010f). This 

intensifies the risks of electricity and carbon markets uncertainty and implies that a sustained 

government policy support is a prerequisite for a successful nuclear programme.  

The technical complexity of construction and operation of a nuclear power plant also represents a 

significant downside (IEA, 2010f). 

Even if concerns about security of energy supply and climate change have tended, in recent years to 

increase the general recognition of the benefits of nuclear energy, several factors weaken public 

support in many countries. These include concerns about nuclear safety, radioactive waste 

management and disposal, and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons.    

In the operation of nuclear power plants, safety should always be the principal consideration, not only 

in terms of technical or ageing issues, but also in terms of management system and qualified 

workforce related issues. Application of an integrated management system and structured workforce 

planning are needed throughout the plant life in order to guarantee effective plant organization and 

management. Plant operators and regulators must always make sure that plant safety is preserved and, 

where possible, enhanced during its operating lifetime. 

Nuclear power in the TPES 

In the 1990s, with the exception of Japan and Korea, nuclear growth stagnated worldwide (IEA, 

2010f). Reasons for this involved safety concerns subsequent to the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl 

accidents, delays and higher costs than expected at some nuclear plants, and a return to inferior fossil 

fuel prices (IEA, 2010f).  

Within recent years nuclear power progression has remained nearly flat with global operational 

installed capacity going from 370 GW at the end of 2005 to 375 GW by the end of 2010 (IEA, 2010f) 

(IEA, 2011). This modest growth reflects the low number of new projects construction realized during 

the past two decades. Still, most large energy consuming countries have, in recent years, at least 

considered a nuclear program to meet future energy needs.  However, the March 2011 major accident 

within the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan that resulted from a severe earthquake and 

tsunami, led many countries to review the safety of their existing and planned nuclear plants projects. 

This tragic event real impact on nuclear installed capacity development is currently uncertain (IEA, 

2011).  

Nuclear fusion  

Energy from the fusion of heavy hydrogen fuel is actively being pursued as a long-term almost 

inexhaustible, environmentally benign, supply of energy. The scientific feasibility of fusion energy 

has been proven but technical feasibility remains to be demonstrated (IPCC, 2007). Fusion scientists 

from the European Union, India, China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States are now 

proceeding with the construction of a 500MW experimental thermal power plant (IEA, 2011k).

3 CCS technologies 

As discussed in the preceding item, the degree to which CCS may contribute to the reduction of  GHG 

emissions, globally and in specific countries in the coming decades, depends on the interplay of many 

factors including the character of climate change objectives, the further development of CCS 

technology, the relative costs and benefits of alternative abatement approaches, and explicit political 

and policy choices.   

However, and as demonstrated in the previous chapter, one thing is certain: CCS technologies have the 

potential to play a crucial role in the world?s response to climate change, by decarbonizing on large 

scale the energy sector and other industrial activities. As such, together with EE and RE, CCS features 

in all of the IEA carbon abatement scenarios.  

Even if the benefits of CCS are well acknowledged, as a result of its complex nature, CCS 

technologies still face substantial technical, legal, regulatory, environmental, public acceptance, and 

economic barriers to its widespread deployment (ICF, 2010). 

CCS Process Chain 

CCS entails a number of technologies and consists of the separation of the CO2 from large point 

sources, the transportation of the CO2 to a storage location and its long-term isolation from the 

atmosphere.  

Large point sources of CO2 consist of, among others, large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, 

major CO2 emitting industries, natural gas production, synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel based H2 

production plants (IPCC, 2005).   

Depending on the process application, there are three major approaches for capturing the CO2 within 

the above mentioned facilities: post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion.  

The CO2 captured, after compression (or liquefation) may, potentially, be transported (generally via 

pipeline) for storage  in geological formations (such as oil and gas fields, unminable coal beds and 

deep saline formations
4
), in the ocean (direct release into the ocean water column or onto the deep 

seafloor), in mineral carbonates
5
, or for use in industrial processes (IPCC, 2005).   

The purpose of the following paragraphs is to provide an overview of the CCS technologies process 

chain and its possible applications.  

3.1 CO2 Capture  

The goal of CO2 capture technologies is to achieve a concentrated stream of CO2 prepared to be 

transported to a storage site. Indeed, the implementation of CO2 capture technologies, within most 

industrial activities that make use of boilers, turbines, iron and steel furnaces or cement kilns, requires 

a step to convert a relatively dilute stream of CO2 to a higher concentration so as to allow economic 

transportation and storage. In the above mentioned applications, concentrations of CO2 in exhaust gas 

streams range from around 3-20% CO2, which typically need to be concentrated to &gt;85% prior to 

compression, transport and storage.

 Saline formations are sedimentary rocks saturated with formation waters containing high concentrations of 

dissolved salts. They are widespread and contain enormous quantities of water that are unsuitable for agriculture 

or human consumption. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to increase, potential geothermal areas 

may not be suitable for CO2 storage.

 Storage of CO2 as mineral carbonates does not cover deep geological carbonation or ocean storage with 

enhanced carbonate neutralization.

CO2 capture technologies have been recurrently used in some industrial processes such as natural gas 

production, where CO2 is removed from the natural gas stream, during processing, to achieve specific 

natural gas quality standards. Similar procedures occur in plants that produce ammonia or H2 for 

process purposes (IPCC, 2005). However, within the power sector, capturing CO2 is still an emerging 

technology (not demonstrated on a commercial scale). 

As previously mentioned, there are three main technologies available for capturing the CO2 from 

power plants and other industrial facilities: 

- Post-combustion - technologies that separate the CO2 from the flue gases produced by the 
combustion of a primary fuel (coal, natural gas, oil or biomass) with air (process described in 

section 3.1.1); 

- Oxy-fuel combustion - technologies that replace air for O2 in combustion, in order to produce 
a flue gas that is mainly composed of H2O and CO2 which may be readily captured (process 

described in section 3.1.2); and 

- Pre-combustion - technologies that process the primary fuel in a reactor to produce separate 
streams of CO2 and H2 (process described in section 3.1.3) (IPCC, 2005).     

Each of the above approaches involves the separation of CO2 from a gas stream and there are five 

main methods available for doing so, depending on the CO2 (i.e. concentration, pressure, volume) to 

be captured: 

? Chemical solvent scrubbing; 

? Physical solvent scrubbing; 

? Adsorption/desorption; 

? Membrane separation; 

? Cryogenic separation (GCI, 2011). 

 

Chemical/Physical Absorption  

CO2 capture systems may be based on chemical absorption (using sovents such as MEA, 

Monoethanolamine), or on  physical absorption (using solvents such as Selexol, Dimethylether of 

polyethylene glycol) (IEA, 2004).  Once the CO2 is scrubbed from the raw gas, the saturated solution 

must be regenerated and the CO2 extracted. The bonding energy, between the solvent and CO2, 

involved in physical absorption is lower than that of chemical absorption, which is an advantage when 

it comes to regeneration. Chemical absorption processes involve a heat induced CO2 recovery, 

whereas physical absorption processes involve pressure induced CO2 recovery (IEA, 2004). Chemical 

absorption is considered a better option at low CO2 concentration because its energy use is not 

particularly sensitive at low concentrations and low partial pressures of CO2. Phsyical absorption is the 

preferred option at higher CO2 concentrations and at higher partial pressures (IEA, 2004). These 

methods are  industrially established capture techniques. 

Adsorption/desorption  

Adsorption is a physical process that involves the attachment of a gas or liquid to a solid surface. The 

regeneration of the adsorbent may be achieved by the application of heat (temperature swing 

adsorption, TSA) the reduction of pressure (pressure swing adsorption, PSA) or by a mix process of 

pressure and temperature swing adsorption (PTSA) (Wang, et al. 2010) (RECCS, 2008). Adsorbents 

which can be applied to CO2 capture include activated carbon, alumina, metallic oxides and zeolites 

(Wang, et al. 2010). Current adsorption systems may not be suitable for application in large-scale 

power plant flue gas treatment. At such scale, the low adsorption capacity of most available adsorbents 

may pose significant challenges. In addition, the flue gas streams to be treated must have high CO2 

concentrations because of the generally low selectivity of most available adsorbents (Wang, et al. 

2010).

Membrane Separation  

In a membrane based separation, selectivity is provided by the membranes themselves. Membranes 

include polymeric materials, metals or ceramics. Efficient separation demands high selectivity, a large 

membrane surface and high permeability for the desired gas components in comparison with the other 

gases in the mixture. This method is currently under development and is not yet state of the art. Today 

membranes are used for gas separation on a small scale. They are especially efficient for separating 

gases with very different sized molecules (RECCS, 2008). 

Cryogenic Distillation (Separation)  

By cooling at pressures as low as 4-5 bar, CO2 can be condensed out of gas mixtures. The gas mixture 

must be previously dried. This physical process is suitable for treating flue gas streams with high CO2 

concentrations considering the costs of refrigeration (RECCS, 2008). The procedure is energy-

intensive, particularly when the concentration of CO2 is low. But capture and compression for 

transport are accomplished in a sole stage. By now this method is used for conditioning biogas, but no 

experience has yet been gathered in the power station sector (RECCS, 2008). This technique is 

frequently associated to oxy-fuel CO2 capture processes (process described in section 3.1.2). 

Within the following section the post-combustion, oxy-fuel capture and pre-combustion techniques are 

briefly revised.  

3.1.1 Post-combustion CO2 Capture  

In this process, the CO2 is captured from a flue gas at low pressure (1 bar) and low CO2 content (3-

20%), in general (Le Thiez, P. 2005). Post-combustion capture technologies may be applied, in 

concept, to the flue gases from the combustion of all types of fuel. Still, the fuel impurities are 

decisive in the design and costing of the complete plant. The separation task is to remove CO2 from a 

mixture of mainly nitrogen and O2 (Le Thiez, P. 2005). There are several options for separating the 

CO2 from this gas mixture by post-combustion CO2 capture techniques. Nonetheless, several 

assessment comparative studies suggest that, currently, the absorption process based on chemical 

solvents is the most suitable option for post-combustion CO2 capture and absorption practices are now 

commercially available for post-combustion CO2 capture systems, although not yet on the necessary 

scale for power plant flue gases (IPCC, 2005).   

In a power plant, with an absorption-based CO2 capture process the flue gas is to be brought into 

contact with a chemical absorbent inside a scrubber column. Flue gases to the CO2 absorber must be 

cooled to improve the absorption of CO2 and minimize solvent losses due to evaporation (Wang, et al. 

2010).  

Typical absorbents that are used today are amines and carbonates. Amines are able to capture CO2 

from streams with a low CO2 partial pressure and form water soluble compounds. Thus, amine-based 

systems are able to recover CO2 from the flue gas of conventional pulverized coal (PC) fired power 

plants, however only at a significant cost and efficiency penalty (Figueroa, et al. 2007). On the other 

hand Carbonate systems are based on the capacity of a soluble carbonate to react with CO2 and form 

bicarbonate, which when heated, releases CO2 and reverts to a carbonate. An advantage of carbonates 

over amine-based systems is the significantly lower energy required for regeneration (Figueroa, et al. 

2007).  

Preceding the absorption process, other acid gases such as SO2 and NO2 need to be removed as they 

diminish the performance of the system by forming heat stable salts with solvent such as MEA. SO2 

removal is frequently attained in a Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) unit. SO2 concentrations of less 

than 10 ppm are recommended. NOx is removed by Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective 

Noncatalytic Reduction (SCNR) or low NOx burners. Particulate matter such as fly ash needs to be 

removed by electrostatic precipitators (ESP) or bag house filters otherwise they would cause foaming 

in the absorber and regenerator columns reducing their performance (Wang, et al. 2010).

After the absorption process, the absorbent and the CO2 are separated in a regeneration column (the 

CO2 loaded absorbent is heated which has the effect of both freeing the CO2 and also cleaning the 

absorbent to allow it to be re-used). The result is then a stream of pure CO2 and a second stream of 

absorbent that can be recycled to the scrubber column. By using this method, around 90% of the CO2 

is captured, with the CO2 stream having a very high purity – of around 99% (EON, 2008). 

The CO2 is then dried to remove any excess water and then it is prepared for transportation and 

eventual storage (EON, 2008).  

Although amine-based today is the most mature technology for post-combustion CO2 capture, 

ammonia-based solvents are considered a potentially attractive alternative (IEA, 2011b). 

Alternatively post-combustion CO2 capture can also be performed by adsorption instead of absorption 

or by a membrane module but today, absorption is the most mature technology.  

A key advantage of this technology (post-combustion CO2 capture method) is that it can be retrofitted 

to existing power stations and that it is already in use in a wide range of processes around the world

3.1.2 Oxy-fuel CO2 Capture  

In this process the fuel combustion - coal, natural gas oil or biomass – occurs in either pure O2 or a 

mixture of pure O2 and a CO2-rich recycled flue gas. The resulting flue gas contains mainly CO2 and 

water vapour and excess O2 (required assuring the fuel complete combustion). These two main 

components are easily separated through cooling, the water condenses and a CO2 rich gas-stream is 

formed.  

The great advantage of the oxy-fuel CO2 capture technique is that a capture rate of 97% is possible, 

together with a purity of 99.9%. The purity of the CO2 captured depends on the purity of the fuel and 

O2 supplied the level of air in-leakage in the boiler, the process design and the intensity of purification 

(IEA, 2011b). 

O2 is the key requirement for any oxy-fuel combustion system (IPCC, 2005) and existing methods of 

O2 production from air separation include cryogenic distillation, adsorption using multi-bed pressure 

swing units and polymeric membranes. These process economic aspects depend on the required O2 

quantities. For all the large applications, such as power station boilers, cryogenic air separation is the 

only economic viable solution (IPCC, 2005).    

Even if oxy-fuel combustion technologies components are well established in the aluminium, iron and 

steel and glass melting industries today, oxy fuel combustion with CO2 storage is currently in the 

demonstration phase. The world?s first pilot project to demonstrate oxyfuel technology at a coal-fired

power plant was inaugurated (the Schwarze Pumpe project) in 2008. This pilot project in western 

Germany is owned by the European energy company, Vattenfall, and it is effectively demonstrating 

the capture of CO2 emissions with a purity of over 99% (NGC, 2011).

3.1.3 Pre-Combustion CO2 Capture  

With a pre-combustion technology, CO2 is to be captured before the combustion of the fuel. In this 

process CO2 is captured from a gas mixture with predominantly H2 gas at high pressure and medium 

CO2 content. Pre-combustion capture technologies can be applied to different feedstocks such as coal, 

natural gas, biomass and waste (IEA, 2008).  This technique is currently in commercial operation for 

different applications such as H2, ammonia and syngas production.  

A pre-combustion capture system usually includes a first stage of reaction intended to produce a 

mixture of H2 and CO (syngas) from a primary fuel (IPCC, 2005). This conversion can be done 

through gasification, partial oxidation or steam reforming technology. Gasification is most often used 

for solid fuels, partial oxidation for liquids, and steam reforming for gases (CCS 101).  

The CO is then converted into CO2 through a shift conversion process which also produces a stream of 

H2. To separate the produced H2 from the CO2, the mixture undergoes a gas clean. This gas clean up 

step is frequently obtained using similar methods employed for post-combustion processes (for e.g.: 
chemical absorption with solvents including MEA, using heat induced CO2 recovery, or physical 

absorption using solvents including Selexol with pressure induced CO2 recovery), although there are 

advantages to removing the CO2 from the syngas mainly associated with the pressure of the gas, which 

decreases compression energy requirements (CCC, 2010) (Stephens, J., 2005). The H2 - a valuable by-

product of pre-combustion – may, among other utilities, be used as a fuel for power generation (CCS 

101) 

Pre-combustion CO2 capture technologies are particularly relevent for coal based plants with 

integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) as IGCC power plants can offer a low-cost high 

efficiency pre-combustion CO2 capture platform (ADB, 2011). 

Within an IGCC technology, before the syngas goes to the gas turbine to generate power, pre-

combustion processes can be incorporated to separate and capture CO2. However, CO2 capture 

implementation to an IGCC power plant do not involve a simple end-of pipe modification since it 

implies not only the additional CO2 capture equipment but changes in other components are also 

required. The syngas CO2 remotion prior to combustion changes the composition of the gas to be 

burned, increasing the H2 content, which alters the design requirements for the gas turbine. 

Furthermore, the CO2 capture process increases complexity to the optimal design of desulphurization 

and other gas clean-up processes and deepens both energy consumption and the amount of coal 

necessary to generate the same amount of electricity (Stephens, 2005).

3.2 Power Plants and CCS  

Since capturing CO2 is still an emerging technology within the power sector, not yet demonstrated on 

a commercial scale, current performance and cost information related to CCS from power generation 

is limited to estimates from engineering studies and pilot projects (IEA, 2011b).   

For coal-fired power generation, no single CO2 capture technology appears to outperform available 

alternative capture processes in terms of performance and costs. For natural gas-fired power plants, 

post-combustion CO2 capture is the option most predominantly considered across studies and appears 

to be the most attractive near-term option for NGCC (IEA, 2011b). 

Compared to coal and natural gas-fired plants, information regarding biomass fired power generation 

with CO2 capture is even scarcer (IEA, 2011b). However, solid biomass as a fuel is similar in many 

ways to coal, and the combustion technologies are, for that reason, similar (IEA, 2008). Thus, the CCS 

strategies that are being developed for coal could also be applied to biomass. In fact, biomass 

combination with CCS would outcome in a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere which may 

become an important option for a rapid reduction of CO2 emissions (IEA, 2008).   

3.2.1 Power Plants - CCS Tehcnologies Performance and Efficiency Penalties  

The power plants perfomance with CO2 capture technologies can be summarized in terms of plants 

efficiency, power output and CO2 emissions. 

Table 3-4 summarizes power generation performance data with and without CO2 capture technologies 

(average OECD results). This data from the working paper “Cost and Performance of Carbon Dioxide 

Capture from Power Generation” from the IEA is based on estimates published over 5 years in major 

engineering studies from about 50 CO2 capture installations at power plants.

Depending on the fuel and technology used for combustion, the energy required to operate CO2 

capture technologies decreases the global efficiency of power generation and other processes. This 

leads to enlarged fuel supplies, enlarged quantities of waste and CO2 emissions production per unit of 

electricity output.  

Average net efficiency penalties for post-combustion and oxy-combustion capture are 10% points 

relative to a pulverised coal plant without capture, and 8% points for pre-combustion capture 

compared to an IGCC (IEA, 2011b).  

For post-combustion CO2 capture from NGCC performance projections include net efficiency 

penalties of 8% points (IEA, 2011b).  

The reduction of energy requirements for CO2 capture and efficiency improvements in the energy 

conversion processes are considered critical for upcoming technology development in order to reduce 

overall environmental impacts and costs. 

3.2.2 Power Plants - Retrofitting with CCS technologies  

CO2 capture technologies can be applied in new power plants or they can be retrofitted to existing 

plants. Two possibilities for retrofitting CO2 capture in an existing coal-fired power station are post-

combustion CO2 capture from the flue gas, e.g. by means of MEA scrubbing and converting the 

combustion process to use pure O2 (oxy-fuel combustion) (RECCS, 2008). 

Retrofitting entails some drawbacks since there may be site restrictions and limited land for capture 

equipment; a long remaining plant life may be required to vindicate the large expense of installing 

capture equipment; old plants often have low energy efficiencies and the installation of CO2 capture 

technologies will have a proportionally larger impact on the net output than in high efficiency plants 

(IPCC, 2005).    

In order to reduce the site constraints, new power plants could be projected “capture-ready”, that is, 

with sufficient space and facilities available for latter on simpler installation of CO2 capture 

equipment. Retrofits require case-by-case careful design-based examination. For particular types of 

capture retrofit such as pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion much of the required retrofit 

equipment could be installed in a separate site if needed (IPCC, 2005).    

The other constraints could be largely reduced by upgrading or considerably rebuilding the existing 

plant when capture is retrofitted. In fact, old inefficient boilers and steam turbines could be substituted 

by modern, high efficiency supercritical boilers and turbines or IGCC plants. As the efficiencies of 

power generation equipment are improving, the efficiency of the retrofitted plant with CO2 capture 

could be as high as that of the plant without capture (IPCC, 2005).

3.3 CCS Technologies Applications beyond the Power Sector  

CO2 emissions associated to industrial energy use are expected to further grow in the next decades. 

The CO2 emitting processes within industry are varied and so are the alternatives to reduce emissions, 

at the present and in the future. However, for achieving deep CO2 emission reductions, industry is 

considered to have fewer alternatives to CCS than the power sector (UNIDO, 2010). Indeed, in many 

industry sectors, CCS is the only technology, with the exception of EE improvements, that allows for 

significant cuts in CO2 emissions (IEA, 2011j).  

Even if the majority of the short-term and cost-effective potential for CCS lies within the industrial 

sources of CO2, most of the studies on the potential application of CCS have focused on the power 

sector, in particular coal-fired power plants applications. However, if CCS is to fulfil its potential and 

make the maximum contribution to the required emission reductions, this unevenness must be 

addressed (UNIDO, 2010).  

The deployment of CCS in industry entails several analogous challenges as those associated to the 

power sector. Unproven technology in some cases, increased energy use and the price of novel 

technology will inhibit many projects (UNIDO, 2010).   

In their report to the Muskoka 2010 G8 Summit, the IEA and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership 

Forum in partnership with the Global CCS Institute have called for the identification of a larger 

number of projects in industrial sectors and assistance for the development of CCS in developing 

countries (UNIDO, 2010).   

In industry, CCS is currently considered a valuable solution for CO2 emission reduction within: 

- Industries that vent high-purity CO2 into the atmosphere. These sources of CO2 are relatively 
cost-effective to capture and could therefore embody early opportunities for CCS to be 

demonstrated;  

- CO2 intensive industries where CO2 emissions are inherent to industrial processes, where it is 
technical and economically more difficult to reduce these emissions than in other sectors and 

where CCS becomes one of the only options for large scale emissions reductions as it is for 

the cement and steel industries (UNIDO, 2010) (IEA, 2008). 

Additionally, and even if the costs for CO2 capture can diverge considerably with the size, type and 

location of the industrial processes, the costs will be lowest for processes or plants that operate at high 

load factors and processes that can use waste heat to supply the energy requirements of CO2 capture 

systems (IPCC, 2005).  

3.3.1 High-purity CO2 Sources 

There are several processes in industry and in fuel production that attain a high purity, high 

concentration CO2 off-gas. These CO2 off-gases can be readily dehydrated, compressed, transported 

and stored.  

Even if the CO2 emissions from these activities are relatively modest when compared to the emissions 

from other activities, these CO2 streams offer significant potential for „early opportunity? CCS 

demonstration projects since there is no need for the energy-intensive step of CO2 separation which  

provides lower cost options for CCS. 

These CO2 high purity sources include: 

- Natural gas processing;  

- H2 production (including for the production of ammonia and ammonia-based fertilisers); 

- Synthetic fuel production (e.g. CtL
6
 and GtL

7
); and  

                                                      

6
 CtL (coal-to-liquid) is a synthetic hydrocarbon liquid that is converted form coal. 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    27 

 

- Several organic chemical production processes (e.g. ethylene oxide production) (UNIDO, 
2010).             

The streams of waste gas generated within all the above mentioned industrial processes reach 

concentrations of CO2 within 30% to 100% (UNIDO, 2010). 

Natural Gas Processing 

Natural gas reservoirs, other than natural gas, often contain a mixture of acid gases including H2S and 

CO2. H2S needs to be removed to trace levels from natural gas since it is extremely corrosive when 

mixed with water and toxic to biological organisms (CCC, 2010). The CO2 content of raw natural gas 

lies between 2% and 70% by volume (UNIDO, 2010). The required level of CO2 removal varies 

depending on delivery route and end use (CCC, 2010). In order to comply with pipeline specifications 

CO2 has to be removed until its content is reduced to below 2% by volume for transportation, (IPCC, 

2005). Characteristic specifications for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and GTL feedstock are less than 

0.2% of CO2 content by volume (UNIDO, 2010). The basic natural gas processing (NGP) 

configuration for removing CO2 from natural gas is termed „gas sweetening?. This process results in an 

off-gas containing between 96% and 99% of CO2.  

Hydrogen Production  

Each year, about 45 to 50 Mt of H2 are produced globally. The bulk of H2 production is based on fossil 

fuel feedstocks and around half of the H2 generated is used to produce ammonia (UNIDO, 2010).   

The methods used for H2 generation from fossil fuel or biomass feedstock include: steam reforming, 

auto-thermal reforming (ATR), partial oxidation (POX), and gasification. All these methods are based 

in solid fuel gasification or natural gas reforming technologies to produce a syngas. The water-gas 

shift reaction process converts the syngas into a mixture of H2 and CO2 in variable quantities. In the 

case of a H2 purified stream production, the CO2 must be removed, whereas for synthetic fuel 

production, the water-gas shift conversion and gas clean-up steps are controlled to optimise the H2/CO 

ratio (UNIDO, 2010).  

Ammonia Production 

Ammonia is one of the most used inorganic chemicals in the world and almost all nitrogen fertilizers 

are derived from ammonia (IFA, 2011). Natural gas is, worldwide, the dominant feedstock for 

ammonia production although a substantial portion (27%) is coal-based (IFA, 2011). CO2 is routinely 

captured from ammonia production plants and the CO2 removed is frequently used for the production 

of urea and nitro-phosphates within the same integrated plant. In most ammonia plants, CO2 is 

separated from H2 at an early stage generally using solvent absorption (IEA, 2008).  

Synthetic Fuel Production   

Given the potential to diminish oil dependency, the gasification of carbon-containing feedstocks (coal, 

natural gas and biomass) followed by hydrocarbon synfuel production has been receiving ample 

attention for some decades now. A variety of synfuels have been proposed: methanol, DiMethyl Ether 

(DME), naphtha/gasoline and diesel. These fuels production processes energy efficiencies range from 

40% to 70% and as a consequence, they emit large amounts of CO2 which can be captured and stored 

(IEA, 2008). 

Ethylene Oxide Production  

A key use for ethylene oxide (EO) is as a chemical intemediate in industry (EPA, 2000). EO is 

produced by direct oxidation of etylene over a silver catalyst (UNIDO, 2010).  A side reaction 

produces, amog others, CO2 and water. This CO2 can be partly re-used in the reactor feed, vented or 

used in commercial applications (IEA, 2011j).

3.3.2 Cement Industry 

Cement production is an energy and raw material intensive process that emits large quantities of CO2. 

These emissions arise from three separate sources: fuel combustion, limestone calcination in the kiln 

(while in the kiln, limestone is broken down into CO2 and lime) and indirectly through electricity use 

(Ellerman, et al. 2010) (EPA, 2011).   

Several different studies within the IEA, the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and the European 

Cement Research Academy (ECRA) have focused on the cement industry emissions reductions 

potential (IEA, 2009). According to the IEA, the cement industry is expected to play a key role within 

the CO2 mitigation targets and CCS technologies are viewed as the main solution to achieve deep 

emission cuts within this sector (IEA, 2008). 

The cement industry is active in R&amp;amp;D for CO2 capture and post-combustion CO2 capture and oxy-fuel 

technologies are recognized as possible options for the sector. Nevertheless, before 2020, CCS 

technologies in the cement industry are not likely to be commercially available since, before then, 

further research and pilot tests are required to gain practical experience with these technologies (IEA, 

2009) (IEA, 2011j).  

3.3.3 Iron and Steel Production  

The production of iron and steel is also an energy intensive activity that generates substantial process-

related CO2 emissions and CCS technologies are considered the main option to achieve deep emission 

cuts within the sector (EPA, 2011) (IEA, 2008). 

In the iron and steel making, depending on the production process used, a number of CO2 capture 

systems have the potential to be implemented. However, CCS faces many uncertainties regarding cost, 

efficiency and technology choice. Direct CO2 emissions of iron and steel production are very site 

specific and depend on the iron and steel making procedure (IEA, 2011j).    

3.3.4 Refineries 

Refineries produce significant amounts of CO2 emissions depending on processed crude, extent of 

processing, and quality and composition of the product mix. A unique characteristic of the refining 

industry is that it entails multiple CO2 sources and hence different technologies for emissions 

mitigation may be required depending on the source. The greatest sources of CO2 emissions stem from 

process heaters, utilities and FFC, and from H2 manufacture. All three key capture methods, post-

combustion from diluted flue gas streams, pre-combustion capture from syngases, and oxy-fuel 

combustion for concentrating CO2 in flue gases, could be applicable (IEA, 2011j).  

The role of CCS in the refining industry is unclear owing to comparably high costs of capture, thigh 

refining margins and multiple different CO2 sources within a refining site (DNV, 2010) 

3.3.5 Pulp and Paper Plants  

The pulp and paper is an increasing global industry that emits considerable amounts of CO2. 

Approximately 60% of CO2 emissions in the pulp and paper industry are from biomass fuel 

combustion. Pulp and paper industry off-gases contain 13-14% of CO2 and post-combustion capture of 

CO2 from these diluted streams is expensive. Black liquor gasification can be applied for production of 

liquid fuels and allow for easier capture of CO2 using pre-combustion technologies. (IEA, 2011j).    

3.4 CO2 Transportation and Storage   

For CCS technologies to be an effective option for global climate change reduction, and for its high 

costs to be justified, significant quantities of the CO2 captured must be stored for a long period. To 

integrate point source emissions with geological storage solutions, CO2  needs to be transported. In 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    29 

 

theory, CO2 can be transported via pipeline (on-and offshore), by ship or by tank wagons. However, 

most of the CO2 transportation is achieved via pipeline since pipelines are generally the most cost-

effective way to transport large volumes of CO2. Additionally, the technologies involved in pipeline 

transportation are the same as those extensively used for transporting natural gas, oil and several other 

fluids worldwide (CCSA, 2011). Therefore, this is a relatively „mature? option, and has been in 

operation for some decades and comprises most of the existing CO2 transportation infrastructures 

around the world. In North America, with an excellent safety track record (IEA, 2008), there is a 5900 
km pipeline structure transporting approximately 50Mtpa of CO2 for EOR (GCI, 2011a).  

Transporting CO2 by ship may as well be a competitive choice for transporting large volumes over 

long distances. Supposing port access, shipping may be the only practical option if onshore pipeline 

structures and appropriate storage locations are not available, and for the reason that offshore pipelines 

are considerably more expensive.  

An Integrated CO2 “network” for CCS   

For CCS to be extensively deployed, a broad transportation infrastructure is necessary, and CO2 

pipelines will be required to serve many users. In fact, much of the already existing CO2 pipeline 

structure in the world implements an integrated network
8
 approach (GCI, 2011a).   

Even if a network approach comprises additional risks, higher initial investment levels, and 

interoperability issues, the economies of scale and other benefits compared to a standalone individual 

CCS project can offer economic benefits and are inducing the expansion of proposed CCS projects 

(GCI, 2011a). Therefore, and as CCS builds from demonstration to commercialization, CO2 networks 

will require co-ordination on a regional, national and international level to optimise infrastructure 

development and to reduce costs. 

CO2 Storage   

The different types of geological storage presently under consideration within the Global CCS 

Institute are summarily described in Table 3-5. Table also presents the status of large-scale projects.

 An integrated CO2 „network? for CCS is considered to be a system with shared or interconnected infrastructure 

for CO2 transportation from many anthropogenic capture sources to one or more underground injection sites for 

storage. The “network” concept does not preclude the transportation of CO2 through ship.

Coal has a natural affinity for CO2 relative to methane that is naturally found on the

the methane that can be captured for economic purposes 

Low injectivity of coal and the consequent need for many injection wells may restrict 

potential except where CO2 is used to enhance production from an existing coal-bed 

methane project.

In 2005 the global CO2 storage capacity has been estimated by the IPCC in its CCS Special Report.  

These estimations range from 1700-11000 Gt of CO2 for a variety of storage types, with deep saline 

formation storage making up the vast majority. The IPCC stated that there was enough capacity at a 

global level to store a total of 145Gt of CO2 from emissions by 2050 (GCI, 2011a).   

3.5 CCS Technologies - International Status  

The following section intends to provide a snapshot of the current state of play within CCS projects 

developments, technology costs and legal and regulatory issues.  

3.5.1 Projects 

During 2010 important CCS project activity has been recorded. Several newly identified projects 

counterbalanced delays and cancellations. By the end of last year, 234 active or planned CCS projects 

were identified across a range of technologies, project types and sectors. Seventy-seven of these 234 

projects are large-scale integrated projects (LSIP) (GCI, 2011a).    

The asset lifecycle model represents the various stages in the development of a project (Table 3-6).

Of the 77 LSIP, 8 are operating projects and 4 projects are in the execution stage of the asset lifecycle. 

The remaining 65 LSIP are in different phases of development planning (phases of the asset lifecycle 

preceding the final investment decision) (GCI, 2011a).    

All 8 operating LSIP and the 4 in execution are associated with the oil and gas sector: they either 

capture CO2 via natural gas processing or they inject CO2 for EOR (Table 3-7).

Within the power generation sector there are 42 LSIP in development planning. Most of those are 

planned for coal-fired applications and are in different stages of development planning. An important 

exception is the Southern Company IGCC Project, which is in the Execute phase (GCI, 2011a).    

Among the LSIP there are 2 iron and steel projects, 1 cement project and 1 pulp and paper project 

(GCI, 2011a).   

Most LSIP are found in developed countries, such as in the United States, Europe, Canada and 

Australia, with a few in emerging markets such as China. Driven by a variety of incentives being 

offered by the government as well as the extensive practice of EOR, the United States has the largest 

amount of newly identified LSIP and dominates project activity. The biggest sum of cancellations and 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    32 

 

delays of LSIP has occurred in Europe. Still, Europe has also had the highest amount of projects 

moving forward in the asset lifecycle. With six and five LSIP, the United Kingdom and the 

Netherlands present the largest number of projects in the Europe. Even though public funding (from 

the European Union and some National Governments) is supporting activity, weak economic 

conditions and difficulties surrounding use of onshore storage sites have increased uncertainty in 

investment decision making in Europe (GCI, 2011a).   

Figure 3-1 presents all active and planned projects by industry sector and by asset lifecycle stage. 

 
Figure 3-1 - All active and planned projects by industry sector and by asset lifecycle stage (GCI, 

2011a).   

The power industry, which has been, up till now, the foremost beneficiary of government 

arrangements in support of large-scale demonstration of CCS, accounted for almost half of all active 

and planned project activity in 2010 (GCI, 2011a).    

Pre-combustion and post-combustion capture technologies dominate the LSIP, with 33 projects (43%) 

and 21 projects (27%) correspondingly (GCI, 2011a).    

The flexibility of the pre-combustion capture technology is shown through the spread of projects 

across power generation (19), synthetic natural gas (5), coal-to-liquids (3), fertiliser production (3), oil 

refining (2) and H2 production (1). The bulk of pre-combustion capture within LSIP is being 

developed for new build facilities. In contrast, around 60% of the post-combustion capture projects 

involve retrofitting existing facilities (GCI, 2011a).    

Oxy-fuel combustion is being planned or considered within 4 projects, all in the power generation 

industry, including the recently restructured FutureGen 2.0 project in the United States (GCI, 2011a).    

In order to compare the status of technologies being considered for CCS implementation there are 4 

categories to designate the level of technology maturity in use: commercial, demonstration, pilot and 

bench. These are primarily defined by the scale of the activity in a particular industry. For instance a 

commercial process is presented for sale by one or more trustworthy vendors with standard 

commercial assurances; a large-scale demonstration process entails the integration of technologies into 

a full-size structure to demonstrate viability and commercial readiness in a specific application. When 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    33 

 

in a pilot stage, a process or technology is being tested in a realistic environment, typically at one to 

two orders of magnitude minor than a full-scale demonstration, once it has been created in a controlled 

environment in a bench or laboratory scale successfully (GCI, 2011a).     

All active and planned projects by industry sector and by technology maturity are presented in Figure 

3-2.  

 
Figure 3-2 - All active and planned projects by industry sector and by technology maturity (GCI, 

2011a).    

Pipelines are the most common means for CO2 transport within LSIPs and almost 90% of LSIPs 

involve transporting CO2 or are planning to transport CO2 via pipelines (GCI, 2011a).   

Potential storage of CO2 is evenly split between EOR and deep saline formations options (GCI, 

2011a).  Table 3-8 presents the CO2 storage current large-scale projects but does not include those 

projects where the exact storage type has not been specified.

In the near to medium term EOR will probably continue to be a common form of potential storage. 

Despite the fact that this route can act as an „enabler? for a less costly and faster mechanism for the 

demonstration of capture technologies, additional improvements in the monitoring and verification of 

injected CO2 to demonstrate permanent storage is considered crucial. Deep saline formations offer 

much greater storage potential in the longer term but, the time and expense of proving up this storage 

option, particularly in offshore applications, should not be undervalued (GCI, 2011a).

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    34 

 

Several LSIPs in the Define phase have satisfactory funding to complete their current asset lifecycle 

stage of development; however, a large number of projects in the Identify and Evaluate stages may not 

advance except if additional funding is forthcoming (GCI, 2011a).    

3.5.2 Costs  

Developing and deploying CCS LSIP is challenging and one of the main obstacles is the relatively 

high cost of the technologies to capture the CO2, transport it and safely store it compared to the same 

facilities without CCS. 

Project costs can fluctuate significantly and published estimates show an extensive range of costs for 

CCS owing to the diversity of project-specific factors. These factors, among others, include: the scale 

of the facility, its expected life-time, load factor and labour rates; the type and costs of fuel consumed; 

the selection of CCS technology and design; the CO2 capture targets; the distances, terrains and the 

CO2 quantities involved to transport and storage (IPCC, 2005).  

Investment decisions on CCS projects depend on several case-specific boundary circumstances such 

as, among others: the emission market; the national or regional policy and regulatory frameworks; the 

availability of incentive and financing structures; they also depend on the experience and risk profile 

of the investor (IEA, 2011b). 

Each part of the CCS value chain includes multiple variants and publicly available CCS technologies 

cost data are scarce; therefore, without access to detailed project specific information, project based 

costs provide limited guidance on underlying technology costs. 

However, one thing is certain: within the whole CCS process chain the CO2 capture technologies are 

generally expected to entail, by far, the largest absolute cost.   

In the power sector, and as previously stated, CO2 capture is still an emerging technology that has not 

been demonstrated on a commercial scale and related cost information is still uncertain and is based 

on feasibility studies and pilot projects. The accuracy of techno-economic data for CCS is expected to 

improve when supplementary information from the first commercial scale demonstration plants are 

available (IEA, 2011b). 

Table 3-9 presents economic data for CO2 capture within power generation, including CO2 

conditioning and compression. It presents average OECD results, since available data for CO2 capture 

from power generation in non-OECD countries is very limited. This data from the working paper 

“Cost and Performance of Carbon Dioxide Capture from Power Generation” from the IEA is based on 

estimates published over 5 years in major engineering studies from about 50 CO2 capture installations 

at power plants. Capital costs and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE
9
) are re-evaluated and updated to 

2010 cost levels to allow for a consistent comparison.

 LCOE is commonly used as a measure of comparing generating costs of different power generation and 

capture technologies over a plant?s economic life. LCOE is equal to the present value of the sum of discounted 

costs divided by the total electricity production.

It is expected that the cost of CCS technologies will decline in the future in parallel with technical and 

scientific progress. 

CO2 capture applications for industrial processes have not been, as previously reported, investigated to 

the same degree as those from power generation. WorleyParsons estimated costs of CCS applications 

to existing industrial systems for: blast furnace production of steel; cement kiln/furnaces; natural gas 

processing; and fertiliser production (ammonia). As formerly discussed the latter two processes attain 

a high purity, high concentration CO2 off-gas and therefore do not require the energy-intensive step of 

CO2 separation which results on lower cost routes for CCS technologies deployment.

Compared to CO2 capture processes data, transportation and storage associated data are even more 

difficult to generalise, since that they are extremely site-specific or even unique for every project 

(IEA, 2011b). 

Costs for CO2 transportation depend on distance and quantities involved and on local geographical 

conditions. Still, the transport costs are generally considered low when compared to the CO2 capture 

costs. As stated before, the transportation of CO2 by pipeline offers potential cost savings through 

combining the flow of CO2 from multiple sources into a single pipeline to a common storage site 

(GCI, 2011b). 

A balanced decision on transport modes and a rigorous matching of CO2 sources and sinks over time 

are evident opportunities to reduce costs.  

The costs of CO2 storage are site specific, driven by the geology of the storage formation (GCI, 

2011b). Recently released economic studies suggest that storage costs contribute to less than 5% under 

ideal conditions, rising to about 10% for storage sites with „poorer? geologic properties. In some cases, 

without a suitable storage site that is reachable by effective transport units, CCS may not be an option  

                                                      

10
 Overnight costs include, according to OECD terminology: pre-construction or owner?s costs, engineering and 

construction costs and contingency costs.

3.5.3 Legal and Regulatory Framework 

In order to boost CCS deployment, important progress is being made in the development of CCS legal 

and regulatory frameworks worldwide (IEA, 2011c). In fact, in recent years the international 

community has amended several international legal instruments, including international marine 

legislation and climate change frameworks. However, a number of important issues remain unresolved 

and legal and regulatory progress has been largely circumscribed to OECD countries and regions with 

less progress realized in non-OECD regions (GCI, 2011a). In the latter countries, CCS regulatory 

development will be of particular importance, especially in the largest emitting countries such as 

China.  

To allow for offshore CO2 storage, the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine 

Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Protocol) was amended, in November 

2006. This amendment came into force without having to be ratified by contracting parties since the 

amendment was made to the Annex of the Protocol (GCI, 2011a).    

In October 2009 the London Protocol was once again amended to allow cross-border transportation of 

CO2 intended for storage, however, this amendment modifies the body of the protocol and therefore it 

will only enter into force once two-thirds of all contracting parties to the London Protocol have 

accepted the amendment. Thus, under the London Protocol, CO2 cross-border transportation is still 

prohibited (GCI, 2011a).     

In 2007, to embrace analogous alterations, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine 

Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention) was amended as well. Yet again, the 

amendments are not in force and necessitate ratification by seven contracting parties under the OSPAR 

Convention?s ratification provisions to enter into effect. So far, six contracting parties to the OSPAR 

Convention have ratified the amendment, which means that the amendment may enter into force 

imminently, with only another party required to ratify the modifications (GCI, 2011a).    

Additionally, important advancement has been accomplished in addressing some of the most 

challenging CCS legal and regulatory issues such as long-term liability, with several countries and 

regions having launched regulatory approaches to address this subject (GCI, 2011a).    

At the COP16 Climate Change negotiations in Cancun, in November and December 2010, within the 

international frameworks for climate change, it has been established that CCS ought to be entitled as a 

CDM
11

 project activity, once different specific issues are addressed and resolved in an appropriate 

way. This mechanism embodies the most significant step towards an international encouragement for 

regulating and supporting CCS projects in developing countries within the past five years (GCI, 

2011a).    

In Europe the development of CCS legal and regulatory frameworks is founded around the European 

Union CCS Directive (Directive 2009/31/EC). This Directive establishes a framework for regulating 

CO2 storage, including requirements on permitting, composition of the CO2 stream, monitoring, 

reporting, inspections, corrective measures, closure and post-closure obligations, transfer of 

responsibility to the state, and financial security. This Directive also amends several other European 

Union laws to establish requirements on capture and transport operations and diminish existing legal 

obstacles to the CO2 geological storage (GCI, 2011a).

 The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows projects in developing countries to 

generate emission credits if they result in emission levels lower than would otherwise be the case; these credits 

can be marketed and eventually counted against a developed country's emission obligation.

4 COMET Project  

The COMET (Integrated infrastructure for CO2 transport and storage in the west MEdiTerranean) 

project, funded under 7th FWP (Seventh Framework Programme
12

), aims to study the techno-

economic feasibility of integrating CO2 transport and storage infrastructures in the West 

Mediterranean region, within Portugal, Spain and Morocco. 

The project feasibility study will take into account several scenarios of energy system development for 

the time period 2010-2050, the location and development of the major CO2 point sources and the 

available potential for geological storage in each of those countries. The long-term development of the 

Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan energy systems is modeled and evaluated via the technical 

economic models MARKAL/TIMES. MARKAL is the acronym for MARket Allocation and TIMES – 

which is the next generation version of MARKAL – stands for the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM 

System. TIMES is an economic model generator for local, national or multi-regional energy systems, 

which provides a technology-rich basis for estimating energy dynamics over a long-term, multi-period 

time horizon. It is usually applied to the analysis of the entire energy sector, but it may also be applied 

to study in detail single sectors such as, for example, the electricity and district heat sector. 

The need for a joint CCS infrastructure in the West Mediterranean is related to the geographical 

proximity, to the increasing connections between the energy and industrial sectors in the area, to the 

continuity of sedimentary basins that can act as possible storage reservoirs and to the existing 

experience in managing a large gas transport infrastructure, such as the natural gas pipeline coming 

through Morocco, to Spain and Portugal. The consortium is coordinated by INETI (Portugal), and 

comprises 7 research institutions, 4 Universities, 1 SME and 5 energy companies from 6 European 

countries and Morocco.  

It is expected that the project results will generate insights that can contribute considerably to the 

deployment of CCS in the area. 

The COMET project is divided within the following 7 Work Packages (WP): 

WP1: Project management and coordination 

WP2: Identification of the location and the amounts of CO2 emissions from the sources (Portugal, 

Spain and Morocco).  

WP3: Identification of the locations and the storage capacity of potential sinks in the region (Portugal,  

WP4: GIS

 integration of all the information and elements of a CO2 transmission network 

WP5: Analysis of the Moroccan, Portuguese and Spanish energy systems and its modelling via

WP6: In depth assessment of the most promising infrastructure options (scenario building, transport 

costs, technical-economic evaluation of different options).  

WP7: Promotion, Dissemination and International collaboration.

Figure 4-1- COMET project structure (COMET project, 2011) 

As part of the WP5 of the COMET project, this thesis?s gathers and discusses the quantitative and 

qualitative information to, for the first time, model the energy system of Morocco via 

MARKAL/TIMES and includes an analyses of the primary modelling outcomes.  

Some work already existed related to the evolution of the energy sectors in Portugal and Spain, with 

MARKAL/TIMES models having been developed individually for the two countries. The COMET 

project will integrate those models, together with the model developed from scratch for Morocco, 

while updating the three models. 

The input information to model the energy system of Morocco includes, among others: energy 

transformation, consumption and emissions trends data of the energy sector and other industrial 

activities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the 

energy end-use sectors; an estimation of the national energy related resources; and an assessment of 

relevant energy related policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of 

policies within the energy sector. The information collected is based on several sources, either national 

or international and for modelling purposes most of it refers to 2005 and 2008.

5 Moroccan Energy System  

5.1 General Description of the Country  

Morocco is geographically positioned in the northwest corner of the African continent, between the 

North Atlantic Ocean (to the west) and the Mediterranean Sea (to the northeast) (Figure 5-1). The 

country shares borders with Algeria in the east and with Mauritania in the south. This Maghreb 

country is separated from Europe by the Strait of Gibraltar and is sited at approximately 14 km from 

Spain at the nearest point. Rabat is the capital city. 

 
Figure 5-1 - Moroccan territory (GPM, 2011) 

With an area of 710850 km
2
 and a large extension in latitude, from 21° to 36° north, this country 

comprises four topographical zones: the Atlas and Rif mountain ranges to the north reaching altitudes 

of 4165 m; the Sahara desert to the south; the fertile coastal plains to the west and the drier Anti-Atlas 

region in the centre.  

The country coast extends over 3500 km a fact that has an important effect on the climate, commercial 

relations, tourism, fishing activities, and in coastline urbanization. The dominating weather in 

Morocco is Mediterranean, temperated in the west and in the north by the North Atlantic Ocean. Inside 

the country, the weather is more continental with major differences of temperature. Rain fall is 

concentrated in the winter months in line with northern hemisphere weather patterns. The hot and dry 

summer months have temperatures as high as 40°C throughout the country and even superior in some 

remote inland regions. The Atlas area is very humid, and snowfalls are frequent during the winter 

months. The south has desert weather. Morocco is part of the subtropical zone and it is exposed in the 

summer to the conditions of the warm dry zone and to the fresh, wet and moderate conditions in the 

winter. There are numerous rivers in the country. The main ones are the Moulouya River, which drains 

into the Mediterranean Sea, and the Sebou and Oum Rbiâ Rivers, which flow into the Atlantic Ocean.  

Ready to be approved by the parliament is the division of the country within the following 12 regions: 

Eastern region and Rif, Tanger-Tétouan, Fès-Meknès, Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, Beni Mellal-Khénifra, 

Casablanca-Settat, Marrakech-Safi, Drâa-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa, Guelmim-Oued noun, Laâyoune-

Saquia al hamara, Ed dakhla and Oued eddahab.

5.2 Macro and Socio-Economic Drivers  

5.2.1 Population 

In 2004 the Moroccan population reached 29891708 inhabitants and according to the General Census 

carried out that year by the High Planning Commission, the urban population amounted to 16463634 

while the rural population amounted to 13428074 (PNM, 2006). In 2004 the urbanization level 

reached 55.1% increasing from 51.4% in 1994. In 1994 the average number of people per household 

was 5.9 (6.6 in rural areas and 5.2 in urban areas) and in 2009 the average number of people decreased 

to 4.9 per household (5.8 in rural areas and 4.5 in urban areas) (HCP, 2009).  

In 2010 the population reached 31.851 million and there were 40 inhabitants per km
2
. Table 5-1 

presents two national population projections (from Eurostat and from the Second National 

Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change).

5.2.2 Economy  

Over the last two decades, Morocco has effectively implemented audacious programs for economic 

and social development. Moroccan leaders introduced solid reforms to liberalize trade relations with 

the E.U. and U.S., deeply invested in basic infrastructure, steadied macroeconomic policy, expanded 

investment opportunities, ameliorated education, and opened the political system (UNCTAD, 2011). 

Table 5-2 presents the last decade GDP per capita development.

The Moroccan economy has been consistently reliant on the agricultural sector but over the past 

decade it has embarked upon a diversification of its structure. Progressively, more growth comes from 

the secondary and tertiary sectors (AEO, 2011). The GVA by sector within 2000 and 2006 is 

presented in Table 5-3.

5.3 Overview of the Energy System  

Morocco is an emerging country, in full economic and social development. Therefore, and with an 

increasing population, in order to sustain this development, the primary energy consumption has risen. 

During the last decade (2000-2010), the energy consumption has increased by 5% per year on average 

mainly stimulated, during the last five years, by a higher electricity consumption which has increased 

by 7.5% per year on average (UNCCC, 2010). This power consumption upsurge is attributable to both 

the expansion of the rural electrification as part of the Global Rural Electrification Program (PERG), a 

project launched by the Moroccan authorities and the ONE (National Office of Electricity) in 1996, 

and to the country?s economic progress. According to the Minister of Energy, Mines, Water and 

Environment in 2020, primary energy and electricity consumption will double, compared to their level 

in 2008, and by 2030 these consumptions will be three and four times greater, respectively (UNCCC, 

2010).  

In 1995 the energy use was of 8592 ktoe whereas by 2008 it reached 14977 ktoe (Figure 5-3). Energy 

use (kt of oil equivalent) refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, 

which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels 

supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport (World Bank, 2011).

Energy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent per capita)

 
Figure 5-4 - Energy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent per capita) (World Bank, 2011) 

Figure 5-5 presents the rising of the TPES by type of fuel within 1972 and 2008 (it excludes electricity 

trades).  

 
 Figure 5-5 - Total primary energy supply excluding electricity trade (IEA, 2011i) 

As illustrated in Fig 5-5 the Moroccan energy supply is heavily based on fossil fuels, mainly on oil 

and on a smaller scale, on coal/peat products. In 2005 gas was first introduced in the primary energy 

supply mix. It is expected that fossil fuels remain dominant for at least the next three decades in the 

Moroccan energy supply (UNCCC, 2010). 

Figure 5-6 presents the fossil fuel (coal, oil, petroleum, and natural gas products) energy consumption 

as percentage of total between 1995 and 2008.

An improvement in the Mohammdia refinery completed in 2009 increased its capacity and efficiency 

allowing for higher quality products. Therefore, the refinery?s production margins are estimated to 

increase significantly. The petroleum downstream sector is in a mutation process since new topping at 

the oil refinery and the reinforcement of LPG storage capacities are planned (MEMME, 2009). 

Given that the country has very limited fossil resources available, it depends highly on energy imports 

in order to fulfil its energy requirements and is the largest energy importer in North Africa (IEA, 

2011i).  

The country?s energy import dependence has steadily risen over time as energy needs have increased. 

In 1995 the Moroccan net energy import
 
was of 88.6% whereas by 2008 it reached 95.7% (Figure 5-

10) (World Bank, 2011). Net energy imports are estimated as energy use less production, both 

measured in oil equivalents.

The Moroccan dependence on imported fossil fuels, predominantly oil, has a critical effect on both 

national and government budgets. The high oil prices recorded until mid-2008 were particularly 

burdensome and led to a widening of the Moroccan energy trade deficit. This strong dependence 

makes the country vulnerable to volatile and erratic fluctuations of the energy markets. Table 5-7 

presents the Moroccan energy balance in 2008.

With the PERG, Morocco took an ambitious step to generalize power access within rural areas 

excluded from this basic infrastructure. The rural electrification development (carried out either by 

linking them to the interconnected grid or in a decentralized manner, thanks to PV kits) is presented in 

Figure 5-12 (ONE, 2009).

Rural electrification (%)

 
Figure 5-12 – Rural electrification evolution between 1995 and 2009 (ONE, 2009) 

The Moroccan electricity demand has passed from approximately 13263 GWh in 1999 to 22608 GWh 

in 2007 which represents an average growth rate of about 6.9% (MEMEE, 2008). During this period 

the power demand peak has passed from 2394 to 3980 MW, which represents an annual increase of 

6.6%. In 2008 the power demand has been of 24168 GWh representing, approximately, a 7.1% 

increase relatively to 2007 (Figure 5-13). 

In 2009 the power demand reached nearly 25016 GWh, representing an approximately 4% increase 

compared to the demand recorded in the previous year (ONE, 2009).

5.3.1.2 Power Supply 

In the seventies the power sector depended on a considerable extent on hydroelectricity. Currently, the 

power generation is deeply based on fossil fuels with a small share from renewable energy sources 

(mainly hydroelectricity and wind power). Coal remains the principal fuel for electricity supply and 

more than 50% of the country?s electricity demand has been supplied by coal power plants in the last 

decades.  

Figure 5-15 presents the electricity production from oil sources (crude oil and petroleum products).

Electricity production from coal sources (GWh)

 
Figure 5-16 – Electricity production from coal sources (GWh) (World Bank, 2011) 

Natural gas has been introduced in the primary energy supply mix in 2005.The electricity production 

from natural gas sources (excluding natural gas liquids) in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was of 2003 

GWh, 2512 GWh, 2823 GWh and 2867 GWh, respectively (World Bank, 2011).   

Figure 5-17 illustrates the share of the different fuel sources for power generation in 2006. In that year, 

coal, oil and gas accounted for approximately 68%, 14% and 13% respectively for power generation.

5.3.1.3 Generation Capacity 

Coal Fired Power Plants 

In 2008 there were three coal fired power plants in Morocco, the Jorf Lasfar (JLEC) (4 Units, 1320 

MW), the Mohammedia (300 MW generated by two coal-fired 150 MW steam turbines) and the 

Jerada plant (165 MW) (ONE, 2011). 

The Jorf Lasfar plant was one of the three main projects within the Production Concessionnel 

d’Electricité (PCE) in the 1999 to 2007 period. In 2007, this power plant provided about 50% of the 

national electricity production.  In 2008 the power plant production was 10022.8 GWh representing a 

0.1% evolution relatively to 2007. An extension of the Jorf Lasfar power plant is expected to be 

commissioned between 2012 and 2013 (units 5-6, 700 MW). It will provide the much needed base 

load capacity to the country (ONE, 2009). The Mohammedia power plant was built in the early 1980s. 

In 2008 this power plant has produced 823.9 GWh. In that same year the Jerada power plant produced 

815.1 GWh (COMET, 2011).  

The ONE is planning to build a coal fired power plant with two new units (2 x 660 MW) in the Safi 

region. This project is conditioned by the construction of a port infrastructure, near the power plant, 

capable of receiving the fuel. This power plant inauguration is expected by the end of 2012 with a 

production of about 10 billion KWh per year, representing about 27% of the country?s total demand 

by 2015. This coal fired power plant will use “Clean Coal” technologies to enhance EE and reduce the 

environmental impacts (ONE, 2009).    

Combined Cycle Power Plants  

The Tahaddart power station (385 MW) is the first combined cycle power plant built in the country. It 

opened on 20 January 2005. This installation consumes natural gas from the Maghreb Europe pipeline 

(MEMEE, 2008). It has a Siemens-manufactured steam turbine and gas turbine (nominal capacity of 

400 MW). During 2009, this power plant supplied 2842550 MWh. It operated over 8440 hours at 

95.4% capacity, and at an average operating capacity of 336.8 MW. This facility is the first power 

plant in the country to have its Environmental Management System certified by an internationally 

recognized body. The UNE-EN ISO 14001 Standard certifies that this power station operates in a way 

that protects the environment (PRP, 2011).  

Planned to be completed by 2012 an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle power plant (ISCC), will have 

a 472 MW capacity. Solar energy is to provide 20 MW of these 472 MW. In 2009 this utility, partly 

operative, produced 210 GWh (ONE, 2009). This plant is located in Ain Béni Mathar (eastern 

Morocco) and is to be co-financed by ONE, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the AfDB 

(ONE, 2009).

Oil Fired Power Plants 

There are several oil fired power plants in the country: the Mohammedia gas turbine (300 MW, 3 units 

x 100 MW), uses fuel oil number 2 as base fuel and produced 1684.8 GWh in 2008; the Kenitra power 

plant (300 MW, 4 units x 75 MW) which produced 1637.9 GWh in 2008 representing an evolution of 

88.5% relatively to 2007; the Tan Tan power plant (116.5 MW, 7 diesel units) which had a net 

production of 17.8 GWh in 2007; the Agadir power plant (72 MW, 4 diesel units x 18 MW) which had 

a net production in 2007 of 6.4 GWh; the Daklha power plant (21 MW, 3 Units) which has entered in 

service in May 2002 and consumes diesel. This facility net production in 2007 was of 42.9 GWh; the 

Laayoune power plant, in the Moroccan Sahara, which had a net production of 97.2 GWh in 2007; the 

Tit Mellil power plant net production in 2007 was 150 GWh; the Tetouan 33 power plant (47.7 GWh 

net production in 2007); the Tetouan 20 power plant (produced 0.6 GWh in 2007); and the Tanger oil 

power plant (3.2 GWh net production in 2007) (COMET, 2011) 

 

Renewable Energy Plants 

Wind 

In 2010 the wind-power capacity was 280 MW and consisted on the wind farms of Abdelkhalek 

Torres (50 MW) and Lafarge (30 MW) in Tetouan, on the Amogdoul (60 MW) in Essaouira and on 

the Tangier1 (140MW) (UNCCC, 2010). 

Morocco has started a vast wind energy program, to support the advance of renewable energy and 

energy efficiency in the country. The Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project will allow the country 

to increase the wind power installed capacity, from 280 MW to 2000 MW in 2020 (AMDI, 2011).  

The new wind energy farms (1720 MW) are planned as follow:  

- 720 MW under development in Tarfaya (300 MW), Akhfenir (200 MW), Bab El Oued-
Laayoune (50 MW), Haouma (50 MW) and Jbel Khalladi (120 MW) (AMDI, 2011).   

- 1000 MW planned in 5 new sites chosen for their abundant potential: Tanger 2 (150 MW), El 
BaidaKoudia in Tetouan (300 MW), Taza (150 MW), Tiskrad Laayoune (300 MW) and 

Boujdour (100 MW) (AMDI, 2011) (UNCCC, 2010).   

The main goals of the wind energy program are: raise the share of wind power in the country energy 

balance to 14% by 2020; reach a production capacity from wind power of 2 GW and a yearly 

production capacity of 6600 GWh; spare 1.5 million ton of fuel per annum, matching the sum of 750 

million U.S. dollars, and avoid of 5.6 million ton of CO2 emissions per year (AMDI, 2011).   

Solar  

At this time, solar energy in Morocco is mostly used in rural and off-grid areas but the country 

presents an extensive variety of investment opportunities in the sector of thermal and photovoltaic 

solar energy, including the launch of the succeeding structuring programs: 

- The Moroccan Project of Solar Energy that aims to reach 2000 MW of solar power capacity 
by 2020, over 10000 ha, within five locations (Table 5-9) (AMDI, 2011).   

Table 5-9- Capacity and projected annual power generation of the 5 plants (AMDI, 2011)

This program will increase by 14% the share of solar energy in total electricity capacity by 2020 and 

prevent the emission of 3.7 million tons of CO2 per year. Additionally, this project will avoid 1 million 

toe per year, corresponding to a 500 million dollars saving (ONE, 2009b).

(AMDI, 2011).   

This project includes the installation of 440000 m
2
 and 1.7 million m

2
 of thermal solar sensors in 2012 

and in 2020 respectively. By 2020, the thermal energy is projected to reach 1190 GWh/yr. This 

program will prevent the emission of 920000 tons of CO2 annually and generate 920 permanent jobs 

(AMDI, 2011).   

These two solar projects were planned to fall under the criteria of Clean Development Mechanism 

(CDM) (AMDI, 2011).   

Hydro 

At the end of 2009 the hydro-power installed capacity reached 1748 MW and consisted on hydro-

turbines (1284 MW) and on hydro-pumping (464 MW) (ONE, 2009). 

The country is focused on the development decentralized small hydropower projects for remote areas. 

Hydroelectric power does not automatically involve a large dam and some power plants use a small 

canal to channel river water through a turbine and several of these projects are now under progress by 

ADEREE.  

Changes in precipitation and surface runoff intensely affect the extent of hydroelectric power 

generated. The rainfalls can vary considerably from one year to another. Table 5-10 presents the 

country?s hydroelectric power plants net production between 2000 and 2008.

Biomass 

According to ONE, in 2020 the biomass capacity will be around 950 MW (corresponds to a 2 billion 

euro investment) (DOC DULCE) (MEMEE, 2008c). The Green Morocco strategy to boost agricultural 
production and new regulations for waste management stands for an additional 400 MW capacity by 

2030. In 2002 an U.S. consortium (GESI-Edgeboro-SADAT) won a government tender for the 

management of the first controlled landfill in Fes (MLRH, 2011). The 10 year contract of construction 

and operation of this landfill has been extended in 2007 for another 20 years to recover and reuse the 

biogas from the landfill allowing an estimated 3 MW generation that could be used for public lighting 

(ECOMED, 2011). 

 

Nuclear Power Plants 

The ONE ponders the nuclear power option as one of the feasible solutions to meet the future power 

demand of Morocco. In the beginning of the 1980s, the ONE commenced site and technical-economic 

viability assessments for the first nuclear power plant in the country in the framework of a settlement 

signed with SOFRATOME (French company), with the technical support of the International Atomic 

Energy Agency (IAEA) (IAEA, 2010). 

The site of Sidi Boulbra, located on the Moroccan Atlantic coast between the cities of Safi and 

Essaouira, was elected and qualified as a capable site to have a nuclear power plant under the 

necessary nuclear safety conditions. Sidi Boulbra site might take up to 4 units of 1000 MW each 

(IAEA, 2010). 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    56 

 

The Moroccan governmental strategy has intentions to introduce nuclear power by 2020-2025 (IAEA, 

2010).  

The national strategy concerning fuel exploration and radioactive waste management has not been 

decided so far as it depends on other several aspects, such as the reactor type and the viability of 

uranium extraction (IAEA, 2010). 

 

Combined Heat Power Plants 

Presently, there are no CHP plants in the country. 

Total Installed Capacity 

In 2005 the installed capacity totaled 5252 MW (Table 5-12). The 2005 thermal production is 

presented in table 5-13.

By the end of 2009 the installed capacity reached 6135 MW (Table) against the 5292 MW capacity 

recorded in 2008. This 15.9% increase has been due to the partial operation of the Ain Béni Mathar 

power plant (300 MW) and to the Tangier wind farm in (107 MW) and the operation of the diesel 

plant at Tan Tan (116 MW), the Mohammedia gas turbines (3x100 MW) and the hydro plant at 

Tanafnit (18 MW) (ONE, 2009). Table 5-14 presents the installed capacity by the end of 2009.

Note: 2008 data is forecasted 

The national production at the end of December 2009 was approximately 20935 GWh. This 

production satisfied about 84% of the electricity demand in that year. 

5.3.1.4 Electricity Transmission 

With a grid consisting of HV/VHV lines (60, 150, 225 and 400 kV) ONE is responsible for the power 

transmission (ONE, 2009). 

In order to sustain the rising power demand, the investments within the power sector from 1999 to 

2008, reached 53 billion DH, and have covered the PERG, the reinforcement of the production base, 

the development of the transportation network and the improvement of the distribution infrastructure 

(MEMEE, 2008). 

Between 1999 and 2008, the ONE continued its program for the reinforcement of the national 

transmission network which includes the interconnections with neighbour countries. These works aim 

to reinforce the reliability and the security of the transport network and the increase of trade with 

neighbour countries, with a view to the opening of the national electricity market to the competition 

and its integration in the Euro-Maghreb market. As a result, in this period, the works in the very high 

and high voltage transmission lines exceeded 4500 Km (MEMEE, 2008).  

Morocco has electrical interconnections with Spain and Algeria. The submarine electrical cable 

connection with Spain was established in 1997 and provides an exchange of 1400 MW. Morocco?s 

electricity network is connected with the networks of Algeria and Tunisia; these three countries 

formed the COMELEC (Comité Maghrébin de l’Electricité) in 1975 to promote electricity exchanges 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    58 

 

and they were later joined by Libya and Mauritania. The electrical grid interconnection with Algeria 

was established in 1992 and ensures 1200 MW (MEMME, 2008b). 

The reinforcement of the Morocco-Spain interconnection became necessary in order to allow an 

increase in the import capacity. The start of the operation of the 2nd interconnection between Morocco 

and Spain occurred in June 2006, allowing an increase in the import capacity to 700 MW. Morocco, 

owing to its special geographical position at the heart of an international energy crossroads is set to 

become a key hub of the increasing power exchange between the countries around the Mediterranean, 

thanks to the reinforcement of the interconnections it has established with Spain and Algeria. 

In 2009 the transmission network total length has reached 20350 km. Table 5-16 presents the recent 

transmission network developments.

Electric power transmission and distribution losses (% of output)

 
Figure 5-19 - Power transmission and distribution losses as % of output between 1993 and 2008 

(World Bank, 2011) 

In 2005 and 2008 the electric power transmission and distribution losses have been of 1837 GWh and 

2281 GWh, respectively (World Bank, 2011). 

5.3.1.5 Electricity Distribution 

Mainly the ONE and some private operators in the big cities of the country (LYDEC in Casablanca, 

REDAL in Rabat, AMENDIS in Tanger/Tetouan) are responsible for the power distribution. 

According to ONE, in 2008 the transport losses of its distribution grid were at 4.7% of the total 

injected electricity.

Electricity prices are subsidized both directly by transfers to cover operating costs and indirectly by 

low prices for fuel oil. The retail prices however are still relatively high by regional standards. The 

rates are set by ministerial decree. Table 5-17 presents the residential electricity prices. 

Table 5-17 - Residential electricity prices (RECREEE, 2010) 

Consumption per month Price Dh/kWh 

0 - 100 kWh 0.9010 

101 - 200 kWh 0.9689 

201 - 500 kWh 1.0541 

&gt; 500 kWh 1.4407 

 

Rural consumers are charged through a pre-paid meter system. The customer can purchase the wanted 

amount via rechargeable cards. The tariffs are distinguished in a different way, as shown in the table 

5-18. 

Table 5-18 - Residential electricity prices for rural consumers (RECREEE, 2010) 

Power bracket Price Dh/kWh 

Power less or equal to 1 kW  1.0700 

Power between 1 kW and 2 kW  1.1021 

Power between 2 kW and 3 kW  1.1449 

Power above 3 kW  1.3910 

 

Business customers are allowed to select from different tariff structures. For HV customers there is a 

choice between a tariff based on a subscribed capacity plus time-of-day unit charges or a tariff 

comprising three price options calculated according to the annual duration of power usage. The latter 

tariff is shown in the table 5-19.

5.3.1.6 Domestic Energy Resources 

Fossil Fuel Resources 

- Oil 

Though Morocco?s proven oil deposits are small (750000 barrels as of January 1st 2009), there is 

reasonable evidence that there could still be vast undiscovered oil (and gas) reserves (RECREEE, 

2010).Over the last years, Morocco has effectively pushed for the exploration of possible oil (and gas) 

deposits. A study carried out in 1999 indicated that the offshore basin nearby Tarfaya (near Morocco?s 

southern Saharan provinces) would be the most suitable area for oil reserves (RECREEE, 2010). The 

Gharb and the Essaouira basin as well as near the Rif, a mountainous region in the north of Morocco, 

are thought to be the most promising onshore regions. The Ireland?s oil company Circle Oil reported a 

successful drilling and testing of a gas well in the Gharb region northeast of Rabat.  



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    60 

 

Regarding oil shale, Morocco has the sixth largest proven reserves in the world. Morocco?s total in 

place oil shale reserves are estimated at around 50 billion barrels (as of 2006) (RECREEE, 2010). The 

major deposits, located near Tarfaya and Timahdit, are well explored and are the most probable to 

initiate commercial production in the near future. The Timahdit deposit, sited about 250 km southeast 

of Rabat zone, has an estimated 16.1 billion barrels of oil in place. Tarfaya contains about 22.7 billion 

barrels of oil.  

To become less dependent on energy imports and in order to diversify its primary energy sources 

Morocco has taken the first step headed for commercially exploring its oil shale reserves: for 2008-

2012 as part of the Plan Nationale des Actions Prioritaires (PNAP) the government plans to invest 

DH 32 million (US$2008 4.4 million) in the sector and is currently establishing a regulatory 

framework. There is also a pilot project for oil shale-based power generation ongoing in Tarfaya. 

In 2004 the main crude oil suppliers have been Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and Iraq. 

- Coal 

The country is heavily dependent on coal imports since the closure of the coal mine of Jerada in 2001. 

Coal is mainly imported from the United States, Colombia and South Africa (RECREEE, 2010). 
According to the National Energy Strategy 2020-2030 published in 2009 by the government, coal will 

continue to be the primary fossil fuel used for power generation in the next decades (RECREEE, 

2010). 

- Natural gas 

Identically to its oil reserves, Morocco?s proven natural gas reserves are small, around 1.5 billion m
3
 

as of January 1st 2009 (RECREEE, 2010). ONHYM supervises all natural gas related explorations, 
surveys and drillings. Considered as a strategic platform for energy transit, Morocco plays a major role 

in the transportation of gas from Algeria to Spain as the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline links the Hassi 

R?mel field in Algeria via Morocco with Spain where it feeds into the European gas grid. 

It is intended that the natural gas share in the TPES reach 20% until 2020. A LNG (liquefied natural 

gas) terminal will be built by 2015. It will have an initial capacity of 5 BCM; this option is to be 

realized if supply is secured. This LNG Terminal is planned to be at Jorf Lasfar (Atlantic coast) or 

Nador (Mediterranean Sea) – 5 BCM in 2015, 10 BCM in 2018 (MEMME, 2009). 

- Uranium 

Morocco has great quantities of uranium in its phosphates. This resource may well be useful in the 

future if viable competitive mechanisms are established for its extraction. The estimated availability of 

uranium in the Moroccan phosphates, according to IAEA's latest assessments, is of around 6.9 million 

ton (IAEA, 2010). 

 

 

Renewable Energy Resources 

- Wind 

Morocco has an excellent wind energy potential (of about 6000MW a year) mainly in the North, and 

in the South (MEMEE, 2008b). In Tangier and Tetouan, the annual average wind speed ranges 

between 9.5m/s and 11 m/s at 40 meters elevation. In Tarfaya, Taza and Dakhla the annual average 

wind speed ranges between 7.5 m/s and 9.5 m/s at 40 meters (MEMEE, 2010).  Between 2000 and 

2008, more than 50 measurement stations were installed by the Centre de Développement des Energies 

Renouvelables (CDER). Figure 5-20 presents the country?s wind map.

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    61 

 

 
Figure 5-20 - Morocco’s wind map (CDER, 2010)  

The country, given appropriate conditions, might possibly support a total capacity of around 6000 

MW a year (MEMEE, 2008b).  

- Solar 

Morocco possesses abundant solar resources. The annual sunshine averages 3000 hours, equivalent to 

an almost 5.3 kWh/m
2
/day potential (UNCCC, 2010). Figure 5-21 presents the country?s solar 

potential.

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    62 

 

- Geothermal  

There seems to be some geothermal potential in the northeast of the country and in the Sahara 

sedimentary basins (Figure 5-22). Currently, geothermal direct use is mainly limited to balneology, 

swimming pools and potable water bottling (DOC).

The biomass potential is based on ample agricultural resources, comprising wide areas for livestock 

breading (2.6 million cattle, 16.3 million sheep and 5.3 million goats).  

 

 

- Hydro 

There are potentially, 200 sites to explore for hydropower in the country (COMET, 2011) (MEMEE, 

2008b)  

- Ocean Energy (tidal and wave) 

In the medium term, some niche market might be present. 

5.3.2 Energy End-use Sectors 

5.3.2.1 Transport Sector 

The transport sector is a major energy consumer in Morocco (CIF, 2011). Figure 5-23 presents the 
energy consumption of the transport sector as % of the total final energy consumption from 2004 to 

2007.

Figure 5-23 - Energy consumption by the transport sector as % of total final energy consumption 

(Eurostat, 2010) 

In 2008, on a net calorific value basis, the transport sector consumed 3555 ktoe of oil products, and 93 

ktoe of electricity (IEA, 2011i).  

Energy consumption in the transport sector has increased approximately 5% per annum in recent 

years. Road transport is by far the main mode of transport, accounting for about 95% of all internal 

passenger transport volume, 70% of freight transport and 98% of the sector?s energy use (CIF, 2011). 

Table 5-20 presents the length of the main transport networks in 2000 and 2008.

It was estimated that around 420000 ton of gasoline and 2.2 million ton of diesel were consumed in 

2007 by the transport sector. Gasoline and diesel have been of reduced quality and around 30% to 

40% of the consumed gasoline in 2007 was leaded and about 95% of the consumed diesel had more 

than 10000 ppm of Sulphur. In 2009 the Government banned leaded gasoline and imposed firm norms 

on the diesel consumed in the transport sector, including a maximum Sulphur content of 50 ppm (the 

diesel 50 ppm replaced the diesel 350 in February 2009 and the ordinary diesel in April 2009) (World 

Bank, 2011a). 

Moroccan fuel prices are among the highest of the MENA region. The gasoline price is about 

US$1.35/liter and therefore includes a considerable net tax. The diesel price, at about US$0.9/liter is 

somewhat above the cost recovery level (World Bank, 2011a). 

Between 1993 and 2003, the number of cars in circulation increased by 36%. Aside from walking, 

travel in urban areas takes place predominantly in private cars and taxis. Consequently, rush hour 

travel conditions in urban areas are frequently problematic. The Urban Transport Master Plan has 

recognized that in Casablanca more than one-third of the intersections examined are presently very 

congested. Additionally, several indicators point to a substantial intensification in the rate of vehicle 

ownership (World Bank, 2011a). 

Table 5-21 presents the passenger cars (1000) average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2006 and 

the road goods vehicles (1000) average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2004.

- Rail infrastructure 

Table 5-22 presents the number of locomotives (include tractive railway vehicles with a power of 110 

kW and above at the draw hook equipped with prime mover and motor or with motor only used for 

hauling railway vehicles) and goods transport wagons (railway freight wagon normally intended for 

the transport of goods) in 2008.

- Airport infrastructure  

There are 24 airports in the country: 15 international airports, 6 domestic airports and 3 airports that 

serve as secondary platforms (COMET, 2011). Since the 2003 liberalization of air transport, the 

country has seen several low-cost companies entering the market, and Morocco?s signing of an open 

skies agreement with the EU in 2006 has furthered this trend. In 2007 the consumption of kerosene jet 

fuels reached 501000 toe (Eurostat, 2010).   

In 2002, 2008 and 2009 there were 22, 44 and 45 commercial airlines respectively (excluding low-cost 

airlines). In 2002 there were 91.3 thousands commercial flights and in 2008 there were 136.1 

thousands (COMET, 2011). 

- Maritime transport 

The country has 30 ports, 12 are commercial, 12 are dedicated fishing and 6 pleasure ports. Maritime 

transport accounts for 95% of Morocco?s foreign trade. Casablanca port is the major one and it 

handles nearly 36% of the country?s maritime traffic and approximately 86% of container traffic. The 

Tanger Med port is another key trade facility. The opening of its first terminal, conceded to APM 

Terminals Tangier, has been in July 2007. By the end of April 2008 this port had accommodated 

nearly 200 stopovers and treated nearly 275000 twenty-foot containers (COMET, 2011).

In 2008, on a net calorific value basis, the industrial sector consumed 1912 ktoe of oil products, 73 

Ktoe of combustible renewables and waste, 44 ktoe of gas, 35 Ktoe of coal and peat products and 710 

ktoe of electricity (IEA, 2011i). 

The energy demand in the industrial sector is concentrated in three main segments: cement, phosphates 

and sugar units. Their energy use is estimated to increase substantially in the upcoming decades, from 

around 1600 Mtoe in 2005 to 5200 Mtoe in 2030 (CIF, 2011). Table 5-24 presents a projection for the 

cement sector production and consumption development until 2030 (from the Second National 

Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change).

The mineral industry is a major source of revenue. Morocco has 75% of the world?s phosphate 

reserves, is the world?s leading exporter (28% of the global market) and the third-largest producer 

(20% of global production). Phosphate rock is mined in several regions of the country. The most 

actively mined area is Khouribga, which is the single largest producing phosphate mine in the world. 

The two open pit mining operations at Khouribga account for nearly 50% of all phosphate rock mined 

in the country. The reserves of phosphate rocks are estimated to be approximately 20 billion tons 

(GAA, 2008). The Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) has plans to intensify the production 

capacity significantly in the future. Increasing efficiency of the phosphate process will reduce net 

energy use and emissions. Table 5-25 presents the phosphate rock production in Morocco.

5.3.3 Greenhouse Gases Emissions      

5.3.3.1 Energy Related CO2 Emissions 

Between 2000 and 2006 the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion rose almost 35%; 5.2% per year to 

reach 39.8 million tons in 2006 (MEMME, 2009b). In 2006 the share of oil, coal and coal products, 

and natural gas on the emissions of CO2 was, approximately, 61%, 34% and 3%, respectively 

(MEMME, 2009b). 

The coal?s share in the total CO2 emissions in recent decades has increased, from 11% in 1980 to 34% 

in 2006. This upsurge is connected to the increase of coal consumption for power generation 

(MEMME, 2009b). 

 

 
Figure 5-29 - CO2 emissions from fuel combustion from 1971 to 2006 (Mt CO2 per year) (MEMME, 

2009b) 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    69 

 

The bulk of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion came from three sectors, as illustrated in Figure 

5-30: electricity and heat, transport and industry.  

 

 
Figure 5-30 – CO2 emissions by sector between 1971 and 2007 (MEMME, 2009b) 

The electricity and heat sector is the largest source of energy-related CO2 emissions. The CO2 

emissions from this sector have been rising substantially as a consequence of both sharp increases in 
demand and large continuous consumption of coal as the principal input fuel with a small share from 

RE sources (hydro and wind power). The transport sector is also very energy intensive and emits 

considerable CO2 quantities. From 1971 to 2007 the transport sector CO2 emissions, rose almost 500% 

and from 1997 to 2007 almost 50% which makes it the fastest-growing source of energy-related CO2 

emissions. In 2007, the CO2 emissions from this sector represented 25% of the total. The industrial 

sector emits large amounts of CO2 as well. Within this sector, the energy consumption and the CO2 

emissions are concentrated within the cement, phosphates and sugar units (MEMME, 2009b). 

Between 1971 and 2007 the CO2 emissions per capita almost tripled, going from 0.45 t per capita to 

1.3 t per capita, respectively. In the same period, the country?s CO2 emissions per each unit of GDP 

increased almost 50% (MEMME, 2009b). 

When compared against other countries, the CO2 intensity of the Moroccan economy is above average. 

Although Morocco has a relatively low level of energy intensity (measured per GDP or per capita), its 

extensive consumption of coal means that the CO2 emissions generated from each unit of energy 

produced and consumed are high (MEMME, 2009b). 

In 2006, the Moroccan CO2 emissions intensity was of 3.1 t CO2/toe versus a world average of 2.4 t 

CO2/toe. In the same year, for power generation, Moroccan CO2 intensity was of 0.86 t CO2/MWh 

versus a world average of 0.57 t CO2/MWh. However, the per capita CO2 emissions in Morocco were 

below world averages and below averages of all non-Annex 1 countries: in 2006, Morocco had 

emissions of about 1.31 tCO2 per capita against the world?s 4.28 tCO2/capita and the 2.44 tCO2/capita 

emissions of the non-Annex 1 countries (MEMME, 2009b). 

In 2008 the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion reached 42.09 Mt. Table 5-27 presents some key CO2 

emission indicators for 2008.

CO2/GDP (kg CO2/2000 USD) 0.76 

CO2/GDP (PPP) (kg CO2/2000USD) 0.25 

 

The CO2 emissions upward trend is attributable to both population and GDP development and in some 

cases, superior shares of fossil fuels in the energy supply mix.  

Figure 5-31 illustrates the different share of cement production, solid fuels, liquid fuels on carbon 

emissions and the total fossil fuel emissions in Morocco between 1989 and 2007.

waste, rice production, agricultural waste burning non energy, on-site, and savannah burning) as % of 

the total methane emissions in Morocco. Figure 5-32 also illustrates the energy related methane 

emissions (from the handling, transmission, and combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels) as % of total 

in the country.

activities, and livestock management in thousand metric ton of CO2 equivalent) in Morocco.  

 
Figure 5-34 - Moroccan nitrous oxide emissions (Trading Economics, 2011) 

Most of the nitrous oxide emissions come from fertilizer use (synthetic and animal manure), animal 

waste management, agricultural waste burning (non-energy, on-site) and savannah burning (Trading 

Economics, 2011). 

In 1995, 10 thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent of other GHG emissions (by-product emissions of 

hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) have been emitted in Morocco 

(Trading Economics, 2011). 

Figure 5-35 presents historical data for PM10 country level (micrograms per cubic meter). The 

estimates represent the average annual exposure level of the average urban resident to outdoor

5.4 Energy Policies  

The National Plan of Priority Actions (PNAP), currently underway, is the primary national strategy to 

pursue low carbon opportunities to achieve economic and social national objectives. The development 

of the PNAP was launched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on April 15, 2008. The PNAP 

represents a holistic approach to the country?s energy needs, seeking to enhance energy security and 

increase access, while at the same time lowering CO2 emissions. In a great number of cases, the 

actions included (e.g., increase in renewable energy and energy conservation) achieve all goals 

simultaneously (MEMEE, 2008) (CIF, 2009). Key objectives of this ambitious national program 

include a 600% increase in wind power to reach 20% of power generation and a 15% reduction in 

energy use in buildings, industry and transport by 2020 (CIF, 2009). 

The PNAP is a comprehensive national program representing the efforts and contributions of the ten 

major Ministries at the national level, among them: Ministry for Energy, Mines, Water and the 

Environment (MEMEE
14

), Ministry of Equipment and Transport, Ministry of Agriculture, and the 

Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies. It also holds formal partnerships with the 

ONE, ADEREE as well as local officials and municipalities. The PNAP procedures are to be 

implemented by 2012 (CIF, 2009). 

By March 2009, the “New energy strategy” was adopted, aiming to provide sufficient and reliable 

energy to the economy and to the population as well as to prevent any harmful effect on the 

environment stemming from energy supply and uses (UNCCC, 2010). These goals rest on five 

strategic axes:  

- Security of supply with diversification of fuel types and origins; 

- Access and availability of energy for all segments of society at reasonable prices; 

- Deployment of domestic energy sources, principally renewable, and the intensification of 
hydrocarbons exploration and oil shale valorisation; 

- Promotion of energy efficiency; and 

- Regional energy integration among the Euro-Mediterranean markets (UNCCC, 2010). 

                                                      

14
 The MEMEE is responsible for the development and implementation of government policy in the areas of 

energy, mines and geology and for the control of other sectors that depend on its authority.

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    73 

 

5.4.1 Energy Players 

The country?s energy industry is composed of public and private players. The National Mines and 

Hydrocarbons Authority is the main public authority in the energy sector. This Authority resulted from 

the merger of the following different public entities:  

- Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONYHM);  

- Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minières (BPRM);  

- Office National de l’Electricité (ONE); 

- and the National Agency for Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency 
(ADEREE

15
), former Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER) (AGICI, 

2011) (UNCTAD, 2011). 

The main private companies operational in the energy field are:  

- Moroccan Refining Company (SAMIR);  

- Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline Management Company (METRAGAZ);  

- Jorf Lasfar Energy Company (JLEC);  

- Tahaddart Electricity Company (EET);  

- Detroit Wind Energy Company (CED);  

- LYDEC;  

- REDAL; and 

- AMENDIS (AGICI, 2011). 

5.4.2 Market Structure 

The oil and gas sectors are controlled by the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM), 

a state-owned company established in 2005. ONHYM is an independent financially autonomous 

public institution; its activities are supervised by the state to guarantee compliance with the Act of 

Parliament under with which it was created, principally with regard to its tasks and functions, and to 

ensure the application of the law (Law 33-01) and regulations relating to public institutions in general. 

ONHYM is subject to financial supervision by the state, as applicable to public institutions (ONHYM, 

2011). 

The Moroccan oil refinery (Mohammedia) is operated by SAMIR, which is owned by the Saudi 

company Corral Petroleum (OBG, 2011). 

The country?s power generation, was formerly exclusively operated by the state owned ONE. Since 

the late 1990s, some independent private producers (JLEC, EET and CED) contribute to the national 

electric generation by supplying the power exclusively to ONE through Power Purchase Agreements. 

The ONE is responsible for the power transmission. The power distribution is mainly run by the ONE 

and some private operators in the big cities of the country (LYDEC in Casablanca, REDAL in Rabat 

and AMENDIS in Tanger/Tetouan) (IAEA, 2010). 

The Moroccan policy for power supply is drawn by the ONE and is submitted for approval to the 

Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (IAEA, 2010). 

                                                      

15
 ADEREE aims to contribute to the implementation of government policy on renewable energy and energy 

efficiency.

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    74 

 

5.4.3 Programs and Measures to Promote Renewable Energy 

Since the creation, in the early 1980s, of the CDER, which is now ADEREE, Moroccan governments 

have shown determination to promote RE (UNCTAD, 2011). 

Presently, the RE policy is in its generalized implementation stage with large renewable energy and 

energy efficiency programs, held by national and international institutions and banks (UNCTAD, 

2011). 

Morocco is developing RE with the objective to increase their share in the primary energy 

consumption to reach 12% in 2020 and more than 20% in 2030 (UNCCC, 2010). The country has the 

necessary resources to achieve these goals as its potential, mainly in solar and wind energy, is 

extensive and several strategies were drawn up to accelerate the implementation of utility-scale solar 

and wind projects (UNCCC, 2010).  

A vast Solar Power Program was launched in 2009, with the objective to achieve 2000 MW by 2020 

on five sites. The first 500 MW will be commissioned in 2015. This program is projected to prevent 

the emission of 3.7 million ton of CO2 per year and avoid 1 million toe of fossil fuels and electricity 

imports. The total project investment is evaluated in 9 billion US dollars (UNCCC, 2010). 

Additionally, the country launched the Development Program of the Moroccan market for solar water 

heaters (PROMASOL) that includes the installation of 440000 m
2
 and 1.7 million m

2
 of thermal solar 

sensors in 2012 and in 2020 respectively. The thermal energy is projected to reach 1190 GWh/yr by 

2020 and prevent the emission of 920 kton of CO2/yr (AMDI, 2011). 

To enhance the country?s capacity to successfully implement the solar projects the government 

created, in January 2010, two new institutions: the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (Agence 

Marocaine de l’Energie Solaire, MASEN) with the aim of conducting feasibility studies on particular 

technologies; and the Energy Investments Company (Société d’Investissements Energétiques, SIE) 

with the purpose of attracting and finance profitable private energy projects (UNCCC, 2010). 

Similarly, a Wind Power Program aiming to total 2000 MW by 2020 was launched. At present, 280 

MW are provided by existing wind farms, 720 MW are under development and 1000 MW will be built 

on five new sites. The goal of this project is to avoid 5.6 ton of CO2 emissions and 1.5 toe of energy 

imports. The whole cost of this project investment is estimated at 3.5 billion US dollars (UNCCC, 

2010). 

By 2020 the national installed capacity is projected to reach 14580 MW, according to the Minister of 

Energy, Mines, Water and Environment. Of this capacity, 42% is expected to be fulfilled by solar, 

wind and hydroelectricity, each representing 14%. Within the same period it is also projected that 

nuclear energy will contribute with about 7% of the installed capacity (UNCCC, 2010). 

5.4.4 Programs and Measures to Promote Energy Efficiency 

Energy efficiency is a key priority in Morocco?s strategy to minimize energy dependency and ensure 

its optimal consumption. The country?s goals are to perform energy savings between 12% and 15% in 

2020 and to expand it 20% by 2030 (UNCCC, 2010).  

In order to include energy efficiency in their regulatory frameworks, agreements were signed with the 

following strategic ministries: industry, transport, housing, agriculture, interior, and tourism along 

with regional bodies. 

Action plans have been set up in all main sectors such as the promotion of:  

- CHP and RE for power generation in industry; 

- Assistance to tertiary and residential sectors to moderate electricity consumption; 

- Improved modern public transportation and better management of urban traffic to lower 
personal vehicles use; 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    75 

 

- Standardization and normalization to help consumers to purchase clean and efficient energy 
equipment;   

- Efficient irrigation systems in agriculture, the use of biomass and solar energy for drying and 
refrigerating products to save energy and water; 

- Awareness campaigns for the large public and specific users to encourage the use of lower 
energy consumption equipment and household appliances and to encourage public 

transportation use; and 

- EE in building practices to enhance energy savings - Morocco has introduced a national 
program called “Energy Efficiency Codes in Residential Buildings and Energy Efficiency 

Improvement in Commercial and Hospital Buildings in Morocco”. This project is run by 

ADEREE and other institutional partners. The objective of the program is to launch 

mandatory minimum energy efficiency performance requirements by means of a building 

code. This is expected to help the country bring its own laws and regulations in line. The 

project comprises the development of guidelines for technicians and professionals in hospitals, 

hotels, services, and housing companies for the integration of solar water systems. 32 health 

centers, 8 hospitals, and hotels have been selected to serve as example objectives (STW, 

2011). 

To boost the implementation of the former plans, the country launched favourable conditions to 

stimulate national and foreign investors and operators. For better visibility of individuals or companies 

investing in the country, attractive legislative and regulatory texts were launched or are being enacted. 

Particular laws concerning renewable energies and energy efficiency supported by the creation of 

dedicated Agencies has been promulgated. An Energy Development Funds with 1 billion US dollars 

capital was launched to support RE and EE projects (AMDI, 2011).  

5.4.5 Climate Change 

Morocco ratified the major international conventions on the environment. In 1992, Morocco joined the 

UN?s Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, the Rio de Janeiro summit), which 

lead to numerous major agreements such as the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 

the Agenda 21, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN?s Framework Convention on 

Climate Change (UNFCCC), followed by the Johannesburg Summit in 2002 ( OBG, 2011). 

The kingdom was a signatory of UNFCCC in 1995 and of the Annex 2 of the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. 

Even though not obliged to reduce its carbon emissions, the country planned a legal framework to 

protect its environment and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The kingdom hosted the 

seventh Conference of the Parties in Marrakech (MEMEE, 2009) (OBG, 2011). 

In 2001 Morocco published its first National Communication to the UNFCCC and in 2010 the country 

published the second National Communication. 

Morocco introduced several climate change coping and mitigation mechanisms in many of its national 

plans as the reforestation of 50000 ha per year until 2014 (OBG, 2011). 

The kingdom embraced the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as an opportunity 

to attract investments in cleaner technologies. The Moroccan CDM portfolio arose from the first 

mitigation assessments comprised in Morocco?s First National Communication. These assessments led 

to the elaboration of a National Action Plan for the reduction of GHG emissions. From then on, the 

CDM portfolio has been improved and extended, within the framework of continuous and focused 

efforts. Morocco?s National Action Plan takes into account 25 projects, in view of an estimated 

evolution of GHG emissions in the country by 2020. The Plan and the projects consider national 

policies, programs, and strategies, as well as Morocco?s particular circumstance and conditions. The 

25 projects were planned by Government departments, involved public and private institutions, or 

have been set out in close cooperation with their managerial staff and officers. In 2006, the CDM 

portfolio comprised many projects with significant potential for reducing GHG emissions focused on

the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy, and on the reduction of energy waste 

(UNEP, 2011).  

5.4.6 Sustainable Development 

Since its participation in the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the country has been in the process of 

implementing the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and 

Development. As part of the application of these recommendations in 1992 and within the context of 

global sustainability and human development initiatives, Morocco established a new strategy based on 

an integrated approach to development (UNCTAD, 2011).  

By May 2003 Morocco introduced a law (Law 11-03) on the protection of the environment. This law 

provides general principles of national policy on environmental protection and among these principles 

is the integration of environmental concerns into all policies.  

Along with the PNAP and the “New Energy Strategy” to provide sufficient and reliable energy to the 

economy and to the population as well as to prevent any harmful effect on the environment stemming 

from energy supply and uses, Morocco has introduced other development strategies to achieve its 

environmental goals, namely: the National Strategy for Environmental Protection and Sustainable 

Development, the implementation of the Plan for the Environment (PANE), the 2020 Strategy for rural 

Development, and the introduction of the National Initiative for Human Development (NIHD) 

(UNCTAD, 2011). 

In 2009, determined to approach the challenges of protecting its environment, the kingdom drafted the 

National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development (OBG, 2011) (UNCTAD, 2011).

6 Final Remarks 

The future is naturally uncertain and always will be. Trends in economic growth (and therefore energy 

use and related emissions of CO2) and technology development are difficult to predict. Still, concerns 

about energy security, the need to meet the predictable growing demand of energy and the threat of 

climate change, all pose major challenges to energy decision makers in Morocco.   

One thing is certain: to reduce energy related CO2 emissions worldwide and in Morocco specifically, 

there is no single solution; instead, a wide range of solutions is necessary and it will involve different 

choices by numerous stakeholders. 

The IEA and the international community in general agree that Energy Efficiency improvements, the 

increase of Renewable Energy deployment, Nuclear Power and CCS technologies are central options 

within a portfolio to achieve the necessary sustainability targets in the most cost-effective way. In 

Morocco, all of these options are being considered, including CCS within the COMET project.  

Even disregarding the output data provided from the TIMES modeling of the Moroccan energy 

system, it is possible to draw some general considerations - as to the CCS option for Morocco - based 

on the information collected to run the model itself. Such considerations will be discussed within the 

following paragraphs.  

As by 2020 the national power installed capacity is projected to reach 14580 MW and 42% of this 

capacity is anticipated to be fulfilled by solar, wind and hydroelectricity, each representing 14%; and 

since it is also projected that nuclear energy will contribute with about 7% of the installed capacity;, 

this means that, in this scenario, fossil fuels and biomass will have to fulfill 51% of the installed 

capacity (Figure 6-1) and account for approximately 7436 MW in 2020 which corresponds to a 78% 

increase in the thermal installed capacity relatively to 2009 (4166 MW).

Figure 6-1– Projected installed capacity by 2020 

In this scenario, the power sector in Morocco will continue to be highly dependent on fossil fuels. The 

perspective that the thermal installed capacity is to be substantially expanded within the following 

years and the fact that coal is expected to continue to be the primary fossil fuel for power generation in 

the next decades (according to the National Energy Strategy 2020-2030 published by the government 

in 2009) reinforces the necessity to consider CCS technologies for decarbonizing the power sector to 

some extent. This may imply the retrofitting of the existing units of the larger power plants like the 

Jorf Lasfar (JLEC) with CCS technologies, or the introduction of these technologies within the 

projected new units of Jorf Lasfar or within new facilities such as that of Safi.  

Based on the information collected, within the industrial sector, the cement subsector also represents a 

significant opportunity for CCS deployment since the cement production is expected to grow 244% 

between 2010 and 2030 and that this is already the industrial largest source of CO2 emissions in the 



Morocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage 

Rita da Penha Gonçalves Pereira Machado    78 

 

country. Additionally, the IEA considers CCS technologies to be the main solution to achieve deep 

emission cuts within the cement industry.  

Still, capturing CO2 is an emerging technology within the power sector, not yet demonstrated on a 

commercial scale and CO2 capture technologies for the cement industry are not likely to be 

commercially available before 2020, since, before then, further research and pilot tests are required to 

gain practical experience with these technologies, according to the IEA. 

Yet, undoubtedly, if CCS technologies are to be part of the country?s CO2 emission reduction portfolio 

in the future - along with the projected EE improvements and further RE deployment - several 

challenges must be overcame in view of both the current CCS technologies intrinsic downsides (such 

as EE penalties, additional costs and the fact that these technologies are not entitled as CDM project 

activity) and the Moroccan circumstances. 

For instance, if CCS technologies are to be deployed in the country: 

- The fact that currently Morocco is not obliged to reduce its carbon emissions by any means 
suggests that the introduction of appropriate economic incentives such as tax treatment or 

other mechanisms are to play an extraordinary role;  

- There is value in creating a regulatory, legal and accounting framework for CCS in Morocco, 
since at present there is no framework for regulating CCS projects in the country. Indeed, 

investments in these technologies will only occur if there are adequate financial incentives 

and/or regulatory mandates;  

- Given the scale of investment required to deploy CCS, the country ought to foster 
international co-operation in order to decrease projects costs; and  

- The Moroccan government should dedicate resources to disseminate information since public 
outreach is critical. 

 

MARKAL/TIMES outputs 

It is important to remark that to run the model several assumptions had to be made, owing to the 

unavailability of some important data and lack of time, which means that an ongoing process to collect 

data and improve the model is required for better insights.  

On the supply side, missing input data includes, among others, detailed information on the actual 

available potential of biomass for power generation.  

On the demand side, missing input data includes information on, among others:  

- The number of houses with air conditioning; 

- The number of square meters for commercial activities and this sector energy consumption by 
type of fuel; 

- The energy consumption trend of the cement and phosphate industries as well as the type of 
fuel consumed by the different industrial activities; and 

- Load curve profiles for several months. 

After the submission of the input data, for the first modeling, important missing data has been 

identified. This data will be used to improve the model later in the project. It includes the following 

information: 

- Wind technical potential (estimated to total 25000 MW); 

- 200 feasible micro hydro power projects (ranging from 15 to 100 kW).

7 Conclusions 

The energy demand in Morocco has rapidly increased over the last years. This upward trend is 

expected to continue in the coming decades, driven by a strong economic development and increasing 

population. As the energy demand is expected to grow, increasing concerns over energy security and 

environmental sustainability issues arise in Morocco. Indeed, it is estimated that by 2020, the primary 

energy and electricity consumption will double compared to their level in 2008 and that by 2030 these 

consumptions will be three and four times greater, respectively. 

In the seventies the power sector depended on a considerable extent on hydroelectricity. However, 

from then on, the Moroccan power supply has been consistently heavily based on fossil fuels, and as 

there are limited fossil energy sources available within the country, Morocco is extremely dependent 

on energy imports and is the largest energy importer of North Africa. In 2008, the Moroccan net 

energy import amounted to 96%.  

Alongside its energy demand growth, the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion have also 

increased. In fact, the Moroccan CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion have more than doubled 

between 1995 and 2008 reaching, by then, 49.09 Mt.      

Conversely to its fossil fuels unavailability, Morocco possesses substantial domestic unexploited 

Renewable Energy Sources, mainly solar and wind energy.  

In order to sustain the on-going energy demand upsurge, decrease its exposure to international 

volatility commodity prices, improve its energy trade balance and reduce its energy related 

environmental impacts, Morocco has introduced several strategies in order to boost the deployment of 

Energy Efficiency measures within several sectors and increase the penetration of Renewable Energy 

within its energy supply portfolio.  

National targets are to perform energy savings between 12% and 15% in 2020 and to expand it to 20% 

by 2030 as well as to increase the share of Renewables in the primary energy supply mix to reach 12% 

in 2020 and more than 20% in 2030. The Nuclear Power option is also being discussed by the 

Moroccan government as a future possibility for cleaner power generation.  

The Moroccan thermal generation capacity is estimated to expand 78% until 2020, in relation to 2009 

and coal is expected to continue to be the primary fossil fuel for power generation in the next decades. 

Within the industrial sector, the cement, phosphates and sugar units – the most energy and CO2 

emission intensive units in this sector – are expected to more than triple their energy use in 2030 in 

relation to 2005.  

In view of such factors, it seems reasonable to at least consider debating the CCS option to 

decarbonise, on some extent in the future, the Moroccan power and industrial sectors. Will CCS - 

along with EE improvements, greater penetration of RES in the TPES - be a viable solution for 

Morocco within the future?  

As it is known, advancing towards a low carbon future, in the most cost-effective way, requires a 

weighing of the different CO2 abatement options available and a far-sighted approach. This means that 

the CCS option must be weighed against other carbon abatement options such as EE improvements, 

further RES penetration and nuclear deployment since each of these options entails a distinctive set of 

co-benefits, costs and risks that must be considered. Indeed, other things being equal, if one option is 

to bear a lighter burden, others will be required to do proportionately if Morocco is to effectively 

respond to the risks of climate change without compromising its economic development.   

The COMET project - which goal is to study the techno-economic feasibility of integrating CO2 

transport and storage infrastructures in the West Mediterranean region – will provide some insights 

concerning the possibility of deploying CCS technologies in Morocco in the future in an integrated 

approach.  

In view of the COMET project, one thing is acknowledge beforehand: a CCS integrated approach, 

compared to a standalone CCS project in one of the three countries involved, implicates 

interoperability issues but results in economic advantages and other benefits.

8 Future Work 

As previously stated, to run the model, several assumptions have been made, owing to the 

unavailability of some important data and lack of time due to COMET project commitments. 

Therefore, within the context of the COMET project and the modeling of the Moroccan energy 

system, future work includes the gathering and introduction of important missing input data in order to 

improve the model so as to better weigh alternative courses of actions in an integrated approach.
