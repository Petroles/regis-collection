Abstract 

 

Sunken parcels of macroalgae, wood and whale carcasses provide important oases 

of organic enrichment at the deep-sea floor, but sediment community structure and 

succession around these habitat islands are poorly evaluated. We experimentally 

implanted parcels of kelp and wood falls nearby a 30-ton deep-sea whale-fall at 1670 m 

in the Santa Cruz Basin (SCr; NE Pacific). At each organic island, we aimed to evaluate 

patterns of organic enrichment and spatial and temporal patterns of macrofaunal 

community structure and succession over time scales of 0.25 to 7y. Additionally, species 

overlap between kelp-, wood- and whale-falls with nearby cold-seep communities were 

investigated. In general, the abundance of infaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated at 

periods of intense organic enrichment at all organic falls, with decreased macrofaunal 

diversity and evenness within 0.5 meters of the falls. At kelp and wood falls opportunistic 

species and sulfide tolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after the 

peak of sedimentary enrichment (0.25y and 1.8y, respectively), while the whale-fall 

macrofauna was highly abundant from 4.5 to 6.8 y, and was dominated by enrichment 

opportunist, chemoautotrophic-symbiont-hosting and heterotrophic species grazing 

sulfur-oxidizing bacterial mats. Sediments around kelp and wood parcels provided low-

intensity reducing conditions, which sustain a limited chemoautotrophically-based fauna, 

with low levels of species overlap among other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE 

Pacific. Whale-fall sediments harbor many species and trophic types not present in 

background sediments, but there were low levels of species overlap between the whale-

fall, cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, explained by differences in biogeochemistry and 

food webs among these habitats. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around 

kelp, wood and whale-falls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and 

evolution of species dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea 

floor and contribute to regional and global diversity in deep-sea ecosystems.

Resumo 

Parcelas orgânicas de macroalgas, madeira e carcaças de baleia criam importantes 

oasis de enriquecimento orgânico no assoalho marinho de regiões profundas, mas a 

estrutura e sucessão ecológica da macrofauna sedimentar ao redor destes ambientes ainda 

é pouco conhecida. Parcelas de macroalgas e madeira foram artificialmente implantadas 

próximas a uma carcaça de baleia de 30-ton hà uma profundidade de 1670 m na Bacia de 

Santa Cruz, Pacífico NE. Ao redor de cada ilha orgânica, foram estudados os padrões 

espaciais e temporais de enriquecimento sedimentar orgânico e a estrutura e sucessão 

temporal da macrofauna em escalas temporais que variam de 0.25 à 7 anos. Ainda, o 

nível de sobreposição entre espécies colonizadoras das parcelas orgânicas e na baleia, 

foram comparados com comunidades de exudações frias (uma localizada na bacia de São 

Clemente, Pacífico NE) e fontes hidrotermais. Em geral, a abundância da macrofauna 

sedimentar foi altamente elevada em períodos de intenso enriquecimento orgânico, com 

decréscimo da diversidade da macrofauna num raio de 0.5 metros das parcelas. Nas 

parcelas de macroalgas e madeira, espécies oportunistas e tolerantes à sulfetos atingiram 

altas densidades após o pico de enriquecimento orgânico sedimentar (0.25 e 1.8 anos, 

respectivamente), enquanto que ao redor da carcaça de baleia, a macrofauna foi também 

dominada por organismos quimiossintéticos com associações simbióticas bacterianas, e 

ainda espécies oportunistas que se alimentavam do abundante carpete bacteriano sobre a 

superfície sedimentar. Os sedimentos ao redor das parcelas de macroalgas e madeira 

sustentam baixas taxas de degradação microbiana e sulfeto intersticial, recrutando assim 

um limitado número de organismos quimioautotróficos e consequentemente com baixa 

sobreposição de espécies com outros ambientes redutores. Na carcaça de baleia, os 

sedimentos sustentam intensa degradação microbiana e altos níveis de sulfeto, mas 

diferenças marcantes nas biogeoquímica e nas cadeias tróficas presentes nestas carcaças 

resultam em baixa sobreposição de espécies com a fauna de exsudações frias e fontes 

hidrotermais. Conclui-se que sedimentos enriquecidos organicamente ao redor de 

macroalgas, madeiras e carcaças de baleia criam importantes hábitats para a persistência 

e evolução de espécies dependentes de condições sedimentares redutoras, e assim estas 

ilhas devem contribuir para a diversidade regional e global dos ecossistemas de mar 

profundo.

Chapter 1. Introduction 

 

Communities living at the deep-seafloor are directly affected the export of 

organic matter from the ocean’s surface to depths, which significantly affects the 

structure and dynamics of deep-sea benthic ecosystems (Gage &amp;amp; Tyler 1991, Smith et 

al. 2008). Some special exceptions are found at cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, 

where chemosynthesis is a major process fueling local communities (Tunnicliffe 

1988, Levin 2005). Therefore, the typical deep-sea benthos are dependent on a low 

flux rate of organic matter (e.g. phytoplankton detritus), which is partially decayed 

during its long and sluggish sink the deep-sea floor (Gage &amp;amp; Tyler 1991). However, 

the export of food to the sea bottom does not always occur at a slow pace and in some 

regions of the world’s oceans, seasonal bursts in primary production give rise to 

massive exports of particulate organic material that settles rapidly to the sea bottom 

(Billett et al. 1983, Beaulieu 2002).  

Although settling of pelagic organic matter may largely contribute to the bulk 

of energy that is available to deep-sea ecosystems, the massive episodic deliveries of 

labile organic carbon to these ecosystems are also important (Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 

1982, Smith 1985, Rice &amp;amp; Lambshead 1994). Macroalgae, terrestrial plants debris, 

and carcasses of pelagic animals occur at variable temporal and spatial scales 

(Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987). Woody and macroalgal 

debris are frequently deposited on continental slopes through physical or biological 

processes. Kelps can be released from the coastal zone during storms, high swell 

events, and from herbivory (Duggins et al. 1989, Harrold et al. 1998). Kelp and wood 

debris can then be concentrated and transported to depths in submarine canyons to 

form enormous accumulations of organic material in the deep ocean (Vetter 1994, 



 

 

2 

Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998, 1999, McLeod &amp;amp; Wing 2007). Wood and kelp parcels also 

float out to sea, sinking as individual parcels spanning a broad range of sizes (1 - 

&gt;200 kg) to the seafloor (Wolff 1979). Carcasses of nektonic animals (e.g. fishes, 

dolphins and whales) are additional sources of energy to the deep sea as they provide 

fresh organic material into a food-poor environment (Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith 

1985, 1986, Smith &amp;amp; Demopoulos 2005). Although the flux of whale-detritus is not as 

quantitatively significant as the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to deep-

sea oceans, dead whales sink as enormous organic-rich packages that disturb a very 

limited area of the sea-bottom (Smith 2006). For example, the seabed immediately 

underlying a typical whale fall (i.e. roughly 50 m2), can experience the equivalent of 

2000 yr of background POC flux in a single pulse of organic enrichment (Smith &amp;amp; 

Baco 2003). Consequently, whale carcasses provide an immense and very rich source 

of labile organic matter to the food limited deep-sea ecosystems. 

Organic falls are important sources of disturbance to benthic communities 

nearby continental margins and in the deep-sea (Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith 

1985, 1986, Smith et al. 1998). As the scavenging and decaying of the organic falls 

take place, organic detritus [i.e. particulate organic carbon (POC)] is released into the 

surrounding sediments providing food for the infauna (Turner 1977, Wolff 1979, 

Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987). The spatial succession 

along organic-enrichment gradients exhibits very low diversity and extremely high 

densities of “opportunistic” species in disturbed areas, with moderate macrofaunal 

enhancement and species diversity at intermediate distances, and very low 

abundances and high diversity in the background community (Pearson &amp;amp; Rosenberg 

1978, Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Consequently, the type and the 

magnitude of the organic enrichment will create distinct responses by the benthic 



 

 

3 

fauna. The organic enrichment attracts organisms through both numerical (e.g., 

reproduction of opportunistic species) and functional responses (e.g., omnivores and 

scavengers), thus modifying the structure of natural deep-sea communities (Grassle &amp;amp; 

Grassle 1974, Pearson &amp;amp; Rosenberg 1978). High levels of organic disturbance may 

additionally promote intense microbial decomposition, depletion of pore-water 

oxygen and increase levels of sulfides in the sediments (Boetius &amp;amp; Lochte 1996, 

Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2003). Reducing sediments around organic islands 

attracts sulfophilic organisms that are capable of deriving carbon from 

chemosynthetic symbiosis and are adapted to survive in low oxygen sediments (Fisher 

1999, Dubilier et al. 2008). 

Whale skeletons generate and sustain organic-rich conditions for years in the 

deep-sea. The broad range of ecological niches present at whale carcasses attracts 

organisms not found on background areas, including whale-fall “specialists” and 

heterotrophic opportunists (Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). The 

creation of hard substrata for marine invertebrates also attracts dense assemblages of 

megafaunal animals, including fish and invertebrates (Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998, 1999).  

Wood and kelp falls also attract their own set of specialists, including wood-boring 

bivalves which degrade the wood matrix as they grow (Turner 1973). Consequently, 

organic patches open new areas for colonization of rare, opportunistic and specialist 

species, and have the potential to increase species richness locally. The role of organic 

patches in increasing deep-sea diversity has been raised decades ago, but studies well 

designed to address this hypothesis are scarce (Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002). The 

comparison of community structure and succession at distinct food parcels can help 

elucidate the contribution of organic falls for beta diversity (i.e. regional scale) in the 

deep sea. The long-term comparisons of community structure also allow identifying 



 

 

4 

levels of species overlap among distinct types organic and sulfide enrichments, such 

as around whale-, wood- and kelp falls and cold seeps.  

The present study will look at community structure and succession at 

artificially deployed parcels of wood, kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and a large whale-

fall; and also investigate the San Clemente cold-seep macrofauna, which are all at 

similar depths on the California continental slope (Figure 1.1). This study will focus 

at the sediment macrofauna at each site and patterns of sediment organic and sulfide 

enrichment will be used to help explain ecological patterns at spatial and temporal 

scales. Through the comparison and characterization of community structure and 

succession at a variety of reducing habitats and organic islands on the southern 

California slope (cold seeps, whale-, kelp- and wood-falls) we expect to test the 

following general hypothesis: 

  

i) Kelp, wood, and whale falls produce highly distinct time courses of 

sediment organic loading, which create distinct patterns of community succession; 

ii) Kelp- and wood-fall communities are less diverse than background 

sediments and host a smaller set of specialized fauna compared to whale-fall 

communities; 

iii) Whale-fall sediment communities increase local species diversity but share 

a small proportion (&lt;20%) of species with assemblages at southern California seeps, 

kelp falls and wood falls at similar ocean depths. 

 iv) The San Clemente seep macrofaunal sediment community contains few 

specialized species, and exhibits similar levels of diversity to background sediments;

Chapter 2. Macrofaunal succession in sediments around kelp 

and wood falls in the deep NE Pacific and community overlap 

with other reducing habitats 
 

 
 
Abstract 
 
 
Sunken parcels of macroalgae and wood provide important oases of organic 

enrichment at the deep-sea floor, yet sediment community structure and succession 

around these habitat islands are poorly evaluated.  We experimentally implanted 100-

kg kelp falls and 200 kg wood falls at 1670 m depth in the Santa Cruz Basin to 

investigate (1) macrofaunal succession, and (2) species overlap with nearby whale-fall 

and cold-seep communities over time scales of 0.25 to 5.5 y. The abundance of 

infaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated after 0.25 and 0.5 y near kelp parcels with 

decreased macrofaunal diversity and evenness within 0.5 meters of the falls. 

Apparently opportunistic species (e.g., two new species of cumaceans) and sulfide 

tolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after 0.25 -0.5 y. At 

wood falls, opportunistic cumaceans become abundant after 0.5 y, but sulfide tolerant 

species only became abundant after 1.8 - 5.5 y, in accordance with the much slower 

buildup of porewater sulfides at wood parcels compared to kelp falls. Species 

diversity decreased significantly over time in sediments adjacent to the wood parcels, 

most likely due to stress resulting from intense organic loading of nearby sediments 

(up to 20-30% organic carbon). Dorvilleid and ampharetid polychaetes were among 

the top-ranked fauna at wood parcels after 3.0 - 5.5 y. Sediments around kelp and 

wood parcels provided low-intensity reducing conditions, which sustain a limited 

chemoautrotrophically-based fauna. As a result, macrobenthic species overlap among 

kelp, wood, and other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE Pacific are primarily 

restricted to apparently sulfide tolerant species such as dorvilleid polychaetes, 

opportunistic cumaceans, and juvenile stages of chemosymbiont containing 

vesicomyid bivalves. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around wood 

falls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of 



 10 

species dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea floor and 

contribute to ? and ? diversity in deep-sea ecosystems.    

 

 

2.1. Introduction 

 

Plant remains such as wood and macroalgal debris have long been known 

from  the deep-sea floor and the fossil record, with first reports dating from The 

Challenger expedition (Wolff 1979, Kiel &amp;amp; Goedert 2006).  Deep-sea imaging and 

trawl studies suggest that wood and macroalgal falls occur widely on the ocean floor 

(Wolff 1979, Pailleret et al. 2007). Woody and macroalgal debris are frequently 

deposited on continental slopes through physical or biological processes. For 

example, kelp is released from the coastal zone during storms, high swell events, and 

from herbivory (Duggins et al. 1989). Kelp and wood debris can be concentrated and 

transported to depths in submarine canyons to form enormous accumulations of 

organic material in the deep ocean (Vetter 1994, Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998, 1999, 

McLeod &amp;amp; Wing 2007). Wood and kelp parcels also float out to sea, sinking as 

individual parcels spanning a broad range of sizes (1 - 1000 kg) to the seafloor (Wolff 

1979, Smith 1983, C. Smith personal observations during &gt;100 submersible and 

remotely operated vehicle dives off California and Hawaii). 

It is long recognized that food falls at the deep-sea floor can contribute to beta 

diversity in deep-sea by creating patches of organic enrichment and chemical or 

physical disturbance (Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith &amp;amp; Hamilton 1983, Smith 1985, 

1986, Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002).  However, patterns 

of succession resulting from the arrival of kelp and wood falls, and the identity of 

their characteristic species remain essentially unstudied along the bathyal Californian 

slope. Such information is essential to understanding the recycling of different types 



 11 

of organic parcels (e.g., sunken kelp paddies, logs) on the continental slope and their 

roles in maintaining biodiversity in the deep northeast Pacific (Snelgrove et al. 1992, 

Snelgrove et al. 1996, Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002).  

The effects of small-scale, low intensity disturbances on deep-sea infaunal 

communities, resulting from algal enrichment and scavenger disturbance, have been 

evaluated in a number of deep-experiments; these disturbances produce modest 

increases on species diversity (Levin &amp;amp; Smith 1984, Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002). 

However, substantial organic enrichment of deep-sea sediments (e.g., from 

macroalgae, wood falls, diatom detritus, and whale falls) can cause dramatic 

population enhancement of opportunistic and sulfophilic species (e.g. capitellid and 

dorvilleid polychaetes, leptostracans and cumaceans; (Turner 1977, Smith 1986, 

Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove et al. 1994, Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp;amp; 

Baco 2003). Community patterns in organic-rich sediments around whale falls 

resemble the classic spatial succession described along organic-enrichment gradients 

in shallow-water [e.g., (Pearson &amp;amp; Rosenberg 1978)] with very low diversity and 

extremely high densities of opportunistic polychaetes species adjacent to the whale 

fall, moderate macrofaunal enhancement and species diversity at intermediate 

distances, and low abundances and high diversity in the background community 

(Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). During later stages of succession, deep-sea 

whale falls also support substantial assemblages of animals with chemoautotrophic 

endosymbionts, producing reducing habitats ecologically similar to vents and seeps 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2009). 

  Large wood and kelp parcels also have the potential to produce intense 

organic enrichment and reducing habitats in deep-sea sediments. Deep-sea wood falls 

are initially processed by wood-boring xylophagainae bivalves (Turner 1977, Wolff 



 12 

1979, Distel &amp;amp; Roberts 1997, Turner 2002, Voight 2007b) which may broadcast 

organic-rich fecal material onto surrounding sediments (Turner 1977), potentially 

creating organic and sulfide-rich sediments. The breakdown of large kelp 

accumulations at the deep-sea floor also has the potential to create organic and 

sulfide-rich sediment patches against an oligotrophic background (Vetter 1994, 1996, 

Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998). 

While deep-sea wood and kelp falls are common on regional scales, temporal 

patterns of infaunal community succession around large wood and kelp parcels 

remain very poorly studied.  Thus, the contribution of wood- and kelp-fall 

communities to beta diversity in the deep sea, and their relationship to deep-sea 

reducing assemblages (e.g., vent, seep and whale-fall communities) cannot be 

evaluated.  In this study, we investigated macroinfaunal structure for over 5 years 

around experimentally implanted kelp and wood parcels in the bathyal NE Pacific to 

test the following hypotheses:   

1) Large wood and kelp falls exhibit distinct patterns of infaunal macrobenthic 

community succession, promoting beta diversity in the deep sea;  

2) There is little species overlap between sediment communities around large 

wood and kelp parcels and other reducing habitats (whale falls, seeps and 

vents) at similar depths in the deep sea. 

 

2.2. Materials and Methods 

Study site, deployments and sampling 

 

Experimental implantations of kelp and wood parcels were conducted near 

well-studied whale falls off southern California (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003) (Fig. 1.1). In 



 13 

particular, wood and kelp parcels were implanted on the flat sediment-covered floor 

of Santa Cruz Basin (SCrB), California (~33° 27’ N, 119° 22’W, 1670 m depth, 

bottom temperature ~4°C, bottom-water oxygen concentration 260 µM (Treude et al. 

2009). 

Four parcels of wood and kelp were experimentally deployed at a mean water 

depth of 1670 m in the SCrB (Fig. 1.1, point A; Table 2.1), approximately 100 m 

from an experimental 30-ton whale carcass (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2009). 

Wood parcels were deployed in October 1999 and May 2002 (Table 2.1). Kelp 

parcels were deployed in May 2002 and July 2002 (Table 2.1). Each kelp parcel 

consisted of ~100 kg (4-5 whole plants) of fresh Macrocystis pyrifera contained in a 

5-cm stretch mesh nylon net bag with one kelp holdfast protruding from the bag to 

facilitate sampling of kelp associated fauna; Fig. 2.1). The wood parcels consisted of 

~200 kg of untreated Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) with four small, 2-kg wood 

packages inside a 2.5-cm stretch mesh nylon net bags attached to the upper surface 

(Fig. 2.1).

SCrB for two years.  Small wood packs inside 2.5cm mesh net nylon bags are attached on the

 14 

Kelp and wood parcels were sampled using the Remotely Operated Vehicle 

(ROV) Tiburon during three cruises on board of the RV Western Flyer (Table 2.1). 

Kelp parcels were sampled at 0.25 and 0.5 years after deployment, while wood 

parcels were sampled at 0.5, 1.8, 3 and 5.5 y after deployment (Table 2.1). Sampling 

occurred around distinct parcels for each time interval; because parcels were located 

within several hundreds meters of one another on the homogenous basin floor, we 

assumed that all fall types were bathed in the same larval pool, i.e., location effects 

were modest compared to treatment effects.  At all sites, three randomly located 

transects radiating outward from the treatment were sampled, collecting tube cores (7 

cm diameter, 10 cm deep) at 0 m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 2.0 m from the parcel. 

Background samples (17 replicate tube cores) were additionally collected in 2002, 

2004 and 2005 at random locations of 9-100 meters away from any parcel, allowing 

averaging of temporal patterns in the background Santa Cruz Basin. Tube cores were 

immediately sectioned into 0-1, 1-5 and 5-10 cm horizons and fixed in 4% buffered 

formaldehyde-seawater solution until laboratory analysis, or frozen at -20oC for 

organic carbon analysis in laboratory.

community succession on several time scales. Background cores were collected at three 
different cruises (see text).

Laboratory and data analysis 

 

 In the laboratory, macrobenthic samples were sieved on a 300-µm sieve, 

stained with Rose Bengal, sorted and identified to the lowest attainable taxonomic 

level. Metazoan trophic group classification was made according to (Kukert &amp;amp; Smith 

1992). Sediment samples for organic carbon and nitrogen analysis were acidified to 

remove carbonates by repeated additions of sulfurous acid (8 % v/v) until no 

effervescence was observed (Verardo et al. 1990) and then analyzed using a Perkin-

Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer, with a limit of detection of 1 mg and 1.2 mg 

for C and N, respectively, while the precision was 0.3 % and 0.4 % for C and N, 

respectively. CHN standards were made with acetanilide and blanks were made of 

both non-acidified and acidified cups, both giving minor signals of TOC and TN. 

A few top-ranked macrofaunal organisms at representative stages of 

community succession on kelp and wood parcels were selected for stable isotope 

analysis. Individuals were sorted using methanol-cleaned forceps and specimens were 

rinsed and cleaned in DI water. Calcareous shelled organisms were decalcified with 

phosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 ºC). 

Multiple individuals of single species were combined in one sample to make up the 

necessary dry weight of 0.5-2 mg for analysis. Samples were combusted in a 

Eurovector elemental analyzer and resulting N2 and CO2 gases were separated by gas 

chromatography and admitted into an IRMS mass spectrometer for determination of 



 16 

15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: ±0.5 ‰ for ?15N and ±0.2 ‰ for ? 13C). 

Macrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured against a Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) 

standard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for ?15N. Results are expressed as delta (?) 

notation representing the relative difference between sample and standard, where ?X 

(‰) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x 103, where R=15N/14N or R=14C/13C.  

Macroinfaunal organisms were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, potentially 

introducing artifacts in stable isotope values, although shifts in carbon isotope ratio 

are usually small compared to the wide natural C variability in marine food sources 

(Fry &amp;amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et al. 2002). In this study, we 

corrected for preservation artifacts by adding 1‰ to ? 13C (Baco-Taylor 2002, 

Sarakinos et al. 2002, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Trophic shift boxes from potential 

organic matter sources at kelp and wood parcels helped to determine potential food 

sources (Fry 2006). Trophic changes of 3 ‰ were added to the range of ?15N values 

obtained for each organic matter source (DeNiro &amp;amp; Epstein 1978, Minagawa &amp;amp; Wada 

1984, Fisher et al. 1994). Species that exclusively use a particular source for nutrition 

are expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift box. Isotope values from kelp 

plants were obtained from the published literature (Page et al. 2008). A multi-source 

mixing model was used to calculate proportional contributions of each primary 

organic matter source (i.e.: kelp, wood, sedimentary organic carbon and bacterial mats 

growing on sulphidic sediments around treatments) to the benthic food web 

[IsoSource software; (Phillips &amp;amp; Gregg 2003)]. This model examines all possible 

combinations of each source contribution (0-100%) in small increments (e.g., 1%), 

where the combinations that best fit to the observed species isotope signature are 

considered feasible (Phillips &amp;amp; Gregg 2003). A mixing polygon was drawn around 

fauna samples, with polygon apices representing end members for each organic 



 17 

matter source (Demopoulos et al. 2007). Mixing contributions were calculated for 

consumers that fit within the mixing polygon, using a priori faunal corrected (i.e. 

trophic fractionation) isotope measurements for each trophic group (Kukert &amp;amp; Smith 

1992, Phillips &amp;amp; Gregg 2003, Demopoulos et al. 2007). We assumed a ?15N 

fractionation of 3‰ for omnivores, deposit feeders and “other” trophic levels (Fry 

1988, 2006, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Statistical tests to detect differences on the 

contribution of organic sources to the fauna were performed using the IsoError 

software (Phillips &amp;amp; Gregg 2001). 

Statistical analyzes on sediment organic content were examined with Student t 

test of means or Kruskal-Wallis, when the number of replicates allowed. Patterns of 

faunal abundance, faunal similarity and diversity were compared among distances and 

time for each treatment type. Total densities around treatments and in ambient 

sediments were examined with One-Way ANOVA if normality of variances was 

present. If homogeneity of variances was not attained, a non-parametric Kruskal-

Wallis test was performed. For significant ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results, post-

hoc tests were used to examine difference in means [statistical package BioEstat? 

(Zar 1996)]. Species diversity was evaluated for pooled replicate cores at each 

distance sampled (n=1-4) due to the low density of metazoans. Hulbert’s rarefaction 

curves (ESn) were used to compare species diversity between treatments. ESn gives an 

estimative of the number of species that would be found in a given number of 

individuals, interpolated from the number of species collected in each sample 

assuming a random distribution of individuals within samples (Hulbert 1971). 

Although this index tends to overestimate within-sample diversity, it is widely use to 

compare deep-sea samples of different sizes (Levin et al. 2001). Values of ESn were 

compared at n=10, n=25 and n=50, where possible. Near treatment samples were 



 18 

compared at higher n values, because these samples contained higher abundances and 

were particularly interesting as they were directly influenced by the treatments. 

Background replicate cores (n=17) from 2002, 2004 and 2005 were combined to 

calculate a composite diversity from the background community; with confidence 

limits calculated from pooled cores. From rarefaction “knots” obtained in each pooled 

sample, a one-tailed 95% confidence interval was calculated using the T distribution. 

Diversity curves were then compared to the background confidence curve in order to 

test for statistical differences on diversity (Smith 1986). Additionally, Pielou’s 

evenness values (J’) is given to provide further information on community structure 

(Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). The relative abundance of trophic guilds at each period 

sampled was integrated by distance in order to increase the power of statistical 

analyzes. Samples from 0 m and 0.5 m were compared against the background in 

order to evaluate changes in trophic structure nearby our treatments; and examined 

with ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis. 

Cluster analyses and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on 

species-abundance data from standardized quantitative samples (PRIMER v6, (Clarke 

&amp;amp; Gorley 2006); were used to compare community structure across distance and time. 

Square-root transformations were used prior to multivariate analysis in order to 

balance the importance of common and rare species (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). 

Clustering and ordination analyses were often combined to verify mutual consistency. 

Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was performed on standardized quantitative 

samples to determine significant differences between groups (distance and time) and 

dissimilarity percentages identified species contributions to these patterns (SIMPER 

analysis, (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001).  



 19 

In order to determine the level of species overlap between kelp, wood and 

other reducing habitats, we restricted our direct comparisons to relatively abundant 

species (i.e., over 1% rel. ab. at any treatment type) collected nearby our treatments 

(i.e. 0 to 0.5 meters) and that were not sampled in ambient sediments (i.e. total of 17 

background cores from 2002, 2004 and 2004). We excluded rare species (less than 

1% rel. abundance) from our comparisons in order to account for difficulties in 

taxonomic identification and undersampling biases. Comparisons of species overlap 

with other published studies were carried out at the genus and species level in order to 

account for differences in taxonomic identification between studies. 

 

2.3. Results 

Sedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen at kelp and wood parcels 

 

 After 0.25 years, percent organic carbon (TOC) in surface sediments near kelp 

falls was only 0.5% above background levels, with a spatial decrease in sedimentary 

TOC from 0 m to 1m (Fig. 2.2). After 0.5 years, the TOC levels at 0 meters was 

significantly higher than 0.5 meters away (t=-11.045, d.f.=2,  p=0.008), although no 

significant temporal increase in TOC was observed at 0 meters (Fig. 2.2). The 

combined TOC content in nearest 0-0.5 meters from the kelp falls at 0.5 y was 

significantly higher than 0.25 y and background sediments (Kruskal-Wallis, H=7.833, 

d.f.=2,  p=0.02). Sedimentary percent organic nitrogen (TON) was also slightly 

elevated near kelp parcels at 0.25 y, with significant differences from 0.5 meters and 

background sediments (t=6.05, d.f.=5, p=0.0018; Fig. 2.2). Sedimentary C/N ratios 

confirm the presence of relatively labile (i.e., nitrogen-rich) material at 0 m after 0.25 



 20 

y. C/N ratios were significantly lower at 0.25 y at 0 meters than all other distances 

and background sediments (t=-15.94, d.f.=4, p&lt;0.01; Fig. 2.2).  

Sedimentary TOC and TON around wood parcels resembled those in 

background levels at 0.5 and 1.8 y after deployment (Fig. 2.2). However, by the 3 y, 

surface sediments adjacent to wood parcels had become massively enriched in organic 

enrichment, with TOC 3-6 times higher than background values (t=17.37, d.f.=1, 

p&lt;0.001; Fig. 2.2). In addition, C/N ratios were extremely high (up to 82.9 C:N; 

t=52.49,d.f.=1, p&lt;0.001) compared to all other distances sampled, suggesting 

enrichment from relatively refractory woody material. Mean TOC and C/N ratios in 

surface sediments near wood falls were still well above ambient levels after 5.5 y 

(Fig. 2.2).  In addition, percent organic nitrogen was depressed in surface sediments 

near the wood parcel to distances of 2 m after 5.5 y (ANOVA, F=61.64, d.f.=1, 

p=0.0005), suggesting that low C/N ratio woody organic material had spread some 

distance from the wood parcel (Fig. 2.2).

Macrofaunal density, composition and patterns of succession 

Kelp parcels 

 

Spatial and temporal patterns of species composition and trophic structure 

indicate that kelp falls dramatically influenced infaunal communities over short 

spatial scales (&amp;lt;1 m) for at least 0.5 y. At 0.25 y, macroinfaunal abundance within 

0.5 m of kelp parcel was significantly enhanced by ~5–fold relative to background 



 22 

sediments (Fig. 2.3A). This pattern persisted relative unchanged after 0.5 y (Kruskal-

Wallis, H =24.05; d.f.=8, p=0.002; Fig. 2.3A - Inset). At distances of over 0.5 meters 

from the kelp, macroinfaunal abundance remained near ambient levels at both 0.25 

and 0.5 y (Fig. 2.3A). 

Dorvilleid polychaetes and cumaceans dominated sediments within 0.5 m of 

kelp falls after 0.25 y and 0.5 y, but were rare in ambient sediments (Fig. 2.3B). The 

four top-ranked species at 0.25 y constituted over 88% of all individuals at 0 m, and 

dorvilleids and cumaceans represented over 36 and 34 % of the total macrofauna, 

respectively (Table 2.2, Fig. 2.4).  At 0.5m, cumaceans still responded for over 55% 

of all macrofaunal individuals at 0.25 y (Fig. 2.3B, Fig. 2.4). At distances of ? 1 m 

from the kelp parcels at 0.25 y, background species dominated the infaunal 

community.  At 0.5 y, cumaceans and dorvilleids still dominated the macrofaunal 

community at a distance of 0 m, with background species becoming abundant at 

distances ? 0.5 m form the kelp (Fig. 2.4, Table 2.2). The rapid increase in abundance 

of the two species of cumaceans (Cumella sp. A and Cumacean sp. K) and the 

dorvilleid Ophryotrocha sp. A within 0.5 m from the kelp treatments suggests this 

species are opportunistically responding to enrichment and disturbance conditions 

(Grassle &amp;amp; Grassle 1974, Pearson &amp;amp; Rosenberg 1978). The cumacean species that 

responded to the kelp enrichment in this study were not typically encountered in our 

background communities, but they colonize enrichment experiments in deep-sea 

regions, including fish and whale-falls in the NE Pacific (Smith 1986, Snelgrove et al. 

1996, Smith et al. in prep).

The dominance of a Ophyotrocha sp. A and the two cumacean species, 

lowered species evenness (J’) and diversity nearby kelp treatments, at both times 

sampled (Table 2.3). At 0 m, species dominance was significantly higher than 

background sediments during both periods sampled (Kruskal-Wallis, H= 12.96, d.f.= 

4, p=0.01). Species diversity (ESn) increased from 0.25 y to 0.5 y within 0.5 meters of 

kelp parcels (Table 2.3, Fig. 2.5). At 0.25 y, rarefaction diversity was significantly 

lower within 0.5 m of the kelp treatments, if compared to background samples (Fig. 

2.5). At 0.5 y, diversity increased towards background sediments at distance of over 

0.5 m, but diversity was still significantly depressed at the 0 m macroinfaunal 

community (Fig. 2.5). The diversity changes around kelp treatments suggest that 

although areas nearby the parcels were being negatively affected by the enrichment 

and disturbance conditions after 0.5 y, the macrofauna in sediments over 0.5 m had 

returned to background conditions.

Trophic-group analysis revealed large changes adjacent to kelp parcels (i.e., ? 

0.5 m) after 0.25 – 0.5 y. At 0.25 y, the high abundance of dorvilleids and cumaceans 

dramatically increased the proportion of omnivores (OMNI, Kruskal-Wallis, 

H=6.836, d.f.=2, p=0.02) and the  “other” trophic group (Kruskal-Wallis, H=16.624,

number of “other” trophic group at 0 m was still significant after 0.5 y (p&lt;0.01; Fig. 

2.6). Surface deposit feeders (SDF) were slightly depressed nearby kelp parcels 

compared to background sediments, but no significant trend was observed (Fig. 2.6). 

In addition, sub-surface deposit feeders (SSDF) were wholly absent adjacent to kelp 

parcels (0 m) after 0.25 -0.5 yr (Kruskal-Wallis, H=5.70, d.f.=1, p=0.018; Fig. 2.6). 

This suggests that sub-surface deposit feeders were particularly affected by the 

physical and organic disturbances in sediments nearby the kelp parcels. Trophic 

differences between 0.25 and 0.5 y at 0.5 m suggests recovery towards background 

conditions at 0.5 y, with an increase in the importance of SDF accompanied by a 



 26 

strong decrease in the “other” trophic group (Fig. 2.6). The elevated number of 

omnivores and “other” trophic guilds are consistent with the opportunist species that 

colonized sediments and possibly with the augmented amount of detritus within 0.5 m 

from the treatments. Complete abundance and relative contribution of species at kelp 

parcels are presented in Appendix 2A.

Wood parcels 

Wood parcels also exhibited dramatic effects on macrofaunal community 

structure in space and time. The sediment near the wood parcels accumulated a 

massive number of Xylophaga washingtonia recruits during the first 0.5 – 3 years 

(Fig. 2.7A), presumably resulting from settling response to available wood substrate 

nearby. Brooder species of Xylophaga present on the wood parcels may have been the 

source of juveniles that rained down to the sediments after 0.5 y (Voight 2007a). The 

Xylophaga bivalves never attained adult size within the sediments, although adults 

were present on the wood parcels from 0.5 y onward.  Thus, Xylophaga represents a 

sink population resulting from mass effects of the wood parcel (Leibold et al. 2004). 



 27 

Because Xylophaga appear to represent sink populations in the sediment community 

derived from mass effects of the wood parcels, we also evaluated macrofaunal 

community patterns with Xylophaga removed from the analyses.  At 0.5 y, mean 

macrofaunal abundance, without Xylophaga, was significantly higher at 0 m than in 

background sediments; at further distances macrofaunal abundances resembled 

background levels (Fig. 8B; Kruskal-Wallis test, H=27.98, d.f.=13, p=0.03). 

Macrofaunal densities around the wood parcels were significantly elevated at 0 m 

after 1.8 y (ANOVA, F=12.906, d.f.=3, p=0.003), dropping to background levels by 

0.5 m from the parcels (Fig. 2.7B).  At subsequent sampling times (3.0 and 5.5 y), 

macrofaunal abundance progressively increased adjacent to the parcels, reaching very 

high numbers (15,100 ± 2400 ind.m-2) at 0 m after 5.5 y (p&lt;0.001; Fig. 2.7B).  

However, macrofaunal enhancement was limited in a spatial scale, with slight 

increases after 1.8 – 5.5 y at 0.5 m, at all time points, and background levels of 

abundance at &gt; 1 m from parcels even at 5.5 y, when abundances at 0 m were 15 

times background levels (Fig. 2.7B).  

At the species level, Cumacean sp. K dominated macrofaunal assemblages 

adjacent to wood parcels after 0.5 y, although three background species (Monticellina 

sp. A, Chaetozone sp. D and Cossura rostrata) remained among the 5 dominant 

species (Fig. 2.8, Table 2.4). By 1.8 y, Ophryotrocha sp. A (a dorvilleid) and 

ampharetid polychaetes dominated assemblages at 0 - 0.5 m, with cumaceans also 

abundant at 0.5 m (Table 2.4); at further distances, background polychaetes continued 

to dominate (Fig. 2.8). By 3.0 y, dorvilleids (two species of Ophrytotrocha) had 

achieved very high densities at 0 m, representing over 40% of the macrofauna (Fig. 

2.8, Table 2.4) and the chemoautotrophic-symbiont-containing mytilid Idas 

washingtonia was first encountered at the wood parcels (Table 2.4). At 5.5 y, 



 28 

dorvilleids (Ophryotrocha and Parougia) and two species of ampharetids dominated 

the macrofauna at 0 m, with very high abundances (Table 2.4, Fig. 2.8); Cumacean 

sp. K, was also abundant. None of the dorvilleids, ampharetids and cumaceans were 

collected in the background community, or even off distances of 2 m from the wood 

falls.  This, plus their larger response to kelp parcels suggest that they are 

opportunistic species, or may be wood associated species enhanced by mass effects 

(Leibold et al. 2004) from the adjacent wood parcels.

The increase in macrofaunal density at 0 m from 0.5 y to 5.5 y was followed 

by a significant decrease on community evenness in the latter period (J’, ANOVA, 

F=8.384, d.f.=3, p=0.001, Table 2.5), resulting from higher densities of opportunist 

species. At the other periods, J’ was always within background levels (Table 2.5). 

Rarefaction diversity demonstrates a clear temporal pattern adjacent to wood parcels. 

At 0.5 y, rarefaction diversity adjacent to the wood parcel falls above background 

levels (Table 2.5, Fig. 2.9); diversity then progressively declines at 0 m from 1.8 to 

5.5 y (Table 2.5, Fig. 2.9). The diversity curve at 5.5 y falls well below all other 

curves and is significantly lower than background (Fig. 2.9).

Functional group analysis also indicated dramatic wood parcel effects on the 

adjacent macrofaunal community, increasing in intensity from 0.5 – 5.5 y. At 0.5 y, 

the dominant trophic groups were largely typical of ambient sediments, although at 0 

m the importance of the “others” group slightly increased due to the presence of the 

apparently opportunistic Cumacean sp. K (Fig. 2.10). By 1.8 y, omnivores at 0 m had 

increased to 26%, and rose to 50% of the macrofauna at 3.0  - 5.5 y (Fig. 2.10). After 

3 y, the omnivores within 0.5 m from wood falls were significantly more numerous 

than the 0.5 y community and the background sediments (Kruskal-Wallis, H=12.19, 

d.f.=4, p=0.016). SDF’s were relatively abundant during the whole period analyzed 

(over 30%), with ampharetids being dominant nearby the parcels and cirratulids in 

background sediments. Subsurface deposit feeders usually represented less than 1% of 

the infauna at 0 m during all periods (Fig. 2.10). Complete abundance and distribution 

of species at wood parcels are presented in Appendix 2B.

MDS patterns of faunal distribution at Kelp and Wood parcels 

 

Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analyses further elucidate 

successional patterns in space and time around the kelp and wood parcels. At kelp 

falls, 0 m samples from 0.25 and one replicate from 0.5 y separated strongly from all 

other distances (Fig. 2.11, Two-way ANOSIM R= 0.358, P=0.001). The top-ranked 

species at 0 m accounted for over 70% of the dissimilarity from the other samples at 

both time intervals (SIMPER). All other samples from 0.5 m to background, clustered 

with each other at 0.25 and 0.5 y, with no distinct difference between them (Fig. 2.11, 

ANOSIM). Overall, highest dissimilarities in sediments nearby kelp falls and 

background communities resulted from the dominance of apparently opportunistic 



 33 

species adjacent to the kelp fall at 3 months, and the low background densities of 

local species.

Kelp (top panel) and Wood (bottom panel) parcels on SCr Basin. Grouped symbols denote 
stronger similarity among samples (see text). 

 

At wood parcels, the MDS also revealed marked spatial and temporal patterns 

(Two-way ANOSIM, p&lt;0.01). At 0.5 y and 1.8 y, all samples generally grouped 

together with no evident difference between treatments and background communities 

(Fig. 2.11, ANOSIM). A dramatic shift in macrofaunal community structure was 

indicated at 0 m at 3 y and persisted to 5.5 y (Fig. 2.11, ANOSIM, R= 0.319, P= 

0.001). The top ranked macrofaunal species (including apparently opportunistic 

dorvilleids in the genus Ophryotrocha) at these two later periods accounted for over 

20% of the spatial dissimilarity among samples (SIMPER). Pairwise comparisons 



 34 

revealed a lower degree of dissimilarity between 5.5 y and the two first periods 

sampled, suggesting that macrofaunal community structure by 5.5 y may have been 

recovering towards background conditions (ANOSIM). 

These results confirm our first hypothesis, that kelp and wood falls promote 

very distinct patterns of macrobenthic community succession. The dynamics of 

dominant species were distinct between kelps and wood, with kelps promoting early 

changes (scales of 1-3 months) on community composition, which lowered local 

diversity in the short scale as a result of a massive colonization by a few omnivore 

species (cumaceans and dorvilleids). On the other hand, dominant species altered 

community structure around wood parcels only after 1 – 2 years, but the duration of 

the organic enrichment promoted significant changes for over 5 years. A higher 

number of species colonized sediments around wood falls, likely as a consequence of 

increased food availability, but the fauna became less diverse with time as densities of 

opportunist species increased. 

 

Stable isotope analysis at Kelp and Wood parcels 

 

Potential primary organic matter sources at kelp and wood falls include kelp 

and wood biomass, sedimentary matter from deposited phytoplankton, and biomass 

from chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria utilizing sulfide emitted from kelp or 

wood parcels. Kelp biomass (Macrocystis pyrifera) had the highest ? 13C and ?15N 

isotope values from all primary organic sources (Table 2.6). Sediment organic carbon 

and wood fragments had very similar isotope signatures (Table 2.6), which were 

consistent with previous studies in the basin (Baco-Taylor 2002). Mats of sulfur-

oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria growing on whale skeletons off southern 

California had ? 13C signatures similar to the other organic sources but with the lowest 



 35 

?15N values compared to the other sources (Table 2.6). Isotope signatures from sulfur-

oxidizing bacteria can have a much wider isotopic range due to variable inorganic C 

sources (Ruby et al. 1987).

members values were used in the mixing model calculations in order to account for maximum

The top-ranked invertebrates associated with kelp parcels generally had 

isotope values out of the trophic box, which indicates that they did not feed 

exclusively on any of those primary organic sources (Fig. 2.12). Temporal differences 

on isotope signatures from the specimens analyzed were minimal. Based on mixing 

model calculations, individuals of Ophryotrocha sp. A and Cumella sp. A from 0.25 y 

derived most of their nutrition on kelp biomass (57-66% and 58-63%, respectively; 

Table S2.1, Supp. Material). Kelp biomass contributed significantly to the isotopic 

signature of Ophryotrocha at 0.25 y if compared to sediments; but with increased 

contribution of sediments in the diet at 0.5 y, confirming their omnivore diet and 

suggesting an opportunistic feeding (Table S2.1). Due to wide temporal variability on 



 36 

isotope signatures, we could not determine the contribution of food sources for 

Cumacean sp. K (Fig. S2.1, Suppl. Mat.). After 0.5 y, this species had isotope values 

(-38.1 and -11.7‰, ?13C and ?15N respectively), strongly suggesting nutrition derived 

from chemoautotrophic food sources [Fig. 2.12; (Fisher et al. 1994, Deming et al. 

1997)].

Right: Organisms from wood parcels sampled from 0.5 y to 5.5 y (species with temporal 
replicates are indicated separately). Boxes represent one trophic shift for a given organic 
matter source (source indicated next to each box, see methods). 
 

At 0.5 y wood parcels, Cumacean sp. K also had relatively light ?13C and ?15N 

values, once again suggesting nutrition based on chemoautotrophic production (Fig. 

2.12). However, at later times at wood parcels, this species had heavier isotope ranges 

consistent with feeding on wood, sediment organic carbon, and/or sulfur bacteria, 

which may indicate an opportunistic feeding strategy. A few top ranked invertebrates 

at wood parcels fell into, or were close to the trophic shift box for sulfur bacteria, 

sediment organic matter, wood or some combination of these (Fig. 2.12). Surface 

deposit feeders such as the ampharetids Amelina sp. and Ampharetid sp.18 appear to 

feed primarily on sediments, while the other dorvilleids fall into areas which may 



 37 

reflect a mixture of sources that were out of the range for mixing calculations, but still 

suggesting that they are omnivorous (Fig. 2.12, Suppl. Material Fig. S2.1). There is 

no evidence that any animals fed exclusively on the wood material, but the wide ?15N 

signatures on the fauna highlight the additional availability of food sources (e.g. dead 

faunal biomass) and trophic levels (i.e. scavengers) that existed around these parcels. 

Mixing model calculations constrained contributions of primary food sources for only 

three species at wood falls (Fig. S2.1). The diet of the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha sp. A 

and Ophryotrocha sp. G had a stronger contribution of bacteria and wood at 3 y (28-

32% and 41-60%, respectively), with Ophryotrocha sp. G ingesting lower amounts of 

sediments (Table S2.1). An augmented signal of wood biomass in the fauna after 3 y 

is consistent with the increased input of organic carbon originated from the break up 

of the wooden matrix from the parcels to the sediments nearby. The opportunistic 

feeding on abundant organic sources within the sediments may also have promoted 

ingestion of bacterial biomass, but its close isotopic signature with the wood material 

limits further assumptions about its importance to the fauna (Suppl. Mat.). The wood 

borer Xylophaga had a larger contribution of wood material as a juvenile (&gt; 50%), but 

the adult specimen had increased bacterial carbon contribution, probably reflecting its 

microbial symbiosis (Distel &amp;amp; Roberts 1997); Table S2.1). 

 

Biodiversity and species overlap between kelp, wood and other chemosynthetic 

habitats 

 

This study collected a total of 64 identified macrofaunal species, of which 27 

were found at kelp falls and 53 at wood falls. The dominant species found at kelp and 

wood falls were not sampled in ambient sediments (Tables 2.2 and 2.4). From the 

dominant species sampled at the parcels (&gt; 5% rel. abundance), there were 6 species 



 38 

that overlap between kelp and wood parcels (9%), and four of those species (Samytha 

californiensis, Ophryotrocha sp. A, Cumacea sp. K and Cumella sp. A) are likely to 

be enrichment opportunists (Table 2.7). In addition, one species of polynoid 

(Subadyte mexicana), which is likely a predator, was also shared between wood and 

kelp parcels, evidencing the increased effect of organic enrichment on the 

composition of both communities (Table 2.7). Kelp and wood parcels also attracted 

unique species absent from background communities and the other parcel type. From 

the 7 species exclusively found at kelps, the gastropod Hyalogyrina n.sp. was the 

most abundant, and is a new species first encountered on whale-falls (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 

2003). The other 6 species did not achieve high densities at kelp falls, making it 

difficult to distinguish their kelp “endemism” from undersampling of the background 

assemblage.  

The wood attracted 17 species not found on kelp falls or in ambient sediments, 

including six dorvilleid species, three ampharetid species, the isopod Ilyarachna 

profunda, and the bivalves Idas washingtonia and Xylophaga washingtona. As for 

kelp falls, many species were rare, again making it difficult to resolve wood-fall 

endemism from rarity in the background community (Table 2.7). The wood-borer 

Xylophaga, the ampharetids Amelinna sp. A and Ampharetid sp. 18 reached massive 

abundances around wood falls, probably either raining down from the parcel or 

exploiting rich organic conditions. The high number of dorvilleids in the wood parcels 

suggests these habitats provide analogous organic conditions (but less intense) to 

whale carcasses, which host over 40 dorvilleid species (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). 

Kelp and wood parcels share together 21 species with whale falls (25%), of 

which 13 species exhibit enrichment response nearby both organic islands (Smith et 

al. in prep). The level of overlap between kelp, wood and the San Clemente seep is 



 39 

lower (2 species) including to the ampharetid Amelinna sp. A. and the 

chemoautotrophic-symbiont-containing mytilid Idas washingtonia. Other dorvilleid 

species (or genus) are shared with seep and hydrothermal vent habitats (Table 2.7), 

summing to a total of 9 shared species (14%, Table 2.7). Kelp and wood overlaps 

with seeps and vents include the dorvilleids (Parougia, Ophryotrocha and 

Schistomeringos) and the polynoids Subadyte mexicana and Bathykurila 

guaymasensis (Levin et al. 2000, MacAvoy et al. 2002, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003).

 40 

The low level of species overlap between kelp, wood and the other reducing 

habitats gives support to our second hypothesis. At the species level, we found higher 

overlap between our organic parcels and whale falls, if compared to seeps and vents. 

The low levels of colonization by a specialized fauna, typically chemosynthetic 

species, were only represented by one mytilid Idas at wood falls. Our successional 

study revealed that colonizers of kelp and wood falls include a community massively 

dominated by enrichment opportunists (Grassle &amp;amp; Grassle 1974), but includes species 

responding to habitat-specific characteristics which may contribute to higher regional 

diversity in the deep-sea. 

 

2.4. Discussion 

 

The transfer of organic detritus to the sediments around kelp and wood falls 

exhibited distinct dynamics. The distinct temporal scales of sediment enrichment 

created by kelp and wood falls was influenced by differences in their composition 

(Snelgrove et al. 1996, Hannides 2008). At kelp falls, kelp detritus left from 

detritivores activities and the remaining faunal biomass was rapidly (&amp;lt;0.25 y) 

transferred to nearby sediments (0 m). The organic input lead to the development of 

sedimentary reducing conditions around kelp treatments, evidenced by the growth of 

bacterial carpets on the sediment surface (0.25 – 0.5 y kelp parcels; Fig. 2-C), 

concurrently with high sulfide levels within the top few centimeters of sediment 

(Hannides 2008, Treude et al. 2009). The rapid organic enrichment around kelp falls 

indicates the efficient transfer of kelp detritus and its utilization by microbes and 

metazoans. The nutritional value of kelp biomass might facilitate its biological 

remineralization by deep-sea scavengers, and by microbes that decompose the detritus 

left behind by the fauna (de Leeuw &amp;amp; Largeau 1993, Vetter 1994, Boetius &amp;amp; Lochte 



 41 

1996, Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998, 1999). Direct faunal utilization of macroalgae in the 

deep-sea is apparently linked to its high quality within an impoverished background 

(Vetter 1994, Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1999). The massive numbers of metazoans that rapidly 

recruited after kelp deployment, evidences the attractive affect that kelp detritus have 

on deep-sea detritivores. An efficient remineralization and rapid energy transfer of 

organic detritus to the food web is also observed at rich organic packages, such as fish 

falls (Smith 1985, 1986). The efficient degradation of kelp biomass is additionally 

supported by its fast decomposition rates in deep submarine canyons [aprox. 2.5% d-1; 

(Harrold et al. 1998)], and evidences the importance of macroalgae detritus to deep-

sea ecosystems (Vetter &amp;amp; Dayton 1998). 

On the other hand, the sluggish decomposition of wooden material, which is 

primarily carried by Xylophaga borers in Santa Cruz Basin, appears to delay the 

transfer of organic carbon to the sediments for at least 1.8 y. After initial degradation 

of the wood parcels, fecal pellets (Turner 1977), faunal biomass [e.g. Xylophaga 

juveniles that rained down to the sediments; (Wolff 1979)] and principally wooden 

material, promoted high levels of refractory organic carbon in the sediments after 3 y. 

At wood falls, its refractory composition likely delays the sedimentary organic 

enrichment by a) diminishing scavenging by larger animals thus restricting sloppy-

feeding, b) requiring wood falls specialists to initiate the break up of the refractory 

wooden material and c) limiting sedimentary microbial remineralization (Turner 

1977, Boetius &amp;amp; Lochte 1996, Hannides 2008). The organic enrichment around wood 

falls culminated at 3 y and was sustained significantly above background levels for a 

period of at least 2.5 years. The levels of organic carbon in the sediments encountered 

at 3 y wood falls may be one of the highest measured at these depths, but the limited 

microbial degradation of the refractory wood detritus was indicated by low levels of 



 42 

sulfide in surface sediments (Hannides 2008), and by the visual absence of bacterial 

mats around the wood falls. Sediments covered with bacterial mats at cold seeps and 

around whale carcasses commonly exhibit high sulfate reduction rates, which is a 

primary source of free sulfide at the sediments (Sahling et al. 2002, Treude et al. 

2003, Treude et al. 2009).  

Considering the high availability of organic carbon but low pore-water 

sulfides, wood falls may serve as an intermediate-scale organic and sulfide rich 

habitat between kelp falls and whale carcasses. Kelp falls sustain very rapid increases 

in organic enrichment, eliciting small-scale increases on free sulfide, which limits its 

utilization by organisms with rapid development such as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. 

Although microbial degradation of wood-carbon do not sustain significant sulfide 

levels in the sediments, the long-term availability of enrichment conditions may 

increase habitat utilization by organisms able to harvest low sulfide levels, or with 

facultative chemoautotrophy [e.g. mytilid bivalves; (Fisher 1999, Dubilier et al. 2008, 

Duperron et al. 2008, Lorion et al. 2009)]. At the other end, whale carcasses may 

serve as end members of organic islands, where massive amounts of fresh organic 

matter take years to be eaten by scavengers (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Smith 2006), and 

high bacterial degradation of sedimentary whale biomass provide sulfide levels 

comparable to other deep-sea reducing habitats (Treude et al. 2009). 

We observed marked differences in macrofaunal abundance, composition and 

succession between kelp and wood parcels, preventing rejection of our first 

hypothesis. The patchy disturbance caused by kelp and wood falls promoted distinct 

magnitudes of increased macrofaunal abundance within 0.5 meters from the 

treatments, and reduced community diversity. The colonization patterns at kelp and 

wood parcels exhibited some similarities to other deep-sea enrichment experiments, 



 43 

with several species being rare or absent at background communities but abundant at 

the disturbed areas. At 0.25 y kelp falls, cumaceans and dorvilleids were responsible 

for the increased macrofaunal abundance and low community diversity, a pattern 

similar to other small-scale enrichment experiments in deep-sea areas (Smith 1986, 

Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove et al. 1996, Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002, 

Levin et al. 2006). Macrofaunal abundance at wood falls was still increasing between 

1.8 and 5.5 years of deployment, with an increase in species richness from several 

species not seen in ambient sediments, which were likely colonizing new 

microhabitats created by the falls (Dayton &amp;amp; Hessler 1972, Snelgrove et al. 1996). 

However, diversity at kelp and wood falls was not enhanced locally and gradually 

decreased with the temporal increase in the dominance of opportunists at the wood 

falls, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-

Porteous 1987, Smith et al. 1998). Typical ambient species were also dominant at 0.5 

y wood falls and their high density suggests that they may have been responding to 

low-intensity organic enrichment from the wood parcel (Kukert &amp;amp; Smith 1992). 

Background species were always observed over 0.5 meters from kelps, and many 

species returned to previously disturbed areas after 0.5 y revealing that the succession 

was leading toward convergence with background conditions. 

Wood falls attracted specialists prior to any sedimentary organic enrichment, 

with juvenile Xylophaga bivalves being dominant at 0.5 y. Xylophaga bivalves 

process the wood matrix as they grow (Distel &amp;amp; Roberts 1997, Turner 2002), and the 

early recruitment of these wood-borers supports that they are widely distributed at 

deep-sea depths, favoring their rapid settlement onto any available piece of wood 

(Grassle &amp;amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Pailleret et al. 2007, Voight 2007b, a). It was 

remarkable to detect Xylophaga juveniles down on the sediments after 0.5 y, and to 



 44 

confirm that many of these individuals came from a brooding species present on the 

wood falls. The fact that besides X. washingtonia, another brooding species of 

Xylophaga colonized our wood falls before a period of 3 months, suggests either a 

remarkable dispersal ability for the brooding Xylophaga species or simultaneous 

hermaphroditism, an adaptation to the ephemeral habitat (Tyler et al. 2007, Voight 

2007a, Tyler et al. 2009). Due to rapid and massive colonization, Xylophaga 

populations illustrate well mass effect dynamics with densities controlled by 

immigration and enhanced by local birth rates (Leibold et al. 2004). 

The high density of opportunists modified the macrofaunal functional 

structure nearby the parcels from a typical deposit feeding to scavenger-omnivore 

predominance, with broad reductions in subsurface deposit feeders. The significant 

reductions in this group suggests that organic disturbance strongly affected subsurface 

sediments (Kukert &amp;amp; Smith 1992). The functional change at kelp and wood parcels 

was strikingly similar, albeit followed the distinct time scales from disturbance. At 

both parcels, we observed an early increase on the proportion of omnivores due to 

opportunist colonization. At sediments where no significant organic input was 

observed, there were minimal changes on the abundance of surface and subsurface 

deposit feeders, spatially associated with the persistence of background polychaetes 

species close to the parcels. The long-term changes in trophic structure were restricted 

to sediments under the influence of high organic input, and lasted for over 5 years at 

wood parcels.  

Most top-ranked species from both organic falls had isotope signatures 

indicative of higher nutrition on detritus, reflecting species-specific preferences but 

with wide ranges of dependence at a variety of organic sources. Cumella sp. A 

appeared to feed primarily on kelp at 0.25 y but Cumacea sp. K had isotopic 



 45 

composition indicative of nutrition from chemoautotrophic production (Fisher et al. 

1994, Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). At 0.5 y wood parcels the same species had ?13C 

signatures indicating a source of chemoautotrophic biomass before any sedimentary 

enrichment, possibly through sulfur-oxidizing bacteria filaments growing on wood 

surfaces (Ruby et al. 1987, Laurent et al. 2009). Chemosynthetic energy sources could 

be particularly important to opportunist organisms prior to the sedimentary 

enrichment around the parcels, as observed for detritivores growing on forest litter 

(McLeod &amp;amp; Wing 2007). The other specimens at wood parcels had wide isotope 

signatures suggesting nutrition on many different organic sources and occupying high 

trophic positions, with low contribution from chemosynthetic carbon. Low 

dependence on chemosynthesis has been observed at reducing habitats that have 

greater availability of organic sources (Levin et al. 2000). Two dorvilleid species had 

slightly distinct contributions of wood detritus to their diet, probably a consequence of 

a patchy supply of organic carbon around the parcels. Xylophaga juveniles had a 

stronger contribution of wood carbon to their diet but the adults had increased 

bacterial carbon, possibly reflecting the signatures of their symbiotic bacteria (Distel 

&amp;amp; Roberts 1997, Nishimoto et al. 2009). 

Biodiversity comparisons among deep-sea habitats face inherent difficulties 

associated with the taxonomy of poorly known faunas, and comparisons between 

studies that used very distinct sampling methodologies. We also could not reject our 

second hypothesis of low levels of species overlap between wood, kelp and the 

macrofauna of other reducing habitats. The macrofauna at kelp and wood falls 

exhibited higher taxonomic affinity with nearby whale-falls than to other deep-sea 

chemosynthetic communities, although this could easily be a location effect (the 

whale fall was only ~100 m away, while seeps and vents were 100’s to 1000’s of km 



 46 

away). For example, cumaceans were top-ranked individuals at our organic falls and 

at whale carcasses, but were not found at the San Clemente seep (Smith et al. in prep). 

Vent taxa present on kelp and wood falls were mostly restricted to polychaete 

predators and microbial mat grazers, such as polynoids and some dorvilleids, which 

also occur at whale carcasses and Californian seeps (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Levin 

2005). The dorvilleids found at kelp and wood parcels typically colonize whale-falls 

and other sulfide-rich sediments, including the nearby San Clemente seep (Levin et al. 

2006, Smith et al. in prep). The high number of dorvilleid species at wood parcels was 

surprising, with 6 species representing at least 3 genera often found at seeps, vents 

and whale-falls, and suggesting that wood islands may create a complex of niches for 

this group (Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003, Levin et al. 2003). The longer persistence of 

wood-falls and their stronger organic enrichment compared to kelps may further 

facilitate the colonization of species attracted to sulfide around these parcels (Smith et 

al. 1989, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). The wood also attracted a few Idas washingtonia, 

which contains chemoautrophic endosymbionts, and occurs in abundance at whale 

falls (Deming et al. 1997, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). 

The colonization by seep and whale fall species suggests that wood islands 

have low potential to sustain chemosynthesis, but demonstrates that these parcels can 

increase the local heterogeneity of the deep seafloor for long periods of time. It is 

hard to estimate the frequency of occurrence of such organic islands across deep-sea 

habitats, but it is clear that they provide food and substrate to deep-sea opportunists 

(Wolff 1979, Kiel &amp;amp; Goedert 2006, McLeod &amp;amp; Wing 2007). The frequent 

biogeographic occurrence of these habitats are supported by recent explorations in the 

West Pacific that have collected an abundant wood associated fauna with several new 



 47 

specimens at depths far from continental margins (Pailleret et al. 2007, Samadi et al. 

2009).  

The frequent occurrence of wood and kelp falls, together with whale carcasses 

and other organic habitats may increase regional species diversity and favor stepping 

stone dispersal for some species (Levin et al. 2001, Snelgrove &amp;amp; Smith 2002, Van 

Dover et al. 2002). Our study indicates that wood falls create organic rich islands that 

are exploited by both opportunists and a few specialized taxa, evidencing the role of 

patch disturbance and habitat variability in maintaining regional diversity (Snelgrove 

&amp;amp; Smith 2002). Wood falls host many dorvilleid polychaetes, which are typical of 

seeps and vents and are a remarkable species rich group in whale falls (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 

2003). Bathymodiolin mussels show specialization on organic falls and are abundant 

on several reducing habitats (e.g. seeps and vents). Molecular and phylogenetic 

analyzes indicate that the high diversity of the Bathymodiolinae and their successful 

colonization of seeps and vents may have resulted from their ability to exploit wide 

geochemical conditions at organic islands (Fisher et al. 1987, Distel et al. 2000, Jones 

et al. 2006, Lorion et al. 2009). Hence, the strongest evidence for wood falls to 

increase regional levels of biodiversity comes from the fact that multiple species 

colonize these habitats from other areas. Consequently, wood falls may increase 

habitat and population connectivity across wide ocean basins (Smith et al. 1989, 

Distel et al. 2000, Van Dover et al. 2002, Kritzer &amp;amp; Sale 2006), as suggested from 

their wide distribution and the fact they sustain organic rich islands for extended 

periods of time. 

 

2.5. Conclusions 

 



 48 

This study showed that kelp and wood falls contribute to the heterogeneity of 

habitats in the deep-sea, as evidenced by the colonization of several organic-

enrichment species not present on ambient deep-sea communities. The long-term 

organic enrichment created by wood falls increased macrofaunal colonization for 

several opportunist and specialized species, with evidence of mass effects dynamics 

for wood-borers. As a result of abundant organic sources and low sulfide levels, 

chemoautotrophy is limited in sediments around wood falls. Wood and kelp falls host 

a limited number of species that overlap with vents and seeps, with higher similarity 

with whale carcasses at similar ocean depths, but this could be a result of low spatial 

isolation. Our study gives support that wood falls create favorable habitats for the 

stepping stone dispersal of species adapted to use these low sulfide but organic rich 

parcels in deep-sea areas.

Chapter 3. Infaunal community structure and succession during 

the sulfophilic stage of a whale carcass in the deep NE Pacific 
 

Abstract 

 

Although natural and experimental deep-sea whale falls have been studied in several 

ocean basins, the impact of whale falls on sediment macrofaunal community structure 

has rarely been studied. Here we evaluate macrofaunal community structure and 

succession around a 30-ton deep-sea whale-fall artificially implanted at 1670 m in the 

Santa Cruz Basin (SCr; NE Pacific). This study focused on macrofaunal community 

patterns from 4.5 to 6.8 y after carcass deployment in order to evaluate: (1) patterns of 

organic enrichment around the whale-fall sediments; (2) spatial and temporal patterns 

of macrofaunal species structure and (3) level of species overlap with other artificial 

and natural reducing habitats at similar depths on the Californian margin. Sediment 

organic enrichment around the whale-fall during the period studied was highly 

patchy, with some sediments adjacent the whale fall exhibiting intense organic 

loading (11% organic carbon by weight). Macrofaunal abundance was highly elevated 

from 4.5 to 6.8 y, and was dominated by enrichment opportunist and sulfophilic 

species. Dorvilleids, ampharetids and cumaceans accounted for over 50% of 

macrofaunal abundance nearby the whale-fall (0 – 0.5 m) at all times sampled. 

Bacterial mats were abundant over the sediment surface for over 6.8 y, indicating the 

presence of pore-water sulfides and organic enrichment, and indicating that the 

sulfophilic stage had started by 4.5 y. The macrofaunal community was composed of 

chemoautotrophic-symbiont-hosting and heterotrophic species grazing sulfur-

oxidizing bacterial mats. Whale-fall sediments harbor many species and trophic types 

not present in background sediments, and significantly increase beta diversity for at 

least 7 yrs. There were low levels of species overlap between the whale-fall, cold 

seeps and hydrothermal vents, explained by differences in biogeochemistry and food 

webs among these habitats. The sediment macrofauna around the SCr whale-fall was 

more diverse than in other similar habitats at cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, 

indicating that whale-falls may be significant oases of enhanced alpha diversity in the 

deep-sea.

3.1. Introduction 

 

Nekton carcasses (e.g. fishes, dolphins, whales) provide an important source 

of energy to the deep sea, introducing large quantities of fresh organic material into a 

food-poor environment (Stockton &amp;amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith 1985, 1986, Smith &amp;amp; 

Demopoulos 2005). The arrival of a carcass of the largest living animal on Earth at 

the deep-sea floor has received considerable attention and the succession of organisms 

exploiting whale-carcasses have been studied in numerous deep-sea and shallow 

water sites (Smith 1985, Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1998, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 

2003, Goffredi et al. 2004, Fujiwara et al. 2007). The amount of carbon that is 

exported as whale-detritus is lower than the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) 

to deep-sea oceans, but dead whales sink as enormous organic-rich packages that 

disturb a very limited area of the sea-bottom (Smith 2006). For example, the seabed 

immediately underlying a typical whale fall (i.e. roughly 50 m2), can experience the 

equivalent of 2000 yr of background POC flux in a single pulse of organic enrichment 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Consequently, whale carcasses provide an immense and very 

rich source of labile organic matter to the food limited deep-sea ecosystems. This 

enormous food bonanza attracts numerous macro- and megafaunal organisms that 

exploit the rich organic sources for years to decades (Smith et al. 1998, Baco-Taylor 

&amp;amp; Smith 2003, Smith 2006). 

Modern whale carcasses in the deep sea host a dense and species-rich 

macrofaunal assemblage attached to bone surfaces and living in the underlying soft 

sediments (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998, Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003, Smith 

&amp;amp; Baco 2003, Goffredi et al. 2004). Experimental studies on the Californian slope 

revealed that whale carcasses typically support a diverse succession of macrofaunal 

assemblages that include: i) a first stage of mobile scavengers; ii) an enrichment 



 

 

61 

opportunist stage; iii) a sulfophilic or chemoautotrophic stage and iv) a reef stage 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Along the successional stages, considerable attention has been 

given to the epifaunal macrofauna associated with the whale bones, revealing that 

whale skeletons can harbor the highest local species richness of any deep-sea hard-

substrata habitats, such as cold seeps and vents (Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003). 

Highlights of the extreme richness associated with these habitats comes from the 

limited number of overlapping species inhabiting similar whale-fall ecosystems, 

considering that a relatively limited number of whale-falls have been studied globally 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Fujiwara et al. 2007). The high number of whale-fall specialists 

described recently further suggests that much of the biodiversity associated with these 

habitats remains to be discovered, and that carcasses of large animals may have 

promoted evolutionary reducing habitats in the deep sea for long periods of time 

(Dahlgren et al. 2004, Glover et al. 2005b, Kiel &amp;amp; Goedert 2006). 

Whale skeletons generate organic-rich conditions and sustain a reducing 

habitat for years in the deep-sea. The long-term persistence of reducing conditions at 

whale carcasses create habitat for specialized species that depend on chemosynthesis 

for their nutrition, which may increase the overlap of species between whale skeletons 

and other chemosynthetic habitats (Smith et al. 1989). The whale fall chemosynthesis 

is principally based on anaerobic microbial degradation of bone lipids and on the 

degradation of organic carbon in sediments around the carcass; releasing high levels 

of hydrogen sulfide (Goffredi et al. 2008, Treude et al. 2009). Biogeochemical 

processes in a whale fall can sustain similar chemosynthetic conditions to other rich 

reducing habitats such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents; and taxonomic affinities 

among species inhabiting whale carcasses and chemoautotrophic-based communities 

supports the similar ecological niche found between them (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, 



 

 

62 

Treude et al. 2009). The broad range of ecological niches present at whale carcasses 

attracts organisms that host chemoautotrophic symbionts, including whale-fall 

“specialists”, heterotrophic opportunists and also background species (Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; 

Smith 2003, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). 

The importance of chemosynthetic food-webs at many reducing habitats in the 

deep-sea and the encounter of chemosynthesis-based species colonizing both whales, 

seeps and vents, led to the stepping stone hypothesis that whale carcasses serve as 

intermediate habitats for the dispersal of vent and seep species (Smith et al. 1989). 

Overlapped species between whale-vent-seep habitats include both specialized 

organisms that first evolved at a specific habitat and then invaded others, and other 

generalist and opportunist species that are able to exploit rich organic conditions over 

vast areas (Bennett et al. 1994, Van Dover et al. 2002). For example, molecular 

evidence suggests that the Bathymodiolinae (Bivalvia: Mytilidae), which are 

symbiont-containing mussels dependent on chemosynthesis, diversified first on whale 

and wood remains before invading vents and seeps (Fisher 1999, Distel et al. 2000, 

Van Dover 2000). On the other hand, molecular data from distinct groups evidenced 

that many evolved first at seep or vent habitats and then colonized deep-sea organic 

habitats (Baco-Taylor et al. 1999, Shank et al. 1999). Phylogenetic patterns also 

suggests that many overlapping species are ubiquitous to whale falls, wood islands, 

vents and seeps, which also supports the stepping stone hypothesis (Distel et al. 2000, 

Van Dover et al. 2002, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Lorion et al. 2009). However, whale 

falls, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps each harbor many endemic species that have 

specific physiological and reproductive adaptations to its environment (Dahlgren et al. 

2004, Glover et al. 2005b). Until sufficient sampling and experimentation is carried 



 

 

63 

on these habitats, knowledge about ecology and the evolutionary potential of these 

habitats will be incomplete. 

The ecology of epifaunal organisms associated with whale carcasses has been 

studied in a few sites, but the effort to study the macrofaunal community thriving at 

sediments nearby whale skeletons has been limited (Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et 

al. 1998). A whale fall study sampled macrofaunal communities in sediments around 

natural whale skeletons in the Pacific, where at the time of sampling the carcasses had 

been in the seafloor for at least 4 years (Smith et al. 1998). The macrofaunal 

community at these carcasses were at an advanced stage in the predicted ecological 

succession, where most of the whale soft tissue and organic matter had been 

decomposed, with very weak evidence of sulfides within the sediments (Smith et al. 

1998). Consequently, the number of specialized organisms in the macrofaunal 

community could not be well evaluated, although a species rich bone-associated fauna 

was described from the same carcass (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998). 

Therefore, long term studies focusing on the sediment macrofauna at whale falls 

along variable stages of succession and biogeochemical conditions can help to 

evaluate long-term patterns on community succession and structure, and further 

investigate levels of species overlap with other chemosynthetic ecosystems. 

This study will focus at the sediment macrofauna around the Santa Cruz whale 

carcass, which was artificially implanted at 1800 m depth in 1998. Following 

deployment, the whale carcass was revisited and sampled at 0.1, 1.5, 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8 

years, corresponding to the most comprehensive and long-term ecological study of a 

whole whale carcass to date. In this study, we will focus on the macrofauna 

community at sediments around the whale carcass during the sulfophilic stage (i.e. 

from 4.5 to 6.8 years after the whale implantation). Therefore, patterns of community 



 

 

64 

structure, succession and species overlap will be evaluated in sediments directly 

influenced by the organic impact from the whale carcass, and available data from 

sediment geochemistry will be used to support our observations (Treude et al. 2009). 

We also compared levels of species overlap between the whale fall macrofauna to 

other organic islands (i.e. kelp and wood parcels) artificially implanted at similar 

ocean depths nearby, and to the San Clemente seep macrofauna situated about 200 

Km southeast. We aimed to address the following hypothesis: 

 

1) Whale falls create sulfophilic habitats with intense organic enrichment in 

sediments nearby, which will affect the macrofaunal community structure and 

succession;  

2) A low degree of species overlap will be observed between the Santa Cruz whale 

fall and other assemblages at southern California seeps, kelp falls and wood falls 

at similar ocean depths.  

 

3.2. Materials and methods 

Study site and sampling 

 

The whale fall was experimentally implanted in Santa Cruz Basin, California 

(33°27’N, 119°22’W, 1675 m, bottom temperature ~ 4ºC, bottom-water oxygen 

concentration 260 µM) in April of 1998 (Figure 1.1-Point A). It is a carcass of a 13-m 

mature gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus Gray, 1864), which weighted 

approximately 30 x 103 kg at the time it was sunk (C. Smith, pers. communication). 

This whale carcass was visited on multiple occasions since its deployment, but this 

study focus on the macrofauna community at sediments from 4.5 y, 5.8 y and 6.8y 



 

 

65 

after whale implantation. Sediment samples were collected using the remotely 

operated vehicle (ROV) Tiburon during three cruises (Oct.2002, Mar.2004 and Feb-

Mar.2005) on board the R/V Western Flyer, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research 

Institute (Appendix 3A). Sampling cores were taken from five randomly radiating 

sampling transects starting immediately close to the carcass, and samples were 

collected at distances of 0, 1, 3, and 9 m from the whale. The sediment macrofauna 

was sampled with 3-5 replicate tube cores from each distance during each cruise. The 

background macrofauna was sampled during 3 distinct cruises in 2002, 2004 and 

2005, totaling 17 replicate tube cores distant at least 9-100 meters from any organic 

island (i.e. whale-fall, kelp or wood parcels). Corers sampled at 9 m from 2005 were 

pooled with the background thus increasing our temporal replication. Based on 

macrofaunal abundance and species composition, there was no evidence of any 

influence from the whale carcass at distances of over 3 m in 2005. All cores assigned 

to macrofauna analysis were sliced on board at 0-1, 1-5 and 5-10 depth intervals and 

preserved in 4% seawater buffered formalin. Replicate cores were also taken at each 

distance to be analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen. 

 

Laboratory analysis 

 

In laboratory, samples were sieved in a 300µm mesh and all organisms were 

stained, sorted and identified at the lowest attainable taxonomic level. Distribution of 

taxa among feeding guilds helped to distinguish temporal and spatial patterns of 

trophic succession around the whale-fall (Fauchald &amp;amp; Jumars 1979, Kukert &amp;amp; Smith 

1992). Sediment samples for organic carbon and nitrogen analysis were acidified to 

remove carbonates by repeated additions of sulfurous acid (8 % v/v) until no 

effervescence was observed (Verardo et al. 1990) and then analyzed using a Perkin-



 

 

66 

Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer, with a limit of detection of 1 mg and 1.2 mg 

for C and N, respectively, while the precision was 0.3 % and 0.4 % for C and N, 

respectively. CHN standards were made with acetanilide and blanks were made of 

both non-acidified and acidified cups, both giving minor signals of TOC and TN. 

A few top-ranked macrofaunal organisms at representative stages of whale-fall 

community succession were selected for stable isotope analysis. Selected individuals 

were sorted using methanol-cleaned forceps and specimens were then rinsed and 

cleaned of attached debris in DI water. Calcareous shelled organisms were decalcified 

with phosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 

ºC). Multiple individuals of the same species Calcareous shelled organisms were 

decalcified with phosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight 

drying (35-40 ºC). Multiple individuals of single species were combined in one 

sample to make up the necessary dry weight of 0.5-2 mg for analysis. Samples were 

combusted in a Eurovector elemental analyzer and resulting N2 and CO2 gases were 

separated by gas chromatography and admitted into an isotope ratio mass 

spectrometer (IRMS) for determination of 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: 

±0.5 ‰ for ?15N and ±0.2 ‰ for ? 13C). Macrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured 

against a Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for 

?15N. Results are expressed as delta (?) notation representing the relative difference 

between sample and standard, where ?X (‰) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x 103, where 

R=15N/14N or R=14C/13C.  

Macroinfaunal organisms were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, potentially 

introducing artifacts in stable isotope values, although shifts in carbon isotope ratio 

are usually small compared to the wide natural C variability in marine food sources 

(Fry &amp;amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et al. 2002). In this study, we 



 

 

67 

corrected for preservation artifacts by adding 1‰ to ? 13C (Baco-Taylor 2002, 

Sarakinos et al. 2002, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Trophic shift boxes from potential 

organic matter sources at the whale-fall helped to determine organisms’ food sources 

(Fry 2006). Trophic changes of +3 ‰ were added to the range of ?15N values 

obtained for each organic matter source (DeNiro &amp;amp; Epstein 1978, Minagawa &amp;amp; Wada 

1984, Fisher et al. 1994). Species that exclusively use a particular organic-matter 

source for nutrition are expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift box. 

 

Video Analysis 

 

Prior to sampling transects, the ROV Tiburon flew over the carcass along 

transects paralleling the long axis of the skeleton.  Surveys were conducted at the 

beginning of the first dive series to avoid ROV disturbance of bacterial mats and 

sediments prior to the survey. Digital pictures were taken from the camera oriented 

vertically downward and helped to estimate bacterial mat and black sediment cover at 

the whale carcass and on the surrounding sediments. ROV altitude was held constant 

at approximately 2 m during transects, and the camera was fired to obtain overlapping 

images. Visual maps of the whale fall were created in 2004 and 2005 from selected 

images that were combined in a mosaic using the computer software Inkscape 

(Freeware). Overlapping portions of images were adjusted according to identifiable 

bone and sediment features, and images were sequentially stretched to correct for 

parallax. The image mosaic was calibrated from images that contained a known scale, 

using the computer software ImageJ (NIH, USA). An absolute length scale was 

obtained from 10-cm diameter circular scale markers dropped on the sediment surface 

around the whale carcass by the ROV. In images with no visual scale, similar 

structures were overlaid at the sediment-water interface (e.g., bone outlines, 



 

 

68 

bioturbation features, sessile benthos) in successive images, and laser scale markers 

were used to calibrate length scales throughout the mosaic. Errors in length estimates 

due to scale calibration at the sediment-water interface are estimated to be &amp;lt;10%. 

 Estimates of absolute areal coverage of microbial mats, and black (presumably 

sulphidic) sediments were for the sediment-water interface within a 50 cm radius of 

the skeleton.  We restricted mat measurements to the 50-cm radius because video 

surveys indicated that all mats occurred within 50 cm of the skeleton in both 2004 and 

2005. In one area, black sediments extended 60 to 70 cm from the skeleton, but this 

was a very small proportion of the total black-sediment area. To facilitate mapping, 

the carcass was divided in three regions: head, thorax and lumbar.  The percentage 

cover in each area was subsequently used to estimate the absolute area of sediment 

coverage in each section from the total sediment area measured in each region in 2004 

and 2005. 

The protrusion of bones above the sediment-water interface and their irregular 

shapes hindered estimates of mat area on the skeleton. Thus, we could only estimate 

percentage cover of bone plan areas by bacterial mats, and skeleton plan area.  The 

use of a real scale was hindered by very variable angles of observation and due to the 

bones arrangement above the seafloor. Direct comparisons of individual bones 

between cruises were also generally not possible. To compare mat coverage between 

2004 and 2005, bones were grouped by type, including mandibles/maxillae, head 

bones, scapulas, ribs and vertebrae. Vertebrae were subsequently subdivided in 

thoracic, lumbar and caudal vertebrae. 

 

Statistical methods 

 



 

 

69 

Total faunal abundance, faunal similarity and diversity were compared among 

distances and time for each treatment type. Total densities around treatments and in 

ambient sediments were examined with One-Way ANOVA if normality of variances 

was present. If homogeneity of variances was not attained, a non-parametric Kruskal-

Wallis test was performed. For significant ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results, post-

hoc tests were used to examine difference in means [statistical package BioEstat? 

(Zar 1996)]. Species diversity was evaluated for pooled replicate cores at each 

distance sampled (n=1-5) due to the low density of metazoans. Hulbert’s rarefaction 

curves (ESn) were used to compare species diversity between treatments (see Chapter 

1). Values of ESn were compared at n=10, n=25 and n=50, where possible. Near 

treatment samples were compared at higher n values, because these samples contained 

higher abundances and were particularly interesting as they were directly influenced 

by the treatments. Background replicate cores (n=17) from 2002, 2004 and 2005 were 

combined to calculate a composite diversity from the background community; with 

confidence limits calculated from pooled cores. A one-tailed 95% confidence interval 

obtained from rarefaction “knots” obtained in each pooled sample was used to 

determine statistical significance [Chapter 2; (Smith 1986)]. Pielou’s evenness (J’) is 

given to provide further information on community structure (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 

2001). The relative abundance of trophic guilds at each period sampled was integrated 

by distance in order to increase the power of statistical analyses. Samples from 0 m 

and 0.5 m were compared against the background in order to evaluate changes in 

trophic structure nearby the whale-fall; and examined with ANOVA or Kruskal-

Wallis. 

Cluster analyses and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on 

species-abundance data from standardized quantitative samples [PRIMER v6, (Clarke 



 

 

70 

&amp;amp; Gorley 2006)] were used to compare community structure across distance and time. 

Square-root transformations were used prior to multivariate analysis in order to 

balance the importance of common and rare species (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). 

Clustering and ordination analyses were often combined to verify mutual consistency. 

Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was performed on standardized quantitative 

samples to determine significant differences between groups (distance and time) and 

dissimilarity percentages identified species contributions to these patterns (SIMPER 

analysis, (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). 

Levels of species overlap between the whale-fall, kelp, wood, and other 

reducing habitats were restricted to direct comparisons of relatively abundant species 

(i.e., over 1% rel. ab.) collected within 0.5 m of the whale carcass, excluding species 

sampled at ambient sediments (i.e. total of 17 background cores from 2002, 2004 and 

2004). We also excluded rare species (less than 1% rel. abundance) from our 

comparisons in order to account for difficulties in taxonomic identification and 

undersampling biases. Comparisons of species overlap with other published studies 

were carried out at the genus and species level in order to account for differences in 

taxonomic identification between studies. 

 

3.3. Results 

Organic enrichment around the whale-fall 

We found evidence of highly patchy organic enrichment in surface sediments 

around the whale during the period analyzed (Fig. 3.1). At 4.5y, sedimentary organic 

carbon was within background levels but reached 11% TOC at 0 m, evidencing the 

meter-scale patchiness of organic enrichment around the carcass (Fig. 3.1). Total 

organic nitrogen (TON) was slightly higher nearby the carcass, but with no significant 



 

 

71 

differences from background sediments (Fig. 3.1). The temporal patterns of TOC and 

TON suggests that the organic enrichment stage in the whale carcass had finished by 

4.5 y (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003).

(±1SD). Background values (±1SD) displayed in shaded gray. 
  
 

Macrofauna density, composition and patterns of succession 

 

Macrofaunal abundance showed marked spatial and temporal differences in 

sediments around the Santa Cruz (SCr) whale fall. Macrofaunal density decreased 

significantly towards background sediments, with spatial differences being observed 

at all periods sampled. At all periods, macrofaunal density at 0 m was over 10 times 

background values (1269 ± 189 ind. m-2; p&lt;0.05; Fig. 3.2, Table 3.1). At 4.5y, 

macrofaunal abundance at 1 m was also higher than background sediments (Kruskal-

Wallis; Table 3.1). Significant higher abundances at 0 to 1 meters from the carcass 

were still evident after 5.8 and 6.8 years of deployment (Kruskal-Wallis test, p&lt;0.05, 

Fig. 3.2, Table 3.1). From 4.5 to 6.8 years, macrofaunal density was still increasing, 

being over 27 times background values in the last period (Fig. 3.2). At all periods 



 

 

72 

evaluated, macrofaunal abundance over 1 m was not different from background 

sediments (Fig. 3.2).

Polychaetes and cumaceans predominantly dominated the macrofauna around 

the carcass (0-1 m) during the three periods sampled (Fig 3.3). At 4.5y, dorvilleid and 

ampharetids polychaetes were massively present in the nearest 0 meters, representing 

near 80% of the macrofaunal individuals (Fig. 3.3). Two dorvilleid species 

(Ophryotrocha sp.A and Ophryotrocha platykephale) were among the top-ranked 

species at 0 m after 4.5y (Table 3.2). A new species of gastropod (Hyalogyrina n.sp.) 

was another dominant species at 0 m, and is extremely abundant in the whale carcass 



 

 

73 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). The chemoautotrophic symbiont-containing mytilid bivalve 

Idas washingtonia was an abundant species at 0 m and up to 3 meters from the 

carcass at 4.5 y. At 0.5 meters, Cumacean sp. K was the dominant species (&gt;50% 

relative abundance), together with dorvilleids, ampharetids and cirratulids (Fig. 3.3). 

The macrofauna over 3 m at 4.5y was typically composed of background species, 

dominated by cirratulid polychaetes. At 5.8 years, dorvilleids and cumaceans 

dominated the macrofauna at 0 m, with ampharetids also abundant at 0.5 m (Fig. 3.3). 

The dominant species at 0 m were the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha (2 spp.) and 

Parougia sp., and two cumacean species, which all accounted for over 60% of all 

individuals (Table 3.2). At 1 m, the macrofauna was dominated by cirratulids typical 

of background sediments, but ampharetids, dorvilleids, and vesicomyd bivalves 

reached high abundances (Fig. 3.3). Sediments at 3 m exhibited a particular mixture 

of background (cirratulids and cossurids) and opportunist species (Parougia sp. A and 

cumaceans; Fig. 3.3). After 6.8 years, the macrofauna within 0 - 0.5 m meters was 

closely similar, with dorvilleids, cumaceans and ampharetids being the dominant 

organisms (Fig. 3.3). The top-ranked species at 0 m included three dorvilleid species, 

two ampharetids and Cumacean sp. K (Table 3.2).  Sediments at 1 meter had a lower 

proportion of opportunistic species if compared to the previous period (5.8 y), 

indicating succession towards background conditions (Fig. 3.3). Background species 

dominated sediments over 3 meters from the whale fall, but some sediment patches 

contained species not typically found on background sediments (Fig. 3.3). 



 

 

74 

 

Figure 3.3. Macrofaunal composition around the whale fall at 4.5y, 5.8y and 6.8y. 
 

Many of the dominant species exhibited significant increases in abundance 

nearby the whale fall but were not found on background areas, which is characteristic 

of disturbance opportunistic species (Grassle &amp;amp; Grassle 1974). From the total of 14 

dorvilleid species identified in sediments nearby the whale carcass, at least 4 species 



 

 

75 

responded opportunistically to the arrival of the whale carcass (Table 3.2). The genus 

Ophryotrocha included at least 3 species that were particularly dominant up to 0.5 

meters and cumaceans were also among the dominant species up to 1 meter from the 

whale-fall but not at background sediments. Two ampharetid species were also 

opportunist species that were exploiting disturbance conditions nearby the whale fall 

(Table 3.2).

Areas with high dominance of opportunist species within 0 – 0.5 m of the 

whale-fall showed significant decreases on community evenness (J’; Fig. 3.4). At 

4.5y, J’ was significantly lower in sediments within 0 - 1 m from the whale-fall, due 

to the dominance of dorvilleids, ampharetids (0 m) and cumaceans (1m, Fig. 3.3; 



 

 

76 

ANOVA, F=4.15, d.f.= 2, p=0.027). At 5.8 y, sediments at 0 m were still heavily 

colonized by opportunistic polychaetes and cumaceans and presented significant 

lower evenness than areas over 0.5 m and background sediments (Fig. 3.3., ANOVA, 

F=7.55, d.f.= 5, p=0.002). The same pattern was observed after 6.8 y, with 0 m 

sediments showing lower community evenness than 0.5 m and areas further away 

from the whale-fall (ANOVA, F=6.11, d.f.= 4, p=0.001). Community evenness also 

varied markedly from 4.5y to 6.8 y at sediments nearby the whale-fall (0 - 1 m). At 1 

m, J’ was significantly lower at 4.5 y if compared to the other periods (5.8 y and 6.8 

y) and background areas (ANOVA, F=3.07, d.f.= 3, p=0.044). Sediments at 0 m had 

higher dominance than background areas during all periods studied (ANOVA, 

F=8.00, d.f.= 3, p=0.001). The spatial and temporal patterns on macrofaunal 

community evenness described above, clearly indicates that areas within 1 m from the 

whale-fall were strongly disturbed at 4.5 y, but not after 5.8 y when significant 

changes in J’ were mainly observed at 0 m. 

 
 
Figure 3.4. Macrofaunal community evenness (Pielou’s J’) at the Santa Cruz whale-fall. 

 

Although significant spatial and temporal differences in community evenness 

were observed, macrofaunal diversity nearby the whale-fall was generally higher than 



 

 

77 

background sediments between 4.5 y and 6.8 y (Fig. 3.5). At 4.5 y, diversity at 1 m 

was significantly lower than background sediments (Fig. 3.5-a). However, 0 m 

sediments and areas further 3 m from the whale-fall at 4.5y had similar or higher 

diversity levels than background (Fig. 3.5-a). At 5.8y, diversity at 1 m markedly 

increased if compared to the previous period and nearby the whale-fall (0 - 1m), 

diversity was comparable to background sediments (Fig. 3.5 –b). In the last period 

analyzed, levels of diversity were higher than background at all distances sampled 

(Fig. 3.5-c). There was evidence of a temporal increase on species diversity around 

the whale-fall (0 m), from 4.5 y to 6.8 y (Fig. 3.6). The temporal increase in species 

diversity nearby the whale-fall was concurrent with the recolonization of previously 

disturbed areas by background species and possibly the arrival of new and rare 

species. At the two latter periods, levels of diversity also increased from 0 m to 3 m 

(Fig. 3.6), likely in response to the augmented richness in those areas which were 

colonized by whale-fall and background species. The augmented diversity towards 

latter stages of succession (6.8 y) supports a change on the habitat structure within the 

continuous of a slightly disturbed community (2002) to a more species rich fauna in 

2005 (Fig. 3.6).

Trophic group analysis 

  

 There were significant changes on trophic-group dominance between the 

whale-fall and background sediments, and from 4.5 y to 6.8 y (Fig. 3.7). At 4.5y, 

omnivores (OMNI) were significantly more abundant at 0 m (Kruskal-Wallis, 

H=47.674, d.f.=11, p=0.001), and subsurface deposit feeders (SSDF) were absent up 

to 1 m sediments (p&lt;0.01; Fig. 3.7). At 1 m, cumaceans were responsible for the 

highest proportion of OTHER trophic group, with significant differences from 

background sediments (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.02). From 3 meters towards 

background areas, surface deposit feeders (SDF) predominate, being typically 

represented by polychaetes. At 5.8 y, the number of OMNI increased from the 

previous period at 0, 0.5 and 1 m sediments, being significantly higher than 

background (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, H=48.262, d.f.=15, p=0.001). The increase in 

OMNI was due to an increased abundance of dorvilleids at sediments within 1 m from 

the whale-fall in these areas if compared to 4.5 y (Fig. 3.3). In the last period (6.8 y), 



 

 

80 

the dominance of OMNI still predominated in areas within 0 – 0.5 meters from the 

whale-fall (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, H=54.3, d.f.=15, p=0.001). The high number of 

cumaceans at 0 m significantly increased the proportion of OTHER relative to 

background areas (Kruskal-Wallis, p&lt;0.05). The elevated contribution of SDF’s at 0 – 

3 m sediments in all periods sampled was typically due to the presence of ampharetid 

polychaetes, whereas cirratulids were the dominant deposit feeders in background 

areas.

Video analysis – coverage of bones and sediment by bacterial mats 

 



 

 

81 

Bone coverage was estimated from 39 and 46 bones in 2004 and 2005 images, 

5.8 and 6.8y respectively (Table 3.3). The lower number of bones observed in 2004 is 

partly due to the larger extent of bacterial mats at this time, often preventing a clear 

delineation of bones. Percent bacterial mat coverage as function of bone type and was 

generally lower in 2005 than in 2004, with statistically significant reductions 

occurring on vertebrae (Table 3.3). 

Head bones and ribs had the highest and most stable coverage of bacterial 

mats   (Table 3.3). These bones were positioned further over the seafloor, which made 

them very visible in all images and possibly prevented the accumulation of sediments 

stirred up by ROV activities in 2004. Such sediment deposition was observed on flat 

bones near the seafloor, such as jaws and scapulae, probably resulting from sediment 

resuspension from the ROV thrusters during the previous dive series in 2002 or 2004.  

There was a significant difference in bacterial mat coverage on the vertebrae between 

years, with thoracic and caudal vertebrae sustaining a ~30% decrease in mat coverage 

from 2004 to 2005 (Table 3.3). Pooling of all vertebrae also yielded a significant 31% 

decrease in mat coverage from 2004 to 2005 (p=0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test; Table 

3.3).

Bacterial mats and black sediments were concentrated in the head and thoracic 

regions of the skeleton (Fig. 3.8; Table 3.4). Around the head, bacterial mat decreased 

in area by over 45%, and black sediments decreased by ~50% between 2004 and 2005 

(Table 3.4). In the thoracic region, the area of black sediment decreased by over 60% 

while the area of bacterial mat increased by 45%. This suggests that bacterial mats 

continued to grow in the thoracic region between 2004 and 2005, i.e., 6.8 years after 

carcass emplacement. The lumbar region had the smallest area of bacterial mat and 

black sediments, with an observed 30% decrease in the area of bacterial mats between 

2004 and 2005. Over the whole carcass, the area of bacterial mats was relatively 

stable, decreasing slightly (7%) between 2004 and 2005. The decrease in mat 

coverage in the head and lumbar regions was offset by the large increase in mat area 

in the thoracic region. However, the area of black sediments patches around the entire 

skeleton decreased by more than 50% between 2004 and 2005. The combined area of 

bacterial mat and black sediments declined ~ 23% between 2004 and 2005, 

suggesting a gradual decline in the availability of sulfide-rich around the carcass over 

this period.

Multidimensional patterns of macrofaunal distribution 

 

The temporal macrofaunal successional around the whale-fall is clearly evidenced 

by the Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis. Broad patterns of 

dissimilarity at all periods were evident between areas around the whale carcass and 

background sediments (Fig. 3.9). Considering the whole period analyzed (4.5y to 6.8y), 

the macrofauna exhibited significant differences between 0 m and areas further 1 m from 

the carcass (ANOSIM, R= 0.445, p=0.001). At 0 m the dominant species Ophryotrocha 

sp. A and Ampharetid sp. 14 responded for over 40% of group similarity  (SIMPER). The 

macrofaunal structure at 0.5 m at the two latter periods (5.8 and 6.8y) was also clearly 

distinct from background areas (ANOSIM, p=0.002).  

 

 
Figure 3.9. Multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) of macrofaunal communities (&gt;300µm) at the 
SCr whale-fall. 
 

The spatial differences between communities nearby the whale-fall and 

background sediments confirm the strong heterogeneity in their dominant species, where 

a mosaic of species from both ends colonized sediments between 1 m and 3 m. At 0 m, 



 

 

85 

temporal differences in community structure were not significant within the period 

analyzed.  

Our first hypothesis that whale-falls create sulfophilic and organic rich habitats 

with influence on macrofaunal community structure was partially supported. After 4.5y, 

the whale-fall sustained a low sediment organic enrichment, but with high sulfide 

availability from 5.8 to 6.8y (i.e. from 2004 to 2005). The distinct sediment geochemistry 

within 0 – 0.5 m from the whale-fall continuously supported a distinct set of species after 

6.8 years. The data suggests that after 4.5y, the minor variability in sediment organic 

carbon between 0 m and background areas could not explain the marked differences on 

community structure. However, the effects of a significant organic input from the whale-

carcass before 4.5 y evidently favored the massive colonization of opportunist species 

and induced higher sedimentary microbial activity (Treude et al. 2009). The spatial 

distribution of bacterial mats over sediments nearby the whale-fall supports that after 5.8 

y, the gradient on sulfide availability has a fundamental role structuring the macrofaunal 

community. 

 

Food web analysis on the macroinfauna around the Santa Cruz Whale carcass 

 

Potential food sources for the macrofauna around whale-falls include sediment 

organic matter (i.e. phytoplankton), metazoan biomass, whale soft tissue and sulfur-

oxidizing bacteria growing over reducing sediments. Whale tissue and bacterial mats 

growing over bones were sampled in the SCr whale-fall, and exhibited very distinct ?15N 

values if compared to the other organic sources (Table 3.5). The most depleted carbon 



 

 

86 

and nitrogen values come from sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, which indicates an organic 

matter of local origin [Table 3.5; (Ruby et al. 1987)]. 

 
Table 3.5. Stable isotope signatures of potential organic sources around the SCr whale-fall. 
 

 
 

 The whale-fall macrofauna exhibited wide ranges on carbon and nitrogen isotope 

signatures. There was no difference on macrofaunal carbon isotope values between years 

sampled (average ?13C of -22.2, -19.7, and -23.6 ‰, for 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8y, respectively). 

Average macrofaunal ?15N was also similar and ranged from 4.3 to 6.1 ‰ (from 4.5 to 

6.8y). Carbon isotope values ranged from -27.6 ‰ for the dorvilleid Ophryotrocha sp.A, 

to -14.4 ‰ for the Dorvilleid n.sp. (Fig. 3.10). Macrofaunal ?15N ranged from -0.6 ‰ to 

12.5 ‰ for the dorvilleid Parougia sp.A and Cumacea sp.K, respectively. The wide 

ranges on isotope signatures for dorvilleids suggest opportunistic feeding on many 

organic sources, including chemoautotrophic sources of nitrogen and carbon for those 

species. The dominant macrofaunal species associated with the whale-fall from 4.5y to 

6.8y had isotope values consistent with primary feeding on the abundant carpets of 

bacteria growing around the whale carcass (Fig. 3.10). Besides sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, 

sediment organic carbon was a potential primary food source for Cumella sp.A and 

dorvilleids (Fig. 3.10). The dominant macrofaunal species did not feed directly on whale 

biomass, and the major reliance on bacterial biomass (i.e. directly or trough the food 



 

 

87 

web) suggests that the community was heavily dependent on chemosynthetic derived 

carbon from 4.5 y to 6.8 y.

Species overlap 
 

 A total of 68 macrofaunal species were collected around the SCr whale-fall (4.5y 

to 6.8y), including 18 species present in background sediments. Rare species (i.e. not 

including bkgd spp. and with &amp;lt;1.0% rel. abundance) accounted for 38% of the total 

species richness (25 spp.). Species that were exclusively found in sediments within 0 – 

0.5 m of the whale-fall represented 22% (15 spp.) of the total richness, increasing to 25 

species when 1 m samples are included. Polychaetes contributed to the majority of the 

species around (up to 0.5m) the whale carcass, with ampharetids (3 spp.), cirratulids (2 



 

 

88 

spp.), dorvilleids (7 spp.) and polynoids (1 spp.) being the most representative. The 

asellote isopod Ilyarachna profunda and the mytilid Idas washingtonia were also 

exclusively sampled within 0.5 m sediments and these species are both abundant on 

whale bones (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003).

Our second hypothesis was supported by the low level of species overlap between 

the SCr whale-fall macrofauna and other reducing habitats in the deep Californian slope. 

Whale and kelp overlap (9% from total spp.), included the ampharetid Samytha cf. 

californiensis, the dorvilleid Ophryotrocha sp.A, two cumaceans (Cumella sp.A and 

Cumacean sp.K), one bivalve species and the gastropod Hyalogirina n.sp. (Table 3.6). 

The number of overlapping species between whale-fall and wood macrofauna was the 

highest among the habitats compared, with 18% of the total species present on both 

habitats (Table 3.6). A few organic respondent opportunist species present at wood and 

kelp falls were also present in the SCr whale fall, which contributed to higher species 

overlap between these organic islands. The number of species common to whale, seeps 

and vents was low (6 and 4%, respectively), and was mostly restricted to the dorvilleids 

Parougia sp.A, Ophryotrocha platykephale, Schistomaringos longicornis and the 

polynoid Bathykurila guaymasensis (Table 3.6). Many of the dorvilleids present in the 

SCr whale-fall are genera that occur in seep and vent ecosystems (e.g. Parougia, 

Ophryotrocha, Exallopus), which highlights the extreme diversity and adaptation of this 

group to reducing environments [Table 3.6, (Dahlgren et al. 2001, Thornhill et al. 2009, 

Wiklund et al. 2009a)]. The overlap of Idas washingtonia between whale, wood, seep and 

vent ecosystems supports the suitability of whale and wood parcels to sustain 

chemoautotrophic symbiosis and the stepping stone hypothesis to dispersal of vesicomyd 

species (Smith et al. 1989, Distel et al. 2000).

3.4. Discussion 

 

Any systematic organic enrichment in surface sediments around the whale-fall 

had disappeared after 4.5y, indicating that the transition between the organic-enrichment 

(OE) and sulfophilic (SU) stages had started (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). The absence of a 

broad-scale organic enrichment at the SCr whale-fall is consistent with sedimentary 

patterns around other natural deep-sea whale carcasses sampled during similar 

successional stages [i.e &gt; 4 y; (Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1998)]. Although the 

whale carcass studied by Smith et al. (1998) was larger than the SCr whale, the former 

had been in the seafloor for much longer at the time of sampling [4 – 36y; (Bennett et al. 

1994)]. The sediments around the SCr whale-fall (0 m) exhibited a strong spatial 

heterogeneity in organic content at 4.5 y, with patches sustaining high organic levels (up 

to 11 % w/w TOC). Visual observations of samples collected in the thoracic whale-fall 

region at 5.8 y also revealed the presence of pieces of whale blubber in a highly anoxic 

sediment (Treude et al. 2009), thus evidencing that sediment patches were still enriched 

organically after 5.8 y. The temporal patterns of organic enrichment from this study 

indicated that organically enriched sediments may persist for &gt; 6 y around large-sized 

(i.e. &gt; 10 ton) whale-falls. 

The broad spatial distribution of bacterial mats around the whale skeleton for over 

6 years evidenced the wide availability of pore water sulfides. Bacterial mats and black 

(i.e. anoxic and sulphidic) sediments occupied a larger area around the thoracic and head 

regions, which is spatially consistent with pore-water sulfide fluxes and bacterial 

abundance around the SCr whale-fall (Treude et al. 2009). The temporal decrease on the 



 

 

91 

covered area by bacterial mats and black sediments indicated a decline in the overall 

availability of free sulfides between 5.8 to 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009). The bacterial mat 

coverage around the SCr whale-fall is strikingly higher than other whale skeletons at 

similar successional stages. In the Santa Catalina whale-fall (SC), concentrations of 

sediment sulfides and abundance of sediment bacteria were low by 4 y, but bone surfaces 

were still covered by bacterial mats (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998). Sediments 

sustain faster microbial degradation rates of any available organic source, as opposed to 

the degradation of bone lipids from the hard bone matrix, which is mediated in the 

skeleton by specialized bone eating worms (Smith et al. 1998, Glover et al. 2005b, 

Treude et al. 2009). As a result, the lower degradation of bone lipids may extend the 

temporal availability of sulfides sustaining bacterial growth on bone surfaces for periods 

of over 6 y (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Although sediments around whale-

falls sustain sulfate reduction and methanogenesis for over 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009), the 

processes over bone surfaces likely lasts longer. Consequently, differences in the access 

to organic sources, microbial sulfate reduction rates and sulfide release are markedly 

distinct between bones and sediments around whale carcasses, and have primary 

importance controlling the magnitude and durability of reducing conditions. 

The large area of sediments covered by bacterial carpets nearby the whale-fall is 

equivalent in size to visual measurements from typical chemosynthetic habitats such as 

seeps and vents (Sahling et al. 2002, Treude et al. 2003, Levin et al. 2009). This suggests 

that whale carcasses impact similar areas of deep seafloor than cold seeps and 

hydrothermal vents (Bennett et al. 1994, Deming et al. 1997, Treude et al. 2009). Due to 

the rapid degradation of whale organics in the sediments, the production of sulfide is 



 

 

92 

shorter in whales if compared to seeps and vents (Treude et al. 2009). However, if 

compared to other organic reducing habitats (e.g. wood, kelp and other mammalian 

carcasses), whale-falls may provide the best conditions to sustain chemosynthesis-based 

nutrition (Smith 2006, Glover et al. 2008). Whale carcasses typically are larger and 

composed of high quality organic matter, which includes about 60 % of lipids by weight 

(Smith 2006). In the lower range of organic enrichment are kelp and wood falls that 

sustain only low levels of sulfide production in nearby sediments and for very short 

periods (Hannides 2008). The same occur with small-sized mammalian bones (e.g. 

cetaceans, cow bones), which are rapidly processed by scavengers and do not typically go 

through the EO and SU stages (Jones et al. 1998, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Although the 

mammalian skeletons might have enough lipid reserves to sustain minor bacterial growth 

and chemosynthesis, their potential to sustain macrofaunal chemosynthesis is clearly 

limited (Jones et al. 1998, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Glover et al. 2008, Jones et al. 2008). 

Macrofaunal abundance was enhanced by 5-10 times around the whale-fall for 

over 6 y, despite any broad scale organic enrichment after 4.5 y. Macrofaunal density had 

a pronounced small scale variability within 0.5 m, which is consistent with the patchy 

organic enrichment encountered. The macrofauna was dominated by organic opportunist 

species, defined by individuals that attained significant abundances at the whale carcass 

but were rarely present in background sediments (Grassle &amp;amp; Grassle 1974). The lower 

community evenness nearby the whale-fall is a similar pattern observed at point sources 

of organic enrichment in shallow water sediments (Pearson &amp;amp; Rosenberg 1978). 

Sulfophilic species (e.g. Idas washingtonia) were additionally abundant from 4.5 to 6.8 y, 

which indicates the temporal overlap between the EO and the SU stages (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 



 

 

93 

2003, Treude et al. 2009). The long temporal development of the EO stage within the 

sediments (&gt; 4.5 yrs) could be a function of the large size of the whale carcass, and 

suggests that sediment communities may experience a longer enrichment stage than 

typically observed on whale-bones [about 2 y; (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003)]. At the whale 

epifauna, the EO stage ends with a rapid removal of whale tissue attached to bones, 

which becomes unavailable to large scavengers as they fall over surrounding sediments. 

The SCr whale-fall had a prolonged duration of the EO stage than other carcasses located 

from depths of 200 to 2800 m (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Goffredi et al. 2004, Smith 2006, 

Fujiwara et al. 2007). The difference on successional dynamics are driven by factors 

influencing the whale-fall degradation including carcass size, distinct colonizing species 

(e.g. scavenger communities), and depth (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Although each whale-fall 

is apparently colonized by several distinct species (Fujiwara et al. 2007), the macrofaunal 

succession is driven by facilitation models and organic availability, which maintains the 

ecological function within each stage of succession (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003).  

Background species were rarely seen nearby the whale-fall, possibly avoiding 

extreme sedimentary reducing conditions and enhanced predation (Smith et al. 1998). 

The recolonization of background species (e.g. Cossura rostrata) to sediments at 1 m and 

0.5 m after 6.8 y, suggests that the succession was leading towards background 

conditions as observed at other deep-sea whale carcass in the North Pacific (Smith et al. 

1998). The dominant species colonizing sediments near the whale-fall were never 

sampled in background areas. High densities of dorvilleid polychaetes, cumaceans and 

ampharetids lowered species diversity near the SCr whale-fall at 4.5 y, similar to 

observed at hydrothermal vents and cold seep sediments (Grassle et al. 1985, Levin 2005, 



 

 

94 

Levin et al. 2009). This suggests that the flux of reduced chemicals at the whale-fall at 

4.5 y had a similar effect on the species structure as in other reducing habitats. Besides 

continuous sulfide availability at 5.8 and 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009), the macrofaunal 

community was more diverse than background sediments, which was influenced by 

increased richness of organic enrichment species (i.e. dorvilleids and ampharetids). At 

least 14 dorvilleid species colonized whale-fall sediments (i.e. 0 – 0.5 m) between 4.5 and 

6.8 y, rivaling or even exceeding the high species richness for this group at cold seeps 

(Levin et al. 2000, Levin et al. 2003). This supports the hypothesis for resource 

partitioning among dorvilleids within sulfide rich habitats (Levin et al. 2003) and 

suggests that whale-falls provide optimal evolutionary microhabitats for this group. This 

indicates that the sediment macrofauna can host an unexpected diverse community if 

compared to background assemblages, as observed for the whale-fall epifauna (Baco-

Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003). 

Whale falls exhibit higher macrofaunal diversity than soft sediment habitats at 

hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. A comparison of active and inactive hydrothermal 

vent sediments in the Pacific revealed low rarefaction diversity levels at all sites, with 

microbial mat sediments sustaining the highest diversity (Levin et al. 2009). Microbial 

mat habitats at cold seep sites typically exhibit higher diversity than vent sediments 

(Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003)], and can exhibit similar diversity levels than the 

SCr whale-fall [(ES(100)=16 – 17 at 0 m]. However, mat habitats at seep and vent 

sediments typically have lower diversity if compared to background areas, whereas the 

SCr whale-fall sustained higher species diversity than ambient sediments after 5.8 y. 

Diversity levels at whale fall sediments are also significantly higher than sediments 



 

 

95 

around wood and kelp-falls at similar ocean depths. The higher diversity at later stages of 

succession is explained by the colonization of sulfophilic and heterotrophic species, many 

of those supported by chemosynthetic organic carbon and exhibiting a wide range of 

feeding modes. 

The broad range of carbon sources and trophic levels found in the SCr 

macrofaunal community supports the existence of complex food webs in the sediments 

(Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Chemosynthetic-symbiont species such as the mytilid Idas 

washigtonia were abundant in sediments from 4.5 to 6.8 y, but did not reach the high 

densities observed over whale bones (Baco-Taylor &amp;amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). 

Several trophic levels derived their nutrition direct or indirectly from sulfur-oxidizing 

bacterial mats, evidencing that whale-falls provide abundant sources of chemosynthetic 

carbon like cold seeps and hot vents (Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002, Levin et al. 2009, Thurber 

et al. 2009). The broad isotopic range in multiple congeneric dorvilleid species supports 

the existence of sedimentary microhabitats with abundant sulfur-bacterial carbon. 

Californian seeps may also offer broad evolutionary habitats for dorvilleids based on 

wide ranges in carbon isotopic signatures and coexistence of several congeneric species 

feeding on bacteria (Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002, Levin et al. 2003). The strong reliance on 

chemosynthetic carbon sources at the SCr whale-fall between 4.5 and 6.8 y is in sharp 

contrast to the simple sediment food webs encountered at younger whale skeletons (&amp;lt;1.5 

y) at the Californian slope (Baco &amp;amp; Smith in prep). At large whale carcasses, the fauna 

shifts from an early dependence on whale organics (i.e. bone lipids and soft tissue) 

towards a late reliance on chemosynthesis (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). The reliance on 



 

 

96 

bacterial carbon between 4.5 and 6.8 y for most of the sediment macrofauna supports that 

during the SU stage the food web is similar to the whale epifauna. 

At higher taxonomic levels (i.e. family or genus), the macrofauna from the SCr 

whale fall exhibits stronger commonalities to other organic islands, seeps and vents. 

Dorvilleids and ampharetids polychaetes are common at a few Pacific hydrothermal 

sediments and at many cold seep sites in the Californian and Alaskan margins (Levin 

2005, Levin et al. 2009). At the species level, the SCr whale-fall exhibited limited species 

overlap with other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep Californian slope, confirming our 

second hypothesis. Levels of species overlap were higher between whale- and wood-falls, 

possibly due to closer proximity between the two (~ 100 m) and to the longer organic 

enrichment effects created by wood parcels if compared to kelps. Wood and kelp 

overlaps with the SCr whale fall were mainly represented by cumaceans (Cumella and 

Cumacea sp.K), and the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha sp.A and Parougia sp.A. The 

dorvilleid Ophryotrocha platikephale and the polynoid Bathykurila guaymasensis occur 

at whale-falls and vents, but the latter represent potentially two genetically distinct 

species (Glover et al. 2005a). The dorvilleid genus Parougia, Ophryotrocha and 

Schistomaringos common to whale, seeps and vents, are mostly represented by 

heterotrophic dorvilleid polychaetes, but these include a broad range of morphologically 

distinct species and supports the limited species overlap. The overlaps between whales, 

seeps and vents are typically species that are attracted to concentrations of free sulfides 

and that exploit sulfur-based microbial chemoautotrophic production. These conditions 

are typically encountered at microbial mat habitats and supports that the flux of sulfides 

may be qualitatively similar between whale-falls and seeps or vents (Treude et al. 2009). 



 

 

97 

The overlap of chemosynthetic-symbiont species was limited to Idas washingtonia, 

which is part of a mytilid group abundant at both seeps, vents and wood-falls (Samadi et 

al. 2007, Lorion et al. 2009). Other unidentified vesicomyd bivalves colonized whale-fall 

sediments, but the macrofauna had a limited number of chemoautotrophic species if 

compared to the epifaunal communities (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). These could be a function 

of limited sampling on the whale-fall macrofauna, due to the unfavorable and patchy 

biogeochemical gradients within the sediments and even intense predation limiting the 

development of adult symbiont-containing species.  

 The SCr whale-fall sediment macrofauna appeared to host a few endemic species 

that attained high abundances but were never sampled at background sediments or any 

other organic islands sunk nearby. At least three unidentified ampharetids, and two 

dorvilleid species (Ophryotrocha sp.E and Exallopus sp.A) were extremely abundant 

nearby the whale carcass and may represent specialists. Dorvilleids of the genus 

Ophryotrocha are commonly associated with organically enriched or polluted sediments 

and exhibit surprisingly high species richness (Dahlgren et al. 2001, Wiklund et al. 

2009a). It is clear that further taxonomic and phylogenetic efforts on the whale-fall 

dorvilleids [&gt; 40 spp., (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003)], will increase the number of whale-fall 

endemics. Where sufficient data is available, several whale-fall specialists have been 

described, with at least 20 species being exclusively found on whale skeletons and many 

other new species await identification (Baco &amp;amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, 

Dahlgren et al. 2004, Glover et al. 2005b, Pleijel et al. 2008). The number of whale fall 

endemics inhabiting sediments will certainly grow with the use of molecular tools to 

differentiate cryptic species associated with whales (Vrijenhoek 2009, Wiklund et al. 



 

 

98 

2009b). Whale carcasses are one of the least studied chemosynthetic habitats in the deep-

sea (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003), and the sediment macrofauna has been vastly understudied in 

worldwide efforts to document whale-fall diversity. 

The long persistence of whale falls over the deep-sea (&gt; 20 – 30 yrs) allied to the 

complex suite of niches over whale bones and in sediments, create oasis of opportunity 

for species able to colonize it and disperse (Smith et al. 1989, Distel et al. 2000, Baco &amp;amp; 

Smith 2003, Schuller et al. 2004). Whale carcasses are undoubtedly among the most 

species rich hard-substrata habitat in the deep-sea (Baco &amp;amp; Smith 2003), and this study 

evidenced that the sediment macrofauna is more diverse than other similar reducing 

habitats and background sediments. Whale-falls are colonized by a broad range of 

abundant sulfophilic and organic respondent species that are not seen over vast areas of 

deep-sea sediments. As observed at seep and vent habitats, many species colonizing 

modern whale falls have irradiated from other reducing habitats (e.g. seeps, vents, wood-

falls, fish farms), supporting the stepping stone theory (Smith et al. 1989, Baco-Taylor et 

al. 1999, Distel et al. 2000, Van Dover et al. 2002, Lorion et al. 2009, Wiklund et al. 

2009b). The fact that the whale-fall macrofauna sustain higher diversity levels than 

similar sulfide rich communities in the deep-sea, suggests that carcasses concentrate a 

vast and unknown number of species that exploit reducing habitats in the deep-sea. 

The evolutionary story of whale-falls dates back at least 11-30 Myr, and together 

with seeps and wood-falls provided habitats for a broad range of taxonomic and 

functional groups in deep-sea (Baco et al. 1999, Kiel &amp;amp; Goedert 2006, Smith 2006). 

Several species only found at whale carcasses are directly dependent on bones [e.g. 

Osedax worms, (Rouse et al. 2004)], and many others that attain extremely high densities 



 

 

99 

at carcasses are also likely specialists on this habitat (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003, Smith 2006). 

This suggests that during the evolutionary lifetime, whale-falls harbored a variety of taxa 

and trophic types that may be adapted to the resources provided by its habitats (Smith 

2006). Consequently, as whale-fall communities harbor one of the most species rich 

deep-sea reducing habitats, whale exploitation by humans may pose great impact on 

global deep-sea diversity (Smith 2006). 

 
 
3.5. Conclusions 
 
  

In contrast to the sediment macrofauna studied around other deep-sea whale-

skeletons, the SCr macrofauna appeared to host a remarkable species diversity composed 

of many rare species not seen on background assemblages. The whale-fall supported 

large opportunist and chemoautotrophic communities for over 6.8 y, with only modest 

organic enrichment but with marked chemical impacts on the surrounding sediments. 

After 4.5 y, the SCr whale-fall macrofauna appeared to match the transition between the 

organic-enrichment and the sulfophilic stages described by Smith and Baco (2003), 

possibly indicating a longer successional periods at the sediments. The whale-fall 

macrofauna had high numbers of species not present in background sediments, and 

significantly increase local species diversity for at least 7 yrs. The sediments around the 

SCr whale-fall exhibited higher diversity levels than other similar habitats at cold seeps 

and hydrothermal vents, with low level of species overlap, confirming that whale-falls are 

unique oasis of deep-sea biodiversity across wide ocean basis.

Chapter 4. The San Clemente cold seep: macrofaunal structure 

and species overlap with reducing habitats in the deep NE 

Pacific 
 

 

Abstract 

The San Clemente cold seep lies within 100-200 km of other reducing 

environments in the NE Pacific, offering an interesting opportunity to examine 

diversity and species overlap among reducing habitats (i.e., whale-falls, kelp, and 

wood parcels) at similar ocean depths. Using Alvin, we observed clumps of 

tubeworms Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata distributed as meter-scale 

patches among vesicomyd clam beds and black sediments. We used core samples and 

stable isotopic analyses to evaluate infaunal macrobenthic community structure and 

nutrition sources of dominant organisms at distances of 0, 1, 10 and 100 m from 

tubeworm thickets. Macro-infaunal abundance was elevated at 0 to 1 meters 

compared to seep sites 100 m away. Mats of Siboglinum sp. were conspicuous in 

sediments within 1 m of tubeworm thickets (2906 ± 606 ind m-2 at 0 m). Other 

polychaete worms dominated macrofaunal abundances at all distances sampled (over 

60% of individuals), with tanaids (11%) and isopod crustaceans also being abundant. 

Species richness and diversity were slightly depressed at seep sites, increasing 

outwards from worm clumps. The San Clemente seep sediment macrofaunal 

community contains intermediate levels of species richness and diversity compared to 

other seep areas. Stable isotope data showed high variability in ?C13 values for 

distinct faunal groups (polychaetes and crustaceans), as has been observed at other 

seeps. Overall, &amp;lt;20% species overlap was found between the San Clemente seep and 

wood-, whale- and kelp-fall communities at similar ocean depths within the region.

4.1. Introduction 

 

 Cold seeps occur in geologically active and passive continental margins at 

depths from 15m to over 7000 m, where the seepage of reduced chemical substances 

fuel chemosynthesis-based benthic communities (Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Levin 2005). 

Submarine fluid venting of methane and other hydrocarbon gasses support high 

surface and sub-surface concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, which is produced by 

microbial anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction (Boetius et al. 

2000, Treude et al. 2003). The upward flow of sulfide and/or methane provides 

energy for chemosynthetically based microorganisms, either free-living or in 

symbiotic association with metazoans (Barry et al. 1997, Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Levin 

2005). Most symbiont-bearing invertebrates are megafaunal groups with broad 

biogeographic distributions and include vesicomyd clams, mytilid and solemyid 

bivalves, vestimentiferan and pogonophoran polychaetes (Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Kojima 

2002, Van Dover et al. 2002, Levin 2005). These organisms commonly make up the 

highest megafaunal biomass at seeps and are fundamentally dependent on the flux of 

reducing compounds for their nutrition (Barry et al. 1997). Giving that sulfide and 

methane fluxes can be remarkably heterogeneous in space and time, distinct patterns 

of faunal distribution occur between habitats at each geological feature (Barry et al. 

1997, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Treude et al. 2003, Van Dover et al. 

2003, Levin 2005).  

Several investigations have looked and compared infaunal community 

structure at cold seeps from shelf to abyssal depths (Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Levin et al. 

2000, Kojima 2002, Sahling et al. 2002, Van Dover et al. 2003, Levin 2005, Levin &amp;amp; 

Mendoza 2007). These studies revealed high habitat variability on macrofaunal

density, composition and diversity, with strong differences between seep and non-

seep sediments at deeper sites (Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). Sediment 

geochemistry can vary significantly between seep microhabitats, creating very 

specific conditions for its associated community (Tryon &amp;amp; Brown 2001). For 

example, sulfide-rich sediments host many chemosynthetic-based and endemic 

species, such as Beggiatoa mats, bivalves, pogonophoran and other polychaetes 

(Barry et al. 1997, Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Thurber 

et al. 2009). Several heterotrophic opportunist species are also able to tolerate such 

high sulphidic sediments and exploit rich organic sources in some seep habitats 

(Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). Consequently, there is a broad spectrum on 

the utilization of chemosynthetic- or photosynthetic-derived organic carbon in the 

heterotrophic macrofauna, which is linked to habitat heterogeneity and availability of 

many organic sources within seeps (Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). Such availability is 

related to bathymetric variations on chemosynthetic versus ambient organic 

availability (Levin et al. 2000, Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). 

The San Clemente cold seep was discovered in 1979 and first described as a 

vent ecosystem (Lonsdale 1979). It has been poorly sampled with only 3 megafaunal 

organisms formally described: the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia barhami, a general 

species of vesicomyid and a bryozoan (Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998). The macroinfauna from 

San Clemente has not been studied in detail and its position and depth (1800 m) offer 

an interesting opportunity to investigate species overlap among other reducing 

habitats at the Southern Californian slope. The San Clemente seep lies downstream of 

three implanted whales, kelp and wood-falls at similar depths in the California basin, 

which could serve as a recruitment source for invertebrates exploiting sulfide-rich 

conditions (Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Some of the enrichment opportunist and sulfide-



 

 

114 

tolerant species are common to reducing deep-sea habitats such as vents, whale- and 

wood-falls (Levin et al. 2006, Smith et al. in prep). Whale-falls in particular have 

been proposed as dispersal stepping-stones for organisms (e.g. vesicomyids) thriving 

at deep reducing habitats, but so far only a limited overlap of species has been 

demonstrated (Smith et al. 1989, Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998, Tunnicliffe et al. 1998, Baco-

Taylor et al. 1999, Smith &amp;amp; Baco 2003). Difficulty in sampling has made quantitative 

studies of species richness in these communities rare and comparisons of species 

overlap between these sites at single basins are practically absent. 

 The primary objective of this study was to examine the structure and 

composition of the macroinfauna at the San Clement seep and investigate levels of 

species overlap with a whale-fall and other organic islands situated at about 100 km 

northwest of the seep site (Fig. 1.1). We also investigated nutrition sources of 

abundant macroinfauna at seep habitats through stable isotope analysis and compared 

species diversity at several distances from “seep areas” to ambient communities, and 

to other comparable seep environments. We ask the following questions: (1) What is 

the level of macrofaunal species overlap between San Clemente seep and other 

assemblages from reducing habitats at similar depths? (2) What is the level of 

macroinfaunal endemism at the San Clemente seep and how species composition 

change relative to ambient sediments? We hypothesized that the macroinfauna will 

exhibit low levels of overlap among other organic habitats at the California margin 

and that species composition at seep sediments will be markedly distinct from 

ambient assemblages. 

 

4.2. Study site and methods 

  



 

 

115 

The San Clemente seep is located at 1800 m depth on a transform fault off the 

coast of southern California at 32? 12? N; 117? 44? W (Chapter 1 - Fig. 1.1). Large 

barium sulfate deposits occur as large blocks on the seafloor (Torres et al. 2002), 

often anchoring thickets of tubeworms Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata 

(Fig. 4.1 A-B). Vesicomyid clams (Calyptogena pacifica) are also common 

megafaunal organisms often seen nearby worm thickets (Fig. 4.1). Worm thickets 

were often surrounded by clam patches, usually located within darkened sediments 

with presumably high sulfide levels (Fig. 4.1 C-D). Reported methane analyses at the 

site indicate very heterogeneous pore-water concentrations within the top 10 cm 

sediments, which are higher adjacent to tubeworm thickets [0m, 12-46 µl/ml; (Torres 

et al. 2000)].  

Sediment macrofauna was sampled in October 1999 on board of the R/V 

Atlantis using the manned submersible Alvin (Table 4.1). Replicate sediment samples 

were collected immediately adjacent to tubeworm thickets (0 m), and at 1 m, 10 m 

and over 100 meters away, which represented background samples (Table 4.1). 

Corers were sliced at three vertical sections (0-1, 1-5 and 5-10cm) and sediments 

were immediately preserved in 10% v/v buffered formalin-seawater solution onboard 

the ship. Once in the laboratory, samples were washed on 300 um sieves and 

transferred to 80% ethanol.  Macrofauna (&gt;300 um) were sorted using dissecting 

microscopes and individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible 

using the available keys and with help from taxonomists. Reference individuals from 

this seep were compared directly to the southern California basin whale falls 

reference collection in order to evaluate the species overlap between macroinfaunal 

communities. Digital stills and video taken throughout the Alvin dives helped to 

visually distinguish seep habitats (Fig. 4.1).

2) due to differences in sampled areas between Alvin tube and Ekman corers (38.5 and 

78.5 cm2, respectively). Community composition was assessed by sample 

independent analyses in order to reduce effects of sampling area on diversity 

estimates. Hulbert’s rarefaction curve [ES(n);(Hulbert 1971)] was used to compare 

species diversity between treatments. Background replicate cores (n=5) were 

combined to calculate a composite diversity for the ambient community, and 

confidence limits were calculated from one-tailed 95% confidence interval [see 

Chapters 2 and 3; (Smith 1986)]. Pielou’s evenness (J’) was used to provide 

information on species structure using the statistical package PRIMER-E ? (Clarke &amp;amp; 

Warwick 2001). Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) was applied to macrofaunal 

abundance (? transformed) in order to emphasize similarity in species composition 

among habitats (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). Multivariate analysis of similarities 

(ANOSIM) helped to differentiate samples and SIMPER analysis identified groups or 

species responsible for those patterns (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick 2001). Statistical indexes 

were calculated with parametric or non-parametric methods whenever applicable, 

using the statistical software BioEstat?. 

Dominant macrofaunal organisms from sediment samples at 0 and 1 m were 

selected for stable isotope analysis. All selected specimens were thoroughly rinsed in 

DI water and cleaned of attached debris prior to analysis. Polychaetes were removed 

from tubes and muscle tissues of bivalves (i.e. avoiding gills) were dissected using 

methanol-cleaned equipment. Samples were decalcified with phosphoric acid and 

placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 ºC). Multiple individuals 

of the same species (N= 3 to 13) were combined in one sample to make up 0.5-2 mg 

of dry weight, necessary for analysis. Whenever possible, replicate measurements of 

grouped individuals were carried and stable isotope data represent average values

within single species. We recognize the potential for nutritional variability within 

seep individuals (Thurber et al. 2009), but we believe that the data is still informative 

of food web patterns at our study site. Unfortunately, we lack isotope data from a 

broad number of background species and from potential organic sources from San 

Clemente, and therefore we do not present mixing-model calculations of organic 

sources for the organisms analyzed. Statistical comparisons of isotope values across 

species were not possible due to limited number of replicates available, therefore 

differences are conservatively assumed based on standard error from measurements. 

Isotope samples were combusted in a Eurovector (Milan, Italy) elemental 

analyzer interfaced with an Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer for 

determination of 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: ±0.5 ‰ for ?15N and 

±0.2 ‰ for ? 13C). Macrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured against a Pee Dee 

Belemnite (PDB) standard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for ?15N. Results are 

expressed in units per mil (‰) as delta notation (?) representing the relative 

difference between sample and standard, where ?X (‰) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x 

103, where R=15N/14N or R=14C/13C. In this study, we corrected for preservation 

artifacts by adding 1‰ to ? 13C (Fry &amp;amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et 

al. 2002). Trophic changes of +3‰ were added to the range of ?15N values obtained 

for each organic matter source. Species that exclusively use a particular organic-

matter source for nutrition are expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift 

box. 

4.3. Results 

Image observations 



 

 

119 

Video images from Alvin dives permitted the identification of distinct macro-

habitats, such as tubeworm thickets, vesicomyid clam beds, black sediments and non-

reduced sediments (Fig. 4.1). From Alvin images we could not visually identify the 

spatial distribution of siboglinid polychaetes, as these were typically small (&amp;lt;3-5 cm) 

and not detected by video. Tubeworm thickets (i.e. vestimentiferans) were either 

anchored on barium sulfate rocks or aggregated within patches of blackened 

sediments widely distributed over the seep. Clam aggregations were commonly 

observed within dark sediment patches that were not colonized by tubeworms, and 

clamshell fragments were often seen around tubeworm patches (Fig. 4.1). Black 

sediments were heterogeneously distributed around tubeworm thickets, being 

interrupted by areas of light colored sediments without clams (Fig. 4.1). Sediments 

coring randomly started immediately under tubeworm thickets towards background 

sediments 100 meters away. 

 

Macrofauna density and composition 

 Total macrofaunal densities were significantly higher at 0 and 1-meter 

sediments if compared to the background (Kruskal Wallis test, H=9.68, p=0.02). 

Average densities at 0 m were over two times higher than background sediments 

(2378 ± 257 ind. m-2; Fig. 4.2). At 0 and 1m, siboglinid polychaetes were extremely 

abundant (2906 ± 606 ind. m-2 and 1652 ± 257 ind. m-2, respectively), and 

heterogeneously distributed within patches but their abundance was not different 

between 0 and 1 meters (ANOVA). Sediment patches colonized by siboglinid worms 

were present 10 meters away from tubeworm thickets with dense mats in some areas. 

The vertical macrofaunal distribution within the sediments did not reveal any 



 

 

120 

significant patterns between distances sampled, suggesting weak gradients of pore-

water sulfides in the area (Kruskal Wallis test). 

 

Figure 4.2. Total macrofaunal density at seep and background sites (Average ± 1 SE). 

 

Polychaete worms typically dominated the macrofauna at all distances 

sampled with over 65% of all individuals. Polychaete dominance changed markedly 

across the seep areas sampled. At 0 and 1 m, Siboglinum sp. 1 represented over 25% 

of the fauna (Fig. 4.3), and was among the top-ranked species up to 10 meters (Table 

4.2). A tanaid species, one syllid polychaete and one thyasirid bivalve were among 

the top ranked species at 0 meters, and together with Siboglinum sp. 1 comprised over 

58% of all individuals. The dorvilleids Meiodorvillea and Pinniphitime were found at 

San Clemente seep but never reached high abundances, always comprising 1-5% of 

the macrofauna from 0 to 10 meters (Appendix 4A). At 10 meters, spionid (15%), 

cirratulid (12%) and other polychaete worms (25%) were dominant, a pattern similar 

to background sediments (Fig. 4.3). Tanaids were abundant at 0 to 1m sediments (8-

13% of rel. abundance) and thyasirid bivalves were common at all seep and non-seep 

areas sampled, comprising 4-7% of the infauna at all sites (Fig. 4.3; Appendix 4A).

Macrofaunal diversity, species overlap and multidimensional community analysis 

Macrofaunal diversity increased from 0 m towards background sediments, 

peaking at 10 meters (ES50=24.6). Low diversity levels at 0 m sediments were 

associated with significant lower community evenness at 0 m (ANOVA, F=4.985, 

d.f.=3, p=0.011; Table 4.3) if compared to all other distances sampled. At 1 - 10 

meters, community evenness exhibited background values, but diversity was higher 

due to the presence of seep (e.g. Siboglinum sp. 1) and ambient species. Rarefaction 

diversity did not reveal significant differences between seep and non-seep areas, 

although 0 m curves fell below background (Table 4.3; Fig. 4.4). Expected species 

diversity suggests that the number of species at 0 meters was still increasing rapidly 

with the increase in the number of individuals (Fig. 4.4). Although E (S50) was lower 

at 0 m if compared to 1 m, the former curve is steeper than all other sampled areas 

and suggests higher species richness at 0 m (Fig. 4.4).

Figure 4.4. Rarefaction species diversity at San Clemente cold seep. 

Multidimensional analysis revealed a strong spatial heterogeneity in 

macrofaunal composition at the San Clemente seep sediments (Fig. 4.5). In general, 

seep habitats were very heterogeneous with no significant difference in species 

composition (ANOSIM test, r= 0.303), although samples from 0 m and 1 m grouped 

distinctly from the others (Fig. 4.5). Similarities within seep sites were low (25 - 30%, 

at 0 m and 1 m), and increased towards background areas (54%, SIMPER). Higher 

dissimilarity at seep areas closer to tubeworm thickets corroborates the strong spatial 

sediment heterogeneity observed. The top-ranked species responded for most of the 

observed dissimilarity. Siboglinum sp. 1 was a key species determining high 

dissimilarities between 0 and 1 m sediments, and spionids, cossurids and tanaidaceans 

were most significant at 10 m and background sediments (SIMPER). 



 

 

124 

 

Figure 4.5. Multidimensional scaling plot of San Clemente seep macroinfauna (&gt; 300µ).  
 

A total of 74 species were identified at the San Clemente seep macrofauna. 

Species richness was highly heterogeneous between seep areas, with 34 of 58 species 

exclusively sampled from 0 to 1 meters. There were a few seep species abundant at 0 

and 1m that were not seen or were rare at non-seep areas (i.e. less than 5% rel. 

abundance). These include two top ranked species at seep sites: Siboglinum sp. 1, and 

Sphaerosyllis sp. A. At “non-seep” areas, only the top-ranked Tanaid sp. E was 

abundant at background sediments and not at 0 m sediments. 

The number of species overlapping with other reducing habitats at the 

Californian slope was limited. About 12 % of the macrofaunal species abundant at 0 

and 1 m (i.e. “seep” species), were encountered at sediments around wood parcels 

(Bernardino et al. in prep), and 9% were shared with whale-fall sediments (Smith et 

al., in prep). The overlapped species are typical heterotrophic organisms (i.e. grazers 

and predators), with only thyasirid bivalves potentially deriving their nutrition from 

chemosynthesis (Dando &amp;amp; Spiro 1993). Shared species between seep and wood (n= 4 

spp.) included the ampharetid polychaete Amelina abyssalis, Thyasirid sp. 2, an 



 

 

125 

asellote isopod and Aricidea cf. lopezi. Overlapped species between whale and seep 

(n= 3 spp.) included Ampharetid sp. 1 and two paranoid species of the Aricidea 

complex. No species from the seep were observed around kelp parcels, and none of 

the top-ranked species from San Clemente colonized any organic island. 

 

Stable isotope analysis 

 

Stable isotope analyses were carried on six abundant macrofaunal species 

from 0 and 1 m (Fig. 4.6). The number of individuals analyzed for each species 

ranged from N=3 to 13, and carbon and nitrogen isotope values revealed wide 

nutritional dependence on food sources (Fig. 4.6). Macrofaunal carbon isotope 

signatures ranged from -57.4‰ to -23‰ and nitrogen values from -7.4‰ to 11.6‰, 

suggesting both chemosynthetic and heterotrophic nutrition. The average carbon and 

nitrogen isotope values of the top-ranked species at 0 m and 1 m (-39.7‰ and -0.6‰, 

respectively), suggests utilization of chemosynthetically fixed organic matter (Fisher 

1999, Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). Very negative ?13C signatures were evident on two 

species that host chemosynthetic symbionts. Individuals of Siboglinum sp. 1, had the 

most depleted carbon isotope signature (-51.1 ± 8.3 ‰), indicating incorporation of 

methane-derived carbon (Dando et al. 2008). However, the broad carbon and nitrogen 

isotope range for this species (?13C = -44.7‰ to -60.4‰ and ?15N= -6.5‰ to -7.4‰) 

indicates broad individual variability on carbon uptake and suggests either 

methanotrophic or sulfide-oxidizing symbionts (Fig. 4.6). Specimens of Thyasirid sp. 

4 had carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures that suggested incorporation of 

chemosynthetic carbon from sulfide-oxidizing symbionts (Dando &amp;amp; Spiro 1993). Four 

species exhibited nitrogen isotope values that suggest heterotrophic nutrition (Fig. 



 

 

126 

4.6). Those were the polychaete Sphaerosyllis and the crustacean Tanaid sp. 1, which 

had carbon isotopic signatures indicative of nutrition on chemosynthetic-derived 

organic matter. The other two heterotrophs were the paranoid polychaete Levinsenia 

oculata and the dorvilleid Meiodorvillea, which likely fed both on photosynthetic 

organic mater and sulfur bacteria (Fig. 4.6).

4.4. Discussion 

The seep of San Clemente is a methane seep characterized by extensive 

deposits of barium sulfate, which are often observed as large blocks on the seafloor 

and can serve as anchors for large tubeworm thickets (Torres et al. 2002). Tubeworm 



 

 

127 

thickets and vesicomyid clams were commonly observed within dark colored 

sediments, which were heterogeneously distributed at the seepage area. Sediments 

covered by bacterial mats were not visually detected at San Clemente suggesting that 

contrary to several seeps in the Californian slope, this habitat is not prominent at our 

study site. The presence of vesicomyid calms and vestimentiferan tubeworms at San 

Clemente is compatible with megafaunal biogeographic patterns along seeps in the 

East and West Pacific continental margins (Barry et al. 1996, Sibuet &amp;amp; Olu 1998). 

Another prominent group of organisms present at the San Clemente seep were 

pogonophoran polychaetes (Frenulata: Siboglinidae), which formed conspicuous mats 

heterogeneity distributed in sediments within 10 meters from tubeworm thickets. 

Siboglinids (a.k.a pogonophorans) often colonize sediments with lower sulfide or 

methane levels, contrary to their related vestimentiferans (Southward et al. 2005). At 

seep areas where siboglinids fields are prominent, they reach high abundances in 

reducing sediments with dissolved methane or sulfide, allowing them to nurture their 

bacterial symbionts and yet provide access to oxygenated waters through their 

anterior end (Schulze &amp;amp; Halanych 2003, Southward et al. 2005, Dando et al. 2008, 

Sommer et al. 2009). At the San Clemente seep, their higher abundance at sediments 

nearby tubeworm thickets suggests a heterogeneous spatial distribution on the flux of 

reduced chemicals, apparently centered at the tubeworm tickets.  

The polychaete Siboglinum was extremely abundant in some areas within the 

seep and their characteristic chitinous tubes potentially modified the sedimentary 

structure and influenced the macrofaunal composition within their habitat (Bergquist 

et al. 2003, Dando et al. 2008). We could not taxonomically distinguish more than 

one Siboglinum species at San Clemente, but siboglinids are commonly found in 

multiple species associations and is an extremely diverse group (Southward et al. 



 

 

128 

2005, Hilário &amp;amp; Cunha 2008). Considering their fundamental role as macrofaunal 

organisms at sediments within 0 to 1 meter of tubeworm thickets, these areas will be 

further denominated as the “siboglinid habitat”. 

Density differences between the siboglinid habitat and background sediments 

were significant in the San Clemente seep and is consistent with increased local 

energy input within a food poor deep-sea background (Levin 2005). The higher 

energetic availability influenced the macrofaunal abundance up to 10 meters from 

tubeworm clumps, although the number of organisms gradually decreased along the 

sampled transects. The observed differences on macrofaunal abundance also suggests 

stronger reliance on chemosynthetic food sources (Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002), and is 

consistent with the dominance of chemosynthetic organisms within the siboglinid 

habitat. The siboglinid habitat exhibited macrofaunal densities (6821 ind.m-2) 

comparable to pogonophoran fields at deeper seeps in the Gulf of Alaska (~ 4000m; 

6625 to 9739 ind. m-2), but lower densities than similar habitats at shelf to slope 

depths in the North Sea and Gulf of Cadiz (Dando et al. 1994, Levin 2005, Levin &amp;amp; 

Mendoza 2007, Sommer et al. 2009). Depth-related effects of food limitation on 

macrofaunal abundance are masked at seep sites where the input of chemosynthetic 

carbon can provide the fauna with additional energy sources (Levin 2005). At our 

study site we observed the local effects of an increased supply of chemosynthetic 

carbon to the fauna. The higher macrofaunal densities at abyssal seeps in the Gulf of 

Alaska if compared to San Clemente are probably related to increased organic input 

(chemosynthetic and photosynthetic) in Alaska, producing the differences on faunal 

abundance between these areas (Smith &amp;amp; Demopoulos 2003, Rathburn et al. 2009).  

Supporting our hypothesis, the macroinfauna composition at San Clemente 

was markedly distinct between the siboglinid habitat and background sediments. 



 

 

129 

Multidimensional analysis evidenced the strong spatial heterogeneity in the San 

Clemente seep sediments, but with a visible separation on macrofauna composition 

between the siboglinid habitat and background sediments. Species composition within 

the siboglinid habitat was dominated by Siboglinum sp. 1. Siboglinids are abundant at 

seeps in Pacific and in the Atlantic, notably at the Gulf of Alaska, New Zealand, at 

mud volcanos and organically enriched sediments in the deep NE Atlantic (Levin &amp;amp; 

Mendoza 2007, Dando et al. 2008, Hilário &amp;amp; Cunha 2008, Baco et al. 2009). Syllid 

polychaetes, peracarid crustaceans and thyasirid bivalves were also very abundant at 

the siboglinid habitat in San Clemente. Thyasirid bivalves have wide trophic 

strategies, from heterotrophy to chemosynthesis through sulfur-oxidizing symbionts 

(Dando &amp;amp; Spiro 1993, Dando et al. 2008). Tanaids are also a conspicuous group at 

pogonophoran fields in the Gulf of Alaska and at clam bed habitats and background 

sediments on the Californian margin (Levin et al. 2003, Levin &amp;amp; Mendoza 2007). At 

San Clemente, at least four thyasirid species and two tanaids were successfully 

exploiting both siboglinid and background habitats, with different species prevailing 

between those habitats. 

Dorvilleid polychaetes were poorly represented at San Clemente but are often 

a dominant group at methane seeps (Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). 

Dorvilleids are especially abundant in bacterial mat habitats where high sulphidic 

sediments might favor their recruitment and increase food availability through 

bacterial biomass (Levin et al. 2003, Levin 2005, Levin et al. 2006). The absence of 

bacterial mat habitats at our study site explains the lower abundance of dorvilleids and 

indicates lower sulfide availability over the sediment surface at the time of sampling. 

Siboglinids are known to tolerate very low sulfide levels and are able to utilize 

enormous quantities of sulfide or methane before concentrations peak at surface 



 

 

130 

sediments (Schulze &amp;amp; Halanych 2003, Dando et al. 2008, Sommer et al. 2009). The 

high densities attained by Siboglinum at 0 to 1 meter sediments could well result in 

efficient sulfide utilization in San Clemente sediments, and inhibit the growth of 

bacterial carpets and its associated fauna. We need a better geochemical data to fully 

address the sulfide and methane levels within San Clemente sediments and to test if 

there is any biological control in the development of optimal habitats for dorvilleids. 

Stable isotope analysis indicated a strong reliance on chemosynthetic nutrition 

for the dominant species associated with the siboglinid habitat. The siboglinid worms 

derive their nutrition from sulphur-oxidizing symbiotic bacteria living within their 

trophosome, with only one species (Siboglinum poseidoni) so far known to host 

methanotrophic symbionts (Southward et al. 2005). At the San Clemente seep, broad 

isotopic signatures within Siboglinum specimens indicate incorporation of 

chemosynthetic carbon through either methane- or sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and 

suggest association of multiple congeneric species. Similar variability on mean ?13C 

signatures (-36.1‰ to -66.6‰) were encountered in siboglinids from New Zealand 

seeps, where multiple species with varied trophic associations coexist (Thurber et al. 

2009). However, although Siboglinum from San Clemente suggests incorporation of 

methane carbon, further molecular analysis are required to confirm methanotrophy or 

to address if multiple species coexist at this seep site (Dando et al. 2008). Thyasirid 

sp. 4 was another species that relied on sulphur chemosynthetic nutrition from 

symbionts, confirming their typical thiotrophic associations (Dando &amp;amp; Spiro 1993). 

The average ?13C values of the siboglinid habitat macrofauna at San Clemente (-

36.1‰) is heavier than observed at similar habitats in the Gulf of Alaska (-46.4‰) 

where the percentage of methane derived carbon utilized by the fauna averages 44% 

(Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). The ?13C values at the siboglinid habitat in San Clemente 



 

 

131 

indicates strong reliance of chemosynthetic carbon at San Clemente but with 

increased utilization of other food sources if compared to the deeper Alaskan seeps 

(Levin &amp;amp; Michener 2002). However, direct comparisons on the contribution of 

methane-derived carbon and other food sources between our study and other seeps are 

not possible until source-mixing calculations are carried at the San Clemente 

macrofauna. 

 The San Clemente macrofauna seems to host intermediate species richness 

and diversity when compared to other cold seep areas. A total of 73 species were 

sampled at seep and non-seep habitats at San Clemente, with 58 species directly 

associated with the siboglinid habitat. In the Gulf of Mexico, a similar number of 

species colonize seep vestimentiferan communities, indicating these are habitats 

hosting a species rich community (Bergquist et al. 2003). Shallower Californian seeps 

that are characterized by the presence of clam-bed and microbial mat habitats host 

more species than San Clemente (Levin et al. 2003), although this could be a result of 

depth and habitat differences. Macrofauna diversity at San Clemente was lower in 

sediments nearby tubeworm thickets, but peaked at 10 meters due to the presence of 

seep and background species. The similar diversity levels between the siboglinid 

habitat and background areas indicates that the San Clemente seep does not host a 

species-rich community if compared to background sediments. Comparisons among 

seep sites revealed that pogonophoran fields at the Gulf of Alaska have slightly lower 

diversity than at San Clemente [Table 4.4; (Levin &amp;amp; Mendoza 2007)]. The San 

Clemente siboglinid habitat has similar diversity levels to the species rich Acharax 

beds at Hydrate Ridge [Table 4.4; (Sahling et al. 2002)]. The high diversity found at 

the siboglinid habitat is probably related to lower levels of pore water sulfides 

(Sahling et al. 2002). This relationship is clear at habitats dominated by Beggiatoa 



 

 

132 

mats and clam beds, which are typically highly sulphidic and frequently exhibit lower 

diversity and higher faunal endemism [e.g. symbiont bearing organisms; (Tryon &amp;amp; 

Brown 2001, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Levin 2005)]. 

Table 4.4. Comparison of macrofaunal diversity indexes at deep-sea seep sites grouped by 
habitat type with published macrofaunal data. Depth in meters.  

 

The low level of species overlap between the macrofauna from organic falls 

and the San Clemente seep confirmed our second hypothesis. The San Clemente seep 

macrofauna is dominated by chemosynthetic-symbiont species, while organic falls 

seem to host a broad number of enrichment opportunist organisms, sustaining only 

juvenile stages of chemosynthetic organisms. Sediments around whale, wood and 

kelp falls are massively colonized by dorvilleids and cumaceans, which are typical 

enrichment-opportunist respondents to the increased availability of organic sources 

around these islands. Considering levels sulfide availability and habitat persistence, 

whale carcasses sustain chemosynthetic conditions most similar to cold seep and vent 

ecosystems (Treude et al. 2009). The broad number of seep-related taxa encountered 

at whale-falls give support to the evolutionary stepping stone hypothesis (Smith et al. 

1989). However, the San Clemente seep and whale sediment macrofauna did not 

exhibit high levels of similarity at the species level. The shared species between seep, 

wood and whale-falls are typically heterotrophic, and represented by deposit-feeding 

polychaetes such as ampharetids and paranoids. The overlap of the ampharetid 

Amellina cf. abyssalis between wood-falls and the San Clemente seep possibly 



 

 

133 

suggests broad utilization of reducing habitats by this species. Amellina is distributed 

along the Gulf of California, was highly abundant around wood-falls and has been 

encountered at deep-sea pockmarks in the Atlantic (Sumida et al. 2004). The low 

species overlap between seep and non-seep habitats is also influenced by the distinct 

macrofaunal structure at San Clemente seep, which is dominated by the symbiont-

bearing polychaete Siboglinum but is colonized by a few dorvilleids, which are 

abundant at organic falls and other seep sites. 

 In summary, the San Clemente seep macrofauna sustains a high density of 

siboglinid polychaetes in sediments within 1 meter from vestimentiferan tubeworm 

tickets. Within the siboglinid habitat, species richness and diversity were lower than 

background sediments, partly due to high dominance of a seep endemic fauna. The 

San Clemente seep macrofauna sustains comparable diversity levels to similar 

habitats at other seep areas, but is more diverse than highly sulphidic seep habitats 

such as bacterial mats and clam beds. Stable isotope analysis showed a wide 

variability in the organic matter sources for the dominant species in the siboglinid 

habitat, with most macrofaunal groups feeding heterotrophically. Overall, less than 

20% of the species overlapped between the San Clemente seep and wood-, whale- and 

kelp-fall communities at similar ocean depths within the region. This might be 

partially related to wide differences in sediment geochemistry and species 

composition between cold seeps and organic falls.

Chapter 5. Conclusions 

 

The present study focused at patterns of community structure and succession at 

artificially deployed parcels of wood, kelp and a large whale-fall; and investigated the 

sediment macrofauna from San Clemente cold seep. The first general hypothesis, that 

distinct time courses of organic loading on sediments create spatial and temporal 

differences on macrofaunal colonization and succession, was confirmed. The transfer of 

organic detritus to the sediments around kelp and wood falls occurred at distinct time 

scales, creating small to intermediate scale organic disturbances in sediments nearby, and 

attracting dense numbers of organic opportunist and specialized species. The organic 

input and bacterial degradation lead to the development of limited sedimentary reducing 

conditions around kelp and wood parcels, which limits chemoautotrophy to microbes.  

An end member of high quality organic matter, whale-falls create an intense and long-

term organic and sulfide enrichment (&gt;4 years) on sediments nearby. However, the 

opportunistic successional stage at kelp, wood and whale-falls are remarkably similar in 

terms of species and trophic succession, albeit different magnitudes of organic 

disturbance create very distinct temporal scales of succession. 

Our second hypothesis was also confirmed by the limited diversity levels 

observed at sediments around kelp and wood parcels, which were markedly lower at 

times of intense organic enrichment. Although kelp and wood falls attract several 

organic-enrichment species not present on ambient deep-sea communities, and create 

mass effects dynamics for wood-borer specialists, these islands sustain lower levels of 



 

 

144 

diversity if compared to whale-falls and background sediments. The lower diversity 

levels at kelp and wood sediments can be related to two main processes: 1) the enhanced 

dominance of opportunistic species under conditions of organic enrichment, which was 

ecologically similar to patterns of succession following disturbance in shallow water, and 

2) the lower organic quality and scales of microbial degradation at these islands, which is 

unfavorable to sustain high levels of chemosynthesis by a rich and specialized fauna. The 

consequences are that kelp and wood parcels, although attracting a sub set of specialized 

and rare fauna that likely contribute to regional and global levels of deep-sea diversity, 

and create favorable habitats for the stepping stone dispersal of species adapted to use 

these parcels in deep-sea areas, host a reduced number of species if compared to whale-

falls. Time-scales and the intensity of organic availability contributes to the high levels of 

diversity supported by whale carcasses in the deep-sea, which provide macrofauna 

communities with a variety of food sources for organisms adapted to utilize it. 

The whale-fall macrofauna was also dominated by organic opportunist species 

that were not typically observed in background sediments, but sulfophilic species also 

abounded between 4.5 to 6.8 y. The whale carcass studied was at the end of its organic 

enrichment stage, as indicated by the wide availability of free sediment sulfides and an 

absence of broad sedimentary organic enrichment. Therefore, the wide range of organic 

sources available at later stages of succession at the whale carcass, favored the 

colonization of a species-rich macrofauna, supporting our third hypothesis that whale-

falls increase local (and regional) levels of diversity in the deep-sea. The whale-fall 

sediments were ecologically analogous to the epifaunal communities that live attached to 

whale bones, and exhibited one of the highest levels of diversity if compared similar 



 

 

145 

reducing habitats. The complex range of food sources and trophic associations in 

organisms that colonize these islands clearly promotes the high diversity levels 

encountered around whale carcasses. Although similar successional responses to the 

organic enrichment were observed between whale-, kelp- and wood-falls, there was a 

limited number of overlapping species between these habitats, also supporting our third 

hypothesis. The high spatial and temporal variability on species composition at each 

organic island indicates the extreme diversity that deep-sea communities exhibit at small 

spatial scales. The specific responses to habitat dynamics and to varied food sources also 

supports that organic islands have an unique role in maintaining dispersal and habitat 

suitability for many species not present for wide distances on the typical soft sediment 

ecosystems in the deep-sea.  

Our last hypothesis, that the San Clemente seep macrofauna had a limited number 

of specialists was partially confirmed, as indicated by the dominance of seep endemics in 

areas around worm clumps. However, seep sediments did not exhibit higher levels of 

diversity if compared to background sediments, supporting our fourth hypothesis. The 

contrast of community composition between seep and non-seep areas was typical of other 

seep sites. The dominance of a chemosynthetic-symbiont fauna at seep sediments with 

broad utilization of other organic sources was also a common feature of the San Clemente 

and other seeps. The presence of a siboglinid bed at seep sediments and the long distance 

to the other organic islands, reduced levels of species overlap between these habitats. 

The colonization and limited overlap of species between organic falls and seeps 

indicated that organic falls have the potential to sustain chemoautotrophically dependent 

species, and to create habitat heterogeneity at the typically oligotrophic deep seafloor. 



 

 

146 

Therefore, there is a great potential for organic falls to increase ? (regional) and ? 

(global) deep-sea diversity, as the frequency of occurrence of such organic islands across 

deep-sea habitats is likely high. These islands provide food and substrate for generalized 

opportunists and a variety of specialists, which require sulfide-rich habitat islands to 

grow and disperse. As these organic islands virtually occur at any location across wide 

ocean basins, they might favor the dispersal of some species, acting as stepping-stones 

between long-term chemosynthetic habitats such as cold seeps and vents. Thus, 

organically enriched sediments around kelp-, wood- and whale-falls, which have received 

little study, may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of 

species at the deep-sea floor. Future studies addressing these organic islands, and their 

relationship to the biota’s of vents, seeps and whale falls need to consider the sediment 

assemblages residing in the underlying organically enriched sediments.
