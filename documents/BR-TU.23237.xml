RESUMO 

O presente trabalho investiga os principais eventos deposicionais ocorridos na plataforma 

continental adjacente ao Rio Guadiana (norte do Golfo de Cádis, Sudoeste da Península 

Ibérica) durante o final do Pleistocénico e o Holocénico, e sua relação com os mecanismos 

forçadores, nomeadamente as variações climáticas, a subida do nível médio do mar e o 

impacte das ações antrópicas na região. Recorreu-se a uma abordagem integrada de vários 

indicadores em quatro testemunhos verticais de sedimentos (cores) recolhidos na plataforma, 

incluindo dados sedimentológicos (textura sedimentar, componentes da fração areia e 

morfoscopia do quartzo) e micropaleontológicos (foraminíferos bentónicos), integrados numa 

malha temporal construída com base em datações radiocarbono. Destes testemunhos, um 

localizou-se no ambiente da plataforma interna e os restantes no ambiente do corpo lodoso do 

Guadiana, a várias profundidades da plataforma média. A análise e integração dos dados 

permitiram reconhecer a evolução específica dos padrões deposicionais em cada um dos 

ambientes e fazer uma interpretação evolutiva do próprio corpo lodoso, cuja maior resolução 

temporal possibilitou, por sua vez, reconstruir mais detalhadamente a história evolutiva da 

região. Durante a fase mais acelerada da transgressão marinha pós-glaciar que caracterizou o 

final do Pleistocénico e o início do Holocénico, ambos os ambientes revelaram sequências 

com tendência transgressiva. A subida do nível do mar constituiu o principal fator 

condicionante do tipo e quantidade de sedimentos fornecidos à plataforma, bem como das 

espécies de foraminíferos colonizadoras desses sedimentos. Com o nível do mar a aproximar-

se do atual por volta do Holocénico médio, os fatores climáticos revelaram-se preponderantes 

na evolução dos padrões depocicionais e ecológicos. Foram registadas profundas alterações 

durante os últimos cerca de 2,500-1,500 anos, com maiores quantidades de finos a serem 

fornecidos à plataforma e uma mudança clara nas faunas de foraminíferos do corpo lodoso. 

As ocupações Romana e Islâmica do sul da Península Ibérica terão tido grande importância no 

desenvolvimento destas alterações, provocando profundos impactes na paisagem e nas taxas 

de erosão ao longo da Bacia do Guadiana. Desde então, e até próximo da atualidade, o registo 

da plataforma e do corpo lodoso revelaram terem sido os impactos antrópicos aliados às 

oscilações mais recentes do clima, em grande parte modeladas pela Oscilação do Atlântico 

Norte (NAO), os principais agentes modeladores de toda a região em estudo.

ABSTRACT 

The current work investigates the main depositional events that occurred on the continental 

shelf adjacent to the Guadiana River mouth (northern Gulf of Cadis, southwestern Iberian 

Peninsula) during the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, and relates them with main forcing 

mechanisms, namely climate change, mean sea-level rise and the impact of human activities 

in the region. An integrated approach based on several palaeoindicators was conducted in four 

sediment cores collected on the shelf, including sedimentological (sediment grain-size, sand 

fraction composition and morphoscopy of quartz grains) and micropalaeontological (benthic 

foraminifera) data, integrated into a temporal framework obtained from AMS (Accelerated 

Mass Spectometry) radiocarbon (14C) datings. One of these cores was located on the inner 

shelf and the other three on the mid-shelf mud body. Data analysis and integration allowed to 

recognize the specific evolution of the depositional patterns in each one of these shelf 

domains and to interpret the evolution of the mud body. Moreover, the higher resolution of 

the muddy deposits enabled to reconstruct with greater detail the history of the region. 

During the phase of fast sea-level rise that marked the late Pleistocene and the beginning of 

the Holocene, both shelf domains revealed a transgressive trend, with the rise in sea level 

constituting the main controlling factor of the type and amount of sediments that reached the 

shelf, and also of the main benthic foraminiferal species that colonized the middle shelf 

environment. As the mean sea level approached its present-day position around mid-

Holocene, the climatic mechanisms became preponderant in determining the evolution of the 

depositional and ecological patterns across the shelf until ca. 2,500 years ago. Profound 

changes were observed during the last ca. 2,500-1,500 years, with higher amounts of 

sediments, mostly fine-grained, starting to reach the shelf and the onset of a clear 

modification on the benthic foraminifera of the mud body. The Roman and Islamic 

occupation of southern Iberia seemed to have been the main cause behind these changes, as 

they led to intensive land-use activities that enhanced soil erosion along the Guadiana Basin. 

Since then, and until modern times, the depositional record of the shelf and of the mud body, 

in particular, showed that the coupled-action of the anthropogenic impact with the more 

recent climate variations, these largely modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), 

has been the main forcing agent for the environmental changes occurring in the study area.  

Keywords: Guadiana shelf, Pleistocene/Holocene, climate change, sediments, benthic 

foraminiferal, paleoenvironmental reconstruction

RESUMO ALARGADO 

O presente trabalho teve como objetivo aprofundar os principais conhecimentos sobre os 

principais processos e eventos deposicionais ocorridos na plataforma continental adjacente ao 

Rio Guadiana (localizada no norte do Golfo de Cádis, Sudoeste da Península Ibérica) durante 

o período decorrente desde o final do Pleistocénico até à atualidade, e sua relação com os 

principais mecanismos forçadores, nomeadamente as variações climáticas, a subida do nível 

médio do mar e os impactes antrópicos na região. O Rio Guadiana drena uma vasta região 

com características semi-áridas, sendo o principal fornecedor de sedimentos e nutrientes à 

plataforma, sobretudo através de eventos de cheias. O regime fluvial deste rio, incluindo a 

generalidade da sua bacia hidrográfica, é altamente suscetível a alterações do clima. De igual 

forma, o intenso desenvolvimento humano que vem marcando toda a região da Bacia do 

Guadiana desde há milénios e, particularmente, após a Ocupação Romana da Península 

Ibérica, julga-se ter contribuído decisivamente para importantes alterações nos padrões 

erosivos dos solos, com consequências expectáveis ao nível do tipo e volume de sedimentos 

exportados pelo rio para o litoral e plataforma continental adjacente. 

Tendo em vista o objetivo proposto, recorreu-se a uma abordagem integrada de indicadores 

presentes em quatro testemunhos verticais de sedimentos recolhidos na plataforma 

continental, incluindo dados sedimentológicos (textura sedimentar, composição da fração 

arenosa e morfoscopia dos grãos de quartzo) e micropaleontológicos (foraminíferos 

bentónicos), integrados numa malha temporal construída com base em datações radiocarbono. 

Destes testemunhos, um localizou-se no ambiente da plataforma interna, a cerca de 12 metros 

de profundidade e localizado a oeste da desembocadura do Rio Guadiana, e os outros três no 

corpo lodoso da plataforma adjacente à foz do Guadiana, na plataforma média, entre os 40 e 

os 90 metros de profundidade. A análise e integração de todos os dados permitiu, por um 

lado, reconhecer a evolução específica dos padrões deposicionais em cada um dos ambientes 

de plataforma e sua relação direta com as modificações nas descargas do rio e, por outro, 

fazer uma interpretação evolutiva do próprio corpo lodoso. A maior resolução temporal dos 

depósitos deste corpo sedimentar possibilitou, por sua vez, reconstruir mais detalhadamente 

os sucessivos paleoambientes e, por conseguinte, a história evolutiva da região. 

Os padrões deposicionais ao longo da plataforma revelaram que ambos os ambientes foram 

sempre fortemente condicionados pelas variações no contributo sedimentar do Rio Guadiana 

e pela evolução geomorfológica do seu sistema estuarino, sendo que na área da plataforma 

interna foi também detetada uma forte influência dos processos de fornecimento e 



viii 
	
  

redistribuição associados à deriva litoral. No caso específico do corpo lodoso, o registo 

sedimentar permitiu detetar esta tendência previamente ao Holocénico, isto é, desde o final do 

Pleistocénico e, em concreto, desde cerca dos 15,000 anos (cal. B.P.). 

Durante o final do Pleistocénico e início do Holocénico, o impacto da rápida subida do 

nível médio do mar que marcou o período pós-glaciar sobrepôs-se claramente aos outros 

mecanismos forçadores, induzindo uma sucessão específica de paleoambientes à medida que 

ia submergindo extensas áreas da plataforma, com o local analisado da plataforma interna 

correspondendo então a um ambiente deltaico diretamente ligado à desembocadura do rio, 

enquanto os locais mais distais da atual plataforma média estariam situados num ambiente 

pouco profundo de plataforma interna. Esta sucessão ficou claramente registada nas 

sequências, quer da plataforma interna, quer do corpo lodoso, através da tendência 

transgressiva dos depósitos, bem como da diminuição gradual de componentes específicos da 

areia (outros terrígenos sem ser quartzo – OT, e fragmentos litoclásticos associados aos 

afloramentos rochosos da Bacia do Guadiana) e de grãos de quartzo pouco evoluídos (NU) 

que servem como indiciadores de maior proximidade à desembocadura do rio. O próprio 

processo de preenchimento sedimentar do estuário, intimamente ligado à transgressão 

marinha, reteve uma parte considerável do material transportado pelo rio. A partir de cerca 

dos 8,200-7,700 anos, a maior parte dos sedimentos mais grosseiros foi retido dentro do 

estuário e apenas os sedimentos em suspensão continuaram a ser transferidos para a costa e 

plataforma adjacente. De igual forma, as faunas de foraminíferos bentónicos do corpo lodoso 

foram ainda mais reveladoras desta evolução. As densidades faunísticas aumentaram 

significativamente, acompanhando a transição para ambientes mais profundos e estáveis, 

enquanto as espécies tipicamente adaptadas a ambientes costeiros – tais como Asterigerinata 

mamilla, Cribrononion gerthi, Gavelinopsis praegeri e Bulimina elongata – que dominaram 

os depósitos mais antigos, foram posteriormente substituídas de forma gradual por espécies 

com preferência ecológica por ambientes eutróficos menos hidrodinâmicos e substratos mais 

finos – tais como Cassidulina laeviata, Bolivina ordinaria e Brizalina dilatata – típicos das 

áreas mais profundas da plataforma. No entanto, é importante salientar que mesmo durante 

esta fase transgressiva, quantidades significativas de material fino já tinham começado a 

chegar à área onde entretanto se estabeleceu o corpo lodoso do Guadiana, querendo tal dizer 

que o abastecimentos fluvial de finos nunca foi interrompido, inclusive durante os estádios 

iniciais e mais acelerados de preenchimento estuarino. 

Após a relativa estabilização do nível do médio no mar na região por volta dos 5,500 anos 

(cal. B.P.), e o processo de preenchimento sedimentar do estuário do Guadiana praticamente 



ix 
	
  	
  

concluído, as sequências sedimentares revelaram que outros fatores globais e regionais 

tornaram-se determinantes para o controlo do fornecimento de sedimentos e nutrientes à 

plataforma, nomeadamente as oscilações climáticas de escala milenar e centenária que 

caracterizaram o Atlântico Norte durante o Holocénico, e os impactes das ações 

antropogénicas à escala regional. Neste contexto, o facto das taxas médias de sedimentação na 

plataforma não terem aparentemente revelado nenhum incremento significativo até perto dos 

cerca de 2,500-2,000 anos (cal. B.P.), mesmo após o preenchimento do estuário estar 

praticamente concluído, pode ter resultado da combinação de dois fatores principais. Por um 

lado, o clima mais quente e húmido que terá caracterizado o início do Holocénico e que terá 

contribuído para o desenvolvimento de uma extensa cobertura vegetal, terá conferido proteção 

dos solos à erosão e ajudado a retardar o aumento expectável do transporte sedimentar fluvial 

e consequente ampliação das transferências para a plataforma. A tendência de aridificação que 

se terá verificado a partir de cerca dos 5,000-4,000 anos (cal. B.P.) em toda a bacia do 

Mediterrâneo e que também afetou o Vale do Guadiana, embora causando modificações no 

coberto vegetal, terá implicado simultaneamente uma redução importante do caudal fluvial e, 

com isso, redução do transporte sedimentar. Por outro lado, a estabilização do nível do mar 

próximo ao atual possibilitou o início da construção do delta submarino do Guadiana junto à 

sua desembocadura, num sistema onde os processos de fornecimento são tipicamente 

superiores aos de redistribuição devido às condições gerais de baixo hidrodinamismo da 

plataforma do Guadiana, o que terá sido responsável pela retenção continuada de uma parte 

considerável dos sedimentos transportados pelo rio. As faunas de foraminíferos do corpo 

lodoso constituíram o indicador que melhor registou esta tendência evolutiva do sistema 

deposicional, com flutuações nas abundâncias relativas de algumas espécies consideradas 

mais oportunistas – como C. laevigata and B. dilatata - a apontarem para um impacto 

reduzido de descargas excessivas de nutrientes fornecidos pelo rio. 

Há cerca de 2,500-2,000 anos (cal. B.P.), registaram-se profundas alterações deposicionais 

e ecológicas nos dois ambientes da plataforma, apontando para transformações significativas 

na área-fonte, ou seja, na Bacia hidrográfica do Guadiana. Grandes quantidades de 

sedimentos começaram a chegar a plataforma e, em particular, verificou-se grande incremento 

de material fino. No local da plataforma interna, este aumento de finos traduziu-se por 

eventos deposicionais específicos intercalados nos sedimentos predominantemente arenosos, 

tendo sido interpretados como o registo de períodos marcados pela ocorrência de importantes 

cheias fluviais. No corpo lodoso, a fração fina passou a constituir mais de 90% dos depósitos 

e estendeu-se inclusive a outras zonas mais afastadas da linha direta de fornecimento do 



x 
	
  

Guadiana, o que claramente marcou o desenvolvimento definitivo deste corpo sedimentar na 

plataforma média. A causa principal do desencadeamento de tais mudanças estará ligada às 

Ocupações Romana e Islâmica da Península Ibérica, as quais envolveram grandes 

modificações nos padrões de uso do solo, em particular de toda a região sul da Península, 

onde extensas áreas foram convertidas ao cultivo intensivo, para além da intensificação da 

exploração mineira e da própria exploração dos recursos florestais para diversos fins 

comerciais. Todas estas atividades, embora tenham contribuído largamente para o 

desenvolvimento da região, envolveram a destruição significativa da cobertura vegetal, tendo 

desencadeado fenómenos erosivos sem precedentes que estarão na origem das mudanças 

ambientais registadas na plataforma, e no corpo lodoso em particular, ao serem responsáveis 

pelo aumento significativo da carga sedimentar transportada pelo rio. Por outro lado, este 

período poderá ter correspondido a uma fase particularmente húmida dentro do quadro geral 

de aridez que caracterizou a Península Ibérica nos últimos cerca de 5,000 anos, designado por 

alguns autores como Período Húmido Romano Ibérico. Uma oscilação climática no sentido de 

maiores níveis de precipitação, aliada à intensa erosão desencadeada na Bacia do Guadiana 

pelas atividades humanas já referidas, terá sido determinante na mudança dos padrões 

deposicionais da plataforma. Este impacto foi revelado igualmente pelas faunas de 

foraminíferos bentónicos, nas quais o estabelecimento ou aumento de determinadas espécies – 

tais como Epistominella exigua, Valvulineria bradyana e Bulimina marginata – traduziu de 

forma evidente a criação de novos nichos ecológicos dentro do corpo lodoso como resposta às 

alterações no fornecimento fluvial. Adicionalmente, este incremento nas descargas fluviais 

poderá ter acelerado a evolução geomorfológica natural da desembocadura do Guadiana e 

sido responsável pela colmatação de um antigo distributário oriental do rio, o qual é 

referenciado em fontes históricas de há pelo menos cerca de 2,000 anos. Tal processo terá 

conduzido, por sua vez, ao reforço do distributário ocidental, hoje correspondente ao canal 

principal do rio e que fornece diretamente a área da plataforma onde foram colhidas as 

sequências sedimentares analisadas. 

Após o período húmido Romano, e até há cerca de 300 anos, os indicadores 

paleoambientais apontaram para a persistência do sinal climático de aridez na região da Bacia 

do Guadiana, o que é consistente com a informação disponível para outros locais do sul da 

Europa. A aridificação de toda esta região terá sido muito provavelmente forçada, em grande 

parte, pela ação da Oscilação do Atlântico Norte (NAO), a qual controla os trajetos do sistema 

de tempestades do Atlântico Norte e, por conseguinte, a maior ou menor 

humidade/precipitação disponibilizada à Península Ibérica. Tal justificaria a ausência do 



xi 
	
  	
  

registo de cheias nos depósitos da plataforma interna que foi verificado durante uma grande 

parte deste período. Não obstante, quantidades elevadas de sedimentos finos continuaram a 

ser fornecidas ao corpo lodoso, o que terá sido sintomático da continuação do impacte 

humano na região, pelo menos durante toda a Idade Média. 

Os últimos 300 anos de deposição continuaram a ser fortemente marcados pelo intenso 

fornecimento de sedimentos finos, com um incremento particularmente significativo no local 

estudado da plataforma interna, e pela deposição de material terrígeno no corpo lodoso, 

indiciador do incremento dos impactes das cheias fluviais. Esta tendência foi atribuída a uma 

ligação ainda mais estreita entre os fatores climáticos e os antropogénicos. A ocupação 

humana prolongada da Bacia do Guadiana foi acentuada durante o século XIX, com um novo 

desenvolvimento da atividade mineira ao longo da Faixa Piritosa Ibérica (devido à lenha 

necessária para o processo de ustulação) e das práticas agrícolas, ambas com fortes impactes 

no uso do solo e nas taxas de erosão. Simultaneamente, este período correspondeu à fase mais 

acentuada do evento climático conhecido como ‘Pequena Idade do Gelo’, que afetou toda a 

região do Atlântico Norte e esteve associado com um índice negativo mais persistente da 

Oscilação do Atlântico Norte. Valores negativos persistentes do índice foram já reconhecidos 

como o principal mecanismo responsável por um aumento da humidade e da precipitação em 

toda a região sudoeste da Península Ibérica. A ação conjunta da amplificação dos processos 

erosivos derivados das atividades humanas com o aumento significativo dos caudais do Rio 

Guadiana devido à oscilação do clima, aparenta ter sido o mecanismo responsável pela maior 

exportação de sedimentos do continente para o domínio marinho e pelos padrões 

deposicionais mais recentes detetados na plataforma.

INTRODUCTION

Chapter I. Introduction 

II.1. Motivation and general setting of the study 

Continental shelves have been assuming growing importance in palaeoclimatic and 

palaeoceanographic research studies as they constitute key-transfer areas between continental 

and marine environments (e.g., Nittrouer and Wright, 1994; Kineke et al., 1996; Jouanneau et 

al., 1998; Sommerfield and Nittrouer, 1999; Araújo et al., 2002; Dias et al., 2002; Roussiez et 

al., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2007), their deposits having high potential for registering past 

environmental changes such as sea-level variations, climatic events and the more recent 

anthropogenic impact on natural systems (e.g., Rodero et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001; 

Edwards, 2002; Hanebuth and Stattegger, 2004; Abrantes et al., 2005; Alt-Epping et al., 

2009). In particular, the mud deposits that can form in shelf areas adjacent to relevant 

sediment fluvial sources have become increasingly important to the understanding of 

Holocene environmental shifts. Their moderate to high sedimentation rates usually generate a 

more continuous record than other areas of the shelf and thus allow an interpretation of events 

with a millennial, centennial, and sometimes even decadal, time-scale resolution (e.g., 

Lesueur et al., 1996; Sommerfield and Wheatcraft, 2007; Burdloff et al., 2008; Lantzsch et 

al., 2009a; Nizou et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2012b; Oberle et al., 2014). 

On the northern Gulf of Cadiz Margin, a number of studies have been conducted 

throughout the past years in order to try to understand the shelf main depositional patterns, 

and their past evolution in relation to several forcing mechanisms, including the postglacial 

sea-level rise, estuarine infilling, oceanographic shifts, changes in fluvial-sediment supply and 

climate (e.g., López-Galindo et al., 1999; Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; 

Rodero et al., 1999; Sierro et al., 1999; Gutiérrez-Mas et al., 2003; González et al., 2004; 

Lobo et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2005; Mendes et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2011). Additionally, the 

Holocene infilling of the Guadiana Estuary is well documented (Boski et al., 2002; Boski et 

al., 2008), which is crucial to understand past changes in the fluvial input onto the nearby 

shelf as the river is its main regional sediment source. The river runoff is itself extremely 

susceptible to variations in precipitation and to climatic oscillations such as those related with 

the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004), whereas the 

narrow and bedrock-controlled morphology of the estuary determines a very efficient fluvial-

export towards the coast (e.g., Lobo et al., 2003), with flood events being the main sediment-

transfer mechanism from the continent to the shelf (Portela, 2004; González et al., 2007). The 

majority of sediments that bypass the estuary mouth to the shelf correspond to suspended-load 

(Morales, 1997; Portela, 2004). This material tends to be re-suspended from the shallower

Chapter I. Introduction 

areas close to the river mouth and of the inner shelf by storm- and wave-activity, being 

transported offshore and eventually setting on the deeper middle shelf environment, where the 

lower hydrodynamic levels allow its deposition (González et al., 2007). Here they have 

formed an important mud patch, which is part of the larger muddy deposits that cover a 

significant portion of the northern Gulf of Cadiz Margin, and constitute a highstand system 

track largely formed after the sea-level rise deceleration in mid-Holocene times (Nelson et al., 

1999; Lobo et al., 2004; González et al., 2004). 

The Guadiana mud body has been part of the focus of a few investigations, mainly 

concerning its geochemical signature and relation to historical human-derived sources of 

pollutants along the river basin (Corredeira et al., 2008), changes in the supply of organic 

carbon during the Holocene (Burdloff et al., 2008), the coupling of natural and anthropogenic 

impacts in the overall shelf system (Mendes et al., 2012b), and a first insight on the general 

mechanisms behind its formation on the middle shelf (Rosa et al., 2011). However, an 

integrated study focusing specifically on the depositional mechanisms that led to its 

establishment and development on the middle shelf was yet lacking. 

On the other hand, the recognition of the Iberian Peninsula as a region of strong climatic 

asymmetries due to its geographical position that places it under the combined influence of 

the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (e.g., Castro-Díez et al., 2002; Goodess and Jones, 2002; 

Martin-Vide and Lopez-Bustins, 2006), sets the Guadiana region itself as a key-location to try 

to understand the climatic complexity of the Holocene period in the context of the North 

Atlantic climate variability. Furthermore, the long-term human occupation of the Guadiana 

Basin has caused a profound and continued impact on the landscape (e.g., Devy-Vareta, 1985; 

Chester and James, 1999; Boone and Worman, 2007), changing erosional processes and thus 

contributing to variations on the shelf sediment supply and amount of nutrients transported by 

the river to the ocean. As such, it is expectable that a strong interplay between natural and 

human forcing factors has helped to definitely shape the region throughout the past millennia. 

Taking into account this overall scenario, and the high-potential of the Guadiana mud body 

to register in detail the past climatic and environmental anthropogenic changes that affected 

the region for the last millennia, urged an integrated approach that allowed understanding the 

formation and evolution of the mud body as a specific depositional and ecological shelf 

domain, and at the same time enabled its use as a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental tool to 

reconstruct the Holocene climatic and anthropogenic history of this semi-arid region within 

the North Atlantic.

Chapter I. Introduction 

II.2. Main goals 

Hence considering the potential relevance that the sedimentary dynamics of the continental 

shelf off the Guadiana River assumes to understand the climatic contrasts along the North 

Atlantic, and of the middle shelf mud body as a high-resolution archive of past environmental 

changes, the main goals of the present work were the following: 

1 - To identify the main depositional events occurred in the shelf environment during the 

late Pleistocene and Holocene and correlate them with sea-level changes and climatic 

oscillations that affected the region, based on a detailed sedimentological approach coupled 

with the analysis of the benthic foraminiferal faunas that colonized the middle shelf mud 

body, framed in a chronology obtained by radiocarbon dating (14C); 

2 – To determine variations in the sedimentary supplies of the Guadiana River onto the 

shelf system through the analysis of changes occurred in the apparent sedimentation rates, in 

the main compounds of the sand-sized sediments (coarse-fraction analysis), in the shape and 

surface texture of quartz grains and in the species composition of the benthic foraminifera. 

Link these variations to important climatic events, using the Guadiana-case as an example of 

the impact of fluvial systems on the adjacent coastal and marine environment in semi-arid 

regions of the North Atlantic; 

3 - To relate the evolution of the Guadiana Estuary with modifications detected in the 

depositional patterns of the shelf, by comparing the data obtained in this study for the inner 

shelf and mid-shelf mud body sedimentary sequences with previous information obtained by 

other authors with the analysis of sequences collected inside the estuary; 

4 – To evaluate the impact of Holocene climatic oscillations, particularly at an historical 

time-scale, in the overall sediment supply to the shelf and in the establishment of specific 

ecological niches for the benthic foraminiferal faunas, using the mud body deposits as the 

main tool. To identify the more recent anthropogenic impact on the shelf depositional system, 

and the role played by human-induced changes coupled with the late Holocene climatic 

events, including those related with the specific NAO-index signal, in the evolution of the 

natural systems of the region; 

5 – To reconstruct the evolutional history of the mud body and relate it with the evolution 

of the Guadiana region itself, in the context of the North Atlantic postglacial climatic and 

environmental changes.

STUDY AREA

Chapter II. Study area 

II.1. General location 

The study area is located on the inner- to middle-shelf adjacent to the Guadiana River 

Mouth, with the river and its estuary constituting a natural border between Portugal and Spain 

(Fig. II.1). 

The continental shelf off the Guadiana River is located in the northern part of the Gulf of 

Cadiz, a large basin that is placed in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, along the southwestern 

margin of the Iberian Peninsula, extending from Cape São Vicente (on the west) to the Strait 

of Gibraltar (on the east), the latter setting the connection to the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. II.1).  

 
Figure II.1 – Map of the Gulf of Cadiz region and general location of the study area. 

 

The basin is positioned near the eastern end of the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone, which 

is part of the Eurasia-Africa plate boundary, and since late Miocene when N-S to NNW-SSE 

convergence movements took place between Iberia and Africa, the region has remained 

seismically-active, under convergence (e.g., Torelli et al., 1997; Gràcia et al., 2003; 

Medialdea et al., 2004). 

Due to its geographic position and in terms of ecological setting, the Gulf of Cadiz basin is 

a transitional area that divides the North Atlantic Coastal Province into the European and the 

African sectors, constituting a relatively warm and oligotrophic pelagic system that interrupts 

the seasonal fringe of cold, nutrient-rich, upwelled waters coming from the west part of the 

basin (Garcia-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garcia-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007).

Chapter II. Study area 
 

II.2. Regional climate 

The Iberian Peninsula, together with the whole of the Western Mediterranean Basin, form 

a transitional climatic region where Atlantic and Mediterranean influences meet and imprint 

specific low-frequency variability patterns (e.g., Ribeiro, 1945; Martin-Vide and Lopez-

Bustins, 2006). 

The climate that characterizes the study area is though clearly of Mediterranean influence 

(Ribeiro, 1945; Loureiro and Coutinho, 1995), with the Guadiana River draining a semi-arid 

region and its runoff being characterized by high seasonal and inter-annual variability (Cunha, 

1983; Loureiro et al., 1986; Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004). The mean annual rainfall in 

the Algarve along the hydrological year has been further described as distributed by three 

different periods, namely rainy (October-February), transitional (March-May) and dry (June-

September) (Loureiro and Coutinho, 1995).  

These general climate trends have been found to be further defined by the North Atlantic 

Oscillation (NAO), which is the leading pattern of climate and winter surface variability over 

the North Atlantic (Hurrell, 1995; Visbeck et al., 2001) (Fig. II.2).

The winter (December-March) station-based index of the NAO is frequently calculated on 

basis of the difference of normalized sea-level pressure between Lisbon (Portugal) (although 

Ponta Delgada-Azores and Gibraltar have also been used) and Stykkisholmur/Reykjavik 

(Iceland) since 1864 (e.g., Hurrell and Van Loon, 1997; Hurrell and Deser, 2010). In general 



10 
Chapter II. Study area 

terms, the NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the 

subtropical Atlantic basin, and shifts from one phase to another, producing large changes in 

surface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic (e.g., Hurrell 

and Deser, 2010) (Fig. II.2). Anomalies in precipitation, including dry wintertime conditions 

over southern Europe and the Mediterranean, and wetter-than-normal conditions over 

northern Europe and Scandinavia, have also been linked to the behavior of the NAO (Hurrell 

and Van Loon, 1997) (Fig. II.2). Positive values of the NAO index are typically associated 

with stronger-than-average westerlies over the middle latitudes, more intense weather systems 

over the North Atlantic and wetter/milder weather over western Europe, whereas negative 

index values usually associate with stronger westerlies and enhanced moisture over low-

latitudes and the Mediterranean (e.g., Hurrell and Deser, 2010) (Fig. II.2). 

In the Iberian Peninsula, the winter precipitation and moisture availability are indeed 

largely modulated by the NAO index (Corte-Real et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Puebla et al., 1998; 

Goodess and Jones, 2002; Trigo et al., 2004; Martin-Vide and Lopez-Bustins, 2006). 

Specifically, in the Guadiana River Basin, pervasive NAO negative-phases are known for 

inducing higher precipitation and stronger river flows whereas the opposite occurs during 

pervasive NAO positive-phases (Dias et al., 2004; Trigo et al., 2004). 

 

II.3. Continental shelf off the Guadiana River 

II.3.1. Physiography 

The Guadiana shelf stands in a transitional zone between the narrow and relatively steep 

West Portuguese shelf, with a mean width of 5 km and a slope of ca. 0.5º, and the north-

eastern corner of the Gulf of Cadiz where the shelf is more than 30 km wide off the 

Guadalquivir River mouth and has gentle slopes of less than 0.2º (e.g., Lobo et al., 2001). 

The study area can be divided into three main morphological provinces, namely the inner 

shelf, the smooth middle shelf and the outer shelf (Nelson et al., 1999). 

Off the Guadiana River, the shelf break lies at around 140–150 m water depth (Baldy, 

1977; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981) and the mean slope is 0.32º (Roque, 1998; Lobo et al., 

2001). The middle shelf is located between ca. 30-50 and 90-100 m water depths with slopes 

of 0.35º to 0.49º (e.g., Nelson et al., 1999; González et al., 2004).

II.3.2. Oceanographic setting 

II.3.2.1. Hydrodynamics 

The surface circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz is integrated into the general circulation of the 

Northeast Atlantic, having the Azores current, which feeds the Canary Current, frequently 

forming meanders that separate from the main flow (Alves et al., 2002). The circulation 

within the Gulf of Cadiz thus constitutes the last meander of the Azores current, part of which 

enters the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar to balance evaporation and 

buoyancy losses within this sea (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). 

In general terms, the surface circulation is anticyclonic with short, meteorologically-

induced, variations, and the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) occupies the water masses 

of the upper 1,000 m of the water column (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). Two surface 

coastal variations of the NACW have been furthermore identified, the Atlantic Water (SAW) 

and the Warm Shelf Waters (SW), the first being originated in shallow waters that are 

modified by air-sea interactions, and the latter being detected mainly over the continental 

shelf and characterized by the influence of continental processes, including heating and 

freshwater inputs from land (Criado-Aldeanueva et al., 2006). 

The anticyclonic gyre is permanent in the open sea but interrupted on the continental shelf 

during the spring-summer season, when a more complex circulation pattern is established, 

with two different cells of cyclonic circulation forming both to the east and to the west of 

Cape Santa Maria (García-Lafuente et al., 2006; García-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007) (Fig. II.3). 

In the western sector the cell is linked to open-sea and upwelling processes, whereas in the 

eastern sector coastal processes dominate (García-Lafuente et al., 2006; García-Lafuente and 

Ruiz, 2007). As a consequence, on the Guadiana shelf, the south-eastward Atlantic inflow 

currents that control the dislocation of water masses over the continental margin are opposed 

by a counter-current flowing westwards along the inner shelf and close to the coast (Folkard 

et al., 1997; Relvas and Barton, 2002; García-Lafuente et al., 2006) (Fig. II.3). On the 

western sector, oceanographic conditions are strongly influenced by the almost permanent 

upwelling phenomena occurring off Cape São Vicente, triggered by the wind-stress curl 

(Fiúza, 1983; Vargas et al., 2003). Westerly winds are the main driven-mechanism for this 

upwelling and can occasionally create a second upwelling core off Cape Santa Maria, which 

weakens and even disappears when wind-stress shifts to easterlies (e.g., Vargas et al., 2003). 

These upwelling events may also be responsible for further primary production by vertical 

advection of nitrogen, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than production 



12 
Chapter II. Study area 

maintained by vertical diffusion (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006). On the eastern sector, easterly 

winds favour the seasonal appearance of the previously mentioned warm costal counter 

current, which may in some cases, when wind-stress is strong enough, extend and invade the 

western sector, connecting both sectors and often turning poleward around Cape São Vicente 

(e.g., Relvas and Barton, 2002; Garcia-Lafuente et al., 2006; Garcia-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007; 

Relvas et al., 2007).

Front, N2 as a branch of the Portuguese-Canary eastern boundary current, CVE as the cyclonic eddy off Cape São Vicente, 
and CCC as the coastal counter current active to the east of Cape Santa Maria (adapted from García-Lafuente et al., 2006). 
 

Concerning the hydrodynamic regime, the study area is characterized by semi-diurnal tides 

with average ranges of 1.3 m and 2.8 m for neap and spring tides, respectively, although 

maximum ranges of 3.5 m can be reached during the latter. Wave climate is moderate to high 

(Ciavola et al., 1997), with an average offshore significant wave height of 0.92 m (Costa et 

al., 2001). Incident waves from the W-SW are dominant, representing 71% of occurrences 

(Costa et al., 2001) and generating an eastward directed longshore transport. ‘Levante’ 

conditions (short period waves generated by SE Mediterranean wind) represent 23% of the 

total occurrences (Costa et al., 2001). Storm events in the area have been defined as events 

with offshore significant wave heights greater than 3 m (Pessanha and Pires, 1981). The 

establishment of return periods for the main incident wave directions indicates that SW 

storms are more energetic than SE storms for the same return period (Pires, 1998). However, 

the cuspate shape of the Portuguese coast generates different areas in terms of exposure to 

wave action, with the eastern section that extends beyond the Guadiana River Mouth being 

relatively protected from the more energetic W-SW waves, and more exposed to ‘Levante’ 

waves.

II.3.2.2. Primary production 

The highest concentrations of chlorophyll along the Gulf Cadiz region are observed in the 

coastal zone between the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir river mouths, mainly driven by the 

nutrient-enriched fluvial discharges (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006). Additionally, local wind forces 

also play a role in biological production, with westerlies enhancing chlorophyll concentration 

and easterlies decreasing it (Ruiz and Navarro, 2006; Prieto et al., 2009). In the coastal and 

shelf areas adjacent to the Guadiana River, the impact of suspended-particulate matter (SPM) 

and nutrients was observed particularly around the mouth of the estuary, involving the 

development of a fingerprint plume that represents a net export of SPM and nutrients to the 

coastal area recorded  both horizontally and vertically (Cravo et al., 2006). The plume has a 

mean width of about 10-15 km and despite being centred slightly east of the mouth of the 

Guadiana River, tended to migrate westward, extending down to ca. 20 m water depth, 

probably influenced by the coastal counter current that flows along the eastern shelf sector, in 

what seems to constitute a recurring event (Cravo et al., 2006). In general, during wintertime, 

when phytoplankton activity is reduced, the plume nutrient concentrations are much higher 

than in the adjacent open sea (Cravo et al., 2006). 

 

II.3.3. Sediment supply and surficial distribution of sediments	
  

The main regional sediment source to the study area is the Guadiana River (González et 

al., 2004; Martins et al., 2012), with sediment supply from the river basin being dominated by 

suspended load relative to bed load material (Morales, 1997). The second most important 

regional source to the shelf is the littoral drift, involving largely bed load transport (González 

et al., 2004). 

Mean river flows of the Guadiana River obtained at Pulo do Lobo Station (covering 91% 

of the drainage basin) for the period 1946/47 to 1999/2000 were of about 142 m3 s-1, with 

distinct seasonal (winter maximum) and inter-annual variations (Portela, 2004). However, 

comparison with data obtained after the construction of several dams and irrigation schemes 

showed that this pattern has been disturbed. For the more recent period between 1980/81 and 

1999/2000, Alves et al. (2001) estimated that the river runoff was since then reduced to ca. 82 

m3 s-1). Also, Dias et al. (2004) concluded that the negative correlation of a negative NAO-

index with flood frequency was r=0.81 for the period 1946-1964, and was then reduced to 

r=0.72 for the subsequent period 1964-1998. The estimated sediment supply from the river 

basin onto the shelf for almost the same period (1946-1990) was of about 43.96x104 m3 yr-1 in 



14 
Chapter II. Study area 

terms of bed-load material and of about 57.90x104 m3 yr-1 for suspended material (Morales, 

1997). However, more recent studies pointed out that for low river flows the net bed-load 

transport was down-estuary at spring tides, yielding an estimate of 5,400 m3 yr-1 of export 

seaward (Garel and Ferreira, 2011). The bulk of bed-load sediment exported by the estuary is 

deposited within the 15 m bathymetric line (González et al., 2007). Winter floods, although 

episodic, play a crucial role in the supply of both coarse- and fine-grained sediments from the 

river to the continental shelf (Morales, 1997; Portela, 2004). In the winter of 2000/2001, field 

measurements showed that ca. 7.5-9.5x105 m3 of sand were exported from the estuary onto 

the inner shelf, and at the same time fines were re-suspended on the inner shelf and re-

deposited at the upper limit of the middle shelf (González et al., 2007). The estuary itself is 

prolonged offshore by a submerged sandy delta (Morales, 1997), where fluvial-supplied 

sediments are mixed with the marine material supplied by longshore drift (González et al., 

2004). 

The longshore transport of mostly sandy sediments is eastward-direct under the influence 

of onshore conditions that produce a net annual littoral drift around 180x103 m3 yr-1, from the 

southern Portuguese coast towards the eastern sector of the Gulf of Cadiz (González et al., 

2001) 

Depositional patterns indicate a predominant eastward transport of sediments under the 

influence of south-eastward Atlantic inflow currents and the littoral drift (e.g., Gutierrez-Mas 

et al., 1994; Nelson et al., 1999; González et al., 2007), although the counter-current flowing 

westward along the inner shelf and close to the coast (Folkard et al., 1997; Relvas and Barton 

2002; García-Lafuente et al., 2006) generates a weaker westward component (González et al., 

2007). 

The surficial sediment distribution on the inner shelf area down to water depths of ca. 25 m 

is mostly dominated by sands (Moita, 1985; Fernandez-Salas et al., 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; 

Magalhães, 2001; González et al., 2004; Martins et al., 2012) (Fig. II.4). This pattern is 

interrupted only by the sandy muds and muds of the prodeltaic wedge just eastward off the 

Guadiana Estuary mouth, and by some patches of sandy muds and muddy sands located 

around the bathymetric of 10-15 m, in front and deviated to the west of the river mouth 

(González et al., 2004; González et al., 2007; Rosa et al., 2013) (Fig. II.4). Most of the inner 

shelf is dominated by terrigenous components, largely quartz, although locally bioclasts can 

form larger accumulations (González et al., 2004). Specifically in the vicinity of the Guadiana 

mouth, fluvial-supplied other terrigenous particles and molluscs concentrate down to ca. 5 m 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

15 
Chapter II. Study area 
 

water depth whereas micas settle around the 10-15 m-bathymetric lines (Rosa et al., 2013). 

The maximum concentrations of quartz are found mainly in the prodeltaic area, to the south of 

the fluvial deltaic bulge and near the coast to the east, whilst other terrigenous accompanied 

by ca. 2-4% of metaschists and greywacke are very abundant on the deltaic bulge (González 

et al., 2004 and 2007). 

 
Figure II.4 – Modern distribution of surficial sediments on the Guadiana Shelf (sediments of type 1 and 4 do not occur on the 
mapped area). Classification of sediments according to Folk (1954). (Adapted from González et al., 2004). 

 

The distribution of morphoscopic quartz shows that the inner shelf areas to the south and 

east of the Guadiana River mouth down to ca. 10 m water depth, including the deltaic bulge,  

contain large quantities of not-worn (NU) grains, followed by smooth-shining (EL) grains that 

increase with water depth (González et al., 2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.5). Small patches of 

rounded-frosted (RM) grains occur only at transition from the inner to the middle shelf, 

around the bathymetric of 30 m, both to the south and to the east of the river mouth, probably 

associated with subaerial exposure on the shelf during lowstand conditions  (González et al., 

2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.5).

morphoscopic types of sandy quartz on the 
Guadiana shelf. NU – not-worn, EL – smooth-

González et al., 2004). 
 

The middle shelf is dominated throughout by the very fine silt and clay deposits that form 

the Guadiana mud belt, extending from ca. 30-40 to 90-100 m water depths (Fernandez-Salas 

et al., 1999; Nelson et al., 1999; Magalhães, 2001; González et al., 2004; González et al., 

2007; Martins et al., 2012) (Fig. II.4). East of the Guadiana River Mouth, these deposits are 

cut by a N-S oriented bulge of transgressive coarser deposits that is composed of muddy 

gravelly sands and muddy sands, and stretches from ca. 20 to 100 m water depth (González et 

al., 2004 and 2007) (Fig. II.4). At the outer shelf sediments are usually an heterogeneous 

mixture of sands and silty clays, but some coarser deposits of sand and gravelly sand also 

occur near the shelf edge (Nelson et al., 1999; González et al., 2004; González et al., 2007) 

(Fig. II.4). Most of the sand on the middle and outer shelf is composed of grains of bioclastic 

origin, where foraminifera dominate but locally on the outer shelf larger amounts of mollusc 

shells remain, particularly in the area of the transgressive bulge (González et al., 2004 and 

2007). Quartz is however the dominant sand compound throughout the mid-shelf area 

occupied by the mud belt, in front and to the east of the Guadiana River mouth, down to ca. 

90 m water depth (González et al., 2004 and 2007). The morphoscopy characteristics of sandy 

quartz show that grains with a blunt-shining (EL) signature predominate on the middle shelf, 

with varying amounts of not-worn (NU) and rounded-frosted (RM) that are higher at 

shallower and deeper areas, respectively (González et al., 2004; González et al., 2007) (Fig. 

II.5). 

In general terms, the surficial distribution of sediments along the Gulf of Cadiz Margin 

indicate that the predominant sand- to mud-facies are in equilibrium with present-day bottom 

currents, except for the outer shelf transgressive sand facies (Nelson et al., 1999).

II.3.4. Postglacial evolution of deposits	
  

The late Quaternary general pattern of sedimentary facies on the Gulf of Cadiz continental 

shelf results from the interaction of several controlling factors that are dominated by the 

Atlantic inflow currents flowing southeastward across the shelf towards the Strait of Gibraltar 

(Nelson et al., 1999). 

The evolution of deposits in the Gulf of Cadiz Margin after the last glacial maximum has 

been controlled mainly by changes in mean sea level, with sediments accumulated on the 

Guadiana shelf featuring related transgressive (TST) and highstand (HST) system tracks (e.g., 

Somoza et al., 1997; Nelson et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001 and 2004). The main consequence 

of relative sea-level variations upon the development of shelf and slope facies was the 

formation of the lowstand prograding slope wedge off major rivers, transgressive sand 

deposits across the shelf and highstand prograding mud layers on the mid-shelf (e.g., 

Gutierrez-Mas et al., 1996; Rodero et al., 1999; Lobo et al., 2001; González et al., 2004). 

These distributional patterns have been further influenced by the full development of 

Atlantic inflow currents over the continental shelf and of Mediterranean outflow currents over 

the slope, during the late Quaternary, when the postglacial transgression resulted in maximum 

water depths over the Gibraltar sill (Nelson et al., 1999). As a result, both the shelf prodeltaic 

deposits and the mid-shelf mud layers have prograted southeastward from the major river 

sources, forced by the inflow current system (Nelson et al., 1999). Throughout the Holocene 

highstand period, sediment dispersal also seems to have been controlled by an intermittent 

counter current system that depends on the wind regime (Lobo et al., 2004), as described 

previously in sub-section II.3.2 (Oceanographic setting). 

The transgressive deposits correspond to four parasequences that are exposed on the 

middle to the outer Guadiana shelf (Lobo et al., 2001), namely in the area of the transgressive 

bulge (González et al., 2004), downlapped by shelf prograding subaequous deltaic and pro-

deltaic facies of the Holocene HST (Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Rodero et al., 1999). 

However, on the middle shelf to the south of the Guadiana Estuary, these transgressive 

deposits are poorly developed and usually covered by the highstand mud deposits (González 

et al., 2004). At the outer shelf edge, underlying the mid-shelf mud and inner shelf sand 

facies, lays this late Pleistocene to Holocene transgressive sand sheet that was formed by the 

eustatic shoreline advance (Nelson et al., 1999). 

The highstand deposits on the Guadiana shelf form a prodeltaic wedge on the inner shelf 

area eastward of the river mouth, and the extensive mud belt that covers most of the middle 



18 
Chapter II. Study area 

shelf (Nelson et al., 1999; González et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2004). The mid-shelf mud layer 

begins inshore at ca. 40-50 m water depth and extends offshore to about 100 m water depth, 

with the thickest part setting offset southeast of the river mouth and being well developed in-

between the Guadiana and Guadalquivir river mouths (Nelson et al., 1999). All the margins of 

the extensive mud deposits are interrupted by non-depositional areas, except for the southeast 

margin (Nelson et al., 1999). 

The development of the shelf depositional patterns throughout the late Pleistocene and 

Holocene has also been strongly influenced by the evolution of the Guadiana Estuary, and its 

infilling process. Similar to the evolution of several other estuarine systems along the Gulf of 

Cadiz Margin, both in the Spanish (Dabrio et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; Zazo et al., 2008) 

and in the Portuguese (Boski et al., 2008; Zazo et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2010) coast 

sectors, the Guadiana Estuary infilling was closely related to the postglacial sea-level changes 

(Boski et al., 2002; Lobo et al., 2003). A first phase of accelerated infilling was identified 

between ca. 13,000 and 7,500-7,300 cal. years B.P. (Boski et al., 2002 and 2008), which 

trapped mostly clay sediments inside the estuary until ca. 8,200-7,800 cal. years B.P. (Boski 

et al., 2002). After this date, the central part of the estuary started to accumulate coarser 

material that was being partly introduced by the continental shelf (Boski et al., 2002). The 

second phase of infilling developed at a much slower rate between ca. 7,500-7,300 and 5,700 

cal. years B.P. and since then predominantly sandy sedimentation was initiated inside the 

estuary (Boski et al., 2002). Since the sea level has been nearly stabilized in the region, after 

ca. 5,500 cal. years B.P., and with the estuarine accommodation space much reduced, 

prograding processes started to develop at the river mouth (Morales, 1997; Morales et al., 

2006). The estuary late Holocene geomorphological evolution included the construction of the 

submerged fluvial delta and the progradation of both the western and eastern margins, which 

started to retain an important part of the sediments being supplied by the river to the coast and 

shelf domains (Morales, 1997). 

 

II.4. Late Quaternary sea-level variation 

During the Quaternary, the main control on sea-level change was the exchange of mass 

between ice sheets and oceans, with ice sheet growth contributing to induce sea-level 

lowstands (e.g., Lambeck and Chappell, 2001). In the course of the Last Glacial Maximum 

(LGM) the eustatic sea level was around 125 +/- 5 m lower than the present day mean level 

and there is evidence for a non-uniform rise from the LGM to the end of the deglaciation. 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

19 
Chapter II. Study area 
 

Using worldwide sea-level data from several sites, improved constraints on the global rate of 

rise have been attempted (Fleming et al., 1998), pointing to an initial slow rise that lasted 

from ca. 21 to 17 ka cal. B.P. with an average rate of ca. 6 m ka-1, followed by an increased 

average rate of ca. 10 m ka-1 for the next 10,000 years until most of the decay of the large ice 

sheets was completed by 7 ka cal. B.P. 

Furthermore, it has been recognized that sea-level changes caused by glacial cycles have 

both a global and a regional character (e.g., Fleming et al., 1998; Leorri et al., 2012), with the 

associated meltwater discharges playing a significant role on rapid climatic change in western 

Europe (e.g., Fairbanks, 1989). It has been indeed demonstrated that the climate of the last 

glacial period was extremely unstable, with such variability that ranged from full glacial to 

nearly interglacial conditions, being first observed in the d18O record of Greenland ice cores 

(Dansgaard et al., 1993; Grootes et al., 1993). These cycles were named as Dansgaard–

Oeschger (D–O) Stadials and Interstadials, corresponding to cold and warm periods, 

respectively (Bond et al., 1993) (Fig. II.6). Some of the D–O Stadials were further related to 

episodes of massive iceberg discharges into the North Atlantic Ocean (Bond et al., 1993), 

named Heinrich events (HE) and which have occurred six times along the last glacial period 

(60,000–15,000 calendar years B.P.) (Fig. II.6). Since then, during late Pleistocene, the 

Northern Hemisphere was marked by a succession of major deglacial climatic events that 

preceded the Holocene period, namely the Oldest Dryas (ca. 18,000-14,700 cal. years B.P.; 

the Bølling/Allerød warm period (ca. 14,600 to 12,900 cal. years B.P.) and the Younger Dryas 

cold event (ca. 12,900 to 11,700 cal. years B.P.) (e.g., Alley and Clark, 1999) (Fig. II.6). 

Worldwide studies focusing on global and regional mean sea-level trends after the LGM, 

are also quite consensual in that the sea level was fast rising by the time of the Oldest Dryas, 

driven by the huge meltwater release from decaying ice masses during the deglaciation (e.g., 

Fleming et al., 1998; Dias et al., 2000; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010; Smith et al., 

2011). Accordingly, the sea-level rise curve established by Dias et al. (2000) (Fig. II.7a) for 

the northern Portuguese Margin placed the mean sea level around 80-75 m below its present-

day position at around 13,000 years B.P. (ca. 15,400 cal. years B.P.). During the 

Bølling/Allerød period and the Younger Dryas, the sea level continued to rise and global sea-

level reconstructions agree in that there was very fast acceleration in the rates of rise around 

14,000 cal. years B.P., due to an important meltwater pulse that released great volumes of 

polar ice into the ocean (Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et 

al., 2010). This pulse, which occurred during the Bølling/Allerød period, is known as MWP 

1A, and although different studies attribute slightly different time-spans for its occurrence, in 



20 
Chapter II. Study area 

general terms they all point to a sea-level rise of about 20 m in less than ca. 500 years 

(Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010).

signalized on the bottom (Bond et al., 1993), YD – Younger Dryas, B-O - Bølling/Allerød, OD – Oldest Dryas (adapted from 
Cacho et al., 2002). 

 

According to the same studies, although with great regional and latitudinal variability, the 

sea-level rise decelerated but in general continued to rise after the MWP 1A, reaching around 

60-55 m below present until ca. 12,000 cal. years B.P. In the curve established by Dias et al. 

(2000), the sea level on the northern Portuguese Margin was reconstructed as being already at 

ca. 45-40 m below present around 12,000 years B.P. (ca. 14,000 cal. years B.P.) (Fig. II.7a). It 

was followed by a phase of sea-level rise deceleration, and in some mid-latitude areas even a 

slight sea-level drop (e.g., Dias et al., 2000), associated with the onset of the colder Younger 

Dryas (YD) that is believed to have slowed down the deglacial melting of the ice sheets 

(Fairbanks, 1989; Fleming et al., 1998; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010). This process 

of deceleration in the rate of rise during the YD has been further detected in the records of the 

SE Gulf of Cadiz margin (Rodero et al., 1999) and of the Guadiana Estuary (Delgado et al., 

2012) (Fig. II.7b). In the transition to the Holocene period there was another noticeable 

acceleration in the global rise of sea level due to a second major meltwater pulse (MWP 1B) 

that affected the ice caps, linked with the transition from the colder YD to the warmer early 

Holocene (e.g., Fleming, 1989; Bard et al., 2010). The sea level is thought to have rapidly 

reached ca. 30 m below present mean level around the beginning of the Holocene in many 

regions (Fleming, 1989; Hanebuth et al., 2000; Bard et al., 2010), and the curves established

for several locations throughout the Iberian Margin (Dias et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; Vis 

et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2012) and for the Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012) are likewise 

in close agreement with such scenario (Fig. II.7). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Figure II.7 – Sea-level curves for the Eastern North Atlantic during the late 
Pleistocene and Holocene periods (MSL – Mean Sea Level). The model curves 
correspond to data from: a) northern Portuguese Margin (Dias et al., 2000); b) 
southern Spanish estuaries (Lario et al., 2002), Algarve beach coast (Teixeira et 
al., 2005), Tagus River valley (Vis et al., 2008), Guadiana Estuary (Delgado et 
al., 2012), and southern Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012). 

 

The sea-level reconstructions for the western European margin point to persistent sea-level 

rise throughout early- to mid-Holocene times (e.g., Hijma and Cohen, 2010), including those 

conducted in different areas along the Iberian Margin (Dias et al., 2000; Lario et al., 2002; 

Teixeira et al., 2005; Moura et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Vis et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 

2012) and in the Bay of Biscay (Leorri et al., 2012) (Fig. II.7). The first phase was 

characterized by a fast rate of rise of ca. 7-8.5 mm yr-1 (700-850 cm/ka) that lasted from the 

beginning of the Holocene until ca. 7,500-7,000 cal. years B.P. It was followed by a 

deceleration in the pace of marine transgression, which progressed at ca. 3 mm yr-1 (300 

cm/ka) until around 5,500 cal. years B.P., when it reached its near stabilization. This is in 

accordance with the data obtained by other authors, who also pointed to the sea level reaching 

close to its present-day position at around 6,000-5,500 cal. years B.P. (Dabrio et al., 2000; 

Dias et al., 2000; Long, 2001; Lario et al., 2002; Moura et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Leorri 

et al., 2012) (Fig. II.7). 

The most recent data concerning the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary indicated that since 

ca. 7,500 cal. years B.P. the sea level has continued to oscillate, slowly rising at a rate of ca. 

0.9-1.8 mm yr-1 (9-18 cm/ka) (Boski et al., 2008; Delgado et al., 2012) (Fig. II.7b).

II.5. Holocene climate control and the recent anthropogenic impact 

It has long been recognized that the Holocene was a time of important climate oscillations, 

and abrupt cyclic-climatic changes have been identified in particular for the North Atlantic 

during this period (e.g., Bond et al., 1997; Wanner et al., 2008). 

Holocene climate variability and instability is to a large extent driven by centennial- and 

millennial-scale fluctuations in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (e.g., Chapman 

and Shackleton, 2000), and seems to have been characterized by diverse climatic responses at 

different latitudes of the North Atlantic region (e.g., Ruddiman and McIntyre, 1981; Mörner, 

1993; deMenocal et al., 2000; Magny et al., 2003). 

Several records from across the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula are consensual in 

that the early- to mid-Holocene was a period characterized by moisture conditions, occurring 

within the context of a generalized warmer and wetter climate designated as the Holocene 

Thermal Maximum (e.g., Wanner et al., 2011; Désprat et al., 2003; Naughton et al., 2007a; 

Fletcher and Sánchez Goñi, 2008; Kaal et al., 2011; Giraudi et al., 2012). Particularly in the 

southern part of Iberia, increased precipitation records and an optimum of forest development 

have been identified by several authors between the beginning of the Holocene and ca. 5,500-

4,500 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Dorado Valiño et al., 2002; Zazo et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 

2011), including in the Guadiana Lower Valley, where the pollen record revealed an 

exceptional expansion of the forest cover until ca. 5,000 cal. years B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007). 

An important dry and cold event seems however to have occurred within this time-interval at 

ca. 8,000 cal. years B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007), which was also detected in other areas of the 

Mediterranean Basin and Iberia (e.g., Cacho et al., 2002; Dorado Valiño et al., 2002; Magny 

et al., 2003; Eynaud et al., 2009; Giraudi et al., 2012) and probably can be correlated with the 

widely known 8.2 ka cal. B.P. cooling event (e.g., Bond et al., 1993; Barber et al., 1999). It 

was much smaller and brief than the previous glacial swings, and sedimentological and 

glaciological research suggest that it was caused by a significant freshwater input into the 

North Atlantic (e.g., Bard, 2002). 

From mid- to late-Holocene onwards, a generalized climate change seems to have been set 

at around 5,500-4,500 cal. years B.P. mainly driven by orbital forcing that caused a shift in 

insolation and the installation of the present atmosphere circulation in the northern 

hemisphere (Jalut et al., 2009), with most studies recognizing the progressive widespread of 

drier conditions (e.g., Fletcher and Sánchez Goñi, 2008; Morellón et al., 2008; Kaal et al., 

2011; Giraudi et al., 2012). Along the Mediterranean Basin, the climate change that began at 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

23 
Chapter II. Study area 
 

this date resulted in changes in the seasonal pattern of precipitation and several arid phases 

were identified as a regional response to global climatic oscillations (Jalut et al., 2000). In the 

western Mediterranean area, including southern Iberia, such trend also forced the 

establishment of an arid, Mediterranean-like, climate (e.g., Dorado Valiño et al., 2002; 

Carrión et al., 2004; Carrión et al., 2007; Zazo et al., 2008; Jalut et al., 2009; Gil-Romera et 

al., 2010). The pollen-based record for the Guadiana Lower Valley further agrees with this 

scenario, with a generally drier climate being detected in the region after ca. 5,000 cal. years 

B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007). However, within this general scenario of enhanced dryness for the 

mid- to late-Holocene period, several decadal- to centennial-scale climate oscillations with a 

more regional extent also seem to have occurred and events of enhanced humidity were 

detected throughout Europe and the Mediterranean (e.g., Carrión et al., 2001; Faust et al., 

2004; Mayewski et al., 2004; González-Álvarez et al., 2005; Bernárdez et al., 2008; Casana, 

2008; Marquer et al., 2008; Alt-Epping et al., 2009; Büngten, 2011). One of the most 

prominent of these events detected in the Iberian Peninsula took place around 2,600-1,600 cal. 

years B.P. as the most humid phase of the last 4,000 years in southern Spain, roughly 

coinciding with the Roman occupation of the Peninsula, thus being denominated as the 

Iberian-Roman Humid Period (Martín-Puertas et al., 2009). 

Furthermore, at a sub-orbital timescale, the influence of North Atlantic climatic variability 

and of its main synoptic mode of atmosphere circulation, the NAO, is widely recognized and 

has been linked by many authors to climate and environmental changes inferred during the 

main climatic events that marked the late Holocene (e.g., Abrantes et al., 2005; Gil et al., 

2006; Wanner et al., 2008; Trouet et al., 2009; Moreno et al., 2012), including the more 

recent Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (e.g., Hughes, 1994; Mann, 1999; Mann 

and Jones, 2003). Instrumental data concerning the winter NAO-index variability only go 

further back until the mid-19th century, but recent studies have been making an effort to 

reconstruct the NAO patterns as far as the 16th-17th centuries (Cook et al., 2002; Luterbacher 

et al., 2002) and even spanning for the last ca. 1,000 years (Bard et al., 2007; Trouet et al., 

2009; Trouet et al., 2012), highlighting its influence over the European climate at 

multidecadal and centennial time-scales. In southern Iberia, coastal records of climatic 

oscillations during the last ca. millennia detected a decadal periodicity that seemed related to 

fluctuations of the NAO index (Zazo et al., 2008), whereas in the specific case of the 

Guadiana Valley climatic oscillations that were detected at a submillennial-scale throughout 

the Holocene have also been associated with variations in the North Atlantic ocean-

atmosphere system and with the NAO index (Fletcher et al., 2007). 



24 
Chapter II. Study area 

Superimposed on the Holocene climate change, the more recent impact of anthropogenic 

development and land-use activities has been widely investigated throughout European 

territories, and a positive correlation seems clear between both forcing mechanisms in the 

shape and transformation of the natural systems (e.g., Berglund, 2003; Büngten, 2011). 

In southern Iberia, the influence of human activity has been detected in some areas as far 

back as ca. 5,500 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Carrión and Dupré, 1997), and studies focusing on the 

mineral extraction of the Iberian Pyrite Belt dated it from around the third millennium B.C. 

(Nocete et al., 2005), which is consistent with that date. In the Guadiana Valley, the first signs 

of human intervention in the vegetation cover (Fletcher et al., 2007) and of mining 

exploitation (Delgado et al., 2012) also date back to around 4,500-4,000 cal. years B.P. Yet, 

the investigations carried out specifically in the Guadiana Basin influence area also seem to 

agree in that more significant transformations occurred later, with the emergence of a semi-

forested cultural landscape and the intensification of mining activities only after ca. 3,300 cal. 

years B.P. (Fletcher et al., 2007; Delgado et al., 2012). This matches quite well with the 

beginning of the Iberian Period (3,200 cal. years B.P.) that was identified in the neighboring 

region of Sierra Baza (southern Spain) as a time of advance in agriculture and irrigation, with 

the widespread cultivation of vines and of fig and almond trees (Carrión et al., 2007). 

However, the first major significant changes to the landscape were brought by the Roman 

Rule of Iberia that followed (ca. 200 years B.C. to 500 years A.D. – ca. 2,200 to 1,450 cal. 

years B.P.), with historical and archaeological sources clearly denouncing an intensification 

of human impact on woodland resources during this period, mainly for agricultural, domestic 

use and mining purposes (e.g., Alarcão, 1987; Alarcão, 1990; Fabião, 1993). The more recent 

pollen and multiproxy investigations carried out in the Guadiana area are in agreement with 

such scenario (Fletcher et al., 2007; Delgado et al., 2012), as are several studies developed in 

other areas of southern Iberia that unravelled the onset of strong human intervention in the 

vegetation cover only after ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. (e.g., Zazo et al., 2008; Gil-Romera et al., 

2010). Moreover, the coupling of Roman development with a contemporaneous climate shift 

towards more humidity has been pointed out as the main mechanism for enhanced impacts on 

the landscape throughout the Mediterranean (Casana, 2008; Zielhofer et al., 2002; Faust et al., 

2004) and in other areas of Iberia (Désprat et al., 2003; Dinis et al., 2006; Mighall et al., 

2006; Carrión et al., 2010b), as the human interventions created the pre-conditions for soil 

erosion but it only occurred when unusually high precipitation levels were originated.  

The Medieval Islamic Rule of Iberia, after the 8th century A.D. (ca. 1,200 cal. years B.P.), 

constituted the second major pulse of human intervention in the study area. It was responsible 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

25 
Chapter II. Study area 
 

for further impacts on the southern regions of Iberia, including along the Guadiana Basin, 

initiating an unprecedent population growth and an extraordinary maximization of the natural 

resources of the region (e.g., Devy-Vareta, 1985; Ribeiro, 1987; Oliveira Marques, 1993; 

Chester and James, 1999, Boone and Worman, 2007), which eventually led to the occurrence 

of even more severe erosional processes (Chester and James, 1999; Boone and Worman, 

2007; Chester, 2012).  

Although the human-induced transformations along the Guadiana Basin that were 

irreversibly put in motion during the Roman and Islamic times, persisted to some extent 

throughout the Middle Ages and beyond (e.g., Ribeiro, 1987; Mattoso, 1995; Chester and 

James, 1999), the human impact in the region only witnessed another significant increase for 

the last ca. 200-150 years. New agricultural developments and, particularly, the reactivation 

and expansion of several important mines along the Iberian Pyrite Belt during the 19th century 

A.D., contributed to the enhancement of the long-term anthropogenic impacts in the region 

(e.g., Serrão, 1986; Corredeira et al., 2008; Chester, 2012; Delgado et al., 2012). As a 

consequence, soil erosion increased along the watersheds and there was an increment in the 

sediment supply from the river basin onto the coast and shelf domains (González et al., 2001; 

Dias et al., 2004; González and Dias, 2006).

III.1. Vibrocores 

III.1.1. Collection 

The four sediment vibrocores chosen to integrate this study were collected on the 

continental shelf off the Guadiana River mouth, situated in the Northern Gulf of Cadiz, near 

the Portuguese-Spanish southern border (Fig. III.1). 

The collection was carried out onboard the vessel Aguayo during campaigns CRIDA0702 

and CRIDA0405, in July 2002 and April 2005, respectively, in the frame of Project CRIDA 

(POCTI/P/MAR/15289/99). The cores were retrieved using a light-weighted vibrocorer with 

water injection, characterized by a core barrel of 4 m length and an inner diameter of 9 cm.

The cores were afterwards transported to the Ciacomar/CIMA (UAlg) facilities, where they 

were opened, described and sampled in the laboratory following standard procedures.

III.1.2. Location and water depth  

Three of the vibrocores set for analysis (namely cores 1, 6 and 14) were placed on the 

middle shelf and within the Guadiana mud body, whilst one vibrocore (core 20) was situated 

on the inner shelf (Fig. III.1; Table III.1). 

Core 1 (376.5 cm length) was collected in the deepest and most offshore area of the central 

mud body, at a water depth of ca. 92 m and positioned at -7º 19’ 58.94’’ W; 36º 59’ 59.93’’ 

N. Core 6 (299 cm length) was retrieved from a shallower area of the central mud body, at a 

water depth of ca. 40 m and positioned at -7º 20’ 45.31’’ W; 37º 3’ 48.28’’ N. Core 14 (241.5 

cm length) was collected in the western part of the mud body, at a water depth of ca. 80 m and 

positioned at -7º 26’ 40.45’’ W; 37º 2’ 39.77’’ N. Finally, core 20 (342 cm length) was taken 

from the inner shelf at a water depth of ca. 12.8 m, and positioned at -7º 26’ 3.55’’ W; 37º 9’ 

9.65’’ N. All this information is summarized in Table III.1.

III.1.3. Sampling 

In the laboratory, the cores were opened and split lengthwise into two halves. One half was 

preserved for archive and frozen, whereas the second half was set for analysis and sampled 

immediately. 

Sampling of the three cores from the mud body followed identical procedures. Core 1 was 

sampled sequentially in intervals of 1 cm-thick slices from the top (0 cm) down to 20 cm, and 

of 2 cm-thick slices from this level to the base of the sequence. Core 6 was sampled at the top 

in a 2 cm-thick slice (0-2 cm), and sequentially from there to level 40 cm in 1 cm-thick slices, 

and in 2 cm-thick slices between that level and the base. Core 14 was sampled sequentially in 

1 cm-thick slices from the top (0 cm) down to 50 cm, and from this level to 239 cm in 2 cm 

slices, with the base level sampled in a 2.5 cm-thick slice (239-241.5 cm). 

Sampling of the inner shelf core was also performed sequentially but with a more irregular 

grid, adjustable to the variations in grain-size and sediment composition along-core. 



30 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

Vibrocore 20 was sampled at the top in a 2 cm-thick slice (0-2 cm), as well as for core-depth 

intervals 3-19 cm, 22-36 cm, 40-94 cm, 97-99 cm, 104-142 cm, 205-222 cm and 316-318 cm. 

Sampling consisted on 1 cm-thick slices for core-depth intervals 2-3 cm and 36-40 cm; on 1.5 

cm-thick slice between 102.5 cm and 104 cm; and on 3 cm-thick slices for core-depth 

intervals 19-22 cm, 94-97 cm, 99-102 cm, 142-205 cm, 222-316 cm, and from level 318 cm 

down to the base of the core (342 cm). 

Each level of cores 1, 6 and 14 was sub-sampled for grain-size, geochemical and benthic 

foraminiferal analyses. In core 20, the same was done for most of the sequence, except in the 

basal section (222-342 cm), where levels were sub-sampled only for grain-size and benthic 

foraminiferal analyses due to the coarser nature of sediments that disabled future geochemical 

analyses. 

 

III.2. Dating 

III.2.1. AMS radiocarbon analyses 

Sample levels selected for dating analysis were first chosen based on the presence of 

significant changes observed along the vibrocores in the dominant type of sediments, which 

had already been identified through the grain-size analyses. Whenever possible, 

complementary datings were further obtained to help validate the previous set and to establish 

a higher resolution for the temporal framework of the sequences. 

A total of 15 radiocarbon analyses were processed for the four vibrocores. Accelerated 

mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (14C) dating was performed at Beta Analytic Inc. 

(U.S.A.), using 20 to 40 mg of mixed benthic foraminiferal tests for levels of the mud body 

vibrocores, and a minimum of 30 mg of mollusc shells for levels of the inner shelf vibrocore. 

Almost all samples corresponded to 2 cm-thick intervals, except for level 132-136 cm of core 

14, in which the low abundance of foraminiferal tests compelled the use of 4 cm, and levels 

151-154 cm and 286-289 cm of core 20 that had been previously sampled for grain-size at 3 

cm-thick slices. 

Samples of the mud body vibrocores were first washed with tap water through a 63-µm 

sieve. The retained sediment was dried in an oven at ca. 50 ºC and then analysed under the 

binocular microscope for collection of the benthic foraminiferal tests, with special attention 

for avoiding re-worked tests that could disturb the dating results. As for the inner shelf 

samples, the mollusc shells were chosen from the coarse fraction (-6 ? to 4 ? / 64 mm to 

0.063 mm) according to their preservation state, in order to avoid remobilized material. They 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

31 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

were furthermore identified, based on specialized bibliography (Fischer et al., 1987; Macedo, 

1999), to assure the individuals matched species with an ecological distribution compatible 

with the inner shelf environment, from where vibrocore 20 was collected. 

The obtained radiocarbon ages were calibrated with programme CALIB 5.1 (Stuiver et al., 

2005), using the MARINE04 curve and the global ocean reservoir correction of ca. 400 years 

(Stuiver and Reimer, 1993). Local reservoir effect (delta R) was furthermore applied 

according to Soares and Martins (2010), specifically a correction of 0±100 years for dates 

older than 2,000 radiocarbon years and of -135±20 years for dates younger than that age. 

Conventional radiocarbon ages will be reported as years ‘before present’ (B.P., ‘present’ = 

1,950 A.D.). Calendar calibrated ages will be reported as years ‘before Christ’ and ‘Anno 

Domini’ (B.C./A.D.) and calibrated ages as years ‘before present’ (B.P.). 

 

III.2.2. Age models and sedimentation rates  

The age models were created for all vibrocores based on 14C calibrated (2 sigma) ages, 

core depth (cm) and sedimentation rates (cm per thousand of years). 

The age-depth model adopted in this study was based on a linear interpolation, which 

assumes a stable sediment accumulation between the dated levels. The calibrated ages (cal. 

years B.P.) were plotted against core depths (cm) and the gradients of the lines connecting 

each adjacent pair of points corresponded to an estimate of the sedimentation rates. In the 

linear interpolation approach, interpolated ages are calculated for intermediate depths between 

each of the adjacent pair of points. The changes that are thus identified in the sedimentation 

rates along-core make the interpolation model the most appropriate fit to our data (Telford et 

al., 2004). Moreover, although linear interpolation remains as a basic approach to derive an 

age-depth model, as it does not account for errors on the calibrated ages nor makes 

corrections for sediment compaction, it has been proven to provide good estimates for both 

ages and gradients, which are usually in agreement with results produced by more complex 

models (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). 

Sedimentation rates (cm/ka cal. B.P.) that were obtained for all the shelf sedimentary 

sequences translate the velocity of sediment build-up (van Andel et al., 1975). Zero validation 

was applied to the age model created for each sediment core.

III.3. Sedimentology 

III.3.1. Grain-size 

Downcore grain-size analyses were carried out sequentially in all four vibrocores using 2 

cm-thick sample slices, or 3–4 cm slices for coarser sediments. Firstly, samples were treated 

with hydrogen peroxide to eliminate organic matter. Coarse (sand and gravel) and fine (silt 

and clay) grained sediments were then separated by wet sieving using a 63-µm sieve. The 

grain-size distribution (at phi scale intervals, ?) of the coarse fractions was determined by dry 

sieving, and of the fine fractions by the pipette method. In addition, the dominant textural 

classes (gravel, sand, silt, and clay; silt and clay corresponding to ‘mud’ as defined by the 

classification of Folk, 1954) were determined in each case. 

 

III.3.2. Determination of sand fraction compounds 

For determination of the sand (–1 ? to 4 ? / 2 mm to 0.063 mm) compounds, a sampling 

grid of regular 10 cm intervals was established along-core in each one of the sedimentary 

sequences. A total of 39 samples were analysed for vibrocore 1, of 31 samples for vibrocore 

6, of 25 samples for vibrocore 14 and of 36 samples for vibrocore 20. 

The terrigenous and biogenic compounds were identified and quantified under a binocular 

microscope by counting 100 grains in each sand phi class (-1 to 0 ?, 0 to 1 ?, 1 to 2 ? , 2 to 3 

? and 3 to 4 ?), giving a total of 500 grains for each sample. Within the terrigenous 

compounds, quartz, mica, charcoal, carbonate lithoclasts, schist/greywackes, sandstones, 

aggregates (poly-mineralic grains) and other terrigenous grains (mono-mineralic grains, such 

as feldspars and heavy minerals) were distinguished. The biogenic compounds were divided 

into molluscs, benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, ostracods and other bioclasts 

(such as fragments of echinoderms and corals). The results were statistically analysed and the 

weighted mean for all compounds was calculated after Sarnthein (1971), corresponding to the 

total sum of grains in each sand ‘phi’ class multiplied by their weight and divided by the total 

weight of the sand fraction. 

The same procedure was adopted for the gravel fraction of vibrocore 20, whenever it was 

found to be statistically representative (?100 grains in each sample) in more than one half of 

the analysed samples.

Chapter III. Materials and methods 

In order to maintain regional consistency, the identification scheme followed the 

classification established by Dias (1987) for the superficial sediments of the northern 

Portuguese continental shelf. 

 

III.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture 

In the same samples that had been analysed for identification of the sand compounds, 100 

quartz grains were additionally selected from each 1–2 ? size fraction for surface texture and 

shape analyses. This investigation was also conducted under the binocular microscope, and 

the results were statistically evaluated with the calculation of the relative abundances for all 

variables that integrated the analysis. 

Grains were classified according to the morphoscopic groups defined in Schneider and 

Cailleux (1959): not worn (‘non-usés’, NU, indicative of weak transport), rounded-frosted 

(‘rond-mats’, RM, indicative of aeolian transport), and smooth-shining (‘emoussés-luisants’, 

EL, indicative of transport in water). A fourth group was proposed for grains evidencing a 

mixed EL/RM signature, suggestive of initial water and subsequent aeolian transport. 

Shape analyses were based on the roundness and sphericity of grains, indicators for erosion 

and transport (Powers 1953). The degree of roundness was classified from very angular (VA), 

angular (A), and subangular (SA) - indicative of weak transport - to subrounded (SR), 

rounded (R), and well rounded (WR), indicative of more vigorous transport. The degree of 

sphericity was classified as either high or low, indicative of both the transport intensity and 

the dominant transport mechanism that could correspond to a multidirectional (e.g., tides, 

waves, wind) or to a unidirectional (e.g., river currents) flow, respectively. 

 

III.4. Benthic foraminifera 

III.4.1. Sample preparation  

The study of benthic foraminifera in the mud body deposits followed a 10 cm interval 

sampling grid for each core, and the core-base samples were considered for analysis. A total 

of 31 samples were analysed in vibrocore 1, of 30 samples in vibrocore 6, and of 25 samples 

in vibrocore 14. 

All selected samples were dried in the oven at ca. 50 ºC and weighted, in order to obtain 

the weight (g) of the total sediment. Dry samples were then washed through the 2,000-µm and 

63-µm sieves under tap water, to separate the gravel and sand sediments, and to remove the 



34 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

fine material, respectively. The sieves went through Methylene Blue dye in-between the wash 

of each sample, to avoid their contamination with previously washed material. Both gravel 

and sand fractions were dried in the oven (ca. 50 ºC) and weighted, to attain the weight (g) of 

the total coarse-fraction of the dry sediment samples. 

 

III.4.2. Counting and identification 

The &gt; 63-µm material was divided into aliquots with the help of an Otto micro-splitter, the 

size of the split for each sample being determined according to the number of expected 

individuals. The goal was to obtain at least 300 foraminiferal tests for identification in each 

sample, the number most widely considered as minimum necessary when a more detailed 

approach on the overall distribution of species is intended for the assemblages. Although for 

dead/fossil assemblages (time-averaged accumulations), the counting of 100 individuals may 

suffice to record all the important species, it often does not allow to distinguish more specific 

features such as which of the main species is dominant (Fatela and Taborda, 2002; Murray, 

2006). 

The study of the benthic foraminiferal microfaunas was carried out under a binocular 

microscope MEIJI Techno EMZ3, with a maximum magnification of up to 140x. In each 

aliquot, all well-preserved benthic foraminiferal tests were picked from a tray, mounted on 

lightly glued cardboard slides, and the individuals counted and identified up to the species, 

whenever possible. The generic classification of benthic foraminifera followed the taxonomy 

proposed by Loeblich and Tappan (1987) for the Genera level, except Textularia, 

Quinqueloculina and Discorbis for which the original species names found in the Ellis and 

Messina Catalogue of Foraminifera (1942-2009) were kept. Species identification was 

furthermore determined on basis of specialized bibliography, namely the Ellis and Messina 

catalogue (1942-2009), Murray (1971), Colom (1974), Boltovskoy et al. (1980), Jones 

(1994), Levy et al. (1995), Debenay et al. (2001), Murray (2003), Martins and Gomes (2004), 

Milker and Schmiedl (2012), among others. 

Relative abundances (%) of all the identified species were calculated in all samples of the 

three cores. Taking into consideration counts of ca. 300 individuals, and although only 

abundances of &amp;lt;1% are found to be close to confidence limits and cease to be significant 

(Buzas, 1990), the abundance variations of occurrences up to 5% are generally not considered 

meaningful (Murray, 2006). Hence, species distribution and assemblages of main benthic 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

35 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

foraminiferal species were established for each sedimentary sequence considering only 

species with more than 5% in at least one sample of the core. 

All the main benthic foraminiferal species, and several other, were documented by means 

of scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs, which were obtained with a JEOL, 

JMS-5200 LV microscope at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. 

 

III.4.3. Population density and diversity measures 

The population density (or faunistical density, FD) was calculated for each sample, 

corresponding to the number of benthic foraminifera per gram of dry sediment (nº/g of dry 

sediment). The number of species, designated by Species Richness (S), was also determined 

for each sample. The population diversity measures of Shannon-Wiener Index (Hs) and 

Evenness (J) were calculated using the PAST (PAlaentological Statistics, ver. 1.81) software 

(Hammer et al., 2008), with species richness (Si) and the total number of individuals (ni) of 

each sample (i) as data entries. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (values ranging from 0 to 

infinite) uses the proportion p of species x (px) and the ln(px), being p=100%. This implies 

that the contribution of each species x to the index value Hs(i) depends on its proportion 

within the sample i, and as a consequence rare species make little contribution. Evenness 

(values ranging from 0 to 1) is used to describe how individuals are distributed amongst 

species in each sample, meaning that the greater the dominance of one species, the lower will 

be the value of J. 

 

III.4.4. Cluster analysis (multivariate statistics) 

Cluster analysis was applied to the assemblages of main foraminiferal species (species with 

&gt; 5% in at least one sample of each core), determined for the mud body sequences. 

Cluster analysis stands as one of the most widely used techniques of multivariate statistics 

in foraminiferal studies, segregating variables (such as samples and species) into naturally 

occurring groups and quantifying the between-group relationships (Sen Gupta, 1999). A 

cluster corresponds to a group of objects of the considered variable that are sufficiently 

similar to be recognized as members of the same group, resulting from the analysis of the 

similarities/dissimilarities among those objects (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). The most 

frequently used clustering methods are both hierarchical and agglomerative, meaning they 

start with all objects in separate groups and proceed iteratively to cluster by merging pairs of 

groups from previous iterations, until all objects are grouped into a single cluster (Sen Gupta, 



36 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

1999). The advantage of hierarchical clustering is that it allows for the local determination of 

group boundaries along a sedimentary sequence, evidencing the relationships among groups, 

whilst agglomerative clustering is also more satisfactory for zonation because the clusters are 

built up locally (Grimm, 1987). 

Cluster analysis of the assemblages defined in each vibrocore was performed with the 

PAST software (ver. 1.81; Hammer et al., 2008) for R-Mode clustering (grouping of 

foraminiferal species) and the TILIA software (ver. 2.0.2; Grimm, 2004) for Q-Mode 

clustering (grouping of samples). 

For R-Mode clustering, analyses were stratigraphically unconstrained, as the grouping of 

species does not intend to join them on basis of their stratigraphic relationships. The PAST 

software allowed the performance of several algorithms and therefore a number of analyses 

were run with the foraminiferal data of the three vibrocores, as it is advisable to discard or 

distrust any results that are fundamentally different from the others (Sen Gupta, 1999). The 

algorithms tested were Ward’s Method, also known as the ‘incremental sum of squares’ 

method, and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages) using as 

measure indices of goodness-to-fit either the ‘Gower Distance’ (dissimilarity measure) or the 

‘Matrix Correlation’ (similarity measure). Ward’s Method operates on a dissimilarity matrix 

of Euclidian distances (0-infinity) and follows a zonation criterion that diminishes the total 

within-zone dispersion, which means the clusters are joined such that the increase in within-

group variance is minimized. In the unconstrained analysis, the method searches for the 

minimum value between objects in the entire dissimilarity matrix at each stage of the 

clustering process (Grimm, 1987). The UPGMA method proceeds by step-wise condensation 

of the cophenetic similarity/dissimilarity matrix. Each step starts by the identification of the 

next pair of objects that has the largest similarity or the smallest dissimilarity, followed by a 

condensation of all the measures of resemblance involving that pair which calculates the 

arithmetic means of the similarities/dissimilarities (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). Clusters are 

therefore joined based on the average distance between all members of two groups. As for the 

UPGMA measure indices that compare the original data matrix with the cophenetic 

similarity/dissimilarity matrix, ‘Matrix Correlation’ is Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient 

r (0-1) computed between the values in the two half-matrices of similarities, whilst the 

‘Gower Distance’ is the sum of the squared differences between the original and the 

cophenetic values (Blaaw and Heegaard, 2012). Although one method is not necessarily better 

than the other, attention should be paid to assure the best choice is made accordingly to the 

specificities of the analysed data. Correlation coefficients, for example, may prove to be 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

37 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

undesirable measures of similarity in high-diversity communities, because they are strongly 

affected by sample size (Krebs, 1989). Several studies based on the comparison of the various 

clustering techniques also seem to suggest that, in many cases, the Ward’s Method may show 

some superiority to UPGMA algorithms (Sen Gupta, 1999). A good approach to quantify the 

success of a specific cluster analysis and compare the results given by different algorithms, is 

the obtainment of the cophenetic correlation value. It compares the between-object similarity 

values in the original matrix with a similar test derived from the clustered results, in which 

values approaching 1 indicate less distortion of the original similarities by the clustering 

process and thus correspond to the most adequate algorithm (Sen Gupta, 1999). After 

applying the three different algorithms of R-Mode clustering to the mud body foraminiferal 

microfaunas, Ward’s Method proved indeed to be the best-fit to the foraminiferal data of the 

vibrocores. Although its cophenetic correlation value was not the highest for any of the cores, 

it proved still to perform quite satisfactory with high mean values, always above 0.86. But 

more importantly, the further comparison of the species assemblages suggested by its 

dendrograms and by those of the UPGMA indices with the natural distribution of the species 

abundances within each core, proved that the Ward’s Method was the algorithm which 

reflected best the natural tendencies evidenced by the mud body microfaunas. 

For Q-Mode clustering analysis, TILIA software uses the program CONISS that performs 

stratigraphically constrained clustering (clusters contain only stratigraphically adjacent 

samples) based on Ward’s Method, which has proven to perform very satisfactorily on 

frequency data of fossil stratigraphic data (Grimm, 1987). For frequency data (e.g., pollen 

data, foraminifera), transformation before calculation of the matrix of squared Euclidian 

distances, is usually advised (Grimm, 1987). This is particularly recommended when a few 

species are excessively common or rare in the samples and these extreme values distort the 

overall picture (Krebs, 1989), as was the case of the mud body foraminiferal assemblages. 

The square-root transformation, which produces the chord distance of Edwards and Cavalli-

Sforza and up-weights rare variables relative to abundant ones, has been the best attested for 

this type of data (Grimm, 1987) and was thus applied to our foraminiferal data. 

The cluster analyses produce results under the form of dendrograms, which illustrate the 

hierarchical relationships of the clusters defined by the analysis. The recognition of 

significant clusters within a dendrogram is largely a subjective process, with clusters being 

graphically designated by simply constructing a ‘phenon’ line that marks a level of 

similarity/dissimilarity at which the clusters are presumed to represent meaningful 

aggregations (Sen Gupta, 1999). A good strategy is to delimit zones using a straight cut across 



38 
Chapter III. Materials and methods 

the dendrogram and then, according with the specific distribution of the clusters for each set 

of data and if it requires so, to divide certain zones further into sub-zones that have 

interpretive value (Hedberg, 1976). In the specific case of the CONISS program (TILIA 

software) that was used, various criteria to define the heights of nodes connecting clusters in 

dendrograms for the ‘incremental sum of squares’ (Ward’s) method, are available. The ‘total 

within-cluster dispersion’ was the criterion chosen for our foraminiferal data, as it usually 

generates zones similar to those the researcher would select by inspection, with just a straight 

cut across the dendrogram, therefore providing the most useful and realistic information 

(Grimm, 1987).

IV.1. Results 

IV.1.1. Lithological description and profile 

The lithological description of the sedimentary sequence was based on the direct 

observation of the sediments, taken place immediately after the vibrocore was opened and 

before sampling. According to this preliminary description, a log profile of the sequence was 

constructed for the present study (Fig. IV.1), in order to help visualize the general aspect of 

the main sedimentological features and fossiliferous content that characterized vibrocore 20. 

 
Figure IV.1 – Log profile of vibrocore 20. Fine sediments (silt and clay) stand as ‘mud’ whenever deposits were a mixture of 
gravel, sand and fines, or separately as ‘silt’ and ‘clay’ when deposits were composed only by sand and fines. ‘Shells’ 
represent mixed and mainly broken bioclastic content, with different symbol sizes attesting for the dimensional variability of 
the bioclasts found within the sediment layers. 

 

From the base of the sequence until close to core level 241 cm, sediments corresponded to 

coarse sands with very abundant small to large bioclastic remains (mostly molluscs), and 

unbroken bivalve shells. Two depositional intervals (289-277 cm and 259-241 cm) within this 

core section were marked by enhanced coarse sedimentation, which was due to the 

particularly high accumulation of big-sized bivalve shells. Aggregates (rock fragments) were

Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

also present in this section of the core, tending to become smaller towards its upper limit, 

together with some mudclasts that appeared between levels 277 cm and 259 cm. 

A sharp boundary separated the base section of the upper one (comprised between levels 

241 cm and 143 cm), indicating an abrupt change in sedimentation that occurred between 

both depositional phases. Deposition continued to be dominated by sands but these became 

medium- to coarse-grained, and with a clear higher contribution of fine material (‘mud’) 

throughout the section. The bioclastic content became more diversified, with still significant 

amounts of bioclastic remains of several dimensions but also more abundant unbroken bivalve 

shells and gastropods. Some mudclasts were detected between core levels 228 and 217 cm. A 

thin layer of ca. 10 cm of much coarser sands was identified at core depth 184-175 cm, 

characterized by a strong increase of the bioclastic content. 

The transition to the upper section (from core depth 143 cm to 44 cm) was again marked 

by a rapid shift in sedimentation. Sediments became increasingly finer, with mainly fine-

grained sands dominating the record and accompanied by an important mud component that 

increased as much as two-fold. The bioclastic content continued to be abundant and almost 

entirely dominated by broken mollusk shells. A very thin and well individualized mud layer 

was identified between levels 116 cm and 112 cm, apparently setting the definitive 

establishment of a fine-dominated deposition at the site of vibrocore 20 on the inner shelf. 

Around core depth 44 cm, a gradational boundary translated a more or less gradual 

variation, with a depositional change towards even finer sediments. Predominantly silt and 

clay that were almost absent of visible bioclastic content, deposited at this site of the inner 

shelf until recent times (top of the sequence). This type of sedimentation was however 

interrupted during a specific event, recorded in the sedimentary sequence (core depth 13-3 

cm) as a layer of coarser deposits. It corresponded to a mixture of sand and silt, with many 

bioclastic remains, some unbroken shells of bivalves and high amounts of organic debris. This 

organic material was only further registered at the core-depth interval 39-26 cm. 

 

IV.1.2. Age model  

The age model for vibrocore 20 was constructed based on four AMS radiocarbon datings, 

obtained at selected depth levels along-core. All information concerning the dated levels, 

sample laboratory codes, radiocarbon and calibrated dating results, is summarized in Table 

IV.1.

The oldest date was obtained at core level 316-318 cm, attributing an age of 9,025-8,458 

cal. years B.P. near the base of the sedimentary sequence (Fig. IV.2). At core level 286-289 

cm, dating results provided an age of ca. 8,416 to 7,972 cal. years B.P. for the sediments, 

corresponding to a coarser deposition (Fig. IV.2). An age of 2,036 and 1,514 cal. years B.P. 

was obtained at level 215-217 cm, where a peak (ca. 20%) of silt and clay deposition occurred 

(Fig. IV.2). Finally, the youngest date obtained for the sequence corresponded to an age 

between 1,259 and 1,048 cal. years B.P. at level 151-154 cm, which sets the beginning of fine 

sedimentation episodes on the inner shelf (Fig. IV.2).

Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

Sedimentation rates on the inner shelf location of vibrocore 20 showed a general increase 

trend along time (Fig. IV.3). In early Holocene, during the period between ca. 9,200 and 

8,400-7,900 cal. years B.P., rates were about 54 cm/ka. For the period that lasted from ca. 

8,400-7,900 cal. years B.P. until ca. 2,000-1,500 cal. years B.P., the rates decreased and 

reached their lowest values on the inner shelf, of around 11 cm/ka. During the late Holocene, 

the velocity of sediment build-up greatly increased. Sedimentation rates reached around 102 

cm/ka during the period from ca. 2,000-1,500 until 1,260-1,050 cal. years B.P., and around 

132 cm/ka from this last date until recent times. 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure IV.3 – Age model and sedimentation rates 
(cm/ka) of vibrocore 20. The error-bars in the control-
points of the age model curve represent the uncertainty 
(2?) of the calibrated dates (ka cal. B.P.). 

 

In what concerns the lowermost ca. 20 cm of the vibrocore (from 318 to 342 cm core-

depth), in which no dating was possible to obtain, the same sedimentation rate that was 

calculated for the oldest dated period of the sequence (between 9,025- 8,458 cal. years B.P. 

and 8,416 to 7,972 cal. years B.P.) was assumed for constructing the core age model. Based 

on these calculations, an age of 9,178 cal. years B.P. was estimated for the base-level (339-

342 cm) of the sequence. 

 

IV.1.3. Sediment characterization 

IV.1.3.1. Grain-size 

The grain-size composition (sedimentary texture) of vibrocore 20 showed that coarser 

sediments (gravel and mostly sand) dominated this inner shelf location until ca. 1,000 cal. 

years B.P., and from this age until present-day deposition became finer with enhanced content 

of silt and clay (Fig. IV.4a). Concomitantly, the mean grain-size of sediments was typical of 

coarse to medium sands until the same date, and afterwards increased to values that 

characterize fine sands and fines (Fig. IV.4b).

Figure IV.4 – a) Sediment grain-size composition (%) 
and b) mean grain-size (phi - ?), along vibrocore 20. 

 

Sand was the most abundant type of sediment from the base of the sequence until ca. 1,000 

cal. years B.P., persistently comprising more than 50% of total sediments (Fig. IV.4a). Until 

ca. 3,500 cal. years B.P. it was escorted by significant amounts of gravel, together 

consistently comprising more than 95% of total sediments (Fig. IV.4a). Enhanced gravel 

deposition occurred between ca. 8,200 and 7,300 cal. years B.P., and again between ca. 5,600 

and 4,700 cal. years B.P., with abundances ranging from 30% to 40%. These depositional 

events were intercalated by a period (ca. 6,800-6,000 cal. years B.P.) when gravel decreased, 

reaching minimum values of ca. 20% of total sediment and this gravel depletion being 

compensated by an increase of sand content up to almost 80%. 

Between ca. 4,800 and 1,600 cal. years B.P., a gradual decrease of the gravel content was 

verified. From ca. 4,800 until 3,900 cal. years B.P. it comprised around 25% of total 

sediments, between ca. 3,900 and 2,700 cal. years B.P. it dropped to 10-15%, and between ca. 

2,700 and 1,600 cal. years B.P. it persistently attained less than 10%. This was consentaneous 

with an increase of sand, which was always above 72.5% during the same period and reaching 

more than 85-90% between ca. 3,900 cal. years B.P. and 1,000 cal. years B.P. Within this 

period, fines exhibited peaks of abundance around 3,000 cal. years B.P. and 1,700-1,800 cal. 

years B.P., of ca. 15% and 20%, respectively. As for gravel, it showed two significant 

abundance peaks, at ca. 1,450-1,380 cal. years B.P. with 15-25% of total sediment, and 

around 1,200-1,100 cal. years B.P. with 10.5-13% (Fig. IV.4a).  



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

45 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

The last ca. 1,000 years were characterized by a significant change in the depositional 

patterns (Fig. IV.4). Episodes of enhanced fine sedimentation (silt and clay) alternated with 

mostly sand depositional events, spanning for periods of more or less 100 to 300 years. 

During the period that lasted from ca. 1,060 to 930 cal. years B.P., silt increased to values of 

15-35%, escorting sand that roughly spanned from ca. 70% to 80%. A short event of finer 

deposition took place around 1,020-1,000 cal. years B.P., with enhanced clay sedimentation 

(ca. 12-20%) and sand content dropping to 40-50%. It was followed by a sand peak of 70-

85% between ca. 980 and 900 cal. years B.P., accompanied by a slight decrease of silt and 

clay to less than 5%. The period of ca. 870-840 cal. years B.P. corresponded to an episode of 

high silt and clay sedimentation, ca. 60% and 35%, respectively. From ca. 820 to 350 cal. 

years B.P., deposition exhibited very low clay contents and was dominated mostly by sand 

and silt, which alternated as the most abundant type of sediment along time. Hence, the period 

between ca. 820 and 620 cal. years B.P. was controlled by finer deposition, whilst from ca. 

600 to 320 cal. years B.P. sand content ousted silt. Silt and clay again dominated 

sedimentation from ca. 310 to 90 cal. years B.P., and from this age until present-day clay 

became almost absent, with sand increasing again to values close to 30-40%. However, during 

these last ca. 100 years that were marked by a tendency for finer deposition, an episode of 

enhanced coarser sedimentation occurred. It was evidenced by a significant increase of both 

sand and gravel at around 90-75 cal. years B.P., which show a sharp peak of abundance in a 

single event, with sand reaching 40% and gravel almost 20%. 

 

IV.1.3.2. Sand and gravel fraction compounds 

The sand and gravel fractions of vibrocore 20 exhibited different distribution patterns for 

their terrigenous and biogenic compounds, but nonetheless both fractions showed a clear and 

steady trend of increasing biogenic content from the base to the top of the sequence (Fig. 

IV.5). Sand-sized sediments were persistently dominated by terrigenous particles until ca. 

2,200 cal. years B.P., which showed particular high abundances (of ca. 80%) from the base of 

the sequence (at ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P.) up to ca. 5,700 cal. years B.P. (Fig. IV.5.a). From 

ca. 2,200 cal. years B.P. until the top of the sequence, deposition alternated episodes of 

terrigenous-dominated sand with biogenic-dominated sand (Fig. IV.5.a). Gravel-sized 

sediments revealed predominance of biogenic compounds throughout the sequence, except for 

a specific depositional event centered at ca. 8,600 cal. years B.P. (Fig. IV.5.b). However, the 

magnitude of the difference between the proportions of each type of gravel compounds was 



46

quite variable along time (Fig. IV.5.b). From the base of the sequence until ca. 3,800 cal. 

years B.P., biogenic overcame terrigenous compounds but with smaller margins of difference, 

whilst from that age until recent times they increased substantially and became consistently 

80% to almost 100% of the total gravel fraction (Fig. IV.5.b).

Within the sand fraction (Fig. IV.5.a), the oldest recorded period spanned from ca. 9,200 to 

8,400 cal. years B.P., and it was characterized by the highest amounts of quartz (ca. 80%) and 

lowest of biogenic compounds (ca. 7-9.5%). Within the terrigenous compounds, feldspars 

were present up to 5% and other terrigenous (OT) particles contributed with up to almost 9%. 

The biogenic component was constituted mainly by molluscs, which represented ca. 6-8% of 

the total sand fraction, and some fragments (&amp;lt;2.5%) of other bioclasts (OB). During the 

period that lasted from ca. 8,400 cal. years B.P. until ca. 5,800 cal. years B.P., the proportions 

of both aggregates and OT were maintained, whilst feldspars decreased substantially to less 

than 1.5%. At the same time, the biogenic compounds increased twofold, with molluscs 

reaching almost 20% of total sand. From ca. 5,800 cal. years B.P. until 3,000 cal. years B.P., 

there was a gradual and steady increase of molluscs up to almost 32%, accompanied by an 

increase (up to ca. 10%) of OB particles from around 4,700 cal. years B.P. Feldspars became 

totally absent from the record during this period. Between 3,000 and ca. 2,100 cal. years B.P., 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’

Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

sand became also devoid of aggregates. From ca. 2,100 and 1,700 cal. years B.P., OB 

increased to a maximum of ca. 13%, simultaneously with a fall in quartz abundance values 

down to ca. 40%. A new peak of terrigenous, mainly quartz, occurred at ca. 1,600-1,500 cal. 

years B.P., and it was contemporaneous with a decrease of OB particles. From this age until 

ca. 900 cal. years B.P., quartz decreased, while OB increased. Benthic foraminifera increased, 

although remaining with very low abundances of ca. 1-2.5%. At around 820 cal. years B.P., 

the highest amount of molluscs was verified, composing ca. 60% of the sand, concurrently 

with the lowest abundance of quartz, which was less than 20%. The phase between ca. 760 

and 520 cal. years B.P. witnessed enhanced sedimentation of mica, which was up to almost 

7.5%. Also, quartz increased again to ca. 30-40% and molluscs decreased from 60% to less 

than 50%. Another event of reduced terrigenous contribution took place at around 370 cal. 

years B.P., with less amounts of both quartz (25%) and mica (ca. 2.5%), attended by an 

increase of all biogenic compounds, in particular molluscs (ca. 55%) and OB (ca. 10%). It 

was followed by an episode of some reverse tendency, centered at ca. 300 cal. years B.P., 

characterized by an enhancement of quartz and mica deposition (ca. 40% and 6.5%, 

respectively), concomitant with a decrease in molluscs down to 25%. From this age until 

recent times, the abundances of terrigenous and biogenic compounds fluctuated around the 

same range of values. Quartz remained with lower abundances of 17% to less than 30%, mica 

around 3-4%, OT roughly 10%, benthic foraminifera between 2% and 5.5%, molluscs from 

35% to 45% and OB from ca. 13% up to 20%. In general, deposition of sand was always 

dominated by quartz and molluscs, which alternated as the predominant component along 

time. They were accompanied by a more or less stable contribution of OT and OB particles, 

and by increased abundances of benthic foraminifera and mica from ca. 1,800 and 850 cal. 

years B.P., respectively, up to the top of the sequence. 

Concerning the gravel fraction (Fig. IV.5.b), its abundance was not significant from the 

base of the sequence until close to 8,800 cal. years B.P. and thus the oldest considered period 

for its analysis was from ca. 8,800 to 8,500 cal. years B.P. It was characterized by the highest 

amount of terrigenous in the entire sedimentary sequence. Quartz (which included low 

amounts of quartzite) reached almost 50% of the total gravel fraction, whilst 

schist/greywackes also presented their highest abundances within the sequence (ca. 2-4.5%) 

and aggregates were 12.5%. The biogenic compounds were dominated almost exclusively by 

molluscs, with about 38% of total gravel. Between ca. 8,500 and 4,700 cal. years B.P., gravel 

was dominated by molluscs, which increased gradually from 50% until close to 72%, and the 

whole biogenic compound started to increase significantly from around 5,800 cal. years B.P. 



48 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

onwards. During this period, quartz decreased gradually from ca. 37% to 19% and 

schist/greywackes also diminished to 1-2%. Feldspars were present only at ca. 8,400 cal. 

years B.P. with 2% abundance. As for aggregate particles, their quantity was constantly 

around 7-9%, except for two peaks at ca. 7,500 cal. years B.P. and 5,800 cal. years B.P., with 

12.7% and 14.5%, respectively. Sandstones were constricted to around 6,600 cal. years B.P. 

with only 1.4%. The roughly 1,000 years-period that spanned from ca. 4,700 to 3,900 cal. 

years B.P. was marked by a further increase of molluscs up to ca. 83%, and a concomitant 

decrease of quartz down to ca. 9%. Aggregates also fell to values of 7.5-4.7% and 

schist/greywackes became less than 1%. During the next ca. 1,500 years, until ca. 2,400 cal. 

years B.P., the gravel fraction became much reduced. It witnessed an increase of the biogenic 

compounds, with molluscs reaching almost 90%, together with a decrease of quartz to values 

below 7%, and the total disappearance of schist/greywackes and sandstones. Gravel became 

again statistically representative at ca. 1,600 cal. years B.P. and lasting until ca. 1,100 cal. 

years B.P. The first hundred years of this period (ca. 1,600-1,500 cal. years B.P.) witnessed a 

drop in quartz to less than 1% and a return of sandstones that reached 4.5%, with both 

compounds representing the total contribution of terrigenous to the gravel fraction. As for the 

biogenic, molluscs surpassed 90% and OB particles were around 3.5-1.5%. From ca. 1,500 to 

1,100 cal. years B.P., quartz became totally absent and sandstones the predominant 

terrigenous compound (up to 4.5%). Molluscs clearly dominated gravel during this time with 

ca. 93-99%. From ca. 980 to 900 cal. years B.P., they were accompanied by vestigial amounts 

of OB particles, sandstones and aggregates (ca. 1.5%). A hiatus in gravel deposition occurred 

again from ca. 800 to 600 cal. years B.P., followed by more or less one hundred years (ca. 

520-440 cal. years B.P.) of fully biogenic gravel-sized particles, almost exclusively composed 

by molluscs (98-100%). From ca. 440 cal. years B.P. to present-day, gravel became once 

more statistically non-representative. 

 

IV.1.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture 

The shape (morphometry) and surface texture (morphoscopy) analyses of sandy quartz 

along vibrocore 20 revealed that high sphericity, rounded (SUBR, R and WR) and 

simultaneously smooth-shinning grains dominated sediments at this site of the inner shelf for 

most of the studied period (Fig. IV.6).

Figure IV.6 – Distribution (%) of sandy quartz grains along vibrocore 20 in relation to shape as a) sphericity and b) 
roundness, and to c) surface texture. Legend: SPHER – high sphericity, N-SPHER – low sphericity, VA – very angular, A – 
angular, SUBA – sub-angular, SUBR – sub-rounded, R – rounded, WR – well rounded, NU – not-worn, EL – smooth-
shining, RM – rounded-frosted, EL+RM – mixed EL and RM signatures. 
 

Sphericity characterization of the quartz grains (Fig. IV.6.a) indicated that the oldest 

recorded period (ca. 9,200-7,500 cal. years B.P.) was marked by predominance of high 

sphericity quartz with ca. 65-70%. Within this period, a localized event around 8,400 cal. 

years B.P. occurred, with high-sphericity grains reaching 76% of total sandy quartz. In the 

period between ca. 6,600 and 3,900 cal. years B.P., high and low sphericity grains alternated 

as the predominant quartz type. Two events with high sphericity quartz composing as much as 

75% of total grains took place at ca. 6,600 cal. years B.P. and 4,700 cal. years B.P. They were 

intercalated by other two events, at around 5,800 and 3,900 cal. years B.P., in which the 

abundances of low sphericity grains greatly increased to ca. 45% and 53%, respectively. From 

ca. 3,000 to 1,600 cal. years B.P., the proportions of sphericity types were rather stable and 

high sphericity quartz dominated with ca. 60-70%. A phase evidenced by the highest 

abundance values of high sphericity quartz (73-77%) along the sequence took place from ca. 

1,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 1,100 cal. years B.P. It was followed by a peak (ca. 40%) of low 

sphericity grains at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., and again by a short period (980-900 cal. years 

B.P.) of input of high sphericity grains (ca. 72-73%). The time between 760 and 520 cal. 

years B.P. was characterized by another increase of low sphericity quartz, which ranged from 

39% to 46%, although a peak of high sphericity (72%) was centered at ca. 590 cal. years B.P. 

From ca. 440 cal. years B.P. until recent times, high sphericity grains increased with 



50 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

abundances ranging from 65% to 72%, except for a drop to 60% very close to the top of the 

sedimentary record (at ca. 20 cal. years B.P.). 

The analysis of the roundness of quartz grains (Fig. IV.6.b) revealed that from ca. 9,200 to 

8,400 cal. years B.P., the record was dominated by rounded forms (SUBR, R and WR) but 

there were also significant proportions of angular forms (mainly A with 10-13% and SUBA 

with 10-18%). Subrounded (SUBR) quartz generally oscillated between ca. 35% and 40%, 

whilst rounded (R) quartz fluctuated between around 30% and 40%. Well rounded (WR) 

grains were practically absent from the record until ca. 8,800 cal. years B.P., and from that 

age until ca. 8,400 cal. years B.P. increased up to 10-13%. A specific event was registered at 

ca. 8,200 cal. years B.P., with angular (A) grains dropping to below 10%, SUBR reaching 

40% of total quartz and WR grains reaching a peak of 15%. From ca. 8,200 until 5,800 cal. 

years B.P. the abundance of SUBA grains increased to ca. 20-25% and conversely the R 

grains decreased to 23-28%, as well as the WR grains that were reduced to less than 10%. At 

the same time, A quartz was reduced to less than 10%. Between ca. 5,500 and 3,600 cal. years 

B.P., rounded forms again increased with SUBR grains reaching almost 50% of total quartz. 

The phase from around 3,600 cal. years B.P. to 1,800-1,700 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further 

increase of rounded (R) quartz up to 40%. The time interval 1,800-1,300 cal. years B.P. 

evidenced another rise of all angular forms, which constituted nearly 35% of total grains. 

From ca. 1,200 until 760 cal. years B.P. this tendency was reverted, with SUBA and A quartz 

diminishing to less than 10%. At the same time, SUBR grains reached abundances of up to 

almost 50%, R grains of up to ca. 40% and WR grains attained their highest value within the 

sedimentary sequence, of almost 20%. The next ca. 700 years, lasting until recent times, were 

distinguished by a gradual return to angular forms as SUBA and A quartz increased up to 20-

30%, and particularly R grains diminished to below 20%. Specifically VA quartz reached ca. 

10% in a single depositional episode centered at ca. 75 cal. years B.P, coincident with the 

total disappearance of WR grains. 

Regarding the study of quartz surface texture (Fig. IV.6.c), from the base of the sequence 

until ca. 8,500 cal. years B.P. there were significant amounts (up to 17%) of not-worn (NU) 

quartz reaching this area, along with smooth-shining (EL) grains that dominated sands with 

ca. 75-85%. From ca. 8,400 to 5,800 cal. years B.P., grains with a mixed signature of smooth-

shining and rounded-frosted (EL+RM) gained expression, composing between ca. 15% and 

almost 30% of total quartz. Contemporaneously, both NU and EL decreased to mean values 

of ca. 10% and 65%, respectively. The period ranging from ca. 5,500 to 3,800 cal. years B.P. 

was marked by a higher contribution of RM quartz (ca. 6%). A subsequent phase lasting ca. 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

51 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

300 years (from ca. 1,700 to 1,400 cal. years B.P.) was marked by an increase of NU grains 

up to ca. 25%, which then dropped to less than 5% at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., coincident 

with a peak of EL+RM grains of ca. 35%. A period of ca. 400 years followed, in which the 

contribution of NU again augmented to 10-16% and EL quartz decreased to ca. 50-60%. A 

well marked episode centered around 450-370 cal. years B.P. was determined by a drop in 

NU abundance to its lowest values within the sedimentary sequence (ca.3-8%). At the same 

time, EL grains increased to almost 70% and EL+RM quartz disappeared from the record. 

The next ca. 300 years witnessed a gradual recovery of NU, in parallel with a decrease of EL 

grains to values below 50% and an increase of EL+RM grains to ca. 35-45%. This period 

culminated with an event at ca. 75 cal. years B.P., characterized by the highest values of NU 

(ca. 30%) and mixed EL+RM (57%) grains along the entire sequence. Simultaneously, EL 

dropped to their lowermost abundance within the sequence, of ca. 10%. 

 

IV.2. Discussion 

The multi-proxy sedimentological analysis conducted in vibrocore 20 unravelled a 

succession of different depositional environments on this location of the Guadiana inner shelf 

for the period spanning from ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P until present-day. These depositional 

domains were distinguished by key sedimentological features (or evolutionary trends of such 

features), identified on basis of significant variations occurring within the set of the analysed 

proxies. For the last ca. 2,000, the higher resolution of the sedimentary record allowed a more 

detailed interpretation of events and the direct comparison with Historical information. This 

enabled the evaluation of the combined action of anthropogenic and recent climate impacts, 

which was one of the main aims of the present work. 

IV.2.1. Depositional environments 

Based on the previously mentioned key sedimentological features and trends, four main 

depositional stages were identified along the sedimentary record of vibrocore 20 for the 

evolution of this area throughout the analysed period (Fig. IV.7). 

Stage 1: from ca. 9,200 until 8,500-8,200 cal. years B.P. 

The first stage developed during the early Holocene (Fig. IV.7) and was characterized by 

apparently low sedimentation rates of about 54 cm/ka cal. B.P. (Fig. IV.3). This period 

corresponded to a time when the postglacial sea-level rise that marked the beginning of the 

Holocene was already in motion, as has been recognized since about 13,000-10,000 cal. years 



52 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

B.P. in several other regional coastal and marine archives for the same region (Dabrio et al., 

2000; Lario et al., 2002; Boski et al., 2002, Teixeira et al., 2005; Boski et al., 2008; Zazo et 

al., 2008) (Fig. II.7b). The sea-level rise certainly explains in part the inferred low 

sedimentation rates, as the sediments transported by the Guadiana River were partially 

retained inside the estuary. On the other hand, the existing lower sea level implied that this 

location was in a different environmental setting than today, and under a distinct sediment-

supply regime as our data seem to suggest. Sand clearly dominated deposition at this time, 

whilst silt and clay were absent from the record (Figs. IV.4a and IV.7). The terrigenous 

compounds exhibited their highest contribution to this area during this stage, dominating the 

sand and gravel fractions (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7). Within terrigenous sand, the highest amounts 

of quartz and lowest of biogenic compounds were verified, together with the highest content 

of feldspars in all of the sequence, and a significant content of OT particles (Figs. IV.5a and 

IV.7). Within terrigenous gravel, the most noticeable feature was the presence of Paleozoic 

schists/greywacke (S/G), which exhibited their highest abundances of the record, and also a 

noteworthy contribution of aggregates (Figs. IV.5b and IV.7). The biogenic component of 

both coarse fractions was composed almost exclusively by mollusc shells throughout this 

stage (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7). In what concerns sandy quartz, there was a predominance of 

smooth-shinning, rounded (mostly SUBR and R) and of spherical grains, although significant 

proportions of angular forms and an important contribution of not-worn grains also 

characterized this site during this time (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7). 

The clear dominance of sand, coupled with the absence of silt and clay material (Figs. 

IV.4a and IV.7), speaks in favor of a depositional environment where the prevailing 

conditions didn’t allow for the settling of fluvial-derived fine sediments. Present-day 

depositional patterns at identical depths of the inner shelf indicate that it is currently under the 

influence of the Guadiana River suspended load discharges (González et al., 2004; González 

et al., 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). Although sand typically dominates sediments at almost all 

depths of the inner shelf, continental-derived fine material has been found to be quite 

significant at the deepest areas of the inner shelf in the vicinity of the Guadiana River mouth, 

specifically below ca. 10 m water depth (Rosa et al., 2013). The absence of this riverine 

imprint during the beginning of the Holocene at this site is most probably linked with the 

lower sea levels that prevailed prior to and during the initial phases of the postglacial 

Flandrian marine transgression. Several studies conducted worldwide, including in the North 

Atlantic and more specifically in the Algarve coast and the Gulf of Cadis, have established 

sea-level rise curves for this period and are consensual in that the sea level was by then many 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

53 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

meters below its present-day position. In general, these curves seem to place the site of 

vibrocore 20 above sea level (Fig. II.7) but almost any of them agree on the exact magnitude 

of the lowered sea level, in some cases differing for more than 10 meters (Fig. II.7), thus 

reflecting the high degree of uncertainty that can be inherent to such reconstructions. Namely 

the two curves established specifically for the Algarve region, those of Teixeira et al. (2005) 

and of Delgado et al. (2012), indicate quite different sea levels for this period (Fig. II.7b; from 

ca. -11 to -4 m and from ca. -27 to -15 m, respectively, for the period 9,200 until 8,500-8,200 

cal. years B.P.). The latter puts indeed the current site of vibrocore 20 some meters above sea 

level at the beginning of the Holocene transgression, but its margin of error is rather high. On 

the contrary, the previous points to a different situation, in which this site would be very close 

to the coastline, and by the end of the present stage already ca. 10 m under the sea level. 

Considering this last scenario, the actual site of vibrocore 20 would have stand in an even 

shallower domain, probably transitional, or where deposition would be more identical to what 

has been detected in modern proximal areas above ca. 10 m that exhibit almost no muddy 

sediments and a strong domination of continental-derived terrigenous compounds (González 

et al., 2004 and 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). The bed-load exported by the Guadiana River into 

the coast (Portela et al., 2004) that concentrates mainly in the proximal areas near the river 

mouth (González et al., 2004), and the contribution of the littoral drift, which is mainly 

composed of sand and stands as a crucial regional sediment source into the Guadiana shelf 

(González et al., 2004), would dominate deposition in this area. Furthermore, data regarding 

the early Holocene evolution of the Guadiana Estuary (Boski et al., 2002) point to an 

accelerated phase of estuarine infilling by clayey sediments, between ca. 11,000 cal. years 

B.P. and 8,200-7,800 cal. years B.P. Consequently, it is expectable that the fluvial exports to 

the coast were by then deprived of a great amount of its suspended load. This in turn would 

facilitate the remobilization of this material from the shallow areas in the vicinity of the river 

mouth and the deposition would chiefly correspond to coarser sediments, as it seems to have 

been recorded in this location at this time. 

Concurrently, the most significant presence within the record of several fluvial-originated 

terrigenous compounds, both in the gravel and in the sand fractions (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7), 

seems to confirm the existence of such a depositional setting in this location. Coastal 

depositional processes in areas close to fluvial sediment sources have been acknowledged as 

accumulation spots for continental-derived coarse terrigenous particles (e.g., López-Galindo 

et al., 1999; González et al., 2004 and 2007; Rosa et al., 2013). In particular, the contribution 

of feldspars and the high contents of OT particles clearly reveal the strong influence of the 



54 
Chapter IV. Inner shelf environment 

Guadiana bed-load discharges. The OT particles are generated by the dismantling of igneous 

and metamorphic rocks along the Guadiana River basin and don’t resist during long transport 

paths, thus concentrating in proximity to the sediment source where the system is able to 

preserve less these stable elements, namely in the deltaic bulge just off the river mouth and 

down to 5m water depth where sediments are coarser (González et al., 2004; Rosa et al., 

2013). The same studies concluded that the fluvial-supplied OT tend to escort highly 

abundant marine shells (molluscs) at shallower waters just off the river mouth, which reflects 

quite well the general composition of sediments during this stage. Accordantly, the presence 

of feldspars has also been signalized at shallower depths under close continental sediment 

supplies, in neighbouring shelf areas of the Gulf of Cadis (López-Galindo et al., 1999). As for 

the gravel-sized S/G particles that are exclusively originated in the outcrops of the Guadiana 

River basin, they have been related with the direct fluvial exportations onto the inner shelf 

and reported to peak out immediately off the river mouth, always escorting  local OT 

depocenters (González et al., 2004 and 2007). The lowermost content of both the gravel- and 

sand-fraction biogenic compound, almost exclusively mollusc shells (Figs. IV.5 and IV.7), it 

is also indicative of a very proximal coastal domain. Transgressive deposits previously 

identified on the Guadiana shelf, characterized as well by high amounts of quartz and OT 

particles associated with S/G particles and comparatively low amounts of bioclasts, have been 

associated with a higher-energy and more proximal domain impacted by floods in the 

Guadiana Basin, namely a detritical fan (González et al., 2004). This study raised possibility 

that the lower sea levels implied the existence of an older detritical system at the beginning of 

the transgression, transporting sediments southward from the present-day Guadiana River 

mouth (González et al., 2004). The long term export patterns disclosure by sandy quartz seem 

to support this hypothesis. Although it cannot be disregarded the importance of reworking 

processes associated with coastal and littoral drift currents that are attested by predominant 

smooth-shinning and tended rounded spherical grains (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7), the significant 

contribution of angular and not-worn grains (Figs. IV.6 and IV.7) corroborates the scenario of 

enhanced impact of the fluvial bed-load discharges during this period. Modern distribution of 

quartz on the Guadiana shelf features larger quantities of not-worn grains in the vicinity of the 

river mouth, namely in the deltaic bulge area, directly associated with sediment input from the 

Guadiana basin (González et al., 2007). In the same way, angular quartz usually points to 

weak reworking and low remobilization that indicate proximity to the sediment sources.

MIDDLE SHELF MUD BODY

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

V.1. Results 

V.1.1. Lithological description and profiles 

The lithological description of the mud body sedimentary sequences was based on the 

direct observation of the deposits. This was carried out immediately after the vibrocores were 

opened and before sampling. The preliminary description of these deposits allowed the 

construction of log profiles for vibrocores 1, 6 and 14, aimed for the present study (Figs. V.1, 

V.2 and V.3). They have been intended to help visualize the general aspect of the main 

sedimentological features and fossiliferous content that characterized the three sequences 

retrieved from the Guadiana mud body. 

The sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.1) started at ca. 15,345 cal. B.P. (376-378 cm core 

depth) with the deposition of sandy muds escorted by small contents of gravel. The visible 

bioclastic content was very reduced and limited to some small-sized mollusc shell fragments. 

Close to the base of the core, this unit was characterized by more enhanced mud contents. 

They gradually decreased upwards in detriment of sand and gravel, until ca. 292 cm core 

depth, where an abrupt change in sedimentation set the terminus of this unit. 

The above unit went from ca. 292 cm until ca. 243 cm core depth and represented a period 

of finer sedimentation in this area. Deposits became clearly dominated by compact mud (silt 

and clay), as sand decreased to half and gravel became absent. No visible bioclastic content 

was detected within these deposits. 

The unit from ca. 243 cm until ca. 186 cm core depth showed again a gradual coarsening 

of sediments, with sand becoming dominant towards the top of the unit. Bioclastic remains 

appeared as rare near the base of the unit but small fragments of shells became much more 

abundant from ca. 205 cm core depth upwards. 

The overlaying unit that corresponded to the core depth-interval 186-128 cm, was marked 

by an increase of fine sediments, with mud content surpassing sand. Visible bioclasts were 

absent from this entire section of the core, except for one isolated bivalve shell found in the 

transition between the previous unit and the current one. 

A thin semi-liquid horizon (128-124 cm core depth) overlaid the preceding unit and was 

characterized by higher contents of sand and gravel. From here up to ca. 80 cm core depth, 

sediments consisted on a monotonous sequence of dark silty clays with no visible bioclasts. 

At the top of this unit, a thin anoxic layer marked the transition to the overlaying unit.

At ca. 80 cm core depth, sediments became slightly coarser due to another increase of 

sand-sized particles. Upwards, from this level until around 26 cm core depth (top level of the 

unit) deposition returned steadily and gradually to finer sediments. 

The top-most unit of vibrocore 1 (ca. 26-0 cm core depth) was composed almost 

exclusively of muds, mainly due to the enhancement of clayey sedimentation. 

The sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.2) started around 12,500 cal. B.P. (297-299 cm core 

depth) with the deposition of uniform clayey silts showing some content of sands, which 

characterized sedimentation until ca. 243 cm core depth. To the top of the unit, a few larger 

mollusc shells were present.

Between core levels 243 cm and 106 cm, deposition was dominated by a thick unit of 

muds with enhanced sand content and small amounts of gravel-sized particles. The 

dimensional composition of sediments remained rather constant with only small fluctuations, 

but some important variations of the bioclastic content were observed. Until ca. 223 cm core 

depth, sediments were devoid of visible bioclasts, except for some very small fragments of 

mollusc shells and one larger gastropod shell found at level 219 cm. The section ranging from 

ca. 223 cm to ca. 153 cm continued to present small fragments of shells and specifically the 

interval 170-153 cm evidenced several marks of bioturbation. Between ca. 153 cm core depth 

and the top of the unit (at 106 cm) most deposits were devoid of visible bioclasts, except for

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

two specific thin layers with concentrated small fragments of shells and gastropods, at levels 

142-138 cm and 116-112 cm, respectively. 

A thick unit developed between core levels ca. 106 cm and 39 cm, corresponding to a 

monotonous succession of clayey silts with much reduced sand content and almost total 

absence of visible bioclasts, although a few small fragments were identified at ca. 70-80 cm 

core depth and near the top of the unit. 

Upwards, from ca. 39 cm to 31 cm core depth a ca. 10 cm-thick horizon was deposited. 

Sediments consisted of even more abundant silt with significant clay content, whilst sand 

disappeared from the record. 

The overlaying unit comprised about 14 cm (from ca. 31 to 17 cm core depth) and 

evidenced a turn in the dominant size-fraction, with sediments becoming finer as clay content 

exceeded silt.  

The upper-most unit, going from ca. 17 cm core depth until the top of the sequence, 

consisted of once again silt-dominated sediments, with an important clay contribution. Close 

to the bottom of the unit, a black anoxic thin layer rich in organic debris was detected. 

Bioclasts continued to be absent from the deposits.  

The sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.3) started around 2,500 cal. B.P. (239-241.5 cm core 

depth) with the deposition of a very coarse layer (ca. 8.5 cm-thick), dominated by sandy 

sediments with important gravel content. Mud was present but in very low amounts. No 

visible bioclasts were detected. 

The above unit corresponded to the depth interval 233-225 cm and consisted on much finer 

sediments that were dominated by muds. Fine sands and gravel-sized particles were also 

present but in small amounts, whilst visible bioclasts remained absent. 

A thin horizon between 225 cm and 221 cm was again composed of coarser sediments, 

with gravel content surpassing mud. Small fragments of shells began to appear within these 

deposits. 

A new shift in deposition occurred between core levels 221 cm and 209 cm, with enhanced 

mud contribution and small quantities of both gravel and sand. Larger fragments of mollusc 

shells were present, together with a few unbroken bivalve shells. 

The unit established at the core depth-interval 209-197 cm corresponded to another coarser 

depositional event due to higher input of gravel, despite muds continuing to dominate 

sediments. Fragments of shells of various dimensions were identified.

represent mixed and mainly broken bioclastic content, with different symbol sizes attesting for the dimensional variability of 
the bioclasts found within the sediment layers. 
 

A thick unit developed between core levels 197 cm and 153 cm, dominated by muds but 

with a significant contribution of sands. The bioclastic content was abundant, consisting of 

medium-large fragments of mollusc shells and several unbroken bivalves. From the base to 

the top of the unit, a slight and gradual fining tendency of the sediments was observed. 

The transition from the previous unit to the above one, at the core depth-interval of 153-84 

cm, was gradational and the upwards fining trend previously observed was maintained. This 

unit was dominated by silt and clay, although a small contribution of sand-sized sediments 

persisted. The visible bioclastic content diminished and was sparse, consisting only on small 

mollusc fragments. 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

81 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

Another very thick unit developed between ca. 84 cm and 14 cm core depth. The transition 

was again gradational with an even more pronounced domination of fine sediments, as the 

deposits were composed almost exclusively of silts and clays. There was no visible bioclastic 

content. 

The uppermost unit (last ca. 14 cm of deposition) marked another return to a somewhat 

coarser trend, as muds continued to clearly dominate sediments but there was an increase of 

the sand content. Again, no visible bioclasts were identified within the topmost unit of the 

sequence. 

 

V.1.2. Age models 

Age models were constructed for the three mud body vibrocores, based on a total of eleven 

AMS radiocarbon datings obtained at selected depth levels along-core. In all vibrocores, the 

oldest dating was obtained near the base of the sequences, allowing in each one to establish an 

age for the oldest recorded sediments. Conventional radiocarbon ages are reported as years 

‘before present’ (B.P., ‘present’ = 1,950 A.D.). Calendar calibrated ages are reported as years 

‘before Christ’ or ‘Anno Domini’ (B.C./A.D.), and calibrated ages as years ‘before present’ 

(B.P.). All information concerning the dated levels, sample laboratory codes, radiocarbon and 

calibrated dating results, is summarized in Table V.1. 

In the case of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.4a), the base-level dating attributed an age of 15,758-

14,932 cal. years B.P. to the sedimentary sequence, making it the oldest of the three 

vibrocores. At core level 272-274, an age of ca. 14,385-13,707 cal. years B.P. was estimated. 

Where a transition to more muddy sediments occurred, level 182-184 cm was dated as being 

ca. 12,641-11,693 cal. years B.P. Age estimation attained at level 146-148 cm provided a date 

of 7,149-6,628 cal. years B.P. for these sediments. At level 120-122 cm, close to a further 

increase of muds towards the top of the sequence, the youngest age obtained for the record 

corresponded to 2,272-1,726 cal. years B.P. 

For vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.4b), the oldest date was obtained at core level 297-299 cm and 

corresponded to an age of ca. 12,816-12,111 cal. years B.P. At level 199-201 cm, dating 

results revealed an age of 5,928-5,475 cal. years B.P. Around a small peak of sand and gravel, 

dating analyses performed at 149-151 cm core depth indicated an age of 3,147-2,570 cal. 

years B.P. Finally, the most recent age acquired for this sequence was of 1,045-817 cal. years 

B.P. at level 108-110 cm, when a clear shift to enhanced mud deposition was set.

Concerning vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.4c), the first two datings revealed that the sedimentation 

was much more recent and for that reason no additional analyses were performed. The age of 

2,787-2,302 cal. years B.P. attributed to the base-level of the core (238-241.5 cm) revealed it 

to be the youngest sedimentary sequence of the three that were analysed. The second dating 

was carried out at level 132-136 cm, coincident with a depositional change towards enhanced 

silt contents that determined a definitive fining-up trend of sediments, and revealed an age of 

909-707 cal. years B.P. 

Sedimentation rates on the mud body evidenced an apparent generalized rising tendency 

along time, although vibrocore 1 seemed to reveal a long period with very low values that 

lasted from the beginning of the Holocene until around late Holocene (Fig. V.5). 

The sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.5a) exhibited mean sedimentation rates ranging 

between ca. 80 cm/ka and 48 cm/ka for the late Pleistocene- early Holocene period of the 

record, lasting from ca. 15,500 cal. years B.P. (at the base of the vibrocore) until ca. 12,000 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

cal. years B.P. Roughly coincident with the onset of the Holocene (11,700 cal. years B.P.), at 

ca. 12,000 cal. years B.P., there was an apparent accentuated drop of the rates, down to ca. 5 

cm/ka. These values seem to have persisted until close to 6,000 cal. years B.P. and then 

slightly increased to around 6.8 cm/ka, which apparently was maintained throughout the mid- 

and until late-Holocene. Around 2,000 cal. years B.P., the rates increased to values more close 

to those prior to the beginning of the Holocene, reaching ca. 60.5 cm/ka. 

Figure V.4 – Depth (cm), grain-size composition and levels selected for dating analysis along: a) vibrocore 1, b) vibrocore 6 
and c) vibrocore 14. Dating results are given in radiocarbon years B.P. and calibrated ages (cal. years B.P.).

vibrocore 14. The error-bars in the control-points of the age model curves represent the uncertainty (2?) of the calibrated 
dates. 
 

The sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.5b) appeared to have presented lower sedimentation 

rates for the oldest deposits, followed by a persistent increase throughout the Holocene. From 

ca. 12,500 cal. years B.P. until close to 6,000 cal. years B.P., the apparent mean rates were of 

ca. 14.5 cm/ka. Between this date and around 3,000 cal. years B.P. they slightly increased to 

ca. 17.5 cm/ka, and again for the period that lasted until ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., reaching ca. 



84 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

21 cm/ka. The last 1,000 years apparently recorded a significant increment of the mean rates 

that reached close to 120 cm/ka. 

The sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.5c), which comprised only the late Holocene, 

provided a similar evolutionary trend of the sedimentation rates. The almost two first 

millennia that have been recorded at this site, from ca. 2,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 800 cal. 

years B.P., were characterized by rates of about 60 cm/ka. During the last ca. 800 years, the 

rates increased more than twofold and reached values of ca. 165 cm/ka. 

 

V.1.3. Sediment characterization 

V.1.3.1. Grain-size 

The grain-size composition (sedimentary texture) of the mud body sequences (Fig. V.6) 

revealed a persistent dominance of fines (usually &gt; 60-70% of total sediments) and a 

generalized fining-up tendency, with particularly enhanced silt and clay deposition from 

around 2,000 cal years B.P. (vibrocore 1) and 1,000 cal. years B.P. (vibrocores 6 and 14). It is 

also worth of noting that the three sequences exhibited very identical grain-size compositional 

and mean patterns for the same periods along the time record (Fig. V.6). 

 
Figure V.6 – Sediment grain-size composition (%) and mean grain-size (phi - ?) on the mud body: a) and b) vibrocore 1; c) 
and d) vibrocore 6; e) and f) vibrocore 14. 

 

The sequence of vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.6a-b) initiated at ca. 15,345 cal. years B.P. with a 

series of depositional cycles that alternated enhanced coarse-sized sediments, particularly 

sand, with greater inputs of fine material to the mid-shelf. These cycles started as shorter 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

85 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

episodes of about 500 year-depositional periods from ca. 15,500 until 14,250 cal. years B.P., 

and became longer towards the beginning of the Holocene, close to 12,000-11,500 cal. years 

B.P. The early Holocene around 12,000 cal. years B.P. was marked by an increase of fines, 

noticeably of silt, and a concurrent decrease of sands. This depositional pattern was 

maintained relatively constant throughout most of the Holocene, with only some fluctuations 

mainly around the relative proportions of sand- and clay-sized sediments. Around 3,000-2,500 

cal. years B.P. an episode of enhanced gravel input occurred, setting the transition to a new 

depositional phase. It started at about 2,200 cal. years B.P. with silt-dominated deposition 

accompanied by ca. 40% of clay and almost 10% of sand, which gradually passed to a clay-

dominated environment (almost 60% of clay). Simultaneously, sand content diminished 

upwards until it became absent at ca. 1,250 cal. years B.P. Around this date, another rapid 

change in sedimentation determined a shift to the next phase, as sands reappeared with ca. 

15% in detriment of clay material. From 1,250 cal. years B.P. until close to 300 cal. years 

B.P., sand was always significant within the deposits but slowly decreasing towards the top. 

At ca. 300 cal. years B.P., sand disappeared from the record, concomitantly with an increase 

of clay content that persisted until recent times. 

The sequence of vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.6c-d) was permanently dominated by muddy 

sediments from the base until the top of the record but evident oscillations on the abundances 

of all the textural classes did occur. The record started in early Holocene at ca. 12,500 cal. 

years B.P. with an abundant deposition of silt-dominated muds to which sand contributed 

with ca. 10-15%, lasting until ca. 10,000 cal. years B.P. The time interval 10,000-6,500 cal. 

years B.P. was marked by a slight increase of the coarse-grained fraction. Although always in 

vestigial amounts, gravel appeared in the record with successive small peaks, whilst sand was 

persistently around 20%. Between ca. 6,500 cal. years B.P. and 5,000 cal. years B.P., the 

deposition became again finer due to a small rise in the abundance of both the silt and clay 

fractions. The period ranging from ca. 5,000 cal. years B.P. until ca. 2,300 cal. years B.P. set a 

return to slightly coarser conditions, with gravel increasing and clay contents diminishing. 

This phase terminated with a specific event centred at about 2,400 cal. years B.P. that was 

characterized by a peak of abundance of the gravel-size fraction (ca. 15% of total sediments), 

correspondent to the highest gravel content within the entire record. From 2,300 cal. years 

B.P. until close to 800 cal. years B.P. gravel contents dropped and silt increased. The time 

spanning from ca. 800 cal. years B.P. up to ca. 300 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further increase 

of fine sedimentation, in particular of silt, as gravel disappeared completely and sand became 

vestigial. At around 300 cal. years B.P., an episode of enhanced clay deposition that reached 



86 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

about 60% of total sediments marked the transition to the most recent depositional phase. This 

last phase was characterized by persistent very high clay contents, with sediments being 

entirely composed of silt and clay until recent times. 

The sequence of vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.6e-f) started with several well pronounced, short-

lived coarser- and finer-alternated depositional cycles that took place between the base of the 

vibrocore at around 2,550 cal. years B.P. and ca. 1,950 cal. years B.P. The first cycle 

presented more than 50% of gravel content, escorted by small amounts of sand and silt, and 

by ca. 20% of clay. At around 2,500 cal. years B.P. a new cycle of reverted tendency was set 

with gravel dropping to nearly 10%, whilst clay and silt increased to almost 40% and to 35%, 

respectively. Another coarse-enhanced depositional cycle occurred at around 2,480 cal. years 

B.P., with gravel peaking close to 70% and both silt and clay diminishing to less than half-

content. It was succeeded by a longer depositional cycle between ca. 2,450 and 2,320 cal. 

years B.P., which was characterized by gravel content below 20%, increased sand up to ca. 

15% and enhanced silt and clay that made up 40% and 35% of the deposits, respectively. At 

ca. 2,300 cal. years B.P. another important peak of gravel (of ca. 60%) was accompanied by a 

great decrease of all the other grain-size fractions. From ca. 2,280 cal. years B.P. until ca. 

2,050 cal. years B.P. mud sediments dominated deposition with ca. 85%, except for a 

localized event at 2,150 cal. years B.P. when gravel reached almost 15%. The last significant 

gravel contribution within the sequence took place at about 2,000 cal. years B.P. with ca. 

35%. At around 1,950 cal. years B.P. an important shift in the depositional pattern was put 

into motion, with the end of the short depositional cycles. A longer depositional phase 

commenced and lasted until ca. 1,100 cal. years B.P., featuring reduced gravel content that 

was always below 15% and gradually decreased together with sand. At the same time, clay 

continued contributing with ca. 35% while silt progressively increased. From ca. 1,100 cal. 

years B.P. until ca. 500 cal. years B.P. the sedimentation became even finer, with sand 

contents of around 5% and muds composing the remaining ca. 95% of total sediments. The 

time interval of ca. 500-200 cal. years B.P. witnessed the complete disappearance of the 

coarse-fraction and the deposits were fully mud-composed. From ca. 200 cal. years B.P. until 

the top of the record, sand was again present but with just 5-10%. The exception was an event 

centred at ca. 45-25 cal. years B.P., in which sand increased to 15-18%.

V.1.3.2. Sand fraction compounds 

All the three sequences of the mud body exhibited specific evolutionary trends concerning 

their terrigenous and biogenic composition of sand (Fig. V.7). However, the overall 

distribution of compounds along time revealed a generalized domination of terrigenous and an 

increase in the diversity of the bioclasts towards the top of the sequences (Fig. V.7). Within 

terrigenous quartz was almost always the most abundant compound, whereas bioclasts were 

dominated by molluscs, except the last 7,000 years of vibrocore 1, usually dominated by 

benthic foraminifera (Fig. V.7). 

 
Figure V.7 – Relative abundances (%) of sand compounds and proportion (%) of terrigenous versus biogenic compounds on 
the mud body: a) and b) vibrocore 1; c) and d) vibrocore 6; e) and f) vibrocore 14. Legend: OT – other terrigenous, AGG – 
aggregates, S/G – schist/greywackes, SANDST – sandstones, CARBLIT – carbonate lithoclasts, BFORAMS – benthic 
foraminifera, PFORAMS – planktonic foraminifera, OB – other bioclasts. 
 

The record of vibrocore 1 (Figs. V.7a-b) started in the late Pleistocene, at ca. 15,500 cal. 

years B.P., with enhanced sandy terrigenous contents of almost 90%, to which quartz 

contributed with 50-65%, being escorted by ca. 15% of other terrigenous (OT) particles and 

vestigial mica, whilst molluscs dominated the biogenic compound. The next phase went from 

ca.  14,800 cal. years B.P. to ca. 13,000-12,900 cal. years B.P. and showed the same 

proportion of terrigenous versus biogenic compounds but an accentuated decrease of quartz to 

values oscillating between 20% and 40%, in favour of enhanced contents of mica (ca. 5-35%) 

and particularly of OT (ca. 25-40%). Mollusc shells continued to dominate the biogenic 

compound with ca. 15-20% of total sand. The phase from ca. 13,000-12,900 until 11,800 cal. 

years B.P. was characterized by a shift in the composition of sand, evidenced by an important 

increase of the bioclasts due to higher mollusc content and the appearance of benthic 



88 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

foraminiferal tests that attained ca. 5%. At the same time there was a significant decrease of 

the OT down to ca. 20-25% and of mica down to ca. 5-10%. Between ca. 11,800 and 9,000 

cal. years B.P., roughly coincident with the beginning of the Holocene, mica deposited again 

with up to ca. 15-20% and there was a slight decrease of the biogenic compound, more 

noticeably of the mollusc content. The time interval of ca. 9,000 cal. years B.P. until ca. 7,500 

cal. years B.P. translated an evident change in the characteristics of sand. There was a strong 

terrigenous increase driven mainly by higher abundances of OT particles in detriment of 

much lower abundances of mollusc shells, leading to the almost full domination of the 

biogenic compound by benthic foraminifera. During the period that followed, from ca. 7,500 

until 5,700 cal. years B.P., the relative proportions of terrigenous and bioclasts remained 

rather constant but there was a significant change within the first, as mica gradually decreased 

to about 5%, and quartz and the OT were much enhanced to nearly 50% and more than 20%, 

respectively. A long depositional period succeeded between 5,700 cal. years B.P. and ca. 

1,800 cal. years B.P., in which all sand compounds and the terrigenous/biogenic proportions 

were generally maintained, although quartz steadily decreased upwards in detriment of mica 

and planktonic foraminifera that made their first appearance and rapidly reached nearly 8%. 

Afterwards, the late Holocene was distinguished by some accentuated depositional changes. 

The first significant phase was centred around 1,700 to 1,200 cal. years B.P., with a fast turn 

in sedimentation that led to the highest abundance peak (&gt; 60% of total sand) of the biogenic 

along the entire sequence. Both benthic and planktonic foraminifera increased twofold to ca. 

30% and 11%, respectively, and molluscs and other bioclasts (OB) tripled up to around 10%. 

Within terrigenous, quartz evidenced the most pronounced drop from ca. 40% to 18%, but OT 

particles were also reduced from ca. 25% to 15%. A depositional episode then occurred 

around 1,100 cal. years B.P., with another rise in terrigenous, namely quartz that dominated 

sand with ca. 60% and OT. Concurrently, benthic foraminiferal content dropped to half and 

all other biogenic compounds practically disappeared. Starting at around 900-800 cal. years 

B.P. and until close to present-day, the last depositional phase saw a general increase of all 

biogenic and also of mica, whilst quartz and OT progressively diminished. A specific event 

centred at ca. 180 cal. years B.P. is worth noting, when OT again showed an abundance peak 

in detriment of decreased mica and OB, which became almost absent from the record. 

The record of vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.7c-d) showed that from the base of the sequence, at ca. 

12,500 cal. years B.P., until around 9,200 cal. years B.P. the sand fraction was clearly 

dominated by ca. 80-85% of terrigenous material. Within it, quartz was predominant with 

about 50% of total sand, escorted by an important contribution of OT particles (ca. 20-30%) 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

and by ca. 2.5-8% of mica. Regarding the biogenic compounds, mollusc shells dominated 

these older deposits. The phase between ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. and 7,200 cal. years B.P. 

witnessed an increase of the biogenic up to ca. 30%, mainly due to more abundant mollusc 

contents and increasing benthic foraminifera (up to ca. 5%) that were concomitant with a 

decrease in quartz. The period lasting until ca. 5,700 cal. years B.P. was marked by a rise in 

terrigenous, with the increase of quartz and OT particles, and reduced biogenic contents that 

were driven mainly by less amounts of mollusc shells. The 5,700-5,500 cal. years B.P. 

timeline then set a definitive turn within the record, with the older sediments being clearly 

dominated by terrigenous and sediments deposited after that date becoming gradually 

enriched in bioclasts until the top of the sequence. Hence, the period from 5,700 until ca. 

2,500-2,200 cal. years B.P. witnessed a gradual and significant increase of the whole biogenic 

compound, particularly of molluscs that composed almost 40% of total sand, and of benthic 

foraminifera that doubled to ca. 8%. At the same time, quartz diminished to a minimum of ca. 

35% and mica became vestigial. The depositional phase between ca. 2,500-2,200 cal. years 

B.P. and 1,100 cal. years B.P. exhibited a moderate but steady trend of increasing and 

diversifying terrigenous, mainly due to an important contribution of aggregates that composed 

almost 15% of sand, in detriment of mollusc content. Although vestigial, it is worth noting 

that mica reappeared in the deposits, escorting the aggregate particles. The last ca. 1,000 years 

were characterized by fast, short-phased oscillations of almost all terrigenous and biogenic 

compounds. Between ca. 1,100 and 600 cal. years B.P. terrigenous peaked out with almost 

70% of total sand, as quartz attained ca. 55%. However, aggregates disappeared during this 

time. The following depositional phase, lasting from ca. 600 until 300 cal. years B.P., showed 

a reverse tendency. Bioclasts made their highest contribution within the record (almost 60%), 

with benthic foraminifera reaching a peak of 14%, molluscs increasing to ca. 25-30% and 

other bioclasts (OB) to ca. 9-12%. Within the terrigenous, quartz dropped to ca. 36% and OT 

also decreased. From ca. 300 cal. years B.P. until ca. 100 cal. years B.P. an important 

depositional shift determined the highest abundance of terrigenous compounds in the whole 

sequence, which peaked out with 95% of total sand. Amongst terrigenous, quartz contributed 

with 50% and aggregates reappeared with about 5%, whilst the most noticeable features were 

an input of mica of ca. 23% and the arise of charcoal particles (ca. 7.5-9.5%) that were present 

only during this period. Contemporaneously, the much reduced biogenic contribution was 

limited to mollusc shells. The last ca. 100 years witnessed a gradual recovery of all biogenic 

compounds, in particular of benthic foraminifera and molluscs (ca. 15-20% and 17.5%, 

respectively), whilst mica returned to abundances below 5%.  



90 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

The record of vibrocore 14 (Figs. V.7e-f) began at ca. 2,600 cal. years B.P. and the oldest 

depositional phase lasted from this date until ca. 2,300 cal. years B.P., with terrigenous sand 

(ca. 55%) slightly surpassing biogenic sand (c. 45%). It was characterized by high diversity of 

terrigenous compounds that were dominated by ca. 40% of quartz and included ca. 2% of 

fragments of schist/greywackes (S/G), of sandstones and of aggregates, together with ca. 8% 

of OT. Bioclasts were dominated by molluscs that composed ca. 30% of sand, but had also an 

important contribution of benthic foraminifera with ca. 5-10%. From 2,400 cal. years B.P. 

until ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. there was a further enhancement of terrigenous up to 70% of 

total sand, mainly due to the increase of quartz up to ca. 55% and of OT up to ca. 20%, in 

detriment of reduced mollusc content. However, and despite the abundance rise of carbonate 

lithoclasts (CARBLIT) during this time, terrigenous became less diversified as S/G and 

sandstones disappeared from the record. Between ca. 2,000 and 1,500 cal. years B.P. bioclasts 

generally increased to ca. 50% of total sand, mostly driven by increased contents of mollusc 

shells. At the same time, there was a significant decrease of OT particles, which dropped from 

ca. 14% to 6.5%, but S/G contributed again to sedimentation. The short phase lasting from ca. 

1,500 cal. years B.P. until 1,300 cal. years B.P. witnessed a further enhancement of bioclasts, 

especially due to an important increase of benthic foraminifera up to 13%. Molluscs also 

increased and planktonic foraminifera, although vestigial (ca. 3%), slightly increased in this 

period. Terrigenous were reduced to ca. 35% of quartz, 10% of OT and the first contribution 

of mica that was nonetheless vestigial. Between ca. 1,300 cal. and 700 cal. years B.P. there 

was a gradual recovery of terrigenous with increased abundances of quartz, mica and OT, 

against an impoverishment in molluscs and benthic foraminifera. In the period ranging from 

ca. 700 to 250 cal. years B.P., the composition of sand oscillated several times, chiefly due to 

alternated higher and lower quartz abundance in opposition to decreased or increased biogenic 

contribution. Notwithstanding, in general this period was marked by much more abundant 

benthic and planktonic foraminifera (ca. up to almost 30% and 5%, respectively), together 

becoming more abundant than molluscs, and by much lower amounts of OT that accompanied 

a general decrease in quartz. The last ca. 250 years of deposition featured another increase of 

terrigenous up to ca. 65% until the top of the sequence, mostly because of enhanced OT 

supplies. CARBLIT reappeared in very small amounts, and simultaneously mica became 

absent. Within bioclasts, benthic foraminifera were co-dominant with molluscs, escorted by 

OB fragments and planktonic foraminifera.

V.1.3.3. Quartz shape and surface texture 

The shape and surface texture characterization of sandy quartz was possible only for 

vibrocores 6 and 14, because the sand fraction 1-2? in most of the samples from vibrocore 1 

did not provide the minimum number of quartz grains required for this analysis. The quartz 

shape and surface characteristics revealed quite common features and trends at both mid-shelf 

sites for most of the studied period (Fig. V.8). Namely, the very similar proportions of high 

and low spherical quartz, together with the predominance of rounded forms and smooth-

shinning textures, coupled with an important contribution of not-worn grains (Fig. V.8). 

However, somewhat distinctive patterns were also observed along the sequences (Fig. V.8). 

 
Figure V.8 – Distribution (%) of sandy quartz grains in relation to: a) and d) sphericity, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14; 
b) and e) roundness, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14; c) and f) surface texture, along vibrocore 6 and vibrocore 14. 
N/D (‘no-data’) refers to sections of the sedimentary sequences where the number of quartz grains was insufficient for 
counting. Legend: SPHER – high sphericity, N-SPHER – low sphericity, A – angular, SUBA – sub-angular, SUBR – sub-
rounded, R – rounded, WR – well rounded, NU – not-worn, EL – smooth-shining, RM – rounded-frosted, EL+RM – mixed 
EL and RM signatures. 
 

Along vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.8a-c), the oldest period (from the base of the sequence at ca. 

12,500 cal. years B.P. until ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P.) was characterized by the highest 

proportions of angular forms found within the entire record, reaching ca. 55-60% of total 

quartz, and concurrently by the highest amounts of not-worn quartz (particularly after ca. 

11,800 cal. years B.P.) that reached up to 60% of all the grains. At ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. 

the quartz characteristics changed rapidly, translated by a great increase of rounded forms and 

smooth-shining grains that became dominant with ca. 80%-90%. After this date and 

throughout early- to late-Holocene until ca. 3,800 cal. years B.P., these characteristics 



92 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

remained rather stable but with a slight gradual increase of all rounded forms (sub-rounded, 

rounded and well rounded). Indeed it is worth mentioning the appearance of well rounded 

(WR) quartz around 8,400 cal. years B.P. and its steady increase up to almost 15%. Between 

ca. 3,800 cal. years B.P. and 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P. there was some increase of not-worn 

(NU) quartz that showed a peak of abundance (nearly 20%) around 3,000 cal. years B.P. It 

was coincident with a peak of low sphericity quartz (ca. 60%) that corresponded to the highest 

contribution of this type of grains within the sequence. Around 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P., at 

the transition to the last and most recent phase, NU quartz exhibited a significant drop down 

to ca. 5% that was contemporaneous with the highest amounts of WR grains (ca. 20% of total 

quartz). From ca. 1,700-1,600 cal. years B.P. upwards, SUBA and NU quartz gradually 

increased, the latter reaching 25% at around 860 cal. years B.P. From this date onwards and 

until the top of the sequence, it was not possible to obtain information on sandy quartz due to 

insufficient material for analysis. 

Along vibrocore 14 (Figs. V.8d-f), the first phase lasted from ca. 2,500 cal. years B.P. 

until ca. 2,200 cal. years B.P. and corresponded to abundance peaks of low sphericity, angular 

(A) and NU quartz. The time interval of 2,200-1,200 cal. years B.P. continued with the 

dominance of all rounded forms but showing a gradual decreasing trend towards the top, 

accompanied by the gradual increase of NU grains in detriment of blunt-shining (EL) quartz. 

The period between ca. 1,200 and 900 cal. years B.P. was marked by an enhancement of all 

rounded forms that constituted 70% of total quartz, simultaneously with a small increase of 

EL grains. From ca. 900 until 550 cal. years B.P., there was another peak of NU quartz, which 

reached ca. 50% and constituted its highest abundance value in the entire record. It was 

concomitant with an enrichment of angular forms that had an identical contribution. For the 

time interval 550-250 cal. years B.P. it was not possible to characterize sandy quartz due to 

the lack of sufficient grains for analysis. From ca. 250 to 80 cal. years B.P., quartz grains 

revealed a dominance of rounded forms with ca. 55%, whilst NU grains slightly decreased but 

maintained high values of ca. 40-45%. The last ca. 80 years of deposition revealed 

insufficient material for analysis.

mode clusters along the three mud body vibrocores, are represented in Figures V.9, V.10 and 

V.11. In vibrocore 1, core levels 360-362 cm, 350-352 cm, 340-342 cm, 300-302 cm, 260-262 

cm, 250-252 cm, and 230-232 cm did not present the minimum number (300) of foraminiferal 

specimens for counting and identification. The same was verified in vibrocore 6 for core 

levels 19-20 cm and 31-32 cm. These samples were excluded from the statistical analysis. 

A total of 21 species with abundance &gt;5% in at least one sample, all calcareous, were 

identified in the three vibrocores. Amongst them, 7 species were present in all vibrocores, 

namely Bolivina ordinaria, Brizalina dilatata, Bulimina marginata, Cassidulina laevigata, 

Cassidulina minuta, Cribrononion gerthi and Epistominella exigua. With the opposite 

behaviour, eight species were found only in one of the vibrocores (five in vibrocore 1 and 

three in vibrocore 6), namely Bulimina aculeata, Gavelinopsis praegeri, Hyalinea balthica, 

Nonionella stella, Rectuvigerina phlegeri, Stainforthia fusiformis, Trifarina carinata and 

Valvulineria bradyana. The remaining six species were present in two of the three vibrocores, 

namely Asterigerinata mamilla, Ammonia beccarii, Bolivina pseudoplicata, Bulimina 

elongata, Bolivina striatula and Nonion fabum. R-mode cluster analysis results for all the 

main 21 benthic foraminiferal species of the three sequences are represented in Figure V.12. 

Vibrocore 1 

The FD varied between 13 and 6,434 specimens per gram of dry sediment (specimens/g) 

with a clear increasing trend from the base towards the top of the sequence (Fig. V.9). 

Between the base at ca. 15,300 cal. years B.P. and ca. 12,600 cal. years B.P., the FD 

persistently exhibited the lowest values, of about 13 to 790 specimens/g. From 1,800-1,700 

cal. years B.P. until close to present-day the values showed great oscillations, with a 

maximum of 6,434 specimens/g at around 1,300 cal. years B.P. Species richness (S) and the 

diversity index Hs showed very similar trends along time (Fig. V.9), their highest values 

being observed at the base of the core, 78 species and Hs of 3.5, respectively. High variability 

of values occurred from ca. 15,200 until 11,500 cal. years B.P., with S between 60 and 43, 

and Hs between 2.77 and 3.1. As for evenness (J), it exhibited persistently constant mean 

values of ca. 0.725-0.813 (Fig. V.9). 

A total of 17 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix A) and the Q-

mode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I1 and II1, which 

grouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.9). 

- The period between ca. 15,300 and 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I1) was 

characterized by high abundances (ca. 30%) of B. ordinaria and also by up to 30% of A.

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

mamilla (decreasing values upwards), ca. 20-30% of C. gerthi, and ca. 20% of A. beccarii 

(decreasing values upwards), C. laevigata (increasing values upwards) and B. dilatata 

(increasing values upwards). They were escorted by much smaller percentages (ca. 5-10%) of 

almost all the other species, except H. balthica, B. marginata and B. striatula that were 

practically absent from the record. From ca. 15,300 until 12,600 cal. years B.P., B. ordinaria 

and A. mamilla co-dominated (ca. 20% and 30%, respectively) and were accompanied by ca. 

10% of B. pseudoplicata and B. elongata, and ca. 5% of G. praegeri, T. carinata, S. 

fusiformis, N. stella, E. exigua and C. minuta. From ca. 12,600 until 10,600 cal. years B.P., 

the most abundant species was C. gerthi that increased to ca. 30%, whilst B. ordinaria and A. 

mamilla decreased to less than 15%; C. laevigata and B. dilatata gradually increased to ca. 

10%, and also C. minuta to more than 5%; at the same time, B. elongata, G. praegeri, T. 

carinata, S. fusiformis and N. stella became practically absent. From ca. 10,600 until 8,000 

cal. years B.P., C. laevigata and B. dilatata further increased to ca. 15% and were co-

dominant with B. ordinaria, whereas C. gerthi, A. beccarii and A. mamilla gradually 

decreased, the latter becoming almost absent.

- The period between ca. 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. until the present (Cluster II1) was 

co-dominated by species C. laevigata and B. dilatata (with ca. 15-20%) and still significant 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

95 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

abundances of B. ordinaria (ca. 10-15%). Following these, the most representative species 

(with ca. 5-10%) were C. gerthi that decreased towards the top, and E. exigua, H. balthica, C. 

minuta, B. marginata and B. striatula that increased towards the top. From ca. 8,000-7,800 

until 2,000 cal. years B.P., these abundance values remained rather constant, although C. 

gerthi continued to decrease whereas B. marginata and B. striatula gradually increased. From 

ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. until the present, these species presented the same mean abundance 

values but exhibiting more pronounced oscillations. 

Vibrocore 6 

The FD varied between 269 and 1,659 specimens/g with the highest values obtained for the 

middle part of the sequence, between ca. 9,500 and 2,500 cal. years B.P. (Fig. V.10). Species 

richness (S) was more or less constant around 40-50 from the base of the core until ca. 3,500 

cal. years B.P., except for a small peak (54 species) registered at ca. 10,600 cal. years B.P. 

(Fig. V.10). At ca. 860 cal. years B.P. the highest S value (63 species) was verified but this 

date simultaneously marked a transition to the period with the lowest S values (38 to 47) of 

the sequence, which lasted until close to present. The diversity index Hs and evenness (J) 

showed low variability throughout most of the sequence, in particular from the core base until 

ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P. (Fig. V.10). Between ca. 12,200 and 1,000 cal. years B.P. Hs was 

around 2.5 to 3 and J was around 0.7 to 0.8. At about 750 cal. years B.P. the lowest diversity 

of less than 2.5 and lowest J of ca. 0.66 were verified. Afterwards and until present-day, Hs 

slightly increased to around 2.8 and J to around 0.75. 

A total of 15 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix B) and the Q-

mode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I6 and II6, which 

grouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.10). 

- The period between ca. 12,500 and 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I6) was 

characterized by high abundances of ca. 25-30% for species B. ordinaria and A. mamilla that 

co-dominated the foraminiferal record. Nonion fabum, A. beccarii, R. phlegeri, C. minuta, B. 

elongata, B. pseudoplicata, C. gerthi, C. laevigata and B. dilatata were the other most 

important species with abundance values around 5-10%. From 12,500 until ca. 9,200 cal. 

years B.P., dominant B. ordinaria and A. mamilla were mainly escorted by N. fabum, B. 

elongata, B. pseudoplicata and C. gerthi. From ca. 9,200 until 3,000 cal. years B.P., A. 

mamilla steadily decreased down to vestigial abundances (ca. 1%) whereas B. elongata and B. 

pseudoplicata also gradually decreased from ca. 10% to less than ca. 5%. Conversely, A. 

beccarii, R. phlegeri, C. gerthi, C. laevigata and B. dilatata increased from ca. 5% to ca. 10%.

V. bradyana, B. aculeata and E. exigua made their first appearance with small but increasing 

amounts of less than 5%.

along the vibrocore; the thin punctuated line represents a subdivision within Cluster I6. Thin blanked band on the top of the 
record corresponds to levels where no data was obtained due to insufficient specimens for counting. 
 

- The period ranging between ca. 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. and present-day (Cluster 

II6) witnessed even greater abundances of B. ordinaria that dominated the record with 30-

40%. Almost all the other species showed a general increase during this time interval, E. 

exigua, B. elongata, C. minuta and B. dilatata particularly after ca. 1,200-1,000 cal. years 

B.P., and V. bradyana after ca. 500 cal. years B.P. Asterigerinata mamilla and B. 

pseudoplicata showed a reverse tendency, becoming practically absent. 

Vibrocore 14 

The FD varied between 361 and 7,069 specimens/g and showed the most pronounced 

variation from the core base, around 2,500 cal. years B.P., until ca. 1,400 cal. years B.P. (Fig. 

V.11). At the base of the sequence, FD registered a very high abundance of 6,290 specimens 

per gram of dry sediment, followed by a drop to ca. 770 specimens/g at around 2,100 cal. 

years B.P. At ca. 1,600 cal. years B.P., FD reached the highest value within the sequence, of 

ca. 7,069 specimens/g. From ca. 1,500-1,400 until 600 cal. years B.P. the FD was lower with 

mean values of ca. 1,900-2,900 specimens/g. The period between ca. 600 and 100 cal. years 

B.P. witnessed a further decrease to mean values of 351-858 specimens/g. In the last 100 

years the FD increased up to ca. 2,835-4,060 specimens/g. Species richness (S) also oscillated 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

97 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

throughout time, showing a general trend for higher values from the core base until ca. 1,400 

cal. years B.P. (around 50-60 species) and for lower values from this date until the present 

(around 40-50 species) (Fig. V.11). The lowest S value of 29 species occurred around 300 cal. 

years B.P. Diversity index Hs and evenness (J) were rather constant and evidenced similar 

trends throughout time (Fig. V.11). Slightly higher values for both Hs and J were obtained 

from the core base until ca. 1,500 cal. years B.P., of ca. 2.8-3.2 and 0.75, respectively. 

Between this date and modern times values were around 2.5 for Hs and 0.7 for J.

benthic foraminiferal species: the black dashed line separates the two main stratigraphically constrained zones (Clusters I-II) 
along the vibrocore; thin punctuated lines represent subdivisions within the main zones. 
 

A total of 9 main benthic foraminiferal species were identified (Appendix C) and the Q-

mode cluster analysis revealed two main periods correspondent to Clusters I14 and II14, 

which grouped sample levels with different proportions of benthic species (Fig. V.11). 

- The period between ca. 2,500 and 600 cal. years B.P. (Cluster I14) was characterized 

by the dominance of B.dilatata, C. laevigata and B. ordinaria that presented persistent mean 

values of about 15% to 25%, followed by C. gerhti with ca. 10%, whereas all the remaining 

species showed lower abundances of around 5%. From ca. 2,500 until 1,700 cal. years B.P., 

B. ordinaria increased and reached a peak of almost 25%, B. striatula oscillated significantly, 

N. fabum showed an increasing trend, whereas B. marginata and C. minuta slightly decreased. 

From ca. 1,700 until close to 600 cal. years B.P., E. exigua was the only decreasing species, 

whilst the others generally increased, in particular B. striatula, C. gerthi and B. marginata.   



98 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

- The period between ca. 600 cal. years B.P. and the top of the sequence (Cluster II14) 

continued to present the same general tendencies, but witnessed an important decrease of C. 

gerhti and conversely an increase of E. exigua and B. marginata. From ca. 600 until 200 cal. 

years B.P., C. gerthi decreased to less than 5% and B. marginata and C. minuta increased to 

ca. 10%. From 200 cal. years B.P. until the present, C. laevigata dropped to about 10%, E. 

exigua, B. striatula and C. gerthi increased, whilst the opposite trend was observed for B. 

marginata and C. minuta. 

 
V.1.4.2. R-mode clustering 

The R-mode cluster analysis performed on the three cores (Fig. V.12) was intended to 

evaluate the differences and similarities amongst the evolutionary trends of each individual 

species along time, thus allowing the identification of different clusters (groups) of species in 

each core.  

 

Figure V.12 – Foraminiferal groups produced by R-mode cluster analyses (Ward’s Method) and dendrogram classification 
based on a total of 21 benthic foraminiferal species with relative abundance &gt;5% in at least one sample of the three 
vibrocores: a) vibrocore 1; b) vibrocore 6; c) vibrocore 14. Clusters A-C correspond to the main groups of species in each 
core and the dashed line marks the distance that individualized the different groups.  
 

Three main groups were established in vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.12a), two main groups in 

vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.12b), and two main groups in vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.12c). The cophenetic 

correlation obtained for the clustering of the three vibrocores were very high, showing the 

strong inter-relation between the distribution trends of the different species (Fig. V.12). 

Correlation values were ca. 0.86 for vibrocore 1 (Fig. V. 12a), 0.97 for vibrocore 6 (Fig. 12b) 

and 0.87 for vibrocore 14 (Fig. 12c).

V.1.4.3. Comparison of R-mode and Q-mode clustering: Biofacies 

Comparing the results of Q-mode clustering (Figs. V.9, V.10 and V.11) with the 

information obtained from the R-mode clustering (Fig. V.12), it was possible to establish the 

main trends of the species distributional patterns along time and in relation to each other (Fig. 

V.13). As such, the Q-mode clusters determined along each sequence will be further on 

designated as ‘Biofacies’ (Fig. V.13), as they correspond to different benthic environments 

inhabited by typical groups of species and thus have specific ecological meaning. 

Dominant species B. dilatata, C. laevigata and B. ordinaria were grouped together in the 

same R-mode cluster of vibrocores 1 and 14 (Groups A1 and A14) (Figs. V.12a, c and V.13a, 

c). In vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.12b and V.13b) B. ordinaria exhibited a specific distributional 

pattern, usually dominating the benthic community (Fig. V.13b). Asterigerinata mamilla was 

the other important species in vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.13b), co-dominating the benthic community 

with B. ordinaria until ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. (Fig. V.13b).

blanked bands in vibrocores 1 and 6 correspond to the levels where no data was obtained due to insufficient specimens for 
counting. 
 

In vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.13a), Biofacies I1 characterized the benthic community from ca. 

15,300 until 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. and was dominated by species belonging to Groups 

A1 and B1. However, during this period, the proportions of these species varied. Until ca. 



100 
Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

10,600 cal. years B.P., Group B1 was dominant, with A. mamilla being the most abundant 

species until ca. 12,600-12,500 cal. years B.P. and C. gerthi from this date until close to 

10,600 cal. years B.P. Until ca. 12,600-12,500 cal. years B.P., species B. pseudoplicata, B. 

elongata, G. praegeri, T. carinata, S. fusiformis and N. stella of Group C1 were also present 

but in very small abundances. From ca. 10,600 until 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P., Biofacies I1 

was dominated by Group B1, with B. ordinaria as the most abundant species and B. dilatata 

and C. laevigata significantly increasing in abundance upwards. Biofacies II1 characterized 

the record from ca. 8,000-7,800 cal. years B.P. until today, being dominated by species B. 

ordinaria, B. dilatata and C. laevigata of Group A1, together with an increasing contribution 

of species E. exigua, H. balthica, C. minuta, B. marginata and B. striatula of Group C1 that 

became particularly significant after ca. 3,000-2,000 cal. years B.P. 

In vibrocore 6 (Fig. V.13b), Biofacies I6 characterized the benthic faunas from ca. 12,500 

until 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P., with B. ordinaria dominating the community and A. 

mamilla co-dominating until ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P., after which its abundance gradually 

decreased until almost disappearance close to ca. 3,000-2,800 cal. years B.P. Species N. 

fabum, A. beccarii, R. phlegeri, C. minuta, B. elongata and B. pseudoplicata of Group A6 

were also present throughout this biofacies, whilst species of Group B6 became more 

important after ca. 9,200 cal. years B.P. Biofacies II6 characterized the record after ca. 3,000-

2,800 cal. years B.P. until present-day, being dominated by B. ordinaria and characterized by 

species E. exigua, V. bradyana, B. marginata and B. aculeata of Group A6 that became more 

representative. The remaining species of Groups A6 and species of Group B6 persistently 

showed identical contributions. 

In vibrocore 14 (Fig. V.13c), species of Group A14 were persistently dominant (B. 

dilatata slightly more abundant), and the two Biofacies I14 and II14 were determined on basis 

of different contributions of the species belonging to Group B14. Biofacies I14 dominated the 

record from ca. 2,500 until 600 cal. years B.P. and was characterized by higher abundances of 

B. striatula, N. fabum and C. gerthi. After ca. 600 cal. years B.P. until present-day, Biofacies 

II14 was marked by an abundance decrease of these species in favour of more abundant B. 

marginata. 

 

V.2. Discussion 

The multi-proxy study conducted in the sedimentary sequences of the Guadiana mud body, 

based on their main sedimentological and benthic foraminiferal features, unravelled a

Chapter V. Middle shelf mud body 

succession of different depositional environments for the period spanning from ca. 15,300 cal. 

years B.P. (late Pleistocene) and throughout the Holocene, until close to present-day. 

Furthermore, the full correspondence of the last ca. 2,500 with the entire record of vibrocore 

14, coupled with the higher resolution of the sedimentary record of vibrocores 1 and 6 

attained for this time interval, enabled a more detailed interpretation of recent climatic events 

and its direct comparison with Historical information concerning the anthropogenic forcing. 

V.2.1. Depositional environments 

Based on the features and trends of the key-proxies, four main depositional stages were 

identified for the evolution of this mid-shelf area (Figs. V.14, V.15 and V.16). The first main 

depositional stage (Stage 1), from ca. 15,300 until 12,500-12,000 cal. years B.P., elapsed 

during the late Pleistocene and was registered only in vibrocore 1 (Fig. V.14). The following 

main depositional stage (Stage 2) lasted from ca. 12,500-12,000 until 8,000 cal. years B.P., 

including a part of the Younger Dryas (ca. 12,900-11,700 cal. years B.P.) and the early phases 

of the Holocene (onset at ca. 11,700 cal. years B.P.), whilst Stage 3 covered mainly the mid- 

to late-Holocene, spanning from ca. 8,000 until 3,000-2,500 cal. years B.P., both stages being 

registered in vibrocores 1 and 6 (Figs. V.14 and V.15). Finally, the most recent depositional 

stage (Stage 4) corresponded to the late Holocene, covering the last ca. 2,500 years, and was 

registered in the three cores (Figs. V.14, V.15 and V.16). 

Stage 1: from ca. 15,300 until 12,500-12,200 cal. years B.P. 

The first stage was characterized at the site of vibrocore 1 by apparent moderately high 

sedimentation rates that ranged from ca. 80 to nearly 50 cm/ka (Fig. V.5a). Sediments were 

usually a combination of dominant silt with important but variable contents of sand and a 

significant clay input, plus a very reduced and intermittent contribution of gravel (Figs. V.6a 

and V.14). Within sand, quartz was generally the most abundant compound (Figs. V.7a-b and 

V.14). Other terrigenous particles (OT) were almost as abundant as quartz, and mica was also 

of some significance, whereas the biogenic compound consisted almost exclusively of 

mollusc shells (Figs. V.7a and V.14). In what concerns the benthic foraminiferal community, 

the most evident feature were the very low faunistical densities (FD) that persisted throughout 

this period (Figs. V.9 and V.14). The diversity index Hs was slightly higher and seemed to 

exhibit important fluctuations (Figs. V.9 and V.14). This phase was dominated by Biofacies 

I1 (Figs. V.13a and V.14).

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL EVOLUTION OF THE

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE MUD BODY 
  



154 
Chapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf 

and reconstruction of the mud body 

The multi-proxy study performed in the sedimentary sequences of the Guadiana inner shelf 

and mid-shelf mud body allowed an integrated interpretation of the main depositional and 

environmental events taken place during the last ca 15,300 cal. years B.P., from late 

Pleistocene and throughout the Holocene until close to present-day. The post-glacial 

transgression that was initiated after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was recorded at both 

shelf domains by a generalized fining-up tendency of sediments (transgressive sequence) and 

on the middle shelf by a succession of different benthic foraminiferal faunas. Here, this 

process eventually led to the establishment of the fine to very fine deposits that constitute the 

Guadiana mud body. They functioned as a crucial marine archive of the climatic and recent 

anthropogenic impacts on the natural systems of the region, and its evolutionary history will 

now be further analysed in the present chapter. 

As was already discussed in the previous chapters, the Guadiana River is the main regional 

source for the sediments that are deposited on the adjacent continental shelf (González et al., 

2004). The estuarine system plays a crucial role in the type and amount of the sedimentary 

material that is transferred from the river to the coastal ocean and episodic flood events have 

been found to be the main mechanism for sediment discharge (fine- and coarse-grained) from 

the river basin onto the shelf (González et al., 2004; Portela, 2004; González et al., 2007). 

The sediment supply from the basin is however clearly dominated by suspended load 

relative to bed load material (Morales, 1997). Apparently, the estuary retains only a minor 

share (about 10%) of the total amount of fine-grained sediments produced in the drainage 

basin, the rest being transported onto the shelf as part of plumes of riverborne suspended 

material that initially deposits at the inner shelf domain (Portela, 2004) (Fig. VI.1). Re-

suspension and remobilization processes occurring at this energetic area of the shelf are 

afterwards responsible for the redistribution of the fine sediments onto the deeper and less 

hydrodynamic setting of the middle shelf, where they eventually accumulate (e.g., González 

et al., 2004 and 2007). The same mechanism of initial deposition of fluvially-supplied fine 

material on shallower shelf areas, followed by post-remobilization and transport onto deeper 

middle shelf areas where they eventually settle, has been identified in several other 

continental margins (e.g., Lesueur et al., 1996; Jouanneau et al., 1998, Dias et al., 2002a; 

Edwards, 2002; Roussiez et al., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2007).

Figure VI.1 – General simulation of modern fine 
(cohesive) sediment deposition (m year-1) in the Guadiana 
lower estuary and on the adjacent inner shelf (adapted 
from Portela, 2004). 

 

At a long-term scale, such process is believed to have generated the fine-grained deposits 

that cover an important area of the shelf adjacent to the Guadiana Estuary Mouth (e.g., Nelson 

et al., 1999; González et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2005). These deposits are part of the extensive 

highstand prograding mud facies that covers mid-shelf depths throughout the Gulf of Cadiz 

Margin (Gutiérrez-Mas et al., 1996; Rodero et al., 1999), formed when the Holocene sea-

level rise resulted in maximum water depth over the Gibraltar sill and in the full development 

of the Atlantic inflow and Mediterranean outflow currents (Nelson et al., 1999).  

Our record from the Guadiana mud body showed though that significant deposition of fine 

material started as early as the late Pleistocene, during earlier stages of the Flandrian 

transgression (Fig. VI.2a), when over 60% of silt-dominated muds mixed with sand 

accumulated at the deeper and more distal site of vibrocore 1, around 15,000 cal. years B.P. 

(Figs. V.4a and V.6a). This tendency persisted throughout the final stages of the Pleistocene 

sea-level rise (Fig. VI.2b), and close to the beginning of the Holocene, around 12,000 cal. 

years B.P., mud deposition had already increased up to ca. 80% of total sediments at this site, 

with similar values also being observed for the same period in the shallower mid-shelf 

vibrocore 6 (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d).

Chapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf 

and reconstruction of the mud body 

When comparing these results with information obtained for shelf mud deposits in other 

areas of the Iberian Margin, namely the important Galicia Mud Belt, on NW Iberia, it is clear 

that the evolution of the Guadiana mud body followed a somewhat different pattern. Just as is 

verified for the latter, the fine-grained deposits of the Galicia Mud Belt are originated from 

regional fluvial input, mainly the discharges of the Douro River (Araújo et al., 2002; Portela, 

2008), storing ca. 70% of the total detritical fluxes that are transferred from the continent to 

the shelf (Jouanneau et al., 2002). They first settle on the inner shelf but post-remobilization 

caused essentially by winter wave and storm action transports a major part offshore onto the 

deeper middle shelf, which becomes their main depositional site (Dias et al., 2002a and 

2002b). Studies focusing on the evolution of the Galicia Mud Belt have however pointed out 

that the first onset of major mud deposition in the area was forced by the last phases of the 

postglacial transgression and subsequent sea-level near stabilization (Drago et al., 1999; 

Lantzsch et al., 2009a, 2009b and 2010). The flooding of the Douro Estuary during the late 

Pleistocene to early Holocene sea-level rise led first to accumulation of fine sediments inside 

the river valley, whereas the posterior export of terrigenous material to the shelf was initiated 

only during the Holocene, between ca. 8,370 and 5,249 cal. years B.P. (Lantzsch et al., 

2009a). It was caused by a shift in the balance between the rate of sea-level rise and the 

amount of fluvial sediment supply, which provided the prerequisite for initiation and further 

expansion of the mid-shelf mud depocentre, when a transition occurred from pure fine sands 

towards mud contents of more than 25% (Lantzsch et al., 2009a). This contrasts with the 

record of the Guadiana mud body sequences that, although showing an identical fining-up 

trend forced by postglacial sea-level rise and drowning of the shelf, revealed a much higher 

content of mud even since before the Holocene times (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d). Although the 

Guadiana Estuary was also retaining a significant part of the fluvial sediment-load in the 

course of its estuarine infilling during the early Holocene sea-level rise (Boski et al., 2002 and 

2008), the transfer of sediments seems to have always been significant enough to allow the 

deposition of fine material on the shelf, even at shallower depths than those characterizing the 

modern sites of the studied sequences.  

It is likely that differences in the regional climate and associated fluvial runoff of the major 

rivers supplying both mud depocentres, in the nature of source rocks along the two river 

basins, as well as on the hydrodynamic regime that characterizes each of the shelf systems, 

have all contributed to such diverse evolutional trends of the mud depocentres, and to what 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

157 
Chapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf 

and reconstruction of the mud body 

appears to be the specific case of the Guadiana deposits, characterized by a stronger 

predominance of fine sediments at a much earlier stage. 

Variations in the lithology of the continental bedrock sources have strong effects on the 

sediment composition and grain-size distribution patterns of shelf deposits (e.g., Monteiro et 

al., 1982; Dias and Nittrouer, 1984; Paiva et al., 1997; Alves et al., 2003; Machado et al., 

2005; Mil-Homens et al., 2006). The outcropping formations along the Douro River Basin, 

mainly consisting of plutonic and granitoid rocks, contribute with high amounts of coarser 

material to the drainage system, as attested by the volumes of sand that reach and bypass the 

Douro Estuary Mouth (Portela, 2008). Conversely, the weathering of the metamorphic schist 

and greywacke formations that dominate extensive areas of the Guadiana Basin contributes to 

the much more significant quantities of fine, rather than coarse, material which constitutes the 

sediment-load transported by the fluvial system (Morales, 1997; González et al., 2004; 

Portela, 2004; González et al., 2007). Additionally, the influence of fluvial input and of 

regional coastal/shelf hydrodynamism has already been indicated as a major factor in 

controlling the textural composition of shelf sediments along the Portuguese Margin (e.g., 

Martins et al., 2012). Precipitation and topography have a strong impact on river flow and 

discharge rates, with rainfall being much heavier in the highlands of northern Iberia than in 

the low lying areas of the southern part of the Peninsula (e.g., Martins et al., 2012). In part 

this probably also explains the coarser nature of riverborne sediments reaching the 

northwestern shelf, as the transport-capacity of the Douro River is therefore much higher. In 

what concerns shelf hydrodynamics, whereas the northwestern margin is characterized by 

high energetic conditions which difficult the setting of muds and allows their re-suspension 

(e.g., Lantzsch et al., 2009a; Martins et al., 2012), the southern shelf corresponds to a low 

energy environment that favours the accumulation of the fluvially-derived fine sediments 

(e.g., González et al., 2007; Martins et al., 2012).  

By the time of the early Holocene and after the last global major pulse of sea-level rise 

MWP 1B, significant fine sedimentation continued to occur at the two mid-shelf sites in front 

of the Guadiana River, and coarse-grained deposits, possibly related with an ancient delta of 

the Guadiana, started to accumulate at the much shallower site of vibrocore 20 (Fig. VI.2b). 

The high amounts of mud mixed with an important contribution of terrigenous sand material 

(of ca. 20%) persisted on the mid-shelf deposits throughout most of the Holocene (Figs. V.4a-

b and V.6a-d), whereas on the inner shelf the record of vibrocore 20 showed that coarser 

terrigenous sediments dominated deposition closer to the river mouth during all this time. No

major changes in terms of fine deposition were observed on the mid-shelf sites during this 

extended period (Figs. V.4a-b and V.6a-d), not even after sea-level near stabilization at ca. 

5,000 cal. years B.P., which seems to indicate that the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary did 

not cause immediate impact on the adjacent middle shelf domain. A significant change was 

observed though on the inner shelf record, with sediments becoming less coarse, as gravel 

was reduced and sand became the main sediment type particularly after the sea level was 

almost stabilized (Fig. IV.4a).

and reconstruction of the mud body 

Both inner and middle shelf sequences also evidenced an apparent lower rate of sediment 

supply during this period, again even after the sea level had approached its present day 

position around mid-Holocene, and the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary was practically 

complete (Boski et al., 2002 and 2008). It was considered as a possible explanation that 

climate forcing, namely enhanced dryness across the Mediterranean Basin and southern 

Europe (e.g., Jalut et al., 2000; Fletcher et al., 2007; Fletcher and Goñi, 2008; Magny et al., 

2009; Carrión et al., 2010a; Fletcher et al., 2012), could have contributed to reduced river 

flows and consequently to a lessen capacity of sediment-transfer of the Guadiana River. Such 

a climate scenario would refrain sediment export onto the shelf, specially because soils would 

still be protected from erosional processes by the well developed vegetation cover that had 

previously expanded in the Guadiana Basin under the early Holocene moisture conditions 

(e.g., Fletcher et al., 2007), even though the bypass of fluvially-supplied sediments was 

probably favoured by the progressively more stable sea levels and decreased retention of 

sediments inside the estuary. At the same time, after the maximum flooding of the Guadiana 

Estuary (Morales, 1997; Boski et al., 2002), the prograding phase of the river mouth was put 

in motion (Morales, 1997; Lobo et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2006) and probably started to 

retain a part of the fluvial-supplied sediments for deltaic construction. This means that the 

supply mechanisms surpassed the distributional processes, which is consistent with the low-

energy characteristics of the Guadiana margin, and particularly in comparison with the Douro 

Estuary case where the higher energetic levels prevented the development of such 

depositional system associated with the river mouth. 

By late Holocene, around 2,000 cal. years B.P., the shelf depositional environment 

witnessed major changes. At the most distal and deeper site of vibrocore 1, fine sedimentation 

was enhanced to more than 90% (Figs. V.4a and V.6a) and apparently much higher amounts 

of sediments started to reach the area (Fig. V.14), the same being verified for the inner shelf 

(Fig. IV.7). At the same time, fine sediments started to accumulate at the deep site of 

vibrocore 14 (Figs. V.4c and V.6e), which seemed to translate the onset of mud deposition in 

this area, westward deviated from the Guadiana River Mouth. It is thus clear that important 

transformations related with the sediment sources were by then taking place, namely along the 

Guadiana Basin, increasing significantly both the sediment-load of the river and its transport-

capacity. The timing of these changes matches well with one of the most crucial historical 

periods of recent times, the expansion of the Roman Empire. Throughout most of Europe and 

in particular across the Mediterranean Basin, the Roman rule was responsible for massive

human development and consequent major impacts on the natural systems, including in 

southern Iberia and along the Guadiana Basin (e.g., Alarcão, 1987; Alarcão, 1990; Fabião, 

1993). Many palaeoenvironmental studies have already unravelled the effects that land-use 

activities such as intensive agricultural practices, mining exploitation and the constructions of 

dams have had in soil erosion and sedimentations patterns, both in continental and in marine 

systems, during the Roman Period (e.g., Zielhofer et al., 2002; Désprat et al., 2003; Faust et 

al., 2004; Mighall et al., 2006; Carrión et al., 2007; Casana, 2008; Gil-Romera et al., 2010; 

Anderson et al., 2011; Kaal et al., 2011; Delgado et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been 

proposed that this period also corresponded to a time of enhanced humidity across the 

Mediterranean, amplifying the human-induced erosional processes (e.g., Désprat et al., 2003; 

Thorndycraft and Benito, 2006; Bernárdez et al., 2008; Casana, 2008; Martín-Puertas et al., 

2009; Mohamed et al., 2010; Dermody et al., 2012; Corella et al., 2013). As such, it is likely 

that the changes detected in the shelf depositional patterns at this time, with enhanced 

sediment-supply and higher amounts of fine-grained material reaching the mid-shelf, were 

mainly driven by human forcing but further enhanced by a climate shift towards more 

humidity and higher river-runoff. It determined an even more pronounced fining-up trend 

within the mud body depocentre and the onset of mud deposition in a location deviated from 

the main sediment-pathway of the Guadiana Mouth, marking a clear expansion of the mud 

body beyond its depocentre, as had been previously observed (Rosa et al., 2011), and clearly 

setting new conditions on the shelf (Fig. VI.2c). A very similar process of mud-enhancement 

on the shelf domain due to the coupling of climatic changes and strong human impact during 

Roman times has also been recognized on the Northern Aquitaine shelf (Lesueur et al., 1996; 

2001 and 2002). Major changes on erosional processes along the catchment areas of the 

Gironde and Loire rivers, the main regional sediment-suppliers to the shelf, were detected 

since ca. 2,000 cal. years B.P. and modified drastically the shelf depositional patterns by 

introducing large amounts of fine-grained material onto the system, which led to the final 

establishment and expansion of the Gironde and ‘La Grande Vasière’ mud fields on the 

middle shelf. 

After ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., another high input of fine material started to reach the shelf, 

determining almost fully mud deposition at the mud body sites of vibrocores 6 and 14 (Figs. 

V.4a, V.4c, V.6c and V.6e), as well as the preservation of important mud layers at the inner 

shelf site (Figs. IV.2 and IV.4a). Again, anthropogenic causes seemed to be behind this 

evolutionary trend, as it was contemporaneous with another phase of notable human 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

161 
Chapter VI. Paleoenvironmental evolution of the Guadiana Continental Shelf 

and reconstruction of the mud body 

development in southern Iberia, the Islamic Medieval Period (e.g., Ribeiro, 1987). During the 

Muslim rule, and particularly after the 8th century A.D. (ca. 1,350 cal. years B.P.), there was 

an unprecedent population growth (e.g., Oliveira Marques, 1993; Boone and Worman, 2007) 

and the exceptional conditions of the region for agriculture were largely maximized (e.g., 

Devy-Vareta, 1985; Ribeiro, 1987; Magalhães, 2002; Gamito, 2007; Borges Coelho, 2008). 

This eventually had consequences on erosion, which is likely to have become more severe, 

leading to enhanced sediment-load being transported by the river and transferred onto the 

shelf. Furthermore, the evolution of the Guadiana River Mouth itself, including the narrowing 

of its eastern margin tidal inlets (Morales, 1997), was most certainly further contributing for 

the observed patterns of deposition on the shelf and within the mud body. As was already 

discussed in the previous chapter, the intensification of erosion processes due to human land-

use was probably one of the main reasons that led to the silting-up of the Guadiana eastern 

distributary. Consequently, there was a reinforcement of the western distributary and a 

continuous deviation of most of the river sediment-load towards what is today the main 

channel of the estuary, which became the chief transfer-pathway between the estuarine system 

and the shelf, discharging directly onto the area where the cores were located. This was 

probably the main mechanism that changed once more the depositional patterns in the mid-

shelf, and contributed to the full establishment of the mud body deposits at their present-day 

position (Fig. VI.2c). It is interesting to notice that identical evolutional trends were again 

unravelled for the Northern Aquitaine shelf (Lesueur et al., 1996; 2001 and 2002), where 

significant morphological changes of the Gironde River Mouth partially driven by the 

influence of human activity were responsible for controlling the further increase of supply of 

suspended sediment to the shelf after ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P. These authors concluded that 

the bulk of the mud accumulated on the Aquitaine mid-shelf over the last two millennia and 

an important part of the fine-grained sedimentation has occurred since Medieval Age, with the 

Gironde shelf mud fields corresponding to the final phase of a highstand deposit sequence. 

The fine deposits today forming the Guadiana mud body can thus be interpreted in terms of 

their genesis and general configuration according to the schematic model proposed by 

Lantzsch et al. (2009a) (Fig. VI.3), as belonging to type 2a.

features.  White arrows indicate sediment input and transport, grey arrows the strength of the hydrodynamic regime on the

In general terms, their formation has been mainly controlled by the moderate sediment 

supplies of the Guadiana River and the hydrodynamic regime across the shelf, which 

determines re-suspension of the fine sediments from the more energetic coastal and inner 

shelf domain, and its transport offshore where they eventually settle and accumulate at the 

less hydrodynamic environment of the middle shelf, detached from their main sediment 

source (Fig. VI.3). 

On the mid-shelf these deposits have formed the Guadiana mud body, which constitutes an 

important regional fine-grained deposit that started to build-up as early as the late Pleistocene 

sea-level rise. However, it only developed into an almost fully mud deposit during the last 

phases of the Holocene highstand, forced by the conjoint action of recent climatic events and 

the intensive human occupation of the region that has transformed irreversibly the Guadiana 

Basin landscapes since Roman and Islamic times, until present-day.

Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

Main findings: depositional stages and shelf evolution 

The multi-proxy sedimentological and micropaleontological study conducted in the four 

sequences retrieved from the Guadiana inner- to mid-shelf unravelled a succession of 

different depositional environments for the period spanning from late Pleistocene (for the 

record of the middle shelf mud body) and from early Holocene (for the record of the inner 

shelf), until close to present-day. These paleoenvironments were established across the shelf 

as a response to global and regional forcing mechanisms, namely climate change, the 

postglacial sea-level rise and the more recent impact of human development. Their 

reconstruction allowed to rebuild the evolutionary history of the Guadiana region throughout 

the analysed period, and to assess the role of the interplay between climatic and 

anthropogenic forces in shaping the natural systems. Furthermore, the insight on the evolution 

of the Guadiana mid-shelf mud body as a specific depositional and ecological domain is 

presented in detail for the first time and enabled a higher-resolution interpretation of the 

events occurred at a millennial- to centennial-scale, including those that took place during 

Historical times. 

On the inner shelf location of vibrocore 20, four main depositional stages were identified 

throughout the last ca. 9,200 years, evolving from a proximal setting that was probably part of 

the submerged deltaic system associated with the Guadiana River mouth into a shallow inner 

shelf domain. On the mid-shelf mud body, four depositional stages were recognized since the 

late Pleistocene from ca. 15,300 cal. years B.P. The different ages obtained for the three 

analysed sequences implied that the four depositional stages could only be identified in the 

older record of vibrocore 1, whereas the younger vibrocores 6 and 14 did not register all 

stages. The deeper vibrocore 1 and the shallower vibrocore 6, both located in front of the 

Guadiana River mouth and on the modern depocentre of the mud body, evolved from a 

shallow inner shelf setting towards a mud-dominated middle shelf environment, following a 

diachronic process due to their differences in water depth. The site of vibrocore 14, situated at 

an intermediate depth between vibrocores 1 and 6 but deviated to the west of the main 

sediment source, the Guadiana River, registered only the last ca. 2,000 years and translated 

the more recent expansion of the mud body towards other areas outside its depocentre. All 

shelf sequences revealed a clear fining-up trend of sediments, corresponding to a 

transgressive record associated with the global postglacial rise of the mean sea level, which 

was almost fully stabilized in the region around 5,500 cal. years B.P.

165 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

Mud body first depositional stage 

The oldest sediments correspond to the mud body first depositional stage (ca. 15,300 to 

12,500-12,200 cal. years B.P.) and constitute transgressive deposits registered only at the 

more distal site (vibrocore 1) in a context of lowstand, but already forced by fast sea-level 

rising. Deposition occurred in a much shallower environment than today, probably in a 

proximal, more energetic, inner shelf domain standing at ca. 10-15 m below water depth. 

Sediments corresponded to a combination of dominant silt with alternating amounts of clay 

and sand that translate pulses of sea-level rise at different rates, together with significant 

continental-derived terrigenous material that reflected the proximity to the Guadiana bed-load 

discharges. The benthic foraminiferal species clearly confirmed this environmental scenario. 

They were dominated by typical coastal taxa, such as Asterigerinata mamilla, Cribrononion 

gerthi, Gavelinopsis praegeri and Bulimina elongata, whereas the very low faunistical 

densities pointed to some degree of ecological instability due to the higher impact of coastal 

currents and fast changing conditions arising from the fast sea-level rise. By the time of the 

Younger Dryas (ca. 12,900-11,700 cal. years B.P.), the sea had already rise several meters 

and the site of vibrocore 1 would have been in a deeper marine setting (ca. 30-50 m water 

depth), approximately in the transition from the inner to the middle shelf. 

Second mud body and first inner shelf depositional stages 

The second depositional stage registered on the mud body, from ca. 12,500-12,200 until 

8,000 cal. years B.P., corresponds to the final part of the Younger Dryas (YD) and to the early 

Holocene, and was recorded at the two mid-shelf sites of vibrocores 1 and 6. At the beginning 

of this stage, the sea had already drowned a significant part of the shelf, placing the location 

of vibrocore 1 probably at ca. 60 m water depth and of vibrocore 6 around 10 m water depth. 

With the mean sea level continuing to rise and accelerating at the beginning of the Holocene, 

there was a further deepening of the shelf environments during this time. This acceleration 

was probably the cause for the apparently low sedimentation rates registered at both sites, as it 

continued to promote the Guadiana Estuary fast infilling and retention of fluvial sediments. 

The two locations evidenced evolutionary trends that translate their further transition into 

deeper conditions, characterized by the continuous deposition of high amounts of fine 

material that corresponded to the setting of the mud body on the middle shelf. However, they 

exhibited different sedimentary and ecological features that are consistent with their location 

at different water depths and distance to the river mouth, with the site of vibrocore 1 reaching 

near 75-85 m water depth and vibrocore 6 around 25-35 m water depth. The most evident 



166 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

changes were observed within the benthic foraminiferal communities, as the species typical of 

more energetic shallow environments still dominated the site of vibrocore 6, but were 

gradually replaced in the deeper site of vibrocore 1 by opportunistic species with preference 

for finer sediments and lower energetic conditions, namely Bolivina ordinaria, Cassidulina 

laevigata and Brizalina dilatata. 

During this time-interval, the first depositional stage of the inner shelf was identified 

between ca. 9,200 and 8,500-8,200 cal. years B.P. The sand and gravel composition of 

sediments, together with the morphoscopy and shape of sandy quartz, revealed a strong 

signature of the Guadiana direct bed-load input with the significant presence of fluvially-

derived feldspars and Paleozoic schists/greywacke, and poorly reworked quartz grains, which 

today can only be found in the proximal area of the river mouth. By early Holocene, this site 

would stand in a shallower and more proximal environment that was probably part of the 

submerged detritic delta just off the river mouth. 

Third mud body, second and third inner shelf depositional stages 

The first phase of the mud body third depositional stage (ca. 8,000 to 6,000-5,800 cal. 

years B.P.) correspond to the time when the sea was evolving to near stabilization, at around 

5,500 cal. years B.P. Both mid-shelf sites were approaching water depths similar to the 

present ones, already in a fully marine shelf environment, and this process was again better 

evidenced by the benthic foraminiferal faunas. Although revealing quite diverse trends at each 

site as a differentiated bathymetric response to evolving water depths and distance to the river 

mouth, the increased faunistical densities and rather constant diversity values highlight the 

establishment of more stable ecological conditions in a eutrophic deeper environment, 

continuously favoured by the high influx of fluvially-supplied nutrients. On the other hand, 

the Guadiana Estuary was by then reaching an advanced state of infilling but no increased 

sediment bypass towards this area seems to have occurred, the same being detected for the 

inner shelf site. Here, the evolutional patterns during this time-interval, which corresponds to 

its second depositional stage, also revealed the crucial influence of the Holocene sea-level 

rise. Until close to 5,800 cal. years B.P., the environment gradually shifted from a 

transitional/coastal setting to a clear inner shelf domain, as is attested by the increase of 

marine-derived biogenic compounds and of better reworked (blunt-shining) quartz, and by the 

decrease of the fluvial-originated bed-load compounds. These were used as proxies for 

increased water depth and distance to the river mouth, which led to an enhancement of marine 

processes in the area over the continental-derived imprint. Moreover, they seem to attest for 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

167 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

the existence of a warmer and moisture climate, which had been previously identified in the 

region during early Holocene times and that offered soil protection to erosion due to 

vegetation cover expansion along the Guadiana Basin, thus contributing to reduce sediment-

input from the river to the shelf. 

During the second phase of the middle shelf third depositional stage, until ca. 2,500-2,000 

cal. years B.P., the sedimentological patterns remained very similar but with a persistent 

sediment fining-up trend, which further evidenced the growing stability of this mid-shelf area 

under the continuous influence of the Guadiana suspended-load supplies. However, a shift in 

the benthic foraminiferal communities of vibrocore 1 seemed to indicate less changeable 

ecological conditions, as there was a decrease of the highly opportunistic C. laevigata and B. 

dilatata in favour of other species, like Hyalinea balthica, Bulimina marginata and Bolivina 

striatula. These are also related to fine-grained bottom-sediments, in intermediate to deep 

environments with high primary productivity, and usually occupy the same ecological niches 

as C. laevigata and B. dilatata, but do not exhibit the same opportunistic behaviour. Such 

trend was interpreted as the response to a decreasing impact of more direct and excessive 

nutrient supplies from the river that resulted from a combination of two major forcing factors, 

namely the post-transgression evolution of the Guadiana Estuary mouth and changes in 

regional climate towards increased aridity. Consistently, on the inner shelf location, the third 

depositional stage that lasted from ca. 5,800 until around 2,000 cal. years B.P. witnessed a 

further increase of the marine signature of the deposits, coupled with indicators of continuous, 

but reduced, river sediment-supply, despite the almost completion of the Guadiana Estuary 

infilling that was expected to have reversed such trend. This was attributed to the combined 

action of the two previously mentioned main factors. The prograding processes occurring on 

both margins of the estuary and the construction of the fluvial deltaic system led to sediment 

imprisonment on the terminal part of the estuary, whereas the increased aridity that is 

recognized for the Guadiana River Valley during this period, although also impacting on the 

vegetation cover and soil erosion rates, must have reduced river-activity. Together, both 

mechanisms seem to have been responsible for a diminished fluvial input of sediments and 

nutrients onto the adjacent shelf.  

Fourth mud body and inner shelf depositional stages 

The onset of the fourth depositional stage took place at around the same approximate dates 

on the inner and middle shelf, at around 2,000 cal. years B.P., and was marked by much 

enhanced sediment supply onto both shelf areas. 



168 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

On the middle shelf sequences of vibrocores 1 and 6, it corresponded mainly to fine-

grained material, accompanied by important changes in the sand fraction compounds. Also, 

the increase of specific benthic foraminiferal species and the appearance of other, namely 

Bulimina aculeata, B. marginata, H. balthica, Rectuvigerina phlegeri, B. striatula and, in 

particular, Epistominella exigua, represented a definitive turn-over of the ecological niches 

within the mud body. At the same time, high amounts of fine sediments started to accumulate 

at the site of vibrocore 14, initiating the mud body record in this location of the middle shelf. 

On the inner shelf, the increased amount of sediments reaching the site was also followed by 

the first major deposition of muds at ca. 1,000 cal. years B.P., generating a record of 

alternating sand-dominated and fine-dominated deposits that were interpreted as phases of 

dryer climate and reduced floods, and phases of wetter climate and enhanced flood-events, 

respectively. 

The onset of these changes was probably the consequence of the first major impact of 

anthropogenic activities along the Guadiana River Basin, related with the Roman occupation 

of Iberia and a possible wetter phase in the region. The strong human-forced soil erosion due 

to new agricultural practices and widespread wood exploitation for construction, domestic use 

and mining activities, eventually associated with higher precipitation and river runoff, 

increased sediment load and seemed to have caused major modifications on the shelf 

depositional environment, leading also to the final phase of fining-trend in the mid-shelf mud 

deposits. Furthermore, the coupled human-climate forcing upon the river export capacity 

probably enhanced progradation at the estuary mouth, leading to the silting-up process of an 

ancient eastern distributary of the estuary, and the reinforcement of the western main 

estuarine channel that discharges directly onto this area of the shelf. After ca. 1,500 cal. years 

B.P., a higher impact of bed-load fluvial discharges was regarded as an even stronger human 

impact in the landscape of the Guadiana region, associated with the Islamic Rule of southern 

Iberia. The further human-induced increase of the river sediment-load might have also been 

the main cause for the definitive colmatation of the Guadiana eastern distributary, and final 

reinforcement of the transfer-capacity of the main western channel. This time-interval, until 

ca. 800 cal. years B.P., has been identified as a more severe dry period in southern Europe, 

largely forced by the effects of the atmospheric NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) system and 

specifically by a more persistent positive signal of its index, which means river-activity must 

have been reduced. However, on the inner shelf, the occurrence of an initial wetter phase was 

not recorded, as the absence of flood-like mud deposits until ca. 850 cal. years B.P. seemed to 

suggest a persistent dry climate, or at least that the moisture conditions were not strong 



‘Climatic variability and recent sedimentation in the Continental Shelf off the Guadiana River’ 

 

169 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

enough to generate a significant deposition of fine material in this shallower location, and its 

preservation as flood-layers. 

The general enhanced aridity seems to have persisted until close to ca. 300 cal. years B.P., 

with human impacts during the Middle Ages probably continuing to be the main forcing 

factor behind the persistent high amounts of sediments that reached the shelf, almost fully 

suspended-load in the case of the middle shelf area. Here, this process contributed to the 

further development of the mud body depositional system, and to ecological conditions that 

continued to favour opportunistic benthic foraminiferal species under high nutrient inputs 

from the Guadiana River. On the inner shelf site, there was however a signal for enhanced 

river runoff between ca. 850 and 600 cal. years B.P., translated by the first significant input of 

fine material to the site, mostly silt. It could be a record of higher precipitation and occurrence 

of floods due to a shorter wetter period in the region, perhaps linked to a fluctuation of the 

NAO index towards negative values. Afterwards and until close to 350 cal. years B.P., the 

decline of fines signalizes the reduction of flood-impact events on the inner shelf, in the 

already mentioned context of a dry climate, possibly modulated in part by a phase of more 

persistent NAO-positive values. 

The last ca. 300 years of deposition in the mud body continued to be strongly dominated 

by fluvially-supplied fine sediments and indicated a clear enhancement of the Guadiana River 

runoff, with a specific sedimentological imprint of continental-derived terrigenous that 

reflected an even more intensive coupling of anthropogenic and climate forcing mechanisms. 

Moreover, the accumulation of abundant charcoal particles registered around 100 cal. years 

B.P. that were probably originated in the mining activities along the Guadiana Basin, seem to 

correspond to the depositional imprint on the shelf of major floods that were described for the 

Guadiana River within this time-interval, such as the one recorded in 1876 A.D. New 

ecological niches were also established within the mud body that translate these changes in 

fluvial-supply, with species that profit from very abundant nutrient input clearly increasing, 

such as E. exigua and Valvulineria bradyana, both emerging as characteristic species of this 

period. The long-term human occupation and transformation of the region since as early as ca. 

2,500-2,000 cal. years B.P. was indeed accentuated after the 19th century by strong-impact 

activities such as intensive mining exploitation and agricultural practices, which led to an 

even greater exposure of soils to erosion. Simultaneously, this time corresponds to the most 

pronounced phase of the LIA (Little Ice Age), clearly associated with a persistent negative-

like mode of the NAO index that is the main responsible for increased moisture and winter 

precipitation in SW Iberia. This is in accordance with what was detected for the inner shelf 



170 
Chapter VII. Main findings and conclusions 

during this period, where the last ca. 350 years witnessed a strong return to enhanced fine 

deposition that clearly revealed higher precipitation levels and the establishment of a wetter 

climate in the region.  

Coupled with the stronger human-induced erosion along the river basin, the climate-driven 

increased runoff hence seems to have been the main responsible for the significant 

enhancement of the Guadiana River export capacity of sediments and nutrients from the 

continent to the shelf, and to the new depositional patterns established both on the inner shelf 

and in the mid-shelf mud body. 

 

Final remarks 

The depositional patterns of the inner shelf site throughout the Holocene were closely 

associated with the inputs from the Guadiana River and the geomorphologic evolution of its 

estuarine system, coupled with a strong imprint of the longshore drift supplies. The coarse and 

very coarse terrigenous-dominated material that constitute much of the older deposits until 

close to 3,500 cal. years B.P. revealed the importance of early- to mid-Holocene sea-level 

variations and the retention of sediments inside the Guadiana Estuary during its infilling. 

Superimposed on this fluvial-forced variability, the dominance of well-reworked (spherical, 

rounded and blunt-shinning) quartz within sand attests the continued importance of coastal 

processes at this site throughout time. On the mid-shelf mud body, depositional patterns also 

reveal that the evolution of this area was closely tied to the sediment supplies of the Guadiana 

River, since as early as the late Pleistocene. The impact of the postglacial sea-level rise that 

characterized the early Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene overruled other forcing 

mechanisms during the first depositional stages of the mud body, as it submerged large areas 

of the shelf. Simultaneously, it controlled the infilling of the Guadiana Estuary, with 

consequences for the type and amount of sediments that were transferred from the river basin 

onto the adjacent shelf. After the near stabilization of the mean sea level and with the 

estuarine infilling almost complete around mid-Holocene, sediment retention seems to have 

further continued until late Holocene due the prograding processes that began in the Guadiana 

River Mouth, but other global and regional factors became determinant in the control of 

sediment supply to the shelf system, namely the millennial- to centennial-scale North Atlantic 

climatic oscillations, and the more recent impact of human development in the region. 

Further work needs however to be conducted in order to clarify some issues that require a 

better understanding, namely: the integration of all the data based on the analysis of the cores

with high-resolution seismic profiles to obtain an improved stratigraphical definition on the 

depositional processes occurred on the continental shelf, and to help reconstruct the paleo-

drainage system of the river; detail the temporal framework based on the radiocarbon datings 

with additional dating analyses that would allow a better accuracy on the calculation of the 

sedimentation rates, and specifically for the more recent deposits of the cores, in which the 

radiocarbon method lacks accurateness, such as amino acid racemisation (AAR) or 

radioisotopic measurements of 210Pb; investigate the isotopic record of the shelf deposits to 

determine more accurately oceanographic changes that were linked to variations in climate 

and in primary production, through the analysis of oxygen and carbon stable isotopes; and 

explore the problematic concerning the compaction of sediments along the cores, which 

influences the correct assessment of past sedimentation rates.

TAXONOMY OF BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA 
  



174 
Chapter VIII. Taxonomy of benthic Foraminifera 

VIII.1. Systematic 

The systematic taxonomy of benthic foraminifera from the Guadiana mud body is presented in 

this chapter for all the species that were found with at least two specimens in at least one of all 

the analysed samples (Appendixes A, B and C). 

In the current study, the commonly accepted systematic hierarchy established by Loeblich and 

Tappan (1988) was followed, placing foraminifers in the Order Foraminiferida (Eichwald, 1930). 

Following the 1960’s publications from the same authors, most of systematisits have accordingly 

classified foraminifers as belonging to the Kingdom Protista, more recently also designated as 

Kingdom Protoctista, which englobes eukaryotic unicellular organisms. The taxonomic rank of 

foraminifera was raised from order to class also by Loeblich and Tappan (1992) according to the 

characteristics of the organisms, organized as follows: 1) granuloreticulose pseudopodia; 2) outer 

cover, usually a test; 3) alternation of haploid and diploid generations; 4) the presence of a test 

constructed from non-oriented calcareous or siliceous crystals. 

The classification of the foraminifers’ genera and all their successive higher classes 

(subfamilies, families, superfamilies and suborders) established in the present study was based on 

the work by Loeblich and Tappan (1988), except for the genera Textularia and species Discorbis 

williamsoni that were kept with the original names taken from the Ellis and Messina catalogue of 

Foraminifera (1942-2009). For each identified species, the taxonomic references were organized 

according to the following schematics: 1) the name of the species as was used in the present 

work, together with the name of the author and the date of its first identification; 2) the plate and 

figure numbers for the species that were photographed with the scanning electron microscope 

(SEM), which included all the main species (&gt; 5% abundance in at least one sample) and several 

other whenever it was possible to obtain their photographic record; 3) the original generic 

classification and species name obtained with the Ellis and Messina catalogue of Foraminifera 

(1942-2009); 4) a synonymy list, whenever existing; 5) examples obtained from the literature 

(e.g., Murray, 1971; Colom, 1974; Boltovskoy et al., 1980; Jones, 1994; Levy et al., 1995; 

Debenay et al., 2001; Murray, 2003; Martins and Gomes, 2004; Mendes et al., 2004; Milker and 

Schmiedl, 2012; Holbourn et al., 2013).
