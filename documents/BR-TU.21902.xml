Neste trabalho são apresentados modelos de regressão multivariada, empregando espectros
por reflexão difusa no infravermelho com transformada de Fourier (DRIFTS), para análise
quantitativa do sistema ternário formado pelos carbonatos de cálcio e magnésio e pelo óxido de
magnésio. Através de um diagrama ternário, foram definidas as misturas para aquisição dos
espectros por reflexão no infravermelho médio. Empregando-se a regressão por mínimos
quadrados parciais (PLS), foram construídos modelos com os dados espectrais centrados na
média e/ou escalados pela variância, utilizando o conjunto de espectros de calibração. Para
selecionar os melhores modelos, foram comparados os valores de RMSEP (root mean square
error of prediction). Os resultados comprovam que bons modelos de calibração multivariada
para a determinação de carbonatos de cálcio e magnésio e de óxido de cálcio podem ser obtidos
a partir dos espectros por reflexão no infravermelho.  Estas determinações são particularmente
úteis no estudo da decomposição térmica de rochas dolomíticas.

In the present work multivariate regression models were developed for the quantitative analysis
of ternary systems using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to
determine the concentration in weight of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium
oxide. Nineteen spectra of standard samples previously defined in ternary diagram by mixture design
were prepared and mid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded. The partial least squares
(PLS) regression method was applied to the model. The spectra set was preprocessed by either
mean-centered and variance-scaled (model 2) or mean-centered only (model 1). The results based
on the prediction performance of the external validation set expressed by RMSEP (root mean square
error of prediction) demonstrated that it is possible to develop good models to simultaneously
determine calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide content in powdered
samples that can be used in the study of the thermal decomposition of dolomite rocks.

Keywords: dolomite, DRIFTS, partial least squares, multivariate regression, ternary mixture
design

Introduction

The reserves of carbonate rocks in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul - Brazil, are mainly constituted by dolomite-
like rocks (MgO content ? 18%), while calcite-like rocks
(MgO content &amp;lt;4%) occur in a smaller proportion. It is
assumed that, in volume, only 18% of the calcareous rocks
are calcite-like (used mainly in cement production) and

82% are dolomite-like and are used mainly in the correction
of soil acidity and in the production of lime.

The search for a solution to the suppressed demand
of raw materials by turning dolomite into calcium-rich
carbonate and magnesium oxide, which are thoroughly
used in industrial processes impelled the development
of a physical process of dissociation of dolomite-like
rocks, in order to obtain these two different products.
The basic idea of the process is a fractionated calcination
of a dolomite-like rock, composed mainly of Ca and Mg



595Multivariate Regression Models for the Simultaneous Quantitative AnalysisVol. 00, No. 00, 2006

carbonates (52% and 40% approximately),1 at a given
temperature and a complete calcination process that
results in a mix of calcium carbonate combined with
magnesium oxide in the same material.

The lack of specific methodologies2-6 that allow the
joint analysis of the mix of obtained products from the
fractionated calcination of the dolomite-like rocks led to
the development of a technique that enabled the
quantitative analysis of calcium carbonate and magnesium
oxide by means of Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier
Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS).

Several studies that use infrared spectrometry have
been carried out in the last few years in order to
qualitatively and quantitatively determine organic and
inorganic compounds in soils and rocks.7-11 Among these
studies, special attention has been given to those
employing mid-infrared (DRIFTS)12-14 and near-infrared
(NIRRS) reflectance.15-16

This is a non-invasive method of analysis that allows for
the quantification of the main components in the mix of
generated products in one measurement, with a high degree
of reliability.17 The determination of the contents in the mix
is very important for the quality control of the calcination
and separation processes. Furthermore, the evaluation method
also allows the control of final quality of the singular products
generated after the extraction process.

The partial least squares (PLS) regression method18-25

is an outstanding method of multivariate regression usually
applied to ternary systems, especially when preceded by
a robust factorial design.26,27 Furthermore, there are many
software packages that include the PLS regression method
as a routine treatment of spectral data as obtained by
DRIFTS.28-31

The present paper proposes the use of the DRIFTS-
PLS method to determine the concentration in weight of
calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium
oxide. The major advantages are that these analyses do
not require extensive sample preparation,32 are non-
invasive, and do not produce residues that are harmful to
the environment.

Experimental Design

Mixture design has been used throughout this work in
order to model the ternary system, which is composed of
the following analytes: calcium carbonate, magnesium
carbonate and magnesium oxide. Nineteen mixtures were
distributed along the ternary diagram presented in Figure
1. These mixtures will be used to develop the multivariate
regression models. Other six mixtures, represented by tiny
light letters, were selected to compose the validation set.

Samples

Powdered samples of calcium carbonate, magnesium
carbonate and magnesium oxide were used in order to
prepare a set of standard mixtures with different
concentrations according to the mixture design. Calcium
carbonate was supplied by FERTISUL, located in the
state of Paraná, in southern Brazil, magnesium carbonate
was donated by UNISINOS, located in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil, and commercial
analytical-grade magnesium oxide was supplied by
VETEC.

After the mixture was made, each component percentage
was recalculated, and the final values are presented in Table
1. The calcium carbonate content varied between 29.99 and
70.00%, the magnesium carbonate content varied between
0.00 and 49.99% and the magnesium oxide content, between
0.00 and 40.03%. The same procedures were used with the
external validation set samples.

Spectra

Each previously prepared standard was diluted in
spectroscopic-grade KBr at a ratio of 1:49. The mid-
infrared reflectance spectra were recorded from 4000 to
450 cm-1 with an FT-IR NICOLET spectrometer MAGNA
550 according to Table 2 parameters and using a diffuse
reflectance accessory EasiDiff™ PIKE Technologies, Inc.
KBr (spectroscopic grade) was used as background and
the spectra were obtained in triplicate for each sample.

The same procedures were used with the external
validation set samples.

Software

OMNIC E.S.P. v.3.1 was used to acquire the spectra
and to calculate an average spectrum. TurboQuant v.1.1
was employed in the modeling.

Modeling

The partial least squares (PLS) regression method was
employed on the modeling using the standard set. Briefly,
spectra were pretreated by either mean-centered and
variance-scaled or mean-centered only.

Variables selection

PLS regression on the full spectra range was performed
on the nineteen standard spectra. The first three acquired
latent variables (LV) are presented in Figure 2. Throughout
the development of the calibration models the sub-regions
where there was large LV

2
 or LV

3
 signal contribution were

used and are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3.
The stepwise elimination algorithm33 was used to

optimize the regions used in the models, and a coefficient of
determination increase and PRESS (Predictive Residual Error
Sum Of Squares) decreases were used as selection criteria.

Evaluating models

The six validation sample prediction errors were

calculated in order to compare the models beyond the
calculated coefficient of determination (R2) with the
calibration standards. Another adequate parameter used
to simultaneously evaluate the six samples is called
RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error Of Prediction), being
calculated according to expression 1.

Results and Discussion

After many attempts to obtain a calibration model it
was verified that two different pre-processing produced
better results. Both models used the regions shown in Table
3. It is worthwhile to note that there are regions selected
by LV

2
 and LV

3
 criteria and not used in the optimization.

A different region set was selected for each analyte.
The model that used mean-centered pretreatment is

called model 1. In model 2 the mean-centered data were
also variance scaled.

The minimum PRESS was used in the calibration
process together with the search for minimum RMSEP.
For model 1 those criteria give three latent variables
(factors) for CaCO

3
 and MgCO

3
 and four latent variables

for MgO. For model 2, three latent variables were obtained
for all analytes.

 The 19 standard samples used for calibration yielded
coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.954, 0.954
and 0.989 for CaCO

3
, MgCO

3 
and MgO, respectively, in

model 1; and 0.974, 0.967 and 0.959 in model 2, showing
a good linear correlation.

The prediction results for the validation set of the six
samples are presented in Table 4 for both models and
compared with the real values. Also presented in the table
are RMSEP values for each analyte. These results can be
considered quite reasonable for the both preprocessing
techniques.

The RMSEP values can be used to suggest that the
prediction value for each analyte is better obtained when
model 1 is used for MgCO

3
 and MgO and model 2 for

CaCO
3
.

Conclusions

In this work it was demonstrated that it is possible to
develop a model to be used in the study of the thermal
decomposition of dolomite rocks. It was possible to
simultaneously determine the three basic analytes: calcium
carbonate, magnesium carbonate

 
and magnesium oxide

by employing partial least squares regression methods in
DRIFTS data.

The model that used the mean-centering technique
gives better results for magnesium carbonate and
magnesium oxide, whereas a model that also included
variance-scaled data gives better results for calcium
carbonate.

This method is therefore ideal for monitoring the
calcination of dolomitc rocks and of other carbonate-rich
rocks. The major advantages are that these analyses do
not require extensive sample preparation, are non-invasive,
do not produce residues that are harmful to the
environment, and are less time-consuming, especially
when used on a routine basis.
