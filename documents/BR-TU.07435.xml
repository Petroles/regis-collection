Os peixes neotropicais de água doce são os mais abundantes em termos de 

espécies, e os peixes da família Characidae têm a maior diversidade entre 

eles. O gênero Astyanax contém 130 espécies, que se encontram em 

condição de incertae sedis em termos sistemáticos. Porém, as espécies 

podem ser diferenciadas com estudos de padrões morfológicos, 

citogenéticos e moleculares. As populações do gênero Astyanax do ribeirão 

São Bartolomeu de Minas Gerais, Brasil, nunca foram identificadas. Neste 

estudo, peixes do gênero Astyanax de duas represas da Universidade 

Federal de Viçosa foram analisados usando técnicas citogenéticas, incluindo 

coloração convencional (Giemsa), padrões de hetecromatina (banda-C), 

regiões de omrganizadores nucleolares (NOR) e hibridização fluorescente in 

situ. Os dados cromossômicos foram comparados com os caracteres 

morfológicos de cada espécime (número de raios da nadadeira anal, número 

de escamas na linha lateral, disposição das escamas e padrões dentários). 

Os cariótipos de 4m+18sm+22st+6t e 10m+20sm+12st+6t para A. giton e A. 

fasciatus não têm sido registrados anteriormente, e para A. giton, isto é o 

segundo cariótipo para esta bacia. As sequências de mtDNA de COI indicam 

que A. giton é próxima de A. giton da mesma bacia e mais distante de A. 

scabripinnis e A. intermedius, e Astyanax aff. fasciatus é no mesmo clado de 

outros A. fasciatus e A. parahybae.

ABSTRACT 
 
WALKER, Nicholas Jacob., M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, March 

2013. Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of two 
populations of minnows Astyanax gitonEigenmann 1908 
andAstyanax aff. fasciatus(Characiformes: Characidae) in the São 
BartolomeuCreek, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Adviser: Jorge Abdala 
Dergam Dos Santos. 

 

Neotropical freshwater fish are the most abundant vertebrate species, with 

Characidae fish representing the greatest diversity among them. The genus 

Astyanax contains approximately 130 species, all of which are currently 

considered incertae sedis in systematic terms. Because of vague original 

descriptions, many local populations are difficult to identify. In these cases, 

the combined analysis of morphological, cytogenetic and molecular data may 

provide useful information for determining their taxonomic status. We applied 

this approach on two populations of Astyanax occurring in the São 

Bartolomeu Creek of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, a tributary of the Doce River 

Basin. Morphological characters included the analysis of lateral line scales, 

teeth, anal fin rays. Cytogenetic techniques included conventional coloration 

(Giemsa), heterochromatin patterns (C-Banding), nucleolar organizer regions 

(NORs) and fluorescentin situ hybridization (FISH). Molecular techniques 

were performed using a 634 bp cytochrome oxidase subunit I fragment of 

mitochondrial DNA. All characters indicate that both species are Astyanax 

giton and Astyanax fasciatus respectively. The karyotypes of 

4m+18sm+22st+6t for 10m+20sm+12st+6t and A. giton and Astyanax 

aff.fasciatus respectively had not been previously reported, and for A. giton, 

this is the second karyotype in the Doce River Basin and the first incidence of 

B chromosomes. The mtDNA sequence COI indicate that A. giton is closely 

associated to other A. giton from the same basin and more distantly related 

to Astyanax scabripinnis and Astyanax intermedius, whereas Astyanax

aff.fasciatus forms a strongly supported clade with A. fasciatus from other 

basins and A. parahybae.

LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

Few published works exist regarding Astyanax giton. According to Fishbase, 

A. giton is found in the Paraíba do Sul River Basin and coastal streams of 

Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States, Brazil [1]. Recently, A. giton has been 

found in the Sossego Creek in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil [2]. 

 Eigenmann [3] defined A. giton by the following characteristics: Snout 

more than half the length of the eye; two or three teeth in the front row of the 

premaxillary; a caudal band, depth 2.5 to 2.6; eye 2.5; anal fin with 23-24 rays; 

34 scales on the lateral line with 5 above and four below as well as a diffuse 

(sometimes absent) vertically elongate humeral spot crossing the third scale of 

the lateral line. Eigenmann based these characters on two specimens from the 

Rio Paraíba in Eastern Brazil. 

 Astyanax giton from the Paraíba do Sul River Basin, Serra da Bocaina, 

São Paulo State, Brazil presented a diploid number of 2n=50 and a karyotype of 

6m+8sm+8st+28t, FN=72 [4]. Both A. giton and A. intermedius from this river 

showed five chromosome pairs bearing 5SrDNA sites, all telocentrics except for 

one subtelocentric in A. giton. The occurrence of the same number of 5S rDNA 

sites in similar locations supports the proximity of these species [4,5]. 

 Populations of A. giton from the Paraitinga River and Jacuí Stream 

presented the same diploid number and karyotype as those from the Paraíba do 

Sul River Basin [4,6]. In the Paraitinga River and Jacuí Stream, C-banding 

revealed heterochromatin in the interstitial regions of chromosomes 4, 5, 6 and 9 

as well as in the pericentromeric regions of many chromosomes. Silver nitrate 

staining in the nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR) from two sites on the 

Paraitinga River showed multiple NORs, up to six markings, and fluorescent in 

situ hybridization with the 18S rDNA probe revealed up to ten markings, many of 

them very reduced [5]. 

The karyotype and heterochromatin of A. giton from the Paraitinga was 

similar to A. intermedius in this river, with the latter species having a karyotypic 



2 
 

formula of 6m+8sm+4st+32t and heterochromatin in many pericentromeric 

regions. No GC or AT positive heterochromatin was found in either species and 

the heterochromatin did not hybridize with the As51 satellite DNA probes, a 

rarity in fish. These data indicate that A. giton and A. intermedius belong to a 

different clade than A. scabripinnis and A. parahybae, which is supported by a 

5S metacentric marker pair observed in the latter two species but not in the 

former [4,6,7]. 

Astyanax fasciatus was described by Cuvier in 1819 with Brazil as its 

type locality. This species is widely distributed, ranging from the Rio Negro in 

Patagonia to Mexico and southern Texas [3,8,9]. Different localities have more 

or less distinct varieties of A. fasciatus. These varieties are often only 

differentiated statistically; i.e., individuals are impossible to distinguish but a 

large number of specimens may be distinguished from those of another locality. 

Astyanax fasciatus is absent from some rivers where it has probably taken on 

distinct forms, such as in the Paraíba do Sul River. In this river it is replaced by 

the similar A. parahybae, which Eigenmann considered a distinct form of A. 

fasciatus formed by river isolation. This is the result of species isolation in rivers 

independently emptying into the Atlantic in eastern and southeastern Brazil, 

Central America and Mexico.  

Astyanax fasciatus is characterized morphologically by a depth of caudal 

peduncle more than half the length of the head. It usually has a single tooth in 

the maxillary. The depth is 2.3 to 3. Scales below the lateral line are in parallel 

series. The caudal band is simple and median [3]. In the Três Marias River, A. 

fasciatus present an anal fin with 22 to 32 rays, a lateral line with 37 to 41 

scales, with seven or eight above and 5.5 to 6.5 below, a length of 2.6 to 3.2 

times its height, and one maxillary tooth [10]. 

Astyanax fasciatus is considered a species complex based on 

morphological differentiation among basins and karyotypical diversity [11-16]. 

Several chromosome polymorphisms have been observed in A. fasciatus, with 

fundamental numbers ranging from 66 to 90 [13,17]. Multiple cytotypes have 

been observed in the same location, as in the Mogi-Guaçu River, which contains 



3 
 

three variants in sympatry, providing further evidence for considering A. 

fasciatus as a species complex [13]. Chromosomal inversions favor speciation, 

especially over sites of geographical co-occurrence [9].  

Diverse cytotypes, including 2n=45, 2n=46, 2n=47, 2n=48 and 2n=50, 

have been found in sympatry [15]. In a study of A. fasciatus in the Água da 

Madalena stream, Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil, three karyomorphs 

(2n=46, 2n=48 and 2n=50) were found in sympatry. Based on the absence of 

intermediate chromosome numbers, the restriction of B chromosomes to the 

2n=46 karyomorph and the absence of heteromorphism for the 18S rDNA sites, 

these karyomorphs are unlikely to hybridize and are considered three separate 

species [15]. Diploid numbers for A. fasciatus are highly variable across streams 

and basins.  

 Astyanax fasciatus has diploid numbers of 2n=45, 46, 47 or 48, 

sometimes in sympatry, in the Rio Grande do Sul Basin [13,16]. However, 

populations of this fish in the Upper Tibagi River may present karyotypes of 

6m+18sm+14s+10t (2n=48) or 8+18sm+14st+10t (2n=50), as well as 

heterochromative variations within the same karyotype [14]. Cytotypes without 

gene flow can be considered distinct taxonomic units, even in sympatry. 

The 2n=46 cytotype is present in other river systems as well, including 

the Araguari River in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Here, specimens of 

A. fasciatus presented a karyotype of 14m+16sm+10st+6t (FN=86) with Ag-

NORs in the terminal region of the short arm in the first submetacentric 

chromosome pair and in the short arms of the third metacentric pair [18]. 

Populations of A. fasciatus of the Tibagi River showed variable Ag-NOR 

sites, with one cytotype having 2-3 and the other 1-3. The Ag-NOR sites show 

evidence of transposition, fission, deletion, translocation and inactivation, and 

the presence of multiple NORs could indicate a plesiomorphy within this genus. 

Differences in the karyotypes, constitutional heterogeneity, and 18S/5S sites do 

not seem to represent fitness or selective adaptation in Astyanax [19]. 

 Histone genes constitute a complex multigene family with a variable 

number of copies in one or more chromosome regions [11,20]. The H1 linker 



4 
 

histone genes located in the pericentromeric regions of two chromosomes in A. 

fasciatus were identical to those in A. altiparanae and A. bockmanni, indicating 

these are a conserved feature of this genus. Astyanax fasciatus also presented 

clusters of 5S rDNA on one telocentric pair, a trait also found in A. bockmanni 

but not A. altiparanae. The 5S and H1 genes co-localized on chromosome 3 and 

5S hybridization revealed clusters in the pericentromeric regions of chromosome 

23 [11]. 

Populations of Astyanax fasciatus in the Upper Paraná, Araguaia-

Tocantins, Contas and São Francisco basins present multiple karyotypes in 

sympatry, reviewed in [15]. In the Água da Madalana Stream, Botucatu, São 

Paulo Brazil, a population of A. fasciatus included a 2n=46 cytotype (FN=84, 

5m+8sm+6st+4a), a 2n=48 cytotype (FN=86, 5m+8sm+6st+4a) and a 2n=50 

cytotype (FN=84, 5m+8sm+4st+8a). All contain similar constitutive 

heterochromatin and occur in sympatry, with no differences between males and 

females.  

The cytotypes may be differentiated by morphology using canonical 

variate analysis, indicating the variants may be the result of gene flow or recent 

isolation. Karyotype morphology of the 2n=48 cytotype was different at Furnas 2 

of the Vila Velha State Park in Paraná State, which is separated from other 

bodies of water and prohibits gene flow. The 2n=48 and 2n=50 cytotypes 

contain heterochromatin mainly distributed as very conspicuous blocks in the 

telomeric regions of the long arms of the telocentric chromosomes. One 2n=49 

individual was found, with seven metacentric chromosomes and 

heterochromatin equal to the 48 and 50 cytotypes -- possibly a rare hybrid. A 

distinct 2n=50 cytotype in this region presented only a few chromosomes with 

heterochromatin, almost always located interstitially [14]. 

 In A. fasciatus from the Upper Paraná, NORs are present in the distal 

portions of the short arms of two submetacentric chromosomes. 5S markers 

were present in the pericentric region of two metacentric and two telocentric 

chromosomes, with 28S markers present in the distal portion of the short arm of 



5 
 

two submetacentric chromosomes, colocalized with 5S in the two metacentric 

and telocentric chromosomes [7].  

 In the Mogi-Guaçu river, the headwaters (at Ouro-Fino) contain A. 

fasciatus with diploid numbers of 2n=48 and 2n=47; in the middle region 

(Cachoeira de Emas, Pirassununga) they have diploid numbers of 2n=48, 

2n=46, 2n=45, 2n=47 and 2n=46 but with different chromosome morphology; 

and near the confluence of the Mogi-Guaçu with the Pardo River (Barrisha), 

2n=46 and 2n=48 [13]. NOR, 18S and 5S markers were conserved within all 

cytotypes. The 2n=45 cytotype is likely the result of centric fusion among 

telocentric chromosomes as no 2n=44 cytotype has been found. At Emas Falls, 

in the middle of the Mogi-Guaçu River (where fish cannot go upstream), most A. 

fasciatus are 2n=46 with few 2n=48 and chromosomal variants [9]. 

 This scenario is reversed at localities upstream (Ouro Fino, all 2n=48) 

and downstream (Barrinha, most 2n=48). Some specimens from the Tietê River 

may have invaded the Mogi-Guaçu at a certain point between Emas falls and 

Barrinha, possibly through floods that temporarily connected tributaries from 

each main river, or by human activities. An occasional hybrid of 2n=48 and 

2n=50 is found in the Tibagi River, a tributary of Paranapanema [9]. 

 NORs are variable between cytotypes in the Mogi-Guaçu, ranging from 

two (most common) to eight with FISH 18S markers located in the NORs. Other 

fluorescent markings were smaller, always telomeric and located in 

subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, although more difficult to see and 

not detectable in all specimens. All cytotypes have a ribosomal site on the 

subterminal region of the short arm of one submetacentric pair and 5S markings 

in the pericentromeric region of the short arms of one telocentric pair [13]. These 

markings indicate the proximity of the cytotypes and a recent divergence[13]. 

The 2n=46 cytotype has six variations, likely the result of random interbreeding 

between cytotypes, i.e. karyotype plasticity. Although differences in karyotype 

may cause reproductive isolation, this is not the case in this river [21]. 

 These chromosome combinations are not enough to adversely affect 

fitness, as evidenced by marker chromosomes from several 2n=48 variants. It is 



6 
 

possible that Cachoeira de Emas contains populations that converged during 

migrations. 2n=46 could have come from the Paraná River, through either the 

Tietê or Grande rivers, or small floods in areas where the Tietê and Mogi-Guaçu 

rivers are close[13]. 

 If 2n=46 is an invading karyotype, the ability to interbreed may be helping 

it succeed [13]. Shared features of the karyotypes suggest recent divergence, 

suggesting two populations or two species [19]. Chromosomal speciation may 

cause reproductive isolation because hybrids may be infertile, although that 

does not appear to be the case in this river[13]. The 2n=46 invader is likely able 

to interbreed with 2n=48, as indicated by the frequency and location of 2n=46 

cytotypes in nearby Paraná Basin collection sites and constitutive 

heterochromatin in terminal regions on long arms of variouschromosomes and in 

the terminal regions of the short arms of submetacentric chromosomes in both 

cytotypes, with these regions being GC-rich and containing NORs [16]. 

 Banding patterns differ among Astyanax. C-banding is highly variable, 

with polymorphisms occurring even within populations. GC-rich heterochromatic 

regions are often associated with NORs [9]. Fifty nine percent AT satellite DNA 

was identified in a portion of the A. scabripinnis genome [22] containing 

monomeric units of 51 bp, known as As51 [23]. This sequence has also been 

identified in A. fasciatus, A. janeiroensis and A. paranae. Although satellites are 

likely targets for breaks and fusions, As51 has not been associated with 

modifications to the diploid number in A. fasciatus or A. scabripinnis [23]. 

 Nevertheless, hybrid forms have not been directly detected in the Mogi-

Guaçu Basin, although molecular markers show some gene flow among 

cytotypes [19]. As51 satellite sites have been found in the terminal regions of the 

long arms of one telocentric, four subtelocentric and three submetacentric pairs 

in the 2n=48 cytotype, and in one telocentric, three subtelocentric and four 

submetacentric pairs in the 2n=46 cytotype, with additional As51 sites in the 

variant pairs. CMA3 staining showed GC-rich heterochromatin exclusively 

related to the NOR sites [16].

 Several species of Astyanax including A. altiparanae, A. lacustris, A. 

fasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis show conserved localization of 

5S/28S markers between species, indicating a close phylogenetic relationship 

[7], with 5S visible in more than one pair [24]. NORs are almost always fewer 

than regions detected by FISH. These 5S locations are absent in A. giton and A. 

intermedius, suggesting polyphyly or divergence within this genus [13]. R-

banding patterns have been observed in four species (A. altiparanae, A. 

fasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis) in one large submetacentric 

chromosome and one small pair of metacentric chromosomes, colocalized with 

C-band negative late replicating regions [7]. 

 In Astyanax, heterochromatin may be balanced between AT and GC 

content [6] or 59% AT [22]. Astyanax fasciatus and A. parahybae have As51 

DNA, while A. giton and A. intermedius do not. Both the 2n=46 and 2n=58 forms 

of A. fasciatus have 8 pairs of As51, which is similar to that of A. scabripinnis 

from the Piracicaba River [12,16]. It is possible that As51 was the ancestral 

condition and that the pairs have increased with time as a result of Robertsonian 

and non-Robertsonian rearrangements that could duplicate or disperse satellite 

DNA. Most As51 sites are homologous, but slight variations exist. Variations 

between karyotypes could be the result of intrachromosomal rearrangements 

involving telocentric chromosomes with terminal As51 sites on the long arms, 

which were absent in the 2n=45 forms [16]. 

 Not all regions where 28S rDNA colocalized with 5S rDNA were Ag+, 

possibly because the 5S genes were associated with rDNA genes that did not 

form a nucleolus because the gene sequences were too small to be detected 

[7]. In A. fasciatus from the Upper Paraná, co-localization was observed in one 

of the telocentric pairs [24]. 5S rDNA is composed of tandemly repeated units of 

approx 120 bp, intercalated by a non-transcribed spacer (nts). The 120 bp 

repeated units are stable, while the nts changes more rapidly [4]. Several 

species of Astyanax, including A. fasciatus, have a 5S rDNA cluster in the distal 

region of a metacentric chromosome [4,7].

 B-chromosomes are dispensable supernumerary chromosomes 

characterized by their lack of homology with regular ones [20] and do not obey 

Mendelian laws of inheritance [25]. B chromosomes are mostly composed of 

repetitive DNA sequences, especially ribosomal DNA, satellite DNA and in rare 

cases, protein coding genes [11]. It is estimated B chromosomes are present in 

10-15% of eukaryotes [25] but this is impossible to determine with certainty as 

by definition they are not found in all individuals and are likely to be missed if the 

karyotype is based on only one individual [26].  

 B chromsomes can vary substantially in their size, frequency and other 

characteristics. They may be macro, intermediate or micro and most are 

heterochromatic. Many Bs contain rRNA genes detectable by both NOR and 

FISH [25]. B chromosomes may originate in one of two ways. They can be 

intraspecific, from the host genome (most common) or interspecific, from 

another species, .e.g. the result of hybridization [27]. As B chromosomes do not 

synapse or recombine, they evolve independently of the A set. Therefore, 

regardless of origin, the evolutionary pathways of B chromosomes are the same 

in either case and B chromosome morphology is not necessarily reflective of 

origin. 

 There are several ways to test B chromosome origins. Banding patterns 

and repetitive sequences may be compared between the B and A sets. If no 

matches are found, the B chromosome can be compared to the a set of related 

species. Chromosomal fragments may also be visible in interspecific crosses, 

and phylogenetic analyses may be done on the transposable elements of both 

the B and A sets [27].  

 The simplest method for B chromosomes to originate is for them to come 

from the A set via duplication or fragments after fusions or amplification of a 

paracentromeric region. Fragments of paternal chromosomes sometimes 

survive even in cytoplasmic incompatible crosses [27]. That similar B 

chromosomes are found in similar species suggests they are long lived and may 

even survive speciation events -- or they could be the result of more recent 

hybridization events [25,27].

 B chromosomes in Astyanax can vary within species (by size or 

morphology). They may also vary by sex or altitude, meaning may be an 

adaptive trait [9]. There is no evidence on the precise role of B chromosomes on 

individual fitness in Astyanax[9]. Species of Astyanax, such as A. fasciatus, A. 

scabripinnis and A. schubarti present B-chromosomes [28,29]. The origin of 

supernumerary chromosomes is unknown, but it is accepted that they result 

from amplification of other parts of the genome [30] and A-chromosomes follow 

their own evolutionary pathway (Mestriner, 2000). The metacentric macro B 

chromosome is the most common in Astyanax[11].  

 In A. fasciatus, B chromosomes are reported for the 2n=46 karyomorph 

in the São Francisco Basin [15,31,32] and a 2n=49 karyomorph has been 

observed in the Tibagi River, in the Upper Paraná River Basin, Ponta Grossa, 

Paraná, Brazil [14].  

 There are two groups of B chromosomes in Astyanax. The first is 

composed of species with large metacentric Bs, including A. fasciatus, A. 

scabripinnis[32-36], A. eigenmanniorum, A. schubarti, and A. bockmanni[32], 

suggesting a common origin. This hypothesis could be tested by comparing 

DNA sequences of B chromosomes. The second is in the A. scabripinnis group, 

where the presence of distinct types of supernumerary chromosomes has been 

commonly reported in several populations ranging from large 

metacentric/submetacentric elements to small metacentric or even 

microchromosomes [9]. 

B chromosomes may result from interspecific hybridization, supported by 

the presence of DNA sequences in the B chromosome matching those of the A 

chromosome of related species, as seen in A. fasciatus[37].  However, an 

ancestral B preceding speciation events is supported by As51 satellite DNA 

found in B chromosomes of A. scabripinnis populations. [9]. The B chromosome 

may originate from a nondisjunction of the first pair of chromosomes during 

meiosis, with subsequent heterochromatinization [29]. Another hypothesis is that 

shared DNA sequences on A and B chromosomes evidence that the B 

chromosomes are isochromes from the A set [22], which was confirmed in A. 



10 
 

scabripinnis by finding that B chromosomes resulted from tandem duplications 

of heterochromatin segments in acrocentric pair 24, as well as sharing some 

repetitive DNA sequences [36,37]. This is based on the presence of an 

interstitial heterochromatic band in the long arm of this pair, which is believed to 

cause interstitial As51 sites at symmetric distances from the centromere in both 

arms of the B chromosome. B chromosomes may also vary by gender, with 

individual females or some populations containing an additional B [22]. A large 

metacentric B chromosome was found in A. scabripinnis, A. eigenmanniorum, A. 

schubarti and A. fasciatus[32,37]. This suggests that this B originated prior to 

species differentiation, but molecular analysis is needed to confirm. B 

chromosomes have not been documented in A. giton. No phenotypic effects 

resulting from B chromosomes have been observed in Astyanax [37]. 

 As in the second hypothesis, rapid heterochromatization may occur by 

genetic imprinting to deactivate B chromosomes, which explains the presence of 

heterochromatin in many Bs. Sometimes the B forms anew in each generation 

due to non-disjunction [27]. Rapid heterochromatization of B chromosomes often 

occurs (as seen by C-Banding) and may be necessary for stability and positive 

selection. B chromosomes may also be a precursor to sex chromosomes 

(especially the y chromosomes, which also move to opposite poles during 

spermatogenesis) which are also high in repeats [25,27]. B chromosomes may 

originate from either autosomes or sex chromosomes, although the latter are not 

found in any populations of A. fasciatus or A. giton.  

 B chromosomes often contain rDNA to encode ribosomal RNAs, typically 

visualized as NORs (secondary constrictions). NORs may also be suspect to 

chromosome breakage, which could create Bs that could then lose rDNA 

segments, affecting their size. Bs may also accumulate fragments from various 

sources [27]. 

 Bs may have no phenotypic effects, or they may affect vigor, fertility or 

fecundity. For example, B chromosomes result in color changes in some plants 

[25]. Bs may also exert influence simply by their presence, e.g. by containing 

NORs. [27].One negative effect of Bs is that having more chromosomes means 



11 
 

more DNA to replicate, meaning a longer cell cycle and larger cells. This slows 

development in some species. Bs may be more common in species with smaller 

genomes and fewer chromosomes [25].  

 B tolerance is dependent on the effects of supernumerary chromosomes. 

If fitness decreases with Bs, complete intolerance results. If fitness is unaffected 

with some B chromosomes, but is reduced when more are present, there will be 

incomplete tolerance (the most common case). If fitness is independent of Bs, 

the A set will be tolerant. Overtolerance occurs when the B increases host 

fitness. This last case is most likely when the B arises from hybridization as it 

includes new DNA. As the effects of B chromosomes are usually negative, they 

may be more common in favorable environments with less selective pressure 

[25]. 

 Methylation has been proposed for deactivating sex chromosomes and 

may also function with late-replicating B chromosomes to make them genetically 

inert [27]. B chromosomes that are transcriptionally active with no apparent 

phenotypic effects could have their transcripts nullified by transporon insertion. 

 Meiosis is always asymmetric, especially in females with polar bodies and 

oocytes [25]. Since Bs are not paired during meiosis, they can go to their 

preferred meiotic pole, possibly increasing their transmission rate. Bs may also 

result from nondisjunction during meiosis anaphase. Bs are often unstable 

during meiosis, with a transmission rate of less than 0.5. A rate of greater than 

0.5 indicates accumulation, or drive. B drive is a disregard for Mendelian 

transmission (also known as an unfair transmission pattern) and is necessary for 

their survival. B chromosomes must have accumulation methods, or they would 

only make sense as being beneficial; they likely begin by being selfish even if 

they become inactive later [25]. Due to meiosis, it is possible for the B to always 

originate from one sex. They can occur during female meiosis by migrating from 

one oocyte to another, as well as in males by avoiding heterochromatin [27]. 

 Bs may be considered parasitic if they have driven or damage the host 

(virulence). In species in which the B chromosomes do not drive, they could be 

suppressed by the A genome. The host (A set) may evolve resistance, but the B 



12 
 

may evolve another form, continuing the cycle. For example, in species of mealy 

bugs the B tries to decondense and segregate with the sperm, but drive 

suppressor genes in the A set prevent this from occurring. The selection to 

eliminate B chromosomes, however, is usually weak. Genes for their removal 

are only helpful to individuals with them, and in most cases the B has very small 

effects. On the other hand, the B is selecting for its very survival [25]. 

 Bs are selected at the level of the chromosome and impact higher levels 

of organization [25]. They can affect gene expression of the A set, NOR 

expression and the level of recombination in the A set (chiasma effect). The 

latter is hypothesized to occur for one of four reasons: 

1) The adaptation hypothesis: B chromosomes enable higher levels of 

genetic variation, leading to faster population evolution. This is criticized 

because it suggests parasites are selected for positive host effects. 

2) Passive effects: Chiasma effects are the result of extra DNA, but this 

cannot explain contradictory effects. 

3) The increased chiasma frequency is the result of parasitic Bs, because 

some recombinant progeny will be resistant to B chromosomes and 

individuals with Bs will have higher rates of recombination. (This is a 

variation of Matt Ridley’s Red Queen hypothesis [38], that recombination 

increases when conditions are poor.) 

4) Changes in chiasma frequency serve the selfish purposes of the B 

chromosome, i.e. Bs pair with Bs to reduce meiotic loss with the side 

effect of more B chiasma, or the formation of bivalent Bs is blocked, or 

Chiasma results from restricted A-B pairing. 

 When chiasma increases in populations with driving Bs, the third 

explanation is most likely. The response is proportional to the intensity of B 

parasitic Bs, and contradictory results could indicate the B is not driving (near-

neutral). Where chiasma decreases, it could be that Bs are heterotic or 

beneficial. In populations with even numbers of B chromosomes, it may be 

because the B chromosomes are able to pair (hypothesis 4). If odd and even 



13 
 

numbers of Bs are present in different ratios, one may have more drive than the 

other [25].  

 Many B chromosomes are stable, in which the drive mechanism and 

selection are balanced. In these cases, the B becomes more dependent on drift 

and population size, unless it can acquire an even number of Bs and regular 

meiotic behavior to incorporate itself into the A set [25]. B equilibrium (stability) 

results from two opposing forces: first, the accumulation of Bs by either the 

selfish chromosome theory or a high transmission ratio; and a change in 

individual fitness. As the survival of B chromosomes is ultimately linked to their 

hosts, they may become less harmful over time (which would reduce the 

probability of phenotypic effects) [25]. Newly formed Bs would therefore be 

expected to be the most harmful. 

 B chromosomes have three options -- they can remain as a parasite, they 

can acquire a function and integrate themselves into the host (the selfish gene, 

working horizontally; although this is rare and only possible when already 

common) or go extinct. They may change from parasitic to neutral and back 

many times. The A set may completely suppress drive, or do nothing. But the B 

has a secret weapon -- because it is genetically indispensible, it can support a 

high mutation rate without serious consequences, which explains the large 

number of B variants in many species. Even a neutralized B can still last more 

than 10,000 generations, plenty of time to regain drive/parasitism [25]. 

According to Muller's ratchet, deleterious mutations build up in asexual species, 

so sexual reproduction is needed to eliminate them. As B chromosomes are not 

subject to recombination, they may also be subject to these mutations [27]. 

 B chromosomes may in some cases be considered genomic parasites 

[26], as in the selfish gene theory [39]. This has been theorized for populations 

of A. scabripinnis with B chromosomes at high altitude but not at lower elevation 

[40]. Under this explanation, more B chromosomes would be expected in areas 

where environmental conditions are more favorable for this species -- e.g. 

headwater streams, higher altitude, etc., where decreased predation and 

interspecific competition allow higher tolerance of parasitic B chromosomes [37]. 



14 
 

In populations of A. scabripinnis, populations at the highest altitudes were the 

most likely to have large metacentric B chromosomes [24], but they had fewer 

NORs than low altitude populations [37].  

C-Banding has shown that B chromosomes can be totally or partially 

heterochromatic [28]. Some Astyanax populations show faint paracentromeric 

C-bands in all chromosomes, being more conspicuous distally on the long arms 

of telocentric A chromosomes [22]. Additionally, C-band locations may coincide 

with those of NOR, and interstitial C-bands are sometimes present on the arms 

of B chromosomes.  

Astyanax fasciatus from the Campo Novo River, Paraná Basin, São 

Paulo State, Brazil (22º23’8.35”S, 49º0’55.63”W) presented a diploid number of 

2n=46, karyotype of 10m+14st+20st+2t and FN=90 [11]. These authors suggest 

that the 2n=46 A. fasciatus are probably the result of fusions from the ancestral 

state of 2n=50. Two out of 25 individuals had medium-sized telocentric B 

chromosomes of similar size and morphology to pair 23, but it is unlikely that 

they originated from the A set because they do not have similar rDNA or 

hisDNA. 

Astyanaxbimaculatus, A. fasciatus, A. schubarti, and A. scabripinnis 

subjected to R-Banding showed one large submetacentric and two small 

submetacentric markers, indicating a common origin among them [7,8]. R- and 

G-banding of a population of A. scabripinnis paranae (now known as A. 

paranae, separate from the A. scabripinnis complex [41]) from Cascatinha 

stream showed a pattern of longitudinal differentiation in B chromosomes [29]. 

Silver nitrate (Ag-NOR banding) can identify the 45S rDNA located in the 

NORs, however the 5S rDNA sites require more specific techniques, e.g. 

fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [24]. Intrapopulational NOR site variation 

may represent genomic variations in populations with stable karyotypes [24].  

Astyanax spp. are found in two reservoirs of the São Bartolomeu Creek at 

the Federal University of Viçosa in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and have never 

been formally identified. We hypothesize that they are A. giton and A. fasciatus, 

known respectively as the silver minnow and red-tailed minnow. These species 



15 
 

show cytogenetic variance across basins and each may constitute a separate 

species complex. This hypothesis may be tested by cytogenetic characters and 

morphology.  

Dam construction, flow regulation, mining, deforestation and industrial and 

agricultural pollution increasingly affect major river basins by modifying fish 

habitats and altering fish life-cycles. However, compared to mammals, birds and 

amphibians, relatively few South American freshwater fish have been 

scientifically assessed as endangered species by IUCN or other criteria, even 

[42]. 

Cytogenetic studies, combined with mitochondrial DNA and morphology, will 

facilitate characterization of these species within Astyanax. Cytogenetic studies 

of chromosomal data, including karyotyping, C-Banding, Ag-NOR and the FISH 

technique will be performed. Cytogenetic studies can show if these individuals 

represent populations of A. giton and A. fasciatus, and can be used for 

interpopulational cytogenetic comparisons to provide information on evolutionary 

structure of this genus.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Neotropical freshwater fish comprise approximately 6,000 of the 13,000 

species worldwide, in 25 orders and 71 families [9]. These fishes represent the 

most diversified vertebrate group and are adequate for studies of genetic 

diversity and evolution [43].  

Neotropical fishes present high karyotypic variability, with changes in the 

diploid number, sex chromosome systems, supernumerary chromosomes, 

natural triploidy, and diversity of constitutive heterochromatin and nucleolar 

organizer regions (NORs) [44]. Some families of Neotropical fish are 

characterized by stable diploid numbers, such as Anostomidae (including the 

genera Abramites, Anostomus, Laemolyta, Leporellus, Leporinus, Pseudanos, 

Rhytiodus and Schizodon), Prochilodontidae, (including Prochilodus and 

Semaprochilodus), Parodontidae (including Apareiodon and Parodon), 

Curimatidae (including Curimata, Curimatella, Curimatopsis and Cyphocharax), 

Cynodontidae (including Cynodon, Hydrolycus and Rhaphydon), Hemiodontidae 

(including Anodus, Argonectes, Bivibranchia and Hemiodus) and 

Pseudopimelodidae (including Lophiosilurus, Microglanis and 

Pseudopimelodus), all of which present 2n=54 (excluding rare instances of B 

chromosomes) [45]. 

 In other cases, the diploid numbers may be more variable. In the family 

Erythrinidae, Hoplias lacerdae presents a conservation of the diploid number 

2n=50 in the Usina Limoeira (São Jose do Rio Pardo) and CA UNESP (both in 

São Paulo State), in the Rio São Francisco and Uberlândia (Minas Gerais State) 

and the Rio Pitinga (Amazonas). This diploid number is also found in H. aff. 

lacerdae in the Rio Grande (Sacramento, Minas Gerais). On the other hand, H. 

malabaricus is variable, presenting 2n=40 (males 39) in specimens from the 

Monjolinho, Piracicaba, Três Pontes, Passa-Cinco, Luiz Antônio, Tietê and Lobo 

rivers, (São Paulo); Rio das Pedras (Minas Gerais) and 2n=40 (both sexes) in 

the Rio São Francisco (Minas Gerais), Manaus (Amazonas), Tucurul (Pará), 

Porto Velho (Rondônia), Cuiaba Pontal do Araguaia Rio Sepotuba (Mato 



17 
 

Grosso); Goiás Velho (Goiás), Corumba and Miranda (Mato Grosso do Sul), 

Paramaribo (Suriname) and the Rio Aguapey in Argentina. This last location 

also includes 2n=42 cytotypes, as do the Doce River, Lake Caríoca (of the Doce 

River), Lake Patos, Rio Grande, Rio Piranga and Rio Sapucal (all located in 

Minas Gerais); Rio Juquiá, Rio Jurumirím and Lake Guaporé (São Paulo); Rio 

Vorá, São Mateus do Sul, Curitiba, Rio Jurumirím, Rio Iguaçu and Rio Tibagi 

(Paraná) and Araguaiana (Mato Grosso) [45]. In total, seven cytotypes have 

been found for H. malabaricus [46]. 

The Characiformes are one of the main orders of Ostariophysan fishes, 

including approximately 1,900 valid species belonging to over 270 genera, 

currently arranged in 18 families in Africa, Central America and South America 

[47,48].It is one of the most numerous freshwater fish fauna in the Neotropical 

region, second only to catfish [49]. Phylogenetic relationships within 

Characiformes are not clear [50].  

Characidae is the most diverse family and comprises 58% of this order, 

with approximately 250 South American genera and 1,100 species, 

[8,37,48,51,52]. It comprises the majority of freshwater fish in Brazil, with 20 

subfamilies and approximately 400 species [10,37]. Phylogenetic relationships 

of Characidae, however, are not known (but see [21]). Genera of this family 

have variable diploid numbers, with 2n=52 in Bryconamericus, Cheirodon, 

Exodon, Inpaichthys, Markiana, Piabina, Triportheus, Charax, Cynopotamus, 

Galeocharax, Roeboides, Odontostilbe, Serrapinus and Mimagoniates; 48 in 

Bryconops; 50 in Ctenobrycon, Hasemania, Hollandichthys, Moenkhausia, 

Nematobrycon, Pselogrammus, Salminus, Aphyocharacinae, Brycon, 

Deuterodon and Oligosarcus, the latter two closely related to Astyanax. Diploid 

numbers of 60 or greater are found in Pristobrycon, Pygocentrus, Serrasalmus 

and Metynnis, while lower numbers are found in Phenacogaster (46) or 

Paracheirodon, which presents 32, 36, 50 or 52 chromosomes [45].  

More specific trends are also evident in genera such as Astyanax, which 

can vary in diploid numbers, chromosome morphology, banding patterns and the 

presence of B chromosomes, especially across species or basins. A diploid 



18 
 

number of 2n=50 is considered basal for the genus [53] as found for A. 

bimaculatus, with most Astyanax containing between 2n=46 and 2n=50 

chromosomes [7,15] except for A. schubarti which has 2n=36 [7,54]. 

The genus Astyanax was described in 1854[55] based on samples 

collected from Baird and Girard in Texas and Mexico. The original description 

lists the presence of an adipose fin, large scales, dorsal fin above the ventrals a 

non-serrated abdominal line and a double row of teeth on both the upper and 

lower jaw, flattened with several conical spines or processes upon their edge, 

lacking canine and palative teeth. The double row of mandibular teeth is not 

reported in later descriptions of this genus. 

Astyanax was described again by Carl Eigenmann in 1917, with samples 

from South America[3]. Eigenmann characterized Astyanax as small 

compressed fishes, more or less elongate, reaching a length of 150 mm and 

usually much smaller (with the exception being the larger Astyanax maximus). 

Fishes of this genus have a complete lateral line, pre-maxillary teeth in two 

series (internal series with four or usually five teeth), a mandible with strong 

frontal teeth and minute conical teeth on the sides. The crowns of the 

premaxillary and mandibular are usually ridged and denticulate, with few or no 

teeth in the maxillary. Maxillary bone is short, with its anterior edge forming a 

more or less continuous curve from end to end. The lateral line rarely has more 

than 39 scales although it can be as high as 41 in some specimens of A. 

fasciatus, A. taeniatus and A. scabripinnis. The lateral line curves slightly in the 

front, and runs along the fourth longitudinal series of scales, above the ventral 

fin or higher. The scales are of normal size and cover the base of the rays of the 

tail, although the rest of the tail is naked. Regular and complete series of scales 

are found between the occipital process and the dorsal. The gill rakers are 

setiform and no predorsal spine is present. Body length is about three times 

body height [3,10]. 

 Some geographically isolated fish assemblages are restricted to 

headwaters, separated by physical, chemical or biotic barriers, resulting in 

distinct evolutionary pathways within a single hydrographic system. This may be 



19 
 

the reason Astyanax is one of the most speciose genera in the Neotropics, 

including several species complexes [9]. Astyanax is regarded as incertae sedis 

because of its likely polyphyletic origin [9] and considered a recent group with 

chromosome polymorphism in several species [21]. Astyanax has extensive 

morphological diversification and highly complex taxonomy with a number of 

species complexes [15,37,52]. 

 Although doubts remain on the monophyly of Astyanax[3,4,7,8,56], this 

genus is an excellent model for all kinds of studies of evolutionary mechanisms 

[41]. It is one of the best documented Neotropical fish genera from a cytogenetic 

standpoint, with the species complexes Astyanax scabripinnis, A. fasciatus and 

A. altiparanae (the latter is sometimes referred to as A. bimaculatus) being the 

most studied [41]. Species complexes are characterized by wide cytogenetic 

variation, mainly regarding distinct diploid numbers. Karyotypes, however, could 

also differ because of non-Robertsonian rearrangements. Whether or not 

individual cytotypes are considered distinct species depends on whether or not 

they can hybridize (karyotype plasticity) [41]. Some examples of karyotypes are 

as follows: 

 Astyanax scabripinnis from Rio Agua do Rancho, Paraná present 2n=50, 

6m+28sm+16t, 4 NORs, C-Bands and 0-2 micro B chromosomes; A. 

bimaculatus from the Rio Paraguai, Mato Grosso do Sul present 2n=50, 

6m+26sm+12st+6t, 1 NOR, C-, Q- and Mytramicin Bands and no Bs; A. 

altiparanae from Fundo Altenas, Minas Gerais are 2n=50, 8m+28sm+6st+8t, 2 

NORs, C-Banding, Chromomycin A3 and no Bs; A. aff. abramis from the Rio 

Bento Gomes, Mato Grosso are 2n=50, 22m+10sm+6st+12t, 1 NOR, C-

Banding, Chromomycin A3 and no Bs; A. eigenmanniorum from the Marrecas, 

Paraná are 2n=50, 6m+20sm+8st+16t, 5 NORs, C-Bands, Chromomycin A3 and 

no Bs; A. schubarti from the Rio Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo are 2n=36, 

12m+16sm+4st+4t, 1 NOR, C-Bands and no Bs; and A. fasciatus from the Rio 

São Francisco, Minas Gerais are 2n=46, 6m+24sm+8st+8a, 4 NORs, C-Bands, 

and 0-1 large metacentric Bs [45]. 



20 
 

 Astyanax fasciatus has highly variable karyotype morphology [41], with 

two standard diploid numbers of 2n=46 and 2n=48 and some 2n=50 specimens 

with affinities to the A. fasciatus group in the Tibagi River Basin [9]. Several 

cytotypes may occur in sympatry, as in the Mogi-Guaçu  River.The karyotype of 

Astyanax giton is also geographically variable although a diploid number of 

2n=50 is conserved. A comparison of Astyanax spp. cytotypes across basins is 

shown (Table 1).

Brazilian states abbreviated as follows: GO = Goías, MG = Minas Gerais, SP = 
São Paulo.Table adapted from data reviewed by Pazza &amp;amp; Kavalco [9]. Data for 
Astyanax giton from Sossego from Aguiar [2], A. fasciatus from São Francisco 
from (UNESP) [45] and Astyanax aff.fasciatus and A. giton from São Bartolomeu 
(bold) from this work. 
 
 In terms of morphology, Eigenmann [3] points out that "the true A. 

scabripinnis shades through [A. intermedius] into A. taeniatus.... I think it would 

be possible to arrange specimens of A. scabripinnis, A. intermedius and A. 

taeniatus from the Paraíba into series in respect to any one character and get 

complete integrations." In Astyanax taeniatus, the teeth on the sides of the lower 

jaw tend to become graduate, a condition leading to the distinguishing character 

of Deuterodon[3]. Astyanax taeniatus usually has three teeth in the front row of 

the premaxillary, 19 to 24 rays in the anal fin, two maxillary teeth, 32 to 39 

scales on the lateral line with 5 to 7 above and 4 or 5 below. The teeth of A. 

obscurus, A. taeniatus, A. giton and A. intermedius all share the common trait of 

gradually decreasing, unlike most other Astyanax (including A. fasciatus) which 

exhibit an abrupt reduction in size between the anterior and posterior dentary 

teeth [57]. 

 Astyanax altiparanae isconsidered a species complex because of 

significant inter-populational karyotypic variation (similar to A. fasciatus and A. 



22 
 

scabripinnis). karyotypic variation may be caused by structural rearrangements, 

e.g. pericentric inversions. This is observed in A. giton and A. intermedius, which 

are mainly differentiated cytogenetically by a paracentric inversion in the 

chromosomal pair beaing 5S rDNA [9]. 

 Astyanax giton is found in the Paraíba do Sul River Basin and coastal 

streams of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States [1] and in the Doce River 

Basin in Minas Gerais State, Brazil [2]. Astyanax giton is characterized 

morphologically by two or three teeth in the front row of the premaxillary, an anal 

fin with 23-24 rays, 34 scales on the lateral line with 5 above and four below as 

well as a diffuse (sometimes absent) vertically elongate humeral spot crossing 

the third scale of the lateral line [3].  

Populations morphologically similar to Astyanax fasciatus are distributed 

from the Rio Negro in Patagonia to Mexico and southern Texas [3,8]. Astyanax 

fasciatus is characterized morphologically by a single maxillary tooth, an anal fin 

with 22 to 32 rays, a lateral line with 37 to 41 scales, with seven or eight above 

and 5.5 to 6.5 below, a length of 2.6 to 3.2 times its height, and one maxillary 

tooth [10]. Astyanax fasciatus is considered a species complex, based on 

morphological differentiation among basins and karyotypical diversity [11-16]. 

Diploid numbers for A. fasciatus are highly variable across streams and basins. 

Astyanax fasciatus is absent from the Paraíba do Sul River in which it is 

replaced by A. parahybae, which may be a distinct form of A. fasciatus resulting 

from rivers independently emptying into the Atlantic in eastern and southeastern 

Brazil, Central America and Mexico[3,58]. 

Although the southeastern region of Brazil is known for its high levels of 

endemism (these rivers are considered a biogeographical unit [59], with 95% of 

species being considered endemic [58], few species of Astyanax have been 

karyotyped in this area. Samples of Astyanax were captured in two reservoirs of 

the São Bartolomeu Creek, at the Federal University of Viçosa in Minas Gerais 

State, Brazil. Cytogenetic characterization of these fishes was done using 

karyotypes with Giemsa, Ag-NOR banding, C-Banding, and the FISH technique. 

These data were complemented with morphological and molecular analyses.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 COLLECTION AREA 
 Ninety-one individuals (32 A. giton and 59 A. fasciatus) were captured 

from two reservoirs of the São Bartolomeu Creek at the Federal University of 

Viçosa, in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil from October 2011 to July 2012. 

The São Bartolomeu creek is part of the Doce River Basin, in southeast Brazil, 

(18º 45’ and 21º 15’ S and 39º55’and 43º 45’W). Fish were captured with rods 

from two reservoirs, one near the Quatro Pilastras (20°45'32.81"S 

45°52'22.54"W) hereafter referred to as reservoir 1, and a second upstream 

dam (20°46'06.31"S 42°52'17.27"W), hereafter referred to as reservoir 2 (Figure 

1). These reservoirs were selected because they are somewhat isolated and 

have never been studied cytogenetically. They are located within the Atlantic 

Rainforest, an area considered a biodiversity hotspot, with only 8% of original 

forest remaining [60]. 

 Although fish can swim from Reservoir 2 to Reservoir 1 via a waterfall, 

they cannot go in the opposite direction, suggesting the possibility of differences 

in species composition between these reservoirs. Fifty fish (23 A. giton and 27 

A. fasciatus) were captured from Reservoir 1 and 41 fish (9 A. giton and 32 A. 

fasciatus) from Reservoir 2. One male A. giton was captured from Reservoir 1; 

the other 31 were female. Thirteen male A. fasciatus were captured from 

Reservoir 1 along with 14 females, and six males and 26 female A. fasciatus 

were captured from Reservoir 2. Astyanax giton were more difficult to capture in 

both reservoirs and circumstantial evidence indicates that this species actively 

avoids gillnets.

adapted from Google Earth imagery. 
 

Fish were kept in aquariums for cytogenetic analysis, fixed in 10% 

formalin for one week, transferred to 70% ethanol, deposited in the 

ichthyological collection at the João Moojen Zoological Museum for 

morphological studies or sent to Dr. Vinicius A. Bertaco at the University of Rio 

Grande Do Sul for taxonomic confirmation. 

 

2.2 MORPHOLOGICAL PROTOCOLS 
The sex of each fish was determined by external sexual dimorphism, 

based on presence (males) or absence (females) of anal fin hooks and later 



25 
 

confirmed by type of gonad. Morphometric data were analyzed [3,10,56] 

including the length and height of the fish, the aspect ratio (length/height), the 

number of rays in the anal fin, the number of scales on, above and below the 

lateral line, and the number of teeth in the dentary, maxillary and pre-maxillary. 

Data were analyzed using the software program PAST v. 2.17b [61]. Data were 

transformed using the option to remove size from distances in PAST with 

isometric Burnaby then plotted with principal component analysis (PCA) with a 

correlation matrix and disregarding groups. 

For PCA, fish were separated by species and the following thirteen 

morphological characters were used: 1) Total length, 2) Body height, 3) Aspect 

ratio (length/height), 4) Scales above lateral line, 5) Scales below lateral line, 6) 

Scales on lateral line, 7) Number of rays on anal fin, 8) Dentary teeth (center), 9) 

Dentary teeth (side), 10) Maxillary teeth, 11) Number of teeth in the first 

premaxillary row, 12) Number of teeth in the second premaxillary row, and 13) 

Number of teeth in the third premaxillary row. This last attribute was observed 

only in a single female Astyanax aff.fasciatus from reservoir 1 containing a 

single tooth in the third row; the rest of the fish had only two rows as expected 

for this genus. 

 
2.3 CYTOGENETIC PROTOCOL 
 Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 60 fish with specimens from 

both reservoirs. Mitotic chromosomes were obtained from cell suspensions of 

the anterior kidney, using the conventional air-drying method[62] after fish were 

anaesthetized with clove oil [63]. In addition to the standard Giemsa method, 

chromosomes were analyzed using silver nitrate staining [64] to visualize the 

nucleolar organizing regions (Ag-NOR), C-banding was used to detect C-

positive heterochromatin [65] and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was 

performed [66] using 28S and 5S DNA sequence probes.  

About 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed per specimen (total 1700) to 

determine the diploid chromosome number and karyotypic structure. 

Chromosomes were classified as metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), 



26 
 

subtelocentric (st) or telocentric (t) according to centromeric index values [67] 

using the program ImageJ 1.46. 

 

2.4 MOLECULAR DNA 
 DNA extraction followed [68] on six specimens. Fragments of cytochrome 

oxidase subunit I (COI) were amplified using primers L8524 (5'-AAY CCT GAR 

ACT GAC CAT G-3') and H9236 (5'-GTT AGT GGT CAK GGG CTT GGR TC-3') 

[69]. Double-stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?l reactions containing 10 ?l 

dNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?l reaction buffer (200 mM Tris–HCl pH 8?4, 500 mM KCl), 2 

?l MgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?l of each primer (10 mM), 0?5 ?l (2?5 U) Taq DNA 

polymerase (Phoneutria), 2 ?l template DNA (100 ng/?l) and 26?5 ?l H2O. 

PCR conditions were as follows: 94? C (2 min), five cycles of 94? C (45 s), 54? C 

(45 s) and 72? C (1?5 min) and 29 cycles of 94? C (45 s), 58 ? C (45 s) and 72 ? 

C (1?5 min). PCR products were purified using Qiaquick (Qiagen; 

www.quiagen.com): 5 ?l of the purified PCR product were used in a 10 ?l cycle 

sequencing reaction using a rhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE 

Applied Biosystems; www.appliedbiosystems.com). Sequences were aligned 

using MEGA 5.0 [70]. The model of molecular evolution that best fitted the data 

was GTR+I+G chosen using MrModeltest 2.3 [71] and haplotype divergence 

was estimated within and between haplogroups using this model. Phylogenetic 

trees were constructed with Bayesian inference (MB) using MrBayes v. 3.2.1. 

x64 [72] with ten million Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) steps [73] with 

25% burn-in to produce posterior probabilities of nodes in the tree. Oligosarcus 

argenteus was used as an outgroup but removed from the final trees. 

Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers XXXXXXX). Tree 

diagrams were produced using FigTree 1.4.0.

3. RESULTS 

3.1 MORPHOLOGY 
 Astyanax giton was characterized by a total length 67.96 to 92.45 mm, 

height 20.05 to 30 mm, 5 to 6.5 (one with 7) scales above the lateral line, 4 to 6 

(one with 6.5) scales below the lateral line, 31 to 39 (most 33 to 38) scales on 

the lateral line, 16 to 21 (most 18 to 21) rays on the anal fin, 4 (one with 3) to 5 

central dentary teeth, 0 to 3 lateral dentary teeth, 0 to 2 teeth in the maxillary, 2 

to 4 (one with 5) teeth in the first row of the premaxillary and 3 to 5 teeth in the 

second row of the premaxillary and a black vertically elongated humeral spot.  

 Astyanax aff. fasciatus was characterized by a length 70.7 to 116.9 mm, 

height 19 to 34.1 mm, 6 to 7.5 (one with 8) scales above the lateral line, 5 to  6.5 

scales below the lateral line, 35 to 40 scales on the lateral line, 16 to 24 (most 

18 to 24) rays on the anal fin, 3 to 5 central dentary teeth, 0 to 5 lateral dentary 

teeth, 0 to 2 teeth in the maxillary, 3 to 4 (one with 5) teeth in the first row of the 

premaxillary and 3 to 5 teeth in the second row of the premaxillary. A single 

specimen appeared to have one tooth in a third premaxillary row. Most 

specimens of A. aff.fasciatus presented red coloring on the tail fin, which is 

common for this species. Photos of A. aff.fasciatus and A. gitonshowing 

morphology are presented (Figure 2).

3.1.1 PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS 
 There were no significant differences in morphology between fish of the 

same species from each reservoir. Fish of the same species from different 

reservoirs could not be differentiated visually. PCA placed each species slightly 

differently, although overlapped (Figure 3).  

 

 
Figure 3. Principal component analysis (PCA) for Astyanax giton (blue) and 
Astyanax aff. fasciatus (red), combining data from both reservoirs. Most 
important coefficients were length (0.4595), height (-0.56) and aspect ratio 
(0.5554) for component 1 (y-axis) and length (-0.4028), scales below lateral line 
(0.4133), scales on lateral line (0.4919) and anal fin rays (0.456). 

 

3.2 CYTOGENETICS 
 Astyanax giton presented a karyotypic formula of 4m+18sm+22st+6t 

(FN=94) (Figure 4). There were no differences between karyotypes of males 

and females.

tributary of the Doce River Basin. Karyotypic formula: 4m+18sm+22st+6t. 
 

 Astyanax giton presented a secondary constriction in the first 

subtelocentric pair (not visible in all metaphases). NORs were visible in the short 

arms of one submetacentric pair and one subtelocentric pair (Figure 5). C-

banding revealed the presence of heterochromatin in all centromeres and in the 

telomeric regions of the first metacentric pair, two submetacentric pairs and two 

subtelocentric pairs and one telocentric pair. Interstitial markings were visible in 

the long arms of one submetacentric pair (Figure 6).

 Astyanax aff.fasciatus presented a karyotypic formula of 

10m+20sm+12st+6t (FN=90 (Figure 7). There were no differences between 

karyotypes of males and females.

This species had secondary constrictions in the long arms of one 

subtelocentric pair and one telocentric pair. Both secondary constrictions 

coincided with NOR sites and three additional NORs were present in the short 

arms of three submetacentric chromosomes (Figure 8).

bottom photo they are visible in the long arms of one subtelocentric 
chromosome (pair 17) and one telocentric chromosome (pair 24). 
 

C-banding revealed regions of heterochromatin in nearly all centromeres, 

as well as in the telomeric regions of the long arms of the first metacentric pair, 

four submetacentric pairs (plus one in pair 14), two subtelocentric pairs and all 

three telocentric pairs. Interstitial markings were visible in the long arms of one 

subtelocentric chromosome of the 20th pair (Figure 9a). A distinctive interstitial 

heterochromatin band is visible in one subtelocentric chromosome. 

Flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed hybridization of the 28S 

probes (marked in red) in the short arms of two subtelocentric/telocentric pairs 

and in the centromeric region of one metacentric pair. 5S probes (green) were 



35 
 

visible in the short arms of one telocentric pair and the centromeres of one 

metacentric pair.

3.3 B CHROMOSOMES 
 Supernumerary (b) chromosomes were found in five fish, one Astyanax 

aff. fasciatus and four A. giton, including the only male of this species, all from 

Reservoir 1 (Table 3). All B chromosomes were micro except in one A. giton that 

had a macro B chromosome resembling the first metacentric pair. The Astyanax 

aff.fasciatus had one metaphase with a single B chromosome and a second with 

two B chromosomes and was the only specimen to present more than one 

supernumerary chromosome.

 Four out of 30 A. giton (13.3%) and one out of 30 Astyanax aff. fasciatus 

contained B chromosomes (3.3%) (Figures 10 and 11, respectively). 

Morphologically, CT 3003 and CT 3005 were unique among A. giton in 

presenting a red anal fin and were the only female specimens of this species to 

have a micro B chromosome.

3.4 MOLECULAR DNA 
 Based on mitochondrial data, the species morphologically similar to 

A.giton grouped with A. giton from the nearby Sossego Dam (Viçosa, Minas 

Gerais State, Brazil) while those resembling Astyanax aff.fasciatus grouped with 

A. fasciatus and A. parahybae, a species similar to A. fasciatus but found only in 

the Rio Paraíba do Sul, where A. fasciatus is absent (Figure 12). 

 
Figure 12. Phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA trees using the gene COI 
with 34 fish samples from various basins. Astyanax giton from the UFV 
reservoirs are in the same clade as A. giton from Sossego Dam. Astyanax aff. 
fasciatus forms a very supported clade with A. parahybae and A. fasciatus.

4. DISCUSSION 
 The Neotropical freshwater fish fauna has long been considered the 
richest in the world [59], the result of a long evolutionary history of isolation and 

specialization [46]. Freshwater fishes are highly suitable for the recovery of past 

biogeographic processes and indicators of past paleohydrology [59], due to their 

obligatory relationship with water [46], as related forms can only occur in 

isolated basins if the water bodies were connected in the past. 

 Coastal and continental drainages may shared such a past connection, 

based on cytogenetic evidence from H. malabaricus, which presents seven 

similar cytotypes between the Ivaí, Iguaçu, Tibagi and Ribeira do Iguape rivers. 

Stocks of Astyanax aff. fasciatus from the Furnas region might also represent 

evidence of prior connection between basins [9]. 

 The geologic evolution of the chain of high mountains associated with the 

eastern limits of the Brazilian Shield allow vicariance and isolation of fish 

species [58]. The Atlantic drainages (Doce, Paraíba do Sul and Ribeira) have 

existed since the break-up of Gondwanaland [46]. They include (from North to 

South) the Paraguaçu, Contas, Pardo and Doce rivers. These rivers have a 

large branching system of headwaters adjacent to the eastern headwaters of the 

São Francisco. Among these drainages are numerous smaller drainages that 

have no contact with the São Francisco Basin [58]. 

 During periods of low sea level, the coastal plane and associated river 

basins were more extensive, with coastal fish species able to disperse and 

occupy extensive areas. Populations occupying different coastal subbasins 

became isolated due to repeated episodes of sea level rise, resulting in 

speciation and population differentiation [58] Studies of fish fauna from the Doce 

river show phylogenetically related fauna in the coastal and continental basins, 

although the exact causes of these relationships are not always clear [46] 

 Compared to Amazonian Rivers, eastern costal drainages are 

characterized by relatively low diversity but considered a biogeographical unit 

[59] due to high levels of endemism, with 95% of species considered endemic 

[58]. Most species associated with the eastern margin of the Brazilian shield are 



40 
 

endemics of either coastal or inland basins, a few species occurring on both 

sides of the watershed divide. species occurring on both sides of the main 

watershed divide (e.g. Astyanax fasciatus) are said to have a "pattern C" type of 

geographic distribution [58], which includes stream piracy between coastal and 

crystalline Brazilian shield rivers [76]Astyanax taeniatus, a coastal freshwater 

fish, reaches the northern limit of its distribution range in the Mucuri and 

Jucuruçu rivers [59] 

 Most species inhabiting the high mountain stream Guaratuba do not 

occur elsewhere, but one exception is A. paranae, which is common in the 

upper headwaters of the Tietê. This could be due to either erosion or tectonic 

fault reactivation [58]. Astyanax altiparanae is present in the coastal upper Rio 

Itatinga as well as the upper Tietê, presumably the result of stream capture by 

erosion. This species is often cited as being endemic to the upper Paraná, but 

has a vicariant form A. lacustris that inhabits the São Francisco basin. 

Morphological characters of both species are variable and overlapping [58].  

 The area north of the mouth of the Doce River is composed of beach 

ridges, deltas, sea cliffs and sandstone reefs, geologic structures that could 

divide fish populations [59]. Bathymetric surveys of this area show that various 

channels converge on the Abrolhos depression. The Pleistocene lagoons are 

delimited to the south by the mouth of the Doce River and to the north by the 

Abrolhos Formation. Along with A. fasciatus, the trahira, Hoplias malabaricus 

has one of the largest distributional ranges, occurring from Panamá to the 

Buenos Aires Province in Argentina [46]. 

 In the case of Hoplias malabaricus, closely related haplotypes were found 

in the Doce and São Mateus rivers, the latter located in Espírito Santo State, 

Brazil. Samples from coastal basins presented a sister group relationship with 

haplotypes from these two rivers, but not with the Rio Grande or São Francisco 

[46]. Haplotypes of H. malabaricus from the Itanhem and Jucurussu rivers show 

a close phylogenetic relationship, supporting a more recent common 

palaeohydrological history involving basins within this region [59]. Molecular 



41 
 

data indicate no evidence of genetic exchange between the Doce and Para?ba 

do Sul river populations of H. malabaricus during glacial periods [59] 

 The lack of data on geographic distributions and phylogeny of Neotropical 

freshwater fishes make it difficult to formulate hypotheses of biogeographic 

histories [56]. One possibility is that species of widespread distribution are 

relatively ancient, with spatial continuity broken by recent events of marine 

transgression (explaining the slight differences in Astyanax across basins). 

Species of restricted distribution may be also be related to these events. 

 
4.1 MORPHOLOGY 
 The systematics of Astyanax are poorly understood, with the Atlantic 

Rainforest region containing several undescribed species [77]. Some "species" 

of this genus are widespread but vary geographically. Phylogenetic and 

taxonomic relationships among these fishes, as well as those of limited 

distribution, are not well known. Previous studies of Astyanax relied on 

morphological characters such as dentition, lateral line scales, tail fin and 

osteology [56]. As the species of Astyanax are morphologically similar, however, 

it has been difficult to separate them based on this criteria.  

Based on morphological characters, Professor Vinicius de Araújo Bertaco 

at the Universidade Federal de Rio Grande do Sul confirmed our identification of 

A. giton, based on the key of Melo [56] that describes this species as follows: 

Dentary teeth gradually decrease in size from the symphysis, differentiating this 

species from A. scabripinnis. with the base of the teeth in the dentary and 

internal series of the premaxillar being thin. The central cuspid is approximately 

the same size as the side cuspids, with the maximum number of cuspids 

exceeding 8. The interopercular does not expand further and does not cover a 

portion of the sub-opercular. Body height is 28.9 to 37.4% of the pattern length, 

with 34 to 39 scales on the lateral line, with a rounded naked area between the 

second and third infra-orbital. 

 Eigenmann differentiated A. fasciatus parahybae from A. fasciatus by the 

presence of a series of scales below the lateral line deflected toward the anal fin 



42 
 

by the interpolation of supplementary series. Astyanax fasciatus parahybae also 

has a head of 4.25 to 4.44; depth of 2.5 to 2.66; 27 to 34 (usually 31 or 32) rays 

in the anal fin, a lateral line with 37 to 41 (usually 39 or 40) rays. an eye equal to 

the interorbital; one maxillary tooth; 4 to 5 teeth in the outer row of the 

premaxillary in a 2:1 ratio[3]. Melo also identified A. parahybae as having 

irregularly placed scales above the anal fin and the anal fin having 29 or more 

rays, both of which differentiate this species from A. fasciatus and definitively 

separate it from the A. fasciatus complex[56]. 

 According to Eigenmann, when A. fasciatus, A. scabripinnis and A. 

taeniatus are found together in the same river it is possible to differentiate one 

from another, but across different rivers and basins each undergoes so many 

modifications it is impossible to clearly define them morphologically [3]. 

Astyanax taeniatus in one river could be confused for A. scabripinnis, A. 

fasciatus, A. giton or A. intermedius in another. Lütken described both A. 

taeniatus and A. scabripinnis as A. scabripinnis rivularis. Jenyns recognized A. 

taeniatus as an intermediate form of A. scabripinnis. Bertaco recognized A. 

fasciatus as A. intermedius. Eigenmann described A. intermedius as the center 

of a triangle formed by A. scabripinnis, A. fasciatus and A. taeniatus. 

 Species assigned to Astyanax are not a monophyletic entity [8,78]. 

Current definition relies on morphological characters such as two rows or teeth 

in the premaxillary, a complete lateral line and the presence of a caudal fin, 

which are widespread in Characidae [3]. Astyanax intermedius has been 

included in the Astyanax scabripinnis species complex [78]. Astyanax 

intermedius has a humeral spot similar in form to A. microschemos; however A. 

intermedius is distinguished from this species by having a larger interorbital 

width (29.7-34.1% vs. 32.5-47.8%) 

 Astyanax giton is most easily distinguished from A. fasciatus by the 

presence of a vertically elongate black humeral spot. Astyanax fasciatus 

presents a less conspicuous humeral spot, with the differences being most 

pronounced after the fish have been fixed in alcohol. Body shape also differs 

between these fish, with A. giton on average having a deeper body while A. 



43 
 

fasciatus is more elongate. The median aspect ratios (length/height) for A. giton 

and A. fasciatus were 3.46 and 3.80. Both species were differentiated by PCA, 

concordant with Eigenmann's statement that fish of Astyanax can often be 

differentiated from one another only in larger samples [3]. The sex ratio for A. 

giton from the UFV reservoirs (1 out of 32) was consistent with data from 

Sossego Lake, where 8 males and 171 females were captured [2]. 

 

4.2 CYTOGENETICS 
 The cytogenetics of A. giton from the UFV Reservoirs and the Sossego 

Dam differ. Although both present a diploid number of 2n=50, the karyotype of 

A. giton from Sossego was 6m+8sm+24st+12t and FN=88 [2]. This population 

presented multiple heterochromatic markings with C-banding and DAPI, mostly 

on the small arms of the submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes. A 

faint marking also visible on the centromeric region of the largest metacentric 

chromosome. C-banding showed heterochromatin in four chromosome pairs, 

including a subtelocentric chromosome with bitelomeric markings. Giemsa-

stained C-banding matched 18S rDNA flouresence patterns, with this probe also 

showing markings in the telomeric portions of the largest metacentric pair. The 

NORs were present in two subtelocentric chromosomes that appear similar to 

the two NOR-bearing chromosomes of the A. giton studied here. Only one pair 

of chromosomes was marked with the 5S rDNA probe in the Sossego Dam [2]. 

 Astyanax giton from the two reservoirs present 22 subtelocentric and 12 

telocentric chromosomes, differing slightly from the Sossego population which 

had 24 subtelocentrics and 12 telocentrics. These populations contrast with the 

many (28-32) telocentric chromosomes in populations from the Paraíba do Sul 

River Basin [4], similar to A. intermedius, A. ribeirae and populations of A. 

hastatus and A. scabripinnis from coastal rivers, all of which have 34 and 38 

subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes [60]. Although both populations of 

A. giton from the Doce River present many more subtelocentrics than those from 

the Paraíba do Sul, the combined totals are still within the range of combined 

subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes. 



44 
 

 However, A. giton from both the Paraíba do Sul River and Sossego Dam 

both present one pair of NORs and 10 chromosomes bearing 18S rDNA 

clusters[5], although the A. giton from Paraíba do Sul also contain several 

chromosomes bearing 5S clusters [2]. Additionally, the Sossego Dam contains 

triploid A. giton (3n=75) that were not observed in the UFV Reservoirs. There 

are at least six species of Astyanax with triploid individuals:A. eigenmanniorum, 

A. scabripinnis, A. schubarti, Astyanax aff. fasciatus (from the Tibagi River in 

Vila Velha, Paraná State, Brazil), Astyanax sp. D [9] and A. giton (from the 

Sossego Dam in the Doce River Basin, Minas Gerais State, Brazil) [2]. Some 

triploid A. scabripinnis also carry B chromosomes [9]. 

 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporting of this macro 

metacentric B in A. giton. As the size and morphology of the macro B are similar 

to those of supernumerary chromosomes in A. fasciatus, A. scabripinnis, A. 

eigenmanniorum, A. schubarti and A. bockmanni, it is possible that this B 

chromosome predates these speciation events [32-36]; however, the 

morphology of a supernumerary chromosome is not necessarily indicative of its 

origin [25,27]. 

As there was no evidence of hybridization between the species, the B 

chromosomes could have arisen from the A set or an ancient event of hybrid 

introgression. B chromosomes were rare in the Astyanax studied from these 

reservoirs, with only 20 out of 1,700 (1.2%) metaphases containing any 

supernumerary chromosomes. Because of their rarity, the B chromosomes 

could not be tested for banding or heterochromatin, nor linked to males or 

females in particular. The A. giton with the metacentric macro B was stained for 

NOR, but the B did not present markings. Attempts to stain slides containing 

male gonads with Giemsa were inconclusive as chromosome morphology could 

not be determined. 

 The chromosomal change rate in Astyanax is calculated at e = 3.582. 

Using mtDNA, this genus has a divergence time of about 19 My, with 

remarkable radiation during the last 5My, especially within Astyanax fasciatus, 

which presents the shortest divergence time. The rate of karyotypic evolution is 



45 
 

higher than other Characiformes, with speciation events resulting from 

pericentric inversions, heterochromatin redistribution and Robertsonion 

rearrangements [79].  

 Astyanax fasciatus from Araras, São Paulo State, Brazil, in the Mogi-

Guaçu River Basin (part of the Paraná River System) were studied 

cytogenetically [80]. This population presented a diploid number of 2n=48 and a 

karyotype of 8m+22sm+12st+6t, FN=90 -- the closest published karyotype to A. 

aff.fasciatus of the Doce River (10sm+20sm+12st+6A, FN=90). 

 NORs are highly variable among Astyanax fasciatus, with cytotypes in the 

Mogi-Guaçu River ranging from two to eight NOR sites [13]. In A. aff. fasciatus 

from the reservoirs, NORs were found in the terminal regions of the short arms 

of three submetacentric chromosomes, as well as in the terminal regions of the 

long arms of one subtelocentric and one telocentric chromosome, the latter two 

coincident with secondary constrictions. NORs in the terminal regions of the 

short arms of two submetacentric chromosomes (with size polymorphism) were 

observed in the Araguari River, a population with a diploid number of 2n=46 and 

a karyotype of 14m+16sm+10st+6t (FN=86) [18]. These NOR sites were also 

observed in A. fasciatus from the Upper Paraná River [7]. The Araras population 

had two NORs, in the distal region of the long arms of a pair of telocentric 

chromosomes [80], similar to those found in the subtelocentric and telocentric 

chromosomes from A. aff.fasciatusin the Doce River. 

 C-Banding in A. aff.fasciatus presented heterochromatin in nearly all 

centromeres, telomeric regions of long arms of 1st metacentric pair, four 

submetacentric pairs (plus one in pair 14), two subtelocentric pairs and all three 

telocentric pairs. Interstitial heterochromatin bandings were visible in long arms 

of one subtelocentric chromosome of the 20th pair. The Araras population was 

similar constitutive heterochromatin (C-Banding) in the distal regions of long 

arms of submetacentric, subtelocentric and telocentric chromosmes, and short 

arms of some other chromosomes. 

 Astyanx fasciatus from the Mogi-Guaçu river presented constitutive 

heterochromatin in terminal regions on long arms of sm, st, t and terminal 



46 
 

regions of short arms of sm chromosomes in both 48/46, which are GC-rich and 

contain NORs [16]. The regions from the long arms of the sm, st and t terminal 

regions were coincident with data from A. aff.fasciatus. Similar markings among 

the Mogi-Guaçu cytotypes indicate the proximity of these linages and a recent 

divergence. Different cytotypes may cause reproductive isolation, although this 

does not appear to be the case given the presence of 2n=47 and 2n=45 

specimens [13].  

 FISH in A. aff.fasciatus from the Doce River presented 5S markings in the 

short arms of one telocentric pair and the centromeres of one metacentric pair, 

and 28S markings in the short arms of two subtelocentric/telocentric pairs and 

the centromere of one metacentric chromosome. 28S and 18S probes hybridize 

at the same sites and may therefore be compared across populations and 

species. 

 Specimens of A. fasciatus from the Upper Paraná present 28S markers in 

the distal portion of the short arms of two submetacentric chromosomes and 5S 

markers in the pericentric region of two metacentric (similar to A. aff. fasciatus 

from the Doce River) and in two telocentric chromosomes, colocalized with 28S 

in the two metacentric and telocentric chromosomes [7].  

 Several species of Astyanax including A. altiparanae, A. lacustris, A. 

fasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis show conserved localization of 

5S/28S markers between species, indicating a close phylogenetic relationship 

[7] and 5S can be seen in more than one pair [24]. NORs are almost always 

fewer than regions detected by FISH, because some 5S genes are associated 

with rDNA genes that do not form a nucleolus because the gene sequences 

were too small to be detected [7]. These 5S locations are absent in A. giton and 

A. intermedius, suggesting polyphyly or divergence within this genus [13]. 

Astyanax fasciatus from the Paraná and Paraíba do Sul basins have a 5S rDNA 

cluster in the distal region of a metacentric chromosome [4,7].  

 In A. fasciatus from the Mogi-Guaçu River, FISH 18S markers were 

located in the NORs [13]. Other fluorescent markings were smaller, always 

telomeric and located in subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, consistent 



47 
 

with some of the markings observed for A. aff.fasciatus. All cytotypes from the 

Mogi-Guaçu had a ribosomal site on the subterminal region of the short arm of 

one submetacentric pair and 5S markings in the pericentromeric region of the 

short arms of one telocentric pair [13], also observed in A. aff.fasciatus from the 

Doce River. 

 In the Araras population of A. fasciatus, FISH revealed two chromosomes 

pairs with 5S, one at the pericentromeric region of one metacentric chromosome 

and the other at the proximal region of a telocentric chromosome, exactly like A. 

aff.fasciatus from the Doce River. Also in Araras, three submetacentric 

chromosomes presented 18S markings, two in the terminal region of the short 

arm and one in the terminal region of the long arm.  

 The first two 18S sites coincide with Ag-NOR in A. aff.fasciatus from the 

Doce River, but 28S/18S probes did not hybridize at these sites. Although 

homology with the original gene sequence of A. fasciatus from Araras should be 

sufficeint to hybridize with the rDNA probe, in A. aff. fasciatus they may no 

longer represent an active gene or functional gene product and therefore no 

longer present an Ag-NOR [9]. This may occur if mutations if mutations have 

resulted in pseudogenes or functionless sequences (as observed in H. 

malabaricus). Although the 28S sites in A. aff.fasciatus did not coincide with 

those of Ag-Nor, one on the metacentric chromosome did correspond to C-

banding.  

 A single chromosomal pair bearing 5S DNA, often interstitially (known as 

marker chromosomes) is observed in several Astyanax and probably ancestral 

for this group. A second pair is also found in A. scabripinnis, A. parahybae, A. 

schubarti and A. fasciatus[9]. Other Astyanax, however, present several 

chromosomes bearing 5S but lack the marker pair, as is the case of A. giton, A. 

intermedius, A. janeiroensis, A. ribeirae and A. fasciatus from the Doce River, 

indicating these may have been lost in coastal populations [9,60]. 

 CT 3005 and CT 3003 were the only female A. giton to have both a red 

anal fin and a micro B chromosome. Although it is possible these traits may be 



48 
 

correlated, a much larger sample size and sequencing of the B chromosomes 

would be necessary to draw such a conclusion and determine their origin. 

 Astyanax fasciatus is known to occupy main river channels and form 

large shoals with migratory habits; therefore it is less susceptible to barriers to 

gene flow than other species of this genus [31,32]. Therefore it may have more 

opportunities to hybridize and pick up B chromosomes from interspecific 

crosses. Metaphases containing B chromosomes are shown (Figures 8 and 9). 

Astyanax altiparanae is one of the most widely distributed groups of this genus, 

closely related to A. aff. bimaculatus. These species are morphologically similar 

because of the elliptic humeral spot and yellow tail [21]. Astyanax altiparanae 

from the Tietê and Paranapanema rivers have diploid numbers of 2n=50. 

Karyotypes differ, with multiple cytotypes occurring in sympatry, indicating A. 

altiparanae is a species complex. Hybridization has not been reported and 

distinct cytotypes may represent operational taxonomic units, or cryptic species. 

 However, molecular data indicate they are a monophyletic group despite 

population-specific haplotypes, with the populations being neither very diverse 

nor distant genetically [21]. All populations have one pair of NORs, in the 

terminal portions of either the long or short arms of subtelocentric or telocentric 

pairs, depending on the population, similar to A. bimaculatus[21]. C-Banding 

was present in the terminal and interstitial regions of several chromosomes. 18S 

rDNA was present in multiple sites (two to four), located in the terminal portions 

of subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, except for one site in the 

terminal portion of the short arms of a single metacentric chromosome of the 

first pair from the Pilar do Sul River in São Paulo State, Brazil[21]. FISH with 5S 

revealed two interstitial sites on metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. 

These two sites are common to A. bockmanni, A. fasciatus [60], A. parahybae, 

A. scabripinnis and A. schubarti [21]. With the addition of A. eigenmanniorum, 

these are also the same species that feature the large metacentric B 

chromosome found in A. giton from these reservoirs.  

 



49 
 

4.3 MOLECULAR DNA 
 Based on mitochondrial DNA, the A. giton from the two reservoirs are 

identical to those of Sossego Dam. One difference between these populations, 

however, is that the A. giton from Sossego are hybridizing with Oligosarcus 

argenteus, but no hybrids were found at either reservoir despite the presence 

this genus. If hybridization were advantageous it would presumably occur in 

both lakes; if disadvantageous, Astyanax and Oligosarcus should be good 

species and not interbreed. It may be that the species have adapted different 

strategies based on conditions unique to each area, as the size of the water 

system may drive evolution through physical, chemical and biotic populational 

barriers [37].  It is also possible that the B chromosomes found in A. giton are 

the result of a past hybridization event, either with Oligosarcus argenteus or 

another species. As B chromosomes are heteropycnotic (i.e., they do not pair 

with the a set) interspecific interactions may be sufficient that chromosomes that 

cannot pair will evolve as Bs [27].  

 Molecular data place A. aff.fasciatus completely in the same clade as A. 

fasciatus and A. parahybae. As stated by Eigenmann, A. parahybae may be a 

distinct form of A. fasciatus in the Paraíba do Sul River, where A. fasciatus is 

absent, the result of lineages being isolated in rivers on the eastern coastal 

basins [3,58], although it is currently defined as a separate species [9,56]. 

 When populations present similar morphology and molecular data but 

differ by cytotype, the question arises whether or not to treat them as distinct 

species. In a study of four populations of A. hastatus from the Guapimirim River 

Basin (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, three cyotypes were found, all 2n=50 [41]. 

These were considered a group of cryptic species, not species complexes, 

because each cytotype could be precisely identified and biological boundaries 

among analyzed specimens were supported by cytogenetic markers, revealing a 

lack of interbreeding and hybrid forms. The cytotypes could not be differentiated 

through morphometric analysis [41]. According to the Darwinian species concept 

(species recognized as morphological and genotypic cluster) these cannot be 

considered individual species. According to biological concept of Mayr, however, 



50 
 

they should correspond to real species since distinct karyotypes found with 

limited gene flow but no evidence of hybridization. This type of analysis could be 

applied to A. fasciatus and A. giton. 

 

5. CONCLUSION 
 Two species of Astyanax from the Doce River were analyzed using 

morphological, cytogenetic and molecular techniques. All characters indicate 

these fish are A. giton and Astyanax aff.fasciatus. Morphological characters 

overlap but may be differentiated using statistical analysis. Diploid numbers 

were consistent with those previously documented for these species but 

chromosome morphology differ. Astyanax giton may be a species complex 

based on a new karyotype occurring in the Doce River basin and the presence 

of B chromosomes. The mtDNA fragment COI indicates these fish are in 

separate clades. Follow-up studies could include a comparison of Astyanax 

aff.fasciatus with populations of A. fasciatus and A. parahybae, testing the idea 

of species complexes versus cryptic species and sequencing the supernumerary 

B chromosomes of both species.
