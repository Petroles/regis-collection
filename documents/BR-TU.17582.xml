Resumo 
 
 

O principal objectivo deste estudo foi avaliar o estado de actividade de alguns 
vulcões de lama do Golfo de Cádiz, especificamente no que diz respeito a um 
processo biogeoquímico extremamente importante: oxidação anaeróbia do
metano. Este processo é mediado por microrganismos e ocorre em associação 
com a  redução de sulfato, sendo também responsável pelo consumo de 
quantidades significativas de metano em sedimentos marinhos que, de outra
forma, seriam libertadas para a hidrosfera e, consequentemente para a
atmosfera, contribuindo para o agravamento do efeito de estufa. Durante o 
cruzeiro SONNE-175 GAP (Gibraltar Arc Processes), foram recolhidas
amostras de sedimentos através de multicores e gravity cores, tendo em vista 
a realização de análises biogeoquímicas. No trabalho aqui exposto, usaram-se 
amostras de cinco vulcões de lama: Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim Ginsburg, 
Gemini e No Name. Foram analisados os seguintes parâmetros geoquímicos:
metano, sulfato, sulfeto e hidrocarbonetos C2+; os perfis obtidos da análise das 
concentrações destes compostos revelaram a existência de uma zona bem 
definida nos sedimentos sub-superficiais, na qual ocorre o consumo total do
metano e do sulfato, bem como o consumo de hidrocarbonetos mais pesados
(zona de transição sulfato-metano). Esta particularidade também foi 
confirmada pela medição de taxas de oxidação anaeróbia de metano e de 
taxas de redução de sulfato, as quais evidenciaram o acoplamento dos dois
processos, apesar das taxas de redução de sulfato serem, geralmente, mais
elevadas. As baixas taxas de oxidação anaeróbia de metano, relativamente às 
taxas de redução do sulfato, bem como o consumo de hidrocarbonetos na 
zona de transição sulfato-metano, evidenciam que em alguns vulcões de lama, 
a redução do sulfato ocorre acoplada não só à oxidação de metano mas
também de outros hidrocarbonetos mais pesados.  
Foram também levadas a cabo análises de biomarcadores lipídicos, bem como 
análises de isótopos estáveis de carbono (?13C), de forma a identificar 
taxonomicamente os organismos envolvidos no consumo do metano. Estas
análises revelaram concentrações elevadas de lípidos provenientes de
membranas de archaea e de bactérias redutoras de sulfato. Por outro lado, os 
valores reduzidos de ?13C na zona de transição sulfato-metano, indicam que a 
oxidação anaeróbia do metano é mediada por um consórcio microbiano 
protagonizado por archaea e bactérias redutoras de sulfato. Adicionalmente, a
presença de lípidos em carbonatos autigénicos dos vulcões de lama
Hesperides e Faro, sugerem a influência da oxidação anaeróbia do metano na 
sua precipitação. No entanto, os dados disponíveis apontam para a 
possibilidade de variações ambientais poderem influenciar a diversidade das
comunidades metanotróficas, tal como é demonstrado pelas abundâncias
relativas em diferentes vulcões de lama dos biomarcadores archaeol e sn2-
hidroxiarchaeol, e dos ácidos gordos bacterianos,  i-C15:0, ai-C15:0; C16:1?5 e
cyC17:0?5,6.

Abstract 
 

The main goal of this study was to assess the state of activity of some of the 
Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, concerning a very important biogeochemical 
process: anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This process, mediated by 
microbial organisms, occurs coupled to sulphate reduction and is responsible 
for the consumption of significant amounts of methane within marine
sediments, which would otherwise be released to the atmosphere, contributing
to the greenhouse effect. During the SONNE-175 GAP Cruise (Nov/Dec 2003) 
several gravity cores and multi-cores of sediments from Gulf of Cadiz mud 
volcanoes were recovered for further biogeochemical analysis. In the scope of 
the present work sediment cores from five mud volcanoes (Captain Arutyunov, 
Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and No Name) were analysed. Several 
geochemical parameters were measured, such as methane, sulphate, sulphide 
and C2+ compounds, showing a sharp sulphate-methane transition zone and
revealing the consumption of methane and sulphate within the sediment and 
also the consumption of higher hydrocarbons. This was also confirmed by 
anaerobic oxidation of methane and sulphate reduction rate measurements,
which indicate a coupling of the two processes, although sulphate reduction is
generally higher than anaerobic oxidation of methane. Low anaerobic oxidation 
of methane rates relatively to sulphate reduction rates, as well as the C2+
hydrocarbons concentration profiles, suggests that in some mud volcanoes, 
sulphate reduction is not only coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane  but
also to anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons.  
Lipid biomarker and carbon isotope analysis were also carried out, in order to
identify chemotaxonomically the organisms involved in the consumption of
methane. High concentrations of lipid biomarkers associated with specific 
archaeal and bacterial membrane lipids and the low ?13C signatures at the 
sulphate-methane transition zone, indicate that AOM is mediated by a microbial
community of archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria. Furthermore, the
presence of lipids in authigenic carbonates from the Hesperides and the Faro 
mud volcanoes show the influence of anaerobic oxidation of methane in their
precipitation. However, the available data suggest that differences in 
environmental settings appear to influence the biodiversity of the 
methanotrophic communities, as it is shown by the different relative 
abundances of the archaeal biomarkers archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, 
and the bacterial fatty acids, i-C15:0, ai-C15:0; C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6, in different 
mud volcanoes.

I.1 – Nature and scope of this work 

Mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz were discovered for the first time in the 

Moroccan Sector in 1999, during the TTR-9 cruise coordinated by Dr. Joan Gardner from 

the Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC), in the framework of the TTR program, 

coordinated by Prof. Michael Ivanov from the University of Moscow, with the participation 

of a Portuguese team from the Marine Geology Department of the Mining and Geology 

Institute and from the Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro. Since then, the 

Gulf of Cadiz has been extensively surveyed with geophysical methods and sampling. 

Several scientific cruises revealed the existence of a large number of fluid escape 

structures and allowed a great advance in the understanding of the tectonic, structural and 

geochemical framework of the area. In 2000, during the TTR-10 cruise (INGMAR project , 

PLE/4/98, FCT), the first mud volcanoes in the Portuguese sector were discovered 

(Pinheiro et al., in IOC, 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003). 

The work presented here focuses on anaerobic consumption of methane in marine 

sub-surface sediments by a consortium of marine microbes, trough a biogeochemical 

process known as anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This process occurs coupled 

with another biogeochemical process: sulphate reduction (SR).  

The occurrence of AOM is of extreme importance and constitutes an unelectable 

sink in the global carbon cycle, because this biogeochemical process interrupts methane 

efflux in marine sediments, preventing it from rising to the hydrosphere and, consequently, 

to the atmosphere.  

This work is part of the MVSEIS project: tectonic control, deep crustal structure 

and fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcano field (01-LEC-EMA24F, 

European Science Foundation), an European project coordinated by L.M. Pinheiro. It is 

integrated in one of the project sub-themes: fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

This study was also supported by the Portuguese-German Joint Action: 

Geosphere/Biosphere Coupling Processes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Reference: A-15/04 

coordintaed by A. Boetius and L.M. Pinheiro), which was financed by CRUP (Board of

Service).  

 

I.2 – Aims of this study 

The main goal of this work is to assess the present state of the biogeochemical 

activity of several mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz, trough the detection, location 

and quantification of the biogeochemical process responsible for the consumption of 

methane, which is the most abundant gas in the mud volcanoes sediments from this area. 

It is very important to know the present state of activity of a mud volcano field, due to the 

associated high potential for release of methane as a powerful greenhouse gas. 

 

This thesis also addresses several other important questions:  

? What is anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM)? 

? What is the relation between anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate 

reduction (SR)? 

? Which are the best methods and tools to study anaerobic oxidation of methane 

(AOM)? 

? Is anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz mud 

volcanoes sediments? 

If so: 

· What are the rates at which anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and 

sulphate reduction (SR) are occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz? 

· What is the ratio between anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and 

sulphate reduction (SR) in the sub-surface sediments in the Gulf of Cadiz? 

· Which microorganisms are involved in these processes?  

· How significant is the present day mud volcano activity in the Gulf of Cadiz 

compared to other similar systems? 

 

I.3 – Database

of the University of Bremen - Germany, who gently made the samples available for this 

study in the framework of the collaboration with the MVSEIS Project. This cruise took 

place on board of the German research vessel SONNE in December 2003.   

The sediment samples used for biogeochemical analysis where retrieved by TV-

guided multi-coring, and also by gravity coring, in order to obtain longer cores and deeper 

sediment samples. These were collected by Vitor Magalhães and Helge Niemann, both 

PhD students (at the time), who also integrate the Portuguese-German Joint Action A-

15/04 (Boetius/Pinheiro). 

The biogeochemical laboratory analyses were carried out at the Max Planck 

Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen – Germany, under the supervision of Prof. 

Antje Boetius and Helge Niemann. 

The geophysical and bathymetric data were provided by the Marine Geophysics 

Laboratory of the University of Aveiro and by the Marine Geology Department of the 

Portuguese Geological and Mining Institute. 

 

I.4 – Methodology 

This work was organized in three main phases. 

? Bibliographic research: 

This included a compilation of the published work in an Endnote reference 

database and the definition of the state of the art on the following topics: 

? Mud volcanism. 

? Gulf of Cadiz geology (evolution, tectonics and structure). 

? Anaerobic oxidation of methane. 

? Sulphate reduction. 

? Laboratory procedures used in biogeochemical analysis. 

? Laboratory work: 

On March 2004, the laboratory work, which was carried out for a period of 

approximately 5 months was started. Initially, geochemical parameters were measured 

(methane, sulphate and C2+ compounds). This was followed by, ex situ AOM and SR rate 

measurements, based on the evidence, given by the geochemical profiles, that methane, 



CChhaapptteerr  II  
 

22 

C2+ compounds and sulphate were being consumed simultaneously at the same depth 

interval. Then, based on these results (geochemical and AOM/SR rate profiles), the 

samples from the studied mud volcanoes that revealed the highest activity based on the 

geochemical profiles (Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes) were chosen for 

biomarker analysis. This type of analysis was used to identify taxonomically the organisms 

involved in AOM and SR. 

? Interpretation and Conclusions: 

Finally, all the data obtained from the laboratory work was plotted, interpreted as 

whole and compared with other similar well known systems. The main conclusions were 

obtained and the thesis was written. A joint paper was also written and submitted to the 

international scientific journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (Niemann et al., 

submitted; Appendix IV: Publications and communications on the framework of the 

present work).

This chapter gives an overview of some of the key issues and current research 

concerning fluid seepage, biogeochemical processes and methane consumption in marine 

sediments. These include: the occurrence of methane, gas hydrates and fluid escape 

structures at continental margins, anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), sulphate 

reduction (SR) and respective rates, and the identification of the microorganisms involved 

in these processes. 

 

II.1 – Methane in nature 

Carbon can form more compounds than any other chemical element, since carbon 

atoms are not only able to form double and triple carbon-carbon bonds, but are also 

capable of bonding each other in linear and/or ramified chains (Chang, 1994). The basic 

molecules which are at the basis of any organic compound are hydrocarbons, which are 

composed of carbon and hydrogen. In hydrocarbons, the carbon atoms form the 

backbone of the molecule and the hydrogen atoms are attached to that backbone. There 

are three types of hydrocarbons: 

? Aromatic hydrocarbons: these, independently of the number of bonds, 
have at least one aromatic ring, formed by one or more planar sets of six carbon atoms, 

connected by electrons. The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (figure II-1A). 

? Saturated hydrocarbons, alkanes or aliphatic hydrocarbons: these do 
not have any double or triple bond or an aromatic ring. These molecules have the 

maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms, and therefore have no double bonds 

(saturated). Methane is an example of a saturated hydrocarbon. Methane molecule has 

one carbon atom linked to four hydrogen atoms by single bonds (figure II-1B). 

? Unsaturated hydrocarbons: these have one or more double (alkenes) or 
triple bonds (alkynes) between carbon atoms. Ethene is the simplest alkene in nature 

(figure II-1C).

hydrocarbon (C6H6) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene); B – Methane molecule structure, the 
simplest saturated hydrocarbon (CH4); C – Structure of ethene, which is the simplest unsaturated 
hydrocarbons, where one double bond between carbon atoms is present (C2H4). 

 

Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon in nature. It belongs to the saturated 

hydrocarbons group and its chemical formula is CH4 (figure II-1B). It is colorless, odorless 

and it has a wide distribution in nature. It is the main component of natural gas, which is a 

mixture of methane and higher hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane, etc.). At room 

temperature, methane is less dense than air. Its solid phase has a melting point at a 

temperature of approximately -182,5 ºC and it boils at approximately -161,6 ºC; it is 

therefore a gas at room temperature. The methane molecule is non-polar, which explains 

its low solubility in water. 

Once in the atmosphere, methane has the capability to absorb terrestrial infrared 

radiation that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Therefore, methane is a 

greenhouse gas with the singularity of having a global warming potential 21 times more 

powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2). In other words, methane has a much higher ability to 

trap heat in the terrestrial atmosphere than any other gas.  

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) , since 

1750, global averages of atmospheric methane have raised more than 150 percent, from 

approximately 700 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) to 1745 ppbv in 1998. They have

shown that methane has a great variety of sources: human related sources 

(anthropogenic), natural sources and geological sources (figure II-2): 

 

Human related (anthropogenic) sources of methane 

? Decomposition of organic wastes (landfills): methane is generated as result of waste 

decomposing under anaerobic conditions.   

? Natural gas / oil exploration and coal mining: methane escapes during production, 

processing, storage, transmission and distribution of natural gas. This escape may also 

occur as a consequence of oil exploitation, because natural gas is usually found in 

connection with oil systems. Therefore, methane emission can be caused by oil 

production, refinement, transportation and storage. 

? Livestock enteric fermentation: several domestic animals, such as ruminants, produce 

methane due to their digestive processes. In the rumen, or in the fore-stomach, 

microbial fermentation (enteric fermentation) is responsible for the production of 

methane as a by-product of this process. 

? Livestock manure management: anaerobic degradation of organic matter in livestock 

manure management systems is also responsible for the emission of methane. 

? Sewage treatment: the treatment processes through which municipal wastewater is 

carried out can produce methane if the organic constituents of the sewage are treated 

anaerobically. 

? Rice cultivation: in these cultures, if the organic matter is decomposed anaerobically in 

the soil, then methane emission to the atmosphere occurs. 

 

Natural sources of methane 

? Wetlands: these provide absolutely anoxic environments with high quantities of organic 

matter. They are favourable habitats for the methane-producing microbes 

(methanogens), which produce methane as a result of the decomposition of organic 

matter.  

? Termites and other animals: methane is produced as a product of their digestive 

metabolism.  



CChhaapptteerr  IIII  

26 

? Oceans: in marine sediments, in the presence of anaerobic conditions and high 

amounts of organic matter, methanogens may produce methane. It has also been 

reported the production of methane in marine environments due to marine zooplankton 

and fish digestion, serpentinization processes at depth and thermocatalitic 

decomposition of oil. 

 

Geological sources of methane emission to the atmosphere 

Methane can be released trough geological structures and/or related processes. 

These include: natural seabed gas seeps, mud volcanoes, gas hydrate dissociation, 

onshore emissions (permafrost regions), hydrothermal/geothermal activity, volcanic 

emissions and natural coal seam fires.

II.2 – Gas hydrates on continental margins, their potential and 
associated hazards 

In the last few decades, special attention has been given to gas hydrate formation 

and its dissociation at the sea floor, and scientists have been trying to understand how 

these phenomena occur. Gas hydrates have a great importance, because of their 

potential exploration as a future energy resource.  Presently, gas hydrates are considered 

one of the world’s most important and promising future energetic resource. It is estimated 

that carbon resources associated with gas hydrates are more than twice higher than the 

carbon resources associated with other known fossil fuels (Source: U.S. Department of 

Interior, U.S.G.S., figure II-3).

and sediments, which equals nearly 1,000 times this total amount). Numbers in gigatons (1015 tons) 

of carbon (Source: U.S. Department of Interior, U.S.G.S.). 

 

Gas hydrates are crystalline solid compounds, consisting of water molecules linked 

by hydrogen bridges, forming a “cage”-like structure which traps gas molecules inside.  

These are ice-like structures, where the geometric arrangement of the water molecules 

forms cavities trapping inside the gas molecule (figure II-4).

These compounds are all also known as “Inflammable Ice”, because they become 

inflammable in the proximity of a flame. Although there is an absence of chemical linkages 

between the water and the gas, their structure is very stable and allows this gas not to 

dissociate until temperatures much higher than 0 ºC are attained, being only necessary 

that the concentration of the gases and the confining pressure are high enough.  

Several distinct gas hydrate structures can be formed due to the fact that various 

gases have adequate molecular sizes to form hydrates. In Nature there are three types of 

gas hydrates (Suess, 2000): 

? Type I hydrates, which belong to the cubic crystallization system, are generally formed 

of smaller molecules than other types. Type I gas hydrate formers may include: 

methane, ethane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide.  

? Type II hydrates are usually formed of larger molecules than Type I gas hydrates. Type 

II gas hydrates also belong to the cubic crystallization system and type II gas hydrate 

formers include generally higher hydrocarbon molecules such as propane and 

isobutane; however, nitrogen, a relatively small molecule, can also form a Type II 

hydrate. 

? Type H gas hydrates were discovered more recently. This type of gas hydrates belong 

to the hexagonal crystallization system and are formed by larger molecules but only in 

the presence of a smaller molecule, such as methane.

 The most common gas hydrate in nature is methane hydrate, which is found in 

higher quantities along continental margins. These are areas where the formation of 

methane hydrates is favoured by the intense and quick sedimentation and by the high 

content in organic matter. Gas hydrates, namely methane hydrates, are also found under 

the polar Artic layer at a depth of a few hundred of meters (permafrost regions). 

Like the majority of gas hydrates, methane hydrates found at or below seafloor, 

might have a biogenic or a thermogenic origin. The biogenic process is carried out by 

microbial organisms, through a mechanism where organic matter buried in the bottom of 

the ocean is decomposed by microbes (methanogens), responsible for the production of 

methane (methanogenesis). This methane can form gas hydrates under appropriate 

pressure and temperature conditions. The thermogenic origin of methane hydrates results 

from a sequence of stages which include a temperature increase followed by the 

progressive burial of organic-rich sediments. In this case, the decomposition of organic 

material occurs due to high temperatures and is not microbilally mediated. This process 

occurs usually in sedimentary basins, at a considerable depth and with temperatures 

above 100 ºC. Methane hydrates may also form as a consequence of oil degradation at 

higher depths and temperatures, or as result of serpentinization processes at depth which 

lead to methane formation. 

It is very important to know whether the gas present in a gas hydrate has a 

biogenic or a thermogenic origin, because this can be indicative of the existence of an oil 

system in depth. The biogenic gas is known as “dry gas”, consisting almost exclusively of 

methane, whereas thermogenic gas (“humid gas”), is composed of methane and higher 

hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane and higher hydrocarbons. Therefore, 

when a thermogenic gas is discovered, there is a possibility that it is associated with deep 

oil reservoirs. 

The ?13C signature of biogenic and thermogenic gas is different, which means that 

analysing the content of stable carbon isotopes is a valuable tool to identify the origin of 

the gas. ?13C value for biogenic gas oscillates between -100 and -80‰, whereas 

thermogenic gases have a ?13C value between  -40‰ and -30‰ (Clenell, 2000).  

In the last two decades, great progresses have occurred in the knowledge of these 

gases. The year that marked the turning point in the study of gas hydrates was 1970, 

when these where found almost accidentally in sediments of Black Outer Ridge (USA), 

following the observation of a “Bottom Simulating Reflector” (BSR) in seismic refelction

profiles (Markl et al., 1970). These reflectors with negative polarity correspond to the base 

of gas hydrates, where free gas is found below. 

The formation of gas hydrates depends on the existence of relatively high gas 

content, high pressure and low temperatures (Suess, 2000). Moreover, regarding the 

particular case of methane hydrates, one of the factors that interfere with its stability and 

distribution is the solubility of methane in water. Generally, methane solubility in water is 

low, but it may oscillate as a function of the temperature, hydrostatic pressure and 

chemistry of the surrounding environment (figure II-5).

Various indirect seismic tools have been used to study gas hydrates in the field. 

The most commonly used seismic method is seismic reflection, through which it is 

possible to identify and map the BSR’s. Seismic wave’s propagation velocity in hydrates is 

approximately two times higher than the propagation velocity of these waves in the sea 

floor sediments. It should be noted however, that there are many places where gas 

hydrates have been recovered but where there is no evidence of BSR’s. 

Electromagnetic methods and electric resistivity have also been used to determine 

the existence of a BSR. These methods measure electric resistivity variations in the 

basement, using electromagnetic waves instead of seismic waves (Sinha et al., 1990). 

Other complementary methods include measurement of heat fluxes, since gas 

hydrate stability depends strongly on fairly tight pressure and temperature conditions. 

These methods allow a more profound knowledge of the geological and thermal settings 

involved in the formation of gas hydrates. 

Recently, mainly thanks to the Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP) and, more 

recently, to the Integrated Ocean Drilling Programe (IODP), the properties of gas hydrates 

have been intensively studied. Some examples of the main topics which dominate current 

gas hydrate-related research are: 

? formation of gas hydrate; 

? gas hydrate structure; 

? influence of gas hydrates in the global biogeochemical cycling; 

? gas hydrate relation with tectonic and geological processes; 

? gas hydrate related natural hazards. 

Regarding this last item, the scientific community has extensively used bathymetric 

and geomorphological studies to understand geological hazards related with gas 

hydrates, like for example submarine landslides and slope instability. The dissociation of 

gas hydrates has a strong influence in the stability/instability of the bottom of the sea by 

fluidizing the sediments (Bugge et al., 1988; Baraza et al., 1999; Pecher, 2002).

II.3 – Hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage and fluid escape structures on 
continental margins 

 Areas of past and/or present occurrence of fluid and/or gas escape are dominated 

by several diagnostic structures such as mud volcanoes, mud diapirs, carbonate 

chimneys, carbonate crusts and pockmarks. The formation of such structures is related to 

fluid and/or gas mobilization, generally, from deep sources. 

Hydrocarbon-rich fluid escape related structures can be distributed in three 

different groups, concerning its main features (Kopf, 2002): 

? Mud mobilization structures: these include mud diapirs which are structures formed 

by mud intrusions and mud volcanoes, the latter involving mud extrusion. 

? Authigenic carbonates with distinct geochemical and isotopic signatures which 

indicate the involvement of methane in their precipitation. 

? Collapse structures, such as pockmarks. 

These structures are often colonized by chemosynthetic communities that depend 

on the predominant fluids or gases in order to obtain energy for their growth and 

development. Therefore, important biogeochemical processes occur in fluid seepage 

areas, making these regions particularly important for the understanding of 

biogeochemical cycles.  

Some of the main features in fluid/gas seepage areas, as well as the main 

microbial mediated biogeochemical processes, will be described further on in a latter 

section of this chapter. 

 

II.3.1 – Mud volcanoes and mud diapirs 

Mud volcanoes are geologic structures formed as result of the extrusion of a 

mixture of gas, water and clay material at the Earth’s terrestrial surface (Dimitrov, 2003). 

These form topographic elevations that can be found almost everywhere on Earth surface, 

both on land and in the bottom of the oceans (figure II-6).

Mud volcanism involves the dislocation through sediments of mud breccia (a fine 

grained matrix of muddy sediments, water and gases, with rock fragments) followed by its 

extrusion.  

On the other hand, mud diapirs are characterized by the intrusion of mud into 

sedimentary layers not followed by its extrusion at the surface. Hence, mud volcanism is 

considered an extrusive phenomenon whereas mud diapirism is considered intrusive. 

Besides mud volcanoes and mud diapirs, other types of structures: can be 

distinguished: diatremes. These are similar to mud diapirs but while in mud diapirs the 

mud behaves as a single-phase viscous fluid, in diatremes the flow of water and/or gas 

trough sediments causes fluidization (Kopf, 2000). Figure II-7 represents an illustrative 

diagram of the three types of structures, as proposed by Kopf (2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fluid sources for overpressuring and mud extrusion: 

(1) pore fluids expulsion from compaction; 
(2) biogenic methane from degradation of organic matter; 
(3) lateral fluid flux through statigraphic horizons or fault zones; 
(4) fluid migration along deep seated thrusts; 
(5) thermogenic methane and higher hydrocarbons; 
(6) fluids from mineral dehydration (opal, smectite); 
(7) hydrothermal fluids, alteration of crustal rock; 
(8) fluid expulsion from internal deformation within the diapiric intrusion.

Figure II-8   Carbonate chimney recovered from the Gulf 
of Cadiz in the scope of the TASYO project.  

(http://tierra.rediris.es/TASYO/cold_seeps.html). 

Mud volcanoes are predominant in some particular geological settings, in regions 

dominated by tectonic compression or with high sedimentation rates, and are frequently 

associated with accretionary complexes. The ocean basin where more mud volcanoes 

have been reported so far is the Mediterranean Sea (Kopf, 2002). However, this is 

probably mainly due to the absence of equally detailed studies in other continental 

margins. 

Several facts make the understanding of mud volcanism extremely important. 

Milkov et al. (2000) made a compilation of such facts: 

? these structures are important methane sources to the hydrosphere and atmosphere; 

? mud volcanoes may constitute an evidence of the existence of oil reservoirs in depth; 

? analysing the material extruded from mud volcanoes may provide important data 

regarding the sedimentary history of the underlying basin geology; 

? gas hydrates related with these structures may be used in the future as an important 

energy source. 

 

II.3.2 – Authigenic methane-related carbonate crusts and chimneys 

In fluid and/or gas escape dominated areas, methane-derived authigenic 

carbonates (MDAC), forming structures such as chimneys (figure II-8), mounds or crusts 

are frequently found. The lithology of these structures is dominated by calcite, and/or 

aragonite, and/or dolomite. These structures are found all over the world in association 

with mud volcanoes and mud diapiric fields in accretionary margins. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The origin of these structures is still a matter of debate and several groups of researchers 

have been focusing on understanding the mechanism of their formation (Vasconcelos et 

al., 1995; Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; Stakes et al., 1999; Aloisi et al., 2000, Díaz-



CChhaapptteerr  IIII  

36 

del-Rio et al., 2003). There is however a general agreement that they correspond to 

carbonated-cemented fluid venting pathways, where the precipitation of carbonates 

occurs, most likely related with microbial activity associated to AOM. This has been 

confirmed by the detection of low ?13C values suggesting the incorporation of carbon 

deriving from methane oxidation. 

One of the major breakthroughs in the understanding of the formation and 

precipitation of authigenic dolomite was carried out by Vasconcelos et al. (1995), who 

were able to precipitate dolomite in the laboratory at low temperatures, under the 

mediation of microbes. 

 

II.3.3 – Pockmarks 

These are seabed collapse structures that look like buried craters. These 

structures are common in hydrocarbon-rich fluid escape related areas, but also in other 

areas such as compressional areas. Pockmarks are formed by tectonical collapse or by 

the removal of sediment by escaping fluids (Hovland and Judd, 1988). 

 

II.4 – Microbial-related biogeochemical processes in marine sediments 

There are several chemical alterations occurring in marine sediments and in the 

subjacent water column that are mediated by microbes. The most relevant processes 

discussed in this work are: sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, aerobic oxidation of 

methane and anaerobic oxidation of methane. The most commonly observed chemical 

alterations that occur in sediment pore water or in the water column in the proximity of 

cold seeps are (Aharon, P. in Riding and Awramik, 2000): 

? decrease of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and methane (CH4) due to microbial activity; 

? depletion of carbon dioxide (CO2) related with microbial metabolism; 

? enrichment in carbon dioxide caused by the respiration of methanotrophs, leading to 

the increase of dissolved organic carbon, decrease of pH and negative variations of 

?13C.

37 

II.4.1 – Sulphate Reduction 

In the proximity of cold seep sediments, it is frequently detected an accentuated 

depletion in sulphate associated with enrichment in reduced sulphur compounds, namely 

hydrogen sulphide. This enrichment is provoked by the anaerobic reduction of sulphate 

that occurs in the anoxic pore water and results from the anaerobic respiration of bacteria 

subsisting in anoxic sediments of seeps. 

As a result of sulphate reduction, several metabolic products are generated and 

released into the interstitial fluids. Besides hydrogen sulphide, carbonate, ammonium and 

other compounds are also produced, whose concentrations and types depend on the type 

of substrate present. 

The following equations show an example of the chemical reactions involved in the 

microbial reduction of sulphate using methane, a saturated hydrocarbon, as a substrate: 

-

SHCO2OHCO 2

3

-
2 +?+

?        (II-2) 

Aharon (in Riding and Awramik, 2000) presented a study on the ratio 

sulphate/sulphide in cold seep pore waters from the northern Gulf of Mexico. This author 

showed that this ratio is linear, which indicates that the sulphate reduction is actually 

effective in the sediments from this area. 

 

II.4.2 – Methanogenesis 

Methanogenic microorganisms are commonly found in anoxic sediments 

surrounding cold seeps. Methanogens have specific carbon sources and usually form 

consortia with other microorganisms in order to obtain the compounds necessary for their 

growth and development. This syntrophic relation is common in bacteria, which initially 

convert organic substrates into metabolites, vital to methanogens to carry out 

methanogenesis. The metabolites used by methanogens as intermediates in order to form 

methane are still largely unknown. Nevertheless, several studies have pointed out that 

acetate and hydrogen are two possible candidates. In a first stage, bacteria transform the 

organic substrates producing an intermediate (acetate, hydrogen or other) which is used 

latter in the production of methane by methanogens. Equation II-3 shows the chemical 

equation on the base of the formation of acetate and hydrogen by bacteria: 



CChhaapptteerr  IIII  

38 

22322 2HCOOOHCHOHO3CH ++?+    (II-3) 

 

Subsequently, the formation of methane is a result of anaerobic respiration of 

methanogenic organisms, showed by the following equations: 

243 COCHOOHCH +?        (II-4) 

O2HCOH4 222 ?+         (II-5) 

Methanogens have the particular characteristic of living in the most extreme 

environments. These unicellular organisms are strict anaerobes that release methane as 

a consequence of their cellular metabolism.  Originally, they were thought to be bacteria 

but they are now recognized as belonging to a separate philogenetic domain, the 

Archaea. This domain contains several phylum, but the two most prominent are the 

Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota. Methanogens belong to the Euryarchaeota. 

Methanogens are also found in extreme environments, like hydrothermal vents, 

where they succeed at temperatures above 100 ºC. Methanogens produce approximately 

109 tons of methane per year. About half of this is reoxidized by methanotrophic 

organisms and most of the rest escapes to the atmosphere. The main requests for the 

occurrence of methanogenesis are the absence of reducer compounds, such as sulphate, 

and the abundance of organic matter. 

Archaea are also capable of reoxidizing methane under anoxic conditions as it will 

be shown in section II.4.4. 

 

II.4.3 – Aerobic oxidation of methane 

At methane-rich cold seeps, the methane fraction which escapes to the oxic water 

column is oxidized to carbon dioxide by aerobic methanotrophs. These microbes live in 

symbiosis with organisms that colonize seeps, living, for example, on mussel gills. About 

30% of the methanotrophs living in cold seeps use carbon dioxide as a carbon source 

(Aharon, 2000) 

The organisms that mediate aerobic oxidation of methane are chemolithotrophs 

and obligate aerobes. Therefore, these organisms need molecular oxygen in order to 

oxidize methane.

39 

The aerobic oxidation of methane is a well-known process, where oxygen is the 

electron donor, and it is described by the following equation: 

OH2CO2OCH 2224 +?+        (II-6) 

However, the aerobic oxidation of methane is a process that consists of a net of 

chemical reactions, which sequentially oxidize methane to methanol (via 

monooxygenase), subsequently to formaldehyde (via dehydrogenase), then to formate 

(via formaldehyde dehydrogenase) and finally to carbon dioxide (via formate 

dehydrogenase). 

 

II.4.4 – Aerobic sulphide oxidation 

In the proximity of seeps there are also evidences of the occurrence of another 

important chemical reaction: sulphide oxidation. This process is mediated by sulphide 

oxidizing bacteria, mainly Beggiatoa. These bacteria live in the sediment-water interface 

and use the energy resulting from the oxidation of sulphide to produce carbon dioxide. In 

this process, oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor and sulphur is also produced. This 

compound may form small grains on the external face of the cytoplasmatic membrane. 

The following equation describes the sulphide oxidation: 

OH2SO21SH 222 +?+        (II-7) 

 

II.4.5 – Anaerobic oxidation of methane 

The existence of methane reservoirs in continental margins around the world, 

mainly under the shape of methane hydrates, is being intensively investigated at present. 

Still, only a small fraction of this huge amount of methane is probably escaping from the 

anoxic marine sediments to the water column and to the atmosphere. 

In the last decade, several studies have been concerned with methane 

consumption in the marine sediments and it is now consensually accepted that the 

process responsible for the consumption of methane in the sediments, before it escapes 

to the water column, is microbially mediated. 

Knowing the properties of methane as a greenhouse gas, knowing the effects of 

an eventual release of great amounts of methane from the oceanic sea floor to the 

atmosphere and taking into account that methane is a possible energy source for the near 



CChhaapptteerr  IIII  

40 

future, a considerable attention has been given to the processes that may block methane 

release to the atmosphere. 

The microbes that take part of methane production and consumption occupy an 

important link in the global carbon cycle, either because the existing methane has a 

biogenic origin, as it was explained before in this work, or because certain microbes are 

able to consume methane under anaerobic conditions in marine sediments. Therefore, 

methane trapped in the form of gas hydrate can be released by diffusion, by ebullition or 

can be oxidized by methane oxidizing microbes. Thus, in the carbon cycle, there is the 

interference of methane producing and of methane consuming microbes (methanogens 

and methanotrophs, respectively). 

Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) has been largely studied in the past 30 

years. The first authors to study AOM were Martens and Berner (1974), who suggested 

that this process could explain the typical downwards decreasing of sulphate profiles 

coupled to upward decreasing methane profiles observed in marine sediments. Since 

1974, several authors have done considerable work on this topic. 

Presently, there are several hypotheses to explain methane oxidation under anoxic 

conditions, but the most accepted is that methane is oxidized by a microbial organism in 

association with sulphate reducing bacteria, presuming that an unknown compound is 

used as an electron transporter between both organisms intervening in the process. 

One of the most important studies regarding this issue was carried out by Boetius 

et al. (2000). This study was carried out in sediments obtained from core samples 

recovered from the Cascadia convergent margin, off Oregon (USA), where gas hydrates 

were found at a depth between 600 and 800 m bsf. A downward depletion of sulphate in 

the Cascadia margin sediments was observed, simultaneously with upward methane 

depletion. Boetius et al. (2000) suggested that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) 

occurring in the anoxic marine sediments, is mediated by a consortium of Archaea, which 

are methanotrophs, and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). These authors also proposed 

that Archaea reverse the methanogenesis process due to the interaction with sulphate 

reducing bacteria (figure II-9). This had previously been suggested by Zehnder and Brock 

(1979; 1980) who proposed for the first time that this process should occur in two steps: 

first, Archaea work in reverse and transform methane into intermediates (e.g. methanol or 

acetate); afterwards, the intermediates are oxidized by sulphate reducing bacteria into 

CO2 through sulphate reduction.

sulphate-methane interface is the horizon of intersection of sulphate and methane profiles, both 

with minimum values. The inset shows the spatial arrangement and potential metabolic couplings 

of the microbial consortium reported by Boetius et al., 2000 (DeLong, 2000). 

 

Sulphate reduction is mainly performed by several groups of delta proteobacteria 

like Desulfosarcina (DSS), Desulfonema and Desulfococus (Madigan et al., 2000). These 

organisms may use different electron donors such as hydrogen, acetate and lactate 

(Treude, 2003).

AOM is the process that allows methane to be consumed under anoxic conditions, 

using sulphate as terminal electron acceptor. The equation descibing AOM is the 

following: 

OHHSHCOSOCH 2
--

44 ++?+       (II-9) 

As mentioned before, this is a two-step coupled mechanism performed by 

methane oxidizers and sulphate reducers. Still, it is not yet known which metabolites 

(intermediates) are exchanged between both organisms. Some, have been proposed by 



CChhaapptteerr  IIII  

42 

several authors, like hydrogen or acetate. In the following chemical reaction, hydrogen is 

used as an intermediate (Thomsen et al., 2001): 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hence, it is possible to conclude that sulphate reduction is supported by ascending 

fluxes of methane. 

One product of AOM is sulphide, which results of sulphate reduction and 

accumulates in similar concentrations to the consumed sulphate. This explains the 

presence of considerable amounts of sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, forming mats in the 

surrounding sediments, like for e.g. Beggiatoa. 

Boetius et al. (2000) complemented the work on the Cascadia margin sediments 

with Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) and molecular studies, which enabled to 

show microscopic evidences of the existence of the Archaea-Bacteria consortium. This 

was an important step in the study of AOM and it was the first time that the existence of 

AOM-consortia was shown by microscopic studies. 

The FISH techniques carried out by Boetius and co-workers allowed the detection 

of cellular aggregates in sites where methane escape was observed. These aggregates 

were described as consortia of Archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB), forming a 

sphere with 2,3 ± 1,3 µm. The Archaea appear surrounded by approximately 200 SRB’s, 

with an average diameter of 0,3 ± 0,5 µm, forming an external “shell” with one or two 

layers of cells. In total, the consortium diameter ranges between 1 and 11 µm (figure II-

10). The smallest aggregates found consist only of 1-3 cells of Archaea and 1-3 cells of 

SRB’s and should correspond to the initial stages of development, whereas the most 

developed ones consisted of about 10 000 cells.

After philogenetic analyses, Boetius and co-workers became aware that the 

Archaea present in the aggregates found in Cascadia margin sediments are related to the 

methanogenic order Methanosarcinales. The SRB’s belong to the Bacteria domain.

II.4.6 – Tools to study anaerobic oxidation of methane 

Several geomicrobiological techniques are available to study anaerobic oxidation 

of methane in marine sediments. This section briefly explains how each tool can be used 

to study this process. 

 

II.4.6.1 - Geochemical parameters 

Taking into consideration that AOM is a two-step reaction involving methane 

oxidation and sulphate reduction and that this last process produces sulphide, it is 

possible to have an evidence of this process by simultaneously measuring methane, 

sulphate and sulphide concentrations at a depth interval. Methane and sulphate 

measurement results, plotted together, allow the detection of a possible sulphate-methane 

transition zone (SMTZ) (figure II-11 and II-12).

indicative of the occurrence of AOM coupled to SR in marine sediments. Therefore, this 

parameter is frequently measured when scientists are looking for evidences of AOM. 

 

II.4.6.2 – Radiotracer Measurements 

Radiotracer measurements allow the quantification of AOM and SR rates (Devol, 

1983; Iversen and Blackburn, 1981; Iversen and Jorgensen, 1985). This technique 

consists of adding radiotracers to the sediments, in order to measure their conversion into 

known products and quantify the turnover rate. In the case of AOM, the tracer used is 
14CH4 and in the case of SR the tracer is 35SO42-. By using these radiotracers and knowing 

the total methane and sulphate concentration in the sediments, as well as the 

concentration of the produced 14CO2 and H235S, it is possible to calculate the turnover

rates of 14CH4 to 14CO2 and of 35SO4 to H235S and therefore know the AOM and SR rates, 

respectively. 

This technique, was able to demonstrate for the first time the coupling of AOM and 

SR in marine sediments (Iversen and Blackburn, 1981) (Figure II-13). The radiotracer 

techniques used to measure AOM and SR rates are explained in more detail in chapter V. 

Both processes frequently occur at a 1:1 ratio, as suggested by Iversen and 

Blackburn, and also by Devol (1983) Iversen and Jorgensen (1985) and Nauhaus et al. 

(2002). Below, is presented an example of AOM and SR rates measured in sediments 

from the Black Sea, presenting a stoichiometry close to 1:1 (Treude, unknown date).

II.4.6.3 – Lipid Biomarkers Analysis 

“The detailed analysis of universal components, such as the lipids found in all cell 

membranes, yields detailed patterns of components that have been established as 

biomarker "signatures" for specific groups of microbes.” In: Center of Biomarker Analysis, 

University of Tenesse, Knoxville, USA, (http://cba.bio.utk.edu/cbaknow.html). 

The identification of the lipid biomarkers present in sediments from methane 

seeps, allows the identification of the microbes present in those sediments and involved in 

AOM and SR. Using this technique it is possible to identify the microbial organisms on the 

level of kingdoms and sometimes orders, but never more specifically than that.

Biomarkers are organic compounds that can be linked to specific organisms and 

can be used in the reconstruction of past depositional environments. In the case of AOM 

and SR, lipid biomarkers have been intensively used in order to confirm the occurrence of 

such processes and to identify the organisms involved. Both archaeal and bacterial lipid 

biomarkers come from cell membrane’s phospholipid bilayer, which has specific types of 

lipids for each organism. Bacterial related lipid biomarkers consist of fatty acid chains with 

ester linkages, whereas archaeal specific lipid biomarkers have isoprenoid chains with 

ether linkages (figure II-14).

Archaeal biomarkers are quite diversified and several studies showed that these 

include mainly diethers such as archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol, which are specific AOM 

related biomarkers and are not found in non-seep related environments (Hinrichs et al., 

1999) (figure II-15; the three large peaks that appear in both chromatograms are internal 

standard C19:0). 

Other examples of archeal lipid biomarkers are the irregular isoprenoids PMI’s 

(2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane) and crocetane (2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane) 

(Elvert and Suess et al., 1999, Hinrichs et al., 1999; Elvert et al. , 2003).

Bacterial biomarkers include fatty acid methyl esters (FAME’s). There are several 

FAME’s known as being SRB related. Elvert and co-workers (2003) characterized the 

specific FAME’s related to the AOM-dependent SRB and concluded that the most 

abundant FAME’s present in the cell membrane of AOM-related SRB’s are C16:1?5, 

cyC17:0?5,6 and ai-C15:0, in decreasing order of abundance, as shown in the graph of figure

mass balance calculations (Elvert et al., 2003). 

  

II.4.6.4 – Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis 

As complementary information to lipid biomarker analysis, it is also important to 

determine the biomarkers’ isotopic composition. The stable isotopic composition 

preserved in organic matter may give powerful evidences of several processes occurring 

in nature. For example, carbon, which is the basic constituent of organic matter, plays an 

important role in several atmospheric, ecological and biogeochemical processes. 

Therefore, through the  analysis of stable carbon isotopic composition of lipid biomarkers, 

it is possible to get information on the carbon source and/or metabolic carbon fixation 

pathways used by its producer (Treude, 2003). 

In the case of AOM and SR, by analysing the carbon isotope composition of 

archaeal and bacterial related biomarkers, a better understanding of their metabolism and 

carbon source can be obtained.

During microbial oxidation of methane, the lighter 12C isotope is preferentially 

consumed and therefore the heavier 13C isotope becomes enriched in the remaining 

dissolved methane. This enrichment in light 12C in microbes, discriminating from the 

heavier 13C substrate occurs because of a slower reactivity of the heavier molecule. This 

process is called kinetic isotope fractionation.  

The ratio between 12C and 13C is generally given in comparison with a known 

standard (the Viena Pee Dee Belemnite – VPDB) and is represented by the expression 

?13C. The VDPB standard corresponds to the carbon contained in the calcium carbonate 

of a marine fossil denominated Pee Dee Belemnite, which belongs to a geological 

formation, in North Carolina (USA), of Cretaceous age, whose value was established by 

the International Agency for Atomic Energy, with headquarters in Vienna. 

 

This isotope ratio is given by the following equation.

Therefore, measuring the carbon isotope composition of lipid biomarkers extracted 

from the cell membranes of organisms, may give evidence whether those organisms are 

effectively involved in AOM or not. 

Extremely depleted values of these biomarkers (e.g. -100‰) are not consistent 

with microbes using CO2 as their carbon source. The typical microbes growing under CO2-

rich environments usually have a ?13C of approximately -30‰ (figure II-17). Thus, the 13C-

depleted compounds derive from methane consuming (methanotrophs) rather than from 

methane producing (methanogens) organisms.

Molecular techniques have been developed to complement biomarker techniques, 

because of the need to visualize and to identify taxonomically with precision, not only at 

the level of kingdoms or orders but also at the level of species. These molecular methods 

are briefly exposed below. 

 

II.4.6.5 – Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH) 

FISH is a molecular technique which was the first method to allow the visualization 

of the consortium of organisms involved in AOM. This method uses fluorescently labelled 

oligonucleotide probes in order to label entire cells. These probes are complementary to 

rRNA sequences unique to different phylogenetic groups or even species and bind to 

ribosomes, in intact fixed cells of the appropriate species, by complementary base paring 

(Treude, 2003). When labelled with the fluorescent dyes, probes can be used for detection 

and identification of microbes by fluorescence microscopy.

As referred previously in this work, in 2000, Boetius et al. presented the first 

pictures of AOM-consortium, using the FISH technique, where it is possible to identify 

Archaea surrounded by SRB’s (figure II-18). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

II.4.6.6 – rDNA Phylogenies 

This molecular method consists in cloning 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) genes of 

bacterial biomass, sequencing and identify the organism to which the genes belong by 

comparing them with known 16S rDNA sequences in existing databases. To carry out 

phylogenetic analyses, sequences are inserted into a phylogenetic tree where it is 

possible to observe the relation with known organisms or with other clones (Summons, 

1999) (figure II-19).

So far, using this type of phylogenetic studies, three groups of methanotrophic 

archaea were already identified: ANME-1, ANME-2 and ANME-3 (Hinrichs et al., 1999; 

Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001; Knittel et al., 2005).

Chapter III – Characterization of the Study Area 

 

III.1 – Geological setting 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located west of the Gibraltar Arc, between Iberia and the 

African Plate. It has had a complex tectonic history with several episodes of extension, 

strike-slip and compression related to the closure of the Thetys Ocean, the opening of the 

North Atlantic, and the Africa-Eurasia convergence since the Cenozoic. The Gibraltar Arc 

is the westernmost tectonic belt of the Alpine-Mediterranean compressional system 

(Maldonado et al., 1999). 

During the Mesozoic and beginning of the Cenozoic, several half-graben basins 

and carbonated platforms were formed (Maldonado et al., 1999). During the Tortonian, 

occured the westward migration of the Gibraltar Arc, leading to the formation of an 

accretionary prism and the formation of a large olistrostome body related with sediment 

landslides and with intense deformation of sediments from the Iberic and African margins 

(Maldonado and Comas, 1992; Maldonado et al., 1999). This olistrostome complex was 

emplaced over the arcuate thrusts related to the formation of the Gibraltar Arc (Maldonado 

and Comas, 1992; Maldonado and Nelson, 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et al., 

2003). 

The four main tectonic allochtonous provinces that surround the internal zones of 

the Gibraltar Arc orogenic belt include (figure III-1): 

a) flysch unites of the Campo de Gibraltar; 

b) a detached Mesozoic sedimentary basin at the external zones, ranging 

from Lower Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous-Paleocen pre-units; 

c) the Triassic diapiric zone, composed of salt, gypsum and carbonate 

deposits emplaced as diapiric structures by thrusting of thick nappes of Mesozoic 

sediments; 

d) the front of a deformed wedge, mainly formed by clastic clays and marls of 

Early-Middle Miocene age .

The formation of the main olistrostomic bodies stopped in the late Miocene and 

there was an acceleration of the tectonical subsidence. 

This area is presently characterized by a diffuse seismicity along the Africa/Eurasia 

plate boundary (Fukao, 1973; Grimison and Chen, 1986), and it was marked by the most 

destructive historical earthquake in western Europe, the 1755 event, which, together with 

its associated tsunami, was responsible for the destruction of a large part of Lisbon 

(Ribeiro, 1994; Zitellini et al., 1999; Buforn and Columbás, 2001). The focal mechanism 

solutions of the main seismic events in this area indicate a combination of dextral strike-

slip along the African-Eurasian plate boundary, and an approximately NW or WNW

directed compression associated with the African and Eurasian convergence since the 

Cenozoic (Udias et al., 1976; Zitellini et al., 1999). 

The main oceanographic feature of the Gulf of Cadiz is the existence of the 

Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), which occurs as a warm and saline high velocity 

bottom current, revealed by a high density contrast between the westward Mediterranean 

water and the lighter eastward North Atlantic water (Baringer and Price, 1999). In the Gulf 

of Cadiz region the MOW travels along the continental slope in a E-W direction and 

inflects towards the North at Cape St. Vicent 

 

III.2 – The Gulf of Cadiz Mud Volcano Field 

The Gulf of Cadiz has been intensely surveyed with geophysical methods and 

sampling, since the discovery of the first mud volcanoes in this area, in 1999, during the 

TTR-9 cruise Leg 2 (Akhmanov et al., 2000 in Kenyon et al., 2000;Gardner 2000; 2001).  

Numerous fluid escape structures were revealed on a sidescan sonar mosaic (SEABEAM) 

acquired in this area in 1992 by the Naval Research Laboratory (Pinheiro et al., 2003). 

The methods used to investigate this area include reflection seismics, side-scan sonar, 

heat-flow, underwater TV and coring. Subsequently, these structures have been 

investigated and were confirmed to be mud volcanoes, mud diapirs and pockmarks. The 

first discovered mud volcano was given the designation of Yuma and is situated in the 

Moroccan margin.  

Mud volcanism is a common feature in accretionary complex areas where gas-rich 

sediments are overpressured at depth due to intense tectonic stresses, and where fluid 

migration appears to be controlled by structural factors. Indeed, in the Gulf of Cadiz, some 

of the mud volcanoes appear to occur along NW-SE strike-slip faults and their conjugate 

set, in particular at the intersection of these structures with the arcuate thrusts associated 

with the Gibraltar Arc (Pinheiro et al., 2003).  

Since the first expedition in 1999, several gas and fluid seepage related structures 

have been discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz, in Portuguese, Moroccan and Spanish 

territories. Untill now, 34 mud volcanoes were discovered, as well as an extensive field of 

authigenic carbonate chimneys and crusts and pockmarks (Díaz-del-Rio et al., 2003, 

Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro, pers. com.) (figure III-2).

Several oceanographic expeditions have been carried out to study the Gulf of 

Cadiz area: 6 cruises coordinated by the Portuguese team (2 in conjunction with the 

Belgium team), in the scope of the Unesco/IOC Training Through Research Program 

(TTR-9, 1999; TTR-10, 2000; TTR-11, 2001; TTR-12, 2002, TTR-14, 2004; TTR-15, 

2005);  3 Spanish cruises TASYO, 2000; Anastasya (2000) and Anastasya (2001); RV 

Belgica (2002) and the German cruise (GAP, 2003).

III.3 – The SO 175 expedition: GAP cruise 

The work presented in this thesis is based on data collected during expedition 

SO175, on board of the German research vessel Sonne. This campaign was entitled GAP 

(Gibraltar Arc Processes). It resulted in a multidisplinary investigation of the Gulf of Cadiz 

area, in which participated an international group of researchers (Kopf and Participants, 

2004). A wide range of methods were applied in this expedition, which included: 

? geophysical data aquisistion (seafloor multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar, seismic 

reflection profiling);

? sediment coring at sites of active fluid venting; 

? in situ heat flow measurements across the Gibraltar thrust wedge, deformation front, 

landslide bodies and mud volcanoes; 

? deployment of  long term pressure probes; 

? video-supported observations. 

The SO175 campaign, aimed to interconnect geological, geophysical, 

oceanographic, biogeochemical and microbiological data in order to get a good overall 

picture of this region, giving special attention to active fluid venting-related processes, as 

well as to contribute to the study of the possible sources of 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one 

of the most destructive earthquakes in Europe history, which occurred with a magnitude of 

approximately 8.5-9.0.  

 

III.4 – Mud volcanoes studied in the present work 

The mud volcanoes which were the object of the present study are: Captain 

Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, No Name, Gemini, Faro and Hesperides. The first one is 

the deepest known mud volcano in the area and is located in the Portuguese margin. All 

the others are situated in the Moroccan margin. The following table presents the main 

physical characteristics of the investigated mud volcanoes either for sediment studies or 

for carbonate crusts analysis (Faro and Hesperides). Subsequently, in the further sub-

III.4.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

This mud volcano is a cone shaped structure situated in the SE area of the Gulf of 

Cadiz, belonging to the Moroccan domain. It is located at 1400 m water depth. Its 

diameter is approximately 2 km and its height is about 100 m (table III-1 and figure III-3) 

(Pinheiro et al. in Kenyon et al., 2001; 2003). 

Data recovered from cruises previous to the GAP cruise (TTR-12; Peralta et al. in 

Kenyon et al., 2002) included samples of strongly gas hydrate saturated mud breccia with 

a strong H2S smell. During the TTR-12 cruise were also found biological assemblages 

associated with methane flux (Pogonophora, Polychaete and Solemyidae shell fragment 

at Captain Arutyunov’s sediments.  

During the GAP cruise, the sediment cores recovered show oxic horizons in the 

first 8 cm, then a suboxic layer. In the lower part of the cores a strong H2S smell was 

detected during recovery. Nevertheless, no methane-related organisms were recovered 

by coring.

III.4.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

The Bonjardim mud volcano is located in the Portuguese margin of the Gulf of 

Cadiz, situated at 3200 m water depth, its height is about 100 m and its diameter is 

approximately 1 km (table III-1 and figure III-4) (Pinheiro et al. in Kenyon et al. 2000,

2001, 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003). This is the deepest mud volcano studied in this work, 

as well as the deepest in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcano field. 

During the TTR-10 cruise a strong H2S smell was detected in sediments from this 

mud volcano and Pogonophora (unknown species) and Polychaete fragments were 

recovered, as well as small gas hydrate crystals (Pinheiro et al., 2003). On the other hand, 

the TV-guided observations of Bonjardim mud volcano during the GAP cruise did not 

show any evidence of chemosynthetic organisms. The recovery of the sediment cores 

allowed the detection of an oxic layer in the top 25 cm of the core, followed by an anoxic 

horizon. Below 90 cm it was felt a strong H2S smell in the sediment.

III.4.3 – Ginsburg mud volcano  

The Ginsburg mud volcano was discovered during the TTR-9 cruise. It is located in 

the Moroccan margin, in the southern Gulf of Cadiz, just south of the Yuma mud volcano. 

This mud volcano is about 4 km in diameter, rises 150-250 m above the seafloor and it is 

one of the first active methane-related mud volcanoes identified in this region. During the 

TTR-10 cruise (2000), ice-like gas hydrate crystals up to 5 cm in size were recovered from 

this mud volcano (Kenyon et al., 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003). 

The TV-guided observations carried out during the GAP cruise detected a 

dominant lithology of hemipelagic sediments with rare occurrence of carbonates or 

isolated patches with coral fragments. Throughout the whole core, sediments were 

strongly bioturbated, it was detected a slightly H2S and petroleum smell and the sediment 

was full of gas.

III.4.4 – Gemini mud volcano  

This is a large mud volcano (figure III-5), situated in the El Arraiche mud volcano 

field in the Moroccan margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, discovered during the Cadipor cruise. 

This structure is composed of two separate circular craters; the eastern crater is the 

largest one (Kenyon et al., 2003). This twin mud volcano is 252 m high and the water 

depth of its top is approximately 400 m; the base of the mud volcano is 2.3 km long and 

4.1 km wide  (Pieter Van Rensenberg, 2005).  

During the RV Belgica campaign which occurred in May 2002, highly gas-

saturated mud breccia, with a strong H2S smell was recovered from Gemini mud volcano 

(Pieter Van Rensenberg, 2005) and it was not found hemi-pelagic sediment. In 2003, 

during the GAP cruise, only a very thin layer of hemipelagic sediments was found (Kopf 

and Participants, 2004).

III.4.5 – No Name Mud Volcano  

This mud volcano is localized at 700 m water depth and was detected for the first 

time during the GAP cruise. Therefore, there is still very few information concerning this 

structure. Nevertheless, during the Gap cruise hemipelagic sediments and coral 

fragments were recovered from this mud volcano (Kopf and Participants, 2004).

IV.1 – Sampling 

The samples used in this study were collected in the Gulf of Cadiz, during the GAP 

cruise (Kopf and Participants, 2004). 

Sediment samples were retrieved from several mud volcanoes, using TV-guided 

multicores, as well as gravity cores (the latter in order to acquire longer sediment cores). 

A few carbonate chimneys and crusts were also recovered. In the scope of this thesis, 

only sediments from five mud volcanoes were used (Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, 

Ginsburg, No Name and Gemini) and carbonate crusts from the Faro and Hesperides 

mud volcanoes. Table IV-1 indicates the coring/sampling locations.

The multicorers were equipped with two video cameras and composed of six 

plastic tubes, a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 60 cm (figure IV-1A and IV-1B); most 

multicores were processed immediately after recovery in a glove box under argon 

atmosphere; only the cores with the highest amounts of methane or gas hydrates were 

processed outside the globe box, in order to make the procedure faster.  

The recovered gravity cores have a variable length of 6-12 m and were obtained 

using a weight of 1.6 tons. On board, gravity cores were cut into 1 m sections, closed, 

capped on both ends and labelled (figure IV-1C and D) (Kopf and Participants, 2004).

  Only in the Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes both multicores and 

gravity cores were obtained. In all the other mud volcanoes, only gravity cores were 

retrieved and analysed. Carbonate crusts from the Hesperides and Faro mud volcanoes 

were also collected using a TV-guided grab-sampler. 

 

IV.2 – Methods 

As referred previously, there are several tools available to study methane-related 

processes occurring in subsurface marine sediments, in particular AOM. The laboratory 

analyses carried out in this work were: 

i) Geochemical measurements: methane, C2+ compounds and sulphate. The main 
goal was to identify the horizon in the sediment where the main biogeochemical 

processes occur. Since the main interest of this work is to study the occurrence of 

AOM in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes’ sediments, methane and sulphate 

concentration measurements were carried out, and the corresponding 

geochemical profiles were obtained. 

ii) SR and AOM rate calculations were done in order to understand the extent to 
which these microbial-mediated processes occur in the sediments. 

iii) Lipid biomarker analysis, which is based on the fact that lipid fractions are 
preserved in the sediment, was also done. Lipids were extracted and analysed. 

These gave an indication of the organisms involved, distinguishing between 

Bacteria and Archaea. 

iv) Stable carbon isotope analysis was done on the lipid fraction and provided 
information about the carbon source incorporated by the microorganisms. 

 

The geochemical parameters determined and the laboratory procedures carried 

out for each station are presented in table IV-2.

IV.3 – Laboratory analyses 

 

IV.3.1 – Porosity 

For each station, 5 ml sediment samples were taken for porosity and density 

determination. First, the wet weigh of the sample was registered. Then the sediment was 

dried in an oven for two days at 90ºC, and then the dry weight of the sample was also 

registered. This procedure was done with the sediment sample inside a known weight 

recipient. Afterwards, the calculation of the weight of the pore water was done by 

subtracting the dry weight to the wet weight of the sample.  This way, it was possible to 

know the volume of pore water per volume of wet weight, by dividing the amount of pore 

water, already known, by the weight of wet sediment.  Finally, the porosity and density of 

the sample were calculated using the following two equations: 

 

Porosity (ml/ml) = volume of pore water / volume of wet sediment  (IV-1) 

Density (g/ml) = weight of wet sediment / volume of wet sediment  (IV-2) 

 

The calculation of these two parameters is necessary for further measurements, 

such as determining methane and sulphate concentrations. These were measured in 

samples from all stations.

IV.3.2 – Methane, C2+ compounds and sulphate concentration measurements 

Analysing methane and sulphate profiles in the sediments is an important tool to 

detect possible active horizons, in terms of anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with 

sulphate reduction. In this study, both methane and sulphate concentrations were 

measured in samples recovered at several depths from the Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, 

Ginsburg, No Name and Gemini mud volcanoes. 

In order to obtain the precise determination of the sediment volume, a 5 ml 

sediment sample was taken using a cut-off syringe. Afterwards, the excess of sediment 

was removed from the open end of the syringe. 

For methane and C2+ compounds concentration measurements, the sediment 

samples were stored in the syringes and afterwards were extruded into two types of glass 

serum vials with two different volumes (24,24 ml and 21,26 ml). Then, in order to 

terminate any remaining bacterial activity, 7 ml of NaOH was added to the sediment 

sample contained in the glass serum vials. Finally, the vial was immediately capped with a 

rubber septum and an aluminium crimp seal and vigorously shaken in order to equilibrate 

the pore water methane within the headspace.  

Methane concentration in the headspace was measured by Gas Chromatography 

(GC), by injecting 100 µl of headspace using a syringe with the same volume. The 

equipment used was a gas chromatograph (5890A, Hewlett Packard), equipped with 

packed stainless steal Porapak-Q column and a flame ionization detector. Helium was 

used as carrier gas. The gas peaks were then integrated by an integrator.  

The methane concentration in the headspace was calculated from the integrated 

area of the methane peak by comparison with a standard curve obtained previously, 

based on 100 ppmV and 1000 ppmV methane standards. The pore water methane 

concentration was then calculated. 

For sulphate concentration measurements, sediment samples were taken with a 

cut-off syringe, transferred into plastic tubes and fixed with zinc chloride (ZnCl2), in order 

to fix the dissolved sulphide and to prevent further oxidation to sulphate.  

The tubes were closed with a plastic cap and the samples were stored. In the 

laboratory, the samples were centrifuged and half of the supernatant was taken for further 

analysis. The samples were then diluted in distilled water (1:100 dilution). This dilution is 

necessary to prevent the interference of chloride ions with sulphate.  Then, 100 µl of the 

diluted and filtered sample was injected and measured by nonsuppressed ion

chromatography (Waters WISP 712 HPLC Pump; Waters IC-Pak 50 x 4.6 mm anion 

exchange column; Waters 730 Autosampler; Sevogor Plotter). An isophtalic acid solution 

was used as eluant. 

 

IV.3.3 – Sulphate reduction rates 

Sulphate reduction, a key process in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter 

in marine sediments, is performed by sulphate reducing bacteria, which reduce sulphate 

to sulphide (Kallmeyer, et al.; 2004). This process can be generally described by the 

following equation. 

2 CH2O + SO42- ? 2 HCO 3- + H2S      (IV-3) 

The SR rates were measured based on the reduction of sulphate to sulphide, 

considering that part of this sulphate may have been partially oxidized.  

The use of radioactive compounds is 

an important tool for the determination of 

rates, pathways and intermediate 

compounds in the sulphur cycle. Sulphate 

reduction rates (SRR) were determined with 

incubation experiments, using 35SO42- as a 

radiotracer. 

At each depth, three replicates of 

samples collected by multicoring as well as 

one abiological control sample (“blind 

value”) were taken for SR rate 

measurement. The method used for SR rate 

measurement is the method described by 

(Kallmeyer et al., 2004), which is 

summarized below. 

On board, sediments recovered with 

1 cm depth intervals were separately 

injected with trace amounts of 35SO42- and incubated for a short period of time (24-48h), at 

in situ temperature. The bacterial sulphate reduction was stopped by adding a 20% zinc 

acetate (ZnAc) solution to the sediment sample. Subsequently, zinc precipitates to form 



MMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  

67 

solid reduced compounds. This way, the total reduced 35S is preserved as solid 

compounds such as Zn35S and Fe35S. 

The 35SO42- was separated from the radioactive products by centrifuging the tubes 

(4500 rpm, 5 min) containing the sample and then two 100 µl samples of the supernatant 

were carefully removed. One was kept for further analysis and the other one was stored to 

in case there is the need of repeating the analysis. 

In order to obtain the total reduced inorganic sulphur (TRIS), a cold single step 

distillation was performed using the distillation apparatus proposed by Kallmeyer, et al. 

2004 (figure IV-3). Figure IV-4 shows the device used in this work. 

Initially, the sediment was ressuspended in 20 ml N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). 

This compound, which is an organic solvent frequently used to promote the reaction, 

improves the recovery of elemental sulphur (ES). ES is not a significant fraction of the 

total TRIS but may contain a significant fraction of the radioactively labelled sulphide 

(Kallmeyer et al., 2004).  

 

Figure IV-4  Cold distillation device used in this work for the measurement of SR rates.  

 

The sediment sample was then transferred into a three-neck round-bottom glass 

flask with a magnetic stir bar. The flask was then flushed for ten minutes and 8 ml HCl (6 

M) plus 16 ml CrII-solution (1M) were added trough the chemical port, in order to release 



CChhaapptteerr  IIVV  

68 

all reduced inorganic sulphur species. The TRIS were then trapped into a 7 ml ZnAc  (5 

%) trap, using a flux of nitrogen. 

The 35SO42- radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by transferring the 

entire volume of the ZnAc trap into a counting vial, adding 1 ml of H2O and 2 ml of a 

scintillation cocktail (Lumasafe Plus). The radioactivity of the remaining SO42- and of Zn35S 

was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The scintillation counter has an 

inherent background which takes part in the total number of counts (Kallmeyer, J. et al.; 

2004). This sample background is composed by three different components (Kallmeyer, J. 

et al.; 2004). 

BS = BC + BD +  BT        (IV-4) 

Where: 

BS = sample background 

BC = counter blank 

BD = distillation blank 

BT = tracer blank 

 

Kallmeyer et al. (2004) proved that, in the cold distillation method, the counter 

blank and the distillation blank together are approximately equivalent to the counter blank. 

Therefore, only the latter one is taken in consideration. As regards the tracer blank, for 

each station samples denominated “blind values” were used. These are abiological control 

samples, which are samples where no Zn35S is formed, due to the fact that before the 

injection of the tracer the bacterial sulphate reduction was stopped by adding ZnAc (20%). 

Hence, these “Blind Values” allow the estimation of the amount of non-reduced 35S that 

was transferred from the labelled sediment to the trap during the distillation. 

During this process the samples were weighted three times (1st: tube plus 

sediment plus ZnAc; 2nd: tube plus sediment; 3rd: empty tube). This way, it was possible to 

calculate the amount of sediment used in the distillation. Afterwards, based on the 

radioactivity of the 35SO42- and of the reduced H235S it was also possible to calculate the 

sulphate reduction rates (SRR) using the equation proposed by (Kallmeyer et al.; 2004).

IV.3.4 – Anaerobic oxidation of methane rates 

AOM is a process through which methane is oxidized using sulphate as the 

terminal electron acceptor and can be directly measured using radiotracer experiments, 

with 14CH4 as a tracer. This way, it is possible to quantify the conversion of 14CH4 to 14CO2, 

and to calculate the process rate. The method used in this work is similar to the one 

proposed by Iversen &amp;amp; Jorgensen (1985). 

The samples were incubated anaerobically between 24 and 48 hours with 50 µl of 
14CH4 tracer solution, which was transformed into 14CO2. AOM was then stopped by 

transferring the sample to 50 ml glass vials containing 25 ml of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 

and immediately closing the vial with a rubber stop. This allowed the separation of the 

CO2 that remained dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from the CH4 which remained 

in the headspace. The method used comprises three steps: 

 

a) Measurement of the total methane of the sample 

Total CH4 of the sample was measured by ion gas chromatography. For this 

procedure, 200 µl of the headspace were taken and injected into the gas chromatograph. 

This volume is neglectable in face of the total volume of the headspace and therefore will 

not interfere with further 14CH4 measurements. CH4 concentration was then calculated. 

 



CChhaapptteerr  IIVV  

70 

 

b) Combustion of 14C-methane to 14C-carbon dioxide 

The total CH4 in the headspace was burned so that it was possible to measure the 

total amount of 14CH4 indirectly through the amount of 14CO2 after burning. For this 

purpose, the burning device illustrated in figure IV-5 was used. The way this system works 

is to connect the sample headspace to a furnace through an artificial air flow, where it is 

burned at 850ºC. Then the 14CO2 is trapped into two succeeding 20 ml scintillation vials 

containing 1 ml of phenylethylamine plus 7 ml of ethylenglycolmonomethylether 

(methoxyethanol). This chemical mixture is used to trap the 14CO2 in the scintillation vials. 

The scintillation vials containing the previous chemical mixture and the 14CO2 were 

removed from the burning system and 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold) was added. 

Then, both vials were measured in a scintillation counter, and the amount of 14CO2 was 

calculated through the activity measured in the scintillation counter.

used to trap the remaining 
CO2 in the sediment.  

c) CO2 shaking method 

This method was used to calculate the total 

amount of 14CO2 trapped in the sediment. Therefore, in 

the first place, sediment samples were weighted inside 

the vials without the lid, and transferred together with 15 

ml of sodium hydroxide 2,5% (NaOH 2,5%) into a 250 ml 

Erlenmeyer flask. Afterwards, the Erlenmeyer flask was 

closed with a special rubber stopper connected to a 

scintillation vial (figure IV-6) containing 1 ml 

phenylethylamine and 1 ml of sodium hydroxide 0,5 M 

(NaOH 0,5 M).  

At last, using a syringe with a long needle, 6 ml of 

hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the sample through 

the rubber stopper and the Erlenmeyer flask was tightly 

closed with a metal holder. The hydrochloric acid (HCl) 

was used in order to degas the CO2 and the 

phenylethylamine was used to trap it in the scintillation 

vial. 

AOM rates were calculated by the ratio between the amount of CH4, which was 

determined by gas chromatography, the amount of 14CH4 determined by combustion and 

the amount of 14CO2 determined by the shaking method. The following equation (Treude, 

2003) was used in order to calculate AOM rates.

IV.3.5 – Biomarker analysis 

Approximately 80 ml of sediment samples were collected from the Captain 

Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes using gravity and multicores and carbonate 

crusts were recovered from Hesperides and Faro mud volcanoes using a TV-guided grab 

sampler. Both sediment and carbonate crust samples were stored at -20 ºC. 

The method used for biomarker analyses encompasses three main steps: (1) 

sediment extraction; (2) fatty acids saponification; (3) separation of neutral fraction into 



CChhaapptteerr  IIVV  

72 

hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols. These steps are resumed in the laboratory protocol 

presented in Appendix III. The figure IV-7 shows the device used for the lipid extraction. 

 

A.    B.  

Figure IV-7   Lipid biomarker analysis device used in this work (Max Planck Institute, 
Bremen). 

 

The extraction procedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters (1) was 

carried out according to Elvert and co-workers (2003). The total lipid extract (TLE) was 

obtained from approximately 25 g of wet sediment. The TLE was extracted by subsequent 

ultrasonication using organic solvents of decreasing polarity (2). Internal standards of 

known concentration and carbon isotopic compositions were added prior to extraction. 

Esterified fatty acids (FA’s) present in glyco and phospholipids were cleaved by 

saponification with a KOH-solution. After the extraction of the neutral lipid fraction from 

this mixture, FA’s were methylated for analysis with BF3 in methanol yielding fatty acid 

methyl esters (FAMES).  

Neutral lipids were further separated into hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols (3) 

using a silica glass cartridge (0.5 g packing) (SPE). Prior to separation, the column was 

rinsed three times with 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v). After application of the 

neutral fraction, solvent mixtures of increasing polarity were subsequently added: 

(I) 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v); 

(II) 5 ml n-hexane/dichloromethane (2:1, v/v); 

(III) 5 ml dichloromethane/acetone (9:1, v/v). 

Neutral lipid fractions (hydrocarbons (I), ketones (II) and alcohols (III)) were 

collected in 25 ml tipped flasks and the excess solvent was evaporated down to 100 µl 



MMeetthhooddoollooggyy  aanndd  LLaabboorraattoorryy  PPrroocceedduurreess  

73 

using rotary evaporation. Finally, neutral lipid fractions were stored at -20 °C for further 

processing and/or analysis.  

The identification of microbes involved in AOM was determined with comparative 

lipid biomarker fingerprints. This was based on the fact that ANME-2 is characterized by 

high amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to archaeol and the presence of crocetane. ANME-

1, in contrast, contains archaeol but minor amounts of sn2- hydroxyarchaeol and no 

crocetane. Nevertheless, it should be noted that isoprenoid hydrocarbons could not be 

measured in the sediment samples used in the present work. Desulfosarcina (DSS) 

associated to ANME-2 show a balanced ratio i-C15:0/ai-C15:0, a high abundance of 

C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6. In contrast, DSS associated to ANME-1 are characterised by high 

amounts of ai-C15:0 to i-C15:0 and contains only little C16:1?5 and no cyC17:0?5,6. 

 

IV.3.6 – Stable carbon isotope analysis 

The concentration, identity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual 

compounds were determined by GC (Gas Chromatography), GC-MS (Gas 

Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry) and GC-IRMS (Gas chromatography – Infrared 

Mass spectrometry) analysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and operation modes 

of the GC, GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set according to Elvert et al. (2003). 

Concentrations were calculated against internal standards. The acquired mass spectra 

were compared with known standards and published data. Stable isotope ratios are given 

in the ?-notion against Pee Dee Belemnite ?13C-values of fatty acids.

To better understand and correlate the multicore and gravity core samples 

recovered from the Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, both were depth 

aligned. This is needed because of the fact that multicoring allows collecting sediments 

only until a maximum depth of only 50 cm bsf, whereas gravity coring allows retrieving 

sediments from a few meters deep, with the disadvantage of loosing an unknown quantity 

of sediment on the top centimetres of the core. Therefore, the exact depth of the samples 

collected from the top of gravity cores had to be tentatively aligned in order to correspond 

to the same depths in the multicores. For this propose, the sulphate concentration profile 

was used as reference. It was assumed that sulphate concentration is a function of depth 

and that the environment is horizontally homogeneous. As such, the gravity core sulphate 

profile was aligned with the multicore sulphate profile and the amplitude of the depth 

interval of sediment that was lost during the gravity core retrieving could be checked. 

As a result, the gravity core depth was shifted 40 cm downwards in the case of the 

Captain Arutyunov mud volcano and 12,5 cm downwards in the case of the Bonjardim 

mud volcano.  

Below, the results obtained are presented separately for each studied mud 

volcano. In the next chapter (Chapter VI – Discussion), these results will be discussed, 

correlated and compared with other similar systems. 

 

V.1 – Methane and C2+ hydrocarbons concentrations 

 

V.1.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

Methane concentrations in the sediments from this mud volcano, reach a 

maximum of approximately 2 mM at an approximate depth of 38 cm bsf in the multicore 

profile. Above this depth there is a sharp decrease of methane, which is totally consumed 

at a depth of 25 cm bsf. Above this depth, methane concentration is nearly zero until the 

sediment surface. Methane concentrations measured in the gravity core samples are quite

similar to the ones measured in the multicore samples, reaching a maximum close to 2 

mM (figures V-1A and V-6A). 

Similar to the methane profile, the profile for the C2+ hydrocarbons shows that the 

concentration of these compounds also decreases between 40 cm bsf and the seafloor 

(figure V-2 e V-6B). The gas composition of the hydrocarbons from this mud volcano is: 

&gt;99% methane,&amp;lt;0,4% ethane,&amp;lt;0,07% propane with trace amounts of butane, which is in 

agreement with thermogenic origin. 

 

V.1.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

Methane concentrations here have a maximum value of approximately 2,5 mM at a 

depth of approximately 100 cm bsf. From this depth towards surface, a decrease in 

methane concentration is observed, which reaches a value close to zero at 45 cm bsf. 

The sharpest decrease is observed at the depth interval between 45 and 70 cm bsf, which 

seems to be the SMTZ. Above 45 cm bsf towards the surface, almost no methane 

concentration is detectable. The methane profile in Bonjardim mud volcano is shown in 

figures V-1B and V-7A. 

C2+ hydrobarbons concentration was also measured and, similarly to methane, C2+ 

compounds also decrease greatly between 45 and 70 cm bsf (figure V-2). Here, the 

hydrocarbon composition is &gt; 81% methane, &amp;lt;14% ethane, &amp;lt;4,5% propane, and&amp;lt;0,4% 

of butane; which also indicates a clear thermogenic origin. 

 

V.1.3 – Ginsburg mud volcano 

The maximum methane concentration here was registered at 42 cm bsf, with a 

value of approximately 1,5 mM. Between this depth and 6 cm bsf, methane concentration 

decreases sharply. No methane was detected above 6 cm bsf (figure V-1C). In the 

Ginsburg mud volcano only gravity cores were collected and therefore it is important to 

remember that the depths referred here are probably not exactly.  

 

V.1.4 – No Name mud volcano 

Here, the highest methane concentration value was detected at the lowest part of 

the core, at 417 cm bsf (figure V-1D). From this depth towards surface there is a gradual 

decrease of methane concentration. It is important to highlight a 60 cm interval, between 



CChhaapptteerr  VV  

76 

317 cm bsf and 285 cm bsf where methane is almost totally consumed, reaching a 

concentration value very close to zero at the depth of 235 cm. Above 235 cm, methane 

was undetectable. This indicates that the No Name mud volcano has the deepest SMTZ 

of the mud volcanoes analysed so far, localized between 317 and 235 cm bsf. 

 

V.1.5 – Gemini mud volcano 

In this mud volcano it was possible to identify a depth interval, between 50-230 cm 

bsf, where methane concentrations decrease from 1,7 mM at 230 cm bsf to almost zero at 

50cm bsf (figure V-1E). However, the methane concentrations’ decrease along this 

interval is not homogeneous. Between 140 and 120 cm bsf, methane concentration stays 

constant (0,6 mM), which indicates that, in this 20 cm depth interval, methane is not being 

consumed. Based on the methane profile, it is possible to anticipate that the SMTZ must 

be situated between 50 and 230 cm bsf. 

 

V.2 – Sulphate concentrations 

 

V.2.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

In this mud volcano, near to the ocean floor, concentrations are close to the typical 

sea floor concentration (approximately 28 mM) and remain like this from the sea floor until 

25 cm bsf. Between this depth and 40 cm bsf, there is as a distinct layer with a strong 

decrease in sulphate concentrations. The sulphate is completely consumed at around 75 

cm bsf (figures IV-1A and IV-6A). 

It is possible to distinguish a depth horizon in the sediment where both methane 

and sulphate are strongly consumed, which is the sulphate-methane transition zone 

(SMTZ). In the sediments from the Captain Arutyunov mud volcano, this depth is between 

25 and 40 cm bsf. See highlighted horizon in figure V-6A. 

 

V.2.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

Regarding sulphate, as expected, near the surface, the sulphate concentration is 

close to the sea water sulphate concentration (28 mM) and stays constant with depth until 

20 cm bsf. At this depth, the sulphate concentration starts decreasing until 70 cm bsf 

where its concentration is nearly zero. In this case, the depth interval where the sharpest 



RReessuullttss  

77 

decrease is observed is between 30 and 55 cm bsf, which is not exactly coincident with 

the depth interval of maximum decrease of methane, although it is reasonably close 

(figure V-1B). 

 

V.2.3 – Ginsburg mud volcano 

Here, close to the sea floor, as expected, the sulphate concentration is close to 28 

mM. From the ocean floor to 50 cm bsf, the sulphate concentration decreases intensively. 

Below 50 cm there is a gradual increase in the sulphate concentration (figure V-1C). 

Considering this information, it can be concluded that the SMTZ, in the sediments from 

this mud volcano, is located between the surface and approximately 50 cm bsf, although 

this horizon is most likely situated a few centimetres below, considering that we only have 

gravity core data available for this mud volcano. 

 

V.2.4 – No Name mud volcano 

The sulphate concentration here has a maximum value close to the sea floor 

(approximately 28 mM), and shows a constant decrease until 270 cm bsf (figure V-1D). 

Taking into account this information and also the methane concentration profile, it is 

possible to distinguish the SMTZ between 200 and 320 cm bsf. Nevertheless, the SMTZ 

depth might be a few centimetres below, for the same reason that was pointed out for the 

Ginsburg mud volcano. 

 

V.2.5 – Gemini mud volcano 

Sulphate decreases here from approximately 28 mM at the surface, to close to 

zero at 150 cm bsf (figure V-1D). Below 150 cm, sulphate concentrations remain 

undetectable throughout the entire core. Consequently, the SMTZ location on the 

methane profiles should not be comprised between 50-230 cm bsf, but between 50-150 

cm bsf. 

Like in the previous mud volcanoes, taking into account that only gravity cores 

where recovered from this mud volcano and that, in gravity cores there are always a few 

top centimetres of the core that are lost, it is most likely that the SMTZ is actually a few 

centimetres below.

V.3 – Sulphate reduction and anaerobic oxidation of methane rates 

 

V.3.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

In the Captain Arutyunov mud volcano sediments, AOM rates are nearly zero at 

the surface and increase with depth to a maximum of 10 nmol cm-3 d-1 at approximately 38 

cm bsf. Between this depth and 40 cm bsf there is an abrupt decrease in AOM rates, 

which are nearly zero at the lowest limit of the SMTZ (figure V-3A and V-6C). 

As regards SR rate profile, it is quite similar to the AOM rate profile, indicating a 

sharp increase in SR rates between 25 and 40 cm bsf (figure V-3A and V-6C). The depth 

horizon where this increase is observed corresponds to the SMTZ. Below 40 cm bsf, 

sulphate is completely consumed, and therefore the SR rate is nearly zero. The highest 

rates are registered at an approximate depth of 38 bsf with a value close to 25 nmol cm-3 

d-1 (figures V-3A and V-6C).  

 

V.3.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

The sulphate reduction rates’ profile for this mud volcano is in agreement with the 

methane and sulphate profiles. In this case, SR rates show more than one peak. The first 

peak has a value close to 8 nmol cm-3 d-1 (38 cm bsf) and the second SR rate peak 

reaches a value of 15 nmol cm-3 d-1 at approximately 55 cm bsf. The latter is coincident 

with the SMTZ found in the methane and sulphate profiles described previously. Below 55 

cm the SR rates decrease constantly with depth and reach a value close to zero at 100 

cm bsf where, based on the sulphate concentration profile, there is no evidence of 

sulphate penetration in the sediment anymore (figures V-3B and V-7C).  

AOM rates also peak at the SMTZ, although the values are too high when 

compared with SR rates. The maximum AOM rate in Bonjardim was detected at 

approximately 58 cm bsf, with a value of 2,6 nmol cm-3 d-1. Above and below this depth, 

AOM rates rapidly decrease (figures V-3B and V-7C). 

 

V.3.3 – Ginsburg mud volcano 

Sulphate reduction rates along the core retrieved from the Ginsburg mud volcano 

have values very close to the detection limit. Near to the surface the value is close 0,2 



CChhaapptteerr  VV  

80 

nmol cm-3 d-1 (figure V-3C). This value decreases until 65 cm bsf and, at 75 cm bsf, there 

is a slight peak with a magnitude of 0,3 nmol cm-3 d-1. 

The highest value for AOM rates registered in the sediments from the Ginsburg 

mud volcano were approximately 2,2 nmol cm-3 d-1 at 75 cm bsf (figure V-3C). Below this 

depth rates decrease rapidly until the bottom of the gravity core. 

It is therefore evident that there is a decoupling of SR and AOM in this core, which 

is revealed by the difference in the depth where SR and AOM were detected and by the 

difference of magnitude of the rates. 

 

V.3.4 – No Name mud volcano 

At the No Name mud volcano, the highest SR rates were measured at 195 cm bsf 

with a value of approximately 1,8 nmol cm-3 d-1 (figure V-3D), forming a distinct peak. 

Above this depth SR rates decrease intensively; the same happens below. 

On the other hand, AOM measurements only revealed a slight increase in the 

rates at the bottom of the gravity core, at a depth of approximately 285 cm (figure V-3D). 

The maximum rate registered at this depth is 0,13 nmol cm-3 d-1. Similar to Ginsburg mud 

volcano, there is also here evidence of a mismatch of AOM and SR rates, both in the 

depth horizon, and in the order of magnitude. 

 

V.3.5 – Gemini mud volcano 

In the sediment core from the Gemini mud volcano, two main SR rate peaks are 

observed at the SMTZ previously identified (V-3E). The first peak is detected at 50 cm bsf 

with a magnitude of 4,7 nmol cm-3 d-1. The second peak and also the highest rates 

detected have a value of 6,5 nmol cm-3 d-1 and are registered at 92,5 cm bsf. There is no 

evidence of sulphate reduction below the 150 cm bsf, and therefore there is no sulphate 

penetration below this depth (V-3E). 

In the lower half of the core, between 70 and 235 cm bsf, there is a clear peak of 

AOM rates (figure V-3E). This peak is situated at 125 cm bsf and has a value of 2,6 nmol 

cm-3 d-1. Above this depth, AOM rates decrease slightly until 92,5 cm and then continues 

to decrease intensively to the surface.

V.4 – Lipid biomarker analysis 

 

V.4.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

Several bacterial lipids show concentration peaks at the SMTZ. This is the case for 

bacterial specific fatty acids such as C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6, which considerably increase at 

the SMTZ (figure V-4, V-6E and table V-1). Below the SMTZ, the concentration of these 

bacterial-related compounds strongly decreases. Also to be noticed is the fact that i-C15:0 

and ai-C15:0 abundances are quite similar. The ratio between these two compounds is 0.7 

(table V-1). This is indicative for DSS associated to ANME2.  

It was also registered, at the SMTZ, the increase of several archaeal alcohols, 

which are archaea-related lipid biomarkers. In figure V-6G two of them are represented: 

archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Both compounds increase in the SMTZ and sharply 

decrease just below it. The ratio between archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol is 0.6, which 

is indicative for the presence of the association DSS/ANME2 (table V-1).

V.4.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

Similar to the Captain Arutyunov mud volcano, it was also detected in the 

Bonjardim mud volcano an increase in concentration of bacterial related fatty acids at the 

SMTZ. Compared with Captain Arutyunov the increase of these values is lower. In figure 

V-5 the profile of the concentration of several fatty acids extracted from the sediments of 

Bonjardim mud volcano is shown. Although the abundance of these compounds is not as 

high as in the case of Captain Arutyunov, a discrete peak of several fatty acids is 

observed at 58 cm bsf. This is the case for example of C16:1?5 and ai-C15:0 (figure V-5 and 

V-7E). The ratio between ai-C15:0 and i-C15:0 is very low (? 0,12), traducing the great 

abundance of ai-C15:0 comparably to i-C15:0 (table V-1). This is indicative for DSS 

associated to ANME1.  

Lipid biomarkers for archaea were also detected, for example archaeol and sn2-

hydroxyarchaeol, which show an evident peak 58 cm bsf, precisely at the same depth the 

bacterial fatty acids peak and also at the SMTZ (figure V-7G). The ratio between archaeol 

and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol is 1,42, which reveals the greater abundance of archaeol 

comparably to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol (table V-1), which is also indicative for DSS/ANME1 

associations.

V.4.3 – Carbonate crusts from the Faro mud volcano 

Several bacterial lipid biomarkers such as i-C15:0, ai-C15:0 and  C16:1?5 (table V-1) 

were extracted from the Faro mud volcano.  The most abundant fatty acid at this site is ai-

C15:0 which has been described as related with SRB.  cyC17:0?5,6 was not detected at all. 

This types of fatty acids are related with the presence of DSS/ANME1. 

Also several archaeal related lipid biomarkers were detected. Among the archaeal 

specific diether lipids, archaeol is the most abundant and only very low amounts of sn2-

hydroxyarchaeol were registered (table V-1), which is also indicative for DSS/ANME1 

association. 

Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were also found, dominated by PMI:2 (9 isomers) 

followed by PMI:1 (2 isomers) and also considerable amounts of crocetane (table V-1). 

 

V.4.4 – Carbonate crusts from the Hesperides mud volcano 

Similar to the Faro mud volcano, several carbonate crusts were found and in the 

Hesperides mud volcano and were analysed for the lipid content. Typical bacterial and 

archaeal lipids were extracted, but the bacterial fatty acids, as for example ai-C15:0, only 

were found in low amounts at Hesperides. Only trace amounts of C16:1?5 were found and 

cyC17:0?5,6 was not detected. The most common bacterial fatty acids at Hesperides are 

C16:0 and C18:0 which are not associated with SRB. 



CChhaapptteerr  VV  

84 

Concerning archaeal specific diethers, only archaeol was found and among the 

isoprenoidal hydrocarbons, the most abundant is PMI:0 (2,6,10,15,19-

pentamethilglicosane). 

 

V.5 – Stable carbon isotope analysis 

 

V.5.1 – Captain Arutyunov mud volcano 

After identification and plotting of the bacterial and archaeal lipid biomarkers 

extracted from along the sediments cores recovered from the Captain Arutyunov mud 

volcano, the stable carbon isotope signatures of these compounds were also analysed. As 

regards bacterial-related fatty acids, the ?13C values of C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6 at the SMTZ 

reach values of approximately -80‰ (figure V-6G and table V-1) and for the  archaeal 

lipids the lowest measured value was -92 ‰ (in sn2-hydroxyarchaeol) (figures V-6F, V-6G 

and table V-1), which indicates a biogenic origin of methane at this site. 

 

V.5.2 – Bonjardim mud volcano 

The stable carbon isotope analyses carried out for the bacterial and archaeal lipid 

biomarkers identified in the sediments from the Bonjardim mud volcano, detected low ?13C 

values. For fatty acids, the lowest detected value was -49 ‰ (in C16:1?5) and for the 

archaea specific lipids the minimum value registered was -83 ‰ (in sn2-hydroxyarchaeol) 

(figure V-7F and V-7G). 

 

V.5.3 – Faro mud volcano carbonate crusts 

Both bacterial and archaeal lipids, extracted from the carbonate crusts recovered 

from the Faro mud volcano, reveal very low ?13C signatures (table V-1). As regards 

bacterial fatty acids, the most depleted one is i-C15:0 presenting a value of -99‰, while 

among the archaeal specific diethers the most depleted is archaeol with a value of -114 

‰.  

 



RReessuullttss  

85 

V.5.4 – Hesperides mud volcano carbonate crusts 

Bacterial fatty acids did not show a strong depletion in ?13C (ai-C15:0 ? -43‰), 

which is a value that is related to thermogenic origin of methane. On the other hand, the 

the lipid biomarker ?13C signatures for archaeol reached the value of -97‰, and the most 

depleted isoprenoidal hydrocarbon is PMI:0 with -87 ‰, which are values that do not 

confirm the thermogenic origin for methane.

V.6 – Summary of main results 

In the studied mud volcanoes methane concentrations oscillate between 1,5 and 

2,5 mM. In most cases, the SMTZ is quite shallow and in most of the cases, this horizon is 

situated above 100 cm depth. The only exceptions are the No Name mud volcano where 

the SMTZ was found between 200 and 320 cm bsf and the Gemini mud volcano where 

the methane consumption zone is observed between 50-150 bsf. No Name mud volcano 

is therefore the one where sulphate penetrates deepest in the sediment reaching 

approximately 3 m below sea floor. 

In all the cases the methane and sulphate profiles are sharp and the transition 

zones are very well defined. Bellow the SMTZ there is no significant sulphate penetration 

in the sediments, giving evidence of coupled methane and sulphate consumption at this 

depth horizon.  

No significant variations in sulphate concentration profiles are observed in any 

case; sulphate exhibits a pronounced decrease with depth until it is completely consumed 

and its concentration becomes zero. 

The phospolipid-derived fatty acids extracted from the sediments from the Captain 

Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes gave, in the first case, evidence for DSS 

associated with ANME1, and in the second case, the values were indicative for 

DSS/ANME2. The archaea biomarkers, archaeol and sn2-hydroxyachaeol also gave the 

same evidence.

VI.1 - Discussion 

Concentration measurements of methane and sulphate indicate that sulphate-

dependent AOM is a widespread microbial process that defines a clear SMTZ 

characterized by a total depletion of methane in this sediment horizon. This is also 

confirmed, in the case of Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes by the 

sulphide profiles. Sulphide, which is a product of SR coupled to AOM, also peaks at the 

SMTZ. 

The increase of AOM and SR rates at the SMTZ depth indicates that the 

ascendant methane is consumed anaerobically coupled with sulphate reduction, which is 

leading to a total depletion of the two compounds in the sub-surface sediments. This is 

more clearly observed in sediments from Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud 

volcanoes, but it is also observed in the Ginsburg, Gemini and No Name mud volcanoes.  

Attempts to rank seep and AOM activity puts the mud volcanoes studied in this 

work in low to medium range, in comparison with other well studied methane seeps. In the 

Namibian Shelf,  in the north western Black Sea Shelf and in the western Argentinean 

Basin for example, the SMTZ is located several meters bsf and methane fluxes are low, 

with values usually&amp;lt;55 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Hensen et al., 2003; Jørgensen et al., 2001; 

Niewöhner et al., 1998). These values are comparable to those found in the Ginsburg, 

Gemini and No Name mud volcanoes, respectively, but they are generally lower than the 

measured AOM activity at Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes. 

The maximum values of ex situ AOM measured rates are two orders of magnitude 

lower in comparison with habitats characterized by high methane turnover rates such as 

Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico and the Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano, where AOM rates 

integrated over depth below Beggiatoa mats are usually &gt;4000 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Joye et al., 

2004; Treude et al., 2003. In sediments of highly active systems, this value can exceed 

500 nmol cm-3 d-1 (Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003). 

Generally, methane and sulphate are consumed at a 1:1 ratio during syntrophic 

AOM (Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). The observed offset in the measured

rates gives therefore evidence that AOM accounts only for a fraction of SR. This indicates 

a carbon input besides methane. The presence of C2+ compounds in the sediments of the 

Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, as well as the probable presence of 

petroleum in sediments of the Ginsburg mud volcano, shows that a complex mixture of 

higher hydrocarbons besides methane is transported from the deep reservoirs to the 

shallow sediments. 

These compounds are then consumed anaerobically, most likely together with 

sulphate in sediments at the SMTZ, resulting in SRR that exceed AOM. This line of 

evidence is further supported by measured rates showing a lower ratio of AOM relative to 

SR accompanied by a higher content of C2+ compounds in the sediments from the 

Bonjardim mud volcano, compared with the sediments from the Captain Arutyunov mud 

volcano.  

Therefore, it is probable that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation accounts for a 

substantial fraction of the measured SRR presented in this study which is comparable to 

previous findings from the Gulf of Mexico where SRR, most likely fuelled by anaerobic 

oxidation of higher hydrocarbons, may exceed AOM by 20-fold (Joye et al., 2004). 

Moreover, sulphide, showing the highest concentration at the SMTZ depth, is apparently 

consumed in both the overlying and the underlying horizons. The upward flux of sulphide 

might be controlled by the motile bacteria Beggiatoa, which are known to oxidize sulphide 

with stored nitrate in reduced sediments. 

Abundance studies (fingerprinting) of specific lipids is a common tool to identify 

organisms chemotaxonomically (Madigan et al., 2000). This approach has been used 

extensively to identify methanotrophic organisms, since a high carbon isotope 

fractionation leads to very low ?13C signatures in the lipid biomass. Thus, single lipid 

compounds of methanotrophic organisms can be distinguished from those that are not 

methane derived in a mixture of organisms with different physiological functioning.  

Elevated concentrations and associated low ?13C signatures of specific archaeal 

and bacterial membrane lipids extracted from sediments from the SMTZ at Captain 

Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, suggest that AOM is mediated by a microbial 

community consisting of a consortia of archaea and SRB. 

Furthermore, the presence of these lipids in authigenic carbonates shows that 

AOM causes carbonate precipitation both in the Hesperides and the Faro mud volcanoes. 

However, relative abundances of the archaeal isoprenoid alcohols, archaeol and sn2-

hydroxyarchaeol, and of the bacterial fatty accids i-C15:0, ai-C15:0, C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5.6, 



DDiissccuussssiioonn  aanndd  ccoonncclluussiioonnss

indicate that differences of environmental parameters of the studied mud volcanoes are 

selective for a diversity of methanotrophic communities.  

A low ratio of archaeol to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol in the sediments from the Captain 

Arutyunov mud volcano is in good agreement with published data for ANME2. These 

archaea usually form aggregates with SRB of the DSS cluster which contain high amounts 

of the unusual fatty acids, C16:1?5 and cyC17:1?5,6, which are amoung the most abundant 

and 13C most depleted fatty acids at Captain Arutyunov mud volcano sediments. 

Moreover, equal amounts of iso and ante-iso branched C15:0 fatty acids were reported for 

DSS associated with ANME2, whereas ANME1 associated DSS contain high amounts of 

ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0. 

However, the presence of the fatty accid C17:1?6, which is clearly detectable and 

strongly 13C depleted in our samples indicates that bacteria other than DSS are involved 

in AOM. This fatty acid has previously been found in a variety of SRB such as 

Desulforhabdus, Desulfomicrobium and Desulforhobpalus species (Knoblauch et al., 

1999) as well as in  Desulfobulbus. The latter has been reported as a syntrophic partner in 

AOM but, in contrast to the present data, without the simultaneous occurrence of 

cyC17:0w5,6. A first conclusion would be that AOM at Captain Arutyunov mud volcano is 

mediated by predominant amounts of ANME2/DSS and to a lesser extend by 

ANME2/DSB. 

Assuming the present data, a contribution of ANME3/DSB seems also possible as 

the lipid signature of ANME2 and ANME3 is significantly different in the hydrocarbon 

fraction; however, this hypothesis cannot be tested because we could not measure this 

fraction due to contamination problems. Nevertheless, in comparison to cyC17:0w5,6 and 

C16:1?5, the ?13C signature of C17:1?6 is less depleted, which indicates a C17:1?6 producing 

SRB on an AOM derived carbon substrate. The ?13C values of archaeal and bacterial 

lipids are high, in general, with respectively -30 ‰ and -45‰. These values are in good 

agreement with published data from cold seeps with high methane turnover rates directly 

indicating that AOM is the predominant biomass generating process at the SMTZ in the 

Captain Arutyunov mud volcano. 

On the other hand, the sediments from the Bonjardim mud volcano SMTZ, are 

characterized by equally high amounts of ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5 relative to i-C15:0. These 

abundance values for fatty acids are both indicative for DSS associated with ANME1 and 

ANME2. Correspondingly, the ratio of archaeol to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol is in good 

agreement with published values for ANME1, ANME2 and ANME3. However, neither 



CChhaapptteerr  VVII  

92 

cyC17:0?5,6 or C17:1?6 were detected, which might be due to the overall low concentrations 

of lipids in the sediments from the Bonjardim mud volcano. The low ?13C signatures for 

specific archaeal and bacterial biomarkers indicate that a process, other than AOM, 

significantly contributes to the lipid biomass. This is in good agreement with co-occurring 

high amounts of fatty acids presenting ?13C signatures associated to heterotrophic 

processes. 

The lipid composition in the authigenic carbonates from the Hesperides and the 

Faro mud volcanoes is in very good agreement with published values for DSS/ANME1 

communities. However, unlike carbonates from the Faro mud volcano, comparably high 

?13C values of fatty acids in the carbonates from the Hesperides mud volcano indicate a 

contribution to biomass of processes other than AOM. 

Apparently, AOM and heterotrophic microbial processes co-occurred while AOM 

induced carbonate precipitation entrapped both types of microbes. Another difference is 

the generally low concentration of lipids from the carbonates from the Hesperides mud 

volcano compared to Faro mud volcano. An explanation for this phenomenon could be 

that the sampled crusts from the Hesperides mud volcano are older and exposed to 

diagenesis for a longer period of time. A rather recent formation of the sampled 

carbonates from the Faro mud volcano is likely, as these were stained black from sulphide 

and recovered together with some specimens of the clam Acharax which is, in a methane 

dominated environment, indicative for low AOM activities in a sub-surface horizon.

VI.2 - Conclusions 

 

The data discussed in this work gives strong evidence that methane and higher 

hydrocarbons, rising through conduits from deep reservoirs, are all consumed within the 

sediments, and therefore do not reach the water column, at the present state of activity. 

High sulphide concentrations show that methane and higher hydrocarbon oxidation 

processes are mediated under anaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, AOM and SR rates 

peak in a distinct and narrow sulphate-methane transition zone at various depths below 

25 cm bsf. In comparison with other methane dominated environments of the world’s 

oceans, AOM activity in the Gulf of Cadiz is low to mid range and is generally exceeded 

by SR because a substantial fraction of this process is fuelled by the anaerobic oxidation 

of higher hydrocarbons which are expelled from the deep reservoirs of the studied mud 

volcanoes as well. Lipid biomarker analysis gives strong indications that AOM in the mud 

volcano sediments from the Gulf of Cadiz is mediated by various types of the previously 

described ANME .  

Furthermore, this process has resulted in the precipitation of vast amounts of 

carbonates in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz. However, only scarce traces of 

methane oxidation processes were found in surface sediments. This, together with the 

absence of observation, during the GAP cruise, of visible fluid or gas escape, indicates 

that methane, in this area, is generally oxidized in comparably deep sediment horizons. In 

contrast, highly active cold vents such those found at Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico or 

Håkon Mosby mud volcano, which discharge methane into the oxic marine hydrosphere, 

are characterized by high methane and sulphate turnover rates in surface sediments 

(Boetius et al., 2000; Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003; Niemann et al unpubl.). To be 

noticed is the fact that evidence of located gas seepage was detected over the Mercator 

mud volcano in the recent TTR-15 cruise (Pinheiro, pers. comm.). 

Only a few small patches covered with Beggiatoa mats were found during the GAP 

cruise in the Faro mud volcano, indicating that the presence of comparably high methane 

contents in surface sediments is a localized phenomenon. Also only a few Solemyid clams 

were recovered from the Faro mud volcano and previously from the Ginsburg mud 

volcano (Gardner, 2001). Although, Pogonophora were found previously and recovered 

from Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim mud volcano (Pinheiro et al., 2003), in the results 

of the present study, namely rate the rates of the biogeochemical processes, did not 

indicate a high activity at the present state.  Nevertheless, in some mud volcanoes, mud 



CChhaapptteerr  VVII  

94 

breccia was found without the recovery of a layer of hemipelagic sediments, suggesting 

recent activity. 

Therefore, the five mud volcanoes studied on the scope of this thesis do not 

apparently contribute significantly to atmospheric methane at their present state of activity. 

However, there is evidence for extensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past, as indicated 

by the widespread  occurrence of massive carbonate chimneys and crusts along or in 

close proximity to the main channels of the Mediterranean outflow water in the northern 

part of the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). There is also 

good evidence of multiphase activity of mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz, as shown by 

typical “Christmas tree” structures observed on high-resolution seismic profiles (Somoza 

et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2002). It is therefore possible that the activity of mud 

volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity at present.

ABSTRACT 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is a tectonically active area of the European continental margin and 

characterised by a high abundance of mud volcanoes, diapirs, pockmarks and carbonate 

chimneys. During the R/V SONNE expedition “GAP- Gibraltar Arc Processes (SO175)” in 5 

December 2003, several mud volcanoes were explored for gas seepage and associated 

microbial methane turnover. Pore water analyses and methane oxidation measurements in 

sediment cores recovered from the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov, 

Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and a newly discovered mud volcano like structure called “No 

Name” show that thermogenic methane and associated higher hydrocarbons rising from 10 

deeper sediment strata are completely consumed within the seabed. The presence of a distinct 

methane-sulphate transition zone (SMT) overlapping with high sulphide concentrations reveal 

that methane oxidation is mediated under anaerobic conditions with sulphate as the electron 

acceptor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction (SR) rates  show 

maxima in distinct subsurface sediment horizons at the SMT. The position of the SMT varied 15 

between mud volcanoes at depths from 20 to 200 cm below sea floor. In comparison to other 

fluid flow impacted environments of the world oceans, AOM activity (&lt;383 mmol m-2 yr-1) 

and diffusive methane fluxes (&lt;321 mmol m-2 yr-1) in mud volcano sediments of the Gulf of 

Cadiz are low to mid range. AOM was generally exceeded by SR, most likely because other 

hydrocarbons were oxidized anaerobically by sulphate reducing microbes. Corresponding 20 

lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library analysis give evidence that AOM is mediated by 

a mixed community of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and associated sulphate reducing 

bacteria (SRB) in the studied mud volcanoes. Little is known about the variability of methane 

fluxes in this environment but the 13C-depleted lipid imprint in carbonate crusts that litter the 

sea floor of mud volcanoes in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz shows that extensive, 25 

methane-related carbonate precipitation once took place. However, actual sea floor video

observations showed only scarce traces of methane emission and associated biological 

processes at the seafloor. No active fluid or free gas escape was observed visually. In 

combination wit the observed depletion of methane in subsurface sediments, this indicates 

that the contribution of methane to the hydrosphere and potentially to the atmosphere is 

insignificant at present. 5

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
Methane is an aggressive greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 21 to 56-fold 5 

higher compared to CO2 (Manne and Richels, 2001; Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).  In recent 

years, increasing research effort has therefore been dedicated to elucidate sources and sinks of 

methane. Anthropogenic sources as well as natural emission from wetlands contribute to the 

global flux of methane to the atmosphere by 74% (396 Tg yr-1) (Judd et al., 2002). Recently, 

mud volcanism has been identified as an important escape pathway of methane and higher 10 

hydrocarbons (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Judd et al., 2002). Mud volcanism is caused 

by various geological processes at continental margins such as tectonic accretion and faulting, 

rapid burial of sediments and fluid emissions from mineral dehydration. These processes can 

lead to an abnormally high pore fluid pressure and the extrusion of mud and fluids to the 

surface which is often accompanied by the expulsion of methane and higher hydrocarbons 15 

(Charlou et al., 2003; Kopf, 2002; Milkov, 2000; Somoza et al., 2003). Mud volcanoes (MVs) 

are structurally diverse ranging in shape from amorphous mud pies to conical structures and 

in size from a few meters to kilometres in diameter and height, respectively (Dimitrov, 2002). 

Global estimates suggest that terrestrial and shallow water mud volcanoes contribute between 

2.2 and 6 Tg yr-1 of methane to the atmosphere and that 27 Tg yr-1 of methane may escape 20 

from deep water mud volcanoes (Dimitrov, 2003; Milkov et al., 2003). While there is a 

reliable number of ~900 known terrestrial mud volcanoes, estimates for marine mud 

volcanoes range between 800 and 100000, which makes any budget calculations very 

preliminary (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Milkov, 2000; Milkov et al., 2003). Previous 

estimates suggested that the contribution of the worlds oceans to atmospheric methane is 25 

small with 2-3% at present (Houghton et al., 1996; Judd et al., 2002; Kvenvolden, 2002; 

Reeburgh, 1996). However, such estimates do not account for locally focused gas seepage 

from structures like mud volcanoes and other types of cold seeps.

The main sink for methane in the ocean is the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate 

as electron acceptor (Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Iversen and Jørgensen, 1985; Nauhaus et 

al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). This process is mediated by archaea, operating most likely in 

cooperation with sulphate reducing bacteria. So far, two groups of anaerobic methanotrophic 

archaea (ANME-1, ANME-2) have been identified (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 1999; 5 

Hinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2001b; Pancost et al., 2000; Thiel 

et al., 1999). They usually occur together with SRB from a distinct, yet uncultivated cluster 

within the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (Seep-SRB1) (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et 

al., 1999; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Knittel et al., 2003; Knittel et al., 2005; Michaelis et al., 2002; 

Orphan et al., 2001; Pancost et al., 2000; Thiel et al., 1999). Generally, microbial methane 10 

oxidation is characterized by a strong discrimination against the heavy, stable carbon isotope 

13C, leading to a significant depletion in the 13C-content of metabolites and biomass (Elvert et 

al., 1999; Orphan et al., 2001b; Summons et al., 1994; Thiel et al., 1999; Whiticar, 1999; 

Whiticar et al., 1986). Such conspicuous isotope signatures of specific lipid biomarker for the 

archaeal and bacterial partners in AOM mediating communities has been a main tool in 15 

studying the diversity and functioning of cold seep ecosystems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; 

Elvert et al., 2003; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et 

al., 2001b). 

During the UNESCO program “Training through Research (TTR)”, numerous mud volcanoes 

hosting methane-hydrate were discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 20 

2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Mazurenko et al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2002). However, the 

occurrence of methane emission to the hydrosphere and the geochemical and microbiological 

activity of these potential seep structures remained unknown. During the SO-175 expedition 

“GAP”, we studied several mud volcanoes with the aid of sea-floor video imaging as well as 

video-guided sampling of sediments and carbonate crusts. The main focus of this 25 

investigation was to find the hot spots of methane turnover, to estimate the magnitude of 



 

 6

methane consumption in the sediments of several mud volcanoes using ex situ rate 

measurements and diffusive flux calculations, as well as to identify the key methanotrophs 

using lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA methods.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

 
2.1. Geological Setting  

 5 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located west of the Gibraltar Arc, between Iberia and the African plate 

(Fig. 1). This area has experienced a complex tectonic history with several episodes of 

extension, strike-slip and compression related to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, the opening 

of the N-Atlantic, and the African-Eurasian convergence since the Cenozoic (Maldonado et 

al., 1999). During the Tortonian, a large olistrostome body made of eroded material from the 10 

Betic Cordillera (Spain) and Rif Massif (Morocco) was emplaced west of the Straits of 

Gibraltar (Maldonado and Comas, 1992; Somoza et al., 2003). Due to the ongoing 

compression, these rapidly deposited sediments dewater intensely and form MVs and fluid 

escape structures (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003). The Gulf of Cadiz has been intensely surveyed 

with geophysical tools, leading to the discovery of the first MVs, mud diapirs and pockmarks 15 

in 1999 (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003). In addition, an extensive 

field of mud volcanoes and diapiric structures covered with carbonate chimneys and crusts 

was discovered along or in close proximity of the main channels of the Mediterranean outflow 

water (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Kopf et al., 2004; 

Somoza et al., 2003).  20 

In the present study, Captain Arutyunov (Capt. Arutyunov), Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, 

Hesperides and Faro MV and a newly discovered structure termed “No Name”, were 

investigated (Fig. 1, Tab. 1). Prior to biogeochemical sampling, the sea floor of selected MVs 

was monitored with the video-sled OFOS or with a video-guided multiple-corer (MUC, Tab. 

1).  25 

 



 

 8

2.2. Sample Collection and Storage  

 

 Sediments of several mud volcanoes were sampled by gravity coring in the central crater 

region (Tab. 1, Fig. 2). Additionally, surface sediments of Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim 

MV were obtained with a video-guided MUC because the top decimetres of sediment cover 5 

are usually lost during gravity core retrieval. Video-guided MUC sampling enabled the 

retrieval of undisturbed surface sediments of up to 50 cm sediment depth. Gravity coring 

retrieved up to 5 m of sediment. To account for an unknown loss of surface sediments during 

gravity coring, we aligned the depth of gravity cores obtained from Capt. Arutyunov and 

Bonjardim MV according to the vertical sulphate profiles of MUC-cores recovered from one 10 

site, assuming that sulphate concentrations are mainly a function of depth in proximate cores. 

According to this procedure, the top sediment horizons of the recovered gravity cores were 40 

and 12.5 cm below seafloor at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, respectively. Aligning 

proximate core sections is an approach to account for a loss of an unknown quantity of 

surface sediments during gravity coring. However, this approach can be problematic if spatial 15 

variability of geochemical gradients is high. 

Upon recovery, gravity cores were sectioned into 1 m pieces and vertically cut in halves, prior 

to sub sampling. All cores were immediately transferred into a cold room and subsampled for 

concentration measurements of volatile pore water constituents (methane, sulphate, sulphide), 

AOM and SR rate measurements according to Treude et al (2003, 2005), as well as for lipid 20 

biomarker and 16S rDNA analyses (Tab. 1). Sediments for measurements of methane and 

sulphate concentrations and turnover rate measurements were subsampled vertically with 

push cores (acrylic core liners, 26 mm diameter, n = 3) from MUC-cores. Gravity cores were 

subsampled by plugging glass tubes (60 mm length, 10 mm diameter, n = 5) in selected 

sediment horizons. The tubes were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers to allow for an 25 

anaerobic incubation of the sediment plug. Sediment samples for pore water extraction, 



 

 9

biomarker and 16S rDNA analyses were collected from 2 cm sections of MUC cores and 

from selected horizons of gravity core sections. Directly after subsampling, pore water from 

these sediment horizons was extracted by pressure filtration (5 bars) through Teflon squeezers 

provided with 0.2 µm cellulose acetate filters according to previous works (Hensen et al., 

2003; Niewöhner et al., 1998). Subsequently, the pore water was immediately fixed (see next 5 

section). Lipid and DNA samples were stored in cleaned glass vials at –20°C until extraction 

in the home laboratory. Carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV were collected with a 

video guided grab-sampler (Tab.1). Upon recovery, carbonate crusts for lipid biomarker 

analyses were transferred into plastic bags and stored at –20°C until extraction. 

 10 

 

2.3. Methane Concentrations  

 

 Methane concentrations in sediments were determined according to the “head space” method 

from 5 ml sediment fixed with 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) in a diffusion-tight glass vial as 15 

described previously by Treude and co-workers (2003). A vertical resolution of 2 cm was 

chosen for MUC cores whereas for gravity cores, a vertical resolution of 20-30 cm was 

chosen.  Methane concentrations were determined shortly after the cruise (&lt;2 month) using a 

gas chromatograph as described elsewhere (Treude et al., 2003). The chromatography system 

was calibrated for a concentration range of 0.001 to 5 mM methane (final concentration in the 20 

sediment). Sediment samples from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were additionally 

analysed for the concentrations of the higher hydrocarbons (C2+) ethane, propane, isobutene 

and butane (?butane) using the above-described chromatography setting with a temperature 

gradient. Subsequent to injection at 40°C, the temperature was increased at a rate of 2°C min-1 

to 200°C and held for 20 min. Identity and concentrations of methane and C2+-compounds 25 

were determined with standards of known hydrocarbon compositions. 



 

 10

2.4. Sulphate and Sulphide Concentrations  

 

Standard methods were applied for sulphate and sulphide analyses. Sulphide concentrations 

were determined immediately after sampling by adding 1 ml of pore water to 50 µl of a zinc 

acetate gelatine solution. Sulphide was quantitatively removed as ZnS and kept in colloidal 5 

solution. After adding a colour reagent the concentration was determined photometrically by 

measuring the absorbance after 1 hour at 670 nm (see more detailed descriptions at 

http://www.geomar.de/zd/labs/labore_umwelt/Analytik.html). Sulphate concentrations were 

determined on 2 ml sub-samples of filtered pore water using a Sykom-S ion chromatography 

system. Samples were diluted by 1:54 with the eluent (7.5 mM Na2CO3-solution).  10 

 

 

2.5. Diffusive Flux Calculations 

 

 Local fluxes (J) were calculated from the vertical profiles of pore water constituents 15 

(methane, sulphate, sulphide) according to Fick’s first law of diffusion assuming steady state 

conditions (e.g. Niewöhner et al., 1998 and references therein),

For each mud volcano, D0 values were corrected for temperature (3 to 12°C, depending on the 

actual bottom water temperature), resulting in values ranging between 291 to 392, 178 to 244 



 

 11

and 356 to 434 for methane, sulphate and sulphide, respectively (Boudreau, 1997). ?  was 

determined from the weight loss per volume of wet sediment after drying to stable weight at 

60oC. In general, ?  decreased with depth showing values of 57 - 76% in the top sections and 

51 - 60% in the bottom sections of the retrieved MUCs and GCs (data shown for the SMT, 

Tab. 2).  5 

 

 

2.6. Ex-situ AOM and SR Rate Measurements  

 

Sediment for turnover rate measurements recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim 10 

MV were incubated on board according to previously described methods (Treude et al., 2003; 

Treude et al., 2005). Briefly, 25µl 14CH4 (dissolved in water, 2.5 kBq) or 5 µl 35SO42- tracer 

(dissolved in water, 50 kBq) were injected into butyl rubber sealed glass tubes from gravity 

core sub-sampling and in 1 cm intervals into small push cores (whole core injection) used for 

MUC sub-sampling. Incubation was carried out for 24 h at in situ temperature in the dark. 15 

Subsequently, incubated AOM and SR rate samples were fixed in 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) 

and 25 ml zinc acetate solution (20%, w/v), respectively. Further processing of AOM and SR 

rate samples was performed according to Treude et al  (2003) and references therein. 

Turnover rates were calculated according to the following formulas:

 12

microbial rates with the diffusive fluxes of methane and sulphate, AOM and SR rates were 

integrated over depth in cores 9036-2 and 9051-2, respectively. 

 

 

2.7. Extraction of Sediment and Carbonate Samples and Preparation of Derivates 5 

 

 Sediments from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV as well as carbonate crusts from 

Hesperides and Faro MV were analysed for lipid biomarker signatures. The extraction 

procedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) was carried out according to 

Elvert et al. (2003). Briefly, total lipid extracts (TLE) were obtained from ca. 20 g of wet 10 

sediment and from authigenic carbonates disintegrated with HCL (2M) prior to extraction. 

The TLE was extracted by subsequent ultrasonication using organic solvents of decreasing 

polarity. Internal standards of known concentration and carbon isotopic compositions were 

added prior to extraction. Fatty acid moieties present in glyco and phospholipids were cleaved 

by saponification with methanolic KOH-solution. After extraction of the neutral lipid fraction 15 

from this mixture, fatty acids (FAs) were methylated with BF3 in methanol yielding FAMES. 

Double bond positions of monoenoic FAs were determined by analysis of dimethyl disulphide 

adducts according to methods described elsewhere (Moss and Lambert-Fair, 1989; Nichols et 

al., 1986). 

Neutral lipids were further separated into hydrocarbons, ketones and alcohols on a SPE silica 20 

glass cartridge (0.5 g packing) with solvents (5 ml each) of increasing polarity (n-

hexane/dichloromethane (95:5, v/v), n-hexane/dichloromethane (2:1, v/v), 

dichloromethane/acetone (9:1, v/v)). Alcohols were derivatised with 

bis(trimethylsilyl)triflouracetamid (BSTFA) forming trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers prior to 

analyses.  25 

 



 

 13

2.8. Gas Chromatography  

 

Concentrations of single lipid compounds were determined by gas chromatography analysis 

using a Varian 30 m apolar CP-Sil 8 CB fused silica capillary (0.25 mm internal diameter 

[ID], film thickness 0.25 µm) in a Hewlett Packard 6890 Series gas chromatograph equipped 5 

with an on column injector and a flame ionisation detector. Initial Oven temperature was 

80°C. Subsequently to injection, the initial temperature was increased to 130°C at a rate of 

20°C min-1, then raised to 320°C at a rate of 4°C min and held at 320°C for 30 min. The 

carrier was helium at a constant flow of 2 ml min-1 and the detector temperature was set to 

310 °C. Concentrations were calculated relative to internal standards present within the 10 

respective lipid fraction.  

 

 

2.9. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Gas Chromatography-Isotope 

Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC-IRMS) 15 

 

 Identity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual compounds were determined by GC-

MS and GC-IRMS analysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and operation modes of 

the GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set according to Elvert et al. (2003). Identities of 

acquired mass spectra were compared to known standards and published data. Stable isotope 20 

ratios are given in the ?-notation against Pee Dee Belemite. ?13C-values of FAs and alcohols 

were corrected for the introduction of additional carbon atoms during derivatisation. Internal 

standards were used to monitor precision and reproducibility during measurements. Reported 

?13C-values have an analytical error of ±1‰. 

 25

2.10. DNA extraction and clone library construction 

 

 Total community DNA was extracted from sediments (ca. 1 g) collected from the SMT of 

Capt. Arutyunov MV (30-40 cm) using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Biogene, Irvine, 

California, USA). Samples were bead-beat in a Fastprep machine (Q-Biogene, Irvine, 5 

California, USA) at speed 4.5 for 30 seconds. All other steps in the DNA extraction procedure 

were preformed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Almost full-length 

archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified from sediments samples using the 

primers 20f (Massana et al., 1997) and Uni1392R (Lane et al., 1985) for archaea and GM3F 

(Muyzer et al., 1995) and GM4R (Kane et al., 1993) for bacteria. Polymerase chain reactions 10 

(PCRs) were performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Otsu Japan), using 2.5 U of enzyme, 

1X Buffer, 4 mM of MgCl2, 4 mM of each dNTP, 1 µM of each primer and 2 µl of template 

in a 50 µl reaction. PCR reactions were preformed in a Mastercycler machine (Eppendorf, 

Hamburg, Germany), with the following cycling conditions: 95°C for two minutes, then 30 

cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 60°C (archaea) or 50°C (bacteria) for 30 seconds and 72°C for 15 

3 minutes, followed by a final incubation step at 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were 

visualized on an agarose gel, and the 16S band excised. PCR products were purified using the 

QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Two microliters of purified DNA 

were ligated in the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into 

competent E. coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s 20 

recommendations. Transformation reactions were plated on LB-agarose plates. Overnight 

cultures were prepared from individual colonies picked from these plates using the Montage 

Plasmid Miniprep 96 kit (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Purified plasmids were sequenced in one 

direction, with either the 958R (archea) or GM1F (bacteria) primers using the BigDye 

Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Samples 25 

were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyser (Foster City, USA). A total 



 

 15

of 39 archaeal and 47 bacterial clones were partially sequenced (~ 0.5 kb). Using the ARB 

software package, the sequences were calculated into existing phylogentic trees by parsimony 

without allowing a change in the tree topology. Representative sequences of each cluster were 

then fully sequenced (~1.3 kb) and matched against the NCBI data base 

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Sequences were submitted to the Genbank database 5 

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and are accessible under the following accession numbers: 

DQ004661 to DQ004676 and DQ004678 to DQ004680.

3. RESULTS 

 

3.1. Field Observations   

 

A detailed description of sea floor video observations, sedimentology and sampling locations 15 

is provided in the report of R/V SONNE cruise SO-175 (Kopf et al., 2004). The mud 

volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, and Faro studied here are cone 

shaped with a relief of up to 200 m and a maximum diameter of 4.9 km kilometres (Fig. 2a,b; 

Tab.1). Hesperides MV has comparable dimensions but is composed of 6 single cones. A new 

structure was discovered east of the TTR MV and termed “No Name” (Fig. 1). Video 20 

observations of the mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Hesperides, and 

Faro could not reveal indications for recent gas, fluid or mud expulsion (2-3 tran-sects with a 

total bottom observation time of approximately 8 hrs per mud volcano, Kopf et al., 2004). The 

central craters of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg MV were covered with light 

beige sediments (shown for Capt. Arutyunov MV, Fig. 3a). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, some 25 

sediment stretches were scattered with accretions, interpreted as clasts, which may indicate 



 

 16

past mud flows (Fig. 3b). At Ginsburg MV, a few small carbonate crusts (&lt;0.5 m) were 

observed on the seafloor. Beside these observations, no other distinctive sedimentological or 

biological features indicating gas or fluid seepage were visible on video images at Ginsburg. 

Surface sediments recovered from Capt. Arutyunov MV contained small tubeworms 

(diameter&amp;lt;&lt;1 mm), which extended down to 20 cm into the sediment. Tube worms usually 5 

harbour methane- or sulphide oxidising symbionts, indicating sulphide and/or methane 

availability in the sediments (Kimura et al., 2003; Schmaljohann and Flugel, 1987; Sibuet and 

Olu, 1998; Southward et al., 1986; Southward et al., 1981). The central areas of Hesperides 

and Faro MV were littered with fragments of carbonate chimneys and carbonate crusts 

(shown for Hesperides MV, Fig. 3c). Both, chimneys and crusts were ranging in size from 10 

several centimetres to meters in length and diameter. At Faro MV, a few, small patches 

covered with microbial mats possibly consisting of filamentous sulphide oxidising bacteria 

were observed (Fig. 3d). Moreover, grab samples recovered from this MV also contained a 

few specimens of the chemosynthetic clam Acharax sp. usually harbouring sulphide oxidising 

bacteria in their gills (Felbeck, 1983; Krueger and Cavanaugh, 1997; Peek et al., 1998; Sibuet 15 

and Olu, 1998). Video observations were not carried out at Gemini MV and the “No Name” 

structure. The MUC-cores retrieved from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV contained 

yellowish, muddy sediments in the top sections at 0-20 and 0-40 cm below sea floor (bsf), 

respectively. The bottom sections of the MUC-cores contained mud breccia. The gravity cores 

retrieved from these MVs as well as those retrieved from Ginsburg and Gemini also contained 20 

mud breccia. In contrast to the MUC-cores recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim 

MV, the mud breccia in all of the retrieved gravity cores was only covered by a thin layer 

(max. 10 cm) of yellowish mud. This directly indicates a loss of the beige surface sediments 

during sediment sampling and core retrieval. The gravity core recovered from the “No Name” 

structure contained a matrix of cold water coral fragments and greyish mud. It has to be 25 

further investigated if this structure is a mud volcano or a mud diapir. Grab samples from 



 

 17

Hesperides and Faro MV contained carbonate fragments and mud breccia. After recovery, the 

temperature in the top sediment section (~1 m) at Bonjardim MV was ca. 3°C. In contrast, the 

temperature was considerably higher at Capt. Arutyunov  (12°C), Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV 

and the “No Name” structure (10°C, respectively) most probably as a result of the warm 

Mediterranean outflow water, which contributes to the bottom water at these MVs.   5 

 

 

 

3.2. Captain Arutyunov Mud Volcano 

 10 
3.2.1. Methane, C2+, Sulphate and Sulphide  

 

Methane concentrations in surface sediments (0-20 cm, Fig. 4a) were&amp;lt;0.001 mM indicating a 

complete consumption of methane rising from deeper sediment strata. A distinct SMT was 

observed in the lower half of the MUC-core section (25 - 40 cm bsf.). The steepest gradients 15 

of methane and sulphate amounted to 0.4 and –1.12 µmol cm-4, respectively (Fig. 4a, Tab. 2). 

Small gas hydrate chips were found throughout the whole gravity core section from 44 to 235 

cm bsf (1941-1). Probably, gas hydrates were also present in the lower section of the MUC-

core (9036-2) but dissociated upon core recovery and sediment subsampling. Similar to 

methane, concentrations of C2+-compounds decreased across the SMT (Fig. 4b). 20 

Hydrocarbons in the sediment porewaters comprised methane (&gt; 99%), ethane (&lt;0.4%), 

propane (&lt;0.07%) with trace amounts of butane and isobutene present. Sulphide 

concentrations peaked in the SMT with 4.8 mM at 39 cm bsf (Fig. 4d). The steepest sulphide 

gradient was 0.63 µmol cm-4 (Fig. 4d, Tab. 2). A downward sulphide gradient could not be 

determined because highest sulphide concentrations were observed in the lowest sediment 25 



 

 18

horizon of the MUC-core at Capt. Arutyunov MV. Unfortunately, the sulphide profile could 

not be aligned continuously with the gravity core section. 

 

 

3.2.2. AOM, SR Rates and Diffusive Fluxes  5 

 

AOM and SR rates at Capt. Arutyunov MV were highest in the SMT at 39 cm bsf with 

maximum values of 11 and 25 nmol cm-3 d-1, respectively (Fig. 4c). AOM and SR rates 

sharply decreased above and below this horizon. A 1.8-fold higher areal SR compared to 

AOM indicates an additional electron donor fuelling sulphate reduction (Tab. 2). The areal 10 

AOM and SR rate were in good agreement with diffusive fluxes showing a 1.7-fold higher 

sulphate flux compared to the methane flux. The sulphide flux to the surface (upward flux) 

was comparable to the total downward flux of sulphate (Tab. 2).  

 

 15 

3.2.3. Lipid Biomarker 

 

Diagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations were strongly increased in sediments at 

the SMT (Fig. 4c,e). At this horizon (-31 cm), stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest 

depletion in 13C with minimum values of –92‰ (sn2-hydroxyarchaeol) in archaeal specific 20 

diether lipids and –82‰ (cyC17:0?5,6) in bacterial specific FAs (Tab. 3, Fig. 4d,e). The 

concentration of both archaeal and bacterial lipids decreased just above and below this 

sediment horizon. At the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 1.6:1 

(Tab. 3). Other diagnostic, archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons such as 2,6,11,15-

tetramethylhexadecane (crocetane) could not be measured due to an unresolved complex 25 

mixture in all of the hydrocarbon fractions. Similarly, specific archaeal diethers and bacterial 



 

 19

FAs could not be resolved from this background below 40 cm sediment depth. The 

concentrations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were roughly one order of magnitude lower in 

comparison to specific bacterial FAs. 

The FA fraction in sediments at the SMT was dominated by C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6 and 

contained  comparably high amounts of FA C17:1?6 (Tab. 3). Both, C16:1?5 and cyC17:0?5,6 were 5 

the most 13C-depleted FAs. However, all other FAs in the C14 to C17 range carried 

significantly  13C-depleted  isotope  signatures  as  well  with  values  ranging  between  -65‰  

 (C16:1?9) to –75‰ (C14:0). C18-FAs were comparably enriched in 13C as shown by ?13C -

values ranging between -25‰ (C18:0) to -31‰ (C18:1?7) most likely indicating a planktonic 

origin of these compounds. Concentrations of mono- and di-alkyl glycerol ethers (MAGEs 10 

and DAGEs, respectively) presumably of bacterial origin were low in all samples recovered 

during cruise SO-175. Thus, a detailed analysis of these compounds was not carried out. 

However, sediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov Mud Volcano comprised comparably 

high contents of MAGEs relative to DAGES with ?13C values ranging from –65‰ to -85‰ 

(data not shown). The MAGEs comprised a suite of alkyl moieties, which is comparable to 15 

those of the fatty acids found at Capt. Arutyunov MV. The suite of fatty acids extracted from 

the tube worms comprised dominant amounts of the FAs C16:1?7 and C18:1?7 and to a lesser 

degree C16:0 and C18:0 with uniform ?13C-values of about -40‰, indicating chemoautotrophic 

carbon fixation (data not shown). The alcohol and hydrocarbon fractions were not analysed.

3.2.4. Phylogenetic diversity  

 

 Two clone libraries, one archaeal and one bacterial, were constructed to study the 16S rDNA-

based microbial diversity in sediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov  MV (30-40 cm bsf). 25 

The 16S rDNA archaeal clone library consisted of 9 phylogenetic groups (Tab. 4). Closest 



 

 20

relatives of these groups were found among seep-endemic, uncultured archaea and bacteria. 

The majority of sequences obtained were related to the ANME-2 group (59% ANME-2a, 3% 

ANME-2c of all archaeal sequences) which is known to mediate AOM (Boetius et al., 2000; 

Knittel et al., 2005; Orphan et al., 2002). The second most abundant group (18% of all 

archaeal sequences) was found to belong to the ANME-1 cluster which is also known to 5 

mediate AOM (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002). The 

bacterial clone library consisted of 10 uncultivated bacterial lineages. Similar to the archaeal 

sequences, the next relatives of all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences belonged to uncultivated 

organisms that are commonly found at methane seeps (Knittel et al., 2003, Tab. 4). The 

closest relatives of the most abundant cluster of sequences (81%) belonged to the Seep-SRB1 10 

group which comprises the bacterial partners of ANME-1 and ANME-2 (Knittel et al., 2003). 

Other phylogenetic groups of bacteria were represented by single clone sequences (&lt;2%).  

 

 

3.3. Bonjardim MV 15 

 

3.3.1. Methane, C2+, Sulphate and Sulphide  

 

 A distinct SMT was observed in the top meter of the gravity core section. After alignment 

with the MUC-core section, the actual depth of the SMT was determined between 45 and 70 20 

cm bsf (Fig. 5a). As the two core sections overlap, the concentration gradients can be 

determined from the gravity core section alone or from aligned profiles in the overlapping 

zone (Fig. 5a,d). Here, we used both approaches in order to investigate the potential range for 

the diffusive fluxes. The steepest methane and sulphate gradients in the gravity core section 

were determined with 0.09 and –0.76 µmol cm-4, respectively (Fig. 5a, Tab. 2). Aligning the 25 

gravity core and MUC-core sections, the steepest sulphate gradient was –1.67 µmol cm-4. 



 

 21

Methane concentrations declined below the depth at which the two core sections overlap. 

Hence, no concentration gradient from core alignments was possible. Methane concentrations 

in surface sediments (0 – 52 cm sediment depth) were&amp;lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete 

consumption of methane in the SMT. C2+-concentrations were comparably high with values 

of &gt;0.25 mM at a sediment depth below 1 m (Fig. 5b). Similar to methane, concentrations of 5 

C2+-compounds decreased across the SMT (Fig. 5b) indicating a consumption of these 

compounds. Gaseous hydrocarbons comprised methane (&gt;81%), ethane (&lt;14%), propane 

(&lt;4.5%) and ?butane (&lt;0.4%). Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with 5.3 mM at 

52.5 cm bsf (Fig. 5d). In the gravity core section, the steepest sulphide gradients were 

determined with 0.23 (upward) and –0.07 (downward) µmol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). 10 

Aligning the two core sections, the steepest (upward) sulphide gradient was determined with 

0.73 µmol cm-4. 

 

 

3.3.2. AOM, SR Rates and Diffusive Fluxes  15 

 

AOM and SR rates were highest in the SMT at 58 cm bsf with maximum values of 2.6 and 

15.4 nmol cm-3 d-1, respectively. Comparably low values of AOM and SR rates were 

measured in over- and underlying sediment horizons. A 19.3-fold higher areal SR compared 

to AOM indicates a decoupling of these two processes (Tab. 2). Considering both 20 

concentration gradients (determined from unaligned and aligned profiles), the diffusive 

downward flux of sulphate was 5.1- to 11-fold higher compared to the upward methane flux. 

Similarly, the cumulative sulphide flux (upward and downward) accounted for 77% to 92% of 

the sulphate flux. 

 25 

 



 

 22

3.3.3. Lipid Biomarker 

 

A moderate increase of diagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations was observed at 

the SMT in sediments of Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5c,e). At this horizon (-57 cm), stable carbon 

isotope analysis revealed highest depletions in 13C with minimum values of –83‰ (sn2-5 

hydroxyarchaeol) in archaeal diether lipids and –49‰ (C16:1?5) in bacterial FAs (Tab. 3, Fig. 

5d,e). At the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 0.7:1 and 

therefore lower in comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV (Tab. 3). Similar to Capt. Arutyunov 

MV, other diagnostic archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons could not be measured due to a high 

background from an unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Equally high amounts of 10 

the FAs C16:1?5 and ai-C15:0, both of which were the most 13C-depleted FAs (Tab. 3), were 

detected in sediments at the SMT. The FA cyC17:0?5,6, which was abundant at Capt. 

Arutyunov MV could not be detected in sediments of Bonjardim MV. Furthermore, dominant 

FAs such as C16:1?7, C16:0, C18:1?9 and C18:1?7 carried ?13C-signatures ?-34‰, indicating that 

these compounds are derived from processes other than  AOM.  In  contrast  to  Capt. 15 

Arutyunov  MV,  the  concentrations of diagnostic archaeal  

lipids were roughly 4-fold higher compared to specific bacterial FAs (Tab. 3). A further 

analysis of the diversity of microbial organism using 16S rDNA methods was not carried out 

at Bonjardim MV.

3.4. Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and “No Name”  

 
3.4.1. Methane, Sulphate and Sulphide 

 

The SMT was located in the upper metre of the sediment cores retrieved from Ginsburg and 5 

Gemini MV and at 2-3 m bsf at the “No Name” structure, respectively (Fig. 6a, c, e). Methane 

concentrations in sediments overlying the SMT at these structures were&amp;lt;0.001 mM. 

Sediments retrieved from Ginsburg MV had a distinct smell of petroleum with depth  below  

40 cm.  No  depth  corrections were made as only gravity cores were taken from these MVs. 

The actual depth of the SMTs was therefore most likely 10 to 40 cm below the sediment 10 

depth indicated in figure 6. In contrast to the observed depletion of sulphate below the SMT at 

Gemini MV and the “No Name” structure, sulphate concentrations showed a minimum 

between 30 to 70 cm and an increase to values ?17 mM with depth below 90 cm at Ginsburg 

MV. The total, diffusive sulphate flux was therefore calculated from both, the upward and the 

downward gradients at Ginsburg MV. At Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the “No Name” 15 

structure, methane and downward sulphate gradients ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 and –0.11 to -

0.92 µmol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). The upward sulphate gradient at Ginsburg MV was 

0.35 µmol cm-4. Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with values between 4.7 to 7.6 

mM and steepest gradients were determined with values between 0.04 to 0.32 (upward) and –

0.06 to –0.15 (downward) µmol cm-4, respectively (Tab. 2). 20 

 

 

3.4.2. Diffusive Fluxes 

 

The diffusive sulphate flux at Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the   “No  Name”  structure   25 

exceeded   the   methane   fluxes   with  15.5-,  18.5-  and  2.5-fold, respectively. This gives 



 

 24

evidence for a decoupling of AOM and SR at these structures similar to the observations 

made at Bonjardim MV  (Tab. 2). The cumulative (upward + downward) sulphide flux 

accounted for 66, 70 and 146% of the sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the 

“No Name” structure, respectively. The composition of the microbial community was not 

investigated here. 5 

 

 

3.5. Lipid biomarkers of carbonate crusts  

 
Exposed carbonate crusts were observed at the mud volcanoes Ginsburg, Hesperides and 10 

Faro. Additionally, high amounts of broken carbonate chimneys were found at Hesperides and 

Faro MV. Both crusts and chimneypieces were absent at Capt. Arutyunov MV, Bonjardim 

MV and the “No Name” structure according to our visual inspections.  We could retrieve 

crust samples from the summits of Hesperides and Faro MV for further analyses of the lipid 

signatures of the crusts.  15 

 

 

3.5.1. Hesperides MV 

 

Carbonate crusts of Hesperides MV contained archaeal and bacterial lipids diagnostic for 20 

methanotrophic communities and processes. Archaeal lipids were strongly depleted in ?13C 

with minimum values of –97‰ (archaeol) whereas bacterial FAs were only moderately 

depleted with minimum values of –43‰ (ai-C15:0, Tab. 3). Only trace amounts of sn2-

hydroxyarchaeol were detected among the archaeal diethers. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were 

dominated by 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI:0) and contained comparably low 25 

amounts of a crocetane / 2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane (phytane) mixture and ?PMI:1 



 

 25

(comprising 2 isomers). The FA fraction in the carbonate was dominated by C16:0 followed by 

C18:0 with ?13C-values &gt;-28‰ (Tab. 3). FAs putatively specific for SRB involved in AOM 

such   as   C16:1?5,   i-C15:0   and  ai-C15:0  (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003),  were 

approximately 3 to 4.8 times lower in concentration compared to C16:0.  However, in contrast 

to abundant FAs, stable carbon isotope compositions of i-C15:0, ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5 showed a 5 

moderate depletion in 13C (Tab. 3). Moreover, in comparison to specific archaeal lipids, 

diagnostic bacterial FAs were roughly an order of magnitude lower in concentration.  

 

 

3.5.2. Faro MV  10 

 

All archaeal and bacterial lipids found in carbonate crusts of Faro MV were strongly depleted 

in 13C (Tab. 3). Stable carbon isotope analysis revealed minimum ?13C values of –114‰ 

(archaeol) in diagnostic archaeal diether lipids and –99‰ (i-C15:0) in specific bacterial FAs 

(Tab. 3). Archaeal diether lipids were dominated by archaeol and contained comparably low 15 

amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were dominated by PMI:2 (9 

isomers) followed by PMI:1 (2 isomers) and relatively high amounts of crocetane/phytane. 

Specific FAs showed comparably small differences in abundance and ?13C-values (Tab. 3). 

However, ai-C15:0 was the most dominant FA with a roughly 2-fold higher concentration 

compared to i-C15:0 and C16:1?5. The FA cyC17:0?5,6 was not detected. Concentrations of 20 

specific FAs were comparable to specific archaeal lipids.

4. DISCUSSION 

 

 

4.1. Methane-Driven Geochemical and Biological Activity at the Mud Volcanoes of the 

Gulf of Cadiz 5 

 

Marine mud volcanoes have been identified as an important escape pathway of reduced 

hydrocarbon gases and may therefore contribute significantly to atmospheric green house 

gases (Dimitrov, 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Judd et al., 2002; Kopf, 2002). Methane venting at 

such cold seeps provides an energy source for methanotrophic microbes which in turn may 10 

support enormous biomasses of seep-related macrofauna and thiotrophic, giant bacteria 

(Boetius and Suess, 2004; Cordes et al., 2005; Milkov et al., 2004; Olu et al., 1997; Sahling et 

al., 2002; Werne et al., 2002). Furthermore, methane venting is often associated with 

authigenic carbonates (Aloisi et al., 2000; Hensen et al., 2004; Kopf, 2002). The Gulf of 

Cadiz is characterised by numerous mud volcanoes which have been intensely surveyed since 15 

their discovery in 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003; 

Somoza et al., 2002). Among the findings indicative of past and present methane venting at 

several mud volcanoes are the occurrence of hydrate-bearing sediments, authigenic carbonates 

and seep related biota (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; Gardner, 2001; Pinheiro et al., 2003; 

Somoza et al., 2003). Yet, the present activity of these structures in methane emission to the 20 

atmosphere remained unknown. Direct sea floor observations during cruise SO-175 revealed 

only few traces of methane seepage at the centres of the mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, 

Bonjardim, Ginsburg and Hesperides, and the “No Name” structure. No visible fluid or gas 

escape was detected with video observations, indicating that the mud volcanoes may be 

relatively inactive and that methane is completely consumed within subsurface sediment 25 

horizons. In contrast, highly active seep systems such as Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf of Mexico 



 

 27

or Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano discharge methane into the hydrosphere through focused gas 

and fluid escape pathways, despite the high methane and sulphate turnover rates controlling 

substantial fractions of the methane flux (Boetius et al., 2000; Damm and Budeus, 2003; Joye 

et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003).  

The high anaerobic methane turnover at active seeps produces high sulphide fluxes, which are 5 

utilized by thiotrophic communities, e.g. mats of giant bacteria like Beggiatoa sp., various 

chemosynthetic bivalves like Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp., Bathymodiolus sp. and by several 

tubeworm species (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). These organisms are adapted to different 

geochemical settings and can be used as indicators for high methane fluxes and turnover in 

subsurface or near surface sediments. Three types of indicator communities were so far 10 

observed at low abundances at the investigated mud volcanoes. Some small (ca. 20 cm 

diameter) blackish sediment patches covered with bacterial mats were found at Faro MV 

indicating locally elevated fluxes of methane and sulphide, which reach the surface of the 

seafloor (Fig. 6d). Few specimen of the deep dwelling thiotrophic bivalve Acharax sp.  were 

recovered from Faro MV and previously from Ginsburg MV (Gardner, 2001). Members of 15 

the family Solemyidae are mostly deep burrowing and occur in seep habitats with low or 

moderate methane and sulphide fluxes where they can take up sulphide through their foot 

from subsurface accumulations (Sahling et al., 2002; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Treude et al., 

2003). At Hydrate Ridge for instance, Acharax sp. mines subsurface sediments for sulphide 

pockets below 15 cm sediment depth (Sahling et al., 2002). As a third indicator species, tube 20 

worms were recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and previously observed at Bonjardim MV 

(Pinheiro et al., 2003). Tube worms can extend their roots very deep into sediments to profit 

from subsurface methane and/or sulphide accumulations (Dando et al., 1994; Gebruk et al., 

2003; Southward et al., 1981). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, the moderate depletion of worm-

derived membrane lipids indicates a thiotrophic feeding mode fuelled by AOM-derived 25 

sulphide rather than an aerobic methanotrophic mode.  



 

 28

4.2. Hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover at the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz  

 

The observed patterns of seep related biota is in good agreement with the observed 

geochemical gradients. All mud volcanoes investigated here showed a complete depletion of 

methane within the SMT. Elevated and corresponding AOM and SR rates within this zone 5 

give evidence that uprising methane is consumed anaerobically with sulphate by 

methanotrophic, microbial communities leading to a depletion of the two compounds in 

sediments of Capt. Arutyunov MV and Bonjardim MV at 25 to 40 cm and 45 to 70 cm bsf, 

respectively (Fig. 4a, 5a). Accordingly, concentration measurements of methane and sulphate 

and the resulting estimates of diffusive methane and sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini 10 

MV and the “No Name” structure indicate that sulphate-dependent AOM is a wide spread 

microbial process in the centres of the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. With respect to 

methane fluxes and microbial turnover rates at the time of our investigation, Capt. Arutyunov 

MV is the most active of the investigated structures followed by Bonjardim, Ginsburg and 

Gemini MV, while  “No Name” is the least active structure (Tab. 2). Furthermore, highest 15 

turnover rates and fluxes coincided with the shallowest SMT comparing all investigated MVs. 

Hence, compared to other marine gas seeps and methane-rich environments, the Gulf of Cadiz 

MVs investigated here showed a low or medium range in methane turnover rates, reflecting 

the relatively low methane fluxes. At the Namibian Shelf, the north western Black Sea Shelf 

and the western Argentinean Basin for instance, the SMT is located several meters bsf and 20 

methane fluxes are low with values usually&amp;lt;55 mmol m-2 yr-1 (Hensen et al., 2003; Jørgensen 

et al., 2001; Niewöhner et al., 1998). These values are comparable to Ginsburg and Gemini 

MV as well as to the “No Name” sructure. The AOM activity and diffusive methane fluxes at 

Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were substantially higher than those at Ginsburg MV, 

Gemini MV and the “No Name” structure. However, areal rates and diffusive fluxes at Capt. 25 

Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV are still two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to other 



 

 29

cold seeps, which bear gas hydrates at their stability limit such as Hydrate Ridge and the Gulf 

of Mexico. In such environments with active fluid flow (&gt;100 cm yr-1) and gas emission via 

ebullition, methane fluxes were estimated with values &gt;8.7 mol m-2 yr-1 (Luff and Wallmann, 

2003; Torres et al., 2002) and AOM reached values &gt;4 mol m-2 yr-1, i.e. &gt;0.5 µmol cm-3 d-1 

(Joye et al., 2004; Treude et al., 2003).  5 

At Bonjardim MV, integrated SR rates agreed best with the sulphate flux calculated from the 

aligned sulphate profile. Additionally, the deviation of integrated rates from diffusive fluxes 

calculated from the gravity core alone could be caused by the much lower resolution of 

subsamples taken from these cores. Integrated rate measurements were comparable to 

diffusive fluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Tab. 3). However, further modelling 10 

is required to assess a potential advective transport component in order to estimate total 

fluxes. Also, the roughly s-shaped sulphate concentration profile from Ginsburg MV can not 

be explained by a steady state, diffusive transport as this would require an additional sulphate 

source at about 80 cm bsf.  

In vitro experiments with sediment slurries and ex situ tracer injection assays showed that 15 

AOM and SR are in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry if methane is the sole carbon source (Nauhaus 

et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). In spite of the disproportionate loss of methane and sulphate 

caused by degassing during sampling, the deviation from the 1:1 stoichiometry between AOM 

and SR as well as between the sulphate and methane fluxes (Tab. 2) indicates the presence of 

electron donors other than methane for SR at the investigated MVs. SRB can use a variety of 20 

short and long chain alkanes and complex aliphatic and aromatic compounds (Rueter et al., 

1994; Widdel and Rabus, 2001). The energy yield from the degradation of e.g. ethane coupled 

to sulphate reduction (reaction 4) is higher than syntrophic AOM (reaction 5) (refer to 

Hanselmann et al., (1991) for Gf 0-values of the reactants).  

 25 

4C2H6 (aq) + 7SO42-(aq) ? 8HCO3-(aq) + 7HS-(aq) + 4H2O (l) + H+(aq), ?G0 = -279 kJ mol-1      (4) 



 

 30

CH4 (aq) + SO42- (aq) ? HCO3- (aq) + HS-(aq) + H2O (l),  ?G0 = -33 kJ mol-1        (5) 

 

Hence, it is possible that a substantial fraction of SR is fuelled by the anaerobic oxidation of 

C2+-compounds in sediments where methane and higher hydrocarbons co-occur. Besides the 

present observations on C2+ compounds at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, Mazurenko 5 

et al. (2003) observed a composition of hydrocarbon gases at Ginsburg MV, which is very 

similar to Bonjardim MV. The presence of substantial amounts of higher hydrocarbons in 

these MVs, as well as the likely presence of petroleum in sediments of Ginsburg MV indicate 

that methane is of a thermogenic origin in the Gulf of Cadiz, and that hydrocarbon-fuelled 

sulphate reduction could be an important microbial process in the sediments. Accordingly, 10 

AOM explained a smaller fraction of SR at Bonjardim MV, which had a higher C2+ 

concentration than Capt. Arutyunov MV (Fig. 4b-c, 5b-c, Tab. 2). This is comparable to 

previous findings from the Gulf of Mexico where SR rates exceeds AOM rates up to 10-fold, 

most likely due to the presence of a variety of hydrocarbons and petroleum in the sediments 

(Joye et al., 2004). The microbial hydrocarbon degraders at natural petroleum seeps have not 15 

been identified yet.  

Another interesting, potentially microbial process is the oxidation of sulphide in anaerobic 

sediments just above and below the depth of the SMT (Fig. 4d-6d). At least at Capt. 

Arutyunov MV, a biological control of the upward sulphide flux seems likely. At many seep 

systems, the upward sulphide flux is utilized by thiotrophic organisms such as endosymbiotic 20 

bacteria living in invertebrate organisms such as clams and tube worms (Felbeck, 1983; 

Fisher, 1990; Sahling et al., 2002; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Southward et al., 1986) and by 

various giant sulphide-oxidizing bacteria like Beggiatoa sp. and Thioploca sp. which can use 

oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors (Fossing et al., 1995; Huettel et al., 1996; Mussmann 

et al., 2003; Nelson et al., 1982). At Capt. Arutyunov MV, the tubes of the worms extend to 25 

20 cm. The upper horizon where sulphide consumption takes place is at 20 to 40 cm bsf, 



 

 31

hence it seems likely that the worms and/or gliding bacteria can be responsible for this 

process. In contrast, it appears very unlikely that organisms depending on oxygen or nitrate 

utilise sulphide below the horizon where sulphide is produced. Here, a reaction of downward 

diffusing sulphide with iron as proposed previously is a more likely explanation (Hensen et 

al., 2003; Jørgensen et al., 2004).  5 

In conclusion, our biogeochemical measurements as well as biological and geological 

observations indicate that the MVs studied during cruise SO-175 are currently not emitting 

methane and other hydrocarbon gases to the hydrosphere. However, there is evidence for 

extensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past, as indicated by the widespread occurrence of 

massive carbonate chimneys and crusts along or in close proximity to the main channels of 10 

the Mediterranean outflow water in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 

2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Another geological evidence for temporally varying activities of 

mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz are the typical “Christmas tree” structures observed on 

high-resolution seismic profiles (Somoza et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2002). Such patterns are 

probably caused by eruptive events followed by phases of dormancy. This so-called 15 

multiphase activity is a common behaviour in many terrestrial mud volcanoes (e.g. Lokbatan 

MV; Aliyev et al., 2002; Dimitrov, 2003; Kholodov, 2002). It is therefore possible that mud 

volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity at present. 

 

 20 

4.4. Identity of Methane Oxidising Communities in Sediments and Carbonate Crusts 

 

Fingerprinting of diagnostic lipids is a common tool for the chemotaxonomic identification of 

micro organisms  (Boschker and Middelburg, 2002; Madigan et al., 2000). This approach has 

been used extensively to examine anaerobic methanotrophic organisms, because the carbon 25 

isotope fractionation associated with AOM leads to specific, very depleted ?13C-signatures of 



 

 32

lipid biomarkers (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999). The 

dominance of bacterial and archaeal lipids with low ?13C-values in sediments and carbonates 

indicate that AOM is a dominant biomass-generating process at the explored MVs. 

Differences in the abundances of specific archaeal isoprenoidal diethers and hydrocarbons and 

varying contents of bacterial FAs, as well as varying ??13C values of these lipids (compared 5 

to source methane) give evidence that several phylogenetic groups of methanotrophic 

communities mediate AOM in the Gulf of Cadiz. Elevated concentrations and associated low 

?13C-signatures of specific archaeal and bacterial membrane lipids corresponded with elevated 

AOM and SR rates in sediments of the SMT at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Fig. 4e-

g, 5e-g, Tab. 3). The molecular analyses give evidence that AOM is mediated by a microbial 10 

community consisting of methanotrophic archaea and SRB phylogenetically related to those 

which were previously found at other methane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Michaelis et al., 

2002; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002). Furthermore, the presence of a similar suite of 

13C-depleted lipids in abundant authigenic carbonates recovered from Hesperides and Faro 

MV (Tab.3) indicates higher activities and a more wide spread methane turnover in the past.  15 

 

 

4.4.1. Methanotrophic Archaea 

 
Previous publications revealed dominant amounts sn2-hydroxarchaeol relative to archaeol in 20 

ANME-2 dominated habitats, whereas the reverse was observed in ANME-1 dominated 

systems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Teske et al., 

2002). Moreover, ANME-2 communities were found to comprise high contents of crocetane 

which is only present at low concentrations in ANME-1 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et 

al., 2000; Elvert et al., 1999). Moreover, stable carbon isotope fractionations were found to be 25 

higher in ANME-2 compared to ANME-1 dominated habitats with ??13C-values (archaeol 



 

 33

relative to source methane) ranging between 34 to 53‰ and 11 to 37‰, respectively 

(Blumenberg et al., 2004; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Hinrichs et al., 1999; 

Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002).  

The high ratio of sn2-archaeol relative to archaeol and a ??13C-value of 42‰ of archaeol 

compared to source methane (-48‰, Nuzzo et al., 2005) at Capt. Arutyunov MV is in good 5 

agreement with the published lipid signatures of ANME-2 dominated habitats. Furthermore, 

the dominant abundance of ANME-2 compared to ANME-1 clone sequences, together with 

the lipid biomarker fingerprint suggest a dominance of ANME-2 in sediments of Capt. 

Arutyunov MV.  

The comparably high ratio of archaeol relative to sn2-hydroxyarchaeol as well as a ??13C-10 

value of -31.5‰ of archaeol compared to source methane at Bonjardim MV (-49.5 ‰, Nuzzo 

et al., 2005) lies between published values from systems dominated by ANME-1 and ANME-

2. This suggests a mixed ANME community in these sediments.  

The low ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol in carbonate crusts obtained from 

Hesperides MV is in very good agreement with the published values for ANME-1 15 

communities. Our chromatography settings for hydrocarbon separation did not resolve 

crocetane from its isomer phytane, which is a known breakdown product of chlorophyll. 

However, the comparably heavy ?13C-value of this compound mixture provides evidence for a 

low crocetane content, which furthermore agrees with a dominant ANME-1 origin of archaeal 

lipid biomass in these carbonates. Similar to Bonjardim MV, the lipid imprint in carbonate 20 

crusts recovered from Faro MV shows characteristics of both, ANME-1 and ANME-2 

systems. Comparably low amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol would be 

indicative for ANME-1. However, high amounts of crocetane also point to a substantial 

contribution of ANME-2 to the archaeal biomass preserved in the crusts.

4.4.2. Sulphate Reducing Bacteria 

 

At many different cold seep settings, ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea have been found in 

consortium with SRB of the Seep-SRB1 cluster belonging to the 

Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (Seep-SRB1, Knittel et al., 2003). However, this cluster 5 

apparently comprises physiologically different ecotypes that are distinguished by very 

specific FA patterns according to their association to either ANME-1 or to ANME-2 

(Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003; Knittel et al., 2003). FA signatures in 

environmental systems dominated by ANME-1 / Seep-SRB1 communities comprise high 

contents of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0, whereas systems dominated by ANME-2 / Seep-SRB1 10 

communities comprise the unusual FA cyC17:1?5,6 and dominant contents of C16:1?5 but almost 

balanced ratios of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2003).  

The dominance of the unusual FAs C16:1?5 and cyC17:1?5,6 and an almost equal ratio of the iso 

and anteiso branched C15:0 FAs at Capt. Arutyunov MV are in very good agreement with the 

published lipid signatures of the Seep SRB 1 ecotype associated with ANME-2. This finding 15 

is in agreement with the predominance of Seep-SRB1 sequences in the bacterial clone library.  

As expected from the detection of potentially diverse ANME communities at Bonjardim MV, 

the FA signature shows characteristics of various SRB previously identified as bacterial 

partners in AOM. The high ratio of ai-C15:0 compared to i-C15:0 would be indicative for the 

Seep-SRB1 ecotype associated with ANME-1 while the high abundance of C16:1?5 would 20 

indicate the ecotype associated with ANME-2. However, a further assignment of FAs to 

particular SRBs remains speculative as the FA cyC17:0w5,6 specific for the Seep-SRB1 type 

associated with ANME-2 was not detected, which might be a result of the overall low 

concentrations of lipids in sediments at Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5e, f, Tab. 3). At Bonjardim MV, 

several FAs carry ?13C-signatures that are comparable to the source methane and do not show 25 

any fractionation. This indicates a contribution to carbon biomass from processes other than 



 

 35

methane consumption, possibly related to the anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons. A 

similar mixture of carbon sources could also explain the unspecific signature of FAs in 

carbonates of Hesperides MV. Similar to Bonjardim MV, FA signatures of Seep-SRB1 cluster 

associated with ANME-1 and ANME-2 were found in carbonates recovered from Faro MV. 

The comparably high content of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 and the lack of cyC17:0?5,6 is 5 

indicative for Seep-SRB1 associated to ANME-1 while relatively high amounts of C16:1?5 are 

indicative for Seep-SRB1 associated to ANME-2. In contrast to Hesperides MV, the low 

?13C-values of all lipid components analysed at Faro MV give evidence that AOM dominated 

biomass production. 

Another striking difference is the comparably high lipid concentration in carbonates recovered 10 

from Faro compared to those recovered from Hesperides MV. A rather recent formation of the 

sampled carbonates from Faro MV appears likely, as these were stained black from sulphide 

and recovered together with some living specimens of the chemosynthetic bivalve Acharax 

sp. A possible explanation for the difference in AOM-derived lipid content could be that the 

sampled carbonate crusts from Hesperides are older than those recovered from Faro MV and 15 

have  been exposed to oxic sea water and lipid diagenesis for a longer time. 

 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 20 

At the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and 

Faro as well as at the “No Name” structure, several indications for a slow fluid and gas   

transport were found. Our data suggest a complete consumption of methane and higher 

hydrocarbons in the sediments of the studied mud volcanoes at depths of 30-300 cm below 

seafloor. We found no indication of hydrocarbons reaching the hydrosphere, except from the 25 

visual observation of small patches of reduced sediments covered by giant sulphide-oxidizing 



 

 36

bacteria. The overlap of methane and sulphate depletion with sulphide production shows that 

methane and higher hydrocarbon oxidation processes are mediated microbially under 

anaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, anaerobic oxidation of methane and sulphate 

reduction rates show a peak in a distinct, narrow methane-sulphate transition zone in the 

subsurface sediments of the mud volcano centres. Highest turnover rates and fluxes coincided 5 

with the shallowest SMT depths with Capt. Arutyunov MV as the most active system in the 

study area, followed by the mud volcanoes Bonjardim, Ginsburg, and Gemini and finally the 

“No Name” structure. In comparison to other gas seeps, methane fluxes and turnover rates are 

low to mid range in the Gulf of Cadiz. In addition to AOM, a substantial fraction of the SR is 

fuelled by the anaerobic oxidation of higher hydrocarbons, which rise from deep reservoirs 10 

together with methane. Lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library from the sediments and 

carbonates of the AOM hotspots provide evidence that both of the previously described 

ANME-1 / Seep-SRB1 and ANME-2 / Seep-SRB1 communities mediate AOM at mud 

volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. The finding of their signatures in carbonate crusts at the 

centres of the investigated mud volcanoes indicates that at least some of the vast amounts of 15 

carbonates littering mud volcanoes and diapiers in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz are 

linked to methane seepage.

Figure 1. Bathymetric chart of the Gulf of Cadiz showing the locations of known mud 

volcanoes, diapirs and areas where carbonate chimneys and crusts were discovered. The mud 

volcanoes studied during the SO-175 expedition are in bold face letters. 5 

 

Figure 2. Seismic images and 3D images of multibeam bathymetry of Captain Arutyunov (a) 

and Bonjardim mud volcano (b). Seismic images show the central conduit below the mud 

volcanoes and sampling position of the cores recovered during the SO-175 expedition. 

Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV are conical shaped structures with a relief of 80 and 10 

100 m and a diameter of 2 and 1 km, respectively. Colours denote the bathymetry (m below 

sea surface). Seismic images were modified after Kenyon et al. (2001) (a) and Pinheiro et al. 

(2003) (b). 

 

Figure 3. Seafloor images of Capt. Arutyunov (a,b), Hesperides (c) and Faro MV (d). The 15 

surface of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg MV were found to be covered by pelagic 

sediments as shown in panel a. Some sediment stretches at Capt. Arutyunov MV contained 

accretions that are interpreted as clasts (b) indicating past mud flows. Hesperides and Faro 

mud volcano were found littered with carbonate chimneys and crusts as shown for Hesperides 

MV in panel (c). At Faro mud volcano, also a few dark sediment patches probably covered 20 

with giant sulphide oxidizing bacteria were observed (d). 

 

Figure 4. Captain Arutyunov mud volcano. A distinct SMT, highlighted in grey, was found 

between 25 and 40 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of higher hydrocarbons also 

decline (b). Note that AOM and SR rates (c), sulphide concentrations (d), concentrations (e) 25 

and stable carbon isotope values of diagnostic, bacterial fatty acids (f) and concentrations of 



 

 45

isoprenoidal diethers (g) all peak at the SMT. Panel (a) and (d) illustrate steepest gradients 

determined for methane, sulphate and sulphide (bold lines). Circles represent multiple corer 

and triangles gravity corer samples. Errors are given as standard errors. 

 

Figure 5. Bonjardim mud volcano. A distinct SMT, highlighted in grey, was found between 5 

50 and 70 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of higher hydrocarbons also decline (b). 

Note that concentrations of C2+-compounds are ~35-fold higher compared to Captain 

Arutyunov MV. AOM and SR rates (c), sulphide concentrations (d), concentrations (e) and 

stable carbon isotope values of diagnostic, bacterial fatty acids (f) and concentrations of 

isoprenoidal diethers (g) peak at the SMT. Panel a and d illustrate steepest gradients 10 

determined for methane, sulphate and sulphide (bold lines). Concentration gradients for 

sulphate and sulphide were determined from gravity core samples and from aligned gravity 

core and multiple-corer samples. Circles represent multiple corer and triangles gravity corer 

samples. Errors are given as standard errors. 

 15 

Figure 6. The SMT, highlighted in grey, was found in the top most m at Ginsburg (a) and 

Gemini (c) and between 2 and 3 m at No Name MV (e, note the different scale chosen for 

depth). In these horizons, also sulphide concentrations peak (b, d, f). Bold lines illustrate 

steepest gradients determined for methane, sulphate and sulphide.

Table 1. Mud volcanoes investigated during the cruise SO-175. The water depth refers to the 

highest elevation of the mud volcanoes. V = video observations, CH4 = methane 

concentration measurements, SO42- = sulphate concentration measurements, C2+ = 

concentration measurements of higher hydrocarbons, F = diffusive methane and sulphate flux 

calculation, R, AOM and SR rate measurements, L = Lipid analyses, D = DNA analysis. 25

Table 2. Concentrations gradients, diffusive fluxes and ex situ AOM and SR rates integrated 

over depth. A negative flux value indicates downward directed flux, a positive value indicates 

upward flux. * and ‡ denote gradients and total sulphate fluxes determined from aligning 

multiple- and gravity cores. Gradients in brackets indicate upward diffusing sulphate and 

downward diffusing sulphide, respectively. 5 

 

Table 3. Bacterial fatty acids, archaeal diether and isoprenoidal hydrocarbons analysed in 

sediments at the SMT of Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV as well as in carbonate crusts 

from Hesperides and Faro MV. Abundances of fatty acids were normalised to i-C15:0, archaeal 

diethers to archaeol and archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons to PMI:0. Specific lipid 10 

components are highlighted in grey. 

 

Table 4. Archaeal and bacterial 16S rDNA clone libraries obtained from sediments of the 

SMT of Captain Arutyunov MV. The Archaeal clone library is dominated by sequences 

belonging to the ANME-2 cluster and the bacterial library by sequences belonging to the 15 

Seep-SRB1 cluster.
