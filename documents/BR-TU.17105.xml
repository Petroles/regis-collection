Resumo 
Neste trabalho apresentam-se resultados preliminares de estudos mineralógicos e geoquímicos de solos de 
um sector do Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela (Maciço Ibérico, Centro de Portugal).. O estudo é parte 
de um projecto integrado que aborda de modo multidisciplinar a caracterização dos recursos 
hidrogeológicos da Serra da Estrela. O estudo do solo compreendeu diversas campanhas de amostragem, 
realizadas em 2004, entrosadas com estudos de cartografia geológica e hidrogeológica de pormenor. A 
mineralogia principal destas amostras é essencialmente detrítica, composta por filossilicatos (ilite, 
caulinite, vermiculite, interestratificados de ilite-esmectite e esmectite) acompanhados por quartzo, 
plagioclase e feldspato-K. De entre os elementos químicos maiores analisados, Al e Fe são os que 
apresentam os valores mais significativos, seguidos por K e, em algumas amostras, por Ca e Mg; o Na 
apresenta sempre valores muito baixos. Por fim, tecem-se algumas considerações sobre as condições 
geológicas relacionadas com a formação dos solos estudados. 
  
 
Abstract 
This paper presents preliminary results concerning soil mineralogy and geochemistry in a sector of Serra 
da Estrela Natural Park (Iberian Massif, Central Portugal). The study is a component of an integrated 
multidisciplinary approach planned to carry out a broad characterisation of groundwater in Serra da 
Estrela granitic massif. The soil study included several fieldwork campaigns carried out during 2004, 
along with geological and hydrogeological mapping studies. The mineralogy of these samples is basically 
detrital, consisting mainly of phyllosilicates (illite, kaolinite, vermiculite, illite-smectite mixed-layers and 
smectite), followed by quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar. Al and Fe show the higher values for the 
analysed set of elements, followed by K and, in some samples, Ca and Mg; Na shows always very low 
values. Some considerations relating to the soil formation geologic conditions are also presented.  

 
 
Introduction 

This paper presents preliminary results concerning soil mineralogy and geochemistry in a 
sector of Serra da Estrela Natural Park (Fig. 1). The study is a component of an integrated 
multidisciplinary approach intended to carry out a broad characterisation of groundwater in 
Serra da Estrela (Iberian Massif, Central Portugal). The Serra da Estrela mountain region 
presents specific geologic, geomorphologic and climatic characteristics that play an important 
role on soil formation and, therefore, on infiltration and aquifer recharge. The study area 
consists of the river Zêzere basin upstream the village of Manteigas and its surroundings, 
corresponding to ca. 28 km2. The altitude of the catchment ranges from 875m a.s.l. (at the 
streamflow measurement weir of Manteigas) to 1993m a.s.l. (at the Torre summit). The most 
important geologic units consist of Variscan granites; Precambrian-Cambrian metasedimentary 
rocks; alluvium and Quaternary glacial deposits. The main regional tectonic structure is the 
NNE-SSW Bragança-Vilariça-Manteigas-Unhais da Serra fault zone (Ribeiro 1988, Ribeiro et 
al. 1990). The most important landforms of this sector of Serra da Estrela are two plateaus, 
separated by the NNE-SSW valley of river Zêzere (Fig. 1): the Torre – Penhas Douradas plateau 
(1450-1993m a.s.l.), and the Alto da Pedrice – Curral do Vento plateau (1450-1760m a.s.l.). 
Another distinctive feature of the basin is the presence of Late Pleistocene glacial landforms and 
deposits (Daveau et al. 1997). According to Daveau et al. (1997) and Vieira &amp;amp; Mora (1998), the 
Serra da Estrela climate has a Mediterranean regime with a high mean annual precipitation 



reaching 2500mm in the upper areas. Mean annual air temperatures are below 7ºC in most of 
the plateau area and, in the Torre vicinity, they may be as low as 4ºC. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Soil features 

The main soil features in this sector of Serra da Estrela result from the way how the 
formation factors act. According to Jenny (1994), the soil system is described by the following 
factors: parent material, climate, topography, organisms and time. Human action is often 
referred as an additional item to be considered (e.g., Botelho Costa 1995). The soil study 
included several fieldwork campaigns carried out throughout 2004. During these campaigns, 
soil samples were collected in order to obtain a geochemical and mineralogical characterisation.

Materials and methods 

A total of 20 samples were collected at 10 sampling sites and prepared for mineralogical 
and chemical analysis. The samples were dried at 35-40ºC, sieved through a 80# (180 mm) 
plastic screen, homogeneized and quartered. The mineralogical analysis of samples was carried 
out, particular on their fine (80#) and clay (&lt;2µm) fractions. Mineralogical studies were based 
on X-ray diffraction, using a Phillips PW 3040/60 diffractometer. All samples were analysed in 
the range from 2º to 40º 2?, at 1° 2 ?/min, with Cu-K? radiation. The XRD reflections were 
evaluated with the Phillips X’Pert 1.2 and Profit softwares. For the semi-quantitative 
mineralogical determination, the relative content of each identified mineral was estimated on the 
basis of its characteristic peak area corrected by the corresponding reflective power (Rocha 
1993), as recommended by Schultz (1964) and Pevear &amp;amp; Mumpton (1989). The chemical 
analysis was performed in a certified commercial Canadian laboratory (ACME Analytical 
Laboratories, Ltd; ISO 2002 Accredited Lab. – Canada). Representative 0.500g subsamples 
were extracted for one hour with aqua regia (3-2-1 HCl-HNO3-H2O) at 95ºC and the extracts 
were analysed by ICP-MS for Fe, Ca, P, Mg, Ti, Al, Na, K, S, and some trace elements. 
 
Results and discussion 

The mineralogy of these samples is essentially detrital, consisting mainly of 
phyllosilicates (essentially mica/illite, kaolinite, vermiculite, illite-smectite mixed-layers and 
smectite), followed by quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar. Other accessory minerals are also 
present in smaller proportions (commonly just vestigial): siderite, opal C/CT, anhydrite, 
hematite, ilmenite, anatase, zeolites and jarosites. Samples related to granites show higher 
amounts of phyllosilicates. In these samples, illite (the predominant clay mineral for almost all 
the samples) generally decreases whereas kaolinite (and, occasionally, vermiculite and/or 
smectite) increases.

The chemical data (Table 2) is in accordance with the mineralogical composition, with Al 
and Fe presenting the higher values for the analysed set of elements, in relation to the 
predominant phyllosilicates (illites and kaolinites), followed by K and, in some samples, Ca and 
Mg. On the other hand, Na always shows very low values.     

Samples showing relatively higher values of Al, Fe and K are those related to granites and 
to glacial deposits located on slope and/or base of slope. Ca shows its higher values in samples 
related only to glacial deposits located on slope, base of slope and plateau. Ti shows some 
interesting values in samples related to an increase in kaolinite and vermiculite. 
 
Concluding remarks 

The mineralogy and geochemistry of the studied samples is, as natural, closely related to a 
detrital origin (absolute predominance of quartz, mica/illite and feldspars; more significant 
values of Al, Fe and K)  nevertheless putting in evidence some distinctive features such as: 
samples related to granites show higher amounts of phyllosilicates (but show a decrease in illite 
whereas kaolinite increases); samples showing more significant values of Al, Fe and K are those 
related to granites and to glacial deposits located on slope and/or base of slope whereas Ca 
shows its higher values in samples related only to glacial deposits located on slope, base of 
slope and plateau.
