RESUMO: O uso de software capaz de remover a dispersão nas taxas de arrefecimento petrológicas em
migmatitos e granulitos da Faixa Ribeira (Brasil) revela padrões de arrefecimento congruentes com
resultados termocronológicos baseados na integração de múltiplos sistemas isotópicos: a) os migmatitos
arrefeceram rapidamente a partir de altas temperaturas, diminuindo as taxas de arrefecimento com o
tempo; b) os granulitos experimentaram taxas de arrefecimento baixas a altas temperaturas, seguindo-se
um período curto de arrefecimento muito rápido, aumentando as taxas de arrefecimento durante a
retrogradação.

PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Taxas de arrefecimento petrológicas; Difusão Fe-Mg; Faixa Ribeira; charnockitos.

ABSTRACT: The use of software that removes dispersion from petrological cooling rates in migmatites and
granulites from Ribeira Belt (Brazil) shows that these results are in broad agreement with
thermochronological results based on integration of multiple isotopic systems: a) migmatites cooled
rapidly from high temperatures, decreasing cooling rates through time; b) granulites endured low
cooling rates at high temperatures, being followed by fast cooling, increasing cooling rates during
retrogression.

KEYWORDS: Petrological cooling rates; Fe-Mg diffusion; Ribeira Belt; charnockites.

1. INTRODUCTION
Several authors have tried to use mineral diffusion mechanisms in order to determine cooling

rates (e.g.: Spear &amp;amp; Parrish, 1996 and references therein). These authors assumed that diffusion
induced by compositional variation in the garnet-biotite interface is a function of Kd(Mg/Fe)Garnet-
Biotite in response to thermal changes, such as cooling during retrogression. During cooling garnet
is enriched in Fe/(Fe+Mg), whereas biotite inclusions become poorer. When temperature drops

below closure temperature, diffusion becomes negligible. The diffusive process is limited by the
rate of diffusion in garnet, because DFe/MgBiotite &gt;&gt; DFe/MgGarnet and mass balance determines that
the rate of cation transfer between garnet and biotite must be the same. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg)
variations will be a function of biotite inclusion size and Fe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite
inclusions can be transformed in their respective apparent closure temperatures, providing
cooling rate patterns. This work explores the assumptions that allow petrological cooling rates to
be applied to natural systems, as well as the potential pitfalls regarding this methodology,
namely the difficulty in assuring that open-system behaviour did not take place in complex
orogenic belts, such as the Ribeira Belt. It also provides a new interpretation for complex cooling
patterns and a possible solution to this problem.

2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS
The studied São Fidelis – Santo António de Pádua (SFSAP) sector is located in the central-

north Ribeira Belt (RB), SE Brazil. The RB is a 1500 km long NE-SW to NNE-SSW trending
Neoproterozoic belt formed during the Braziliano Orogeny as outcome of the collision between
the São Francisco and West Congo cratons, from which resulted Western Gondwana (Cordani et
al., 1973). RB is a complex orogenic belt composed of several geological units, separated by
deep dextral shears. The SFSAP sector is located SE to one of these mega-shears, the Além
Paraíba – Santo António de Pádua shear (APPS) that vigorously deformed the area rocks
imposing a NE-SW trending transpressive shear deformation associated with HT/LP
metamorphism (Bento dos Santos et al., 2007; 2008). Intense granulite facies metamorphism
produced generalized migmatization by partial melting of paragneisses. Outcrops in the area
comprise: a) migmatites; b) massive charnockites (granulites); and c) blastomylonites that
resulted from shearing and retrogression of the other rock types.

3. PETROLOGICAL COOLING RATES RESULTS
The Spear &amp;amp; Parrish (1996) method is based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling between a garnet

megablast and corresponding biotite inclusions. Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a function of
biotite inclusions size if diffusion is exclusive between garnet and the several biotites included.
This will produce larger compositional variations in smaller biotite inclusions. Therefore,
Fe/(Fe+Mg) in each inclusion can be transformed in its respective apparent closure temperature
using the garnet’s core composition, the diffusion coefficients of Chakraborty &amp;amp; Gangully
(1992) and the Ferry &amp;amp; Spear (1978) thermometer.

Fig. 1 shows two contrasting correlations between biotite inclusions size and Fe/Mg (i.e.
apparent closure temperature): some samples show high Fe/Mg variation and significant
temperature dispersion (Fig. 1a-b) with cooling rates spanning from 0.1 to 200ºC/Ma, whereas
others show very narrow Fe/Mg variation that provide flat closure temperature patterns (Fig. 1c-
d) with cooling rates spanning from 1 to 200ºC/Ma. The latter, although providing correlation
trends between Fe/Mg results and biotite inclusions size, have a maximum Fe/Mg range &amp;lt;0.2.
This is problematic, since small amplitudes in Fe/Mg of biotite inclusions provide a very narrow
closure temperature range (&amp;lt;50ºC). This implies that Fe-Mg diffusion between garnet and
respective biotite inclusions was insufficient to display cooling rate patterns.

However, using the garnets and biotites that show sufficient Fe/Mg variation (e.g.: Fig. 1a-b),
and, consequently, high dispersion of closure temperatures, it is possible to observe that there is
a significant difference between migmatites and granulites regarding cooling rate patterns (Fig.
2). This is emphasized after using software that removes result dispersion (Fig. 2b).

Definitive cooling rates results for charnockites and migmatites are presented in Fig. 2b.
Migmatites show high cooling rates at high T (6ºC/Ma) and low cooling rates at low T
(0.1ºC/Ma), displaying a decrease in cooling rates with time, whereas charnockites underwent
low cooling rates at high T (2ºC/Ma) and high cooling rates at low T (120ºC/Ma).

1 (Fig. 1a-b) show high closure temperature dispersion, whereas samples 341a and 222-2 (Fig. 1c-d)
show flat apparent closure temperature patterns due to very narrow Fe/Mg variation.

garnets and biotites that show large closure T variation (a). Fig. 2b shows the effect of applying software
that removes dispersion from the results, revealing the cooling trends for charnockites and migmatites.

4. DISCUSSION
The results obtained with the Spear &amp;amp; Parrish (1996) method are difficult to interpret both for

granulites and migmatites, because biotite dimension (logarithmic) vs. garnet – biotite apparent
closure temperatures show a very low range of apparent closure temperatures for biotites that are
very different in terms of size. This suggests that garnet and respective biotite inclusions must
have been reequilibrated (re-homogenized) at high temperatures and then cooled very fast,
inhibiting significant change in the Fe/Mg of biotite inclusions, and consequently, in the apparent
closure temperatures. In other cases, a high dispersion of closure temperatures is observable.
This implies that cationic exchange with mass balance preservation between garnet and biotite
inclusions (i.e. close system behaviour) was not exclusive. Intense deformation caused by long-
term sub-horizontal transpressive shearing in central RB (Fonseca et al., 2008; Bento dos Santos
et al., 2009) can be seen in sheared migmatites and granulites (as previously described). This is
the probable cause for the open-system behaviour found in some samples. It may have altered
biotite diffusion mechanisms and reequilibrated garnet with minerals or fluids outside the garnet

– biotite inclusion system, adding complexities and increasing the uncertainties regarding the use
of this methodology.

The use of garnets and biotites that present large Fe/Mg variation (high dispersion of closure
temperatures) and software that removes the dispersion of the results (Fig. 2), show that
migmatites cooled faster than charnockites at high temperatures, being removed from high T
sooner. Later, charnockites were cooled much faster (120ºC/Ma) during the last stages of
retrogression.

Bento dos Santos et al. (2008) provided thermochronological constraints for the SFSAP sector
based on integration of multiple isotopic systems. They concluded that migmatites were cooled
at relatively stable 3 – 5ºC/Ma, whereas granulites were maintained at lower crustal levels with a
very slow cooling rate (&amp;lt;2ºC/Ma) during long-term sub-horizontal transpressive shearing
(Fonseca et al., 2008). This period of slow-cooling endured until orogenic collapse occurred,
leading to abrupt fast cooling of charnockites (8 to 30ºC/Ma) in the last stages of Brasiliano
Orogeny. The obtained petrological cooling rates are difficult to interpret, but provide qualitative
and quantitative results in agreement with Bento dos Santos et al. (2008) conclusions, such as the
idea of high temperature maintenance that reequilibrated the garnets, followed by very fast
cooling that did not allow significant Fe/Mg diffusion between garnet and biotite inclusions.

Therefore, although with some important difficulties, garnet – biotite diffusion mechanisms
can be used to obtain reliable petrological cooling rates.
