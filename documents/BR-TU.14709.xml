Porous 316L austenitic stainless steel was synthesized by powder metallurgy with relative density of 0.50 and 
0.30 using 15 and 30 wt. (%) respectively of ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate as foaming agents. 
The powders were mixed in a planetary ball mill at 60 rpm for 10 minutes. The samples were uniaxially pressed 
at 287 MPa and subsequently vacuum heat treated in two stages, the first one at 200 °C for 5 hours to decompose 
the carbonate and the second one at 1150 °C for 2 hours to sinter the steel. The sintered samples had a close 
porous structure and a multimodal pore size distribution that varied with the foaming agent and its concentration. 
The samples obtained by addition of 30 wt. (%) of foaming agents had a more homogeneous porous structure 
than that obtained with 15 wt. (%). The MTT cytotoxicity test (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide) was used to evaluate the mitochondrial activity of L929 cells with samples for periods of 24, 48, and 
72 hours. The cytotoxicity test showed that the steel foams were not toxic to fibroblast culture. The sample with 
the best cellular growth, therefore the most suitable for biomedical applications among those studied in this 
work, was produced with 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. In this sample, cell development was observed after 
48 hours of incubation, and there was adhesion and spreading on the material after 72 hours. Electrochemical 
experiments using a chloride-containing medium were performed on steel foams and compared to massive steel. 
The massive steel had a better corrosion performance than the foams as the porosity contributes to increase the 
surface area exposed to the corrosive medium. 

Keywords: stainless steel, cellular solids, powder metallurgy, cytotoxicity

1. Introduction

Austenitic stainless steels are frequently used in biomedical 
applications, such as orthopedic implants, due to properties like high 
corrosion and fatigue resistance as well as high fracture toughness. 
In addition to biocompatibility, these properties are important in the 
selection and adaptation of a material for biomedical applications. 
However, the major problem concerning orthopedic metallic implants 
is the mismatch of Young’s modulus between bone and bulk metallic 
material. Due to this mechanical mismatch, bone is insufficiently 
loaded and becomes stress shielded, which eventually leads to bone 
reabsorption. If the bone loss is excessive, it can compromise the 
long-term performance of the prosthesis1-3.

Metal foams with extremely low density and good combination 
of properties have excellent potential for implant application because 
of the reduced stiffness mismatches4. Additionally, bone ingrowth is 
possible, which could greatly improve the bone-implant interface 
and may allow for efficient soft tissue attachment supplementing 
the stability of the implant by biological fixation5,6. The greatest 
application fields are in the osseous reconstructive surgery, such as 
treatment of small bone defects, cranio-maxillofacial reconstruction, 
tooth root replacements and vertebral body replacement6.

Open-cell and closed-cell are the major classification of porous 
metals, or metal foams. In closed-cell foams, each cell is completely 
enclosed by a thin wall or membrane of metal, whilst in open-cell 
foams the individual cells are interconnected, allowing tissue to 
infiltrate the foam and anchor it into position. Although open-cell 
metals are preferred for use in implants because they facilitate 

bone ingrowth, metals with a closed-cell structure may be used in 
orthopedic load bearing implants1. 

The selection of materials for medical applications is also based 
on considerations of in vivo performance. The orthopedic prostheses 
are commonly used for extended time and are subject to a highly 
aggressive medium that constitutes the human body, fluids rich in 
sodium chloride. Therefore, when metals and alloys are considered, 
the susceptibility of the material to corrosion and its local and 
systemic effects should be considered. The corrosion product can 
cause changes in the histology of local tissue either by toxic effects 
as by local hypersensitive. This biological response may cause loss 
of part of implant and surgical revisions1. Corrosion resistance of the 
currently used 316L stainless steel relies on their passivation by a thin 
surface layer of oxide. However, studies1,7 have demonstrated that 
porous 316L exhibited poor corrosion resistance due to potentially 
higher corrosion rates that can occur in vivo with the irregular and 
porous surface geometry. Seah et al.8 showed that corrosion resistance 
decreased with decreasing porosity, which was attributed to the small, 
isolated pore morphology that traps ionic species and restricts the 
access of oxygen, which in turn limits the available oxygen for the 
formation of the corrosion resistant passive layers. In highly porous 
compacts with an open, interconnected pore morphology, the free flow 
of species resulted in a material with increased corrosion resistance.

Different processes have been used in the fabrication of porous 
metals1,9. Casting or vapor deposition techniques tend to allow 
greater control over pore size, distribution, and interconnectivity,

which produce open-cell geometries. Other processes involving 
decomposition of foaming agents in either molten or powder metal 
matrices10,11 give lower porosity and less predictable pore distribution 
and interconnectivity. In the ‘Fraunhofer’ process12, which has been 
successfully used to make closed-cell aluminum foams, the metal 
powder is blended with a granular foaming agent and compacted by 
conventional means, yielding a fully dense semi finished product. 
The compact is expanded to foam by heating it to the melting 
point, T

m
, whereupon gas is evolved from the decomposition of the 

foaming agent. In this method, the foaming agent must undergo 
thermal decomposition near T

m
 and generate gas pressure in the 

metal matrix sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and cause 
foaming. Foam expansion results in closed-cell foam with a relative 
density of 0.2-0.8, depending on the particular process parameters 
employed12,13. The syntheses of steel foams by this route are difficult 
because of the high melting point and the low melt viscosity of steel. 
A similar process was used to produce a porous structure in TiZr2 
and Ti-Sn-Nb alloys14. Particles of ammonium hydrogen carbonate 
were used as the space-holding material. This carbonate decomposes 
at low temperature, then the metal foams were obtained in the solid 
state during a two-stage heat treatment to burnout the space-holding 
particles (~200 °C) and to sinter the steel (1200-1300 °C).

The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of 
synthesizing porous 316L stainless steel samples by powder 
metallurgy route using ammonium carbonate and ammonium 
bicarbonate as foaming agents and a two-stage heat treatment to 
sinter the steel. The effect of foaming agent and its concentration on 
the development of the pore structure and corrosion properties were 
evaluated. The MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide) colorimetric assay was used to measure cytotoxicity and 
cell proliferation and to assess the suitability of the material for 
biomedical applications.

2. Materials and Methods

The composition of commercial 316L stainless steel powder 
specified by the AMS 5507D is presented in Table 1, while Table 2 
presents the granulometric analysis of steel powder certified by the 
supplier. The steel powder was mixed with the foaming agents: 
ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate, in a planetary 
ball mill at 60 rpm for 10 minutes with a ball to powder weight ratio 
of 28:1. Mixtures were produced with 15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium 
carbonate and bicarbonate with the aim of producing porous samples 
with relative density of 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. The samples were 
uniaxially pressed at 287 MPa and then vacuum heat treated (10–2 bar) 
in two stages, the first one at 200 °C for 5 hours to decompose the 
carbonate and the second one at 1150 °C for 2 hours to sinter the steel. 
Twenty samples were produced for each condition with 10 mm in 
diameter for the citotoxicity assays. The samples for electrochemical 
experiments were 20 cm in diameter. Samples of pure 316L stainless 
steel (no porous material) were also produced and sintered at 1150 °C 
for 2 hours in high vacuum (10–6 bar) in order to minimize the 
oxidation and compare the effect of the pores in the cytotoxicity test. 

The apparent density and relative density was determined for all 
samples (twenty for each condition) in the green and sintered states. 
The apparent density was measured using the mass and dimensions 
of samples (?

g
) and the relative density (?

r
) was calculated as the 

ratio of the apparent density and theoretical density calculated for 
each mixture. Helium pycnometry was used to determine the true 
density (?

t
) of the samples. The open porosity (P

o
) was estimated 

from the relation between the true density and the geometrical 
density, according to the expression: P

o
 = (1 – (?

g
 /?

t
)). The pore size 

distribution was analyzed by mercury porosimetry over a pressure 

range of 0 to 50 psi. The samples were submitted to a heat treatment 
at 120 °C for 2 hours to clean and eliminate moisture before the pore 
size distribution analyses. Morphological characterization was carried 
out by optical and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM).

The cytotoxicity assay was evaluated according to ISO 10993-5 
“Biological evaluation of medical devices - Test for cytotoxicity: 
in vitro methods” (or EN 30993-5), using direct contact. The 
proliferate activity of cultured cells was determined with the 
MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) 
colorimetric assay, as described by Mosmann15. Latex fragments 
were used as the positive control and fragments of proven non-toxic 
paper filter were used as the negative control. The dimensions of 
these fragments were the same of the samples. All the samples were 
sterilized for 24 hours under UV irradiation and placed in individual 
wells of 24-well culture plates. L929 cells were inoculated in each 
well at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells.mL–1, supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (Gibco, BRL). The incubation was performed 
under a CO

2
 (5%) atmosphere at 37 °C for different times. The 

viability of cells was determined after 24, 48 and 72 hours. After the 
incubation time, the samples and the positive and negative control 
fragments were removed from the respective wells. Only the cells 
that adhered to the well walls were incubated with a tetrazolium salt 
solution (MTT), (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 hours at 37 °C. The MTT 
was reduced to an insoluble formazan precipitate by mitochondrial 
succinic dehydrogenase of the viable cells. After removal of the 
medium, ethanol-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) solution 
(1:1) was added to each well. After complete solubilization of the 
dark blue crystal of MTT formazan, the absorbance of the content of 
wells was measured at 570 nm with a 24-well microplate reader on a 
spectrophotometer Spectra Count (Packard). The blank reference was 
taken from wells without cells, which were also incubated with the 
MTT solution. The cell viability was calculated by the normalization 
of optical densities (OD) using the following expression:

 (1)

The cellular adhesion capacity of the L929 cells on the samples 
was tested at incubation periods of 48 and 72 hours. After the culture, 
the cells attached on the samples were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde 
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 hour and dehydrated in a 
graded ethanol solution series (30, 50, 70, 95, 100%) for 10 minutes 
each. The drying stage used a solution of ethanol (50%) with

hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and HMDS (100%) for 10 minutes  
respectively. SEM characterization was done on dried samples. 

Electrochemical study was carried out on massive steel and 
steel foams produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate and 
bicarbonate with a Potentiostat/Galvanostat model MQPG-01 
Microquimica. The electrochemical experiments were performed 
at 25 °C in a one-compartment cell containing three electrodes. The 
working electrodes were the 316L steel foams and the massive one 
inlaid on Teflon®, with a 0.79 cm2 disc shaped exposed area. The 
reference electrode was a saturated Ag / AgCl, Cl– electrode and the 
auxiliary electrode was a platinum rod.

The electrochemical experiments were investigated by 
potentiodynamic polarization curves in a 0.1 mol.L–1 NaCl solution 
(pH = 5.9), which was not stirred, open to the atmosphere at 25 °C. 
The experiments were carried out by varying the potential of electrode 
at 10 mV/s, from –700 up to +500 mV and –500 up to +1500 mV, 
reversing the potential down to –700 mV. The electrochemical 
parameters were obtained from the Tafel plots.

3. Results and Discussion

Apparent density (?
g
) and relative density (?

r
) at green and 

sintered states, as well as the picnometry density of 316L steel foams 
and the calculated open porosity are show in Table 3. The average 
densities of green samples are very close to the theoretical values 
of the mixtures, so almost full density samples were obtained. The 
samples synthesized with ammonium carbonate presented relative 
densities slightly higher than that produced with the ammonium 
bicarbonate. However, no significant differences are observed if 
the deviations of the average density values are taken into account. 
After sintering, steel foams with relative densities of 0.3 and 0.5 were 
successfully obtained using both foaming agents. Helium picnometry 
densities are lower than that of theoretical density of 316L stainless 
steel (8 g.cm–3), showing that about 10 to 20% of the pores in the 
steel foams are closed. The steel foam produced with 15 wt. (%) 
ammonium carbonate presented the higher fraction of closed pores.

Figure 1 and 2 present, respectively, a comparative set of 
optical and SEM micrographs of steel foams synthesized with 
15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate and bicarbonate. The pore 
distribution obtained is very heterogeneous and composed by irregular 
and isolated pores. Large and/or coalesced pores on the edge surface 
of samples can be observed in Figure 1e, while smaller and isolated 
pores can be seen in the middle of the samples, Figures 1a-d. This 
fact occurs probably due to more facility of flow of gas on the surface 
of the samples. Steel foams produced with 30 wt. (%) foaming 

agents show larger pores, which are more homogeneous in size and 
distribution (Figures 1c, 1d, 2c and 2d) than those produced with 
15 wt. (%) foaming agents, where larger pores are surrounded by 
small ones (Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b).

Figure 3 shows the pore size distribution obtained by mercury 
porosimetry. The lowest mercury volume intruded was obtained for 
the massive steel, according with the largest relative density obtained 
among the sintered samples. Among the steel foams, those produced 
with 15 wt. (%) foaming agents had the largest mercury volumes 
intruded, indicating, apparently, higher volume fraction of pores in 
samples with higher relative densities. This result could be explained 
by the minimum pore size that can be analyzed by the Hg porosimeter 
used in this work, which is 1000 µm. As showed by optical and SEM 
micrographs, steel foams obtained with 30 wt. (%) foaming agents 
present larger pores than those of the steel foams produced with 
15 wt. (%). The external regions of the samples are formed by the 
coalescence of pores as show in Figure 1e. These regions and the 
larger pores in the steel foams produced with 30 wt. (%) foaming 
agents might have been full filled with Hg before pressure was applied, 
which resulted in a lower intruded volume during analysis. Figure 3 
shows also that samples produced with 15 wt. (%) of foaming agents 
have a large fraction of pores with size smaller than 6 µm, which is 
consistent with the micrographs of Figure 1 where a large amount 
of small pores can be seen around larger ones. 

The distribution of open pores less than 1000 µm illustrated in 
Figure 3 shows that steel foam obtained with 15 wt. (%) ammonium 
carbonate has a trimodal pore size distribution with a close distribution 
of pores with mean diameter at 5 µm and other two wide distribution 
at 20 and 300 µm. The foam obtained with 15 wt. (%) ammonium 
bicarbonate shows a very similar distribution. Steel foam produced 
with 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate also presented a trimodal pores 
size distribution, one very close with mean diameter at 10 µm and 
other two at 50 and 450 µm. The sample produced with 30 wt. (%) 
bicarbonate presented only a broad distribution with a mean diameter 
of 70 µm.

Although optimum pore size required for implant fixation remains 
undefined, the consensus is that in order to optimize mineralized bone 
ingrowth, pore sizes between 100 and 400 µm are necessary1,16-19. 
However, effective bone ingrowths into porous coatings with pore 
sizes down to 50 µm have been related1. Conversely, when the pore 
size is increased beyond 1 mm there seems to be an increasing 
tendency for the formation of fibrous tissue. Based on porous sizes 
distribution the samples produced with 15 wt. (%) foaming agents 
and 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate seem to be appropriate for 
applications as biomaterials. However, the morphological analysis by

microscopy and the open porosity calculations seem to indicate that 
the 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate would be more appropriate for 
cell ingrowth since it presents a larger amount of regular open pores.

recovered for all porous samples, but the recuperation was much more 
pronounced for the samples produced with 30 wt. (%) foaming agents. 
For the period of 72 hours, it was observed a normalization of the cell 
viability to the levels found in the controls in the samples produced 
with ammonium carbonate (15 and 30 wt. (%)). Considering the 
samples produced with ammonium bicarbonate, that with 15 wt. (%) 
showed low cell viability after 72 hours, the lowest among all the 
porous samples, while the 30 wt. (%) sample showed a significant 
increase in cell viability when compared with the control groups. 

Figure 5 shows micrographs obtained by SEM of the 316L 
stainless steel after incubation with the cells for 48 and 72 hours. 

After 48 hours the cells were homogeneously distributed over the 
sample already showing filament branching. After 72 hours, the 
whole sample is completely covered by cells. Arrows on Figure 5a 
show examples of cells and of the beginning of filaments formation.

Figures 6 and 7 present micrographs by SEM of the 
proliferation of cells on porous samples produced, respectively, with 
15 and 30 wt. (%) foaming agents. Variations observed in the cells 
interaction with samples were related to the porosity and foaming 
agent. The porous samples produced with ammonium bicarbonate, 
independent of the porosity, did not favor the cell proliferation and 
adhesion. Figures 6a and 7a obtained after 48 hours of incubation

show that only some cells were adhered on the samples. These cells 
have a flat morphology and present some filaments. Figure 6c shows 
the spreading of some cells after 72 hours on sample produced 
with 15 wt. (%) ammonium bicarbonate, while Figure 7c show 
only isolated cells (arrows) on samples produced with 30 wt. (%) 
ammonium bicarbonate. This late condition proved to be the worst 
for cellular development, which may be related to the pore size 
distribution, a monomodal distribution with a mean diameter of 
70 µm.

The use of ammonium carbonate in the production of porous 
samples seems to promote the adhesion and proliferation of cells. 
Figure 6b show SEM micrographs where cells showing a flat 
morphology and cytoplasmic webbing (micrograph of higher 
magnification attached to Figure 6b) are well distributed on the 
sample produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. After 
72 hours, a large amount of cells is observed, Figure 6d, with a 
spherical morphology and cytoplasmic prolongations connecting the 
cells. The adhesion and proliferation of cells had also occurred on 
samples produced with 30 wt. (%) of ammonium carbonate. In this 
case, already after 48 hours the cells show a spherical morphology, 
Figure 7b. The presence of cells with spherical morphology on these 
samples shows that there was cellular division and the sequence 
of cellular development agrees with the model proposed by 
Rajaraman et al.20. The model proposes that the major events in the 
process of adhesion and spreading seem to be attachment of the cell 
to the substratum, radial growth of filopodia, cytoplasmic webbing 
and the resultant flattening of the cell. During mitosis a reversal of 
these events occurs by cytoplasmic de-webbing, the cell becomes 
spherical while anchored to the substratum by long filopodia and 

after mitosis, the two daughter cells become flat again by cytoplasmic 
webbing. It should be emphasized that these different stages are not 
discretely separable but are different phases of a contiguous process. 
The duration of these phases and the degree of overlapping of these 
events may vary between different cell lines and different substrates20. 

In this work, the cell growth was more apparent in samples 
with 15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate, which presented two 
wide pore size distributions at 20 and 300 µm, and 50 and 450 µm, 
respectively. This result is in accordance with optimum pore size 
required for implant fixation, between 100 and 400 µm, described in 
literature1,16-19. These samples presented cells covering the material 
and cellular division. It is important to emphasize that the cells were 
initially in suspension and after 24 hours were already interacting 
with the material. The cells that were not on the surface of the 
sample had normal proliferation, which was verified in the graphs 
of cytotoxicity. The interaction of the cells with the material surface 
is considered very important to the effectiveness of medical implants 
and can determine the degree of rejection. The chemistry of materials 
surface can determine the cellular response to the material and affect 
the cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, and function21-24.

The results of cytotoxicity and SEM showed that the foaming 
agent and pore size influenced the interactions between cells and 
substrate. The fibroblasts in contact with the samples, had adhesion, 
proliferation, migration, and cellular viability for the culture intervals 
studied, but less than in the controls. The material did not release any 
toxic substances to disturb cellular growth.

15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate (C)) in contact with 0.1 mol.L–1 
NaCl aqueous solution, pH 5.9 are shown in Figure 8. The values of 
potential observed for the sets of measurements are in agreement with 
the literature25. The values vary between 0.18 and 0.27 V. Table 4 shows 
the electrochemical parameters from the potentiodynamic polarization 
curves. Comparing the electrochemical parameters, the anodic current 
density (j

corr
) is lower when the surface is the massive steel (A). The 

steel foams produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium bicarbonate (B) and 
15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate (C) presented similar values of 
anodic current densities, but these values are four times higher than the 
massive steel value (A). The massive steel presented better corrosion 
performance in a chloride-containing medium.

Figure 9 shows the results of an anodic polarization test for the 
316L massive steel (A), 316L steel foam with 15 wt. (%) ammonium 
bicarbonate (B) and 316L steel foam with 15 wt. (%) ammonium 
carbonate (C). The samples was maintained for 24 hours at an open 
circuit potential, and then polarized anodically at a scanning rate of 
10 mV/s. An Ag/AgCl, Cl– was used as a reference electrode, platinum 
rod as a counter electrode and 0.79 cm2 disc shaped exposed area 
as working electrode. The three types of steels showed a current 
density of between –0.50 and 0.25 mA.cm–2. Comparing the results of 
Figure 8 and 9 one can observe differences which can be attributed to 
a passivation effect of the steel surface26. The change in the corrosion 
potential value can be justified by the attack of the species, which 
cross the pores of the steel foams, forms a layer of passivated material 
stopping the progress of the corrosion.

4. Conclusions

Steel foams with relative densities of 0.3 and 0.5 were 
successfully obtained by powder metallurgy using the two foaming 
agents: ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate. 

Very heterogeneous pore structures, composed by irregular and 
isolated pores, were obtained. Large and/or coalesced pores were 
observed on the surface; while smaller and isolated pores could 
be seen in the middle of the samples. Steel foams produced with 
30 wt. (%) foaming agents showed larger pores, more homogeneous 
in size and distribution than that with 15 wt. (%) samples. 

The steel foams were not toxic to fibroblasts culture. The 
samples that presented better cell viability were produced with 
30 wt. (%) foaming agents. Adhesion and cell growth was higher in 
the 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. Cell development was observed 
after 48 hours of incubation and after 72 hours, there was adhesion 
and spreading on the material. This sample presented the best pore 
size distribution to improve cell growth, a trimodal distribution, with 
mean diameters of 10, 50, and 450 µm.

Massive steel had better corrosion performance in a chloride- 
containing medium than the steel foams, because porosity contributed 
to increased display area in the corrosive medium.

Although new experiments, such as mechanical and in vivo tests, 
are necessary, the results show that the steels foams produced in this 
work can be viable in orthopedic implants.
