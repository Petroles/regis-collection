RESUMO 
Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar o desempenho in vitro do plasma rico em plaquetas (PRP) com 

scaffolds de ácido hialurônico (AH) ou quitosana (CHT) como um scaffold compósito para a proliferação e 

diferenciação osteogênica de células tronco mesenquimais derivadas de tecido adiposo humano (h-

AdMSCs). O PRP é um produto autólogo obtido do sangue total (WB). O ácido hialurônico é um 

glicosaminoglicano e principal componente do fluido sinovial. A quitosana é um polissacarídeo natural 

encontrado principalmente na carapaça de crustáceos. O PRP puro (P-PRP, rico em plaquetas e pobre 

em leucócitos) foi obtido a partir da centrifugação controlada do WB, e ativado com os agonistas soro 

autólogo e cálcio. Os scaffolds foram estruturados em micropartículas ou esponjas, para atender os 

requisitos de formulações injetáveis ou sólidas, respectivamente. Nesse contexto, os seguintes scaffolds 

foram preparados e caracterizados: sólidos porosos (esponjas) de quitosana não estabilizados (PCHTs) e 

estabilizados (SPCHTs); micropartículas de quitosana-tripolifosfato de sódio (iCHT-TPPs); 

micropartículas e esponjas de ácido hialurônico autorreticulado (ACPs) e de ácido hialurônico reticulado 

com 1,4-butanodiol diglicidil éter (HA-BDDE); e esponjas e micropartículas de ACP e CHT (PECs). 

PCHTs foram preparados por congelamento e liofilização de soluções de CHT, variando a concentração 

e as condições de congelamento. As estabilizações foram realizadas pelo tratamento dos PCHTs com 

hidróxido de sódio, série de etanol ou reticulação com tripolifosfato. Os iCHT-TPPs foram preparados por 

reticulação iônica de quitosana com TPP em diferentes razões mássicas. ACPs foram obtidos por 

autoesterificação organocatalisada. HA-BDDE foi preparado por eterificação dos grupos hidroxílicos do 

HA com o epóxido BDDE. PECs foram preparados por reticulação iônica do ACP com a CHT. Para a 

preparação de scaffolds compósitos, P-PRP ativado contendo h-AdMSCs foi imediatamente pipetado 

sobre a superfície dos scaffolds. Os resultados mostraram que os scaffolds não apresentam 

citotoxicidade. Micrografias obtidas por microscopia eletrônica de varredura mostraram compatibilidade 

estrutural com as redes de fibrina formadas no interior dos poros ou na superfície de scaffolds 

compósitos. Os scaffolds compósitos estimularam o crescimento de h-AdMSCs e a diferenciação 

osteogênica. Os scaffolds compósitos também promoveram liberação gradual dos fatores de crescimento 

PDGF-AB e TGF-?1. Assim, concluímos que os scaffolds compósitos estudados neste trabalho são 

promissores para engenharia de tecidos, particularmente para a cicatrização e regeneração óssea, no 

âmbito da medicina regenerativa.

ABSTRACT 
This work aimed to study the in vitro performance of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with scaffolds of 

hyaluronic acid (HA) and/ or chitosan (CHT) as a composite scaffold for proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs). The PRP is an autologous 

product obtained from whole blood (WB). Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan and the main 

component of the synovial fluid. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide found mainly in the carapace of 

crustaceans. The pure PRP (P-PRP, rich in platelet and poor in leukocytes) was obtained from controlled 

centrifugation of WB, and activated with the agonists autologous serum and calcium. The scaffolds were 

structured in microparticles or sponges, to comply the requirements of injectable or solid formulations, 

respectively. In this context, the following scaffolds were prepared and characterized: chitosan porous 

solid (sponge) unstabilized (PCHTs) and stabilized (SPCHTs); chitosan-sodium tripolyphosphate 

microparticles (iCHT-TPPs); microparticles and sponges of auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (ACPs) and 

of hyaluronic acid crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (HA-BDDE); and microparticles and 

sponges of ACP and CHT (PECs). PCHTs were prepared by freezing and lyophilization of CHT solutions, 

varying the concentration and freezing conditions. Stabilization was performed by treating the PCHTs with 

sodium hydroxide, an ethanol series or by crosslinking with tripolyphosphate. The iCHT-TPPs were 

prepared by ionic crosslinking of chitosan with TPP at different mass ratios. ACPs was prepared by 

organocatalyzed auto-esterification. HA-BDDE was prepared by etherification of the hydroxyl groups of 

HA with the epoxide BDDE. PECs were prepared by ionic crosslinking of ACP with CHT. For the 

preparation of composite scaffolds, activated P-PRP containing h-AdMSCs was immediately pipetted onto 

the surface of the scaffolds. The results showed that the scaffolds do not exhibit cytotoxicity. Micrographs 

obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed structural compatibility with fibrin networks 

formed inside the pores or on the surface of scaffolds. The composite scaffolds stimulated the growth of h-

AdMSCs and osteogenic differentiation. Composite scaffolds also promoted gradual release of growth 

factors PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 and osteogenic differentiation. Thus, we conclude that the composite 

scaffolds studied in this work are promising for tissue engineering, particularly for healing and bone 

regeneration in regenerative medicine.

1.2. Relevância do Trabalho 

 

O aumento da expectativa de vida, o mau funcionamento e/ ou a perda de 

tecidos causados por lesões ou por doenças, têm levado à redução da qualidade de 

vida de muitos pacientes e a um aumento do custo socioeconômico. Mesmo com o 

progresso da engenharia de tecidos e da medicina regenerativa, as terapias atuais 

ainda apresentam inúmeras limitações.  

Assim, o desenvolvimento de matrizes tridimensionais (scaffolds) combinadas 

com diferentes tipos de células e moléculas bioativas com atividades específicas tem se 

tornado uma alternativa atrativa aos tratamentos atuais. 

A obtenção de scaffolds biodegradáveis onde células específicas possam 

crescer e se multiplicar em uma estrutura similar aos tecidos é a base da engenharia de 

tecidos, que constitui um ramo da medicina regenerativa.  

O principal objetivo de um scaffold é mimetizar a matriz extracelular nativa do 

tecido desejado, permitindo adesão, migração, proliferação, diferenciação e 

manutenção do fenótipo celular. Além disso, um scaffold deve ainda promover a 

vascularização e a migração de nutrientes, e possuir taxa de degradação e 

propriedades mecânicas adequadas para suportar a formação do novo tecido (Langer &amp;amp; 

Vacanti, 1993; Hutmacher, 2000; Lin et al., 2009). 

Várias matrizes têm sido empregadas para a proliferação e multiplicação de 

diferentes células progenitoras, incluindo as células-tronco mesenquimais. Entretanto, a 



3 

 

maioria destas matrizes não fornece o ambiente biológico adequado para que as 

células possam proliferar e se multiplicar de forma semelhante aos sistemas in vivo. O 

desenvolvimento de um scaffold para cultivo celular que seja mecanicamente estável, 

biocompatível e biodegradável e que possa atender a especificidade das células que 

compõem os diferentes tecidos representa ainda um grande desafio para a engenharia 

de tecidos (George et al., 2008).  

Os polímeros naturais são os materiais mais atraentes para a preparação de 

scaffolds, principalmente devido às suas semelhanças com a matriz extracelular, 

versatilidade química, bom desempenho biológico, e interações celulares específicas 

(Costa-Pinto et al., 2011). 

O plasma rico em plaquetas (PRP) é um concentrado de plaquetas autólogas e 

de outros componentes do plasma capaz de liberar fatores de crescimento (FCs) e 

citocinas utilizadas na regeneração de tecidos (Anitua et al., 2012; Foster et al., 2009). 

O PRP tem sido amplamente utilizado com sucesso na prática clínica da medicina 

regenerativa (Crane &amp;amp; Everts, 2008; Cole et al., 2010). 

Quando ativado com soro autólogo (ser) e CaCl2, o PRP produz a rede de fibrina 

com estrutura semelhante a um gel que suporta a proliferação e diferenciação celular, 

sendo assim um scaffold natural (Marx, 2004).  

O PRP pode ser aplicado em feridas, na forma sólida ou injetável, ou pode ser 

utilizado como um suplemento em cirurgias, para promover hemostasia e acelerar a 

cicatrização através da liberação dos FCs e citocinas (Singh et al., 2014).  

Embora o PRP seja um scaffold natural eficaz, a liberação da maior parte dos 

FCs ocorre dentro da primeira hora após a ativação plaquetária. Além disso, a rede de 

fibrina não apresenta estabilidade mecânica adequada para suportar a formação do 

novo tecido (McCarrel &amp;amp; Fortier, 2009). 

Assim, nossa hipótese é que a associação de PRP com ácido hialurônico (AH) e/ 

ou quitosana (CHT), produza scaffolds compósitos com melhores propriedades físico-

químicas, mecânicas e biológicas, que possam promover a liberação gradual dos FCs e 

estimular a proliferação e a diferenciação celular.  

O AH é um polissacarídeo natural linear composto de repetidas unidades 

dissacarídicas de ácido D-glicurônico (GlcUA) e N-acetilglicosamina (GlcNAc) unidas 

alternadamente por ligações glicosídicas ?-1,3 e ?-1,4 (Ruhela et al., 2006, Meyer &amp;amp; 

Palmer, 1934). 

As funções e aplicações do AH na engenharia de tecidos e medicina 

regenerativa estão associadas basicamente às suas propriedades biológicas 



4 

 

favoráveis, características estruturais, e às possíveis modificações químicas do 

polímero, as quais determinam suas propriedades reológicas, de solubilidade, de 

hidratação e de reconhecimento celular específico.  

Entretanto, a rápida degradação in vivo e as propriedades mecânicas 

inadequadas do AH exigem sua modificação e/ ou estabilização para aplicações na 

medicina em especial na medicina regenerativa. 

Assim, para a preparação de um scaffold compósito de AH com prolongado 

tempo de residência in vivo e melhores propriedades mecânicas em relação ao AH 

nativo, foram utilizados o derivado autorreticulado ACP (auto-crosslinked polymers) 

completamente biocompatível e o derivado reticulado com 1,4-butanodiol diglicidil éter 

(HA-BDDE) que apresenta baixa citotoxicidade em relação a outros agentes reticulante 

disponíveis no mercado. O ACP foi preparado através de reação de autoesterificação 

organocatalisada na qual é formada uma ligação covalente entre os grupos hidroxílicos 

e carboxílicos de uma mesma cadeia e/ ou de cadeias diferentes de AH sem a adição 

de agentes reticulantes tóxicos (Bellini et al., 2001). O HA-BDDE foi preparado por 

reação de eterificação dos grupos hidroxílicos do AH com o epóxido BDDE em meio 

alcalino (Malson &amp;amp; Lindqvist, 1986). 

A quitosana é um polissacarídeo derivado da quitina (copolímeros ?-(1?4)-2-

amino 2-desoxi-D-glicose e ?-(1?4)-2-acetamida 2-desoxi-D-glicose) encontrada nas 

carapaças de crustáceos marinhos e paredes celulares de alguns fungos (Muzzarelli, 

1973; Berger et al., 2004). 

Propriedades como biodegradabilidade, biocompatibilidade, adesividade, 

capacidade de moldagem em diferentes formas e versatilidade de modificação química 

fazem com que a quitosana seja um biomaterial promissor para diversas aplicações na 

engenharia de tecidos e medicina regenerativa (Adekogbe &amp;amp; Ghanem, 2005; Agnihotri 

et al., 2004). 

A liofilização é a técnica mais empregada para a preparação de scaffolds de 

quitosana. Neste processo, as condições de congelamento induzem a separação de 

fase entre o sal de acetato de quitosana e a fase de cristal de gelo. A remoção de gelo 

por sublimação gera um material poroso, cujo tamanho e orientação dos poros podem 

ser controlados pela variação da temperatura e da taxa de congelamento. Na maioria 

dos casos, estes scaffolds podem conter acetato de quitosana que pode levar ao 

intumescimento e dissolução do scaffold em meio aquoso neutro. Neste caso também é 

necessária modificação ou estabilização, realizadas normalmente por reidratação ou 

reticulação (Shen et al., 2000) com hidróxido de sódio (Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew, 1999; 



5 

 

Manjubala et al., 2006), tripolifosfato de sódio (TPP) (Seol et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2000) 

e/ou série de etanol (Nwe et al., 2009, Reis et al., 2008). 

Embora existam inúmeros trabalhos na literatura utilizando scaffolds de AH e 

CHT, combinados ou não, para a regeneração de diferentes tecidos, estudos avaliando 

a performance in vitro destes scaffolds combinados ao PRP ainda são escassos.  

Além disso, os poucos trabalhos existentes na literatura enfatizam as aplicações 

in vitro ou in vivo desses scaffolds, ou simplesmente apresentam as suas aplicações 

clínicas ou a cinética de liberação dos FCs do PRP, sem no entanto, estudar a relação 

estrutura – função ou a combinação dos vértices do triângulo de proliferação celular: 

scaffolds, células e moléculas bioativas (Crane &amp;amp; Everts, 2008).  

Sendo assim, este trabalho se diferencia dos demais da literatura, pois além da 

extensa caracterização físico-química e mecânica dos scaffolds, ele correlaciona essas 

propriedades com as capacidades: condutiva dos scaffolds, indutiva do PRP e gênica 

das células tronco mesenquimais derivadas de tecido adiposo humano (h-AdMSCs) 

baseado no triângulo de proliferação celular. 

Dessa forma, neste trabalho foram preparados e caracterizados scaffolds de AH 

e/ou CHT estruturados em micropartículas ou esponjas, para atender os requisitos de 

formulações injetáveis ou sólidas, respectivamente. Estes scaffolds foram combinados 

com PRP ativado na forma de scaffolds compósitos e avaliados in vitro quanto a 

cinética de liberação de fatores de crescimento (fator de crescimento derivado de 

plaquetas (PDGF-AB) e fator de crescimento transformador ?1 (TGF-?1)), proliferação 

de h-AdMSCs e diferenciação osteogênica através do marcador fosfatase alcalina 

(ALP). 

 

1.3. Objetivo 

 

O presente trabalho teve por objetivo estudar o desempenho in vitro do plasma 

rico em plaquetas ativado (aP-PRP) associado ao ácido hialurônico e/ou quitosana 

como um scaffold compósito para a proliferação e diferenciação osteogênica de células 

tronco mesenquimais derivadas de tecido adiposo humano (h-AdMSCs). 

Para atingir o objetivo mencionado, foram realizadas as seguintes etapas: 

? Preparação e caracterização do PRP; 

? Preparação e caracterização de scaffolds porosos sólidos (esponjas) de 

quitosana não estabilizados (PCHTs), variando a concentração de CHT e as 

condições de congelamento;

compósitos; 

? Avaliação in vitro da performance biológica dos scaffolds compósitos quanto a 

proliferação e diferenciação osteogênica de h-AdMSCs.

CAPÍTULO 2 – REVISÃO BIBLIOGRÁFICA 
 

2.1. Engenharia de Tecidos e Medicina Regenerativa  

 

O termo medicina regenerativa vem sendo utilizado muitas vezes como sinônimo 

de engenharia de tecidos, embora a medicina regenerativa frequentemente implique na 

utilização de células tronco como fonte de células (Berthiaume et al., 2011). 

Segundo Greenwood et al. (2006), “medicina regenerativa é um campo 

interdisciplinar (Figura 1) de pesquisa e aplicações clínicas, focado no reparo, 

substituição ou regeneração de células, tecidos ou órgãos visando restaurar funções 

prejudicadas por defeitos congênitos, doenças, traumas e envelhecimento e que utiliza 

a combinação de várias abordagens tecnológicas que incluem a utilização de moléculas 

solúveis, terapia gênica, terapia com células-tronco e progenitoras, engenharia de 

tecidos e reprogramação de células e de tecidos”.

que aplica os princípios da engenharia e de ciências da vida para o desenvolvimento de 

substitutos biológicos que restauram, mantém ou melhoram a função do tecido ou de 

um conjunto de órgãos” (Langer &amp;amp; Vacanti, 1993). Seu objetivo é superar as limitações 

dos tratamentos convencionais com base em transplantes de órgãos.  

A medicina regenerativa e a engenharia de tecidos têm se tornado campos de 

pesquisa promissores e importantes, uma vez que podem oferecer alternativas viáveis 

e menos invasivas para o reparo e regeneração de órgãos e tecidos (Vindigni et al., 

2009).  

A engenharia de tecidos é um campo relativamente novo dentro da medicina 

regenerativa, que utiliza como base o triângulo de proliferação celular proposto por 

Crane &amp;amp; Everts (2008) (Figura 2), o qual é composto pelas capacidades indutiva dos 

fatores de crescimento, condutiva dos scaffolds e gênica das células tronco ou 

progenitoras.

sangue total, composto por um concentrado de plaquetas, leucócitos e proteínas, 

disperso em uma pequena fração de plasma (Marx et al., 1998; Marx, 2004). 

Plaquetas são fragmentos citoplasmáticos anucleados presentes no sangue e 

produzidos na medula óssea a partir dos megacariócitos. São os menores 

componentes do sangue, e apresentam formato irregular e diâmetro de 2-3 µm. As 

plaquetas contêm um grande número de proteínas, citocinas e outros fatores bioativos, 

tais como fatores de crescimento, que iniciam e regulam aspectos básicos da 

cicatrização de tecidos.  

Leucócitos são as células brancas do sangue, compostos de linfócitos, 

granulócitos e agranulócitos.  

Plasma é a porção fluida do sangue que contém fatores de coagulação e outras 

proteínas e íons.  

A contagem normal de plaquetas no sangue é de 150.000 a 400.000 

plaquetas/?L (Foster et al., 2009, Engebretsen et al., 2010).  

O plasma rico em plaquetas (PRP) contém uma concentração de plaquetas de 

pelo menos 1.000.000 plaquetas/ ?L em 5 mL de plasma e está associado com a 

cicatrização. O PRP contém de 1,5 a 7 vezes a concentração de FCs do sangue total e 

é normalmente obtido por centrifugação diferencial (Foster et al., 2009). 

A liberação de fatores de crescimento ocorre após o processo de degranulação 

das plaquetas. As plaquetas são o primeiro tipo celular recrutado para o local da lesão e 

são responsáveis pela ativação da resposta inflamatória inicial do processo de 

cicatrização (Cole et al., 2010). 

Fatores de crescimento (FCs) são mediadores biológicos naturais que exercem 

vários efeitos sobre os processos de reparo e de regeneração. São polipeptídios 

capazes de regular diversos eventos celulares que incluem síntese de DNA, 

quimiotaxia, diferenciação e síntese de matriz extracelular. 

No PRP estes fatores de crescimento incluem 3 isômeros do fator de 

crescimento derivado de plaquetas (PDGF-??, PDGF-?? e PDGF-??), 2 isômeros do 

fator de crescimento transformador ? (TGF-?1 e TGF-?2), o fator de crescimento 

endotelial vascular (VEGF), o fator de crescimento semelhante à insulina (IGF), o fator 

de crescimento de fibroblastos básico (bFGF) e o fator de crescimento epitelial (EGF) 

(Cole et al., 2010; Engebretsen et al., 2010).  

Várias técnicas para a preparação do PRP têm sido utilizadas gerando diferentes 

produtos com diferentes propriedades biológicas e aplicações.  

A classificação mais atual (Figura 3) é a estabelecida por Ehrenfest et al. (2009)

de acordo com o conteúdo de leucócitos e de fibrina: plasma rico em plaquetas puro (P-

PRP): plasma rico em plaquetas e leucócitos (L-PRP), fibrina rica em plaquetas pura (P-

PRF) e fibrina rica em plaquetas e leucócitos (L-PRF).

categorias de concentrados de plaquetas classificados segundo Ehrenfest et al. (2009).

P-PRF=fibrina rica em plaquetas pura e L-PRF=fibrina rica em plaquetas e leucócitos. 

 

2.2.2. PRP na regeneração de tecidos  

O plasma rico em plaquetas é uma terapia simples, eficiente e minimamente 

invasiva para a obtenção de FCs autólogos. Sendo uma preparação autóloga, o PRP 

tem a vantagem de evitar a transmissão de doenças e o aparecimento de reações 

imunogênicas. 

Mariani et al. (2014) demonstraram que o PRP pode ser utilizado na inibição do 

crescimento bacteriano contra diferentes patógenos, fornecendo proteção adicional 

contra possíveis contaminações bacterianas durante intervenções cirúrgicas. 

Na regeneração de tecidos, o PRP atua como um selante do tecido e como um 

carreador de fatores de crescimento, onde as plaquetas iniciam a regeneração do 

tecido através da liberação local dos FCs via degranulação de seus ?-grânulos.  

As plaquetas no PRP são transportadas através de um coágulo, que contém 

moléculas de adesão celular incluindo fibronectina, fibrina e vitronectina. Na 

cicatrização de feridas, este coágulo age como uma matriz condutora ou scaffold 

natural sobre o qual as células aderem e iniciam o processo de cicatrização. 



11 

 

As plaquetas atuam no processo de hemostasia, cicatrização de feridas e re-

epitelização. Elas liberam diversos FCs que estimulam a angiogênese, promovendo 

crescimento vascular e proliferação de fibroblastos, que por sua vez proporcionam um 

aumento na síntese de colágeno (Marx, 2004). Além disso, os FCs promovem a 

proliferação celular e influenciam a diferenciação atuando diretamente na reparação e 

regeneração de tecidos (Nguyen et al., 2011) 

Nos estágios iniciais do processo de cicatrização (Figura 4), as plaquetas são 

ativadas na cascata de coagulação via colágeno endógeno, e os fatores de crescimento 

e as citocinas são liberados por estas plaquetas ativadas para auxiliar na cicatrização. 

A sequência de eventos que conduz à formação do novo tecido (quimiotaxia, migração, 

proliferação e diferenciação celular) é regulada pelos fatores de crescimento, muitos 

dos quais estão presentes no PRP (Tsay et al., 2005).

envolve três fases interpostas: (1) a fase inflamatória, (2) a fase de proliferação e (3) a 

fase de maturação e/ ou de remodelação.  

A fase inicial ocorre imediatamente após a lesão e envolve hemostasia e 

recrutamento de mediadores inflamatórios com duração de aproximadamente 1 

semana. A lesão tecidual ativa a ciclooxigenase-2 e leva à vasodilatação. Os FCs 

atraem os macrófagos e fibroblastos. A fase de proliferação permanece durante as 2 

semanas seguintes com formação de matriz extracelular, granulação, contração e 

reepitelização. A fase de remodelagem continua até que a produção de colágeno e do 

tecido de cicatrização seja finalizada. Esta fase pode durar até 1 ano e nela o colágeno 

tipo I substitui os proteoglicanos e a fibronectina para formar uma matriz mais forte com 

maior resistência à tração (Nguyen et al., 2011). 

Embora os mecanismos envolvidos na utilização do PRP ainda não estejam 

completamente elucidados, sua fácil aplicação na prática clínica e seu possível 

resultado benéfico tornam o PRP uma promissora ferramenta para a área médica 

(Alsousou et al., 2009). 

O plasma rico em plaquetas foi utilizado pela primeira vez por Ferrari et al. 

(1987) em cirurgia cardíaca com coração aberto como um componente de transfusão 

autólogo. Inicialmente, o PRP foi utilizado principalmente em cirurgias orais para 

promover a cicatrização do tecido e integração do implante, e controlar hemorragias 

(Anitua, 1999; Marx et al., 1998). Subsequentemente, também foi empregado em outras 

cirurgias incluindo cirurgias nos ombros (Everts et al., 2008), quadris (Everts et al., 

2007), procedimentos nas articulações dos joelhos (Sánchez et al., 2008; Ishida et al., 

2007), reconstrução de ligamentos (Radice et al., 2010) e cicatrização óssea 

(Kawasumi et al., 2008).  

Mais recentemente, o PRP com suas variantes tem sido empregado na forma 

injetável visando a cicatrização de diversos tecidos incluindo pele (Judith et al., 2010; 

Judith et al., 2012), músculos (van Ark et al., 2013), tendões (de Vos et al., 2010; Kaux 

&amp;amp; Crielaard, 2013), cartilagem (Kon et al., 2010; Kon et al., 2011) e osso (Jia et al., 

2011; Jiang et al., 2012).  

 

2.3. Scaffolds 

 

2.3.1. Definições 

Scaffolds são matrizes tridimensionais temporárias que funcionam como a matriz 

extracelular, organizando as células tridimensionalmente e estimulando o crescimento e 



13 

 

a formação do tecido desejado (Hutmacher, 2000).  

Os scaffolds são divididos em fluídos (injetáveis) e sólidos (convencionais), e 

podem ser fabricados em diversos formatos, os quais dependem da aplicação desejada 

e do processo de fabricação utilizado: esponjas (Amaral et al., 2006; Manferdini et al., 

2010), hidrogéis (Bhattacharyya et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2010), fibras (Yamane et al., 

2005, Iwasaki et al., 2011), membranas (Mathews et al., 2011; Mucha et al., 2012) 

micro e nano partículas (Cruz et al., 2008; Custódio et al., 2014), tubos (Venkatesan et 

al., 2012) e esferas (Shu &amp;amp; Zhu, 2002).  

Vários processos têm sido desenvolvidos para fabricar diferentes tipos de 

scaffolds entre eles destacam-se: evaporação de solvente/ lixiviação de partículas 

(solvent casting/ particulate leaching) (Mikos et al., 1994); espuma de gás (gas foaming) 

(Nam et al., 2000), liofilização (freeze-drying) (Madihally and Mathew, 1999); 

eletrofiação (electrospinning) (Huang et al., 2003), prototipagem rápida (rapid 

prototyping) (Peltola et al., 2008) e separação de fases termicamente induzida 

(thermally induced phase separation) (Pavia et al., 2008). 

A técnica de processamento escolhida deve obedecer, em termos gerais, aos 

seguintes critérios (Boccaccini et al., 2002):  

? O processo ou produção não deve afetar as propriedades dos materiais, isto é, a 

sua biocompatibilidade ou propriedades físico-químicas;  

? A técnica deve permitir um controle da porosidade, tamanho de poros, sua 

distribuição e interconectividade;  

? Grupos diferentes de matrizes devem exibir variações mínimas nas suas 

propriedades, quando processadas nas mesmas condições.  

As principais características que diferenciam as várias técnicas são a aplicação 

desejada e/ ou o uso de solventes; calor ou pressão; ou a utilização de aditivos 

responsáveis pela geração dos poros (Agrawal &amp;amp; Ray, 2001). 

 

2.3.2. Scaffolds na regeneração de tecidos 

Na engenharia de tecidos e medicina regenerativa, os scaffolds representam a 

capacidade condutiva e podem ser utilizados para transportar as células antes da sua 

implantação in vivo, ou servirem apenas como um material bioativo atraindo as células 

do tecido onde é implantado.  

Além de permitir a adesão e a migração celular dentro do suporte e promover a 

proliferação e a diferenciação celular, o scaffold deve fornecer um ambiente no qual as 

células possam manter seu fenótipo e sintetizar as proteínas e/ou outras moléculas 



14 

 

necessárias (Monteiro, 2008).  

 

2.3.3. Propriedades requeridas dos scaffolds 

Scaffolds utilizados em engenharia de tecidos e medicina regenerativa devem 

apresentar propriedades biológicas e físicas compatíveis com as condições fisiológicas 

in vitro e in vivo. Como mencionado anteriormente, a principal função dos scaffolds é 

proporcionar um suporte temporário adequado que permita os processos celulares 

necessários para a regeneração do tecido. Para isso, vários requisitos, dependentes do 

tipo de célula utilizada e do tecido a ser regenerado, devem ser considerados no 

desenvolvimento de scaffolds (Sachlos &amp;amp; Czernuszka, 2003). Os scaffolds devem: 

? Possuir estrutura tridimensional; 

? Possuir poros interconectados e de tamanho apropriado para favorecer a 

integridade e a vascularização do tecido; 

? Possuir porosidade que proporcione elevada área superficial para interação 

célula-scaffold; 

? Ser biodegradável e biocompatível; 

? Não apresentar nenhum componente ou subproduto de sua degradação que 

provoque reações inflamatórias ou tóxicas; 

? Apresentar superfície química que favoreça a adesão, proliferação e 

diferenciação das células; 

? Apresentar propriedades mecânicas adequadas para implantação e 

manipulação; 

? Ter bioatividade satisfatória para explorar o processo de reparação natural do 

tecido; 

? Ser facilmente fabricado em uma variedade de formas e tamanhos. 

Além dos requisitos necessários para a preparação dos scaffolds sólidos, os 

scaffolds fluidos devem apresentar as seguintes propriedades (Hou et al., 2004): 

? Injetabilidade; 

? Solidificação sob condições brandas; 

? Coesividade; 

? Força mecânica e resistência a forças in situ; 

? Possibilidade de incorporação de moléculas bioativas. 

Do ponto de vista clínico, a utilização de scaffolds fluidos é muito interessante, 

pois minimiza o desconforto do paciente, o risco de infecção, a formação de cicatrizes e 

o custo do tratamento já que não requer intervenção cirúrgica para sua implantação 



15 

 

(Hou et al., 2004).  

O material fluido pode preencher de forma homogênea o defeito ou ponto de 

reparo, pode incorporar vários agentes terapêuticos, e, finalmente, não exige 

procedimento cirúrgico invasivo para sua implantação (Gutowska et al., 2001). 

Além disso, a alta hidratação destes materiais mimetiza a matriz extracelular 

sendo, portanto, ideais para a proliferação e diferenciação celular. 

 

2.3.4. Materiais utilizados na fabricação de scaffolds 

A seleção dos materiais para a produção dos scaffolds é uma das etapas mais 

importantes e vários materiais têm sido propostos para sua fabricação, entre eles estão 

os metais, os polímeros de origem natural ou de origem sintética, os materiais 

cerâmicos e os compósitos.  

Embora os materiais metálicos e cerâmicos tenham contribuído para muitos 

avanços na área médica, principalmente na substituição de tecidos ortopédicos, eles 

apresentam duas importantes desvantagens para a aplicação em engenharia de 

tecidos: não são biodegradáveis e a processabilidade destes materiais é bastante 

limitada (Liu &amp;amp; Ma, 2004).  

Os polímeros biodegradáveis são considerados os materiais ideais para a 

produção destas matrizes e podem ser divididos em naturais e sintéticos.  

Os polímeros biodegradáveis naturais podem ser obtidos de fontes animais ou 

vegetais. São idênticos ou semelhantes às substâncias já encontradas no corpo e, 

portanto, a probabilidade de toxicidade ou de estimular uma reação inflamatória crônica 

é reduzida. Estes materiais também têm, geralmente, atividade biológica inerente, 

proporcionando assim sinalização para células sem a necessidade de adição de fatores 

exógenos. Eles também são susceptíveis a enzimas presentes no organismo e, 

portanto, são inerentemente biodegradáveis, sendo possível controlar suas taxas de 

degradação através de modificações químicas.  

No entanto, são frequentemente imunogênicos e sua manipulação e/ ou 

processamento são muito mais difíceis que a de polímeros sintéticos devido a sua 

complexidade.  

Além disso, o processo de extração desses materiais a partir de um tecido 

muitas vezes altera sua estrutura natural. Outra desvantagem é a variabilidade natural 

dos materiais derivados de fontes animais (Mann, 2003).  

Assim, a escolha do material para a produção dos scaffolds deve levar em 

consideração as vantagens e desvantagens desses materiais bem como a aplicação 



16 

 

pretendida. 

A seguir são apresentadas as principais caraterísticas dos biomateriais, ácido 

hialurônico e quitosana, utilizados neste trabalho para preparar os scaffolds compósitos 

estudados. 

 

2.3.4.1. Ácido hialurônico (AH) 

O AH é um biopolímero viscoelástico linear, composto de repetidas unidades 

dissacarídicas de ácido D-glicurônico (GlcUA) e N-acetilglicosamina (GlcNAc) unidas 

alternadamente por ligações glicosídicas ?-1,3 e ?-1,4 (Figura 5), encontrado 

naturalmente nos tecidos conjuntivos de mamíferos (Kuo et al., 2000) e produzido por 

bactérias do gênero Streptococcus (Pires et al., 2010). 

Devido a suas propriedades físicas, o AH tem funções no preenchimento de 

espaços, na lubrificação, na absorção de choque e na exclusão de proteínas. Além 

disso, suas propriedades bioquímicas incluem a modulação da resposta inflamatória 

das células, a interação com os proteoglicanos da matriz extracelular e a captura de 

radicais livres (Monheit &amp;amp; Coleman, 2006). Estudos também mostraram que o AH ligado 

a proteínas e a receptores específicos desempenha importante papel na embriogênese, 

na transdução de sinais, na motilidade celular e está ainda associado ao câncer e a 

metástase (Kogan et al., 2007).

Figura 5. Estrutura molecular do ácido hialurônico.  
 

Sendo assim, o ácido hialurônico tem sido amplamente aplicado nas áreas 

médicas e cosméticas, principalmente em cirurgias oftálmicas (Balazs, 1983); em 

terapias para o controle da artrite (Balazs &amp;amp; Denlinger, 1993), implante de próteses; 

cicatrização de feridas; prevenção de adesão de tecidos (Garg &amp;amp; Hales, 2004) e 

preenchimento dérmico (Holmström &amp;amp; Ricici, 1967). Além disso, devido a suas 



17 

 

propriedades físico-químicas e funções biológicas, o ácido hialurônico e seus derivados 

modificados também têm sido amplamente utilizados na administração de fármacos 

(Kim et al., 2005; Hahn et al., 2006) e na engenharia de tecidos (Ohri et al., 2004; West 

et al., 1985). 

As funções e aplicações do ácido hialurônico (AH) estão associadas 

basicamente às suas características estruturais e às possíveis modificações químicas 

do polímero, as quais determinam suas propriedades reológicas, de solubilidade, de 

hidratação e de reconhecimento celular específico. 

O AH é não-imunogênico, biocompatível e biodegradável, e por isso, possui 

diversas aplicações como biomateriais. Entretanto, sua aplicação na preparação de 

scaffolds requer prévia modificação do polímero visando melhorar suas propriedades 

mecânicas e químicas, e principalmente aumentar seu tempo de residência nos tecidos 

(biodisponibilidade). Como o AH natural apresenta um tempo de residência de 1 a 2 

dias e a maioria das aplicações médicas desse biopolímero requer um tempo de 

residência maior, modificações químicas do AH tem se tornado essenciais na 

preparação de produtos para aplicações médicas e cosméticas (Romagnoli &amp;amp; 

Belmontesi, 2008, Monheit &amp;amp; Coleman, 2006). 

A molécula de AH apresenta quatro grupos funcionais que podem ser 

modificados quimicamente: carboxílico, hidroxílico, acetamida e o terminal reduzido do 

polímero (Figura 6). Além disso, as ligações glicosídicas também podem ser 

hidrolisadas para formar cadeias menores ou oligossacarídeos. 

 

 
Figura 6. Grupos de modificação química da molécula de AH: (1) carboxílico, (2) 

hidroxílico, (3) acetamida, (4) Terminal Reduzido do Polímero (Adaptado de Garg &amp;amp; 

Hales, 2004). 

Além das modificações do AH através da adição de moléculas em sua cadeia 

(conjugação), o AH pode também ser modificado através de reticulação.  



18 

 

A reticulação do AH fornece moléculas maiores e mais estáveis, com 

biocompatibilidade similar à do AH não modificado. O polímero pode ser reticulado 

através de ligações covalentes irreversíveis (reticulação química), ou através da 

formação de várias ligações iônicas reversíveis (reticulação física). 

A reticulação pode ser realizada através da exposição direta do AH ao agente 

reticulante, ou através da reação de um derivado de AH altamente reativo 

primariamente sintetizado com o agente reticulante em uma reação secundária.  

A maioria dos métodos reportados na literatura para reticular o AH emprega 

reagentes polifuncionais tais como bis-epoxidos, carbodiimidas, dihidrazidas e divinil 

sulfona (Band, 1998). Entretanto, os agentes reticulantes mais comuns normalmente 

apresentam elevada citotoxicidade, a qual limita sua aplicação nas áreas médica e 

cosmética.  

A seguir serão discutidas brevemente as reações de modificações químicas do 

AH utilizadas neste trabalho. 

 

? Modificação do grupo carboxílico por amidação com iodeto de 2-cloro-1-

metilpiridínio (CMPI). Magnani et al. (2000) descreveram a reação de amidação usando 

CMPI como o agente de ativação dos grupos carboxílicos do AH. Esta reação é 

normalmente realizada em dimetilformamida (DMF) ou dimetilsulfóxido (DMSO), um 

solvente orgânico anidro, para minimizar a hidrólise do CMPI. Inicialmente, o 

hialuronato de sódio é convertido no sal de tetrabutilamônio (TBA) para permitir a sua 

solubilização no solvente orgânico. Para formar as ligações cruzadas entre as cadeias 

de AH, CMPI reage com o grupo carboxílico do HA, forma um intermediário piridíneo e 

libera o íon cloreto, o qual é neutralizado pelo tetrabutilamônio. Trietilamina neutraliza o 

íon iodeto liberado (Figura 7). Quando nenhuma amina é adicionada ao meio reacional, 

a esterificação ocorre entre o intermediário AH-CMPI ativado e os grupos hidroxílicos 

de uma mesma cadeia ou de cadeias diferentes de AH, formando uma ligação éster 

entre as cadeias de AH. Neste caso, temos uma reação de autoesterificação na qual é 

formado o derivado autorreticulado de ácido hialurônico (ACP = auto-crosslinked 

polymers) (Della Valle, 1994; Della Valle &amp;amp; Romeo, 1989). Os grupos carboxílicos do 

AH ativados por CMPI também podem reagir com um grupo carboxílico não ativado, 

porém o anidrido resultante é instável e subsequentemente reage com um grupo 

hidroxílico formando a mesma ligação éster. A desvantagem desse método é a 

necessidade de uma etapa adicional para a preparação do TBA-AH e de ter que ser 

realizado em um solvente orgânico que requer um processo de purificação longo. 



19 

 

 

Figura 7.  Preparação de ACP por autoesterificação organocatalisada usando o 

intermediário ativado AH-CPMI (Schanté et al., 2011).  

 

Na reação de autoesterificação organocatalisada é formada uma ligação 

covalente entre os grupos hidroxílicos e carboxílicos de uma mesma cadeia e/ ou de 

cadeias diferentes de AH, formando assim lactonas ou ligações ésteres 

intermoleculares. Nos derivados ACP, os grupos carboxílicos do AH estão 

completamente ou parcialmente esterificados. No caso de ésteres parcialmente 

esterificados, os grupos carboxílicos remanescentes podem ainda ser totalmente ou 

parcialmente esterificados com álcoois mono- ou polivalentes, formando assim grupos 

ésteres externos; podem permanecer livres e/ou serem salinizados com bases 

metálicas ou orgânicas (Bellini et al., 2001). 

A reticulação por autoesterificação da molécula de AH é uma excelente 

alternativa para preparação de derivados reticulados completamente biocompatíveis e 

que apresentam prolongado tempo de residência in vivo e/ ou melhores propriedades 

mecânicas em relação ao AH nativo.  

Embora sejam utilizados compostos orgânicos como os solventes e os 

catalisadores da reação, as etapas de lavagem do produto final mantêm sua 

biocompatibilidade (Bellini et al., 2001, Collins &amp;amp; Birkinshaw, 2007). 

A principal vantagem da formação das ligações ésteres sem a adição de agentes 

reticulantes tóxicos em relação a outros métodos de reticulação é ausência de 

moléculas estranhas inseridas nas cadeias de AH. Sendo assim, durante o processo de 

degradação do ACP in vivo, somente AH nativo é gerado.  

Além disso, o ACP pode ser preparado com vários graus de reticulação, os quais 

permitem adequar suas propriedades para inúmeras aplicações. 

 

? Modificação do grupo hidroxílico por formação de ligações éter utilizando 

epóxidos. Malson &amp;amp; Lindqvist (1986) patentearam a reticulação de AH utilizando 1,4-

butanodiol-diglicidíl éter (BDDE) em uma solução 0.25 M NaOH. A reação consiste da 

abertura do anel epóxido para formar ligações éter com os grupos hidroxílicos do AH 



20 

 

(Figura 8). Quando AH é submetido a valores de pH (pH&gt; 13) acima do pKa dos grupos 

hidroxílicos do AH (pKa~10), estes são desprotonados e se tornam mais do 

nucleofílicos que os grupos carboxílicos desprotonados. Os epóxidos, portanto, reagem 

preferencialmente com os grupos hidroxílicos para formar ligações éter.  

No entanto, quando o pH é menor do que o valor de pKa do grupo hidroxílico, 

uma quantidade menor de grupos hidroxílicos é desprotonada e os grupos carboxílicos 

aniônicos tornam-se predominantes, promovendo assim a formação da ligação éster. 

Isto tem sido demonstrado por De Belder &amp;amp; Malson (1986), que realizaram a reticulação 

de AH com BDDE em condições ácidas (pH 2-4,5).  

Atualmente, BDDE é usado na preparação da maioria dos hidrogéis de AH 

reticulados disponíveis no mercado. Além da síntese fácil, a degradação dos produtos 

de AH-BDDE não demonstram citotoxicidade e os compostos epóxidos são hidrolisados 

em dióis simples (Nishi et al., 1995).

2.3.4.2. Quitosana  

Quitosana (CHT) é um polissacarídeo derivado da quitina (copolímeros ?-(1?4)-

2-amino 2-desoxi-D-glicose e ?-(1?4)-2-acetamida 2-desoxi-D-glicose), encontrada em 

abundância na natureza, principalmente na carapaça de crustáceos. A quitosana pode 

ser obtida a partir da quitina por meio de desacetilação alcalina, podendo também estar 

naturalmente presente em alguns fungos pertencentes aos gêneros Mucor e 

Zygomicetes (Silva et al., 2006). 

A Figura 9 representa a estrutura química parcial da quitosana. 



21 

 

 

Figura 9. Estrutura molecular da quitosana. 

Os principais parâmetros que influenciam as características da quitosana são a 

sua massa molar (MM) e seu grau de desacetilação (GD), o qual representa o conteúdo 

de unidades desacetiladas. Em geral, o produto N-desacetilado da quitina só passa a 

ser considerado quitosana quando o GD se torna igual ou superior a 60%, percentagem 

a partir da qual o biopolímero se torna solúvel em soluções ácidas diluídas. O grau de 

desacetilação é um parâmetro muito importante, pois é capaz de influenciar as 

características químicas, físicas e biológicas do biopolímero.  

Do ponto de vista químico, o GD da quitosana exerce influência sobre algumas 

de suas propriedades, tais como hidrofilicidade, capacidade de reticulação na presença 

de determinados agentes reticulantes, solubilidade e viscosidade (Gonsalves et al., 

2011).  

Na sua forma cristalina, a quitosana é normalmente insolúvel em solução aquosa 

acima de pH 7, no entanto, em ácidos diluídos (pH&lt;6.0), os grupos amino livres 

protonados da glicosamina facilitam a solubilidade da molécula (Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew, 

1999). 

Nos últimos anos, pesquisadores das áreas médica e farmacêutica têm 

demonstrado grande interesse na utilização de quitosana devido principalmente a suas 

propriedades intrínsecas. A quitosana é um polímero biocompatível, devido à sua 

metabolização por certas enzimas humanas como a lisozima, sendo considerado, 

portanto, biodegradável (Nordtveit et al., 1996; Muzzarelli, 1997). Além disso, devido à 

sua carga positiva em pH fisiológico, a quitosana é também bioadesiva (He et al., 1998; 

Calvo et al., 1997; Bertram &amp;amp; Bodmeier, 2006), o que aumenta sua retenção no local da 

aplicação. A quitosana também promove a cicatrização de feridas (Antonov et al., 2008; 

Dai et al., 2011) e tem efeito antimicrobiano (Muzzarelli et al., 1990; Liu et al., 2001; Li 

et al., 2013). Finalmente, a quitina é muito abundante, e a produção da quitosana é de 

baixo custo e ecologicamente interessante (Berger et al., 2004).  

Além destas propriedades, estudos recentes mostraram que a quitosana e seus 

derivados são candidatos promissores a scaffolds principalmente devido à facilidade de 



22 

 

modificação química, possibilidade de ser moldada em várias formas (membranas, géis, 

esferas, esponjas, micro- e nanopartículas) e à sua elevada afinidade às 

macromoléculas in vivo. 

A versatilidade química da quitosana resulta principalmente da presença dos 

grupos amino em sua estrutura. Apesar da maioria das modificações químicas da 

quitosana ocorrer em seus grupos amino C-2, as hidroxilas em C-3 e C-6 das unidades 

estruturais do biopolímero também são susceptíveis a reações.  

A natureza química da quitosana fornece possibilidades para as modificações 

covalentes e iônicas, as quais também permitem a modulação das propriedades 

mecânicas e biológicas dos biomateriais produzidos, ampliando seu espectro de 

aplicação na engenharia de tecidos e medicina regenerativa. (Gonsalves et al., 2011). 

 

2.3.4.3. Complexos Polieletrolíticos de Ácido Hialurônico e Quitosana  

Complexos polieletrolíticos (PECs) são complexos poliméricos formados pela 

reação entre polímeros de cargas opostas. A formação e as propriedades dos PECs 

dependem da razão das cargas aniônicas e catiônicas dos polímeros, do grau de 

neutralização, da força iônica e da valência dos íons na solução eletrolítica. Os PECs 

preparados a partir polímeros naturais, tais como ácido hialurônico e quitosana, têm a 

vantagem de serem não tóxicos e bioabsorvíveis (Kim et al., 2004a; Kim et al., 2004b). 

Como dito anteriormente, o ácido hialurônico tem sido amplamente utilizado 

como scaffolds na cicatrização de feridas e na regeneração de tecidos, entretanto, a 

elevada densidade de cargas negativas do AH pode reduzir a adesão celular e interferir 

nos processos biológicos envolvidos na regeneração tecidual limitando sua aplicação 

(Ren et al., 2005; Correia et al., 2011). Uma boa alternativa para contornar esta 

limitação é combinar o AH com policátions tais como a quitosana.  

Testes in vitro mostraram que os PECs formados de CHT e AH podem ser 

utilizados como um material de suporte para o transplante de condrócitos autólogos e/ 

ou como scaffolds para a engenharia de tecidos, principalmente de tecidos da 

cartilagem (Sechriest et al., 1999). 

Correia et al. (2011) prepararam scaffolds de CHT com diferentes concentrações 

de AH (1, 5, 10%) por liofilização. Os scaffolds de CHT-AH não apresentaram 

citotoxicidade e promoveram adesão celular. Além disso, a incorporação de AH até uma 



23 

 

concentração de 5% melhorou as propriedades físico-químicas e biológicas dos 

scaffolds de CHT, favorecendo a adesão de condrócitos, proliferação celular e a 

produção de cartilagem, quando comparados aos scaffolds de CHT e a outras razões 

CHT-AH. 

Scaffolds porosos de AH e CHT foram preparados por Coimbra et al. (2011) 

visando regeneração de polpa dentária. Estudos in vitro mostraram que as células 

tronco mesenquimais (MSCs) aderiram e proliferaram sobre a superfície do scaffold, o 

que demonstrou a biocompatibilidade e não citotoxicidade do biomaterial.  

Majima et al. (2007) prepararam fibras de CHT com 0,1 % de ácido hialurônico 

que foram utilizadas como scaffolds para a engenharia de tecidos de ligamentos e 

tendões. Ensaios in vivo mostraram baixa toxicidade e baixa indução da inflamação. 

Além disso, ensaios in vivo mostraram que as propriedades mecânicas do ligamento ou 

do tendão engenheirado podem conferir maior estabilização das articulações.  

Lee et al. (2003) prepararam esponjas de AH-CHT em vários pHs por liofilização 

e avaliaram seu efeito de cicatrização de feridas na pele de ratos Wistar com ou sem o 

agente antimicrobiano sulfadiazina de prata. Os resultados mostraram a proliferação de 

fibroblastos na ferida e uma redução significativa de agentes infecciosos.  

 

2.4. Células Tronco Mesenquimais  

 

Células tronco mesenquimais são células indiferenciadas tradicionalmente 

encontradas na medula óssea. No entanto, as MSCs podem também ser isoladas a 

partir de outros tecidos, incluindo o tecido adiposo (h-AdMSCs).  

Atualmente, as h-AdMSCs são as células mais utilizadas na medicina 

regenerativa devido principalmente à facilidade de obtenção de grandes quantidades de 

células. 

As h-AdMSCs podem ser facilmente obtidas através de lipoaspiração, que é um 

método mais barato e menos invasivo que o procedimento de punção realizado para a 

obtenção das MSCs derivadas da medula óssea.  

Além disso, a frequência de h-AdMSCs no tecido adiposo (5000 células/g de 

gordura) é muito maior em relação às MSCs da medula óssea (100-1000 células/g) 

(Chavez-Munoz et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2008). 

Morfologicamente, as h-AdMSCs são fibroblastoides, com formato fusiforme. 



24 

 

Quando submetidas a diferentes estímulos, as h-AdMSCs apresentam potencial 

para se diferenciarem, in vitro ou in vivo, em células de tecidos mesodérmicos, como os 

adipócitos, as cartilagens, os ossos e o músculo esquelético; e não mesodérmicos, 

como os hepatócitos, as células pancreáticas endócrinas, os neurônios, os hepatócitos 

e as células endoteliais vasculares, possibilitando assim um vasto campo de aplicações 

na medicina regenerativa (Yarak &amp;amp; Okamoto, 2010) 

As h-AdMSCs também compartilham algumas características importantes das 

MSCs adultas, incluindo plasticidade, alto potencial proliferativo, capacidade de secretar 

moléculas protetoras bioativas e capacidade para modular a resposta imune (Bailey et 

al., 2010).  

Apesar das h-AdMSCs e PRP apresentarem propriedades benéficas para os 

processos celulares utilizados na regeneração de tecidos, estudos utilizando a 

combinação de h-AdMSCs e PRP ainda são escassos.  

A seguir são citados os principais trabalhos da literatura utilizando a combinação 

de PRP e h-AdMSCs, sem a presença de scaffolds. 

Baseados na avaliação clínica por ultrassonografia, Guercio et al. (2014) 

verificaram que a combinação de PRP e AdMSCs é uma terapia promissora para o 

tratamento de lesões em tendões de cavalos de competição.  

Pak et al. (2013) mostraram que terapias com h-AdMSCs/ PRP podem ser 

consideradas seguras quando utilizadas na forma de injeções percutâneas locais para o 

tratamento de diferentes condições ortopédicas.  

Em estudos realizados por van Pham et al. (2013), PRP promoveu a proliferação 

de h-AdMSCs e a diferenciação condrogênica. Além disso, estes autores observaram 

que PRP combinado com h-AdMSCs melhorou a cicatrização da cartilagem das 

articulações em modelos murinos quando comparados com PRP sem a presença de 

células. 

O efeito da liberação de FC do PRP e de BMP-2 (proteína morfogênica óssea) 

encapsulada em microesferas na proliferação e diferenciação osteogênica de h-

AdMSCs foi verificado por Chen et al. (2012). Para isso, estes autores prepararam 5 

compósitos: h-AdMSCs/ plasma pobre em plaquetas (PPP); h-AdMSCs/ PRP; BMP-2/ 

PPP; h-AdMSCs/BMP/PRP e h-AdMSCs/ BMP-2/ PPP. Os resultados mostraram que a 

liberação controlada de BMP-2 em combinação com o PRP é melhor do que uma única 

administração de PRP ou de BMP-2 na diferenciação osteogênica de h-AdMSCs. 

Kakudo et al. (2008) verificaram que concentrações menores que 20% de PRP 

ativado promovem significantemente a proliferação de h-AdMSCs. 



25 

 

2.5. Scaffolds Compósitos 

 

Embora o PRP seja uma fonte de FCs plaquetários, a liberação da maior parte 

desses fatores de crescimento ocorre dentro da primeira hora após a ativação 

plaquetária, apesar da liberação continuar durante todo o período de viabilidade das 

plaquetas (7 dias) (McCarrel &amp;amp; Fortier, 2009) 

Hokugo et al. (2005) mostraram que nenhuma regeneração óssea foi observada 

com o tratamento usando PRP livre, devido a sua rápida excreção do sítio de aplicação. 

Além disso, segundo Rossi et al. (2013), a eficácia dos FCs no processo de 

regeneração depende também da forma como esses FCs são disponibilizados no 

tecido lesionado.  

Assim, a liberação gradual dos FCs tem sido considerada benéfica nas terapias 

utilizando PRP.  

Em adição, na preparação do PRP, ocorre a formação de uma rede de fibrina, 

scaffold natural, decorrente da ativação das plaquetas e decomposição do fibrinogênio. 

No entanto, a rede de fibrina formada é frágil e possui viscoelasticidade e viscosidade 

limitadas pelo endurecimento das fibras sob altos níveis de cisalhamento, além de 

sofrer degradação rápida no meio biológico. 

Para proteger os FCs contra proteólise, prolongando assim sua atividade in vivo 

e melhorar a estabilidade da rede de fibrina do PRP, Tabata (2003) sugeriu combinar as 

funções dos scaffolds com a tecnologia de liberação controlada. 

Entretanto, trabalhos utilizando PRP associado a scaffolds visando potencializar 

a utilização dos FCs do PRP ainda são escassos.  

O desenvolvimento de scaffolds adequados para a utilização eficaz do PRP é 

ainda um grande desafio para a engenharia de tecidos.  

Embora vários trabalhos tenham descrito as propriedades físico-químicas, 

mecânicas e biológicas, e/ou as aplicações clínicas de diferentes scaffolds de quitosana 

e ácido hialurônico, ainda existem poucos trabalhos usando a combinação desses 

scaffolds com PRP, ou seja, utilizando scaffolds compósitos.  

Além disso, somente o trabalho descrito por Rossi et al. (2013) utilizou os três 

vértices da proliferação celular, usando scaffolds de quitosana, PRP e fibroblastos 

como fonte de células.  

Os principais trabalhos da literatura que descrevem a utilização de scaffolds 

compósitos de AH e CHT, que foram utilizados como base para este trabalho são 

descritos a seguir.  



26 

 

Ouyang et al. (2013) patentearam diferentes scaffolds compósitos de quitosana 

solúvel combinada com PRP para a reparação de tecidos, usando trombina e/ ou CaCl2 

como agonistas.  

Esponjas de glutamato de quitosana e de hialuronato de sódio combinadas com 

lisado de plaquetas e preparadas por liofilização utilizando glicina como crioprotetor, 

foram usadas por Rossi et al. (2013) como matrizes para a incorporação de FCs 

derivados do PRP. Os resultados de crescimento celular para fibroblastos obtidos para 

as esponjas de CHT e de AH foram similares aos valores encontrados para o lisado de 

plaquetas fresco.  

Kutlu et al. (2012) prepararam compósitos de quitosana/ PRP por 2 métodos 

diferentes: PRP foi adicionado ao gel de quitosana antes da liofilização e PRP foi 

embebido no scaffold liofilizado. Estes autores demonstraram que scaffolds de 

quitosana, especialmente na forma de géis, podem ser apropriados carreadores para o 

PRP fornecendo liberação controlada dos fatores de crescimento.  

Uma terapia de etapa única para o tratamento de defeitos osteocondrais de 

coelhos utilizando fragmentos autólogos de cartilagem e scaffolds compostos de ácido 

hialurônico (AH), cola de fibrina humana e PRP foi proposta por Marmotti et al. (2012). 

Esses autores observaram que os fragmentos de cartilagem autólogos em AH/ cola de 

fibrina/ PRP fornecem uma fonte eficiente de células e permitem uma melhor reparação 

do defeito. A cola de fibrina, no entanto, dificultou o processo de cicatrização nos 

coelhos.  

Fathi (2012) demonstrou que a utilização de PRP sozinho ou em combinação 

com AH acelerou a cicatrização de feridas em coelhos adultos comparado ao AH livre 

usado como controle. 

A eficácia do uso de PRP e da viscossuplementação com injeções intra-

articulares de AH para o tratamento de lesões degenerativas da cartilagem do joelho e 

osteoartrite foram comparadas por Kon et al. (2011). Injeções autólogas de PRP 

mostraram maior eficácia e maior duração que as injeções de AH na redução da dor e 

dos sintomas; e recuperação da função articular. Melhores resultados foram 

conseguidos em pacientes mais jovens e em degenerações da cartilagem menos 

intensas, enquanto que um pior resultado foi obtido em articulações mais degeneradas 

e em pacientes mais idosos, em quem os resultados foram semelhantes aos da 

viscossuplementação. 

He et al. (2010) estudaram a ativação e a adesão plaquetária em scaffolds de 

quitosana e quitosana-heparina combinados com PRP. Eles observaram, in vitro, que 



27 

 

os scaffolds de quitosana-heparina quando combinados com PRP apresentam 

supressão da adesão e ativação das plaquetas em relação com os scaffolds de 

quitosana/PRP. 

O efeito de PRP, de esponjas de quitosana e da combinação deles, na 

regeneração óssea de defeitos cranianos de coelhos foi investigado por Oktay et al. 

(2010). Para isso, eles criaram e enxertaram 4 defeitos cranianos, com um diâmetro de 

4,5 mm com os 3 grupos. Os coelhos foram mortos entre a quarta e oitava semana, e 

os defeitos foram analisados histologicamente. Maior formação óssea foi observada no 

grupo contendo PRP com preenchimento completo do defeito com osso trabecular. Os 

defeitos que foram preenchidos somente com esponjas de quitosana mostraram uma 

quantidade limitada de osso, e a presença de tecido fibroso.  

Uma nova abordagem terapêutica para estimular a regeneração de feridas 

complexas em membros inferiores, com base em um tratamento composto de PRP e 

curativo de AH foi avaliada por Cervelli et al. (2011). Após um único tratamento, os 

autores observaram que o tempo médio de re-epitelização foi de 8,1 semanas em 

73,3% dos pacientes tratados com o PRP-AH versus 30% dos pacientes tratados 

apenas com AH. 

Um compósito injetável de fosfato tricálcico/ quitosana (FTC/CHT) e PRP para a 

reconstrução de defeitos de tíbias de cabras foi preparado por Bi et al. (2010). Esses 

autores mostraram que a adição de PRP aumentou a biocompatibilidade e a 

osteocondutividade do FTC/CHT sem comprometer sua força mecânica e injetabilidade. 

Chang et al. (2009) mostraram que compósitos preparados pela associação de 

PRP ativado e microesferas de CaSO4/ quitosana, preparadas utilizando campo 

eletrostático de alta tensão, melhoraram a regeneração óssea em torno dos alvéolos 

orais de porcos.  

A possibilidade de utilizar quitosana como substituto da trombina durante a 

preparação PRP foi avaliada por Shen et al. (2006). Os resultados obtidos por estes 

autores mostraram aumento na adesão e da agregação de plaquetas, além de maiores 

concentrações de fatores de crescimento do PRP após utilização da quitosana, 

sugerindo que quitosana e/ ou seus derivados podem substituir a trombina em 

preparações do PRP.

Abstract. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro performance of activated platelet-rich 

plasma associated with porous sponges of chitosan as a composite scaffold for 

proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived 

mesenchymal stem cells. The sponges were prepared by controlled freezing (?20, ?80, 

or ?196°C) and lyophilization of chitosan solutions (1, 2, or 3% w/v). The platelet-rich 

plasma was obtained from controlled centrifugation of whole blood and activated with 

calcium and autologous serum. The composite scaffolds were prepared by embedding 

the sponges with the activated platelet-rich plasma. The results showed the 

performance of the scaffolds was superior to that of activated platelet-rich plasma alone, 

in terms of delaying the release of growth factors and increased proliferation of the stem 

cells. The best preparation conditions of chitosan composite scaffolds that coordinated 

the physicochemical and mechanical properties and cell proliferation were 3% (w/v) 

chitosan and a ?20°C freezing temperature, while ?196°C favored osteogenic

differentiation. Although the composite scaffolds are promising for regenerative 

medicine, the structures require stabilization to prevent the collapse observed after five 

days. 

 

3.1. Introduction 

 

In tissue engineering, a scaffold is a three-dimensional matrix for the stimulation 

of cell proliferation and the formation of new tissue. To achieve this goal, scaffolds must 

meet some specific requirements such as mimicking the native extracellular matrix 

(ECM) of the target tissue; allowing cell attachment, migration, proliferation, and 

differentiation and maintenance of the target phenotype; promoting vascularization and 

nutrient delivery; and having a biodegradation rate and mechanical properties that are 

adequate to support the formation of the new tissue (Langer &amp;amp; Vacanti, 1993). 

According to Crane &amp;amp; Everts (2008), tissue regeneration is based on a 

proliferation triangle composed of the three fundamental elements: cells, growth factors 

(GFs) and scaffolds, which are in a close relationship through their capabilities. Thus, 

scaffolds provide the conductive matrix for supporting the genic capability of progenitor 

cells mediated by the inductive capability of GFs (Chen et al., 2002). Optimal conditions 

for tissue regeneration must come from the interaction of the properties of those 

elements. 

The cell responses to the surface chemistry of scaffolds depend on their 

hydrophobicity, protein adsorption, surface charge, and roughness, softness, and 

stiffness. Additionally, the porous architecture characterized by the pore size, porosity, 

connectivity, and tortuosity plays important roles, as described and discussed by Chang 

&amp;amp; Wang (2011). Therefore, bringing together all these properties in solid scaffolds is an 

enormous technological challenge.  

The fibrin matrix is the natural scaffold formed from the coagulation cascade in 

the healing process. Under injury, thrombin cleaves the soluble plasma protein 

fibrinogen into peptide fragments, yielding insoluble fibrin peptides that aggregate and 

form fibrils. A fibrin network is then formed, which entraps platelets and other blood 

components (Bensaïd et al., 2003; Weisel &amp;amp; Nagaswami, 1992). Calcium acts as a 



43 

 

cofactor of thrombin, modulates the elongation of fibers during polymerization by 

promoting lateral branching, and functions in clot stability (Falvo et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 

1999). Calcium and thrombin also activate platelets, allowing the release of GFs and 

cytokines. Therefore, the fibrin matrix provides an optimized medium for cell proliferation 

and healing.  

Based on these features, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been widely used in 

regenerative medicine. PRP is an autologous product prepared from whole blood by 

separating the red blood cells and concentrating the platelets and other components of 

plasma. However, although viscoelastic, the fibrin matrix alone lacks stability to be 

efficient when regenerative medicine is the goal.  

To mimic the natural healing process and improve the stability of the fibrin matrix, 

we propose in this work the use of the fibrin network from activated PRP with porous 

chitosan as a composite scaffold for tissue regeneration.  

Our hypothesis is that the chemical nature of the chitosan surface supports the 

fibrin network by electrostatic attachment, thus prolonging its stability, without changing 

the paracrine affinity of mesenchymal cells to fibrin fibers. As a consequence, the 

composite scaffold must improve cell proliferation and tissue differentiation compared to 

PRP alone.  

Related works showed the effects of chitosan on blood coagulation through the 

strong adhesion of platelets to the surface of chitosan particles, as well as chitosan 

(0.1–1mg/mL) incorporated with PRP to enhance the release of PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 

from platelets (Kojima et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2003). Shen et al. (2006) 

demonstrated that chitosan could be an appropriate substitute for thrombin, as an 

agonist in PRP preparation. Chang et al. (2009) showed that growth factors could 

sustain release until 12 h at approximately 1 ng/mL from chitosan/CaSO4/PRP 

microspheres after activation with thrombin. Kutlu et al. (2012) showed that scaffolds 

prepared by the freeze-drying of PRP added to chitosan gel (2% w/v) were more 

effective than chitosan sponges soaked with PRP on controlled GF release. Oktay et al. 

(2010) applied PRP-embedded chitosan sponges to defects and showed a histological 

tendency toward increased bone formation. Mathews et al. (2011) demonstrated that 

chitosan enhanced mineralization by upregulating the genes associated with 



44 

 

mineralization and calcium-binding proteins.  

Chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from chitin (copolymers ?-(1?4)-2-amino-2-

deoxy-D-glucose and ?-(1?4)-2-acetamido 2-deoxy-D-glucose) found in the shells of 

marine crustaceans and insects and the cell walls of some fungi (Muzzarelli, 1973; 

Berger et al., 2004).  

In the last ten years, considerable attention has been given to chitosan-based 

materials in the field of tissue engineering (Nwe et al., 2009; Martins et al., 2014). The 

beneficial properties of chitosan have been proven, such as biodegradability (Nordtveit 

et al., 1996; Koga, 1998), biocompatibility (Molinaro et al., 2002; Rücker et al., 2006), 

antibacterial activity (Muzzarelli et al., 1990; Li et al., 2013), cell adhesion (He et al., 

1998; Bertram &amp;amp; Bodmeier, 2006), and wound healing properties (Antonov et al., 2008; 

Dai et al., 2011). Moreover, the chemical nature of chitosan gives many possibilities for 

ionic and covalent modifications that allow for the modulation of the mechanical and 

biological properties of biomaterials (Agnihotri et al., 2004; Adekogbe &amp;amp; Ghanem, 2005).  

Regarding the technological aspects, chitosan can be easily processed in diverse 

forms in the absence of toxic solvents, such as films (Mucha et al., 2012), sponges 

(Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew, 1999; Amaral et al., 2006), fibers (Majima et al., 2007), beads 

(Shu &amp;amp; Zhu, 2002), hydrogels (Tan et al., 2009), and microparticles/nanoparticles 

(Lavertu et al., 2006). Furthermore, chitosan supports sterilization (Rao &amp;amp; Sharma, 

1995), is abundant in nature, and requires only low-cost processing in nonaggressive 

ecological conditions before being used as a raw material (Berger et al., 2004).  

Freeze-drying is the most common and simplest method to produce porous 

chitosan scaffolds. The freezing process provides the nucleation of ice crystals from 

solution and further growth along the lines of thermal gradients. Exclusion of the 

chitosan acetate salt from the ice crystal phase and subsequent ice removal by 

lyophilization generate a porous material (Cardea et al., 2010; Costa-Pinto et al., 2011).  

Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew (1999) reported that the pore size of chitosan scaffolds 

produced by lyophilization can be controlled within the range of 1–250 ?m. A more 

uniform and interconnected pore structure can be obtained when lower freezing 

temperatures are used. Furthermore, the pore orientation is related to the geometry of 

the moldings used and can also be controlled by changing thermal gradients during 



45 

 

freezing (Shen et al., 2000).  

The microstructure, crystallinity, and mechanical strength of the porous chitosan 

matrix also can be controlled by the chitosan concentration, molecular weight, and 

deacetylation degree (Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew, 1999; Nettles et al., 2002).  

In this work, the effects of PRP association were studied regarding to the porous 

structure of solid sponges, which were produced by varying chitosan concentration and 

freezing conditions. The biological performance of association was evaluated in terms of 

growth factor release kinetics, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of seeded 

human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs). 

 

3.2. Experimental 

 

3.2.1. Materials 

Chitosan (average molecular weight [Mw] = 4 × 105 Da, degree of deacetylation = 

83± 4%) was purchased from Polymar (Fortaleza, CE, Brazil) and purified according to 

the protocol described by Nasti et al. (2009). Other chemicals were of reagent grade and 

were used without any further purification. All biological experiments were performed 

with human adipose tissue-derived stem mesenchymal cells (h-AdMSCs) and approved 

by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Sciences School of the University of Campinas 

(UNICAMP; CAAE: 0972.0.146.000-11). The donors were healthy individuals aged 

between 30 and 40 years old who were previously assessed through clinical 

examinations. 

 

3.2.2. Methods 

3.2.2.1. Preparation of Porous Chitosan Scaffolds (PCHTs) 

PCHTs were prepared by freezing at a controlled temperature of a chitosan 

solution previously poured in 24-well culture plates (TPP, polystyrene, diameter = 15.4 

mm) to give them a cylindrical shape, followed by lyophilizing in lyophilizer L101 

(Liobras, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) at a temperature of approximately ?30°C for 48 hours.  

 



46 

 

Effects of Chitosan Concentration. Chitosan solutions with concentrations of 1, 2, 

or 3% (w/v) were prepared by dissolution in 0.2 mol.L?1 acetic acid for 24 hours at room 

temperature. The solutions were frozen at ?20°C for 24 hours and lyophilized. 

 

Effects of Freezing Conditions. Chitosan solution (3% w/v) was prepared as 

previously described. The solution was frozen at ?20°C in a freezer for 24 hours; ?80°C 

in an ultrafreezer for 24 hours; or ?196°C by immersion in liquid N2; and lyophilized. 

 

3.2.2.2. Characterization of Porous Chitosan Scaffolds (PCHTs) 

Morphology and Pore Size. The morphology of PCHTs was evaluated by 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an LEO 440i Electron Microscopy/Oxford 

(Cambridge, England) operated at 5 kV accelerating voltage. The scaffolds were gold-

coated using a sputter coater POLARON SC7620, VG Microtech (Uckfield, England) for 

180 s at a current of 3 mA. Pore size (? = 20) was measured using software Image J 

1.47t. 

 

Mechanical Properties. Mechanical compression tests of PCHTs (? = 3) were 

performed using a Universal Testing Machine, MTS model 810-Flex Test 40 (MTS 

Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) up to 60% strain, according to Correia et 

al. (2011). The testing machine was equipped with a 1.5 kN load cell, and the loading 

rate was 5 mm/min. Young’s modulus was calculated in the initial linear section of the 

stress-strain curve, when the strain was lower than 10%.  

 

Degradation in PBS. The degradation profile of the PCHTs in PBS at 37°C was 

performed by the gravimetric method described by Tang &amp;amp; Spector (2007) through 

measurements of loss weight. 

 

Water Sorption. The water sorption was determined by swelling of PCHTs 

(previously weighted) in PBS (LB Laborclin, Pinhais, PR, Brazil) at pH 7.4 for 24 hours 

at 37°C. The swollen PCHTs were weighed after the removal of excess water by 

keeping the surfaces on a filter paper. The swelling ratio (SR) was also calculated using 



47 

 

Equation (1): 

 

?? =
??

??
                                                                                                                        Equation (1) 

 

where ?? and ?? are the weights of the scaffolds in the swelled state and the dry state, 

respectively.  

 

Porosity. The porosity (?) of the PCHTs was determined according to the protocol 

used by Wang et al. (2003) and calculated by Equation (2): 

 

? (%) =  
???(

??

?
)

??
 ? 100                                                                                              Equation (2) 

 

where ?? is the total volume of PCHTs (cm3), ? is the density of nonporous CHT (1.342 

g/cm3), and ?? is the weight of sponge (g). Values are expressed as the mean ± 

standard deviation (? = 3). 

 

Cell Compatibility. The compatibility was carried out by exposing PCHTs to h-

AdMSCs followed by cultivation at 37°C for 24 hours and evaluation by MTT assay (3-

[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT, Molecular Probes) 

according to a modified Mosmann method (1983). The MTT assay is a colorimetric test 

based on the reduction of yellow tetrazolium salt into a purple formazan product in 

presence of cells (Gümüdereliolu &amp;amp; Aday, 2011). 

 

3.2.2.3. PRP Preparations 

PRP Concentration. P-PRP (plasma rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes) was 

prepared according to Perez et al. (2013). Briefly, whole blood (WB) was collected into 

3.5 mL vacuum tubes (Vacuette, Campinas, SP, Brazil) containing sodium citrate 3.2% 

(w/v) as an anticoagulant. WB was initially centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge 

(Hettich Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 100 ×g for 10 minutes at 25°C. After the 

formation of three layers (a bottom layer composed mainly of red blood cells (RBCs); an 

upper layer composed of plasma, platelets, and some WB cells; and an intermediate 



48 

 

layer, or buffy coat, composed mostly of WB cells), only the upper layer was collected to 

obtain PPRP. The concentration of platelets, WB cells, and RBCs in WB and P-PRP 

were determined using the ABX Micros ES 60 hematology analyzer (HORIBA ABX 

Diagnostics, Montpellier, France). 

 

P-PRP Activation. Activated P-PRP (?P-PRP) was obtained by adding 

autologous serum (Ser) and 10% (w/v) CaCl2 solution as agonists using the following 

proportions: agonist/P-PRP = 20% (v/v), Ser/CaCl2 volumetric ratio = 9. Autologous 

serum was prepared by collecting 5 mL of WB in tubes without anticoagulant. After 30 

minutes to form clots, WB was centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10 minutes (Perez et al., 

2014). 

 

3.2.2.4. The Composite Scaffolds (?P-PRP/PCHTs) 

Preparation. ?P-PRP/PCHTs was prepared for embedding by dripping ?P-PRP, 

immediately after activation, into PCHTs. The preparation was carried out in 48-well 

microplates using a ratio of 200 µL of ?P-PRP to 10–20 mg of PCHTs. 

 

Release of GFs. The release of platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) and 

transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) was performed after 1 hour of gelation of ?P-

PRP associated with PCHTs in the presence of the culture medium (Dulbecco’s 

Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM-LG) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) with low glucose 

concentration). The culture medium (1.5 mL) was added to ?P-PRP/PCHTs in 48-well 

microplates, which were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 throughout the assays. 

The total volume of culture medium was withdrawn at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours, and the 

same volume of fresh medium was replaced without removing the hydrogels from the 

wells. The samples were stored at ?80°C for further characterization. The 

concentrations of the released GFs PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 were measured using 

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 

USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications. 

 

h-AdMSCs Proliferation. The cultivation of h-AdMSCs was carried out in 24-well 



49 

 

tissue culture plates by adding 1 mL DMEM to the seeded composite scaffolds (? = 4). 

The composite scaffolds seeded were maintained at 37°C for 10 days. Cell proliferation 

was quantified using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. At 3, 5, 7, and 

10 cultivation days, the composite scaffolds were removed and transferred to 24-well 

plates. MTT (1 mL of 1 mg/mL) was then added, and the cultivation proceeded at 37°C 

for 4 hours. The MTT solution was then discarded, and 1 mL of DMSO was added to 

dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The samples were shaken at 120 rpm for 30 min 

to ensure homogeneous dissolution of the formazan dye, and then 200 µL of each 

sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. Optical density was measured at 595 nm 

using a microplate reader (Filter Max F5, Molecular Devices). The isolation and pre-

cultivation of h-AdMSCs as well as the cell seeding were performed as described below. 

 

h-AdMSCs Isolation and Pre-cultivation. Human subcutaneous adipose tissue 

that was initially acquired from liposuction surgery was washed with sterile PBS, 

separated into fractions of 10 g, digested with 20 mg of collagenase type 1A and 

maintained in 20 mL of DMEM-LG containing 10% BSA (bovine serum albumin) and 10 

µL of gentamicin for 30 min in a 37°C bath. After complete digestion, the reaction was 

quenched with 10 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS) and immediately centrifuged for 15 min 

at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 10 mL 

DMEM-LG with 10% FBS. After pre-cultivation for 24 h, the culture medium was 

changed every 3 days; after the fourth passage, the cells were characterized by 

immunophenotyping (data not shown) using flow cytometry and according to their 

adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation and then used in the 

subsequent experiments. 

 

h-AdMSCs-Seeding. The pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were trypsinized and 

resuspended in P-PRP to a final cell concentration of 1 × 104 cells/mL. P-PRP 

containing h-AdMSCs was activated and immediately embedded to the PCHTs in a 24-

well tissue culture plate, using 200 µL of h-AdMSCs + ?P-PRP per 10–20 mg of PCHTs. 

The composite scaffolds with h-AdMSCs were kept at room temperature for 45 minutes 

for consolidation of the fibrin network. Pure PRP was used as control.

3.2.2.5. Images of the h-AdMSCs-Seeded Composite Scaffolds 

The images of the cell-seeded composite scaffolds were obtained by scanning 

electron microscopy after 5 days of h-AdMSCs proliferation. The cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 

phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 hours. The samples were than dehydrated in ethanol for 

15 min intervals in aqueous 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol solutions (2x) and dried 

at the critical point dryer BAL-TEC CPD 030 (Schalksmühle, Germany). After gold 

coating (Sputter Coater POLARON, SC7620, VG Microtech), the cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were visualized with a SEM (Leo440i, LEO) with an accelerating voltage of 20 

kV. 

 

3.2.2.6. Induction of Osteogenic Differentiation 

h-AdMSCs seeded in the composite scaffolds were induced to differentiate into 

the osteogenic lineage by providing the osteogenic medium containing DMEM-LG 

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% ?-glycerol-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 

USA), 1% L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% dexamethasone 

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Gibco, 

Grand Island, NY, USA). The medium was changed every 7 days. 

 

Evaluation of Differentiation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring the 

alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) on day 14. The supernatant (200 µL) was collected 

and mixed with the same volume of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (SIGMAFAST p-nitrophenyl 

phosphate tablets, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) as substrate and incubated at room 

temperature for 30 minutes. Absorbance was read immediately at 405 nm. 

 

3.2.2.7. Statistical Analysis 

Each experiment was carried out in triplicate unless otherwise specified. All 

results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).The experimental data 

from all the studies were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistical 

significance was set to ? value ? 0.05.

3.3. Results and Discussion 

 

3.3.1. Experimental Design 

In this study, we prepared novel composite scaffolds by association of PRP with 

the 3D-porous structure of chitosan. First, different 3D-porous structures of chitosan 

(PCHTs) were prepared by freeze-drying by varying the CHT concentration and freezing 

conditions (temperature and freezing rate). Second, the microstructure and mechanical 

properties of the PCHTs were characterized and evaluated for cell compatibility. The 

surface chemistry, hydrophilicity, and positive charge of –NH2 groups in acidic medium 

were maintained unaltered.  

The composite scaffolds (?P-PRP/PCHTs) were obtained by embedding the 

PCHTs with immediately activated P-PRP in a 24-well microplate. The release of the 

GFs (PDGF-AB and TGF-?1) from the composite scaffolds was evaluated in DMEM 

culture medium. Afterwards, pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were added to PRP before 

activation in order to obtain cell-seeded composite scaffolds. In vitro examination of h-

AdMSCs proliferation kinetics was performed over 10 days by using the cell-seeded 

composite scaffolds in DMEM. Additionally, osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by 

ALP activity measurements after 14 days. Thus, we verified the correlation between the 

structure and function of PCHTs by controlling the concentration and freezing conditions 

of chitosan solution. 

 

3.3.2. Effects of Freezing Conditions and Chitosan Concentration on 

PCHTs 

3.3.2.1. Images of Porous Structure 

Figures 10(a) – 10(c) show images of the porous structure from controlled 

freezing at ?20°C by varying the concentration of the chitosan solution (1, 2, or 3%) and 

subsequent lyophilization. The images show highly porous structures with rounded 

pores that interconnected, regardless of CHT concentration. Differences in chitosan 

molecular weight, deacetylation degree, and purity make difficult comparisons even for 



52 

 

similar treatment. Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew (1999) showed a higher pore interconnectivity 

degree and more open pores for 1% (w/w) chitosan concentration for a similar 

deacetylation degree, but other properties were not characterized.

(e) PCHTs 3% (?196°C). Original magnification is ×100 and the scale bar represents 

200 µm. 

 

Freezing conditions produced a more prominent effect on the morphology of the 

pores [Figures 10(d) – 10(e)] attributed the variations in the freezing rate used to 

achieve the temperatures evaluated. In contrast with rounded pores at ?20°C (3% CHT) 

[Figure 10(c)], we observed pores with leaf structure at ?80°C [Figure 10(d)], while 

smaller and elongated open pores were produced at ?196°C [Figure 10(e)]. In all cases, 

the pores were uniformly distributed and radially oriented and had a high degree of 

interconnectivity. 

The pore structures allow uniform cell spatial distribution throughout the scaffold, 

facilitating homogeneous tissue formation. Moreover, the differences in pore 

morphologies obtained are suitable to several cell linage and type of tissue to be 



53 

 

regenerated. 

 

3.3.2.2. Characterization of PCHTs 

Physicochemical and Mechanical Properties. Table 1 shows physicochemical 

characterization of the PCHTs. At ?20°C, the mean diameter of rounded pores could be 

controlled around the 300–400 µm, regardless of the CHT concentration, although there 

is a large distribution. 

However, the elongated pores from Figures 10(d) – 10(e) were markedly 

decreased with freezing conditions from 2615 µm (?80°C) to 280 µm (?196°C) because 

crystal growth and hence pore size are functions of both heat and mass transfer rates, 

determined by the temperature and freezing rate. At ?80°C, the observed differences in 

pore shape and size suggest parallel ice crystal growth, which in turn was caused by the 

strongly one-dimensional nature of the thermal gradients established during freezing, as 

discussed by Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew (1999). 

The diverse nature of tissue architectures requires scaffolds with optimal pore 

sizes, such as 5 µm for neovascularization (Brauker et al., 1995), 5–15 µm for fibroblast 

ingrowth (Klawitter &amp;amp; Hulbert, 1971), 20 µm for the ingrowth of hepatocytes (Yang et al., 

2001), 200–900 µm for osteoconduction (Salgado et al., 2004), and 20–125 µm for 

regeneration of adult mammalian skin (Yannas et al., 1989). 

According to these data, the rounded pores obtained at ?20°C or elongated at 

?196°C are adequate for bone tissue, although other properties could also influence the 

choice. Moreover, because human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-

AdMSCs) exhibit a spindle-like shape and are 80–100 µm in diameter and ?200 µm in 

length (Chavez-Munoz et al., 2013), the range of pore sizes in our PCHTs allows cells to 

migrate freely into the scaffolds, favoring the formation of a new tissue.

The porosity is also an important aspect of cell migration and proliferation, 

guiding and promoting the formation of new tissue. Porosity is defined as the percentage 

of void space in a solid and is a morphological property independent of material (Léon y 

Léon, 1998). A porosity higher than 90% and pore interconnectivity are basic 

requirements for scaffolds in tissue engineering because they affect the diffusion of 

physiological nutrients and gases to and the removal of metabolic waste and byproducts 

from cells that have penetrated the scaffold (Leong et al., 2003; Liu &amp;amp; Ma, 2004). 

Moreover, the porosity often compromises the mechanical and structural stability of the 

scaffolds and must be evaluated in accordance with the application and degradation rate 

of materials utilized (Loh &amp;amp; Choong, 2013).  

The porosity values of PCHTs scaffolds ranged from 91.0 to 97.0% (Table 1), 

which are adequate for TE, independent of CHT concentration or freezing conditions. 

However, the porosity decreased with increasing chitosan concentration. The highest 

porosity was provided from 1% chitosan solution, but there was not a direct relationship 

with freezing conditions. The PCHTs prepared at ?80°C showed a significantly lower 

porosity even with higher pore size, probably due to their leaf structure. 

To guide tissue regeneration, scaffolds should also have sufficient mechanical 

strength during in vitro culturing to maintain the spaces required for cell in-growth and 

matrix elaboration (Leong et al., 2003). Moreover, their mechanical properties should be 

similar to the properties of tissues generated to provide an adequate structural support 

in the stage of healing (Cheung et al., 2007). 

Scaffolds for the regeneration of hard tissue must exhibit a mechanical modulus 

in the range of 10–1,500 MPa, while scaffolds for soft tissues must exhibit a mechanical 

modulus in the range of 0.4–350 MPa (Hollister, 2005). 



55 

 

In this work, we observed a drastic decrease in Young’s modulus (Table 1) with a 

decrease in CHT concentration. Better mechanical properties were found for a CHT 

concentration of 3%.  

The PCHTs 3% (w/v) prepared at ?80°C showed lower mechanical strength than 

those prepared at ?20°C and ?196°C with the same CHT concentration, which could be 

attributed to its leaf structure and pore size. There was no significant difference (? &amp;lt;

0.05) in mechanical properties for PCHTs 3% (w/v) frozen at ?20°C or ?196°C. Thus, 

the range of Young’s moduli found for PCHTs suggests their application for soft tissue 

engineering. For hard tissues, these scaffolds must be crosslinked and/or reinforced by 

the addition of fillers. 

The water absorption capacity (swelling ratio) of the scaffolds affects cell growth 

indirectly (Enrione et al., 2010). The hydration of the scaffolds is a necessary step for 

cell incorporation and proliferation. 

PCHTs scaffolds showed a high swelling capacity in PBS (pH 7.4) regardless of 

chitosan concentration and freezing conditions, allowing for rapid hydration when culture 

medium was added. 

 

Degradation in PBS. Scaffold degradation is also an important parameter for the 

formation of new tissue. The scaffold degradation rate must be tuned appropriately with 

the growth rate of the new tissue in such a way that by the time the injury site is 

completely regenerated, the scaffold is completely degraded (Salgado et al., 2004). 

Degradation can occur through mechanisms that involve physical or chemical processes 

and/or biological processes that are mediated by biological agents, such as enzymes 

(Langer &amp;amp; Vacanti, 1993).  

Here, we evaluated in vitro the profile degradation of PCHTs in PBS (pH 7.4) at 

37°C; we supposed that degradation occurred by solubilization due to the presence of 

residual acetate molecules. 

Figure 11 shows the degradation profile of PCHTs.

PCHTs 3% (?80°C); and (?) PCHTs 3% (?196°C). 

We observed the highest weight loss, approximately 45%, for PCHT 1% (?20°C) 

after 7 days, while for PCHTs 2% (?20°C), 3% (?20°C), and 3% (?196°C) weight loss 

was approximately 35% after 3 days. The PCHTs 3% (?80°C) showed the lowest weight 

loss (~20%), probably due to their leaf structure retaining lower concentration of acetate 

molecules. 

Our results suggest that the PCHTs need further stabilization, to ensure the 

balance between tissue regeneration and degradation rate of the scaffold. 

 

3.3.2.3. Cell Compatibility 

Figure 12 shows the cell compatibility of h-AdMSCs cultured in the presence of 

PCHTs, as assayed by MTT. The results revealed no potential cytotoxicity in 24 hours 

for the scaffolds according to the standard values (PTC). 

However, we observed lower proliferation of h-AdMSCs on PCHTs prepared with 

chitosan concentration of 3% (w/v) compared to the negative control. 

Nevertheless, the PCHTs are potentially useful for in vivo applications regardless 

of CHT concentration and freezing conditions.

SEM characterization (Figure 13) of the ?P-PRP/PCHTs on the 5th day of culture 

showed fibrin networks covering the pores and surface of PCHTs, as a consequence of 

the interaction of fibrin fibers and CHT. This interaction supported cell proliferation by 

improving the mechanical strength of the fibrin network, in addition to providing 

additional surface area to cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation.

P-PRP was 472,250 pq/mm3. Activated P-PRP alone was used as control. 

 
The curves show diffusion profiles, indicating no collapse of the porous structure 

of chitosan scaffolds during the course of the assays, regardless of the CHT 

concentration and freezing conditions.  

PDGF-AB released from PCHTs ended within 24 hours of incubation, whereas 

TGF-?1 tended to continue after 72 hours. 

A controlled release of TGF-?1 and PDGF-AB was achieved for all CHT 

concentrations, related to the scaffolds of activated P-PRP only. The slowest release 

was observed for a chitosan concentration of 3%. 

In contrast, for the PCHTs 3% freezing at ?80°C and ?196°C, we observed a 

controlled release of TGF-?1, but a strong burst release of PDGF-AB. 

Thus, PCHTs prepared with 3% CHT at ?20°C provided a controlled release of 

PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 and can be an efficient vehicle for release of GFs from PRP.

(?) P-PRP activated with Ca+2/thrombin (control). The concentration of platelets in P-

PRP was 374,000 pq/mm3. Activated P-PRP alone was used as control. 

 

The cell number per well determined after 3 days exceeded the number of 

seeded cells (1.4 × 104 cells/well) in all the ?P-PRP/PCHTs, meaning that the cells kept 

in the matrices retained their viability, regardless of the CHT concentration and freezing 

conditions.  

The cell number per well of ?P-PRP/PCHTs prepared with 1, 2, and 3% (w/v) of 

chitosan [Figure 15(a)] showed significant differences (? &amp;lt;0.05) compared to control 

(?P-PRP). Therefore, PCHTs must have stabilized fibrin networks as we initially 

hypothesized.  

However, regarding freezing condition, no significant variations for ?P-

PRP/PCHTs prepared at ?80°C or ?196°C and ?P-PRP were observed [Figure 15(b)]. In 

all cases, cell viability decreased after 7 days, probably due to collapse of the structure. 

We also observed that the exponential phase of the cultures [Figure 15(a)] 



61 

 

started after the maximum release of GFs (Figure 14), and the decline phase matched 

the largest weight loss of the PCHTs (Figure 11). 

 

3.3.3.4. Induction of Osteogenic Differentiation 

Osteogenic differentiation of h-AdMSCs was investigated 14 days after cell 

seeding. ALP, an early marker of osteogenic differentiation, was determined, and the 

results are shown in Figure 16. The expression of ALP activity showed no significant 

difference (? &amp;lt;0.05) with CHT concentration. However, higher osteogenic differentiation 

was obtained with ?P-PRP/PCHTs 3% (?196°C).

Figure 16. ALP activities of cells cultured on ?P-PRP/PCHTs scaffolds prepared with 

different CHT concentrations and freezing conditions (statistically significant differences 

from blank, ? = 3, *? &amp;lt;0.05). Blank = the reagents used in the assay only. The 

concentration of platelets in whole blood donors (average of 2 donors) was 163,500 

pq/mm3. After preparation of the PRP, the platelets were concentrated approximately 

1.74 times, with an average final concentration of 303,000 pq/mm3. 

 

3.4. Conclusions 

 

Composite scaffolds were prepared with porous chitosan and ?-PRP. The 

performance of the composite scaffolds was superior to ?P-PRP alone, indicating that 

the porous chitosan stabilized the fibrin network, supporting our initial hypothesis. 



62 

 

Chitosan concentration and freezing conditions influenced the physicochemical and 

biological properties of the scaffolds. On the average, physicochemical, mechanical, and 

h-AdMSCs proliferation improved by the use of 3% (w/v) chitosan and ?20°C freezing 

temperature, while ?196°C favored osteogenic differentiation. Additional stabilization of 

the porous structure is needed for applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract. This study offers innovative perspectives for optimizing of scaffolds based on 

correlation structure-function aimed the regenerative medicine. Thus, we evaluated in 

vitro the performance of stabilized porous chitosan (SPCHTs) associated with activated 

platelet-rich plasma (aP-PRP) as a composite scaffold for the proliferation and 

osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-

AdMSCs). The porous structure of chitosan (PCHT) was prepared similarly to solid 

sponges by controlled freezing (-20°C) and lyophilization of a 3% (w/v) chitosan solution. 

Stabilization was performed by treating the PCHT with sodium hydroxide (TNaOH), an 

ethanol series (TEtOH) or by crosslinking with tripolyphosphate (CTPP). The aP-PRP 

was obtained from the controlled centrifugation of whole blood and activated with 

autologous serum and calcium. Imaging of the structures showed fibrin networks inside 

and on the surface of SPCHTs as a consequence of electrostatic interactions. SPCHTs 

were non-cytotoxic, and the porosity, pore size and Young’s modulus were

approximately 96%, 145 µm and 1.5 MPa for TNaOH and TEtOH and 94%, 110 µm and 

1.8 MPa for CTPP, respectively. Stabilization maintained the integrity of the SPCHTs for 

at least 10 days of cultivation. SPCHTs showed controlled release of the growth factors 

TGF-?1 and PDGF-AB. Although generating different patterns, all of the stabilization 

treatments improved the proliferation of seeded h-AdMSCs on the composite scaffold 

compared to aP-PRP alone, and differentiation of the composite scaffold treated with 

TEtOH was significantly higher than for non-stabilized PCHT. We conclude that the 

stabilized of porous chitosan scaffolds improved the in vitro performance of PRP and 

have potential in regenerative medicine.

4.1. Introduction 
 

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product from whole blood (WB) 

comprised primarily of a high concentration of platelets dispersed in plasma (P-PRP) but 

that can also include concentrated leukocytes (L-PRP) (Ehrenfest et al., 2009). 

Currently, PRP therapy has been used in various medical specialties and has been 

responsible for several successful outcomes. Various clinical uses including sports 

medicine, orthopedics and the recovery of musculoskeletal injuries have been reported 

recently (Lana et al., 2014). 

Activated PRP (aPRP) releases growth factors (GFs) and various cytokines from 

platelets and leukocytes as well as stimulating the decomposition of fibrinogen in fibrin 

fibers, which arrange themselves in a network structure that supports cell proliferation 

and differentiation (Marx, 2004). Therefore, tissue repair occurs from a cascade of 

multiple reactions mediated by GFs (Jacobson et al., 2008), in which cytokines play an 

important role (Kanaji et al., 2011). 

Preparation of PRP first involves the separation of red blood cells and the 

concentration of platelets and other components of WB. Usually, separation is 

performed by centrifugation, and activation is promoted by thrombin and calcium. 



71 

 

Adequate centrifugation conditions and multiple spins must be used to obtain a high 

yield of platelets and preserve integrity (Perez et al., 2013). The architecture of the fibrin 

network is determined by the activation conditions (Perez et al., 2014) and plays an 

important role in GF release and cell proliferation.  

Crane &amp;amp; Everts (2008) described tissue regeneration based on the triangle of 

proliferation, which represents cooperation between genic, conductive and inductive 

capabilities, using the cells, scaffold and GFs as basic elements. PRP is beneficial to 

tissue regeneration because it acts as an inducer and conductive matrix (scaffold) for 

cell proliferation. Furthermore, aPRP influences the paracrine activity of mesenchymal 

cells (MSCs), which is an important mechanism determining their efficacy in 

regenerative therapies (Liu et al., 2002; Hom et al., 2007). 

In regenerative PRP therapies, we would consider first generation therapies to be 

PRP alone, followed by the second generation of PRP associated with bone marrow 

cells, and finally a third generation using PRP and h-AdMSCs. However, the 

performance of the fibrin network as a scaffold in regeneration requires further attention. 

Structural stability is an important issue because MSCs needs the maintenance of a 3-

dimensional fibrin architecture for proliferation, migration and differentiation.  

Some of the available literature suggests that the association of PRP with 

chitosan is beneficial to osteogenic regeneration (Ouyang et al., 2013; Rossi et al., 

2013; Kutlu et al., 2013; Bi et al., 2010; Oktay et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2009; Shen et 

al., 2006; Kojima et al., 2004; Okamoto et al., 2003). 

In our previous studies, we observed the association of aP-PRP with PCHTs 

controlled the release of GFs and also improved the in vitro proliferation and 

differentiation of h-AdMSCs compared to aP-PRP only. However, the PCHTs collapsed 

after five days of cell cultivation and required stabilization.  

Porous chitosan scaffolds are produced primarily by a freezing process, which 

provides the nucleation of ice crystals from solution and further growth along the lines of 

thermal gradients. Exclusion of the chitosan acetate salt from the ice crystal phase and 

subsequent ice removal by lyophilization generates a porous material. After freeze-

drying, the acetate molecules are in solid form in the scaffold cavities as ions bound to 

the cationic amine groups in the chitosan. When the acetate is not removed or 



72 

 

neutralized, the scaffold will swell rapidly and ultimately dissolve upon rehydration in a 

neutral aqueous medium, requiring stabilization of the scaffold.  

Stabilization using multiple methods has been studied, including rehydration and/ 

or crosslinking (Shen et al., 2000), immersion in sodium hydroxide (Madihally &amp;amp; Mathew, 

1999; Manjubala et al., 2006), tripolyphosphate (Seol et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2000) and/ 

or an ethanol series (Nwe et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2008). Neutralization with NaOH 

removes acid remnants and regenerates the NH2 groups on the chitosan, yielding a 

hydrophilic surface. The stabilization occurs by inhibition of the repulsion between 

chitosan chains and the formation of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and 

chitosan crystallites (Noriega &amp;amp; Subramanian, 2011). An adequate NaOH concentration 

must be applied to maintain the shape and volume of the chitosan scaffold during the 

cell culture period (Nwe et al., 2009). 

Stabilization with an ethanol series occurs because CHT decreases in solubility 

as the polarity of mixed solvents decreases, and affects not only the solubility of CHT 

but also the elasticity of the hydrogel (Sano et al., 1999). 

Cationic chitosan can be crosslinked by multivalent counterions such as 

tripolyphosphate to form an intermolecular and/or intramolecular network structure. The 

reactions occurs through the ionic interaction between the NH3+ protonated groups of 

chitosan and the negatively charged counterions of TPP, including the OH- and P3O105- 

ions coexisting in the TPP solution (Bhumkar &amp;amp; Pokharkar, 2006). 

In this work, we extended previous findings by studying the effects of PCHT 

stabilization on the performance of the composite scaffold aP-PRP/SPCHT. Stabilization 

was performed by treating PCHT with sodium hydroxide (TNaOH), an ethanol series 

(TEtOH) or by crosslinking with tripolyphosphate (CTPP). The in vitro performance of 

the composite scaffolds was evaluated based on physicochemical and biological 

properties, and these results are important to optimize composite scaffolds for use in 

implants or for wound healing.  

 

4.2. Materials and Methods 
 



73 

 

4.2.1. Materials 

Chitosan (average molecular weight [Mw] = 4 x 105 Da, degree of deacetylation = 

83 ± 4%) was purchased from Polymar® (Fortaleza, CE, Brazil) and purified according 

to a protocol described by Nasti et al. (2009). Other chemicals were reagent grade and 

were used without any further purification. PRP was prepared from whole blood (WB) of 

donors, who were healthy individuals aged between 30 and 40 years old and previously 

assessed through their clinical examinations. The human adipose tissue-derived 

mesenchymal stem cells, h-AdMSCs, were provided by Umbilical Cord Blood Bank of 

Haematology and Hemotherapy Center of University of Campinas. All biological 

experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Sciences School of 

the University of Campinas (UNICAMP; CAAE: 0972.0.146.000-11). 

 

4.2.2. Methods 

4.2.2.1. Preparation of porous chitosan (PCHT) 

PCHT was prepared from a chitosan solution 3% (w/v) prepared by dissolving 

chitosan in 0.2 mol.L-1 acetic acid. To obtain a cylindrical shape, the solution was added 

to the wells of a 24 well culture plate (TPP®, polystyrene, diameter=15.4 mm). The 

sponge-like porous structure was generated by freezing at -20°C for 24 hours and 

lyophilizing in a lyophilizer Liobras L101 (Liobras, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) at a 

temperature of approximately -30°C for 48 hours.  

 

4.2.2.2. Stabilization of PCHT  

PCHT was stabilized by treatment with dilute NaOH (TNaOH), an ethanol series 

(TEtOH) or by crosslinking with tripolyphosphate (CTPP) (Madihally &amp;amp; Matthew, 1999). 

All of these treatments began with the slow immersion of PCTS in specific aqueous 

solutions, some of which were followed by washing. For TNaOH, 0.05 mol.L-1 NaOH 

solution was used, and the PCHT was equilibrated for ~10 min and then washed twice 

with water and twice with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). TEtOH treatment was 

performed by immersing the PCHT in absolute ethanol for ~1 h, then immersing 

sequentially in 70% and 50% (v/v)  ethanol for ~30 min each. For CTPP treatment, the 



74 

 

PCHT was immersed in 5% (w/v) TPP solution, equilibrated for ~2 h and then washed 

twice with water and twice with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). The final mass ratio 

in the stabilized scaffold of CHT/TPP was 2:1. The stabilized PCHT (SPCHTs) were 

frozen at -20°C and lyophilized at a temperature of approximately -30°C for 48 hours 

again.  

 

4.2.3. Characterization of SPCHTs 

4.2.3.1. Chemical modification 

Infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) was used to identify the chemical modifications in 

the SPCHT scaffolds. Infrared spectra of PCHTs were obtained using an Infrared 

Spectrometer Fourier Transform (FT-IR) Thermo Scientific Nicolet Model 6700 (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in the spectral range of 4000–675 cm-1. 

Measurements were made in ATR mode with the SMART OMNI-SAMPLER accessory 

in the spectral range between 4000-675 cm-1 at a resolution of 4 cm-1 and 64 scans. 

ATR-IR(chitosan): 3500–3000 (? OH and NH2), 2875 (?CH), 1645 (amide I), 1550 (amide II) 

1380, 1067, 1020 cm?1 (Nasti et al., 2009). 

 

4.2.3.2. Morphology and pore size 

The morphology of the SPCHTs was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM) using a LEO 440i Electron Microscopy/Oxford (Cambridge, England) operated at 

5 kV accelerating voltage The scaffolds were gold-coated using a sputter coater 

POLARON SC7620, VG Microtech (Uckfield, England) for 180 s at a current of 3 mA. 

Pore size (n=20) was measured using an Image J 1.47t.  

 

4.2.3.3. Swelling profile 

The swelling profile in function of time of the SPCHTs was determined by swelling 

freeze-dried scaffolds of known weight in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (LB 

Laborclin, Pinhais, PR, Brazil) at pH 7.4 and 37°C. The swelling ratio (SR) was 

calculated using Equation (1):

in which ?s and ?d are the weights of the scaffolds at the swelling state and the dry 

state, respectively. 

4.2.3.4. Porosity 

Porosity (?) of the SPCHTs was measured according to the protocol used by 

Wang et al. (2003), and calculated using Equation (2):  

 

? (%) =

in which ?m is the total volume of CHT scaffolds (cm3), ? is the density of the non-porous 

chitosan scaffold (1.342 g/cm3) and ?m is the weight of scaffold (g). Values are 

expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (n=3). 

 

4.2.3.5. Mechanical resistance 

Mechanical compression tests of the SPCHTs (n=3) were performed using a 

Universal Testing Machine, MTS model 810-Flex Test 40 (MTS Systems Corporation, 

Eden Prairie, MN, USA) at up to 60% of strain, according to Correia et al. (2011). The 

testing machine was equipped with a 1.5 kN load cell, and the loading rate was 5 

mm/min. The Young’s modulus was calculated in the initial linear section of the stress–

strain curve, when the strain was lower than 10%.  

 

4.2.3.6. Degradation in phosphate buffered saline 

Degradation of SPCHTs was examined by the weight loss of previously weighed 

SPCHTs (?o), which was monitored as a function of incubation time in PBS at 37°C. At 

specified time intervals, PCHTs were removed from the PBS and weighed (?t). The 

weight loss ratio is defined in Equation (3) (Tan et al., 2009).

76 

 

4.2.3.7. Cell compatibility 

The compatibility of the SPCHTs was performed by exposing h-AdMSCs to 

SPCHTs followed by cultivation at 37°C for 24 hours and evaluation by MTT (3-[4,5-

dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (MTT, Molecular Probes), 

according to a modified Mosmann method (1983). The MTT assay is a colorimetric test 

based on the reduction of yellow tetrazolium salt into a purple formazan product in the 

presence of cells (Gümü?derelio?lu &amp;amp; Aday, 2011). 

 

4.2.4. Preparation of pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) 

P-PRP, which is rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes, was prepared according 

to Perez et al. 2013. Briefly, whole blood (WB) was collected in 3.5 mL vacuum tubes 

(Vacuette®, Campinas, SP, Brazil) containing sodium citrate 3.2% (w/v) as an 

anticoagulant. WB was initially centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge (Hettich® 

Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 100xg for 10 minutes at 25ºC. After the formation 

of three layers: a bottom layer of red blood cells (RBCs); an upper layer of plasma, 

platelets and some WBCs; and an intermediate layer, or buffy coat, composed mostly of 

WBCs; only the upper layer was collected as P-PRP. The concentration of platelets, 

WBCs and RBCs in WB and P-PRP was determined using the ABX Micros ES 60 

hematology analyzer (HORIBA ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier, France). 

 

4.2.5. Preparation of activated P-PRP (aP-PRP) 

aP-PRP was prepared by activation of P-PRP using autologous serum (Ser) and 

10% (w/v) CaCl2 solution as agonists in the following proportions: agonist/P-PRP=20% 

(v/v); Ser/CaCl2 volumetric ratio=9. Autologous serum was prepared by collecting 5 mL 

of WB in tubes without anticoagulant. After 30 minutes of clot formation, WB was 

centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 minutes (Perez et al., 2014).  

 

4.2.6. Preparation of composite scaffold (aP-PRP/SPCHTs) 

aP-PRP/SPCHTs were prepared by dripping aP-PRP, immediately after 

activation, onto SPCHTs. The preparation was carried out in 48-well microplates using 



77 

 

200 µL of aP-PRP/10-20 mg of PCHTs. 

 

4.2.7. h-AdMSCs isolation and pre-cultivation 

Human subcutaneous adipose tissue initially acquired from liposuction surgery 

was washed with sterile PBS, separated into 10 g samples, digested with 20 mg of 

collagenase type 1A and maintained in 20 mL of DMEM-LG containing 10% bovine 

serum albumin (BSA) and 10 µL of gentamicin for 30 min in a 37°C bath. After complete 

digestion, the reaction was quenched with 10 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 

immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and 

the pellet was suspended in 10 mL DMEM-LG with 10% FBS. After pre-cultivation for 24 

h, the culture medium was changed every 3 days and after the fourth passage, the cells 

were characterized by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry and adipogenic, 

osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation (data not shown), then were used in the 

subsequent experiments. 

 

4.2.8. h-AdMSCs-seeding in the composite scaffolds 

The pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were trypsinized and re-suspended in P-PRP to a 

final cell concentration of 1 x 104 cells/ mL. P-PRP containing h-AdMSCs was activated 

and immediately embedded in the SPCHTs in a 24-well tissue culture plate using 200 µL 

of h-AdMSCs+aP-PRP/10-20 mg of SPCHTs. The composite scaffolds seeded were 

with h-AdMSCs and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes for the consolidation 

of the fibrin network. aP-PRP was used as the control.  

 

4.2.9. Characterization of the composite scaffold  

4.2.9.1. Release of GFs 

The release of platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) and transforming 

growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) was assessed after 1 hour gelation of aP-PRP associated to 

SPCHTs in the presence of the culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium 

(DMEM-LG) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) with low glucose concentration). The 

culture medium (1.5 mL) was added to aP-PRP/SPCHTs in 48 well microplates, which 



78 

 

were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 for the duration of the assays. The total 

volume of culture medium was removed at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 72 hours, and the same 

volume of fresh medium was replaced without removing the hydrogels from the wells. 

The samples were stored at -80ºC for further characterization. The concentration of the 

released GFs PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 were measured using enzyme-linked 

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to 

the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications.  

 

4.2.9.2. Images of the cell-seeded composite scaffolds 

The images of cell-seeded composite scaffolds were obtained by scanning 

electron microscopy after 5 days of h-AdMSCs proliferation. The cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 

phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 hours. The samples were then dehydrated in ethanol for 

15 min intervals in aqueous 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions (2x) and dried 

at the critical point dryer BAL-TEC CPD 030 (Schalksmühle, Germany). After gold 

coating (Sputter Coater POLARON, SC7620, VG Microtech), the cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were visualized with a scanning electron microscope (Leo 440i LEO) with an 

accelerating voltage of 20 kV. 

 

4.2.9.3. h-AdMSCs proliferation 

The cultivation of h-AdMSCs was performed in 24-well tissue culture plates by 

adding 1 mL of the DMEM culture medium to the seeded composite scaffolds (n=4) and 

controlling the temperature at 37°C for 10 days. Cell proliferation was quantified by MTT 

assay. After 3, 5, 7 and 10 days of cultivation, the composite scaffolds were removed 

and transferred to 24-well plates. Then, MTT (1 mL of 1 mg/mL) was added, and the 

cultivation proceeded at 37°C for 4 hours. The MTT solution was discarded, and 1 mL of 

DMSO was added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The samples were shaken 

at 120 rpm for 30 min to ensure homogeneous dissolution of the formazan dye, and then 

200 µL of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. The optical density was 

measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (FilterMax F5 Molecular Devices).  

 



79 

 

4.2.9.4. Induction of osteogenic differentiation 

h-AdMSCs-seeded in the composite scaffolds were induced to differentiate into 

the osteogenic lineage by providing osteogenic medium containing DMEM-LG 

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% ?-glycerol-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 

USA), 1% L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% dexamethasone 

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin solution (Gibco, 

Grand Island, NY, USA). The medium was changed every 7 days.  

 

4.2.9.5. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) 

The level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in h-AdMSCs was determined on 

day 14. The supernatant (200 ?L) was collected and mixed with 200 ?L of the substrate 

p-nitrophenyl phosphate (SIGMAFAST™ p-nitrophenyl phosphate tablets, Sigma, Saint 

Louis, MI, USA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Absorbance was 

read immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm. 

 

4.2.10. Statistical analysis 

Each experiment was performed in triplicate unless otherwise specified. All of the 

results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The experimental data 

from all of the studies were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistical 

significance was set to p-value ? 0.05. 

 

4.3. Results and discussion 
 

4.3.1. Modifications and surface chemistry  

The FTIR spectra of the SPCHTs from the various treatments is shown in Figure 

17. The FTIR spectra of non-treated scaffolds (NTPCHTs) were included as controls. 

FTIR spectra of SPCHTs/TNaOH and SPCHTs/TEtOH showed no significant 

modification of the chemical structure of chitosan compared to the NTPCHTs, which 

showed peaks at 1550 cm?1 and 1400 cm?1 corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric 

carboxylate ion stretching, characteristic of the presence of acetate ions in the chitosan 



80 

 

acetate salt and suggesting incomplete deacetylation of chitosan (Noriega &amp;amp; 

Subramanian, 2011; Demarger-Andre &amp;amp; Domard, 1994). Therefore, the chemical groups 

of SPCHTs/TNaOH and SPCHTs/TEtOH exposed to PRP and h-AdMSCs during in vitro 

assays are –NH3+ and –OH from the chitosan chain, which favor osteoblast 

differentiation (Chang &amp;amp; Wang, 2011). 

The formation of an intermolecular complex between the–NH3+ group of chitosan 

and the P3O10-5 of TPP in the SPCHTs/CTPP was characterized by the presence of the 

P=O and P-O groups at the frequencies of 1100 cm-1 and 1232 cm-1, respectively (Mi et 

al., 1999). In this case, the crosslinking decreased the positive charge on the chitosan 

exposed to PRP and h-AdMSCs during the in vitro assays. However, there is increased 

scaffold hydrophilicity due to the presence of –OH and P=O groups from TPP that favor 

cell spreading, proliferation and differentiation (Chang &amp;amp; Wang, 2011). 

Thus, the stabilized scaffolds prepared in this work show chemical surfaces 

favorable for cell processes required for tissue regeneration as well as being suitable for 

the adhesion and support of the fibrin network from PRP, which has a negative charge.

4.3.2. Physicochemical and mechanical properties of SPCHTs 

In addition to surface chemistry, physicochemical and mechanical properties such 

as porous structure, Young’s modulus, swelling and degradation over time play 

important roles in the performance of scaffolds. It is known that the microstructural 



81 

 

characteristics such as pore size and distribution, porosity and pore shape have 

prominent influences on cell intrusion, proliferation and function in tissue engineering 

(Ma et al., 2003). When PRP is associated, the microstructure might also induce 

activation as well as support the fibrin network on the internal and external surfaces. 

These properties in conjunction are shown in Figure 18, for an easier comparison of the 

SPCHTs. 

The micrographs obtained by SEM [Figure 18(a)] showed three-dimensional 

structures with visually interconnected pores in all cases. Scaffolds with open and 

interconnected pores are essential for cell nutrition, proliferation and migration 

promoting the vascularization and formation of new tissues (Loh &amp;amp; Choong, 2013). 

However, the surface chemistry provided by the treatments produced significant 

differences in the scaffolds.  

The Young’s modulus values [Figure 18(b)] were similar for SPCHT/TNaOH and 

SPCHT/TEtOH, approximately 1.4 MPa, but significantly larger than NTPCHTs (1.1 

MPa). SPCHT/CTPP exhibited the highest mechanical resistance (1.8 MPa) due to the 

physical crosslinking, as expected. 

Regardless of the type of treatment, the mean pore diameter [Figure 18(b)] could 

be controlled around 100-200 µm. Ti?li et al. (2007) also obtained a pore size in the 

range of 100 µm. Although controversial, several researchers have suggested optimal 

pore structures for the regeneration of specific tissues. Pore sizes of 100–400 µm and 

200–350 µm have been suggested for bone tissue regeneration and osteoconduction, 

respectively (Oh et al., 2007). 

The smallest pores from TPP treatment are from crosslinking and entanglement 

of the chains of chitosan.  

According to Ma et al. (2003), an additional freeze-drying can induce the fusion of 

some smaller pores to generate larger ones, or the slight collapse of the scaffold of the 

structure might reduce pore size. Therefore, in our scaffolds, the collapse effect was 

more prominent than fusion because the pores were smaller for all treatments. In 

addition, this effect seemed to be homogeneous in the structures.  

According to Liu &amp;amp; Ma (2004), high porosity of scaffolds (such as ? 90%) is 

important for any tissue engineering applications, including bone. 



82 

 

Porosity was similar for SPCHT/TNaOH and NTPCHT. A significant reduction in 

porosity and pore size was observed after rehydration and new lyophilization for 

SPCHT/CTPP. Final porosities were in the range of 93-97% [Figure 18(c)]. These 

values agree with those reported by Amaral et al. (2006) for similar scaffolds.  

The water uptake property of the raw materials primarily influences the 

maintenance of the chitosan scaffolds’ shape. Deformations in the structure affect cell 

proliferation and migration. The SPCHTs/TNaOH and SPCHTs/TEtOH [Figure 18(d)] 

exhibited rapid swelling in PBS pH 7.4 within 5 minutes. After 24 h their SR values were 

11 ± 1 and 14 ± 3, respectively, indicating extremely hydrophilic structures with the 

capacity to accommodate in their 3D structure large amounts of saline solution. 

SPCHTs/CTPP showed smaller SR in 24 hours (5.9 ± 0.4) because the crosslinking that 

reduces the functional groups that hydrogen bond with water and decreased the pore 

size and porosity. NTPCHT rehydrated in a neutral aqueous medium after 24 hours of 

rapid swelling and ultimately dissolved, indicating that the lyophilized structure was 

composed of soluble chitosan acetate. 

The swelling was stabilized after 7.5 hours and increased in the following order: 

SPCHTs/TEtOH&gt; SPCHTs/TNaOH&gt; SPCHTs/CTPP. It was not possible to measure the 

swelling of NTCHTs after 7 days due to the fragility of its structure. 

Degradation profiles were similar over 30 days. These results indicated that the 

treatments reduced the solubility of chitosan, providing stability to the scaffolds 

compared to NTCHTs. The high weight loss (approximately 40%) of SPCHTs/TNaOH 

and SPCHTs/TEtOH likely occurs due to the presence of residual chitosan acetate that 

can cause rapid swelling and subsequently dissolution in a neutral aqueous medium.  

Both processes, degradation and swelling, occur simultaneously and compete 

with other.

The freeze-drying technique limits the pores to medium sizes and the mechanical 

properties of the porous structures even after cross-linking (Costa-Pinto et al., 2011). 

Therefore, the physicochemical characterization suggests that the SPCHTs might 

* 

* 



85 

 

be useful for bone regeneration. Stabilization provided pore sizes in the range of 100-

150 µm and porosities higher than 90%. In addition, they prevented the collapse of the 

structures after at least 10 days in PBS at pH 7.4 with swelling capacity. However, 

mechanical resistance was low, requiring further treatments for application in regions 

exposed to high shear. 

 

4.3.3. Biological properties of SPCHTs 

SEM characterization [Figure 19(a)] of the aP-PRP/PCHTs composite scaffolds 

after 5th days of culture indicated cell attachment and a fibrin network inside the pores 

and on the surface of SPCHTs. aP-PRP was used as control. 

The cell compatibility, as assayed by MTT, of h-AdMSCs cultured in the presence 

of SPCHTs is shown in [Figure 19(b)]. This assay is widely used to determine cellular 

toxicity, viability and proliferation (Gümü?derelioglu &amp;amp; Aday, 2011). The results revealed 

no potential cytotoxicity over 24 hours for the SPCHTs according to the standard values 

(PCT). However, we observe reduced viability compared to the negative control toxicity 

(NCT) for SPCHTs/TNaOH and SPCHTs/CTPP.

showed that the number of viable cells determined after 3 days exceeded the number of 

seeded cells (1.4 x 104 cells/well) in all of the composite scaffolds, indicating that the 

cells grown in the matrices retained their viability, regardless of the treatment. The 

results also indicated cell proliferation was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) for the aP-

PRP/SPCHTs compared to the control aP-PRP. Cultivation in aP-PRP/SPCHTs/TNaOH 

showed faster cell proliferation, and the stationary phase was reached in 5th days, 

whereas for aP-PRP/SPCHTs/CTPP the proliferation shows a nearly linear increasing 

profile. In aP-PRP/SPCHTs/TEtOH, the cells had a longer lag phase (5 days) followed 

by an exponential phase in the subsequent period.  

TEtOH has the added advantage of allowing direct sterilization of samples in 70% 

ethanol; however, after treatment, the scaffolds should be equilibrated with culture 

medium or PBS for several hours prior to any cell seeding or in vivo implantation activity 

(Oh et al., 2007).  

Cultivation in aP-PRP/NTPCHT reached the exponential phase in 5th days and 

decreased sharply afterward due to the collapse of the non-stabilized structure.  

The curves of Figure 19(d) and 19(e) show PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 release 

kinetics from aP-PRP/SPCHTs with aP-PRP and aP-PRP/NTPCHTs used as controls. 

The curves show diffusive controlled profiles, indicating no collapse of the porous 

structure of chitosan scaffolds over the duration of the assays. The differences in the 

profiles are due to interactions of the GFs with the surface groups generated by the 

various stabilizing treatments.  

The ALP activity of h-AdMSCs assayed after 14 days of cultivation is shown in 

Figure 19(f). The ALP activity of the cells cultured on aP-PRP/SPCHTs and aP-

PRP/NTPCHTs scaffolds showed significant differences from the control (p&lt;0.05), 

suggesting that the composite scaffolds favored osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, 

the differentiation of the composite scaffold treated with TEtOH was significantly higher 

than for non-stabilized PCHT. 

 

4.4. Conclusions 
 

Composite scaffolds of stabilized porous chitosan and activated P-PRP were 



89 

 

prepared and characterized. The stabilization of the porous chitosan was accomplished 

by using various treatments. In general, the composite scaffolds controlled the release 

of growth factors and improved proliferation of h-AdMSCs that were seeded compared 

to activated P-PRP. Osteogenic differentiation evaluated by ALP marker was favored by 

the stabilization provided mainly by the ethanol series treatment. These findings are 

important for optimizing composite scaffolds for applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro biological effectiveness of chitosan-

sodium tripolyphosphate microparticles in combination with activated platelet-rich 

plasma as an injectable composite scaffold for growth factor release, cell proliferation 

and osteogenic differentiation. The microparticles were prepared by vortexing the 

chitosan and TPP solutions. The ionic crosslinking of chitosan with TPP was made at 

mass ratios of 2:1, 5:1, and 10:1 at pH 4.0. Pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) was 

obtained via the controlled centrifugation of whole blood. The composite scaffolds were 

prepared by adding the microparticles to immediately activated P-PRP. The results 

showed that the microparticles enhanced the physicochemical and mechanical 

properties of aP-PRP. The proliferation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem 

cells was lower than in aP-PRP but significant at a 2:1 chitosan:TPP mass ratio.

Osteogenic differentiation was stimulated at all studied mass ratios, as indicated by the 

ALP activity. These results offer perspectives for optimizing the composite scaffold, and 

to prove its potential as an injectable scaffold in regenerative medicine.

5.1. Introduction 
 

Due to their minimally invasive implantation procedures, injectable scaffolds have 

being widely investigated and are considered promising in tissue engineering (Kretlow et 

al., 2007). 

From the clinical perspective, the use of injectable scaffolds is advantageous 

because it minimizes patient discomfort, the risk of infection and scarring, and the cost 

of treatment (Hou et al., 2004). Furthermore, injectable scaffolds can homogeneously fill 

the defect or repair point and can incorporate cells and various therapeutic agents such 

as growth factors prior to injection (Gutowska et al., 2001).  

From the biomaterial perspective, adequate injectable scaffolds must be nontoxic, 

biodegradable, and sterilizable. Moreover, they must solidify under mild conditions, 

show mechanical strength and resistance to in situ forces and allow for the incorporation 

of bioactive molecules. 

Various types of biodegradable materials have been proposed for the preparation 

of injectable scaffolds used in tissue engineering. Considerable attention has been given 

to chitosan-based materials, primarily due to their similarities with the extracellular 

matrix, chemical versatility, good biological performance, and specific cellular 

interactions (Costa-Pinto et al., 2011).  

Chitosan scaffolds has been prepared as hydrogels by physical association 

(Berger et al., 2004), coordination with metal ions (Brack et al., 1997) and chemical 

crosslinking (Hennink &amp;amp; Van Nodtrum, 2002). However, the use of chemical crosslinking 

agents are a major obstacle to scaffolds fluids due to their toxicity to the cells. Thus, 

tripolyphosphate (TPP) and genipin have become attractive alternatives to chitosan 



97 

 

crosslinking (Bhumkar &amp;amp; Pokharkar, 2006; Ibezim et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2010; 

Karnchanajindanun et al., 2010).  

The electrostatic interaction between chitosan and TPP leads to the formation of 

biocompatible crosslinked chitosan hydrogels, which could be used as injectable 

scaffolds in micro- and/or nanoparticles in non-surgical treatments.  

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous concentrate of platelets and other 

components of plasma that is capable of releasing the growth factors and cytokines 

used in tissue regeneration (Anitua, 1999; Foster et al., 2009). PRP has been 

successfully used in regenerative medicine (Crane &amp;amp; Everts, 2008; Cole et al., 2010). 

When activated, aP-PRP produces a fibrin network with a gel-like structure that 

supports cell proliferation and differentiation (Marx, 2004). Efforts have been made to 

improve the stability and rheological properties of the fibrin network. 

In our previous studies, we have shown that porous chitosan sponges stabilized 

by crosslinking with TPP had adequate physicochemical properties for tissue 

engineering uses. Moreover, in combination with aP-PRP, the sponges supported the 

fibrin network, increased its stability, delayed the release of PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 

compared to aP-PRP alone, and allowed the proliferation and differentiation of h-

AdMSCs.  

 In the present work, we extended our previous findings by evaluating the 

performance of the combination of chitosan microparticles and activated P-PRP as a 

composite scaffold. Our hypothesis is that the crosslinked microparticles will also 

improve the properties of aP-PRP alone, with the benefits of an injectable formulation. 

 

5.2. Materials and Methods 

 

5.2.1. Materials 

Chitosan (average molecular weight [Mw] = 4 x 105 Da, degree of deacetylation = 

83 ± 4%) was purchased from Polymar® (Fortaleza, Brazil) and purified according to the 

protocol described by Nasti et al. (2009). Other chemicals were reagent grade and were 

used without any further purification. All biological experiments were performed with 

human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs) and approved by the 



98 

 

Ethics Committee of the Medical Sciences School of the University of Campinas 

(UNICAMP; CAAE: 0972.0.146.000-11). The donors were healthy individuals between 

30 and 40 years old and were previously assessed through their clinical examinations. 

 

5.2.2. Preparation of injectable scaffolds of chitosan-sodium 

tripolyphosphate (iCHT-TPPs) 

The injectable scaffolds (iCHT-TPPs) prepared in this work are composed of 

hydrogels of chitosan microparticles that were ionically crosslinked with TPP. Initially, a 

chitosan solution 2.5% (w/v) was prepared by dissolution in acetic acid 5% (w/v). TPP 

solution was prepared as a 5% (w/v) solution in Milli-Q water. The solutions were mixed 

at mass ratios CHT-TPP of 2:1, 5:1 and 10:1 and vortexed for 5 minutes to obtain the 

microparticles. The crosslinking was carried out at 25°C for 24 hours at pH 4. The 

hydrogels were washed three times with water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (LB 

Laborclin, Pinhais, PR, Brazil) at pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. 

 

5.2.3. Physicochemical Characterization  

5.2.3.1. Chemical modification.  

The ionic crosslinking was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) in a 

Thermo Scientific Nicolet model 6700 (Thermo Scientific Nicolet™, Waltham, MA, USA). 

Measurements were made in the ATR mode with accessory SMART OMNI-SAMPLER, 

in the spectral range of 4000-675 cm-1 resolution of 4 cm-1 and 64 scans. Pure chitosan 

was used as control. 

ATR-IR (chitosan): 3500–3000 (? OH and NH2), 2875 (?CH), 1645 (amide I), 

1550 (amide II) 1380, 1067, 1020 cm?1 (Nasti et al., 2009). 

 

5.2.3.2. Crosslink density Flory-Rehner calculations.  

Crosslink density was evaluated by measuring the volumetric swelling and using 

a simplified version of the Flory-Rehner equation (Flory &amp;amp; Rehner, 1943), according to 

Collins &amp;amp; Birkinshaw (2008). The value used for chitosan–water interaction parameter 

(?) was 0.5917 (Jin &amp;amp; Song, 2006). 



99 

 

 

5.2.3.3. Particle diameter measurements 

The mean diameter of the particles was evaluated by laser light scattering in a 

Mastersizer S particle size analyzer, model Long Bench-MAM 5005 (Malvern 

Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). The particle size analysis was performed with the 

hydrogels dispersed in water. The standard deviation was calculated from five 

measurements of the mean diameter. 

 

5.2.3.4. Rheology measurements.  

Rheological measurements were performed in steady and oscillatory regimes at 

25°C, using a parallel plate geometry of 20 mm. Steady shear measurements were 

obtained at shear rates of 0.1-50 s-1. Oscillatory measurements were conducted in the 

linear region, at a stress of 1.188 Pa and in the frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz. All 

rheological measurements were performed on a rheometer Haake RheoStress 1 

(Haake, Karlsruhe, Germany).  

 

5.2.3.5. Extrusion force.  

Initially the iCHT-TPPs were loaded in 1-mL plastic syringes with 30-gauge 

needles. Subsequently, the force required to extrude was measured using a MTS 810 

Servo-hydraulic Universal Testing Machine (MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, 

MN, USA) (Load Cell 1.5 kN) at 25°C at a 5.0 mm/ min extrusion rate. 

 

5.2.3.6. Swelling ratio (SR).  

The microparticles were weighed after swelling in phosphate buffered saline 

(PBS) at pH 7.4, and their dry weight was determined by drying under vacuum (1 

mmHg) at 25°C after 3 days. SR was calculated using the Equation (1): 

 

SR =  
ws

wd
                                                                                                            Equation (1) 

 

where ws and wd are the weights of the scaffolds at the swelling state and the dry state, 



100 

 

respectively. 

5.2.3.7. Degradation in phosphate buffered saline.  

The degradation of iCHT-TPPs was examined with respect to weight loss. The 

weight loss of the initially weighed iCHT-TPPs (wo) was monitored as a function of 

incubation time in PBS at 37°C. At specified time intervals, iCHT-TPPs were removed 

from the PBS and weighed (wt). The weight loss ratio was defined as in Equation (2) 

(Tan et al., 2009). 

 

weight loss (%) =
(w0?wt)

w0
? 100                                                                        Equation (2) 

 

5.2.4. Biological characterization 

5.2.4.1. Cell compatibility.  

The compatibility of the iCHT-TPPs was carried out by exposure to h-AdMSCs 

and cultivation at 37°C for 24 hours. The cell compatibility was evaluated using a 

modified MTT (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay 

(MTT, Molecular Probes®, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) (Mossmam, 1983). The MTT assay is 

a colorimetric test that is based on the reduction of yellow tetrazolium salt into a purple 

formazan product in presence of cells (Gümü?derelio?lu &amp;amp; Aday, 2011).  

 

5.2.5. Preparation of pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) 

P-PRP, a PRP type that is rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes, was prepared 

according to Perez et al. (2013). Briefly, whole blood (WB) was collected into 3.5 mL 

vacuum tubes (Vacuette®, Campinas, SP, Brazil) containing sodium citrate 3.2% (w/v) 

as an anticoagulant. WB was initially centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge (Hettich® 

Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 100 xg for 10 minutes at 25°C. After the formation 

of three layers (a bottom layer composed primarily of red blood cells (RBCs); an upper 

layer composed of plasma, platelets and some WBCs; and an intermediate layer, or 

buffy coat, composed primarily of WBCs), only the upper layer was collected to obtain P-

PRP. The concentrations of platelets, WBCs and RBCs in WB and in P-PRP were 

determined using the ABX Micros ES 60 hematology analyzer (HORIBA ABX 



101 

 

Diagnostics, Montpellier, France). 

5.2.5.1. Activation of P-PRP (aP-PRP) 

aP-PRP was prepared via the activation of P-PRP with autologous serum (Ser) 

and 10% (w/v) CaCl2 solution as agonists using the following proportions: agonist/P-

PRP=20%; Ser/CaCl2 volumetric ratio=9. Autologous serum was prepared by collecting 

5 mL of WB in tubes without anticoagulant. After 30 minutes of clot formation, WB was 

centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 minutes.  

 

5.2.6. Preparation of composite scaffold (aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs) 

aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs was prepared by embedding by dripping aP-PRP, 

immediately after activation, into iCHT-TPPs. The preparation was carried out in 48-well 

microplates using 200 µL of aP-PRP/ 100-200 mg of iCHT-TPPs. 

 

5.2.7. Characterization of aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs 
 

5.2.7.1. Release of GFs 

The release of platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) and transforming 

growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) was performed after a 1 hour gelation of aP-PRP associated 

to iCHT-TPPs in the presence of the culture medium Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's 

Medium with low glucose concentration (DMEM-LG, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). 

The culture medium (1.5 mL) was added to aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs in 48-well microplates, 

which were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 throughout the assays. The total 

volume of culture medium was withdrawn at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 72 hours, and the same 

volume of fresh medium was replaced without removing the hydrogels from the wells. 

The samples were stored at -80°C for further characterization. The concentrations of the 

released GFs PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 were measured using enzyme-linked 

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to 

the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications.  

 



102 

 

5.2.8. h-AdMSCs isolation and pre-cultivation 

Human subcutaneous adipose tissue, initially acquired from liposuction surgery, 

was washed with sterile PBS, separated into fractions of 10 g, digested with 20 mg of 

collagenase type 1A and maintained in 20 mL of DMEM-LG containing 10% BSA 

(bovine serum albumin) and 10 µL of gentamicin for 30 min in a bath at 37°C. After 

complete digestion, the reaction was quenched with 10 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS) 

and immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, 

and the pellet was suspended in 10 mL DMEM-LG with 10% FBS. After pre-cultivation 

for 24 h, the culture medium was changed every 3 days; after the fourth passage, the 

cells were characterized by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry and by 

adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation (data not shown) and were then 

used in the subsequent experiments. 

 

5.2.9. Culture of h-AdMSCs-seeding in the composite scaffolds 

The pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were trypsinized and resuspended in P-PRP to a 

final cell concentration of 1 x 104 cells/mL. P-PRP containing h-AdMSCs was activated 

and immediately embedded into the iCHT-TPPs in a 24-well tissue culture plate, using 

200 µL of h-AdMSCs+aP-PRP/100-200 mg of iCHT-TPPs. The composite scaffolds with 

h-AdMSCs were kept at room temperature for 45 minutes for the consolidation of the 

fibrin network. Activated PRP was used as a control.  

 

5.2.9.1. h-AdMSCs proliferation  

The cultivation of h-AdMSCs was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates by 

adding 1 mL of the culture medium DMEM to the seeded composite scaffolds (n=4). The 

seeded composite scaffolds was maintained at 37°C along 10 days. Cell proliferation 

was quantified using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. At cultivation 

days 3, 5, 7 and 10, the composite scaffolds were removed and transferred to 24-well 

plates. MTT (1 mL of 1 mg/mL) was then added, and the cultivation proceeded at 37°C 

for 4 hours. The MTT solution was then discarded, and 1 mL of dimethylsulfoxide 

(DMSO) was added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The samples were shaken 



103 

 

at 120 rpm for 30 min to ensure the homogeneous dissolution of the formazan dye, and 

200 µL of each sample was then transferred to a 96-well plate. Optical density was 

measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (FilterMax F5 Molecular Devices). 

5.2.9.2. Images of the cell-seeded composite scaffolds 

The images of cell-seeded composite scaffolds were obtained by scanning 

electron microscopy after 5 days of h-AdMSCs proliferation. The cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 

phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 hours. The samples were than dehydrated in ethanol for 

15-min intervals in aqueous 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions (2x) and dried 

using the critical point dryer BAL-TEC CPD 030 (BAL-TEC®, Schalksmühle, Germany). 

After gold coating in Sputter Coater POLARON SC7620 (VG Microtech, Ringmer, UK), 

the cell-seeded composite scaffolds were visualized using a scanning electron 

microscope Leo440i (LEO Electron Microscopy/Oxford, Cambridge, UK) with an 

accelerating voltage of 20 kV. 

 

5.2.9.3. Induction of osteogenic differentiation 

h-AdMSCs-seeding composite scaffolds were induced to differentiate into the 

osteogenic lineage by providing the osteogenic medium containing DMEM-LG 

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% ?-glycerol-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 

USA), 1% L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% dexamethasone 

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin solution (Gibco, 

Grand Island, NY, USA). The medium was changed every 7 days.  

 

5.2.9.4. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) 

The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity produced by h-AdMSCs was determined 

on day 14. Here, 200 ?L of the supernatant was collected and mixed with 200 ?L of p-

Nitrophenyl phosphate (SIGMAFAST™ p-Nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets, Sigma, Saint 

Louis, MI, USA) as substrate and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 30 

minutes. Absorbance was read immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm.  

 



104 

 

5.2.10. Statistical analysis 

Each experiment was carried out in triplicate unless otherwise specified. All 

results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The experimental data 

from all of the studies were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistical 

significance was set at a p-value ? 0.05. 

 

5.3. Results and discussion 
 

5.3.1. Crosslinking in the injectable scaffolds of chitosan-sodium 

tripolyphosphate (iCHT-TPPs). 

According to Bhumkar and Pokharkar (2006), chitosan (pKa 6.3) may be 

crosslinked with TPP (pKa 9.7) by two different pH-dependent mechanisms (Figure 20). 

The ionic crosslinking occurs at low pH values by a reaction between NH3+ 

groups of chitosan and P3O10-5 of TPP [Figure 20(a)]. The deprotonation mechanism 

occurs at high pH values using the OH- groups of TPP that are present in solution 

[Figure 20(b)]. In this work, the pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at pH 4, which 

favored the ionic crosslinking mechanism.

The FTIR spectra of pure chitosan and iCHT-TPPs 2:1 are shown in Figure 21. 



105 

 

Pure chitosan was characterized by bands at 3449 cm–1 attributed to the –NH2 

and –OH groups’ stretching vibration and the band of amide I at 1639 cm–1 (Bhumkar &amp;amp; 

Pokharkar, 2006).  

The ionic crosslinking between the –NH3+ group of chitosan and P3O10-5 of TPP in 

iCHT-TPPs (2:1) was characterized by the presence of the P=O and P-O groups at the 

frequencies of 1100 cm-1 and 1232 cm-1, respectively (Mi et al., 1999).

5.3.2. Physicochemical and mechanical properties of iCHT-TPPs.  

The water absorption capacity (swelling properties) of scaffolds must be carefully 

controlled to allow handling during cell implantation and promote cell growth. When 

hydrated, the scaffolds became fragile being deformed and/ or broken with the 

application of small forces. Thus, a balance between the viscoelastic and swelling 

properties is essential to maintain the integrity of scaffolds and support the cell 

proliferation and differentiation.  

Table 2 shows the physicochemical and rheological properties of iCHT-TPPs 

prepared by varying the CHT-TPP mass ratio. The iCHT-TPPs showed a high swelling 

capacity (SR), allowing for fast hydration when culture medium was added. Moreover, 

SR decreased with the degree of crosslinking because of the decreased availability of 

functional groups to hydrogen bonds with water.  

Flory-Rehner calculations were used to determine the effective crosslink density (Ve) 



106 

 

and the molecular weight between crosslinks (Mc). The decrease of the CHT-TPP mass 

ratio increased Ve, as expected (Flory &amp;amp; Rehner, 1943). Moreover, we observed lower 

Mc values, indicating higher entanglement of chains.  

We also estimated the charge ratio (R+/-) of iCHT-TPPs according to Rädler et al. 

(1998). The values of R+/- were negative for iCHT-TPPs 2:1 and positive for iCHT-TPPs 

5:1 and 10:1. Therefore, the increase in the crosslinking degree decreased the positive 

charge of chitosan in the complex. These modifications to the charge ratio may change 

the interactions with the fibrin network and alter the electrostatic interaction with growth 

factors.  

The microparticles in iCHT-TPPs had a mean diameter in the range of 150 to 220 

µm, which was proportional to the CHT-TPP mass ratio. These diameters are within the 

adequate range for an injectable application (&lt;700 µm) (Kablik et al., 2009).

The rheological data (Table 2) show that the iCHT-TPPs exhibited behavior that 

is typical of so-called weak gels, irrespective of their mass ratios, as analyzed by the 

storage (G’) and loss moduli (G”). The moduli had low frequency dependence, and tan ? 

&gt;0.1 (Ikeda &amp;amp; Nishimari, 2001; Clark &amp;amp; Ross-Murphy, 1987). 



107 

 

We also observed an increase in the G’ values with the number of crosslinks or 

entanglements (high Ve and low Mc), which indicated stiffer gels.  

In addition, the values of tan ? indicated an increment in gel strength with an 

increase in Ve. Regardless of the CHT-TPP mass ratio, iCHT-TPPs showed G’ values 

that are adequate (&lt;700 Pa) for injectable application (Kablik et al., 2009).  

Considering the Ostwald de Waele power law (?=K.?n-1), the flow indices (n) of 

iCHT-TPPs showed a viscoelastic behavior that was dependent on mass ratio. The 

pseudoplastic behavior is an important parameter in injectable applications, where the 

flow viscosity should be lower than the rest viscosity. 

In addition to the beneficial rheological properties and microparticle size, the 

injectable scaffolds must have an extrusion force to allow for their easy injection through 

an appropriately sized needle and thereby prevent side effects such as pain (Kablik et 

al., 2009). 

 In iCHT-TPPs, we measured extrusion forces between 10 and 12 N, which were 

adequate (&lt;20 N) for injectable applications (De Melo &amp;amp; Marijnissen-Hofste, 2012; 

Öhrlund, 2010). No modifications were observed in the extrusion force with the degree 

of crosslinking, particle size and distribution, as reported by Bentkover (2009). 

Figure 22 shows the loss weight of iCHT-TPPs after incubation in PBS, pH 7.4, at 

37°C. The microparticles can be considered stable for 30 days, irrespective of the CHT-

TPP mass ratio. The maximum loss weight was approximately 4%, for CHT-TPP 2:1.

5.3.3. Biological characterization 

Figure 23 shows the PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 release kinetics from aP-PRP/iCHT-

TPPs.  

The curves shows predominantly diffusive profiles, indicating no collapse of the 

scaffold structure at the time of the assays. Controlled GF release was achieved from 

aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs compared with aP-PRP alone. The maximum PDGF-AB release 

was obtained at 24 hours [Figure 23(a)], whereas a concentration plateau was not 

observed for TGF-?1 at 72 hours [Figure 23(b)].  

In addition to the barrier of the structures, the interactions of GF and scaffolds 

play an important role in the release. According to Hokugo et al. (2005) and De Cock et 

al. (2012), because GFs are generally basic proteins, in physiological conditions, they 

interact ionically with negatively charged surfaces.  

In this work, we observed a slower release in the PDGF-AB for the scaffold aP-

PRP/iCHT-TPPs mass ratio 2:1 compared with aP-PRP, suggesting electrostatic 

interactions with negative charges of the scaffold. At physiological pH, PDGF-AB bore a 

net positive charge (isoelectric point 9.8-10.5) (De Cock et al., 2012). 

For TGF-?1, a slower release was observed for the scaffolds aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs 

at mass ratios of 5:1 and 10:1 compared with aP-PRP. Because TGF-?1 has the 

isoelectric point of 8.2, which is near the physiological pH (7.4), the positive charges of 

the scaffolds had a smaller influence on controlled release (Wang et al., 2011).  

In this case, we hypothesized that the slower release was primarily due to the 

interaction of the negative fibrin network and the positive scaffold, which entrapped the 

GF molecules.

Scanning electronic microscopy (Figure 24) of aP-PRP showed a tangled network 

that was similar to the extracellular matrix. The microparticles were entrapped by the 

fibrin network, which provided an additional matrix for h-AdMSCs adherence and 

proliferation.

The proliferation of h-AdMSCs cultured in the presence of iCHT-TPPs, as 

assayed by MTT is shown in Figure 25(a). In all of the prepared mass ratios, the iCHT-

TPPs had a higher proliferation compared with the positive control, which indicated 

compatibility.  

The proliferation kinetic profiles in presence of PRP [Figure 25(b)] showed a long 

lag phase (~7 days) for aPRP and aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs at 2:1 and 5:1.  

The proliferation of h-AdMSCs was lower than aP-PRP in the composite scaffolds 

at 2:1 and 5:1 mass ratios, whereas no proliferation was observed at 10:1 aP-

PRP/iCHT-TPPs.

Figure 26 shows significant ALP activity in the aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs, indicating 

stimulation of osteoblast differentiation. It is known that ALP enzymatic activity is 

essential for mineralization. Differences among the structures could not be inferred 

because ALP activity was determined in the culture medium and thus did not include the 

concentrations inside the gels. This may have also contributed to the lower values of 

ALP activities of the composite scaffolds compared with aP-PRP, due to the higher 

viscosity, which delayed the release of ALP.

5.4. Conclusions 
 

We have demonstrated that the injectable composite scaffolds (aP-PRP/iCHT-

TPP) promoted the controlled release of PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 from platelets primarily 

during the first 10 h. Although the physicochemical and rheological properties of iCHT-

TPP increased the stability of the fibrin network, a significant proliferation of AdMSCs 

was observed only for the composite scaffold containing 2:1 chitosan:TPP. However, the 

osteogenic differentiation was promoted in all mass ratios. Thus, the injectable 

composite scaffolds could be optimized to demonstrate their potential for regenerative 

medicine applications.

Abstract. The association of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to fluid hyaluronic acid (HA) has 

yielded beneficial outcomes in vivo in orthopedic applications. However, aside from 

needing to repeat the applications, the literature is not conclusive about the 

improvements to efficiency or long-lasting effects related to PRP alone. Auto-crosslinked 

hyaluronic acid (ACP) may introduce benefits to the stability of fibrin network from 

activated PRP (aP-PRP) and to the mechanical properties of fluid HA. The main 

advantage of ACP is not introducing foreign molecules to the formulation. This study 

was undertaken to investigate in vitro association of aP-PRP and ACPs as composite 

scaffolds for growth factors release, the proliferation of human adipose-derived 

mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs) and differentiation by osteogenic marker alkaline 

phosphatase (ALP). ACP was prepared by organocatalyzed auto-esterification and

structured into microparticles or sponges to create injectable or solid scaffolds, 

respectively. The structured ACP were not cytotoxic and had better mechanical 

properties than does fluid HA. PRP was obtained by centrifuging whole blood without 

the buffy-coat layer (P-PRP). Autologous serum and calcium were used for P-PRP 

activation. Most of PDGF-AB (platelet-derived growth factor AB) and TGF-?1 

(transforming growth factor ?-1) was released from aP-PRP alone or from the composite 

scaffolds in the first 10 hours. The release occurred in concert with the degradation time 

of the structured ACPs. The composite scaffolds improved h-AdMSCs proliferation and 

promoted ALP activity suggesting potential osteogenic differentiation. Therefore, aP-

PRP combined with ACP is a promising biomaterial for further biological studies and 

applications in regenerative medicine.

6.1. Introduction 

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a platelets concentrate prepared from whole blood, 

which is able to release growth factors following induced activation (Anitua 1999; Foster 

et al., 2009). PRP have been widely applied in various regenerative therapies and its 

beneficial effects has been proven mainly in cartilage regeneration, wound healing and 

sports medicine (Crane &amp;amp; Everts, 2008; Civinini et al., 2011; Kon et al., 2011; Amable et 

al., 2013). 

Since the 1990s, when clinical application of PRP began, three generations of 

formulations can be identified: the first generation applied PRP only; the second-

generation included bone marrow cells in PRP; and the third and current generation 

uses PRP and human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs). It has 

been reported that AdMSCs are comparable to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) 

with respect to multi-lineage potential, growth kinetics, and cells senescence (de Ugarte 

et al., 2003). 

Recently, PRP has been used in combination to high molecular weight HA aimed 

to ensure better stability of the fibrin network, control release of GF and decrease pain 



119 

 

related to inflammation caused by injury in the application of PRP (Pak, 2012; de 

Angelis et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Fathi, 2012; de Boulle et al., 2013). 

Pak (2012) has described different methods and pharmaceutical compositions 

comprising PRP, h-AdMSCs, HA and CaCl2 for the treatment, preventions or alleviation 

of bone and cartilage diseases.  

De Angelis et al. (2012) have treated patients with wound dehiscence and tendon 

exposure, showing that PRP combined with fluid hyaluronic acid (fHA) enables a more 

rapid regeneration of damaged tissues. 

Recently, Chen et al. (2014) demonstrated synergic effects of the anabolic 

actions of PRP-fHA on cartilage regeneration and the inhibition of osteoarthritis 

inflammation. Cytokine-induced degeneration was reduced through the recovery of 

chondrogenic signaling. 

The benefits of using platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid when used alone or 

in combination on wound healing were evaluated by Fathi (2012). This author observed 

that the use of PRP alone or in combination with HA accelerate wound healing, while the 

use of low concentration of HA alone presents no improvement of wound healing in 

comparison with normal one. 

However, the need for repeated applications of free HA in vivo has directed the 

studies for the use of biocompatible crosslinked derivatives (de Boulle et al., 2013; 

Collins &amp;amp; Birkinshaw, 2013; Stern et al., 2000).  

Preliminary studies from our group have shown that the addition of divinyl sulfone 

(DVS) crosslinked HA microparticles to activated P-PRP (aP-PRP) improves the 

mechanical properties of the natural fibrin networks by increasing its viscoelasticity and 

eliminating strain hardening (unpublished data). Furthermore, the HA microparticles 

stimulate h-AdMSCs proliferation on the thin fibers (~65 nm) of the fibrin network. 

However, the long-term effects of DVS-crosslinked HA microparticles remain unclear, 

and the release of the chemical crosslinkers causes inflammatory outcomes (Prasadam 

et al., 2013). 

Thus, auto-crosslinked polysaccharide (ACP) represents an interesting strategy 

for improving the stability of HA. ACP polymers are inter- and intra-molecular esters of 

HA for which some of the carboxyl groups have been esterified with hydroxyl groups of 



120 

 

the same and/ or different molecules, thus forming a mixture of lactones and inter-

molecular ester bonds (Mensitieri et al., 1996). 

The main advantage for ACP is the formation of ester bonds without the addition 

of toxic crosslinking agents. As no foreign molecules are used to create the crosslink, 

the gel is de-esterified upon degradation and hyaluronic acid is liberated. HA is a 

naturally occurring molecule that has a biological role and is eliminated through a known 

metabolic pathway (Mensitieri et al., 1996). 

Furthermore, ACP can be prepared with various degrees of crosslinking by 

modulating the reaction conditions, which allow the adaption of its mechanical and/or 

rheological properties for many applications (de Laco et al., 1998)  

ACP has been widely used on the prevention of postsurgical adhesions (de Laco 

et al., 1998; Belluco et al., 2001; Koçak et al., 1999; Yerushalmi et al., 1994). However, 

as far as we know, the application of ACP as scaffolds is still scarce.  

Solchaga et al. (2005) demonstrated that porous sponges of ACP® seeded with 

chondrocytes or osteoblasts improve the cartilage and bone regeneration in 

osteochondral defects of rabbits compared to HYAFF®-11 (a benzyl ester of HA that is 

completely esterified). The degradation time of ACP® led to rapid bone formation while 

the slow degradation of HYAFF®-11 prolonged the presence of cartilage and delayed 

endochondral bone formation. 

The present work extends the previous findings by investigating the association 

of activated aP-PRP and ACP structured in microparticles or sponges as a composite 

scaffold for growth factors (GFs) release, the proliferation of h-AdMSCs and osteogenic 

differentiation in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the composite scaffolds will improve 

proliferation and differentiation of h-AdMSCs by providing better structural and 

mechanical properties compared to fHA or aP-PRP alone.  

This study might offer promising approaches for further biological applications 

and should provide alternatives in orthopedic treatments. 

 

6.2. Experimental  

 



121 

 

6.2.1. Materials 

HA in sodium form (MW = 2 x 106 Da) was obtained from Spec-Chem Ind. 

(Nanjing, China). All other reagents were purchased from Synth® (Diadema, SP, Brazil) 

unless specified otherwise. PRP was prepared from whole blood (WB) of donors, who 

were healthy individuals aged between 30 and 40 years old and previously assessed 

through their clinical examinations. The human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal 

stem cells, h-AdMSCs, were provided by Umbilical Cord Blood Bank of Haematology 

and Hemotherapy Center of University of Campinas. All biological experiments were 

approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Sciences School of the University of 

Campinas (UNICAMP; CAAE: 0972.0.146.000-11). 

 

6.2.2. Methods 

6.2.2.1. Preparation of HA-TBA 

An aqueous solution of 0.5% (w/v) sodium hyaluronate (Na-HA) was stirred in 

strongly acidic ion exchange resin Dowex® 50-8WX-400 mesh (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 

MO, USA) for 8 hours. The suspension was centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge 

(Hettich® Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove the 

resin and neutralized with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBA-OH) 0.2 mol.L-1 (Vetec®, 

Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) to form the quaternary ammonium salt of HA 

(HA-TBA). The solution was then frozen and lyophilized in lyophilizer Liobras L101 

(Liobras, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) for 48 hours (Khetan &amp;amp; Burdick, 2010). 

 

6.2.2.2. Preparation of ACP 

The auto-crosslinked HA (ACP) was prepared by an autoesterification reaction 

according to the protocol described by Bellini et al. (2001) (Figure 27). HA-TBA with a 

molecular weight of approximately 2 x 106 Da and corresponding to 10 mEq of 

monomeric units was solubilized in 50 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 25°C. 

Triethylamine (0.5 mEq) was added and the resulting solution was agitated for 30 

minutes. A solution of 2-chloro-1-methyl pyridinium iodide (CMPI) (0.5 mEq) (Sigma-

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 15 mL of DMSO was slowly added drop by drop over 1 



122 

 

hour and the mixture was kept at 30°C for 15 hours. A solution of sodium chloride 2.5% 

(w/v) was then added and the resulting mixture was poured slowly into 150 mL of 

acetone, maintaining continual agitation. The formed precipitate was centrifuged at 

10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed three times in 100 mL of 5:1 acetone: water and 

three times with 100 mL of acetone and vacuum-dried for 24 hours at 30°C.  

 

Figure 27. Auto-crosslinking reaction using CMPI-activated HA intermediate (Schanté et 

al., 2011). 

 

6.2.2.3. Characterization of ACP 

ACP was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) in a Thermo 

Scientific Nicolet model 6700 (Thermo Scientific Nicolet™, Waltham, MA, USA). 

Measurements were made in the ATR mode with accessory SMART OMNI-SAMPLER, 

in the spectral range of 4000-675 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 cm-1 over 64 scans.  

 

6.2.2.4. Preparation of structured ACP 

The ACP structured in microparticles (mACP) or sponges (sACP) were prepared 

from plain ACP swollen in Milli-Q water. The microparticles were obtained by shearing in 

an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer (IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) at 18,000 rpm 

by 20 minutes, according to Shimojo et al. (2013). The sponges were initially placed in 

polystyrene 24-well microplates (TPP®, Trasadingen, Switzerland), frozen at -20°C and 

lyophilized at temperature of approximately -30°C for 48 hours. 

 

6.2.2.5 Characterization of structured ACP 

HA structured in sponges (sHA) and fluid HA (fHA) were characterized like the 

structured ACP and used as control as necessary. 



123 

 

 

Morphology and pore size. The morphology of ACP sponges was evaluated by 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an LEO 440i Electron Microscopy/Oxford 

(Cambridge, England) operated at 5 kV accelerating voltage. The scaffolds were gold 

coated using a sputter coater POLARON SC7620, VG Microtech (Uckfield, England) for 

180 s at a current of 3 mA. Pore size (n=20) was measured using Image J 1.47t. 

 

Mechanical Properties. Mechanical compression tests of ACP sponges (? = 3) 

were performed using a Universal Testing Machine, MTS model 810-Flex Test 40 (MTS 

Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) up to 60% strain, according to Correia et 

al. (2011). The testing machine was equipped with a 1.5 kN load cell, and the loading 

rate was 5 mm/min. Young’s modulus was calculated in the initial linear section of the 

stress-strain curve, when the strain was lower than 10%.  

 

Degradation time. The gravimetric method described by Tang et al. (2007) was 

used to estimate the degradation time of the structured ACP through measurements of 

remaining weight. The assay was carried out with the ACP microparticles and ACP 

sponges in phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS, pH 7.2) (LB Laborclin, Pinhais, PR, 

Brazil) at 37°C. 

 

Average diameter. The average diameter was measured for the ACP 

microparticles suspended in water. The measurements were performed in a Malvern 

Mastersizer S laser diffraction (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). The standard 

deviation was calculated from ten consecutive measurements. 

 

Rheology. Rheological measurements were performed in steady and oscillatory 

regimes at 25°C using a parallel plate geometry of 20 mm. Steady shear measurements 

were obtained at shear rates of 0.1-50 s-1. Oscillatory measurements were conducted in 

the linear region with a stress of 1.188 Pa and in the frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz. 

All rheological measurements were performed using the swollen ACP microparticles 

equilibrated in Milli-Q on a rheometer Haake RheoStress 1 (Haake, Karlsruhe, 



124 

 

Germany). 

 

Extrusion force. Initially the ACP microparticles were loaded in 1-mL plastic 

syringes with 30-gauge needles. Afterward, the force required to extrude was measured 

in a MTS 810 Servo-hydraulic Universal Testing Machine (MTS Systems Corporation, 

Eden Prairie, MN, USA) (Load Cell 1.5 kN) at 25°C at a 5.0 mm/min extrusion rate. 

 

Swelling ratio. Swelling measurements of the ACP microparticles were performed 

in PBS at 25°C after 72 h of incubation, according to Shu et al. (2004). The swelling ratio 

(SR) was calculated using the following Equation (1). 

 

?? =

??
                                                                                                            Equation (1) 

 

where ?s and ?d are the weights of the scaffolds in the swelled state and the dry state, 

respectively. 

The swelling measurements of the ACP sponges was determined by swelling the 

freeze-dried ACP sponges (with known weights) in PBS at 37°C for 24 hours. The 

swollen ACP sponges were weighed after the removal of excess of water by keeping the 

surfaces on a filter paper. The swelling ratio (SR) was also calculated using Equation 

(1). 

 

Porosity. The porosity (?) of the ACP sponges was determined according to the 

protocol used by Wang et al. (2011), and calculated by Equation (2).

where Vm is the total volume of ACP sponges (cm3), ? is the density of non-porous HA 

(1.0016 g/cm3) and ?m is the weight of sponges (g). Values are expressed as the mean 

± standard deviation (n=3). 

 



125 

 

Cell compatibility. The compatibility of the structured ACP with h-AdMSCs cells 

was carried out by exposing them to cell culture at 37°C for 24 hours. Then, cell viability 

was evaluated by using an MTT assay (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-

diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT, Molecular Probes), according to modified Mosmann 

method (1983). The MTT assay is a colorimetric test based on the reduction of yellow 

tetrazolium salt into a purple formazan product in presence of cells (Gümüs?derelio?lu &amp;amp; 

Aday, 2011). 

 

6.2.2.6. Preparation of PRP  

PRP rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes (P-PRP) was prepared according to 

Perez et al. (2014). Briefly, whole blood (WB) was collected into 3.5 mL vacuum tubes 

(Vacuette®, Campinas, SP, Brazil) containing sodium citrate 3.2% (w/v) as 

anticoagulant. WB was initially centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge (Hettich® 

Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 100 ? g for 10 minutes, at 25°C, After the formation 

of three layers (a bottom layer composed mainly of red blood cells (RBCs); an upper 

layer composed of plasma, platelets and some WBCs; and an intermediate layer, or 

buffy coat, composed mostly of WBCs), only the upper layer was collected to obtain P-

PRP. The concentration of platelets, WBCs and RBCs in WB and P-PRP was 

determined using the ABX Micros ES 60 hematology analyzer (HORIBA ABX 

Diagnostics, Montpellier, France). 

 

6.2.2.7. Preparation of activated P-PRP (aP-PRP) 

aP-PRP was prepared via the activation of P-PRP with autologous serum (Ser) 

and 10% (w/v) CaCl2 solution as agonists using the following proportions: agonist/P-

PRP=20% (v/v); Ser/CaCl2 volumetric ratio=9. Ser was prepared by collecting 5 mL of 

WB in tubes without anticoagulant. After 30 minutes for clot formation, WB was 

centrifuged at 2000 ? g for 10 minutes (Perez et al., 2013).  

 

6.2.2.8 Preparation of composite scaffolds 

For preparation of the composite scaffolds, immediately after activation, aP-PRP 

was mixed with the ACP microparticles or embedded by dripping into the ACP sponges, 



126 

 

both in 48-well microplates. In all biological assays performed in this work, the following 

proportions of aP-PRP to structured ACP were used: aP-PRP: microparticles = 200 

µL:100-200 mg and aP-PRP: sponges = 200 µL:10-20 mg in order to guarantee the 

same proportion PRP to HA. 

 

6.2.2.9. Characterization of composite scaffolds 

Release of growth factors. The release of platelet-derived growth factor AB 

(PDGF-AB) and transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) was performed after a 1 hour 

gelation of composite scaffolds in the presence of the culture medium Dulbecco's 

Modified Eagle's Medium with low glucose concentration (DMEM-LG, Gibco, Grand 

Island, NY, USA) in 48-well microplates. The microplates were maintained in an 

incubator with 5% CO2 over the assays. After sampling, the volume was replaced with 

fresh medium at 3, 6, 12, 48 and 72 hours without removing the hydrogels from the 

wells. The samples were stored at -80°C until all samples were collected. The 

concentrations of the released GFs were measured using enzyme-linked 

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to 

the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications. 

 

h-AdMSCs-seeding in the composite scaffolds. The pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were 

trypsinized and resuspended in P-PRP to a final cell concentration of 1 x 104 cells/ mL. 

P-PRP containing h-AdMSCs was activated and immediately pipetted onto the surface 

of the microparticles or embedded into the sponges, both in 24-well tissue culture plates. 

The composite scaffolds were kept at room temperature for 45 minutes for consolidation 

of the fibrin network. The cells seeded in fHA or in sHA were used as controls.  

 

h-AdMSCs cultivation in the composite scaffolds. Cultivation of the h-AdMSCs 

was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates, by adding 1 mL of the culture medium 

(DMEM) to the seeded composite scaffolds (n=4). The culture was maintained at 37°C 

over 10 days. Cell proliferation was quantified using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium 

bromide (MTT) assay. At 3, 5, 7 and 10 cultivation days, the substrates were removed 

and transferred to 24-well plates. MTT (1 mL of 1 mg/mL) was then added, and the 



127 

 

cultivation proceeded at 37°C for 4 hours. The MTT solution was then discarded, and 1 

mL of DMSO was added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The samples were 

shaken at 120 rpm for 30 min to ensure homogeneous dissolution of the formazan dye, 

and then 200 µL of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. Optical density was 

measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (FilterMax F5 Molecular Devices, 

Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The cell concentration was obtained from the previously built 

calibration curve. 

 

Images of the cell-seeded composite scaffolds. Images of cell-seeded composite 

scaffolds were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after 5 days of h-

AdMSCs proliferation. The substrates were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde 

and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, for 2 hours. The samples were than dehydrated in 

ethanol for 15-min intervals in aqueous 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol solutions 

(2x) and dried at the critical point dryer BAL-TEC CPD 030 (BAL-TEC®, Schalksmühle, 

Germany). After gold coating in a Sputter Coater POLARON, SC7620 (VG Microtech, 

Ringmer, UK), the samples were visualized with a scanning electron microscope 

Leo440i (LEO Electron Microscopy/Oxford, Cambridge, UK) with an accelerating voltage 

of 20 kV. 

 

Induction of osteogenic differentiation. h-AdMSCs-seeding composite scaffolds 

were induced to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage by providing the osteogenic 

medium containing DMEM-LG supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% ?-

glycerol-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 

and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin solution (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The medium 

was changed every 7 days.  

 

Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP). The level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 

activity of h-AdMSCs was determined on day 14. Two hundred microliters of the 

supernatant was collected and mixed with 200 ?L of p-nitrophenyl phosphate 

(SIGMAFAST™ p-Nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets, Sigma, Saint Louis, MI, USA) as 



128 

 

substrate and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Absorbance was read 

immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm. 

 

6.2.2.10. Statistical analysis 

Each experiment was carried out in triplicate unless otherwise specified. All 

results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The experimental data 

from all the studies were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistical 

significance was set to p-value ? 0.05.  

 

6.3. Results 
 

6.3.1. Characterization of ACP  

The IR spectra from ACP (Figure 28) shows peaks between 1000 and 850 cm-1, 

corresponding to deformation out of the plane of the OH group, which is related to the H-

bonds; between 1250-1080 cm-1, corresponding to the asymmetrical stretching CC(=O)-

O and CHO; at approximately 1400 cm-1, corresponding to the deformation of COH 

bond; and in the region of 1800-1700 cm-1, which is attributed to the stretching vibration 

of C=O of carboxylic acyl groups (~1725 cm -1) and ester groups (1780-1760 cm-1) 

(Schanté et al., 2011; Silverstein et al., 1974). 

These results ensured the auto-crosslinking and its unique feature that no foreign 

bridge molecules are present between the crosslinked HA chains.

6.3.2. Characterization of ACPs structured scaffolds 

The rheological behavior determined by oscillatory and steady measurements of 

the ACP structured in microparticles in relation to 1% fHA is shown in Figure 29(a) and 

29(b), respectively. The microparticles exhibited the gel-like behavior, as analyzed by 

the storage (G’) and loss moduli (G”), where G’ is higher than G” in all studied frequency 

ranges and the curves are parallel to the frequency axis, indicating crosslinking. The 1% 

fHA showed crossover (G’=G”) around 1 Hz indicating concentrated solution behavior, 

as expected. Moreover, mACP exhibited behavior typical of so-called weak gels with tan 

? (G”/G’)=0.19 in 1 Hz (Ikeda &amp;amp; Nishimari, 2001; Clark &amp;amp; Ross-Murph, 1987).

fluid HA (1% wt.). G’ (closed symbol) and G” (open symbol).  

 

The flow curve (Figure 29b) showed a shear thinning behavior characteristic of 

pseudoplastic fluids for mACP and the microparticles were more resistant to shearing 

(up to1 s-1) than 1% fHA.  

Moreover, the microparticles showed G’ (~300 Pa) values between 100-700 Pa, 

which are adequate for injectable application (Kablik et al., 2009). 

In addition to the beneficial rheological properties and microparticle size, the 

injectable scaffolds must have an extrusion force to allow for their easy injection through 

an appropriately sized needle and thereby prevent side effects such as pain, bruising, 

crossover 



130 

 

bleeding, and edema (Kablik et al., 2009). 

For injectable applications, extrusion force values must 

 be smaller than 20 N and the mean diameter of particles smaller than 700 µm 

(Shimojo et al., 2013; Kablik et al., 2009). 

In ACP microparticles, we standardized the mean diameter to values smaller than 

200 µm by adequate conditions of shearing. Thus, the ACP microparticles showed 

extrusion forces around 20N, which is adequate for injectable applications (Table 3). 

Moreover, the extrusion force of the microparticles was five times higher than the 

1% fHA, indicating crosslinking and improvement of mechanical properties.

The Young’s modulus of ACP sponges (Table 3) was approximately 3 times 

higher than for the sHA with similar porosity (~97%). This result is evidence of the 

improvements to mechanical resistance imparted by ACP, which is one of the most 

important requirements for scaffolds in tissue engineering.  

The capacity to hydration is also an essential factor for cell migration inside the 

scaffolds. The 5% auto-crosslinking did not greatly affect the capacity for hydration of 

the structured ACP. Although the hydration capacity is directly linked to the functional 

groups capable of forming H-bonds with water, in this case, the higher hydration 

capacity of the ACP sponges (~90%) can be attributed to the porous structure of the 

scaffold, which retains greater amount of unbound water. For the ACP microparticles, 

the swelling was ~60%, due to a smaller porous size structure. 

The porosities of the ACP sponges and sHA were similar, which evidence the 

superiority of the ACP sponges as a scaffold, when associated to its mechanical 



131 

 

resistance. The porosity values of ACP sponges and sHA ranged around 97%, which 

are adequate for tissue engineering. 

Different aggregations of the HA chains in ACP sponges or sHA are shown in 

Figure 30. In both cases, highly porous structures were formed, confirming the 

determined values for porosity in Table 2. However, the structure of ACP sponges has 

more round pores [Figure 30(a)], whereas the sHA has a leaf structure [Figure 30(b)].

The proliferation of h-AdMSCs results, as assayed by MTT, shown in Figure 

31(a) indicated that the structured ACP, sHA and fHA could be considered compatible to 

the cells, by comparison with the positive toxicity control (PTC).  

We also observed that the proliferation of h-AdMSCs on ACP sponges was 

significantly higher than the negative control (p&lt;0.05).  

Moreover, ACP microparticles showed lower cell proliferation compared to fHA, 

while there were no significant differences between the cell proliferation of ACP sponges 

and sHA.

Figure 31(b) shows the degradation kinetics of the structured ACP in PBS in 

terms of remaining weight. Most of the weight reduction, around 40% was observed in 

the first day for both structures. Scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications should 

degrade over the course of tissue regeneration to allow complete repair by host tissue. 

Therefore, degradation must be adjusted to release GFs and allow for cell proliferation.

P-PRP alone; (?) ACP sponges and (?) sHA. The concentration of platelets in P-PRP 

was 407,000 pq/mm3. 

 

Controlled release of GFs was achieved from the composite scaffolds. The 

curves show parallel diffusive profiles. The bulk of the GFs were released in the first 12 

hours. For both GFs, the initial release rate was higher in aP-PRP alone and aP-PRP-

ACP sponges, followed by aP-PRP-ACP microparticles, aP-PRP-fHA and aP-PRP-sHA. 

Subsequently, the release rates reduced and different amounts of the GFs were 

released from the scaffolds over the 72 hours assay.  

The release of the most of the GFs occurred in concert with the degradation time 

(12 hours) of the structured ACP [Figure 31(b)]. 

The structured ACP promoted proliferation of h-AdMSCs (Figure 33), which was 

evidence of the benefits of the porous structure, swelling and mechanical properties on 

cell adhesion and migration. 

The importance of the stability of the porous structures for cultivation is clear from 

comparing the performances of aP-PRP-ACP microparticles and aP-PRP-ACP sponges.  

The aP-PRP-ACP sponges showed better cell proliferation compared to aP-PRP 

alone. The effect was similar to aP-PRP-sHA [Figure 33(b)]. However, aP-PRP-ACP 

microparticles [(Figure 33(a)] showed reduced cell proliferation related to aP-PRP alone 

and fHA showed no cell proliferation attributed to the very small pore size and to high

6.4. Discussion 

In this study, we prepared novel composite scaffolds by associating aP-PRP to 

3D-ACP structured in microparticles or sponges.  

ACP is a crosslinked derivative of hyaluronic acid biocompatible, obtained by 

organocatalyzed auto-esterification (Bellini et al., 2001). ACP was used to increase the 

residence time at the site of application and improve the physicochemical and 

mechanical properties of free HA, reducing the need for repeated applications. 

The auto-esterification reaction of HA was performed with the quaternary 

ammonium salt of HA (HA-TBA) as the intermediate. CMPI was used as activating agent 

of the carboxyl groups of HA according to Magnani et al. (2000). The anhydrous organic 

solvent DMSO was used to minimize CMPI hydrolysis. CMPI reacts with a carboxyl 

group of HA, forms a pyridinium intermediate and releases a chloride ion, which is 

neutralized by tetrabutylammonium. Triethylamine neutralizes the released iodide ion. 

When no amine is added to the reaction medium, esterification occurs as the CMPI-

activated HA reacts with its own hydroxyl groups, forming an ester crosslink between the 

HA chains. The product is the auto-crosslinked HA, usually called ACP. 

The ACP ensures that only the HA, a naturally occurring molecule that has a 

biologic role, is released and eliminated through a known metabolic pathway during its 

degradation in the organism (Mensitieri et al., 1996). According Koçak et al. (1999), ACP 

is slowly resorbed within 2 weeks and is excreted within 40 days by the kidneys. 

In this work, ACP was structured in microparticles and sponges to create 

injectable or solid scaffolds, respectively. Furthermore, aiming ensure better stability of 

the fibrin network from PRP and control the release of GFs, we associate PRP with 

structured ACP. 

P-PRP was obtained by centrifugation to about twice the concentration relative to 

WB. Haynesworth et al. (2002) showed that the proliferation and differentiation of adult 

mesenchymal stem cells are directly related to the platelet concentration. Platelet 



137 

 

concentrations ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 x 106 platelets/µL have been proposed to be 

effective for in vivo applications by Weibrich et al. (2004) and Fennis et al. (2005). In our 

biological assays, we used around 0.5 x 106 platelets/µL due to the platelet 

concentration factor (2x) inherent to the process used to obtain PRP. 

P-PRP was activated with autologous serum and Ca+2 in specific conditions to 

obtain fibrin network architectures with thin fibers with an average radius of 

approximately 65 nm. This type of fiber favors proliferation of h-AdMSCs due to its 

paracrine nature for the cells (Ye et al., 2013)  

The composite scaffolds were obtained by mixing the microparticles or 

embedding the sponges with immediately activated P-PRP to ensure that the fibrin 

network was gelled in the scaffold.  

The structured ACP were characterized by physicochemical and mechanical 

properties.  

The effect of ACP structured on biological performance of aP-PRP/ACP was 

evaluated by the kinetics of growth factor release (PDGF-AB and TGF-?1), h-AdMSCs 

proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by marker ALP. 

Beyond that, the scaffolds structured in sponges were characterized in terms of 

porosity, pore shape and interconnectivity, because these aspects are determinant for 

cellular colonization in vitro since they affect the diffusion of physiological nutrients and 

cells through the scaffold (Leong et al., 2003; Liu &amp;amp; Ma, 2004). In addition, the high 

porosity (&gt;90%) and the interconnectivity of pores compromised the mechanical and 

structural stability of the scaffolds. According to Loh &amp;amp; Choong (2013), these aspects 

must be evaluated in accordance with the application and degradation rate of materials 

used. For order to guide tissue regeneration, the mechanical properties of scaffolds 

must maintain the spaces required for cell in-growth and matrix elaboration during in 

vitro cultivation (Leong et al., 2003). The ACP sponges presented morphological 

properties adequate to tissue engineering, whereas the mechanical properties indicated 

application for soft tissues (Hollister, 2005).  

The scaffolds structured in microparticles were characterized by rheological and 

mechanical properties, which allowed injectable applications (Kablik et al., 2009). The 

average diameter of the microparticles of 190 ± 5 µm was supported by our previous 



138 

 

work on viscoelasticity and injection force (Shimojo et al., 2013). 

Moreover, we observed that h-AdMSCs cultured in ACP structured scaffolds 

proliferated ensuring the non-cytotoxicity. 

It is well known that growth factors greatly contribute to wound healing and tissue 

regeneration at various stages of cell proliferation and differentiation (Stocum, 1997). 

Moreover, the fibrin converted from fibrinogen works in concert with these GF in 

promoting of tissue regeneration. 

However, the release of most of these growth factors from PRP occurs within the 

first hours after platelet activation and the gradual release of GF is essential for cascade 

of events involved on regeneration process (McCarrel &amp;amp; Fortier, 2009).  

Tsay et al. (2005) showed in their in vitro study that PRP gels had a burst release 

of 80% of PDGF-AB and 82% of TGF-?1 in the medium after 24 h and a sustained 

release for another 14 days. Thus, to protect the GFs against proteolysis and to extend 

its activity, Tabata (2003) suggested combining the functions of scaffolds with controlled 

release technology.  

Scaffolds can be an interesting alternative to gradual release of GFs increasing 

the effectiveness of PRP, and therefore, the regeneration of tissues.  

Aside from the barrier of the ACP structures, the interactions among GFs and the 

scaffolds also play an important role in the controlled release.  

In order to control the release of growth factors into scaffolds, chemical bonding 

(covalent and non-covalent) or physical interaction have been used (Tabata, 2003; King 

&amp;amp; Krebsbach, 2012). However, the physical interactions using hydrophilic polymers has 

been the most commonly used approach to incorporate growth factors into scaffolds 

(King &amp;amp; Krebsbach, 2012). Increasing the magnitude of these electrostatic interactions 

decreases the initial burst release.  

The increase of the concentration of charge on scaffold is the common technique 

to increase the electrostatic attraction between growth factors and scaffolds. Although, 

some studies reported that specific intermolecular interactions may be more effective at 

minimizing the initial burst release of growth factors when compared to non-specific 

electrostatic interactions because these interactions are stronger and localized (Gao et 

al., 2001; Jha et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011). 



139 

 

Because growth factors are generally basic proteins (isoelectric point &gt; 7), in 

physiological pH, they will have positive charge interacting ionically with the acidic 

species. (Hokugo et al.,2005; Okuda et al., 2003) 

Thus, when a scaffold is prepared from a biodegradable polymer with negative 

charges, such as hyaluronic acid and ACP, the growth factors with a positively charged 

site interact electrostatically with the polymer and can be physically immobilized. If 

environmental changes, such as increasing in ionic strength, occurs, the immobilized 

growth factor will be released. However, if such an environmental change does not take 

place, degradation of the scaffolds will be responsible for growth factors release.  

Hokugo et al. (2005) and Tabata &amp;amp; Ikada (1998) reported the controlled release 

of TGF-?1 and PDGF from the hydrogel of acidic gelatin and demonstrated successful 

bone regeneration in rabbit and monkey skull defects, in marked contrast to defects 

treated with free TGF-?1. According theses authors, TGF-?1 and PDGF are sorbed into 

the acidic gelatin hydrogel mainly due to electrostatic interaction between the gelatin 

and GFs molecules. The immobilized growth factors were released from the hydrogel 

since hydrogel degradation occurs. 

Scaffold degradation plays an important role in controlled release in scaffolds that 

strongly interact with growth factors. Generally, growth factor released from these 

scaffolds has been correlated to the rate of degradation of material after the initial burst 

release period (King &amp;amp; Krebsbach, 2012).  

In vivo, it is known that the growth factors are normally stored in the body ionically 

bound to the acidic polysaccharides of the ECM. These bounds protects growth factors 

against denaturation and enzymatic degradation in vivo. In this case, the growth factors 

are released from the ECM complex due to polysaccharide degradation according to the 

need (Tabata, 2003). 

Growth factor released from degradable scaffolds can be tuned by controlling 

either factor diffusion or degradation. Fast degradation will lead to rapid release of 

growth factors, while slowing degradation will retard release of factors (Fournier et al., 

2003).  

Despite the controlled release compared to aP-PRP alone, we observed that the 

initial burst of release within 12 hours occurred in concordance with higher degradation 



140 

 

of scaffolds. After this first step, both release and degradation rate are reduced, 

indicating that the GFs release is governed mainly by degradation of scaffolds. 

Van der Dolder et al. (2006) and Lucarelli et al. (2003) showed that PRP had a 

stimulating effect on the initial cell growth and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells and 

stromal cells. 

Moreover, according to Okuda et al. (2003), PRP modulates the cell proliferation 

by PDGF- and/or TGF-?1 mediated-mechanisms.  

Although controversial, it is known that these effects are dependent of PRP 

concentration. Choi et al. (2005) and Arpornmaeklong et al. (2004) showed in their 

studies that the cell viability, proliferation and differentiation were affected by PRP 

concentrations. The results obtained by Choi et al. showed that the viability and 

proliferation of alveolar bone cells were suppressed by high PRP concentrations, but 

were stimulated by low PRP concentrations (1–5%). In contrast, Arpornmaeklong et al. 

(2004) showed that a high concentration of PRP inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and 

increased the proliferation of pre-osteoblast-like cells or osteoblast precursor cells. PRP 

in low concentration did not show a marked effect on cell proliferation or differentiation. 

We found that despite the high concentration of PRP (20% v/v) used in the 

assays, the presence of aP-PRP in the scaffolds was benefic on cell proliferation and 

differentiation.  

We also verified that the differences on structuration of scaffolds in microparticles 

or sponges produced a more prominent effect on cell proliferation of the composite 

scaffolds compared to stimulating of osteogenic differentiation.  

 

6.5. Conclusions 

 

We have demonstrated that the composite scaffolds released PDGF-AB and 

TGF-?1 from platelets mainly during the first 12 h. The released amounts depended on 

the architecture of the structures and on the interactions of the GFs and HA. We also 

showed the composite scaffolds in microparticles or sponges promoted h-AdMSCs 

proliferation and stimulated osteogenic differentiation as evaluated by ALP activity. 

Thus, our results provide evidence that composite scaffolds with superior mechanical 



141 

 

properties are promising biomaterials for future clinical use in osteoarthritis therapies. 

The flexibility to obtain injectable formulations (microparticles) or solid sponges opens 

perspectives to use the ACP-derived biomaterials in non-surgical applications, for 

surgical implants or even for wound healing.

Abstract. Nowadays, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) has been widely used 

associated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in regenerative medicine. This study aimed 

to investigate in vitro the association of HA crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl 

ether (BDDE), structured in microparticles (mHA-BDDE) and sponges (sHA-BDDE), with 

PRP as composite scaffolds for growth factors release, proliferation of human adipose-

derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs) and differentiation by osteogenic marker 

alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The reason for using BDDE is to increase the residence

time in vivo, improve the mechanical stability of free HA (fHA) and provide a larger 

surface area for cell proliferation and differentiation in a new tissue. PRP was obtained 

via controlled centrifugation of whole blood and activated with autologous serum and 

calcium. The results showed that structuration benefited the physicochemical and 

mechanical properties compared to fHA. Both structures were non-cytotoxic. The 

release of GFs from PRP was lower than fHA but higher than the fibrin network. The 

effects on the proliferation of seeded mesenchymal cells were not intense. However, a 

remarkable activity of the osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase was observed. We 

concluded the structuration of HA provides injectable (mHA-BDDE) or solid (sHA-BDDE) 

formulations with better properties compared to fHA, which associated to PRP may be 

promising for regeneration of bone tissue. 

 

Keywords: Platelet-rich plasma; hyaluronic acid; 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether;

7.1. Introduction 

 

Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is an autologous product prepared from whole blood, 

consisting of a concentrate of platelets, leukocytes, protein and other components 

dispersed in a small fraction of plasma (Marx et al., 1998; Marx, 2004). Platelets and 

leukocytes are sources of growth factors (GFs) which promote wound healing and tissue 

regeneration, through proliferation and differentiation of specific cells.  

In the last decade, PRP has been widely used in medical practice in various 

therapies, especially in orthopedics and sports medicine. This is mainly due to its ability 

to regenerate bone lesions, tendons and cartilage, often avoiding surgical interventions 

(Lana et al., 2014). 

Pure PRP, named as P-PRP, is rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes, according 

to the classification of Ehrenfest et al. (2009). 

Preparation of PRP is composed of two main steps: concentration and activation. 

The fibrin network is formed by the activation of platelets and the breakdown of 

fibrinogen from plasma. The fibrin network is also a weak gel, which acts as a barrier for 



149 

 

release of growth factors and also as a natural scaffold for proliferation and 

differentiation of mesenchymal cells.  

However, the fibrin network is fragile, has low viscosity and viscoelasticity, and 

also undergoes rapid degradation in a biological environment. In addition to this, the 

released GFs have a half-life of only few hours.  

In order to overcome these limitations, in the last decade the PRP has been used 

in orthopedics, associated with free hyaluronic acid (HA) of high molecular weight (Pak, 

2012; De Angelis et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014). Clinical studies in literature have 

shown that tissue regeneration with free HA associated with PRP is greater than HA or 

PRP alone (Pak, 2012; De Angelis et al., 2012). Furthermore, the presence of the HA in 

the formulation is responsible for the reduction of pain resulting from inflammation 

caused by injury in the application of PRP (Fathi, 2012; Chen et al., 2014). 

In our previous studies, we observed that free HA, when combined with PRP, 

interacted with fibrin network improving their mechanical and viscoelastic properties and 

promoting the gradual release of GFs. However, the low mechanical stability of the free 

HA and the need for repeated injections in vivo have limited their application in 

regenerative medicine. 

Thus, aiming to overcome these limitations, we structured HA in microparticles or 

sponges, which were chemically crosslinked by 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) 

for stabilization. The microparticles must meet the requirements of injectable 

formulations while the sponges works as solid scaffolds.  

Our hypothesis is that by improving the structural and mechanical properties of 

the fibrin network we benefit the proliferation and differentiation of h-AdMSCs, thereby 

increasing the efficiency of the PRP in tissue regeneration.  

HA crosslinked by BDDE has been widely used in medical and cosmetic area, 

mainly as dermal fillers on tissue augmentation and regeneration (Allemann &amp;amp; 

Baumann, 2008; Andre, 2004; Beasley et al., 2009; Falcone &amp;amp; Berg, 2008) and also as 

a viscosupplement for joint diseases (Schanté et al., 2011; Malson &amp;amp; Lindqvist, 1987).  

HA can be crosslinked by BDDE under alkaline conditions, in which it reacts with 

the deprotonated hydroxyl group of HA to form a stable covalent ether linkage between 

HA and the epoxide groups of the crosslinker (Kenne et al., 2013; Malson &amp;amp; Lindqvist, 



150 

 

1986; Garg &amp;amp; Hales, 2004; Schanté et al., 2011). Its ability to crosslink is attributed to 

the reactivity of the epoxide groups present at the two ends of the molecule (De Boulle 

et al., 2013).  

Besides the biodegradability and stability of the ether bond relative to the ester or 

amide bond, BDDE shows lower toxicity (rat oral LD50=1134 mg/kg) compared to others 

crosslinkers (Yeom et al., 2010). 

La Gatta et al. (2013) obtained HA sponges for soft tissues regeneration by 

lyophilization and then reacted with BDDE in heterogeneous conditions. The scaffolds 

showed promising physicochemical and mechanical properties, good cellular viability, 

high stability in cell culture and for enzymatic degradation.  

Zawko et al. (2009) engineered novel dual-crosslinked hyaluronic acid hydrogel 

scaffolds with photopatterned anisotropic swelling using BDDE and glycidyl 

methacrylate, but only the physicochemical and mechanical properties were evaluated. 

Besides the limited number of studies with HA-BDDE, as far as we know, there is 

none report in the literature on the use of HA-BDDE associated to PRP for applications 

in tissue regeneration.  

  

 

7.2. Experimental Section  
 

7.2.1. Materials 

HA in sodium form (MW = 2 x 106 Da) was obtained from Spec-Chem Ind. 

(Nanjing, China). 1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) was obtained from Aldrich 

Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). All other reagents were purchased from Synth® 

(Diadema, SP, Brazil) unless specified otherwise. PRP was prepared from whole blood 

(WB) of donors, who were healthy individuals aged between 30 and 40 years old and 

previously assessed through clinical examinations. The human adipose tissue-derived 

mesenchymal stem cells, h-AdMSCs, were provided by Haematology and Hemotherapy 

Center, Umbilical Cord Blood Bank, University of Campinas. All biological experiments 

were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Sciences School of the 



151 

 

University of Campinas (UNICAMP; CAAE: 0972.0.146.000-11). 

 

7.2.2. Methods 

7.2.2.1. Preparation and characterization of HA crosslinked with BDDE 

The plain hydrogel of HA/BDDE was prepared in a 1:1 ratio by weight, according 

to the methodology described by Wang (2005). Sodium hyaluronate was dissolved in 

0.25 mol.L-1 NaOH aqueous solution in a stirrer vessel at room temperature for 4 hours. 

BDDE was added to the solution under stirring, and then the solution was kept at 50°C 

for four hours. Then, phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) (LB Laborclin, 

Pinhais, PR, Brazil) was added to the stirrer vessel to wash and hydrate the obtained 

gel. After 2.5 days, washing with six changes of fresh PBS, the gel was centrifuged to 

remove free PBS. The HA-BDDE crosslinking was characterized by Fourier-transform 

infrared (FTIR) in a Thermo Scientific Nicolet model 6700 (Thermo Scientific Nicolet™, 

Waltham, MA, USA). Measurements were made in the ATR mode with accessory 

SMART OMNI-SAMPLER, in the spectral range of 4000-675 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 

cm-1 over 64 scans.  

 

7.2.2.2. Preparation of structured HA-BDDE 

The HA-BDDE structured in microparticles (mHA-BDDE) or sponges (sHA-BDDE) 

were prepared from HA-BDDE plain hydrogel swollen in Milli-Q water. The 

microparticles were obtained by shearing in an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer (IKA 

Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) at 18,000 rpm by 20 minutes (Shimojo et al., 2013). 

The sponges were initially placed in polystyrene 48-well microplates (TPP®, 

Trasadingen, Switzerland), frozen at -20°C and lyophilized at controlled temperature of 

approximately -30°C for 48 hours (Shimojo et al., 2015). Non-crosslinked sponges (sHA) 

was also prepared as control, as well as fluid HA (fHA).  

 

7.2.3. Characterization of the structures 

Degradation time. The gravimetric method described by Tang et al. (2007) was 

used to estimate the degradation time in PBS at 37°C of the structured HA-BDDE 



152 

 

through measurements of remaining weight. 

 

Cell compatibility. The compatibility of the structured HA-BDDE with h-AdMSCs 

cells was carried out by exposing them to cell culture at 37°C for 24 hours. Then, cell 

viability was evaluated by using an MTT assay (3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-

diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT, Molecular Probes), according to modified Mosmann 

(1983) method. The MTT assay is a colorimetric test based on the reduction of yellow 

tetrazolium salt into a purple formazan product in presence of cells (Gümüs?derelio?lu &amp;amp; 

Aday, 2011). 

 

7.2.3.1. mHA-BDDE 

Average diameter. The average diameter was measured for the mHA-BDDE 

suspended in water. The measurements were performed in a Malvern Mastersizer S 

laser diffraction (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). The standard deviation was 

calculated from five consecutive measurements. 

 

Rheology. Rheological measurements of mHA-BDDE were performed in steady 

and oscillatory regimes at 25°C using a parallel plate geometry of 20 mm. Steady shear 

measurements were obtained at shear rates of 0.1-50 s-1. Oscillatory measurements 

were conducted in the linear region with a stress of 1.188 Pa and in the frequency range 

of 0.01 to 10 Hz. All rheological measurements were performed using the swollen mHA-

BDDE equilibrated in Milli-Q on a rheometer Haake RheoStress 1 (Haake, Karlsruhe, 

Germany). 

 

Extrusion force. Initially the mHA-BDDE were loaded in 1 mL plastic syringes with 

30 gauge needles. Afterward, the force required to extrude was measured in a MTS 810 

Servo-hydraulic Universal Testing Machine (MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, 

MN, USA) (load cell 1.5 kN) at 25°C at a 5.0 mm/min extrusion rate. 

 

Swelling ratio (SR). Swelling measurements of the HA-BDDE microparticles were 

performed in PBS at 37°C after 72 h of incubation, according to Shu et al. (2004). SR 



153 

 

was calculated using the following Equation (1). 

 

SR =

Wd
                                                                                                            Equation (1) 

 

where ws and wd are the weights of the scaffolds in the swelled state and the dry state, 

respectively. 

 

7.2.3.2. sHA-BDDE 

Morphology and pore size. The morphology of sHA-BDDE was evaluated by 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an LEO 440i Electron Microscopy/Oxford 

(Cambridge, England) operated at 5 kV accelerating voltage. The sponges were gold-

coated using a sputter coater POLARON SC7620, VG Microtech (Uckfield, England) for 

180 s at a current of 3 mA. Pore size (n=20) was measured using Image J 1.47t. 

 

Swelling ratio (SR). The swelling measurements of the HA-BDDE sponges was 

determined by swelling the freeze-dried HA-BDDE sponges (with known weights) in 

PBS at 37°C for 24 hours. The swollen HA-BDDE sponges were weighed after the 

removal of excess of water by keeping the surfaces on a filter paper. The swelling ratio 

was also calculated using Equation (1). 

 

Porosity. The porosity (?) of the sHA-BDDE was determined according to the 

protocol used by Wang et al. (2003), and calculated by Equation (2).

where ?m is the total volume of sHA-BDDE (cm3), ? is the density of HA (1.0016 g/cm3) 

and wm is the weight of sHA-BDDE (g). Values are expressed as the mean ± standard 

deviation (n=3). 

 

Mechanical Properties. Mechanical compression tests of sHA-BDDE (? = 3) were 



154 

 

performed using a Universal Testing Machine, MTS model 810-Flex Test 40 (MTS 

Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) up to 60% strain, according to Correia et 

al. (2011). The testing machine was equipped with a 1.5 kN load cell, and the loading 

rate was 5 mm/min. Young’s modulus was calculated in the initial linear section of the 

stress-strain curve, when the strain was lower than 10%.  

 

7.2.4. PRP preparation and activation 

The P-PRP (rich in platelets and poor in leukocytes) was prepared according to 

Perez et al. (2013). Briefly, whole blood (WB) was collected into 3.5 mL vacuum tubes 

(Vacuette®, Campinas, SP, Brazil) containing sodium citrate 3.2% (w/v) as an 

anticoagulant. WB was initially centrifuged in a Rotina 380R centrifuge (Hettich® 

Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 100 ? g for 10 minutes, at 25°C, After the formation 

of three layers (a bottom layer composed mainly of red blood cells (RBCs); an upper 

layer composed of plasma, platelets and some WBCs; and an intermediate layer, or 

buffy coat, composed mostly of WBCs), only the upper layer was collected to obtain P-

PRP. The concentration of platelets, WBCs and RBCs in WB and P-PRP was 

determined using the ABX Micros ES 60 hematology analyser (HORIBA ABX 

Diagnostics, Montpellier, France). 

Autologous serum (Ser) and 10% (w/v) CaCl2 solution were used as agonists to 

activate the PRP preparations (aP-PRP). The Ser was prepared by collecting 5 mL of 

WB in tubes without anticoagulant. After 30 minutes for clot formation, WB was 

centrifuged at 2000 ? g for 10 minutes The conditions of agonist/PRP=20%; Ser/CaCl2 

volumetric ratio=9 were used for getting an architecture of the fibrin network composed 

of thin fibers (average radius 65 nm), according to Perez et al., 2014).  

 

7.2.5. Release of growth factors  

Immediately after activation, aP-PRP was mixed with the mHA-BDDE or 

embedded by dripping into the sHA-BDDE, both in 48-well microplates. In all biological 

assays performed in this work, the following proportions of aP-PRP to structured HA-

BDDE were used: aP-PRP: microparticles = 200 µL:100 mg and aP-PRP: sponges = 



155 

 

200 µL:10 mg in order to guarantee the same proportion PRP to HA. After 1 hour of 

gelation, 1.5 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, 

NY, USA) with low glucose concentration was added to the composed hydrogels. The 

microplates were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 over the assays. After 

sampling, the volume was replaced with fresh medium at 3, 6, 12, 48 and 72 hours 

without removing the hydrogels from the wells. The samples were stored at -80°C until 

all samples were collected. The concentrations of the released GFs, platelet-derived 

growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1), were 

measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;amp;D Systems, 

Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and specifications. 

 

7.2.6. Association of mHA-BDDE or sHA-BDDE with P-PRP and h-

AdMSCs-seeding 

The pre-cultured h-AdMSCs were trypsinized and resuspended in P-PRP to a 

final cell concentration of 1 x 104 cells/mL. P-PRP containing h-AdMSCs was activated 

and immediately pipetted onto the surface of the microparticles or embedded into the 

sponges, both in 24-well tissue culture plates. The plates were kept at room temperature 

for 45 minutes for consolidation of the fibrin network. The cells seeded in fHA or in sHA 

were used as controls.  

 

7.2.7. h-AdMSCs cultivation 

Cultivation of the h-AdMSCs was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates, by 

adding 1 mL of the culture medium (DMEM) to the seeded structures (n=4). The culture 

was maintained at 37°C for 10 days. Cell proliferation was quantified using the thiazolyl 

blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. At 2, 4, 7 and 10 cultivation days, the substrates 

were removed and transferred to 24-well plates. MTT (1 mL of 1 mg/mL) was then 

added, and the cultivation proceeded at 37°C for 4 hours. The MTT solution was then 

discarded, and 1 mL of DMSO was added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The 

samples were shaken at 120 rpm for 30 min to ensure homogeneous dissolution of the 

formazan dye, and then 200 µL of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. 



156 

 

Optical density was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (FilterMax F5 

Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The cell concentration was obtained from the 

previously built calibration curve.  

 

7.2.8. Images of the cell-seeded composite scaffolds 

Images of cell-seeded composite scaffolds were obtained by scanning electron 

microscopy after 5 days of h-AdMSCs proliferation. The substrates were fixed in a 

solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 hours. The 

samples were than dehydrated in ethanol for 15 min intervals in aqueous 50%, 70%, 

95% and 100% ethanol solutions (2x) and dried at the critical point dryer BAL-TEC CPD 

030 (BAL-TEC®, Schalksmühle, Germany). After gold coating in a Sputter Coater 

POLARON, SC7620 (VG Microtech, Ringmer, UK), the samples were visualized with a 

scanning electron microscope Leo440i (LEO Electron Microscopy/Oxford, Cambridge, 

UK) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. 

 

7.2.9. Induction of osteogenic differentiation 

The seeded h-AdMSCs were induced to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage 

by providing the osteogenic medium containing DMEM-LG supplemented with 10% 

FBS, 1% ?-glycerol-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% L-ascorbic acid 

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 

MO, USA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin solution (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The 

medium was changed every 7 days.  

 

7.2.10. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) 

The level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity produced by h-AdMSCs was 

determined as an osteogenic marker on day 14 under differentiation conditions. Two 

hundred microliters of the supernatant was collected and mixed with 200 ?L of p-

nitrophenyl phosphate (SIGMAFAST™ p-Nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets, Sigma, Saint 

Louis, MI, USA) as substrate and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. 

Absorbance was read immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm. 



157 

 

 

7.2.11. Statistical analysis 

Each experiment was carried out in triplicate unless otherwise specified. All 

results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The experimental data 

from all the studies were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistical 

significance was set to p-value ? 0.05.  

 

7.3. Results and Discussion 

 

7.3.1. Experimental design 

In this study, we associated P-PRP to HA-BDDE structured into microparticles or 

sponges. First, the synthesized HA-BDDE was characterized by FT-IR to guarantee the 

absence of toxics non-bound chemicals before building the microparticles or sponges. 

Secondly, the structural and mechanical properties of the structured HA-BDDE were 

characterized and evaluated for cell compatibility. The association was obtained by 

mixing the microparticles or embedding the sponges with immediately activated P-PRP 

in a 24 well microplates. P-PRP was obtained by centrifugation to about twice the 

concentration relative to WB. Activation of P-PRP was performed by Ca+2 and 

autologous serum to obtain fibrin network architectures with thin fibers and an average 

radius of approximately 65 nm. This type of fiber favors proliferation of h-AdMSCs due to 

its paracrine nature for the cells. The release of the GFs (PDGF-AB and TGF-?1) was 

evaluated in DMEM culture medium. Cell seeded in the fibrin network alone or 

associated with HA-BDDE structured into microparticles or sponges was obtained by 

adding pre-cultured h-AdMSCs to P-PRP before activation. An in vitro examination of 

kinetics of h-AdMSCs proliferation was determined after 10 days of cultivation, whereas 

ALP activity as an osteogenic marker was evaluated under differentiation conditions 

after 14 days of cultivation. 

 

7.3.2. Chemical modifications  

The chemical modifications of HA crosslinked with BDDE were identified in FTIR 



158 

 

spectra of the HA-BDDE by the characteristic peak for BDDE appearing in 1310 cm-1, 

which was attributed to the stretch ether (?C-O, 1320-1100 cm-1) and in 1460 cm-1 

attributed to CH2 deformation (Silverstein et al., 1974; Kim et al., 2014). These results 

ensure the absence of free BDDE before structuring in microparticles or sponges. 

 

7.3.3. Physicochemical and mechanical properties of HA forms  

At physiological pH, the HA and its derivatives are hydrated extensively by water 

because the water forms hydrogen bonds with the N-acetyl and carboxyl groups. The 

dipole attraction of the hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group results in HA’s affinity for 

retaining water. The swelling capacity is dependent upon concentration, crosslinking 

density, and the processes used for hydration.  

The crosslinking reduced the water swelling in the HA-BDDE structures providing 

stability to HA (highly soluble), although they still exhibit high levels of water uptake, as 

shown in Table 4 by the SR values: 43.2 ± 0.7 (sHA-BDDE) and 28 ± 2 (mHA-BDDE). 

The larger hydration capacity of the sponges was attributed to its porous structure, 

which can retain unbound water (Collins &amp;amp; Birkinshaw, 2008; Shimojo et al., 2014).

The stability in PBS of the structures was studied by means of gravimetric 

analyses in terms of remaining weight up to 14 days incubation [Figure 36(a)]. Most of 

the weight reduction (~40%) of HA-BDDE sponges was observed until the seventh day, 

whereas most of the weight reduction (~40%) of HA-BDDE microparticles was observed 



159 

 

in the third day. The sHA did not retain their shape during incubation becoming a 

viscous gel.  

We also evaluated the cytotoxicity of HA-BDDE structures by MTT method 

[Figure 36(b)]. The results showed that the HA-BDDE structures exhibit a good 

compatibility to the cells, not only because the proliferation was greater than the positive 

toxicity control (PTC), but it was also significantly higher than positive control NTC 

(p&lt;0.05).

0.5%. Mean ± standard deviation n = 3. The population means are significantly different 

from positive control at p&lt;0.05.  

Due to the nature of the assay, the higher cell number for mHA-BDDE could be 

justified due to their greater surface area available for cell adhesion compared to fHA. 

Moreover, the fewer number of cells for sHA-BDDE may indicate limitations in cell 

migration due to the porous structure created by the crosslinking. 

 

7.3.3.1. mHA-BDDE  

The mHA-BDDE [Figure 37(a)] exhibited typical gel-type mechanical spectra, with 



160 

 

G’ higher than G” in all studied ranges and both moduli lying parallel to the frequency 

axis (Ikeda &amp;amp; Nishimari, 2001).  

The shear viscosity spectra of HA-BDDE showed a pseudoplastic behavior 

[Figure 37(b)], while fHA 1% is a Newtonian fluid. The pseudoplastic behavior is an 

important parameter in injectable applications, where the flow viscosity should be lower 

than the rest viscosity.

The microparticles showed a mean diameter (Table 4) around 160 ?m, which is 

adequate for an injectable application (&lt;700 ?m) (Shimojo et al., 2013; Kablik et al., 

2009).  

G’ values were around 3000 Pa in 1 Hz that are out of the adequate range (100-

700 Pa) for injectable application. Therefore, they should be dispersed in a fluid phase 

or to have the crosslinking degree decreased to fit in the required range (Shimojo et al., 

2013; Kablik et al., 2009). 

In addition to viscoelasticity, the injectable scaffolds must have an extrusion force 

to allow their easy injection through an appropriately sized needle (27-30 g needle) and 



161 

 

thereby prevent side effects such as pain (Shimojo et al., 2013; Kablik et al., 2009). The 

crosslinking increased the extrusion force of HA-BDDE (78 ± 7 N) compared to fHA 1% 

(4.3 ± 0.1 N) as expected (Table 4), however, it was not adequate for injectable 

applications (&lt;20 N) (de Melo et al., 2012; Öhrlund et al., 2010).  

Thus, the G’ and extrusion force values obtained indicated the need to adjust the 

formulation for injectable application by adding a fluid phase and/or decreasing the 

degree of crosslinking (Shimojo et al., 2013). 

In this work, we utilized aP-PRP in different volumetric ratio as fluid phase. We 

observed that the addition of the activated P-PRP maintained the pseudoplastic gel-type 

behavior of composite and adequate the rheological properties with reduction of G’, as 

required. The volumetric ratio mHA-BDDE/aP-PRP 1:2 was more suitable for fit the 

requirements for injectable application. (G’ in 1Hz = 503 Pa). This volumetric ratio was 

maintained in the biological assays. 

 

7.3.3.2. sHA-BDDE  

The results of compression test (Table 4) showed that the crosslinking improved 

to mechanical resistance of the sHA-BDDE compared to non-crosslinked sHA. The 

Young’s modulus value (~14 kPa) was higher for the sHA-BDDE than for the sHA with 

the same porosity (~97%).  

The porosity is also an important aspect of cell migration and proliferation, 

guiding and promoting the formation of new tissue. A porosity higher than 90% and pore 

interconnectivity are basic requirements for scaffolds in tissue engineering because they 

affect the diffusion of physiological nutrients and gases to and the removal of metabolic 

waste and by-products from cells that have penetrated the scaffold (Leong et al., 2003; 

Liu &amp;amp; Ma, 2004). The porosity values of sHA-BDDE and sHA obtained in this study, both 

around 97%, are adequate for tissue, engineering, particularly for bone tissue. 

The cross-section morphologies of sHA-BDDE and sHA obtained by SEM are 

shown in Figure 38. In both cases, highly porous structures were formed, confirming the 

determined values for porosity in Table 4. However, the structure of HA-BDDE sponges 

has more open round pores [Figure 38(a)], whereas the sHA has a leaf structure [Figure 

38(b)].

scaffold and (b) sHA.  

 

Although there is a large distribution of sizes, sHA-BDDE showed pores around 

200 ?m, which is adequate for regeneration of hard tissues (Salgado et al., 2004). 

Moreover, because human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AdMSCs) 

exhibit a spindle-like shape and are 80–100 ?m in diameter and ~200 ?m in length, the 

range of pore sizes in sHA-BDDE allows cells to migrate freely into the scaffolds, 

favoring the formation of a new tissue (Chavez-Munoz et al., 2013). 

These values were slightly larger than the ones reported by La Gatta et al. (2013) 

(70-130 µm) for the matrices crosslinked with comparable equivalents of BDDE. This 

difference may be due to the differences in processing conditions that used 

heterogeneous conditions for preparation.

7.3.4.2. Release of growth factors 

The release kinetics of PDGF-AB and TGF-?1 from the structured HA associated 

with activated P-PRP in DMEM are shown in Figure 40.  

The curves show parallel diffusive profiles, indicating no collapse of the structure 

during the assays. The maximum TGF-?1 and PDGF-AB release was not observed up 

to 72 hours of assay.  



164 

 

For PDGF-AB, we observed a slower release from P-PRP/HA-BDDE than from P-

PRP alone for the first 48 hours. For TGF-?1, we did not observe significant differences 

in the release profiles during the assay time. 

The release of the most of GFs occurred in agreement with the degradation time 

of the scaffolds as could be observed in Figure 40 and Figure 36(a).

PDGF-AB (a) and TGF-?1 (b). (?) PRP activated with serum/Ca+2 was used as control; 

(?) sHA-BDDE; (?) mHA-BDDE. The GFs were measurements from activated P-PRP 

containing average platelet concentration 495,000 pq/mm3.  

 

7.3.4.3. Proliferation of h-AdMSCs and ALP activity 

The kinetic profiles of proliferation were determined for h-AdMSCs cultured in the 

presence of composite scaffolds in 10 days, in comparison with fHA and the activated 

PRP alone [Figure 41(a)].  

At a macroscopic observation, the scaffolds appeared homogeneously colored 

after the MTT treatment at each tested time thus supporting the presence of living and 

metabolically active cells. The cell number per well determined after 2 days exceeded 

the number of seeded cells (1.4 x 104 cells/ well) in the structures associated to PRP, 

meaning that the cells kept in the matrices retained their viability.  

Although the cell proliferation was not intense in the composite scaffolds, it was 

higher than in fHA. The association of PRP with the structures reduced cell proliferation, 



165 

 

compared with the fibrin network (activated PRP alone), mainly for the crosslinked mHA-

BDDE and sHA-BDDE. 

In counterpart, the structured HA promoted the ALP activity [Figure 41(b)], an 

early osteoblastic marker, which reflected both the population of viable cells and the cell 

differentiation. The ALP activity was remarkable in mHA-BDDE. Although the necessity 

of determining other factors, the ALP activity points out to the structured HA associated 

to PRP is promising for osteogenic regeneration. 

These results point to the opposite directions of the proliferation and ALP activity, 

which require more detailed studies regarding its mechanisms in the presence of growth 

factors and the composite scaffolds.

7.4. Conclusions 

 

Novel composite scaffolds were prepared from hyaluronic acid crosslinked with 



166 

 

1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether and structured in sponges and microparticles, in 

association with activated platelet-rich plasma. The crosslinked structures improved the 

physicochemical, mechanical and biological properties as compared to free hyaluronic 

acid. Thus, our results provide evidences that the composite scaffolds are promising 

biomaterials for future clinical use in tissue engineering, with perspectives for osteogenic 

regeneration. The flexibility to obtain injectable formulations (microparticles) or solid 

sponges expands their applications.

Abstract. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of UV irradiation, plasma radiation, 

steam and 70% ethanol treatments on the sterilization and integrity of auto-crosslinked 

hyaluronic acid (HA-ACP) structured in microparticles or sponges. The integrity of the 

microparticles was characterized by rheological behavior, while for the sponges it was 

characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

and differential scanning calorimetry. The effectiveness of the sterilization treatment was 

verified by count of microorganism colonies in the samples after the treatments. In 

conclusion, plasma radiation was the best treatment for the sponges, while steam 

sterilization in autoclave at 126°C (1.5 kgf/cm2) for 5 minutes was the best one for the 

microparticles.

8.1. Introduction 

Hyaluronic acid (HA) and its crosslinked derivatives have been widely used as 

scaffolds for tissue engineering (Collins and Birkinshaw, 2013; Unterman et al. 2012). 

Sterilization is of fundamental importance for storage as well as for in vitro and in vivo 

applications. 

Several sterilization methods have been used for the sterilization of natural 

polymers structured as scaffolds for cell culture. These methods use dry heat, high-

pressure vapor, ethylene oxide gas, supercritical carbon dioxide or radiation treatments 

(Danillof et al. 2009). An efficient treatment must provide sterility to the scaffold 

preserving its structure (Faraj et al. 2011). 

HA and its crosslinked derivatives are heat-sensitive and sensible to ?-rays, 

presenting chemical degradation and depolymerisation with a decrease of molecular 

weight average (Rehakova et al. 1994). Besides degrading effects, the porous structure 

of scaffolds can be destroyed because of plastic deformation from the heat treatment 

(Plikk et al. 2006). 

Moreover, since scaffolds usually have a porous structure, a sterilization method 

must penetrate materials without leaving residues (Siritientong et al., 2011; Plikk et al. 

2002). 

In this study, we evaluated the effects of different treatments (70% ethanol; UV 

irradiation; plasma radiation and steam) on sterilization and the integrity of auto-

crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA-ACP) structured in microparticles or sponges. The 

integrity of the microparticles was characterized by rheological behavior, while for the 

sponges it was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform 

infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The effectiveness of the 

sterilization method was verified by colonies counts of microorganisms after the 

treatments.

8.2. Materials and Methods 

8.2.1. Materials 

HA in sodium form (MW = 2 x 106 Da) was obtained from Spec-Chem. Ind. 

(Nanjing, China). All other reagents were purchased from Synth® (Diadema, SP, Brazil) 

unless specified otherwise.  

 

8.2.2. Methods 

8.2.2.1. Preparation of the HA-ACP scaffolds  

HA-ACP preparation. The auto-crosslinked HA was prepared by an 

autoesterification reaction according to protocol described by Bellini et al. 2001. HA-TBA 

(tetrabutylammonium hyaluronate) with a molecular weight of approximately 2 x 106 Da 

and corresponding to 10 mEq of monomeric units was solubilized in 50 mL of 

dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 25°C. Triethylamine (0.5 mEq) was added and the 

resulting solution was agitated for 30 minutes. A solution of 2-chloro-1-methyl pyridinium 

iodide (CMPI) (0.5 mEq) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 15 mL of DMSO was 

slowly added drop by drop over 1 hour and the mixture was kept at 30°C for 15 hours. A 

solution of sodium chloride 2.5% (w/v) was then added and the resulting mixture was 

poured slowly into 150 mL of acetone, maintaining continual agitation. The formed 

precipitate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed three times in 100 mL 

of 5:1 acetone: water and three times with 100 mL of acetone and vacuum-dried for 24 

hours at 30°C.  

 

Preparation of structured HA-ACP scaffolds. The HA-ACP scaffolds structured in 

microparticles (mHA-ACP) or sponges (sHA-ACP) were prepared from plain HA-ACP 

swollen in Milli-Q water. The microparticles were obtained by shearing in an Ultra-Turrax 

T25 homogenizer (IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) at 18,000 rpm by 20 minutes, 

according to Shimojo et al. 2013. For preparation of the sponges, the microparticles 

were initially placed in polystyrene 48-well microplates (TPP®, Trasadingen, 

Switzerland), frozen at -20°C and lyophilized at controlled temperature of approximately 

-30°C for 48 hours. 



174 

 

 

8.2.2.2. Sterilization Treatments 

HA-ACP microparticles were submitted to UV-irradiation, plasma radiation, 

steam, 70% ethanol treatments, aiming sterilization or disinfection. HA-ACP sponges 

were submitted to the same treatments except to steam. Non-treated scaffolds were 

used as control. 

 

Ethanol Treatment. The HA-ACP scaffolds were disinfected with 70% (v/v) 

ethanol, according to Faraj et al. 2011. They were washed with 70% ethanol at ambient 

temperature for 3×1 h and 1×16 h. Thereafter, three short washings with sterile 

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) were performed with changes of washing fluid 

directly after one another, and finally 5×1 h and 1×16 h washings with PBS were 

performed. All washing changes were performed in a laminar flow cabinet. sHA-ACP 

was re-frozen at -20°C and lyophilized again.  

 

Plasma Irradiation. The scaffolds were evacuated and then, a pressure of 1 Torr 

was established with the introduction of argon (Ar) gas that combined with an electrical 

potential difference (EPD) create Ar plasma inside the chamber. This treatment was 

performed along 5 minutes. 

 

UV Irradiation. Irradiation was carried out with an ultraviolet lamp (Germetec, Rio 

de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) at 254-nm wavelength at a distance of 5 cm (UV1) and at a 

distance of 60 cm (UV2). HA-ACP microparticles and HA-ACP sponges were irradiated 

for a total time of 30 min and were turned over halfway through the treatment to irradiate 

the top and bottom surfaces.  

 

Steam. Steam treatment was applied to the microparticles only. The treatment 

was achieved by wet heating at 126°C, under a vapor pressure of 1.5 kgf/cm2 for 1, 2.5, 

5, 10 and 15 minutes in autoclave. 

 



175 

 

8.2.2.3. HA-ACP sponges characterization 

Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR). FTIR was used to identify possible chemical 

modifications on scaffolds resulting from sterilization processes. Infrared spectra were 

obtained using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet model 6700 (Thermo Scientific Nicolet™, 

Waltham, MA, USA). Measurements were made in the ATR mode with accessory 

SMART OMNI-SAMPLER, in the spectral range of 4000 – 675 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 

cm-1 over 64 scans.  

 

Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The morphology of HA-ACP sponges 

sterilized was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an LEO 440i 

Electron Microscopy/Oxford (Cambridge, England) operated at 5 kV accelerating 

voltage. The scaffolds were gold-coated using a sputter coater POLARON SC7620, VG 

Microtech (Uckfield, England) for 180 s at a current of 3 mA.  

 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal characterization of the 

scaffolds was achieved by DSC using a Mettler-Toledo DSC1 (Mettler Toledo Co., 

Zürich, Switzerland) module under a nitrogen atmosphere (nitrogen flow rate 50 mL/min) 

with a sample mass around 10 mg and a heating rate of 10°C/min.  

 

8.2.2.4. HA-ACP microparticles characterization 

Rheological properties. HA-ACP microparticles sterilized were evaluated by 

rheological properties. The measurements were performed on a Rheometer Haake 

model RheoStress 1 (Haake, Karlsruhe, Germany). The properties of the scaffolds were 

characterized in the steady and oscillatory regimes at 25oC, using a parallel plate 

geometry of 20 mm. Oscillatory measurements were conducted in the linear region, at a 

stress of 1.188 Pa and in the frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz. Steady shear 

measurements were obtained at shear rates of 0.1-50 s-1.  

 

8.2.2.5. Sterility Tests  

All the scaffolds were tested for sterility for heterotrophic bacterial, molds and 

yeasts, immediately following the treatments using a standard assay (Method 61, USP – 



176 

 

2012).  

 

8.3. Results and Discussion 

 

8.3.1. Effects of the treatments on physicochemical properties of the HA-

ACP sponges 

The effects of the treatments on HA-ACP sponges were evaluated by scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  

The micrographs of sponges obtained by SEM (Figure 42) showed that except to 

ethanol disinfection [Figure 42(e)], the scaffolds remained their porous structure without 

major differences in morphology, regardless the treatments. Ethanol disinfection 

reduced substantially the porosity of HA-ACP sponge. Moreover, we observed loss in 

the scaffold shape by swelling after washing with PBS.

(c) UV (60 cm); (d) Plasma and (e) Ethanol disinfection. Bar = 100 µm. 

 

Figure 43(a) shows the FT-IR spectra of HA-ACP sponges. The spectra showed 

bands at 1617 and 1413 cm?1 attributed to the asymmetric (C=O) and symmetric (C-O) 



177 

 

stretching modes of the planar carboxyl groups in the hyaluronate. The absorption 

bands at about 1650, 1561, and 1320 cm?1 are characteristic of the amide I, II, and III 

band, respectively. The weak absorption band around 1740 cm?1 was attributed to the 

stretching vibration of ester groups. The three signals centered at 1150, 1072, and 1040 

cm?1 were assigned to C-O-C (O-bridge), C-O (exocyclic), and C-OH group, 

respectively. The band at 945 cm-1 was assigned to asymmetrical out-of-phase ring 

vibration. 

The spectra of HA-ACP disinfected with 70% ethanol showed a band at 990 cm-1 

attributed to C-O of primary alcohols indicating ethanol residual in the structure. 

Therefore, except for the HA-ACP disinfected with 70% ethanol, the spectra were 

very similar indicating that their chemical structure did not change significantly with the 

treatments.

The effects of treatments on the thermal behavior of the sponges are shown in 

Figure 43(b). All the scaffolds showed the presence of a broad endothermic peak 

between 150 and 160°C associated with the loss of moisture remaining after the drying 

procedure. In addition, significant sharp exothermic peaks around 220 and 245°C were 

observed, which probably represent decomposition (Collins &amp;amp; Birkinshaw, 2008). We 



178 

 

consider, none significant changes in the thermal profiles after the treatments.  

 

8.3.2. Effects of the treatments on physicochemical properties of HA-ACP 

microparticles 

Initially, we evaluated the influence of the steam treatment in autoclave, at 126°C, 

under a vapor pressure of 1.5 kgf/cm2, on the rheological properties of HA-ACP 

microparticles. The rheological behavior determined by oscillatory and steady 

measurements are shown in Figure 44(a) and 44(b), respectively.  

We observe that until 5 minutes of steam treatment, the microparticles 

maintained the gel-like behavior, as analyzed by the storage (G’) and loss moduli (G”). 

(Ikeda &amp;amp; Nishimari, 2001). Moreover, considering the Ostwald de Waele power law 

(?=K.?n-1), the flow indices (n) indicate a viscoelastic behavior that is an important 

parameter in injectable applications where the flow viscosity should be lower than the 

rest viscosity. According to the curves, we should consider no significant differences on 

rheological behavior of the microparticles up to 5 minutes of autoclave.  

After the first 5 minutes of treatment, the mechanical spectra showed a crossover 

and due to very low viscosity, it was not possible to determine the flow curve using the 

parallel plate geometry previously used. Thus, these results indicate rheological 

behavior of solution and degradation of the structure.

Figures 45a and 45b show the rheological behavior of the microparticles under 

UV1, UV2, plasma and 70% ethanol treatments. The G’ and G” profiles show that only 

the UV1 treatment, in which the ultraviolet lamp was at a distance of 5 cm from the 

sample, affected the rheological behavior of the microparticles [Figure 45(a)]. Moreover, 

there was a drastic decreased of shear viscosity [Figure 45(b)]. This behavior was 

attributed to degradation of HA by the high UV intensity due to the very small distance 

between the lamp and the sample.

8.3.3. Sterility evaluation  

Tables 5 and 6 show the results of the sterility test for the sponges and the 

microparticles, respectively. The counts of colonies indicated that 70% ethanol 

disinfection and UV2 treatment were the least effectives, while plasma radiation and 

UV1 were the most effective treatments for the sponges (Table 5).

Comparing the effects of the treatments on the sterilization and physicohemical 

properties of the sponges and microparticles, our results showed that sterilization by 

plasma radiation was the most efficient treatment for sterilizing the auto-crosslinked 

hyaluronic acid sponges because it ensures the sterility and preserve their chemical 

composition and 3-D morphology. In contrast, the steam treatment in autoclave (at 

126°C, 1.5 kgf/cm2) up to 5 minutes was the method most adequate for sterilization of 



181 

 

the auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid microspheres, because it did not change their 

rheological properties.  

 

8.4. Conclusion 

The sterilization by plasma radiation was the most efficient treatment for 

sterilizing the auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid sponges, while the steam treatment in 

autoclave (at 126°C, 1.5 kgf/cm2) during 5 minutes was the most efficient treatment for 

the microspheres. Thus, these methods can be used for sterilization of ACP structured 

scaffolds.

CAPÍTULO 9 – CONCLUSÕES 
 

9.1. Conclusões 

 

Neste trabalho foram preparados e caracterizados os seguintes scaffolds 

compósitos de quitosana (CHT) e/ ou ácido hialurônico (AH) estruturados em esponjas 

(aP-PRP/PCHTs, aP-PRP/SPCHTs, aP-PRP/ACPs, aP-PRP/HA-BDDE e aP-

PRP/PECs) e micropartículas (aP-PRP/iCHT-TPPs, aP-PRP/ACPs, aP-PRP/HA-BDDE 

e aP-PRP/PECs).  

A efetividade in vitro dos scaffolds compósitos, foi avaliada através da cinética de 

liberação de fatores de crescimento (PDGF-AB e TGF-?1) do P-PRP em meio DMEM, 

proliferação e diferenciação de h-AdMSCs através do marcador osteogênico fosfatase 

alcalina (ALP). 

O desempenho individual dos scaffolds foi apresentado nos artigos e na patente 

que compõem este trabalho. 

Os resultados obtidos permitem as seguintes conclusões gerais:  

? Os polímeros naturais CHT e AH podem ser estruturados em esponjas ou 

micropartículas que atuam como scaffolds para o PRP em formulações sólidas 

(esponjas) ou fluidas injetáveis (micropartículas), com diferentes propriedades 

físico-químicas e mecânicas.  

? As esponjas apresentaram elevada porosidade (&gt;90%), alto grau de 

intumescimento adequados para a migração e proliferação celular e resistência 

mecânica adequada ao manuseio e cultivo celular. 

? As micropartículas apresentaram propriedades reológicas e mecânicas 

adequadas para a injeção.  

? Para os scaffolds de CHT estruturados em esponjas, a estabilidade em termos 

de perda de massa com o tempo em PBS foi atribuída à presença de acetato 

residual, enquanto que nas micropartículas foi atribuída ao grau de reticulação. 

Nos scaffolds de AH, a estabilidade refletiu somente do grau de reticulação.  

? Todos os scaffolds preparados neste trabalho não apresentaram citotoxicidade. 

? Nas esponjas a rede de fibrina formou-se preferencialmente no interior dos 

poros, enquanto que nas micropartículas a partição da rede de fibrina entre o 

interior e a superfície das partículas foi dependente da sua rigidez, a qual é 



184 

 

função do grau de reticulação. 

? A liberação dos fatores de crescimento (PDGF-AB e TGF-?1) foi 

predominantemente difusiva em todos os scaffolds. A maior parte dos fatores 

(~80%) foi liberada nas primeiras 12 horas em concordância com a estabilidade 

dos scaffolds. 

? A proliferação de h-AdMSCs foi maior ou igual a do PRP para as esponjas de 

ambos os polímeros, exceto quando reticuladas com TPP (CHT) ou BDDE (AH). 

Nas micropartículas, a proliferação foi menor em relação ao PRP e dependente 

da dureza e grau de reticulação. 

? A capacidade das h-AdMSCs para a produção do marcador de diferenciação 

osteogênica ALP foi favorecida nas micropartículas em relação às esponjas.  

? A capacidade de diferenciação osteogênica apresentou uma tendência oposta à 

proliferação celular.  

? A radiação por plasma foi o processo mais adequado para a esterilização por 

das esponjas de ACP, enquanto que o tratamento com vapor em autoclave 

(126°C, 1,5 kgf/cm2), até 5 minutos foi o processo mais eficaz para as 

microesferas de ACP. 

Embora a reprodutibilidade de produção dos scaffolds e o cultivo celular possam 

ser bem controlados pelas condições operacionais, a comparação precisa do 

desempenho dos vários scaffolds é complexa por contemplar os fatores inerentes ao 

PRP, tais como a variabilidade da concentração de plaquetas e fatores de crescimento 

de diferentes doadores nos vários ensaios.  

Assim, concluímos que os scaffolds compósitos preparados neste trabalho são 

promissores para engenharia de tecidos, particularmente para a cicatrização e 

regeneração óssea, no âmbito da medicina regenerativa. 

 

9.2. Trabalhos Futuros 

 

? Minimização da variabilidade do PRP para uma precisa comparação do 

desempenho dos scaffolds. 

? Produzir e caracterizar scaffolds com diferentes tamanhos e formatos para 

ensaios pré-clínicos. 

? Estender os estudos realizados com P-PRP para o L-PRP (plasma rico em 

plaquetas e em leucócitos). 

? Estudar a influência das esponjas e micropartículas na ativação do PRP.  



185 

 

? Caracterizar as interações moleculares entre a rede de fibrina e os scaffolds.

ANEXO 1 
 

COMPOSIÇÃO E FORMULAÇÃO DE SCAFFOLDS DE ÁCIDO HIALURÔNICO E 

QUITOSANA PARA ASSOCIAÇÃO COM PLASMA RICO EM PLAQUETAS E SEUS 

USOS EM TERAPIA REGENERATIVA  

 

A presente invenção refere-se a scaffolds compostos de ácido hialurônico (AH) e 

quitosana (CHT) em formulações sólida ou fluida (injetável), para associação com 

plasma rico em plaquetas (PRP), em aplicações no campo da medicina regenerativa, 

mais especificamente no campo da ortopedia. Nas formulações sólidas os polímeros 

são estruturados em esponjas e nas formulações fluidas em micropartículas. A 

invenção baseia-se no fato de que a associação de PRP ao ácido hialurônico livre tem 

sido amplamente usado na clínica, em tratamento de lesões musculoesqueléticas. 

Ensaios in vitro mostraram que a estruturação do AH autorreticulado ou de quitosana 

estabilizada em esponjas ou micropartículas, promoveu a liberação gradual dos fatores 

de crescimento provenientes do PRP, estimulou a proliferação de células tronco 

mesenquimais humanas de tecido adiposo, assim como a osteogênese. A associação 

do PRP com os scaffolds melhorou a estabilidade da rede de fibrina, e a estruturação 

em esponjas ou micropartículas melhorou as propriedades mecânicas em relação aos 

polímeros livres. Entretanto, a elevada densidade de carga negativa do AH reduz a 

adesão celular que interfere na regeneração tecidual, enquanto que a elevada carga 

positiva da CHT pode resultar em danos celulares in vivo. Nesse contexto, a presente 

invenção que trata de scaffolds de AH autorreticulado e quitosana para associação com 

PRP evidencia que esses scaffolds constituem biomateriais para uso clínico que 

beneficiam as aplicações do PRP em terapia regenerativa.
