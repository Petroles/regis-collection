Abstract

Hydraulic fracturing emerges currently, all over the world, as one of the 
more strategic techniques used by companies in the oil exploitation sector. This 
technique is characterized by its high productivity and profit in relation to conven-
tional methods of hydrocarbon exploitation. However, in many countries, as is 
the case of Brazil, there are several divergences considering the employment of this 
methodology. Many renowned researchers attest that there are several irrevers-
ible environmental impacts generated by the use of this methodology. Among the 
main environmental impacts are the risk of groundwater level contamination, the 
risk of surface subsidence, and the risk of the environment contamination with 
fluids used in the process of the oil and gas extraction.

Keywords: hydrocarbons; hydraulic fracturing; exploitation, environment.

Resumo

A técnica de estimulação por fraturamento hidráulico desponta, atualmente, 
como uma das principais estratégias utilizadas pelas empresas do setor de exploração 
de petróleo para o aumento da sua produção. Contudo, em alguns países, como é o 
caso do Brasil, existem discordâncias quanto à empregabilidade desse método, tendo 
em vista, sobretudo, os prováveis riscos que podem estar associados à utilização do 
mesmo. Verificou-se que, em relação à questão econômica, as principais vantagens 
estão relacionadas ao aumento da produtividade. Contudo os pesquisadores salien-
tam que as principais desvantagens em relação a esse método estão relacionadas às 
questões ambientais. Entre os principais riscos, estão a possibilidade de contamina-
ção da água e do solo, os riscos de subsidência, a contaminação do meio com os 
fluidos provenientes desse processo, entre outros.

1. Introduction

 The modern society has experi-
enced a constant and inevitable dilemma 
regarding reduction in use of non-
renewable resources and the adoption 
of cleaner technologies. Thus, the oil 
industry has invested in new technolo-
gies, such as the technique of hydraulic 
fracturing or fracking in order to reduce 
financial and labor costs, and maximize 

the production of hydrocarbons, par-
ticularly natural gas. The first references 
concerning hydraulic fracturing was 
reported in l947 in a sedimentary rock 
field of oil in the United States and some-
time after (in 1954) in the former Soviet 
Union. Currently, this methodology is 
used extensively in several producing 
fields in order to stimulate hydrocarbon 

reservoirs (SILVA et al., 2002). This 
technique allows an increase in the 
productivity of an oil well, doubling or 
even quadrupling rate of productivity. 
Data from the United States show that 
the use of this methodology expanded 
rapidly after 2005, when the EPA (U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency) 
authorized the use of the hydraulic frac-

turing. Since this date, there has been 
a significant increase in the number of 

wells drilled (WENZEL, 2012). Table

of shale gas in the USA in the period 
2000-2010.

In North America, almost 70% 
of the natural gas production will be 
produced by hydraulic fracturing in 
the near future. Hydraulic fracturing 
and horizontal drilling apply the most 
advanced technologies and are economi-
cally the most viable in terms of oil and 
gas recovery from the shale rocks. In 
the United States, 45% of the domestic 

production of natural gas and 17% of oil 
production would not have been recov-
ered (in a period of 5 years) if hydraulic 
fracturing had not been used. (THE 
ROYAL SOCIETY, 2012). Shale min-
eral deposits such as Bakken, Barnett, 
Montney, Haynesville, Marcellus and 
some recently denominated ones such 
as Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Utica have 

been drilled, completed and fractured 
using this method (McNutt, 2011). Hy-
draulic fracturing is being currently used 
in 90% of oil and natural gas wells in the 
United States (WENZEL, 2012). Table 
2 shows an estimate of mineral reserves 
( in 1012 ft3) that can be recovered by 
using hydraulic fracturing technique all 
over the world.

However, there are many uncer-
tainties about the environmental damage 
of this methodology and mainly about 
the harmful effect that hydraulic frac-
turing may have on the environment as 
a whole including the surrounding eco-
systems (MCNUTT, 2011). According 
to WELLE (2013) hydraulic fracturing 

is yet a very controversial theme world-
wide. Some European countries such as 
Ireland, Czech Republic, Romania, Ger-
many and Spain have recently declared a 
"moratorium" relating to the use of this 
methodology. In Brazil, the Brazilian 
Petroleum Agency - ANP- is nowadays 
monitoring these issues, and several Non-

Governmental Organizations (NGO's) 
are also discussing this theme in their 
agenda. The non-governmental agency 
Greenpeace has officially pronounced 
itself to be against the use of the method. 

Hydraulic fracturing is a stimu-
lation technique used to increase the 
productivity of oil wells which basically

consists of injecting a pressurized fluid 
into the rock formation (around the well) 
in order to create new pathways to fa-
cilitate the hydrocarbon flow in the well.

A key element for successful hy-
draulic fracturing is a properly con-
structed well. During the drilling and 
completion process, appropriate tech-
niques should be used to isolate the 
groundwater to avoid damages to the 
reservoir and to the well.

The more critical aspects of a well 
construction are the selection and ap-
plication of the appropriate casing and 
cementation. To provide the necessary 
protection, three steps are usually taken 
into account to isolate the well interval 
of rock that has been penetrated during 

the drilling process.
In the phase I, a drill hole is made 

until the base of the soil or unconsolidat-
ed material. A steel casing or conductor 
tube is inserted into the hole and cement-
ed in place. At this stage, an artificial 
barrier is automatically created to prevent 
the mixture of fluids, gravels and sands 
and to avoid the falling of these materials 
down in the hole. The well is then drilled 
until the depth defined by the regulatory 
agencies (EPA in the USA) obeying envi-
ronmental aspects. This depth is gener-
ally below the base of groundwater and 
in a region of the rock mass with rocks of 
good quality. In phase II, a second set of 
steel casing (surface casing) is cemented 
to the interior of the well throughout 

the entire perforated vertical interval. 
In phase III, the well is drilled until the 
total depth. In some cases, depending 
on the total depth and azimuth of the 
well, a set of linear intermediary casing 
can be inserted and cemented into the 
well. Once the well is drilled until the 
depth of the intersection zone contain-
ing the hydrocarbon, other steel tubes 
are inserted into the well. The second (or 
third) set of tubes is usually cemented in 
place to isolate the hydrocarbon zone. In 
some cases, the covering is cemented in 
place and above the intersection zone to 
avoid damage to the oil formation. Figure 
1 shows an example of the construction 
of a well for application of the hydraulic 
fracturing technique.

Example of hydraulic

 fracturing for shale development

During the productive life of an 
oil well interventions are always neces-
sary to maintain or even improve the 
productivity. Thus, the technique of 
hydraulic fracturing has been presented 
as an exceptional alternative in terms of 
productivity improvement and costs re-
duction. In the oil industry stimulation 
operations such as hydraulic fracturing, 
are widespread. However, due to the dif-
ferent characteristics of each formation 
or project, not all wells are suitable to 
be stimulated. Thus, within the same 
oil field, wells may be or not may be 
undergoing this type of operation.

Although the operations of well 
stimulation are practiced frequently, 

the problem of selecting wells is still 
relevant and is increasingly gaining 
importance in the current mineral 
scenario. The process of selecting wells 
for stimulation involves the analysis 
of various parameters and depends on 
technological resources. An incorrect 
interpretation of the parameters of the 
well or a failure in the planning of the 
operation may cause serious conse-
quences in the production of an oil field. 
The use of hydraulic fracturing of a rock 
formation with success is still a great 
challenge to mining and petroleum engi-
neers. Several researches has been made 
in the last decade using artificial intel-
ligence techniques to map existing data 

and build productive artificial systems 
in order to try to maximize the results of  
specific mine operations. Nevertheless, 
it should be noted that there is still no 
consensus among specialists regarding 
the use of this technology.

Many researchers allege that this 
method can offer various risks to the 
environment. Experts warn that among 
the main environmental impacts are 
contamination of water and soil, risk 
of explosion because of methane gas 
release, excessive water consumption, 
and use of chemical products in the flu-
ids used in the technique. Some techni-
cians also attest that this technique can 
indirectly induce tectonic movements.

Perspectives for use of hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production

2. Some definitions

Hydraulic fracturing is a stimu-
lation technique used to increase the 
productivity of oil wells. This technique 
is the most effective treatment for sand-
stone layers found in older and con-
solidated sediments. The main reasons 
for the increase of productivity of this 
technique are restructuration of the flow 
model, improvements in the rock mass 
permeability and possibility of reaching 
distant areas with better permeability 
and more porous conditions. In naturally 
fractured and lenticular reservoirs, this 
technique facilitates the interconnection 
between the parts. The physical principle 
of this technique consists in an injection 
of a special fluid at very high pressure in 
the reservoir rock, changing the state of 
tension in the rock mass and provoking 
the opening and or/ expansion of the 
existing fractures or discontinuities of 
the original rock mass. To sustain the 

openings, a supporting agent is injected 
to maintain the fractures open, creating 
artificial permeability. This process is 
done specially in oil fields that have al-
ready reached their peak of production 
or have low permeability, thus presenting 
a low recovery factor.

The technique is described as fol-
lows: a hydraulic fracturing is formed by 
pumping a fracturing fluid into the well 
at a pressure high enough to increase 
the pressure in the well, exceeding the 
fracture gradient (pressure gradient) of 
the rock mass. The fracture gradient is 
defined as the increase in pressure per 
unit of depth, due to the specific weight 
of rocks and is usually measured in 
pounds per square foot or bar per meter. 
The fracture must be sufficiently perme-
able to allow the flux of formation fluids 
into the well. Formation fluids include 
gas, oil, salt water, fresh water and other 

fluids introduced into the formation dur-
ing fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing 
equipment used in oil fields and natural 
gas generally consists of a mud mixer, 
one or more high pressure devices, large-
volume pumps and a monitoring unit. 
Auxiliary equipment includes tanks, one 
or more units for storage and propellant 
handling, a chemical additive unit (used 
to accurately monitor chemical addi-
tion), low pressure tubes, and devices 
to evaluate fluid density and pressure. 
The fracturing equipment operates over 
a vast range of pressures and injection 
rates, and can reach up to 100 MPa 
(15,000 psi) and 265 liters per second 
(100 barrels per minute). Due to its high 
rate of success and financial return, hy-
draulic fracturing treatments are usually 
performed as soon as the drilling phase 
is made and a low permeability of the 
reservoir rock formation is confirmed.

3. Potential for gas exploration in Brazil

The International Energy Agency 
(IEA) classifies Brazil in 10th position 
in the ranking of the world's largest 
reserves of shale gas. 

The Brazilian Agency of Petroleum 
made a public auction for shale gas 
exploration on November 28, 2014. 
On this occasion ANP designated 240 
blocks for shale gas exploration in a 
group of 7 geological basins. The geo-
logical basins available in this auction 

were: Parecis, Parnaíba, Recôncavo, 
Paraná, São Francisco, Acre and Ser-
gipe. As a result, only 72 blocks were 
auctioned including 49 to Petrobras.

According to an ANP evaluation, 
this method can certainly increase the 
production of natural gas in Brazil, but 
as yet, it still has high costs and complex 
operations to be adapted in the country 
over the next years (WELLE, 2013).

ANP data demonstrate the use 

of conventional hydraulic fracturing 
operations in Brazil since 1950. These 
data reveal that more than six thousand 
operations were performed using low 
pressures and flow rates without severe 
incidents. These data also reveal what 
the Brazilian experience lacks in terms 
of high pressures and volumes, as is 
the case of the USA where shale gas 
represented more than 20% of the gas 
production in 2010 (WELLE, 2013).

4. Results

The image profiles are similar to 
"photographs" of the wall well and are 
based on the resistive and acoustic char-
acteristics of the rock formations. The 
analysis of these images generate much 
information to be used in reservoir char-
acterizations, such as layer inclination, the 
occurrence of fractures and discontinuities 
in general, underground landslides, mag-
nitude and direction of in situ stresses, 
lithology, geological discordances, areas 
with thin layers, low porosity and under-
ground caves. This information can thus 
be used in conjunction with other profiles, 

samples and production reports to model 
the reservoirs (FÉLIX ET AL., 2008).

LAGE et al. (2012) executed a study 
related to the exploitation of unconven-
tional gas in view of the American experi-
ence, and analyzed the perspectives for the 
market for the Brazilian reality. Based on 
this study, they concluded that the uncon-
ventional reserves mapped in Brazil must 
play a very important role in the energetic 
matrix of the country, considering that 
the reserves are located onshore and can 
contribute to the gas market, internalizing 
the use of gas all over the country.

Gomes et al. (2005) described a gel 
based on non-ionic surfactants used for 
hydraulic fracturing.

SANTOS AND CORADESQUI 
(2013) made an analysis of the economic 
viability of shale gas production based 
on the case of Fayetteville, in the United 
States. The authors concluded that the 
additional costs due the use of hydraulic 
fracturing can be high. Considering the 
gas prices of 2013 the profitability of new 
projects for the production of shale gas in 
the United States was questioned by the 
referred authors.

5. Conclusions

There are only a few studies related 
to hydraulic fracturing as an alternative 
to conventional exploitation of hydrocar-

bons in Brazil.
Hydrocarbons frequently accumu-

late in an oil trap after the geological 

processes of formation and migration. 
The reservoir is the portion of this trap 
containing oil and gas that is hydrauli-

cally connected and forms a unified 
system. The reservoir rock, in principle, 
can have any origin or nature, but to 
constitute a reservoir, the rocks must 
present voids (porosity) and these voids 
must be interconnected to provide the 
adequate permeability (SANTOS AND 
CORADESQUI, 2013). As referred to by 
the aforementioned authors, conventional 
reservoirs rocks are porous and permeable 
reservoirs that contain fluids of low and 
medium viscosity. Sandstones and lime-
stone are typical examples of conventional 
reservoir rocks.

High costs and complexity produc-
tion in the oil industry has stimulated the 
development of new techniques to substi-
tute the conventional methods. Hydraulic 
fracturing is an excellent example of an 
unconventional method because it allows 
oil and gas extraction from some wells 
that would be economically unviable by 
traditional methods.

According to American Society of 
Petroleum Engineers, around 2.5 million 
procedures of hydraulic fracturing were 
done worldwide, of which one million 

were only in the United States of America. 
Furthermore, tens of thousands of hori-
zontal wells have been drilled in the last 
60 years (WOOD AND ROJAS, 2000).

According to GROTHER (2000) 
his technique has great economic and 
social potential for hydrocarbon pro-
duction in the USA. The main benefits 
would be more profits for landowners, 
oil companies and investors, together 
with the creating of more jobs. (FELIX 
ET AL., 2008). 

Most environmentalists believe that 
the most significant environmental risks 
are the contamination of groundwater 
due the opening of an unsuccessful well 
“blowouts”, generating leaks and spills 
of wastewater and chemicals. In their 
defense, oil companies argue that the 
method of hydraulic fracturing has been 
used safely for decades (SANTOS AND 
CORADESQUI, 2013).

Another public concern is the earth-
quakes. Seismic monitoring is an essential 
tool to ensure that hydraulic fracturing in-
duces micro-seismic activity (only within 
the reservoir to be explored). The society's 

confidence in the safety of hydraulic frac-
turing would be higher with a systematic 
seismic monitoring and publication of 
the results for the inhabitants (SANTOS 
AND CORADESQUI, 2013). Although 
the process of hydraulic fracturing creates 
a large number of micro-seismic events or 
micro tremors in the earth, the magni-
tudes of these are too small to be detected 
at surface. The larger micro-earthquakes 
have a magnitude of only about 1.6 on 
the Richter scale (FERNANDES, 2008). 

Another important environmental 
impact is related to the fluids used in the 
stimulation process. The fluids used in 
hydraulic fracturing are typically com-
posed of more than 98% of water and 
sand. The other reagents are chemicals 
used as thickeners and friction reducers 
to protect the casing. Preventive measures 
should be taken to avoid that these chemi-
cals impact surface water and soil during 
transportation, storage and disposal. The 
usual percentages of the substances in 
the stimulation fluid are water and sand 
(99.51%), and other chemical additives 
in general (0.49 %) as listed in Table 3.

Industries, regulatory agencies 
and environmentalists believe that these 
problems can be solved with the use of 
the best practices of exploration, drilling 
and exploitation. Thus, researches and 
investments in new technologies, to-
gether with monitoring and strict regula-

tions, are essential. Certainly, the major 
challenge for all involved in the shale gas 
and oil production in the coming future 
will be to ensure the protection of the 
environment, health and public safety 
while the shale exploitation increases 
(SANTOS AND CORADESQUI, 2013). 

The United States is the best example 
and has been successfully applying this 
technique for decades.

The main economic advantages of 
this method are high productivity, job 
opportunities, and increased income for 
the whole society, among others.
