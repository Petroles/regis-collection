Abstract
Nest site has influence on incubation duration and hatching success of two Neotropical turtles, the Giant Amazon 
River Turtle (Podocnemis expansa) and Yellow-Spotted Side-Neck Turtle (Podocnemis unifilis – “Tracajá”). The 2000 
and 2001 nesting seasons have been monitored at the Javaés River in Bananal Island, Brazil. Although they nest on 
the same beaches, there is a separation of the nesting areas of P unifilis and P. expansa nests on the upper parts of the 
beach. The incubation duration for P. expansa is influenced by the nesting period, the height of the nest from the river, 
the clutch size, and the grain size in the site of the nest. Nests of Podocnemis expansa placed in coarse sediments have 
shorter incubation duration than those placed in finer sediments. The hatching success in P. expansa is influenced 
by grain size, incubation duration, and nesting period. The grain size is negatively correlated with hatching success, 
indicating that the nests situated in finer-grained sand have better chances of successful egg hatching than those in 
coarser-grained sand. Nests of the end of the reproductive season have lower hatching success and incubation duration 
than those at the start of the season. For P. unifilis, the nesting period and nest depth influence the incubation duration; 
moreover, the river dynamics significantly affect the hatching success. 
The oscillation of the river level and the moment of initial increase, the height of the nest from the river level, and the 
nesting period are all decisive components for hatching success. The results of this research show the importance of 
protecting areas with great geological diversity, wherein the features of the environment can affect the microenviron-
ment of nests, with consequences on incubation duration and hatching success.

Ecologia reprodutiva de Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812) e  
Podocnemis unifilis (Troschel, 1848) (Testudines, Podocnemididae) no Rio Javaés, Brasil

Resumo
O local da desova influencia a duração da incubação e o sucesso de eclosão de duas tartarugas neotropicais brasileiras, 
a tartaruga-da-amazônia (Podocnemis expansa) e o tracajá (Podocnemis unifilis). Monitoramos as estações reproduti-
vas de 2000 a 2001 nas praias do Rio Javaés na Ilha do Bananal. Apesar de as duas espécies desovarem nas mesmas 
praias, existe uma separação entre as áreas de desova, com P. expansa desovando nas partes mais elevadas das praias. 
A duração da incubação de P. expansa foi influenciada pelo período da desova, pela altura do ninho em relação ao 
nível do rio, pelo número de ovos e pelo tamanho do sedimento. Ninhos de P. expansa localizados em sedimentos 
mais grossos apresentaram uma menor duração da incubação. O sucesso da eclosão de P. expansa foi influenciado 
pelo tamanho do sedimento, duração da incubação e período da desova. O sucesso da eclosão se correlacionou nega-
tivamente com o tamanho do sedimento indicando que ninhos situados em areias mais finas têm maiores chances de 
eclodirem. Ninhos do final da temporada reprodutiva têm menor sucesso de eclosão e menor duração da incubação. 
Para P. unifilis, a duração da incubação é influenciada pelo período da desova e a dinâmica fluvial exerce grande efeito 
no sucesso da eclosão. A oscilação do nível do rio Javaés e o período da desova foram decisivos para o sucesso da 
eclosão.
Os resultados ressaltam a importância da proteção de áreas com maior diversidade geológica onde as variáveis am-
bientais podem afetar o microambiente dos ninhos com reflexos na duração da incubação e no sucesso da eclosão dos 
filhotes.

though both species nest in the same beaches, there is 
a spatial separation of their nests. In the Javaés River, 
P. expansa lays its eggs in the highest point of the beach, 
usually 300 cm above the river level, whereas P. unifilis 
concentrates its nests in areas less than 150 cm above 
the river level. The clutch size, nesting period, and incu-
bation duration also vary between the species (Pritchard 
and Trebbau, 1984).

Data concerning nests located along the Javaés 
River, in the Araguaia National Park, located in the 
central-eastern region of Brazil in Tocantins State were 
collected. The study site (50° 05’ W and 9° 59’ S) was 
located in the northern part of Bananal Island, approx-
imately 25 km from the mouth of the Javaés River in 
the Araguaia River. This area is one of the main nest-
ing areas for P.  expansa and P. unifilis and harbours the 
chelonian monitoring and protection headquarters of the 
RAN/IBAMA (Reptile and Amphibian Conservation 
and Management Centre, an organisation associated 
with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural 
Renewable Natural Resources). The dimensions of the 
beach vary in length from 800 to 3,450 m and in width, 
from 160 to 470 m.

Geomorphologically, all the beaches monitored in 
the area can be classified as sandbanks. The nests receive 
direct sunlight during a major portion of the day and only 
some nests located near the riparian forest are shaded in 
the late afternoon. The beaches are deprived of vegeta-
tion, except for rare and scattered bushes.

The mean river level was calculated based on data 
provided by the National Electric Energy Agency 
(ANEEL) from 1972 to 1999. During the years 2000 and 
2001, the level of the Javaés River along the beaches was 
determined and it was monitored only during the nest-
ing and hatching periods. Every day, the river level was 
recorded on the beach opposite the camp, which was lo-
cated between the beaches under study. 

In 2000, the Canguçu, Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, 
Coco, and Marreca beaches were monitored; and in 
2001, the Canguçu, Comprida, Coco, Goiaba, and Bonita 
beaches were examined. The beaches studied were 
changed from one year to the next due to the territorial 
demands of the local Indian tribes inhabiting Bananal 
Island. A detailed description of the main beaches may 
be found in the report by Ferreira-Júnior and Castro 
(2003).

Data in relation to incubation duration and hatch-
ing success were collected during the months of August 
and December in the reproductive seasons of 2000 and 
2001. The incubation duration is defined as the time be-
tween egg-laying and emergence of the first hatchling 
from the nest. Hatching success is defined as the ratio 
of the number of hatchlings to the number of eggs laid. 
Nesting period is the time of egg-laying (Julian dates). 
The beaches were monitored each morning to search for 
tracks that would indicate the presence of nests. To ob-
tain the data on hatching success and incubation duration 
of P. unifilis, it was necessary to protect the nests from at-

1. Introduction

Incubation duration is frequently used as an indica-
tor of metabolic activity in the embryonic development 
of turtles, which show temperature-dependent sex de-
termination. Several investigators have reported that the 
incubation duration in turtles is negatively correlated 
with the incubation temperature (Ewert et al., 2004; 
Valenzuela, 2001). The incubation duration is consid-
ered the easiest and least invasive method to estimate the 
sex ratio of the sea turtle hatchlings because the defini-
tion of their sex depends on environmental conditions 
(Marcovaldi et al., 1997; Mrosovsky et al., 1999). In 
turtles, low temperatures induce low metabolic activity, 
longer incubation durations, and a greater proportion of 
males. These authors, who suggest the use of incubation 
duration as an indicator of sex ratio, are unanimous in 
pointing out their concern and need for a broad model to 
absorb climatic variations. Incubation temperature and 
consequently incubation duration, may be affected by 
the mineralogical composition of the sediment (Milton 
et al., 1997), grain size (Souza and Vogt, 1994; Ferreira-
Júnior and Castro, 2006a), albedo (Hays et al., 2001), 
nesting date (Baptistotte et al., 2003), nest depth (Souza 
and Vogt, 1994), and nest shade (Vogt and Bull, 1984; 
Alho et al., 1985), which affect the sex ratio of the hatch-
lings. Both Podocnemis expansa (Alho et al., 1985; 
Valenzuela et al., 1997; Valenzuela, 2001; Malvasio, 
2001) and Podocnemis unifilis (Souza and Vogt, 1994) 
have temperature-dependent sex determination, indicat-
ing the importance of the nest site on the resulting sex 
ratios.

Environmental factors may differently affect the 
hatching success of different populations of the same 
species. In general, factors such as flooding (Alho and 
Pádua, 1982; Pezzuti and Vogt, 1999; Ferreira-Júnior 
and Castro, 2005; 2006b), shade cover, nest depth 
(Wilson, 1998; Valenzuela, 2001), incubation tempera-
ture (Bobyn and Brooks, 1994; Öz et al., 2004), soil 
moisture (Packard et al., 1987), and type of soil (Packard 
and Packard, 1997) may affect hatching success.

We tested the hypothesis that both the incubation 
duration and the hatching success of P. expansa and 
P.  unifilis can be affected by the geological characteris-
tics of the nesting place. The grain size, height of the nest 
from the river level and moment of increasing river level 
were correlated to incubation duration and hatchling suc-
cess to test if the nesting period and nest site influence 
the turtle’s reproductive success.

2. Materials and Methods

Both P. expansa and P. unifilis are widespread in 
South America, occupying principal rivers and afflu-
ents in the Amazon Region. Podocnemis expansa and 
P.  unifilis lay their eggs in sandbanks (denominated 
beaches) that appear throughout the margins and inside 
channels during the dry seasons (Pritchard and Trebbau, 
1984). Ferreira-Júnior and Castro (2003) report that al-

3. Results

3.1. Basic parameters of the nests

During the nesting seasons in 2000 and 2001, there 
were 447 egg-laying activities of P. expansa and 1068 of 
P. unifilis (Table 1). At Coco Beach in 2000 two nests of 
P. expansa hatched after only 38 days of incubation and 
a success rate of 91.8% and 93.4%, higher than average 
of all other nests (85.4%).

The nesting period differed between different spe-
cies in 2000 (n = 623, t = 72.9, p &amp;lt;0.001) and 2001 
(n = 503, t = 27.9, p = 0.005). The concentrated nesting 
in P. expansa was a consequence of the gregarious habit 
of the species, members of which usually climb up the 
beach in large groups during nesting activity (Alho and 
Pádua, 1982). Although P. unifilis does not form groups 
to lay its eggs, nesting peaked in August, when 50% of 
the eggs were laid within nine days (Figure 1)

Mean height of egg placement from the level of the 
Javaés River differed between the two species (n = 860, 
p &amp;lt;0.001). Podocnemis expansa nested in the upper 
parts of the beach (301.4 ± 86.74 cm above the river lev-
el, range 71-625 cm, n = 359), whereas P. unifilis nested 
in the lower sites (104.8 ± 80.19 cm, range 9-467 cm, 
n = 501) (Tables 1 and 2).

For P. expansa, the incubation duration, the clutch 
size, the clutch depth, and the height of the nest from 
the river level varied significantly along the monitored 
beaches (Table 1). For P. unifilis, the incubation duration, 
the clutch depth, the hatching success, and the height of 
the nests from the river level varied significantly along 
the beaches (Table 2).

3.2. Basic physical parameters

In the period from 1972 to 1999, the river reached 
its lowest level between 29 September (in 1995) and 
14 November (in 1993). In the years 2000 and 2001, the 
lowest level was reached between these dates, thus per-
mitting important observations regarding the influence 
of the dynamics of the river on the hatching success of 
P. unifilis. In August 2000, when P. unifilis nested high 
on the beaches, the river level lowered slowly at a rate of 
1.5 cm/day. In 2000, the peak nesting of P. expansa oc-
curred in September, coinciding with a slight increase in 
the river level, which started to subside during the follow-
ing days (Figure 2). In 2000, all the protected P.  unifilis 
nests completed incubation without flooding. In 2001, 
the increase in the river level on 30th September flooded 
72 of the protected nests (18% of the total) (Figure 2).

The grain size varied significantly among the 
beaches and the granulometric variation of P. expansa 
nests (n = 244) was greater when compared to that of 
P. unifilis nests (n = 189). For P. expansa, only the peb-
ble and mud proportions remained fairly constant for all 
beaches, probably due to the small ratio of these com-
ponents in comparison to the whole sample (&lt;0.5% of 
both fractions). For P. unifilis, the proportions of very 
coarse sand, coarse sand, fine sand, and very fine sand 

tacks by vultures (Coragyps atratus and Cathartes aura) 
and hawks (Carcara plancus) with wire-screened shel-
ters. For calculating the hatching success in P. unifilis, 
nests lost due to bird predation were excluded because 
this analysis was focused on how the physical environ-
ment affects incubation. All P. unifilis nests considered 
herein were protected by wire-screened shelters. 

The height of the nest from the river level consisted of 
two categories: a) height during the nesting time, which 
reflected the conditions encountered by the turtles dur-
ing nesting activity, and b) maximum height of the nests, 
to establish a common standard level along the beaches. 
Height of the nest from river level was measured with a 
5-mm-accuracy level. The maximum height of the nests 
was recorded on November 1, 2000, and September 30, 
2001. On these two days, the Javaés River reached its 
lowest level, which was considered as a reference, al-
lowing the comparison of nest heights along the various 
beaches in the following years.

Sedimentary samples, weighing around 200 g, were 
collected from each P. expansa and P. unifilis nest. The 
sediments were collected at a depth of 10 cm during the 
collection of hatchlings. The sediments were sieved and 
classified according to the Folk/Wentworth (Folk, 1974) 
scale, which involves the following divisions: peb-
ble (diameter &gt;4 mm), granule (4-2 mm), very coarse 
sand (2-1 mm), coarse sand (1-0.5 mm), medium sand 
(0.5-0.25 mm), fine sand (0.25-0.125 mm), very fine 
sand (0.125-0.063 mm), and mud (&lt;0.063 mm).

Comparisons of incubation duration, hatching suc-
cess, nesting period, nest depth, and nest height between 
the different species were carried out using the Student-t 
tests. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA one-way, followed 
by the Bonferroni post hoc test) was used to compare 
these variables among the beaches when the data showed 
a normal distribution. For datasets that significantly 
strayed from the average, differences were examined by 
the Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA on Ranks, 
followed by the Dunn post hoc test. The variables ex-
pressed in percentage (hatchling success and grain size) 
were transformed to arcsen before being submitted to the 
ANOVA. The effects of nesting period, nest depth, nest 
height from the river level, and clutch size on the incuba-
tion duration and hatching success for each species were 
analysed through multiple linear regression. All data are 
provided as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Analysis of grain-size influence on the incubation 
duration and hatching success required a separate treat-
ment. Each of the granulometric portions was considered 
a quantitative and independent variable. To avoid colin-
earity among the granulometric fractions, some portions 
were removed from the data analysis. Kruskall-Wallis 
nonparametric ANOVA on Ranks, followed by the Dunn 
post hoc test, was used to analyse the effects of the grain 
size of P. expansa and P. unifilis nests along the beaches. 
The influence of grain size on incubation duration and 
hatching success was also tested by multiple linear re-
gressions.

tion to the river level. In 2000, maximum hatching of 
P. unifilis eggs occurred before November when the level 
of the Javaés River was still decreasing (Figure 2). In 
2001, the hatching occurred mostly in the beginning of 
November, when the river level was high (Figure 2). The 
nests most affected by flooding were those laid at the 
end of the nesting period and those situated in the lowest 
parts of the beaches. The significant difference in hatch-
ing success of P. unifilis between 2000 (92.2%) and 2001 
(58.3%) was due to beach flooding. The grain size did 
not influence the hatching success of P. unifilis.

The small depth of P. unifilis clutches facilitates at-
tacks by vultures (Coragyps atratus and Cathartes) and 
hawks (Carcara plancus). Predation occurs, mainly, dur-
ing the first hours after egg-laying. There is also high 
predation of the P. unifilis hatchlings because predators 
are able to locate the nests after hatching takes place, at-
tacking the nests before the hatchlings can leave the nest. 
In the two years under study, 1068 P. unifilis nests were 
found, and 462 were protected and/or managed during 
the experiments conducted by research teams working in 
the area. Of the remaining 606 nests, only seven (1.16% 
of the total) concluded the incubation without any pro-
tection efforts.

4. Discussion

Geological characteristics of the nesting sites of 
P. expansa and P. unifilis were significantly different. 
The two species nested in different areas of the beaches 
in Javaés River, with very little overlap. Podocnemis 
 expansa nested in the upper areas of the beach near the 
riparian forests, whereas P. unifilis nested in areas closer 
to the river channel, preferably close to the base of the 
dunes (Ferreira-Júnior et al., 2003). Lowest river level 
is a basic requisite for P. expansa nesting activity on 
the Trombetas River, as pointed out by Alho and Pádua 
(1982) and Ferreira-Júnior and Castro (2003) for the 

varied among the beaches. In general, the beaches could 
be divided into sandbanks consisting of well-selected 
medium sand (Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, Marreca, and 
Goiaba Beaches) and poorly selected medium and coarse 
sand (Canguçu, Bonita, and Coco Beaches). The beaches 
with finer sediments were more elevated than those with 
coarser sediments.

3.3. Factors related to the incubation duration

For P. expansa, significant correlations were found 
between incubation duration, nest height from river lev-
el, nesting period, and clutch size (Table 3). There was a 
negative correlation between sediment size and incuba-
tion duration of P. expansa in the years 2000 and 2001. 
Coco Beach, where the mean incubation duration was 
54.2 ± 4.48 days, contained the coarsest sediments in the 
study area, and Jaburu Beach (mean incubation duration 
of 68.0 ± 7.70 days) constituted the sandbanks with the 
finer sediments.

Only the nesting period and the clutch depth af-
fected the incubation duration of P. unifilis (Table 3). 
Podocnemis expansa and P. unifilis nests, formed in the 
end of the reproductive season, had higher incubation 
duration. None of the granulometric portions were corre-
lated to the incubation duration of P. unifilis, suggesting 
that the grain size did not affect the incubation duration.

3.4. Factors related to hatching success

Hatching success of P. expansa was affected by the 
incubation duration, nesting period, and grain size. The 
incubation duration and nesting period were negatively 
correlated with hatching success of P. expansa (Table 4). 
Nests structured at the end of the nesting season, and 
with shorter incubation duration, had lower rates of 
hatching success. Nests placed in coarser sediments had 
lower rate of hatching success than those placed in finer 
sediments.

Hatching success of P. unifilis depended directly 
on the nesting period and the height of the nest in rela-

Table 3. Influence of biological, physical, and geologic factors on the incubation duration of P. unifilis and P. expansa in 2000 
and 2001. (P. expansa in 2000, R2 = 0.431 and 2001, R2 = 0.797; P. unifilis in 2000, R2 = 0.405 and 2001, R2 = 0.118).

to higher temperatures (Spotila et al., 1987; Eendebak, 
1995; Marcovaldi et al., 1997). Both higher and lower 
incubation temperatures can cause embryonic death 
(Krause et al., 1982; Wilson, 1998; Valenzuela, 2001). 
As P. expansa nests filled at the end of the reproductive 
period had shorter incubation duration with concurrent 
higher temperature, embryonic death increased.

In the area under study, P. expansa has nests only in 
sandy open beaches. On the contrary, P. unifilis is less 
selective and nests in open beaches, lake margins, and in 
vegetated areas. Data on P. unifilis is only partially rep-
resentative, and it should not be generalised for the en-
tire population. This fact should be especially considered 
when analysing the nest predation, which is higher than 
98% (Ferreira-Júnior and Castro, 2003). Other turtles, 
such as Chrysemys picta (Tinkle et al., 1981), Malaclemys 
terrapin (Burger, 1976), and Tryonyx muticus (Plummer, 
1976), which lay eggs in shallower nests, show high nest 
predation. However, in none of these examples is the pre-
dation higher than that along the studied area. It is dif-
ficult to maintain a stable population under this intense 
predation (Congdon et al., 2000). In the vegetated areas, 
the predation should be less, according to the observa-
tions of other freshwater turtle species (Escalona and Fa, 
1998; Spencer, 2002). The intense predation along the 
Javaés River beaches is attributed to the type of predator. 
Vultures and hawks patrol the beaches daily during the 
incubation and hatching periods, detecting nests of sev-
eral ages. Even nests without any evidence of their exist-
ence on the surface are found and predated. In contrast to 
the observations related by Pezzuti and Vogt (1999) for 
P. sextuberculata, predation is independent of the density 
of P. unifilis nests. Both types of nests, those dispersed 
along the beaches and concentrated nests, were similarly 
attacked.

Javaés River. Eggs laid during the months of August and 
September had a higher incubation temperature in both 
P. expansa and P. unifilis, because embryonic develop-
ment would occur during the warmest season of the year. 
For these turtles, an approximate one-month nesting 
phase and distinct incubation periods (Figure 1) made 
it possible for their hatching to coincide with an increas-
ing river level. Podocnemis unifilis hatched earlier, at the 
end of October, when the Javaés River began to flood the 
lower parts of the beaches. Podocnemis expansa hatched 
later, in the months of November and December; how-
ever, because its nests are usually located higher on the 
beach, there is usually sufficient time for the hatchlings 
to leave their nests.

One of the principal causes for the loss of fresh-
water turtle nests is associated with changing river lev-
els over the years. Flooding is common in the case of 
P.  expansa, P. unifilis, and P. sextuberculata nests found 
along the beaches of Peruvian (Mitchell and Quiñones, 
1994; Soini, 1995), Colombian (Hildebrand et al., 1988), 
and Brazilian rivers (Alho and Pádua, 1982; Pezzuti and 
Vogt, 1999; Ferreira-Júnior and Castro, 2003; 2006b). 
Floods are also the main cause of nest loss of Trionyx 
muticus (Plummer, 1976) and Emydoidea blandingii 
(Standing et al., 1999). Considering the Javaés River, 
the beaches are high enough to assure the hatching of 
P. expansa nests, and the river-level oscillation has no 
significant impact on the hatching success of this popula-
tion. In contrast, P. unifilis nests are greatly influenced by 
changing river levels.

The timing of nesting affects embryonic develop-
ment because, indirectly, it is responsible for the climatic 
conditions during the incubation period (Mrosovsky and 
Provancha, 1992; Valenzuela, 2001). In 2000, P. expansa 
nests laid at the end of the nesting period had shorter 
incubation duration, suggesting that they were subject

Therefore, management projects that involve egg 
collection from P. unifilis nests localised on the lower 
beach (Mitchell and Quiñones, 1994; Páez and Bock, 
1998) should be analysed with caution. Nest flooding 
does not seem to follow a rigid pattern and its magni-
tude depends on difficult-to-predict factors such as the 
start of the rainy season and its intensity (Ferreira-Júnior 
and Castro, 2003; 2005; 2006b). The nests located in the 
lower portions of the beach are submitted to greater soil 
moisture and a more stable temperature than those in the 
higher portions of the beach (Ferreira-Júnior and Castro, 
2006a). As such, the reproductive strategy of P. unifilis 
can be altered by selective egg collection. In species with 
a long reproductive period, the loss of some seasons does 
not result in significant effects on population stability 
(Congdon et al., 2000). The management projects that 
involve P. unifilis-transfer hatcheries should also consid-
er the height of the nests from river level. Generally, the 
hatcheries are located in the higher parts of the beach, 
altering the characteristics of the hydric environment. It 
is suggested that P. unifilis hatcheries should be located 
in an area near the river, within a height of around one 
metre. The inconvenience of this position is that a rising 
river level might put the nests at risk, thus requiring an-
other transfer. Nevertheless, this is the most recommend-
ed alternative, because the physiographic conditions of 
the nests will then be preserved.

Nests of P. expansa situated in fine sediments 
(Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, Marreca, and Goiaba beach-
es) have longer incubation duration than those located 
in coarser sediments (Canguçu and Coco beaches). This 
fact has been well illustrated with a difference of 14 days 
between the average incubation durations of P. expansa 
on the Coco and Jaburu beaches in 2000. This observa-
tion has important consequences for projects that involve 
nest transfer. As the incubation duration of P. expansa is 
affected by the grain size of the nest, the nests should not 
be transferred into a single and homogeneous hatchery. 
As presented by Milton et al. (1997) and Naro-Maciel 
et al. (1999), variations in the characteristics of hatchery 
sediments (such as grain size and mineral composition) 
could cause alteration in temperature during incubation 
and consequently affect the sex ratio of the hatchlings. 
As can be judged, it is desirable for the hatcheries to 
maintain the sediment characteristics similar to those of 
the origin of the nest.

The importance of the nesting place, mainly of the 
grain size, is enhanced for P. expansa when compar-
ing distinct beaches in geological terms. Internally, the 
beaches show homogeneity in the grain sizes, which can 
little influence the incubation duration and the hatching 
success. But when one compares the effect among vari-
ous beaches, the influence increases, reflecting the im-
portance of evaluating all the nesting sites and more than 
one reproductive season. While extending the area of the 
research and different geological environments, the dif-
ferences among the physiographic characteristics and its 
influence on the reproduction of the turtles are reflected, 

which cannot occur in the case of only one beach or one 
reproductive season being considered.
