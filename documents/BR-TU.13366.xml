resumo 
 
 

Os materiais cerâmicos à base de cordierite são normalmente usados como
materiais refractários devido às propriedades que possuem, tais como,
excelente expansão térmica e elevada resistência ao choque térmico. Os pós
precursores consistem numa composição estequeométrica de minerais à base 
de alumina, talco, ?-quartzo, K-feldspato, caolinite e mulite, bem como uma 
pequena quantidade de calcite, cristobalite e fases vítreas derivadas da
moloquite, obtidas pela calcinação da caolinite a elevadas temperaturas
(1550ºC). 
Os corpos em verde consolidados por enchimento por barbotina foram 
sinterizados ao ar a diferentes temperaturas: 1050, 1150, 1250, 1350, 1425 e
1500°C. Os resultados obtidos por difracção de Raios-X mostraram que a 
cristalização ocorre entre 1250 e 1350ºC e que a composição inclui não só
cordierite mas também mulite, alumina e quartzo residual. Aumentando a
temperatura de sinterização para 1500ºC, a única fase cristalina detectada é a
mulite, juntamente com uma elevada fracção de porosidade envolta por uma
abundante fase vítrea.   
Além dos efeitos originados pela temperatura, a sinterização é também
dependente do tempo. Por este motivo, o tratamento térmico foi efectuado ao
fim de 2, 4 e 8 h de patamar de modo a relacionar as composições obtidas
com o tempo de sinterização. As composições obtidas à base de cordierite-
mulite-alumina apresentam baixo coeficiente de expansão térmico 2~4x10-6/K 
e resistência à flexão relativamente elevada, 90~120 MPa. As amostras
sinterizadas a 1250ºC durante 2 e 4 h apresentam os valores mais elevados de
resistência ao choque térmico (?T~350-400 K). 
 
Além destas propriedades, os materiais à base de cordierite também
apresentam baixa constante dieléctrica (entre 5 e 10) e um baixo factor de
perda dieléctrica, o que faz deles materiais com forte potencial para aplicações
em circuitos integrados como substratos dieléctricos. A constante dieléctrica
em função da temperatura foi medida desde a temperatura ambiente até
600ºC, tendo-se verificado estabilidade das propriedades dieléctricas a 1 MHz
em toda a gama de temperaturas testada.   
 
 
As propriedades reológicas das suspensões à base de cordierite foram 
optimizadas de forma a obter uma boa impregnação do polímero. As
propriedades mecânicas das espumas cerâmicas obtidas pelo método de
replicação da espuma polimérica foram caracterizadas com base nas 
propriedades dos cerâmicos densos. O módulo de Young foi determinado pelo 
método de excitação por impulso. A teoria micro-mecânica para materiais 
heterogéneos conhecida como método de “Mori-Tanaka” foi aplicada para 
estimar o módulo efectivo das espumas cerâmicas. Dos resultados obtidos
verifica-se um desfasamento entre os valores experimentais (1~2 GPa) e os 
teóricos (6~7 GPa). A tomografia computadorizada por Rais-X foi usada para 
estudar a estrutura tridimensional (3D) das espumas cerâmicas por análise de 
elementos finitos (FEA). As propriedades elásticas foram estudadas pelo
cálculo da força de reacção na deformação elástica. Embora a estrutura
tridimensional calculada das espumas cerâmicas represente apenas uma
pequena fracção da estrutura, os resultados mostram que a correlação entre
eles é fortemente melhorada pelo método de Mori-Tanak. A razão apontada 
para o desfasamento é a existência de uma estrutura interna oca, que não é
tida em conta no modelo utilizado. Por outro lado, o método CT mostra que a 
estrutura porosa e a diferença no microestrutura poderá também ser simulada.
O resultado da análise de elementos finitos mostrou que as espumas
cerâmicas são muito quebradiças, o que é consistente com a observação
experimental obtida nos testes de compressão.

abstract 
 

Cordierite ceramics have excellent thermal expansion and thermal shock 
resistance for applications such as refractory materials. The precursor powder 
consisted of a non-stoichiometric composition of minerals containing corundum, 
talc, ?-quartz, K-feldspar, kaolinite and mullite as well as small amount of 
calcite, Cristobalite and glass phases probably derived from molochite, 
produced by calcining kaolinite at high temperature (1550 ºC). The green 
consolidates were sintered in air at 1050, 1150, 1250, 1350, 1425 and 1500°C. 
It was discovered by XRD that cordierite crystallization takes place between 
1250 oC and 1350 oC while the composition includes not only cordierite but also 
mullite and alumina and residual quartz. At 1425oC, the ceramics consisted of 
cordierite and mullite. With further increasing the sintering temperature to 1500 
oC mullite was the single crystalline phase detected, together with a high 
porosity fraction embedded in an abundant glassy phase. Besides the 
temperature effects, sintering was also time-dependent, therefore heat 
treatment was conducted for 2, 4 and 8 h to study the sintering time–
composition relationships. The cordierite-mullite-alumina heterogeneous 
ceramics were obtained with low thermal expansion coefficient of 2~4x10-6/K 
and relatively high flexural strength of 90~120 MPa. Thermal shock resistance 
measurements demonstrated that the samples sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h and 
4 h exhibited the highest thermal shock resistance values (?T~350-400 K). 
 
Cordierite ceramics also exhibited very low dielectric constant (between 5 and 
10) and low dielectric loss factor, showing a good potential for low dielectric 
substrate applications in integrated circuits. The dielectric constant as function 
of temperature was measured from RT to 600oC, demonstrating to have very 
stable dielectric properties at 1 MHz across the entire temperature range.  
 
The cordierite slurries were prepared with optimized rheological properties and 
impregnation conditions to coat the polymer struts by dip casting. The 
mechanical properties of ceramics foams fabricated by polymer replica method 
were characterised on basis of properties of bulk ceramics. The foam’s 
effective Young’s modulus was determined by Impulse excitation method. 
Micro-mechanical theory for heterogeneous material known as “Mori-Tanaka” 
method was applied to model the effective modulus of ceramics foam. The 
results showed that the agreement was not good between experimental (1~2 
GPa) and modelling (6~7 GPa) data. In the meantime, Computed X-ray 
tomography was applied to study the actual 3D structure of ceramic foams for 
Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Elastic properties were studied by calculating 
the reaction force in elastic deformation. Although the calculated 3D structure 
of the ceramic foams represents only small fraction of the structure, the results 
showed that the agreement has greatly improved over Mori-Tanaka method. 
The reason of disagreement from the former method is the existence of internal 
hollow structure in ceramics struts, which is not taken into account in the 
model. On the other hand, CT method revealed the hollowed structure and the 
influence of such microstructure could be simulated. The FEA also showed that 
the ceramic foams are very brittle, which is consistent with the experimental 
observation under compression tests.

Chapter 1: Introduction 
 
1.1 MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (MAS) system  

 
MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (MAS) system is one of the most important mineral systems due to its 

abundance in Earth crust and mantle at ~ 88 wt.% (wikipedia). It has wide-ranging of industrial 
applications such as filler for joining SiC with excellent properties of wetting on SiC substrate 
which produced high flexural strength (342-480 MPa) up to high temperature of 800 oC [1]; kiln 
furniture due to their low density, good mechanical strength, incompressibility and thermal 
insulation properties; catalyst support [2, 3] as well as refractory material to develop components 
in rocket nozzle and coatings on turbine gas engine thanks to its excellent thermal shock 
resistance [4]. In recent years, this class of materials has attracted an increasing attention from 
foundry industry owing to the fact that ceramics foam made of MAS ceramics could be used as 
filters to molten metals in casting processes to increase the homogeneity and stability of the metal 
flow. Among them, cordierite ceramics is an interesting phase due to its excellent 
thermo-mechanical properties. Cordierite is a high temperature phase in MAS 
phase-temperature-composition diagram which was firstly studied by Rankin et al [5] in 1918. 
Therefore, cordierite ceramics are not so popular and in most cases they are only found in nature 
nearer volcanoes where high temperature is available. In Fig. 1.1 an illustration of MAS ternary 
phase diagram (TPD) is shown and several key phases are highlighted.

mullite or co-exist with alumina. The stoichiometry based on TPD in Fig. 1.1 shows monolithic 
cordierite has molar ratio of 2MgO:2Al2O3:5SiO2, hence the chemical formula of cordierite is 
Mg2Al4Si5O18. This corresponding to a composition of 13.7 wt.% MgO, 34.9 wt.% Al2O3 and 
51.4 wt.% SiO2. Under stoichiometric condition, the cordierite is crystallized at temperature 
around 1460 K or 1187 oC. However, most synthesis usually starts from powders of 
non-stoichiometric composition; consequently, cordierite, ?-quartz, corundum and mullite are 
likely to co-exist with different heating schedules. Composite of cordierite and mullite are most 
likely seen co-existing due to Mg-deficiency in the precursor and they are similar in physical 
properties, but very different in mechanical and thermal expansion coefficients. The summary of 
properties of Cordierite and Mullite as well as two other MAS materials, Corundum and ?-quartz 
are given in Table 1.1 (next page).  

 
Logvinkov et al [7] studied the phase transition between corundum, mullite and cordierite 

under heat treatment. The study analyzed the phase composition after heat treatment for 2h at 
1400 oC, 1450 oC and 1500 oC and cooled with various procedures. The heat treatment 
temperatures correspond to the subsolidus in phase diagram as seen in Fig. 1.1. In [7] the phase 
transition take places around subsolidus region and the solid state chemical reaction at four  
generic temperature ranges are summarized below:  
 

(1) T?988 oC: 
     10MgSiO3+2MgO-Al2O3=5Mg2SiO4 (forsterite)+ Mg2Al4Si5O18 (Cordierite) 

(2) 988 oC&lt;T&lt;1386 oC: 
2Mg2Al4Si5O18+15Al2O3=4MgAl2O4 (Spinel)+5Al6Si2O13(Mullite) 

(3) 1386 oC&lt;T&lt;1460 oC: 
4Al6Si2O13+ Mg4Al10Si2O23(Sapphirine)=13Al2O3+2Mg2Al4Si5O18 

(4) T&gt;1460 oC: 
4MgAl2O4+ Al6Si2O13=2Al2O3+ Mg4Al10Si2O23 

 
It appears that cordierite can be obtained at lower temperature. However, the aforementioned 

solid state reaction route is on assumption that precursor materials are pure oxides. In real cases, 
the non-stoichiometry in precursor powder could cause significantly altered results of final 
composition, for instance the cordierite will not be found around 1000 oC in reaction (1); Spinel is 
also limited to form in reaction (2) which causes deficiency of spinel in reaction (4). Therefore 
the final composition above 1460 oC is pure mullite without Sapphirine.

pressure above 6 kbar while only cordierite and mullite phases are stable to co-exist at ambient 
pressure [9]. 
 
1.2 Cordierite  

 
Cordierite was discovered by the French geologist Cordier in 1913 and named after him. 

Cordierite is considered as one of the potential materials to fabricate the advanced ceramics 
component in refractory environment and electronic industry due to its high modulus (~100 GPa), 
thermal shock resistance (?T&gt;500 K) properties, low thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) 
(~1.5x10-6/K) and low dielectric constant as well as loss factor plus potential replacement 
materials for SiO2 as substrate in electronic industry due to its similar TEC to silicon.  
 

The thermal properties of cordierite depend on its crystal structure shown in Fig. 1.2. 
Literature reports refer to two crystal systems. Low temperature cordierite has a completely 
ordered orthorhombic structure (Cccm) with unit cell parameter a~17.06 Å, b~9.74 Å, c~9.34 Å, 
?=90, ?=90, ?=90, [10-12]. At higher temperature it transforms into a hexagonal structure 
(P6/mmc) with lattice parameters a~9.7437 Å, b~9.7437 Å, c~9.3893 Å, ?=90, ?=90, ?=120 [10, 
13] with long range ordering of Al and Si stable at about 1450 °C, before melting at 1460 °C. The 
unit cells of two crystal systems are shown in Fig. 1.2 respectively. The low temperature phase is 
metastable high quartz solid solution, commonly referred to µ-cordierite and its high temperature 
phase is known as ?-cordierite with hexagonal structure that very slowly transforms to 
orthorhombic cordierite below 1450 oC following the crystallization of µ-cordierite [10].

The unit cell consists of octahedrons of Mg coordinated by 6 oxygen and tetrahedrons 
centred at Si and Al that are coordinated by 4 oxygens. However the octahedron and tetrahedron 
are geometrically asymmetric with different Mg-O-Mg, Al-O-Al or O-Mg-O and O-Al-O bond 
angles indicated in Fig. 1.3. The angle between the O and Al are 97.36o, 110.15o and 121.83o 
respectively. The Si atoms are also coordinated in tetrahedral structure however the distortion of 
the tetrahedron is less than that of Al-coordinated tetrahedrons. The angle between oxygen and 
silicon in tetrahedron are 108.67o, 110.40o, 110.34o. The octahedrons and tetrahedrons are 
interconnected within each other and form a complex molecular ring network shown in Fig. 1.4. 
The cordierite structure usually gives its bulk density (~2.5 g/cm3).

Fig. 1.4: overview of ?-cordierite crystal structure from c-axis of the unit cell 

 
The low thermal expansion coefficient of ?-cordierite is the result of its relatively ‘flexible’ 

tetrahedral ring framework, and the anisotropic expansion of the octahedral framework of 
?-cordierite structure [11]. On the other hand, the ring structure-property relation was studied by 
Mirwald et al [12] from XRD data revealing that low thermal expansion is due to the ring rather 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

than silicates framework. No indication for structural modifications correlated with symmetry 
changes was observed during heating. Hochella et al [13] attempted to correlate the thermal 
expansion properties of cordierite with structural changes as a function of increasing temperature. 
The result was found that the expansion of a particular silicate framework depends on the 
temperature response of the framework itself involving Al–O–Al and O–Al–O angular changes, 
the expansion coefficient(s) of the non-tetrahedral bonds, if present, and the interplay between 
these two factors. This interplay of the tetrahedral framework is associated with the change in 
bond angles contributing towards lower expansion in space. The general idea is rather similar that 
cordierite structure has tetrahedral unit with different angles of O-Al-O/Al-O-Al as well as 
octahedral unit with variable angle of Mg-O-Mg and O-Mg-O as shown in Fig. 1.3. The structure 
is very flexible to re-arrange in space upon heating the interatomic distance is likely to increase 
however the increase will not result in volume due to re-arrangement of the tetrahedral and 
octahedral units. This gives cordierite very low expansion in volume upon heating compared to 
other mineral with more rigid structure i.e., Alumina or metals. However, one exception is that 
diamond has also very low TEC~1x10-6/K and this is due to strong C-C bond which is highly 
resistant to thermal excitation. Hochella &amp;amp; Brown’s attempt to correlated the very low TEC of 
cordierite to silicate framework structure in terms of stuffing cation (Mg in case of cordierite) and 
bond angles in the tetrahedral framework could not find a general mechanism for framework 
structure-thermal expansion relationship and concluded that the thermal expansion in cordierite is 
complex and variable [13]. Later, Roy et al [14] revisited the works in very low thermal 
expansion materials and claimed that the Mg stuffing plays a direct role in controlling thermal 
expansion because of large variation of Mg-O bond. Furthermore, they discussed that the key 
features that very low thermal expansion materials such as cordierite must have are: i) presence of 
structural holes, ii) flexible but rigid network of strongly bonded polyhedron. These are two main 
criteria for very low thermal expansion materials that cordierite satisfies both of them.   
 

Cordierite ceramics found important applications in thermal-mechanical engineering used as 
refractory materials with the “Maximum use Temperature” up to 1371 oC (Table 1.1). It also 
shows excellent thermal shock resistance (TSR) behaviour as Oliveira et al [15] studied dense and 
foam’s TSR by rapidly transferring the specimens from resistance furnace into distilled water and 
measured the retained flexural strength. The dense cordierite ceramics show half way reduction 
(67 to 40 MPa) of flexural strength at ?T~325 K; and the flexural strength dropped to 1/3 or 1/4 
of original value at ?T=375 K [15]. Acimovic et al [16] studied the application of cordierite 
ceramics in foundry and parameters in producing refractory coating for sand mold. However, to 
the best knowledge of the author [16] the cordierite ceramics has not been put into any foundry 
application yet. Kaolinite based Cordierite was synthesized by Yamuna et al [17] and used as 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

materials for exhaust converter core thus extending the potential applications of Cordierite to 
environmental protection. 
 

Apart from thermo-mechanical engineering applications, cordierite also has high potential in 
electronic packaging. Modern electronics industry requires smaller scale integrated circuit (IC) 
therefore capacitor has to be smaller in distance. This will increase the capacitance dramatically 
and the charge collected at the capacitor will affect the operation of the IC. The industry has been 
looking for replacement to SiO2 that currently being used as IC material with lower dielectric 
constant and dissipation factor compensate the smaller distance. Cordierite is considered as one of 
candidate materials due to its low dielectric constant, e.g. ?r=5 at 1 MHz and similar thermal 
coefficient expansion of 3x10-6/K to single crystal silicon [18] plus stronger flexural strength (100 
MPa) compared to SiO2 substrate. More recently, research on cordierite electronic application has 
been done and a very low dielectric constant (5.0-5.2) and dielectric loss (&lt;0.008) [19, 20] were 
achieved from a batch sintered at 950 oC doped with 1.5 wt.%-3.0 wt.% ZnO [21, 22]. The 
thermal coefficient (3.6-4.8x10-6/K) matches well that of silicon which promises better electronic 
packaging than when SiO2 is used as substrate. The cordierite has low dielectric constant, which 
is also considered as an important requirement for mm-microwave dielectrics such as in [23] that 
Ni-substituted respective to Mg, namely (Mg1?xNix)2Al4Si5O18 cordierite has microwave 
properties such as relative lower dielectric constant (6-11), very high quality factor up to 99,110 
GHz (Q x f) as well as nearly zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency and so on. On 
the other hand, one of successful candidates to replace traditional SiO2 material is developed by 
Applied Materials, “Black diamond” which has been used in the IC industry. However, Cordierite 
has not only low-? but also strong mechanical strength, thermal and chemical resistance and 
stability. Therefore the potential of cordierite in IC industry is still a hot topic nowadays.     
 

The synthesis of cordierite has been a challenge due to high temperature required and 
porosity removal during heat treatment. However cordierite sinterability was also found not good 
due to narrow range of sintering temperature [24]. Tummala et al [25] reported that completed 
densification is achieved for cordierite glass powder by melting a mixture of the raw ingredients 
of given composition (13 wt.% MgO, 27 wt.% Al2O3 and 60 wt.% SiO2) in alumina crucibles at 
1500 oC for 2 h until it was completely homogenized. The molten glass was water quenched to 
form ‘‘cullets’’. The cullets have to be further ball milled with two steps to an average particle 
size around 2 mm. The sintering agent P2O5, B2O3 (B2O3 and P2O5&lt;5 wt.%) was employed to 
reduce sintering temperature between 900-950 oC. Similarly Nandi studied glass frit preparation 
[26]. Kumar et al [18] studied and claimed that improved sinterability can be obtained by two 
approaches either changing the glass compositions with excess MgO [27] and less Al2O3 or 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

adding sintering aids such as P2O5 and B2O3. Chen [21] studied the addition of ZnO wt.% on 
crystallization behaviour in cordierite sintering and properties. Chen found that with increasing 
ZnO the batch melting temperature, glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature 
all decreases. Meanwhile, another method recently appeared to lower the sintering temperature is 
to based on sol-gel derived cordierite glass and the results showed the sintering temperature 
decreased below 1000 oC [20]. The starting agent of synthesis of cordierite could be mixture of 
stoichiometric pure MAS oxides however most works were more interested in using non-standard 
mixture of natural clays such as kaolin, talc and corundum [28]. Although using mixture of 
natural materials poses a problem of composition control however the saving of production cost 
from pure oxides is significant appealing factor that drives the research in understanding of 
behaviour and sintering schedule. In summary, the cordierite could be synthesized by glass 
crystallization method [11, 26, 29], sol-gel method, or solid-state reaction. However, the first two 
methods are not suitable for industrial scale production due to involved high cost reagents or 
more complicated synthesis procedures. Although the pure oxides with stoichiometric mixture 
yield high efficiency of production but the cost effectiveness drives the work of studying 
compositional variation effect from natural materials [30]. 
 
1.3 Mullite  

 
In the MgO-SiO2-Al2O3 phase diagram (Fig. 1.1), pure oxides of MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 could 

crystallise into other MAS minerals with different stoichiometric compositions at different 
temperatures. This is more perplexing in our investigation since the original cordierite precursor 
powder is made of natural materials with non-stoichiometric compositions. The composition of 
other minerals in the sintered sample has a significant influence on the thermal-mechanical 
properties such as thermal expansion, electrical and shock resistance. One of the most dominant 
phases which co-exist with cordierite at high temperature is Mullite, Al6Si2O13 or 3Al2O3-2SiO2. 
The unit cell of mullite is shown in Fig. 1.5. 
 

 
Fig. 1.5: crystal structure of mullite’s unit cell 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

The most noticeable use of mullite is related to its refractory properties with melting point at 

1840 oC. Mullite is also known as Aluminium silicate which is rare mineral on earth naturally 
formed and mostly from post-clay genesis. Mullite becomes dominating phase at high 
temperature above 1500 oC in case of Mg deficiency since cordierite or other phase has melt. 
Therefore it is most seen in nature near to volcanic site where it was firstly discovered in 1924 in 
volcanic rock in Scotland. 
 

Mullite has two morphologies in platelet shape and needle shape. The needle shape mullite is 
desirable to be formed in cordierite ceramics matrix during heat treatment since it has beneficiary 
effect on increasing the fracture strength and thermal shock resistance over long cycle and large 
load [31]. The most important condition to form needle shape reinforced ceramics lying with the 
composition of silica and alumina and temperature as well as the environment being either 
reductive or oxygenated. When the composition and sintering gas environment are adjusted to 
desirable values needle mullite will form at 1200 oC [31] and the needles will interlock thus 
increasing the fracture strength. This potential increase of mechanical fracture strength has 
important implication in reinforcing the brittle porcelain. The formation of needle (tubular) shape 
mullite depends on the presence of crystallization centres which are often impurities. Pitak et al 
[31] studied the high temperature performance of materials consisting of needle shape mullite and 
showed it is an excellent structural material. The specimen consisting needle shape mullite from 
molten kaolin softens under load of 0.2 MPa at 1750 oC while the creep under the same load after 
10 h hold is zero. However the sintered kaolin with 12% porosity shows softening at 1520 oC and 
15% creep at 1200 oC with the same load. 
 
1.4 Composite ceramics  

 
Although there are many advantages (high modulus, hardness, chemical resistance, low 

thermal expansion and good refractoriness) of using ceramics as highly effectively structural 
materials, they also present some negative aspects. One of most noticeable disadvantages is the 
severely underestimated strength of ceramics, which is between 1/10 and 1/100 of the theoretical 
value predicted from interatomic bonding strength. This phenomenon has been explained in A. A. 
Griffith’s theoretical fracture strength equation considering the existence of flaws, and the 
brittleness was explained as consequence of increased stress concentration in vicinity of 
micro-cracks or pores [32] given by:

Where E is the elastic modulus of fully dense material; ?S is the specific surface energy; and 
a is half length of internal crack. From this equation one can see that bigger the internal crack is, 
easier the ceramics will break. Equation (1.1) also implies that the fracture strength for ceramics 
materials is not likely the same due to statistical distribution of the micro-crack length. Apart 
from this, ceramics also presents image of being weak in shear and tension, brittle with KIc in 
region 1-12 MPa m1/2 compared to Al alloys have KIc =25-50 MPa m1/2. The brittleness of 
ceramics is due to the ionic bond that has much less flexibility to deform plastically compared to 
non-brittle materials e.g. metals. When the bond is broken the structure will completely fail. It is 
unlikely to change the interatomic bond nature however it is possible to add second phase to 
modify the ceramics materials. Therefore the development was focused on combining the 
advantages while reducing the drawbacks by reinforcing the ceramics with less hard but more 
plastic materials in order to relieve the stress concentrated around crack to maintain the structure 
in avoiding catastrophic failure.  
 

Composite materials have attracted strong interests due to the nature that composite could 
combine two materials advantages and reduce or minimise the disadvantages from each phases. 
An example of composite is designed by using nanoparticles e.g., carbon nanotubes (~10-9 m) as 
reinforcing phase to modify and improve the physical or mechanical properties of matrices for 
instance polymer without sacrificing its lightweight property. The fact that addition of only small 
amount of CNTs induces an significant improvement on macro-scale properties has made 
nanocomposites highly attractive new classes of lightweight, high strength and multifunctional 
materials [33]. Polymer nanocomposites have achieved such success being reinforced with a wide 
variety of different nanoparticles and CNTs. 

 
However, the idea of dispersing high modulus/strength CNT in cordierite or other ceramics 

faces difficulties in processing due to the fact that the CNT will likely decompose and react with 
oxygen-containing ceramics above 600 oC. In addition to this, CNTs are hydrophobic without 
surface chemistry modification in polar liquid such as water and most polymer resins. These 
cause a poor dispersion of CNTs in aqueous ceramics slurry which results in much lower 
mechanical properties enhancement than expected. Therefore, the carbon oxidation during 
sintering and adverse effect of poor dispersion hinders the development to obtain high mechanical 
properties of CNT reinforced ceramics composites. Despite this, CNT has been found 
successfully applied in pure metal, Aluminium [34, 35] and [36]; more recently, in 
non-oxygenated ceramics system for fracture toughening such as ZrB2-SiC [37], Si3N4 [38]; Cho 
et al [39] reviewed the progress the CNT-loaded ceramic composite.; It is noteworthy that Estili 
et al [40, 41] claimed that reinforcement of oxygen containing ceramics ?-alumina with CNT has 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

been successful by Spark plasma sintering (SPS). The SPS method enabled to avoid the problem 
of CNT oxidation [42]: The sintering was carried out at 1350 oC and the heating rate is 100 
oC/min; The holding time at 1350 oC was 12 min; and the SPS was also in hot isostatic pressing 
condition with applied pressure of 75 MPa. The vacuum is 1.8 Pa or 1.8×10-5 bar. The sintering 
Die and punches are made of graphite resulting in a reductive atmosphere during sintering. The 
sample relative density was 100%. Very recently, an very interesting result has been reported by 
Wang et al [43] regarding the reinforcement of mullite ceramics matrix with CNT by hot pressing 
sintering. This is considered a breakthrough in terms of oxygen-containing ceramics 
reinforcement with CNT loading. The result in [43] showed the sample was sintered at 1600 oC 
with 5 vol.% of MWNT leading to 10% increase in bending strength and 78% increase in fracture 
toughness. The preparation was performed using hot pressing in Ar atmosphere at 30 MPa in 
graphite die at 1500, 1550, 1600 and 1650 oC for 1 h and the aim was to compare the mechanical 
properties of pure mullite prepared under the same conditions. Despite, the result in term of 
mechanical properties improvement is sceptical due to large error. However SEM images shows 
that CNT is not degraded in mullite matrix under Ar gas protection above 1500 oC. Despite the 
success claimed by the author, the mechanical properties were seen decreased at 1650 oC with the 
same CNT loading, which was not be able to explain well. Anyhow provided a hint to continue 
CNT-loaded cordierite composite research via conventional heat treatment route instead of SPS 
route in Estili et al work [40, 42].  
 

To the best knowledge of the author, there is no report related to CNT-loaded composite 
ceramics with cordierite as primary phase. A wide-ranging ceramics-ceramics composites for 
cordierite were developed with modifying phases such as AlN [44, 45] (show optimum content of 
AlN for best mechanical performance with low-k and thermal stability). Studies on mechanical, 
electrical and thermal properties of cordierite composite have also appeared with other ceramics 
reinforcing or modifying phases such as Mullite [46-53], Zirconia [54-56], alumina [57] or 
alumina fibre [58], Mica [59], glass [60, 61], glass-fibre [62], forsterite (spinel) [63] as well as 
silicon carbide [64, 65] and SiC whisker [66] or SiC platelets, particles [67]. SiC was found very 
effective to reinforce the cordierite’s fracture toughness from less than 2 MPa1/2 to 3.5 MPa1/2 
with 30 vol% SiC whisker while the fracture strength was found the most effectively reinforced 
by adding SiC particles instead of whiskers from 170 MPa to 270 MPa while the SiC whisker 
addition at 30 vol% reinforced the fracture strength only up to 230 MPa [67]. Meanwhile SiC is 
also studied by Liu and Zhu et al [65, 68] to produce porous foam however the SiC foam requires 
high sintering temperature above 2100 oC which limits its application. Various ceramics are 
considered as bonding agents to fabricate the SiC foam among which Cordierite is considered one 
of the best candidates to sinter SiC foam at lower temperature.

Cordierite-mullite composite is often found in the literature used for refractory application. 

The mullite has different morphology and the shape of mullite grain appeared to be very 
influential to the cordierite-mullite composite [53]. Ibrahim showed [69] that excessive corundum 
is added in order to produce the required mechanical properties. The thermal shock resistance of 
cordierite composite according to ASTM standard by water quench test to ceramics body heated 
at 950 oC for 15 min and repeat this until the ceramics body fails. The sample showed excellent 
thermal shock resistance until 36 cycles [70]. Ozel et al [51] studied the processing of 
cordierite-mullite composite by tape casting or mixed with pre-produced mullite powder into 
cordierite starting powders. Their results showed that the mixing of mullite powder produced 
stronger strength of composite in the cordierite slip casting process due to better densification. 
The cordierite-mullite has also presented interesting electrical properties. The electrical properties 
as function of volume fraction of mullite in cordierite matrix has also been studied and of being 
subject to research [49]. The cordierite and mullite vol.% dependent electrical properties as well 
as dielectric properties versus porosity were examined systematically [49]. The author claimed 
that the composite with 70 wt.% cordierite fine powder and 30 wt.% medium particles exhibit the 
best electrical properties (dielectric constant ~7, dielectric loss=0.01-0.125). In the meantime, this 
composition shows excellent match TEC that of silicon as substrate material. Although addition 
of mullite does increase the dielectric constant from around 6 to 7 but the dielectric loss is 
decreased by 100%. The overall properties of cordierite-mullite composite are more favourable 
than that of neat cordierite.   

 
As previously discussed, cordierite has been widely used in refractory materials such as kiln 

furniture, furnace support and some high temperature gas burner for instance, as well as advanced 
ceramics components for aerospace and so on. The most important properties of cordierite or 
cordierite-based ceramics composite lie with its excellent linear thermal expansion and thermal 
shock resistance. Thermal shock resistance (TSR) is widely studied among MAS ceramics such 
as Bauxite and Dolomite [71], cordierite/SiC composite [70, 72], mullite-cordierite composite, 
alumina–mullite–zirconia and alumina–mullite by slip casting [73] using water quench method. 
Yamuna et al [74] also tried IR heating to study thermal shock resistance in cordierite porous 
ceramics which showed advantages over water quench method. Recently, Tomba et al [75] 
employed the thermal shock induced stress in the cordierite ceramics disk and studied the effect 
of TSR by Finite element Analysis (FEM). In addition to this, the cordierite has been made to 
functional component such as honeycomb used as catalyst converter and the thermal shock 
resistance is studied and modeled based on the bulk materials by FEM, in which he found that the 
maximum thermal stress is less than the flexural strength of the material. The experiment supports 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

the FEM results that the honeycomb structure does not fail after flame heating up to the melting 
point [76].  
 

In one word, cordierite-based ceramics is a very hot topic due to its unique properties. The 
most critical issue of cordierite-mullite-alumina composite research as mentioned in most 
literatures is the controlled formation of mineral phase with parameters such as sintering 
temperature, time, and starting materials. Banjuraizah et al [11] and Wu et al [77] showed that 
MgO excess distribution highly affects the cordierite formation efficiency and has effect on 
microstructural, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the ceramics sintered from 
non-stoichiometric/non-Standard precursor materials. However, the complete picture of roles of 
additives and binders in synthesis versus physical, thermal and mechanical properties is still an 
unaccomplished task. Thus, a good understanding, high efficiency sintering schedule from natural 
materials in terms of various properties is needed. In the following investigation, 
cordierite-mullite composite with other phases is synthesized and studied based on original 
powder of non-stoichiometric composition from commercial supplier. A more comprehensive 
work is beyond the scope of the present. However, the above-mentioned issues are expected to be 
addressed in near future. 
 
1.5 Cordierite foam 

 
Ceramics foams are cellular structure with struts made of bulk or bulk ceramics. It is found to 

be applied for instance in construction industry for thermal isolation, or as porous scaffolds for 
bone replacement made of bioactive ceramics. Ceramics foam is an important class of materials 
providing modest mechanical strength, shaping ability, hardness, durability, chemical inactivity, 
bio-compatibility. Apart from these, ceramics foam inherits the excellent thermal properties and 
are thought to be the most likely choice for filter and catalyst support with research interests [78]. 
One of the principal applications of ceramic foams in thermal engineering is lying with filter for 
high temperature fluid media due to its thermal stability (bulk TEC as low as 10-6/K, Table 1.1), 
low thermal conductivity, low density and excellent thermal shock resistance. One of the 
noteworthy example is Zirconia foam has achieved thermal insulation properties equivalent to 
that of NASA space shuttle thermal protective tile but with much lower specific weight at 550 oC 
[79].  

 
The foundry industry also has special interest in using ceramic foam in order to improve 

quality and productivity of metal casting which suffered from non-metallic impurity. The molten 
metal has typical temperature of 1000 oC and therefore the ceramic foam is required with 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   

 14

excellent mechanical-thermal properties [80]. The chemical stability is foreseen because molten 
metal contains very reactive species such as aluminium, titanium, hafnium and carbon. The 
thermal shock resistance is parameter to the component not to crack due to thermal expansion 
induced stress. Montanaro et al [79] has claimed that the thermal shock resistance is largely 
dependent on the foam cell size (increasing with increase of cell size) but weakly dependent on 
the density (also increasing with increase of density). However, the last but not the least t 
requirement to ensure good functional property is permittivity of the foam in terms of the cavity 
fraction and homogeneity of the foam which control the flow rate of the molten metal.  

 
The structures of ceramics foam can be summarized in two types: 1) closed cell ceramics and 

2) open-cell ceramics. The closed cell can be normally achieved by blowing air into molten 
materials or introducing foaming agent in the ceramics slurry. The closed cellular structure is 
formed and followed by calcinations at suitable temperature [2]. However closed cell ceramics 
foam can be used as thermal insulating or acoustic damping applications but hardly used as 
material for filtering or catalyst support which requires permittivity through the foam.  

 
The ceramics fabrication is a difficult task due to the high temperatures required to sinter the 

green body into densified product. This is particularly troubling in case of ceramic foams since 
normal chemically induced foaming procedure will be burn out before the ceramics green body is 
sintered. Mutanaro et al [79] summarised the most conventional ceramics foam production 
approach in which two primary processing routes are applied. There are routes to fabricate 
Ceramics foams such as bubbles generation into a slurry or at green state with special thermal 
treatment, reaction sintering, control of sintering conditions in order to only achieve a partial 
densification, stacking of presintered granules or fibres, aerogel and sol-gel methods, pyrolysis of 
various organic additives and the method used in most studies also in this investigation, 
polymeric sponge/replicating method due to its simplification and low cost of chemical agents use 
[79, 81].  

 
Open cell ceramic foams can made either by polymerizing (foaming) organic monomer in a 

ceramic slurry then dried and calcined [2]. However, the most used methods in producing ceramic 
foams is to coat the struts of a polymer preform with a ceramic slurry followed by drying and 
slowly (1 oC/min) burning out the polymer struts at intermediate temperature. Neto et al [81] 
studied the impregnation of cordierite foam using Polyurethane foam as replica and burned out 
polyurethane at 550 oC for 30 min followed by sintering at 1350 oC for 1 h. In this regard, 
polyurethane foam is most popular due to its non-toxic nature and versatility of microstructure 
control versus water content as foaming agent. The ceramics slurry usually contains particles 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

from 0.1~10 um with a suitable dispersant, and a binder/thickening agent to increase the bonding 
of the slurry on the surface of polymer strut [2]. The polymeric replica method has two variations, 
without, and with a thickening agent added to the slurry, the excess of which is then removed by 
blowing air or by squeezing after impregnation, thus obtaining a ceramic replica of the polymeric 
foam. The foams prepared former variation exhibit good air or fluid permittivity but lower 
mechanical strength, whilst the latter variation enables higher strength to be obtained due to high 
fraction of solid but decreases fluid permittivity.  
 

An example of open cell with high porosity is shown in Fig. 1.6 illustrating the struts, cell 
and windows in a positive image of original polymer struts. The ceramic foams can be made with 
a wide range of properties and processing conditions via controlling the impregnation behaviour 
and rheological properties of the slurry. One of the most effective ways to control the 
microstructure and porosity is by squeezing the excessive slurries in different ratio to the original 
polymer struts. 

 
However, the application of Ceramics foam is still limited because of their much lower 

mechanical strength in terms of Young’s modulus and compression strength, thermal and 
dimensional stability compared to theoretical predictions with analytical model due to defect and 
porosity within the struts as demonstrated in Fig.1.6. The influence of experimental parameters on 
the mechanical properties will be revisited later in this thesis. 

 
Fig. 1.6: typical open cell structure of Al2O3 with windows, strut and cell [2] 

 
The structure illustrated in Fig. 1.6. shows many small pores distributed on the surface of the 

struts due to burning-out of polymer and shrinkage during sintering. Some researchers aimed at 
studying the preparation of ceramic suspensions with suitable rheological properties in order to 
improve the processing conditions of cordierite foams by the polymeric sponge method, avoid 
defects in the struts after sintering and enhance the mechanical properties with second 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

impregnation of slurry to fill the pores or defects [82]. 
 

The goal of the present work is to optimize the processing steps routes in order to obtain high 
specific modulus, high specific strength of cordierite foams for thermo-mechanical applications. 
The primary interest is to observe how the amount (wt.%) of dispersant and solid loading (vol.%) 
affect the rheological properties of the suspensions and the ability of polymeric foams. Susana et 
al [83] showed that precursor cordierite suspensions containing 45 vol.% solids dispersed with 0.8 
wt.% Targon 1128 enabled good impregnating conditions. However this work did not considered 
the effects of either adding a thickening agent or of the slurry to struts weight ratio to control the 
microstructure homogeneity. A comprehensive study of rheological properties dependent effect 
on impregnation is beyond the timescale of this project at current stage, and the optimized 
parameters were selected from [83]. In this investigation, under the optimized rheological 
properties conditions of the slurry, the weight ratio of impregnating slurry to neat polymer struts 
is considered a critical parameter to control the structure of the foams obtained. The effects of 
drying conditions on the microstructure homogeneity of the foams were also studied using optical 
inspection. Microstructural characterization of as-produced ceramics foams was also performed 
by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and X-ray micro-tomography. Mechanical 
characterization tests included measurement of foam’s apparent Young’s modulus, Compression 
strength and Poisson ratio. Finally, modelling of mechanical properties is performed for cellular 
materials to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the experiment.

Chapter 2: Experimental techniques 
 
2.1 Particle Size Analyzer 

 
Coulter LS230 Laser spectrometer was used to determine the particle size distribution of the 

precursor powder dispersed in dilute aqueous suspension using the Fraunhofer optical model. The 
principle employed Coulter LS laser 230 lying with forward light scattering and Polarization 
intensity differential scattering (PIDS). This is discussed and compared to other particle size 
measurement principles by Taib et al [84]. The forward light scattering instrument consists of 
three main components: sensor, sample cell and particle counter. The particle is detected by 
scattered laser light whenever the particle is in the sample cell. The intensity alterations of laser 
light are collected by the detector. The particle size is proportional to the amplitude of the light 
intensity while the number of light pulses is used to determine the number fraction of the particles. 
The suspension is used with filtered tap water. The use of tap water is limited unless filtered due 
to bubble generation from degassing when the water temperature increases. According to [84] the 
bubble size could range between 100 to 500 µm and elimination by background measurement is 
not possible [85]. 
 
2.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy 

 
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscopy technique that images 

the sample surface by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons. The electrons interact 
with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the 
sample's surface topography, composition and other properties such as electrical conductivity. 
The SEM is carried out on Hitachi SU-70 microscope installed at University of Aveiro. 

The microscope is equipped with EDX (Energy Dispersion X-ray) module and PC terminal in 
order to analyse the elemental compositions and digitalise the image in real time. The types of 
signals produced by SEM including secondary electrons (SEs); back scattered electrons (BSEs), 
characteristic X-rays, light (cathodoluminescence), specimen current and transmitted electrons. 
These signals require specialized detectors that are not usually all present on a single machine. 
The signals result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at or near the surface of the 
sample. In standard detection mode, secondary electron imaging or SEI is commonly used. The 
SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details about 1 to 5 
nm in dimension. Due to the way these images are created, SEM micrographs have a very large 
depth of field yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

surface structure of a sample. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 25 x (about 
equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to about 250000x, about 250 times the magnification 
limit of the best light microscopes.  

2.3 X-ray Powder diffraction 
 
X-ray powder diffraction is used in this work as most important characterization to 

determined not only the phase identification during heat treatment but also quantitative phase 
fraction evaluation by whole pattern refinement analysis, also known as Rietveld refinement. 
X-way has been used in materials science with long history. It was discovered by physicist 
Wolfgang C. Roentgen in early twenties centruies, when Roentgen was working with a cathode 
ray tube similar to a fluorescent light bulb nowadays. He realized that he had discovered a 
previously unknown "invisible light," or radiation in a better sense, which was being emitted from 
the tube. He named the new ray X-ray, because in mathematics "X" is used to indicated the 
unknown property. 

   
X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic wave and its wavelength could range from very hard 

region of 0.1 Å up to very soft 100 Å and this corresponds in terms of energy to the range of 
100-0.1 keV. The energy of X-ray is described by its wavelength: 

       
12.4

E
?

=  (keV)           (? in Å)    (2.1) 

The X-ray diffraction occurs based on the fact that X-ray will scatter at the periodical regular 
atomic lattice spacing. A real three-dimensional crystal is extremely large compared to the 
wavelength of incident X-ray and contains many sets of atomic planes. For diffraction, crystal 
must have the correct orientation with respect to the incoming beam, i.e. Bragg diffraction 
condition 2dsin?=?, d is interplanar spacing, is the wavelength and ? determine the respective 
orientation between the crystal and incoming beam. Perfectly, infinite large crystal and perfectly 
collimated beam will allow the diffraction condition to be “exactly” satisfied. However, in reality, 
Strains, defects, and finite crystal size effects, as well as instrumental resolution due to 
collimation cause diffraction peaks to be broadened. In case of losing periodic arrangement of 
atoms in materials the diffraction pattern will show much more broadened feature which is 
characteristics to glass or liquid material. The diffraction patterns for perfect, imperfect and 
liquid/glass sample are seen in Fig. 2.1. For perfect crystals, I(q), (I is the diffracted intensity and 
q is scattering vector) consist of ? functions (perfectly sharp scattering). For imperfect crystals, 
the peaks are broadened due to the factors of strains, crystallite size and instrument resolutions. 
For liquids and glasses, the diffraction intensity is a continuous, slowly varying function. 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Fig. 2.1 diffraction pattern between perfect, real crystal and amorphous material (liquid or glass) 
 

In actual study of ceramics material, one often find that the XRD patterns show 
superimposed feature of imperfect crystal pattern on the top of the amorphous pattern. This 
implies that the glass/liquid phase is formed and most of time unavoidable after sintering. This is 
due to the non-stoichiometric conditions that precursor oxides cannot fully react to form 
crystalline phase but transform into glassy phase. However quantification of the liquid/glass 
phase requires special sample preparation and data analysis skills which are not covered in this 
work. 
  

X-ray diffraction has been also used for quantitative crystal structure study since introduction 
of Rietveld refinement in 1960’s by H.M. Rietveld [86, 87]. Rietveld [87] showed that the profile 
refinement procedures by comparing to experiment was superior to any other methods involving 
either peak separation or use of total integrated intensity of groups of overlapping peaks. With 
Rietveld method, one of most preeminent drawback of powder diffraction method, i.e. loss of 
information as result of overlapped peaks has been tackled effectively. The original Rietveld 
method was designed to analyze the pattern from low resolution neutron powder diffraction. 
However the method has been extended to high resolution X-ray diffractometer with proper 
profile functions developed. The most important aspects of Rietveld method is the fitting could 
take into account parameters relating to the instrument or structure such as half width broadening 
without any sample's effect, 2? zero offset, cell lattice parameters, temperature factors, atomic 
fractional coordinates, occupation numbers and so on in one analysis which speed up the 
efficiency of material analysis in a revolutionary way.  
 
 The Rietveld found its application particularly in quantitative phase (fraction) analysis (QPA) 
of mixed materials. There are primary two approaches in QPA called “traditional method” and 
“Rietveld method”. Both methods are based on calculation of the peak reflection intensity. The 
reflection intensity from (hkl) of phase j is written as below:

Where, I: incident beam intensity, fj: phase volume fraction, Vj: cell volume, Lhkl,j: Lorentzian 
polarization, Fhkl,j: structure factor, Phkl,j: Texture factor, Aj: absorption factor. From (2.2) we see 
that the intensity of diffraction peak is directly proportional to the phase volume fraction, hence 
the weight fraction can be calculated provided each phase is known with its theoretical density 
can be calculated by X-ray diffraction analysis. The parameters in (2.2) are not necessarily known 
before QPA.  
 

The traditional method to do quantitative phase analysis is based on internal reference by 
adding a known amount of additional phase to mixture and measure the peak intensity ratio. 
Therefore the amount of other phase can be calculated based on the ratio between their respective 
peak intensity to that of the known amount of internal reference as shown in (2.3).

However traditional method presents several unavoidable limits [88] such as the 
methodology to determine the peak intensity is often done to the height instead of peak integral; 
Only one or few peaks are used and this will produce error when preferred orientation is present; 
In case of peak overlapping the peak integral is difficult to be extracted as intensity. This 
principal error source urges the scientist to adopt alternative approach of QPA, namely Rietveld 
refinement. 
 

In the Rietveld method, the peak is fitted with mathematical profile functions, thus differing 
from the internal reference method. Rietveld method uses a structure dependent approach 
including all crystal structure and sample microstructure information. However, Rietveld method 
also has limitations. When the structural information is not complete even for just one phase, the 
refinement work cannot proceed. The incorrect structural information will also affect the 
quantitative phase analysis in a significant way since the profile intensity is solely determined the 
crystal structural information. Recalling the usual intensity of Rietveld formula [88]:

S(2?i-2?k,n) is peak broadening function which determines the shape of the peak, normally 4 
types of shape functions are available in Bragg-Brentano geometry of diffractometer with 
?-2? coupled X-ray tube and detector, namely Gaussian, Cauchy, Voigt and Pseudo-Voigt as well 
as Pearson VII; Pk,n is texture factor, A is absorption factor; which affects the height of the peaks;

monochromator, detector, beam size/sample volume and sample positioning (angular); ¦Fk,n¦2 is

structure factor incorporated with temperature factor; bkgi is the background function; Vn is the 
volume of unit cell [89]. Where Sn are now the scale factor for the phase j and comparing this to

can be written as:

N is the total number of phases in mixture, Sj is scale factor, ?i is density of phase, Si?i is 
phase density of the phase. In (2.4) t the intensity of profile is calculated from the crystal structure 
and compared to the experimental data. The difference between them are minimized by adjusting 
the parameters such as crystal structure, sample size and instrument broadening as well as 
background and phase fraction. Therefore a quality of fit must be evaluated to the difference 
between the calculated and experiment, called “residual factor”. The typical residual factor of 
Rietveld refinements are profile residual factor Rp, weighted residual factor “Rwp” and expected 
residual factor “Rexp” given by:

Where Yi(obs) is observed data point, Yi(calc) is calculated data point from (2.4); The profile 

residual factor or weighted residual factor are used separately or simultaneously depending on 
software for instance GSAS uses Rwp and Rp while MAUD uses Rexp and Rp. N in (2.8) is total 
number of data points and P is total number of parameters taken into account in the refinement. 
And the ratio between Rwp and Rexp is called ?2

expwpR R? =  (2.9) 

?2 is the goodness of the fit. Ideally it should be 1 however a practical guide is ?2 usually 
required be less than 2 for simple and well crystalline phase. The ?2 is often larger than 2 due to 
insufficient information of the model or poor quality of the data due to limited X-ray 
measurement time. Nevertheless, these days the Rietveld refinement is more and more popular 
used in challenging field such as dealing with complex mixture of phases (8-10) or 
semi-crystalline and amorphous phase. Therefore it is very often to see that Rp larger than 15 and 
?2 is larger than 2 which we still accept as a good refinement. The last but not the least is that the 
Rietveld refinement is also an extremely user experience related approach and the result could be 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

different or very different from one to another user for the same dataset. Someone even argued 
[89] that one or two years experience is needed in order to be able successfully use the Rietveld 
method independently. 

 
The success to carry out a good QPA appears to be also dependent on choice of refinement 

strategy and software claimed by Connor et al [90]. Therefore we conducted a software 
benchmark to determine the most successful QPA strategy in our case. Currently several software 
are available either from commercial or free-of-charge sources. TOPAS is developed by Alan 
Coelho and commercialized by Bruker AXS. The other commercial one is used for trial in this 
investigation is “Siroquant” developed by Sietronics Australia. The advantage of using Siroquant 
is that the refinement benefit from using built-in mineral database containing structure of around 
1800 most common minerals and compounds. However commercialization limits the usefulness 
of the software to us. In addition to this, free software such GSAS [91] developed by Los Alamos 
National Laboratory (USA), and MAUD [92] by University of Trento (Italy) are compared. The 
benchmark study is conducted for mixture of 3 oxides (V2O5, SnO2 and ZnO) of good 
crystallinity with well-known structure. The weight fraction was pre-determined for comparison 
to those obtained from Rietveld method. In order to remove any ambiguities in choosing Rietveld 
Program due to data quality, the collection of data is perform over long time for very good 
intensity statistics. The typical recommended time Rietveld refinement is 2-5 h depending on the 
sample’s phase complexity. Nevertheless we run the sample for 12 h. The result of QPA using 
GSAS and MAUD was shown in Table 2.1.   

 
Table 2.1: QPA results from Rietveld Refinement

SnO2 8.1958 63.556 48 61.29 
V2O5 1.4076 10.915 22 8.96 

 
The result in Table 2.1 suggested MAUD gives a significant better agreement to experiment 

while GSAS showed the unsatisfactory agreement for SnO2 and V2O5. Despite that both programs 
use the same algorithm shown in equation (2.5), the programs give different report on QPA is 
rather surprising.  

 
The Rietveld refinement by GSAS is shown in Fig. 2.2 and by MAUD in Fig. 2.3 

respectively. It was somehow surprising that the refinement by GSAS showed excellent quality of 
fitting in terms of difference curve and residual factor (see Fig. 2.2). However the QPA result in 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Table 2.1 does not reflect a good agreement to experiment. This alerts us that a choice of program 
and strategy should be considered unless the cause of disagreement could be identified and 
tackled.

Fig. 2.3: QPA result of 12 h scan by Rietveld method (MAUD), Rwp ~17% 

 
On the other hand, MAUD showed relatively worse quality of Rietveld fit, Rw~17% in Fig. 

2.3. However, the QPA result is very close to experimental result. The deterioration of quality is 
supposed to relate to the incorrect model of background subtraction. However, a comparative 
study between GSAS, MAUD for mixture of ZnO, SnO2 and V2O5 suggested that the MAUD 
should be used in QPA practice.  
 

Finally, being a powerful investigation tool, X-ray diffraction also has disadvantage due to 
decreasing scattering power as function of diffraction 2?. This gives problem in determination of 
small structural details within the higher angle (small d-spacing) peak region.

2.4 Mechanical properties Characterization 

 
Mechanical properties are the most important to ceramics materials at ambient or 

non-ambient environment. The typical measurements include characterization of compressive and 
flexural properties. However, for ceramics samples, another measurement technique based on 
sonic vibration is also introduced due to difficulty in performing compression test to obtain 
Young’s modulus. All measurements were conduced at room temperature in the study. However, 
the high temperature behaviour of ceramics modulus is an interesting subject to be determined 
with special setup in sonic vibration technique for advanced refractory application such as 
aerospace and rocket industry. 

 
2.4.1 Compression  

Young’s modulus and Compression strength study were carried out for the cellular structure 
of ceramics by compression test. The specimen preparation does not follow dimension 
requirement of ASTM standard due to sample machinability hardship caused by ceramics 
brittleness. However, the equation (2.10) was used to calculate the modulus from ASTM 
standard.

Where W is the load (N), and H is the initial height in m of the sample, A is the initial area 
(in m2) of the sample and D is the intercept distance (in m) between point T and O on deformation 
axis as shown in Fig. 2.4. The point S is chosen arbitrarily [93]. The stress-deformation curves 
usually required to be measured 6 times prepared from the same batch [93]. However, this could 
not be easily achieved since the production ceramic foams with homogeneous microstructure are 
a difficult and time-consuming (2 weeks) process. Alternative strategy must be adopted such as 
one or two samples from the same batch are used to measure the Compression strength. The 
Compression strength is determined by finding the first maximum load divided by the cross 
sectional area of the cube in each measurement and mean value and standard deviation are 
calculated.

Fig. 2.4: Schematic illustration of calculating elastic modulus [93] 

 
In general, a typical compressive behaviour of stress-strain curve of polymer foam with 

non-brittle struts material (unlike ceramics) is presented in Fig. 2.5; it shows that there are three 
stages in compression mode mechanical behaviour. 

i. Linear elastic region, where stress is linearly proportional to strain; 
ii. Plateau region, characterized by a maximum compressive stress at start and 

stress-independent deformation with increasing strain; this corresponds to a hardening effect;  
iii. Densification region, final stage where the material is pressed and densified, hence 

exhibiting bulk behaviour.

polymer foam [94]

ceramics foam [95] 
 

From the slope of linear elastic region, the Young’s modulus can be calculated and the 
intersection point between elastic region and plateau region gives the maximum compressive 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

strength. Polymer Foams have a high energy absorption capacity represented by the area below 
the curve in Fig. 2.5. This type of behaviour is complicated in case of ceramic foams as seen in 
Fig. 2.6; samples are numbered from 3-7 with different microstructures. Since the strut is made of 
materials with brittle nature and they cannot undergo large deformation. For instance, the high 
level of brittleness of ceramics struts of ceramic foam causes ceramics struts failure and breaks. 
Therefore, the stress-strain curve shows a zigzag behaviour until the cellular structure breaks 
down completely due to major event of crack propagation and hence stress drop to minimal as 
seen in Fig. 2.6. The Compression strength is defined at start of plateau of stress. However, the 
Young’s modulus from compression test is dubious and often found to be significantly lower (by 
2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than values given by sonic vibration measurements.  
 
2.4.2 Flexural strength 
  

Flexural strength is also known as bending strength or fracture strength which measures the 
trend or capability how much strength materials can resist on bending until fracture. It is a very 
important engineering property in structural and component design. The unit used for flexural 
strength is MPa in case of the force is in N and the area is in mm2. The most typical measurement 
method for flexural strength is based on “three points” bending which is illustrated in Fig. 2.7. 
 

 
Fig. 2.7: illustration of three-point bending test of flexural strength [96] 

The determination of flexural strength is carried out in two cases for sample with rectangular or 
circular cross section. For a rectangular bar, the calculation of the flexural strength is given by:

Where, F is the load (N) at the mid-point of the sample, and L=Lss as seen in Fig. 2.7 is the length 
of the lower support span, b is width and d is thickness of the sample in mm; in case of circular 
cross section, R is the radius. The measurement method could also refer to procedures given by 
ATSM standard [97]. R1, R2 in Fig. 2.7 is not relevant in our investigation since the contact 
region between the sample and stressed point is not spherical but parallel surface. 

The flexural strength represents the maximum stress experienced in the material at its 
moment of rupture. In practical application, the flexural strength is often equivalized to the Von 
Mises stress [98] in modeling. This is especially useful in cellular structure since the structure of 
cellular framework is random and the stress generated due to strain is not uniform. Somewhere in 
the cellular structure the stress exceeds the flexural strength earlier than other part. This implies 
that part will fracture earlier and the crack generated is likely to propagate to cause global 
mechanical failure. We will see the comparison between the experiment and modeling of the 
fracture of ceramics cellular structure in this work later on. 

2.4.3 Impulse Excitation Measurement 
 The impulse excitation technique is based on the principle that solid will vibrate under 
external stimuli at its intrinsic frequency and the air around the solid will be excited at the same 
frequency and hence the sound wave is generated. The generated sound signal will be measured 
by the acoustic transducer and converted into electrical signal of waveform. The waveform is then 
analyzed by Fourier transform (FT) to obtain the frequency components of the waveform. The 
fundamental frequency of the waveform corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the solid 
harmonic mode.  
 
 The fundamental frequency of impulse excitation is connected to the solid materials 
properties such as Young’s modulus (E) and shear modulus (G). This technique is often used in 
field of non-destructive test or non-ambient environment where conventional compression test is 
not possible. In case of ceramics or porous materials, this technique is advantageous since the 
ceramics often exhibit a very high modulus and the required force to compress the sample is huge 
and exceeds the machine’s maximum force capability. In addition to this, the compression test 
requires the sample has a high level of flat surface in order to carry the load uniformly otherwise 
the non-uniformity of ceramics sample will produce cracks and propagate rapidly. Ceramics 
materials have very brittle nature and extremely small elastic deformation region; therefore, the 
specimen without perfect flat surface could collapse completely before starting elastic 
compression. On the other hand, ceramics are very difficult to machine in terms of dimension due 
to its brittleness and hardness.  



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

 The typical setup for impulse excitation measurement of Young’s modulus and shear 
modulus is shown in Fig. 2.8. Note that the location of microphone and place of tapping with 
impulse is different in each case. The specimen must be placed on two nodes with distance of 
0.224 L (L= specimen length) to each end in Fig. 2.8(a) [99]. The specimen is required to be long 
and thin in order to give the best result of measurement as large aspect ratio will simplify the 
calculation of geometry correction factor.

Fig. 2.8: (a) setup for Young’s modulus; (b) setup for shear modulus [99]. 
  

The measured waveform signal of damping sine wave is shown as in Fig. 2.9 used to 
calculate the frequency of flexural/torsion mode with Fourier Transform (FT) and the frequency 
is then used to calculate the Young’s and shear modulus according to ASTM standard [99]. 
Usually the damping sine waveform signal is a composition of several single frequencies 
damping sine wave. The mathematical expression to the waveform from IE measurement 
x(t)=Aexp(-?t)sin(?t+?): Where, A is pre-component, ? describes the damping decrease of the 
sound in the solid and f in terms of ? is the natural frequency. Ideally only single frequency after 
FT shows up but it is rarely seen. Other vibrations from higher harmonic mode or ambient 
support or experiment environment are also possible to be recorded and show up in the frequency 
domain after FT. One should use the most appropriate frequency for modulus calculation while 
others give rise to either too high or too low modulus results.

standard [99]. The IE technique is also applied to measure the shear modulus as shown in Fig. 2.8 
(b). The shear modulus is determined by the specimen’s dimension and weight as specified in 
ASTM standard [99] in equation:

The Poisson ratio of ceramic foam is a reflection of the isotropy of cellular structure. The 
theoretical evaluation of isotropic material gives rise to v=0.3. Poisson ratio can be calculated 
from measuring Young’s modulus and shear modulus. However the Poisson ratio calculation is 
limited to isotropic materials and the Poisson ratio of anisotropic materials can not be determined 
using the impulse excitation technique. The relationship between E and G to calculate Poisson 
ratio is given:

The Poisson ratio for ceramics material can also be calculated if this is not known prior to the 
experiment of shear modulus. Phani et al [100] gives an estimate for isotropic ceramics porous 
structure that the ratio E/G=0.391. Therefore, Poisson ratio can be calculated just by knowing E 
while shear modulus is difficult to be measured. In one word, the IE technique is particularly 
useful to mechanically characterize brittle ceramic foams or porous structure. The damping factor 
measured in the IE experiment is a reflection of defects existing in the dense material which 
cannot be seen. Therefore IE technique is also a qualitative mean to evaluate of the specimen 
porosity as defect when sound is propagated and damped in the materials.  
 
2.5 Thermal properties measurement  
  

DTA/TGA equipment was also used to characterise the phase transition/or chemical reaction 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

by locating the exothermic or endothermic peak while TGA is used to characterise the weight loss 
during temperature rising. The DTA is used to study the heat flow Changes in the sample, either 
exothermic or endothermic. The heat input into the sample can be detected relative to the inert 
reference. Therefore, a DTA curve is used to study materials transition that have occurred during 
heating/cooling, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under 
a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample. The 
DTA use Al2O3 as inert sample on one side of the system on the other hand, the materials was 
placed with a voltmeter to record the power supplied. As temperature rises, the heat input into the 
inert sample will be equalized to that into the materials however when phase transition takes place 
the heat into the sample will be deflected in the voltmeter as the power is used as latent heat while 
the same amount of power is recorded for inert sample Al2O3. Therefore, the power under the 
peak area is considered to be enthalpy of the transition and the location of the exothermic or 
endothermic peak are considered to be the phase transition with maximum rate. 

 
The thermal shock resistance was also carried out according to ASTM standard C1525-04 

[101]. The retained flexural strength of ceramics after water quenching the specimens from 
elevated temperature was measured. This standard gives critical temperature at which the flexural 
strength is decreased by at least 30%. Although the standard does not determine the thermal stress 
generated as consequence of temperature rising, it can be calculated as proposed in [102]:

?T is the temperature difference between the sample and quenching medium prior to the 
quenching, ? is linear thermal expansion coefficient while v is Poisson ratio and ? is the stress 
reduction factor. For very rapid heat transfer ? is defined as 1 [15]. Therefore re-arranging (2.15) 
by replacing thermal stress with flexural strength of ceramics body ?f, one could derive the 
analytical expression of thermal shock resistance as below: 

(1 )f

? ?

(2.16) is an useful equation by which one can estimate the thermal shock resistance via 
measure of linear thermal expansion coefficient, Young’s modulus, and flexural strength as well 
as Poisson ratio which are easily done. However, one should be also aware of that (2.16) does not 
take into account of thermal conductivity which has effect on ? in (2.15), hence the (2.16) is 
normally regarded as estimate of performance and used for comparison purposes [15]. The (2.16) 
corresponds to the minimum temperature difference required to generate thermal stress that is 
enough to nucleate macro flaws within the ceramics body that cause significant mechanical 
strength degradation. However in practical, the thermal shock resistance is often much higher 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

than the calculated due to the porosity could dissipate the crack energy and hence stop the crack 
propagation. 
 
2.6 Computed X-ray Tomography  

 
X-ray tomography is an imaging technique used to study the internal microstructure of a 

material. It provides non-destructive test that reveals the actual 3D structure of the sample. In 
SEM experiment one could only obtain 2D information or surface after material fracture. In 
contrast to this, X-ray tomography allows one to study the actual 3D shape of the microstructural 
objects without any compromising to integrity. This provides an overwhelming advantage to 
materials scientist to investigate the composite material in which the embedded objects cannot be 
readily examined [103]. The theory behind this technique is based on X-ray radiography when an 
X-ray radiation is illuminated on a sample the transmitted beam is recorded which is dependent 
on its material absorption coefficient, such as density, the atomic number and the energy (when 
the beam is monochromatic) [104]. A large number of radiographs shown in Fig. 2.10(a) by 
rotating the sample in the X-ray beam between 0o and 180o [103, 104] are obtained. Instrument 
software is applied to the resulting radiograph images to produce 2D slice image in Fig. 2.10(b) 
and 3D volumetric structural information is accessible by adding up the 2D slice image as shown 
in Fig. 2.10(c) [103]. Provided the thickness of slice is small enough to ensure continuity of the 
structure, for instance, an example of 3D structure of cellular materials after 3D reconstruction as 
shown in Fig. 2.11.

Fig. 2.11: 3D Tomography image of polymer foam [94] 

 
The prerequisite for carrying out a good quantitative volumetric study is a high X-ray 

scattering contrast between the interested objects and background. The results reveal that X-ray 
tomography is very suitable to study cellular materials due to X-ray scattering contrast from the 
air and the strut materials is usually good enough to be processed by imaging analysis.  
 
2.7 3D structure model and Finite Element Analysis 
  

Very recently, numerical techniques such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) have been 
developed to simulate cellular materials’ mechanical properties to Polyurethane foam [94, 105], 
Polyvinylchloride Foams [106] and Nickel metallic foam [107]. This was particularly successful 
using computerized X-ray tomography to render actual 3D structure of foam for FEA calculation. 
However, X-ray tomography method only covers small fraction of the foam which may introduce 
inaccuracy when the foam’s microstructure is not homogeneous. In addition, the high cost of FEA 
method that requires tremendous computing capacity may limit its application. It is noteworthy 
that state-of-the-art X-ray tomography technique is able to provide resolution as good as 1 µm, 
thus leaving behind the study of smaller objects such as MWNTs (10-30 nm in diameter) 
embedded in composite material. Nevertheless, Tomography aided FEA method becomes more 
and more popular in composite material design to study mechanical properties of heterogeneous 
materials or components with non-trivial geometry, which can not be covered by analytical 
approach. We adopted this technique in study of cellular structure and mechanical property of the 
3D structure by FEA. It proves the effectiveness in using non-destructive testing method to study 
the interior structure of ceramic foams, which, otherwise was impossible to study by any other 
means. The study starts with Tomography Image Processing using “AMIRA” or “AVIZO” which 
is commercially available to carry out the structure visualization. The structure was then 
converted into model by ImageJ which is compatible with the finite element program 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

“Abaqus/CAE” for simulation of mechanical properties. 
 
 The reconstruction of 3D structure is preceded with steps below: 

1. Input the original slices image stack into AMIRA 
2. Displaying the bounding box to check the size of volume to process is suitable 
3. Applying Noise Reduction Filtering to smoothen the background  
4. material labelling which distinguish the ceramics strut and air in slice image 
5. generate 3D structure of cellular structure 
6. Generate tetrahedron elements for grid file (*.inp) into FEM program 

 
Once obtained the grid file, the file is used as input model into Abaqus/CAE for calculation. 

Abaqus/CAE is software developed by SIMULA, USA for finite element analysis. The structure 
produced in AMIRA is applied with boundary conditions that no surface will move except in 
Z-axis direction there is an applied displacement. The strut properties of ceramics foam has to be 
specified also before calculation. The Young’s modulus and the Poisson ration are given from 
experiment of the bulk ceramics. The displacement is applied uniformly downward to produce 
compressive deformation and the force reacted as result of this displacement for this material is 
calculated. The reaction force component in Z-axis is used to calculate the stress on the 
compressed surface and hence the modulus. It is also noticed that the Von Mises stress is 
calculated as output file and the stress distribution across the ceramics body will be shown in 
colour contour map. This is useful since by comparing the calculated Von mises stress to the 
flexural strength from experiment we can determine when and where the ceramics will fracture 
and fail. The elastic properties can also be estimated from this simulation avoiding the machining 
hardship to ceramic foams introduced previously. The elastic properties of the ceramics foam by 
taking into account of hollow structure inside struts are compared to the modulus from Impulse 
Excitation measurement to check the validity of the model and effectiveness of FEM analysis.

Chapter 3: Experimental preparation 
 
3.1 Ceramic Suspension  
  
The ceramics suspension also known as slurry is made by aqueous dispersion method. The 
precursor powder was supplied by Rauschert. The powder is a mixture of natural minerals 
containing non-stoichiometric composition of Corundum (?-Al2O3), Talc (triclinic), ?-Quartz 
(SiO2), K-feldspar, Mullite (Al6Si2O13), Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), trace amount of Calcite, 
Cristobalite, and glassy phase. The powder density measured by Pyconometry is around 3.0g/cm3 
at 20oC. The suspension was made with a set of optimized parameters from previous work of 
Susana et al [83]. Hence, 45 vol% solid loading was applied by 0.8 wt.% Targon 1128 dispersant. 
Each batch of slurry contains 189.1 g of powder, 89.2 g of water and 1.5 g of Targon 1128 that 
were mixed. The Targon 1128 was firstly added into the distilled water and then the precursor 
powder was slowly added into the mixture under mechanical stirring in a glass beaker of 200 ml. 
After mechanical stirring of 5 mins, the slurry was transferred into a plastic bottle filled with 
alumina balls of different sizes and ball milled. The as-prepared suspension contains a lot of 
particle agglomerates in presence of dispersing agent. Therefore the suspension was subject to 
ball milling at low speed only to destroy the particle agglomeration. The particle size will not be 
reduced versus time with modest force upon particle analysis by Laser diffraction method. The 
schematic illustration of preparation of suspension is shown in Fig. 3.1.

3.2 Slip casting and dry pressing   

 
The dense ceramic are prepared in two ways namely, slip casting and dry pressing. The slip 

casting is based on the ceramics suspension prepared in previous section that is cast onto plaster 
mould until the cast body becomes completed dried. Then the cast body is transferred to oven at 
80oC for 24 h until it reaches constant mass. However the deformation of slip cast sample is 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   

 35

serious due particle size segregation and a density gradient derived from a decreasing driving 
force as cake thickness increases. The slip cast sample must be grounded to achieve parallelism of 
surface for flexural strength measurement. The alternative route to prepare green body for 
flexural strength measure is using method introduced by A. Goel et al [108] that use 5 vol.% PVA 
solution corresponding to 2.5 wt.% PVA+97.5 wt.% powder). In our case, the rectangular bars of 
green state were prepared with PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) solution prepared by the following: 1.7 
wt.% PVA solution of 200 ml was magnetically stirred in warm water (65 oC) for 7h until the 
PVA is completed dissolved as the solution becomes transparent. The PVA solution was then 
sprayed onto the as-supplied granulated powder of 400 g in a rotary mixer for uniform coating of 
PVA. The mixture of PVA solution and powder was seen as paste-like material due to excessive 
hydration with big particle agglomeration. Therefore the paste was grounded to smaller particles 
and filtered with 500 µm sieve to achieve uniform particle distribution. The powder was then 
dried in air for 24 h and the initial hydration of aforementioned filtered powder must be measured 
by drying a batch of mass 3.2 g in an oven at 90 oC until it reaches constant mass. The hydration 
was found around 15 wt. %. The complete time dependent drying behaviour of the 
aforementioned powder is presented in Fig. 3.2.

hydration could be controlled precisely by elapse of drying time with those parameters 
determined in Fig. 3.2. However, after applying the PVA solution, the pressed sample is still not 
pressed well after drying in air for 1 day due to unsuitable humidity level as seen in Fig. 3.3. 
Therefore, the drying-pressing strategy needs to be re-evaluated in our investigation to find the

optimal conditions of dry pressing.

Fig. 3.4 show dry pressing behaviour with 2 hydration 0 and 2.5 wt. % at the same PVA 

binder wt. %. The hydration was achieved by following the time dependent drying curve in Fig. 
3.2. It is clearly illustrated that a decrease of the hydration to 2.5 wt. % in powder enabled a very 
successful pressing with perfect shape as seen in Fig. 3.4. However the bar has to be completely 
dried before sintering. Therefore, further decrease of hydration to 0 wt. % was test for shaping 
capability. The bars however, showed small cracks at the edge or corner during handling or 
transporting in Fig. 3.4. This proved that completely dried powder with PVA binder is not 
preferential for dry-pressing. A suitable level of hydration is beneficiary to make the sample 
crack-resistant during handling and pre-sintering. With experimental evidences shown above, we 
conclude that at most 2.5 wt. % hydrated powder is suitable for dry pressing however we expect 
to see a more optimized hydration between 2.5wt. % and 0 wt. % upon further experiments.

Polymer replica method is used to make ceramics foam. The polymer was supplied with three 
microstructure specification, namely 8 PPI, 22 PPI, and 30 PPI (PPI, Pore Per Inch). A visual 
inspection of the cell microstructure reveals that the 8 PPI and 22 PPI foam has an open cell 
structure. However 30 PPI polymer foam do not show significant open cell structure.  
 

The manufacturing of ceramics foams is based on polymeric replica impregnated with 
ceramics slurry and involves multiple stages: The first step is to prepared ceramics slurry that has 
been introduced previously. The step by step procedures of making of ceramics foams at specific 
wt. % dispersant in this investigation and characterization are also presented in Fig. 3.5.

Excitation method. The polymer replica was impregnated with ceramic suspension with and 
without thickening agent to explore the best strategy to obtain homogeneous impregnation. The 
procedures of impregnation are following: i) pour the suspension onto the polymer replica; hand 
pressing should be applied to allow the suspension to flow into the interior structure of the 
polymer replica. However, excess suspension usually stay on the surface of polymer struts and, 
therefore, the coated polymer replica should be squeezed after impregnation to remove excessive 
slurry. The amount of suspension coating the polymer replica can be characterized by the weight 
ratio of polymer struts (PS) + impregnating suspension (PS+IS) to polymer struts (PS).  
 

The polymer replica is referred to the polymer foam without impregnation. In our 
investigation, 300 mL of 45 vol% solid loading ceramic slurry was require to impregnate 200-300 
cm3 polymer replicas with dispersant and thickening agents. The weight ratio (PS+IS)/PS was 
recorded from the time of impregnation until the slurry impregnated foam was completely dried. 
This is proved to be crucial to obtain a good dispersion of cordierite slurry which has high 
viscosity. The slurry was impregnated at room temperature and placed in air for 24 h in order to 
remove the water gently to avoid crack on the surface. Then the green ceramic foams were 
subject to drying in oven at 90 oC for 12 h to completely dry the foam until constant mass before 
sintering.  
 

There are two main parameters can be varied in dispersion preparation, such as the solid 
loading (vol. %) and the amount of dispersant (wt. %). The combination of these two parameters 
will be seen as the most influential factors to the mechanical properties. However, we only use 
the optimized parameters according to Susana et al [83] with 45 vol.% loading and 0.8 wt.% 
Targon 1128. In our investigation we examined the effect of rheological property on 
impregnation behaviour by adding 0.2 and 0.5 wt. % thickening agent “CMC” (Carboxymethyl 
Cellulose) to increase the viscosity of the suspension. The viscosity was seen very influential in 
the impregnation for instance, the suspension without CMC show high flow ability that hardly 
any suspension will rest on the polymer struts after impregnation and the suspension settled to the 
bottom. On the other hand, highly viscous suspension was obtained by adding 0.5 wt.% CMC 
after 1 h mixing in ball milling showed insufficient flow character for a proper impregnation of 
smaller polymeric structures, resulting in highly inhomogeneous distribution of the suspension 
upon squeezing. This has important negative effects to the homogeneity hence the applicability of 
the as-produced foams. Based on this fact, 0.2 wt.% CMC added suspension was chosen as 
optimal condition to prepare the ceramic suspensions with a good ability to coat the fine 
structured polymeric replicas, while suspensions containing 0.5 wt.% CMC were selected for 
impregnating larger pore size (8 PPI) replicas.  



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

The drying behaviour was recorded in order to determine the optimal weight fraction of 

suspension to be impregnated with polymer replica. This is due to the fact that removal of 
excessive suspension after impregnation was manual based and it is not easy to control the 
suspension fraction by hand squeezing unless the weight is recorded. It turns out to be the most 
effective parameter in terms of controlling the homogeneity of the foam from impregnation.  
 
3.4 Sintering and Post-treatment 

 
Sintering was carried out for bulk ceramics and ceramics-coated polymer foam. The sintering 

temperature was conducted at 1250 oC and 1350 oC. This choice is based on XRD study shown 
later on that cordierite phase only form within temperature window above 1250oC. In addition, 
1350 oC is the maximum temperature of the furnace available for sintering ceramic coated 
polymer replica. Sintering at higher temperature such as 1425 oC and 1500 oC is possible for bulk 
ceramics. The bulk ceramics sintered at 1500 oC showed significant fractures or defects. This was 
attributed to formation of liquid phase above 1460 oC due to cordierite melting and hence the gas 
bubble occurred appeared in liquid phase. These results showed good properties were unlikely to 
be obtaining for sintering temperatures higher than 1350 oC. Stepwise sintering experiments were 
also carried out at 950 ºC and 1050 oC to study the phase transformation of original precursor 
powder along the temperature profile. The sintering schedule for slip cast bulk ceramics sample is 
illustrated in Fig. 3.6, consisting of a ramp of 5 ºC/min up to 1350 oC, a holding time of 2 h, 
followed by natural cooling.  

 

 
Fig. 3.6: Sintering schedule of bulk ceramics 

 
The coated polymer replicas were sintered following a different schedule due to the slow 

burning out of the polymer struts. Susana [83] described the burning out of polymer struts should 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

be carried out gradually with small temperature ramp rate in order to minimise the crack of coated 
ceramics due to different thermal expansion properties of polymer and ceramics. The thermal 
heated stress will crack the ceramics before its densification if heating was carried out too rapidly. 
Therefore the temperature ramp for polymer burning out stage was set as 1oC/min up to 600 oC, 
followed by a holding time of 1 h. After the burning out, a ramp 5oC/min from 600 oC to 1250 or 
1350 oC was applied with a holding time of 2 h at the maximum set temperatures. After that, the 
furnace switched off automatically and the samples cooled down naturally to room temperature in 
the furnace. The sintering temperature versus time history is presented in Fig. 3.7. 

 

 
Fig. 3.7: sintering schedule of ceramics coated polymer foam 

 
Sintered ceramic foams of 8 PPI and 22 PPI sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h were obtained as 

shown in Fig. 3.8. The ceramic foam was from impregnation of 0.5 wt. % CMC in suspension 
which increases the viscosity in order to avoid the de-coating of slurry from the surface of the 
struts. This was particularly beneficiary as seen in the Fig. 3.8 that 8PPI has homogeneous 
structure and excellent pore connection (left and middle) from visual inspection. The 
impregnation showed that the slurry could easily flow through the cellular structure and 
accumulate at the bottom, there 0.5 wt. % CMC was added to the slurry. However, the slurry the 
same slurry with 0.5 wt. % CMC showed less beneficiary impregnation to 22 PPI foam due to 
smaller pore size and higher viscous resistance to impregnation. 22 PPI foam started exhibiting 
partial closed cell with small fraction. The impregnation of 30 PPI foam with the 0.5 wt. % CMC 
slurry revealed to be completely ineffective as shown in Fig. 3.9. A visual inspection indicated 
that the as obtained ceramic foam consisted almost of closed cell structure and there were very 
few open cells. This is not favourable for most typical ceramic foams application such as molten 
metal filtration, catalyst coating and so on. This suggested that the rheological property should be 
tailor-made for various kinds of polymer replicas with different pore sizes.

 Fig. 3.10 next shows that homogeneous 22 PPI ceramic foams could be obtained when 
impregnation was made with a suspension containing 0.2 wt. % CMC, which exhibited suitable 
rheological properties to penetrate the sponge and coated the struts with enough adhesive force. 
Quantitative homogeneity could be referred to Impulse Excitation technique, however, Fig. 3.10 
(a) showed a high level of open cell which promise its application use; On the other hand, Fig. 
3.10 (b) showed considerable closed cell structure on the side of the foam. We concluded that the 
apparent closed cell on the side wall was due to the slurry concentration due to a suction effect of 
the slurry upon recovering its initial height after squeezing. However this is considered not as 
detrimental effect since the closed cell structure on side could provide additional mechanical 
strength but not deteriorating the flow capability through the cellular structure from top to bottom. 
This also suggested need of a quantitative mean to characterize the impregnation for completely 
open cell structure on top/bottom and side surfaces to ensure the distribution of the slurry is 
identical in each processing batch. For instance, the initial weight of slurry after impregnation 
with a highly open cell structure should be recorded and the ratio between the initial weight and 
weight of polymer replica should be calculated to determine the optimal impregnation parameters 
for 8 PPI and 22 PPI foams.  
  

 The 22 PPI foam seen in Fig. 3.10 was impregnated with slurry modified with 0.2 wt. % 
CMC at (PS+IS)/PS ratio of 20. Fig. 3.10 (a) and (b) showed the top and side view of ceramics 
foam. A comparison was made from Fig. 3.10 (c) and (d) show the top view and side view of 
polymer replica before impregnation. This experiment also suggested that a suitable weight ratio 
between initial slurry to polymer replica could provide highly open cell structure. However, the

open cell on side of ceramics foam was seen very poor due to squeezing after impregnation to 
remove excessive slurry. The slurry was then remained on both sides. Nevertheless, this is not a 
problem for application as the ceramics foam with enough connectivity in its top-bottom 
direction is required for actual application. The high concentration of ceramics struts on side 
could provide enhanced additional strength without affecting any filtration applications.

Chapter 4: Results and Analysis  
 
The characterization of starting material is very important for understanding final properties 

of the bulk ceramics with different sintering schedules. In addition, the parameters such as 
particle size distribution, of as-supplied powder may also affect the green body properties that are 
studied. The rheological behaviour of ceramic suspensions prepared as describe in Chapter 3 was 
studied. The drying-out behaviour of impregnated foams was shown in details by evolution of 
weight ratio (PS+IS)/PS. The IE measurement evaluates the homogeneity of foam and was 
performed for selective samples. In addition, X-ray tomography was conducted to study the 
interior structure of foams and provided 3D actual structural model for Finite Element Analysis. 
On the other hand, the properties of dense struts of ceramic foams, i.e., microstructure, 
mechanical properties and compositional variation as function of sintering temperature and time 
were also studied for optimizing the processing conditions. The dielectric properties were also 
studied in order to learn about the best sintering schedule and the potential of sintered ceramics 
for electronic applications. 
 
4.1 Characterization of starting powder 
  
4.1.1 Particle size distribution 

 
Fig. 4.1 shows the evolution of particle size distribution of as-received powder versus ball 

milling time. The as-received powder has a wide distribution and large mean particle size (the 
size for which half vol. % of the particles is smaller and the other half is bigger) of 13.2 µm with 
a tail extending up to &gt; 100 µm. It is supposed that larger sizes are due to the presence of particle 
agglomerates and this was confirmed by SEM later on. Fig. 4.1 also shows that particle size 
distribution gradually narrows down and means size shifts towards smaller sizes with increasing 
ball milling time. After 24 h of ball milling the und mean value was ~6.8 µm, with a small 
fraction of tail extending up to ~50 µm. The mean particle sizes decreased to ~4.7 to ~2.5 µm 
after 1 and 2 weeks of ball milling, respectively. All suspension subject to ball milling has been 
prepared as previously described with 0.8 wt. % dispersant of Targon 1128.

Fig. 4.1: particle distribution of as-received powder versus ball milling time 

 
From the green body compacting point of view, smaller particle size and narrower particles 

size distribution lead to more homogeneous microstructure in the green body and hence less 
deformation after sintering. Neto et al [81] summarized the effect of particle size in relation to the 
sintering and concluded that particle size which normally limits the reactivity from the mixture of 
natural materials such as Talc, kaolin and alumina as most typical ingredients. Destruction of 
aggregates increases the specific area and reduces the distance between the particles and hence 
lowers the sintering temperature at which cordierite phase forms. Meanwhile, the particle size 
distribution plays important role in green density gradient in slip cast sample due to gravity effect 
during consolidation. The clogging effect that occurs in slip casting might even predominate over 
the gravity effect as explained by Ferreira et al [109]. In one word, the occurrence of particle 
segregation from gravity or clogging during the consolidation process will deteriorate the shaping 
ability and the reliability of the green body. The inhomogeneity of the particle packing also 
causes deformations after sintering due to differential shrinkage. In addition, the morphology of 
the particles also determines the packing ability of a powder with rounded particles being 
considered to have higher ability to closely fill the space. Milewski et al [110] showed that the 
green density could be significantly decreased when increasig the particle aspect ratio. The SEM 
observations in our investigation later on revealed that the particles of precursor powder are not 
spherical but exhibit a platelet-like morphology due to existence of talc and kaolinite.  

 
In the present investigation, dense and cellular ceramics were made from the suspension with 

ball milling for 1 week in order to achieve good reactivity and compacting ability with mean 
particle size of 4.7 µm.

4.1.2 XRD study of composition 
 
The starting powder consists of natural mineral materials without disclosed composition. 

Therefore X-ray analysis was carried out with Philip PANAnalytical X’Pert Multipurpose Powder 
Diffractometer (MPD) at Central Analytical Lab (LCA), University of Aveiro. Fig. 4.2 shows the 
XRD pattern of starting powder from 8o to 95o with angular step of 0.02o. The present of minor 
phase or deviations from the stoichiometric cordierite will lead to the formation of secondary 
phases as predicted from the MgO-SiO2-Al2O3 phase diagram in Fig.1.1. In such context, the 
quantitative phase analysis (QPA) based on X-ray diffraction using standard silicon powder as 
internal reference was conducted. This method using internal reference is also favourable in 
quantifying glassy phase in reaction in big fraction.

Fig. 4.2: XRD phase analysis of starting powder 

 
The XRD results revealed the powder is a complex mixture of several natural materials or 

rare synthetic mineral such mullite. It contains at least of 7 types of minerals of crystalline phase 
namely corundum, ?-quartz, Talc, Kaolinite, mullite, K-feldspar and Cristobalite (product of 
pre-calcinations of kaolinite) with ICDD PDF code. However there are still very few minor peaks 
left un-indexed and we consider that this is difficult due to the complexity of the as-supplied 
material. It is also noticed that there is a hump from 15-30º, which Johnson [111] has attributed to 
the presence of kaolinite calcined at low temperature (900 oC). The raw powder also shows 
existence of mullite, probably derived from kaolinite calcined at higher temperatures. 
 

The silicon and starting powder were mixed by planetary ball milling for homogeneity and 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

then studied by XRD. The phase quantities were determined by Rietveld method as shown in Fig. 
4.2. The Rietveld refinement plots show the green (observed) and the red (calculated) curves, as 
well as the difference (blue) curve between measured and calculated data. 
 

 
 

Fig. 4.3: Rietveld refinement of Cordierite raw mix powder, Rw (%) =17, Sig=4.2 
 

Fig. 4.3 shows a reluctant agreement between the experimental and simulated curves. 
Nevertheless, the agreement is acceptably good provided the complexity of the starting material. 
The QPA was performed with software “Siroquant” developed by Sietronics Australia 
(http://siroquant.com/) under agreement of trial use to the program supplier. The result was 
validated by comparing the wt. % (16.68 wt. %) of silicon added to the starting powder to the wt. 
% refined from Rietveld refinement, 20 wt. %. The slight difference is likely due to imperfection 
of crystallinity of silicon powder. The result of quantitative phase compositions after 
re-calibration respective to pre-determined silicon wt.5 is shown in Table 4.1.

Siroquant is newly appeared commercial software in Rietveld refinement for QPA and some 

comments are given by the supplier regarding the Siroquant results: the Chi2 or goodness of fit 
number is approximately 3.4 and this is typical and Rw factor is good. The silicon content from 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   

 47

Rietveld refinement is slightly higher (17% weighed to 20% by refinement). This is acceptable 
considering the crystallinity of the sample. The Cristobalite phase is not a perfect fit meaning that 
the existence of this phase is in doubt but it is believed this was the best option. In one word, 
Siroquant provides quite satisfactory results compared to all programs available. However, the 
price of such program limited our further use after trial. In our following investigation, only 
MAUD is used to conduct QPA for XRD. 
 

As previously addressed in 1.2 Chapter 1, sintering of cordierite via solid state route usually 
requires temperature above 1350 oC. In the present study, Talc and kaolin in the composition are 
found that would supposedly decrease the crystallization temperature, compared to the synthesis 
using pure metal oxides according to [11]. Also, Antisiferov et al [30] showed that compositional 
variations significantly affect the properties of cordierite and a preliminary calcinations of Talc 
has a considerable influence on the mechanical properties of cordierite formed by single stage 
solid state sintering. And, Talc could be obtained from a blend composition containing feldspar or 
pegmatite. Therefore, n the composition of Rauschert blend we found the K-feldspar which is 
added as fluxing agent in order to reduce liquidation temperature and hence allowing sintering in 
presence of liquid phase. 
 
4.1.3 DTA/TGA study  

 
The thermal properties and the sintering schedule of the as-supplied starting powder were 

studied by DTA/TGA. The DTA/TGA ramp rates were set at 5 oC/min (the same used in the 
sintering - Fig. 4.4) and at 10 oC/min (Fig. 4.5).

minerals present in the composition, namely of Kaolinite at about 450-550 ºC – centred at about 

507 ºC and due to the loss of structural water, and Talc (and eventually minor amounts of other 

associated minerals such as Chlorite, Chrysotile and Calcite) at about 680-730 ºC–centred at 

about 704 ºC, and at 880-940 ºC, due to the loss of structural water and accompanied by the 

formation of ensatite (MgSiO3) and silica [20, 112]. Fig. 4.4 also shows that DTA signal has low 

intensity to noise ratio, probably due to the low heating rate that mitigates the thermal differential 

effects between the sample and the standard material. 

 

Fig. 4.5 shows the DTA/TGA plots of precursor powder at a heating rate of 10 oC/min. It can 

be seen that the endothermic peaks were shifted to higher temperatures, as expected, while the 

peaks appear are of higher intensity. The result also showed that the signal to noise ratio was 

improved for measurement at higher heating rate. Gonzales-Velasco et al [113] studied DTA 

curve of mixture with similar composition of 20.6 wt.% alumina, 34.5 wt.% kaolin, 40.4 wt.% 

talc, and 4.5 wt.% silica at higher rate, i.e., 15 oC per min, in which the first endothermic peak 

was in range of 550-650 oC while the second is around 900-950 oC. It appeared that the higher the 

temperature ramp the bigger shift to higher temperature peak, therefore the DTA study of phase 

transformation should be used with care when the heating conditions vary.

The peak at first endothermic around between 500-550 oC also corresponds to transition of 

kaolin into metakaolin by losing hydroxyl group, OH and transition from ?-quartz to ?-quartz 
according to [113]. The XRD study in Fig. 4.6 revealed the result that kaolin’s peak at 12.5o has 
disappeared since metakaolin has amorphous structure. It is apparent that second endothermic 
peak was followed around 700-750 oC and this is supposed corresponding to the transition of Talc

to protoensatite which is high temperature polymorph of ensatite (Mg2Si2O6), amorphous silica 
and water vapour according to [113]. However, the Quantitative Phase Analysis suggested that 
relative wt. % Talc has decreased but no apparent identification of protoensatite therefore the 
protoensatite transition is not mandatory.

curve. The likely reason to account for this difference could be lying with the fact that the 
DTA/TG test was run in inert atmosphere (Ar) while the sintering was conducted in air rich in 
oxygen. However, oxidization could not affect the amount of mullite and corundum. The problem 
was considered due to presence of other components of materials present in the starting powder 
that is not revealed due to commercial secret. Nevertheless, an in-situ XRD experiment in 
vacuum is expected to address the problem discussed above.

Finally, the peaks above 1300oC does not correspond to any transition of single oxides in the 

precursor powder but only their fusion according to [113]. The peak that is seen around 1309oC is 
therefore associated with the solid state reaction to form a-Cordierite that takes place between 
1250-1400oC according to [113]. This study was also carried out in our XRD with variable 
sintering temperature and similar agreement was found.  

 
4.1.4 SEM study of morphology 

 
SEM studied the particle morphology and size distribution of starting powder. Fig. 4.8 shows 

strong particle agglomeration from the as-supplied precursor powder. It is also seen that the 
powder is in laminar morphology and the laminar structure appears to be in range of 2-10 µm 
similar to that found by particle size analyzer in Fig. 4.1. Those laminar flakes that situated at the 
top surface of the bigger particle underneath are picked up and a semi-quantitative image analysis 
with Feret diameters (The longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary 
of particle) of particles were evaluated by ImageJ* to determine the particle size distribution in 
Fig. 4.9.

Fig. 4.9 shows image analysis results from measurement of particles’ dimensions along its 

longest axis. The number of particles that fall into certain size range is plotted versus the particle 
size therefore one could also obtain a semi-quantitative particle size distribution. The distribution 
showed that the most probable particle size is around 16 µm which drop significantly over 25 µm 
and approach to zero when the particle sizes is over 40 µm. This result is in agreement to the 
particle analysis that is found by laser diffraction around 13.19 µm.

4.2 Rheological and drying behaviour 
 

The rheological properties of the suspension prepared with 45 solid vol.% loading and 
dispersed with 0.8 wt.% Targon 1128 were characterised the flow ability and viscosity. The ideal 
suspension must have adequate fluid character so as to impregnate the polymer replica thoroughly 
and uniformly, even for small cell size foams such as 22 PPI. However, it is difficult to make a 
good impregnation when the viscosity is too low and fluid character is too accentuated. This is 
particularly important in case of impregnating 8 PPI polymer which has rather large cell size. The 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

viscous character of the suspension is expected to be appropriately adjusted to enable a thin and 
uniform coating layer on the polymer struts.  

 
Fig. 4.10 (upper portion) shows the flow (shear stress vs. shear rate) curves, and the 

corresponding viscosity vs. shear rate curves, respectively, for: (1) the starting suspension 
(containing 45 vol.% solids loading dispersed with 0.8 wt.% Targon in absence of thickening 
agent); (2) the starting suspension with added 0.2 wt.% of CMC as thickening agent; (3) the 
starting suspension with added 0.5 wt.% of CMC as thickening agent; (4) the suspension (3) but 
tested a second time after being at rest for 2 min. The pink curve in Fig. 4.10 (bottom, left), is the 
water dynamics viscosity ~0.001003 at RT for comparison [114].

From Fig. 4.10 (top), it can be seen that suspension (1) exhibits shear thinning behaviour 
along the whole shear rate range tested. The shear thinning characteristics within the low shear 
rate range (up to about 385 1/s) gradually accentuated with increasing amounts of CMC (curves 2 
&amp;amp; 3). However, the shear stress reaches maximum values at about 385 1/s), decreasing as the 
shear rate further increases. Such a decrease can be interpreted as: (i) a break down effect of 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

CMC chains under high shear rates. In that case, the resulting shorter molecular chains will not be 
able to bind to the same number of particles as before, and the viscosity is expected to decrease; 
(ii) an alignment of the adsorbed polymer chains along the flow direction, thus offering less 
resistance to flow. In order to ascertain which of the above phenomena would prevail in the 
present circumstances, the suspension (3) was tested a second time after being at rest for 2 min. 
The resulting curve 4 shows an overall similar trend, but with less levels of shear stress being 
required to deform the system. These results support the hypothesis that the CMC chains are 
somewhat degraded under high shear rates, but do not contradict the possibility for the adsorbed 
polymer chains to alignment along the flow direction. Accordingly, both should be considered at 
the present stage. More detailed studies will be required to shed further light on this issue, 
including higher number of repeated shear rate/shear stress tests with the same suspension and 
longer rest times between the tests, which are beyond the scope of this thesis.  

 
The relevant practical information that can be drawn from Fig. 4.10 with the aim of pursuing 

the objectives of thesis are as follows:  (i) increasing added amounts of CMC enhance the 
structuring effect of the suspensions at rest and near rest conditions, therefore, hindering the flow 
after impregnation of the polymeric replicas, thus contributing to obtain ceramic foams with 
uniform density; (ii) CMC binder should be dosed according to the structure of the polymeric 
sponge replicas; (iii) the suspensions with added CMC should not be submitted to high shear rate 
regimes since the degradation of polymeric chains occurring under that conditions will alter the 
rheological properties and thus, the control over the process. 
 

Another way to characterize the suspension impregnation behaviour is to study the weight 
change of the polymer strut immediately after impregnation until fully dried. The polymer foam is 
often excessively coated and the excess suspension might block the cell open structure. The 
control of impregnation and open cell ratio vs. close cell can be obtained by the amount of 
ceramics slurry impregnated onto polymer struts. The experiment of impregnation vs. polymer’s 
weight is illustrated in Fig. 4.11 and Fig. 4.12. The polymer after impregnation has to be squeezed 
to remove apparent excessive slurry to leave most of the cellular structure as open cells. However, 
if the slurry was removed too much the coating will be inadequate to cover the struts. Therefore, a 
trial-and-error experiment was planned to achieve homogeneous open cell structure and the 
(PS+IS) vs. drying time was recorded. It was found that the (PS+IS)/PS weight ratios have to be 
different for the 8 PPI foams if homogeneous coatings are to be obtained. The ratio was 
determined by the weight of (PS) and impregnated slurry (IS) immediate after impregnation 
(PS+IS) to the polymer struts weight (PS) shown in Fig. 4.11 and Fig. 4.12. The optimized ratio 
for coating 8 PPI and 22 PPI were found to be 16 and 20 respectively. This is considered an

effective mean of one-off control to microstructure based on impregnation since once the slurry 
dries out it is not possible to impregnate any more slurry.

4.3 Composition and Microstructure of bulk 
  

XRD was employed to study the composition relationship versus sintering schedule. 
Pyconometry was applied to measure the bulk density of the sample prepared under different 
sintering schedules. However, the relative density is not straightforward to obtain since the 
ceramic has a complex composition instead of being monophonic and monolithic. SEM study was 
performed to characterize the porosity of 2D surface which was assisted with quantitative image 
analysis under the assumption that 3D porosity is represented from image analysis. The porosity 
is related to relative density and compared to density calculation from XRD and relative density 
measurement by Archimedes method. The thermal expansion properties and thermo-mechanical 
stability (thermal shock resistance) are relevant for refractory applications. The foams made of 
cordierite-mullite ceramics were studied with non-destructive Computed X-ray tomography 
yielding actual 3D information of microstructure and providing the basis of numerical simulation 
for mechanical properties. Impulse Excitation technique was used to measure the Young’s 
modulus and foam’s homogeneity in order to counter the problem of machining the ceramics with 
precise geometry. Flexural and Compressive strength are characterized by unidirectional 
compression to give basic parameters for mechanical properties. In addition to this, the cordierite 
is also one of the most promising materials to replace current Integrated Circuits (IC) substrate 
that electronics industry requires due to its low-? (dielectric constant). Therefore dielectric 
properties are shown at Room temperature. 
 
4.3.1 XRD study  

 
Fig. 4.13 showed result of X-ray pattern from the sintered product of powder raw mix. The 

pattern was analyzed using JADE MDI 5.0 first and we discovered that the cordierite phase has 
formed and occupy the primary proportion in the sintered body while mullite and Al2O3 are left 
presumably due to non-stoichiometry mixing that excessive mullite and Al2O3 are not consumed 
during sintering. All diffraction peaks well above the background is indexed and it is safe to say 
that the powder raw mix which consists of at least 5 minerals has now transformed into a mixture 
of Cordierite, Alumina, Mullite and small amount of residual quartz and cristobalite.

     Fig. 4.13: XRD phase analysis of sintered powder at1350oC for 2h 

 
Fig. 4.14 shows one example of quantitative phase analysis by using MAUD. The method is 

based on whole pattern refinement also known as Rietveld refinement. The refinement showed 
that the weighted residual factor is around 21% and the goodness-of-fit is 2.7. The result is 
consistent with the general guideline for QPA for mixture of complex phase required the Rwp is 
around 15% and GOF is around 2. However numerous attempts were tried in order to improve the 
fitting without success. The refinement for other XRD patterns showed similar Rwp and GOD 
(are not shown here) indicates that general error may occur in QPA interpretation. However we 
have to bear in mind with the fact discovered in Chapter 2 that MAUD is most favourable 
software in QPA in case of mixture of simple oxides. Therefore we show the QPA results that are 
given in Table 4.2

4.3.2 Variable temperature XRD 

As we have seen from phase diagram in Chapter 1, the ternary (MgO-SiO2-Al2O3) phase 
diagram (Fig. 1.1) is very complex in terms of phase transition and the phase evolution with 
temperature. Therefore, the as-supplied starting powder was studied using variable temperature 
XRD at different temperatures from 950 to 1500oC. The temperature variable XRD patterns are 
seen in Fig. 4.15. 

 
Fig. 4.16(a) shows another example of Rietveld refinement for the sample heat treated at 

1250 oC, 2 h, and the quality of fit in terms sig=3.31, Rexp(%)=7.35, Rw(%)=24.39. A convention 
for good Rietveld refinement is Rw (%)&amp;lt;5. For complex mixtures of the phases, the Rw (%) is 
expected to be around 15-20. In our refinement, the Rw (%) is around 24 which are higher than 
this standard. However, it appears that further improvement is difficult to obtain since the (100) 
peak of cordierite around 10o is always underestimated. This is likely due to background 
developed from glassy phase which is not easy to be accounted for in refinement. Fig. 4.16(b) 
shows Rietveld analysis of sample sintered at 1425 oC for 2 h. All other Rietveld refinements 
showed similar quality as in Figure 4.16(a), (b) and are not shown here. The results from Rietveld 
QPA are plotted in Fig. 4.17 to observe compositional variation as function of sintering 
temperature.

The QPA study in Fig. 4.17 was only conducted with range between 950 - 1500 oC, which 

covers the temperature of cordierite crystallization according to the phase diagram in Fig. 1.1. 
One can see that the cordierite phase only exists within in a pretty narrow temperature range from 
1250 oC to 1425 oC, whilst the wt. % cordierite at 1350 oC appears to be highest across the range. 
Mullite was seen as continuously increasing and the some mullite existed in the as-received 
cordierite raw powder. Khezrabadi et al [115] studied the formation of mullite with similar 
composition of starting materials and SEM studies revealed that the formation of mullite is due to 
kaolin and excessive alumina in the batch. However the content of mullite continues to increase 
with temperature increasing, being the main phase at 1500 oC. Although mullite has better 
mechanical properties than cordierite, the sintered sample does not show such advantage. This is 
due to the abundant liquid phase formed during high temperature sintering at 1500 oC and the 
evolving gaseous phase leading to many micro cracks within the sample. In some cases the micro 
cracks become macro cracks which are visible to naked eye and this will significantly decrease 
the mechanical strength.  



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Corundum, ?-quartz and ?-Cristobalite are both seen decreasing as temperature goes up. At 

1425 oC, the other MAS oxide phases were completely reacted and monolithic cordierite (43 wt. 
%) and mullite (57 wt. %) are the only crystalline phases. Further increasing the temperature will 
cause melting of cordierite phase and mullite with highly porous structure due to cordierite 
melting is the single crystalline phase at 1500 oC.  

 

 
Fig. 4.17: Rietveld analysis of wt. % variation versus sintering temperature 

 
XRD study shows that the cordierite phase is single dominant ?-cordierite. This is in 

agreement with the work sintered with excess MgO mole ratio [11]. Xu et al [116] studied the 
cordierite synthesis via solid state reaction without additives from a mixture of rectorite 
(Na,Ca)Al4(Si,Al)8O20(OH)4•2(H2O), Talc and Alumina. The sintering was conducted between 
1200-1400 oC which is similar to this investigation. Xu found that the decomposition of cordierite 
takes place over 1350 oC and excessive liquid phase appeared and the sintered ceramics showed 
significant deformed shape and visible bubble formation on the surface as consequence. This 
result is in agreement to our findings from XRD result that cordierite phase disappeared above 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

1350 oC and the sintered sample has deformed shape and giant air bubbles across the body. 
According to X-ray diffraction data, Fig. 4.17, the formation of the cordierite phase seems to 
begin only above 1150 °C. This is somewhat higher than the result reported in [117]. However, 
we should be aware that additives such as Fe2O3, Bi2O3 and V2O5 were added, which significantly 
reduced the sintering temperature [117]. The sample consists of mullite, quartz, and magnesium 
silicate. It was also found that raising the additives wt.% and extending the heating time led to 
higher cordierite content, which is favorable for a higher mechanical strength and thermal 
stability of the monolith [117]. Nevertheless, the results reported by Johnson et al [111] that 
cordierite phase development started visibly at 1250oC is in good agreement with our results as 
seen in Fig. 4.17, showing the characteristics peak roundabout at 10.4o of 2?. The agreement is 
also found well between our results in Fig. 4.17 to [111] that at 1350 oC the cordierite was the 
major phase. The cordierite phase fraction was found by Rietveld refinement at around 53% 
which is very close to reported value of 52% calculated under similar conditions [111]. In [111] 
the study showed that upon further heating from 1350oC to 1420oC, the cordierite phase fraction 
increased up to 90%. However the cordierite phase sintered at 1425oC does not increase but 
decrease in our case illustrated in Fig. 4.17 and the mullite phase has continued to increase 
instead. This is due to the deficiency of MgO. Meanwhile, the characteristics peak was reported 
to diminish at 1440oC due to melting of cordierite phase [111]. This is in agreement with sample 
heat treated at 1500oC in our XRD study. We proposed excessive MgO introduced into the 
original powder could attain the higher formation of cordierite. 
 

The reason why the crystallization temperature of cordierite was found to be higher in our 
study compared to the phase diagram and other people’s work [27] is likely due to the 
compositional effects. Tsai et al [27] showed that the excess of SiO2 and Al2O3 will significant 
increase the activation energy of ?-cordierite formation and hence the temperature. Therefore the 
cordierite phase was only seen for heat treatment above 1250 oC as SiO2 and Al2O3 were 
abundant in the original powder.  

 
The QPA result shown in Fig. 4.17 has important implications in material design in case of 

using the as-supplied starting powder. The contents of cordierite and mullite have the most 
significant effects on the final properties and it is desirable to see that monolithic mullite and 
cordierite composite exists at 1425 oC.  
 

Fig. 4.18 shows the temperature/time dependent XRD phase composition of the compacted 
raw powder upon sintering under different indicated schedules. According to Montrosi et al [118] 
not only sintering temperature but also the time play important roles in the formation of 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

crystalline phases. Therefore, this XRD study versus time was conducted to see temporal effects 
on crystallization in Fig. 4.18.

pattern of 4 h compared to 1 h. The peak was ascribed to indialite instead of cordierite. The 
indialite is a polymorph of synthetic cordierite compared to natural cordierite. The comparison 
between patterns with indialite at 1150 oC for 4 h to that without indialite at 1150 oC for 1 h is 
illustrated in detail from Fig. 4.19. This result suggests that the indialite has not been formed after 
1 h at 1150 oC, but it requires a longer time at this temperature to crystallize. Its formation could 
be facilitated by additives that decrease the activation energy, as reported by Montrosi et al [118]. 
And when the temperature was further increased to 1250 oC for only 0.5 h, the crystallization 
takes place overwhelmingly into cordierite revealed by XRD.

The spinel phase was also found from 1150 to 1250oC regardless of sintering time. However, 

it became invisible in the pattern of 1350 oC, 0.5 h and reappeared in pattern of 1350 oC of 8 h as 
indicated in Fig. 4.20. This suggested that further increasing the time probably does not provide 
benefit in terms of cordierite formation from this powder of non-stoichiometry composition since 
the cordierite phase could transform to spinel which does not provide as good 
thermal/mechanical/electrical properties as cordierite. Gonzales-Velasco et al conducted the time 
variable XRD study on cordierite crystallization at 1400 oC and discovered that the ?-alumina 
and spinel was decreasing over increasing time and this is also supported by our data illustrated in 
Fig. 4.20 as the line corresponding to ?-alumina decreases over increasing time. However, 
contrary to that disclosed in [113], we detected spinel phase after heat treating for 8 h. The true 
cause of this peculiar finding is under investigation.  

 
The crystallization was seen to be clearly affected by the duration of heat treatment as 

demonstrated also in Fig. 4.20. The amorphous background was significant after 1 h of heat 
treatment, while the amorphous background decreased significantly upon increasing its duration. 
This suggests that crystallinity could be improved upon longer exposure to heat treatment. But 
this does not contradict to another route of improved crystallinity by adding nucleation agents 
such as TiO2.

The properties of cordierite composite ceramics were found closely related to the fraction 

between cordierite and mullite. Therefore, we conducted a semi-quantitative estimate of fraction 
ration between two phase by comparing the peak intensity from (100) of cordierite and (110) of 
mullite. The reason we chose these two peaks is that there is no other phase peak located at the 
same position and the peak intensity is solely contributed from each phase respectively. Although 
as previously introduce, the use of peaks’ intensity ratio is not the most reliable method for 
quantitative phase determinations. However, this comparison is made on the ratio of most intense 
peak between two phases existing in the same mixture, therefore it is safe to say that the ratio will 
give a semi-qualitative description whether the phase fraction is increased or vice versa. Figure 
4.21 shows that the ratio between cordierite (100) and mullite (110) reaches maximum from 
sample sintered for 2 h. This is consistent with XRD results presented in Fig. 4.20 showing that 
further increase of sintering time will likely promote spinel phase instead of increasing cordierite 
phase fraction. Therefore, we determined that 2 h is an optimal time for heat treatment of the 
original powder.

4.3.3 SEM study with quantitative image analysis 

The SEM micrographs of ceramics sintered at 1150, 1250, 1350 and 1500 oC for 2 h are 
shown in Fig. 4.22 to Fig. 4.24 and Fig. 4.26. The morphology changes as a function of sintering 
temperature. The mullite formation with its characteristics needle-like grains is not apparent from 
the lower sintering temperatures. The images were taken at two magnifications of x200 for 
porosity studies with quantitative image analysis and x3000 to reveal the presence of needle 
shape mullite grains. Fig. 4.22 (a) shows that the average pore size is very small compared to 
those at 1250 oC and 1350 oC. With increase of temperature, the average pore size increased 
significantly. Although no significant porosity differences could be observed between 1250 oC 
and 1350 oC, the changes in average pore size and shape (aspect ratio) are likely to affect the 
mechanical and thermal properties.

The mullite has needle-like grains usually from suitable heat treatment conditions, which act 
as an effective reinforcement for enhancing ceramics mechanical properties to resist fracture. 
However, SEM images do not show any mullite needle shape grain formation at 1150 oC. Instead, 
a laminar morphology is apparent, which then transforms into a more homogeneous structure 
with some needle-shape grains embedded within. This becomes still more evident from higher 
magnification SEM images (x 10 K and x 20 K) as shown in Fig. 4.25 (a) and (b). The XRD 
results of the sample heat treated at 1350 oC revealed the presence at mullite has largest fraction 
in cordierite matrix at 1350 oC and therefore the mullite formation is more visible in Fig. 4.25 
with somehow needle-like structure tips pointed outward and embedded in the cordierite matrix. 
Fig. 4.25 (b) showed microstructure of the same area with magnification of x20 K. It is more 
clearly shown that the mullite needle shape phase start to grow and appeared out of the cordierite 
matrix due to mullite’s distinct needle-like shape. However Fig. 4.25 (b) showed only tips of the 
needle shape mullite without knowledge of its length or aspect ratio. Therefore image analysis of 
mullite phase will not be performed since the area fraction of mullite tips cannot predict properly 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

the phase fraction of mullite to compare to XRD. 
 
Fig. 4.22 to Fig. 4.24 also revealed a fact that the pore cells has significantly increased over 

increasing sintering temperature. Although the porosity was decreasing however the pores sizes 
are increasing suggesting that the pore coalescence takes place as result of fusion of smaller pores 
into bigger one. This is actually an indication of densification process.

Fig. 4.26 shows two SEM pictures with different magnifications of ‘pure’ mullite (as 

detected by XRD) microstructure after sintering at 1500 oC for 2 h. Needle shape mullite grains 
embedded in a glassy phase are seen in Fig. 4.26 (b). This intermingled mullite crystals tend to 
enhance crack and fracture resistance. At higher magnification in Fig. 4.26 (a) a high density of 
large pores is also evident, which is supposed to have derived from gas release inside a liquid 
phase. The high porosity fraction tends to significantly decrease the mechanical properties despite 
the positive contribution of interlocking between the needle shape mullite grains.

The SEM method associated with image processing is importance to evaluate the relative 

density of sintered specimens due to lack of monolithic phase to evaluate the 100% dense density 
as a function of heat treatment conditions, such as temperature, time and additives. The relative 
density is proportional to the relative volume fractions of solid and gas (porosity) phases. 
Therefore, characterizing porosity is an easily way to determine the relative density for the 
complex composite materials. Conventionally, semi-quantitative method is applied by drawing 
lines randomly across the images and the length between intersected points and measure the size 
of pores. The average is then calculated from a collection of such length data and the average 
pore size is adopted based on the assumption that they are spherical. Nowadays, quantitative 
image analysis has become trendy in evaluation the information from first hand data. The pore 
normally has irregular shape and should not be approximated to a sphere. Therefore, Photoshop 
tool (magnetic lasso) is used to draw the actual shape of the pore and the pore with 2D actual 
shape is then highlighted as seen on the right hand side of Figs. 4.27 to 4.29. The 2D actual shape 
is considered as particles and the area fraction of those particles are analyzed in ImageJ. There are 
also a few assumptions that have to be made in this investigation. Quantitative image Analysis is 
reliable and applicable to predict the area fraction of the pore structure in 2D dimensions and the 
assumption has to be made that they have a similar dimension in depth direction. In addition, we 
took SEM images from 3 individual fracture surfaces and an average was taken to calculate the 
volume average porosity. 

 
The images were analyzed with ImageJ and one example was shown in Fig. 4.27 on the left 

to analyze porosity of bulk ceramics sintered at 1350oC for 2h. The structures were pre-processed 
in Photoshop and input into ImageJ for particle calculation. Similarly all other images are 
processed and calculated to yield the area fraction of particle and hence the relative density.  

  
Fig. 4.27: (1350oC for 2h): porosity8.8%, relative density: 91.2% 

 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

From the SEM microstructures analyzed by image processing, the calculated average relative 
porosity of the bulk ceramics sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h is 8.7%±0.36%. Therefore the relative 
density is 91.3%.  
 

This result is subject to comparison to the XRD phase fraction study and theoretical density 
of each phase. The XRD phase analysis showed that the main phases at 1350 oC for 2 h were 
?-Cordierite+mullite+?-Alumina+?-SiO2. The theoretical densities are reported in Table 1.1. The 
XRD phase fraction is in terms of wt.% and the wt.% is converted to vol.% in order to calculate 
the theoretical density of composite containing 52 wt.% Cordierite, 34.9 wt.% Mullite, 7.7 wt.% 
a-alumina and 1.6 wt.% ?-SiO2; The volume fraction for each phase are calculated from their 
respective density and determined as 56.7 vol.%, 35.3 vol.%, 5.9 vol.%, 2.1 vol.%, respectively. 
Based on results aforementioned, the theoretical density is calculated as 2.73 g/cm3. The 
measured apparent density (previous section) was ~2.52 g/cm3. Therefore, the relative density 
determined by the ratio between apparent and theoretical densities is 92%. The relative density 
estimated from SEM+Image analysis is 91.3%, and the result estimated from XRD and 
Pyconometry measurements indicates a relative density of 92%. The agreement is excellent. 
Therefore, the combination SEM and XRD shows good potential to estimate the relative density 
(and porosity fraction) in comparison to the procedure based on dimensions and weight 
measurements of the specimens. 
 

Similarly, SEM study was conducted to selected samples sintered at 1250 ºC and 1500 oC to 
see morphology and the porosity. The semi-quantitative analysis was not applied to sample at 
1150 oC since the pores are too small to identify in ImageJ. The results are shown in Table 4.3.  

 
Table 4.3: porosity determination by semi-quantitative image analysis 

Sample  2D porosity (%) 
1500 oC (2 h) ~32.4 
1350 oC (2 h) ~10 
1250 oC (2 h) ~3.1* 

 
In addition to the SEM and XRD studies, the true density of original powder and sintered 

material in polycrystalline form at different conditions were studied with Pyconometry method. 
The SEM study has proved that the bulk ceramics are not fully dense but exhibit a porous 
structure with ~10% porosity. The pores are enclosed in the bulk sample and not accessible by the 
measurement media in Pyconometry method which causes significant error. Therefore 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Pyconometry studies must be carried out using the sintered powder without closed pores. Prior to 
measurement, the powder after sintering was subject to hand grinding in alumina crucible with 
vigorous force for 30 mins until the powder appeared to be fine powder without visible bigger 
particles. The examples of SEM images for the powdered sintered at 1350 oC and 1250 oC for 2 h 
are illustrated in Fig 4.28 and Fig. 4.29, respectively, suggesting that no pores remained inside the 
particles. With this proof in hand, we are certain that the Pyconometry measurement provides the 
true density of the materials after sintering. It should be mentioned that the fraction of open pores 
versus closed pores are possible to be characterised by boiling water test with sample inserted into 
boiling water and measure the weight afterwards. However this was not performed yet in the 
scope of this thesis.

The data on density of green raw powder and sintered polycrystalline sample under different 

conditions are showed in Table 4.4. However, relative density is somehow difficult to get since 
the sintered product is a composite materials containing 3 or more phases of ceramics such as 
cordierite, mullite and corundum and other phases as shown in XRD study. The SEM study also 
proved that the bulk ceramics is not fully dense composite but a porous structure with ~10% 
volume porosity. Therefore, relative density seems to be more reliably obtainable from 
quantitative SEM image analysis associated to XRD phase analysis as demonstrated in section 
4.3.4. The graphic representation of the relative density variations under different sintering 
schedule is shown in Fig. 4.30 and it appeared 1250 oC is always more preferential to achieve 
higher relative density whilst longer sintering time also appeared to be beneficiary to increase the 
relative density at the same temperature. For instance, a relative density of ~98% is obtained for 
sample sintered at 1250 oC for 4h. This will be revisited with support of higher mechanical 
strength. However, SEM study of relative density as previously introduced is planned to verify 
the measurement by Pyconometry.

The cordierite has excellent thermal shock resistance largely due to its extremely low thermal 

linear expansion coefficient, which reduces the thermal stress generated during quenching or

flame heating with temperature changing rapidly up to ?T~500-1000 K. However, the sample in 
our investigation consists of cordierite, mullite, and ?-alumina as primary phases, as well as other 
minor phases such as ?-SiO2 and ?-Cristobalite. The thermal expansion and hence the thermal 
shock resistance will be very much dependent on the phase fraction of the aforementioned 
composite. 

 
4.4.1 Thermal Expansion  

The dilatometry studies were carried out to 4 specimens sintered at 1500, 1350, 1250, and 
1150 oC respectively for 2 h. within the temperature range from 50 oC to 1200 oC. The change in 
length versus temperature is shown in Fig. 4.31.

All the curves show some slope changes. For #1, #2 specimens the changes start at around 

600oC and end at around 750-800oC; while they appear shifted to higher temperatures, ~750 oC 
for #3, and 800 ºC for #4 specimens, respectively. Mirwald [12] studied the Mg-cordierite which 
is the same phase as studied in this work. He found two discontinuities in the thermal expansion 
at 275±25 °C and 600±50 °C, assumed to represent higher-order phase transitions [12]. The first 
slope change is related to a minimum in specific volume, implying unusual expansion behavior 
(negative thermal coefficient) at low temperatures. However, we did not find such first 
discontinuity as seen in Fig. 4.31. Nevertheless, an estimate of slope change at about 700-750° C 
for the #4 specimen sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h yields a negative TEC. Table 4.5 gives the 
summary of the measured experimentally and the calculated values of TEC for sample at each 
temperature for comparison purposes.

The investigations showed that, first of all, a coefficient of linear thermal expansion depends 

on the sintering temperature. Fig. 4.32 plots the TEC variation versus sintering temperature for 2 
h. It is found that the minimum TEC value, indicating optimized sintering schedule located at 
1350oC. This was somehow expected since cordierite fraction is the highest at 1350oC.  On the 
other hand, high TEC material of alumina reaches minimum at the same temperature. Although 
mullite fraction is higher at 1350oC but the effect of less corundum is more dominant. The effect 
of this compositional variation is reflected in reduction of TEC of the cordierite composite in Fig. 
4.33. The TEC of 3.31x10-6/K from the investigation is in some agreement with that reported by 
Kehzrabadi et al [115] of 3.18x10-6/K at the same firing temperature.

Further heating up to 1500 oC does not yield better TEC since the cordierite phase has 
completely transformed into mullite. It is possible that the TEC at 1350 oC is not the minimum 
one and Johnson et al [111] showed that the TEC of cordierite could go as low as 0.74x10-6/K at 
1420oC with more than 90% phase fraction of cordierite. This helps us to further explore the TEC 
variation versus temperature and heating time due the difference of starting materials 
composition.  

 
Giovanni Bruno et al [119] used Neutron powder diffraction to show that the variation of 

lattice parameters a, b, and c of cordierite were compared to the macroscopic thermal expansion. 
In this work the a, b axes show different thermal expansion at high temperature, but equivalent 
thermal expansion behaviour below 800oC. The TEC could be as low as 10-7 to 2.5x10-6, 
depending on MgO molar ratio [11]. The more MgO the higher content wt. % of cordierite and 
hence, the lower was the obtained TEC. This suggested us to try to add extra wt.% of MgO in the 
original raw mixture powder in order to deplete mullite phase at the same sintering temperature 
1250 oC or 1350 oC for higher wt.% of cordierite in the following-up work. Xu et al studied 
thermal expansion coefficient variation from mixture of rectorite, talc and alumina without 
additives. The mixture was similar to that used in this work and the TEC at 1350 oC was around 
3x10-6/K which is in good agreement to our result 3.2x10-6/K. The minimum TEC (~1.96x10-6/K) 
was found at 1270 oC [116] and then increase for higher sintering temperatures. In Fig. 4.32, the 
TEC for sample sintered at 1500 oC is higher than TEC of sintered at 1350 oC, thus exhibiting the 
expected trend discussed above [116].  

 
The reduction of TEC is one of most important factors for successful application. There are 

also some reports on lowering the TEC by acid/alkali treatment which reduced the TEC from one 
third to more than half. However, the phase composition of cordierite ceramics is often complex. 
For instance, from XRD analysis, cordierite ceramics sintered at 1350 oC and 1250 oC contain 
around 55-60 wt. % cordierite along with 15-20 wt. % mullite and ?-corundum. Therefore, the 
TEC is not only function of cordierite but also the combination of other two phases. Interestingly, 
the thermal properties are also tuneable with chemical treatment for instance, Bai et al [120] 
showed that a combination of acid and alkali treatment cordierite ceramics will not only reduce 
the TEC but also enabled maintaining the treatment effect after high temperature application.  
 

The cause for low thermal expansion is summarised by Roy et al in [14]. According to the 
authors, there is no a single cause for the very low thermal expansion. They identified at least four 
causes corresponding to different materials such as nano-porous materials i.e. cordierite; 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

silica-based glasses; ferromagnetic alloys and ferroelectric relaxors [14]. In our study, the cause 
for cordierite is due to the cordierite has many channels and holes in the structure and the thermal 
energy is able to be absorbed by the available holes in the structure [14].  
 
4.4.2 Thermal shock resistance (TSR) 

 
Test was carried out according to the ASTM standard C1525-04 [101]. The TSR 

measurements were conducted to measure the flexural strength retained after thermal shock at 
elevated temperature. At each soaking temperature, one batch of five samples was rapidly 
transferred from the furnace to water at Room Temperature (RT) in water tank. After the thermal 
equilibrium was reached for the sample in water bath, the samples were placed in an oven at 80 
oC for 24 h to constant mass due to likely water adsorption into the porous structure of sample 
upon quenching. The mean value of retained flexural strength from five samples per batch and 
standard deviation were calculated. 
 

The flexural strength at RT denoted ?f, Poisson ratio v, Young’s modulus E and linear 
thermal expansion coefficient were determined experimentally; therefore, we could predict the 
thermal shock resistance using equation (2.16). The ?Tc was determined to be 167 K. The sample 
was subject to flexural measurement and the retained strength was studied as function of 
temperature difference between soaking temperatures and RT as shown in Fig. 4.33.

Fig. 4.33: Thermal shock behaviour of bulk ceramics samples with different heat treatments 

 
Fig. 4.33 shows the thermal shock behaviour of bulk ceramics under different heat treatment 

schedules. Samples sintered at 1250 oC show relatively higher flexural strength compared to those 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

sintered at 1350 oC due to less porosity as discovered earlier. The sudden drop of retained flexural 
strength was found occurring in ?T range of 325-625 K. At ?T=325 K, no samples showed 
significant decrease of retained strength and a slight increase was even measured for samples 
sintered at 1350 oC for 4 h. This is supporting evidence that all samples under all schedules 
possessing TSR properties better than ?T=325 K. This result is in good agreement to previous 
studies conducted by Oliveira et al [15]. Nevertheless, the retained strength dropped to 1/3 or 1/4 
of original strength when the sample experienced ?T=475 K. This is indicative of significant 
crack growth within dense ceramic bodies. On the other hand, the suggestion to calculate TSR 
based on equation (2) showed TSR values ranging from 200-230 K, which are significantly lower 
than the experimental results. This was also explained in Oliveira’s work that porous structure of 
bulk ceramics with around 10% porosity act as energy sink when the crack growth takes place, 
adsorbing some energy and increasing the crack resistance and hence, the thermal shock induced 
stress concentration. It is also noteworthy that the retained flexural strength for samples sintered 
at 1350 oC for 2 h is the highest retained strength at ?T=475 K. This is rather expected 
expectation that the retained strength is higher due to the relative density of the sample or in 
another word the porosity is higher for 1350 oC for 2h compared to others with higher relative 
density. 
 
 For industry use, the ceramic foams experience considerable thermal stress under rapid 
temperature changes, such as in foundry industry when high temperature molten metal flows 
through the foam to remove non-metallic impurity particles, or the ceramic foam filters are 
subjected to cooling after metal filtering. Suppliers of some existing products available in the 
market made of Zirconia or alumina for metal casting do not provide the data on their thermal 
shock resistances. Nevertheless, ceramic foams made of cordierite have a good potential for 
thermal shock resistance applications. The TSR property was studied analytically by Gibson and 
Ashby [121] who proposed an approach to evaluate this property for a cellular structure based on 
strut's thermal shock resistance property. Then they derived the expression (4.1) for thermal shock 
behaviour of open-cell dense ceramic foams, denoted as Rb:

Rs is the thermal shock resistance of dense ceramic struts in the foam, ? is the apparent density of 
the foam and ?s is the density of ceramic struts. The equation has two empirical coefficients C2 
and C1, given by Gibson and Ashby for isotropic foam: C2=0.16, C1=0.5. For instance, ceramic 
foams sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h, considering ?Tc=475 K. Using the above parameters to 
calculate the thermal shock resistance of the 8 PPI ceramic foam gave Rb=366 K, suggesting that 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

this temperature difference is sufficient to generate thermal stress and cause damage by extending 
the cracks. The experimental validation of such TSR property of ceramic foams is under 
investigation. Fig. 4.34 also illustrates an example of calculated thermal shock resistance of 22 
PPI foam sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h (?Tc~400 K) based on model of Gibson and Ashby as 
function of relative density of foam according to (4.1). It is seen that thermal shock resistance 
decreases rapidly when the relative density increases. However, the fracture strength and Young’s 
modulus increase in opposite way. Therefore, the design of cordierite cellular material is a 
trade-off between the mechanical and thermal shock resistance properties.

4.5 Microstructural characterization of ceramics foam 
 
4.5.1 Cell cavity volume fraction  

 
The method used to study the volume fraction is very simple and straightforward. It is based 

on the assumption that the density of the cordierite strut of the foam is the same to bulk ceramics 
bulk while the density of the cell cavity (containing air = 0.0012g/cm3) is considered to be zero 
for simple calculation. Therefore, the fraction of the cell cavity is written in equation (4.2) below: 

1
dense dense cavity cavity foam foam dense dense

dense cavity foam

c c c c

c c c

? ? ? ?+ = ?

+ = =     (4.2) 

In equation (4.2), the density of the bulk ceramics denoted ?dense is measured by pcnometer for 
instance, the bulk ceramics sintered at 1350 oC for 2h has density of 2.347 g/cm3; while the 
density of the ceramics foam denoted ?foam is measured to be 0.403 g/cm3. Therefore, equation 
(4.1) gives the volume fraction of bulk ceramics according to (4.2) and Ccavity is determined to be 
approx 0.8283 for 8 PPI ceramics foam impregnated with suspension modified by 0.5 wt. % 
CMC. Similarly the cell cavity fraction of 22 PPI is also obtained to be 0.87 with (PS+IS)/PS 
ratio ~20 at 0.2 wt. % CMC modification. The cavity fraction was not studied for 22 PPI foam 
impregnated with 0.5 wt. % modified slurry since the foam was not successfully prepared. The 
study was not conducted towards 30 PPI foam since the microstructure of the polymer replica is 
not open-cell and actually useless in real application. Fig. 4.35 and Fig. 4.36 demonstrated 
selective study of the cell cavity for 22 PPI foam with 0.2 wt. % CMC at different (PS+IS)/PS 
ratio. It is noteworthy that the ceramics cellular structure has rather large discrepancy in cell 
cavity fraction in the same batch due to the processing control compared to technique of in-situ 
polymerization making of polyurethane foam. The latter is based on well defined chemical 
reaction and the cell cavity is homogeneous. In case of impregnation of ceramics slurry to 
polymer cellular structure, the impregnation is completely hand based. The ceramics slurry is not 
well controlled to be impregnated on the polymer with exact the same amount of slurry. 
Therefore Fig. 4.35 or Fig. 4.36 showed an example of controlling microstructure by ratio 
(PS+IS)/PS. It is considered as only qualitative mean to ceramics slurry processing. This problem 
has to be tackled by more advanced technique such as developed by Susana et al [122] with 
prototype of automated machine with multiple stage of pressing the foam to apply slurry weight 
control after initial impregnation.

4.5.2 Computed X-ray tomography study  

 
The instrument used in this investigation is an ultra high-resolution (&gt;2µm) CT system at 

Institute of National Applied Science (INSA) of University of Lyon II. The machine is 
manufactured by PHOENIX|X-RAY and the general outlook is show in Fig. 4.37. The X-ray source 
is very powerful up to 240 kV compared conventional X-ray diffraction around 7.8 kV in order to 
penetrate the sample in great depth to probe inside structure. The instrument is equipped with a 
powerful workstation with 64 GB memory and multiple processors for image capture, 
reconstruction of data and Image post-processing. The data is processed and stored in form of 
stack slices and ready to be analyzed by Image Analysis software such as ImageJ [123] and 
AMIRA [124].

In our work, we studied three ceramics foams with different microstructure scale. We give 

name to them as 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI which originate from their polymer replica structure. 
However this name does not mean that the ceramics foam may share the same microstructure as 
to their mother replica since the dip casting and sintering may significantly vary the 
microstructure depending on the processing conditions. Fig.4.38 (a)-(c) showed the slice images 
of microstructure for 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI ceramic foam respectively.

We notice that the ceramics strut is not fully dense, consisting in a hollow structure with 
pores across the bulk ceramics body. Big and triangular shaped pores are seen from all samples. 
The triangular shape pores are formed due to the burning-out of polymer replica during 
pre-sintering at 600 oC for 1 h. The polymer burning out is not associated with the fully densified 
ceramic strut but leaving a hollow structure. This is interesting since the polymer appear to escape 
from the ceramics suspension coated outside and the behaviour of burning out polymer seem not 
causing the ceramics strut to collapse at 600 oC for 1 h. It is also noticed that the hollow structure 
has shape of triangle.  
 

The 3D structure visualization is not possible for whole structure as scanned due to this 
computing power limitation. We compromise with cutting the scanned volume into smaller 
portion around 1/6 of its original size each. The 3D structures are illustrated in perspective view 
from stack of slices images as shown in Fig. 4.39 to 4.41 for 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI foams 
respectively.

The 3D structure for foams of different microstructure scale shows very distinct features in 
terms of porosity and cellular structures. 8 PPI foam appear to be completely open cell structure 
with pores interconnected with big windows and most struct materials are concentrated on edges. 
However, the microstructure of 22 PPI, in particular 30 PPI foam showed very poor open cell 
structure without interconnection. In addition to this, 22 PPI foam appears to be very bulky with 
some pores not only closed but completely filled. 30 PPI foam appeared to be uniformly coated 
with ceramic slurry and the materials are distributed not only on edges but also on cell walls. The 
structure of closed cell is not desirable for ceramics filter or catalyst applications. The reason of 
seeing good open cell structure for the 8 PPI foam and closed cell or bulky foam with 22 PPI and 
30 PPI foam are two-fold. First of all, the rheological properties are critical for the impregnation 
of polymer foam with the slurry. When slurry viscosity was too low, the slurry could not stay on 
the surface and settled to the bottom. However, when viscosity was too high the slurry not only 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

covered the surface of the polymer struts but also blocked the windows between pores and the 
cell became closed structure or completely filled. The 3D structure of the ceramics foam of 22 
PPI showed that the rheological properties of suspension with 0.5 wt. % CMC were suitable to 
impregnate the 8 PPI foam but very poor for impregnating the 22 PPI foam. The aforementioned 
8 PPI foam was selected and further treated in AMIRA software to render smaller scale 3D 
structure in Fig. 4.42 for generating grids to perform FEA calculation in order to study the 
mechanical properties as illustrated in Fig. 4.43.

It is worthy noting that although the grid generation was successful, the memory required for 
calculation was out of range of the current computing resources after testing. Therefore, the 
calculation was actually done for a structure even smaller than that shown in Fig. 4.43. However, 
a request is being made to some collaborator in order to perform such calculation using a higher 
spec PC. 
 
4.6 Mechanical characterization 
 
4.6.1 Impulse Excitation  

 
The measurement of dynamic modulus was carried out at National Laboratory of Energy and 

Geology (LNEG). The equipment is called Resonant Frequency&amp;amp; Damping Analyser (RFDA) 
and the manufacturer is IMCE (Belgium). The measurement follows ASTM standard (ASTM 
E1876) and the sample is prepared with large aspect ratio to simplify the calculation of Young’s 
modulus according to ASTM E1876. A precaution should be given in measuring small length due 
to the screw calibre in the equipment could not locate the node at 0.224 L from the ends if the 
length of sample is less than 32 mm. The typical setup of IE experiment for bulk ceramics and 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

foam are shown in Fig. 4.44 and Fig. 4.45 respectively.

The RFDA is also provided with software which read and analyzes the input sound signal 

from the tapping. The signal’s waveform is shown on the screen and the Fourier transform is 
performed simultaneously. The calculation of Young’s modulus is carried out at the same time 
and displayed on the screen. It should be mentioned that the software also allow analysis of Shear 
modulus by applying torsion tapping force from which the Poisson ratio is possible to be 
determined experimentally with relationship between Young’s modulus and shear modulus. The 
result of Young’s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson ratio for the bulk 
cordierite-mullite-alumina system and foam are listed in Table 4.7.

destructive and the Young’s modulus has also been studied by compression method at the similar 
conditions sintered at 1350 oC for 4 h. And the modulus shows much lower value of ~500 MPa 
[125]. The modulus measured by IE technique is around 1.08 GPa is twice higher than bulk 
ceramics. This exotic result of disagreement is not surprised since the difficulty in machining the 
ceramics specimen with an even flat surface and the machine pressing plate has also flatness 
problem. The likely reason for this is discussed that static compression could hardly avoid the 
problem of brittleness of the ceramics specimen that the sample will crack first before elastically 
deformed.  

 
4.6.2 Flexural strength  
     

 The flexural strengths of ceramics composite of cordierite and other phases are measured 
with three point bending method. Due to structural defect and cavity in ceramics sample, at least 
5 specimens from the same batch conditions were tested as shown in Table 4.9. Due to the 
specimens were prepared via Slip casting route. The specimens have different dimensions due to 
hand grinding of green body. After the sintering, the sintered ceramics were checked and it was 
discovered that the sintered ceramics do not have good parallelism of surface. Therefore further 
grinding and polishing are necessary to improve the uniformity of the sample size. The mean 
value from 5 measurements are taken average and compared to other samples.  

 
The ceramics specimens prepared at variable temperature and time were also tested by 

flexural strength measurement. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4.46. First of all, we note that the 
specimen at 1500 oC, the sample of monolithic mullite does not show highest flexural strength as 
indicated by Table 1.1. It is because of the large cavity present in the body due to liquid phase 
formation. On the other hand, the ceramics decreases in flexural strength as the sintering 
temperature decreases. The sample prepared at lower temperature (1250 oC) showed higher 
strength around 100-120 MPa. From this trend, we proposed that the optimal sintering 
temperature is 1250 oC without pores or crack. This is somehow proved in relative density 
measurement for bulk ceramics that sample sintered at 1250 oC has highest relative density of 
96-98%. Meanwhile, the longer sintering time appeared to affect the mechanical properties.

4.6.3 Compression strength of bulk 

 
The Compression strength is also an important property of the ceramic cellular structure used 

in refractory application. The property is measured by compression and the speed of cross head is 
0.2 mm/min. Since the elastic regime of the ceramics foam is very small compared to metal or 
polymer and the compressed surface generally present a significant roughness. Therefore a layer 
of softer material called compliance layer made of rubber between the cross head and ceramics 
foam upper surface must be used to the rough surface of the ceramics foam in order to apply force 
in more evenly manner. The layers of polymer compliance are applied at both the bottom surface 
and upper surface.  
 

The strength of cellular structure of cordierite is studied first of all for the slip cast green 
body which is an indication of the strength for handling and cutting of the green body shape. The 
stress-strain curve is presented in Fig. 4.47. The green body shows a linear deformation with 
multiple yield events due to crack occurrences. However, the first yield event was due to 
falling-off piece from green body and the second yield event was related to the crack occurred 
across the body and hence the Compression strength is determined until the second crack 
appeared. After the appearance of the second crack, the specimen was still in place but 
completely cracked. Therefore, the Compression strength is defined where the first crack showed 
up at ~0.15 strain as 4.17 MPa.

Fig. 4.48: Elastic property of bulk ceramics 
under compression

 
The study of Compression strength is important for dense and cellular ceramic samples. 

However, the Compression strength of bulk ceramics is not presented due to lack of experimental 
bench that operate with adequate compressive force. Fig. 4.48 shows an example of compression 
measurement in which the stress-strain curve shows behaviour of multi-crack events with low 
Young’s modulus compared to those from IE measurement. These facts demonstrate that 
compression measurement of dense sample could cause significant error and risk to damage the 
load cell with maximum force (10,000N) with big force applied (~80% of maximum force), 
therefore the measurements for bulk ceramics was abandoned.  
 
4.6.4 Effective modulus and strength of foam  

 
The stress-strain curves are presented in Fig. 4.49 and the linear portion of deformation is 

used for Young’s modulus. It is noteworthy that the foam has extremely low modulus compared 
to IE measurement. The results regarding the Young’s modulus from compression tests are totally 
untrustworthy. The Compression strength was determined for a point at which the foam 
disintegrated with a sudden structural failure as illustrated in Fig. 4.50 and Fig. 4.51. Because of 
the problem encountered in validating the effective modulus by compression tests, therefore, the 
reliability of Compression strength is in doubt and subject to further analysis by modelling. Also 
in Fig. 4.49, the relative density of each ceramics foam are varied a lot from one to another due to 
impregnation was carried out at different conditions such as concentration of CMC polymer. The 
microstructure of 22 PPI and 30 PPI impregnated with highly viscous slurry was almost closed 
cell whilst 8 PPI was homogeneous open cell structure. Therefore the modulus was seen increased 
from 8 PPI to 30 PPI. Likewise, the compression strength was also increased with decreasing pore 
size of microstructure.

 The abovementioned results suggested that characterising ceramic foam materials 
under compression is very difficult due to its surface roughness and brittleness. The IE 
technique could effectively solve the problem of Young’s modulus, but does no enable to 
measure the strength of foam. In addition, the compliant layer made of rubber is completely 
destroyed since the fractured ceramics are very hard with sharp corners. Due to brittleness of 
ceramics, the structural failure was too sudden to be accurately detected by the cross head 
force sensor. The cross head continues to compress with increasing force and can hit the 
bottom plate and damage the machine. As consequence, further Compression strength 
measurements were suspended.  

 
4.7 Dielectric properties  

 
The dielectric properties were measured with LCR (Inductance-Capacity-Resistance) 

meter from 1000 Hz to 1 MHz. The experimental apparatus includes a ceramics tube (alumina) 
as show in Fig. 4.52 and the sample with the upper and lower surfaces partially coated with a 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

gold layer as electrodes, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.53, was placed in the middle of the tube.  

            
Fig. 4.52: Setup of dielectric measurement Fig. 4.53: disk with Au electrode, ?=5.6 mm

 
The measurement of dielectric properties was performed at room temperature for 6 

samples of different sintering schedules and also at elevated temperature up to 600oC for a 
sample selected on the basis of maximum flexural strength. No previous literature has ever 
reported on the effect of temperature on dielectric properties of cordierite ceramics and the 
ceramics have to work at elevated temperature environments. Therefore, it is desirable to 
study the dependence of dielectric constant on temperature variations. In this regard, sample 
batch with optimum mechanical strength was chosen (1250 oC, 2 h) to test while the others are 
under investigation and will not be reported in the thesis. 

 
The measurement of dielectric properties are based on measurement of capacitance of the 

ceramics capacitor deposited with Au electrode on the both surfaces. The area of the 
capacitance is the area of the deposited Au electrode and the thickness of the dielectric 
material is the thickness of the ceramics capacitor as given in the Table 4.8 below.

Where the thickness d was taken into account in equation (4.3) and the capacitance C in 
measured in pF by LCR, r is the radius of Au electrode of 5.6 mm, ?0 is dielectric permittivity 
of vacuum (8.85x10-12 F/m). Therefore the relative dielectric constant of ceramics is calculated. 
On the other hand, the dielectric loss factor is obtained from the ratio of the imaginary part of 
complex resistance ?’’ to the real part ?’=?r. The loss factor is expressed by the following 
equation: 

'' 'tan /? ? ?=  (4.4) 
Where ?’’ is obtained from ?’’=?RC, and the ? is the measuring frequency from 1000 Hz 

to 1 MHz. The dielectric loss factor is an important measure of quality to the sample and 
electrode. Typically, tan? &amp;lt;0.02 is considered very good for application. 

 
Fig. 4.54 shows the dielectric constant as function of the frequency from 1000 Hz to 1 

MHz at room temperature. The minimum dielectric constant of ceramics is around 6 at 1 MHz. 
The result shows that the dielectric constant is slightly larger than monolithic phase of 
cordierite and equal to that of monolithic phase of mullite in Table 1.1.

Fig. 4.55: sintering time dependent 

dielectric constant at 1 MHz 

 
The dielectric constant appeared to be constant over the whole range of frequency for all 

samples. This suggests that the no induced weakening or disappearance of ionic polarization 
takes place due to increase frequency [11]. The dielectric constants for all samples at 1 MHz 
are plotted in Fig. 4.55 and the values are in agreement with previous results [11, 126]. 
However, there are significant differences of dielectric constant between the samples prepared 
under different conditions. The dielectric constant shows not only sintering temperature 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

dependence but also sintering time dependence in a rather systematic way. With increasing 
sintering time at 1350 oC, the dielectric constant at 1 MHz decreases from 8.5 to 6.0; however, 
the sample sintering at 1250 oC for various times shows a non linear behaviour. The dielectric 
constant starts from 8.5 and increases to around 11 and then decreases again to around 9 as 
function of sintering time. The complexity of dielectric properties for ceramics materials has 
been addressed and is dependent on many factor such as content of crystalline phase, glass 
phase, porosity and so on [127]. The larger dielectric constant is supposed to be due to larger 
value of mullite phase and alumina phase which will increase the composite dielectric constant 
based on wt. % fraction of ingredient phases from XRD. On the other hand, the SEM studies 
revealed approx 10% porosity in the 1350oC for 2 h specimen which should reduce the 
dielectric constant. However, our observation shows opposite trend to dielectric constant than 
prediction.  
 

The dielectric loss tangent is the imaginary part of complex number and the real part is 
dielectric constant as we see previously. The imaginary part is called loss factor and 
represented by loss tangent (ratio between loss factors to dielectric constant). The loss tangent 
is an important parameter since the electric energy will be dissipated into heat and this has 
implication of how much the materials will convert the EM to heat. Since the loss tangent is 
also a parameter to evaluate the microwave-materials coupling capability. The bigger loss 
tangent the better material-microwave coupling capability is, and vice versa. Fig. 4.56 
illustrates the variation of dielectric loss factor for all samples over 1000 and 1 MHz range. 
The curves demonstrate that the dielectric loss is relative small and consistent with literatures. 
The lowest dielectric loss is well below 0.02 for samples sintered at 1250 oC for 8 h followed 
by 1250 oC for 2 h. In the meantime, the dielectric loss at 1 MHz showed systematic behaviour 
the dielectric losses from samples sintered at 1350 oC are all higher than those prepared at 
1250 oC; Fig. 4.57 is dedicated to illustrate the variation of dielectric loss of all samples at 1 
MHz. It appears that the longer sintering time tends to decrease dielectric loss factor at given 
temperature. Therefore, the lowest dielectric loss factor is also seen from the sample sintered 
at 1250 oC for 8 h at 1 MHz.

The temperature dependent dielectric constant is shown in Fig. 4.58 from 1000 Hz to 1 

MHz between RT and 600oC. The measurement was very time consuming and took 24 h to be 
accomplished with small temperature steps. Therefore, we selected the sample sintered at 1250 
oC for 2 h to study. The measurement showed a clear trend of decreasing dielectric constant 
with increasing frequency at high temperature range while no significant differences could be 
observed for all frequencies approximately below 200 oC. It is also noticed that the lower 
frequency the steeper is the increase of dielectric constant above 200oC. On the other side, the 
dielectric constant at RF range of 1 MHz showed a flat dielectric constant around 10 across the 
temperature from RT to 600oC. The sharp increase of dielectric constant for 1000 Hz to 1 
MHz is followed by a radical drop at around 600oC. In order to determine more precisely the 
temperature of Curie point, a close lookup of temperature dependent dielectric constant 
between 520 oC to 600 oC is illustrated in Fig. 4.59, indicating that all the dielectric constant 
drops radically at 590 oC.

As previous mentioned, that the ceramics capacitor will experience such as aging after 
long time use due to decrease of dielectric constants. The most common approach to restore 
the ceramics capacitor or de-aging to increase the dielectric constant is based on the heat 
treatment above the Curie temperature. However, we discovered the opposite trend in 
composite ceramics of cordierite. The dielectric constant of sample sintered at 1250 oC, 2 h 
showed dramatic decrease at 590 oC. Further check was made after experiment with 
multimeter and the cause was identified as the Au electrode has been completely evaporated 
above 590 oC. This is rather surprisingly to us since it may imply that the dielectric constant is 
constant over large temperature change until the electrode material is failed. The reason of 
such property in case of low dielectric material is extremely interesting however yet 
undiscovered. More careful investigation is under way to confirm the effectiveness of heat 
treatment on reducing the dielectric constant and effect on other properties such as mechanical 
and so on to validate its application in real industry. 

 
The following Fig. 4.60 shows the dielectric loss of the sample sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h 

as a function of temperature. It is apparent that the ceramics has stable dielectric loss 
resistance at 1 MHz over a wide range of temperature from RT to 600oC. The dielectric loss 
has strong dispersion behaviour below 1 MHz. However, as previously discussed, for good 
electronic application the dielectric loss factor has to be smaller than 0.02 and the sample 
demonstrated dielectric loss factor not more than 0.05 until 400 oC which promises very good 
temperature stability.

The dielectric properties are closely linked to the microstructure. For instance, porous 

structure is favoured since air has lowest ?~1.00005 and the presence of pores could decrease 
the ? lower than 2. However, the porous structure is also responsible for the low mechanical 
strength. There has been few cases of commercial grade Cordierite ceramics that has 
application in electric isolator material and marketed in the by CeramTec North America, 
USA. Table 4.9 list the company’s product versus the cordierite composite ceramics obtained 
in this study. It is interesting to find out that the sample from our work has comparable 
dielectric properties and even superior properties.

satisfying all abovementioned conditions. Composite cordierite prepared from this 
non-standard composition has shown many technical aspects to match some of the 
requirements in terms of thermal stability, shock resistance, low-?, low dielectric loss at RT 
and higher temperature as well as high modulus and mechanical strength and therefore 
become a potential candidate to future IC industry.

Chapter 5: FEA modeling of cellular ceramics 
 

Micromechanical theory of heterogeneous materials has been developed to address the 
mechanical property of one material embedded in another. The theory was originally 
developed by Eshelby [129] who gave the expression of tensor depending on Poisson ratio of 
the embedded phase regardless of dimension in case of spherical inclusion of embedded 
particles or objects. The Eshelby theory was further developed by Mori and Tanaka who use 
Eshelby tensor to calculate the effective stiffness of heterogeneous material. Eshelby tensor 
was constructed as a Fourth-order tensor relating average inclusion’s strain to average matrix 
strain and could also be modified with inclusion’s orientation in case of non-random 
distribution [130]. MT method was found very successful in simulating elastic property of 
open-cell Polyurethane foam with carbon nanotubes reinforcement under effective dispersing 
conditions in [33]. However, no literature has been ever found using MT method to ceramic 
foams. Therefore, the MT micromechanical model for cellular materials and its application to 
the ceramic foams is discussed in this chapter. The modelling result was compared the 
experiment results and a poor agreement was found unfortunately. In addition, a new 
technique was used to simulate the mechanical behaviour by Finite Element Analysis based on 
actual 3D structure from X-ray tomography. The advantages and drawbacks from each 
approach will be discussed and reviewed. 
 
5.1 Problems’ Review  

According to Christensen [131], General Self Consistent Model (GSCM) with assumption 
of spherical cavity in a cellular material gives the most physically realistic results when the 
cavity volume fraction approaches 1. The effective Young's modulus is given in [131]:

Where Eeff denotes as effective modulus of the cellular material and Em, vm are the modulus 
and Poisson ratio of strut material. In all calculations shown later on, subscripts 1 and 2 refer 
to strut material and the cell cavity respectively. Therefore c1 and c2 are the struts and cell 
cavity fractions, respectively. Here, the cell cavity fraction used in modelling is obtained from 
density method as introduced in Chapter 4. 
 

The Poisson ratio and bulk’s Young’s modulus are v=0.267 and Em=99 GPa for instance 
when sample is sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h from Impulse Excitation experiments. The effective 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Young’s modulus for ceramics foam from (5.1) was calculated by taking into account of the 
foam’s cavity fraction for 8 PPI and 22 PPI as shown in Table 5.1. 
 

Table 5.1: effective Young’s modulus from Christensen model 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The Eeff is compared to Impulse Excitation (IE) measurement. The results from IE 

experiment are around 1 GPa and 5 times or 4 times lower respectively for 8 PPI and 22 PPI 
foams than those predicted by Christensen model. This study indicates a lack of exact match 
for Young modulus. However, surprisingly good results were obtained, since such a simple 
calculation could predict the effective mechanical properties for cellular ceramics. 
Nevertheless, we also noticed a trend that when cavity fraction approaches 1, the agreement 
between the calculated effective modulus and experimental modulus is improved which is 
consistent to the suggestion made by Christensen. 
 
5.2 Modeling with Mori-Tanaka Approach  

 
In order to examine the modelling ability of other method, the modelling was carried out 

with approach developed by Mori &amp;amp; Tanaka in 1970’s [132] and re-developed in 1980’s [133]. 
This method gives the general expression of effective stiffness of two heterogeneous materials 
with stiffness tensor C1ijkl and C2ijkl, the two materials occupy a volume fraction of c1 and c2 
respectively. Before the emergence of X-ray tomography and finite element analysis based on 
actual 3D structure, MT method was the most effective approach to study mechanical property 
of composite material with great success.  

 
One of the advantages of micromechanical method is to consider the material properties 

without request empirical parameters from experiments prior to the calculation. The general 
expression of effective stiffness tensor of composite materials consisting of two homogeneous 
phase 1 and 2 is shown below [130]:

Where Imnkl is the identity tensor, the contents of 4th order identity tensor is given by 

Kronecker’s symbol [130]. When dealing with cellular structure materials, the simple 
approach is to equate stiffness tensor C2ijpq in (5.2) to zero since phase 2 now is treated as cell 

cavity. Also the term in (5.2) [ ] 1mnkl mnkl mnklT I S

Therefore a modified expression of effective stiffness tensor of cellular materials with cavity

And then taking into account material property parameters, for instance E=99 GPa and 
v=0.267 for bulk ceramics sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h, therefore we can determine the stiffness 
matrix of ceramics foam with cavity shown in (5.6). Then substituting the cell volume fraction 
found previously into (5.3), for instance, C2=0.8283, therefore we have effective stiffness as

From above discussion, the effective stiffness tensor is ready to be calculated only if we 
know the tensor contents of Spqmn in equation (5.3). The Spqmn is known as “Eshelby tensor” 
which is a function of the bulk ceramics properties as well as shape of the embedded inclusion. 
In this investigation the embedded materials are cell cavity and considered to be sphere. The 
mechanical properties with cellular structure of foam has also to be based on assumption that 
the ceramics strut is fully dense without crack and the mechanical strength is uniform across 
the whole body struts. However Computed X-ray studies revealed that this is not the case and 
the ceramics struts present a triangular hollow structure which is not be able to quantify by any 
optical or physical method since its closed structure. Nevertheless, under such assumption the 
corresponding components of Eshelby tensor for ceramic foam with spherical cavity is found 
by Schjødt-Thomsen et al [130]. First of all, Eshelby tensor in general form is shown in (5.10) 
[129].

 However, the form in (5.11) can be considerably simplified with only components S1111, 
S1122, S1212  since all other non-zero components can be related to S1111, S1122, S1212 assuming 
the material of ceramics struts has isotropic mechanical properties. The non-zero components 
in Eshelby tensors are introduced by Mura [134]:

The vm is the Poisson ratio for the base materials (composite ceramics). Taking into account 
the general form of Eshelby tensor given by Schjødt-Thomsen [130], one can therefore 
calculate the components of Eshelby tensor from (5.12), and substitute into equation (5.3) in 
order to perform calculation, taking into account of volume fraction of cavity in ceramics 
foam of 8PPI c2=0.8283 and hence c1=0.1386, then (5.2) becomes:

? ?= ? ? ? ? + ?? ?        (5.13) 

Where Tstpq=(Istpq-Sstpq)-1, therefore the effective stiffness tensor of ceramics foam of 8 PPI is 
obtained. The Young’s modulus of ceramics foam can be obtained from (5.9). The modulus is 
calculated to be 8.991 GPa. Similarly, the same procedures applied to obtain effective 
modulus of 22 PPI foam with cavity fraction of 0.87 sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h gave the value 
of 6.86 GPa. 
 
 Unfortunately, the modelling with MT method also shows poor agreement with 
experiment. This is somehow beyond our expectation prior to the simulation as MT method 
has proved its effectiveness in many cases that is superior to other models. The likely source 
of this discrepancy is attributed to hollow structure of ceramics struts instead of being dense 
struts as illustrated in Fig. 4.37. The hollow structures are demonstrated by CT. The hollow 
structure was left due to burning-out of polymer replica could considerably decrease the 
mechanical properties of cellular structure. Moreover, the struts with hollow structure are not 
considered in micromechanical approach with assumption that the inclusion has to be 
spherical. In addition to this, lack of knowledge of distribution of the cell size and 
approximation of cavity could also affect the result which is yet to be studied. In one word, 
MT method predicting stiffer properties of ceramic foams compared to Christensen model is 
likely to match the experiment when the struts ceramics are completely dense instead of being 
hollow. We want to stress the aforementioned study does not suggest Christensen model is 
superior to MT method. For instance, when cell cavity approach to 0, meaning the material 
becomes completely dense, hence, the simulation should give properties of dense material. In 
case of Christensen model, the Young’s modulus is 34 GPa. Instead, MT model gives 99 GPa 
when the C2 is 0. This proves the numerical effectiveness of MT method in simulating of all 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

scenarios. Hence, the internal crack and defect are considered as main source of error. 
 
5.3 Tomography based Finite Element Analysis 

 
The Finite Element Analysis is carried out based on the 3D structure from X-ray 

tomography. However, a calculation for large structure such as seen in Fig. 4.38 or Fig. 4.41 
requires more elements in calculation which is usually very difficult to carry out on personal 
computer. Therefore we chose a relative small structure but showing the same porosity~82% 
to the ceramics foam of larger scale. The structure in Fig. 5.1 is cut from the larger 3D 
structure of original scanned volume in AMIRA software.  

 
Fig. 5.1: 3D reconstructed structure of 8 PPI ceramics foam by Tomography 

 
In actual FEA simulation, the displacement instead of force was applied to the top surface 

of the structure in Fig. 5.1. The volume is set free to expand except the bottom surface is fixed 
with zero displacement for compression condition. The materials parameters such as Young’s 
modulus and Poisson ratio are adopted from the IE measurement in Chapter 4. When the 
cellular structure is compressed downward, the stress will produced at the cell edges. The 
stress is simulated for 0.7% strain and the reaction force is calculated as resultant force from 
displacement.  
 

Oliveira et al [82] studied the modulus of the cordierite bulk ceramics and demonstrated 
E=88±10 GPa. The measurement was performed using the same technique. However, the 

modulus was found to be 99±2 GPa in case of 1350 oC of 2 h. This was not surprising since 
bulk ceramics are not monolithic but a composite containing ~20 wt.% mullite with higher 
modulus of 150 GPa. The composite also has ~10% porosity, therefore the composite modulus 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   

 101

should fall in between cordierite modulus E=70 GPa to Mullite E=150 GPa. In the meantime, 
the Poisson ratio is measured experimentally v=0.267. One more assumption is also made that 
the bulk cordierite is isotropic materials in terms of mechanical properties and does not exhibit 
orientational properties. Therefore the modulus and Poisson ratio are taken as materials 
properties parameter to calculate the reaction force on the structure. 
 

It is well known that ceramics are very hard but brittle; therefore, it is not easy to machine 
the ceramic foams with a perfect flat surface. Some alternative approach is used by inserting 
soft polymer or rubber compliance layer between the compression plate and the top surface of 
the ceramics foam. However, we did not follow this approach successfully and the ceramics 
still crack very suddenly before it can be firmly touched and compressed. Meanwhile, the 
fractured piece of ceramics is extremely hard and tears off the polymer or rubber compliance. 
In order to study Compression strength the stress at displacement when ceramics structure 
with more than 50% structure fractures, we performed this study in FEM simulation. We 
compared to flexural strength of to the batch of ceramics which is sintered and supposedly has 
the fracture strength, ?f=92 MPa to strut of ceramic foams. This strut is supposed to break and 
hence removed in simulation when the stress of strut exceeds ?f. The elastic deformation has 
to end and further compression could only break the ceramics structure.  

 
It should be noted that stress values used in this calculation to evaluate the ceramics 

fracture behaviour is based on Von Mises (VM) stress. In materials science and engineering 
the Von Mises stress is formulated in terms of the principal stress:

?1, ?2, ?3 are principal stress components which are defined elsewhere [135] for further 
interests. The significant of the VM stress lies with fact that it is used as typical criterion in 
predicting of yield point under multi-axial complex loading conditions using results at which 
point the simple uniaxial stress (principal) results [98]. The VM stress represents the 
maximum surface stress generated at specific location. The fracture criterion is beyond scope 
of this study and therefore we only use the VM stress to predict the material fracture behaviour 
when the VM stress exceeds the flexural strength measured experimentally. 
 

The FEM simulation is carried out in a continuous step from zero displacement until the 
flexural strength has been exceeded certain % that created disconnection of the structure. 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

Table 5.1 shows the steps we used in the FEM simulation for the structure of 8 PPI foam in 
Fig. 5.1. Considering the variation of the compressive properties is only linear within elastic 
regime, only 3 steps are chosen to obtain linear property. 

 
Table 5.2: list of steps in FEM calculation

Fig. 5.2 (a) shows the contour plot of the VM stress and the scale of stress in terms of 

colour at right top corner. We can see that the highest stress concentrated at thinnest cell edges 
and somewhere close to the cell edges. The contour plot is calibrated with 68 MPa as 
threshold therefore the more reddish in structure the higher the Von Mises stress. However, 
under such small strain only small portion of the structure has exceeded the flexural strength 
and supposed to fracture as shown in Fig. 5.2 (b) by removing those elements with VM stress 
higher than 68 MPa. The 68 MPa was obtained from flexural strength measurement of bulk 
ceramics prepared from the same batch of slurry for the struct of foam obtained. In Fig. 5.2 (b), 
we conclude that the fracture of few cell edges will not likely make the whole structure fail 
completely.

Fig. 5.3(a) shows the VM stress distribution under higher strain. Now the portion with 

stress that has exceeded the flexural strength is much more than that in Fig. 5.2(a). Similarly 
we also illustrate the fracture pattern in which the elements more than flexural strength is 
removed. However, as one can see in Fig. 5.3(b), although the portion which is likely to fail 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

has increased but the main structure still remain intact and we will expect some fluctuation of 
the compression force in experiment due to structure that fails. This expectation is in 
agreement with the typical static compression measurement of ceramics foam.  
 

          
Fig. 5.3(a): Mises stress under strain 0.0014; Fig. 5.3(b): fracture pattern under strain 0.0014 
 

In Fig. 5.4 (a) and Fig. 5.4 (b) we show the VM stress distribution and fracture pattern 
with a larger displacement and strain at 0.0071. Now the portion with stress more than flexural 
strength has dramatically increased and the fracture pattern shows that more than 50 vol.% of 
structure has completely failed and the structure is unlikely to keep stable and hence the foam 
is expected to fail catastrophically.  
 

          
Fig. 5.4(a): stress at 0.007 strains;          Fig. 5.4(b): fracture pattern at strain 0.007 
 

Fig. 5.4 also demonstrates that in order to have elastic deformation before the structure 
fractures, one must apply at least much less than 0.007 strain to the sample in case of perfect 
specimen geometry conditions. In our compression test, the sample has height of 5 mm, 
therefore the deformation of the sample within the elastic regime will be less than 3.5 µm. 
This is not easy, or is even impossible, since the sample surface has roughness which is much 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

more than 3.5 µm. In addition, the machine has typical step of 1~2 µm ramp and if the elastic 
region is not more than 3.5 µm for our sample, the compression stress-strain curve will have 
too few points to study the modulus.  
 

The reaction force corresponding to the displacement along unidirectional Z axis is 
calculated for each step as seen in Table 5.3. The apparent stress on the foam during 
compression is then obtained as well as Young’s modulus. In addition to this, the porosity is 
also determined by 3D image analysis and the cavity fraction is determined for the section of 
volume in Fig. 5.1 is around 0.8456. This porosity study is necessary to ensure that the 
structure studied in FEM analysis is as consistent as possible to that in reality due reduced 
structure.

From Table 5.3, the Young’s modulus of elastic deformation is determined as 1.729 GPa. 

The experimental value of Young’s modulus from IE measurement is 0.97 GPa. The 
agreement improves significantly compared to analytical model in previous section. The 
reason we found such agreement is due to the fact only tomography could render 3D actual 
structure including all structural defects, e.g hollow structure of the struts or irregularities in 
the modelling. In addition to the Young’s modulus, the compressive strength at which the 
ceramics foam will break is also investigated by FEA method which is not available in any 
other methods of analytical model. From Fig. 5.3 and Fig. 5.4, we discovered that the ceramics 
cellular structure completely failed at 0.007 strains and this is indication that the compressive 
strength must be below the stress applied at strain of 0.007. The stress was calculated by FEA 
at such strain as 2.47 MPa. The result from compression study in Chapter 5 suggested that the 
compressive strength of 8 PPI foam was 0.078 MPa. It is speculated that although the 
agreement between FEA result and experiment was large, however, the main error should 
come from the compression test due to irregularity of the sample dimension. The compressive 
strength should increase in case of perfect machining of the compressed surface. Therefore 
FEA study provided an potential mean to evaluate the compressive strength of the cellular 
structure, which is otherwise unpredictable in particular in case of brittle material.  



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

In abovementioned case, the FEA modelling was only applied to the case of 8 PPI foam 

due to the model is only available for this case. We have not conducted yet FEA modelling to 
foams of 22 PPI produced with different processing specifications. However, the study 
demonstrated best agreement up to date and effectiveness of CT-FEA modelling and further 
collaboration with X-ray tomography lab is being sought. 
 
5.4 Conclusive marks and future works 

 
Bulk ceramics and ceramics foam made of cordierite and mullite as well as corundum or 

quartz are produced and characterized with compositional, microstructural and 
thermo-mechanical properties. Bulk ceramics showed a Young’s modulus around 96-99 GPa 
and flexural strength at room temperature between 90-120 MPa. The composition of starting 
materials was revealed by XRD containing talc, corundum, quartz, feldspar and kaolinite as 
primary phase. The sintered product at variable temperature by XRD show maximum relative 
wt.% of cordierite at 1250 oC and further increasing the temperature for the same time of heat 
treatment is not effective in increasing the cordierite phase perhaps due to the Mg-containing 
compounds has depleted. The temperature XRD study also reveals that the formation of 
cordierite only takes place above 1250 ºC until the cordierite melt at 1460 oC. Sample sintered 
at 1425 oC showed dual phase of cordierite and mullite. The mechanical, thermal and 
dielectric properties are supposed to be optimized; however, an investigation is under way to 
verify this. 

 
Mullite is found continuously increasing from the batch of raw powder upon heated from 

950 oC. Above 1350 oC up to 1425 oC the cordierite wt.% fraction does not further increase 
when temperature rises due to Mg-deficiency however the SiO2-Al2O3 continue to form 
mullite wit increasing wt.% and will transform to mullite completely at 1500 oC while 
cordierite has melt around 1460 oC. However the mullite specimen is macro-porous with 
visible crack and pores. This is due to liquid phase formation when cordierite melts and leave 
bubble entrapped inside the body after sintering. The mechanical strength was decreased 
significantly despite mullite has superior mechanical properties over cordierite in terms of 
bulk ceramics. 

 
From the same batch of raw materials, it is found that not only sintering temperature but 

also the lasting time of sintering play critical role. For instance, at 1150 oC the powder sintered 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   

 106

for 2 h showed no sign of cordierite, but the same batch sintered for 4 h showed formation of 
cordierite low temperature polymorph, indialite. At 1350 oC, the batch sintered for 2 h showed 
only cordierite and XRD revealed that when the powder was sintered for 8 h, the 
transformation took place from cordierite to some spinel. However, the composition variation 
effect to mechanical or physical properties has not been investigated yet. But it is unlikely to 
affect the mechanical properties in a significant way as much as sintering temperature. 

 
The thermal expansion studies suggest that 1350 oC is the optimal temperature in current 

investigation to give lowest TEC from the batch of original materials. However, further 
studies should be carried out between 1350 oC up to cordierite melting point 1460 oC. Also the 
time of heat treatment effect on the thermal properties should be also examined to support to 
invalidate the XRD result with variable time. It is expected that longer heat treatment will 
benefit the cordierite formation and depleted higher TEC materials such as Alumina.  

 
SEM studies suggest that the porosity of bulk ceramics is around 10%. This result is 

compared to relative density by Pyconometry measurement and XRD composition study 
which determine the phase volume fractions of each constituents and hence the density of 
composite ceramics. The agreement was found well. The composite showed a TEC which is 
different from that of each ingredient materials, therefore the volume fraction of each 
ingredient is also used to model the TEC. Experiments pointed out that the ceramics bulk 
sintered at 1350oC for 2h has good agreement with around 10% of porosity.  

 
The lower TEC ensures very good thermal shock resistance (TSR) properties due to less 

thermal strain and hence stress generated in rapid heating or cooling. The cordierite composite 
with variable composition of mullite and alumina and SiO2 are characterized by water quench 
method in line with ASTM standard. The experimental TSR is much higher than prediction 
and this is likely due to the porosity which acts as energy sink when the structure thermally 
expands. Further work is expected to perform in using FEA with thermal properties to 
simulate the thermal stress during rapid cooling to establish the scenario of thermal shock test. 

 
Cordierite ceramics are potential materials in low-k and low current leakage applications 

in the IC industry. Therefore, dielectric properties measurement was carried out. The dielectric 
constant was found low within wide frequency range and around 7 at 1 MHz. The dielectric 
loss factor appears to be low as well. Therefore, the high modulus, relative high strength and 
good thermal shock resistance cordierite composite ceramics with abovementioned dielectric 



EMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010

properties is promising for electronic packaging industry.   
 

Mori-Tanaka method was applied first to model the experiment for ceramics foam with 
averaging the cell morphology. Since the pores embedded in bulk ceramics are not considered 
equivalent to a sphere. Nevertheless, the effective modulus property is evaluated under 
assumption of spherical inclusion. The modelling shows a rough agreement. In the meantime, 
the modelling is based on 3D actual structure from CT experiment. This is supported with the 
fact that the strut of cellular structure is hollow which is different from other cellular materials 
that fully dense strut was found. The 3D actual structure was subject to FEA modelling in 
Abaqus/CAE and the best agreement between modelling and experiment is found for samples 
with 8 PPI pore size. This was an expected result since only CT rendered structure could take 
fully account of the defect and crack which affect the overall property of mechanical response. 
This CT-FEA modelling proves its usefulness in modelling material micromechanical 
behaviour under complex loading. Upon a full search of web of science, to the best our 
knowledge there is no such method or research has ever been conducted to ceramics foam yet. 
On the other hand, ceramics foam has become more and more popular product in today’s 
academics and commercial market required urgent and more advanced characterization. 

 
The future work is recommended in the following categories: 
1) Improve the homogeneity of the foam by using suspension with smaller particle 

mean size and distribution. The suspension’s viscosity should be further optimized 
with thickening agent and weight ratio between impregnated suspensions to 
polymer struts should be more closely controlled. Therefore, the shrinkage and 
deformation during drying and sintering could be reduced to minimum.  

2) Extra efforts should be made to consider adding sintering additives to increase the 
densification, perhaps P2O5 or excessive MgO in order to obtain single phase of 
cordierite at lower temperature. From Rietveld refinement it appears that 
Mg-containing oxides have been depleted while corundum is still abundant. This is 
perhaps why the mullite is formed instead of cordierite between 1250-1350 oC. 
Work should be done with variable wt.% MgO or P2O5 added to the starting 
powder to see if the sintering temperature and cordierite fraction can be optimized 
and the properties-compositional relationship should be revisited. 

3) The dielectric measurement is performed and the result was assuring its potential 
application. The dielectric constant show very low constant (7-10) depending on 
sintering schedule. Bearing that in mind the cordierite ceramics are supposed to be

used as low-dielectric loss materials. Therefore, further work should be also 
considered to increase the fraction of cordierite in the composite. In the meantime, 
the ceramic components could work at elevated temperature environment. The 
temperature-dependent dielectric properties of one representative samples were 
also characterized and analyzed. Study suggests the cordierite ceramics prepared 
from this non-standard powder has comparable or superior properties than 
commercial grade product and therefore continued efforts should be given.  

4) The brittleness of bulk and cellular ceramics is one of most main disadvantages to 
limit the application of cordierite especially ceramics foam made of cordierite. 
CNTs are considered unlikely in oxygen-based ceramics for reinforcing agent due 
to thermal instability during sintering. However, a few works have shown a 
possibility of using Spark Plasma Sintering in reduced atmosphere to incorporate 
CNTs in alumina. Hence it is interesting to apply this technique in cordierite. 
Continuing efforts in searching technique to disperse and sintering cordierite with 
CNTs should be supported with encouragement of some researches that 
demonstrated successful reinforcement of mullite with CNTs reinforcement should 
be given attention in this regard. 

5) A series of ceramic cellular materials made of e.g. ZrO, Alumina, SiC are 
developed for metal casting and catalyst converters. However, the cost of 
producing and applying such ceramic foams is high. The study above showed that 
cordierite-mullite composite has no advantageous properties compared to those 
ceramics aforementioned, i.e. the composite has flexural strength from 90~120 
MPa whilst SiC has flexural strength of 500-1080 MPa. The Compression strength 
of cordierite foam is around 1-2 MPa and flexural strength of ceramics foam made 
of composite cordierite in this investigation while the SiC foam demonstrated 
Compression strength of 8-50 MPa and flexural strength of 3-30 MPa. However 
low cost of cordierite ceramics is attractive and therefore efforts should be 
continued to find the most optimized route. In addition, the material is supposed to 
be applied in thermo-mechanical engineering. The mechanical behaviour of 
cordierite at high temperature is expected to be visited.  

6) Finally, FEM modelling should be considered by taking into account of thermal 
expansion coefficient which enables thermo-mechanical modelling of stress 
generated during quenching experiment. The modelling could be used to compare 
the experiment to simulate the defect dependent thermal shock resistance 
properties.
