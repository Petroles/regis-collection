ABSTRACT – (Anatomy, ultrastructure and secretion of Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda (Malvaceae) extrafl oral nectary). 
This paper reports on the extrafl oral nectary (EFN) of Hibiscus pernambucensis, a native shrub species occurring in mangrove 
and restinga along Brazil’s coastline. EFNs occur as furrows with a protuberant border on the abaxial surface veins of the leaf 
blade. Each nectary consists of numerous secretory multicellular trichomes, epidermal cells in palisade-like arrangements and 
non-vascularized parenchyma tissue. Nectar secretion is prolonged, since secretion starts in very young leaves and remains up to 
completely expanded leaves. Reduced sugars, lipids, and proteins were histochemically detected in all the nectary cells; phenolic 
substances were detected in the vacuoles of the epidermal palisade cells and in some secretory trichome cells. The secretory 
cells that constitute the body of trichomes have large nuclei, dense cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria, dictyosomes, 
scattered lipid droplets and plastids with different inclusions: protein, lipid droplets or starch grains; vacuoles with different 
sizes have membranous material, phenolic and lipophilic substances. The palisade cells show thick periclinal walls, reduced 
cytoplasm with voluminous lipid drops and developed vacuoles. The nectary parenchyma cells contain abundant plasmodesmata 
and cytoplasm with scattered lipid droplets, mitochondria, plastids with starch grains and endoplasmic reticulum. Mucilage 
idioblasts are common in the inner nectary parenchyma. Protoderm and ground meristem participate in the formation of 
EFN. Our data indicate that all nectary regions are involved in nectar production and secretion, constituting a functional unit. 
Longevity of the extrafl oral nectaries is likely associated with the presence of mucilage idioblasts, which increases the capacity 
of the nectary parenchyma to store water.

Key words - anatomy, extrafl oral nectary, Hibiscus pernambucensis, histochemistry, ultrastructure 

RESUMO – (Anatomia, ultra-estrutura e secreção do nectário extrafl oral de Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda (Malvaceae)). 
Este trabalho descreve o nectário extrafl oral (NEF) de Hibiscus pernambucensis, uma espécie nativa encontrada ao longo 
do litoral brasileiro, vegetando áreas de manguezal e restinga. NEFs ocorrem como sulcos profundos com bordo saliente 
sobre as nervuras na face abaxial da lâmina foliar. Cada nectário consiste de numerosos tricomas secretores multicelulares, 
células epidérmicas dispostas em paliçada e parênquima não vascularizado. Açúcares redutores, lipídeos e proteínas foram 
histoquimicamente detectados em todas as células do nectário. Compostos fenólicos ocorrem nos vacúolos das células 
epidérmicas e na porção bisseriada dos tricomas secretores. As células que formam o corpo dos tricomas secretores apresentam 
núcleo volumoso, citoplasma denso com muitas mitocôndrias, dictiossomos, gotas lipídicas esparsas e plastídios com diferentes 
tipos de inclusões: proteínas, gotas de óleo ou grãos de amido; os vacúolos possuem diferentes tamanhos e podem apresentar 
material membranoso, substâncias lipofílicas e fenólicas. As células em paliçada mostram paredes periclinais espessas, 
citoplasma reduzido com gotas lipídicas conspícuas e vacuoma desenvolvido As células do parênquima caracterizam-se por 
apresentar muitos plasmodesmos e citoplasma abundante com gotas lipídicas dispersas, mitocôndrias, plastídios repletos 
de grãos de amido e retículo endoplasmático. Idioblastos de mucilagem são comuns na região mais interna do parênquima 
nectarífero. A protoderme e o meristema fundamental participam na formação do nectário extrafl oral. Os dados mostram que 
todas as regiões do nectário estão envolvidas na produção e secreção do néctar, constituindo assim, uma unidade funcional. 
A presença de idioblastos de mucilagem no parênquima nectarífero aumenta a capacidade de retenção de água neste tecido e, 
provavelmente, colabora na longevidade do nectário.

Introduction

Extrafl oral nectaries (EFNs) are plant-secretory 
glands most commonly linked to defensive mutualisms 
(Doak et al. 2007). From the anatomical point of view 
EFNs vary widely in ontogeny, morphology, and 
structure. Sometimes the morphological characteristics 
of nectaries, as for example the volume of nectariferous 
tissue seem to be correlated with the quantity of the 



490 J. F. Rocha &amp;amp; S. R. Machado: Extrafl oral nectary of Hibiscus pernambucensis 

nectar secreted but not its quality (see Nepi 2007). The 
diversity in nectary shape and location is taxonomically 
valuable in addition to their ecological role in plant-
insect interactions (Bentley 1977, Bentley &amp;amp; Elias 1983, 
Koptur 1992, Rudgers &amp;amp; Gardener 2004, Wäckers &amp;amp; 
Bonifay 2004, Díaz-Castelazo et al. 2005; Doak et al. 
2007). 

In Malvaceae, EFNs occur in the form of furrows, 
chambers or depressions coated with multicellular 
secretory trichomes (Sawidis et al. 1987a, b, 1989, 
Sawidis 1991, 1998, Vogel 2000, Rocha et al. 2002). 
Despite the representativeness of Malvaceae in tropical 
ecosystems, the secretory structure and activity of EFNs 
have been investigated in only a few members of this 
family, involving some species of the Abutilon (Findlay 
&amp;amp; Mercer 1971a, b, Reed et al. 1971, Gunning &amp;amp; Hughes 
1976), Gossypium (Tyler 1908, Reed 1917, Wergin et al. 
1975, Eleftheriou &amp;amp; Hall 1983) and Hibiscus, especially 
H. rosa-sinensis L. (Santos 1959, Sawidis et al. 1987a, 
b, 1989, Sawidis 1991, 1998). Indeed, for some time, 
the greater part of anatomical and ultrastructural studies 
on Malvaceae EFNs reports on the secretory trichomes 
or subglandular tissue, as separate components of the 
nectary.

Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda, known popularly 
as guaxima-do-mangue, algodão-do-brejo and embira-
do-mangue, is a native shrub commonly occurring along 
Brazil’s coastline in mangroves and restinga (coastal 
sandy plains vegetation) (Pio Corrêa 1984, Lorenzi 
1992). This species has an economic potential as a source 
of textile and cellulose fi bers for the manufacture of 
paper, as well as of mucilage with the same medicinal 
applications as those of other mallows, in addition to 
its lightweight wood utilized in the fabrication of small 
objects, toys and boxes for packaging (Pio Corrêa 
1984). It is an ornamental species and indicated for 
planting in degraded areas (Lorenzi 1992). Moreover, 
H. pernambucensis plays an important role in the 
regeneration of mangroves, providing favorable 
conditions for the reestablishment of species typical of 
this habitat (Araújo &amp;amp; Maciel 1979).

The purpose of this work was to study the extrafl oral 
nectary of H. pernambucensis, especially regarding the 
anatomy, ultrastructure, ontogeny and histochemistry, 
and to relate these to secretion mechanisms.

Material and methods 

Hibiscus pernambucensis plants occurring in natural 
communities along the restinga of Sahy Beach in the 
municipality of Mangaratiba, state of Rio de Janeiro, were 

selected for observation and periodic collection of samples 
during 2003-2004. Plant voucher specimens were deposited in 
BOTU Herbarium of the Departamento de Botânica, Instituto 
de Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in 
Botucatu municipality, São Paulo state, Brazil. The insects on 
the EFNs were collected and identifi ed on the Departamento 
de Entomologia of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de 
Janeiro (UFRRJ).

Anatomical studies – To characterize the anatomical 
structure and analyze the development of the extrafl oral 
nectaries, samples of vegetative apices and basal region of 
leaf blade in different development phases were fi xed in 
FAA (formaldehyde, acetic acid, ethanol 70%, 1:1:18v/v) 
(Johansen 1940), dehydrated in an ethyl series, embedded 
in Leica® plastic resin according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations, and sliced in a rotating microtome. The 
sections (6-8 ?m) were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue 
in acetate buffer, pH 4.3 (O’Brien et al. 1964) and mounted 
between slides and coverslips using synthetic resin (Gerlach 
1969). 

Histochemical tests – Sections of nectaries in the secretory 
stage, occurring in freshly collected completely expanded 
leaves, were obtained with a Ranvier microtome and treated 
with Sudan IV to detect lipids (Johansen 1940); with 10% 
ferric chloride to detect phenolic compounds (Johansen 
1940); 0.02% ruthenium red to detect pectic substances 
(Jensen 1962); Fehling reagent for reducing sugars (Purvis 
et al. 1964); aniline blue black for proteins (Fisher 1968); and 
Lugol reagent for starch grains (Johansen 1940). In all these 
tests, a control was conducted simultaneously following the 
authors recommendations. The sections were mounted with 
glycerin between slides and coverslips.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) – Samples were 
fi xed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer 
solution at pH 7.3, for 12-18 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in an ethyl 
alcohol series, critical point dried with CO2 as the transition 
liquid (Robards 1978), mounted with a double adhesive tape 
on stubs, and sputter coated with gold. The samples were 
observed at 20 kV using a Philips SEM 515.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) – Samples of 
nectaries in the secretory stage, occurring in completely 
expanded leaves, were fi xed as described above, post-fi xed in 
1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h, dehydrated 
in acetonic series and embedded in Araldite resin. Ultrathin 
sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate (Watson 1958) 
and lead citrate (Reynolds 1963), and observed at 60 kV 
using a TEM Philips, CM 100.

Results 

Distribution, morphology and secretion of EFNs – The 
extrafl oral nectaries (EFNs) of Hibiscus pernambucensis 
occur on the abaxial surface of the leaf blade located 



 Revista Brasil. Bot., V.32, n.3, p.489-498, jul.-set. 2009 491

on the basal portion of the median vein, but they can 
also occur on the lateral veins (fi gure 1). Within each 
individual leaf, nectaries have a similar morphology, but 
the one located on the median vein is more developed. 
They consist of a furrow with raised glabrous-surfaced 
edges (fi gure 2) which widens toward the inside of the 
vein, forming a chamber containing numerous secretory 
trichomes (fi gure 3). Nonglandular trichomes cover the 
abaxial surface of the leaf blade except in the region of 
the nectary (fi gure 2). 

Nectaries at the secretory stage present a tumescent 
border and are visible on very young leaves with 
c. 0.5-1 cm in length. The secretion is abundant and 
has a hyaline aspect, fi lling the inside of the chamber 
and sometimes spilling over the edges. The EFNs are 
constantly foraged by various insects, among which ants 
of the genera Camponotus and Solenopsis and bees of 
the genus Trigona are the most common. On senescent 
leaves, the nectary is inactive and insects are absent.

Anatomy and ontogeny of EFNs – Anatomically, the 
nectary consists of three regions (fi gure 3): 1) edge 
of the furrow, a single-layered epidermis constituted 
of column-shaped cells covered by a thick cuticle; 2) 
multicellular trichomes lodged at the bottom of the furrow 
or nectariferous chamber; 3) a large region formed by 
parenchyma, non-vascularized tissue. The tall epidermal 
cells of the nectary edge present conspicuous pores in 
the anticlinal walls (fi gure 4). The nectary parenchyma 
is differentiated in two zones: one, located beneath 
epidermis layer, constituted by tangentially fl attened cells 
compactly arranged (fi gures 3, 5), and an inner region, 
constituted by several layers of larger parenchyma cells 
and characterized by the presence of large idioblasts 
with mucilage.

The nectary located on the median vein initiates 
as a furrow covered by protoderm, constituted by 
homogeneous size cells with a voluminous nucleus, 
dense cytoplasm and little developed vacuome (fi gure 
6). The protodermal cells lining the bottom of the furrow 
show a marked elongation allied to an increase of the 
nucleus volume, which in this phase characteristically 
occupies a central position in the cell (fi gure 7). These 
cells divide in a periclinal direction, each one originating 
a basal cell and an apical cell. The basal cell remains 
inserted in the epidermis, constituting the basal cell of 
the trichome. The apical cell divides periclinally, and 
its derivatives divide successively in the transversal 
plane forming a series of up to 10 cells; after this series 
is formed, the cells of the intermediary portion divide 
anticlinally, originating a biseriate portion, while the

stalk and the cell of the apical region remains uniseriate. 
Secretory trichomes in different stages of development 
occur side by side in the same nectary (fi gures 8, 9). 
Cells of the ground meristem divide at different planes 
(fi gure 7), originating the nectary parenchyma.

Ultrastructure of EFNs – The ultrastructure of the EFNs 
is showed in the fi gures 10-20. TEM analysis showed 
electron-dense bands (probably pectic substances), 
extending from the internal surface of the outer periclinal 
cell wall toward the cuticle, but not penetrating it (fi gure 
16). Each epidermal cell tipically contains a voluminous 

nucleous (fi gure 4) and a large vacuole traversed by 
cytoplasmic strands (fi gure 16). Voluminous oil droplets 
(fi gures 15, 16) occur in the cytoplasmic strands. 
Occasionaly, very small plastids with osmiophilic 
inclusions (fi gure 15) are seen in the outer cytoplasm.

The secretory trichomes are clavate (fi gures 5, 10) 
and constituted by a basal cell, a short stalk which has 
two or three tabular cells, and a body constituted by a 
biseriate portion with two to six strata of voluminous 
square cells and a conical apical cell. In the stalk 
cells the protoplast remais compressed between the 
tangential cell walls (fi gures 10, 11); however, small 
spaces between the plasmalemma and cell wall (fi gures 
10, 13 – arrowhead) are observed at several points in 
the body and apical cells. The stalk cells have thick 
lateral walls (fi gures 10, 11), which are electron-opaque 
due to the impregnation of lipids, while the transversal 
cells are thinner, strongly electron-dense (fi gures 10-12) 
and traversed by plasmodesmata. A thin cuticle remains 
attached on the tangential walls of the stalk cells (fi gures 
10, 11), but cuticle covering the body and apical cells 
forms swellings origining small subcuticular spaces 
(fi gure 10). A spherical or more irregular nucleous, 
mitochondria with prominent cristae, plastids with oil 
droplets or cuneiform protein inclusions, voluminous 
oil droplets and various small vacuoles are common 
in the stalk cell located near the basal cell (fi gure 12). 
The stalk cell located in the vicinity of the body cells 
shows distinct characteristics, as prominent nucleus and 
two large vacuoles (fi gure 10). The cells constituing the 
body of the secretory trichomes are characterized by 
voluminous nucleus and a dense-staining cytoplasm with 
abundant ribosomes, many dictyosomes with adjacent 
vesicles, mitochondria with well developed cristae 
and plastids with different inclusions (fi gures 13, 14). 
Prominent plastids contained electron-dense matrix, very 
few thylakoids and a single starch grain (fi gure 13), 
and plastids with cuneiform proteins, with or without 
starch grains (fi gure 14) are commonly observed. Rough 
endoplasmic reticulum (fi gure 13) and multilamellar 
body (fi gure 14) were occasionally present. The vacuoles 
contain a fl occulent material or a strongly electron-dense 
content (fi gure 10), probably phenolic substances as 
detected in histological sections. 

Parenchyma cells located below epidermal layer 
tipically have irregularly thickened walls with very 
small spaces between them, conspicuous nucleus with 
variable size and shape, abundant cytoplasm and a large 
vacuole or many small vacuoles (fi gure 17) fi lled with a 
fl occulent material. Mitochondria, plastids with abundant 
starch grains and smooth endoplasmic reticulum are

Histochemical tests – The active nectaries on completely 
expanded leaves reacted positively to reducing sugars, 
lipids, pectic substances, proteins and phenolic 
compounds (table 1). Reducing sugars were detected 
in all the cells of the secretory trichomes and parenchyma 
tissue. Proteins were detected in the cells of the glandular 
trichomes, nectary parenchyma and in the palisade-
like epidermal cells. Oil droplets were detected in the 
palisade-like epidermal cells, secretory trichomes and 
parenchyma tissue. Lipidic substances were also detected 
in the lateral walls of the stalk cells of the secretory 
trichomes. Pectic substances were more abundant in the 
outer periclinal wall of the palisade-like cells. Phenolic 
compounds were detected in the palisade cells and in 
the biseriate portion of the secretory trichomes, but were 
absent in the parenchyma cells.

Discussion

The extrafl oral nectaries (EFNs) on the leaves of 
Hibiscus pernambucensis are “hollow-type nectaries”, 
according to Zimmermann’s classifi cation (1932). These 
nectaries are characterized by the presence of numerous 
multicellular, linear secretory trichomes lodged at the 
bottom of the furrow and represent a marked characteristic 
of the order Malvales (Arbo 1972, 1973, Wergin et al. 
1975, Kronestedt et al. 1986, Sawidis et al. 1987a, b). 

Our observations showed that the protoderm and 
ground meristem participate in the formation of EFNs in 
H. pernambucensis, with an ontogenetic pattern similar 
to that documented for different species of Malvales 
(Arbo 1972, Sawidis et al. 1987a).

In H. pernambucensis, the extrafl oral nectaries begin 
to secrete nectar from very young to totally expanded 
leaves, with the secretion end coinciding with the 

beginning of senescence. This observation differs from 
most of the reports (Paiva &amp;amp; Machado 2006), which 
describe active extrafl oral nectaries only on young leaves, 
and inactive nectaries on completely expanded leaves. 
The constant presence of Camponotus ants visiting the 
extrafl oral nectaries of young and totally expanded 
leaves of H. pernambucensis plants was also reported 
by Cogni &amp;amp; Freitas (2002), who found that these ants are 
aggressive and attack termites. Arbo (1972) considered 
that the extrafl oral nectaries of Byttneria, a genus of 
Sterculiaceae, which, together with Malvaceae, comprise 
the order Malvales, constitute a source of food that attracts 
ants. It is remarkable that the EFNs of H. pernambucensis 
produce abundant lipids and, as described for other 
species (Roth 1968, Durkee et al. 1981, Machado 1999), 
these substances may be part of the exudate acting as a 
food source, especially for ants.

In active nectaries, lipid droplets, reduced sugars, 
proteins bodies and phenolic compounds were detected 
by histochemistry. The EFNs of H. pernambucensis are 
devoid of their own vascularization and the reducing 
sugars and water components of the nectar possibly are 
provided by the phloem sap of the vein into which the 
EFN is inserted, as already described for Gossypium 
species (Wergin et al. 1975) and for Hibiscus tiliaceus 
L. (Rocha et al. 2002). Alternatively, in some species, 
nectar sugars are produced in the own nectary cells by 
photosynthesis, whereupon starch grains remains in the 
plastids for a short period only (Paiva &amp;amp; Machado 2008). 
Phenolic compounds in the EFNs of H. pernambucensis 
may be associated with protection against biotic 
(herbivores and microbes) and abiotic (protection against 
UV-B radiation) stresses, which are functions related to 
the chemical structure of their components (Hutzler et 
al. 1998). Proteins bodies in mature EFNs have been

2006, 2008). Plastids, especially amyloplasts, play an 
important role in the production of nectar, with the starch 
totally or partially hydrolyzed during the manifestations 
of secretory activity. Numerous mitochondria in the 
nectariferous cells are possibly related to the process 
of starch grains hydrolysis, since these organelles 
are essential to the metabolic processes involving the 
consumption of energy. Endoplasmic reticulum is one of 
the principal components of nectariferous cells and plays 
a major role in the translocation of sugars, as well as 
being the site for lipid synthesis; dictyosomes are related 
to production of hydrophilic components of secretions 
(Fahn 1979, 2000; Nepi 2007).

The cytological characteristics of the H. 
pernambucensis nectary parenchyma including many 
mitochondria, extensive endoplasmic reticulum, the 
presence of vesicles and numerous plasmodesmata 
suggest the participation of this region of the nectary 
in the process of unloading of sugars originated from 
the phloem, as well as in the cell-to-cell transport of the 
nectar precursors. This mechanism of transport favors 
the enrichment of the pre-nectar, which is transported 
via plasmodesmata to the secretory trichomes (Wergin 
et al. 1975, Gunning &amp;amp; Hughes 1976, Durkee 1983, 
Eleftheriou &amp;amp; Hall 1983, Kronestedt et al. 1986, Sawidis 
et al. 1987a, b, 1989, Fahn 2000, Sawidis 1991, 1998). 
The considerable development of the endoplasmic 
reticulum in the parenchyma cells of H. pernambucensis 
is matching with the EFNs of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis 
(Sawidis et al. 1989, Sawidis 1991) and, according to 
these authors, this is the principal cellular component 
involved in the transport of the pre-nectar. 

As described in other species of Malvaceae (Sawidis 
et al. 1987a, Sawidis 1991), in H. pernambucensis, after 
entering the trichomes, pre-nectar fl ows from cell to 
cell via plasmodesmata reaching the apical cell; the 
apoplastic route is impeded by a strong cutinization of 
the lateral walls of the trichome stalk cells. In addition, 
presence of a very elaborate system of membranes as 

plasmodesmata, endoplasmic reticulum, dictyosomes and 
vesicles are evidences of the symplastic route for nectar 
transportation. Final modifi cation of the nectar occurs 
within the trichome cells and, in H. pernambucensis, 
well-developed dictyosomes and endoplasmic reticulum 
are involved in this process. Presence of vesicles in the 
outer cytoplasm and images suggesting vesicle fusions 
with the plasmallema are evidence of granulocrine 
secretion, and seem to be the cause of the sinuosity 
observed in this membrane (Machado et al. 2006). In 
H. pernambucensis it is likely that the nectar is then 
secreted into the small periplasmic spaces which are 
commonly observed in the trichome body and apical 
cells. After, having crossed the outer tangential wall 
the nectar accumulates beneath the cuticle. Absence of 
cuticle rupture may indicate that the cuticle is permeable 
to nectar, as has pointed for a number of other species 
(Stpiczynska et al. 2005).

It is likely that the release of the secretion to the 
surface of H. pernambucensis extrafl oral nectary occurs 
also through microchannels; these are seen as wide 
electron-dense bands of a pectic nature in the outer 
periclinal wall of the palisade-like epidermal cells. 
Microchannels emerging as fi brillar outgrowths of the 
outer epidermal cell wall were reported in Abutilon sp. by 
Kronestedt et al. (1986). In H. pernambucensis, the wall 
pectin bands can act as hydrophilic fi ller, increasing the 
porosity of the wall to macromolecules (Taiz &amp;amp; Zeiger 
1998), thus constituting an apoplastic exit route of the 
nectar to the nectary surface.

The presence of idioblasts with mucilage in the inner 
parenchyma region of H. pernambucensis nectary, due to 
its hydrophilic properties, helps maintain the relatively 
water potential of nectary tissues (Sawidis 1998). As 
a consequence, increases the capacity of the nectaries 
to store water and this in turn improves its longevity. 
A remarkable feature of the extrafl oral nectary of H. 
pernambucensis is that the nectar secretion period is 
prolonged, since secretion starts in very young leaves 
and remains up to completely expanded leaves. Similar 
data were reported on fl oral nectaries of Orchidaceae 
species (Stpiczynska et al. 2005).

In summary, the extrafl oral nectary of H. 
pernambucensis has a number of common characteristics 
to other Malvaceae species. This study indicates that 
epidermal cells that constitute the border of the nectary 
furrow are involved in nectar production and secretion, 
besides the secretory trichomes and the subglandular 
parenchyma tissue. Although relevant fi eld data are 
not available, the prolonged nectar secretion suggests 
that extrafl oral nectaries in this species constitute an

effi cient protection for the aerial biomass by maintaining 
a permanent colony of aggressive ants. Nevertheless, a 
long-term study is necessary to evaluate the role of the 
EFNs in the H. pernambucensis-ant interactions and the 
factors that infl uence and determine this nectar secretion 
pattern.
