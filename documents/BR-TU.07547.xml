resumo	Em consequência de uma série de problemas ambientais, económicos e políticos relacionados com o uso de combustíveis convencionais, vários países estão agora a focar as suas atenções em combustíveis alternativos. O biodiesel está na linha da frente das alternativas ao petróleo no sector dos transportes, sendo considerado uma opção a curto prazo visto que o seu preço é competitivo e não são necessárias mudanças nos motores para implementar o seu uso. De entres os possíveis processos de produzir biodiesel, a reacção de transesterificação com catálise básica é o método preferido. Depois da reacção são sempre necessários processos de purificação de modo ao biodiesel produzido cumprir os standards definidos para os combustíveis alternativos, reduzindo problemas de motor e consequentemente aumentando a sua aceitação por parte dos consumidores. De entre as especificações encontram-se o conteúdo em água, em álcool e em glicerol. Ser-se capaz de descrever correctamente o equilíbrio de fases de sistemas que são de interesse para os processos de purificação de biodieseis numa gama alargada de condições termodinâmicas é uma condição necessária para uma correcta simulação do processo industrial, de modo a se atingir uma elevada produtividade a baixos custos de operação. O uso de moléculas oxigenadas como combustíveis representa uma alteração significativa em termos da termodinâmica de soluções. Para combustíveis baseados em petróleo as equações de estado cúbicas e os modelos clássicos de coeficientes de actividade mostraram ser apropriados, no entanto para combustíveis novos como o biodiesel, sendo mais complexos do ponto de vista das interacções intermoleculares com formação de dipolos e pontes de hidrogénio, são necessários modelos termodinâmicos mais complexos para descrever essas interacções. Neste trabalho a CPA EoS (Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State) será desenvolvida de modo a permitir uma descrição adequada dos equilíbrios líquido-vapor e líquido-líquido para uma serie de sistemas binários e multicomponentes contendo água, ácidos gordos, ésteres de ácidos gordos, glicerol e álcoois.

abstract	As a consequence of a range of environmental, economical and political problems related to the use of conventional petroleum based fuels, several countries are now focusing their attention on alternative fuels. Biodiesel is at the forefront of the alternatives to petroleum based fuels in the transportation sector, being considered an important short-time option since its price can be competitive with conventional diesel and no motor changes are required. Among the various approaches to produce biodiesel, basic catalyzed transesterification is the preferable method. After the transesterification reaction purification steps are always necessary in order to provide the fuel with the quality levels required by the standards for alternative fuels, reducing engine problems and consequently increasing consumers’ acceptance. Among the specifying minimums are the water, the alcohol and the glycerol contents. Being able to correctly describe the phase equilibria of systems of interest for the biodiesel purification processes in a broad range of thermodynamic conditions is a necessary condition for a correct simulation of the industrial process, in order to achieve high productivity and low operating costs. The use of oxygenated molecules as fuels represents a significant change in terms of solution thermodynamics. While for petroleum-based fuels, cubic equations of state and classic activity coefficient models have proved to be appropriate, new fuels, such as biodiesel, are more complex from the point of view of intermolecular interactions with dipoles and hydrogen bonding being important on these systems. To be able to represent such interactions more complex engineering thermodynamics models are required. In this work the CPA EoS (Cubic - Plus - Association Equation of State) will be developed to provide an adequate description of the vapor-liquid and liquidliquid phase equilibria of several binary and multicomponent systems containing water, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, glycerol and alcohols.

General Context
After a century where petroleum has dominated as the preferred energy source and as raw material for the production of organic chemicals, the continuous depletion of oil reservoirs, its increasing extraction cost, the emergence of new economies where oil demand is increasing exponentially, the unstable politic situation in oil producing countries and natural disasters in producing areas are forcing the oil consumer countries to redefine their energy strategies. In Europe, where oil demand largely exceeds domestic production, the search for new oil substitutes is already in the agenda of both the European Commission and the member state governments [1-3].
Environmental concerns are also limiting petroleum based fuels consumption. We have been witnessing an intensification of air pollution and global warming problems due to the emissions of greenhouse gases and other air contaminants [4], that result from the combustion of fossil fuels.
As a result of all these issues, studies are nowadays being focused on reliable alternatives to conventional diesels [5]. Biodiesel, a blend of fatty acid alkyl esters, is now seen as a promising and sustainable short-term substitute fuel. As a result, in the past few years, the biodiesel industry emerged as an alternative for providing renewable fuel for transportation, residential heating, industry and agriculture [6].
Biodiesel, made from vegetal oils or animal fats, has a renewable nature and a lower contribution to global warming due to its almost-closed carbon cycle. Analysis have shown that, with the use of biodiesel, CO2 emissions can decrease up to 78 % [7], allowing, among other things, the reduction of air pollution related morbidity and mortality.
Biodiesel can also reduce countries’ dependency on foreign petroleum from highly politically instable regions, as biodiesel is available throughout the world [8], and can also provide a new market for fats and oil consumption [7]. It also has a more favorable combustion profile, and offers no significant storage or transport problems, being used pure or blended in unmodified diesel engines [9]. Nowadays biodiesel is the most used biofuel for road transportation in Europe [10].
The most adopted industrial process to produce biodiesel is transesterification that consists in the reaction of a fat or oil (triglycerides) with an alcohol to produce fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and a by-product, glycerol (Figure 1) [9]. Waste cooking oils can also be used for biodiesel production, reducing the related production costs and problems concerning the disposal of waste cooking oils that can cause environmental water contamination [11-12].
Figure 1. Overall scheme of the triglycerides transesterification.
Methanol is the preferred alcohol due to its low cost and physical and chemical advantages in the process [9]. Nevertheless, ethanol can prevail in regions where it is less expensive than methanol, due to its easier production and accessibility [6], and higher chain alcohols have as well been suggested [13-14]. An excess of alcohol is necessary in order to displace the transesterification reaction towards product creation [9].
A catalyst is required to improve reaction speed and yield. The most used catalysts on this process are sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide and potassium hydroxide [15]. The basic catalyzed reaction is fast and requires only mild conditions. However, several purification processes are further necessary in order to supply the fuel with the adequate quality requirements, what may increase the biodiesel production cost if the optimal operation conditions are not applied [15].
Research studies focused on other types of catalysis, such as acid catalysis have been carried out but so far, the damage caused to the equipment due to the harsh operation conditions and the large reaction time needed do not balance the high yield provided by the acid catalysis [15].
Enzymatic catalysis is also an alternative option but it is not industrially favored due to the expensive costs of enzymes [17].
Recently, some work has been addressing the near/supercritical synthesis of biodiesel, with no need of catalysts, which can successfully overcome a number of problems of the conventional basic catalysis process. The purification steps are reduced and the reaction time is shorter with higher yields, even with low quality raw materials. All those advantages may compensate the high pressure and temperature conditions required in supercritical fluid processes [18-19].
In order to be commercialized as biodiesel the produced fatty acid alkyl esters have to fulfill the quality standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) [20]. CEN specified minimum requirements and test methods for biodiesel to be used in diesel engines and for heating purposes, in order to increase the biodiesel quality and its acceptance among consumers (Table 1). Therefore, the purification steps that follow the transesterification reaction are extremely important to provide a fuel with the quality levels required by the standards for alternative fuels [21].

The maximum admissible free glycerol content according to the European Standard EN 14214 is 0.02 wt % [20]. Glycerol has several negative impacts on fuel properties but profits from selling this product into the commercial glycerol market reduce biodiesel production costs in 22-36 %, increasing the process economical competitiveness [22]. Glycerol is used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries, and recently its application to new fields such as animal feed, carbon feedstock in fermentations, polymers, surfactants, intermediates and lubricants has been developed [23].
The DIN EN 14214:2003 standard also limits the water content to the maximum value of 0.05% (w/w) [20]. Water can be introduced into biodiesel during the production process as well as during storage due to the more hydrophilic character of biodiesel when compared with conventional diesel. Water may affect biodiesel calorific value and, most importantly, the shelf life of the fuel since it decreases its oxidation stability, increasing the chances of oxidation products to be formed during long storage periods. These oxidation products can cause blocking and wearing of the injection systems. Water can also stimulate microorganisms growing that can change biodiesel properties [24-25].
The maximum amount of methanol in biodiesel is also regulated by the European biodiesel standards EN-14214 [20] (test method EN-14110), being the limit 0.2 % in mass. A higher alcohol content in biodiesel can cause engine problems such as accelerated deterioration of natural rubber seals and corrosion of Al and Zn engine parts, and influences the fuel properties causing lower density and viscosity values, lower flash points and transport and storage problems [26].
The typical biodiesel production and purification process is sketched in Figure 2 and can be described as follows: the basic catalyzed reaction takes place in a multiphase reactor where an oil reacts with an alcohol, usually in presence of a catalyst, to form fatty acid esters and glycerol [22]. The glycerol formed separates from the oil phase and at the outlet of the reactor two liquid phases co-exist: one of them rich in glycerol and the other in fatty acid methyl esters. The unreacted alcohol is distributed between these two liquid phases [9] (Figure 2(1)). After the reactor, the glycerol rich phase is sent to the alcohol recovery section where it is recovered by distillation and recycled into the reactor of the transesterification section. The glycerol-rich stream coming from the distillation process is then evaporated to decrease its water content and to meet the specifications for sale in the
glycerol market (Figure 2 (2)). The methyl ester stream leaving the transesterification reactor is washed with acidified water to neutralize the catalyst and to convert any existing soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of water saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the polar compounds. The washed methyl ester product is finally dried to reduce the water content to an acceptable value by the biodiesel required standards (Figure 2 (3)).
After the reactor, the unreacted alcohol is distributed between the two liquid phases formed, one rich in glycerol and the other rich in fatty acid esters. Excess alcohol removal from the fatty acid ester stream leaving the transesterification reactor can be performed by flash evaporation or distillation [9, 22]. Distillation is the most used method and the recovered alcohol is re-used in the transesterification process.

Process engineering simulation tools using thermodynamic models with a good predictive ability allow an easy evaluation and optimization of the operating variables and process configurations, thereby providing more insight to the influence of the most important parameters on process design. They are essential to identify process bottlenecks early in the design stage or existing ones, to select suitable selective solvents, the most
In the biodiesel industrial process a reliable thermodynamic model is needed for the description of the biodiesel production and purification processes whatever are the raw materials, the catalysts or the alcohols used.
The binary and multicomponent systems involved in the biodiesel production and purification processes are quite difficult to describe due to the strong polar interactions between their components.
Until recently, the most popular models for phase equilibria calculations in systems of polar compounds were local composition models based on the original quasi-chemical theory [28] such as the NRTL [29], the UNIQUAC [30], and the UNIFAC models [31]. These models can handle apolar, polar and some associating systems, but only in a limited pressure and temperature range.
On the other hand, cubic equations of state are able to describe systems in a broad pressure range, including near and supercritical compounds but are expected to perform poorly for systems containing polar and hydrogen bonding molecules [32]. The extension of equations of state to polar systems was initially accomplished through the coupling of excess Gibbs energy models within cubic equation of state mixing rules. However, when using cubic equations of state with complex gE mixing rules it is still frequently necessary to include temperature dependent binary interaction parameters that have to be fitted to experimental data, due to the limited predictive capability of those approaches [32].
The breakthrough in the modeling of polar and highly non ideal systems in larger temperature and pressure ranges came with the development of association equations of state (EoS), that explicitly describe the specific interactions between like molecules (selfassociation) and unlike molecules (cross-association), such as the group-contribution with association equation of state (GCA EoS) [33], the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) [34], the associated-perturbed-anisotopic-chain-theory (APACT) [35] and the Cubic-Plus-
Association equation of state CPA EoS [36].
This model is, among the association equations of state available, the most appropriate to deal with complex associating systems, considering the balance between accuracy, predictivity, simplicity and wide range of applicability.
The CPA EoS was previously successfully applied to model the phase equilibria of mixtures containing hydrocarbons, alcohols, glycols, water, amines, organic acids, aromatic or olefinic hydrocarbons, perfluorocarbons, esters and phenolic compounds. For instance, it provided very good results in modeling the SLE of the glycol + water system [37], the LLE and VLE of water + alcohol systems [38], the VLE of water + amine systems [39], the LLE of water + heavy alcohols systems [40], the VLE and the LLE of small acids + aliphatic hydrocarbons systems [41], the VLE of amine + alcohol [39] systems, the LLE of water + hydrocarbon systems [42], the LLE of water + aromatic hydrocarbons [42-43] and the LLE of water + perfluorocarbons [44].
This model combines a physical contribution with an association contribution, accounting for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and other non dispersive interactions [4547], originally proposed by Wertheim and used in other association equations of state such as SAFT.
1.2.	Scope and Objectives
Knowledge about the vapor-liquid and the liquid-liquid equilibria of binary and multicomponent systems that are formed during the biodiesel production and purification is of primary importance for designing, operating and optimizing the industrial process.
This is expected to be quite a difficult task since, contrary of what happened in petroleum refining, the presence of polar compounds with strong associative interactions increases the complexity of the phase equilibria description of these systems, where the usual thermodynamic models are expected to fail.
This work aims at developing a thermodynamic model to be applied in the evaluation of the design and in the optimization of the conditions of biodiesel production.
In the first part of this work, the different systems that were selected will be described, namely the liquid-liquid equilibria of water + fatty acid ester(s), of water + fatty acid and of fatty acid ester + alcohol + glycerol or water systems and the vapor-liquid equilibria of the water + glycerol, of glycerol + n-alcohol and of fatty acid ester + n-alcohol systems.
In the second part, excess Gibbs energy models, cubic equations of state, and equations of state coupled with excess Gibbs energy models will be use to describe the phase equilibria considered, and their results evaluated for the different systems.
The third part of this work will be dedicated to the modeling with the CPA EoS. The first step before starting with the phase equilibria modeling is the regression and correlation of the pure component equation of state parameters. Afterwards phase equilibria modeling will be performed using a multiphase flash algorithm with a built-in phase stability check.
The model will afterwards be generalized for real systems in a demonstration of its
1.3.	Selecting the phase equilibria for model evaluation
LLE can be found at several process units during the biodiesel production and purification process, involving oils, fatty acids and esters, water, alcohols and glycerol.
Specifically, LLE can be found in the multiphase reactor where the glycerol formed separates from the fatty acid esters phase and two liquid phases co-exist, one rich in glycerol and the other rich in biodiesel, and in the fatty acid esters washing units were the fatty esters current coming out from the reactor is washed in a liquid-liquid extractor in counter current with acidified water to neutralize the catalyst and to convert any soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of water saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the polar compounds [9, 22]. It is necessary to properly describe the LLE of fatty acid/fatty acid ester + water and fatty acid ester + alcohol + glycerol/water systems, in order to efficiently design and work with those operation units.
Experimental data are available for the water solubility in 11 pure esters (ethyl butanoate, propyl butanoate, methyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, methyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, methyl tetradecanoate, methyl hexadecanoate, methyl octadecanoate and methyl oleate) in the temperature range 288.15-323.15 K and at atmospheric pressure [48] and for the water solubility in 6 carboxylic acids (from pentanoic to decanoic acids) at temperatures from 288.15 to 323.15 K and at atmospheric pressure [49].
Data for multicomponent systems available in the open literature are scarce. Most of the available data concerns oil containing systems which due to lack of time weren't considered for this thesis but are now being addressed Data was found for the ternary systems methyl oleate + glycerol + methanol at 313, 333, 353 and 373 K [50-52], methyl myristate/methyl laurate/methyl stearate + ethanol + glycerol at 303.15 K [53], ethyl laurate/ethyl myristate + ethanol + water at 298.15, 313.15 and 333.15 K, methyl ricinoleate + glycerol + methanol at 298.15 K and methyl ricinoleate + glycerol + ethanol at 298.15 and 333.15 K [54], and for the quaternary system methyl oleate + glycerol + methanol + n-hexane at 293.15 K [55].
Experimental data are available for the VLE at atmospheric pressure of 5 alcohol + glycerol systems, namely from methanol to 1-butanol [27], of the water + glycerol system [27] and of thirteen ester + alcohol (methanol or ethanol) systems, considering esters from ethyl methanoate to methyl oleate [56].
At this point, it shall be referred that many of these measurements were performed at the research laboratory were the work for this thesis was carried out. The amount of data available at the start of this work was insufficient for the purposes of this work.
These experimental data will be used to evaluate the performance of cubic EoS, EoS - gE and gE models in the next chapter, and subsequently, of the CPA EoS.

Introduction
For the design and optimization of industrial processes it is essential to be able to accurately predict the phase equilibria as a function of temperature, pressure and composition of a specific system. This allows the correct selection of suitable solvents, the most advantageous unit operations and separation sequence and their optimal sizing and operating conditions. The use of reliable thermodynamic models is a necessary condition for an accurate description of the phase equilibria. For that purpose various models have been proposed.
Local composition models based on the original quasi-chemical theory [28] were for a long time the most popular for phase equilibria calculations in systems of polar compounds. The best known are the NRTL [29], the UNIQUAC [30], and the most used group contribution model in the petrochemical industry: the UNIFAC model [57]. These models have the advantage of being able to deal with apolar, polar and associating systems in a very flexible way, but as drawbacks the NRTL and the UNIQUAC models have no predictive capability towards new systems and their applicability is restricted to low pressures and a narrow temperature range. Moreover they can't handle permanent gases and near or supercritical compounds, high pressures and need significant amounts of data to regress the model parameters. These models also often perform poorly for highly polar and complex associating mixtures.
Through ongoing research work, the range of applicability of the original UNIFAC model, first proposed in 1975 [57], has been continuously extended. The accuracy and the range of applicability of the model greatly depends on the quality of its group interaction parameters. Using the original model the UNIFAC interaction parameters were reestimated by fitting LLE data in order to increase the representation of that type of phase equilibria (UNIFAC LLE) [58]. By 1987, two modified UNIFAC models were proposed with several advantages over the original model, based on the use of temperature dependent group-interaction parameters and modifications in the combinatorial term. For the Lyngby UNIFAC [59], a large database to fit temperature dependent group interaction parameters was applied, simultaneously including vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) and HE
Cubic equations of state are able to describe phase equilibria in a broad pressure range including near and supercritical conditions. Equations of state are indeed more complete than Gibbs free energy models as they explicitly incorporate the pressure (or density) effects, allowing the calculation of properties in a broader range of conditions.
The SRK (Soave-Redlich-Kwong) EoS [32] along with the PR (Peng-Robinson) EoS [32], with classical quadratic mixing rules, are the most popular cubic equations of state. However, they are expected to perform poorly for systems containing polar and hydrogen bonding molecules [32].
Aiming at getting the best of both worlds having a model that could simultaneously apply to high pressures at polar and hydrogen bonding systems, excess Gibbs energy models were coupled with cubic equations of state through the EoS-gE mixing rules. Huron and Vidal were the first to propose this concept [61] through the equality of the excess Gibbs energy calculated from the EoS and a gE model. Several problems had to be overcome, being the most relevant the fact that the derivation was carried at infinite pressure making impossible the use of gE models based on low pressure VLE data. Being gE a function of pressure its value can't be the same at low and at infinite pressure. Consequently, gE parameters had to be correlated to apply this model at low pressure, decreasing its predictive character [62]. It was found that it couldn't also safely extrapolate over temperature using temperature independent parameters.
To overcome that disadvantage and to avoid the iterative procedure [63] the original Huron-Vidal mixing rule was modified equating the equation of state and the gE models at zero pressure. Michelsen et al. [64-66] established two of the most successful and popular mixing rules of that kind, the MHV1 and the MHV2 rule, a first and a second-order approximation, respectively, making possible for EoS to use the existing gE model parameters. The gE model can in particular be the modified UNIFAC model. Even if the MHV1 and MHV2 rules can't satisfy the second virial coefficient boundary condition, they can provide a good description of highly nonideal systems with strong interactions [62].
A particular version of the MHV1 model forms the basis of the predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK) model [68] that is widely used in process simulators. With this model, UNIFAC results can be extended to higher temperatures and pressures. PSRK still provides, however, poor results for liquid densities and possesses all of the UNIFAC drawbacks [69].
A vast range of possibilities can be generated through the coupling of different equations of state and gE models, with various degrees of success. Nevertheless, when using cubic equations of state with complex gE mixing rules it is frequently necessary to include temperature dependent binary interaction parameters that have to be fitted to experimental data due to the limited predictive capability of those approaches [32].
A number of works over the last years have shown that the majority of EoS - gE models fail to adequately represent most of the asymmetric systems, due to the large difference between the two combinatorial terms originated by the large size difference between the components [70].
This chapter aims at providing a comparative review of how the various thermodynamic models, discussed above, perform in computing the different phase equilibria of polar binary and multicomponent systems of relevance for biodiesel production, in particular for its purification processes. Up to now, no study that compares all these models on a common basis has been reported. The available interaction parameters for the cubic EoS, gE and EoS - gE models were used and no refitting is done in order to keep the models predictive behavior.

2.3.1.	Binary systems containing glycerol and alcohols
For the description of the phase equilibrium in binary systems containing glycerol and alcohols the best non associative model found was, surprisingly, the SRK EoS, in particular for the methanol + glycerol mixture. A global average deviation of 1.3 % in the bubble temperatures for glycerol +alcohol systems was obtained with this model. This was a somewhat unexpected result, since cubic equations of state with classical mixing rules are known to be not applicable to systems with strong polar interactions. However, the near ideal behavior of these systems, in particular of the glycerol + methanol system [71], can explain the success of the SRK EoS in the description of these systems. The other models generally overestimate the bubble temperature, being the worst description obtained with the SRK-MHV2 model, with a global average deviation of about 7.0 %. Global average deviations between 3 % obtained with PSRK and 6 % (PR-MHV2) were observed for the other models (Table 2).
The PR-MHV2 model is the best to describe this system followed by the SRK-MHV2 and the UNIFAC models, providing global average deviations of about 2 % in the bubble points. These results are in agreement with the expected, since more complex mixing rules enable cubic equations of state to perform better for this kind of systems. The SRK EoS performs considerably worse, with errors of 3.7 % (Table 2).
2.3.3.	Binary systems containing fatty acid esters and methanol/ethanol
Starting with the methanol containing systems, the UNIFAC and the SRK-MHV2 models showed to describe quite well these phase equilibria, with global average deviations of less than 1 %. Greater deviations are obtained with the PR-MHV2 model and with the SRK EoS, and even bigger ones, of 2.5 %, with the PSRK EoS.
For ethanol + fatty acid ester systems it can't be a priori established which model is generally better, as the deviations are system dependent. For the methyl laurate system, the UNIFAC, the SRK-MHV2 and the PR-MHV2 models provide good and similar results. For methyl myristate the best model is the PR-MHV2 and for methyl oleate the SRK-MHV2. Global average deviations vary from 0.8 % (PR-MHV2) to 1.9 % (PSRK) for this kind of systems (Table 2).
For all the binary systems investigated here, the water solubility in the ester rich phase is greatly overestimated by the PR-MHV2 model and, especially for small esters containing systems, underestimated by the SRK EoS. Particularly the PR-MHV2 model describes poorly these equilibria as seen by the very large global average deviations (Table 3).
Different results are obtained depending on the chain length of the ester (Table 3). For the smaller esters, namely ethyl and propyl butanoate and methyl hexanoate, the UNIFAC and the SRK-MHV2 models are the best ones in computing the water solubility, both models providing quite similar results, with global average deviations lower than 34 %. On the contrary, for water + methyl heptanoate/methyl octanoate systems the PSRK equation of state, along with the UNIFAC model, performs better than the SRK-MHV2.
For the heavier ester systems, the PSRK EoS performs better than the other models, and performs especially well for methyl dodecanoate and methyl tetradecanoate containing mixtures, with global average deviations lower than 9 %. However, for the methyl octadecanoate system the UNIFAC model performs better, once again.
The characteristic difficulty of the SRK-MHV2 and PR-MHV2 models, with the existing Lyngby modified UNIFAC parameter table, to describe asymmetric systems [70] is here shown through deviations severely increasing while increasing the chain length of the ester (Table 3).
The very good original UNIFAC model results for the small ester systems are expected remembering this model good ability to deal with associating mixtures at moderate temperature and pressure conditions, such as are the phase equilibria of small esters and water containing systems investigated here. These results show that the original UNIFAC parameters estimated from VLE data can be extrapolated to describe LLE in the considered temperature range.
The SRK EoS underestimates the water solubility and shows to be unable to take into account the solvation between the polar small ester compounds and water.
2.3.5.	Description of water solubility in fatty acids
Systems with carboxylic acids usually have strong non ideal behavior being therefore significantly more difficult to model than ester mixtures. Actually, the deviations obtained for the water solubility in fatty acids are higher than the deviations obtained for the same property in water + fatty ester systems.
The MHV2 models and the SRK EoS poorly describe the water solubility in fatty acids. The PR-MHV2 and the SRK-MHV2 models overestimate the solubility with global average deviations of up to 190 %, and the SRK EoS, not able to take into account the association interactions, underestimates it.
The best model is the PSRK EoS followed by the UNIFAC model, as expected due to the good capability of these models to handle systems with strong interactions such as are the ones between water and acids. The complexity in describing these highly polar systems is demonstrated by the large average deviations provided by the above referred models, from 42 up to 190 % (Table 4).
Again, the VLE group interaction parameters of the original UNIFAC model can be extrapolated to LLE data description. A refitting of the group interaction parameters of the SRK/PR-MHV2 models is necessary for water + carboxylic acid systems.
2.3.6.
Modeling of the methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol system
Within the selected cubic EoS, EoS - gE and gE models, the best one to describe the LLE of this system for all the selected temperatures is the SRK-MHV2, providing global average deviations, according to equation 24, of 3.5 % (Table 5).

The UNIFAC model and the SRK EoS are also able to provide results in good agreement with the experimental data. The PR-MHV2 model underestimates the alcohol solubility in the ester rich phase, and the PSRK EoS provides a wrong slope for the tielines. Modeling results obtained at 333 K are depicted in Figures 3 and 4.

2.3.7. Modeling of the methyl laurate/myristate/stearate + ethanol + glycerol systems
Since no tie-line data were available for these systems, average deviations can't be computed as before. However some results at 303.15 K are presented, as example, in Figures 5 and 6, and the following conclusions can be drawn.
Contrary of what is observed for the methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol system, the best model to describe the solubility curve is the PR-MHV2. The other models predict a very large immiscibility region, particularly the SRK EoS. In general, the methyl laurate containing system is the system better represented by all thermodynamic models.

2.3.8. Modeling of the ethyl laurate/myristate + ethanol + water systems
The SRK EoS completely fails to describe these systems at all the considered temperatures. The other models, the SRK-MHV2, the PR-MHV2 and the UNIFAC models, perform very similarly, providing results in good agreement with the experimental data, with global average deviations inferior to 10 % (Eq. 24). Nevertheless, the PSRK EoS performs slightly worse than the other models. Results at 313.15 K are presented, as example, in Figures 7 and 8, and global average deviations in Tables 6 and 7.

2.4.	Conclusions
VLE and LLE data for binary and multicomponent systems composed of fatty acid esters, fatty acids, alcohols, water and glycerol were used to evaluate the performance of a cubic EoS, gE and EoS - gE models.
The SRK EoS, as expected, can't handle the VLE of the polar systems considered, excluding glycerol + alcohol mixtures for which the SRK EoS provides the best results. That is related to the near ideal behavior of these systems.
With the current available interaction parameters the PR-MHV2 and the SRK-MHV2 models can correctly describe the VLE of glycerol and water containing systems
and the VLE of fatty acid ester + methanol/ethanol mixtures. The original UNIFAC and the SRK-MHV2 models are adequate for computing the LLE of water + small fatty acid ester systems and the PSRK EoS and the UNIFAC models to describe water + acid and water + heavier fatty acid ester systems. The SRK EoS provides good results for the LLE of water + heavy fatty acid ester/fatty acid systems than the more complicated models PR-MHV2 and SRK-MHV2, which are unable to deal with asymmetric systems.
Considering ternary systems constituted by a fatty acid ester, an alcohol and glycerol, the SRK-MHV2 and the PR-MHV2 models are able to calculate tie-lines results in good agreement with the experimental data. When water is involved instead of glycerol, the SRK EoS isn't able to describe the LLE data and the other models provide similar satisfactory results.
As a major conclusion, none of the models studied so far is able to accurately estimate the different phase equilibria equally well. With this in mind, an association equation of state, the CPA EoS will be demonstrated in the following chapters to be the most adequate tool for the phase equilibria modeling in biodiesel production.
3.	The Cubic-Plus-Association Equation
of State (CPA EoS)
The results made possible to conclude that it is necessary to find a thermodynamic model that combines accuracy, predictivity, simplicity in the implementation and a wide range of applicability.
The solution to the problems described in the previous section seems to be in the use of theoretically sound models, that explicitly describe the associative specific interactions between like molecules (self-association) and unlike molecules (crossassociation), such as the group-contribution with association equation of state (GCA EoS) [33], the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) [34], the associated-perturbed-anisotopic-chain-theory (APACT) [35] and the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) [36]. Association equations of state were the breakthrough in the modeling of polar and highly non ideal systems in large temperature and pressure ranges.
Particularly, the CPA EoS has shown to be the most appropriate model of this kind to deal with complex associating systems, considering the balance between accuracy, predictivity and simplicity.
This model combines a physical contribution with an association contribution, accounting for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and other non dispersive interactions [4547], originally proposed by Wertheim and used in other association equations of state such as SAFT.
Using a generalized cubic term (in this work, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK)

CPA requires the knowledge of three pure component parameters for the physical part, a0, c1 and b, and two more for the association term, s and /3.

These parameters are estimated through a simultaneous regression of liquid density and vapor pressure data, employing the following objective function:

For alcohols two association schemes can be applied, the 2B and the 3B. Kontogeorgis et al. [74-75] had shown that there is not much improvement in using the more rigorous (3B) over the simpler (2B) association scheme. The 2B association scheme has been commonly used to model the phase equilibria of several alcohol systems. For instance, CPA using the 2B association scheme provides very good results for the LLE of water + alcohol + alkane systems [38] and for the LLE of water + alcohol systems [40], among others. Therefore the most successfully applied association scheme for alcohols, the two-site (2B), which proposes that hydrogen bonding occurs between the hydroxyl hydrogen and one of the lone pairs of electrons from the oxygen atom of another alcohol molecule [74], is the association scheme applied in this work.
For glycerol two association schemes were evaluated, the four-site (4C) and a new association scheme, the 3*2B, that considers the glycerol molecule as having three equal alcohol groups, each with two association sites [27].
For water, the 4C association scheme was adopted [73], considering that hydrogen bonding occurs between the two hydrogen atoms and the two lone pairs of electrons in the oxygen of the water molecules. This scheme is preferable to the simpler 3B scheme also suggested for the water molecule [74].
For acids the carboxylic group is treated as a single association site (1A). This association scheme had already been successfully applied to organic acid systems [76-77].
When dealing with mixtures, the energy and co-volume parameters of the physical term are calculated employing the conventional van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules, and for mixtures composed of non-associating compounds the binary interaction parameter, kij, is the only adjustable parameter.

where xi is the mole fraction of component i in the phases selected for optimization and Tb is the bubble point temperature. While using Eq. 37, single phase or all phase data can be used.
Otherwise, when CPA is employed to mixtures containing cross-associating molecules, combining rules for the association energy and volume parameters are required. Several combining rules have been suggested and applied with different results for different phase equilibria and systems:

CR-2 and CR-4 are the most commonly used combining rules as for most applications these combining rules have been found to be successful [40, 74-75]. For example, CR-2 provides very good results in the modeling of the LLE of water + heavy alcohol systems [75] and of the VLE of water + amine systems [39]; on the other hand, the CR-4 approach performed better in predicting the VLE of water + small alcohols systems [38, 75] and the SLE of MEG + water systems [37]. The Elliot rule also provided a very good description of the VLE and LLE of small acids + aliphatic hydrocarbons systems [41].
Within the cross-associating systems there is a special case that occurs when systems are constituted by a self-associating compound and a non associating compound that can cross-associate with the associating compound, as it is the case of the ester + alcohol/water systems. For the ester compound, a single association site able to crossassociate with the alcohol/water is considered [48]. For that type of systems a different procedure proposed by Folas et al. [78] has been used to obtain the corresponding crossassociation energy and volume. The cross-association energy between the ester and the alcohol or water is taken as half the alcohol or water association energy and the cross association volume is used as an adjustable parameter fitted to equilibrium data i.e. a modified CR-2 rule is used.
The following chapters are focused on the results provided by the CPA EoS for the systems of interest for the different operation units present in the biodiesel production and purification processes.
Association (CPA) Equation of State for
the water solubility in biodiesels
4.1.
Introduction
Some previous approaches to the modeling of ester systems can be found in the literature, and are described below.
Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) were developed using a genetic algorithm based variable-selection approach with quantum chemical descriptors, to efficiently describe the aqueous solubility of 71 sulfur-containing aromatic esters [79].
The UNIFAC model provided good predictions for the VLE of binary mixtures of propyl/methyl esters and alkan-1-ols and also for the LLE of ternary systems with water, acids and esters [80-82].
The non-random two liquid model (NRTL) was used to correlate the LLE of aqueous ternary mixtures containing esters, methanol [83] or 2-propanol [84], and the VLE of binary mixtures with ethanol and methyl esters [85].
Bureau et al. [86] applied several cubic equations of state to model the phase equilibria of methane + long ester systems. They found that the coupling of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation-of-state with the MHV2 and with the UNIFAC mixing rule gives very poor results while the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state using binary interaction parameters equal to zero gives the best results for low pressures but poor ones for high pressures. For these conditions the Elliott-Suresh-Donohue equation of state provided much better predictions.
The Peng-Robinson and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations of state with various types of mixing rules were as well used to satisfactory correlate the VLE of mixtures of CO2 with esters [87-89].
Gros et al. [33] extended the GC-EoS model to associating systems by the inclusion of a group contribution associating term, and then it was applied to the modeling of mixtures of fatty oils and their derivatives (fatty acids, fatty acid esters, mono- and diglycerides) with supercritical solvents like carbon dioxide or propane [92].
When water is involved, association equations of state are required to the description of the systems, since the general cubic equations of state such as the SRK and the PR EoS are not able to take into account the association between two molecules of water or the solvation between glycols, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters and water.
Recently, two versions of the GC-SAFT EoS based on the original SAFT and SAFT-VR were developed and applied to esters [93].
A group contribution version of the simplified PC-SAFT was also developed for several families of non-associating compounds (alkanes, aromatics, esters, etc) and used to successfully model the vapor-liquid phase equilibria of their mixtures [94]. None of these works deal however with the water solubility in fatty acid esters.
In this work, the ability of the CPA EoS to model the water solubility in several binary aqueous mixtures with methyl, ethyl and propyl fatty acid esters will be investigated. A cross association between the ester group and water was considered as was previously done for aromatic hydrocarbons [42] and the ky values are shown to follow a linear trend with the carbon number. The water solubility in biodiesel can be adequately predicted using a correlation for the interaction parameters obtained from the binary mixtures studied.
4.2.
Results and discussion
The five CPA pure compound parameters for water were previously determined [42] by a simultaneous regression of vapor pressure and liquid density data collected from the DIPPR database [95] in the reduced temperature range of 0.45 to 0.85.
The compounds of the ester family studied in this work are all non self- associating. In the DIPPR database [95] vapor pressure and saturated liquid density data were available for 12 methyl esters, 2 ethyl esters, 2 propyl esters, 4 butyl esters and also for 12 acetates, 10 formates and for one unsaturated methyl ester, allowing to study esters from 2 up to 19 carbons atoms, covering again the range of reduced temperatures from 0.45-0.85. An excellent description of the experimental vapor pressure and liquid densities is achieved with CPA, with global average deviations of 2.3 % and of 1.4 %, respectively.
The pure compound parameters for esters and water are reported in Tables 9 to11.

In a previous work [96], it was shown that the a0, cj and b CPA parameters of the n-alkanes and n-alcohols followed a trend within each homologous series, allowing the equation of state to be used as a predictive tool for these families of compounds in the absence of vapor pressure and liquid density data. Quadratic and linear correlations for the estimation of these parameters were then proposed. The same result was here observed for

It was also possible to see that esters with the same carbon number have very similar values for the pure compound parameters, especially for the a0 and b, being them methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl esters, acetates and even formates.
Long chain methyl esters and acetates were also evaluated. Vapor pressure data was available for these heavier methyl esters [97-98] (C10, C12 and from C14 to C19), in temperature ranges between 271.4 K and 430.0 K, and the set of regressed pure compound parameters, that followed the trends of the lighter esters are reported as well in Tables 9 and 10. The critical temperatures were estimated through the Wilson and Jasperson [99] model that was previously assessed and found to be the most appropriate one for fatty acid methyl esters [100].
The same approach was used for the long chain acetates (C14 and C16), where experimental data in the temperature range 288.9-320.3 K was available [101].
4.2.2.	Description of the water solubility in fatty acid esters and biodiesels
Having estimated the pure compound parameters it was possible to model the available experimental data for the water solubility in several methyl, ethyl and propyl esters [48].
For methyl octanoate, methyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate and ethyl decanoate no vapor pressure and liquid density data was available, and so their pure compound parameters were considered to be equal to the ones of the ester with the same carbon number.
As mentioned above in the description of the model, the cross-association between the ester group and water was taken into account as previously done for aromatic hydrocarbons [42], and the solvation scheme involving combining rules for the cross association energy and volume parameters was used. Using this approach, and in a first attempt, both the binary interaction kij and the cross association 3ij parameters were fitted to the experimental water solubility data [48]. If the solvation phenomena is not considered the water solubility is strongly under estimated.
As expected, since the cross-association between water and esters will always occur between water and the ester group, the majority of the regressed values for 3j were close to 0.201. Therefore, this parameter was fixed to that value and the kfs were then refitted.
A generalized linear correlation for the kj binary interaction parameter was found with the chain length of the ester, Cn, described, by Eq. 43. This linear dependency with the solvent chain length had been previously observed in studies involving the phase equilibria of water + n-alkane systems [42].
For the methyl oleate system the same value for Pj was used, but the regressed kij did not fit in the linear dependency with the carbon number determined for the saturated methyl esters. Still, these set of optimized binary parameters still provides a very good description of the water solubility, with global average deviations smaller than 5% as shown in Table 12.

Only binary interaction parameters for ester + water systems were considered with the fa/s for ester + ester being set to zero. The binary interaction parameter correlation (Eq. 43) and the constant cross association volume here proposed (fy = 0.201) were used. For the binary system with the unsaturated methyl linoleate + water, for which no binary experimental data was available, the same value for the kij used before for the binary methyl oleate + water was employed. Good results were obtained with global average deviations of 15.5 % as presented in Table 13, thus showing the adequacy of the proposed model for the prediction of the water solubility in biodiesels. The description of the water solubility in the biodiesel F rich phase is presented in Figure 12.
4.3.	Conclusions
The CPA EoS can take into account the strong polar interactions between esters and water, describing the water solubility in binary ester systems, with global average deviations inferior to 7 %, and predicting it in six different biodiesels with global deviations smaller than 16%.
For a very good description of the water solubility in fatty acid esters a single, small, and temperature-independent binary interaction parameter and a constant value for the cross association volume are sufficient. A chain length dependent correlation for the binary interaction parameters is proposed making the model fully predictive.

Introduction
Fatty acids are important commodities with an increasing wide range of industrial applications [103]. Widespread use can be found in different products, such as: household and industrial cleaners, coatings and adhesives, paints, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, industrial lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, polymers, textiles, foods, paper, crayons, candles and waxes. Particular applications of some specific fatty acids can be found elsewhere [103]. Fatty acids can also be used as raw materials for fatty alcohols and biodiesel production [103-104].
Although the chain length limits used to define fatty acids are not strict, these are typically higher chain length aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6-24 carbon atoms. According to literature, the worldwide production capacity for fatty acids in 2001 was around 4 x 106 metric tons [103].
Even though shorter chain length carboxylic acids are usually produced synthetically, most of the fatty acids are obtained from natural oils and fats by hydrolysis (chemical or enzymatic). Hydrolysis converts the oil or fat (a triglyceride) into three fatty acid molecules and glycerol, usually at high temperature and high pressure conditions, using about 30-60 % water in a fatty acid weight basis. In some cases, acid washing is performed before the hydrolysis reaction in order to remove impurities. Following hydrolysis, different purification processes can be employed, among them crystallization (typically with methanol or acetone), solvent extraction (either liquid-liquid or supercritical fluid extraction) distillation and adsorption. Distillation removes color and odor bodies
[105], low boiling unsaponifiable materials, polymerized materials, triglycerides and heavy decomposition products. Other separation processes include hydrophilization, panning and pressing and formation of solid urea complexes [103].
The design and optimization of the biodiesel purification section requires a model that can describe the phase equilibria of water + fatty acid systems that are formed during the fatty esters rich current washing in a liquid-liquid extractor with acidified water, were soaps are converted to free fatty acids.
The A-UNIFAC model was satisfactorily applied to predict vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria and to compute infinite dilution activity coefficients for mixtures containing alcohols, carboxylic acids, water, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes
[106]	. Applying the A-UNIFAC model to associating systems is quite demanding since it is necessary to analyze every UNIFAC functional group in order to recognize the presence of associating sites.
Another thermodynamic model proposed for acid systems is the group contribution equation of state, GC-EoS developed by Skjold-Jorgensen [90] that was extended by Ferreira et al. [92] to associating mixtures of fatty oils and their derivatives (fatty acids, fatty acid esters and mono- and di-glycerides) with supercritical solvents like carbon dioxide or propane. This association model, initially proposed by Gros et al. [33], provided results in better agreement with the experimental data than the GC-EoS.
The coupling of a cubic equation of state (SRK) with a model that expresses the dimerization of the acid molecules was also used to correlate experimental VLE for gases in acetic acid [76-77].
The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) model was used to compute phase equilibria of formic, acetic and propanoic acid binary systems with aromatic hydrocarbons
[107]	. The same approach was followed by Fu and Sandler [108] and its results compared to those of the simplified SAFT EoS. These two models were also used, in the same work, to correlate cross-associating systems containing acids, alcohols and water. The original SAFT model performed better than the simplified one, but none of them was able to produce a good description of aqueous systems.
The Cubic plus Association (CPA) EoS was used to correlate VLE and LLE for short chain acids + aliphatic hydrocarbons systems, in agreement with the experimental
In this study, the CPA EoS is applied for the first time to carboxylic acids heavier than propanoic acid (up to C20 for pure component properties and up to C18 for mixtures), and to the description of the LLE and SLE of their binary mixtures with water.
Systems with carboxylic acids are usually strongly non-ideal and considerably more difficult to model than ester mixtures.
As both water and acids are associating components, two different associating combining rules will be here evaluated, on the basis of their ability to correlate these water + fatty acid systems.
It will be shown that short chain and long chain carboxylic acids have different behavior requiring different cross-associating combining rules and that the dissociation of the acids smaller than pentanoic acid will have a major impact on their mutual solubilities with water. To correlate the mutual solubilities of water and carboxylic acids studied in this work, only binary interaction parameters (kij) in the physical part of CPA were used, and these were found again to be linearly dependent on the acid chain length.
Using this dependency for the interaction parameters, SLE predictions for seven fatty acids in water will also be presented in this chapter.
5.2.	Results and discussion
5.2.1.	Correlation of the CPA pure compound parameters for the carboxylic acids
The organic acids studied in this work are all self-associating and so the five CPA parameters must be estimated for each compound. This was done by a simultaneous regression of vapor pressure and saturated liquid density data, collected from the DIPPR database [95], covering the range of reduced temperatures from 0.45-0.85, for linear
saturated carboxylic acids from 1 up to 20 carbon atoms and for the unsaturated oleic acid, an important natural product with 18 carbon atoms and a double bound at carbon 9, usually referred as 18:1. The results reported in Table 14, show that it is possible with CPA to achieve an excellent description of the experimental (correlated) vapor pressure and liquid densities for all the studied acids, with global average deviations of about 2 % for both properties.
Once again, as was observed previously for the alkane and alcohol families [42, 96] and in the previous chapter for esters, the CPA pure component parameters for the acid series also seem to follow a smooth trend with the carbon number.

In order to improve the predictive character of the CPA EoS, linear correlations for the kij values with the carbon number were previously proposed for alkanes + water [42] and ester + water mixtures. For the heavier acids the trends of the ky values with the carbon number are also close to a linear tendency, as seen in Figure 13.
Figure 13. Ay trend with the acid carbon number (♦, CR-2; ■, CR-4) and linear correlations (—, CR-2;	CR-4 ).
The kij values for the smaller acids are somewhat off the linear tendency, particularly for pentanoic acid. Nevertheless, in order to increase the predictive character of the model, linear correlations of the kij with the chain length of the acid, Cn, for the two combining rules evaluated, were proposed, and described by Eqs. 44 and 45 for CR-2 and CR-4, respectively, in order to allow the applicability of the model for heavier acids whenever equilibria data are not available. The extrapolation of the linear correlation will further be shown to be successful for the description of fatty acids + water systems from C12 to C18.

k? = -0.0142 x Cn + 0.0020	(45)
Results on the water rich phase are more dependent on the binary interaction
parameter than on the acid rich phase. Small variations in the ky’s values result in significant deviations in the description of the water rich phase with almost no impact in the acid rich phase. In fact, and for both association combining rules, the values for the kij’s optimized using both phases follow the same dependency as the kij’s evaluated solely from the water rich phase. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to predict the behavior of the acid rich phase from the binary interaction parameters optimized using only data from the water rich phase.
The estimated kij’s are small, indicating that the CPA EoS is able to take adequately into account the cross-association interactions that occur in water + fatty acid systems, with any of the combining rules studied.
As shown in Figure 13, for the pentanoic acid + water system, the kij value was considerably off the linear tendency observed for the other compounds, indicating that different interactions may be present on this system. This deviation of the pentanoic acid from the behavior of the other acids may be due to a higher degree of dissociation of the pentanoic acid in water, that the CPA EoS does not take into account. This may also be related to the unexpected behavior of butanoic acid. From the analysis of the mutual solubilities of the higher acids, the phase envelopes of pentanoic and hexanoic acids, and the CPA predictions using the kil correlations, it would be expected that butanoic acid would only be partially miscible with water at room temperature. Yet, full miscibility of butanoic acid and water is observed under these conditions. This enhanced solubility of the lower acids in water results from new favorable interactions between the two compounds, not fully represented by the approach used in this work.
5.2.3.	Evaluation of the Combining rule
The two combining rules studied produce very different descriptions of the acid rich phase but have no impact on the water rich phase, showing very similar global average deviations.
As shown in Table 15 the CR-2 combining rule produces better results for smaller
The opposite behavior was observed for the CR-4 rule, producing very good results for the heavier acids. The CR-4 combining rule performs globally better than the CR-2 with the advantage of increasing the calculation speed. With this combining rule, the water solubility in acids is described with a global average deviation below 30 %. The acid solubility in water is estimated with a global average deviation below 6 %, as reported in Table 15. Phase equilibria results for water + fatty acid systems are depicted in Figures 14 and 15.

Figure 15. Mutual solubilities for two water + acid systems. Experimental (▲, water + octa-noic acid; •, water + decanoic acid) and CPA results (—, CR-2; "", CR-4 ).
The results clearly indicate that the CPA-EoS provides a good description of the phase equilibria for water-fatty acid binary systems. The proposed model and the linear correlation for the binary interaction parameters can be used as a predictive tool to the description of systems of interest in industrial processes were organic and aqueous phases are present. For instance, for the oleic acid + water system, for which LLE data at higher temperatures and pressures were available in the literature [111]. The CR-4 combining rule and the ky predicted through the linear correlation were used. As seen in Figure 15 very good results were obtained for the water solubility with a global average deviation inferior to 6 %. The same prediction was made for the dodecanoic acid + water system with global average deviations inferior to 22 % for the water solubility.
5.2.4.
Prediction of the solubility of solid fatty acids in water
Saturated fatty acids above decanoic acid are solid at room temperature and their solubilities in water are solid - liquid equilibria.
The CPA EoS has been previously applied to the description of the SLE of alcohol - alkanes, glycol - water and alcohol - water mixtures [75], but never to the SLE of fatty acids and water systems. The purpose here is to investigate the predictive performance of the CPA EoS with the interaction parameter correlations obtained from LLE data and for each combining rule selected.
Equations to describe the SLE for binary systems are well established in the literature [112]. Considering the formation of a pure solid phase and neglecting the effect of pressure, the solubility of a solute s can be calculated from the following generalized expression that relates the reference state fugacities:
h fsliq(T, P)	AfusHs
id. P)	R
f 1	1	acp r
IT	T m,s J	R
(46)
— - ln i — V1 T T J
where AfusHs is the solute enthalpy of fusion, T is the absolute temperature, Tms is the solute melting temperature, AC is the difference of the liquid and solid molar heat capacities and R the gas constant.
The heat capacity contribution can be neglected with respect to the enthalpic term, as already observed for fatty acid systems in the work from Costa et al. [113] where the high pressure solid-liquid equilibria of fatty acids was studied. Complete immiscibility in the solid phase and absence of a solid-complex phase were also assumed.

The following expression for the solubility is then considered,

Few fatty acid experimental SLE data in water are available in the literature and only for 7 fatty acids (from C12 to C18) [110].
The values for the melting properties needed to perform SLE calculations, melting temperature (Tm) and heat of fusion (Hs), found in literature [95] are presented at Table 16.

These properties increase with the organic acid carbon number and a parity effect can be observed due to differences in the molecular packing of these compounds in the solid state.
This time, the CR-2 combining rule performed better than CR-4 with global average deviations of 51 % and 63 %, respectively, as seen in Table 16 and Figure 16.

Part of these deviations may be attributed to the low accuracy of the experimental data available. However, very satisfactory SLE predictions were achieved with the proposed model and using a single interaction parameter correlated from LLE data.
5.3.	Conclusions
The CPA EoS was extended to long chain carboxylic acids and their binary aqueous mixtures. Two different combining rules were tested.
A single, small, temperature independent and chain length dependent binary interaction parameter was enough to describe the mutual solubilities. A correlation for the binary interaction parameters was proposed.
For small acids, from C5 to C7, the CR-2 combining rule produced somewhat better results for the mutual solubilities, while the Elliot combining rule (CR-4) performed better
The kij correlation was successfully extrapolated to model the LLE of the oleic acid + water and dodecanoic acid + water systems and to predict the SLE of binary aqueous mixtures with fatty acids from C12 to C18, supporting the use of a linear correlation with the acid carbon number for the binary interaction parameters.

Introduction
The glycerol recovery section is incorporated in order to remove as much glycerol as possible from biodiesel, since the maximum free glycerol value admissible according to the European Standard EN 14214 is 0.02 wt % [20]. Glycerol impacts negatively on the fuel properties [22, 114] and profits from selling it into the commercial glycerol market reduces biodiesel production costs in 22-36 % [22], improving the economic viability of biodiesel. Glycerol has several different potential uses in medical, pharmaceutical (drugs) and personal care preparations (cosmetics and toothpastes), tobacco and food processing (as a food additive, solvent, sweetener or as a component of food packaging materials) and as a raw material in different chemical industries, for example, in the production of acetals, amines, esters and ethers, mono- and di-glycerides and urethane polymers [115].
The accurate knowledge of the vapor-liquid equilibria of glycerol + alcohol and glycerol + water systems is thus essential for the design of the separation and purification processes of the glycerol recovery section.
As glycerol, water and alcohols are associating molecules, equations of state that do not explicitly describe association interactions are expected to perform poorly for these systems. The SAFT EoS had already been successfully applied to the description of the vapor-liquid equilibria of the binary system water + glycerol and to the ternary water/1,3-propanediol/glycerol, in the work of Li et al. [116], with binary interaction parameters obtained from experimental data of the binary subsystems. The difficulty of the description of the water + glycerol system can be hinted from this work by the fact that among the several binary systems studied only the glycerol + water system requires two temperature dependent binary interaction parameters in order to obtain an adequate description of the data.
Although the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state has been successfully applied to systems containing glycols, such as to the binary systems with aromatic or olefinic hydrocarbons [78] and to the binary and ternary systems containing glycols, water and aromatic hydrocarbons [117], it has never been applied to glycerol containing systems.
A discussion about the most appropriate CPA pure component parameters for glycerol is presented. Two associating combining rules are evaluated for the description of the VLE data for glycerol + alcohol systems.
6.2.	Results and discussion
6.2.1.	Correlation of the CPA pure compound parameters for alcohols and glycerol
The compounds studied for the VLE in this chapter are self-associating and thus five CPA pure compound parameters must be estimated.
For alcohols, except for 2-propanol, these parameters were previously obtained by a simultaneous regression of selected vapor pressure and saturated liquid density data, collected from the DIPPR database [95], covering the range of reduced temperatures from 0.45 to 0.85 [96]. 2-propanol CPA parameters were here estimated and their values are reported in Table 17.

For glycerol, two different association schemes (4C and 3x2B) were investigated. When using the 4C scheme, only one set of pure compound parameters providing a reasonable description of the liquid density and vapor pressures was obtained, with global average deviations of 1.4 % and 1.1 %, respectively, for the vapor pressure and liquid density. With the 3x2B scheme, two sets of parameters are obtained, with global average deviations inferior to 0.8 % for the vapor pressure and to 1.5 % for the liquid density. Results are presented in Table 17.
The parameters values are rather uniform in the two sets, except for the a0 parameter and for the association energy parameter, s.
The prediction performance of the model depends on the pure compound parameters, therefore the best set of parameters for glycerol will be selected based also on their suitability for modeling the VLE of binary mixtures of glycerol with alcohols from C1 to C4. It will be shown that the best set is the one obtained using as first estimates the ethylene glycol's CPA parameters available in the literature [118] (set 2).
To obtain a good vapor liquid equilibria description, the fitting of the binary interaction parameter kij is required. Bubble temperature experimental data [27] were used for the binary interaction parameter optimization, using the objective function presented in Eq. 38. Results for the kij values and global average deviations for the bubble temperatures for the different association schemes and combining rules used are presented at Tables 18 and 19.

For glycerol, the association schemes 4C and the two 3x2B sets of parameters in
Table 17 were evaluated.
Positive and small binary interaction parameters when using the 3x2B scheme second set of CPA parameters for glycerol suggests that the right interactions between unlike molecules are being considered and that apparently, cross-association between glycerol and alcohols isn't underestimated, what happens when using the simpler 4C scheme.
The results are strongly dependent on the choice of the glycerol parameters when using the 3x2B scheme. The first set of 3x2B parameters for glycerol has been found to generally give larger and negative binary interaction parameters and higher global average deviations when modeling the VLE data for glycerol + alcohol systems. For the water + glycerol system this set of parameters fails to correlate the phase equilibrium, with a large binary interaction parameter and produces a poor description of the VLE curve (Figure 17).
With the second set of pure compound parameters for glycerol, positive and small binary interaction parameters are required to obtain a description of the bubble point curves with global average deviations inferior to 1 % for the glycerol + alcohol systems. For methanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol, very satisfactory results are obtained even with pure predictions (kij=0') with global average deviations inferior to 1.1 %. VLE results are depicted in Figures 18 and 19.
Two combining rules, CR-2 and CR-4, are used in order to evaluate their correlation performance for isobaric VLE of glycerol + alcohol systems, using the 3x2B association scheme and the second set of parameters.
Very similar results are obtained when using the two rules especially for systems with the heavier alcohols. For the binary mixtures with ethanol and methanol the binary interaction parameters are slightly higher when using the CR-2 combining rule. Still the obtained global average deviations for the bubble temperatures are very similar, as seen in
As the deviations are slightly superior for the CR-2 combining rule, as well as the majority of the binary interaction parameters, and taking advantage of its increase in computational speed, the CR-4 combining rule can be considered to be the more suitable one to compute the phase equilibria of glycerol + alcohol systems.

For the water + glycerol mixture, a correct description of the equilibrium curve is achieved, although at the expense of a slightly larger (negative) ky for both association schemes, suggesting that the strong polar interactions between water and glycerol are underestimated by CPA. A global average deviation of 0.7 % for the bubble point curve was obtained for this mixture with the 3x2B scheme second set of CPA parameters for glycerol.
Nevertheless, the CPA EoS performs better than the SAFT model in correlating this binary system. In the work of Li et al. [116], referred in the preceding introduction section, good results are only obtained increasing the model complexity, using two (and temperature dependent) binary interaction parameters: the binary interaction parameter for the dispersion interactions, kij, and the bonding volume parameter for the association kAB
interactions, j . In this work, the CPA EoS provided very good binary VLE results, requiring only a single and temperature independent kij keeping the general predictive character of the model.
The results support the choice of the 3x2B associating scheme for glycerol and the option for the second set of parameter values, presented in Table 17. This will be the selection for the modeling of multicomponent systems containing glycerol, to be presented in Chapter 8.
6.3.	Conclusions
In this chapter the CPA EoS was extended to the modeling of the VLE of glycerol containing systems.
Two different association schemes for glycerol, the well known four-site (4C) and a new one suggesting 6 association sites, 3x2B, have been considered for the correlation of the available experimental data. Two similar sets of CPA pure component parameters for glycerol, in terms of the good description of vapor pressure and liquid densities were obtained when using this new association scheme.
Also, two different combining rules were tested, CR-2 and CR-4, that showed to have similar performances.
A single, temperature independent, binary interaction parameter was enough to provide excellent description of the VLE data, with global average deviations inferior to 1 %.
7.	VLE correlation of ester + alcohol systems with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) Equation of State
7.1.
Introduction
Alcohol removal from the fatty acid ester stream leaving the transesterification reactor can be performed by flash evaporation or distillation [9, 22]. Distillation is the most used method and the recovered alcohol is re-used in the transesterification process [9, 22].
The knowledge about the vapor-liquid equilibrium conditions of these systems is essential for a correct sizing of the operation units involved in methanol recovery.
Despite their importance, it is a quite demanding task to describe the phase equilibria of these systems, due to their large deviation from ideality [121], and, in fact, only few of the available thermodynamic models can successfully represent such systems without a significant amount of data to regress the model parameters.
Resa et al. [122-123] reported isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria data for methanol binary mixtures containing ethyl butyrate and ethyl propionate, and correlated it with the Margules, van Laar, UNIQUAC, NRTL and Wilson equations and the ASOG method. The same approach was followed by Tu et al. [124] that presented isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria data for the binary mixtures of methanol with methyl acetate and methyl acrylate, and satisfactorily described them with the Margules, Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC models. The isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria of methyl butanoate, propyl butanoate and ethanol binary systems and their modeling with the UNIFAC and ASOG models, can also be found in the literature [125-126]. Another approach used by Soto et al. [127] that reported isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria data for the binary system composed of ethanol and ethyl methanoate, was to model it with two different versions of the UNIFAC model [127].
In spite of all these works using activity coefficient models to adequately describe the phase equilibria in broader temperature and pressure conditions, equations of state have been found to be more appropriate, considering the balance between accuracy, predictivity
and simplicity [32, 128].
Not many studies on ester + alcohol systems with equations of state can be found in the literature. Among these, Ferreira et al. [129] applied the group contribution with association equation of state (GCA-EoS) to model binary systems of small esters and alcohols and latter Andreatta et al. [51] applied the new GCA-EoS parameters estimated by Ferreira et al. to predict the LLE of the ternary mixture methyl oleate + glycerol + methanol.
The purpose of this chapter is to extend the good applicability of the CPA EoS reported in the previous chapters to binary mixtures constituted by an ester and an alcohol.
It will be shown that the CPA EoS is able to accurately take into account the increased solvation due to the interaction between the ester and the hydroxyl group, through a solvation scheme for the cross association energy and volume, and in addition, that the ky values are again shown to follow a linear trend with the ester carbon number, enhancing the model predictivity.
7.2.	Results and Discussion
7.2.1.	Correlation of the Vapor—Liquid Equilibria of ester and methanol/ethanol containing systems
Having the pure compound parameters, previously determined at Chapter 4, it was possible to describe with the CPA EoS the vapor-liquid equilibria of binary systems with methanol/ethanol and an ester.
As discussed at the model section (Chapter 3), the cross-association between the ester group and the hydroxyl group was considered, as previously done for aromatic hydrocarbons + water systems [42-43, 78] and for ester + water systems, using the solvation scheme involving combining rules for the cross association energy and leaving the cross association volume as an adjustable parameter.
For the methanol mixtures, VLE data for ester + methanol systems with different ester chain lengths were selected from the literature, namely for methyl acetate [124], ethyl propionate [123], ethyl butanoate [122], hexyl acetate [130], methyl laurate, methyl myristate and methyl oleate [56]. In a first attempt, both the binary interaction kj and the cross association ( parameters were fitted to the experimental VLE data. As expected, since the cross-association between methanol and the ester will always occur between the hydroxyl and the ester group, the regressed values for ( were close to 0.13. Therefore, this parameter was fixed to that value and the k/s were then refitted to the experimental data. A generalized linear correlation for the binary interaction parameter, kj, was found with the carbon number of the ester, Cn, described by Eq. 48 and represented in Figure 20. One should also notice that this linear dependency had previously been observed when applying the CPA EoS to model the phase equilibria of water + fatty acid ester (Chapter 4), water + acid (Chapter 5) and alkane + water systems [42].

With a temperature independent kj and a constant value for 3j for all binaries it was possible to describe the experimental VLE data of methanol systems with global average absolute deviations inferior to 0.3 %. Binary interaction parameters and average deviations are presented in Table 20 and the VLE for the methanol systems with methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl oleate and hexyl acetate are presented as examples in Figures 21 to 24.

Due to the good results obtained for methanol mixtures the same methodology was adopted in the following calculations for ethanol systems. VLE data for ethanol binaries with ethyl methanoate [127], methyl butanoate [126], hexyl acetate [130], methyl laurate, methyl myristate and methyl oleate were used [56]. The regressed values for Pj were close to 0.10. The estimated cross-association volume parameter is now slightly lower than that obtained for methanol systems. Still, that seems to be a reasonable estimate which can be explained by the weaker solvation effect of the higher chain length alcohol. Fixing this parameter, the ky's were recalculated and their values were also found to correlate linearly with the ester carbon number, as described by Eq. 49 and presented in Figure 20.

With a single value of kj for each system, together with a constant value for the cross-association volume for all systems it was possible to describe the VLE data of ethanol systems with very good agreement with the experimental results. Values for the binary interaction parameters and average deviations are presented in Table 21. VLE for the systems with methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl oleate and hexyl acetate are depicted in Figures 21 to 24.

The overall description of the VLE phase diagrams of ester + alcohol systems provided by the CPA EoS is almost excellent, using only small, temperature independent and linearly correlated kij,s and constant values for P depending on the alcohol, showing the adequacy of the CPA EoS to take into account the solvation phenomena encountered in ester + alcohol mixtures. The results obtained support the use of this model for the description of this type of systems, following also other successful previous applications to the description of systems relevant to biodiesel production and purification.
7.3.	Conclusions
The Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state was here extended to the modeling of the VLE of ester + alcohol systems. It was demonstrated that the CPA EoS can take into account the strong polar interactions between esters and alcohols, describing the VLE of ester + alcohol systems with global average deviations inferior to 0.3 %.
A single, small, and temperature-independent binary interaction parameter was sufficient and a constant value for the cross association volume was adopted for each alcohol binaries. The binary interaction parameter was found to be linearly correlated with the ester carbon number, allowing the CPA EoS to predict the phase equilibria of ester + alcohol systems for which small or none experimental data are available.
8.	Modeling of biodiesel multicomponent systems with the Cubic-PlusAssociation (CPA) Equation of State
8.1.
Introduction
Up to now only limited experimental phase equilibrium data has been made available and essentially the conventional activity coefficient models have been applied to predict these data. Andreatta et al. [51] used the UNIFAC with association (A-UNIFAC) model and also the group contribution with association equation of state (GCA-EoS) to describe the methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol system. A good agreement with the experimental data was obtained, particularly with the GCA-EoS model. The Wilson activity coefficient model was also applied to describe mixtures of biodiesel and glycerol as well as biodiesel + glycerol + methanol systems [131-132].
In order to analyze the possibility to use n-hexane for biodiesel extraction, Tizvar et al. [55] experimentally measured the LLE of the methyl oleate + glycerol + methanol + n-hexane system and modeled it with the UNIFAC and Modified UNIFAC models.
Recently França et al. [54] reported new experimental data for methyl ricinoleate + methanol + glycerol and methyl ricinoleate + ethanol + glycerol systems and their satisfactory correlation with the UNIQUAC model.
Experimental results for other useful systems for the biodiesel purification processes were also presented by Zhou etal. [133] and Liu etal. [134].
The change from oil to vegetable oils and/or animal fats as raw materials for diesel production represents a minor change in terms of fuel properties but a significant change in complexity in terms of intermolecular interactions. While in the conventional oil industry vapor-liquid is the dominant phase equilibria, in biodiesel production both vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria are involved, as well as water becomes an important component. In order to describe these highly non-ideal systems in broad temperature, pressure and composition conditions, associating equations of state are required.
For the glycerol containing systems, two approaches were considered to evaluate the binary interaction parameters for all possible component pairs for each multicomponent system and a discussion about the best approach to carry the parameter estimation will be provided.
8.2.	Results and Discussion
8.2.1.	Pure component CPA parameters for methyl ricinoleate, ethyl laurate and ethyl myristate
In the chapter considering the description of water + fatty acid ester systems by the CPA EoS, it was shown that the a0, c1 and b CPA parameters for esters followed a trend with the ester carbon number, as previously observed for the n-alkane and n-alcohol series [96]. It was also observed that esters with the same carbon number have similar values for the pure compound parameters, being those either methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl esters, acetates and even formates. Therefore, quadratic and linear correlations for the estimation of these parameters could be proposed, enabling to calculate the CPA pure compound parameters in the absence of vapor pressure and liquid density data, as happens for ethyl laurate and ethyl myristate.
In fact, for esters for which no vapor pressure and liquid density data were available, using pure compound parameters equal to the ones of another ester with the same carbon number provided very good results for the water solubility in binary ester systems.
Due to the lack of available literature data for these fatty acid esters critical
For methyl ricinoleate, no CPA pure compound parameters were previously estimated. For this compound, vapor pressure and liquid density data were calculated by literature group contribution methods, the SIMPOL.1 [135] model for vapor pressures and the GCVOL [136] model for liquid densities. The SIMPOL.1 was developed using a set of 277 compounds and examined using a test set of 184 compounds. The average over all points of the absolute difference between experimental and predicted values of log10P was 0.34. Elbro et al. [136] showed that liquid densities can be predicted with an error of approximately 1% for several compounds of different families (alkanes, aromatics, alkenes, ketones, ethers, esters, chlorides, etc).
Methyl ricinoleate critical temperature was estimated through the Constantinou and Gani [99] group-contribution method. This unsaturated fatty ester has a hydroxyl group (Figure 25), and so, the 2B association scheme was used for this compound.

All the CPA pure compound parameters used in this chapter are presented at Table 22 along with the deviations obtained for methyl ricinoleate liquid densities and vapor pressures.

8.2.2.	Modeling of multicomponent systems containing glycerol
8.2.2.1.	Binary interaction parameters from binary data
Having the pure component parameters, the remaining parameters to be fitted are the binary interaction parameters to be regressed from experimental data. Although the liquid-liquid equilibrium of ester + glycerol + alcohol systems is important to evaluate the separation of transesterification products in biodiesel production, not much experimental data are available.
The first approach to model those systems was to use binary interaction parameters for the binary subsystems obtained from binary equilibria data. The subsystems possible comprise fatty acid ester + glycerol, glycerol + alcohol and fatty acid ester + alcohol mixtures. For fatty acid ester + glycerol mixtures, phase equilibria data was only available for two LLE systems, namely methyl dodecanoate + glycerol and methyl hexanoate + glycerol [137]. The cross-association between the ester group and glycerol was taken into

As no other binary systems composed by ester and glycerol were available in the literature, the results obtained for methyl dodecanoate + glycerol were considered to represent binary subsystems glycerol + fatty ester.
Glycerol + methanol and glycerol + ethanol systems were previously studied with the CPA EoS and a new association scheme was proposed for glycerol, the 3*2B. With a single and temperature independent binary interaction parameter it was possible to successfully correlate the VLE data of these systems, as observed in a previous chapter.
The last binary subsystems for the ternary modeling are the fatty acid ester + methanol (or ethanol) binary mixtures. Studying ester + methanol and ester + ethanol systems with ester carbon numbers from 5 up to 19 for ethanol systems and from 3 up to 19 for methanol systems, it was possible to establish a linear correlation for the binary interaction parameter with the ester carbon number. Also, a constant value for the crossassociation volume was found, being 0.10 for the ethanol systems and 0.13 for the methanol systems. The use of this constant value and the linear correlation for the kj binary interaction parameter provides the CPA EoS with a predictive capability to model multicomponent systems containing these binaries.
In order to model the quaternary system composed by methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol + n-hexane [55] it was also necessary to describe the binary systems n-hexane + methanol and n-hexane + glycerol. For the binary system n-hexane + methyl oleate, the kj value was set to zero, as the cross-energy parameter between these components is expected to be well described solely by the geometric mean combining rule. Experimental data was available for the VLE and LLE of the methanol + n-hexane mixture [138-139], and with a low and temperature independent binary interaction parameter fitted to the mutual solubility data, of -0.00174, it was possible to provide a good description of LLE and to successfully predict the VLE, as can be seen in Figure 27.
With the binary interaction and cross-association parameters evaluated from binary equilibria data it is then possible to attempt modeling multicomponent systems. Starting with the methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol system, experimental tie-line data from different authors were available at four different temperatures [50-52].
Promising results for this system were initially found with the CPA EoS using the new association scheme proposed for glycerol and either using binary parameters set to zero or obtained from similar systems, and a kij for the methyl oleate + methanol fitted from the ternary data [27]. As seen in Figures 28 to and 30 improved results were obtained using the CPA EoS and the binary interaction parameters kij and 3j correlated from binary equilibrium data. The CPA EoS can correctly predict the immiscibility between glycerol and methyl oleate and the formation of a glycerol phase richer in alcohol than the ester phase. Higher deviations are obtained for the methyl oleate solubility in the glycerol-rich phase, but these were already expected, as these solubility values are typically small, in the order of 10" in mole fraction.

For the quaternary system methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol + n-hexane experimental data at 293.15 K were available from Tizvar et al. [55] and similar good results were also obtained when using the CPA EoS with the fa/s and figs correlated from binary data, as observed in Figure 31, where the predicted mole fractions are plotted versus the experimental mole fractions for both phases. It should be noticed that, as the authors of the experimental data state, the precision for the reported glycerol content on the methyl oleate rich phase was too low to allow the evaluation of models performance in predicting that data. Still, the plots of the two equilibrium phases in Figure 31, clearly illustrate the good performance of the proposed model for these biodiesel systems.

Predicted composition
Other systems of interest for the biodiesel industry are those constituted by a fatty acid ester, ethanol and glycerol. Saturation lines for methyl myristate/methyl stearate/methyl laurate + ethanol + glycerol systems were available at 303.15 K [53]. The approach described above for considering the kij’s and $/s poorly predicts these saturation lines, as seen in Figure 32, opposed to the good tie-line results presented before.

8.2.2.2.	Binary interaction parameters from multicomponent data
Another possible approach to consider binary interaction parameters and/or crossassociation parameters is to evaluate them directly from the ternary data. At Table 23 the binary interaction kij and the cross association flj parameters estimated when correlating the LLE data of the system methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol are presented. All data at all temperatures were considered for evaluating the kj’s and Pfs. Using these new temperature independent kfs and flfs, the model performance is enhanced, as noticed in Figures 28 to 30, specially for the glycerol rich phase in particular for the mole fraction of methyl oleate, that was not so well described using the binary interaction parameters
obtained from binary data.

Pij (methyl oleate + glycerol)	0.011
kij (glycerol + methanol)	-0.037

Pij (methyl oleate + methanol)	0.245
Using the same kifs and Pjs from Table 23, similar good results are obtained for the quaternary system, as can be seen in Figure 31.
As no tie-line data were available for the methyl myristate/methyl stearate/methyl laurate + ethanol + glycerol systems, it is more difficult to use these LLE ternary data to evaluate the binary interaction and cross-association parameters. Taking advantage of the predictive capacity of the model, the same parameter set obtained before from the tie line data of the system methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol were investigated, leaving only as an adjustable parameter the ester + ethanol kj parameter.
As can be seen from Figures 32 and 33, the interaction and cross-association binary parameters are easily transferable, as seen by the overall agreement between the experimental data and model calculations.

Other relevant systems are the ones derived from castor oil, one of the most important non-edible biodiesel feedstocks, widely available in Brazil and other regions, being methyl ricinoleate the major component of castor oil biodiesel (about 90 % of its composition [54]). As far as methyl ricinoleate + methanol + glycerol and methyl ricinoleate + ethanol + glycerol systems are concerned, experimental tie lines and saturation curves were only available from França et al. [54]. Starting with the methyl ricinoleate + methanol + glycerol system for which tie-line data were available at 298 K, the second approach used before was adopted, that is, the estimation of binary interaction parameters for all the three subsystems from the ternary LLE data. That decision was supported by the good results obtained for other systems by this method and the absence of binary data in literature for mixtures with methyl ricinoleate. Results for these ktjs are
presented at Table 24, and modeling results at Figure 34.

Several attempts were made to describe two other systems available in literature, constituted by fatty acid methyl esters, methanol and glycerol and by fatty acid ethyl esters, ethanol and glycerol, presented by Zhou et al. [133] and Liu and co-workers [134], respectively. None of the approaches presented before were able to satisfactorily correlate this data. However, and as already stated in other experimental papers, the data presented by Zhou et al. and Liu et al., are in total disagreement with other literature available experimental data [50-52]. Zhou et al. also stated that glycerol and methyl ester separation is temperature independent, results totally diverging from what Negi et al. [50], Andreatta
et al. [51] and Cerce et al. [52] concluded for the same temperature range.
The results presented here clearly demonstrate that the CPA EoS can be used to describe ternary and multicomponent systems containing glycerol and other transesterification products. This follows other good results presented before in this thesis for subsystems of interest for the biodiesel industry. As there is still a considerable lack of data for many of the binary subsystems, and even more ternary and multicomponent systems of interest, the results presented so far are expected to be improved when more (and accurate) data will become available.
8.2.3.	Modeling of multicomponent systems containing water
Considering water containing systems, taking advantage of the transferability of the CPA parameters, the estimated 3j’s while modeling the LLE of water + fatty acid ester systems and the VLE of ethanol + fatty acid ester systems, were applied for the description of the fatty acid ester + ethanol + water phase diagrams, being only the ethyl laurate/ethyl myristate + water and the ethyl laurate/ethyl myristate + ethanol interaction parameters, k/s, regressed from the ternary data.
The missing binary interaction parameter for the ethanol + water system was estimated using the available experimental data for the isobaric VLE of the ethanol + water system at atmospheric pressure [141].The kj value obtained provides a description of the experimental data with an average deviation of 0.1 % for the bubble temperature.
The same set of interaction and cross-association binary parameters, presented in Table 25, were use to model the LLE data at 298.15, 313.15 and 333.15 K.

The CPA description of the experimental phase diagrams at the various temperatures studied is reported in Figures 36 to 41. An excellent description of both the saturation curves and tie lines is obtained for both systems at all temperatures studied. The results here reported for water multicomponent systems are a very stringent test to the predictive capability of the CPA EoS and the transferability of its binary parameters. The quality of the results obtained show that when reliable data is available, parameters obtained from binary systems can be used with confidence for the estimation of ternary or high order systems. The capacity of a single set of parameters to describe the phase diagrams across a temperature range is also remarkable.
8.3.
Conclusions
For the glycerol containing systems, two approaches were used to estimate binary interaction and/or cross association parameters. The first, and more generalized approach that was considered here, was to use binary parameters estimated from experimental data of the corresponding binary subsystems. The second was to use multicomponent data for the regression of the binary model parameters. In order to apply the first approach, several binary systems were also successfully modeled here with the CPA EoS.
Different results are obtained depending on the set of binary interaction parameters chosen. The second approach seems to be the best one providing very good results for several systems such as methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol, methyl oleate + methanol + glycerol + n-hexane, methyl myristate/methyl stearate/methyl laurate + ethanol + glycerol, methyl ricinoleate + methanol + glycerol and methyl ricinoleate + ethanol + glycerol, although at the expense of an increased correlative character.
For water containing systems, binary cross-association and interaction parameters previously determined for the binary subsystems were used. Only for ethyl laurate and ethyl myristate binaries with water and ethanol these were correlated from the ternary data.
The CPA equation of state was once more found to give good correlation results and can safely extrapolate and even predict the liquid-liquid behavior of different complex ternary systems, using the same binary interaction and cross-association parameters.
9.	Prediction of near and supercritical fatty acid ester or glycerol + alcohol systems with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) Equation of State
9.1.
Introduction
Recently some work has been addressing the near/supercritical synthesis of biodiesel [18]. This process seems to have several advantages over the catalyzed approaches and could successfully overcome a number of the problems of conventional processes [19]. The issues related to catalyst removal, replacement and sensibility to fatty acids and water aren't a concern as no catalyst is used. Very good quality glycerol is produced and only a simple evaporation process of the excess amount of methanol is necessary to get fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) within specified characteristics. The conversion is high, being the free fatty acids in the oil esterified simultaneously with the tryglicerides, and the reaction duration is significantly shorter, only minutes, even with low-quality raw materials. Therefore, it requires a smaller reactor size to achieve the same production output of the conventional biodiesel production process [142].
Although the supercritical process requires high pressures and temperatures the advantages of a noncatalysed process may make it competitive with the existing alkali catalyzed processes, especially for the conversion of inferior quality raw resources, rich in free fatty acids and water, such as waste cooking oils [143-144]. Figure 42 shows the typical process of a biodiesel production by supercritical alcohol [143].
Figure 42. Typical biodiesel production process by supercritical alcohol [71].
For a rational design and operation of biodiesel production processes with supercritical alcohols it is essential to have quantitative and reliable information about the phase equilibria of mixtures containing alcohols, fatty acid esters and glycerol, near or above the critical temperature of the alcohol.
Shimoyama et al. [145-149] performed several vapor-liquid equilibria measurements for systems of interest for the biodiesel supercritical production process. Data have been reported for the vapor-liquid equilibria of methanol + methyl laurate and methanol + methyl myristate systems at 493-543 K [148], for the vapor-liquid equilibria of ethanol + ethyl laurate and ethanol + ethyl myristate systems at 493-543 K [147], for the vapor-liquid equilibria of methanol + glycerol and ethanol + glycerol systems at 493-573 K [146], and for the vapor-liquid equilibria of a methanol + FAMEs mixture at 523-573 K [149]. Only the works of Shimoyama et al. have been, up to now, focused on these kind of
high pressure binary systems.
The same authors correlated the reported data for methyl ester + methanol systems with the PRASOG model (Peng-Robinson equation of state with an EoS-gE mixing rule based on the ASOG model) [148]. The first attempt by these authors was to set the binary interaction parameters ly and ky to zero. For the higher temperatures those predictions diverged from the experimental data in the vapor and liquid phases. Improved results were obtained adjusting the l2y’s for each binary system using the provided experimental data at high pressures. Values for those parameters were found to be quite large and negative, in order to, as stated by the authors, include the contribution of the energy parameter and the very large differences of the molecular size between methanol and fatty acid methyl ester.
The data for ethyl ester + ethanol systems were modeled with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EoS) with two different mixing rules for the energy and size parameters, the van der Waals and the Wong-Sandler mixing rules, with different results obtained for the liquid and vapor phases [147]. The modified version of UNIFAC was applied to calculate the excess Gibbs free energy. With the two binary interaction parameters, kj and lj, correlated from the high-pressure experimental data, the van der Waals mixing rule provided the best results for the liquid phase, but the k/s used need to be temperature dependent. The Wong-Sandler mixing rule described better the vapor phase, however, requiring a temperature dependent and large binary interaction parameter, fitted from the provided experimental data.
For the glycerol systems the Peng-Robinson equation of state was used, adopting the van der Waals mixing rule and the PRASOG model [146]. Once more the van der Waals mixing rule better described the liquid phase data, using temperature dependent ky’s and j determined from the high-pressure experimental data. The EoS-gE mixing rule provided a better description of the vapor phase, with no fitting parameters used.
The methanol + FAMEs mixture was also successfully correlated with the PR-EoS and the van der Waals mixing rule [149]. The mixture was considered to be a pseudobinary system and, in the same way as described above, the two binary interaction parameters were correlated from the experimental data, being the ky’s temperature dependent.
Shimoyama et al. have also attempted at correlating the experimental data using a combination of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state with the Wong-Sandler (WS) mixing rules, using both the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) and the UNIFAC models [145]. Predictions for the liquid phase by SRK/WS/COSMO-SAC reproduced the experimental data more accurately than calculations made with SRK/WS/UNIFAC.
The results summarized above indicate that cubic equations of state with complex gE mixing rules provide the best results for the description of the vapor phase of ester + alcohol systems, in a broad range of temperatures and pressures. However, it is necessary to include temperature dependent binary interaction parameters that have to be correlated from experimental data due to the limited prediction capability of those approaches. On the other hand, the liquid phase description is poorer than the one provided by the conventional van der Waals mixing rules. In conclusion, there isn't a single model able to simultaneously describe the liquid and vapor phases of these systems.
To overcome the use of empirical corrections to cubic EoSs or gE mixing rules, the breakthrough in the modeling of polar and highly non ideal systems came with the development of more rigorous explicit association models.
Hegel et al. [150-151] applied the Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EoS) to describe the phase equilibria involved in the supercritical methanolysis of vegetable oils. The use of this group contribution approach can be considered to be quite demanding while dealing with the amount of necessary regressed parameters and with the calculation of the association contributions for multiple associating groups.
NguyenHuynh et al. [152] used the GC-SAFT approach to describe small ester + 1-alkanol systems (from ethanol to butanol), with reasonable results obtained when considering the cross-association interaction between esters and alkanols. Grenner et al. [153] described the vapor-liquid equilibria at moderate conditions of several systems including small ester + alcohol mixtures in order to compare the accuracy of two association models. A lattice model that explicitly accounts for hydrogen bonding, the nonrandom hydrogen bonding (NRHB) theory, and the PC-SAFT equation were
considered. Results show that none of the models is overall superior to the other.
None of these models that are theoretically sound approaches to the description of polar systems have been applied to the description of the phase equilibria of fatty acid ester + alcohol systems at high temperatures and pressures.
The results presented in the previous chapters are relevant for the work developed here. It was shown that the CPA EoS can accurately describe the solvation interaction between the ester and the alcohol group, through a solvation scheme for the cross association energy and volume. In addition, the binary interaction parameters, kij’s, are shown to follow a linear trend with the ester carbon number when a single crossassociation volume, /3ij, is used. Also, a new association scheme for glycerol along with small and temperature independent binary interaction parameters provided a very good description of glycerol systems.
Those binary interaction parameters are used in this work to evaluate the predictive character of the model in the description of the systems composed of an ester and an alcohol or glycerol and an alcohol, at high temperatures and pressures, not yet attempted in the previous chapters.
It will be shown that the CPA EoS is able to successfully predict the experimental data, proving a reliable model for the phase behavior of systems for which no experimental data is available, even at conditions far removed from those used in the estimation of the model parameters.
9.2.
Results and Discussion
9.2.1.	Predictions of high pressure Vapor—Liquid Equilibria
Alcohol + fatty acid ester mixtures are not easy to model due to their differences in size and intermolecular interactions.
As discussed in Chapter 7, using experimental data for the atmospheric pressure VLE of binary systems composed of esters (such as methyl laurate, methyl myristate and methyl oleate) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol), the performance of the CPA EoS in the description of these phase equilibria was studied. The cross-association between the ester group and the hydroxyl group was considered using the solvation scheme described before with the value for the cross-association volume, /3y, being only alcohol dependent, and a linear correlation for the binary interaction parameter, kij, with the ester carbon number being also proposed.
In this chapter, this predictive character of the CPA EoS model is evaluated, by using the atmospheric pressure estimated binary interaction parameters to describe the phase equilibria at high pressures and temperatures.
Starting with the ester + alcohol systems, high pressure and high temperature vapor-liquid equilibria data were available for the systems methanol + methyl laurate / methyl myristate [148], ethanol + ethyl laurate / ethyl myristate [147] and methanol + FAMEs [149].
The first systems studied were those with methanol, in particular the mixture containing methyl laurate.
An acceptable prediction of the liquid and vapor phase compositions was initially achieved, but a degradation of the predictions with temperature was nevertheless observed (Figure 43).

In order to obtain a better description of the liquid and vapor phases at near critical conditions, the methanol CPA parameters were re-estimated closer to the critical point, in the Tr range of 0.85-1. A new set of parameters for methanol that provided a better description of the critical region is here proposed and reported in Table 26.

The superior deviations observed in the liquid phase at low temperatures are probably related to the uncertainty of the experimental data. Nevertheless, the differences between experimental and CPA calculated values are lower than the reported experimental uncertainties for the liquid phase.
For the ethanol systems there was no need to re-estimate the ethanol CPA pure compound parameters, as they can successfully predict the high temperature region.
A good prediction of the liquid phase for fatty acid ester (ethyl laurate / ethyl myristate) + ethanol systems was also accomplished (Figures 44 and 45 and Table 27). The vapor phase description is worse than for methanol systems. This may be related to the difficulty in taking into account the dispersive interactions due to the additional methyl group of alcohols and fatty acid esters, or to the quality of the experimental data for the
vapor phase, as no other data is available for these systems.
Considering all binary systems containing a fatty acid ester and an alcohol, global average deviations, AAD %, inferior to 2 % were obtained for the alcohol compositions in both liquid and vapor phases, in the temperature and pressure ranges studied.
Shimoyama et al. [147] while correlating ethanol systems using the van der Waals and the Wong-Sandler mixing rules, with temperature dependent binary interaction parameters, reported an average deviation from the experimental data (given by the difference between the calculated and experimental ethanol compositions) of less than 0.02 for the liquid and vapor phases. For methanol systems no deviations between the experimental and the correlated results were reported.
The CPA EoS can predict the vapor-liquid equilibrium of ethanol systems with deviations inferior to 0.04 for both liquid and vapor phases, showing that there is no major advantage in increasing the complexity of equations of state through the use of gE mixing rules or temperature dependent binary interaction parameters. Excellent predictions can be achieved being only necessary a single binary interaction parameter for the physical part, that can be obtained from existing correlations developed at atmospheric pressure.
Experimental data were also available for methanol/ethanol + glycerol systems at high pressures [146]. Once more, the 3*2B association scheme for glycerol and binary interaction parameters estimated from atmospheric pressure vapor-liquid equilibria were applied for high pressure predictions. The predictions reported in Figure 46 and Table 27 present a good description of the experimental data, although with a slightly higher deviation when compared with the fatty acid ester + alcohol systems studied before.
Comparing the experimental and the predictive high pressure results it can be seen that for the glycerol + methanol system, the CPA results show a negative deviation from Raoult's law, whereas the experimental results reveal a positive deviation from Raoult's law. The inverse is shown for the glycerol + ethanol system.

As seen in Figure 47, where the activity coefficients for methanol/ethanol + glycerol systems are presented as a function of the alcohol composition, calculated from the atmospheric pressure experimental data [27], considering that activity coefficients for the methanol + glycerol system are lower or very close to unity, and for ethanol + glycerol are considerably higher than one, the above described deviations from the Raoult's law proposed by the CPA EoS are more likely to be correct than the experimental ones. In that way, while evaluating the model results it must be considered the somewhat low quality of the experimental results.

Figure 47. Activity coefficients for methanol/ethanol + glycerol systems vs alcohol composition.
Although not usually successfully applied to alcohol containing systems, the proximity of the glycerol + methanol activity coefficients to unity (Figure 47) can explain the success of the van der Waals mixing rule in correlating this mixture.
The very last test to the predictive character of the model was evaluated through the modeling of the vapor-liquid equilibria of the methanol + FAMEs multicomponent mixture (85 wt% of C18 methyl esters (mainly methyl oleate) and the rest made of C16 and C14 methyl esters). The linear correlation with the ester carbon number was once more applied to generate the required binary interaction parameters. Good predictions were achieved for the three selected temperatures, as shown in Figure 48, with global average deviations, AAD %, for the methanol composition inferior to 1 % for the vapor phase and to 3 % for the liquid phase, Table 27. It should be recalled that the PR-EoS with the van der Waals mixing rule was only able to satisfactorily describe the vapor-liquid equilibria of the methanol + FAMEs mixture considering the system to be a pseudo binary and optimizing temperature dependent binary interaction parameters from the experimental data [149].

The results here reported show the importance of using an adequate contribution to take into account the polar interactions between esters and alcohols, as it is with the CPA EoS through the Wertheim association term, making possible to successfully predict the vapor-liquid equilibria of ester + alcohol/systems, in a large range of pressures and temperatures.
9.3.	Conclusions
In this work the Cubic-Plus-Association EoS was used to predict the vapor-liquid equilibria of several fatty acid ester + ethanol or methanol and of glycerol + ethanol or methanol systems, at near/supercritical conditions.
A single and temperature independent binary interaction parameter (in the physical term) and a constant value for the cross association volume in the case of fatty acid ester + alcohol systems, fitted to experimental VLE data at atmospheric pressure, were used to predict the experimental data. It was shown that it is possible to accurately predict the
The CPA EoS proves to be a valuable alternative to the demanding EoS/gE models, typically employed for high pressure phase equilibria calculations, to evaluate the design, operation and optimization of biodiesel production facilities using supercritical conditions since it can successfully predict the phase equilibria observed on these processes.
10.	Surface tension of esters through a combination of the gradient theory with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) Equation of State
10.1.	Introduction
Considering the handling of biodiesel, surface tension is one of its physical properties that affects the design of some of the purification processes and the fuel performance. Surface tension controls the formation of oil drops that determine the fuel atomization on the engine combustion chamber. A higher surface tension disables the formation of small droplets from the liquid fuel [155]. For those reasons surface tension is one of the properties to be taken into consideration while investigating different injection systems [156].
However, the available experimental data for biodiesels surface tension in literature is still very scarce, especially data accounting for their temperature dependence. Generally, data are only available at one single temperature.
There are many approaches for computing the surface tensions of simple fluids and mixtures. The most basic approach is the parachor method [157] and its derivatives. Allen et al. suggested an empirical correlation based on the parachor method that is commonly used to compute surface tensions of biodiesels from their fatty acid composition [156, 158159].
Shu et al. [160] proposed a topological index that uses a combination of the distance matrix and adjacency matrix of the molecular structure to predict the surface tension of a biodiesel fuel from the molecular structure of its fatty acid methyl ester components.
The corresponding-states principle [161-162] and other thermodynamic correlations [163-165] are alternative approaches to the description of surface/interfacial tensions. Some more complex theories also take into account the density gradients in the interface like the perturbation theory [166] integral and density functional theories [167-170] or the
gradient theory of fluid interfaces [171-172]. A generalized version of a corresponding states model for pure fluids and mixtures had also been developed, using a simple cubic EoS as a reference EoS, allowing an excellent representation of the surface tension of several pure alkanes and their mixtures with water [173]. Panayiotou [174] extended the QCHB (quasi-chemical hydrogen-bonding) equation-of-state model to interfaces obtaining a satisfactory agreement between experimental and calculated surface tensions of pure fluids. The density functional theory (DFT) can also be used for the prediction of surface tensions [175].
The gradient theory of fluid interfaces has its origin in the work of van der Waals [171] and was reformulated by Cahn and Hilliard [172]. This theory converts the statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous fluids into a non-linear boundary value problem that can be solved to compute the density and the stress distributions in the interface. In the reformulation made by Cahn and Hilliard, the surface/interfacial tension can be calculated by a theory that describes a continuous evolution of the Helmholtz energy along the interface. The physical consistency of this approach was confirmed by the regular solution theory for qualitatively describing the properties of planar interfaces [172].
One of the gradient theory inputs is the Helmhotz free energy density that can be computed by any thermodynamic model, such as an equation of state. The likely advantage of this approach is that simultaneous modeling of interfacial tensions and phase equilibria is possible.
Accurate estimates of surface tensions for short-chain, non-polar fluids were previously achieved through standard cubic EoSs with quadratic mixing rules. The Peng-Robinson EoS and the SRK EoS were used with success to describe the interfacial properties of simple mixtures containing just hydrocarbons [176-181].
Some problems related with the well known deficiencies of cubic EoS for describing the liquid phase densities of longer chain molecules where corrected by Miqueu et al. using a volume translation [179, 182-183]. However, unphysical results are still obtained for systems containing polar and/or associating compounds [184]. For these systems it is necessary either to employ advanced mixing rules, such as the Wong-Sandler or the modified Huron-Vidal mixing rules, as previously done by Mejia et al. [185-186] or,
Panayiotou combined the gradient theory of fluid interfaces with the QCHB equation-of-state model to compute surface tensions. The results obtained were rather satisfactory for pure fluids and for mixtures of non polar or weakly polar fluids, and in qualitative agreement with the experimental data for associating mixtures [174, 188].
Another approach to describe interfacial properties of polar mixtures is to use the Statistical Association Fluid Theory (SAFT). The studies performed by Kahl. et al. [184] and more recently by Fu [189] showed that the SAFT EoS for alcohols leads to satisfactory results.
Kahl et al. [184] demonstrated that the prediction of water surface tension depends on the number of association sites and so, the association model used must be selected very carefully. Significant problems were also detected for polar compounds in the critical region. In addition, it was found that the SAFT-EoS gives at lower temperatures better surface tension modeling results than the APACT-EoS, whereas at higher temperatures, the APACT-EoS is superior to the SAFT-EoS.
Queimada et al. [190] attempted to combine the gradient theory with the CPA EoS to describe hydrocarbon, ethanol and water liquid-vapor interfaces, with very good results. Oliveira et al. [96] successfully extended that approach to the modeling of the surface tensions of the homologue families of n-alkanes (C2-C36), n-fluoroalkanes (C3-C9) and n-alkanols (C1-C20), and to the prediction of vapor-liquid interfacial tensions of five mixtures (methane + pentane, ethane + nonane, methanol + ethanol, octane + heptanol and octane + octanol) with very good results.
It will be here shown that the coupling of the Gradient theory with the CPA EoS can also be applied to describe the surface tensions of 7 methyl esters, 4 ethyl esters, 2 propyl esters, 4 butyl esters, 10 acetates, 10 formates, and of two unsaturated methyl esters, as a
function of temperature.
10.2.	The gradient theory
The gradient theory is based on the phase equilibria of the fluid phases separated by an interface, generalized for multicomponent mixtures by Miqueu et al. [179, 183, 190191].

To use the gradient theory, it is necessary to determine the equilibrium densities of the coexisting phases, the chemical potentials and the Helmholtz free energy using an adequate model. In this chapter, the CPA equation of state will be used for these purposes.
10.3.	Results and discussion
The pure component data was collected from the available literature data [95, 192194], for 7 methyl esters, 4 ethyl esters, 2 propyl esters, 4 butyl esters and also for 10 acetates and 1o formates, and two unsaturated methyl esters.
As mentioned before, the pure-component influence parameter, c.., has a theoretical
definition, but that can hardly be implemented for the majority of the systems, since the necessary direct correlation function is frequently unavailable [191]. For practical purposes, the influence parameter is adjusted from surface tension data and plotted (far from the critical point), using the energy and the co-volume parameters of the physical part of the CPA EoS, as c/ab as a function of 1-Tr, as already done in previous works [177, 183, 190].
In a previous paper, Queimada et al. [190] studied, for n-heptane, the effect of the cubic term on the change of c/ab with reduced temperature. It was found that at Tr &amp;lt;0.8 both SRK, PR and CPA gave similar values, but that at higher temperatures the values from the equations of state whose parameters were calculated from critical properties (SRK and PR) diverged while approaching the critical temperature (as expected from theory), whereas CPA c/ab values converge. As mentioned in that work, this is due to the fact that while using fitted parameters, CPA cannot adequately describe the critical temperature, which is implicit in the calculation of the influence parameters through the dependence of surface tension on temperature, (that shall be zero at Tc).
Previous approaches combining the density gradient theory with different versions of the SAFT EoS considered the influence parameter either as temperature independent [184] or temperature dependent [189] while studies with cubic EoS revealed that a linear dependence in reduced temperature would be more adequate [179, 183]. A recent work also proposed a correlation for the influence parameter which was generalized as a function of the critical compressibility factor, the acentric factor, the reduced dipole moment and the reduced temperature [195].
In a previous work, the coupling of the CPA EoS with the gradient theory was used for an accurate description of the surface tension of a series of n-alkanes, n-alcohols, and perfluoralkanes [96]. It was showed that some of the components presented variations of c/ab that were typically quadratic with (1-Tr), other linear, and other almost constant, which in some cases can be explained by the limited reduced temperature range of surface tension data available to correlate the influence parameters and their accuracy, especially for the heavier members of the series. A quadratic correlation was therefore proposed for the variation of the influence parameter with reduced temperature (Eq. 55):
c
ab
2/3
For esters, at first, the quadratic variation of the influence parameter was proposed within the reduced temperatures of 0.45 to 0.85. With that approach surface tensions were computed with global average deviations of 0.9 %.
However, the influence parameter dependency with temperature appears to be linear up to about Tr = 0.70. Taking into account these results, a linear approach was then considered, resulting in only two parameters to be correlated (Eq. 55). That approach was already previously done by Miqueu et al. [182], which correctly justified it by saying that if equations of state are incapable of describing the behavior of fluid phases in the vicinity of critical points, there is no point in predicting surface tensions near the critical point. Global average deviations of only 1.3% were achieved, as seen in Tables 28 and 29. Results are depicted in Figure 49.
Plotting the resulting parameters with the acentric factor, Figure 50, it is possible to see that these parameters don't vary significantly, and so, average values were obtained for D and E. As expected, higher deviations are obtained for the surface tensions, but still, deviations are lower than 5%, which it is extremely promising for prediction purposes.

Unfortunately not many data are available for heavier esters typically present in biodiesel composition, as well as for biodiesel mixtures. The gradient theory modeling of such mixtures is considerable more difficult than for pure compounds, as density profiles have to be calculated at each discrete point of the dividing interface limited by the upper and lower phase densities [183]. Such evaluation is expected to be performed as more experimental data becomes available.
10.4.	Conclusions
In this chapter the coupling of the density gradient theory with the CPA EoS was applied to the description of the surface tensions of the ester family. The CPA EoS, with no need to perform any volume correction, as the parameters of the EoS were fitted on saturation pressures and liquid density data, and the gradient theory with a linear correlation of the influence parameter in Tr allowed very accurate estimations of surface tensions, with global average errors of 1.3 % in the 0.45 &amp;lt;Tr &amp;lt;0.70 range.
The broad surface tension database that was evaluated in this work (for 7 methyl esters, 4 ethyl esters, 2 propyl esters, 4 butyl esters, 10 acetates, 10 formates and also for two unsaturated methyl esters) ensures that the proposed model can adequately be used for modeling esters surface tensions in a wide temperature range. In addition, the gradient theory can be used as predictive method allowing estimations of the surface tensions with very good agreement with the available experimental data using constant parameters for the linear temperature dependence of the influence parameter.
11.	General Conclusions
Initially, a throughout comparison of the performance of cubic Eos, gE, and EoS-gE models was made. It became clear that it was necessary to develop a model able to combine accuracy, predictivity and simplicity.
For that purpose, the CPA EoS (Cubic - Plus - Association Equation of State) was applied to describe the phase equilibria of several binary and multicomponent systems of relevance for the biodiesel production and purification process.
Results for the LLE and SLE of water + fatty acid systems, the water solubility in fatty acid methyl esters and biodiesels, the VLE of glycerol + alcohol and glycerol + water systems, the VLE of ester + methanol and ester + ethanol and the LLE of multicomponent mixtures containing alcohols, glycerol, water and fatty acid esters, in the temperature range of operation of the separation units in biodiesel plants, were investigated.
The chosen thermodynamic model demonstrates to be capable of correctly describing those highly polar and non ideal systems, using typically no more than two and small temperature independent binary parameters.
The addition of an associating term to the SRK cubic equation of state proves to be a significant improvement, making possible to accurately describe all the association phenomena between associating molecules and the solvation between non-self-associating and associating compounds.
In addition, the coupling of the density gradient theory with the CPA EoS was applied for an accurate estimation of the surface tensions of the ester family.
The CPA EoS predictive character was also proved to be of great value showing to be an adequate model to compute phase equilibria and interfacial properties when no experimental data is available.
More specifically, further modeling of the LLE of fatty acid esters + alcohol + glycerol or water containing systems may be performed as new and reliable experimental data becomes available.
Additionally, and following the same issue of lack of data, oil systems were not addressed in this thesis. Although some liquid density data of triglycerides may be found in the literature, vapor pressures of triglycerides are very scarce and some predictive models provide considerably different results for this property. So, the regression and correlation of the pure component equation of state parameters for triglycerides is thus an issue to solve, with the final aim of modeling equilibrium data for binary and multicomponent systems composed by vegetable oils.
Having already studied and established correlations for the influence parameters for calculating pure component esters surface tensions, surface and interfacial tensions of biodiesels and heterogeneous process mixtures are expected to be modeled as soon as new experimental data as a function of temperature appear in literature.
Finally the presence of electrolytes was also not yet considered in this thesis. CPA can still be combined with a Debye-Huckel term, able to deal with the presence of electrolytes, allowing to correctly model the thermodynamics of systems containing the alkaline catalysis. Unfortunately, the increased model complexity requires some further experimental data, as well as an additional amount of time that would go considerably beyond the timeline for this thesis.
