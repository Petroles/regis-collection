Acknowledgements 

First of all, I would like to thank my external supervisor at the Molecular Microbial 

Ecology Group of the University of Copenhagen, Doctor Martin Asser Hansen, who, 

undoubtedly, was the person that contributed the most for the success of this project. 

He taught me some things but, most importantly, he pushed me to learn by myself 

everything else. He was a source of inspiration and support, and the hours of patient 

discussion were invaluable. Moreover, he introduced me to the group, and made me 

feel welcome since day one. I feel extremely happy that I got the opportunity to have 

him as a supervisor. 

Secondly, I would like to thank my supervisor at the Faculty of Science of the University 

of Lisbon, Professor Francisco Couto, for accepting to supervise me and checking 

regularly if my work was progressing. I’d also like to thank him for allowing me to do a 

short collaboration within the project EPIWORK, which set the ground for my research 

career. 

I should thank Professor Søren Sørensen for having me in his group, and Assistant 

Professor Waleed Abu Al-Soud for integrating me in this project. In addition, I want to 

thank Associate Professor Lars H. Hansen for the times when I needed some direction, 

and he immediately engaged in a session of brainstorming, as well as Lea Skov 

Hansen who never failed to help me when I asked. Also, I’d like to state my sincere 

gratitude to the Associate Professor Emeritus Annelise Kjøller for reviewing the 

manuscript. 

But since work is not just about working, I want to thank the people at MME who made 

my working hours and coffee-breaks, enjoyable ones. Working in such a great 

atmosphere was a wonderful experience! I want to thank specially Tue, Lea, Analia, 

Stefan, Michael, Peter, Lars B. and Witold. 

I also want to thank my roommates Chris and Emil for all the fun and hyggeligt times. 

I shall also thank all of my friends and family in Portugal who have always been 

present, supporting me, giving me love and care, and reminding me every day that 

distance meant simply a plane ride…nothing else. 

However, there were some people who had a direct effect on the turnover of this 

thesis, and therefore I feel their names should be clearly stated. First of all, Gil for 

keeping me company every day; for sharing the tiny details of our days; for discussing 



   

ii 
 

silly and more serious thoughts. Ricardo Purificação for bugging me the whole year to 

write the Introduction. Carolina, Mogli, Anas and João for maintaining my insanity, with 

our group conversation that is about…(What is it about?) And finally, Natalia Ci?ciwa 

and Pascaline Serra for keeping track of me all these months...for the love they shared 

with me, for their friendship, for not giving up.   

Most of all, I want to thank Inês and Luísa. For they made me feel home in the cold 

kingdoms of the north: they took care of me, they gave me colo, they told me I would 

be alright. They became those people that I want to be around when I’m sad; or when 

I’m happy! They became special to me…. Somehow, these two girls overcame the 

barrier that I had in me when I arrived in Copenhagen, and found their way to my heart. 

So…if to write a thesis you need a certain state of mind, a certain focus, a certain 

equilibrium, they were certainly the people that made sure during this year that I had 

them. And as Luísa said in the airport, when we were running for the security, there are 

certain people in life that you don’t need to know for too long, to know that they are 

going to stay in your life for a long time.  

Finally, I would like to thank the NSF, the Moore Foundation and the European 

BIOTRIANGLE project for supporting the Course on Marine Bioinformatics "Marine 

Omics” at the University of Delaware, to which I was fortunately selected to go, and 

that was definitely a turning point for the writing of this dissertation.  

 

This work is dedicated to my brother Filipe, to my Avó Fernanda and to my parents.  

But mainly to my parents, since without them, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to go 

to Denmark in first place. And they keep arguing that they are doing what they are 

supposed to, but they are not – they are doing more, and they should know that I am 

extremely grateful, that I am not forgetting what they are giving me, and that I love 

them.

Resumo 

O “Challenger Deep” na Fossa das Marianas é um dos ambientes mais extremos à 

face da Terra. A combinação da baixa temperatura de 2.5ºC, e a pressão de quase 

112MPa, devido à coluna de água de 11km, tornam-no único, e sujeito à curiosidade 

humana por esse facto. Contudo, os métodos tradicionais de cultura microbiana em 

laboratório tornavam muito difícil obter uma visão completa da comunidade que habita 

esse ambiente, uma vez que nem todos os microorganismos são passíveis de ser 

cultivados, nem as condições extremas simples de ser recriadas.  

Em 1998, Jo Handeslman cunhou o termo “Metagenómica”, ao tentar estudar a 

microflora como um todo, em vez de estudar organismos individuais, denominando-o 

assim de metagenoma. Desde aí que a Metagenómica evoluiu, passando a englobar a 

identificação de sequências genómicas duma comunidade, bem como a sua análise 

funcional e evolutiva. 

A análise metagenómica tipicamente inclui vários passos que começam na 

amostragem, seguindo-se a filtração (embora esta seja facultativa, dependendo do 

objectivo do estudo), a sequenciação, até à análise das sequências e publicação dos 

dados gerados. Este trabalho lidou exclusivamente com os dois últimos passos.  

O objectivo do trabalho foi, não só gerar mais questões, como é habitual em análises 

metagenómicas, mas também investigar que comunidade habita este ambiente, e 

explorar um pouco o seu potencial metabólico. Contudo, com a publicação de um 

estudo que descreve as mesmas amostras, surgiu o objectivo de explorar os 

resultados no sentido de corroborar a descoberta de que há consumo de oxigénio ao 

longo do sedimento. 

A análise seguiu os moldes normalmente usados em trabalhos semelhantes. De 8 

amostras iniciais, correspondendo a intervalos de 5cm da superfície até 40cm de 

profundidade do sedimento, 7 foram sequenciadas. Inicialmente, as sequências foram 

automaticamente pré-processadas de forma a que apenas a informação relevante e 

fidedigna passasse à fase seguinte. Nomeadamente, removeram-se os adaptadores 

utilizados na sequenciação, bem como sequências demasiado curtas, e bases de má 

qualidade. Para isto, foi utilizada a colecção de ferramentas “Biopieces”, que permite 

organizar os comandos numa pipeline de uma forma simples e intuitiva. 

Seguidamente, as sequências foram sujeitas a assemblagem, utilizando o programa 

IDBA-UD, de forma a gerar sequências mais longas, para serem anotadas com maior 



   

vi 
 

percentagem de identidade, e consequentemente, com maior confiança. Mais uma 

vez, este passo é facultativo, uma vez que ao assemblar sequências perde-se 

informação relativamente à abundância. Antes da anotação, as sequências foram 

classificadas de codificantes ou não codificantes, e as primeiras foram então 

mapeadas contra sequências conhecidas em bases de dados. A anotação foi feita em 

termos taxonómicos e funcionais.  Todos os passos que se seguiram à assemblagem 

foram realizados pelo servidor MG-RAST, no entanto, tanto sequências assembladas 

(“contigs”) como não-assembladas (“reads”) foram submetidas, para haver informação 

relativamente à abundância, mas também informação sólida relativamente a 

determinadas características de interesse. 

Os resultados gerados pelo MG-RAST mostram claramente que Betaproteobacteria 

domina a amostra de superfície (0-5cm), enquanto que nas restantes amostras é a 

classe Gammaproteobacteria a mais abundante. É interessante observar que 

enquanto que Gammaproteobacteria nas amostras 1 (0-5cm) e 2 (5-10cm) é dominada 

por um género, da amostra 3 (10-15cm) à 8 (35-40cm) o número de géneros 

abundantes aumenta. Em termos de diversidade-alfa, a amostra 1 apresenta o valor 

mais elevado (430.83 espécies), em comparação com as outras que variam entre 

184.10 e 252.14 espécies. A diversidade-beta foi calculada entre todas as amostras, 

usando o pacote “vegan” da linguagem de programação estatística R. Especulou-se 

que poderia haver uma correlação entre esta e a profundidade, mas tal não se 

verificou. Para averiguar se haveria alguma relação entre a profundidade do sedimento 

e a composição da comunidade, utilizou-se a análise de componentes principais 

(PcoA).  Estes resultados não permitiram a confirmação da hipótese, no entanto, ao 

comparar com amostras de outros projectos bastante diferentes, as amostras da 

Fossa das Marianas agruparam-se de modo consistente, mostrando que a 

composição da comunidade é característica deste ambiente. Além disto, gerou-se uma 

curva de rarefacção, que é utilizada para verificar se o esforço de sequenciação foi 

suficiente para representar a comunidade por inteiro, e dado que as curvas das 7 

amostras estão a chegar perto da assímptota, pôde-se concluir que os resultados são 

razoáveis. 

Em termos funcionais, a análise focou-se no metabolismo energético. A maior parte 

das sequências “reads” deste metabolismo mapeavam para fosforilação oxidativa, que 

é o último passo da respiração aeróbia. Analisando as sequências “contigs” que 

mapeavam para o mesmo, verificou-se que existia mais de 91% de identidade contra 

sequências na base de dados escolhida, o que indica que os resultados são credíveis.  



 

vii 
 

O metabolismo do metano e do azoto foram também investigados e, apesar de menos 

abundantes, algumas enzimas envolvidas na metanogénese e no ciclo do azoto foram 

identificadas nas sequências “contigs”. 

Finalmente, gerou-se um mapa geral com todas as enzimas identificadas nas 

amostras, utilizando o programa iPath que se baseia nos mapas metabólicos KEGG. É 

de notar, todavia, que este mapeamento pode ser erróneo, como se constatou quando 

se observou que a fotossíntese estava indicada como presente, o que é altamente 

improvável a 11km de profundidade. Quando se investigou porquê, descobriu-se que 

era devido a uma ATPase que está presente tanto na fotossíntese como na 

fosforilação oxidativa. 

Os resultados gerados, permitem concluir que efectivamente o consumo de oxigénio, 

medido no estudo efectuado por colaboradores, se deve a metabolismo aeróbio 

mesmo nas camadas de sedimento mais profundas. Esse estudo também previu que 

os processos de mineralização acentuados neste ambiente fossem mediados pela 

comunidade microbiana, o que se coaduna com a presença de enzimas envolvidas no 

ciclo do azoto. A dominância de Gammaproteobacteria é partilhada por sedimentos no 

Oceano Pacífico a 4000m de profundidade, bem como sedimentos no Oceano Pacífico 

Ártico, que se encontra igualmente a baixas temperaturas. Curiosamente, a microflora 

de fontes hidrotermais em profundidade, a mais de 310ºC também são dominadas por 

Gammaproteobacteria. 

Este estudo mostrou que é possível investigar em detalhe a composição da 

comunidade bacteriana de ambientes extremos. Contudo, este trabalho poderia ter 

sido mais robusto se houvesse réplicas das unidades amostrais, e mais dados 

contextuais que permitissem fazer comparações com outros estudos.  No futuro, seria 

também interessante tirar amostras a diversas profundidades do “Challenger Deep” de 

forma a estudar a variação da composição da comunidade com a profundidade.  

Uma vez que esta área é ainda bastante jovem, a colecção de ferramentas disponíveis 

apesar de vasta, ainda está sujeita a melhoramentos. Desta forma, os resultados aqui 

apresentados poder-se-ão revelar imprecisos daqui a 10 anos. Também é provável 

que uma escolha alternativa não produzisse exactamente os mesmos resultados. 

Assim, o produto deste trabalho é fruto da escolha das ferramentas e dos seus 

parâmetros, com todas as vantagens e incovenientes que lhes são inerentes.

Abstract 

The emergence of Metagenomics allowed the study of the microbial community in the 

deepest point on Earth: the Challenger Deep on the Mariana Trench. Its extreme 

conditions, a water depth of almost 11km, a temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius and a 

pressure around 112 MPa, made it very difficult to perform a comprehensive study of 

its microecology, given the previous dependency on culturing methods. This 

metagenomic analysis included taxonomic identification and exploration of some 

functional potential of the genomic sequences of the community, generated by Illumina 

Next-Generation Sequencing technique, therefore bypassing the need for cloning. Here 

we show that Proteobacteria clearly dominate this environment but that there is no 

obvious correlation between the sediment depth and the community composition. 

Moreover, the abundance of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in all 

samples, suggests aerobic activity within the sediment. This supports the finding that 

there is oxygen consumption along the depth of the sediment. An extensive description 

of all the data generated was prohibitive; however as soon as the data becomes 

available, it will be accessible to the public to search for their features of interest.

O aparecimento da Metagenómica permitiu o estudo da comunidade microbiana no 

ponto mais profundo na Terra: o “Challenger Deep” na Fossa das Marianas. As 

condições extremas aí presentes - a coluna de água de quase 11km, 2.5ºC de 

temperatura e a pressão à volta de 112MPa - tornaram um estudo aprofundado da sua 

microecologia muito difícil de executar, dada a prévia dependência em métodos que 

envolviam culturas em laboratório. Esta análise metagenómica incluiu identificação 

taxonómica e a pesquisa do potencial funcional das sequências genómicas da 

comunidade, geradas utilizando a tecnologia de nova geração de sequenciação da 

Illumina, ultrapassando assim a necessidade de clonagem. Neste trabalho demonstra-

se que Proteobacteria domina claramente este habitat, mas que não há uma 

correlação inequívoca entre a profundidade do sedimento e a composição da

comunidade. Além disso, a abundância de enzimas envolvidas na oxidação 

fosforilativa em todas as amostras, sugere actividade aeróbia no sedimento. Isto 

sustenta a descoberta de que há consumo de oxigénio ao longo da profundidade do 

sedimento. Uma descrição extensa de todos os dados que foram gerados era 

proibitivo, no entanto, assim que os dados se tornarem públicos, serão acessíveis a 

todos os que os queiram investigar consoante os seus interesses.

Introduction

1. Introduction 

1.1. Background 

The Challenger Deep on the Mariana Trench is one of the most extreme environments 

on Earth, with a depth of almost 11km, a temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius[1] and a 

pressure around 111.79 MPa – calculated assuming the mean density of sea water 

1036 kg/m
3
[2]  and the gravity to be 9,81 m/s

2
[3]. It is located roughly at 11ºN 22.1’N 

142º 25.8’ E [1](Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1 - Challenger Deep location (11º 22.1'N 142º 25.8' E) 

 

It has been subject to human curiosity for many years[4], however so far, there wasn't a 

detailed study of its microecology. With the emergence of Metagenomics, it was now 

finally possible to unravel which organisms live in the deepest point on Earth, and what 

are they doing. 

It was in 1998 that the term "Metagenomics" was first used by Jo Handeslman [5] in an 

effort to study the microflora as a unit, the metagenome, instead of addressing each 

type of organism individually.  

Previously, it was thought that it was necessary to study the morphology, physiology 

and pathogenic characters in order to classify a microorganism[6], but since Woese in 



Introduction 

   

2 
 

1977 pioneered the use of 16S sequences for classification[7], sequence comparison 

has been widely used and accepted as valid to do so.  

With the development of the sequencing technology, one can now take a sample 

directly from the environment, extract its DNA, sequence it, and infer the microbial 

composition of the sample, therefore overcoming the bottleneck of growing pure 

cultures in the laboratory. This method enables the discovery of new forms of life that 

are not cultivable, and to assess the genetic richness and diversity, as well as the 

metabolic potential, of a community of organisms as a whole[8]. 

Metagenomic analysis can accordingly be defined as “the identification, and functional 

and evolutionary analysis of the genomic sequences of a community of organisms”.[9]  

Moreover, the paradigm that most of the microbial world was known changed, to the 

acknowledgement that there is still a lot to know and to explore[10]. Discovering new 

forms of life in extreme environments can provide insights into a variety of topics, like 

the biogeochemical activities that occur in the ocean[11], and the impact that human 

activity may have on them[12] . 

1.2. Metagenomic Analysis  

To analyse a metagenome, several steps are typically involved, from the experimental 

design to sharing the data[13]. Firstly, one has to obtain the samples. Ideally, true 

replicates should be taken as well. Afterwards, one may filter the samples, to target a 

(more-or-less) specific group of organisms [14].  

The following step is sequencing. There are several technologies to sequence DNA, 

each with its own advantages and weaknesses. The Mariana Trench sediment 

samples were sequenced using Illumina’s paired-end assay. Its advantage is that it is 

cheap and generates a large number of reads per run, however they are very short (50 

– 250 bp), which can pose a problem for assembly and comparison since it becomes 

more difficult to assign a read unequivocally to a template[15]. 

Illumina’s technology consists in attaching random DNA fragments to a surface, amplify 

them to form clusters of the same sequence, and then use them as templates for 

repeated cycles of polymerase-directed single base extension. This is guaranteed by 

using 3?-modified nucleotides, labeled with a removable fluorophore. After determining 

the identity of the nucleotide incorporated by laser-induced excitation of the 

fluorophores, these as well as the side arm (that prevents the incorporation of more 

than one nucleotide per cycle) are removed. The images of the fluorescent signal are 



Introduction

   

3 
 

used to determine the sequence (each nucleotide is attached to a fluorophore of a 

different colour), and its quality, defined as the likelihood of each call being correct[16].  

The paired-end option means that a fragment is sequenced in both directions (5’ ? 3’, 

and 3’ ? 5’), therefore being helpful for the assembly[17]. 

Assembly is the next step in the Metagenomic analysis pipeline, although it is 

sometimes skipped. Its usefulness is debatable[18], given that the accuracy of the 

assemblers is difficult to assess, since there is currently no microbial community with 

known reference sequences to compare to[13]. 

The main problem with assembly is that it distorts abundance information, since 

abundant fragments will be considered as belonging to the most abundant species, 

when in reality they may be present in rare species[18]. Moreover, some fragments 

may be incorrectly discarded as mistakes or repeats, or joined up in the wrong places 

or orientations[19]. Nonetheless, if these setbacks are taken into account when doing 

the analysis, then assembly can be advantageous as it produces longer sequences 

that are easily unambiguously annotated.  

Gene prediction and annotation usually follow. The first classifies the sequences as 

coding or non-coding, and the second tries to find homology between the coding 

sequences and known sequences stored in databases. Once again, these methods 

have their own flaws, mainly because they are based on models, hence failing to 

predict exceptions that can occur in the biological world. 

Typically, the final step is to share the sequence data on public databases together 

with the metadata. Contextual data is necessary to compare with other datasets, 

essentially making the sequences useful for the database and the scientific community. 

By complying with standard languages for metadata, such as MIMS, the data becomes 

more accessible, as complex searches will retrieve more information[20]. 

The whole set of drawbacks that are surrounding metagenomic analysis, are not at all 

surprising, if one considers that it is still a very young field. A quick search on Web of 

Knowledge[21] for the total number of articles featuring the term “metagenome” or 

“metagenomics”, gives a very clear perception on how novel this field is, and how much 

data has been produced (Figure 2). 

With the popularity of the field expanding, a multitude of tools were developed making 

the choice of which one to use, a not so trivial one. There is still no evident consensus 

on which is the best tool for each step (not even for sequencing), so the errors in the 



Introduction

data are most likely directly related to the flaws in each method, which means that a 

different set of methods will yield a different set of errors. 

 

 

Figure 2 - Total number of metagenomics articles published since 1998 

  

Given this explosion of data, an obvious question is on its applicability. One example 

would be bioremediation[22]. The process of biodegradation encompasses several 

metabolic pathways that being considered in a community-basis, instead of an 

individual-basis, lead to a global understanding of what is essential and what is 

superfluous, easing the design of such a system. Moreover, the industry sector is 

always in search of novel enzymes and processes[23]. 

Even so, metagenomics tends to be regarded as exploratory research, raising more 

questions instead of addressing them. Accordingly, the aim of this project was not only 

to answer some simple questions, but also to raise some more, and hopefully to 

encourage further studies in this environment. 

1.3. Objective 

This project dealt solely with the analysis of the raw data output by sequencing. The 

goal was to assess the taxonomical distribution of the community along the depth of 

the sediment and to explore its metabolic potential, using the most adequate tools. 

However, with the publication of the article [1], which included these sediment samples, 

the focus turned to assess if the data generated by this analysis would corroborate the 

published data, namely to confirm the O2 consumption throughout the sediment depth.

1.4. Structure of the thesis 

This report is organized in five chapters. Starting with the Introduction, some 

background information is presented regarding both the site of the samples, as well as 

the technology and pipeline typically employed in this kind of studies. The second 

chapter has the methodology, with an explanation of each method and its output. 

Chapter three includes the selected results, and in chapter four a critical discussion of 

the previous is given. The last chapter has the conclusion with the final remarks and 

some future directions to similar studies.

2. Methods 

Seven out of eight sequenced samples from different depths were analysed. Each 

sample corresponded to a gradient of 5cm, starting from 0-5cm (sample 1) to 35-40cm 

(sample 8). The data was cleaned using the collection of tools Biopieces[24], the reads 

assembled using IDBA-UD[25] [26], and both the generated contigs and the clean 

reads were submitted to MG-RAST[27]. 

2.1. Sample collection, preparation and sequencing 

The upstream methodology was done by collaborators and consisted on the following: 

the DNA was extracted from 5g of sediment collected at different depths from the 

Challenger Deep-Mariana Trench at 10,900m, using PowerMax soil DNA isolation kit 

(MoBio Laboratories, CA USA). Eight DNA samples, each corresponding to a different 

depth, were sent to BGI-Shenzhen (China), for library preparation and sequencing. 

Since one of the samples (sample 4: 15-20 cm) did not contain enough DNA for library 

preparation (as reported from the Sample Test Report of BGI), 14 fastq files were 

received back, 2 for each of the seven samples – one with the forward and another 

with the reverse reads. 

2.2. Preliminary Analysis 

The initial number of reads on each sample ranged from around 41 million to almost 84 

million (Table 1).

2.3. Biopieces 

Sub-quality residues from the ends of the reads were removed, as well as the adaptors 

used in the sequencing. The reads with a length inferior to 30 bp were also excluded, in 

addition to reads with a local mean score under 15, to overcome errors propagated 

from cycle to cycle[28]. The cleaning removed from 27% to almost 59% of the reads in 

the samples (Table 1). The Biopieces script used is shown in Figure 3. 

The tool trim_seq removes residues from the ends of sequences whose quality, in the 

scores of the FASTQ file, does not match the minimum quality specified (in this case 

25). The flag “-l” makes sure that residues are removed until a stretch of at least 3 

residues with good quality is found, to avoid a premature termination due to a good 

quality residue at the end. This step is necessary to overcome the effect of phasing and 

pre-phasing. These are caused by incomplete removal of the 3' terminators and 

fluorophores, sequences missing an incorporation cycle, or by the incorporation of 

nucleotides without effective 3' terminators[28]. This means that each cycle’s signal is 

affected by the signal of the previous and subsequent cycles, hindering the detection of 

the right base.

Find_adaptor searches the reads for the given adaptors (forward: 

ACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and reverse: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTC), or 

partial adaptors with at least 6 residues of length – flags “-l” for the forward and “-L” for 

the reverse adaptor. By default, a percentage of the adaptor length is allowed for 

mismatches, insertions, and deletions (10%, 5% and 5%, respectively). 

Once the adaptors are found, clip_adaptor removes them, based on the keys output by 

find_adaptor: ADAPTOR_POS_RIGHT, ADAPTOR_POS_LEFT, and ADAPTOR_LEN_LEFT.

The merge_pair_seq merges paired sequences, as long as they are interleaved. 

Sequence names must be in either Illumina1.3/1.5 format trailing a “/1” or “/2” or 

Illumina1.8 containing “1:” or “2:”. The sequence names should also match. 

Grab is an improved version of Unix’s “grep”. It selects records that match a pattern, a 

regular expression, or a numerical evaluation. In this case, we selected for reads with a 

length superior to 30bp, by examining the keys SEQ_LEN_LEFT and 

SEQ_LEN_RIGHT, output by merge_pair_seq. 

Afterwards, mean_scores –l was used to calculate the local mean scores, which means 

that instead of calculating the mean as the sum of all the scores over the length of the 

string, it uses means from a sliding window, and returns the smallest value.  

Finally, split_pair_seq was used to split the sequences merged with merge_pair_seq.  

To speed up the process, this script was ran with GNU parallel[29] with the –L 8 option, 

which takes two records at a time (each record has 4 lines), to circumvent breaking the 

pairs.  GNU Parallel allows Biopieces to be executed in parallel using multiple CPUs on 

multiple cores and servers[24]. 

The merge_pair_seq and split_pair_seq tools were created within this project, to 

overcome speed and memory problems originated by the use of order_pairs. The latter 

interleaves the sequences, as long as their names are in Illumina 1.5 or 1.8 scheme, 

and ads a key stating if the read is “paired” or “orphan”. This should be used after the 

trimming and grabbing steps, and subsequently, only the paired reads should be 

grabbed.

2.4. Assembly 

The decision to assemble smaller reads into larger contigs was made based on the 

postulation that “The longer the sequence information, the better is the ability to obtain 

accurate information.” The annotation procedure becomes easier since longer 

sequences yield more information to compare with the databases, but it also applies for 

classification of DNA fragments, as well as to rise the confidence in accuracy due to 

the lower quality of single reads, by having multiple reads covering the same segment 

of information, provided that the coverage is high enough[13]. The IDBA-UD algorithm 

is based on de Bruijn graphs adapted for metagenomic sequencing technologies with 

uneven sequencing depths[26].  

De Bruijn graphs have every possible (k-1)-mer assigned to a node and it has a direct 

edge to another one if there is some k-mer whose prefix is the former and whose suffix 

is the latter. This means that all the edges in the graph represent all possible k-mers. 

The idea is to find an Eulerian cycle[30] with the shortest superstring that contains each 

k-mer exactly once (Figure 5).  

By visiting each edge only once, the time to run the algorithm is roughly proportional to 

the number of edges[31], unlike in a Hamiltonian cycle[32], where each node is visited 

only once, making it an NP-complete problem[33] (meaning the time to solve it 

increases quickly with the size of the input).  

Applied to genome assembly, all the k-mers are the ones present in the reads 

generated by sequencing[31], so ideally, the Eulerian cycle would generate the 

genome. In practice this method cannot be applied directly, since there are some 

assumptions that do not hold. Firstly, we cannot be sure that all the k-mers present in 

the genome were generated; secondly, k-mers are not error-free; thirdly, each k-mer is 

very likely to appear more than once in the genome; and lastly, we should not assume 

that the genome is a single circular chromosome.  

To deal with the first problem, instead of trying to assemble the reads, the algorithm 

breaks them into smaller k-mers which are more likely to be representative of the whole 

genome. To handle errors, the assembler chooses the path which is supported by 

higher coverage.  Regarding repeats, if a k-mer appears more than once in the 

genome, it shall be represented by several edges connecting the same two nodes. 

Finally, rather than searching for an Eulerian cycle, if the algorithm is modified to 

search for an Eulerian path[34], then it is not required to end in the same node where it 

began[31].

Figure 5 – Genome assembly strategies: Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycles[31].  

 

The main problem with metagenomic data is that species with different abundances will 

be represented by reads with uneven depth, and this cannot be disregarded as, e.g., 

an amplification bias. IDBA_UD solves this problem by adopting variable thresholds on 

the multiplicity of the k-mers, making them dependent on the sequencing depth of the 

neighboring contigs. The idea is that contigs with much lower sequencing depths that 

their neighbors are more likely erroneous[26]. Moreover, IDBA_UD uses paired-end 

information, namely the distance between the pairs, to solve issues such as missing k-

mers and repeats. 

The assembler IDBA_UD was firstly used with the default minimum contig size setting 

(200 bp), which yielded a N50 from 3545 to 9240. N50 is the length of the smallest 

contig that contains the fewest largest contigs whose combined length represents no 

less than 50% of the assembly. It is one of the common assembly statistics[35]. 

Therefore, then a higher minimum contig size of 500 bp was chosen, which improved 

the N50 values, so these contigs were uploaded to the server MG-RAST[27]. The 

complete analysis of both assemblies (using the Biopiece analyze_assembly) is shown 

on Table 2 and Table 3, including N50, contig length (maximum, minimum, mean and 

total) and the number of contigs.

2.5. MG-RAST 

MG-RAST[27] uses several bioinformatics tools in its pipeline. Firstly, it filters 

sequences based on length, number of ambiguous bases and quality values. All the 

contigs from all the 7 samples uploaded, passed this preprocessing stage.  

Then, “technical replicates”, identified as sequences with identical first 50 base-pairs, 

are removed in a step called Dereplication. Between 0,7% (surface sample) and 2,3% 

(sample 7) of the contigs were removed in this step, but no reads were removed. This 

can be explained by the use of the same reads for different contigs. 

After that, FragGeneScan[36] is used to predict coding regions. This tool is an ab-initio 

gene calling algorithm that uses hidden Markov Model for coding and non-coding 

regions, and that was developed specially for metagenomes. It includes codon usage 

bias, sequencing error models and start/stop codon patterns. A gene is reported if it’s 

longer than 60 bp, and begins either with a start or an internal codon of a gene and 

ends with a stop or an internal codon. This way, both complete and partial genes are 

predicted. From 29,239 (sample 2) to 63,877 (sample 1) coding sequences were

13 
 

predicted within the contigs, and from 16,387,405 (sample 2) to 40,199,546 (sample 6) 

within the reads. 

The sequences output from FragGeneScan are then clustered at 90% identity with 

qiime-uclust. QIIME[37] is a software package developed specially for high throughput 

amplicon sequencing data, although it also supports metagenomic data. It incorporates 

many third party tools, such as UCLUST[38]. This algorithm clusters sequences based 

on their similarity, according to a threshold set by the user (or in this case by MG-

RAST). Each cluster is therefore represented by a sequence, and all the sequences in 

it should have a similarity higher than the threshold to the sequence representing the 

cluster (centroid), and centroids should have similarity below the threshold to the other 

centroids. The algorithm starts with no centroids, and each sequence is compared to 

the list of centroids and it is either assigned to a cluster or selected as a new centroid. 

The centroids and the singletons (unclustered sequences) are then searched using 

BLAT[39] against the M5NR protein database. M5NR is a non-redundant protein 

database which incorporates data from GO[40],  KEGG[36][37], NCBI[38][39], 

SEED[40][41], UniProt[47], VBI[48] and eggNOG[49], and has almost 16,000,000 

sequences. BLAT builds an index of the database and then scans linearly through the 

query sequence, unlike BLAST which builds an index of the query sequence and then 

scans linearly through the database, making it faster since it does not have to scan 

through a database of gigabases of sequence but only through a relatively short query 

sequence. BLAT, however, looses to BLAST in terms of sensitivity, since it needs an 

exact or nearly-exact match to find a hit, making it suitable mostly for closely related 

species. The alignment identified between 25,261 (sample 2) and 50,816 (sample 1) 

protein features in the contigs, and from 4,859,593 (sample 2) to 10,890,942 (sample 

6) in the reads, which proved to be correlated at 98% with the number of dereplicated 

reads, using Pearson’s coefficient: 

            
             

                  
 

Where    and    are the average of the number of dereplicated reads and the number of 

protein features, respectively. 

The results of the search against the M5NR database were retrieved for each of the 

samples, at 90% identity, to map against the metabolic pathways maps based on 

KEGG data, using KEGG Mapper[41] [42] and iPath[50] [51]. 



Methods

Besides from being the input for the Dereplication step, the filtered sequences are pre-

screened to identify ribosomal sequences at 70% identity, and then they are clustered 

using UCLUST at 97% identity. The clusters are then searched for similarity against the 

M5RNA database (Greengenes[52], SILVA[53] and RDP[54]), using BLAT[39]. This 

alignment identified between 36 rRNA features (sample 2) to 72 (sample 1) in the 

contigs, whilst in the reads the number ranged from 19,014 (sample 2) to 38,639 

(sample 1). 

MG-RAST also calculated automatically the alpha diversity of each sample, to 

summarize the distribution of species-level annotations in that sample, using the 

following equation: 

                 

 

   

        

Where p is a ratio of the number of annotations for each species to the total number of 

annotations and m is the total number of different species annotations, using all the 

annotation source databases incorporated by MG-RAST[27]. 

Based on the abundances of each species in each sample (using the reads), the R 

package vegan[55] was used to calculate the beta diversity, as suggested in the 

manual[56]. Therefore it was calculated pair wise between samples, using the 

Sørensen index of dissimilarity:  

  
   

      
 

Where a is the number of species shared by the two samples, and b and c are the 

number of unique species to each sample; as well as the widely known Whittaker's 

species turnover:  

          

Where ? is the total number of species in the collection of samples (gamma diversity), 

and    is the average richness per sample. Subtraction of one guarantees that ?=0 

means that there are no excess species or no heterogeneity between samples. 

Rarefaction curves were also automatically generated. The theory behind it, is to 

repeatedly re-sample the pool of reads, at random, plotting the average number of 

species represented by 1, 2,…N reads[57].

To compare the abundances among the samples, the results were extracted from the 

reads, whereas to assess presence or absence of a defined feature, the contigs’ 

results were retrieved. 

 

3.1. Taxonomic Hits Distribution 

Extracting the best hit classification from the reads compared to M5NR using a 

maximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity of 90%, and a minimum alignment length 

of 15 aa, it is clear that Bacteria, and more specifically Proteobacteria, largely dominate 

in all the 7 samples (Figure 6 and Figure 20). 

In terms of class, Betaproteobacteria seems to comprise 78% of Proteobacteria in 

Sample 1, unlike the other samples, where Gammaproteobacteria seems to be the 

dominant class (Figure 7). Sample 3 shows a larger representation of 

Alphaproteobacteria compared to the other samples. 

Most of Gammaproteobacteria in sample 1 is Pseudoalteromonas, in sample 2 is 

Pseudomonas, whereas from sample 3 to sample 8 other genera, namely 

Marinobacter, become just as dominant (See Figure 21 to Figure 27).

A correlation analysis of the distance between samples and their ?-diversity, shows no 

relation between them (Figure 28).  

The rarefaction curves of annotated species richness for all the samples show a quick 

rise at first, and then they become flatter but without leveling off towards an asymptote 

(Figure 9). This means that if there had been more reads, probably more species would 

be found. Even so, these results allow a reasonable guess of the community structure.

Nevertheless, when comparing with metagenomes from 1) the gut microbiota of 91 

pregnant women of varying prepregnancy BMIs and gestational diabetes status and 

their infants (http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?project=265), and 2) metagenomes 

from activated sludge from 2 full-scale tannery wastewater treatment plants 

(http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?project=922), it is clearly seen, that the Mariana 

Trench samples group together in a very distinct group. As these two environments are 

expected to be very and quite different, respectively, from the deep sea Mariana 

Trench samples, this is a good indicator on the reliability of the latter. See for example 

Figure 11, for a comparison against the M5NR database, at 90% minimum identity, and 

an e-value of 1e-5.

3.2. Functional Category Hits Distribution  

Looking at the number of features that were annotated based on the reads compared 

to the contigs, it is noticeable that the latter provide a much more reliable source for 

annotation, as seen from the range of e-values, which was expected. See, for example, 

sample 7 in Figure 12 and Figure 13. One might notice that there were more features 

predicted from the reads, but at the same time there were more reads than contigs.

Figure 13 – Number of features in the contigs of sample 7 annotated by the different databases 

 

Moreover, taking again sample 7 as an example, only 50.7% of the predicted protein 

features in the reads could be annotated with similarity to a protein of known function, 

whereas 84.9% of the predicted protein features of the contigs were annotated.

From all the databases that were used to compare the protein sequences generated 

from the contigs, SEED Subsystems[45] had the higher number of annotations. (Figure 

12 and Figure 13) It is worth noting, however, that each database has a different type 

of annotation data, hence the different number of hits. Since the tools to analyse the 

pathways (KEGG Mapper and iPath) use the KEGG database, the focus was put on 

the functional hierarchy given by KEGG Orthology (KO)[41][42]. 

Comparing the reads to KO, using a maximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity of 

90%, and a minimum alignment length of 15, on average 53% (±0.03) of the reads with 

predicted protein functions were annotated as belonging to the Metabolism category. 

From those, 14% (±0.05) of the reads belong to Energy metabolism.  

Roughly 100% of the reads from Energy metabolism, in the reads from sample 1, 

correspond to oxidative phosphorylation, and on the rest of the samples, this value lays 

around 77% (±0.07). 

In fact, the F-type H
+
-transporting ATPase subunit beta (K02112), involved in both 

oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 14) and photosynthesis (Figure 15), is the second 

most abundant hit in sample 1 (out of 54 hits), with an average identity of 91.06% and 

an average e-value of -6.14.

In sample 2, K02112 appears in 11
th
 place (out of 239 hits) with an abundance of 9187 

together with F-type H
+
-transporting ATPase subunit alpha (K02111) in 10

th
 place with 

an abundance of 9307. 

In sample 3, K02112 has an abundance of 9513 and K02111 of 9758, appearing in 8

and 6
th
, respectively, when sorting for abundance. For sample 5 the values are 13405 

for K02112 and 12764 for K02111 (10
th
 and 12

th
). Sample 6 has even higher 

abundances for K02112 and K02111: 16632 and 16260 (8
th
 and 9

th
 most abundant). In 

samples 7 and 8 they appear in 5
th
 and 6

th
 place, out of 108 and 115 hits, with 

abundances of 11492 and 11257, and 10691 and 10294. In all samples from the 

second to the seventh, these subunits have an average identity above 91.5%.

Using the contigs, with the same settings, only K02112 was found, and only in samples 

2 and 8. However, the average alignment length of the hits was 356.55 and 332.22, 

respectively, whereas for the reads it was 27.67 and 27.57. Nevertheless, other hits 

also classified as belonging to Oxidative Phosphorylation were found, like NADH-

quinone oxidoreductase subunit (K13380 and K13378), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase 

subunits (K00338 and K00340), F-type H
+
-transporting ATPase subunit c (K02110), V-

type H

oxidase operon protein cyoD (K02300) and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 

5 (K05577).  

To address, with some degree of confidence, whether alternative energy metabolism 

processes occur in any of the samples, the contigs results were further explored. 

Indeed, all samples contained contigs involved in Methane Metabolism (Figure 16).

In addition, contigs from samples 2, 5 and 8, matched hits from nitrogen metabolism 

(Figure 17). In all the three samples, nitric oxide reductase subunit B (K04561) 

(EC:1.7.2.5) was present, which is involved in denitrification (nitrate ? nitrogen).

Sample 2 also had a nitrogenase iron protein NifH (K02588) (EC:1.18.6.1), a 

nitrogenase molybdenum-cofactor synthesis protein NifE (K02587) and a nitrogen 

fixation protein NifX (K02596).

Finally, the map generated with iPATH (Figure 18) gives a general overview of the 

pathways present, when combining all samples. It is worth noting that photosynthesis 

appears mapped; however, this is most likely a misleading mapping, since the enzyme

also in oxidative phosphorylation, as mentioned earlier.

4. Discussion  

Marine sediments, and in particular hadal trenches, receive substantial deposition of 

microbes and organic matter from the upper water layer[1], and provide a matrix of 

complex nutrients and solid surfaces for microbial growth[60]. However, the low 

temperature and the extreme hydrostatic pressure demand a certain degree of 

adaptation from the organisms inhabiting such an environment. Even so, there seems 

to be a fairly high diversity along the sediment depth, as seen in Table 5 and Figure 9. 

Proteobacteria is the largest and most metabolically diverse group of Bacteria. They 

are all gram-negative, and they divide into 5 classes: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and 

epsilon[61]. The dominance of Gammaproteobacteria is in accordance with a study 

from the Pacific Artic Ocean, where the temperatures are also very low[62], and 

somewhat with the study of sediments at 4000m depth in Pacific Ocean, where not 

only Gammaproteobacteria but also Alphaproteobacteria dominate the community[63]. 

Intriguingly, the outer-layer of an actively venting black-smoker chimney from a 

hydrothermal vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge[64], is also dominated by 

Gammaproteobacteria, even though its temperature lies above 310ºC. 

The PCoA graphs show samples that exhibit similar abundance profiles, in terms of 

taxonomy or function, grouped together. However, when comparing the seven 

samples, there is no obvious trend in the community towards the depth of the sediment 

(Figure 10). Nevertheless, the fact that this project’s samples group together and very 

distinctly from other project’s samples, is a good indicator that this environment has its 

own community structure.  

The poor correlation between ?-diversity and distance between samples also supports 

the PCoA results (Table 6 and Figure 28). This means that the difference in microbial 

community composition (as defined in [65]) is most likely due to factors other than 

depth. It is possible that, under such high pressure, some centimeters of sediment do 

not really make a difference in the community structure. Alternatively, there might have 

been some mixing of the communities during the sampling process. 

It should be noted however, that the fact that the community as a whole does not show 

a shift alongside the depth of the sediment, does not exclude the hypothesis that some 

taxa correlate with it.  

Regarding the decision to assemble, the range of e-values of the number of features 

annotated with the different databases, as well as the percentage of predicted protein

features that were annotated, should provide some degree of confidence in the 

assembly. 

The high number of hits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway supported the 

predictions from [1], that there is intensified O2 consumption within the sediment, unlike 

in the sediment of the reference site (?6000m of water depth), where the microbial 

activity has reduced rates. This was supported by measurements of the O2 

concentration throughout the depth of the sediment. Attenuation in the O2 

concentration reflects higher rates of its consumption[1] (Figure 19), which is consistent 

with the presence of genes involved in aerobic respiration in all the samples. 

 

 

Figure 19 – Oxygen micro-profiles at 6,018?m water depth (a); and at Challenger Deep (b) [1].  

 

Even though oxidative phosphorylation dominates the energy metabolism processes, 

methane and nitrogen metabolism still play a part in the community’s energetic 

potential.  

Normally, methanogenesis is associated with anoxic environments; still, it is known that 

even in oxic environments, anoxic microenvironments can form, where 

methanogenesis takes place[61]. 



Discussion

   

31 
 

Once more, the predictions that there is intensified mineralization mediated by the 

prokaryotic community at Challenger Deep[1] are supported by the contigs with 

homology to features involved in nitrogen metabolism.  

Finally, the misleading mapping of the ATPase (Figure 18), should be taken as an 

example that care and criticism are fundamental when using automated tools.

Conclusion

5. Conclusion 

This study was a first description of both the community structure and its functional 

potential, in the Mariana Trench, a unique environment for its extreme conditions. The 

amount of data generated made it prohibitive to describe it in total. The energy 

metabolism was selected for this thesis, since it was interesting to compare with the 

results from [1]. The finding that there are enzymes involved in the oxidative 

phosphorylation pathway in all 7 samples, supported the published measurements of 

oxygen consumption throughout the sediment. 

It was expected to observe a taxonomic and/or functional gradient along the depth of 

the sediment but that does not seem to happen. A further investigation on this matter 

would be helpful to prove if there are any signature taxa of the depth.   

The data used in the study will soon be publicly available on MG-RAST, therefore 

accessible for additional investigation. However, in the future, it would be sensible to 

sample with true replicates, and take a broader number of environmental 

measurements, to allow the data to be more comparable to other studies. It would also 

be interesting to take samples from sediments from other depths along the Challenger 

Deep, to assess if the community uniqueness is due to the extreme depth or to the 

overall conditions on that site. 

To conclude, it is probable that in 10 years time, with the development of new tools or 

with the improvement of the existing ones, all of these results will be proved inaccurate. 

However, the aim of this thesis was neither to develop new tools, nor to compare the 

existing ones, but to use them wisely and understand their purpose for this analysis. 

Hence, the argument of this project is that with this set of tools, this is the product.
