AbstrAct

the corumbataí river is one of the main tributaries of the right margin of the Piracicaba river, itself a 
tributary of tietê river. the corumbataí is part of the Paraná river basin and is regionally important not 
only because of its good-quality water but also because the local landscape has unique features. this 
study aimed to characterize the fish assemblage of the corumbataí in order to provide background data 
for evaluating its environmental status. For this purpose, within the corumbatai river basin 4 of the main 
rivers were chosen, along which 3 sampling points each were established. twenty-four samplings were 
carried out during march-July and september-december 2001. diversity measures were used to evaluate 
biotic data. A linear ANcovA model was used to test the hypothesis of a spatio-temporal variation in the 
fish assemblage, with species richness as the response variable, river order as the factor, and temperature 
and the natural logarithm of number of individuals as covariates. this analysis showed a spatio-temporal 
variation in agreement with various concepts, e.g., the specie-area relationship and the river continuum, 
which have been exhaustively discussed in the literature. When compared to those of the other rivers, 
data from the ribeirão claro river showed a different pattern, probably due to human interference, and 
exemplifying aquatic habitat fragmentation that might have led to isolation of local fish populations.

Keywords: Paraná river basin, corumbataí river, fish assemblage, species diversity, habitat fragmentation.

rEsUMO

A estrutura das assembléias de peixes da bacia do rio corumbataí, Estado de são Paulo, brasil: 
caracterização e perturbações devido à atividade humana

o rio corumbataí é um dos principais tributários da margem direita do rio Piracicaba que é um tributário 
do rio tietê. o rio corumbataí integra a bacia do rio Paraná e é regionalmente importante não só por 
possuir águas de boa qualidade, mas também por possuir elementos raros na paisagem local. este estudo 
visou caracterizar as assembléias de peixes do rio corumbataí e fornecer dados que contribuam para uma 
avaliação da sua qualidade ambiental. Na bacia do rio corumbataí, foram amostrados 4 rios principais, cada 
um com 3 pontos de coleta. vinte e quatro amostras foram coletadas durante os meses de março a julho e 
de setembro a dezembro de 2001. dados bióticos foram avaliados por medidas de diversidade. um modelo 
linear ANcovA foi utilizado para testar a hipótese de variação espaço-temporal nas assembléias de peixes, 
com a riqueza de espécies como variável resposta, ordem do rio como fator e temperatura e logaritmo 
natural do número de indivíduos como covariáveis. esta análise mostrou uma variação espaço-temporal 
que é corroborada por conceitos exaustivamente discutidos na literatura, tais como relação espécie-área e o 
conceito de rio contínuo. dados provenientes do rio ribeirão claro mostraram um padrão diferente quando 
comparados com os outros rios. esta diferença foi provavelmente devido à interferência humana e atesta

IntrOdUctIOn

the study of biological assemblages is 
important not only for answering questions 
related to theoretical ecology, but also to identify 
organisms and/or emergent properties pertinent 
to environmental quality (magurran, 1988). 
such studies could supply background data 
for monitoring purposes and environmental 
conservation programs.

in addition, fish assemblages yield plentiful 
information about the life cycle of several 
species, food habit diversity, both alloctonous and 
autoctonous sources of energy, and to identification 
of species at the top of the food web (harris, 
1995).

Fish assemblage structures may be affected by 
zoogeographical patterns, local abiotic phenomena, 
biological attributes of given species, and biotic 
interactions among those comprising an assemblage 
(matthews, 1998). Assemblages are also controlled 
by intrinsic factors (biological attributes of each 
species [Angermeier, 1982; schlosser, 1987]) or, 
alternatively, by extrinsic factors, e.g., biotic and 
abiotic interactions among ecosystems (marsh-
matthews &amp;amp; matthews, 2000). 

this work focuses on the effects of 
extrinsic factors on emergent properties of a fish 
assemblage, with emphasis on spatio-temporal 
variation and responses of these assemblages to 
ongoing urbanization and changing land use in the 
corumbatai river basin. 

MAtErIAL And MEtHOds

the ca. 1690 km2 corumbataí river basin 
comprises about 13% of the hydrographic basin 
of the Piracicaba, Jundiaí, and capivari rivers. 
the study area is located between 47° 30’ and  
47° 50’west and 22° 05’ and 22° 30’ south 
(Fig. 1).

According to the Köppen classification, 
regional climate is cwa, i.e., subtropical, dry in 
winter and rainy in summer, with annual mean 
temperature varying from between 20 and 23.7 °c 

in January, and between 14.9 and 17.1 °c in July 
(AtlAs Ambiental..., 2002). Flow measurements 
of the basin’s main river the (corumbataí) reflect 
this climatic characteristic (Fig. 2).

the study area presents landscape features 
unusual in the interior of são Paulo, the state 
having brazil’s highest industrialization index. in 
1996, the basins of the Piracicaba, Jundiaí, and 
capivari rivers contributed 18.8% of the gross 
wealth generated by sP state’s industries. of the 
total pollution generated in corumbataí basin, 
about 30% derives from industrial activity, while 
sewage represents ca. 70%. of the latter, 98% is 
collected, of which only 5% is treated.

the water quality of the Piracicaba river basin 
is presently at a critical state, while those of the 
corumbataí river are of good quality. so much so that, 
despite its location on the margins of the Piracicaba 
river, the municipality of Piracicaba - through which 
the high water-volume river runs - obtains 100% of 
its water supply from the corumbataí system. 

of the municipalities in the corumbataí basin, 
that of rio claro - with ca. 163,000 inhabitants, 
or 79.5% of the basin’s entire population - is the 
most important. it was estimated that of total water 
pollution generated by the municipality, 97% was 
sanitary sewage, while the remaining 3% was 
of industrial origin, making rio claro the main 
pollution source in the corumbataí system (Atlas 
Ambiental, 2002). 

the ribeirão claro river presents marked 
anthropic impacts, e.g., two dams: one - which had 
been used in the past for energy generation - in the 
lower stretch, and the other, in the middle stretch, 
for water abstraction despite sewage spillage along 
a roughly 3 km stretch of the river.

during the hydrological cycle of 2001, 
two samplings were carried out at 12 points: 
one sampling in march-June, and the other in 
september-december. the samplings were made 
in 4 main rivers of the basin: Passa cinco, cabeça, 
corumbataí, and ribeirão claro (Fig. 1 and 
table 1). each sampling point consisted of a 150 m 
stretch and was located at a different altitude.

by using a map with a scale of 1:50,000, the 
points were hierarchically classified accordingly to 
position and order along the channel (see horton, 
1945, and strahler, 1957, for protocols). 

samplings were carried out with a set of 
gillnets, with opposite knots and mesh size varying 
between 3 to 9 cm, and 3 pairs of fish traps. the 
nets and traps were set by midafternoon (between

15 h and 18 h), and left until the following morning 
(between 7 h and 9 h). Nets were placed and 
distributed randomly along the river margins in 
each sampling point. Pairs of traps were placed in 
convenient places along the channel.

the physiochemical parameters of the water, 
e.g., temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, ph, 
and conductivity were measured with a horiba  
u-10 water quality checker.

species were classified according to 
their food habits, i.e., herbivorous, bentonic, 
insectivorous, generalist, omnivorous, piscivorous, 
and detrictivorous. species diversity was calculated 
with the shannon index (h’ = - ? p

i = 1,2,3,…s, where s is the number of species in the

was used to assess the similarity between species 
composition and between the trophic groups of the 
basin rivers studied. 

the hypothesis of a difference in the spatio-
temporal pattern and in the assemblage structure 
among these rivers was tested by analysis of 
covariance, in which the dependent variable was the 
number of species, and factor was the river order 
with three levels (4, 5, and 6), with temperature and 
the natural logarithm of number of individuals as 
covariates. 

rEsULts

Along the entire basin of the corumbataí 
river, 2474 individuals (with a summed weight 
approaching 56 kg) belonging to 35 species were 
caught (table 2). twenty-two species (63%) 
captured were characiformes and 9 (26%) were 
siluriformes. cyprinodontiformes (2 species, 6%), 
Perciformes (1 species, 2.5%), and gymnotiformes 
(1 species, 2.5%) were also represented. characidae 
was the family with the highest number of species 
(12 species, 34%), followed by loricariidae 

(4 species, 11%), and Anastomidae (3 species, 
8.5%).

Bryconamericus stramineus, Astyanax sp., 
Hypostomus strigaticeps, Astyanax altiparanae, 
Astyanax fasciatus, Serrapinnus notomelas, 
Astyanax scabripinnis, and Pimelodella gracilis 
represented about 80% of the total number 
of individuals captured. eighteen small size  
(l &amp;lt;15 cm) species were numerically over-
represented in the samplings (ca. 75%). besides 
being rare, Corydoras paleatus, Phalloceros 
caudimaculatus, Oligosarcus paranensis, and 
Poecilia vivípara were less than 5 cm.

the highest points at ribeirão claro 
(sampling units 4 and 14) showed highest values, 
while the lower point (sampling units 11 and 24) 
showed the lowest shannon diversity index values 
(tables 3 and 4).

the fish assemblage of the Passa cinco and 
cabeça rivers showed the highest similarity in 
species composition when compared to that found 
in the corumbataí and ribeirão claro (table 5). 
the same pattern was observed for trophic 
classification, even though the fish assemblage of 
ribeirão claro was dissimilar when compared to 
that of any other river (table 6). 

the number of species caught increased 
significantly with river order (n = 24; r2 = 0.208; 
p = 0.025), water temperature (n = 24; r2 = 0.151; 
p = 0.061), and natural logarithm of the number of 
individuals (n = 24; r2 = 0.465; p = 0.0002).

besides its effect on the fishes’ metabolism, 
the water temperature had a temporal effect 
because the temperature decreased significantly as 
the first twelve samplings were carried out (n = 12; 
r2 = 0.663; p = 0.001), while during the last twelve 
samplings, temperature increased significantly  
(n = 12; r2 = 0.634; p = 0.002).

When the natural logarithm of the number 
of individuals was plotted against species richness 
for the basin rivers, the expected pattern was 
not observed for the ribeirão claro river, i.e., 
increasing the sample size would be expected to 
increase the number of species captured. this 

exploratory analysis resulted in removal of those 
data from the ANcovA. 

About 78% of the variability in number of 
species in the basin can be explained by variation 
in space, represented as river order; time and 
physiology, represented by water temperature; and

the ribeirão claro river showed the highest 
dispersion of data related to channel depth, 
probably because the lower stretch (sampling units 
11 and 24) in a reservoir. When compared with the 
other rivers, the Passa cinco was characterized 
by low depth-values, i.e., shallow, and the highest 
superficial velocity. because the corumbataí is 
the main and the longest river in the basin, the 
sampling points were more distant from each other, 
which could explain the great variability observed 
in channel width. the ribeirão claro river showed 
the highest dispersion for turbidity values, low 
values for dissolved oxygen, and high values for 
conductivity. this pattern can be explained by the 
difference between the low stretch (sampling units 
11 and 24), and that of the other two sampling 
points. this passage of the municipality of rio 
claro. the Passa cinco river showed the lowest 
conductivity values, evidencing limpid waters 
(tables 1, 3, and 4).

increase in number of species as the order 
of the river increases has been observed for other 
systems (Angermeier &amp;amp; schlosser, 1989; osborne 
&amp;amp; Wiley, 1992), corroborating two main ecological 
concepts, i.e., the species-area relationship 
(macArthur &amp;amp; Wilson, 1967), as well as the river 
continuum concept (vannote et al., 1980).

the temperature has a pervasive effect on 
organisms, especially in ectotherms such as fishes, 
since it regulates metabolic process intensities. 
An increase in metabolism means an increase in 
the energy needed, which determines the amount 
of food necessary for an organism to perform 
work. by the same token, a fish assemblage is 
also influenced by variations in the temperature, 
as shown by magnuson et al. (1979). besides 
representing the emerging properties of the fish 
assemblage, the water temperature represented its 
temporal dynamics.

the logarithm of the number of individuals 
was the variable that best predicted the number of 
species. this can be viewed either as a consequence 
of sample size or the effect of so-called “turnover 
noise”, where the variation in species richness 
expected in a constant environment would depend 
on immigration rates due to great mobility of 
the fish and/or local extinction (Angermeier &amp;amp; 
schlosser, 1989).

the model best explaining spatio-temporal 
variation in the number of species of the corumbataí 

river basin is that containing information about 
river order, temperature, and number of individuals, 
excluding the data for the ribeirão claro river for 
reasons previously mentioned.

river systems have many variables that 
control fish assemblages and, in the present 
work, adjusting a simple model allowed a good 
visualization of the multidimensional structure 
accounting for the spatio-temporal variation in 
the fish species richness in the corumbataí river 
basin. Without the effect of the rivers the ANcovA 
analysis explained about 77% of the variability of 
the number of species in the basin as a function of 
spatial variation, represented by river order; time 
and physiology, represented by water temperature; 
and sample size, represented by the natural 
logarithm of number of individuals (table 7).

the fact that the model of spatio-temporal 
variation previously presented did not fit the ribeirão 
claro river data might be due to the simplicity of 
the model itself, which could not incorporate a 
landscape of the complexity of that through which 
this river runs. because this model is compatible 
with continuum river theory, it cannot incorporate 
anthropic changes in the natural landscape. but a 
model must take into account the relationships of 
a river with its surroundings, i.e., the landscape, 
which in the present case is composed of patches 
connecting by corridors allowing contact among 
these habitats. 

As anthropogenic activity fragments natural 
habitats, the results may have been, in the case of the 
ribeirão claro river, formation of metapopulations 
and disappearance of other populations that may 
subsequently reappear due to immigration from 
adjacent areas.

in any case, two causes might have led 
to the present situation: a) following adequate 
sewage treatment, specially by the municipality 
of rio claro, the high and medium stretches of 
the ribeirão claro river might be functioning as 
dispersal sources in recolonizing habitats along 
the basin channels; and b) lack of rehabilitation 
measures for rivers of the basin, mainly the 
basin of the ribeirão claro river, might have 
decreased in local population density within 
the metapopulation, jeopardizing their survival. 
both of these possibilities illustrate the manner 
in which the fragmentation process in aquatic 
habitats can alter the species-area relationship

(schlosser, 1995), and fit the concepts of Punsey 
et al. (2000). however, it must be remembered that 
prior to present sewage treatment many species 
had already been distributed throughout the basin, 
which is small and presents low heterogeneity. in 
addition, micro and mesohabitat factors can affect 
the primary structure, i.e., species abundance, as 
is the case with the ribeirão claro river, which 
presently shows a high relative abundance and 
diversity (tables 3 and 4). 

the present results, although contributing 
to what is already known about spatio-temporal 
variation of the fish assemblage of the basin of the 
corumbataí river, also were useful in detecting 
behavioral differences based on the data of the 
most impacted river of the basin, the ribeirão 
claro, disturbed as it is by sewage spillovers while 
crossing the municipality of rio claro, and by the 
degree of ichtyofauna isolation in points above the 
site at which water is abstracted. unfortunately, 
the magnitude of this impact is not yet known, nor 
is it known for how long the fish assemblage can 
survive local environmental alterations.
