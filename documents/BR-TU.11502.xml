SUMMARY

Nitrogen fertilizers increase the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and can reduce
the methane (CH4) oxidation from agricultural soils.  However, the magnitude of
this effect is unknown in Southern Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions, as well as
the potential of different sources of mineral N fertilizers in such an effect.  The aim
of this study was to investigate the effects of different mineral N sources (urea,
ammonium sulphate, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, Uran, controlled- release
N fertilizer, and urea with urease inhibitor) on N2O and CH4 fluxes from Gleysol in
the South of Brazil (Porto Alegre, RS), in comparison to a control treatment without
a N application.  The experiment was arranged in a randomized block with three
replications, and the N fertilizer was applied to corn at the V5 growth stage.  Air
samples were collected from a static chambers for 15 days after the N application
and the N2O and CH4 concentration were determined by gas chromatography.
The topmost emissions occurred three days after the N fertilizer application and
ranged from 187.8 to 8587.4 ?g m-2 h-1 N.  The greatest emissions were observed for
N-nitric based fertilizers, while N sources with a urease inhibitor and controlled
release N presented the smallest values and the N-ammonium and amidic were
intermediate.  This peak of N2O emissions was related to soil NO3--N (R2 = 0.56,
p &amp;lt;0.08) when the soil water-filled pore space was up to 70 % and it indicated that
N2O was predominantly produced by a denitrification process in the soil.  Soil CH4
fluxes ranged from -30.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C (absorption) to +32.5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (emission),
and the accumulated emission in the period was related to the soil NH4+-N
concentration (R2 = 0.82, p &amp;lt;0.001), probably due to enzymatic competition between
nitrification and metanotrophy processes.  Despite both of the gas fluxes being

affected by N fertilizers, in the average of the treatments, the impact on CH4
emission (0.2 kg ha-1 equivalent CO2-C ) was a hundredfold minor than for N2O
(132.8 kg ha-1 equivalent CO2-C).  Accounting for the N2O and CH4 emissions plus
energetic costs of N fertilizers of 1.3 kg CO2-C kg-1 N regarding the manufacture,
transport and application, we estimated an environmental impact of N sources
ranging from 220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-C , which can only be partially offset by C
sequestration in the soil, as no study in South Brazil reported an annual net soil C
accumulation rate larger than 160 kg ha-1 C due to N fertilization.  The N2O
mitigation can be obtained by the replacement of N-nitric sources by ammonium
and amidic fertilizers.  Controlled release N fertilizers and urea with urease
inhibitor are also potential alternatives to N2O emission mitigation to atmospheric
and systematic studies are necessary to quantify their potential in Brazilian
agroecosystems.

RESUMO:      FLUXOS DE ÓXIDO NITROSO E DE METANO EM GLEISSOLO
INFLUENCIADOS PELA APLICAÇÃO DE FERTILIZANTES
NITROGENADOS NO SUL DO BRASIL

Fertilizantes nitrogenados incrementam os fluxos de óxido nitroso (N2O) e podem deprimir
a oxidação de metano (CH4) em solos agrícolas.  Entretanto, não existem resultados da magnitude
desses efeitos nas condições edafoclimáticas do Sul do Brasil, tampouco do potencial de algumas
fontes de N em mitigar esses efeitos.  O presente estudo objetivou avaliar o impacto da aplicação
de fertilizantes nitrogenados (ureia, sulfato de amônio, nitrato de cálcio, nitrato de amônio,
Uran, N de liberação lenta e ureia com inibidor de urease) nos fluxos de N2O e CH4 em um
Gleissolo no Sul do Brasil (Porto Alegre, RS), em comparação a um tratamento controle sem
aplicação de N.  O experimento seguiu um delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com três repetições,
e os fertilizantes foram aplicados, em cobertura, numa dose única de 150 kg ha-1 N, no estádio
V5 da cultura do milho.  A avaliação dos gases foi feita utilizando-se o método da câmara
estática, nos 15 dias que sucederam a aplicação de N, e a análise das concentrações de N2O e
CH4 nas amostras de ar foi realizada por meio de cromatografia gasosa.  O pico de emissão de
N2O ocorreu no terceiro dia após a aplicação dos fertilizantes nitrogenados e a sua intensidade
variou de 187,8 a 8.587,4 ?g m-2 h-1 N, destacando-se as fontes nítricas com as maiores
emissões, as fontes amoniacais e amídicas com emissões intermediárias e os fertilizantes de
liberação lenta e com inibidor de urease com as menores emissões.  As emissões no terceiro dia
tiveram relação direta com os teores de N-NO3- do solo (R2 = 0,56, p &amp;lt;0,08) e ocorreram
quando este apresentava valores de porosidade preenchida por água (PPA) maiores que 70 %,
o que indica que a desnitrificação foi o processo predominante na produção de N2O.  Os fluxos
de CH4 do solo variaram de -30,1 ?g m-2 h-1 C (absorção) a +32,5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (emissão), e a
emissão acumulada desse gás teve relação direta com os teores de NH4+ no solo (R2 = 0,82,
p &amp;lt;0,001), possivelmente pela competição enzimática entre os processos de nitrificação e de
metanotrofia.  Apesar de os fluxos de ambos os gases terem sido alterados pela aplicação dos
fertilizantes nitrogenados, na média dos tratamentos, o impacto das emissões de CH4 (0,2 kg ha-1

C-CO2 equivalente) foi centenas de vezes menor que o verificado para as emissões de N2O
(132,8 kg ha-1 C-CO2 equivalente).  Considerando as emissões desses gases no solo fertilizado
e o custo médio de 1,3 kg C-CO2 kg-1 N referente à produção, transporte e aplicação do
fertilizante, o impacto ambiental dos fertilizantes nitrogenados variou de 220,4 a 664,5 kg ha-1

C-CO2, o qual pode ser apenas parcialmente contrabalanceado pelo acúmulo de C na matéria
orgânica do solo, pois nenhum estudo realizado no Sul do Brasil evidenciou taxa anual de
acúmulo de C no solo, decorrente da adubação nitrogenada, maior que 160 kg ha-1 C.  A
redução das emissões de N2O do solo e, portanto, do impacto ambiental pode ser obtida pelo
uso de fontes amoniacais e amídicas em detrimento de fontes nítricas.  Os fertilizantes de
liberação lenta e com inibidores de urease também são alternativas potenciais visando à
mitigação das emissões de N2O para atmosfera, e esforços deverão ser empreendidos numa
avaliação sistemática desse potencial em agroecossistemas brasileiros.

NITROUS OXIDE AND METHANE FLUXES IN SOUTH BRAZILIAN GLEYSOL AS AFFECTED...               1655

INTRODUCTION

Mineral N application to the soil is a key practice
for achieving high crop yield in non leguminous species
such as corn, sugarcane and winter cereal crops
(Amado et al., 2002; Conti, 2007; Fontoura &amp;amp; Bayer,
2009).  The Brazilian consumption of N fertilizer has
increased at 5 % per year in the last decade,
surpassing two million tons of annual demand (Lopes
&amp;amp; Bastos, 2007).  According to the national inventory
of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, N fertilization
is one of the main sources of nitrous oxide (N2O)
emission from agriculture in the country (Brasil, 2006)
and, in addition, studies have evidenced depressive
effects of such practice on methane (CH4) oxidation in
agricultural soils (Mosier et al., 1991; Hütsch, 2001).
Despite the tendency of increasing the use of N
fertilizers, however, few efforts have been made aiming
to evaluate the magnitude of these effects and the
potential of different sources of N fertilizers in
minimizing the GHG emissions, particularly the N2O,
in the Brazilian agricultural systems (Steudler et al.,
2002; Carvalho et al., 2006).

The N fertilization increases the mineral N
availability in the soil (NO3

--N + NH4+-N), which is a
substrate for the nitrification and denitrification
processes, which in turn are responsible for the N2O
production in the soil (Khalil et al., 2004).  The
denitrification is the direct source of N2O from nitric
N-based fertilizers, while both processes of nitrification
and denitrification can be involved in N2O emissions
from amidic and ammoniacal N sources (Liu et al.,
2007).  Although both processes can contribute to the
N2O emission from amidic and ammoniacal N
sources, several studies suggested that denitrification
is the dominant process from soils in which the water-
filled pore space (WFPS) is larger than 70 % (Bateman
&amp;amp; Baggs, 2005; Liu et al., 2007).  Taking such results
into account, it is reasonable to infer that the
application of nitric N-based sources might promote
greater N2O emissions than amidic and ammoniacal
sources in poorly aerated soils (&gt; 70 % WFPS).

Oppositely, however, a decline in the potential of
CH4 oxidation has been attributed to the amidic and
ammoniacal sources due to their short and long term
effects on soil methanotrophy rates (Hüstch, 2001;
Kravchenko et al., 2002).  Nitric-based fertilizers
usually have a small effect on the soil CH4 oxidation
capacity.  However, if applied at high rates and

depending upon the accompanying cation, they can
significantly enhance the CH4 emission in consequence
of the injurious effect of salinity on methanotrophic
bacteria and cause the rise of NH4+ concentration in
soil solution from its displacement from exchange sites
(Hüstch, 2001).

Besides the outcomes from amidic/ammoniacal and
nitric N sources regarding soil N2O and CH4
emissions, the adoption of microbial activity inhibitors
and controlled-release fertilizers assume a prominent
role in scenarios of mitigation of GHG emissions.
Such inputs have markedly decreased the N losses
by NH3 volatilization (Conti, 2007; Fontoura et al.,
2010).  Moreover, their delaying effect on the N
fertilizer transformation into NH 4+-N and,
consequently, into NO3

--N, can possibly cause a decline
in N2O emissions to atmosphere (Zaman et al., 2008;
Snyder et al., 2009).

The study is part of an endeavor of identifying
strategies of mitigating GHG emission in Brazilian
agricultural systems and aimed to evaluate the impact
of different N fertilizers on N2O and CH4 emissions
in a South Brazilian Gleysol.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Soil and climate characteristics

The study was performed on the experimental area
of the Agronomy Faculty, at the Federal University
of the State of Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS, in Porto
Alegre, RS (30 o 04 ’ S and 51 o 08 ’ W).  The local
climate is subtropical humid, with warm summers
and cold and rainy winters (Cfa according to Koöpen
classification).  The mean annual temperature is
19.4 oC and January is the hottest month – with a
mean of 25 °C.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,299 mm
regularly distributed over the year.  The soil is
classified as Gleysol (FAO) and has 260 g kg-1 clay
and 310 g kg-1 sand (0 to 0.20 m).  Some chemical
attributes of the soil before the onset of the experiment
are reported in table 1.

Experimental design and treatments

The experiment was carried out on an area in which,
for about ten years, it has been previously cultivated
with corn (Zea mays L.) under no tillage system in

Table 1. Soil attributes in a Gleysol at the beginning of the experiment

the summer and ryegrass in the winter (Lolium
multiflorum L.), propagated by natural re-seeding.
In the occasion of the experiment establishment, in
October 2007, the ryegrass dry mass (~3 Mg ha-1 DM)
was desiccated with gliphosate-based herbicide
(3.5 L ha-1).  Corn was manually sowed at 15 days
after herbicide application, with an inter row distance
of 0.7 m and number of seeds for a final population of
about 55,000 plants ha-1.  Sowing fertilization was
applied for all treatments and consisted of 30 kg ha-1
of N, 60 of P2O5 and 60 of K2O, by applying urea, triple
super phosphate and potassium chloride, respectively.

The sidedress fertilization (150 kg ha-1 N) was
performed in a single application when corn plants
reached the V5 stage.  The mineral N sources
[ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3); calcium nitrate
(Ca(NO3)2); ammonium sulphate [(NH4)2SO4); urea
(CO(NH2)2); urea with urease inhibitor; controlled-
release N; and Uran, a liquid formula of N, obtained
from a physical mix of urea and ammonium nitrate],
in addition to the control (without sidedress N
fertilization), were applied according to a randomized
block design, with three replicates.  The corresponding
fertilizer was applied on the surface, without
incorporation, at about 0.10 m from the corn row.  A
proportional rate of each N fertilizer was applied inside
the bases area (placed in the inter row region) where
the N2O and CH4 fluxes were evaluated.  The
controlled-release N source (Sulfammo ®) is composed
by N molecules coated by an organo-mineral double
layer that slows down the N dissolution by preventing
the water entrance into its interior.  The urea with
urease inhibitor (Super N®) is obtained from the
NBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide) addition
to the urea.  The NBPT occupies the active site of
urease, postponing the enzyme action for three to seven
days.  The relative composition of N chemical species
in each mineral N fertilizer is reported in table 2.

Air sampling and soil N2O and CH4 analysis

Soil fluxes of N2O and CH4 were evaluated by using
the static chamber method (Jantalia et al., 2008).  In
the inter row spacing, three aluminum bases per

treatment (constituting three replicates) were inserted
into the soil at a depth of 5 cm.  The bases were covered
with plastic film when the fertilizers were applied to
the area.  Subsequently, the plastic was removed and
each base received the corresponding N source
proportionally to the base area (346.5 cm2).  The PVC
chambers (20 cm height and 25 cm diameter) were
allocated on a canal, in the top of each base, which
was filled with water to hermetically close the chamber
volume during the air sampling events.  In the top,
each chamber contained a triple valve for fastening
the sampling syringes, a digital thermometer with
an outside display for monitoring the inner
temperature of the chamber and a hole 1cm in
diameter for equilibrating the pressure during the
placement of the chambers on the canal.  This hole
was kept closed during the air sampling by using a
rubber septum.

Air sampling and N2O and CH4 analysis were
performed at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15 days after
the N sidedress application in corn.  On the second
day after application, air was not sampled due to rain
occurrence at the moment of the sampling (28 mm).
The sampling events always started at 9 a.m.,
assuming that the emissions at that time represent
the approximate daily mean of GHG emissions
(Jantalia et al., 2008).  Air samples from the interior
of each chamber were taken at 0 (zero), 15, 30 and
45 min after closing chambers, using polypropylene
syringes (20 mL) containing a triple Luer lock valve
in its tip.  Immediately before each sampling time,
the inner atmosphere was homogenized through an
internal fan for 30 s.  The inner temperature of the
chamber was monitored at every sampling time
through the digital thermometer allocated in one
replicate of each treatment.  Additional information
regarding the material and the sampling procedure
are available in Gomes et al. (2009) and Zanatta
(2009).

The syringes containing the air samples were
refrigerated in thermic boxes at low temperatures and
were transported to the lab of Environmental
Biochemistry (UFRGS), where they were analyzed by
gas chromatography up to 36 h after sampling.  The

equipment was a Shimadzu GC 2014 model
“Greenhouse”, equipped with three packed columns
working at 70 °C, N2 as a carrier gas at a flow of
26 mL min-1, injector with loop for direct sampling of
1 mL and temperature set at 250 °C, electron capture
detector (ECD) at 325 °C for N2O detection and flame
ionization detector (FID) at 250 ºC for CH4.

The N2O and CH4 fluxes were estimated based on
the following equation.

where, f is the methane or nitrous oxide flux (?g m-2 h-1
N2O or CH4), Q is the quantity of each gas in the

chamber, assumed as being 1 atm, V is the chamber
volume (L), R is the ideal gases constant
(0.08205 atm L mol-1 K-1), T is the inner temperature
of the chamber at the sampling moment (°K) and A is
the chamber area (m2).  The rate of gas concentration
increase in the chamber was estimated by using the
angular coefficient obtained from the relationship
between gas concentration and time.  The daily
emissions were estimated from the rates of fluxes and
the total emission for the period (15 days) they were
calculated from the integration of the daily N2O and
CH4 emission from soil versus time (Gomes et al.,
2009).  The accumulated CH4 and N2O emission for
the experiment period was converted to quantities of
equivalent CO2-C per hectare by taking into account
the global warming potential of each gas in comparison
to CO2 (23 times greater for CH4 and 296 greater for
N2O) (Mosier et al., 2006).

Soil and climate variables

Some soil variables were evaluated in each air
sampling event in order to identify driving variables
for N2O and CH4 emissions.  At the 0 to 0.10 m, the
gravimetric water content, pH-H2O and the NO3

--N
and NH4+-N contents were analyzed in compound
samples (5 sub-samples/plot) according to methods
described by Tedesco et al. (1995).  The water-filled
pore space (WFPS) was estimated from the
gravimetric water content and the soil bulk density
(Gomes et al., 2009), which was analyzed by using
the core method at the end of the period of 15 days of
evaluation and whose results are reported in table 1.
Local data of rainfall for the evaluated period were
obtained from an Automatic Meteorological Station of
the National Institute of Meteorology, located about 5
km from the experiment area.

Statistical analysis

The effects of N fertilizers on accumulated CH4
and N2O emission and on the N2O emission peak were

evaluated by orthogonal contrasts (p &amp;lt;10 %).  The
identification of the soil driving variables for CH4 and
N2O emission was performed by evaluating the
significance of determinant coefficients (R2) of
polynomial regression and multiple linear regressions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Soil N2O fluxes

The N2O emission from soil was remarkably
affected by N fertilization (Figure 1b, Tables 3 and 4).
In comparison to the unfertilized soil (control), N
fertilization rised the rates of N2O emission from soil
at about 4 to 400 times, reaching the upmost rates at
the third day after fertilization – which coincided with
WFPS values larger than 70 % (Figure 1a) and with
the largest NO3

--N and NH4+-N contents in the soil
(Figure 2a-b).  Despite the intensity, the N2O peak of
emission dropped sharply, reaching rates noticeably
smaller at only one day subsequent to the peak of
emission (mean for N-fertilized soils = 71.1 ?g m-2 h-1 N),
but sustaining greater rates than the mean of the
unfertilized soil (15.0 ?g m-2 h-1 N) up to the 12th day
(see detail in Figure 1b).

Several studies have depicted the occurrence of
peaks in N2O emission following N fertilization
(Clayton et al., 1997; Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Venterea
et al., 2005).  In Brazil, a pioneer study performed in
the Northern region documented increases of N2O
emission rates at 15 to 18 times in an Ultisol after
NO3

--N based fertilization (Steudler et al., 2002).
However, in an Oxisol of the Cerrado region, a recent
study did not evidence increases in N2O emissions
after the application of 60 kg ha-1 of urea, which was
attributed to the low water content in the soil at that
moment (Carvalho et al., 2006), possibly enhanced by
the fast drainage of that soil.

The sources of N fertilizers affected, in distinct
magnitudes, the peak of N2O emission from the soil
(Figure 1b).  The application of nitric forms promoted
the largest N2O emission rates (8,587.4 and
3,485.8 ?g m-2 h-1 N for ammonium nitrate and
calcium nitrate, respectively).  The N2O emission for
ammonium sulphate- and urea-amended soils peaked
at 1,435.3 and 859.1 ?g m-2 h-1 N, respectively
(Figure 1b), while the smallest peaks of emission rates
were found from soils amended with controlled-release
N (187.8 ?g m-2 h-1 N) and with urea with urease
inhibitor (346.4 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  The Uran fertilizer,
composed of a mix of urea and ammonium nitrate,
fostered peaks of intermediate intensity in comparison
to the application of these sources individually
(2,050.7 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  Although statistically similar,
the smaller N2O emission due to urea amendment
than ammonium sulphate might be due to the possibly
larger loss of nitrogen by volatilization, which would
diminish the NH4+-N and NO3

--N generation and
their outcomes on N2O emission.

Larger N2O emission rates have been described
following ammonium nitrate application than for other
mineral N sources (Clayton et al., 1997; Maggiotto et
al., 2000; Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Venterea et al., 2005).
The magnitude of the emissions in these reports,
however, were usually smaller than the emissions
herein depicted, though large rates – similar to the
current study – were already documented by
Maggiotto et al. (2000) for soils under pasture with
ryegrass in raining years (7.528 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  In the
current study, the large N2O emissions subsequent
to nitric-N fertilization were likely exacerbated by
associated effects of rain occurrence in the beginning
of the evaluation period, poor drainage of the soil and

the elevated water table.  Such combination of factors,
that nourished anoxic conditions due to the large
values of WFPS, associated to the great soil contents
of NO3

--N remarkably accentuated the N loss as N2O.
In other types of soils with similar physical and
chemical attributes and under analogous climatic
conditions, it is possible that the N2O emissions would
be smaller than those obtained in this study.  The
particular features of the Gleysol regarding the
drainage and the proximity to the water table
determines the presence of a distinguished microbial
population, which is tipical for the frequent anoxic
and reduced conditions of these soils and would not
dominate in soils under better drainage status.  For

the larger emissions in ammonium nitrate-amended
soils than calcium nitrate, in addition to the elevated
NO3

--N contents and WFPS values, the counter
ammonium ion possibly favoured the soils biological
activity, especially in the presence of great quantity
of crop residues with a high C/N ratio, which in turn
possibly increased the oxygen consumption and
enhanced the soil anaerobiosis condition (Baggs et al.
2003), favouring the N2O generation by denitrification.

The N2O emission on the third day after N
application, apart from the treatments with
ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate, had a close
relation to the NO3

--N contents in the soil (Equation 1,
p &amp;lt;0.08), but the inclusion of NH4+ contents to a
multiple linear regression markedly decreased the
significance (Equation 2, p &amp;lt;0.17).  Such results
indicate that denitrification was the major process
for N2O generation in the current study, where the
NO3

--N content by itself explained 56 % of the N2O
emission and the NH4+-N content in addition to NO3

-

-N improved the relationship in only 13 % (R2 = 0.69).
Other evidence for the importance of the denitrification
process to the N2O emission in this study was the
values of coefficients in the multiple linear equation
(Equation 2), indicating that the increase in one unit
of soil NO3

--N content promoted increases in N2O
emission threefold larger than the increase of one unit
of NH4+-N soil content (50.9/16.8 = 3.02), considering
the other variables steady.

Two main reasons, which do not exclude each other,
might explain the absence of relationship between N2O
emission and fertilization with ammonium nitrate and
calcium nitrate.  Firstly, the soil NO3

--N contents
may have surpassed the soil capacity of response in
increases of N2O emission under the conditions of that
soil.  This hypothesis was already conjectured by
Moreira &amp;amp; Siqueira (2006), when the authors theorized
that intense N2O fluxes can occur independently of
nitrate contents in soils with NO3

--N &gt; 20 mg L-1.
The second reason is that, for fertilized soils, the N2O
generation from denitrification may be hampered by
the availability of labile carbon in the soil, irrespective
of the nitrate content (Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith, 2003).  This
aspect is particularly important to calcium nitrate,
wherein denitrification is the only process for N2O
generation.

Several studies suggest that denitrification is the
major process related to N2O emission from soils,
mainly under large water content conditions (Dobbie
&amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Liu et al., 2007).  Under these

favourable conditions and in fertilized soils, Batemam
&amp;amp; Baggs (2005) estimated that the N2O amount
generated from denitrification was fivefold greater
than from nitrification.  In this context, many studies
reported that the use of ammonium- and/or amidic-
based N fertilizers instead of nitric-based sources in
humid soils or in applications followed by rainfall or
irrigation is an effective strategy to decrease the N2O
emissions from such soils (Clayton et al., 1997;
Maggiotto et al., 2000; Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Jones
et al., 2005), in addition to the split rate application of
the N fertilizer (Wolschick et al., 2003; COMISSÃO...,
2004).

The relatively small peak intensities of N2O
emission from the soils amended with urease inhibitor
urea and controlled-release N evidence their potencial
as alternative sources efficient to diminish the N2O
emissions credited to N fertilizations (Figure 1b),
corroborating the previous results of Zaman et al.
(2008).  The urease inhibitor presence and the
restriction from the protective layer against water
entrance around the fertilizer postpone and decrease
the NH4+ concentration in the soil, restraining the
nitrification and, consequently, the denitrification
process.  However, oppositely to the expected results,
the NH4+ contents in the soil amended with these N
sources were as large as those from the soil amended
with normal urea, suggesting that the product did
not hamper the urea hydrolysis to NH4+ at the soil
humidity conditions of the experiment.  Therefore,
the smaller N2O emissions from soils of these
treatments were not necessarily due to the effects of
the urease inhibitor or due to the controlled-release of
N, but were probably attributed to the lesser
nitrification rate of NH4+ in conditions of large soil
humidity.  Batemam &amp;amp; Baggs (2005) reported a liquid
nitrification of NH4+ of about 1 mg kg-1 d-1 N in soil
with 70 % WFPS.  Similarly, Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith (2003)
did not observe effects of urease inhibitor on NH4+
contents in the soil, reporting inclusively greater
contents than in normal urea-amended soil for most
evaluation events, which resulted in similar N2O
emissions.  In the case of the controlled-release N,
Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith (2003) found smaller, but consistent,
NH4+ concentrations in the soil than the normal urea,
which implied a greater emission due to the long term
emission.  Maggiotto et al. (2000), in a study of
controlled-release N for three years, observed that the
effect was distinct according to the year.  Therefore, in
spite of the promised results from the current study
regarding the use of urea with urease inhibitor and
the controlled-release N, the potential of such products
in decreasing N2O emissions must be systematically
investigated before their recommendation for large scale.

Concerning the accumulated N2O emission for the
period (15 days), the use of nitric-based N fertilizers
resulted in the emission of 3.70, 1.54 and 1.04 kg ha-1 N
for ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate and Uran,
respectively (Table 4), which were larger than the
emissions imparted from the other N sources (0.20 to

0.68 kg ha-1 N).  The N2O emissions from nitric-N
fertilizers corresponded to 2.46, 1.03 and 0.69 % of
the total N applied to the soil for ammonium nitrate,
calcium nitrate and Uran, respectively.  The
application of ammonium sulphate and urea, however,
resulted in the loss of only 0.45 and 0.32 %,
respectively.  These results point that, for conditions
favourable to denitrification (large WFPS), the N2O
emissions imparted from the addition of ammonium-
or amidic-based fertilizer exclusively were about 50 %
smaller than from nitric-based ones.  The
accumulated N2O emissions following the application
of urease inhibitor and controlled-release N forms were
smaller than for ammonium sulphate and urea
(Tables 3 and 4).  Application of urea+urease inhibitors
resulted in accumulated emission of 0.22 % of the total
N applied (0.38 kg ha-1 N), while the controlled-release
N achieved an accumulated emission of 0.13 %
(0.25 kg ha-1 N).

The range of N2O emission from soils in literature
is wide and is strongly affected by the source and rate
of fertilization, as well as by climate and soil
characteristics (Clayton et al., 1997).  The emissions
found in the present study, however, can be considered
as large, since the relative losses of N through N2O
emission for only 15 days of evaluation are similar to
annual losses from soils following application of nitric
sources of N fertilizers (0.4 to 3.1 %), ammonium-
based fertilizers (0.2 to 0.4 %), amidic-based fertilizers
(0.24 to 0.8 %) and with microbial activity inhibitor
(0.1 to 0.52 %) (Bouwman, 1996; Maggiotto et al.,
2000; Dobbie &amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Jones et al., 2005).  One
factor that can explain the large N2O emissions of
the current study is the probable anoxic condition of
the soil due to its poor drainage exacerbated by the
rainfall occurrence in the period subsequent to the N
application (Figure 1).

Soil CH4 fluxes

The soil CH4 fluxes were affected by the sources of
N fertilizer applied to the corn, but the magnitude of
such fluxes were up to 300 times smaller than those
for N2O (Figures 1b and 3).  The CH4 fluxes ranged
from an influx of -30.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C to efflux of
+32.5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (Figure 3).  Such values represent
the difference between the methanogenesis and
methanotrophy processes in the soil.  The range in
the CH4 flux rates was thinner than that cited by
Veldkamp et al. (1998) in Costa Rica soils under
fertilization (-62.5 to +250 ?g m-2 h-1 C-CH4).  In Brazil,
flux rates of -20.8 to + 54.2 ?g m-2 h-1 C-CH4 for high
lands of the Mid-West region cultivated with non-
flooded rice (Metay et al., 2007) and of -40 to +62 ?g m-
2 h-1 C-CH4 of corn-cultivated soils in the Southern
region (Gomes, 2006) were documented.  Despite the
relatively small rates of influx of CH4 in agriculture
soils in general, the negative fluxes evidence the
occurrence of methanotrophy in such soils and
highlight that, even for mineral N-fertilized soils, the

agriculture soils have the potential to act as sinks of
atmospheric CH4, through the CH4 oxidation to CO2.

The biggest oscillation in CH4 flux rates in soil
were verified in the first week after N application
(Figure 3).  Rates increased markedly (60 to 194 %)
in one day after N application in comparison to the
unfertilized soil (Figure 3) and were closely and
directly related to the NH4+ contents in the soil
(Equation 3).

   CH4 1st day (?g m-2 h-1 C) = -23.3 + 0.39 NH4+      (3)
R2 = 0.65;   p &amp;lt;0.02

The soil NH4+ contents were significantly large in
this first week of evaluation (&gt; 40 mg kg-1 N in soil)
when compared to the control, inclusively in soils that
received N fertilizers containing solely nitrate
(Figure 2a,b), presumably due to their effect in
increasing the rates of soil organic matter
mineralization.  The relationship between CH4 fluxes
and NH4+ contents is attributed to the inhibitory effect
of NH4+ on the methanotrophy process, responsible
for the CH4 oxidation in the soil (Hüstch, 1998).
According to Hütsch (1996), this effect is very effective
and decreases larger than 30 % in the CH4 oxidation
rates can be detected only three hours after N
application to the soil.  The inhibitory mechanism of
NH4+ on CH4 influx is complex and involves both the
enzymatic competition for the methane monooxygenase
enzyme (Kravchencko et al., 2002) and the toxic effect
of composts generated during nitrification
(hydroxylamine and nitrite) on methanotrophic

microrganisms (Hütsch, 1998).  Accordingly to
Kravechencko et al. (2002), NH4+ concentrations
greater than 40 mg kg-1 N are sufficient to trigger
the inhibitory effect on the soil CH4 oxidation.  When
the soil NH4+ avalilability is large, the methanotrophic
bacteria activity changes to the NH4+ oxidation in
detriment of CH4 oxidation, because the CH4
monooxygenase enzyme has low specificity for its
substrate (Hütsch, 2001).  This behavior determines,
temporarily, greater liquid emission of CH4 from the
soil, but the effect can persist for days, mainly if
associated to the maintenance of large NH4+ contents
in the soil.

From the third day on, in addition to the NH4+
contents, the CH4 emission was likely impacted by
the WFPS, when the values reached 75 % on this date
(Figura 1).  While NH4+ is responsible for the
methanotrophy decrease due to the enzymatic
competition previously discussed, the larger values of
WFPS make the CH4 diffusion from the soil difficult
and are responsible for the generation of anoxic
microsites in the soil, which in turn increase the
methanogenesis occurrence (Kessavalou et al., 1998).

After the seventh day of N application, the
differences in CH4 influx/efflux rates in the soil among
the N sources decreased and, from this moment, liquid
influx predominated, with rates ranging from -4.4 to
-10.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C, likely related to the decrease in
WFPS (&gt; 60 %) and in soil NH4+ contents (Figures
1a and 3a-b).  The decreasing effect on soil CH4
oxidation is usually short term and completely
reversible (Dunfield &amp;amp; Knowles, 1995).  In laboratory
studies, Hüstch (1998) observed a gradual
recomposition in the oxidation capacity after five days
of fertilization, joined by the decrease in the soil NH4+
contents.  However, in field experiment, Veldkamp et
al. ( 1998) reported the regress of CH4 oxidation rates
to the original values only after three weeks of
fertilization.  According to Hüstch (2001), if conditions
of low temperature, great soil water content and
frequent fertilization persist for long term, the decrease
in the soil CH4 oxidation capacity can became
irreversible due to damages in the methanotrophic
population.  This long term effect is mainly detected
when oxidation rates of agricultural soils are compared
to adjacent soils under natural pastures and forests.
In forest soils, CH4 oxidation rates in general are
substantially greater than in agriculture soils due to
the absence of N fertilization (Hüstch, 2001).

The mean accumulated CH4 emission for the N-
amended soils was significantly larger (60 %) than
for the non-amended soil (Table 3), which summed
an influx of -45.1 g ha-1 C in the 15 day period of
evaluation (Table 4).  The calcium nitrate (-29.2 g ha-1
C) and urea (-26.3 g ha-1 C) application promoted the
smallest injurious effects of mineral N fertilizers on
the soil CH4 oxidation and were followed by ammonium
nitrate (-21.8 g ha-1 C) and urea with urease inhibitor
(-12.4 g ha-1 C).  The greatest increases in the CH4

liquid emission in comparison to the non-amended soil
were found for ammonium sulphate (100 %), uran and
controlled-release N (75 %) (Table 4).

The increase in the accumulated CH4 emission for
the period had direct and close relation with the soil
NH4+ content (Figure 4).  Mosier et al. ( 1991) were
the first authors to describe the suppressive effect of
NH4+ on methanotrophy, after of the observation that
the application of 22 kg ha-1 N as ammonium nitrate
decreased the CH4 influx of a pasture soil in 41 % in
comparison to the non fertilized soil.  Veldkamp et al.
( 1998) also reported that ammonium sulphate was
the N fertilizer that nourished the biggest decrease
in the CH4 oxidation rate in the soil (60 % in
comparison to calcium nitrate and urea).

In addition the great soil NH4+ contents, another
factor that can contribute to the increase in CH4
emission from soils fertilized with ammonium sulphate
is the decrease in soil pH.  This fertilizer has acid
reaction in the soil and, in the present study, promoted
a decrease in soil pH in 0.3 units, at average for the
period of evaluation (Figure 2e-f).  In addition to the
direct effect on the methanotrophic population, the
pH decrease also prolongs the period recquired for the
nitrification of the NH4+ applied to the soil, as
nitrification rates are smaller in low pH soil (Moreira
&amp;amp; Siqueira, 2006).

Environmental impact from N fertilizers
concerning greenhouse gases emission

The environmental impact of N fertilizers must
take into account the N2O and CH4 emissions from
the soil, as well as the emissions of all GHG (“costs in
CO2”) involved with the manufacture, transport and
application of the fertilizers.  In table 4, the N2O and
CH4 emissions from soil are represented in quantities

Figure 4. Relationship between accumulated flux of
CH4 (g ha

-1 C) and mean contents of ammonium
(mg N kg-1) in the soil for the 15 day period after

of equivalent CO2-C based on the global warming
potential of N2O (296) and CH4 (23) in comparison to
CO2 (IPCC, 2007) and the costs in CO2 of the N
fertilizers application (150 kg ha-1 N) equivalent to
195 kg ha-1 C-CO2, which were estimated from the
coefficient of emission of 1.3 kg CO2-C kg-1 N, as
suggested by Lal (2004).

The magnitude of N2O and CH4 emissions, in
equivalent CO2-C, highlights that the environmental
impact from N2O emission from soil was markedly
larger than that from CH4 emission (Table 4).  For
the average among the treatments, the liquid CH4
emission was equivalent to 0.2 kg ha-1 CO2-C, which
corresponded to about 500 times smaller than the
mean for N2O emission (132.8 kg ha-1 CO2-C).  Among
the N-amended soils, the N2O emission range was
equivalent to the emission of 31.9 to 476.3 kg ha-1
CO2-C (Table 4).  After summing the emission of both
gases and the mean cost of the fertilizers in CO2-C
(195 kg ha-1 CO2-C), the mineral N fertilization
promoted total emissions of 220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-
C equivalent to atmosphere (Table 4).  The nitric-based
fertilizers had emissions larger than 326 kg ha-1
CO2-C.

Taking into account these values, it is possible to
infer that the effect of N fertilization on the
enhancement in the soil organic matter stocks due to
their increase in biomass production can only partially
counterbalance the harmful impact on GHG emissions
to the atmosphere (220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-C).  In
studies carried out in the South of Brazil, the
uppermost rate of annual C accumulation in soil due
to N fertilization was 160 kg ha-1 CO2-C (Zanatta et
al., 2007; Weber, 2008).  Oppositely, however, the
results point out that there are possibilities to
minimize the N2O emissions decurrent from mineral
N fertilization and that, under large water content in
soil, this goal can be achieved by using ammonium-
and amidic-based fertilizers in detriment of nitric
sources.  This potential can be even better exploited if
controlled-release N and urea with urease inhibitor
are adopted.  Complementing these alternatives, it is
worthy of mentioning that the adequate moment of
application and the adoption of split rates are key
strategies for maximizing the efficiency of nutrient use.

CONCLUSIONS

1. The use of N fertilizers intensified the N2O
emissions from the Gleysol evaluated in this study.
The nitric-based sources promoted larger N2O
emissions under soil conditions of large water-filled
pore space and denitrification was the main process
involved in the gas generation. Ammonium- and
amidic-based fertilizers represented better alternatives
for decreasing the N2O emission in this poor drained
soil, as well as the controlled-release N and the urea
with urease inhibitor.

2. Nitrogen fertilization increased the CH4
emission from the soil, but the magnitude of CH4
fluxes in consequence of N fertilization was several
hundred times smaller than the N2O fluxes from soil.
The environmental impact from such increases in CH4
emissions due to nitrogen fertilization, therefore, was
of low significance.

3. The main driving variables controlling the N2O
emission in the Gleysol were the nitrate content in
soil and the water-filled pore space, while the NH4+-N
content was the main driving variable for the CH4
emission from soil. For both gases, the main injurious
effect of N fertilizer application to the soil on their
emissions was ephemeral.
