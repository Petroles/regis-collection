RESUMO

E? apresentado um estudo para determinar a resiste?ncia de uma barcac?a empregada
no transporte de carga que poderia operar no setor baixo do rio Magdalena. Os efeitos
hidrodina?micos de um navio em a?guas rasas sa?o muito diferentes, comparados a esses
efeitos em a?guas com profundidade infinita.

A ana?lise hidrodina?mica e? realizada numericamente usando a Dina?mica dos Fluidos
Computacional (CFD, acro?nimo em ingle?s). A soluc?a?o das equac?o?es de Navier-Stokes
(NS) junto com a decomposic?a?o do Reynolds (RANS, acro?nimo em ingle?s) e? aplicada
para simular os efeitos viscosos e de pressa?o em torno de um tanque e de uma embarcac?a?o
em um tanque confinado que e? caracterizado pelos efeitos do fundo e das paredes. Para
efeitos de turbule?ncia, o modelo realizado k-? e? usado. O movimento da embarcac?a?o do
rio provoca elevac?o?es da superf??cie livre que sa?o capturadas usando o me?todo do Volume
de Fluido (VOF, acro?nimo em ingle?s). Para a discretizac?a?o do dom??nio de fluxo, o Me?todo
dos Volumes Finitos (FVM, acro?nimo em ingle?s) e? utilizado. O movimento dos fluidos e?
atualizado para cada intervalo de tempo o que permite o ca?lculo da resiste?ncia atuando
no casco.

Os resultados da simulac?a?o nume?rica sa?o comparados com dados experimentais obti-
dos pelo Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnolo?gicas do Estado de Sa?o Paulo (IPT), juntamente
com os me?todos emp??ricos existentes para esse tipo de casos.

ABSTRACT

The subject of this study is the determination of the resistance of an inland vessel
engaged in cargo transport in the lower course of the Magdalena River, considering that
the hydrodynamic effects in shallow water navigation are very different compared to the
effects in deep water navigation.

The hydrodynamic analysis is realized numerically using Computational Fluid Dy-
namics (CFD). The Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) solver is applied
to simulate viscous and pressure effects around a tank and a hull in confined tank consid-
ering the wall bottom and side effects in shallow water navigation. For turbulence effects,
realizable k-? model is used. The motion of the vessel causes elevations of the free surface,
in which, is captured using the Volume of Fluid method (VOF). For discretization of flow
domain, the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is applied. The motion of the fluids is updated
for each time step that allows the calculation of the resistance acting on the hull.

The numerical simulation results are compared with experimental data obtained by
the Technological Research Institute of the State of Sa?o Paulo (IPT, acronym in Por-
tuguese) together with the existing empirical methods for this type of cases.

Keywords: CFD, Free surface flow, FVM, Inland vessel, k-? turbulence model, Mag-
dalena River, RANS, Resistance, Restricted waterways, VOF.

1 INTRODUCTION

“A universal constant has been the development of people, civilizations and

diverse cultures around the main river, which dispenses gift and natural re-

sources, provides identity, offering its landscape, becomes a witness to its his-

tory and is a generator of life”, Bernal Duffo (2013).

At the time of the European conquest of the Americas, the Spanish arrived at the

Colombian territory. The Magdalena river was discovered and named by Rodrigo de

Bastidas at the beginning of 16th century (specifically on April 1st in 1501) and gained

great importance as a main access route. During the colonization period, the river served

as a single route between Santa Fe? de Bogota? (actually Bogota?) and the port of Cartagena

(Bernal Duffo, 2013).

During the independence period, the patriotic armies used the river to dominate the

Spanish colony. Gabriel Garcia Marquez described these events in his historical novel The

General in His Labyrinth.

As far as the logistics are concerned, the fluvial transport was used from the colonial

period until the middle of 19th century for the transport of commercial products which

were transported in keel-boats. In 1822, steamboats were introduced, and the harvest of

tobacco in 1850s made the river transport more profitable. Nevertheless in 20th century,

the commercial activities of the river for the transport of commercial goods started to

decline due to the air services, the railway transport and mainly, the road transportation

(Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015d).

With the aim of increasing the activities of the river, the Colombian Constitution of

1991 created the Magdalena Grand River Corporation (Cormagdalena, acronym in Span-

ish) and since then, the fluvial transport has been recovering due to projects developed

or being developed that imply the navigability of the river that includes, the construction

of ports, dredging works and the maintenance of the river. Nowadays, the cargoes are

transported in convoys, each of which consists of a tugboat and a maximum of six barges



2

organized in series and/or in parallel.

In 2017, 3.67 million tons of a large variety of goods, including hydrocarbons and dry

cargoes such as coal and cement, were mobilized by the river. This signify an increase of

68.5% compared to the numbers of the previous year (Ministry of Transport - Colombia,

2018).

There are different types of inland vessel (Bureau Voorlichting Binnenvaart, n.d.):

dry-cargo carriers, well barges, tank vessels, push/tugboats and ro-ro.

The Magdalena River is the most important in the country with an extension of

1,497 km and its birthplace is located in the Pa?ramo de las Papas (placed in the Andes

mountain range). This river is divided in three courses: upper, middle and lower (Figure

1.1), crossing 128 municipalities and 11 departments. The river receives the affluents of

the San Jorge, Cesar and Cauca rivers, increasing its flow. Finally, the river mouths in the

Caribbean Sea and close to Barranquilla city (ACOSTA-LOPERA; CABRERA-TOVAR,

2014; Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015d). The area under the influence of the Magdalena

river is responsible for 80% of GDP of the country, 70% of the hydraulic energy, 95% of

the thermoelectricity, 70% of agricultural production, 50% of freshwater fishing (Castro

Pinzo?n, 2017).

Compared to other countries, the Netherlands is a pioneer in this type of transport,

since its canal system is based on large natural rivers. For example, to transport a cargo

of 16,000 tons, 660 trucks are needed for road transport, while only one inland barge

can transport the total of that cargo and the Dutch operators take advantage of these

numbers as the riverboats under the Dutch flag that is represented around 50% of the

entire Western European fleet. Furthermore, the importance of the rivers in Netherlands is

obvious as 6,000 km of a total of 24,709 km of the European waterways are Dutch, where

500 km are main routes (Bureau Voorlichting Binnenvaart, 2011; ACOSTA-LOPERA;

CABRERA-TOVAR, 2014; Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015a).

The fluid mechanics allow the study of the fluids at rest (stationary ) and, mainly,

in motion (dynamic). The last term is called Fluid Dynamics. The fundamental mathe-

matical equations describe the physical characteristics of the fluid motion. The solution

of the math equations is converted in a high-level computer programming language into

computer programs applying numerical methods and is called computer science. These

disciplines integrate the branch of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), illustrated

in the Figure 1.2 (TU; YEOH; LIU, 2008).

The numerical methods imply the comparison and the validation of the experimen-

tal test and theoretical analysis, indicated in the Figure 1.3. The theoretical analysis

allows the designer predicts the behavior for a case. The experimental test simulates

the environmental and physical conditions in reduced scale. In the Table 1.1, extracted

from Pletcher, Tannehill and Anderson (2013), the strategies to solve problems of fluid

mechanics are compared. Over the years, the speed of computer processing has been in-

creasing contrary to computational costs, illustrated in the Figure 1.4. This makes them

more efficient, therefore, has generated interest for the application in CFD. The computer

performance is measured in Gflop/s.

Despite the advantages and disadvantages offered by CFD, it still cannot resolve a

lot of problems, i.e., turbulent flow cases. When the Navier-Stokes equations are used

numerically, the turbulent behavior is not represented directly, therefore the need for

the adoption of turbulent models from the original equations. However, there are exist

turbulence models that allow resolve this type of flows.

1.1 Presentation of the problem

The need to improve efficiency of cargo transport sector had motivated the increase

in the number of self-propelled vessels in the main river of the country, allowing the direct

access of companies located inland to the main ports of the Colombian northern regions.

Despite the economic advantages of cargo transport by river for the national econ-

omy, resulted from the reduction of freight rates and costs of exportation, the road trans-

portation remains the main transport system in Colombia where factors, such as poor

conservation and the weather conditions makes this transport mode very expensive and

inefficient.

The elaboration of inland vessel projects ends up being a local regional or national

problem since it depends on the conditions in the waterway, the route and the market

in which the vessel will operate, as well as, other factors such as mission, cargo capacity

and autonomy. The physical characteristics of the river and the aspects of the shallow

water effects (as draft and beam restrictions, crossing ships in restricted spaces, radius

of curvature of the river, locks) are important for the execution of the project. In this

project, the type of inland vessel will be designed for dry-cargo carrier, well barge and

tank vessel.

1.2 Objectives

The objective of this work is the study of the resistance of a 2700 TDW inland vessel

self-propelled by CFD numerical simulation and the validation and comparison of the

numerical results with the existing empirical formulas and the experimental test results.

The following specific objectives are proposed during development of this objective:

? Understanding of the phenomena involving fluid flow along the inland vessel hull in

shallow waters;

? Modeling of the 2700 TDW inland vessel hull using the CAD software FREE!Ship

and Rhinoceros ;

? Numerical simulation of the 2700 TDW inland vessel hull using CFD software STAR-

CCM+.

? Application of the grid convergence criteria for the choosing the number of elements

that it will simulate the resistance and calculation of the properties of the inland

vessel.

The study is divided in 6 chapters:

? Chapter 1 is the introduction of this study, where the presentation of the problem

and the objectives are presented.

? Chapter 2 presents the state of art, including important references.

? Chapter 3 explains the empirical method for the estimation of the inland vessel

resistance. For this purpose, the empirical formulations for the velocity loss cal-

culation of the vessel in shallow water using Schlichting, Landweber, Lackenby for

large rivers, as well as, the empirical formulations for middle rivers, where the ef-

fective velocities calculation applying the Karpov’s diagrams and the correction of

wall effect by Artjushkov are used.

? The resistance estimation applying CFD is the main topic of the chapters 4 and 5,

2 BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW

The calculation of the resistance is based on Froude Hypothesis that is composed

by frictional and residual resistances, where are expressed by the frictional and residual

coefficients, wetted surface of the hull, velocity of the vessel and water density. ITTC

(1957) established an equation for the frictional resistance coefficient. Guldhammer and

Harvald (1974) created diagrams for the calculation of the residuary resistance coeffi-

cient. Georgakaki and Sorenson (2004) demonstrated that the resistance coefficient can

be extrapolated providing reasonable results.

Considering the effects of shallow waters, Molland, Turnock and Hudson (2011) ex-

plained the wave generating phenomena for the resistance calculation. Latorre, Luthra

and Tang (1982) presented the empirical methods of study for inland vessels applied to

European and American vessels. ITTC (1987) considered some typical parameters to esti-

mate the waterway restriction in shallow water. Pompe?e (2015) reviewed many empirical

methods to determine the resistance of the ship depending on the type of vessel (pushed

convoy or self-propelled), as well as, the physical conditions of a river (small, medium and

large). In this study is explained only empirical formulations for medium and large rivers.

For large rivers and sea access channels, Schlichting (1934) presented the analysis of

shallow water effects through experimental test and theoretical considerations, without

influence of walls in a towing tank. Landweber (1939) improved this work, proposing the

hydraulic radius. Lackenby (1963) simplified the semi-empirical formula of the velocity

loss proposed by Schlichting.

In case of medium rivers, the effects of the shallow water are different. Karpov (1946)

interpreters these phenomena with effective velocities for frictional and residual resis-

tances that can be determined through two diagrams proposed by him. Artjushkov (1968)

improved this work correcting the wall effects. Georgakaki and Sorenson (2004) demon-

strated that these diagrams and the correction of the wall effects would be extrapolated,

and they proposed equations for the approximation of these parameters.



10

For small rivers, the calculation of the inland vessel resistance is associated with the

existence of a limited velocity in restricted waterways that cannot exceed, where could

be caused by a steep ship resistance rise. Schijf (1949) studied this limit velocity that

corresponds for lower critical velocity (also called subcritical velocity). Pompe?e (2015)

made the analytical theories for confined waters using two methods: energy method by

Schijf (1949, 1953); and quantity of movement methods by Bouwmeester et al. (1977)

and CNR (SAVEY, 1977; TENAUD, 1977; POMMIER; SELMI, 1981). These analytical

theories are complemented for the Schlichting’s formulation.

The numerical calculation of the hydrodynamic flow of the inland vessel was based on

references that influenced this study. From the conservation of mass to the conservation

of momentum, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are the basis of the description of fluid

motion. Euler (1755) initiated this work for incompressible fluids and non-friction flows,

Navier (1822) analyzed the friction effects for viscous fluids and Stokes (1845) improved

this work completing the solution.

Reynolds (1895) introduced the time-averaging of the flow for turbulent effects, defin-

ing the decomposition of a mean and fluctuating parts of a variable. This is applied

to the NS equations and is called Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).

The choice of the turbulence model is necessary. Launder and Spalding (1972) were the

first to introduce the standard k-? model. This model was refined and is called RNG

(Re-Normalization Group methods) k-? model, and it was developed by Yakhot et al.

(1992). Later, Shih et al. (1995) improved the turbulence model and is called Realizable

k-?. Wilcox (1988) published another turbulent model denominated standard k-?. To im-

prove k-? model, Menter (1993) developed the baseline (BSL, also called BSL k-? model)

which was later refined for the transport of the turbulence shear stress and is called Shear

Stress Transport (SST) k-? model.

Noh and Woodward (1976), and Hirt and Nichols (1981) developed the Volume of

Fluid method (VOF) to track and locate the free-surface. This method is based on

Marker-and-cell method (MAC).

The interpolation of the convection term is used in the transport equation applied to

Finite Volume Method (FVM). Courant, Isaacson and Rees (1952), and independently,

Gentry, Martin and Daly (1966); Barakat and Clark (1966); and Runchal and Wolfshtein

(1969) introduced the 1st order upwind scheme. Another type of interpolation is the

2nd order upwind scheme, started by Warming and Beam (1976), and Hodge, Stone and

Miller (1979) for finite difference discretization.

Patankar and Spalding (1972) introduced the iterative method called the The Semi-

Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm to resolve the linear

pressure-velocity couple.

2.1 Important references

The following references are of high importance in this study.

2.1.1 Celik et al. (2008)

Their work resulted in the development of the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) that is

used in the estimation and report of uncertainty results in CFD applications. The method

is based on the Richardson (1910) Extrapolation (RE) and is only applied to unstructured

volume domain. The authors justified that, if the user chooses to use it, this method shall

not be questioned. On the other hand, if the user chooses another method, this method

shall be judged in the review process. However, the authors do not desire to discourage

further development of new methods. This method is simple, justified and accepted, and

is used in this study for the validation of the simulation results.

2.1.2 ITTC (2014)

The ITTC creates a guideline, comprising of recommendations and practices regard-

ing the applications of CFD methods that is divided in three steps: pre-processing, com-

putation, and post-processing. The geometry of the hull, the volume domain and the

computational grid are defined during the pre-processing step. At computational step,

the governing equations to be solved are chosen. The visualization, analysis, verification

and validation of the results belong to the post-processing step.

In this study, some of the values recommended in the guideline are adopted and

applied to the equations. One of these recommended values is the wall y+, applied on the

wall of the hull for the creation of the boundary layer in the grid mesh, which the ITTC

provides a range of possible options, among which the user shall choose the specific for

the purpose of the study. Later, the distance y of the first layer is calculated. The ITTC

(1957) established the formulation for the frictional resistance coefficient that is explained

in the next chapter.

According to ITTC (2014), this is important because the value of wall y+ should be



12

checked a posteriori once the solution is obtained. In this project, the wall y+ is simulated

for the wall hull surface and the wall bottom plane in the computational domain.

2.1.3 Ji et al. (2012)

Their work is the study of prediction of the relationship between the geometrical and

the kinematic parameters of the convoy and the amplitude of ship generated waves in

restricted waterways. The authors used numerical simulations, solving the 3-D Navier-

Stokes, along with the standard k-? for turbulent.

In this paper, the calculation of the grid size in x direction is defined and the transver-

sal wave length ? is estimated. Once is done, the value of ? is divided by 10 points, as

the authors recommend, obtaining the grid size.

2.1.4 Linde et al. (2017)

Their work consists in the evaluation of the ship resistance in restricted waterways

with effects of ship sinkage and trim. The RANS solver coupled with a quasi-Newton

approach is used to find the equilibrium position and the calculation of the ship sinkage.

The numerical simulation results are validated with towing tank tests and some empirical

models.

In this study, the GCI method for grid convergence will be used with a constant

refinement ratio

rk =
?

2. (2.1)

2.1.5 Liu et al. (2017)

The authors evaluated the inland vessel resistance in confined waters. The effect of

squat is analyzed. They used the RANS equations to simulate the viscous flow around

the hull in a confined tank characterized by shallow sea bottom and close side walls.

In this study, computational domain is adopted, as illustrated in the Figure 2.1.

Dimensions extend by 1.5LWL from the bow to the inlet plane, 3.5LWL from stern to

the outlet plane and 0.33LWL from the free surface to the top plane. Additionally, the

meshing volume is configured and modified, as shown in Figure 2.2. The grid mesh in the

vicinity of the free surface, hull, the tank bottom and the banks are refined. The prism

layer is used at the bottom boundary condition, with wall y+ larger than 30; at the hull



13

surface, wall y+ is smaller than 1 in order to obtain a more precise flow field simulation

near the vessel.

Some configurations of the boundary conditions are adopted. The velocity inlet is set

on the inlet and top plane. The pressure outlet is set on the outlet plane. The symmetry

condition is set on the symmetry plane. The wall condition is set on the rest of the planes,

including the hull.

For the estimation of the numerical error and uncertainty about the results follow-

ing the grid discretization, the GCI is only applied to grid convergence with a constant

refinement ration defined in the equation (2.1).

Results and Discussion 

Grid dependency study for KVLCC2  

The purpose of grid dependency study is to estimate the numerical error and uncertainty 
resulted from the grid discretization. In this paper, this study is conducted following the Grid

Results and Discussion 

Grid dependency study for KVLCC2  

The purpose of grid dependency study is to estimate the numerical error and uncertainty 
resulted from the grid discretization. In this paper, this study is conducted following the Grid 
Convergence Index(GCI) method [32]. It is applicable for unstructured grid and only requires 
the grid refinement to be done systematically. Therefore, all grid quantities are given as 
percentages in terms of a base size, in order to refine the grid in a more systematic way. The 
case of KVLCC2 at h=1.2T, 9.05B bank width and the 0.921m/s forward speedis chosen for 
the study. Only half of the computational domain is used to reduce the calculation cost. Three 
grid sets (coarse, medium and fine) are adopted in the study and the grid refinement is 
achieved by applying a refinement factor rG=?2 to the base size. The fine grid (No.1) consists 
of approximately 2.9M cells; the medium grid (No.2) contains about 1.3M; and about 0.69M 
in the coarse grid (No.3). The changes in solutions between two successive grids are defined

3 FUNDAMENTALS ON SHIP RESISTANCE

The vessel resistance is a force acting on the vessel during navigation at a given

velocity. The direction of this force is opposite to the direction of the motion. The

total resistance can be obtained through theoretical, experimental and computational

calculations. This chapter will define the basic components of the resistance. Following,

the resistance calculation methods will be described. Later, the shallow water effects will

be described considering that the resistance in depth water is different to the resistance

in deep water. Finally, the existing empirical methods will be contextualized.

3.1 Components of resistance

The total resistance is divided in basic components (shown in the Figures 3.1 and 3.2)

(HARVALD, 1983; MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON, 2011):

? Frictional resistance: frictional forces between water and hull surface due to tan-

gential shear forces in direction of motion.

? Pressure resistance: pressure force of water (normal forces) acting in the direction

of motion.

? Viscous resistance: is associated with the energy expended due to viscous effects.

? Wave-making resistance: is associated with the energy generated by gravity waves

during navigation.

? Viscous pressure resistance: is obtained by the integration of the components of the

normal stresses acting on the hull due to viscosity and turbulence.

The following list contains additional resistance components:

? Residuary resistance: Considering the Froude’s approach, the residuary resistance

can be obtained by subtracting the skin friction resistance from the total resistance.



16

? Wave-pattern resistance: is the resistance (deduced from measurements of wave

elevations) where the wave pattern at a point remote from the vessel or model, is

related, through a linearized theory, to the ship’s or model’s subsurface velocity

field and, therefore, the momentum of the fluid. This resistance does not include

wave-breaking resistance.

? Wave-breaking resistance: is associated with the breakdown of the vessel bow wave.

? Spray resistance: is associated with the energy loss resulting from the spray gener-

ation.

? Air resistance: is the resistance caused by the incident of wind/air on the vessel

during navigation.

? Steering resistance: is the resistance caused by the rudder.

These specific components are shown in the Figure 3.3, where is represented in total

resistance coefficient Ct giving as function of length Froude number FrL.

14 Ship Resistance and Propulsion

Figure 3.3. Measurement of total viscous resistance.

It should also be noted that each of the resistance components obeys a different

set of scaling laws and the problem of scaling is made more complex because of

interaction between these components.

A summary of these basic hydrodynamic components of ship resistance is shown

in Figure 3.4. When considering the forces acting, the total resistance is made up of

the sum of the tangential shear and normal pressure forces acting on the wetted

surface of the vessel, as shown in Figure 3.2 and at the top of Figure 3.4. When

considering energy dissipation, the total resistance is made up of the sum of the

energy dissipated in the wake and the energy used in the creation of waves, as shown

in Figure 3.1 and at the bottom of Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.5 shows a more detailed breakdown of the basic resistance compon-

ents together with other contributing components, including wave breaking, spray,

transom and induced resistance. The total skin friction in Figure 3.5 has been divided

into two-dimensional flat plate friction and three-dimensional effects. This is used to

illustrate the breakdown in respect to some model-to-ship extrapolation methods,

discussed in Chapter 4, which use flat plate friction data.

Wave breaking and spray can be important in high-speed craft and, in the case

of the catamaran, significant wave breaking may occur between the hulls at partic-

ular speeds. Wave breaking and spray should form part of the total wavemaking

Bernoulli’s theorem (see Appendix A1.5) states that P

+ h = H and, in

the absence of viscous forces, H is constant throughout the flow. By means of a

Pito?t tube, local total head can be measured. Since losses in total head are due to

viscous forces, it is possible to measure the total viscous resistance by measuring the

total head loss in the wake behind the hull, Figure 3.3.

This resistance will include the skin frictional resistance and part of the pressure

resistance force, since the total head losses in the flow along the hull due to viscous

forces result in a pressure loss over the afterbody which gives rise to a resistance due

to pressure forces.

(4) Total wave resistance

The wave pattern created by the hull can be measured and analysed into its

component waves. The energy required to sustain each wave component can be

estimated and, hence, the total wave resistance component obtained.

Thus, by physical measurement it is possible to identify the following methods

of breaking down the total resistance of a hull:

1. Pressure resistance + frictional resistance
2. Viscous resistance + remainder
3. Wave resistance + remainder

These three can be combined to give a final resistance breakdown as:

Total resistance = Frictional resistance
+ Viscous pressure resistance
+ Wave resistance

The experimental methods used to derive the individual components of resistance

are described in Chapter 7.

is the total resistance coefficient. Ct is defined as

Ct = Cr + Cf, (3.2)

where Cf and Cr are the frictional and the residuary resistance coefficients.

The International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) studied proposals in order to

Reynolds (1883) studied the characterization of the fluid motion in which used flow

criteria that indicate whether the flow is laminar, turbulent or at transition stage (Ency-

clopædia Britannica, 2015f). The Reynolds number is given by

where FrL is the length Froude number, ? is the vessel’s displacement, ? is the prismatic

can be determined by nine diagrams (see the Figures from A.1 to A.9) for LWL/? ratios

ranging from 4 to 8 at intervals of 0.5. Additionally, each diagram provides the mean

curves of Cr for ? between 0.5 and 8.0. The values of FrL are between 0.15 and 0.45.

The diagrams refer to a B/T ratio equal to 2.5 and were obtained through experimental

tests corresponding to ship models.

Georgakaki and Sorenson (2004) mentioned that the Guldhammer’s and Harvald’s

curves can extrapolate the values of Cr. In case of FrL lower than 0.15, is equal to the

The equation (3.7) is applicable to self-propelled vessels and convoys but does not applied

The Froude number Fr is the dimensionless quantity that indicates the influence

of gravity on fluid motion (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015c). In marine hydrodynamic

applications, this is important to calculate the ship resistance using length Froude number.

For shallow waters, is applied the depth Froude number that will be explained in the next

subsection. The length Froude number is determined by

3.2 Shallow water effects

The performance of a ship engaged in sea transport is different to the performance of

an inland vessel due to aspects such as cruising velocities, maneuverability, stability and

river’s/channel’s geographic morphology and infrastructure. The term “shallow water”

refers to the boundaries close to the ship in vertical and horizontal direction.

The principal effects of shallow waters are (MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON,

2011):

? Effective increase in velocity and backflow;

? Decrease in pressure under the hull;

? Significant changes in sinkage and trim;

? Increases in skin friction drag and wave resistance.

Shallow water effects are characterized by depth Froude number, related to the velocity

of the vessel ?? and the local depth of the river h, obtained by

Frh =
???
gh
. (3.23)

The vessel produces system waves which travel with velocities that depends on the

water depth h and the wave length ?. In deep water, when h/? ratio is large, the wave

velocity is defined as

c =

?
g?

2?
if
h

?

. (3.24)

In shallow water, when the value of this relationship is small,

c =

. (3.25)

The waves travel at the same velocity c as the velocity of the ship. In this case, c is known

as the critical velocity (MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON, 2011).

In the Figure 3.4, shows the wave patterns. The propagation of the transversal waves

system and divergent waves system occurs away from the vessel for subcritical values

(Frh &amp;lt;1), producing an angle of 35°. At critical velocity (Frh = 1) the wave angle is

perpendicular to the track of ship, generating an angle of 0°. At supercritical velocities

(Frh &gt; 1), there is no transversal waves and the divergent waves produce wave with a

At the critical speed, or critical Frh, Frh = 1.0.

Speeds &amp;lt;Frh = 1.0 are known as subcritical speeds;
Speeds &gt; Frh = 1.0 are known as supercritical speeds.

Around the critical speed the motion is unsteady and, particularly in the case of

a model in a test tank with finite width, solitary waves (solitons) may be generated

that move ahead of the model, [6.2]. For these sorts of reasons, some authorities

define a region with speeds in the approximate range 0.90 &amp;lt;Frh &amp;lt;1.1 as the trans-

critical region.

At speeds well below Frh = 1.0, the wave system is as shown in Figure 6.1(a),
with a transverse wave system and a divergent wave system propagating away from

the ship at an angle of about 35?. See also the Kelvin wave pattern, Figure 3.14. As

the ship speed approaches the critical speed, Frh = 1.0, the wave angle approaches
0?, or perpendicular to the track of the ship. At speeds greater than the critical

speed, the diverging wave system returns to a wave propagation angle of about

cos?1(1/Frh), Figure 6.1(b). It can be noted that there are now no transverse waves.

As the speed approaches the critical speed, Frh = 1.0, a significant amplification
of wave resistance occurs. Figure 6.3 shows the typical influence of shallow water on

the resistance curve, to a base of length Froude number, and Figure 6.4 shows the

ratio of shallow to deep water wave resistance to a base of depth Froude number.

At speeds greater than critical, the resistance reduces again and can even fall to a

little less than the deep water value. In practice, the maximum interference occurs at

a Frh a little less than Frh = 1.0, in general in the range 0.96–0.98. At speeds around
critical, the increase in resistance, hence required propeller thrust, leads also to a

decrease in propeller efficiency as the propeller is now working well off design.

The influence of shallow water on the resistance of high-speed displacement

Molland, Turnock and Hudson (2011) show the performance of the resistance, de-

scribed in the Figure 3.6, displaying great variation of the resistance in shallow water.

When the velocity is greater than critical, the value of Rt in shallow waters reduces again

and and becomes a little lower than the Rt in deep water navigation. The ratio of shallow

to deep water wave-making resistances Rwh/RwD is illustrated in the Figure 3.7, where



22

the maximum value is 4.0, typically, when Frh is approximately 1.0 (in general in the

range of 0.96 to 0.98) implying the decrease of the propeller efficiency. These effects (de-

scribed in the Figure 3.8) show a lower value of h/LWL ratio and Rw peaks with a high

value. The ratio marked as ? is for deep water. The value of 0.75 for the h/LWL ratio
corresponds to the critical velocity.

on the behaviour of high-speed ship forms was investigated by Millward and

In order to describe fully the effects of shallow water, it is necessary to use a

parameter such as T/h or L/h as well as depth Frh. The results of resistance experi-

ments, to a base of length Fr, for changes in L/h are shown in Figure 6.5 [6.2]. The

increases in resistance around Frh = 1.0, when Fr = 1/

L/ h , can be clearly seen.

6.2 Bank Effects

The effects of a bank, or restricted breadth, on the ship are similar to those experi-

enced in shallow water, and exaggerate the effects of restricted depth.

Corrections for bank effects may be incorporated with those for restricted

depth, such as those described in Section 6.3.

6.3 Blockage Speed Corrections

Corrections for the effect of shallow water are generally suitable for speeds up to

about Frh = 0.7. They are directed at the influences of potential and skin friction
drag, rather than at wave drag whose influence is weak below about Frh = 0.7.

In the Figure 3.9 shows the distribution of the pressure and the velocity of a fluid

around a symmetric body. The flow is slower at the bow and the stern of the ship,

and faster at midship. Before the flow touches the hull, the velocity is constant and no

pressure. When the flow is in contact in the bow and the stern, its velocity is zero and

its pressure is high. At the middle of the body, the velocity of the flow is higher, and

its pressure is lower according to Bernoulli’s principle. The boundary layer of a body

increases significantly the viscous resistance. The pressure and the velocity distribution

can be altered due to vortex formation that occurs close to the hull surface (BERTRAM,

2000).

1. Primary wave system (Fig. 3.2)
In an ideal fluid with no viscosity, a deeply submerged body would have
zero resistance (D’Alembert’s paradoxon). The flow would be slower
at both ends of the body and faster in the middle. Correspondingly
at each end the pressure will be higher than average, reaching at
one point stagnation pressure, and the pressure in the middle will
be lower than average. Now imagine a body consisting of the ship
hull below the calm-water surface and its mirror image at the calm-
water surface (Fig. 3.3). This double body would create a certain
pressure distribution at the symmetry plane (calm-water surface) in an
infinite ideal fluid. Following Bernoulli’s equation, we could express
a corresponding surface elevation (wave height) distribution for this
pressure distribution, yielding wave crests at the ship ends and a long
wave trough along the middle. This is called the primary wave system.
The shape of the primary wave system is speed independent, e.g. the
locations of maxima, minima, and zero crossings are not affected by
the speed. The vertical scale (wave height) depends quadratically on the
speed.

2. Secondary wave system (Fig. 3.4)
At the free surface, a typical wave pattern is produced and radiated down-
stream. Even if we assume an ideal fluid with no viscosity, this wave
pattern will result in a resistance. The wave pattern consists of trans-
verse and divergent waves. In deep water, the wave pattern is limited to
a wedge-shaped region with a half-angle of 19.5°. This angle is inde-
pendent of the actual shape of the ship. On shallow water, the half-angle
widens to 90° (for depth Froude number Fnh D 1.0) and then becomes
more and more narrow for supercritical speeds above Fnh D 1. The ship

It is highly important to define whether the vessel’s velocity, during navigation in

certain local depths, is super-critical, sub-critical or critical, as illustrated in the Figure

3.10.

According to ITTC (1987), some typical parameters and their values must be consid-

ered so as to estimate the river restrictions, e.g.,

? The depth Froude number Frh influences on wave resistance (Frh &gt; 0.7);

? The water-depth to draught ratio h/T influences the flow around the hull, indepen-

dent of the Frh value (if h/T &amp;lt;4);

? For river width to vessel’s beam ratio Bc/B, the flow around the hull changes (if

Bc/B &amp;lt;4);

? The relationship between the river section area and the immerse midship section

combines the effects of wave height and speed. For deep water, the energy is

E = ?g2 H2 T2/16?, (6.8)

where H is the wave height (m) and T is the wave period (s). This approach takes

account, for example, of those waves with long periods which, as they approach

more shallow water, may be more damaging to the environment.

In the case of shallow water,

E = ?g H2?/8, (6.9)

where ? = (gT2/2? )tanh(2? h/LW), h is the water depth and LW is the wave length.
In shallow water, most of the wave energy is contained in a single long-period

wave with a relatively small decay of wave energy and wave height with distance

from the ship. In [6.27] it is pointed out that if energy alone is used, the individual

components of wave height and period are lost, and it is recommended that the

description of wash waves in shallow water should include both maximum wave

height and maximum wave energy.

Absolute values need to be applied to the criteria if they are to be employed by

port, harbour or coastal authorities to regulate the speeds and courses of ships in

order to control the impact of wave wash. A typical case may require a maximum

wave height of say 280 mm at a particular location, [6.30], or 350 mm for 3 m water

depth and wave period 9 s [6.29].

From the ship operational viewpoint, it is recommended that ships likely to

operate frequently in shallow water should carry a graph such as that shown in

Figure 6.7. This indicates how the ship should operate well below or well above

the critical speed for a particular water depth. Phillips and Hook [6.31] address the

problems of operational risks and give an outline of the development of risk assess-

ment passage plans for fast commercial ships.

area Ac/Aims is the beginning of the restriction waterway (if Ac/Aims &amp;lt;15).

Pompe?e (2015) established models to estimate the inland vessel’s resistance, depend-

ing on the type of vessels (self-propelled or pushed convoys) and the characteristics of

the river as shown in the Figure 3.11. The traditional shallow water methods for large

rivers (as Danube) are based on velocities of Schlichting (1934), Landweber (1939) and

Lackenby (1963). The diagrams by Karpov (1946) and the correction of the wall effect

by Artjushkov (1968) for middle rivers (as Rhine and Rhone) are used.

3.2.1 Large rivers

Schlichting (1934) carried out the analysis of shallow water effects based on theoretical

considerations and model experiments. In model tests, the author only took into account

the reduction of the water depth and did not consider the increasing influence of the banks

(tank width) in a towing tank.

In the Figure 3.12 is shown the frictional Rf and total Rt resistance curves in deep

and shallow water to a base of velocity. The ship generates a wave pattern giving a wave

length ? for velocity ?? in deep water

?2? =
g?

. (3.27)

The same wave length ? would be generated at some lower or intermediate velocity ?I in

a specific water depth h, and is expressed as

The increase in potential or displacement flow around the hull due to the restriction

of area by the proximity of the bottom generate a further loss in velocity ??p, giving

?h = ?I ? ??p. (3.31)

Later, Schlichting investigated this reduction of the velocity of the vessel in shallow waters,

and found that the factor to control further loss in velocity was the ratio

Landweber (1939) analysed the Schlichting’s method for the prediction of the resis-

tance shallow water in case of restricted channels. He proposed a hydraulic radius that

can be determined by the ratio of the cross-section area of the channel to the wetted

perimeter (Figure 3.15)

where Bc is the width of the channel and qs is the wetted girth of the hull that is determined

which is given in contour form illustrated in the Figure 3.16. He observed some points of

flow” effect. In DCHJ there is wave-retardation. In CFGH back-flow and wave-retardation

are significant.

The correlation allowance is applied to the correction of the vessel’s frictional co-

efficient. The value varies depending on the ship length and, rarely, the displacement.

According to Harvald (1983) this coefficient has been fixed at 0.0004. This variable is not

applied in this study because only the model scale of the vessel is calculated.

Artjushkov (1968) improved the Karpov’s analysis by including a correction for the

width effect on the residuary resistance coefficient, this correction composed of two terms,

the first, is the residuary resistance coefficient correction ?Cr; and second, the velocity

ratio ??/??. This terms are determined in the Tables 3.1 and 3.2.

3.3 Empirical procedure

This chapter is summarized with a flowchart in two parts. In the Figure 3.18 shows the

empirical part in case of inland vessel accomplish inside of the parameters represented in

the equation (3.39). Otherwise, in the Figure 3.19 describes the Karpov’s and Artjushkov’s

methods if the inland ship accomplish within the parameters, shown in the equation (3.43).

3.4 Hypothesis

The empirical methods for the calculation of the vessel’s resistance, used in this pa-

per, are based on models applicable to middle rivers for shallow water navigation. The

hypotheses are numerated as follows:

? The inland vessel is self-propelled;

? The type of waterway is a middle river;

? There is a restriction of the river width.

4 NUMERICAL SIMULATION BY CFD

This chapter provides a systematic review of the main fundamentals regarding the

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). For this purpose, the equations that govern the

motions of the fluids are presented. First, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation is used to

obtain the Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation by means of Reynolds

decomposition. The Realizable k-? turbulence model and the Finite Volume Method

(FVM) are applied in order to simulate the turbulent flow and in order to calculate values

at specific points/small areas in a cell or element of a mesh, respectively. For tracking

and locating the free surface between air and water, the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method

is used. Additionally, the implementation of the boundary conditions is explained.

4.1 Hypotheses

The computational methods, used in this paper, are based on the RANS equations

in three dimensions applying the realizable k-? turbulence model. For the solution of the

problem, the following hypotheses are adopted:

? The fluids (air and water) are incompressible and Newtonian;

? The flows are three-dimensional and non-stationary;

? The surface tension between air and water is ignored;

? The calculation of the inland vessel’s sinkage and trim will not be applied.

4.2 Conservation of mass

Is the principle in which the mass of an object, set of objects or any closed system

does not remains unchanged over time. Its equation is represented mathematically by the

following equation

4.3.1 Newtonian fluid

Newtonian fluids are characterized by a constant viscosity, independently of time and

shear stresses (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015b). Moreover, the shear and strain rates

are linearly related in these cases. On the other hand, non-Newtonian fluids do not follow

Newtonian’s law of viscosity. As a matter of fact, their viscosity is dependent of shear rate

and/or shear rate viscosity. In the Figure 4.2 shows the characteristics of ?, described

above, for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

Newtonian fluid.

The constitutive relation of the shear stresses with the pressure p and the viscous

equation is the result of deformation law and it was introduced by Stokes (1845)4.

4.3.2 The Navier-Stokes equation

The Navier-Stokes (NS) equation is a partial differential equation that describes the

motion of the viscous fluid. Euler was the first to describe the ideal equation for incom-

pressible and frictionless fluids. His works was devised in 17th century and published in

1755. Navier (1822) introduced the friction (element viscosity) for more realistic problems

of viscous fluids. Stokes (1845) improved on this work although the complete solutions

were obtained only for the case of simple two-dimensional flows (Encyclopædia Britannica,

2015e).

4.4 Reynolds-Averaging

In Reynolds averaging or Reynolds decomposition, introduced in 1895, a quantity is

decomposed into a mean (ensemble-averaged or time-averaged) and a fluctuating parts.

Consider a stationary turbulent flow. For the velocity components is decomposed by

ui(x, t) = Ui(x) + u
?
i(x, t), (4.24)

where Ui(x) is the mean velocity, u
?
i(x, t) is the fluctuating velocity and x is the position

vector in vector notation.

The mean velocity is defined by

Ui(x) = lim
Ts??

1

Ts

? t+Ts
t

ui(x, t)dt, (4.25)

where Ts is a long time to relevant period of the fluctuations in ui. The equation (4.25)

is again the same time-averaged value,

Ui(x) = lim
Ts??

1

Ts

? t+Ts
t

Ui(x)dt = Ui(x), (4.26)

where an overbar is shorthand for the time average. The time-averaging of the fluctuating

velocity is

u?i(x) = lim
Ts??

1

Ts

? t+Ts
t

[ui(x, t) ?Ui(x)] dt = Ui(x) ?Ui(x) = 0. (4.27)

This behavior is illustrated in the Figure 4.3 (WILCOX, 1998).

4.5 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equation

Aiming at the description of the turbulent flow motions, the Reynolds decomposition

is introduced to be applied in the NS equation. First, the velocity components and the

pressure are time-averaged,

(RANS or RANSE).

The term ??u?iu?j is the Reynolds stress tensor and must be modeled. The Boussinesq

4.6 Turbulence modeling

There are several approaches that allow the estimation of these effects. Spalart-

Allmaras, k-? and k-? are common models that employ the Boussinesq hypothesis. In

this study, the realizable k-? turbulence model is adopted.

4.6.1 Realizable k-? model

Is a two-equation turbulence model widely adopted. Initially is developed by Launder

and Spalding (1972) in standard form and is based on the model transport equations for

TKE and the dissipation rate ?. Later, Yakhot et al. (1992) refined this model (called

RNG k-?). Finally, this model was improved by Shih et al. (1995), called Realizable k-?,

and is described by

The physic interpretation of Cµ, YM and the constant C3? are given in Shih et al. (1995)

and ANSYS (2017). The model constants C1?, C2, ?k and ?? have the following default

values: C1? = 1.44, C2 = 1.9, ?k = 1.0 and ?? = 1.2.

4.7 Volume of Fluid method

The Volume of Fluid (VOF) is a method that can model immiscible5 fluids for tracking

and locating the free surface. Initially, the method was developed by Noh and Woodward

(1976) and later by Hirt and Nichols (1981).

In the Figure 4.4a shows an example of a interface between two fluids with an actual

shape and the Figure 4.4b is illustrated an approximation to the reconstruction of interface

of the fluids in a grid mesh of a computational domain. Each cell indicates the fill rate of

a fluid (material 1). The volume fraction of a fluid q is denoted by ?q and is defined as

?q =
Vq
V

(4.43)

where Vq is the volume of a fluid in the cell and V is the volume of the cell. The volume

fractions of two fluids in a cell must sum up to one

Nfluids?
q=1

?q = 1 (4.44)

where Nfluids is the total number of fluids.

For each cell of the volume fraction follows three conditions:

? ?q = 0, the cell is empty (of the q
th fluid);

5Incapable of mixing or attaining homogeneity (Merriam-Webster, 2004).

4.8 Implementation of boundary conditions

Generally, all CFD problems define initial boundary conditions of a computational

domain (Figure 4.5). The most common boundary conditions are: inlet, outlet, wall, and

symmetry (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007).

4.8.1 Inlet boundary condition

The total pressure at inlet boundary conditions is given by

pin =
1

2
U2in + (???0)|??g |[g? · (b ? a)] (4.47)

where a is any point on the free surface and b is the position vectors in the center of the

surface of an element, U2in is a mean velocity vector at inlet boundary condition, |??g | is

the gravity magnitude, g? is the unity vector of gravity, and ?0 is the reference density.

The approximation of the TKE and ? at inlet are represented by (VERSTEEG;

section 4.6). I is the turbulence intensity, defined as the ratio of the velocity fluctuations

u?i to the mean flow velocity Ui, represented by

I ? u

The turbulent viscosity ratio µt

Ret ?

??
, (4.51)

and the turbulence parameters are: 1 &amp;lt;µt
µ
&amp;lt;10.



46

4.8.2 Outlet boundary condition

The pressure at outlet boundary condition is taken equal to the static or atmospheric

pressure

pout = (???0)|??g |(g? · (b ? a)). (4.52)

The flow often reaches a fully developed state in the flow direction if the outlet of the

computational domain is chosen far from geometric disturbance. Thus, we can put an

exit surface assuming the gradients of all variables are equal to zero in the flow direction

(LAUNDER; SPALDING, 1972; VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007; DEWAN, 2011;

JI, 2013). Thus,

?Uout
?n

= 0,
?kout
?n

= 0,
??out
?n

= 0, (4.53)

where Uout, kout and ?out are variables at outlet flow and n is the normal vector of the

surface.

4.8.3 Wall boundary condition

The region near to the wall can be modeled by means of the near-wall treatment.

This approach does not include the wall, where the no-slip condition is adopted, which

can lead to unsatisfactory results for the k-? turbulence model.

The no-slip condition implies that the velocity components and the gradients of the

pressure, TKE and ? are equal to zero

Uwall · n = 0,
?Pwall
?n

= 0,
?kwall
?n

= 0, (4.54)

where n is the local coordinate normal to the wall. Also, the velocity fluctuation u?i is

zero. Thus, the value of TKE can be computed as (DURBIN; Pettersson Rief, 2011; JI,

2013)

kwall =
1

2
|u?i|2 = 0. (4.55)

The adoption of the k-? turbulence model closes to the wall at High Reynolds Number

(HRN). The law-of-the-wall for mean velocity and TKE on standard wall functions yields

u+Q =
UQ
u?

ln(Ey+Q) (4.56)

kQ =

(4.57)



47

where u+Q is the dimensionless velocity, y
+
Q is the dimensionless distance from the wall (for

30 &amp;lt;y+Q &amp;lt;500, it satisfies the equation in the logarithmic region), E is the empirical

constant (wall roughness parameter), equivalent to 9.793 for smooth walls, ? is the von

Ka?rma?n constant (equal to 0.4187), UQ is the mean velocity of the fluid at the wall-

adjacent cell centroid Q, yQ is the distance from the centroid of the wall-adjacent cell to

the wall B (Figure 4.6) and u? is the friction or shear velocity, represented as

u? =

(4.58)

For k-? model, the wall function developed by Launder and Spalding (1974) is differ-

ent. In order to avoid confusion in the nomenclature, the equation (4.56) according to y+Q

for k-? model and its variables are represented by

Q present values larger that

11.225. Otherwise, the relationships between u+Q and y

as illustrated in the Figure 4.7, where the plot is divided in three sub-regions: viscous

Numerical values for the constants are found from measurements. We find
von Karman’s constant ? ? 0.4 and the additive constant B ? 5.5 (or E ? 9.8)
for smooth walls; wall roughness causes a decrease in the value of B. The 
values of ? and B are universal constants valid for all turbulent flows past
smooth walls at high Reynolds number. Because of the logarithmic relation-
ship between u+ and y+, formula (3.18) is often called the log-law, and the
layer where y+ takes values between 30 and 500 the log-law layer.

Outer layer --- the inertia-dominated region far from the wall

Experimental measurements show that the log-law is valid in the region 
0.02 &amp;lt;y/? &amp;lt;0.2. For larger values of y the velocity-defect law (3.17) 
provides the correct form. In the overlap region the log-law and velocity-
defect law have to be equal. Tennekes and Lumley (1972) show that a
matched overlap is obtained by assuming the following logarithmic form:

= ? ln + A (3.20)

where A is a constant. This velocity-defect law is often called the law of the
wake.

Figure 3.11 from Schlichting (1979) shows the close agreement between
theoretical equations (3.18) and (3.19) in their respective areas of validity and
experimental data.

The turbulent boundary layer adjacent to a solid surface is composed of
two regions:

• The inner region: 10 –20% of the total thickness of the wall layer; 
the shear stress is (almost) constant and equal to the wall shear stress ?w.
Within this region there are three zones. In order of increasing distance
from the wall we have:
– the linear sub-layer: viscous stresses dominate the flow adjacent to

surface
– the buffer layer: viscous and turbulent stresses are of similar magnitude
– the log-law layer: turbulent (Reynolds) stresses dominate.

be used (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007).

4.8.4 Symmetry boundary condition

metry plane are taken equal to zero (DEWAN, 2011), i.e.,

4.9 Finite Volume Method

The Finite Volume6 Method (FVM) is a numerical method of discretization7 that

allows solve partial differential equations (PDE) applied to conservation laws. Is similar

to the Finite Element Method (FEM) or the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and uses

integral formulations of conservation laws and does not require a structured grid mesh.

Consider the unsteady conservation equation for transport of a fluid property ? in a

cell volume V as follows8 (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007; CD-adapco, 2014)?

where u is the velocity vector, A is the surface area vector, ?? is the diffusion coefficient

for ?, ?? is the gradient of ? and S? is the source of ? per unit volume. A practical
interpretation of the equation (4.66) is provided in words (CD-adapco, 2014),

? The first term is time rate of change of fluid property ? inside the cell (transient

term);

? The second term is the net rate of decrease of fluid property ? across the cell

boundaries due to convection (convection term);

? The third term is the net rate of increase of fluid property ? across the cell bound-

aries due to diffusion (diffusion term);

? The fourth term is the generation/destruction of fluid property ? inside the cell

(source term).

terms of the transport equation are explained in the following subsections except for

source term expressed in the equation (4.70) which is the simplest formulation consistent

with a second-order discretization (CD-adapco, 2014).

4.9.1 Transient term

The transient term could be discretized temporally. First-order temporal discretiza-

tion scheme (Euler implicit form) is used in this study. This involves the integration over

a time step ?t and is given by

?

where n + 1 is the next time level t + ?t, n is the current time level t.

4.9.2 Convection term

In this subsection, an explanation is provided regarding only one type of interpolation

using spatial discretization schemes applied to the convection term. In the Figure 4.10

a one-dimensional form is illustrated. The integration of the total flux of the convection

term, viewed in the equation (4.68), is rewritten as

The scheme depends on the flow direction and is used in this study. Also, it is less

dissipative but not bounded. In the Figure 4.10 shows the value ? of a fluid property

This discretization scheme was described initially for finite difference discretization

by Warming and Beam (1976) and Hodge, Stone and Miller (1979). Later, it was imple-

mented for finite volume by Tamamidis and Assanis (1993) as an explicit transient scheme,

and by Thompson and Wilkers (1982) as a steady state implicit version (NORRIS, 2000).

4.9.3 Diffusion term

The diffusion term uses the interpolation function of central differentiating and does

not cause stability problems to the simulation (MALISKA, 1995; CD-adapco, 2014; AN-

SYS, 2017). The integration of the total flux of diffusion, expressed in the equation (4.69),

is rewritten as

for maintaining accuracy on non-orthogonal meshes (CD-adapco, 2014).

4.10 Numerical procedure

The Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE) is used to com-

plement the numerical procedure that is described in the Figure 4.11. This method,

developed by Patankar and Spalding (1972), is a segregated algorithm of iterative proce-

dure for the calculation of pressure and velocity fields (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA,

2007). The flowchart of this procedure illustrates the following steps:

1. Read initial data;

2. Discretize and solve RANS equation using updated values of pressure to compute

the intermediate velocity field;

3. Discretize and solve the pressure correction using the intermediate velocity field

obtained recently;

4. Correct the pressure and the velocity field using the pressure-correction obtained in

the previous step;

5. Discretize and solve scalar equation ?;

6. Return to step 2 in case of converges;

7. If the current time simulation is different to the maximum time simulation, return

to step 2.

5 APPLICATION TO THE SELF-PROPELLED

INLAND VESSEL INTENDED FOR THE

OPERATION IN THE MAGDALENA RIVER

LOW COURSE

This chapter presents the methodology applied on the ship resistance calculation. For

this purpose, a model which was tested and provided by the IPT was used. This model

was digitally modeled and, subsequently, was carried out a comparative analysis based on

the original IPT model and the CAD modeled hull. In this study, the mesh applied for

the geometry, the boundary conditions and the solver parameters, as well as the results

are presented and visualized.

5.1 Methodology

In the method, the market in which the vessel will operate, the physical restrictions

of the river and the data obtained from existing inland vessels are considered. Once

the hull design is chosen, the hull resistance is calculated by three ways. The first is

the experimental test evaluated in the towing tank on IPT. The second is the empirical

procedure (explained in the chapter 3) and is accomplished inside the parameters. The

third is the procedure using CFD (Figure 5.1). The mesh is generated with the design of

the geometry domain. Later, initial physical conditions are configured. Before running

the solution (explained in the chapter 4), the time step and the maximum simulation time

must be determined. After that, the results are analyzed and the experimental results are

compared to the empirical results. The above are described in the Figure 5.2.

5.2 Experimental test in model scale

Consists of placing the model in a towing tank with a carriage that travels along the

basin. The Figure 5.3 shows an example of a test of an inland vessel in shallow water

dimensions are rather modest, but sufficient for the 
execution of manoeuvring and seakeeping tests with ship 
models with a length over all between 3.5 m and 4.5 m at 
low or moderate speed (typically &amp;lt;1.2 m/s on model 
scale) (see Figure 2 and Table 1). This length range is 
valid for sea-going vessels and self-propelled inland 
barges, but can be exceeded considerably for push 
convoys.

The draft of the ship models used at the towing tank 
typically varies between 0.10 m and 0.20 m. In practice, 
the range of under keel clearances may vary between 
(less than) 10% to 150% of draft in harbours and their 
access channels, so a variation of the water depth 
between 0.10 and 0.50 m is required in the towing tank. 
For that reason the water depth of the towing tank is 
limited to 0.50 m. While such a range allows to 
determine experimentally ship behaviour in water depths 
that are usually considered as very deep for waterways 
authorities, the vicinity of the bottom may still have an 
important effect on the ship’s hydrodynamics.

This servo motor driven slide can be positioned manually 
in vertical direction over 0.4 m to take account of water 
level variations. Two of the four wheels are driven by 

brushless AC-servo-motors which are connected to the 
shaft by means of a gearing. The longitudinal position is 
determined independently using a measuring wheel. The 
lateral carriage is driven by means of a pinion - rack 
combination. The pinion of this combination is driven by 
a servo motor and a second pinion carries a brake. The 
rotation angle is measured at the tube, to which a beam is 
connected by means of a flange.

5.2.1 Geometric similarity

Consists of two objects (model and prototype) of different dimensions which are similar

as these have the same scale ratio. This type of similarity is applied to objects with area



58

and volume, such as a wing shown in the Figure 5.4. The scale ratio is defined as,

? =
dp
dm

, ?2 =
d2p
d2m

, ?3 =
d3p
d3m

, (5.1)

where dp and dm are the dimensional lengths of the prototype and the model respectively.

easier said than done, as we now discuss. There are specialized texts on model
testing [30–32].

Instead of complete similarity, the engineering literature speaks of particular types
of similarity, the most common being geometric, kinematic, dynamic, and thermal.
Let us consider each separately.

Geometric similarity concerns the length dimension {L} and must be ensured before
any sensible model testing can proceed. A formal definition is as follows:

A model and prototype are geometrically similar if and only if all body dimensions
in all three coordinates have the same linear scale ratio.

Note that all length scales must be the same. It is as if you took a photograph of the
prototype and reduced it or enlarged it until it fitted the size of the model. If the model
is to be made one-tenth the prototype size, its length, width, and height must each be
one-tenth as large. Not only that, but also its entire shape must be one-tenth as large,
and technically we speak of homologous points, which are points that have the same
relative location. For example, the nose of the prototype is homologous to the nose
of the model. The left wingtip of the prototype is homologous to the left wingtip of
the model. Then geometric similarity requires that all homologous points be related
by the same linear scale ratio. This applies to the fluid geometry as well as the model
geometry.

All angles are preserved in geometric similarity. All flow directions are preserved.
The orientations of model and prototype with respect to the surroundings must be
identical.

Figure 5.4 illustrates a prototype wing and a one-tenth-scale model. The model
lengths are all one-tenth as large, but its angle of attack with respect to the free stream
is the same for both model and prototype: 10° not 1°. All physical details on the model
must be scaled, and some are rather subtle and sometimes overlooked:

1. The model nose radius must be one-tenth as large.

2. The model surface roughness must be one-tenth as large.

5.2.2 Kinematic similarity

The velocity of the flow at any point in the model must have the same direction as

the velocity of the flow in the prototype. It means, the motions of the systems must be

similar as illustrated in the Figure 5.5.

(by a constant scale factor) to the velocity at the corresponding point in the
prototype flow (Fig. –1 ). Specifically, for kinematic similarity the velocity
at corresponding points must scale in magnitude and must point in the same
relative direction. You may think of geometric similarity as length-scale
equivalence and kinematic similarity as time-scale equivalence. eometric
similarity is a prere uisite for inematic similarity. ust as the geometric
scale factor can be less than, equal to, or greater than one, so can the velocity
scale factor. In Fig. –1 , for example, the geometric scale factor is less than
one (model smaller than prototype), but the velocity scale is greater than one
(velocities around the model are greater than those around the prototype).
You may recall from Chap.  that streamlines are kinematic phenomena
hence, the streamline pattern in the model flow is a geometrically scaled
copy of that in the prototype flow when kinematic similarity is achieved.

The third and most restrictive similarity condition is that of yna ic si -
ilarity Dynamic similarity is achieved when all forces in the model flow
scale by a constant factor to corresponding forces in the prototype flow
(force-scale equivalence). As with geometric and kinematic similarity, the
scale factor for forces can be less than, equal to, or greater than one. In Fig.
–1  for example, the force-scale factor is less than one since the force on

the model building is less than that on the prototype. inematic similarity is
a necessary ut insufficient condition for dynamic similarity. It is thus pos-
sible for a model flow and a prototype flow to achieve both geometric and
kinematic similarity, yet not dynamic similarity. All three similarity condi-
tions must exist for complete similarity to be ensured.

In a general flow field, complete similarity between a model and prototype is
achieved only when there is geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similarity.

We let uppercase reek letter i (?) denote a nondimensional parameter.
You are already familiar with one ?, namely the Froude number, Fr. In a
general dimensional analysis problem, there is one ? that we call the

e en ent ?, giving it the notation ?1. The parameter ?1 is in general a
function of several other ?’s, which we call in e en ent ?’s. The func-
tional relationship is
Functional relationship et een ?’s: (7–11)

where is the total number of ?’s.
Consider an experiment in which a scale model is tested to simulate a

prototype flow. To ensure complete similarity between the model and the
prototype, each independent ? of the model (subscript m) must be identical
to the corresponding independent ? of the prototype (subscript p), i.e., ?2, m
? ?2, p, ? , m ? ? , p, . . . , ? m ? ? p.

To ensure complete similarity, the model and prototype must be geometrically
similar, and all independent ? groups must match between model and
prototype.

nder these conditions the dependent ? of the model (?1, m) is guaranteed
to also equal the dependent ? of the prototype (?1, p). athematically, we
write a conditional statement for achieving similarity,

5.2.3 Dynamic similarity

The force and pressure coefficients of the model and prototype should be identical. It

implies that the dimensionless parameters, such as Reynolds and Froude numbers, must

be equal.



59

If the values of the Reynolds number are equal for different characteristic lengths of

the prototype and the model, the velocity of the model will be high and, as a result, the

evaluation in the towing tank will be impossible. On the other hand, the Froude number

similarity could be used because the velocity of the model must be less than the velocity

of the prototype. In the Figure 5.6 shows an experiment, where the prototype and model

are identical homogeneous force.

and the time scale is

(5.33)

These Froude-scaling kinematic relations are illustrated in Fig. 5.6b for wave motion
modeling. If the waves are related by the length scale ?, then the wave period, prop-
agation speed, and particle velocities are related by 

If viscosity, surface tension, or compressibility is important, kinematic similarity
depends on the achievement of dynamic similarity.

Dynamic similarity exists when the model and the prototype have the same length
scale ratio, time scale ratio, and force scale (or mass scale) ratio. Again geometric
similarity is a first requirement; without it, proceed no further. Then dynamic simi-
larity exists, simultaneous with kinematic similarity, if the model and prototype force
and pressure coefficients are identical. This is ensured if

1. For compressible flow, the model and prototype Reynolds number and Mach
number and specific-heat ratio are correspondingly equal.

2. For incompressible flow

a. With no free surface: model and prototype Reynolds numbers are equal.

b. With a free surface: model and prototype Reynolds number, Froude
number, and (if necessary) Weber number and cavitation number are corre-
spondingly equal.

Mathematically, Newton’s law for any fluid particle requires that the sum of the pres-
sure force, gravity force, and friction force equal the acceleration term, or inertia force,

Fp ? Fg ? Ff ? Fi

The dynamic similarity laws listed above ensure that each of these forces will be in
the same ratio and have equivalent directions between model and prototype. Figure 5.7

5.3 Hull modeling

The hull geometry can be described through lines-plan. This plan is composed by the

sheer profile (in perspective view which is divided in sections); the body plan (that shows

the half symmetrical sections in the fore and aft); and the half-breadth plan (top view)

which displays the half symmetrical sections (port and starboard side) at each waterline

(levels of hull draft). In the Figure 5.7 illustrates an example of a lines-plan.

The offsets are the representation of the lines plan in numbers organized in tables

(that provide the coordinates of the points the sum of which results in the formation of

the hull’s lines). The original hull model designed by IPT is composed by 137 sheers and

7 waterlines, described in the Figures B.1 and B.2. These offsets are adapted digitally,

using the portable software FREE!ship (ENGELAND, 2006). This program uses a simple

modeling, creating interpolation points for lines and the generation of surfaces, observed in

Figure 5.8. Also, it was possible the analysis of the lines-plan that is generated digitally

(Figure 5.9) and is compared with the original lines-plan of the hull, including their

dimensions (Table 5.1).

5.4 Geometry and mesh

Is important to define the volume of the computational domain for the simulation of

inland vessel’s resistance. The boundary condition of the symmetry is considered for the

reduction of the computational process.

The size of the computational domain volume is one of the aspects that influence

the simulation solution and the user defines the limits. If the computational domain is

small, the flow is not represented and the simulation diverges. On the other hand, if the

domain is larger, the simulation is consuming time and needs more power process without

implying significantly better results.

In the Figure 5.10 shows the boundary conditions of the computational domain con-

sidered in this study and is similar to those used by Liu et al. (2017). The length is almost

4 times the LWL, and the width of the IPT towing tank. The height is 0.8 m, where 0.3

m corresponds to the water depth. The geometry of this domain is described in the Table

5.2.

5.4.1 Mesh

After defining the geometry of the computational domain, the mesh is realized, which

it is divided into surface mesh and volume. The STAR-CCM+ (CD-adapco, 2014) soft-

ware allows the creation of unstructured surface mesh and structured volume mesh.

For this study, it is important to discretize the regions of greatest interest, where the

modification of the cell size is refined. The remainder of volume of the computational

domain is maintained at base size of the cell. The regions around the hull are important

because pressure and shear forces are obtained through the model, followed by the free

surface due to the tracking of waves. Six regions of refined mesh are defined in the Table

5.3 and is illustrated in the Figure 5.11.

The advantages of the structured mesh are the algorithms of discretization and imple-

mentation in a computationally efficient manner. Their difficulties are the mesh generation

of regions with multi-block shapes and the time required to produce a mesh for extremely

complex forms in the computational domain (ANWER, 2016).

The base cell size, used for the computational domain, was 1.36 meters. For the vessel

hull mesh, the isotropic prism (where the size of the cells side is equal) was used with

5.3125E-3 meters (base cell size divided 256 times), equivalent to 0.39%.

For the rest of the refined regions, the anisotropic prism is used. For the estimation

of the cell size in the axes x and y for the free surface region, the wavelength ? generated

by the inland vessel is calculated and is defined as (MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON,

2011)

)
. (5.2)

Ji et al. (2012) recommends using 10 points per length of the transverse waves. The value

of the cell size for both axes is 2.125E-2 meters, because the velocity reference is 0.576 m/s.

The cell size in z axe applied on the bottom and free surface-thin regions is equivalent to

5.3125E-3 meters; the free surface in the very thin region is sized at 2.65625E-3 meters

and allows tracking and locating the free surface using VOF method. The visualization

of the computational domain mesh described above is illustrated in the Figures 5.12 and

5.13, similar to those by Liu et al. (2017), and the Table 5.4 is detailed the cell size of

each region.

5.4.1.1 Boundary layer mesh

The boundary layer is important because the near-wall flow solution allows the deter-

mination of forces and flow features that depend on the velocity gradients (CD-adapco,

2014). In previous chapter it was explained how the near-all treatment works in the wall

of the boundary condition and, in this study, is applied only on the hull vessel and on the

wall bottom of the computational domain.

Some aspects are taken into account in the generation of prism mesh. One is the



65

boundary thickness, and can be determined according to ITTC (2014),

y =
y+Lmod

ReL

?
Cf
2

, (5.3)

where Lmod is the length of the inland vessel model and ReL is the Reynolds number

of the ship model. The value corresponds only to the first thickness layer and the user

chooses the value of y+. For the finite mesh, y+ ? 1; and for tick mesh, 30 ? y+ ? 100,
equivalent to logarithmic profile. In STAR-CCM+, the all y+ wall treatment is chosen

by default.

Another aspect is the stretch factor, that is represented as the ratio between the

thickness of a cell layer and the thickness of the preceding layer. For example, the prism

layer is 1 unit and stretch factor is 2, the thickness of the next layer is 2 units, continuing

the other next layers that would give values of 4, 8, 16 and so on. An example is illustrated

in the Figure 5.14. In appendix C, an algorithm generated in MATLAB is created to

determine the total thickness prism layer. In the Figure 5.15 and the Table 5.5 are

detailed the properties of the prism layer for the hull and wall bottom in the computational

domain. The hull stern and hull deck are not applied, and do not affect the calculation

of the resistance.

5.5 Boundary conditions

The settings for the boundary conditions must be carefully defined according to the

test conditions made in the towing tank of the IPT. First, the VOF Waves for the simula-

tion of the gravity waves on a light fluid and a heavy fluid interface are defined. Provides

field functions that are used to initialize the VOF calculations (CD-adapco, 2014). In

this study, the type of VOF Waves that will be used is flat, because represents a plane

of calm water. In the Table 5.6 shows the properties of VOF Waves, where the point on

water level defines the position of the water surface; the vertical direction represents the

normal vector to the water surface; current is the velocity of the heavy fluid; wind is the

velocity of the light fluid; light and heavy fluid density are required for the hydrostatic

field function, created automatically with the waves, and the values for the water and the

air are determined by default. The variable u stands for the velocity which gains four

different values (0.576, 0.691, 0.806 and 0.921 m/s), for the calculation of the resistance,

and its vector direction is negative. These configurations are visualized in the Figure 5.16.

The heavy and the light fluids corresponds to the water and the air.

Variables Value

The boundary conditions of the computational domain are configured and detailed in

the Table 5.7 and the Figure 5.10. The velocities are defined at inlet, wall banks, top and

wall bottom and correspond to field function of Flat VOF Wave. A numerical damping

with length of 8.5 m is applied at inlet and outlet planes to remove wave reflections and

avoid the interaction of the true wave field generated by the vessel of the model, visualized

in the Figure 5.17. The prism layer on bottom wall is configured only with y+ = 30 and

the hull wall on stern and deck of the vessel is not applied.

Inlet Velocity inlet Normal velocity with volume fraction of water

and air. Damping wave reflections avoided.
Outlet Pressure outlet Volume fraction of water and air, Damping

wave reflections avoided.

5.6 Solver parameters, monitoring and plotting

Solver is defined by three parameters: time step, maximum iteration numbers and

maximum physical time.



68

Time step could be determined by the Courant number, represented by

Co =
??t

?x
(5.4)

where ? is the velocity of the fluid, ?t is the time step and ?x is the length interval. In

this study, ?x is defined as 2.125E-2 m and ? is the minimum velocity of the vessel.

The Courant number must be less that or equal to 1. According to ITTC (2014) the

equation of the time step is

?t = 0.05 ? 0.01Lmod
?

. (5.5)

However, for flows in confined water, a significantly smaller time step introduced by Liu

et al. (2017), which is used in this study, is represented as

?t ? 0.002Lmod
?

. (5.6)

The definition of the maximum iteration number is not established. Checking the

journal scientific papers, the average value of iteration is 10 per time step and is chosen

in this study. The maximum physical time depends of the simulation results, where

the variable of vessel resistance could be stable. Analyzing the results, 120 seconds is

enough, as shown in the Figure 5.18. The total iteration process is completed after 80,000

iterations.

Plots and visualization are analyzed for the interpretation of the results after the



69

simulation is finished. The plot of the residuals is a convergence analysis and the smaller

the residual values, the higher convergence of the simulation with the experimental results.

The Figure 5.19 shown an example of the residuals, where is simulated the inland vessel

at 0.921 m/s. Initially, the variables of the residuals start with values equal to 1. During

process, some variables drop to three levels. The ideal is that all the variables must

be in lower levels than 1 · 10?2. Therefore, the results in CFD simulation could close
the experimental results. The description of the residuals (continuity, x-movement, y-

movement, z-movement, TKE, TDR and water) is contained in the Table 5.8.

5.7 Results

The comparisons between the empirical methods (for large and medium rivers) and the

numerical methods with the experimental result are made and observed in the Figure 5.21,

where the numerical method and the empirical method for medium rivers are accurately

close to the experimental results.

The values obtained from the application of empirical methods applicable for large

river operation do not offer, in this study, an accurate prediction of the vessel resistance.

The calculation of the coefficient forces are observed in the Figure B.5, where the frictional

coefficient resistance are calculated with Reynolds number from 3.5·10?3 to 1.7·10?3. The
residual resistance coefficient with infinite velocity is calculated, and the results is constant

with 103Cr = 0.345 with length Froude number values up to 0.15. From FrL = 0.15,

103Cr the values goes up to 3.5. The values of the loss in velocities (Figure B.4) using

Schlichting’s method are between 14.93% (?? = 0.345 m/s) and 15.50% (?? = 0.921

m/s). For Lackenby’s method, the loss in velocities are between 15.21% and 15.90%.

In the Figure B.6 are shown the comparison of the ship resistance, where the residuary

resistance are more higher in shallow waters than in deep waters, because of various

factors like the influence of the walls (lateral and bottom), high waves resistance values

and other effects.



72

The values of the vessel resistance using empirical methods for medium rivers are in

better agreement with the experimental results. The velocities ?1 and ?2 are calculated

from Karpov’s diagram (Figure B.7) and are higher than ?? (maximum of 12.5% approx-

imately). In the Figure B.8 shows the coefficient forces for middle rivers. The values of

the frictional resistance coefficient are higher in comparison with this variable for large

rivers. The calculation of the residuary resistance coefficient is constant with value equal

to 2.54 and from FrL = 0.15 this coefficient varies until 2.85. Raven (2012) affirms that

the most used empirical methods to estimate shallow water resistance for inland vessels

have a very weak theoretical and empirical basis. He recommends the development of

new prediction methods that correct separately the components of the total resistance

(LINDE et al., 2017).

The results of the numerical method are more accurate at the beginning, but the

velocity are higher and the discrepancies appear, described in the Table 5.11. The relative

error is necessary to observe the discrepancy between the approximation values and the

exact values, and is represented by

Er =

where Fm is the model resistance that is tested experimentally and FCFD is the resistance

that is calculated numerically.

The Figure 5.22 shows the numerical results of the hull resistance for each velocity

and the behavior is the same. At the beginning, the values are higher and, over time, the

resistances are stabilized around 100 seconds.

5.7.1 Verification of results

Four meshes with number of elements between 2,231,629 and 10,060,010 were used

for the analysis of the grid dependence study simulated in STAR-CCM+. In the Table

For the discretization errors, the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) will be used, devel-

oped by Roache (1998) and described by Celik et al. (2008). This method is recommended

by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and American Institute of Aero-

nautics and Astronautics (AIAA) (LINDE et al., 2017).

Checking the articles where the method is used, a constant refinement ratio is rep-

resented in the equation (2.1). The fine grid (N1) consist of approximately 10.07 million

cells; the medium grid (N2) contains about 8.31 million cells; and about 6.08 million

cells in the coarse grid (N3). The solution changes between two successive grids ?21 for

The total resistance Rt of the vessel is compose of two components: the frictional Rf

and the pressure Rp resistances. The computed values of the resistance and its components

of the fine, medium and coarse grids are shown in the Table 5.13. The results of e21a

demonstrates that all the resistance have a too small approximate errors. Later, the

GCI21fine values in all resistances are no more than 1%. To maintain the an affordable

computational cost, the medium grid is chosen since the errors calculated in all grid set

are low.

5.7.2 Calculation of the properties

The following subsections is presented results of the calculation of the properties of

the 2700 TDW inland vessel. Pressure coefficient, skin friction coefficient, dimensionless

wall distance and wave pattern are visualized. Finally, the wetted surface is illustrated.

In the Figure 5.24a is shown the cross sections that are used to present the results.

According to this figure, three transverse cross sections trace along the hull at x = 0.200

m, x = 2.000 m and x = 4.000 m; three longitudinal cross sections trace along the hull

at y = 0.005 m, y = 0.200 m and y = 0.350 m; and two longitudinal cross sections are

located outside of the hull at y = 0.920 m and y = 1.500 m. In the Figure 5.24b is

illustrated the longitudinal cross section in z axis to measure the velocity magnitude and

pressure distribution between the hull and wall bottom at z = ?0.240 m.

5.7.2.1 Pressure coefficient

In the Figure 5.25 shows the contour plots of the pressure coefficient on the inland

vessel hull. The significant higher pressure is observed for lowest velocity (a). For highest

velocity, the pressure is low between the hull and the wall bottom (d). Contour blue color

corresponds the air flow.

on the inland vessel hull. At y = 0.005 m and y = 0.200 m, the values are similar, but the

coefficient is low at the end of the hull beam. The values are more 9 in case of low velocity,

and almost 3.5 in case to higher velocity. In the Figure 5.27 are shown the transverse

cross section of the pressure coefficient on the inland vessel hull. The values are low at

stern but higher at bow and midsection. The plot of these values take the hull geometry

In the Figure 5.28 shows the contour plots of the skin friction coefficient on the inland

vessel hull. It can be observed that the contour of this coefficient is the same for different

velocities, and it is illustrated in the Figures 5.29 and 5.30, where the behavior is similar.

The values are maintained in less that 0.01 except in the bow zone, where the values are

high.

5.7.2.3 Dimensionless wall distance y+

In the Figure 5.31 shows the contour plots of the dimensionless wall distance on the

inland vessel hull. The high values of y+ greater than 1 are market in white and it

happens in the inland vessel bow. This is because the value of the distance y is based

on low velocities and it can be used for highest velocities. However, the distance y can

be calculated for different velocities without affecting the numerical simulation results.

These measures are observed in the Figures 5.32 and 5.33, where in inland vessel bow

is higher in all velocities. The choosing of the first thickness of the prism layer y+, the

region of the air were not taken account.

5.7.2.4 Wave pattern

The wave pattern is generated by the hull of the inland vessel for each velocity,

visualized in the Figure 5.34, showing the Kelvin waves system which consists of transverse

and divergent waves, and its angulation is titled up to 19 degrees. The presence of the

walls causes reflection of the waves. The wave height was measured in the longitudinal

cross section outside in the hull and is illustrated in the Figure 5.35. This measure

was captured by the mesh created on STAR-CCM+. At lowest velocity, there are more

oscillations that highest velocity. Another observation is the level of the water surface at

inlet, where is not initiates at origin level. Its mean that the computational domain must

be bigger, approximately six times the length of the inland vessel in x-direction.

in the computational domain. From the symmetry view, there is higher velocity between

the hull and the wall bottom. From the top view, there is low velocity distribution of the

water at the bow and stern. The space between the wall and the hull there is changes of

the velocity distribution of the water.

marked in blue. There is higher pressure between the hull and wall bottom and there is

These effects are agreement with the Bernoulli’s principle, explained in the chapter

3. The effect where the velocity of the water is higher between the hull and the bottom

wall causing low pressure at this area is called squat. This behavior was measured in the

simulation. From IPT (1974), there is no measurement of the wetted surface for different

velocities, thus, it is difficult to make measurements for this variable and there is no

conclusions to describe these results.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The problem solution by CFD allows the collecting data that are difficult to obtain

from the experimental tests, for example, the velocity distribution of the water in the

computational domain and the streamlines around the hull. The use of CFD can realize

the corrections and improvements of the hull in the process design. This is no mean

that the experimental test could be replaced by CFD simulation despite the numerical

simulations must be faster or cost less.

The conclusions of this study could be listed as follows:

? The formulations for the empirical procedure were satisfactory only in case of vessel

navigating in middle rivers in which case the most appropriate is the Karpov’s and

Artjushkov’s method.

? In the case of other methods used in barge operating in large rivers, the width of the

affluent is not taken into account, implying less velocity loss. The wave resistance

is not taken account instead of residuary resistance is used. Also, the formulations

for the application to this shallow water effects are not satisfied for the inland vessel

hull in this study.

? The results of the inland vessel resistance by numerical simulation are satisfactory

only in case of low speeds. As the speed increases, the relative error also increases

up to 18%.

? The GCI applied in the mesh convergence criteria allow the choosing of the number

of mesh in the numerical solution. The errors are too small, and the medium grid

is chosen to simulate the ship resistance and calculate its properties at different

velocities.

? The calculation properties by CFD allow the inside analysis of the performance of

the inland vessel that the experimental analysis could be not measured. Is very



86

important the comparison of the numerical and the experimental results of some

variables, as example, the wetted surface of the hull.

The numerical simulation results can be corrected with more precision in order to

obtain results similar to those obtained in cases of navigation in shallow waters. For

this purpose, it is important to present the future work, specifying aspects that must be

analyzed.

6.1 Future analysis

All difficulties found during the development of this research could be listed as follows:

? Execution of test in reduced scale of the 2700 TDW inland vessel for obtaining the

analysis as skinage and trim. Also, it must be calculating some measure variables

as length of the vessel in waterline, wetted surface area, inclination angle, etc.

? Improves and optimizes the inland vessel hull geometry in bow and stern based on

reference as Rotteveel, Hekkenberg and Ploeg (2017) and Tabaczek and Zawi?slak

(2018).

? Modification of the computational domain size (at last 6.5 times of LWL of the

ship model in x coordinate and 1.2 times of LWL z coordinate from free surface

of the water) and more elements in the grid mesh distribution (approximately 22

million), specially on the free surface and the space between the ship hull and the

wall bottom.

? Apply the GCI criteria for the highest velocity imputing parameters (time step or

cell size of the mesh) according to Linde et al. (2017).

? Application of the propulsion analysis, where it will study the propeller design and

the power required to push the self-propelled inland vessel using CFD software with

semi-empirical approach and its validation in model scale.

? Comparison of the experimental and semi-empirical approaches with others CFD

software as STAR-CCM+, ANSYS Fluent, OPEN Foam and Nektar++. The rela-

tive error must be, at last, increase up to 5 %.

? News semi-empirical formulations of the shallow waters that implies the analysis of

maneuverability, stability, hull dimensions, skinage, trim and others according to

Raven (2012).
