To my closest friends in the faculty, all palaeontologists, even André, despite he does not want to recognize it :) , Most of the best memories of this journey are thank to you. Super-Sofia, I owe you so much for the geologist and person I am today, for all the lessons you gave me, for all the moral values you provided me. Thank you for all the help, for having me in your life and for allow me to be an aunt for your terribly-lovely kids :) I call you, together with Vanessa and Ana Jacinto, my holytrinity of friendship! Vanessa, since “Germany2015”, I cannot imagine my life without you, our talks and our jokes. You are an amazing person. God bless the NEG-FCUL friendships :) Ana, you are one of the kindest, most interesting persons in my life. Thank you for awakening my kitchen passion, for our trips and I hope for much more plans together, in the future!
André, identifying me specimens since 2014, I'm lucky to have you as a friend. I have learnt so much with you, you have always an advice to help everyone... I hope my friendship will help you at least a third of what have helped me through these years.
At last, but not the least, Jorge. I could not have a better person by my side, I am so lucky. They say life does not get easier, but I believe our relationship will grow stronger through everything. You have helped me so much. if I write how wonderful you are, I think a lot of people will try to steal you from me, so let's keep the good stories between us :)
If I forgot about someone in this “thanking list”, I'm sorry. but if you are really my friend, don't complain and ask me for a cake, instead :)
Para as minhas amigas não-geológicas, Daniela Gomes, Rita Maia e Soraia Gomes, obrigada por todas as conversas off-topic, por compreenderem as minhas ausências e ainda assim me proporcionarem tantos momentos carinhosos e engraçados.
Aos meus pais, que me ajudaram sempre que puderam e em tudo o que puderam, mesmo entendendo pouco do meu trabalho. Aos meus irmãos, aos meus tios e aos meus avós, à minha Madrinha e à Elsa, pelo vosso apoio e presença na minha vida. Aos meus afilhados, Bruno e Maria, que têm sempre um sorriso e um abraço pronto para a Madrinha. Vocês deram-me a maior parte da força para não ter desistido.
Resumo
O Grupo Flysch do Baixo Alentejo (GFBA) é a unidade mais ocidental da Zona Sul Portuguesa (ZSP; SW da Cintura Varisca Ibérica) e é constituído por depósitos siliciclásticos gravíticos formados numa sucessão turbidítica, com mais de cinco quilómetros de espessura (Oliveira, 1990). O GFBA é composto por três unidades litostratigráficas: as formações Mértola, Mira e Brejeira, que se tornam mais recentes no sentido SW, em faixas paralelas NW-SE, devido à progradação do sistema deposicional turbidítico.
A Formação Brejeira (idade Bashkiriano a Moscoviano superior, Pennsylvánico; Pereira,
1999)	é a mais recente das três unidades litostratigráficas, com um quilómetro de espessura (Oliveira, 1990). É composta por grauvaques, quartzovaques e quartzitos impuros intercalados com xistos de baixo grau metamórfico (e.g. Oliveira et al, 1979). Esta formação esta dividida em duas faixas sedimentares. A parte norte, basal, aflora numa faixa estreita, de 5 a 10 quilómetros de largura, com espessas camadas de grauvaques intercaladas com xistos, num rácio grauvaque/xisto superior a 1. A parte sul é muito mais vasta (aflora numa faixa de 30 a 40 quilómetros de largura), apresentando camadas finas de grauvaques ricas em matriz, com um rácio grauvaque/xisto inferior a 1.
Xistos cinzentos escuros da Fm. Brejeira foram estudados neste trabalho com dois principais objectivos. O principal foi a análise de palinofácies, para caracterizar o contexto paleoambiental da Fm. Brejeira e o seu potencial como rocha geradora de hidrocarbonetos. O objectivo secundário foi a palinostratigrafia, para incluir novas localidades no esquema de biozonas de miosporos da Fm. Brejeira (Pereira, 1999).
Oito campanhas de campo, de dois a três dias, foram realizadas entre Novembro de 2015 e Outubro de 2017. Efectuaram-se levantamentos litostratigráficos nas praias de Medo da Fonte Santa e Cordoama. Cerca de setenta e cinco amostras foram recolhidas de treze localidades, de todas as biozonas da Fm. Brejeira (Pereira, 1999), maioritariamente de arribas costeiras, das praias de Zambujeira do Mar, Amoreira, Monte Clérigo, Medo da Fonte Santa, Penedo, Furna do Mirouço Norte e Cordoama, assim como de localidades afastadas da costa, como o corte de estrada Aljezur-Bensafrim, Vale da Bordeira, Pedralva; e na foz de um ribeiro, no Mareadouro da Escada. A matéria orgânica foi extraída usando métodos palinológicos convencionais, que incluem reacções com os ácidos clorídrico e fluorídrico. Para cada amostra, foram preparadas lâminas palinológicas com resíduos orgânicos não-filtrados e com resíduos filtrados a 15pm.
Neste trabalho, expõem-se resultados de trinta e três amostras. Pelo menos 300 partículas orgânicas foram contadas em cada lâmina. Na classificação palinológica seleccionada, os fitoclastos opacos foram divididos pela sua forma em alongados e equidimensionais. O diâmetro de vários fitoclastos equidimensionais foi medido até se obter um valor médio estável.
Os resíduos não-oxidados são compostos por partículas translúcidas de cor castanha escura a pretas, opacas. Em todas as amostras, os três grupos principais de querogénio estão presentes em proporções semelhantes: domínio de matéria orgânica amorfa (MOA), seguindo-se os fitoclastos (opacos &gt; translúcidos; opacos alongados &gt; opacos equidimensionais) e palinomorfos (esporos &gt; palinomorfos marinhos). A média de diâmetros dos fitoclastos equidimensionais é considerada pequena, todos abaixo de 40 pm. Leiosferas, algas e raros acritarcas são os palinomorfos marinhos presentes nas cenoses palinológicas.
Quando projectadas no diagrama ternário MOA-Fitoclastos-Palinomorfos, as amostras estão maioritariamente no campo IX, “Bacia subóxica-anóxica distal”, estendendo-se para o campo VI, “Plataforma subóxica-anóxica proximal”. Esta dispersão está relacionada com a quantidade de fitoclastos, transportados para o sistema deposicional por correntes turbidíticas. No diagrama ternário, não se observa agrupamentos das amostras em relação à biozona de onde provêem. As amostras da Zambujeira do Mar podem representar uma excepção porque, no seu conjunto, apresentam abundância em fitoclastos; este facto pode estar relacionado com a proximidade deste afloramento à faixa sedimentar grosseira, na parte norte da Fm. Brejeira.
Os dados palinológicos indicam um paleoambiente deposicional marinho, anóxico e com condições redutoras, que favoreceu a preservação de MOA. A abundância de fitoclastos, a maioria com pequenas dimensões, materializa a presença de correntes turbidíticas numa bacia distal. Adicionalmente, os rácios de fitoclastos indicam que o sistema deposicional estava distante da área-fonte de sedimentos. O querogénio da Fm. Brejeira está presentemente sobrematurado, mas deverá ter possuído potencial para gerar hidrocarbonetos, uma vez que a associação palinológica indica querogénio de tipo II &gt; I e assim com potencial gerador de óleo.
A extinção em massa do final do Devónico e subsequente intensa diminuição da presença de fitoplâncton marinho no Paleozoico terminal e início do Mesozoico (Carbónico, Pérmico e Triásico inferior; Riegel, 1996, 2001) pode explicar a baixa abundância de palinomorfos marinhos nas amostras estudadas.
Nove amostras de diferentes localidades foram seleccionadas para estudos de palinostratigrafia, representando todas as seis biozonas da Fm. Brejeira. As localidades foram projectadas no mapa zonal de biozonas da Fm. Brejeira (Pereira, 1999); as cenoses palinológicas recuperadas das amostras e identificadas foram comparadas com as ocorrências de taxa descritas previamente para cada biozona (e.g. Clayton et al., 1977; Pereira, 1997). Os resíduos filtrados seleccionados foram expostos à solução de Schultze com ácido nítrico fumante para o procedimento de oxidação, até a cor da matéria orgânica se tornar castanha média a clara (esta reacção pode demorar entre uma a sete horas, dependendo da amostra).
Os miosporos considerados espécies índex não foram encontrados nas biozonas que eles nomeiam, contudo algumas destas espécies foram encontradas em outras biozonas - e.g. Raistrickia fulva, devido ao seu amplo intervalo de ocorrência.
As cenoses palinológicas são de baixa a média diversidade (sempre menos de 30 taxa presentes por amostra), dominadas pelos géneros Lycospora e Densosporites, com ocorrências comuns de Savitrisporites, Crassispora, Lophotriletes, Leiotriletes e Cingulizonates.
Quatro géneros foram identificados pela primeira vez na Fm. Brejeira: Cyclogranisporites, e espécimes atribuídos tentativamente aos géneros Guthoerlisporites, Ibrahimisporites and Schulzospora.
Dezassete espécies identificadas representam primeiros registos na Fm. Brejeira: Acanthotriletes cf. microspinosus, Cyclogranisporites sp., Densosporites cf. glandulosus, Dictyotriletes muricatus, Leiotriletes cf. sphaerotriangularis, Lophotriletes cf. mosaicus, Lycospora cf. brevijuga, Lycospora noctuina, Lycospora cf. pellucida, Lycospora uber, Microreticulatisporites cf. nobilis, Punctatisporites aerarius, Punctatisporites minutus, Punctatisporites nitidus, Savitrisporites cf. cingulatus, Savitrisporites cf. majus, e Verrucosisporites microverrucosus. Um número significativo destes taxónes foram deixados em nomenclatura aberta devido a má preservação do material.
Na amostra da localidade de Pedralva, a cenose de miosporos corresponde à parte superior da biozona NJ. A suposição inicial de que esta amostra pertenceria à biozona SL foi afastada e o limite entre as biozonas NJ e SL, que não foi marcado por Pereira (1999), é agora delimitado, passando a Sul da localidade de Pedralva e a Norte da Praia de Quebradas, seguindo uma direcção NW-SE.
As amostras da Praia de Cordoama forneceram uma cenose de esporomorfos que indica o subandar regional Westphaliano D, incluído na biozona de miosporos OT, parte do andar Moscoviano.
Nas restantes amostras da Fm. Brejeira, as cenoses palinológicas não estão em desacordo com as ocorrências de miosporos descritas para as diferentes biozonas, apesar de não confirmarem a atribuição prévia a essa biozona.
Os resultados obtidos na presente tese são uma contribuição aos estudos palinológicos e de maturação orgânica previamente realizados no GFBA. No entanto, para caracterizar melhor o conteúdo em esporomorfos, não só nas novas localidades mas também nas previamente estudadas (que suportam o esquema biozonal de miosporos), mais trabalho de campo deveria ser realizado na Fm.
Brejeira, com recolha de novas amostras, para se obterem resultados adicionais e se completar o actual estado de conhecimento. Este é o plano para trabalhos futuros antes da publicação de resultados palinostratigráficos em revistas científicas especializadas.

Abstract
The Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) is the Westernmost unit of the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ; SW Variscan Chain) and consists of siliciclastic gravity-flow deposits forming a turbiditic succession, over five km thick (Oliveira, 1990), prograding from NE to SW.
The Brejeira Formation (Bashkirian to upper Moscovian in age, Pennsylvanian; Pereira, 1999) is the youngest of the three lithostratigraphic units of BAFG, with one km in thickness (Oliveira, 1990). It is composed of greywackes, quartzwackes and impure quartzites interbedded with shales (e.g. Oliveira et al. 1979).
Dark grey shales from the Brejeira Fm. were studied in this work with two main objectives. The primary goal was palynofacies analysis, to characterize the palaeoenvironmental setting of the Brejeira Fm. and its potential as a hydrocarbon source rock. The secondary objective was palynostratigraphy, to include new localities in the context of miospore zonal scheme of the Brejeira Fm. (Pereira, 1999).
Eight field campaigns (two to three days) were conducted from November 2015 to October 2017. Lithologic columns were made at Medo da Fonte Santa and Cordoama beaches. Around seventy-five samples were collected from thirteen localities, from all the biozones of the Brejeira Fm. (Pereira, 1999), mostly from coastal cliffs, between Zambujeira do Mar beach and Cordoama beach. Organic matter was extracted using standard palynological methods, involving treatment with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. Non-sieved organic residues of each samples were mounted in addition to 15pm-sieved residues.
In this work, results from thirty-three samples are discussed. At least 300 organic particles were counted in each slide. In the selected palynomorph classification, opaque phytoclasts were divided by their shape in lath and equant. The diameter of several equant opaque phytoclasts was measured until a stable average value was obtained.
The non-oxidized residues consist of dark brown to black opaque organic particles. In all samples, the proportion of the three main kerogen groups is similar: marine amorphous organic matter (AOM) dominant, followed by phytoclasts (opaque &gt; translucent; lath opaque &gt; equant opaque) and palynomorphs (spores &gt; marine palynomorphs). The average diameters of equant opaque phytoclasts are considered small, most of them under 40pm. Leiospheres, algae and rare acritarchs are the marine palynomorphs existent in the assemblages.
When projected in the AOM-Phytoclasts-Palynomorphs ternary diagram, the samples fall in the marine palynological fields VI and IX that range between “Proximal suboxic-anoxic shelf’ and “Distal suboxic-anoxic basin”. The palynological data indicate a marine depositional palaeoenvironment with sea floor anoxia and reducing conditions, that enhanced AOM preservation. The abundance of phytoclasts, most of them with small dimensions, materializes the input of turbiditic currents in a distal basin. Additionally, the phytoclast ratios indicate distance from the sediments source area. The kerogen from Brejeira Fm. is presently overmatured, but it must have had potential to generate hydrocarbons since the palynological association indicates type II &gt; I kerogen and therefore oil prone.
The end-Devonian mass extinction and subsequent marine Phytoplankton Blackout in the late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic (Carboniferous, Permian and early Triassic; Riegel, 1996, 2001) can explain the low abundance of marine palynomorphs.
Nine samples from different localities were selected for palynostratigraphical studies, and these covered all the six biozones of the Brejeira Fm. The localities were plotted in the miospore zonal map of the Brejeira Formation (Pereira, 1999); the recovered and identified palynological assemblages of the samples were compared with the described occurring taxa for each miospore biozone (e.g. Clayton et al, 1977; Pereira, 1997). The selected sieved residues were exposed to the Schultze solution with fuming nitric acid for the oxidation procedure, until the organic matter turned medium to light brown (between one to seven hours of reaction, depending on the sample).
The miospore index species were not found in the biozones which they name, although some of these species were found in other biozones - e.g. Raistrickia fulva, due to their wider stratigraphic range.
The palynological assemblages are of low to medium diversity (always less than 30 taxa per sample), dominated by the genera Lycospora and Densosporites, with common occurrences of Savitrisporites, Crassispora, Lophotriletes, Leiotriletes, and Cingulizonates.
Four genera were identified for the first time in the Brejeira Fm.: Cyclogranisporites, and specimens tentatively assigned to Guthoerlisporites, Ibrahimisporites and Schulzospora.
Seventeen species identified represent first records in the Brejeira Fm.: Acanthotriletes cf. microspinosus, Cyclogranisporites sp., Densosporites cf. glandulosus, Dictyotriletes muricatus, Leiotriletes cf. sphaerotriangularis, Lophotriletes cf. mosaicus, Lycospora cf. brevijuga, Lycospora noctuina, Lycospora cf. pellucida, Lycospora uber, Microreticulatisporites cf. nobilis, Punctatisporites aerarius, Punctatisporites minutus, Punctatisporites nitidus, Savitrisporites cf. cingulatus, Savitrisporites cf. majus, and Verrucosisporites microverrucosus. A significant number of these taxa were left in open nomenclature due to poor preservation.
In the studied sample from Pedralva locality, the miospore assemblage corresponds to the upper part of the NJ biozone. The initial assumption of this sample belonging to the SL biozone was ruled out and the boundary between NJ and SL biozones, not delimited by Pereira (1997, 1999), is now constrained, passing south of Pedralva locality and north of Quebradas Beach, following a NW-SE direction.
The Cordoama samples provided a sporomorph assemblage assignable to the Westphalian D age, within the OT miospore biozone, part of the Moscovian stage. In the other samples, the palynological assemblages are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for the different biozones, although they do not allow confirmation of previous biozone assignments.
The results obtained in this master thesis are a contribution to the palynologic and organic maturation studies previously done in BAFG. However, to better characterize the sporomorph content, not only in the new localities but also in those previously studied (which support the miospore zonal scheme), more fieldwork should be done in the Brejeira Fm, with collecting of new samples, to obtain additional results and to complete the current knowledge. This is the plan to future works before the publication of the palynostratigraphical results in specialized scientific journals.

1.	Introduction
Traditionally, deep water depositional environments are not considered favourable for source rock formation because the required organic particles (of terrestrial origin or from the oceanic euphotic zone) are subjected to degradation during its transport and decantation through the water column (Demaison and Moore, 1980 and Suess, 1980, in Huc et al., 2001). Anoxic conditions near the seafloor were the common explanation for the occurrence of source rocks in deep water sedimentary systems (Huc et al, 2001). The abundance of oil and gas discoveries in deep water systems (Stow and Mayall, 2000) is explained in recent research (e.g. Huc et al., 2001; Stow et al., 2001): there are more processes involved in the deposition of fine-grained units (possible source rocks; Fig. 1.1) and more factors conditioning the organic matter preservation (Fig. 1.2) than previously thought. The two following images summarize sedimentary processes and organic matter preservation in deep water settings.

The Pennsylvanian Brejeira Fm. is the southernmost and youngest unit of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG), one of the geological domains of the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ), located in the southern branch of the Variscan Chain (e.g. Schermerhorn, 1971; Ribeiro et al., 1979; Oliveira et al, 1979). The BAFG has been studied in terms of stratigraphic evolution and biostratigraphy by Oliveira et al. (1979), Oliveira and Wagner-Gentis (1983), Oliveira (1983, 1990), Korn (1997) and Pereira et al. (2007, 2008). Further details are given in the following sections.
The Brejeira Fm., a fine-grained unit with abundance of dark grey shales, deposited by gravity flows in a turbitic-dominated system and outcropping in a vast area (e.g. Oliveira et al., 1979), is here revisited focusing on its potential as a hydrocarbon source rock.
1.1.	Objectives
This work is divided in two main objectives:
1)	Primary objective: Palynofacies analysis. To characterize the palaeoenvironmental setting of the Brejeira Fm. and its potential as a hydrocarbon source rock. Previous data from organic geochemistry and thermal maturation (McCormack et al., 2007; Fernandes et al., 2012; Barberes, 2013; Barberes et al., 2014) is compared with the results obtained.
2)	Secondary objective: Palynostratigraphy. To include new localities in the context of miospore zonal scheme of the Brejeira Fm. (Pereira, 1999).
The term palynofacies was introduced by Combaz (1964) and the concept has been successfully used for palaeoenvironmental interpretations and source rock assessment since then. Palynofacies is based on the study, usually quantified, of particulate organic matter obtained by maceration of sedimentary rocks (Tyson, 1993), as observed under transmitted light microscopy. The relative and absolute percentages of land- and marine-derived palynomorphs provide valuable information for the determination of sedimentary facies. Similarly, the quantification of oil- and gas-prone organic particles allows a rapid and semi-quantitative assessment of source rocks. Detailed
palynofacies analysis include not only the ratios organic particle types, such as amorphous organic matter, phytoclasts and palynomorphs, but also details on particle size, shapes and opacity of phytoclasts, among other parameters (Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Steffen and Gorin, 1993; Tyson, 1993, 1995). This type of analysis, especially when coupled with sedimentological data allows the characterization of paleoenvironments and to depict distal-proximal trends (e.g. Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Gotz et al., 2008; Carvalho et al., 2013).
Pereira (1997, 1999) and Pereira et al. (2007, 2008, and references herein) recognised twenty three miospore biozones of the Western European Miospore Zonation (Clayton et al., 1977), ranging from lower Givetian to upper Moscovian, in the SPZ (six in the Brejeira Fm.). The defined miospore zonal scheme and the detail achieved in the SPZ makes palynostratigraphy the elected method to date lithostratigraphic units, which has proven extremely useful for mineral exploration companies in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB).
Preliminary results of this work were presented in scientific meetings (Esteves et al, 2016, 2017). A paper (Esteves et al., submitted) and other results are expected to be published in specialized journals.
2.	Geological and geographical setting
2.1.	Geography and nature of the outcrops
The study area is located in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 2.1), specifically included in Beja and Faro Districts, Portugal. Zambujeira do Mar Beach is the northernmost locality, and Cordoama Beach the southermost. The eastern study point is the ALJ-ROG1 borehole, and the western limit is the coast line (Fig. 2.2).
The study area belongs to the Brejeira Formation, the youngest unit of SPZ. The sampling localities (symbols in Fig. 2.2) were selected to represent the different miospore biozones of the Brejeira Formation (Pereira, 1999).
For this work, the best outcrops were the coastal cliffs of the Brejeira Fm.: Zambujeira do Mar, Amoreira, Monte Clérigo, Medo da Fonte Santa, Penedo, Furna do Mirouco North and Cordoama beaches. The most suitable outcrops distant from the coast line are road cuts, ~2 m tall, moderately weathered: Aljezur-Bensafrim road, Vale da Bordeira and Pedralva localities; and river valleys like Mareadouro da Escada locality. Cuttings from the ALJ-ROG1 borehole were made available by Portfuel.
2.2.	South Portuguese Zone (SPZ)
The SPZ is the southern zone of the Iberian Variscides, comprising Devonian and Carboniferous rocks (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983; and references therein). It is interpreted as an external thrust belt and foreland basin (e.g. Oliveira and Quesada, 1998). The northern boundary between the SPZ and the Precambrian-Palaeozoic rocks of the Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) is marked by the Beja-Acebuches Ophiolite Complex (e.g. Fonseca et al., 1999). To the south, the SPZ is unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 2.1).
Within the SPZ the following geological domains are defined, based on lithology, deformation style and age, from NE to SW: the Pulo do Lobo Domain (PLD), the IPB, the BAFG and the Southwest Portugal Domain (SWP) (Oliveira, 1990) - Fig. 2.1.
The antiformal structure of the PLD has been interpreted as an accretionary prism related to northward dipping subduction and overlaying sediments of a deep sedimentary basin (Oliveira et al., 2013, and references therein).
The IPB (Late Devonian to Mississippian; e.g. Pereira, 2007, 2008) was part of a shallowmarine siliciclastic platform that underwent crustal extension, this process being the cause of a bimodal volcanism (Schermerhorn, 1971; Munhá, 1983) in a submarine environment (e.g. Oliveira, 1990).
The BAFG comprises the Mértola, Mira and Brejeira formations (Oliveira et al., 1979) -details in the following subchapter.
The SWP is represented by Bordeira and Aljezur antiforms. These expose similar lithostratigraphic sequences: shales and quartzites of the Tercenas Fm., shaly/carbonate succession -Carrapateira Group, including Bordalete, Murracao and Quebradas formations (Oliveira et al, 1985; Pereira, 1997; Pereira et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2013). This domain was part of the shallow siliciclastic sea (Late Devonian) and evolved to a carbonate/shale platform (Oliveira, 1983, 1990; Oliveira et al., 1985).

2.3.	Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG)
The BAFG consists mostly of gravity flow deposits, turbidite-dominated, deposited as a result of the oblique collision between the SPZ and the OMZ (e.g. Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983). This major compressive regime promoted the development of a highly subsidizing sedimentary basin, probably in a foreland context, where over five km thick BAFG deposits accumulated (e.g. Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 1990). The group comprises three lithostratigraphic units, from base to top: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira formations; all three formations become younger to the SW, in roughly parallel NW-SE bands, related to the southwestward progradation of the depositional system (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira 1983). The miospore biozones recognized by Pereira (1997, 1999) and Pereira et al. (2007, 2008, and previous works) are consistent with the ammonoid data recovered from all the BAFG formations (e.g. Oliveira et al., 1979; Korn, 1997).
The upper Viséan Mértola Fm. has a greywacke/shale ratio usually &gt; 1, presenting abundant and thick turbiditic beds (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al., 2007, 2008). Proximal facies of gravity flows predominate when approaching the contact with the IPB (Oliveira and Wagner-Gentis, 1983).
The upper Viséan to lower Bashkirian Mira Fm. is dominated by thin-bedded turbidites and show a greywacke/shale ratio &amp;lt;1, evidencing a deposition far from the sediment source area (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al., 2007, 2008). The transition between Mira and Brejeira formations is represented by the gradation of thin-bedded turbidites into thicker centimetric to decimetric greywackes (Oliveira et al, 1979; Oliveira, 1983).
The mid Bashkirian to upper Moscovian Brejeira Fm. is divided in two sedimentary belts (see Fig. 2.1). The northern, basal part outcrops in a narrow 5 to 10 km wide belt, with thick beds of matrix-poor greywackes interbedded with shales, in a ratio greywacke/shale &gt; 1 (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al, 2007, 2008). The southern, upper part is much thicker (outcrops in a 30 to 40 km wide
band), presenting thinner-bedded matrix-rich greywackes, characterized by a greywacke/shale ratio &amp;lt;1 (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983).
Mértola and Brejeira formations were locally divided into members (Mértola Fm. by Oliveira and Silva, 1988; Brejeira Fm. by Ribeiro et al., 1987), but these have only local significance.
Geochemical signatures studies of the three BAFG formations reveal a sediment provenance mainly from the SW border of the OMZ, and with a contribution of an external (Avalonian) source, more markedly in the Brejeira Formation (Jorge et al., 2013). The detrital zircon geochronology performed by Rodrigues et al. (2015) indicates a provenance for Mértola and Mira formations from extrabasinal (OMZ) and intrabasinal (SPZ) source areas. The abundance of older zircons in the Brejeira Fm. suggests a provenance mainly from Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Pereira et al, 2013; Rodrigues et al. 2015). Rodrigues et al., (2015) proposes the existence of a physical, continuous barrier (active from mid-Viséan times) between the main depositional areas of Mértola-Mira and Brejeira formations.
2.4.	Palynostratigraphy of Brejeira Fm.
The previous palynostratigraphical studies of the Brejeira Fm. allowed to the recognition of six miospore biozones (Fig. 2.2, adapted from Pereira, 1997, 1999, fig. 26: Fig. 2.3, adapted from Pereira et al, 2007, 2008) of the Western Europe Miospore Zonation (Clayton et al., 1977).
The FR miospore Biozone (mid Bashkirian age) has Raistrickia fulva and Reticulatisporites reticulatus as index species (Clayton et al., 1977). Samples from the basal part of Brejeira Fm. indicated the FR Biozone: Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) identified the index species Reticulatisporites reticulatus in the lower part and the species Dyctiotriletes probireticulatus in the upper part of the zone.
The SS miospore Biozone has Triquitrites sinani and Cirratriradites saturni as index species (Clayton et al., 1977). Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) considers only Cirratriradites saturni as the index species of this biozone in the Brejeira Fm.
The RA miospore Biozone is limited by the occurrence of the index species Radiizonates aligerens (Clayton et al., 1977; Pereira et al, 2007, 2008).
The base of the NJ miospore Biozone is marked by the appearance of the index species Microreticulatisporites nobilis and Florinites junior (Clayton et al., 1977). Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) found the RA/NJ biozonal boundary in the Pincho Road section, indicated by the first occurrence of Florinites junior.
The lower limit of the SL miospore Biozone coincides with the appearance of the first monolete spores of the genus Torispora and has Torispora securis and T. laevigata as index species (Clayton et al., 1977). Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) identified the SL miospore Biozone in the Brejeira Fm. by the first appearance of Torispora securis, the presence of Cadiospora magna and, in the upper part of the zone, the occurrence of the species Raistrickia aculeata.
The first occurrence of monolete verrucose spores of the genus Thymospora marks the base of OT miospore Biozone (upper Moscovian age); the index species of this biozone are Thymospora obscura and T. thiessenii (Clayton et al., 1977). Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) indicates the occurrence of T. pseudothiessenii and the common presence of the index species T. obscura and T. thiessenii.

3.	Material and methods
The works of Batten (1999), Pereira (1997) and Machado (2010) were the base of the standard methods, rules and advices followed in this thesis, detailed below.
3.1.	Field work
The map which depicts the miospore zonation from the Brejeira Formation (Pereira, 1999) was used as a base for field work planning, allowing the sampling of different outcrops and with the aim of sampling the different biozones. Eight field work campaigns of two to three days were conducted, between November 2015 and October 2017.
Logging of stratigraphic sections was conducted at the Medo da Fonte Santa (Figs. 5.2 and 5.3) and Cordoama (Fig. 5.5) beaches (sedimentary facies and paleocurrent distribution pattern of these two localities were also studied by Hanganu, 2016). This consists in the elaboration of lithological columns, using metric tape measures and the description of the lithology, colour, grain size, sedimentary structures and other relevant geologic features found within the described beds.
In small outcrops/road-cuts, the exposure was not enough to log lithological columns. GPS points were collected from all the sampled localities.
3.2.	Sampling
The sampling for palynological studies followed strict rules, to assure the collection of unweathered samples and as close as possible to the original sedimentary rock. Thus, mineralized zones that show signs of oxidation, deformation, fractured, faulted and other penetrating surfaces, where preferential weathering takes place, were avoided. The outermost parts of the outcrops usually show more evidence of oxidation and are contaminated with recent organic particles, reason for which samples were taken about 10 cm into the outcrop.
The collected shales always represent the top of a turbiditic event, the so called Te division of the Bouma sequence (Shanmugam, 1997). Around one hundred grams of shale were collected for each sample and bagged in a resistant and previously labelled plastic bag.
Borehole samples consist of washed cuttings, from a drillhole with limited litostratigraphical control. Sampling was done each 6 meters.
In the coastal cliffs (e.g. southern cliff of the Medo da Fonte Santa Beach), continuous monocline sequences of several meters were found where the sampling was conducted. using a predetermined sampling interval, the closest unweathered dark grey shales were sampled: in Vale Figueiras Beach and Cordoama Beach, the sampling was performed every three meters; five meters for Medo da Fonte Santa Beach. Additional samples were occasionally taken from beds in the outcrops where changes in lithologies, sedimentary structures or colour were found.
The spot samples were taken from small road-cuts/outcrops, to achieve a more complete sampling of all the miospore biozones (Pereira, 1999). Only one or two samples were collected in each outcrop due to the lack of exposure and/or to the weathering of the sections.
Thirty-three samples were selected and processed for palynological studies; these are divisible in seven different groups:
- Cliffs of the Zambujeira do Mar Beach: three samples;
-	ALJ-ROG1 borehole, at the Rogil locality: two different samples of cuttings from different depth intervals;
-	Southern cliff of the Medo da Fonte Santa Beach: ten samples;
-	Northern cliff of the Cordoama Beach: seven samples;
-	Shale Gas Project - Portugal; Partex/Repsol/Universities (Lisbon &amp;amp; Coimbra): nine samples, previously analysed for Total Organic Carbon (TOC);
-	Small outcrops/roadcuts: three spot samples.
All these samples, macerated residues and palynological slides are deposited at the Experimental Geology Laboratory (LabGExp), room 6.3.67, Geology Department, FCUL.
3.3.	Physical disintegration
Wrapped in a plastic bag, the samples were crushed with a hammer until most of the particles were broken down to a few millimetres. This first step was performed at the Sampling Processing Laboratory at Geology Department, FCUL.
About 15-20 g were obtained from approximately 100 g of initial samples, sieved to 1-2 mm sizes. The sieving was done at the Stratigraphy Laboratory of the Geology Department, FCUL.
3.4.	Chemical processing
For the first set of samples, this part of the preparation (as for steps 5 and 7) took place at the Laboratory of the GeoResources/ “Institut fur Geowissenschaften”, Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg; the remaining samples were chemically processed at the Stratigraphy Laboratory at Geology Department, in FCUL.
The particles with the ideal size were put into 1 L plastic bottles with 500 ml of tap water. After swivelling, the particles which floated in the water column were poured off. This step was repeated until the sample was free of the particles of the dust fraction (that would consume the acids without need and produce no palynomorphs).
3.4.1.	Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
HCl is used to dissolve carbonate minerals present in the rock samples. When tested for carbonate, most of the samples did not show a significant reaction but this procedure was performed anyway, as precaution.
About 50 ml of HCl were added to each sample. This acid promotes the release of metal content in some rocks, especially Fe oxides, in the form of a green liquid - observed in most of the samples analysed.
After complete reaction, which normally takes some hours or simply runs “overnight”, follows one neutralisation cycle with tap water.
3.4.2.	Hydrofluoric acid (HF)
100 to 150 ml of HF were added to 10-15 g of clean crushed samples, to remove silica and silicate minerals.
At GeoResources, 30 samples were left to react overnight with HF of a concentration of 50%. At the Laboratory of Stratigraphy (FCUL), three sets of 15 samples were left to react with 40% HF for a week.
The bottles were stirred frequently in the first hour of reaction and then every 24 hours.
Neutralization is done by successive dilution-decanting cycles until the liquid is neutral, which is obtained after four or five cycles. HF was decanted off into plastic containers and stored for safe disposal.
3.4.3.	Second HCl attack
After HF attack, Ca fluorides, other neo-formed and undissolved minerals are very frequently present in the samples and they are removed with a second HCl attack.
Previously, for every sample, the organic residues were divided: a small portion of the neutralised non-sieved residue was kept in a glass beaker; the remaining was sieved through a 15 qm mesh (see more details in the following subchapter) and stored in a second glass beaker.
The standard method used was to boil the two portions of each residue in a 10% HCl solution, using a thermal plate for a period of about 15 minutes. Thereafter followed one cycle of neutralisation with distilled water and the unsieved residues were stored in small plastic bottles.
3.5.	Sieving
Most organic residues have significant amounts of very small particulate oM and AoM. These fine particles of kerogen can render palynomorphs observation quite difficult.
After the second HCl attack, the sieved organic residues were sieved again through a 15 qm mesh, this time with distilled water, and stored in small plastic bottles.
3.6.	Oxidation
Part of the sieved organic residues of the selected samples (the ones richer in palynomorphs) was oxidized to enable palynostratigraphical studies. The main purpose of this technique was to lighten the colour of the palynomorphs, but it is also useful to clear some of the unwanted organic particles (Batten, 1999).
Schultze’s reagent, an oxidizing mixture of a saturated aqueous solution of KClO3 and fuming nitric acid (~ 90% nitric acid), was added to the organic residues (Traverse, 2007). Commonly, different samples in the same geological formation should present similar oxidation times. After several attempts to oxidize the samples from Brejeira Fm., it is reported that the reaction can take between one to seven hours to obtain an organic residue with a medium-light brown colour. Thus, the better way to proceed in this set of samples was checking the organic residue every 30 minutes until we obtain the needed lighter colouration for the organic matter. once we get a successful oxidation, the organic residue was neutralized (Pereira, 1997; Batten, 1999; Bruch and Pross, 1999).
3.7.	Mounting (to observe with transmitted light)
The mounting started with the extraction of the residue in the aqueous solution, using a pipette. To obtain a representative portion of all components, the sample bottle was brandished, and some millilitres were taken out of the middle of the suspended particles. The residue inside the pipette was diluted enough to present a light grey colour. Drops of this solution were added onto a cover slip,
until they form a convex meniscus. The solution dried overnight, and the cover slips with the organic material were glued to the slides.
The mounting medium was the Entellan new (it is permanent and does not need sealing).
3.8.	Optical examination
Optical examination was carried out using a transmitted light microscope Olympus BX40 with an attached OptixCam Summit K2 camera. The palynological slides were observed with a 40X objective. The microphotographs were obtained with 40X and 100X objectives.
3.9.	Palynofacies analysis
For each sample, two different types of slides were made to perform two types of analysis:
1.	Total particulate organic matter content analysis as observed on slides produced from unsieved residues (Fig. 4.1. A). The three main categories of kerogen were considered - amorphous organic matter (AOM), phytoclasts and palynomorphs - to plot in the Tyson ternary diagram for palynofacies (Tyson, 1993).
2.	Normalized ratios of selected particles and measure of the diameter of sufficient equant opaque phytoclasts after observation of slides produced from 15qm-sieved organic residues (Fig. 4.1. B). In the selected palynomorph classification (Fig. 4.1. C-V): phytoclasts were divided in translucent and opaque phytoclasts; opaque phytoclasts were separated by their shape in lath and equant categories; “amorphous” particles that show angular outlines were interpreted and counted as degraded phytoclasts; palynomorphs differentiation was limited to a few categories - sporomorphs, leiospheres, algae, acritarchs and grey tissues/zooclasts - due to general poor quality and low diversity of the organic residues obtained.
At least 300 organic particles were counted in each slide. Smaller and heavily degraded particles that could be positively identified were not counted (always less than 10% of the total palynological association).
3.10.	Organic matter normalized ratios and parameters
The following ratios and parameters, described by Tyson (1993), were chosen:
1.	Opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio. The higher the value, the richer in opaque phytoclasts the sample is. In marine sediments, the previous relation reflects a distal depositional environment (Tyson, 1993). The following formula was used:
OPNR = Opaque phytoclasts / (Opaque + Translucent phytoclasts)
2.	Lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio. A high value indicates abundance of lathshaped opaque phytoclasts, which increases in more distal environments (Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Tyson, 1995). It is obtained by:
LOPNR = Lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts / (Lath-shaped + Equant opaque phytoclasts)
3.	Marine palynomorphs normalized ratio. This ratio generally increases offshore and it can be used as an indicator of sea-level changes (Steffen and Gorin, 1993). The applied formula was:
MPNR = Marine palynomorphs / (Marine + Continental palynomorphs)
4.	Average diameter of equant opaque phytoclast particles. The diameter of equant opaque phytoclasts (square or round) was measured until the amount was sufficient to obtain a stable average value. Particle size decreases in an offshore direction, controlled by granulometric composition of the sediment, proximity to source and by the presence (or absence) of macroscopic debris that could break into smaller particles (Tyson, 1993).
These ratios and parameters of the palynofacies analysis are closely related with proximal-distal trends, one of the principal controls on particulate organic matter distribution in marine environments (Tyson and Follows, 2000). The results were plotted aside of the stratigraphic logs.
of the analysed samples, nine had ToC values obtained from previous works (Barberes, 2013), which were compared to several particle types and parameters.
3.11.	Other methods
The samples used from the project funded by Partex S.G.P.S./Repsol consortium, had the TOC values obtained at Weatherford Laboratories.
All the counting values, statistics and graphics were plotted and analysed in Microsoft Excel. The software TriDraw was used to plot the palynological values in the ternary diagram, later edited in Adobe illustrator. The maps and logs, as well as the last alterations in the images, were made in Adobe illustrator. Between three and six microphotographs of the same spore at different focus distances were combine into a focused image using Helicon Focus. The plates were made using the Adobe Photoshop.
The palynological procedures used in this work are summarized in the following scheme (Fig. 3.1).

4.	Palynological content
All the organic residues were composed of dark brown to black opaque organic particles, divided in the following groups, based on the classifications of Tyson (1993, 1995):
4.1.	Phytoclasts
Phytoclasts are plant-derived, fragmentary, resistant-walled particles, indicating terrestrial input (Traverse, 2007). These organic particles can be subdivided based on their different stages of oxidation, degradation and shape (Tyson, 1995).
Cuticles, mostly derived from leaves, are translucent phytoclasts with clear cellular structures, easily deteriorated (Fig. 4.1. C; Tyson, 1995). Vitrinite is translucent, with a colour range from pale orange to dark brown (Fig. 4.1. D); through thermal maturation, the original colour will become darker: semi-opaque dark brown vitrinite particles can be confused with inertinite (Tyson, 1995). inertinite is opaque up to edge, oxidised wood of terrestrial origin. This category was divided in lath (Fig. 4.1. G) and equant (Fig. 4.1. H, square, and I, round) by their shape, that reacts differently to transport (Tyson, 1995). Vitrinite and inertinite can present biostructuration (Fig.4.1. D and 4.1. F).
Heavily degraded phytoclasts commonly maintain their sharp edges (Fig. 4.1. E). This characteristic allowed their differentiation from AOM, that has an irregular outline (Fig. 4.1. J).
4.2.	Sporomorphs
Terrestrial-derived, spores are produced during the life cycle of ‘lowly’ bryophytes and ferns while pollen by the ‘higher plants’, the conifers and angiosperms; both organic particles have a resistant wall (exine), variable in thickness and ornamentation (Armstrong and Brasier, 2005; Traverse, 2007).
Spores frequently occur as fossils from Silurian to Recent times (Traverse, 2007). Trilete spores have a three laesurae, pronged marks, resembling an upper-case “Y”; monolete spores have one laesurae and are typically less common (Armstrong and Brasier, 2005; Traverse, 2007).
Pollen range from latest Devonian to Recent times (Traverse, 2007). Their definition is functional and not morphological: “the microspore wall of seed plants, plus the microgametophyte that develops within the wall” (Traverse, 2007, p. 11). Between spores and pollen, prepollen are functional pollen grains with morphological features of spores (e.g. trilete laesurae) and represents the stage at which microspores still germinated proximally (Chaloner, 1970b in Traverse, 2007).
4.3.	AOM
Heterogeneous particles that can present inclusions, structureless with diffuse edges (Tyson, 1995; McArthur et al., 2017). It can have terrestrial or marine origin (in the latter, representing plankton faecal pellets, larger bacterially degraded mats, and/or marine OM degraded by bacteria) (Tyson, 1995; McArthur et al., 2017).
In the studied samples, the AOM was dark brown to black (Fig. 4.1. J), interpreted as marine (mostly, since all the structureless particles with sharp edges were considered as degraded phytoclasts
and excluded of the “AOM” category) and autochthonous (mostly, since the uppermost and fresh part of the shale/Te Bouma division was sampled).
4.4.	Marine phytoplankton
Acritarchs (Evitt, 1963) are an informal incerta sedis “group”, polyphyletic and with unknown biological affinity (Tyson, 1995; Armstrong and Brasier, 2005). These unicellular (rarely multicellular) palynomorphs have been divided in morphological subgroups because of their varied ornamentation and unknown producers (Tyson, 1995; Armstrong and Brasier, 2005; Traverse, 2007).
Accepted as marine phytoplankton (Tappan, 1980, p. 199 in Tyson, 1995), acritarchs range from Precambrian to Recent times, and attained their greatest abundance and diversity in early Palaeozoic (Servais, 1996; Armstrong and Brasier, 2005; Traverse, 2007 and references therein).
The rare acritarchs observed in the Brejeira Fm. samples were dark brown to black coloured, with a spiny ornamentation (Figs. 4.1. N and 4.2).
Leiospheres (name without taxonomic implications) are thin-walled, smooth or slightly ornamented, spherical particles, with algal relationship (Traverse, 2007; Lindgren, 2009). These palynomorphs are commonly observed with the walls folded (H. Jager,pers. comm., 2015). Spherical palynomorphs like leiospheres range from pre-Cambrian to Recent (Lindgren, 2009).
Most organic residues contained rare leiospheres (Fig. 4.1. O), mostly as fragments (Fig. 4.1. P), with a brownish colour, thin and folded walls, spherical and without ornamentation.
Microscopic algae range from Ordovician to present times (Traverse, 2007). Algae can be multicellular or unicellular, most are photoautotrophic and carry on photosynthesis, but some forms are chemoheterotrophic, constituting a polyphyletic group.
In the Brejeira Fm. samples, algae are smaller than all the sporomorphs, single-celled, brownish spherical or ellipsoidal forms (Fig. 4.1. Q)
4.5.	Zooclasts and grey tissues
Zooclasts are organic particles of animal origin that occur as unidentifiable fragments, in the palynomorphs size range, and can have biostructures (Fig. 4.1. R, S and T). Examples include arthropod exoskeleton debris, organic linings from some bivalve shells, ostracod carapaces, and graptolite fragments (Tyson, 1995; Traverse, 2007).
In Brejeira Fm. samples, grey tissues are translucent, structureless, thin membranes with a greyish brown colour and torn appearance. Although the origin is unknow, the outline and the absence of morphological characteristics points to a possible classification as zooclasts.
4.6.	others
Faecal pellets are a significant source of AOM aggregates but can also occur isolated. These particles are larger than many other in the palynological associations, with an amorphous interior held together by a resistant ‘peritrophic’ membrane, making the outline roundish and continuous (Tyson, 1995, and the references therein; Fig. 4.1. U).
Filaments are organic particles with the appearance of elongate ‘strings' and can have different sources (Fig.4.1. V). These organic particles are opaque, very rare in the palynological associations of the Brejeira Fm. and were considered related to and counted as phytoclasts.

5.	Palynofacies analysis
5.1.	Total particulate organic matter analysis
All the organic residues were composed of dark brown to black opaque organic particles.
All samples show similar proportions of the three main kerogen groups. AoM (mostly marine) is dominant, followed by phytoclasts (translucent ~ opaque phytoclasts; lath opaque &gt; equant opaque phytoclasts) and palynomorphs (sporomorphs &gt; marine palynomorphs). Marine palynomorphs -leiospheres, algae and acritarchs - were present in most samples, but these are invariably rare.
When projected in the AoM-Phytoclasts-Palynomorphs ternary diagram for palynofacies (Tyson, 1993; Fig. 5.1), the samples are concentrated in the marine palynological field IX but extend into the VI, ranging between “Distal suboxic-anoxic basin” and “Proximal suboxic-anoxic shelf”. Palynomorphs are statistically irrelevant. There is little differentiation between samples of different miospore biozones. The Zambujeira do Mar beach samples, in the FR miospore biozone, could represent the only exception: although somehow dispersed, all of them are located farther from the AoM corner.

Palynofacies and palynostratigraphy of the Pennsylvanian Brejeira Formation, SW Portugal
For most of the samples (Figs. 5.4 and 5.5), the palynological associations have similar proportion of translucent and opaque phytoclasts, lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts present dominance over equant opaque phytoclasts and continental palynomorphs are more abundant than marine palynomorphs.
In the Medo da Fonte Santa Beach section (Figs. 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4), the ratios “opaque phytoclasts” and “marine palynomorphs” show a symmetrical distribution while, in the Cordoama 1 (Fig. 5.5), reveal a parallel arrangement. The lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio and the average diameter of equant opaque phytoclasts, in Medo da Fonte Santa and Cordoama 1 sections, show unexpected opposite signals in the distal-proximal trends. The samples from Cordoama 2 (Fig. 5.5) display very small variations. The average diameters of equant opaque phytoclasts in all the studied samples present a minimum value of 27,5 pm, a maximum value of 42,8 pm and a mean of 34,9 pm.
The comparison of organic matter types with ToC values show a negative correlation between the proportion of AOM with TOC and a positive correlation of phytoclasts with TOC (Fig. 5.6. [A]), albeit both with some dispersal. Palynomorphs also correlate positively with ToC, although their low proportion in all samples precludes firm conclusions. Within the calculated ratios, the lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio is the one that has a defined correlation (again positive) with ToC (Fig. 5.6. [B]). All other parameters show a significant dispersal of data with weak correlation with ToC.

5.3.	Discussion
The dispersal of data in the Tyson diagram is related to the abundance of phytoclasts and, therefore, the terrestrial input in the depositional system. There is no clear differentiation between samples according to the miospore biozone they belong to. The distribution of the Zambujeira do Mar beach samples, with samples slightly more abundant in phytoclasts, could indicate a relation with the northern, more proximal sedimentary belt of Brejeira Fm.
All samples show apparent high maturity, as indicated by the dark brown and black colours in all particle types and opacity (except in very thin walled particles). This fact, summed with the low diversity of the organic residues, limits the applicability of many palynofacies parameters described in the literature. Thus, within the ratios and parameters used in this study the lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio and average diameters of equant opaque phytoclasts are considered to be more reliable, while the opaque/translucent ratio can be significantly biased due to observational difficulties. in the oxidized organic residues, it was noticed that vitrinite is always much more abundant than the inertinite particles. This means that a considerable number of particles counted as inertinite may be instead vitrinite with a very dark brown colour. The age of the samples (Pennsylvanian) coincides with the Phytoplankton Blackout (Riegel, 1996, 2001) which limits the applicability of any ratio or parameter that use marine palynomorphs.
The small variety of equant opaque phytoclast particle sizes in the Brejeira Fm. is considered an indicator of distal marine settings (Tyson, 1993; Tyson and Follows, 2000).
More samples and stratigraphical data were collected but, since the preliminary results showed homogeneity with the absence of significant peaks or trends, it was decided to pause this analysis and to continue with the secondary objective of this thesis.
Despite the slightly negative correlation of AOM with TOC values and the slightly positive correlations of phytoclasts and palynomorphs with TOC, all these correlations are weak (Fig. 5.6. [A]). Within the calculated ratios, the lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio is the one that has a defined the highest positive correlation with TOC (Fig. 5.6. [B]). Since lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio increases offshore (Tyson, 1995), the good positive correlation suggests organic carbon content increases towards more distal settings.
it should be mentioned that the range of TOC variability is low, corresponding to posthydrocarbon expulsion values, limiting the significance of the correlation with palynofacies parameters. in addition, knowing the heavier hydrocarbons are generated and expelled first as temperature increases, the rocks richer in oil-prone particles (notably AOM) would be relatively depleted in TOC, compared with more gas-prone rocks (phytoclast-rich), which would retain hydrocarbons over wider ranges of temperatures.
6.	Palynostratigraphy
Following the standard Western Europe Miospore Zonation (Clayton et al., 1977), Pereira (1997, 1999) and Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) recognized the miospore biozones and their respective boundaries in the Brejeira Formation.
In this work, the localities studied for palynostratigraphy were plotted in the miospore zonal map of the Brejeira Formation (Pereira, 1999) - see Fig. 2.2. The palynological association recovered and identified in each sample was compared with the described occurrence of taxa for the miospore biozone (e.g. Clayton et al., 1977; Pereira, 1997) where the respective locality was plotted.
All the organic residues processed to perform taxonomy in miospores were productive, with very different oxidation times: from one hour (e.g. Penedo Beach and Vale da Bordeira outcrops) to seven hours (e.g. Aljezur-Bensafrim road and Cordoama Beach outcrops). The palynomorph assemblages are composed of badly preserved miospores.
The classification of the miospores follows the international Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (McNeill et al., 2012).
6.1.	Raistrickia fulva - Reticulatisporites reticulatus (FR) Zone
Zambujeira do Mar Beach was previously studied and the palynological association assigned to FR miospore biozone (Pereira, 1997, 1999). One sample of this locality (PZM-N) was prepared and needed three hours of exposure to the Schultze solution.
The ALJ-ROG1 borehole is a new studied locality, plotted in the FR biozone. One sample (PF1-150m) needed two to four hours of exposure to the Schultze solution to be prepared for miospore observation.
Both palynological assemblages are dominated by Crassispora, Lophotriletes and Lycospora; and with common occurrences of Densosporites, Granulatisporites, Savitrisporites and Verrucosisporites. Most taxa in open nomenclature due to poor preservation (Tab. 6.1).

The FR miospore biozone index species were not found in the samples examined. The known stratigraphic range of Densosporites spinifer Hoffmeister et al., 1955 is Visean to Namurian (Pendleton, 2012); therefore, the presence of Densosporites cf. spinifer (in PF1-150m sample; Fig. 6.1. (C)) agrees with the age assigned to this biozone. The other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for this biozone, although they do not allow confirmation of the biozone assignment.
Two genera were reported for the first time in the FR miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Verrucosisporites; and a form assigned tentatively to the genus Waltzispora. In addition, among the taxa identified, the following three species represent also first records in the FR miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Lophotriletes cf. mosaicus; Punctatisporites minutus; and Verrucosisporites sp.

6.2.	Triquitrites sinani - Cirratriradites saturni (SS) Zone
Medo da Fonte Santa Beach is a new studied locality, plotted in the SS miospore biozone (Fig. 2.2). One sample (PM-25) needed one hour of exposure to Schultze solution to be prepared for miospore observation.
The palynological assemblage is dominated by Lycospora and Densosporites, and with common occurrences of Savitrisporites, Crassispora, and Lophotriletes. Most taxa in the list of occurrences are in open nomenclature due to poor preservation:

The SS miospore biozone index species were not found in the studied sample. Lycospora brevijuga Kosanke, 1950 appears in Langsettian (Smith, 1962, in Pendleton, 2012), coincident with the beginning of the SS biozone. The other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for this biozone, although they do not allow confirmation of the biozone assignment.
A specimen assigned tentatively to Ibrahimisporites is reported for the first time in the SS miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm. In addition, among the taxa identified, the following two species represent also first records in the SS miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Lycospora cf. brevijuga; and Lycospora cf. pellucida.

6.3.	Radiizonates aligerens (RA) Zone
Penedo Beach (PX8) and Aljezur-Bensafrim roadcut (PX16) are new studied localities, plotted in the RA miospore biozone (Fig. 2.2). One sample from each locality, PX8 and PX16 respectively, was prepared and needed very different oxidation times: PX8 was exposed to the fuming Schultze solution for one hour while PX16 needed four to seven hours of oxidation.
The palynological assemblage is dominated by Lycospora, followed by Densosporites, and Savitrisporites. The genus Calamospora, Cingulizonates, Leiotriletes and Lophotriletes are common occurrences. Most taxa in the following list are in open nomenclature due to their poor preservation (Tab. 6.2).

The RA miospore biozone index species was not found in the analysed samples. The presence of Acanthotriletes cf. microspinosus and Microreticulatisporites cf. nobilis is problematic since they appear in the beginning of NJ biozone (Laveine, 1965, and Corsin et al., 1967, in Pendleton, 2012; and Smith and Butterworth, 1967, respectively). if these specific assignments are correct, it may be interpreted in two ways: either the stratigraphic range of these species must be expanded or the assemblages containing these species do not belong to the RA miospore biozone but to NJ biozone. The poor preservation of these single specimens, classified in open nomenclature, and the great abundance of species assigned to the genera Acanthotriletes and Microreticulatisporites, make their biostratigraphic value uncertain. until better preserved material is obtained, no further conclusions should be made.
Another questionable taxon present is Densosporites cf. glandulosus, since this species is attributed to Westphalian C, which corresponds to biozones SL and lower OT (Kosanke, 1950; Peppers, 1993). This classification needs to be revised in the future.
The stratigraphic range top of Acanthotriletes cf. falcatus is by the end of III Biozone (Smith and Butterworth, 1967; Miospore Biostratigraphy of Smith and Butterworth, 1967), which is equivalent to the end of TK miospore biozone. The presence of this taxon is somehow problematic, but it can represent intrabasinal reworking.
The other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for this biozone, although they do not allow confirmation of the biozone assignment.
Four genera were reported for the first time in the RA miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Apiculatisporis, Punctatisporites and Stenozonotriletes; and a form tentatively assigned to Guthoerlisporites. In addition, among the taxa identified, the following eight species represent also first records in the RA miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Acanthotriletes cf. falcatus; Acanthotriletes cf. microspinosus; Densosporites cf. glandulosus; Dictyotriletes muricatus; Lycospora noctuina; Lycospora uber; Microreticulatisporites cf. nobilis; and Punctatisporites aerarius.

6.4.	Microreticulatisporites nobilis - Florinites junior (NJ) Zone
Vale da Bordeira roadcut is a new studied locality, plotted in the NJ miospore biozone (Fig. 2.2). One sample (PVB1) needed one hour of exposure to the Schultze solution to be prepared for miospore observation.
The palynological assemblage is dominated by Lycospora, with common occurrences of Densosporites, Raistrickia and Savitrisporites. Most of the identified taxa in the following list are in open nomenclature due to poor preservation:
Acanthotriletes sp.
Bellispores? sp.
Cingulizonates loricatus (Loose) Butterworth and Smith, 1964 Crassispora? sp.
Densosporites cf. annulatus (Loose, 1932) Schopf et al., 1944 Granulatisporites granulatus Ibrahim, 1933
Lycospora? sp.
Lycospora sp. Raistrickia sp.
Savitrisporites cf. nux (Butterworth and Williams, 1958) Sullivan, 1964 emend. Smith and Butterworth, 1967
Savitrisporites sp.
Waltzisporapolita (Hoffmeister et al., 1955) Smith and Butterworth, 1967 Waltzispora? sp.
The NJ miospore biozone index species were not found in the analysed sample. The species Waltzispora polita disappears in the end of Mississippian, middle of SO biozone, so it represents a reworked taxon, as Pereira (1997) pointed out. The other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for this biozone, although they do not allow confirmation of the biozone assignment.

Pedralva roadcut is a new studied locality, originally plotted in the area mapped as SL miospore biozone sensu Pereira (1997, 1999) (Fig. 2.2). One sample (PPD1) needed four hours of exposure to the Schultze solution to be prepared for miospore observation.
The palynological assemblage is dominated by Densosporites and Lycospora, followed by Savitrisporites and Cingulizonates. Most of the identified taxa in the following list are in open nomenclature due to poor preservation:
Acanthotriletes sp.
Acanthotriletes? sp. Apiculatisporis? sp.

Neither the index species of the NJ or SL miospore biozones were found in this studied sample. However, some taxa with restricted stratigraphic range do occur in this assemblage. Dictyotriletes castaneaeformis disappears in the end of the VIII miospore biozone (miospore zonation of Smith and Butterworth, 1967; likely equivalent to upper NJ) and Cristatisporites cf. solaris, which referred species known range is from IX to X biozone, likely equivalent to uppermost NJ through SL biozones. The co-occurrence of these two taxa suggests that this assemblage belongs to NJ miospore biozone, more specifically the upper part of NJ. Therefore, the initial assumption of this sample belonging to the SL biozone is ruled out.
Thus, the boundary between NJ and SL biozones, not delimited by Pereira (1999), may now be constrained, passing south of Pedralva locality and north of Quebradas Beach, as shown in Fig.6.7. This limit can be better constrained with further investigations in this area.
The other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for the NJ or SL biozones.

Between these two samples, PVB1 and PPD1, three genera were reported for the first time in the NJ miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Punctatisporites and Stenozonotriletes, and a specimen tentatively assigned to Apiculatisporis. In addition, among the taxa identified, the following species represents also a first record in the NJ miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Lycospora cf. uber.

6.5.	Thymospora obscura - Thymospora thiessenii (OT) Zone
The northern cliff of Cordoama Beach is possibly a new locality studied, plotted in the OT biozone (Fig 2.2). However, Oliveira et at, 2013 (p. 695, Fig. 5) plotted an unnamed, studied locality between Caneiros and Castelejo beaches that may correspond to Cordoama Beach. Two samples (PCC1-0 and PCC2-3) and needed four to seven hours of exposure to the Schultze solution to be prepared for miospore observation.
In both samples, the palynological assemblage is dominated by Lycospora, followed by Leiotriletes and Densosporites. Savitrisporites, Crassispora and forms related to pre-pollen are common. Most taxa in the following list of occurrences are in open nomenclature due to poor preservation:
Calamospora sp.

Savitrisporites sp. Savitrisporites? sp.
Schulzospora? sp. Verrucosisporites microverrucosus Ibrahim, 1933 Verrucosisporites sp.!!
The OT miospore biozone index species were not found in the studied samples. Lycospora noctuina, Punctatisporites minutus and Savitrisporites cingulatus disappear in the end of Westphalian D. Additionally, Savitrisporites majus appears in the beginning of Westphalian D. In the analysed samples, the coexistence of these taxa (some in open nomenclature) indicates a Westphalian D age, within the OT miospore biozone.
The stratigraphic range top of Densosporites annulatus is by the end of IX Biozone (Smith and Butterworth, 1967; Pendleton, 2012; Miospore Biostratigraphy of Smith and Butterworth, 1967), which is approximately equivalent to mid-SL miospore biozone. The last reported appearance of Schulzospora species is in the end of RA biozone (Smith and Butterworth, 1967). Verrucosisporites microverrucosus disappears at the end of X Biozone (Smith and Butterworth, 1967), which correlates
with the top of SL Biozone. The presence of these taxa is somehow problematic, but they can represent intrabasinal reworking.
other taxa identified, largely in open nomenclature, are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for the Westphalian D age and oT miospore biozone.
Five genera were reported for the first time in the oT miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Cyclogranisporites; Granulatisporites; Punctatisporites; Verrucosisporites; and a specimen tentatively assigned to the genus Schulzospora. in addition, among the taxa identified, the following nine species represent also first records in the OT miospore biozone of the Brejeira Fm.: Cyclogranisporites sp.; Granulatisporites sp.; Leiotriletes cf. sphaerotriangularis; Lycospora cf. noctuina; Punctatisporites minutus; Punctatisporites nitidus; Savitrisporites cf. cingulatus; Savitrisporites cf. majus; Verrucosisporites microverrucosus.

6.6.	Discussion
The different oxidation times do not correlate with distinct biozones in the Brejeira Fm. For example, samples from Penedo Beach (PX8) and Aljezur-Bensafrim roadcut (PX16) are both from the RA biozone: the first only needed one hour to be oxidized and PX16 needed seven hours. These very distinct oxidation times in the same geological formation are not common. This can be explained in two ways: small variations in the concentration of the fuming Schultze solution used in the oxidation procedure; or outcrops with a slightly different (over)maturation need very distinct oxidation times for a successful oxidation. In fact, samples from Brejeira Formation present slight differences in the dark brown tones but this feature is difficult to measure.
The poor preservation of the palynological assemblages could be the result of the active palaeosedimentary dynamics of a turbidite system and/or the complex interplay of PressureTemperature-time history and the tectonic/geodynamic evolution of the BAFG.
Jager and McLean (2008) report a reduction in miospore abundance, assemblage diversities and the number of coincident genera between the sections moving towards distal depositional settings. These authors also explain that the sorting during transportation and deposition increases significantly the proportion of rounded miospores and reduces the relative amount of triangular and rounded-triangular miospores. Considering their interpretation, the dominance of Lycospora and Densosporites, both rounded morphological genera, and the low to medium diversity palynological assemblages herein described are additional indicators of the distal depositional palaeoenvironment (relative to the source area of the sediments) reported for the Brejeira Fm.
Further detailed investigation is needed to better characterize the sporomorph content, not only in the new sections but also in those previously studied, which supports the miospore zonal scheme of the Brejeira Fm.
7.	Conclusions
In this master thesis, 33 samples from 13 localities were studied, distributed through the miospore biozones of the Brejeira Fm. The main conclusions are highlighted below:
Palynofacies analysis
The organic residues from the collected samples of the Brejeira Fm. are badly preserved, low diverse and overmatured, which difficulted the palynological analyses and limited the methods that could be applied.
When projected in the AOM-Phytoclasts-Palynomorphs ternary plot the samples are concentrated in the marine palynological field IX but extend into the VI, “Distal suboxic-anoxic basin” and “Proximal suboxic-anoxic shelf”, respectively. The dispersal of data is related to the abundance of phytoclasts and, therefore, the terrestrial input of the turbiditic currents in the distal marine depositional system. For the preservation of large amounts of AOM, the depositional environment was likely characterized by reducing, suboxic to anoxic conditions.
The palynofacies ratios and parameters indicate that the depositional environment of the Brejeira Fm. was distant from the sediment source area. This is generally consistent with the sedimentological data which shows a unit dominated by low density turbidites with typical thin greywacke beds and a significant proportion of mud. The relative abundance of phytoclasts (and to some extent of sporomorphs) reflects the importance of terrestrial influx, which is expected in a turbidite-dominated environment.
The samples collected along continuous sections show remarkably monotonous palynofacies, with very slight variations of ratios and parameters. No consistent peaks seem to be recorded in the analysed sections, and the only major environmental event identified, the Phytoplankton Blackout, is reported from the Carboniferous to Late Triassic (Riegel, 1996, 2001). Point samples from several biozones show very similar palynological content with little differentiation by age or geographic location.
A good, positive correlation of lath-shaped opaque phytoclast normalized ratio with TOC values suggests an increase in organic carbon content towards more distal settings.
The original hydrocarbon potential of the Brejeira Fm. was likely significant, essentially oil-prone as indicated the dominant presence of AoM. some of the samples probably show a mixed oilgas potential (type II oil-prone &gt; III gas-prone kerogen) considering the higher proportion of gas-prone particles (phytoclasts). The current hydrocarbon potential is however, limited. The dark brown and black colours and opacity of most particles indicate a high maturity, consistent with the results from Fernandes et al. (2012) and McCormack et al. (2007). The previously reported TOC values reported by Barberes (2013) are thus necessarily post-expulsion values. The remaining potential is, if existing, restricted to a very late dry gas window.
subsurface units should be as mature as the studied samples: the cuttings from the borehole, PF1.96m and PF1.150m samples, did not show observable differences from those on the surface (all the remaining samples). Maybe better results could be expected offshore, but currently there is no information available (seismic or offshore drill cores).
Palynostratigraphy
Nine samples were selected for palynostratigraphical studies, covering all the six biozones of the Brejeira Fm. from Pereira (1997, 1999). The miospore index species were not found in the
biozones which they name, although some of these species were found in other biozones - e.g. Raistrickia fulva due to its wider stratigraphic range.
The palynological assemblages are of low to medium diversity (always less than 30 taxa per sample), dominated by the genera Lycospora and Densosporites, with common occurrences of Savitrisporites, Crassispora, Lophotriletes, Leiotriletes, and Cingulizonates.
In the studied sample from Pedralva locality, the miospore assemblage corresponds to the upper part of the NJ biozone. The initial assumption of this sample belonging to the SL biozone was ruled out and the boundary between NJ and SL biozones, not delimited by Pereira (1999), is now constrained, passing south of Pedralva locality and north of Quebradas Beach, following a NW-SE direction.
The Cordoama Beach samples provided a sporomorph assemblage assignable to the Westphalian D age, within the OT miospore biozone, part of the Moscovian stage. In the other samples, the palynological assemblages are not in disagreement with the miospore occurrences described for the different biozones, although they do not allow confirmation of previous biozone assignments.
Four genera were identified for the first time in the Brejeira Fm.: Cyclogranisporites, and specimens tentatively assigned to Guthoerlisporites, Ibrahimisporites and Schulzospora. In addition, among the taxa identified, the following seventeen species represent also first records in the Brejeira Fm.: Acanthotriletes cf. microspinosus, Cyclogranisporites sp., Densosporites cf. glandulosus, Dictyotriletes muricatus, Leiotriletes cf. sphaerotriangularis, Lophotriletes cf. mosaicus, Lycospora cf. brevijuga, Lycospora noctuina, Lycospora cf. pellucida, Lycospora uber, Microreticulatisporites cf. nobilis, Punctatisporites aerarius, Punctatisporites minutus, Punctatisporites nitidus, Savitrisporites cf. cingulatus, Savitrisporites cf. majus, and Verrucosisporites microverrucosus. A significant number of these taxa was left in open nomenclature due to poor preservation.

Title	Palynofacies of the Pennsylvanian, turbidite-dominated Brejeira Formation metasediments, SW Portugal
Article type	Research paper
Abstract
The Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) is the westernmost unit of the South Portuguese Zone (SW Variscan Chain) and consists of siliciclastic gravity-flow deposits forming a turbidite-dominated succession. The Brejeira Formation (Bashkirian to upper Moscovian in age) is the youngest of the three litostratigraphic units of BAFG, composed of greywackes, quartzwackes and impure quartzites interbedded with shales. Dark grey shales from the Brejeira Fm. were studied to characterize its palaeoenvironment and source rock potential. Thirty-three samples were collected from several, dispersed and non-laterally correlatable localities of the Brejeira Fm., mostly from coastal cliffs, between Zambujeira do Mar and Cordoama beaches. The organic residues invariably consist of dark brown translucent to black opaque organic particles, dominated by amorphous organic matterand phytoclasts. The palynofacies analysis indicate a marine depositional palaeoenvironment with reducing, suboxic to anoxic sea floor conditions, which enhanced amorphous organic matter preservation. The abundance of phytoclasts supports the input of turbidity currents in the distal basin. Additionally, the phytoclast ratios and parameters indicate considerable distance from the sediment source area. The rare presence of marine organic-walled phytoplankton can be explained by the late Palaeozoic phytoplankton blackout. The moderately positive correlation of lath-shaped opaque phytoclast normalized ratio with TOC seems to suggest an increasing in organic carbon content towards more distal settings. The kerogen from Brejeira Fm. is presently thermally overmatured but it had the potential to generate hydrocarbons in the geological past since the particulate organic matter assemblage indicates type II oil-prone &gt; III gas-prone kerogen.
Keywords	South Portuguese Zone; Carboniferous; source rock; turbidity currents; optical kerogen analysis.

1.	Introduction
The Pennsylvanian Brejeira Fm. is the southernmost and youngest unit of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG), one of the geological domains of the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ), located in the southern branch of the Variscan Chain (Fig. 1). This Group has been studied in terms of stratigraphic evolution and biostratrigraphy by Oliveira et al. (1979), Oliveira (1983, 1990), Korn (1997), Pereira et al. (2007, 2008), Jorge et al. (2013) and Rodrigues et al. 2015.
The term palynofacies was introduced by Combaz (1964) and the concept has been successfully used for palaeoenvironmental interpretations and source rock assessment since then. Palynofacies is based on the quantified study of particulate organic matter obtained by maceration of sedimentary rocks (Tyson, 1993), as observed under transmitted light microscopy. The relative and absolute percentages of land- and marine-derived palynomorphs provide valuable information for the determination of sedimentary facies (Tyson, 1995; McCarthy et al., 2003). Similarly, the quantification of oil- and gas-prone organic particles allows a rapid and semi-quantitative assessment of source rocks (Tyson, 1995 and references therein). Detailed palynofacies analysis include not only the ratios organic particle types, such as amorphous organic matter, phytoclasts and palynomorphs, but also details on particle size, shapes and opacity of phytoclasts, among other parameters (Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Steffen and Gorin, 1993; Tyson, 1993, 1995). This type of analysis, especially when coupled with sedimentological data allows the characterization of palaeoenvironments and to depict distal-proximal trends (Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Beaudouin et al., 2004; Gotz et al., 2008; Jager and McLean, 2008; Baudin et al., 2010; Biscara et al., 2013; Carvalho et al., 2013; Stetten et al., 2015; McArthur et al., 2016a,b).

In the recent past, oil and gas companies showed interest for hydrocarbon prospection and research in the area where the Brejeira Fm. crops out. This unit is usually considered overmatured (McCormack et al., 2007; Fernandes et al., 2012). More recent works (Barberes, 2013; Barberes et al., 2014) present inferior values of vitrinite reflectance, suggesting that the Brejeira Fm. could have a lower maturation grade than previously reported, in the late gas window. These facts, aligned with the proximity of Meso-Cenozoic formations that can act as reservoir and seal, reopened the question: could Brejeira Fm. be or have been a source rock in a (unconventional) petroleum system? Trying to unravel this issue, Brejeira Fm. is revisited in a palynological perspective. Although the palynostratigraphy of the Brejeira Fm. is known with some detail (Pereira, 1997, 1999) palynofacies have not been used to study this unit. In fact, there are only few examples of palynofacies analysis in Paleozoic marine successions (see Ruckwied et al., 2014; Atta-Peters and Achaegakwo, 2017). The aim of this study is to characterize the palaeoenvironmental setting of the Brejeira Fm. and its potential as a hydrocarbon source rock, by using palynofacies analysis.
In the present work, we achieve a detailed characterization of the depositional palaeoenvironment of the Brejeira Fm., with new discussions about its potential as a hydrocarbon source rock. Previous data from organic geochemistry and thermal maturation (McCormack et al., 2007; Fernandes et al., 2012; Barberes, 2013; Barberes et al., 2014) is compared with our results.
2.	Geological setting
The SPZ is the southernmost zone of the Iberian Variscides, comprising Devonian and Carboniferous rocks (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983; and references therein). It is interpreted as an external thrust belt and foreland basin (Oliveira and Quesada, 1998).

The SPZ has been correlated with Avalonia (Quesada, 1998) based on similarities with the southern British Isles, the Brabant Massif, the Rhenish Massif and the Moravo-Silesian zone of the Bohemian Massif (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira and Quesada, 1998; Nance et al., 2010): all these zones contain Mississippian-Pennsylvanian flysch basins.
The northern boundary between the SPZ and the Precambrian-Palaeozoic rocks of the Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) is marked by the Beja-Acebuches Ophiolite Complex (Fonseca et al., 1999). To the south, the SPZ is unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 1). Within the SPZ the following four geological domains are defined (Oliveira, 1990), from NE to SW: the Pulo do Lobo Antiform, the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), the BAFG and the Southwest Portugal Domain (Aljezur and Bordeira Anticlines; SPD).
The BAFG consists mostly of turbidite-dominated gravity flow deposits, deposited as a result from the oblique collision between the SPZ and the OMZ (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983). This major compressive regime promoted the development of a highly subsidizing sedimentary basin, probably in a foreland context, where the over five km thick BAFG accumulated (Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 1990). The BAFG comprises three lithostratigraphic units, from base to top: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira formations (Fig. 2); all three formations become younger to the SW, in roughly parallel NW-SE bands, related to the southwestward progradation of the depositional system (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira 1983). The miospore biozones recognized by Pereira (1997, 1999) and Pereira et al. (2007, 2008) are consistent with the ammonoid data recovered from all the BAFG formations (Oliveira et al., 1979; Korn, 1997).
The upper Visean Mértola Fm. has a greywacke/shale ratio usually &gt; 1, presenting abundant and thick turbiditic beds (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al., 2007, 2008). Proximal facies of gravity flows predominate when approaching the contact with the IPB (Oliveira and Wagner-Gentis, 1983).

The upper Visean to lower Bashkirian Mira Fm. is mostly composed of thin-bedded turbidites and show a greywacke/shale ratio &amp;lt;1, evidencing a deposition far from the sediment source area (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al., 2007, 2008). The transition between Mira and Brejeira formations is represented by the gradation of thin-bedded turbidites into thicker centimetric to decimetric greywackes (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1983).
The Brejeira Fm. is divided in two sedimentary belts. The northern, basal part outcrops in a narrow 5 to 10 km wide belt, with thick-beds of matrix-poor greywackes interbedded with shales, in a ratio greywacke/shale &gt; 1 (Oliveira et al., 1979; Pereira et al., 2007, 2008). The southern, upper part is much thicker (30 to 40 km wide band), presenting thinner-bedded matrix-rich greywackes, characterized by a greywacke/shale ratio &amp;lt;1 (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira 1983). The palynostratigraphical studies of the Brejeira Fm. allowed the recognition of six miospore biozones of Western Europe (Clayton et al., 1977), from the FR Miospore Biozone of mid Bashkirian age to OT Miospore Biozone of upper Moscovian age (Fig. 1, 2).
Geochemical studies of the three BAFG formations reveal a sediment provenance mainly from the SW border of the OMZ, and with a contribution of an external (Avalonian) source, more markedly in the Brejeira Formation (Jorge et al., 2013). The detrital zircon geochronology performed by Rodrigues et al. (2015) indicate a provenance for Mértola and Mira formations from extrabasinal (OMZ) and intrabasinal (SPZ) source areas. The abundance of older zircons in the Brejeira Fm. suggests a provenance mainly from Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Pereira et al., 2013; Rodrigues et al. 2015). Rodrigues et al. (2015) proposed the existence of a physical, continuous barrier (active from mid-Visean times) between the main depositional areas of Mértola-Mira and Brejeira formations.

3.1.	Sampling
A total of 33 samples, exclusively from dark grey shales, were collected from 13 geographically dispersed, non-correlationable localities in the Brejeira Formation (Fig. 1; supplementary data 1). All the 33 samples were processed for palynological analysis.
Sedimentological description was performed in undeformed, relatively continuous stratigraphic sections of turbidite sequences in the coastal cliffs of two localities: Medo da Fonte Santa (Fig. 3 and 4, lithological column of 45 meters, and 5, palynofacies ratios) and Cordoama (north) beaches (Fig. 6, two lithological columns of six and nine meters, and palynofacies ratios). These were logged and sampled for palynology trying to maintain a regular distance between samples when possible (every five meters in Medo da Fonte Santa Beach and every three meters in Cordoama Beach,), excepting when sampling was not possible due to covered intervals or absence of stratigraphic continuity. Only a portion of all the samples (16 out of 33) were collected in the outcrops represented in the lithological columns.
To made viable the graphical representation, each greywacke-shale sedimentary cycle is initiated by the Bouma division represented in the greywacke unit, where the following Bouma divisions are also found, until the sequence finish with the Te/hemipelagic shale unit.
3.2.	Palynological processing
Organic matter was extracted from 33 samples using standard palynological methods (Batten, 1999): 30 grams of each sample reacted with HCl (10%, one day) and HF (40%, five days), followed by a hot HCl attack (10%, 20 minutes boiling); after the acid reactions, the organic residues were neutralized with distilled water until the solution presented a neutral pH. No oxidation or concentration methods were used. For each sample, two different types of slides were made to perform two types of analysis:

-	Total particulate organic matter content analysis as observed on slides produced from unsieved residues (Fig. 7A). The three main categories of kerogen were considered -amorphous organic matter (AOM), phytoclasts and palynomorphs - to apply in the AOM-Phytoclast-Palynomorph ternary diagram for palynofacies (Tyson, 1993); the same dataset have been analysed in PAST v.2.14 software (Hammer et al., 2001). Two multivariate methods that are typically used to analyse the distribution patterns of biotic assemblages were applied: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), which are very useful method for indirect ordination of ecological datasets (Hill and Gauch, 1980; Hammer and Harper, 2006).
-	Normalized ratios of selected particles and measure of the diameter of sufficient equant opaque phytoclasts after observation of slides produced from a 15pm-sieved organic residues (Fig. 7B). In the selected palynological classification (Fig. 7C-V): phytoclasts were divided in translucent and opaque phytoclasts; opaque phytoclasts were separated by their shape in lath and equant categories (Tyson, 1995; Tyson and Follows, 2000); “amorphous” particles that show angular outlines were interpreted and counted as degraded phytoclasts; palynomorphs differentiation was limited to a few categories - sporomorphs, leiospheres, algae, acritarchs and grey tissues/zooclasts -due to general poor quality and low diversity of the organic residues obtained. For detailed description of the distinct organic matter types read Tyson (1995) and Traverse (2007).
At least 300 organic particles were counted in each slide. Smaller and/or heavily degraded particles that could not be positively identified were not counted (always less than 10% of the total palynological association).
Optical examination was carried out using a transmitted light microscope Olympus BX40 with a 40x objective, coupled with an attached OptixCam Summit K2 camera. All these

3.3.	Organic matter normalized ratios and parameters
The following ratios and parameters, described by Tyson (1993), were chosen:
-	Opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio. The higher the value, the more rich in opaque phytoclasts the sample is. In marine sediments, the previous relation reflects a distal depositional environment (Tyson, 1993). The following formula was used: OPNR = Opaque phytoclasts / (Opaque + Translucent phytoclasts)
-	Lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio. A high value indicates abundance of lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts, which increases in more distal environments (Gorin and Steffen, 1991; Tyson, 1995). It can be obtained by:
LOPNR = Lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts / (Lath-shaped + Equant opaque phytoclasts)
-	Marine palynomorphs normalized ratio. This ratio generally increases offshore and it can be used as an indicator of sea-level changes (Steffen and Gorin, 1993). The applied formula was:
MPNR = Marine palynomorphs / (Marine + Continental palynomorphs)
-	Average diameter of equant opaque phytoclast particles. The diameter of equant opaque phytoclasts (square or round) was measured until the amount was sufficient to obtain a stable average value. Particle size decreases in an offshore direction, controlled by granulometric composition of the sediment, proximity to source and by the presence (or absence) of macroscopic debris that could break into smaller particles (Tyson, 1993).

These ratios and parameters of the palynofacies analysis are closely related with proximal-distal trends, one of the principal controls on particulate organic matter distribution in marine environments (Tyson and Follows, 2000). The results were plotted aside of the stratigraphic logs. Of the analysed samples, nine had TOC values obtained from previous works (Barberes, 2013), and their relation with the three main groups of organic matter (AOM, phytoclasts and palynomorphs) and palynological ratios was evaluated (see section
4.3).
4.	Results
4.1.	Total particulate organic matter analysis
All the organic residues were composed of dark brown translucent to black opaque organic particles, with the exception of the organic particles with thin-walls (Fig. 7, O-P). Using the Spores Colour Index (Collins, 1990), 8 to 10 are the values qualitatively attributed to the sporomorphs of the studied palynological assemblages. All samples are dominated by AOM (mostly marine), followed by phytoclasts (translucent ~ opaque phytoclasts; lath opaque &gt; equant opaque phytoclasts) and, in a minor proportion, palynomorphs (sporomorphs &gt; marine palynomorphs). Marine palynomorphs - leiospheres, algae and acritarchs - were present in most samples, but these are invariably rare.
When projected in the AOM-Phytoclast-Palynomorph ternary diagram for palynofacies (Tyson, 1993; Fig. 8), the samples are concentrated in the marine palynological field IX but extend into the VI, ranging between “Distal suboxic-anoxic basin” and “Proximal suboxic-anoxic shelf’. Together, these palynofacies fields indicate reducing, suboxic to anoxic seafloor conditions and type II - oil-prone organic matter (Tyson, 1993). Palynomorphs are statistically irrelevant. There is little differentiation between samples of different miospore biozones.

PCA (Fig. 9. A) and DCA (Fig. 9. B) show similar results to those obtained in the AOM-Phytoclast-Palynomorph ternary diagram for palynofacies (Fig. 8).
PCA. The first component (PC1) explain more than 98.5% of the variation, thus this component will be the more relevant for identifying patterns. The variables with more significance are the AOM and the Phytoclast content in each sample, whereas the content in Palynomorphs is not relevant at all in the analysis. Observing the loadings, samples with higher content in AOM will be plotted in the more negative part of the scatter plot (Fig. 9.A) and the contrary. In the same way, samples with higher content in Phytoclasts will be plotted in the more positive side of the scatter plot. No obvious clustering of samples of the same localities has been observed in the PCA.
In the DCA (Fig. 9. B), the samples are plotted and arranged in a similar way than in the PCA, which suggest a similar trend in the ordination of the samples as in the PCA scatter plot (Fig. 9. A).
4.2.	Palynofacies: Ratios and Parameters
Medo da Fonte Santa Beach section is included in the SS miospore biozone (Fig. 1, adapted from Pereira, 1999), north part of the Brejeira Fm. Cordoama Beach sections are included in the OT miospore biozone, the most recent and southern zone of the Brejeira Fm. (Pereira, 1999). Most of the beds, equivalent to Bouma divisions, in these sections are of centimetric scale, commonly inferior to 10 centimeters.
No macrofossils were found in the studied beds, during the fieldwork. Rare bioturbation structures were recognized. At the base of some Ta beds, common palaeocurrents were observed. Oliveira and Wagner-Gentis (1983), reports that Brejeira Fm. exhibits flow directions mainly to the SE and E, with some palaeocurrents measurements indication flow towards the SW and N.

For most of the samples, the palynological associations have similar proportion of translucent and opaque phytoclasts, lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts present dominance over equant opaque phytoclasts and continental palynomorphs are more abundant than marine palynomorphs (Figs. 5, 6).
In the Medo da Fonte Santa Beach section, the ratios “opaque phytoclasts” and “marine palynomorphs” show a symmetrical distribution while, in the Cordoama 1, reveal a parallel arrangement (Figs. 5, 6). The lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio and the average diameter of equant opaque phytoclasts, in Medo da Fonte Santa and Cordoama 1 sections, evidence unexpected opposite signals in the distal-proximal trends (Figs. 5, 6). The samples from Cordoama 2 display very little variations (Figs. 5, 6). The average diameters of equant opaque phytoclasts in all the studied samples present a minimum value of 27.5 pm, a maximum value of 42.8 pm and a mean of 34.9 pm.
4.3.	Palynofacies: relation of the organic matter with TOC
The comparison of organic matter types with TOC values shows a slightly negative correlation (r= -0.26) between the proportion of AOM with TOC, being these two variables only weakly correlated (r2 values extremely low = 0.069) and a slightly positive correlation (r= 0.22) of phytoclasts with TOC (r2 values extremely low = 0.049) (Fig. 10. A), albeit both with few samples out of the 95% regression confidence belts. Palynomorphs also seem to correlate slightly positively (r= 0.42) with TOC (r2 values = 0.18) (Fig. 10. A). Within the calculated ratios, the lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio is the one that has a defined the highest positive correlation with TOC (Fig. 9. B), but still with r2 values (r2= 0.63) far from 1.

5.1.	Depositional palaeoenvironment
As the AOM-Phytoclasts-Palynomorphs ternary diagram (Fig. 8) and the average small diameter of equant opaque phytoclasts (Tyson, 1993; Tyson and Follows, 2000) (Figs.
5,	6) indicates, the Brejeira Fm. should have been deposited in a distal basin. For the preservation of large amounts of AOM (see Figs. 8, 9), the depositional environment was likely characterized by reducing, suboxic to anoxic conditions. The relative abundance of phytoclasts (and to some extent of sporomorphs) reflects the importance of terrestrial influx which is expected in a turbidite-dominated environment.
Thus, within the ratios and parameters used in this study the lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts normalized ratio and average diameters of equant opaque phytoclasts are considered to be the more reliable, while the opaque/translucent ratio can be significantly biased due to observational difficulties.
5.2.	Controls on particle distribution
The dispersal of data points in the AOM-Phytoclast-Palynomorph ternary plot (Fig. 8) is related to the abundance of phytoclasts and, therefore, the terrestrial input to the depositional system. There is no clear differentiation between samples according to their miospore biozone.
If we compare these previous results with those obtained in the PCA (Fig. 9. A) and DCA (Fig. 9. B), we observe that the distribution of the data points is following a similar trend. No groupings of samples from the same locality have been observed in any of these multivariate methods. This indicates that the previous results obtained are robust and significant.
Besides the poor preservation and overmaturation of the organic residues, that difficult the observation and therefore the classification of the organic particles, other factors such as

reworking (highly promoted in depositional systems with gravity-flow currents; Pereira, 1997, identifies numerous miospore taxa reworked in the Brejeira Fm.) and variation in local vegetation could also be responsible for the little dissimilarities of the palynological assemblages.
5.3.	Thermal maturation and source rock potential
The dark brown and black colours in all organic particle types and opacity (except in very thin-walled particles) and the 8 to 10 SCI value (Collins, 1990) attributed to the colour of the sporomorphs, indicate an apparent high thermal maturity in all the studied samples.
The low correlation between variables (r2 values) obtained for the three main palynological groups (AOM, phytoclasts and palynomophs) with the TOC (Figs. 10. A, B), and the low number of samples included (n=9) in the analyses, do not allow making solid conclusions. More samples and consequent data points would probably be statistically more representative and thus, would help in corroborating these possible relations.
However, the moderately positive correlation of lath-shaped opaque phytoclast normalized ratio with TOC (r2= 0.63) seems to suggest an increasing in organic carbon content towards more distal settings. It should be mentioned that the range of TOC variability is low, corresponding to post- hydrocarbon expulsion values, limiting the significance of the correlation with palynofacies parameters. In addition, knowing the heavier hydrocarbons are generated and expelled first as temperature increases, the rocks richer in oil-prone particles (notably AOM) would be relatively depleted in TOC, compared with more gas-prone rocks (phytoclast-rich), which would retain hydrocarbons over wider ranges of temperatures (Cooles et al., 1985; Passey et al., 2010).

The organic residues from the collected samples of the Brejeira Fm. are badly preserved, low diverse and overmatured, which difficulted the palynological analyses and limited the methods that could be applied.
The Brejeira Fm. was deposited in a distal marine basin, with reducing, suboxic to anoxic seafloor conditions, receiving terrestrial input from gravity-flows of terrestrial origin, mostly turbidites.
The samples collected along continuous sections show remarkably monotonous palynofacies, with slight variations of ratios and parameters. No peaks or significant variations seem to be recorded in the analysed sections, and the only major environmental event identified, the phytoplankton blackout, is reported from the Carboniferous to Late Triassic (Riegel, 2008).
A possible correlation of lath-shaped opaque phytoclast normalized ratio with TOC suggests an increase in organic carbon content towards more distal settings.
The original hydrocarbon potential of the Brejeira Fm. was likely significant, essentially oil-prone as indicated by the dominant presence of AOM. Some of the samples probably show a mixed oil-gas potential (type II oil-prone &gt; III gas-prone kerogen) considering the higher proportion of gas-prone particles (phytoclasts). The current hydrocarbon potential is however, limited. The dark colours of most organic particles indicate a high thermal maturity, consistent with the results from Fernandes et al. (2012) and McCormack et al. (2007). The TOC values reported by Barberes (2013) are thus necessarily post-expulsion values. The remaining potential is, if existing, restricted to a very late dry gas window. Subsurface units should be as mature as the studied samples: the cuttings from the borehole, PF1.96m and PF1.150m samples, did not show observable differences from those on the surface (all the remaining samples). Maybe better results could be expected offshore, but currently there is no information available (seismic or offshore drill cores).

Figure 1. Simplified geological map of SW of the BAFG with sample locations and miospore zonation of the Brejeira Fm., modified from Pereira (1999) and Oliveira et al. (2013). For each biozone, a distinct symbol is used and each grey tone represents a specific sampled outcrop. Inset map illustrates zones of the Variscan belt in Portugal and NW of Spain.
Figure 2. Chronostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Carboniferous BAFG. (1) Western European Miospore Zonation (Clayton et al. 1977), (2) South Portugal miospore Zonation (Pereira, 1999), (3) Defined guide taxa used for the Carboniferous of the South Portuguese Zone (Pereira et al. 2007, 2008).
Figure 3. Lithological column of an undeformed section at Medo da Fonte Santa Beach. Each greywacke-shale sedimentary cycle is initiated by the Bouma division represented in the greywacke unit (see legend), where the following Bouma divisions are also found, finishing with the Te/shale unit.
Figure 4. Continuation of the lithological column at Medo da Fonte Santa Beach (see Fig. 2).
Figure 5. Stratigraphic distribution of palynofacies parameters and ratios in Medo da Fonte Santa Beach section. Legend: P. = relatively proximal; D. = relatively distal.
