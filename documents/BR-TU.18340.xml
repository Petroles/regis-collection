Resumo

Com o crescente aumento das intensidades de campo magne?tico e perfor-
mance dos gradientes em ressona?ncia magne?tica (RM), novas te?cnicas de
imagiologia me?dica te?m surgido que apresentam novos contrastes entre dif-
ferentes tecidos. No entanto, este tipo de imagens sa?o desenvolvidas e op-
timizadas para o ce?rebro adulto que se sabe ter tempos de relaxac?a?o difer-
entes daqueles presentes no ce?rebro de um rece?m-nascido. Esta diferenc?a e?
inerente ao alto teor em a?gua presente no ce?rebro de um rece?m-nascido. O
principal objectivo deste projecto e? enta?o proceder a? optimizac?a?o de te?cnicas
avanc?adas de RM como susceptibilidade magne?tica (SWI) e de quantificac?a?o
dos tempo de relaxac?a?o (DESPOT1 e DESPOT2) para o ce?rebro de rece?m-
nascidos.

O sinal de RM e? medido sob a forma de um nu?mero complexo caracteri-
zado por uma intensidade e uma fase. Normalmente em RM, o sinal de fase
e? ignorado e apenas a intensidade do sinal e? utilizada para proceder a? recon-
struc?a?o das imagens. No entanto, a fase do sinal complexo e? extremamente
rica em informac?a?o relativa a?s diferenc?as de susceptibilidade entre tecidos
diferentes, sendo por isso bastante u?til para realc?ar este tipo de contraste.
Uma das questo?es que dificulta a utilizac?a?o das imagens de fase e? o facto
de apenas poderem registar valores no intervalo de [??,?) o que resulta no
mapeamento de valores que caiam fora desse intervalo para o seu interior.
Uma vez que a informac?a?o de interesse nas imagens de fase corresponde a
estruturas de pequena dimensa?o, caracterizadas por freque?ncias elevadas no
espac?o de Fourier, SWI consiste na utilizac?a?o de imagens de fase sujeitas a
um filtro passa-alto simples (janela rectangular. Tal permite extra??r a in-
formac?a?o de interesse, que posteriormente e? utilizada para realc?ar contraste
de susceptibilidade em imagens de intensidade. Este mapeamento da in-
formac?a?o de susceptibilidade na imagem de intensidade e? realizado atrave?s
da multiplicac?a?o da mesma por uma ma?scara extra??da da imagem de fase
filtrada para as baixas freque?ncias. Isto tem um particular interesse para a
visualizac?a?o do sistema vascular venoso uma vez que diferenc?as de suscep-
tibilidade entre sangue venoso e os tecidos envolventes permitem identificar
estruturas venosas mesmo em vasos com dimenso?es inferiores a? resoluc?a?o de
aquisic?a?o. Isto e? possivel grac?as a?s propriedades paramagne?ticas da deox-

i



ihemoglobina presente no sangue venoso. Neste trabalho o protocolo nor-
malmente utilizado para SWI foi adpatado e implementado a? realidade dos
rece?m-nascidos. Ao mesmo tempo foi tambe?m desenvolvida uma interface
gra?fica de modo a facilitar o processamento e construc?a?o de imagens ponder-
adas em susceptibilidade. Este processamento foi desenvolvido integrando
a FSL-FMRIB Software Library 5.0 juntamente com MatLab2012a. A in-
terface gra?fica foi desenvolvida em ambiente de programac?a?o MatLab2012a
com o aux??lio da ferramenta guide. Uma pequena discussa?o sobre o efeito da
dimensa?o do voxel de aquisia?o tambe?m e? inclu??da neste trabalho. E? pra?tica
comum os voxeis das imagens de SWI serem adquiridos com um quociente
entre a resoluc?a?o do plano de visualizac?a?o e a espessura dos cortes (AR, do
ingle?s voxel aspect ratio) apresentar valores entre 2 e 4. No entanto, este
tipo de aquisia?o induz uma excelente visualizac?a?o apenas para um dos (nor-
malmente o plano transversal) e uma muito ma? visualizac?a?o nos restantes
planos. Com isto em mente, resolveu-se tambe?m neste projecto, propo?r a
utilizac?a?o de um voxel de aquisic?a?o isotro?pico em detrimento do que e? pra?tica
comum na literatura. Espera-se que este tipo de aquisic?a?o isotro?pica reduza
um pouco o contraste de susceptibilidade obtido, no entanto apo?s inspec?a?o
visual de algumas imagens obtidas em volunta?rios decidimos que o ganho em
informac?a?o nos dois restantes planos de visualizac?a?o ortogonais justificaria
essa pequena perda de contraste. Este facto na?o foi no entanto devidamente
avaliado e mais estudos seriam necessa?rios para uma correcta avaliac?a?o desta
caracter??tica.

Na segunda parte do projecto apresentado nesta tese, foi implementada
uma te?cnica de quantificac?a?o em RM conhecida por “Driven Equilibrium
Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 - DESPOT1 e DESPOT2 ”. Esta
te?cnica (neste trabalho referida como DESPOT) permite de forma bastante
ra?pida estimar T1 e T2. Mais uma vez, devido ao facto de o ce?rebro de rece?m-
nascidos ter um conteu?do superior em a?gua relativamente ao ce?rebro adulto,
uma adaptac?a?o deve ser feita de modo a garantir a qualidade das imagens
obtidas. Esta te?cnica consiste na utilizac?a?o de seque?ncias de RM conhecidas
como Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) e Spoiled Gradient Echo (SPGR)
para obter imagens mantendo todos os para?metros constantes, ao mesmo
tempo que se variam os Flip Angles (FA). Isto permite ajustar um modelo
matema?tico que melhor explique as medic?o?es realizadas de modo a estimar
os tempos de relaxac?a?o T1 e T2. Para garantir a precisa?o da estimac?a?o dos
para?metros T1 e T2, simulac?o?es de Monte Carlo foram criadas onde se verifi-
cou que, usando a ferramenta de MatLab2012a fminsearch, como algoritmo
de optimizac?a?o e? poss??vel obter uma precisa?o de estimac?a?o (quociente entre
varia?ncia de estimac?a?o e o quadrado do valor correcto) de aproximadamente
5% relativamente ao valor correcto. Uma avaliac?a?o da capacidade de estimar
T1 e T2 foi realizada com modelos matema?ticos de um e dois compartimen-
tos que procuram explicar o sinal de RM medido em DESPOT. O modelo

ii



de dois compartimentos foi publicado por Deoni et al. em 2008, onde foi
sugerido que e? poss??vel estimar as fracc?o?es relativas de cada um dos com-
partimentos em cada voxel medido. No entanto, os resultados obtidos para
o modelo de dois compartimentos na?o foram satisfato?rios. Foi decidido que
uma avaliac?a?o mais profunda e tentativa de resoluc?a?o deste problema sa??a
fora dos objectivos do projecto.

O Cra?mer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) (em portugue?s limite inferior de
Cra?mer-Rao), e? uma ferramenta estat??stica que permite estimar qual a
varia?ncia min??ma alcanc?a?vel aquando da estimac?a?o de para?metros com base
no ajuste de um modelo matema?tico a um conjunto de medic?o?es. De modo
a finalizar o trabalho apresentado nesta tese, propose?mo-nos a utilizar a
minimizac?a?o do CRLB para seleccionar o conjunto de FA que permite es-
timar T1 e T2 com melhor precisa?o. Em primeiro lugar mostramos que a
varia?ncia prevista pelo CRLB se encontra em concorda?ncia com a varia?ncia
obtida com as simulac?o?es de Monte Carlo. Isto permite confirmar a via-
bilidade da utilizac?a?o do CRLB para optimizar o protocolo de estimac?a?o
de T1 e T2. Para tal, foi desenvolvida uma func?a?o de custo utilizando o
CRLB para optimizar o conjunto de FA que minimiza e garante a melhor
precisa?o considerando de uma matriz de combinac?o?es de T1 e T2. A func?a?o
de custo consiste em minimizar o maior valor de precisa?o (definida como o
quociente entre a varia?ncia e o quadrado do valor correcto para o para?metro)
e? calculada numa grelha de combinac?o?es de para?metros T1 e T2, garantindo
assim, que a cada iterac?a?o do processo de optimizac?a?o o pior cena?rio era
minimizado. Os resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que e? poss??vel opti-
mizar o protocolo de DESPOT garantindo uma precisa?o minima num grelha
de combinc?o?es de diferentes T1 e T2. Foi tambe?m poss??vel concluir que se
pode reduzir significativamente o nu?mero de medic?o?es necessa?rias para a
estimac?a?o sem aumentar significativamente a precisa?o desta. Este facto e? de
extrema importa?ncia para obter imagens de RM em rece?m nascidos onde e?
necessa?rio reduzir o tanto quanto poss??vel os tempos de aquisic?a?o de modo
evitar artefactos de movimento.

Ambas as vertentes (SWI e DESPOT) deste projecto foram avaliadas
pela equipa te?cnica e esta?o aptas a serem incorporadas em ambiente cl??nico
permitindo o desenvolvimento de futuros projectos nestas a?reas.

Abstract

With recent increase of clinical MR field strength and gradient performance,
advanced imaging techniques have been proposed that allow new types of
contrast and tissue parameter quantification. However this advanced tech-
niques are typically optimized to the adult brain which is known to have
different relaxation times T1 and T2 relative to the neonatal brain because
of its higher water content. The main purpose of this work is to optimize
advanced imaging techniques such as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)
and driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT1
and DESPOT2) in order to be applied to the neonatal brain.

In this work, a neonatal SWI protocol was developed by adapting a
gold standard adult protocol presented in the literature. Also a graphical
user interface was developed in order to provide an easy tool to reconstruct
susceptibility weighted images. Single compartment and multi-compartment
DESPOT estimation precision was estimated from both a Monte Carlo (MC)
and Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) approaches. CRLB is a statistical
tool that allows us to estimate the minimum possible variance that can be
obtained when estimating parameters of a mathematical model given a set
of independent noisy measurements. Furthermore, the CRLB was used as a
tool to optimize the DESPOT protocol regarding both precision and acqui-
sition time.

In this work a neonatal SWI protocol is proposed. Also we show that the
CRLB can be used to optimize the DESPOT1 and DESPOT2 acquisition
scheme and that the number of measurements usually made can be reduced
without significantly compromising parameter estimation.

Acknowledgements

In this section of the thesis I want to thank everyone whom I feel to be
important and that in some way or another helped me out during the real-
ization of this project.

In first place I must thank my family who always supported me and en-
couraged me to take risks and go abroad in order to grow as human being,
without their support I would have never been able to enrol in this project.

I must also thank my supervisors Jo and Rita who where amazing dur-
ing my stay at the CDB, they have both always shown great interest and
support during this project and I would have never been able to grow as
much as I did as a scientist without them. Shaihan was not officially my
supervisor, however he was essential in the support I received at the CDB,
and therefore I’m really glad that I had the opportunity to work with him
and learn from him. I am definitely grateful to both Jo and Shaihan for
educating me into the scientific way of thinking.

All this however could never had been done without the support of my
co-workers from rooms 6, specially Fran, Georgia and KB. Fran was defi-
nitely amazing during the entire project and has always given great advice
in times of need. The coffe-breaks/discussions mid-afternoon sessions with
Fran and Tomoki were really important for the good environment I felt in
the office.

I must also be grateful to Serena, Joanna and Tomoki for always being
extremely helpful when real-life data was needed. They were fundamental
in the good environment I felt at the CDB.

The cake club really helped to sweeten my weeks, while the great mo-
ments shared with Arian, Giulio, Markus, Sally, Yolanda and Kirsten made
me enjoy much more my stay in London.

Chapter 1

Overview

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays widely used as a medical
imaging approach by making use of interactions between some magnetic nu-
clei and applied external magnetic fields to produce images of the human
body. As will be explained in section 2.1 each MR image voxel is recorded
in the form of a complex number where magnitude and phase information
reflect the interaction between specific nuclei and the applied magnetic fields.

On conventional MR techniques, often used in a clinical setting, phase
information is discarded and only the magnitude image, composed of a mix-
ture of contrasts caused by different tissue properties, is used to probe the
desired information[1]. Advanced imaging techniques allow us to further
improve the quality of information obtained from MR imaging, and to eval-
uate a larger range of tissue parameters. The ability to probe tissue specific
properties such as magnetic susceptibility, and relaxation times T1 and T2,
has been proven to be useful in detecting and understanding diseases [2, 3, 4].

Being able to quantify tissue properties is of special importance in the
neonatal brain, because it opens a window of opportunity to study in vivo
how the human brain matures with age. The main goal of this project is
therefore to be able to adapt advanced imaging techniques such as Sus-
ceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse
Observation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT), initially developed for adult imag-
ing, to visualise the newborn brain and how it matures with age.

In chapter 2 a brief explanation of the background necessary to intro-
duce the work presented within this thesis is shown.

Chapter 3 will focus on the development of a SWI neonatal proto-
col. This involved proposing a dedicated neonatal protocol, including a
re-evalution of the effect of varying slice thickness, developing a graphical

user interface to allow users to produce filtered images that emphasise sus-
ceptibility effects from raw SWI data.

Within chapter 4 it is discussed how to correctly process a set of multi-
angle SPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimateT1andT2for both a one
compartment and two compartment model.

Chapter 5 focused in the use of the CRLB as an optimization tool for
DESPOT.

Chapter 2

Background Material

Within this chapter, the basic principles of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) necessary to understand the work presented in this thesis are pre-
sented.

As stated in [5] the idea of using spatial varying magnetic fields in order
to obtain information about a given object was first proposed and demon-
strated by Lauterbur and Mansfield in 1973. This moment in history may
be considered as the birth of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which
quickly evolved into the technique which is is nowadays used in Hospital
environment.

2.1 Basic Principles of MRI

The fundamental principals of MRI are based on the interaction between
atomic nuclei and external magnetic fields. When subjected to a static
magnetic field, some atomic nuclei present energy states with different en-
ergy levels, whose energy difference is proportional to the applied magnetic
field [6]. This effect is known as the Zeeman effect [6], and is direct conse-
quence of the atomic nuclei intrinsic angular momentum also known as Spin.

2.1.1 Larmor Frequency

Considering the case of a single proton, since it is a charged particle, its
spin property can be related to a circulating electric current, and, therefore
an associated magnetic moment [5]. The relationship between the magnetic
momentum and the spin angular momentum is defined as shown in Equation
2.1.

3



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

~µ = ? ~J (2.1)

In Equation 2.1 the proportionality constant ? between the magnetic
moment ~µ and the spin angular moment ~J is called the gyromagnetic ratio
and its value depends on the atomic nuclei under consideration[5]. The hu-
man body has a very high content of water and therefore the gyromagnetic
ratio for the hydrogen nucleus which has a value ? = 42.58 MHz/T is a very
important parameter in MRI. By combining Equation 2.1 with the expres-
sion for torque on a magnetic moment due to an external magnetic field ~B0,
oriented along the z axis, we obtain the relationship shown in Equation 2.2
which describes the rotation and precession movements of atomic nuclei.

Which can also be represented as,

which has the solution,

~µ =

(
µx0 cos ?t + µy0 sin ?t
µy0 cos ?t?µx0 sin ?t

)
(2.7)

where,

? = ?B0 (2.8)

The quantity ? in equation 2.8 is known as the Larmor frequency and
represents the resonance frequency at which the magnetic nuclei precess
around the main magnetic field.[6] This frequency is also the basic prin-
ciple behind all MR imaging methods as it allows us to discriminate the
sample in frequency steps by applying a gradient field B0 + r.G.[5, 6] For
example if we were to select a single slice, located at position z0, from a
sample then, by adding a gradient Gz to the main field, it is possible to
discriminate different Larmor frequencies along the z direction of the sam-
ple. Frequency discrimination is possible because only excitation pulses with

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

frequencies very similar to the Larmor frequency significantly interact with
the precessing atomic nuclei.[6]

2.1.2 Free Induction Decay

When in the presence of a static magnetic field, due to the generated torque
protons tend to align themselves with its direction, depending on their in-
trinsic spin, either along the parallel direction (low energy state) or the
anti-parallel direction (high-energy state) (Figure 2.1). Through the inter-

external magnetic field. Adapted from [7]

action with applied excitation pulses (also known as RF pulses) it is possible
to disturb this equilibrium state and flip the magnetic moments. The most
common flip pulses are the ?/2 pulse and the ? pulse that are responsible for
flipping the magnetization vector by respectively 90o and 180o. Nevertheless
it is possible to flip the magnetization moment by any angle by changing
the RF pulse accordingly.[5]

When applying an ?/2 pulse the magnetization vector which was oriented
along the B0 field flips towards the transverse plane xy as shown in Figure
2.2. This new state is an excited state because the proton accumulated

frame.The magnetization vector M is initially aligned with B0. An RF excitation

energy from the RF-pulse. However the protons tend to release its energy

as a RF-pulse while decaying towards its resting state giving origin to the
free induction decay (FID) signal as shown in Figure 2.3. This signal is
modelled by the Bloch equations as explained in [5] and in [6]. This set of
equations may be written as[6]:

sumed to lie along the z axis. The application of a ?/2 pulse to the system
along the transverse plane results in:

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

which explains the longitudinal relaxation rate caused by “spin-lattice” in-
teractions that induce the decay of the magnetization vector back to its
resting state oriented along the B0 field.[6] “Spin-spin” interactions result
in another relaxation effect that must be taken into account in order to
obtain a more realistic assessment of the MR signal. After the ?/2 pulse
applied at each time interval TR, spins interact with each other causing local
magnetic field variations and consequently, due to precessment movement
differences, local Larmor frequencies changes arise.[5] This attenuation is
modeled by e?TE/T2 , where TE is the instant at which the data is sampled,
allowing us to obtain the following expression to describe the transverse
magnetization evolution,

Mx,y(TE) = M0(1 ?e?TR/T1 )e?TE/T2 (2.17)

The T2 effect does not account for field inhomogeneities which produce ad-
ditional signal suppression. With this in mind it is of special importance to
define a more global relaxation rate: the T?2 capable of taking into account
external field induced effects (T ?2) and “spin-spin” interactions (T2).[5]

As will be further explained in section 2.2.2, magnetic susceptibility di-
rectly relates to local magnetic field inhomogeneities. Taking these signal
effects into account is of special importance since different local field in-
homogeneities produce different levels of signal attenuation and dephasing,
and therefore different levels of susceptibility contrast.

2.1.3 Frequency Encoding

As stated in section 2.1.1 the addition of a linear varying field to the main
magnetic field allows us to create a linear space dependent Larmor frequency
distribution as shown in Equation 2.19.

?G(z,t) = ?zG(t) (2.19)

The use of a gradient to establish a relation as shown in 2.19, where the
position of spins along a known direction results in a specific precessional
distribution is referred to as frequency encoding along that direction[5].

For the one dimensional case (1D) Equation 2.19 allows us to measure
the signal as being:

s(k) =

?
?(z)e?i2?kzdz (2.20)

here, the time dependence is implicitly defined in the spatial frequency k :
k(t) = ?

? t
0
dt?G(t?).[5] Equation 2.20 is one of the main building blocks of

7



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

MR imaging reconstruction when linear gradients are applied. The measured
signal s(k) is the Fourier transform of the spin density of the sample and as
a consequence the spin density can be determined by applying the inverse
Fourier transform of the signal s(k). [5]

?(z) =

?
s(k)(e)+i2?kzdk (2.21)

2.1.4 Gradient Echo

Gradient echo sequences are of special interest in the measurement of T?2 ef-
fects since they are extremely sensitive to this relaxation rate. As stated in
section 2.1.2, T?2 is strongly correlated with field inhomogeneities and there-
fore, by using acquisition sequences sensitive to this parameter it is possi-
ble to map local field variations. Haemoglobin (Hb) is an oxygen carrying
molecule present in red blood cells, whose magnetic properties depend on the
presence or absence of oxygen. Oxyhaemoglobin (oHb) is diamagnetic and
Deoxyhaemoglobin (dHb) is paramagnetic, therefore local magnetic proper-
ties are modified by the oxygenation state allowing Susceptibility Weighted
(SW) imaging to make use of gradient echo sequences to map local magni-
tude and phase changes that naturally occur in the human brain.[6] Thanks
to dHb presence in venous blood vessels and bleeds, SW imaging is able to
produce reliable venographic images of the human brain as well as detecting
micro-bleeds inside it.

In a simple gradient echo sequence (Figure 2.4), an excitation pulse is
applied (also known as RF-pulse), followed by a gradient field which is su-
perimposed with B0. The RF-pulse causes the magnetization to flip towards
the xy plane. Nuclei found in more intense fields start precessing at larger
frequencies compared to the ones found in weaker fields resulting in spin
dephasing. The applied gradient is then reversed at a later time allowing
the “fast ” nuclei to be placed in a weaker field and vice-versa inducing as a
result a gradual rephasing of spins. [6] Nevertheless the rephasing gradient
only compensates the dephasing that is consequence of the first gradient
lobe. Dephasing caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities or spin-spin in-
teractions still cause a gradual signal intensity loss governed by[7],

SGE = S(?,T1,S0)e
?TE
T?
2 (2.22)

where TE represents the echo time, S(?,T1,S0) is the signal immediately
after the application of the RF-pulse which tips the magnetization vector
? degrees towards the xy plane. This equation reflects why susceptibility
effects are so well enhanced by gradient echo sequences since they strongly
affect T?2 .

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

Figure 2.4: Example of a simple gradient-echo sequence. In b spins are initially
positioned along the y axis and are rapidly dephased by the negative lobe as
shown in c. When the positive gradient is switched on (d), the spins begin to
rephase, forming an echo (e). If the positive gradient is left on as show in f

dephasing will occur again. Adapted from [7]

This signal attenuation effect is characteristic of magnitude images, how-
ever, in SWI we are interested in the full complex description of the MR
signal. With this in mind it is important to define the full signal-intensity
response to a gradient echo sequence. For a right handed system as described
in [5] we have:

SGE(?) = ?m(?)e
?i??BTE (2.23)

where ? is the flip angle induced by the RF-pulse and ?B represents the
local field deviation caused by the susceptibility differences.

2.1.5 SPGR - Spoiled Gradient Echo

For a gradient echo sequence with TR &gt;&gt; T2, all transverse magnetization
is zero before the next RF-pulse is applied, this is known as a spoiled gra-
dient sequence. However this results in long acquisition times which is not
practical if we want to do a certain amount of measurements with different
FA. We are interested in a regime where TR &amp;lt;T2 (fast sequence), however

9



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

this implies that there is still some transverse magnetization prior to each
RF pulse. In this situation spoiling may be obtained by applying a spoiler
gradient that forces the transverse magnetization to be zero.[5]

It is important to guarantee that spoiling occurs before each RF pulse
because it allows the magnetization vector to evolve towards a steady-state
solution that is well known throughout the literature [5, 9, 10, 11, 12] and
shown in the following equation:

SGE ? SPGR = ?0
1 ?E1

1 ?E1 cos(?)
sin(?) (2.24)

where, ? is the voxel proton spin density, ? is the applied flip angle and E1
is e?TR/T1 .

Equation 2.24 is actually known as the Ernst formula [12] and can
only be applied as long as the correct spoiling before each RF pulse is
guaranteed. If no spoiling is applied a transverse magnetization interfer-
ence appears altering the expected signal behaviour either constructively or
destructively[5, 12].

2.1.6 SSFP - Steady State Free Precession

The steady state free precession (SSFP) is a very fast gradient echo sequence,
that makes use of both longitudinal and transverse magnetization to pro-
duce a dynamic equilibrium state for a fixed TR&amp;lt;&amp;lt;T2 &amp;lt;T1 [10, 12, 13].

Because both longitudinal and transverse magnetization need to be taken
into account on this type of MR sequence a more complex mathematical
description of this signal is necessary. Assuming an initial magnetization
M0, relaxation variables E1 = e

?TR/T1 and E2 = e
?TR/T2 it is possible

to write out the individual components of the magnetization vector in its
steady-state [5]:

MSSx = M0(1 ?E1)
E2 sin ? sin(?)

d
(2.25)

MSSy = M0(1 ?E1)
E2 sin ?(cos(?) ?E2)

d
(2.26)

MSSz = M0(1 ?E1)
[1 ?E2 cos(?)) ?E2 cos(?)(cos(?) ?E2)]

d
(2.27)

where,

d = (1 ?E1 cos(?))(1 ?E2 cos(?)) ?E2(E1 ? cos(?))(E2 ? cos(?)) (2.28)

Here, ? = ??t = ??Bt is defined as the resonance offset frequency.
This parameter is strongly dependent on the static field and since it changes

10



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

T1 = 1086ms, T2 = 69ms and TR = 3.567ms are fixed.

with position along the object the resulting SSFP signal is also position de-
pendent. Figure 2.5 illustrates the SSFP signal behaviour for fixed T1 and T2
parameters over different flip angles as a function of offset frequency. With
this in mind it is easy to anticipate that as the static field changes around an
object significantly the measured signal will also change accordingly. This
however, can be avoided by performing a good shimming inside the object
guaranteeing as low field variation as possible.[5]

2.2 SWI - Susceptibility Weighted Imaging

One of the goals of this thesis is to adapt SWI, initially developed for the
adult brain, to the neonatal brain. In order to accomplish this objective a
good understanding of how this kind of images are obtained is required, and
therefore a introductory discussion of the concepts needed to understand
this type of MR imaging is presented within this section.

2.2.1 Comprehending SWI

Interpreting SW images for clinical diagnostic purposes, requires special
care so that correct information is obtained. There are 3 major compo-
nents that must be taken into account[1], the first component is the magni-
tude data. Gradient echo magnitude images clearly reflect areas with either
short T?2 or an oscillatory signal intensity caused by the presence of de-
oxyhaemoglobin(dHb) in the major veins, with the latter being the main
responsible factor for the signal loss visible in these images. For a sub-
voxel sized vein, this signal loss results in hypointense voxel relative to its

11



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

surroundings, while on the other hand, a voxel containing only intravenous
signal will not show this cancellation effect, and therefore the vein appears
bright inside with a hypointense ring around it.[1]

The second relevant component is the phase image. Depending on the
scanner manufacturer’s adopted convention,[14] veins will have negative
phase values (because of the paramagnetic property of dHb) while calcium
deposits will have positive phase values (because calcium is diamagnetic)[1],
or vice-versa.

The third component is the processing required to obtain the final SW
image. By combining T?2 decay suppression effects presented on the magni-
tude information and venous blood susceptibility differences relative to its
surroundings recorded in the phase image, one single set of SW images is
produced that enhances small veins present in the human brain. The venous
vessels usually appear as black dots across each imaged slice representing
cross-sections of them. The mIP is therefore performed in order to check
the connectivity of these dots along different slices, and allowing clinicians
to distinguish between blood vessels and micro-bleeds.[1]

Within the following sections a more complete description of what mag-
netic susceptibility is as well as of each component will be presented, so that
a correct understanding of the work presented in Chapter 3 is accomplished.

2.2.2 Magnetic Susceptibility

Susceptibility information complements that available with conventional
spin density, T1-, and T2-weighted imaging.[1] In order to understand how
SWI may provide different clinical information it’s important to understand
what susceptibility is and how it can help us map different tissues when in
the presence of deoxygenated blood, iron or calcium.

Magnetic susceptibility is related to the conformational response of a
substance when placed inside an external magnetic field. When inside an
uniform magnetic field the bulk magnetization ~MB induced on a substance
is given by,

~MB = ?~H (2.29)

recalling that the magnetic field induced ( ~B) on a substance exposed to a
magnetic field strength ~H is ~B = µ0( ~H + ~MB) we obtain,

~B = µ0( ~H + ~MB) = µ0(1 + ?) ~H = µ0µr ~H = µ~H (2.30)

where µ, µo and µr are respectively the magnetic permeability of the sub-
stance, the magnetic permeability in vacuum and the relative magnetic per-

12



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

meability. From Equation 2.30 we may obtain,

~MB = ?~B/µ0(1 + ?) (2.31)

which for linear materials where ? ? 1, leads to

~MB = ?~B/µ0 (2.32)

from which we may conclude that the induced magnetization is directly
proportional to the main magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility[1]
suggesting that depending on the tissue composition we may obtain different
local fields, therefore opening a window for susceptibility mapping since the
Larmor frequency is directly dependent on the local field.

2.2.2.1 Geometry Effects

Magnetic susceptibility distorts the uniform field outside an object as a
function of its geometry. Following the description presented in [1] and [15],
the local field variation inside a cylinder placed at an angle ? relative to the
main field B0 is given by[1], [5],

?Bin = ??B0(3 cos
2 ? ? 1)/6 + ?eB0/3 (2.33)

where ?? = ?i ? ?e and ?e and ?i are the susceptibilities outside and
inside the cylinder. Usually when looking at local field changes, the term
?eB0/3 is constant both inside and outside the cylinder and therefore may
be dropped when considering field variations between different tissues. ??
may be estimated for the case of deoxygenated blood as,

?? = 4?A(0.18ppm)Hct(1 ?Y ) (2.34)

where A is a constant determined by the susceptibility of blood in vivo, Hct
is the hematocrit, and Y is the oxygen saturation.[1, 16, 17]

For the field variation outside the considered vessel, by taking a as the
vessel radius, which is considered as a long cylinder positioned at an angle ?
relative to the main field, r is the distance perpendicularly from the axis of
the cylinder to the considered position and ? is the angle between the vector
r and the projection of the main field direction onto a plane perpendicular
to the axis of the vessel[1, 5], we obtain the following relationship resulting
in the field distribution shown in Figure 2.6:

?Bout = ??B0 sin
2 ? cos(2?)a2/(2r2) (2.35)

The key point of presenting this field variation with geometry is to relate
this information to the signal phase of equation 2.23 and verify that:

?? = ???BTE (2.36)

13



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

perpendicular to B0. Adapted from [18].

and therefore, the phase variation is dependent on the vessel geometry.[1,
18, 19, 20]

When susceptibility-induced local field variations are present within an
imaging voxel, there is a resulting distribution of Larmor frequencies for
the protons within that voxel, resulting in signal loss which is the source of
Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast.[21] In 1997, Reichenbach
et al.[22], showed that with the right pulse sequence, it is possible to depict
blood vessels with diameters of less than a millimeter by making use of the
BOLD effect. The next section shows how this signal variation in the phase
image can be used to identify signal variations produced by dHb in order to
enhance visualization of small veins in the human brain.

2.2.2.2 Phase Filtering for Highlighting Susceptibility Variations

Background field inhomogeneities tend to cause low spatial frequency phase
variations[19]. Also, because one is only capable of mapping phase varia-
tions within the [??,?) interval phase wrappings occur, making it harder
to identify useful phase information. Fortunately we are only interested
in highlighting local susceptibility variations which correspond to high fre-

14



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

quency information in the phase image. With this in mind, as described in
[19] it is possible to remove phase wrapping and inhomogeneity effects by
complex dividing the original image with the image obtained by low-pass-
filtering (LP-filter) k-space data, and therefore, obtaining a high-pass-filter
(HP-filter) effect on the image.

Taking a more mathematical approach, if we consider the original com-
plex signal ?0(x),

?0(x) = |?0(x)|ei?f (x)+i?v(x) = F?1[S(k)] (2.37)

as being the complex image information, where F is the Fourier transform
operator, ?f (x) is the phase component which we assume to correspond to
background variations, ?v(x) contains local susceptibility variations of in-
terest such as venous blood information, and S(k) is the original k-space
information. For simplicity only these two components are considered but
other sources of magnetic field variations also contribute to both ?f (x) and
?v(x)

As stated above we assume that background field inhomogeneities only
generate low frequency variations and therefore, by truncating the original
data and zero padding the resulting k-space to have the same size as the
original k-space information, we obtain a low-pass filter effect (n point H(k)
filter). The obtained low-pass filtered image is then:

?lp(x) = |?lp(x)|ei?f (x) = F?1[S(k)H(k)] (2.38)

We may then use this information to complex divide the original image so
that,

?hp(x) =
|?0(x)|ei?f (x)+i?v(x)

|?lp(x)|ei?f (x)
? |?hp(x)|ei?v(x) (2.39)

The phase ?v(x) is now approximately free of low-frequency variations. An
example of this process is demonstrated in Figure 2.7. As seen in Figure 2.7
(b) vessel information is highlighted suggesting that this approach may allow
vessel topography with deoxygenated blood as a natural occurring contrast
agent.

2.2.3 Creation of SWI

SWI aims to create a different type of MRI contrast that complements the
information from conventional T1 and T2 sequences. This is done by making
use of both magnitude and phase information of a transversal 3D spoiled
gradient echo MR signal with low white matter to gray matter contrast,
allowing susceptibility effects to be mapped in the magnitude image after

some post-processing.

In 2000, Y. Wang et al.[19], suggested using HP-filtered phase images in
order to produce phase masks that could be applied to the commonly used
magnitude image in order to enhance susceptibility effects and therefore
depict small blood vessels. This so called phase-masks[1, 19, 14, 23] are the
key-point of SWI’s ability to produce venographic images. Once they are
applied to the magnitude image they enhance small vessel contrast relative
to the background and therefore increase the ability to depict them.

2.2.3.1 Phase Mask

Figure 2.8: Brain mask extracted from HP-filtered image show in Figure 2.7 b).
All positive phase values were linearly scaled to the [0, 1] interval as described in

this section. The black arrows indicate areas where vessels are present and
therefore they were linearly scaled to values close to 0 in the phase mask.

There are several different phase masks that may be extracted from the
phase image depending on what phase information is considered relevant to

16



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

enhance venographic contrast. According to [19], and because of the local
field behaviour discussed in section 2.2.2.1, the venous blood phase should
be either negative or positive depending on the vein orientation relative to
the main magnetic field.

More precisely three orientation intervals should be considered, corre-
sponding to angles smaller than 55? (positive phase), values close to 55?

(null phase) and values larger than 55? (negative phase).[19] However, this
predicted behaviour is not respected thanks to partial volume effects that
must be taken into account.[18] Y. Xu et al.[18], studied how different voxel
sizes and positions relative to a long cylinder positioned perpendicularly to
the main magnetic field change the measured phase, introducing the concept
of voxel aspect ratio. Also, it is important to note, that the convention used
to define positive phase is not the same for all vendors and therefore special
care must be taken in order to accommodate this issue[14].

(a) (b)

(c) (d)

Figure 2.9: Comparison between different phase masks proposed by different
authors in literature. a) negative phase mask, b) positive phase mask, c)

asymmetric negative phase mask, d) asymmetric positive phase mask

Once the correct phase of interest is chosen the phase mask (Figure 2.8)
is generated by performing a linear scaling that sets to 1 the pixels with
phase values that we want to keep unchanged and sets to 0 pixels with
phase values that we want to suppress (Figure 2.9). By selecting an appro-
priate voxel aspect ratio it is possible to obtain phase values that lie in the

17



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

[??, 0) or in the (0,?] interval[18]. Therefore, as an example, if the phase of
interest lies within the (0,?] interval, the phase mask is defined by setting
all values on the [??, 0) interval to unity, and setting the (0,?] interval as
?scaled = ??measured/? + 1. An example of this so called positive filter, or
positive phase mask applied to an adult human brain is shown in Figure 2.8.
This approach leads to a maximum signal cancellation for veins in parallel
orientation relative to the main magnetic field, and also gives good results
for vessels perpendicular to B0[20]. More examples of proposed phase masks
found in the literature are presented in Figure 2.9.

2.2.3.2 Minimum Intensity Projection - mIP

After selecting the appropriate phase mask, the SWI processing assembly
line ends with a minimum intensity projection (mIP) of a selected range
of contiguous slices of the image that results from the multiplication of the
original magnitude image by the extracted phase mask[20]. Since the phase
mask was designed to suppress high susceptibility pixels while maintaining
the rest intact, this multiplication enhances venographic contrast, by im-
posing a susceptibility weighting on the magnitude image. A mIP is then
performed in order to project a topographic effect that helps keep track of
the vessels through different imaged slices therefore giving a 3D angiography
effect. An example of the mIP projection can be seen in Figure 2.10.

Figure 2.10: Minimum Intensity Projection of the multiplication of Figure 2.8
by its respective magnitude image. It is possible to track some venous paths

suggesting SWI is a good tool for venographic mapping.

2.2.3.3 Voxel Aspect Ratio

One important aspect of SWI that was not yet discussed within this thesis
is the role of the acquisition voxel size and position relative the imaged ves-
sels. Because of the variety of vessel sizes presented inside the human brain,
studies which aim to optimize acquisition voxel size in order to obtain good

18



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

global vessel visualization, have been previously presented [18, 24]. Defining
voxel aspect ratio (AR) as being the ratio between voxel thickness and voxel
in-plane resolution, the work published by Yingbiao Xu in 2005 [18], sug-
gests that a theoretical AR of 2 should be used for best vessel visualization,
however they found that in practice an AR of 4 gives better visualization.
Therefore it is common practice to acquire SWI with an AR of either 2 or
4.

2.2.4 SWI - Neonate Approach

The neonatal brain has a higher water content (92 ? 95%) than the adult
brain (82?85%), and as a consequence of that T1 and T2 values are larger.[25]
This means that when scanning neonates optimal TE and TR must be chosen
to compensate for this higher water content. For an adult SW brain scan
at 3T field strength, the typical MR parameters are TR = 30ms and TE =
20ms as presented in [1], on the other hand, typical neonatal SW imaging
acquisition parameters as presented by [26] are TR = 52ms and TE = 30ms.

2.3 DESPOT - Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse
Observation of T1 and T2

Driven equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 (DESPOT) origi-
nally called variable nutation angle method was first introduced as a way to
estimate T1 by applying a set of spoiled gradient echo sequences (SPGR) over
different flip angles [9]. The DESPOT nomenclature was first introduced by
John Homer and Martin S. Beevers in 1985 [9] and further expanded to
DESPOT1 and DESPOT2 by Deoni et al. in 2003 [10] when they suggested
the use of a steady-state free precession sequence (SSFP) to map T2 infor-
mation after T1 had been assessed.

In simple terms DESPOT1 and DESPOT2 (referred to as DESPOT in
this text) consists in acquiring a set of measurements over different flip an-
gles (FA) and fitting the expected behaviour in order to estimate T1 and T2
relaxation times inside each voxel. To fully understand how this is possible
it is important to comprehend the physical processes behind each signal in
order to be able to predict the obtained results.

2.3.1 Obtaining T1 and T2 from collected data

The parameters of interest T1 and T2 are obtained from a set of SPGR and
SSFP images acquired at fixed TR and incrementally increased flip angle ?.

19



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

Following the description presented in [10] the SPGR can be represented in
the linear form by:

SSPGR
sin(?)

= E1
SSPGR
tan(?)

+ M0(1 ?E1) (2.40)

from which the slope m and Y-intercept b can be estimated by linear regres-
sion, allowing us to extract T1 and M0 as being:

T1 = ?TR/ln(m) (2.41)

M0 = b/(1 ?m) (2.42)

Afterwards, T1 is used in order to fit T2 from the linearised version of the
SSFP equations:

SSSFP
sin(?)

=
E1 ?E2
1 ?E1E2

×
SSSFP
tan(?)

+
M0(1 ?E1)
1 ?E1E2

(2.43)

where, also by linear regression we obtain a new m and b resulting in,

T2 = ?TR/ln(
m?E1
mE1 ? 1

) (2.44)

M0 = b(E1E2 ? 1)/(1 ?E1) (2.45)

Within this thesis, it was decided that instead of linearising the problem
and fitting first for T1 and then for T2 a more interesting approach would be
to simultaneously fit for T1 and T2 using MatLab 2012a optimization routine
fminsearch. A more complete description of this optimization procedure is
described in Chapter 4.

2.3.2 mcDESPOT - Multi Component DESPOT

A limitation of the DESPOT method for estimating T1 and T2 is the as-
sumption of a single source of signal inside each voxel[27]. This assumption
ignores the inherently complex structure of biological tissues. In order to
overcome this issue, Deoni et al. presented in 2008 a very interesting paper
[27] in which a two exchanging water-pools model was proposed in order to
explain the observed signal inside each voxel. Following previous work pre-
sented by Spenser and Fishbein [11] and Deoni et al.[28, 29], a fast decaying
pool corresponding to trapped water inside myelin (F) and a slower decaying
pool corresponding to water outside the myelin sheet (S) where considered.
With this in mind the total equilibrium magnetization M0 results from the
sum of individual fractional proton densities (fF and fS) with their corre-
sponding decay rates T1,F = 1/R1,F , T1,S = 1/R1,S, T2,F = 1/R2,F and

20



CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND MATERIAL

T2,S = 1/R2,S. Assuming a constant exchange rate (k) between the two
pools (kFS = 1/?FS and kSF = 1/?SF ) at equilibrium we have

fFkFS = fSkSF (2.46)

and,
fS = 1 ?fF (2.47)

resulting in a seven dimensional problem that needs to be solved for M0,
kFS, fF , T1,F , T2,F , T1,S and T2,S. By incorporating this set-up into the
Bloch-McConnell equations (Equation 2.48) we obtain:

dM

dt
= AM + C (2.48)

Assuming a periodic instantaneous excitation along the x-axis, the steady
state solution to this problem may be found as [11, 27, 29, 30, 31]

This set of equations constitute the two-pool model of DESPOT. One flaw
that can be assigned to this two-pool model is that it doesn’t take into ac-
count partial volume effects i.e., voxels containing brain tissue and ventricle
or meninges, result in myelin water fraction underestimation [30]. In order to
overcome this issue, Deoni et al. presented in 2012 a three-pool model that
incorporated a new, non-exchanging “free water” component. The three-
pool model is similar to the two-pool model and a complete description may
be found in [30].

Chapter 3

Susceptibility Weighted
Imaging of the Neonatal
Brain

As stated in section 2.2, SWI is very sensitive to susceptibility variations
between oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin.[32] In the same section
the common SWI processing pipeline was also described. In this chapter the
gold standard SWI protocol for the adult brain is presented alongside with
its adaptation to the neonatal brain which is known to have longer relaxation
times.[25]

3.1 SWI Adult Protocol

A review of the literature confirmed that the protocol provided by Haacke
et al. in their 2009 review paper [1] is in fact standard. Here, they stated
that in order to obtain optimum vein contrast at 1.5T, an echo time (TE)
between 40 and 80 ms must be chosen. Furthermore, if we recall from sec-
tion 2.2.2.1 the linear relationship between phase and field strength it is
straightforward to understand that with a field strength of 3T the optimal
TE values would drop to between 20 and 40 ms.

According to [15, 33, 34], the typical SWI adult protocol on a 3T MR
system involves a 3D, fully flow-compensated gradient echo sequence using
the following parameters:

• TE ? 20 ms

• TR ? 30 ms

• Flip Angle ? 15?

23



CHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE
NEONATAL BRAIN

• voxel size between 0.5 mm ×0.5 mm ×1.5 mm and 1 mm ×1 mm ×4
mm

• Employing either SENSE (sensitivity encoding) or GRAPPA (gener-
alized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions) for acceleration
typically with a factor of 2

• Total acquisition time between 3 to 7 min

The data is then exported from the scanner, and post-processed offline using
in-house developed pipelines.

proposed protocol. It is possible to see blood vessels as hypo-intense signals. (b)
Phase image of the same brain presented in (a). It is possible to see that vessel

information is highlighted.

As a first step towards implementing SWI in the neonatal brain, a neona-
tal protocol was proposed based on simulations over a range of T1 and T2
tissue parameters expected in the neonatal brain as described further in this
thesis (section 3.4):

• TE = 25 ms

• TR = 32 ms

• Flip Angle = 12?

• voxel size 0.5 mm ×0.5 mm ×2 mm

• SENSE factor 2

This protocol was used as starting point for developing the SWI post-
processing pipeline and protocol adaptation towards the neonatal brain.

24



CHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE
NEONATAL BRAIN

In order to have some test data to develop the necessary post-processing
scripts the proposed neonatal protocol was tested on an adult volunteer
(Figure 3.1). The data was acquired on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner and
informed consent was given by the volunteer according to a local ethical
approval. A magnitude and phase image obtained with this protocol is
presented in Figure 3.1.

3.2 Exploring Phase Information

As stated in [14], phase information depends on manufacturer convention.
This means that the same venous vessel may appear with positive phase on a
Phillips scanner and negative on a Siemens scanner depending on the phase
convention that each system uses. Therefore it is of highest importance to
fully understand which phase information we are interested in so that we
can correctly apply the filters described in section 2.2.2.2. Looking more
carefully to the phase image obtained (Figure 3.2) we can see that the vessel
information is positive and therefore the phase mask in the post-processing
pipeline (section 2.2.2.2) should also be positive.

Figure 3.2: Transversal slice of an adult brain phase image. In the image scale
all values range from ?? to ?. It is important to see that vessel information has

positive phase.

NEONATAL BRAIN

3.3 Development of a Graphical User Interface

The post-processing scripts that allow the creation of SWI from both the
magnitude and phase images, were developed by integrating MatLab 2012a
with FSL-FMRIB Software Library v5.0. However for users which are not
familiar with programming environment the use of scripts to obtain clinical
relevant data may become confusing. With this in mind, in order to facili-
tate this processing step a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in
MatLab 2012a with the guide toolbox environment(Figure 3.3).

Figure 3.3: Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed in order to facilitate the
application of the SWI processing pipeline.

This interface assumes a .PAR/.REC image file, as exported from Philips
Scanners. The “Select File” and “Import File” buttons, allow the user to
browse until finding the desired file and import it. The Display section
(Figure 3.4) has a drop-box that allows the user to switch between different
types of images that will be displayed in the blank space in Figure 3.3.
Initially, it only allows the user to chose between magnitude and phase
images, after the SWI is created then it also allows the user to view the
susceptibility weighted image, the high-pass filtered image and the positive
and negative phase mask images.

The Homodyne Filtering Approach Section (Figure 3.5) allows the user
to easily define the homodyne filtering parameters, where the filter size must

be defined as a fraction of the phase encoding steps. SWI-factor is defined
as the number of times the phase-mask is applied to the magnitude image,
while the Image Resolution parameters must be defined by the user. The
“Generate SW Image” button uses the defined parameters to generate the
susceptibility weighted image.

Figure 3.6: SWI GUI Tools Section. This section offers the possibility to define
two points and compute the contrast by difference (CD) and the contrast ratio

(CR) between them. The “LOI” and “Plot LOI” buttons allow the user to draw,
compute and plot the CR along the line length.

The Tools section in Figure 3.6 allows the user to analyse the displayed
slice. Two points can be be selected by pressing the “Select P1” and “Select
P2” buttons, or by typing the image pixel coordinate in the respective space,
in order to compute the contrast by difference (CD = |P1 ? P2|) and the

contrast ratio (CR = (P1 ?P2)/(P1 + P2)). The “Change Contrast” button
opens a small MatLab tool named imcontrst that allows the user to change
the displayed image contrast to better view some structures. The “LOI”
and “Plot LOI” buttons allow the user to draw a line, compute and plot the
CR along the line length (Figure 3.7).

Figure 3.8: SWI GUI export section, this allows the user to export the ticked
images.

The export section in Figure 3.8 allows the user to export the ticked
images either in “NIFTI” format or in “.bmp” format.

To finalize there is the Figure Options section (Figure 3.9). This sec-

tion has three buttons that allow the user to show the previous selected
points and line (“Show P1 and P2” and “Show Line” buttons) and a “Gen-
erate mIPs” button that generates a minimum intensity projection image
of the previously computed SWI. The tick-boxes “Invert mIP Range” and
“Invert Phase Mask Range” allow the user to invert the image scale of the
minimum intensity projection and the phase masks in order to give a more
angiography-like effect. The tick-box “Record LOI output in file” when
ticked records the data analysed along each drawn line to an output file in
order to be analysed later.

Figure 3.10: This figure represents how the signal and relative contrast changes
over different echo times and flip angles.

29



CHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE
NEONATAL BRAIN

As stated previously in this text(section 2.2.4) the relaxation times in the
neonatal brain are different from the adult brain.[25] Therefore it is neces-
sary to optimize the sequence parameters (TE and FA) in order to obtained
a low WM/GM contrast with as high signal intensity as possible, the low
WM/GM contrast is important because in SWI we are not interested in this
type of contrast but on using the magnitude image to map susceptibility ef-
fects. In order to assess this a plot of the CR over different TR = TE + 7 (the
number 7ms is the minimum time difference allowed by the scanner between
TR and TE) ms and FA parameters was done (Figure 3.10). This simulation
assumed white matter relaxation times of T1 = 2500 ms and T2 = 240 ms
and gray matter relaxation times of T2 = 1800 ms and T2 = 144 ms [35].

By analysing Figure 3.10 one can decide on a good compromise between
expected signal intensity and desired contrast. As stated above in this text,
in SWI we are interested in obtaining images with as low WM/GM contrast
as possible while guaranteeing a good signal intensity, it was therefore de-
cided, by inspecting Figure 3.10 to test a range of repetition times between
28 ms and 32 ms and a range of flip angles between 10? and 14?. This range
of parameters was tested on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner and data was
obtained on newborns less than one week old with informed consent given
by their parents according to local ethical approval requirements, in order
to assess which set of parameters would give a good result.

3.5 Revisiting Voxel Aspect Ratio

In section 2.2.3.3 a small introduction on the gold-standard SWI voxel ac-
quisition size was presented. This kind of voxel ratio allows an excellent
visualisation of the transversal plain, however, information from the other
two planes of view (Sagittal and Coronal) is much worse.

Figure 3.11: Susceptibility Weighted Image of a baby brain acquired with
in-plain resolution of 0.65 mm ×0.65 mm and a voxel thickness of 2.6 mm.

Looking at Figure 3.11 we can see that the obtained SNR is very good

30



CHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE
NEONATAL BRAIN

and the vessel structures are very well depicted. But we are interested in
being able to visualize these structures over all three planes, so, in order
to accomplish this goal we suggest to, instead of acquiring images with a
1:4 voxel ratio, to do it with a 1:1 voxel ratio. Deistung et al. showed in
their 2008 paper [24] how SWI contrast changes with different voxel AR.
According to this study, best SWI contrast is obtained for AR larger than 2,
however within this thesis it was decided that the predicted loss in contrast
from an AR of 1 compared to an AR &gt; 2 does not compensate the loss of
relevant information in the Sagittal and Transversal planes of view. An AR
of 1 will reduce the SNR per voxel but, on the other hand, it will allow us
to visualise vessel information on all three directions.

Figure 3.12: Magnetic field distribution resulting from a cylinder perpendicular
to a static magnetic field B0. The white boxes indicate voxels with aspect ratios
of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4. The geometric relationship voxels, vein and field distribution

are shown in the right side figure. Adapted from [24]

Special care must be taken when changing the AR to 1 because of the
expected phase distribution shown in Figure 3.12. When using an AR of 4
the positive mask was more favourable in order to guarantee that only the
signal at the center of the vessels is decreased. However for a 1:1 ratio we
found it to be more favourable to adopt a positive phase mask to enhance
vessels in transverse plane, while using a negative phase mask to enhance
vessels in the Sagittal and Coronal planes (Figure 3.13). In this way the
center of the vessels is enhanced on all three planes of view, while if we
had adopted only a positive phase mask we would have produced a signal
decrease at the center of the vessels when viewing from the transverse plane,
and at the borders of the vessels when viewing from the coronal and sagittal

31



CHAPTER 3. SUSCEPTIBILITY WEIGHTED IMAGING OF THE
NEONATAL BRAIN

planes. This guarantees that the signal of the vessels is always decreased at
their center avoiding the overestimation of their diameter.

3.6 Minimum Intensity Projection of 1:1 voxel ra-
tio images

When acquiring images at 1:4 voxel ratio, because the voxel thickness is so
much bigger than the in-plane resolution, usually it is only useful to cre-
ate minimum intensity projections along the transverse plane. On the other
hand, when acquiring images at a 1:1 ratio it becomes reasonable to produce
minimum intensity projection images along the three different planes of view.

The GUI “Generate mIPs” button (recall Figure 3.9) was hence modified
in order to produce minimum intensity projections along the three planes of
view, and therefore, allowing us to obtain images such as shown in Figure
3.14.

acquired with a 1:1 voxel ratio.

These images allow the user to have a sense of how each vessel or struc-
ture relates to each other over the entire brain. This is of special interest for
depicting when small bleeds occurs inside the brain, because having a view
over different three planes allows an easier differentiation of their shape and
size.

3.7 Neonatal Brain SWI

Within this chapter it was discussed how it is possible to obtain a SWI
neonatal protocol from the commonly used adult one. The main goal of this
chapter was to implement a neonatal protocol that could be used in a clinical
setting. In order to test and probe a satisfactory protocol, 13 volunteer
babies with informed consent given by their parents where scanned on a
Philips 3T Achieva scanner according to local ethical approval requirements.
This way it was possible to test a range of repetition times between 28ms
and 32ms as well as a range of FA between 10? and 14? in order to obtain
a good compromise between acquisition time and signal to noise ratio. This
allowed us, after visual inspection between different exams, to obtain the
following protocol:

• 3D sagittal spoiled gradient echo sequence

• TE = 25 ms

• TR = 32 ms

• Flip Angle = 12?

• voxel size 0.65 mm ×0.65 mm ×0.65 mm

• SENSE factor 2.1 × 2.1

This set-up allows a full 3D image of the neonatal brain with an acquisition
time below 5 minutes.

Chapter 4

DESPOT Versus Multi
Component DESPOT

In this chapter the issue of how to correctly process a set of multi-angle
SPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimate T1 and T2 maps is covered.
We start be describing the implementation of a single component signal
model and in section 4.1 we show how this can be used to generate test data
with noise added that is then fitted with a suitable model to explore the
precision and accuracy of the results. In section 4.2 this is extended to a 2
component model and an evaluation of its estimation precision and accuracy
is performed. Having demonstrated some basic properties of the parameter
estimation methods under 1 or 2 component scenarios, a systematic explo-
ration of how to optimize DESPOT is presented in chapter 5.

Unless otherwise stated, along this chapter all simulations and process-
ing steps were done in MatLab 2012a environment.

4.1 Estimation of T1 and T2

In order to produce a processing tool that correctly estimates T1 and T2
from a given data-set, a computer model of the one compartment expected
signal behaviour inside a given voxel was generated. This allows us to have
a data-set with known T1 and T2 parameters that can easily be tested under
real-life settings.

The noise of magnitude MR images noise has been shown to follow the
Rice distribution[31, 36] (Equation 4.1)

where, M is the apparent measured signal, A is the true signal, ? is the
standard deviation of the noise added to both the real and imaginary parts
of the MR signal (which we assume to be the same) and Ii, i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,
are the modified Bessel functions of the first kind.

In order to generate SPGR and SSFP signals with Rician noise, normal
distributed noise N(0,?) was added to both the real and imaginary parts of
the signals. Following the notation presented in section 2.3 we defined our
noisy model as:

S
noisy
SPGR = |(SPGR + i0) + (N(0,?) + iN(0,?))| (4.2)

S
noisy
SSFP = |(M

SS
x + iM

SS

Figure 4.1: Example of a simulated DESPOT data-set for both white matter
(dark blue and green curves) and gray matter (red and light blue curves). This

set of signals was generated considering M0 = 1 arbitrary unit and with an added
noise of ? = 1 × 10?3.

Recalling from section 2.3 that DESOPT1 and DESPOT2 consist of esti-
mating T1 and T2 from a set of signal measurements over different flip angles,
it is possible to use Equations 4.2 and 4.3 to simulate this experiment and
create model fitting routines.

35



CHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT

Based on the work presented by Stanisz et al. in 2005 [37] two sets
of tissue relaxation times were considered in an adult brain: White mat-
ter (WM) with a T1 = 1084 ms and a T2 = 69 ms, and Gray matter
(GM) with a T1 = 1820 ms and a T2 = 99 ms. Assuming a repetition
time of TR = 4.36 ms for the SPGR signal and TR = 4.567 ms (mini-
mum TR times allowed by the scanner) for the SSFP signal and a set of
flip angles such that ?SPGR = (3

?, 4?, 5?, 6?, 7?, 9?, 13?, 18?) and ?SSFP =
(10?, 13?, 17?, 20?, 23?, 30?, 43?, 60?)[30], for an added noise of ? = 1 × 10?3
with an assumed M0 = 1 it is possible to obtain the signal curves presented
in Figure 4.1, which represent the signal variation of the SPGR and SSFP
curves for both white matter and gray matter (respectively dark blue, green,
red and light blue curves) over different flip angles.

Figure 4.2: This figure shows the obtained fitted model (red curves) obtained
using the MatLab2012a fminsearch tool superimposed over the original noisy

SPGR (dark blue) and SSFP (green) data. The estimated parameters are
T1 = 1053ms and T2 = 68ms which are close to simulated white matter values.

To derive the estimates of T1 and T2 parameters used to generate the
signals presented in Figure 4.1 a fit of the SPGR and SSFP models was
performed using MatLab2012a’s “simplex” algorithm implemented as fmin-
search tool. The cost function was defined as the minimization between the
difference of the model and the data, and the stopping criteria was set as
1 × 10?6 of the obtained solution or to a maximum number of iterations of
200 × Number of variables. Applying this to the white matter data shown
in Figure 4.1 we were able to obtain the fitted model presented in Figure
4.2.

Figure 4.3: (a) DESPOT estimation of T1 histogram, µ±? = 1083 ± 51ms. (b)
DESPOT estimation of T2 histogram, µ±? = 69 ± 3ms. The obtained µ and ?

values were obtained by fitting the histogram to a Rice distribution.

The obtained estimated parameters in the case presented in Figure 4.2
were T1 = 1053ms and T2 = 68ms which represents a T1 deviation of 2.9%
and a T2 deviation of 1.4. One obvious question that arises is how does
this fitting procedure behave over a large number of noisy tests. In order to
answer this question Monte Carlo simulation were done where 10000 noisy
sets where simulated and fitted. The estimated parameters histograms can
be seen in Figure 4.3.

The histograms presented in Figure 4.3 represent more clearly the ac-
curacy and precision of the fitting procedure. If we define the variation
coefficient as p = ?/true value then we can see that when estimating T1 we
obtain p = 0.047 and for T2 we obtain p = 0.050, which indicates a good
estimation precision for this method.

So far we have assumed that the SSFP signal was on resonance (offset
frequency band with high signal - recall Figure 2.5), however, in general
there is a frequency offset variation along the human brain and this factor
needs to be taken into account. One way to overcome this issue is to produce
two sets of SSFP curves and making sure that they have a frequency offset
shift of ?, this allows a third parameter to be estimated which tells us in
which frequency position of the graph presented in Figure 2.5 we are.

With this extra parameter to fit the problem dimensionality rises to three
unknown parameters, however we found that the “simplex” fminsearch tool
still allows an easy and precise convergence towards the right solutions, we
were therefore able to try this set-up in a healthy volunteer and obtain the
T1, T2 and frequency offset (?) maps shown in Figure 4.4. This data was

In this discussion M0 is ignored because before fitting all signals are di-
vided by their respective mean value, in order to avoid fitting for M0.[27, 30]

The set of images used to create the maps presented in Figure 4.4 were
acquired over the sagittal plane with a resolution of 1.8mm×1.8mm×1.8mm,
and a SENSE factor of 1.5 × 1.5 over the Right-Left and Anterior-Posterior
directions.

CHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT

4.2 Evaluation of mcDESPOT model

In the previous section the precision of the single component DESPOT model
to estimate T1 and T2 was evaluated. In this section we evaluate the precision
of the two-pool model proposed by Deoni et al. in 2008 [27].

Figure 4.5: This figure represents the normalized SPGR (dark blue),
SSFP-0?, 180? (red) and SSFP-0? (green). The set of parameters used to generate

these signals was: T1,F = 465ms, T1,S = 1070ms, fF = 0.2, ?F,S = 100ms
?1,

T2,F = 26ms, T2,S = 117ms,? = 0rad

As done in the previous section we start by implementing a two-pool
signal model over different flip angles with added normal distribution noise
to both the real and imaginary parts of the signals in order to obtain a Rice
distribution after calculating the image magnitude. This two-pool model ex-
pands the problem dimensionality from three unknown parameters to seven
unknown parameters, making the fitting procedure much harder and requires
more creative approaches to obtain the correct estimation of parameters.

We first start by simulating the two-pool model. For reproducibility
reasons we chose the set of parameters presented by Deoni et al. in their
2008 paper [27]. After this, the SPGR and the SSFP signals are normal-
ized relative to their respective mean value (the SSFP-0? and SSFP-0?, 180?

were considered coupled and the mean signal over all SSFP flip angles was
considered in order to reduced noise scaling - Figure 4.5). This is done in
order to avoid fitting for M0 and reduce the dimensionality of the problem.

39



CHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT

For the two-pool model we found that the “simplex” fitting procedure
no longer converged to a solution with the desired accuracy and precision.
To overcome this issue a more creative approach was designed in order to
guarantee a correct estimation. When running optimization routines on non-
linear search spaces, the starting point is a crucial factor towards finding
a correct solution. In order to make sure the best solution was obtained a
dictionary was generated over a grid of physiologically meaningful relaxation
parameters. Using an orthogonal matching pursuit approach [38, 39] we
were able to select of parameters that best explain the collected data. This
set of starting point candidates where then rank-ordered by a least-squares
criteria, and the best 100 candidates were used as starting points for a non-
linear least-squares optimization, MatLab 2012a routine lsqnonlin tool. We
then picked the rank-ordered obtained solutions by a least-squares difference
criteria in order to select the solution that better explained the data as the
correct one.

Figure 4.6: Example of the obtained fit solution (red) plotted against the
simulated SPGR (green), SSFP-0? (dark blue)and SSFP-0?, 180? (black). The

correct solution is also shown in light blue. The obtained solution is:
T1,F = 465ms, T1,S = 1070ms, fF = 0.20, ?F,S = 100ms, T2,F = 26ms,

T2,S = 117ms and ? = 1.6 × 10?6rad.

In order to test this fitting procedure we first applied it to a practically
noiseless case (added ? = 1×10?7) and we realised that the fitting procedure

40



CHAPTER 4. DESPOT VERSUS MULTI COMPONENT DESPOT

was able to find the correct solution (Figure 4.6).

Figure 4.7: Example of the obtained fit solution (red) plotted against the
simulated SPGR (green), SSFP-0? (dark blue) and SSFP-0?, 180? (black). The

correct solution is also show in light blue. The obtained solution is:
T1,F = 769ms, T1,S = 1055ms, fF = 0.62, ?F,S = 659ms, T2,F = 53ms,

T2,S = 151ms and ? = ?0.0002rad.

The next step was to try and apply this same procedure to a data-set
with a small amount of noise added (? = 1 × 10?4). Figure 4.7 shows the
result for that fitting procedure. As can be seen the correct answer was
no longer found, however what is very concerning is that the curves of the
fitted model, and of the correct model are practically overlapping. In or-
der to assess this, it was decided to try and visualize how the cost-function
search space behaves along a straight line that connects the 100 best found
solutions and the correct answer. The results are shown in Figure 4.8 and it
is astonishing to see that no significant differences seen between the found
solutions and the correct solution.

Looking carefully at Figure 4.8 it can be seen that the found solutions
give a lower cost-function value than the correct answer, which suggests that
this is an intrinsic problem of the model and not of the way we are searching
for the correct parameter estimates.

These results agree with what is discussed in the paper published by

41

Christopher L. Lankford and Mark D. Does in 2013 [31]. This paper sug-
gests that mcDESPOT-derived estimates of tissue parameters do not have
enough precision to be related to specific tissue characteristics. Their re-
sults indicate that previously published results, may have used data fitting
methods that implicitly constrained parameter solution, or that the two-
pool model may not be sufficient to describe the observed SPGR and SSFP
signals.

In 2012 Deoni et al. proposed a three-pool mcDESPOT model, stating
that it should be able to more precisely estimate water-pool parameters,
however it was decided that this approach would make the fitting procedure
even more difficult and was not relevant to follow this even more complex
model line of thought within the scope of this work. Rather, it was decided
to implement a framework to explore systematically a set of flip angles that
guarantee a low estimation variance over different tissue parameters.

Chapter 5

Optimizing DESPOT

In the previous chapter it was discussed how to implement the standard
DESPOT and mcDESPOT protocol and an assessment was done of the ac-
curacy and precision of both methods.

In their 2013 paper[31], Christopher L. Lankford and Mark D. Does,
used a statistical tool known as the Crame?r-Rao Lower bound (CRLB) as a
way to predict the minimum possible variance one can obtain when estimat-
ing parameters using the mcDESPOT two-pool model. The CRLB has been
used in previous work as an optimization tool for MR protocols[36, 40, 41].
In this chapter we adapted this statistical tool to both verify and optimize
the DESPOT protocol precision and accuracy.

One important question that arises is how can the CRLB be computed
and once this is done, how can we use it as an optimization tool for our
protocol? These are the main issues which are discussed in the following
sections.

5.1 Crame?r-Rao Lower Bound - Gaussian noise

The most common way to derive the CRLB is assuming a Gaussian dis-
tributed noise level[31, 36]. Following the notation presented in [31], if we
assume a model g(x,?), where x ?&amp;lt;N is an independent parameter vector
(for what this work is concerned the flip angles) and ? ?&amp;lt;M is a vector of
model parameters (T1 and T2). Considering a set of N noisy observations
y ?&lt;N from which we obtain a random estimate ??, the estimated parameter
vector covariance matrix is bounded by:

?
??
?
?E[??]

??
F?1

?E[??]

??

T

(5.1)

43



CHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT

where, F is the Fisher information matrix (FIM), E[.] is the expectation
operator, and the derivative of one vector with respect to another follows
the convention (?a/?b)ij ? ?ai/?bj.

The FIM is a matrix built from the parameter vector ? log-likelihood
hyper-surface (L) curvature[31]. Which in the case of Gaussian distributed
noise of the observed data yi, i = 1, 2, 3, ...,N simplifies into [31, 36, 42]:

Fjk = E(
?2L

??j??k
) =

N?
i=1

(

?2i

?gi

) (5.2)

In Equation 5.1 the CRLB also includes the estimator gradient matrix,
however for unbiased estimators this term reduces to an identity matrix.
Unless stated otherwise, along this work this unbiased condition is consid-
ered true and therefore ?E[??]/?? is considered to be the identity matrix.

Because all signals are considered to be magnitude signals, and we add
Gaussian distributed noise to both the real and imaginary signal compo-
nents, the resulting measured signal noise follows a Rician distribution. This
means that the Gaussian CRLB model is only valid for signals with inten-
sities at least two times bigger than the noise floor [31], therefore we found
instructive to estimate the CRLB assuming also a Rice distribution of the
noise model. A small overview of how this is achieved is discussed in the
next section.

5.2 Crame?r-Rao Lower Bound - Rician noise

The Rice distribution follows the distribution shown in equation 4.1. The
log-likelihood of a set of N measurements can therefore be expressed as:

L =
N?
i=1

[log Mi ? 2 log ? + log I0(

With this in mind the FIM may be computed by:

Fjk = E(

??j??k
) =

which according to [36] can be expressed as:

Zk =

The function Zk must be numerically computed, since it does not have a
closed form. Also, as suggested in [36], a look-up table was pre-computed
and linear interpolation was used to assess Zk values in order to save com-
puting time and resources.

5.3 Selection of optimized Flip Angle set

The main goal of the work presented in this chapter is to optimize the
DESPOT protocol by selecting in a rigorous way the combination of flip
angles that allow us to obtain the lowest estimation variance possible.

5.3.1 Defining Cost Function

In order to find a set of N flip angles that minimizes the predicted CRLB
and at the same time ensure that the relative precision of each parameter
(T1,T2) is equally weighted, we normalize the CRLB of each parameter by
its respective squared value. As the brain has a heterogeneous range of T1
and T2 values that we wish to optimize for. We consider a cost function
that computes the CRLB over a T1 and T2 grid and selects the combination
of parameters that gives the highest CRLB. Minimizing the output of this
cost function guarantees the optimization of the worst case scenario in each
step of the optimization procedure[42].

5.3.2 Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is an optimization routine that is known to be suitable
for large scale problems, since it doesn’t rely on gradient estimation to find
a global minimum solution.

This method is inspired on thermodynamics, more specifically on how
metals cool and anneal, or liquids freeze and crystallize. At high temper-
atures, the liquid molecules are able to freely move with respect to each
other, however when the temperature drops slowly, this mobility is lost.
During this process the atoms are able to line themselves and form a pure
crystal (lowest energy state). Mimicking this natural process is the heart
of simulated annealing. This process can be modelled by the Boltzmann
distribution,

P(E) ? e?E/kT (5.7)

45



CHAPTER 5. OPTIMIZING DESPOT

which describes the idea that a system in thermal equilibrium at a temper-
ature T has a probability to be distributed over different energy states E.
This allows the systems to leave low energy states (local minima) in favour
of finding better ones (global minima)[43].

This optimization routine is implemented in MatLab2012a optimization
toolbox optimtool, and was used to evaluate the previously discussed cost
function in order to find a set of flip angles that allow low T1 and T2 esti-
mation variances.

5.3.3 Verifying the CRLB

One important first step is to verify if the predicted bound agrees with the
fitting procedure implemented. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed in
order to compare the predicted bound with the obtained fit standard devi-
ation over a large number of trials.

The Rice distribution is known to converge towards a Gaussian distribu-
tion for SNR &gt; 3 [44], and therefore for simplicity we assumed the Gaussian
distributed CRLB. Because this model does not assume the data is normal-
ized prior to the fitting procedure, in order to maintain equity between
obtained standard deviation and predicted CRLB, the data was fitted with-
out the normalization step, and M0 was considered as an extra parameter.

The Monte Carlo simulation was set-up as followed: 10000 noisy SPGR
and SSFP-0?, 180? trails were generated. Correct knowledge of ? was con-
sidered since it can be assessed with B0 mapping techniques. The considered
parameters were ? = 1 × 10?3, M0 = 1, T1 = 1083ms and T2 = 69ms. The
simulated data was fitted using fminsearch tool for M0, T1 and T2 parame-
ters using the correct answer as the starting point. The obtained histograms
and predicted CRLB can be seen in Figure 5.1. This Figure shows that
the CRLB and the obtained histograms standard deviation are in excellent
agreement and therefore the CRLB can be used as a means to predict the
parameter estimation error given a set of parameters.

Once this was verified, the CRLB was used to select an optimized set of
FA that would give a good compromise between parameter estimation error
and acquisition time. Using the approach described in section 5.3.1 a grid
of expected WM and GM parameters expected in the neonatal brain was
considered. T1,WM ? T1,GM = [2300; 2700] ? [1600; 2000]ms in increments
of 50ms and T2,WM ?T2,GM = [20; 200]ms in increments of 20ms [35]. The
optimization was performed for sets of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, and 4 FA. Each
set had equal number of SPGR and SSFP measurements. The optimized

(middle) and M0 (bottom).

set of 16 FA is:

• SPGR:4.60?, 5.32?, 5.51?, 5.86?, 6.14?, 6.88?, 9.93?, 21.47?

• SSFP:6.67?, 14.97?, 16.24?, 20.12?, 22.80?, 23.70?, 33.63?, 84.87?

In order to compare the optimized FA with the original set, the predicted
precision (CRLB/TrueV alue) for both T1 and T2 was plotted over a grid
of relaxation times (Figure 5.2). It can be seen that the optimized FA guar-
antee a lower CRLB over the range of relaxation times when compared with
the original set. Looking more carefully at the obtained set of FA it is strik-
ing to see some of them are very close together, perhaps suggesting that the
actual number of measurements can be reduced without strongly affecting
the estimation precision. In fact, performing the optimization with only 2
SPGR (optimized to:5.7? and 7.3?) and 3 SSFP (optimized to:14.3?, 24.0?

ure 5.3).

Figure 5.2: This figure shows how the estimated precision (precision
p = ?2/T21,2, where red represents worse precision and dark blue best brecision
obtained over the grid) and T2((b) and (d)) changes over a grid of T1 and T2

parameters ranging from 1600ms to 2800ms (horizontal axis) and 20ms to 300ms
(vertical axis) respectively. (a)(b) Gold-standard set-up. (c)(d) Optimized set-up.

Figure 5.3 shows that even with only 5 FA the model only has estimation
errors larger than 10% for very high T1 and low T2 parameters.

The results shown so far indicate that the DESPOT1 and DESPOT2
set-up can be optimized using the CRLB. Picking the correct set of FA al-
lows estimation of T1 and T2 parameters with an error bellow 10% with only
2 SPGR and 2 SSFP measurements.

It must be noticed that this optimization set-up is too simplistic, as in
a clinical scanner the MR system performs internal receive and transmit
calibrations at the beginning of each acquisition sequence resulting in dif-
ferent gain factors that may corrupt the estimation and should be taken

into account. This issue is usually overcome by normalizing the data by its
respective mean, therefore one way to further improve this work would be
to develop and implement a normalized signal CRLB model.

Chapter 6

Summary and Conclusion

This work has described how to apply advance MR techniques to image the
neonatal brain.

In Chapter 3 it was discussed how to adapt standard adult SWI protocol
to the neonatal brain. The goal was to create a SWI capability for use on
neonatal brain. This involved proposing a dedicated neonatal protocol, in-
cluding a re-evaluation of the effect of varying slice thickness and developing
a GUI to allow users to produce filtered images that emphasise susceptibility
effects from raw SWI data. The developed GUI will allow future systematic
clinical testing and further explore some of the issues intrinsic to this type of
MR imaging. Also we demonstrated that voxel size plays a very important
role when SWI is concerned and that for isotropic ratios it should be taken
into account not only positive phase information but also negative phase
information. This however was not systematically evaluated and should be
explored in future work.

Within Chapter 4 it was described how to correctly process a set of
multi-angle SPGR and SSFP signals in order to estimate T1 and T2 for both
a one compartment and two compartment models. We concluded that the
single pool model can correctly estimate parameters with a precision around
5%. We were not able to obtain satisfying results from the two-pool model
approach and decided that further work on the topic would not be impor-
tant for the scope of this project.

In Chapter 5 the use of the CRLB as an optimization tool for DESPOT
was discussed. Along this chapter we showed that the CRLB is in good
agreement with the obtained estimation standard deviation from Monte
Carlo simulations. Further we showed that it can be used to optimize the
DESPOT acquisition protocol for a range of T1 and T2 parameters. We also
concluded that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of FA samples

50



CHAPTER 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

without significantly affecting the estimation of T1 and T2 precision.

In the end of this project both SWI and DESPOT, have been set-up with
technical testing that provides the basis for full scale tests of the methods
on neonatal subjects.
